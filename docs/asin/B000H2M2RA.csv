Rest Stop kept me in suspense even though, as pointed out, there really isn't anything new under the sun here in Rest Stop.  Still, the production value is exceedingly high and well done.  As is the acting of the main character and the background characters.  There is a sense of ""what is reality and what isn't"" that makes you yourself question what is going on in each Act of the movie.  The gore effects were not in your face unless it helped the story line.  That is, the movie wasn't gory just to be gory, the violence was there to move the story along in the direction you yourself are not sure of until the dark and twisted ending (which is the best ending for the movie to have in comparison to the alternate endings shown on the DVD).  Ironically I would have thought that Rest Stop had been in theaters and, in comparison to Rest Stop, the movie Slither would have been direct to DVD due to its poor story, poor acting, poor gore effects.  Basically, everything Slither (as a movie that was placed in theaters) should have had, Rest Stop, which is a direct to DVD, does have.  Strange.  But true.  If you want to rent a movie to watch, a good scary movie, one that will twist your mind and make you question your own sanity, rent Rest Stop...if you want to be bored so badly that you begin to bang your head against the wall until your brains come out of your ears, well then rent Slither.",5,I would have to say this is a fairly good horror movie...,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,1484,"['least', 'comparison', 'movies', 'Slither', 'watched', 'movies', 'yesterday', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'kept', 'suspense', 'even', 'though', 'pointed', 'out', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'sun', 'here', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'Still', 'production', 'value', 'exceedingly', 'high', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'main', 'character', 'background', 'characters', 'sense', 'what', 'reality', 'what', ""n't"", 'question', 'what', 'going', 'Act', 'movie', 'gore', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'face', 'helped', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'gory', 'just', 'be', 'gory', 'violence', 'was', 'there', 'move', 'story', 'direction', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'dark', 'twisted', 'ending', 'best', 'ending', 'movie', 'have', 'comparison', 'alternate', 'endings', 'shown', 'DVD', 'Ironically', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'had', 'been', 'theaters', 'comparison', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'movie', 'Slither', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'direct', 'DVD', 'due', 'poor', 'story', 'poor', 'acting', 'poor', 'gore', 'effects', 'Basically', 'everything', 'Slither', 'movie', 'was', 'placed', 'theaters', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'direct', 'DVD', 'have', 'Strange', 'true', 'want', 'rent', 'movie', 'watch', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'twist', 'mind', 'make', 'question', 'own', 'sanity', 'rent', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'want', 'be', 'bored', 'so', 'badly', 'begin', 'bang', 'head', 'wall', 'brains', 'come', 'ears', 'well', 'then', 'rent', 'Slither']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

He explained that this movie was going to be shown on Sci-Fi channel and then be followed with a DVD release in both Unrated and Rated versions.This movie looks pretty polished for a low budget film.  There are some areas where the camera shakes quite a bit, I suppose that's intended to induce suspense, however, in my case it only induced nausea, and the actors, while they don't overact, they are not believable as their characters.  Joseph Lawrence, who played the incredibly young sheriff, was not convincing even in the least.  Law men, especially sheriff's, know how to draw their guns and bring more than six bullets with them when they leave the office.  The interaction between Lawrence and Alexander borders on the ridiculous that culminates in a bizarre sequence where Lawrence requests Alexander to do something, she does it, she messes up, he scolds her, and she does it right.  The sequence was completely baffling and completely ruins any mood that was developed at that point.  I turned to my wife and we both said that same thing, wow was that dumb.I respect what Shiban is trying to do here.

Wow, you'd guess you'd be in for a whole gorefest here, but no.A couple who apparently haven't mastered the art of polite conversation and swear at each other every two seconds are on a road trip to start their lives over. You can see from the beginning scenes that this Nicole is pretty, but she isn't very bright. Even her boyfriend knows that, as you see him telling her that you don't ring up your parents to tell them you've run away.Jesse is kidnapped. Nicole forms a plan. To stay as long as she can in the one place she shouldn't be. She practically throws herself at the murderers by returning to the seemingly abandoned toilet where she makes some lifelong friends who of course are helpless when in her hands (because she is hopeless), hitchhiking with psychotic strangers, dragging another man into the violence and in turn injuring him because of her stupidity (turning their backs when they know full well the killer truck is still behind them; they had it coming). Another individual who believes that by simply sticking something underneath a door, she is safe and just because nobody seems to be hanging around outside that door, that there is no-one. Well her fingers suffer in the name of this ridiculous belief. ""Leave me alone! Let go of me! Let us go!"" she screams helplessly and dumbly. Now, why would a psychotic killer let you go, huh?Not too much gore here if that's what you're looking for.Recommended for fans of: 'The Hitcher' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' series. A lot of similarities and cliches.This movie won't leave you fulfilled, but won't leave you empty either. Worth a rent. But be prepared to scream your head off at the stupidity of Nicole.

1009100,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000H2M2RA,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Rest Stop is a pretty good horror movie.  Honestly, it was a LOT better than the negative reviews here on amazon led me to believe.  I was expecting a total disappointment but got a pretty decent horror film instead.It's about... well, let me explain what happens in the beginning first.  We find out that a young mans brother is missing (along with his brunette girlfriend) somewhere in a small town in the middle of nowhere, so the young man -and his extremely hot blonde-haired girlfriend- go on a search to find out where he might have gone.Tagging along is an annoying friend that went to high school with the two of them.  He's the typical goofball idiot that lets out an insult whenever he sees fit.  You know, the type of person most of us have dealt with or possibly dealing with now!  Most of us don't like these type of people, haha.Soon we witness that there's a maniac in a truck that goes around attempting to run over people who he believes are sinners.  This takes us to some fairly interesting segments and furthermore takes up a good portion of the storytelling in the beginning.Anyway, one aspect that I found really cool about Rest Stop is how it tried to implement two very different styles of horror.  You have the crazy man attacking people type and you have the psychological horror type that makes you think about the paranormal and spiritual side of the spectrum.To be fair, combining the two styles wasn't exactly a smooth transition.  I mean, the plot is obviously severely flawed and undeveloped, but it's a noble attempt on the movie writers to give us something more than your typical ""maniac slicing up and running over innocent people"" routine that we've seen a thousand times already.To give one example, the blonde-haired girlfriend walks into a bathroom and sees a woman sitting in the stall and crying, however the woman immediately disappears the moment she kicks the door open, and when the blonde girlfriend comes back to the bathroom later the entire room is completely different, deserted and rundown which is *nothing* she experienced when she first walked in there.  To me, this kind of setting provided a really good atmosphere.It's soon discovered that the young man, his girlfriend, and the goofy guy are seeing apparitions of the missing brother and his girlfriend.  This inevitably leads to some interesting (and psychologically terrifying and nightmare-like) segments involving the two missing people actually returning under mysterious conditions and making those searching for them believe that they actually found the missing couple, when in fact that's not what's happening at all.There's a crucial aspect to the storyline involving having peoples eyeballs ripped out of their heads and the reason behind it, but I can't reveal the reason without spoiling the movie.  It's a semi-interesting aspect of the storyline, however.Oh and the ending?  It's fantastic.  It's a nice twist.  Nothing extraordinary or revolutionary or anything like that- just an unexpected turn of events.Overall, the acting is pretty good, the storyline is fairly elaborate (of course it's nothing that Silent Hill for example hasn't done much better) and the fear and gross factor is pretty high.  I recommend it.",4,no rest for the weary,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,3242,"['Rest', 'Stop', 'pretty', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'Honestly', 'was', 'LOT', 'better', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'expecting', 'total', 'disappointment', 'got', 'pretty', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'instead.It', 'well', 'let', 'explain', 'what', 'beginning', 'first', 'find', 'out', 'young', 'mans', 'brother', 'missing', 'brunette', 'girlfriend', 'somewhere', 'small', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'young', 'man', '-and', 'extremely', 'hot', 'blonde-haired', 'girlfriend-', 'go', 'search', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'gone.Tagging', 'along', 'annoying', 'friend', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'two', 'typical', 'goofball', 'idiot', 'out', 'insult', 'whenever', 'fit', 'know', 'type', 'person', 'most', 'have', 'dealt', 'possibly', 'dealing', 'now', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'type', 'people', 'haha.Soon', 'witness', 'maniac', 'truck', 'around', 'attempting', 'run', 'over', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'sinners', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'segments', 'furthermore', 'up', 'good', 'portion', 'storytelling', 'beginning.Anyway', 'one', 'aspect', 'found', 'really', 'cool', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'how', 'tried', 'implement', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'styles', 'horror', 'have', 'crazy', 'man', 'attacking', 'people', 'type', 'have', 'psychological', 'horror', 'type', 'think', 'paranormal', 'spiritual', 'side', 'spectrum.To', 'be', 'fair', 'combining', 'two', 'styles', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'smooth', 'transition', 'mean', 'plot', 'obviously', 'severely', 'flawed', 'undeveloped', 'noble', 'attempt', 'movie', 'writers', 'give', 'something', 'more', 'typical', 'maniac', 'slicing', 'up', 'running', 'over', 'innocent', 'people', 'routine', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'already.To', 'give', 'one', 'example', 'blonde-haired', 'girlfriend', 'walks', 'bathroom', 'woman', 'sitting', 'stall', 'crying', 'however', 'woman', 'immediately', 'moment', 'door', 'open', 'when', 'blonde', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'bathroom', 'later', 'entire', 'room', 'completely', 'different', 'deserted', 'rundown', 'experienced', 'when', 'first', 'walked', 'there', 'kind', 'setting', 'provided', 'really', 'good', 'atmosphere.It', 'soon', 'discovered', 'young', 'man', 'girlfriend', 'goofy', 'guy', 'are', 'seeing', 'apparitions', 'missing', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'inevitably', 'interesting', 'psychologically', 'terrifying', 'nightmare-like', 'segments', 'involving', 'two', 'missing', 'people', 'actually', 'returning', 'mysterious', 'conditions', 'making', 'searching', 'believe', 'actually', 'found', 'missing', 'couple', 'when', 'fact', 'not', 'what', 'happening', 'crucial', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'involving', 'having', 'peoples', 'eyeballs', 'ripped', 'heads', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'reason', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'semi-interesting', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'however.Oh', 'ending', 'fantastic', 'nice', 'twist', 'Nothing', 'extraordinary', 'revolutionary', 'anything', 'that-', 'just', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'events.Overall', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'elaborate', 'course', 'nothing', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'example', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'better', 'fear', 'gross', 'factor', 'pretty', 'high', 'recommend']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

Add oceans of gore and meaningless filler scenes, straight out of every other horror movie, and you've got the perfect combination for a night of terror and frustration.First off, the gore was top notch (I looked away at least once or twice, if not several times), but it seemed like this movie wanted to be more than what it was. At its's heart, I believe it wanted to be a psycho killer movie, but every now and again a supernatural element would rear its unwanted head (one minute the characters there, the next minute he/or she is gone with no explanation). As a result I found myself asking more questions as the story progressed.Q: What did the killer look like?- You never get to fully see him.Q: Does he have some sort of supernatural power?- One minute he's not there, and the next he is.- Same for his victims; are they ghosts, or did our heroine just forget to take her medication that morning?Q: Is peeing outside really that bad?- The heroine makes her boyfriend take her to a rest stop to pee, instead of doing her lower business in the bushes.- And she actually uses said bathroom, despite the fact that its easily the most disgusting place this side of Freddy Kruegers colon.Q: Who thought this soundtrack would be ideal for a horror movie?- I mean its possibly the worst ever.- Definitely borrowed from a sappy teen romance flick.Q: Why would she keep running back to that bathroom for cover?- Its filthy, possibly haunted, and she knows Mr. Mentally Unbalanced  comes back every 15 minutes to check on her.Q: What was the point of the ride she took with Leatherfaces family?- They picked her up, didn't listen to a word she said, called her a whore about 30 times, then after she burst into the back room where they were keeping the mutant family photographer, they dropped her off exactly where they picked her up.Q: Why was Joey Lawrence killed off without saying ""Whoa"" at least once?- When he's not saying ""Whoa"" he's a terrible actor.Q: Isn't the Heroine of a horror movie supposed to be likeable?- She's strong, she's weak, she's a terrible actress, and she's annoyingQ: If you were being hounded by an psychotic, inbred maniac, why would you take the time to chronicle it on the bathroom stall?- Apparently all his victims are doing it.Q: Was the sheriff and the manson family in on it?- They all had one common saying; ""You'll get what you deserve.""- Aside from that, the sheriffs office had the sex tape, the two main  characters made, playing on the T.V- The Mutant Candid Cameraman, at least from what I observed, was the one taking pictures of the victims for the ""Missing Persons"" posters- Were they in on it' or were they just pointless distractionsAll in all I would've liked to have seen more of the torturous activities taking place on the abandoned school bus, and alot less of the same old bathroom.

1009108,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000H2M2RA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","For this horror fan's money, Rest Stop is a gritty, gory thrill ride well worth watching.  Yes, the story has some problems, but I really don't understand all the vitriol directed toward this juicy little film.  You have to respect a killer who has honed his craft to such an exquisite degree as the Rest Stop killer; this guy has psychological and physical torture down to a freaking science, savoring every minute of the heroine's extended ordeal.  He repeatedly leaves the scene entirely, confident that his prey remains under his complete control in each of his absences.  Admittedly, the fact that our poor dumb heroine isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer helps, but I still have to give major kudos to our bad guy.  I don't think I've ever characterized a killer as having panache, but this guy has it in spades.  I don't care how unoriginal and sometimes clich&eacute;d the movie was, I quite enjoyed it.  Still, the critics have some valid points.  The addition of a certain family into the story was an embarrassingly bad decision that comes across as shameless pandering, while certain potentially confusing elements in the plot will be decried as serious plot holes by some - although I think their inclusion and lack of a definitive explanation actually add an effective depth to the story.  Those who expect their horror movies to wrap everything up with a Scooby Doo ending won't like it, but I see no reason why a horror film can't leave you pondering over a few unanswered questions.The basic storyline is pretty simple.  Young Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander) runs off to California with her boyfriend Jess (Joey Mendicino) - but they never make it.  At some point along the way, Nicole's need to relieve herself lands them both at the world's nastiest and most remote rest stop.  Showing great fortitude, Nicole actually manages to do her business inside, but there is no Jess and no car waiting for her when she comes back out.  As the hours and minutes pass, her wonder and bafflement at Jess turn into deep concern, and then her worst fears seem to be confirmed by the menacing presence of a mysterious man in an old yellow truck - the same man and truck referenced on a number of ominous graffiti posts (going back a number of years) on the bathroom stalls.  Nicole's night takes on a number of macabre, borderline insane twists and turns, but the one overwhelming constant is the killer's murderously calculated intent to torment this poor girl.At one point, Nicole does interact with the world's weirdest family inside an RV, and the movie suffers greatly for the inclusion of this scene.  It's patently ridiculous and really disrupts the tension and suspense the movie has the built up until that point.  It's most unfortunate because Nicole's interaction with a couple of other characters during her ordeal plays so well.  I have to take a moment here and praise Joey Lawrence for his performance; I never knew he could act, but I thought he was great in this movie.  It also behooves me to say a few words about the DVD extras.  In general, it is never a good thing for a movie to come with alternate endings, let alone three of them, because their presence on the DVD necessarily conveys the impression that the director was never quite sure how to end the movie.  We can at least take comfort in the fact that he chose the best of the available endings for the film itself, as none of the three alternate endings works well at all, in my opinion.  Personally, I would not have included them on the DVD.  Other extras include a slideshow of ""crime scene"" shots as well as a home movie made by a member of the RV family.  Apparently, this little film may have a bearing on some of the film's open questions, but it's really more stupid than anything else.In the end, we do have a flawed, unoriginal, clich&eacute;d movie - yet I think it works surprisingly well despite these handicaps.  Obviously, a significant number of viewers disagree with me on this.  I would just ask you not to dismiss this film out of hand because of all the negative reviews.  While you've no doubt seen this type of storyline play out before in other horror movies, Rest Stop does succeed in invoking an atmosphere all its own.  It's not scary, but I certainly had a good time watching it.",4,Gotta love and respect the killer in this one,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,4305,"['horror', 'fan', 'money', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'gritty', 'gory', 'thrill', 'ride', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Yes', 'story', 'problems', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'vitriol', 'directed', 'juicy', 'little', 'film', 'have', 'respect', 'killer', 'who', 'honed', 'craft', 'exquisite', 'degree', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'killer', 'guy', 'psychological', 'physical', 'torture', 'down', 'freaking', 'science', 'savoring', 'minute', 'heroine', 'extended', 'ordeal', 'repeatedly', 'scene', 'entirely', 'confident', 'prey', 'complete', 'control', 'absences', 'Admittedly', 'fact', 'poor', 'dumb', 'heroine', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sharpest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'still', 'have', 'give', 'major', 'kudos', 'bad', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'characterized', 'killer', 'having', 'panache', 'guy', 'spades', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'unoriginal', 'sometimes', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'Still', 'critics', 'have', 'valid', 'points', 'addition', 'certain', 'family', 'story', 'was', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'decision', 'shameless', 'pandering', 'certain', 'potentially', 'confusing', 'elements', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'decried', 'serious', 'plot', 'holes', 'think', 'inclusion', 'lack', 'definitive', 'explanation', 'actually', 'add', 'effective', 'depth', 'story', 'who', 'expect', 'horror', 'movies', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'horror', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'pondering', 'few', 'unanswered', 'questions.The', 'basic', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Young', 'Nicole', 'Carrow', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'California', 'boyfriend', 'Jess', 'Joey', 'Mendicino', 'never', 'make', 'point', 'way', 'Nicole', 'need', 'relieve', 'world', 'nastiest', 'most', 'remote', 'rest', 'stop', 'Showing', 'great', 'fortitude', 'Nicole', 'actually', 'do', 'business', 'inside', 'Jess', 'car', 'waiting', 'when', 'back', 'out', 'hours', 'minutes', 'pass', 'wonder', 'bafflement', 'Jess', 'turn', 'deep', 'concern', 'then', 'worst', 'fears', 'seem', 'be', 'confirmed', 'menacing', 'presence', 'mysterious', 'man', 'old', 'yellow', 'truck', 'same', 'man', 'truck', 'referenced', 'number', 'ominous', 'graffiti', 'posts', 'going', 'back', 'number', 'years', 'bathroom', 'stalls', 'Nicole', 'night', 'number', 'macabre', 'borderline', 'insane', 'twists', 'turns', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'constant', 'killer', 'murderously', 'calculated', 'intent', 'torment', 'poor', 'girl.At', 'one', 'point', 'Nicole', 'interact', 'world', 'weirdest', 'family', 'RV', 'movie', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'inclusion', 'scene', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'really', 'disrupts', 'tension', 'suspense', 'movie', 'built', 'up', 'point', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'Nicole', 'interaction', 'couple', 'other', 'characters', 'ordeal', 'plays', 'so', 'well', 'have', 'take', 'moment', 'here', 'praise', 'Joey', 'Lawrence', 'performance', 'never', 'knew', 'could', 'act', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'also', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'DVD', 'extras', 'general', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'come', 'alternate', 'endings', 'let', 'alone', 'three', 'presence', 'DVD', 'necessarily', 'impression', 'director', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'end', 'movie', 'can', 'least', 'take', 'comfort', 'fact', 'chose', 'best', 'available', 'endings', 'film', 'none', 'three', 'alternate', 'endings', 'well', 'opinion', 'Personally', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'included', 'DVD', 'Other', 'extras', 'include', 'slideshow', 'crime', 'scene', 'shots', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'movie', 'made', 'member', 'RV', 'family', 'Apparently', 'little', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'bearing', 'film', 'open', 'questions', 'really', 'more', 'stupid', 'anything', 'end', 'do', 'have', 'flawed', 'unoriginal', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'yet', 'think', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'handicaps', 'Obviously', 'significant', 'number', 'viewers', 'disagree', 'would', 'just', 'ask', 'not', 'dismiss', 'film', 'hand', 'negative', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'seen', 'type', 'storyline', 'play', 'out', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'succeed', 'invoking', 'atmosphere', 'own', 'not', 'scary', 'certainly', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

Somewhere along the line a supernatural element gets thrown in as well...it doesn't add to the movie, but becomes more of a distraction. I kept wondering what is the purpose, are these ghosts, is the girl insane? You will never know the answer, so don't bother. It's just another element added by a writer/director who is just throwing all kinds of ideas into his film to see what sticks...most of which doesn't.All of this would be fine if we have a great sadistic anti-hero to root for, like Freddy or Jason.

Unfortunately this film did not live up to that expectation, maybe it is my fault for believing the hype. This film turned out to be just ok which is a disappointment, but it does still have some good qualities about it. I think if I would have gone into this with out expectations it might have been a little better, who am I kidding it would have been the same. Reason being is that with or with out the expectations the lead actress would still have annoyed me, so maybe I would have felt the same way.The story is all about a young couple just getting away from every thing in life and trying start a new one, guess they get more then they wanted.  The film picks up nicely once they get to the [you guessed it] rest stop and one of them goes missing, the girlfriend is left to fend for her self as a killer plays with her the whole night. The film at this point goes from a serial killer flick into a ghost film into a torture film and back again, it makes more sense [maybe not] when you watch it. That is basically the story, how long can she take being played by this guy out to kill her like he did her man.Jaimie Alexander stars in this film and man I wish she did not, her performance is absolutely annoying, at least to me. The thing that annoys me the most is that I know she can do much better and you can tell while watching this that the potential was there. She ends up failing in this film though with a very shaky and down right annoying performance, I just don't believe her in this role. She is absolutely out shined by every other person on this flick. Deanna Russo plays her part masterfully and really should have been the lead in this film, her performance is hauntingly good and very creepy. Joey Mendicino as Jaimie's boyfriend does a good job for the time that he is on screen, and all the actors that played the creepy RV family are brilliant. Another great and very believable performance comes from Joseph Lawrence as the police officer who gets trapped with Jaimie's character. If it were not for those individuals this film would have been really hurt by the lead actress.Writer/Director John Shiban obviously was trying to make a good movie and you can tell he really put is all into this, every thing is fine on his end. The writing for this film was good especially for this type of film and the direction and pacing was good as well, I think that the creepiness of the bathroom scenes though is what makes this film stand out above a bad lead. There are some good gory scenes as well and the RV family provides one of the best parts of the film. There are some things that don't make any sense but you can check that out for your self.It is up to you to judge this film how you see fit but personally I say that the lead actress almost ruins the entire movie.

1009119,AY12DBB0U420B,B000H2M2RA,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I like to travel by car and in the last six decades I've traveled practically every major highway from the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains and from the Mexican to the Canadian border. In addition, I've been on a lot of minor roadways and my preferred sleeping arrangement has been camping. All has gone well, and I've had no problems. However, a small percentage of stopping places can be creepy and populated by creepy people. I've had any number of rest stops where I've felt high anxiety and could hardly wait to get away. I suppose this is a common feeling with many auto travelers and is not limited to rest stops but might also include motels and eating places.My late night bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Rest Stop,"" a movie which built upon this common traveling anxiety and magnified it to really extreme proportions. Most people didn't like the movie, as evidenced by the Amazon rankings, and I can clearly understand why. I'd say the movie is badly flawed in the latter third but is actually a rather good movie, if you can stand to watch it. ""Rest Stop"" is centered about a young couple who stopped at a roadside rest stop on an obscure California highway only to have their traveling turned into the worst nightmare ever imagined, The rest stop is unattended, the only people there are a really, really creepy family in a motor home, and the couple is harassed and stalked by a madman in an aging pickup truck. Ultimately, the stalker managed to separate the couple. He tortured and ultimately killed the man. He then turned his attention to the woman. What followed is the worst type of terror and torture you might imagine, including the death of a policeman who inadvertently stopped and became prey to the same mad stalker. Be ready for a bloody, gory and gut-wrenching experience dragged out through the last third of the movie. In fact, the violence and horror escalated until I wondered how the movie producers could ever de-escalate it to provide a suitable ending. Well, evidently, this was a problem. The ending was very poorly done and the entire last third of the movie could use extensive re-writing.  The extra features on the DVD offers three other possible endings, none of which seem satisfactory to me.The movie was actually rather well done. The acting was excellent. You really felt the horror of the situation as it unfolded. I think the movie was overdone in that the violence became simply overwhelming and difficult to watch. All right, it's just acting and just a movie, but you might stop and think a while when you go go into your next roadside rest stop for a break.Gary Peterson",3,"A Tale of Violence And Horror, Flawed By The Ending.",1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,2630,"['like', 'travel', 'car', 'last', 'six', 'decades', ""'ve"", 'traveled', 'practically', 'major', 'highway', 'Pacific', 'Coast', 'Great', 'Plains', 'Mexican', 'Canadian', 'border', 'addition', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'minor', 'roadways', 'preferred', 'sleeping', 'arrangement', 'been', 'camping', 'gone', 'well', ""'ve"", 'had', 'problems', 'However', 'small', 'percentage', 'stopping', 'places', 'can', 'be', 'creepy', 'populated', 'creepy', 'people', ""'ve"", 'had', 'number', 'rest', 'stops', 'where', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'high', 'anxiety', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'get', 'away', 'suppose', 'common', 'feeling', 'many', 'auto', 'travelers', 'not', 'limited', 'rest', 'stops', 'might', 'also', 'include', 'motels', 'eating', 'places.My', 'late', 'night', 'bargain-rack', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'movie', 'common', 'traveling', 'anxiety', 'magnified', 'really', 'extreme', 'proportions', 'Most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'evidenced', 'Amazon', 'rankings', 'can', 'clearly', 'understand', 'why', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'badly', 'flawed', 'latter', 'third', 'actually', 'rather', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'watch', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'centered', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'stopped', 'roadside', 'rest', 'stop', 'obscure', 'California', 'highway', 'only', 'have', 'traveling', 'turned', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'ever', 'imagined', 'rest', 'stop', 'unattended', 'only', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'creepy', 'family', 'motor', 'home', 'couple', 'harassed', 'stalked', 'madman', 'aging', 'pickup', 'truck', 'Ultimately', 'stalker', 'managed', 'separate', 'couple', 'tortured', 'ultimately', 'killed', 'man', 'then', 'turned', 'attention', 'woman', 'What', 'followed', 'worst', 'type', 'terror', 'torture', 'might', 'imagine', 'including', 'death', 'policeman', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'stopped', 'became', 'prey', 'same', 'mad', 'stalker', 'Be', 'ready', 'bloody', 'gory', 'gut-wrenching', 'experience', 'dragged', 'out', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'fact', 'violence', 'horror', 'escalated', 'wondered', 'how', 'movie', 'producers', 'could', 'ever', 'de-escalate', 'provide', 'suitable', 'ending', 'Well', 'evidently', 'was', 'problem', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'entire', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'could', 'use', 'extensive', 're-writing', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'offers', 'three', 'other', 'possible', 'endings', 'none', 'seem', 'satisfactory', 'me.The', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'really', 'felt', 'horror', 'situation', 'unfolded', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'overdone', 'violence', 'became', 'simply', 'overwhelming', 'difficult', 'watch', 'right', 'just', 'acting', 'just', 'movie', 'might', 'stop', 'think', 'while', 'when', 'go', 'go', 'next', 'roadside', 'rest', 'stop', 'break.Gary', 'Peterson']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

It starts out promising with a dumb woman in a rest stop getting terrorized by an unseen stalker and then it landslides downhill from there. None of the acting is really that good but if I had to pick the person who did alright it would be Jaimie Alexander, the protagonist. Of course, as expected with any truly bad horror film, her character is as dumb as the cardboard box she was crafted from. Everyone else, including the all but lost Joey Lawrence, are damn near pathetic. The gore is ok in this film... although a little over the top in some points.

I wish that were still the case. It's one of those classic cases where Halloween time sparks the release of horrible (not horror) movies.There are two things that stand out to me:1) It's totally implausible and2) Does she ever stop crying and whining ?The things that happen in this movie, and there is not a lot happening, just don't make sense. They get to the rest stop and the guy disappears, we don't know why. Though if I knew how emotional that actress would become, I would have left too. The cop / park ranger guy is an insult to the police force. Even to the guys from Police Academy. Oh yeah, and after she blows his brains out, um, twice, he just simply disappears. ""Oh you missed, shot me again !"" Yea.Moments like this are happening throughout the film. She is sitting in this nasty bathroom, contemplating on what to do, while she could quite easily be skipping down the highway. Better hitch a ride with the demented creep family, with two weird Jewish boys and a deformed Mini-Me. Huh ? Excactly. Oh wait, the boyfriend is back, and still alive, but without a tongue. That will definitely hurt their relationship.I wish somebody would have cut out HER tongue. Because all she is doing for 90% of the film, is crying. I assume the actress was following the directors pointers to look frightened and distressed. But somebody should have told her that whining, whimpering and crying for 90 minutes of screen-time is rather annoying. Even if somebody bites off your finger.Writing anything more would give this film too much attention. Like most of the others have written before me: Stay away.

1009125,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000H2M2RA,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 3]","Ostensibly, ""Rest Stop"", at least from its DVD cover, looks terrific.  Indeed, I would even argue that this is a great idea for a horror movie, but it seems as if the creators of this movie did not know what to do with the movie once they came up with the original idea.  I agree with many of the reviewers that the acting in this movie is subpar and even downright horrible to say the least and the ""heroine"" is an unbelievably poor choice for an actress...her acting is atrocious.  She is very unlikeable and impossible to sympathize with.  Her boyfriend is just as bad, and perhaps even worse than she is.That being said, the plot starts off promisingly enough.  Basically, this girl is having trouble at home and wants to run off with her boyfriend.  Well, they end up going to this rest stop where the boyfriend disappears and the girl is tormented by a maniacal killer who drives an old pickup truck.  Sounds good, right?  Well, the idea is good, but the execution is terrible.  The score to this movie is absolutely horrible, and the movie does tend to focus too much on the bathroom itself.  Especially painful to me was the elongated and boring scenes with that injured police officer in the bathroom...frankly, I just found that to be unbearably boring after awhile.  The killer keeps coming back to the restroom to terrorize her where the ""heroine"" (that's a laugh) is located.Also, the movie seems to be unsure about what it wants to be.  The movie plays with the idea and appears to fall down on the idea of having a supernatural element to it.  However, this convoludes the plot, and makes it tedious and frustrating for the viewer in his/her understanding of the movie.  Also, I believe that the movie contains too much meaningless dialogue between our ""heroine"" and a couple of (at least what appears to be anyway) ghosts, one being the aforementioned police officer.However, where the movie really fails is with the acting which is absolutely atrocious and too much of the movie takes place in the bathroom itself, and there is not enough action.  The elongated scenes of meaningless dialogue do not endear the viewer to the movie.  The fact that the viewer never sees the killer is immaterial to how good the movie is.  The bottom line with ""Rest Stop"" is that it is a good idea for a  horror movie with poor execution and suffering from a lack of imagination and creativity on the part of the screenplay writer(s).  The atrocious acting only magnifies these flaws...the ""heroine"" is absolutely pathetic in her role and is just impossible to sympathize with, not to mention how inept an actress she is.  ""Rest Stop"" gets around two (2) stars only because of the great idea that it brings to the table, but quite frankly, the movie as a whole does NOT deserve two (2) stars.  ""Rest Stop"" is a somewhat entertaining movie, but it drags out with some meaningless and boring content.  Ultimately, ""Rest Stop"" starts out well with a great idea for a horror movie, but it fails to sustain its early success and develop on its original merit...unfortunately, you see this a lot with the horror movies coming out these days.",2,"1.75 STARS: Great idea, poor execution.",1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,3134,"['Ostensibly', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'least', 'DVD', 'cover', 'terrific', 'Indeed', 'would', 'even', 'argue', 'great', 'idea', 'horror', 'movie', 'creators', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'movie', 'came', 'up', 'original', 'idea', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'acting', 'movie', 'subpar', 'even', 'downright', 'horrible', 'say', 'least', 'heroine', 'unbelievably', 'poor', 'choice', 'actress', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'impossible', 'sympathize', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'bad', 'perhaps', 'even', 'worse', 'being', 'said', 'plot', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'Basically', 'girl', 'having', 'trouble', 'home', 'run', 'off', 'boyfriend', 'Well', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'rest', 'stop', 'where', 'boyfriend', 'girl', 'tormented', 'maniacal', 'killer', 'who', 'old', 'pickup', 'truck', 'good', 'right', 'Well', 'idea', 'good', 'execution', 'terrible', 'score', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'movie', 'tend', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'bathroom', 'Especially', 'painful', 'was', 'elongated', 'boring', 'scenes', 'injured', 'police', 'officer', 'bathroom', 'frankly', 'just', 'found', 'be', 'unbearably', 'boring', 'awhile', 'killer', 'coming', 'back', 'restroom', 'terrorize', 'where', 'heroine', 'laugh', 'located.Also', 'movie', 'be', 'unsure', 'what', 'be', 'movie', 'idea', 'fall', 'down', 'idea', 'having', 'supernatural', 'element', 'However', 'plot', 'tedious', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'his/her', 'understanding', 'movie', 'Also', 'believe', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'meaningless', 'dialogue', 'heroine', 'couple', 'least', 'what', 'be', 'anyway', 'ghosts', 'one', 'being', 'aforementioned', 'police', 'officer.However', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'place', 'bathroom', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'elongated', 'scenes', 'meaningless', 'dialogue', 'do', 'not', 'endear', 'viewer', 'movie', 'fact', 'viewer', 'never', 'killer', 'immaterial', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'bottom', 'line', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'good', 'idea', 'horror', 'movie', 'poor', 'execution', 'suffering', 'lack', 'imagination', 'creativity', 'part', 'screenplay', 'writer', 's', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'only', 'flaws', 'heroine', 'absolutely', 'pathetic', 'role', 'just', 'impossible', 'sympathize', 'not', 'mention', 'how', 'inept', 'actress', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'around', 'two', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'great', 'idea', 'table', 'quite', 'frankly', 'movie', 'whole', 'NOT', 'deserve', 'two', '2', 'stars', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'out', 'meaningless', 'boring', 'content', 'Ultimately', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'out', 'well', 'great', 'idea', 'horror', 'movie', 'sustain', 'early', 'success', 'develop', 'original', 'merit', 'unfortunately', 'see', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'coming', 'days']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

In this case, I felt neither.  It's hard to be sympathetic towards people who are genuinely stupid. I'll explain. The girl in this film is being hunted by a deranged killer in a commercial pick-up truck. He steals her boyfriend away to take him to his gruesome and torturous demise. Once she realizes he is missing, she sticks around (all alone) in a deserted rest stop to get drunk on a bottle of whiskey that she discovers in a police officers desk. She calls for help and when a police officer arrives it turns out to be Joey Lawrence! Wough!! The killer runs over Joey and his death scene is acually quite comical. I can only hope the director was playing it for laughs because it is like something out of Monty Python. Joey is laying on a floor and he begs the girl to shoot him in the head to relieve him of his agonizing misery. She reluctantly agrees and sticks the pistol in his wide open flapper. She pulls the trigger and the next shot is Joey Lawrence laying on the ground with half his brains splattered on the floor telling her ""You missed!, do it again"" at that point I was waiting for John Cleese and Eric Idle to walk out and go into ""The Lumberjack Song.""This movie would be best viewed at Thanksgiving because it is one Freakin Big Turkey!!!!!",1,"Should be re-titled ""Press Stop.""",1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,1395,"['One', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'horror', 'film', 'audience', 'identify', 'care', 'potential', 'victim', 'case', 'felt', 'hard', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'genuinely', 'stupid', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'girl', 'film', 'being', 'hunted', 'deranged', 'killer', 'commercial', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'boyfriend', 'away', 'take', 'gruesome', 'torturous', 'demise', 'missing', 'alone', 'deserted', 'rest', 'stop', 'get', 'drunk', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'police', 'officers', 'desk', 'help', 'when', 'police', 'officer', 'out', 'be', 'Joey', 'Lawrence', 'killer', 'Joey', 'death', 'scene', 'acually', 'quite', 'comical', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'director', 'was', 'playing', 'something', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Joey', 'laying', 'floor', 'girl', 'shoot', 'head', 'relieve', 'agonizing', 'misery', 'reluctantly', 'pistol', 'wide', 'open', 'flapper', 'trigger', 'next', 'shot', 'Joey', 'Lawrence', 'laying', 'ground', 'brains', 'splattered', 'floor', 'telling', 'missed', 'do', 'again', 'point', 'was', 'waiting', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'walk', 'out', 'go', 'Lumberjack', 'Song', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'viewed', 'Thanksgiving', 'one', 'Freakin', 'Big', 'Turkey']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

If, however, you want to make fun of a ridiculous horror movie, continue reading.Rest Stop starts off with a cheesy montage reminiscent of a 70s movie; there's a senseless killing, a creepy truck, bad home video footage, and an EXTREME NIPPLE CLOSEUP.  After that it gets funnier.Two kids, who probably have ADHD, or at the very least are a product of inbreeding, runaway from home to become big stars in Hollywood.  Fat chance!  When the boy looks like Damone from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", and the girl acts like Leo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" - and she's not supposed to be retarded - then you know they'll just end up as street vendors or fluffers in another kind of movie.  It's better that they meet someone to put them out of their misery.On their way to California, in the only bit of realism in the entire movie, the girl has to go to the bathroom (#1).  Sure enough, they stop at the rest stop from hell.  Shortly thereafter, she's dropping trou' at the foulest toilet in the history of mankind; the only thing it was missing was a fecal mural.After conducting business (#1), she leaves the restroom to find her boyfriend missing.  At first I thought it was because he was tired of her horrible acting, and he just decided to go it alone in Hollywood.  I was wrong, and soon the girl starts to get terrorized by a guy who has watched a collection of horror movies prior to visiting the rest stop.  He watched ""Joy Ride"" to learn how to use a CB, ""Hostel"" to learn how to torture, ""Sixth Sense"" to cause the conjuring of ghosts, ""Texas Chainsaw"" to deal with an RV of freaks (although he could have just watched RV with Robin Williams).The rest of the movie unfolds as anticipated, replete with gimps, freaks, pointless gore, religious nuts, idiotic dialogue, unrealistic amounts of blood, senseless destruction, incoherent crying, and a Joey Lawrence cameo as the most incompetent cop since the father in ""The Hills Have Eyes"".  Thankfully, Joey portrays the black guy in this movie, and he dies quickly and stupidly.Does the girl get chased?  Yes.Does the girl fall down?

The acting in this movie is almost as bad as the acting in Blood Rayne (2005); I still can't believe how bad the acting was/is/always will be. Jaimie Alexander (Nicole) must have paid someone off to land her role in this film as her acting talent is terrible, at least in this movie. I can see that Jaimie tried her hardest in the film as she and her boyfriend decide to run away to the bright lights and the big city. As you can imagine they stop on the way only to be confronted by a guy in a yellow truck who proceeds do all sorts of nastiness to them. Rolling along to the ""Rest Stop"" let see  what does it offer?Serial killer, who doesn't show much and doesn't say a word, Wow, irrational evil always gives me additional creeps. - Yes, I'm buying it. Playing cat and mouse games with victims giving them false hopes? Sounds well, if it's a serial killer of such type he should like the process rather than the result. Oh, yes, put this in my basket too. Atmosphere of inevitability? Yes, fine. Where the hell is cashier...?What didn't work? Idea with ghosts in fact was nice, puzzling, but generally pointless. Fun with a family in the van was also nice, but misplaced as well, although it didn't spoil anything. Camera - very decent, soundtrack - fine. Gore? It's not gore-centric. Acting again questionable, but quite enough to run the movie. The only thing I can't forgive is that pathetic scene with family photo - too long, too fake.To sum up - not top-rank solid thriller definitely worth it's run time, and delivering right to it's promise. The DVD special features is sort of a treat. Deserving extra marks for the sense of proportion and some good ideas inside. Also, check out the alternative endings. I thought the original ending was horrible. The other endings were only hilarious. A deformed midget with a camcorder takes up about 10 minutes of special feature time and that's about it.

Reading through a lot of reviews these days, one gets the feeling that a lot of people seem to enjoy rubishing films just for the sake of it. Well i dont. I dont wright reviews on films that i dont like, to many people are doing that already. Rest stop is a film that i did like, yes its not perfect, but i have yet too see many films that are, but this film will appeal to true horror fans, not for its original plot nor for its great acting (though the acting isnt bad at all), but for the fact that it pushes the horror level a few notches up, from the boring teeny horror that never stops coming in the wake of scream. Where i live in australia there are no more drive ins left due to to large companies buying them out and trying to play major studio films on them. As a result the direct to dvd film has replaced the drive in so i see these films in a difrent way, i see them as the modern drive in flick. Look through films  that came out in the 60s, 70, 80s, and played at the drive ins, blood fest, evil dead, zombie, etc. see how fondly they are remembered today. In time people will be going back to films like Rest stop and releasing them as long lost classic horror. I can say that i saw evil dead at the drive ins in 1982 and cheered it as a horror classic will you be able to say,in 25 years from now. I saw Rest stop when it was first released on dvd, and recognised it as a future horror classic, judging from peoples comments here i dout it. anyway if you are a true horror fan dont be put off, give this film a go its a lot better then they say",5,Rest stop: bad rep good movie,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,1576,"['dont', 'know', 'Reading', 'lot', 'reviews', 'days', 'one', 'feeling', 'lot', 'people', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'rubishing', 'films', 'just', 'sake', 'Well', 'i', 'dont', 'dont', 'wright', 'reviews', 'films', 'i', 'dont', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'doing', 'already', 'Rest', 'stop', 'film', 'i', 'did', 'yes', 'not', 'perfect', 'i', 'have', 'yet', 'too', 'see', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'true', 'horror', 'fans', 'not', 'original', 'plot', 'great', 'acting', 'acting', 'isnt', 'bad', 'fact', 'horror', 'level', 'few', 'notches', 'up', 'boring', 'teeny', 'horror', 'never', 'coming', 'wake', 'scream', 'Where', 'i', 'live', 'australia', 'are', 'more', 'drive', 'ins', 'left', 'due', 'large', 'companies', 'buying', 'out', 'trying', 'play', 'major', 'studio', 'films', 'result', 'direct', 'dvd', 'film', 'replaced', 'drive', 'so', 'i', 'see', 'films', 'difrent', 'way', 'i', 'see', 'modern', 'drive', 'flick', 'Look', 'films', 'came', 'out', '60s', '70', '80s', 'played', 'drive', 'ins', 'blood', 'fest', 'evil', 'dead', 'zombie', 'etc', 'see', 'how', 'fondly', 'are', 'remembered', 'today', 'time', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'back', 'films', 'Rest', 'stop', 'releasing', 'long', 'lost', 'classic', 'horror', 'can', 'say', 'i', 'saw', 'evil', 'dead', 'drive', 'ins', '1982', 'cheered', 'horror', 'classic', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'say', '25', 'years', 'now', 'saw', 'Rest', 'stop', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'dvd', 'recognised', 'future', 'horror', 'classic', 'judging', 'peoples', 'comments', 'here', 'i', 'dout', 'anyway', 'are', 'true', 'horror', 'fan', 'dont', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'give', 'film', 'go', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'say']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

To paraphrase Ed Harris in Glengarry Glen Ross ""Hey lets take all the latest overexposed trends in horror movies and put them in one film. Yeah no one has thought of that before"" The film starts with the couple that is hard to root for. He (Joey Medincio) is a jerk; she (Jaimie Alexander) is a spoiled daddy's girl. They drive from Texas to California and get lost. (It is one road called I-10, numbskulls) They stop to make love and I was having seventies horror film flashback as horrid soft-folk rock was playing in the background and soft filtered sunlight danced on their naked bodies.They eventually stop at a backwoods rest stop and the movie moves distinctly into science fiction territory. Ever since Seven, and more recently Saw, moviemakers have been trying to one up each other in creating the most disgusting room imaginable. The ladies restroom is one of those over the top places. The only thing missing is George Michael with his pants around his ankles. My lady friend watching the film with me expressed amazement that any woman would enter such a room let alone use the facilities. I am a guy and I wouldn't use them. A meth-addicted hooker would think twice about using the facilities. Needless to say, Jaimie Alexander's character loses all credibility when she plops herself down.Actually, Alexander's character loses credibility repeatedly in the film. As written she is one of the dumbest heroines ever seen in a movie. (My personal favorite sticking her fingers through the door at the killer, which he naturally bites off.) The rest of the film reads like a modern horror clich&eacute; checklist, redneck serial killer in Duel style truck (check); Crazy religious family with demented dwarf child (check); poorly lit torture room with stupid zooming camera effects (check); the killer tricks the heroine into killing an innocent (check); supernatural apparitions (um check); Joey Lawrence (uh yeah actually); endless conversations that slow movie to a crawl (check); and my personal favorite... ending that disregards everything that came before it in search of so called twist (bingo).Somewhat surprising that a movie with this much violence, nudity and horror clich&eacute;s can be so boring to watch.",2,Rest Stop...

Their plan?  Drive to Hollywood and seek gainful employment as Famous Movie Stars.  This one fact explains much that is wrong about the film.  Not only does it immediately make the characters hard to care about, but it also foreshadows one of their biggest and most boring flaws: mind-blowing stupidity.Nicole, at one point, hears the call of nature, and the two ill-fated young lovers stop at (dum da dum!) the Rest Stop.  After Nicole uses perhaps the most nauseating toilet in southwest America, she comes outside to find that her boyfriend and his car have disappeared.  Before long, she is tormented by a sadistic man in a yellow truck, an odd-ball family of fundamentalist God-thumpers, and her own crippling idiocy.  To save herself, Nicole drinks an ancient bottle of liquor, watches a little T.V., cries morosely, and spends about 18 hours in the Bathroom-o'-Ba'al.  Jaimie Alexander's Nicole does nothing that could be called intriguing or understandable, and (double whammy) she is horribly, horribly acted.Penned and directed by John Shiban, ""Rest Stop"" has literally nothing going for it.  Considering that Shiban is a veteran ""X-files"" scribe, the incomprehensible plot is forgiveable (I'll grant, while I'm on the subject, that various scenes given during the credits and on the disc's special features help ""clear up"" the ludicrous story, but I'll also say that if you have to employ extras in order to give your movie clarity, then there's something wrong).  But everything else -- the disbelieving cop, the mysterious video, the school bus -- well, it's all about as interesting and creative as the scribbles on your typical public toilet stall.",1,"Emphasis On The ""Stop""",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,1761,"['Young', 'Nicole', 'decided', 'run', 'away', 'Texas', 'home', 'equally', 'young', 'boyfriend', 'Jess', 'plan', 'Drive', 'Hollywood', 'seek', 'gainful', 'employment', 'Famous', 'Movie', 'Stars', 'one', 'fact', 'much', 'wrong', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'immediately', 'make', 'characters', 'hard', 'care', 'also', 'one', 'biggest', 'most', 'boring', 'flaws', 'mind-blowing', 'stupidity.Nicole', 'one', 'point', 'call', 'nature', 'two', 'ill-fated', 'young', 'lovers', 'stop', 'dum', 'da', 'dum', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'Nicole', 'uses', 'perhaps', 'most', 'nauseating', 'toilet', 'southwest', 'America', 'outside', 'find', 'boyfriend', 'car', 'have', 'disappeared', 'long', 'tormented', 'sadistic', 'man', 'yellow', 'truck', 'odd-ball', 'family', 'fundamentalist', 'God-thumpers', 'own', 'crippling', 'idiocy', 'save', 'Nicole', 'ancient', 'bottle', 'liquor', 'little', 'T.V.', 'morosely', 'about', '18', 'hours', ""Bathroom-o'-Ba'al"", 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Nicole', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'intriguing', 'understandable', 'double', 'whammy', 'horribly', 'horribly', 'acted.Penned', 'directed', 'John', 'Shiban', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'literally', 'nothing', 'going', 'Considering', 'Shiban', 'veteran', 'X-files', 'scribe', 'incomprehensible', 'plot', 'forgiveable', ""'ll"", 'grant', ""'m"", 'subject', 'various', 'scenes', 'given', 'credits', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'help', 'clear', 'up', 'ludicrous', 'story', ""'ll"", 'also', 'say', 'have', 'employ', 'extras', 'order', 'give', 'movie', 'clarity', 'then', 'something', 'wrong', 'everything', 'else', 'disbelieving', 'cop', 'mysterious', 'video', 'school', 'bus', 'well', 'interesting', 'creative', 'scribbles', 'typical', 'public', 'toilet', 'stall']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

If we look at all movies, they borrow from someone. Just accept this movie for what it is. I liked this movie because it  is ""what could be"" in real life. This is something that could happen. It isn't something that is from ""outer space"" and very unreal, this is a very ""real"" horror flick. The actress of this movie looked very terrified and was a very good actress. The only complaint about this movie is when the cop was hit by the driver, she didn't grab his gun and shoot the driver of the truck. That is the only complaint I have about this movie. We all act differently in ""stressful"" situations, so it isn't unlikely that she could have acted in the way she did when she was terrorized. For all of those that did enjoy this movie, look at the special features and you will find alternate endings and some scenes that I felt that they should have not cut from the movie.

1009144,A3EBTTHTAYDYF4,B000H2M2RA,"Metallian ""stained89""","[3, 3]","As already described, this is a Horror Thriller with a lot of inspiration borrowed heavily and without inhibitions from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", when it comes to the overall setting and atmosphere, ""Joy Ride"" when it comes to the Psychopathic Killer, and ""The Hills have Eyes"" because of the Mutant like Son and his parents who act as apparent sympathizers or even accomplices of the Killer.While this movie won't get any prizes for originallity, it does have its thrilling moments.  The main problem is, nonetheless, the lack of logic among the heroine.  When she has every reason to believe that something terrible just happend to her boyfriend, she finds a trailer where she seeks refuge from the Killer who she believes to be after her.  Here she actually finds a video of herself and her boyfriend while they are making love, which is only a few hours old.  Any normal person would by now try to get out of the trailer as fast as possible, but when a C.B. radio close to her rings she picks it up and starts talking to the other person on the line.  Even after finishing the conversation she stays in that trailer.  This is totally incoherent; I mean who in their right mind would stay at some stranger's trailer, where that video is.  If you put 1 and 1 together you just have to realize immediately that either a perverted peeping Tom made that video, which isen't exactly consolation, or even worse the Killer himself made it.  So why the hell stay in that trailer?  The small amount of alcohol that she drank can't explain this type of irrational behavior.  Another scene just totally defies any normal behavior.  Here the killer is coming toward Nicole,the heroine, with his pick-up truck; she manages to jump out of the way, thereby avoiding being hit by the truck.  In the event she flings her mobile phone away, only to pick it up in the next moment, as she decovers that the batteries have been removed by her sudden move.  So what does she actually do, she looks at the celluar for a second which is now dirty and throws it away.  Hello, anybody here who's thinking for a moment.  I mean, why not find the batteries, they can't be far away, and put them back in the phone??  Even if the phone didn't get a connection, as it did in the beginning of the movie, once the couple arrives at the deadly rest stop, it would be foolish and an absolute risk to leave the mobile phone behind, since a connection could easily be established else where.  This is another one of those scenes that just dosen't make any sense !Also Nicole dosen't come across as likeable.  When she was with her boyfriend, she's behaving like a spoiled teenager, and often acting rather bitchy and demanding, as if nothing is good enough for her.If the 2 unlogical scenes don't bother you and, the fact that a large portion of this movie is, to put it mildly, adoped from other aforementioned films, then this is certainly alright watching, if only for the thrills, which come rather frequently.  But if this is not the case, you'll be better off skipping this one.By the way, the horror elements are absolutely in the background, which makes this movie more of a dark and morbid Thriller, than a Horror flick.",3,"It's a good thrill, if you can forget logic for the time being !",1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,3200,"['already', 'described', 'Horror', 'Thriller', 'lot', 'inspiration', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'inhibitions', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'when', 'overall', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'when', 'Psychopathic', 'Killer', 'Hills', 'have', 'Eyes', 'Mutant', 'Son', 'parents', 'who', 'act', 'apparent', 'sympathizers', 'even', 'accomplices', 'Killer.While', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'prizes', 'originallity', 'have', 'thrilling', 'moments', 'main', 'problem', 'nonetheless', 'lack', 'logic', 'heroine', 'When', 'reason', 'believe', 'something', 'terrible', 'just', 'happend', 'boyfriend', 'trailer', 'where', 'refuge', 'Killer', 'who', 'be', 'Here', 'actually', 'video', 'herself', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'making', 'love', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'old', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'now', 'try', 'get', 'trailer', 'fast', 'possible', 'when', 'C.B', 'radio', 'close', 'rings', 'up', 'talking', 'other', 'person', 'line', 'Even', 'finishing', 'conversation', 'trailer', 'totally', 'incoherent', 'mean', 'who', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'stay', 'stranger', 'trailer', 'where', 'video', 'put', '1', '1', 'together', 'just', 'have', 'realize', 'immediately', 'perverted', 'peeping', 'Tom', 'made', 'video', 'ise', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'consolation', 'even', 'worse', 'Killer', 'made', 'So', 'why', 'hell', 'stay', 'trailer', 'small', 'amount', 'alcohol', 'drank', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'type', 'irrational', 'behavior', 'scene', 'just', 'totally', 'normal', 'behavior', 'Here', 'killer', 'coming', 'Nicole', 'heroine', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'jump', 'way', 'thereby', 'avoiding', 'being', 'hit', 'truck', 'event', 'mobile', 'phone', 'away', 'only', 'pick', 'up', 'next', 'moment', 'batteries', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'sudden', 'move', 'So', 'what', 'actually', 'do', 'celluar', 'second', 'now', 'dirty', 'away', 'Hello', 'anybody', 'here', 'who', 'thinking', 'moment', 'mean', 'why', 'not', 'find', 'batteries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'far', 'away', 'put', 'back', 'phone', 'Even', 'phone', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'connection', 'did', 'beginning', 'movie', 'once', 'couple', 'deadly', 'rest', 'stop', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'absolute', 'risk', 'leave', 'mobile', 'phone', 'connection', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'established', 'else', 'where', 'one', 'scenes', 'just', 'dose', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Also', 'Nicole', 'dose', ""n't"", 'come', 'likeable', 'When', 'was', 'boyfriend', 'behaving', 'spoiled', 'teenager', 'often', 'acting', 'rather', 'bitchy', 'demanding', 'nothing', 'good', 'enough', 'her.If', '2', 'unlogical', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'fact', 'large', 'portion', 'movie', 'put', 'mildly', 'adoped', 'other', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'then', 'certainly', 'alright', 'watching', 'only', 'thrills', 'come', 'rather', 'frequently', 'not', 'case', ""'ll"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'skipping', 'way', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'absolutely', 'background', 'movie', 'more', 'dark', 'morbid', 'Thriller', 'Horror', 'flick']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

On the way, they need to pull over, cause when ya gotta go, ya gotta go. When Nicole comes out of the can, her boyfriend is gone, there is no one around but an RV that appears to have no one in it.When Nicole decides to walk down the road for help, a yellow pick up truck that almost ran them off the road in a previous scene tries to run her down and she realizes her boyfriend is not just missing.She then becomes stalked by the guy in the pick up, and meets a few weirdos and spooks along the way, just trying to stay alive as she is preyed upon by a maniac.:::::I kind of enjoyed this one. It was not so scary, but i liked it cause it seemed like a fresh idea. Although some of the things you discover is happening along the way are kind of weird and hard to swallow, it's still interesting and I can't say I have seen it done like this before.The whole thing is pretty much shot around a rest stops toilet block for the whole movie, so you have to give them credit for being able to complete a movie that goes no where location-wise, but does go plenty of places plot-wise.::::Warning: ---SPOILERS-- if you don't want to read spoilers, don't read from here on.:::::Some things to this movie just don't make sense to me, so I can't give it more then 3 stars. Although it seemed fresh and interesting, it still leaves me wondering what the heck the r.v scene was for. So there religious nutballs, and probably have something to do with the killer in the truck, but they just did not seem to tie into the movie too good. I dunno, to me, it felt like they where there just to give the movie a scene that was not in the toilet block. But did not really belong in the movie, if I was the editor, I'd have cut that scene out.And the character of Nicole seeing ghosts of past victim's was an interesting thing to watch, but, why develop the cop Bruce Willis wanna-be so much, with him telling her to take his badge to his wife, and say goodbye to his daughter etc... it just did not feel right because he is telling her to kill him with the gun to end his suffering, yet it's really because he is a ghost and she can not kill the killer with a ghost gun... although, the end kind of made you realise the killer is a ghost anyway, so ...ehhh, is it really worth trying to make sense of this?The movies done, it is what it is.::: bonus features ::::- about 6 alternate endings. Some interesting, some your glad they did not use, and I think everyone could have come up with better endings then these.- the whacko family home cam, kind of funny.- on the bus - zzzzzzz- trailers, and behind the scenes of some thingsOverall, if you liked a movie called ""Monster Man"" then this movie should appeal to you.

Well the filmmakers here lite the wick but, their film doesn't take off ..sadly! ""Rest Stop"" is a bummer from the beginning.. the direction is flat, acting is mediocre at best, the writing is weak ..with an overemphasis on blood and gore that is there to try and cover up just how weak it is. I am a fan of horror movies and I like good gory effects but, a film has to have more to offer as well. I know that in a horrific situation one might not think straight.. but, our main girl had plenty of opportunities to either start walking or, shoot the psycho with the injured cops gun. There was a part when the girl suggested that she and another girl that was trapped in a utility closet escape together but, she never thought to do that on her own after she realized the trapped girl was either a ghost or only inside her head. Its not fully explained if the trapped girl was a past victim or what. Whenever the main girl decides to use the gun on the madman.. she of course wastes the bullets on the injured cop that ended up not really being there like the trapped girl.. so I don't even know if there was a gun or not because if the cop was part of the main girls imagination or a ghost (again it's not fully explained) ..then the gun was part of her imagination as well.. so I am not sure how the bullet holes got in the bathroom door. Also I don't understand why the cop didn't believe her at first.. he must have been a part of her imagination and not a past victim come back from the dead to help her because, if he was a past victim he would have already known that the crazed man was after her. I hate deep plot holes! The biggest misunderstanding I have is why the trapped girl and police man both vanish as if they weren't ever there, along with the blood that vanishes, the gun, the bullet holes??

What a whining, complaining, unlikeable person. How many times did she swear in the movie? Notice how from the very beginning of the movie she would have these mini temper tantrums of varying degrees, which would continue to the very end of this terrible film.--There was a point in the movie where I stopped giving my full, undivided attention, so maybe I might've missed something, but when the Phil Lamarr from Mad TV lookalike cop came into the picture, why weren't one or both of these items brought immediately into play: 1) his gun (before gasoline was an issue), 2) his walkie-talkie. Was there a reason why after he was injured, and they were both in the bathroom, that they didn't try to call for backup?--What bad acting from the Phil Lamarr lookalike cop. Tons of examples, but when they were in the bathroom, he said, ""don't let him trap you Nicole."" What is he, her COACH for some athletic sporting event? I guess it's the inclusion of her first name, but that, combined with his tone was just wrong for this situation, it makes him sound like some motivational speaker, or a corner-man giving advice to a boxer: ""watch for his jab, Nicole.""--What exactly was the killer waiting for? Why did he keep leaving her there and driving off? He could've got her anytime he wanted.--That random girl at the end they showed walking towards the bathroom must've been someone they picked up off the street. She had exactly 0% acting skills. The worst acting I've seen has been a tie between the cop fromCube, and that little child girl fromGhost Dog - The Way of the Samurai. I might have to change this list. Just listen to her explain to the cop about what she heard behind the door. When someone says ""what?"" in disbelief of what they're hearing from you, your first instinct isn't to tell the GENDER of the person (she said ""It was a girl!""), you usually will reiterate the seriousness of the situation by saying, "" I said, I heard a voice trapped behind the door, there's SOMEONE back there! I heard a VOICE!"" Not, ""it was a girl."" Because then the reaction could be, ""WTF are you talking about,*WHAT* was a girl?"" Then look at her reaction after the cop checks behind the door and concludes it was a joke, she says, ""but I heard it!""

While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. **",2,Could have been worse...,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,1859,"['Rest', 'Stop', 'John', 'Shiban', '2006', 'Writer/producer', 'John', 'Shiban', 'feature-film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Rest', 'Stop', 'slick', 'little', 'thriller', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'actually', 'admirable', 'goal', 'never', 'possible', 'fully', 'forget', 'movie', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'Still', 'vast', 'improvement', 'lot', 'recent', 'damsel-in-distress', 'flicks.Nicole', 'Watch', 'Me', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Jessie', 'Joey', 'Mendicino', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'have', 'run', 'away', 'small-town', 'Texas', 'home', 'are', 'way', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'when', 'pull', 'rest', 'stop', 'required', 'bathroom', 'break', 'Nicole', 'outside', 'find', 'Jessie', 'disappeared', 'also', 'rest', 'stop', 'home', 'base', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'been', 'picking', 'off', 'young', 'girls', 'there', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'forced', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'guy', 'questioning', 'sanity', 'more', 'more', 'game', 'on.Yes', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'yellow', 'pickup', 'truck', 'yes', 'are', 'awe-inspiringly', 'stupid', 'moments', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'make', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'production', 'company', 'actually', 'read', 'entire', 'script', 'bankrolling', 'thing', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'filmed', 'equivalent', 'novel', 'published', 'Xlibris', 'Shiban', 'was', 'least', 'trying', 'have', 'give', 'few', 'brownie', 'points', 'mean', 'how', 'seriously', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'Joey', 'Lawrence', 'cop', 'how', 'seriously', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'movie', 'camper', 'family', 'be', 'found', 'middle', 'one', 'entirely', 'possible', 'most', ""'ll"", 'get', 'movie', 'few', 'laughs', 'few', 'hours', 'nitpicking', 'buddies', 'awesome', 'eye', 'candy', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Still', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'got', 'Haute', 'Tension', '**']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

The torture and mutilation scene is out of ""Hostel""  the mutant is from ""The Hills Have Eyes"", the relentless crazed truck driver takes a detour from ""Joy Ride"" and many more.The boyfriend of a young girl disappears while she goes to take care of business in the most disgusting toilet at a abandoned rest stop. She actually uses it which defies credulity, she would have been better off going in the bushes.She spends the rest of the movie being terrorized by a maniac in a yellow truck and takes refuge about a dozen more times in the toilet of horror.She thinks she finds refuge with folks in a camper but they turn out to be the long lost cousins of the loons from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and they even have a mutant child in the back who takes polaroid pictures of himself.She escapes but just when you think how much crazier this movie can get she meets up with a park ranger played by Joey Lawrence who acts like he was still on the tv show ""Blossom"". For his efforts he gets run over a couple of times by the maniac in the yellow truck so our heroine drags him into the toilet-by this time she has spent so much time there she may as well start renting.  So Joey the ranger tells her to take his gun and blow his brains out-she takes the gun and sticks it in his mouth and fires and with half his skull skittering across the floor Joey tells her she didnt do a good enough job and to try again. She does and at least one bad acting performance has ended mercifully.The movie does not end happily but it does have some tense moments a lot of gore and is worth a rental but don't expect anything new or original.",3,NO REST FOR THE WEARY,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,1730,"['Rest', 'Stop', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'lazy', 'movie', 'borrows', 'ideas', 'much', 'better', 'horror', 'movies', 'torture', 'mutilation', 'scene', 'Hostel', 'mutant', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'relentless', 'crazed', 'truck', 'driver', 'detour', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'many', 'more.The', 'boyfriend', 'young', 'girl', 'disappears', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'most', 'disgusting', 'toilet', 'abandoned', 'rest', 'stop', 'actually', 'credulity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'going', 'bushes.She', 'rest', 'movie', 'being', 'terrorized', 'maniac', 'yellow', 'truck', 'refuge', 'dozen', 'more', 'times', 'toilet', 'horror.She', 'refuge', 'folks', 'camper', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'long', 'lost', 'cousins', 'loons', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'even', 'have', 'mutant', 'child', 'back', 'who', 'polaroid', 'pictures', 'himself.She', 'escapes', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'crazier', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'up', 'park', 'ranger', 'played', 'Joey', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'tv', 'show', 'Blossom', 'efforts', 'run', 'couple', 'times', 'maniac', 'yellow', 'truck', 'so', 'heroine', 'toilet-by', 'time', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'start', 'renting', 'So', 'Joey', 'ranger', 'take', 'gun', 'blow', 'brains', 'out-she', 'gun', 'sticks', 'mouth', 'fires', 'skull', 'skittering', 'floor', 'Joey', 'do', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'try', 'again', 'least', 'one', 'bad', 'acting', 'performance', 'ended', 'mercifully.The', 'movie', 'not', 'end', 'happily', 'have', 'tense', 'moments', 'lot', 'gore', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'new', 'original']",Rest Stop: Dead Ahead

I have definently seen more bad films then good in this area of cinema.Plot:Again, for a no name film, of course the plot is going to be vauge. Two teens are moving out to California (i think it is). A boyfriend and a girlfriend. Along the way they stop basically in the middle of nowhere at a rest stop.  When the girl comes back from the rest room her boyfriend's gone.  The whole villian scene is portrayed by a weirdo dude in yellow/white old ford truck. The movie never really ends, the film just stops.  There is an ongoing story in the end, which kind of bugged me, but  you'll have that.Pro's:Interesting gore scenes.  The pyscho killer/stalker finds some interesting ways to tortue his victims.  Also, some of the other scenes were graphic, which at times had me on the edge of my seat.Cons:Cheap, delicate plot. Predictable. No name actors. Sort of low budget.
