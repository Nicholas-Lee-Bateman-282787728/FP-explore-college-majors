432245,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,6304688369,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[6, 8]","I saw this again recently for the first time since it first appeared on TV. That was a special occasion because a cousin of mine in Charleston had just gotten their first color tv and we gathered there to watch this in 1969. As a five year old who was seeing color television for the first time (for those under 35- imagine this), it blew me away and the story left me with what my earliest images of what heaven would be like.Admittedly, seeing this as a grown man gives me some pause. While not as sickening to my stomach as the ""New Zoo Revue"" or the Sid and Marty Kroft stuff, nor does it have the eternal appeal of Bullwinkle or the Flintstones, it's okay for nostaligia or if you're watching it with small children. The scenes of Johnny Whittaker (who will forever be ""Jody"" of ""Family Affair"" to my g-g-generation) walking on the fake stairway to heaven is somewhat amusing (the hokey special effex here) and as usual, Cab Calloway steals the show as the Angel Gabriel blowing his horn.With all of that said, the film is not without it's charm. The is a sweetness and innocence to the overall story and it is admittedly unfair to judge the 1969 special effex to 21st century standards. What I liked best about the film is Fred Gwynne's performance as Patience, the guardian angel who's aboard to show Johnny Whittaker the ropes of heavenly life. This was probably his best role. He adds just enough whimsy and charm to keep the tale from beaing overbearably corny. Additionally, he's very likeable as a concerned man who wants the boy to do right while expressing a necessary concern for Whittaker's feelings. The type of big brother figure evey boy would wish to have (besides, what kid would not want to hang out with Herman Munster)?There are some concerns from parents about the theme about a child's early death and the reactions from parents of deceased children and siblings of such children. Being that I'm not a parent, I cannot comment on that with authority. There are also those who have issues over the religious content of this and the depictions of God and heaven. To the latter, I could only say that one of the drawbacks to our time is the tendency of modern audiences to read WAY too much into such stories. Just see it for what it was clearly intended in 1969 and the original book in 1946, an innocent and sweet story designed to do nothing more than charm audiences.Interesting as a curio.

Watch veteran actors weave a magic spell around the tale of a very young angel struggling to earn his wings while wreaking minimal damage to the heavens around him.Johnny Whitaker was an ideal choice for the little angel; he looks like someone designed by Mattel Toy Company, and has a subdued, charming spunk about him as he carefully learns the ropes as a fledgling angel, then gets recklessly creative to the benefit of all.The effects work are what you would expect from the era and certainly lack the finesse we enjoy today. But it's VERY adequate for 1970s video, which is a far more difficult and unforgiving medium than its motion picture counterparts.The songs are well-authored and there are two fairly haunting ones: when guardian angel Fred Gwynne lapses into nostalgia about his own mortal life of ages past (""Once Upon Another Time""); and the magnificent chorus of the angels preparing their gifts for the first Christmas (""May It Bring Him Pleasure""), where the Little Angel manages to upstage them all with a simple, childish gift that has greater heart than anything the more experienced angels could produce.All in all this has a charm that cartoons can't match in spite of all its technical glitches: it has an ALIVE feel, and even small kids sense the difference and prefer this version to animated ones.As I do.",5,Crude -- But Charming!,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,1361,"['Forget', 'cartoon', 'versions', 'Watch', 'veteran', 'actors', 'weave', 'magic', 'spell', 'tale', 'very', 'young', 'angel', 'struggling', 'earn', 'wings', 'wreaking', 'minimal', 'damage', 'heavens', 'him.Johnny', 'Whitaker', 'was', 'ideal', 'choice', 'little', 'angel', 'someone', 'designed', 'Mattel', 'Toy', 'Company', 'subdued', 'charming', 'spunk', 'about', 'carefully', 'ropes', 'fledgling', 'angel', 'then', 'recklessly', 'creative', 'benefit', 'all.The', 'effects', 'work', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'era', 'certainly', 'lack', 'finesse', 'enjoy', 'today', 'VERY', 'adequate', '1970s', 'video', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'unforgiving', 'medium', 'motion', 'picture', 'counterparts.The', 'songs', 'are', 'well-authored', 'are', 'two', 'fairly', 'haunting', 'ones', 'when', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'nostalgia', 'own', 'mortal', 'life', 'ages', 'Once', 'Time', 'magnificent', 'chorus', 'angels', 'preparing', 'gifts', 'first', 'Christmas', 'May', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Pleasure', 'where', 'Little', 'Angel', 'upstage', 'simple', 'childish', 'gift', 'greater', 'heart', 'anything', 'more', 'experienced', 'angels', 'could', 'produce.All', 'charm', 'cartoons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'spite', 'technical', 'glitches', 'ALIVE', 'feel', 'even', 'small', 'kids', 'sense', 'difference', 'prefer', 'version', 'animated', 'ones.As', 'do']",N/A

The show was intended to be an uplifting tale of angels and Heaven. Instead, this pre-teen targeted program scared the bejesus out of the kids by showing them that children die horrifying deaths and are unable to ever speak or hear from their parents again. Apparently, even in those non-PC times parents were horrified by this show to such a degree that they called and complained in droves. To my knowledge it never aired again.I was seven when this program premiered and I had been through the ordeal of my little sister's death from cancer. I had been through the death of other family members. This program was cold comfort. It traumatized me and I am still affected by it in a very negative way.Little Michael (Johnny Whitaker) chases a dove sent from God, only to run right off a cliff and die. The angels allow him to return home to retrieve a treasured keepsake but he is unable to speak to his parents and they are unable to see or hear him.I don't know how this figured as holiday/Christmas fare, but it was presented around Christmas time. I know it has stuck in my mind all these thirty plus years later and not in a good way. I have always found myself worrying about the death of relatives and I'm convinced this film has added to some of that stress.Definitely NOT for young children unless you want to traumatize them.",2,Horrifying Holiday Story will Traumatize Children for Years to Come!,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,1419,"['little', 'television', 'nugget', 'premiered', '1969', 'television', 'one', 'showing', 'only', 'show', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'uplifting', 'tale', 'angels', 'Heaven', 'Instead', 'pre-teen', 'targeted', 'program', 'scared', 'bejesus', 'kids', 'showing', 'children', 'die', 'horrifying', 'deaths', 'are', 'unable', 'ever', 'speak', 'hear', 'parents', 'again', 'Apparently', 'even', 'non-PC', 'times', 'parents', 'were', 'horrified', 'show', 'degree', 'called', 'complained', 'droves', 'knowledge', 'never', 'aired', 'again.I', 'was', 'seven', 'when', 'program', 'premiered', 'had', 'been', 'ordeal', 'little', 'sister', 'death', 'cancer', 'had', 'been', 'death', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'program', 'was', 'cold', 'comfort', 'traumatized', 'am', 'still', 'affected', 'very', 'negative', 'way.Little', 'Michael', 'Johnny', 'Whitaker', 'dove', 'sent', 'God', 'only', 'run', 'right', 'cliff', 'die', 'angels', 'allow', 'return', 'home', 'retrieve', 'treasured', 'keepsake', 'unable', 'speak', 'parents', 'are', 'unable', 'see', 'hear', 'him.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'figured', 'holiday/Christmas', 'fare', 'was', 'presented', 'Christmas', 'time', 'know', 'stuck', 'mind', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'worrying', 'death', 'relatives', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'film', 'added', 'stress.Definitely', 'NOT', 'young', 'children', 'want', 'traumatize']",N/A
432252,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,6304688369,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[5, 5]","""The Littlest Angel"" began when legendary Hollywood star Loretta Young befriended renowned writer Charles Tazewell (who also wrote ""The Small One,' which Disney later animated). Tazewell promised to write something especially for her, and some time later, a script arrived at her house: ""The Littlest Angel.""Young set about to record the script for Decca Records, but was at a retreat (she was a devout Catholic) and told her agent the recording session had to wait until after that weekend. However, Greer Garson had read the script in a Decca office and was going to record it unless Young did it first. Young raced from the retreat, recorded the six-disc 78 RPM with a full orchestra, and returned to the retreat without missing a prayer. Even the musicians were amazed how they were able to record it in a flash with no problems.The record album was a huge hit, was later released on vinyl, performed on radio, and adapted into a book by Tazewell.  One of the reasons Young was so touched by the story is because she and her husband has suffered through miscarriaged and considered her lost children as ""angels in heaven."" Therein lies the issue -- this fantasy is indeed about a little boy who dies, goes to heaven, has trouble fitting in, and ultimately gives a great gift. But it's more than a story about death -- it's about life everlasting, and that's why Hallmark made it into a musical special in 1969.The music and lyrics are by Lan o""kun, a longtime collaborator with Shari Lewis who co-wrote an episode of Star Trek with her. The arrangements are by John Morris, who added so much to Mel Brooks films of the 70's and wrote ""The French Chef."" The case is superb and the production values are way way way out of date by today's standards, but back then they were the best TV could do with limited time, budgets, and the tools they had. Today, you can do better effects on your PC, but one might be forgiving when appreciating this show in context.That all said, even though I love the music (and listen to the LP record almost every Christmas), and have had the VHS tape for years, I'm waitng for the right time to show this to my young children. My wife and I have watched it together (and we have experienced the losses of loved ones), and enjoy the show for what it is. We'd like to share it with the kids, but we're waiting for the right year. It may be this year, but we'll see.[...]I really like this special, but I guess it's not for everyone.

432253,A12KM32L9JURF6,6304688369,hey_steve,"[81, 82]","The technical aspects of this review refer to the Westlake Entertainment Group release.Based on the classic children's book by Charles Tazewell comes this feature originally broadcast on ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" in 1969. As an 11 year old at the time, I remember watching this on the ol' black and white TV each year it was broadcast. The show didn't catch on as a continuing holiday tradition and was shuffled off to TV oblivion. Therefore, it was a completely unexpected joy to discover this on DVD.Having not seen it for 25 plus years, I was wondering if I would view it as fondly as my memories were of the program. The first thing I noticed was it is a musical. I remember musical aspects of the show, but, it is a true musical and I think it plays much better for adults that way.Starring Johnny Whitaker (of ""Family Affair"" fame) as Michael a shepherd boy who falls from a rock cliff and ascends to heaven. There he is greeted by God (E.G. Marshall) who sends him through the gates where he is welcomed by Gabriel (Cab Calloway!, that's worth the price of admission right there). Character actor John McGiver assigns Fred Gwynne (""The Munsters"", ""Car 54, Where Are You?"") as Michael's guardian angel and introduces Michael to the wonders of heaven. Along the way Michael learns to fly with the help of flying teacher Connie Stevens and waits in a line for his heavenly job only to be befriended by a Roman who doesn't believe he is where he is, superbly played by Tony Randall. With the exception of E. G. Marshall and John McGiver, they all have a musical number. The highlight for me was Fred Gwynne's solo number of him reminiscing of his time on earth. He put such conviction in the number, when the song ends, you are right there with him wishing he could return.Michael is still unhappy in Heaven and is allowed back to earth to retrieve his ""treasure box"" of artifacts from earth. When he returns, it is the night of the Messiah's birth. All angels are to present gifts and Michael presents the most special one of all.I was just as touched at the ending of this program this time around, probably more so than the first time I saw it.The drawback for a lot of people will probably be the technical parts of the program. First, notice I don't say movie or film. Although the first few minutes are filmed, the rest is videotaped. Made in 1969, this had to be one of the first productions that utilized the blue or green screen for the whole production. As such, it certainly is not on a par with what they can do today. But do all things have to be perfect? Can't you use a little imagination? With that said, there are a couple of glitches that lasts only for a couple of seconds in the master tape, probably due to the age, nothing to keep you from enjoying this story that brought back a lot of memories from Christmases long ago. The run time is listed as 90 minutes but actually runs 77 minutes.Thanks to the release of this DVD, this will again be a tradition in my household.  And with the low price, there is no reason for it not to be in your home also.",4,A buried holiday treasure from the 60's resurfaces...,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,3074,"['technical', 'aspects', 'review', 'refer', 'Westlake', 'Entertainment', 'Group', 'release.Based', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'Charles', 'Tazewell', 'feature', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', '1969', '11', 'year', 'old', 'time', 'remember', 'watching', 'ol', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'year', 'was', 'broadcast', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'continuing', 'holiday', 'tradition', 'was', 'shuffled', 'off', 'TV', 'oblivion', 'Therefore', 'was', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'joy', 'discover', 'DVD.Having', 'not', 'seen', '25', 'years', 'was', 'wondering', 'would', 'view', 'as', 'fondly', 'memories', 'were', 'program', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'musical', 'remember', 'musical', 'aspects', 'show', 'true', 'musical', 'think', 'much', 'better', 'adults', 'way.Starring', 'Johnny', 'Whitaker', 'Family', 'Affair', 'fame', 'Michael', 'shepherd', 'boy', 'who', 'rock', 'cliff', 'heaven', 'greeted', 'God', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'who', 'gates', 'where', 'welcomed', 'Gabriel', 'Cab', 'Calloway', 'price', 'admission', 'right', 'there', 'Character', 'actor', 'John', 'McGiver', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Munsters', 'Car', '54', 'Are', 'Michael', 'guardian', 'angel', 'introduces', 'Michael', 'wonders', 'heaven', 'way', 'Michael', 'fly', 'help', 'flying', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'waits', 'line', 'heavenly', 'job', 'only', 'be', 'befriended', 'Roman', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'where', 'superbly', 'played', 'Tony', 'Randall', 'exception', 'E.', 'G.', 'Marshall', 'John', 'McGiver', 'have', 'musical', 'number', 'highlight', 'was', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'solo', 'number', 'reminiscing', 'time', 'earth', 'put', 'such', 'conviction', 'number', 'when', 'song', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'wishing', 'could', 'return.Michael', 'still', 'unhappy', 'Heaven', 'allowed', 'back', 'earth', 'retrieve', 'treasure', 'box', 'artifacts', 'earth', 'When', 'night', 'Messiah', 'birth', 'angels', 'are', 'present', 'gifts', 'Michael', 'presents', 'most', 'special', 'one', 'all.I', 'was', 'just', 'touched', 'ending', 'program', 'time', 'probably', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'it.The', 'drawback', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'technical', 'parts', 'program', 'First', 'notice', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'film', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'are', 'filmed', 'rest', 'videotaped', 'Made', '1969', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'productions', 'utilized', 'blue', 'green', 'screen', 'whole', 'production', 'such', 'certainly', 'not', 'par', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'today', 'do', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'perfect', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'little', 'imagination', 'said', 'are', 'couple', 'glitches', 'only', 'couple', 'seconds', 'master', 'tape', 'probably', 'due', 'age', 'nothing', 'keep', 'enjoying', 'story', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'Christmases', 'long', 'ago', 'run', 'time', 'listed', '90', 'minutes', 'actually', '77', 'minutes.Thanks', 'release', 'DVD', 'will', 'again', 'be', 'tradition', 'household', 'low', 'price', 'reason', 'not', 'be', 'home', 'also']",N/A
