The answer is a very sordid history involving incest.  The silly script, poor acting, and bad creature effects eventually sink this movie into the level of preposterousness.

Lovecraft.On a  small island off the coast of Canada (or New England) the disturbance of  the local graveyard rises the ire of its unknown inhabitants, seriously  grosteque mutants that are living in tunnels beneath the town.  Soon people  are disappearing left and right.And just what does this all have to do  with the sickly young man and his concerned wife who have come to the  island community to probe into the man's dark family history?I strongly  recommend that you watch this chilling little movie and find out, it is  well worth seeing.  In fact it is nearly a classic of its kind.  Too bad  the film is handicapped by very flat and unimaginative photography and a  director who does not use atmosphere and mood in any way, shape, or form.

192242,A2198FZZMTJ38H,1575236842,D. Litton,"[0, 1]","One has to wonder how a movie that ends with a man eating a fetus kept alive in formaldehyde, in order to cure the degenerative blood disease caused by the generations of inbreeding in his family, ever got made. But here it is, &quot;Bleeders,&quot; which is more promising than most independent horror films, but not by much. And despite that, it's still a movie-making folly. You'll barf, but not in the way the movie intends.The movie begins by showing us a gratuitous sex scene, as a narrator relates the family history of a Dutch family who moved to the coast of North America and kept breeding within the family. Cutting to the same coastal island, only present day, John Strauss (Roy Dupuis) and his wife, Kathleen (Kristen Lehman), are venturing to the place of his birth in order to find out more about a degenerative blood disease plaguing him.Paying a visit to Dr. Marlowe (Rutger Hauer), the only doctor on the island, they are able to get the medicine they need and continue their explorations, leading them to many different places and people, all of whom speak of strange occurrences within the Van Damme family, who were rumored to have been killed off in a fire 75 years before.As in any horror movie, people start disappearing into the ground, the victims of midget-like mutated &quot;people&quot; who live in tunnels spanning the length of the island. As if the movie doesn't make it predictable enough, it lets us know that John is actually a member of the Van Damme family. And to prepare itself for an inevitably boring climax, the movie has a beginning twist: the coffins on the island are all being dug up, so the mutants must look for other, living sources of nourishment.I have to ask just one question: Who comes up with this kind of material? It's the kind of plot that, even with a Hollywood gloss and a major studio to back it up, it would still flounder miserably. It's predictable and lame, and sets up its characters in different ways so that we know who's going to die when, where, how, and what's even going to be left after the feast.The acting is sketchy at best. Rutger Hauer's acting as Dr. Marlowe isn't as much a problem as the fact that his character is merely there to provide all the scientific information needed so that the imbeciles sitting in front of the television will know what's going on. Roy Dupuis is a bore as John, never reaching any level of believability with his character's urge to learn more about his past. Kristen Lehman, as Kathleen, has her moments, mostly in her character's concern for her husband, but it quickly dissolves when her T&amp;A shot comes to call.And if there's nothing more I hate about a horror movie, it's the long awaited antagonist that is never really as scary as the movie claims to be. All the character talk of foreboding things to come, and some nice flashbacks in John's mind set us up for what can only end up being a fall. The small creatures are funny rather than scary, and if you need a good laugh, then this is a pretty good movie for it.&quot;Bleeders&quot; is the kind of movie directed with one thing in mind: money. There's no coherent plot, no credible acting, no intense suspense sequences or grasping images. What there is is an abundance of banal, uninvolving story and cheesy horror tactics that makes movies like &quot;Kolobos&quot; look good.",1,"Failed attempt at classic horror, with no scares or shocks.",994982400,"07 13, 2001",2001,3351,"['One', 'wonder', 'how', 'movie', 'man', 'eating', 'fetus', 'kept', 'alive', 'formaldehyde', 'order', 'cure', 'degenerative', 'blood', 'disease', 'caused', 'generations', 'inbreeding', 'family', 'ever', 'got', 'made', 'here', 'quot', 'Bleeders', 'quot', 'more', 'promising', 'most', 'independent', 'horror', 'films', 'not', 'much', 'still', 'movie-making', 'folly', ""'ll"", 'barf', 'not', 'way', 'movie', 'intends.The', 'movie', 'showing', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scene', 'narrator', 'family', 'history', 'Dutch', 'family', 'who', 'moved', 'coast', 'North', 'America', 'kept', 'breeding', 'family', 'Cutting', 'same', 'coastal', 'island', 'only', 'present', 'day', 'John', 'Strauss', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'wife', 'Kathleen', 'Kristen', 'Lehman', 'are', 'venturing', 'place', 'birth', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'degenerative', 'blood', 'disease', 'plaguing', 'him.Paying', 'visit', 'Dr.', 'Marlowe', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'only', 'doctor', 'island', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'medicine', 'need', 'continue', 'explorations', 'leading', 'many', 'different', 'places', 'people', 'whom', 'speak', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'Van', 'Damme', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'rumored', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'off', 'fire', '75', 'years', 'before.As', 'horror', 'movie', 'people', 'start', 'disappearing', 'ground', 'victims', 'midget-like', 'mutated', 'quot', 'people', 'quot', 'who', 'live', 'tunnels', 'spanning', 'length', 'island', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'predictable', 'enough', 'know', 'John', 'actually', 'member', 'Van', 'Damme', 'family', 'prepare', 'inevitably', 'boring', 'climax', 'movie', 'beginning', 'twist', 'coffins', 'island', 'are', 'being', 'dug', 'up', 'mutants', 'must', 'look', 'other', 'living', 'sources', 'nourishment.I', 'have', 'ask', 'just', 'one', 'question', 'Who', 'up', 'kind', 'material', 'kind', 'plot', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'gloss', 'major', 'studio', 'back', 'up', 'would', 'still', 'flounder', 'miserably', 'predictable', 'lame', 'up', 'characters', 'different', 'ways', 'so', 'know', 'who', 'going', 'die', 'when', 'where', 'how', 'what', 'even', 'going', 'be', 'left', 'feast.The', 'acting', 'sketchy', 'best', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'acting', 'Dr.', 'Marlowe', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'problem', 'fact', 'character', 'merely', 'provide', 'scientific', 'information', 'needed', 'so', 'imbeciles', 'sitting', 'front', 'television', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'bore', 'John', 'never', 'reaching', 'level', 'believability', 'character', 'urge', 'learn', 'more', 'past', 'Kristen', 'Lehman', 'Kathleen', 'moments', 'mostly', 'character', 'concern', 'husband', 'quickly', 'when', 'T', 'amp', 'A', 'shot', 'call.And', 'nothing', 'more', 'hate', 'horror', 'movie', 'long', 'awaited', 'antagonist', 'never', 'really', 'as', 'scary', 'movie', 'be', 'character', 'talk', 'foreboding', 'things', 'come', 'nice', 'flashbacks', 'John', 'mind', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'fall', 'small', 'creatures', 'are', 'funny', 'rather', 'scary', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'then', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'it.', 'quot', 'Bleeders', 'quot', 'kind', 'movie', 'directed', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'money', 'coherent', 'plot', 'credible', 'acting', 'intense', 'suspense', 'sequences', 'grasping', 'images', 'What', 'abundance', 'banal', 'uninvolving', 'story', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'tactics', 'movies', 'quot', 'Kolobos', 'quot', 'look', 'good']",N/A

192246,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,1575236842,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 1]","For such a slow-paced opening (and middle), I really enjoyed the story of this oft-forgotten B-release.  The plot, though not perfectly consistent--what horror is, right?--really interested me and I gave a damn about the main characters.  Throw in some stumpy, mutant, photosensitive Morlocks that can make you smile and you have a real winner with some fun flavor.  This is an ""A+"" of a B-movie.Wait!  B-horror that comes with a history lesson?  Yes, please!  In 1652 the King of Holland forbade intermarriage within aristocratic families when doctors discovered hemophilia and other genetic defects in the royal family.  [End history lesson.]Eva Van Daam (Gillian Ferrabee; Secret Window), a true narcissist, chose to lay with her twin brother (also played by Gillian Ferrabee), the closest second to making love to herself.  After the king's decree against incest, she moved her family to the New World where, presumably, they could continue their sibling-kissing ways behind closed doors and they disappeared in history in some Atlantic island community.Cutting to present day, we meet a very pale, awkwardly European-looking John Strauss (Roy Dupuis; Screamers).  He is weak--noted by his heavy-handedness on his cane--has strange visions during seizures, and is a hemophiliac tended lovingly by his much healthier and more attractive wife Kathleen (Kristin Lehman; The Chronicles of Riddick).  After a life-threatening nose bleed--referred to as blood poisoning--we quickly meet this Atlantic village's only doctor, Dr. Marlowe (Rutger Hauer; The Rite, Hobo with a Shotgun).We learn that John was born on the island but raised in Paris since he was an infant, funded on some manner of anonymous/secret trust fund which the bank traced back to the Atlantic village.  During their origin-sleuthing expedition, John and Kathleen stay in the town's only hotel, which doubles as a funeral home.  Charming, right?  Dr. Marlowe turns out to be on the island investigating something himself, and his path soon converges with John's investigation.John's visions become more frequent, he develops a hunger unremedied by food and has no explanation for having these strange ""urges.""  Some interesting discoveries suggest that John may actually be a Van Daam, even though he is 33 and the last of the family died off 75 years ago in a terrible fire at their estate.  Hmmmm?When we finally meet our monsters the scenes feel, well, ""fun.""  Someone gets dragged to their doom, as usual, but something about it made me smile.  From here it's all stumpy, disproportioned, hermaphroditic mutants and, to the delight of horror fans, they're breaking the rules when choosing their victems with no discretion between a witch of a crotchety woman and a sweet old lady in a wheelchair, a sweet young lady trying to escape her abusive mother, and yes, innocent children!What to watch for:  1) John finds the cure for his incurable disease.  Not exactly turning to Eastern Medicine when hospitals failed him, he eats a dead fetus that's been soaking in formaldehyde for years.  Afterwards he has the confidence of an athlete from one of the early 1990s Wheaties ads.  2) The ""Bleeders"" are all legless hermaphrodites.  So, essentially, when they move by tripod-ing their arms and ""lower body"" stumps they are basically slamming and dragging their genitals across the rocky floor of their catacomb homes.  Ouch!  3) John is reunited with his long-separated twin sister (the THIRD acting credit for Gillian Ferrabee in this film, by the way) that he never knew existed.  To provide an exact narrative quote from the movie:  ""And although his sister could make love to herself, she welcomed her long lost brother and loved him, too.""  I appreciate when they came ad some sincere romance to a B-horror flick.  Don't you?  4)  Realizing that Gillian Ferrabee plays three different small roles as incestuous members of the Van Daam family!  I guess the director was trying to ride the coattails of The Nutty Professor (1996) which came out one year earlier with Eddie Murphy playing seven characters.Director Peter Svatek had done nothing major prior to Bleeders (not that Bleeders is by any means major), nor after, and I can only add Witchboard III: The Possession (1995) to his horror credits.  That said, I was quite pleased with this flick and shocked that such an inexperienced director could generate this product.  It absolutely could have been better.  But it's worth a watch just the way it is.ALTERNATE TITLE:  This was also released as The Descendent with a very non-horror-looking DVD cover.  One may mistake it for a drama at a glance...but far from it.  Yet another title, Hemoglobin, appeared to be a medical thriller of sorts.  Again, quite far off.  The present cover is most blatant and, while it gives away the appearance of the monsters, does that really ruin the movie for anyone?",3,"Stumpy, hermaphroditic, flesh-eating mutants and an anemic

An important bloodline practices incest to keep the bloodline going, and over time the children end up becoming grotesque little monsters. I got this to finish my H.P. Lovecraft adaption collection; I have every last one of them and Crimson Cult was the last one I needed and I loved it. Another, better film, was based off the same H.P. Lovecraft story, if not I stand corrected; it was called Lurking Fear. As far as Lovecraft adaptions go, this is B-grade. This is an under-rated film. I got lucky and I own the now out of print and rare bloody box version. There is a plastic thing attached to the front cover that contains fake blood that is movable.

When a couple come to a remote island off the coast of Maine to find his family, they soon find out that the town has few secrets burried under the cemetary. Centuries earlier a family of rich Dutch people called the VanDams lived there. Being inbreads,their mansion was set aflame by the townsfolk. But some Vandams escaped into the tunnels beneath the island. Years later they still live there and survive  by eating the corpses from the cemetary. Once their food source is taken away after the cemetary is dug up, they become desprate for food and start feeding on those unlucky enough to be out at night. Soon they are discovered and are found to be very sensitive to light. The townsfolk gather at the lighthouse where they hold up with guns through the storm and try to fight them off. The best scene is where the island's mortician, Alice climbs down into a  grave to steal a necklace (for the best of intentions) and a Vandam pops out from underneath the coffin, digs sharpened hammers and spikes into her calves and pulls her into the caves.

He is drawn to an island that he has never been to before and finds his family. It sounds like a nice ""run of the mill"" type of movie. But it is anything but a ""run of the mill"" type of movie.

I wasn't scared at all, in fact, but  some of the deeper plot elements kept me watching until the end.I did  not like the fact that most of the shots of the grotesque Van Daans were so  brief you did not get much of a look at them, but from a scientific  person's point of view, it kept you wondering about how this could have  happened to a family.The only part that made me sick was Jon Strauss's  having to eat...that fetus that had been soaking in formaldehyde for 75  years.  *That* was going beyond the good--or bad--tastes of any horror  film.  Horror film cannibalism is one thing, but this was overstepping  bounds.On the other hand, the element that interested me most, and  dissapointed me because it wasn't really resolved that well, was Kathleen's  baby.  It's a Van Daan.  Was it a boy or a girl?  Born with the horribly  mutated gene's of it's father?  Would it have to come back to the abandoned  island one day if it displays the symptoms of Jon's blood disease?I wish  that factor had been addressed more, but if they ever make a sequal--and  this I doubt, it was a B-movie--I would hope it would be this child coming  back, whether for medical reasons or simply to explore his/her twisted  roots.Now *that* would make an interesting movie element.",3,"Fairly good, but not that scary",966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,1380,"['Well', 'rented', 'movie', 'expecting', 'horror', 'show', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'intruiging', 'scary', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'fact', 'deeper', 'plot', 'elements', 'kept', 'watching', 'end.I', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'most', 'shots', 'grotesque', 'Van', 'Daans', 'were', 'so', 'brief', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'look', 'scientific', 'person', 'point', 'view', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'family.The', 'only', 'part', 'made', 'sick', 'was', 'Jon', 'Strauss', 'having', 'eat', 'fetus', 'had', 'been', 'soaking', 'formaldehyde', '75', 'years', '*That*', 'was', 'going', 'good', 'bad', 'tastes', 'horror', 'film', 'Horror', 'film', 'cannibalism', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'overstepping', 'other', 'hand', 'element', 'interested', 'most', 'dissapointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'resolved', 'that', 'well', 'was', 'Kathleen', 'baby', 'Van', 'Daan', 'Was', 'boy', 'girl', 'Born', 'horribly', 'mutated', 'gene', 'father', 'Would', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'abandoned', 'island', 'one', 'day', 'symptoms', 'Jon', 'blood', 'disease', 'wish', 'factor', 'had', 'been', 'addressed', 'more', 'ever', 'make', 'sequal', 'doubt', 'was', 'B-movie', 'would', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'child', 'coming', 'back', 'medical', 'reasons', 'simply', 'explore', 'his/her', 'twisted', 'roots.Now', '*that*', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie', 'element']",N/A
192253,A3UA046AA3DXFD,1575236842,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","Ahhh Bleeders, we must say this has been a very long time coming. Naturally this little horror flick comes from Sid's golden decade of the 90's, where the B was plentiful and smoke patrol was in full force. The only thing that could top slapping your hand on the gold oldsmobile while hot on the trail of some smokers was to cue up some B horror. Bleeders is one of the few films produced by A-Pix, who also brought usJack Frost&Uncle Sam, just before the company vanished into thin air. Guess there weren't even people willing to support the cause of poorly made b horror. Thankfully we were (you were!) and still are ready and willing to this day. Which is why we scouted out the lesser known Bleeders in order to add it to the review library. It's simply something that had to be done. Sid remembers always seeing the big VHS box sitting on the video store shelf numerous times years ago. Since we passed on it on so many occasions we really had to DO IT NOW! DO IT NOW!Bleeders starts off with some creepy incest naught time in which a brother gets it on with his sister. So sometime this sister shows her vagin to her brother Bilo. Flash forward to years in the future, into the glorious B 90's, where we are introduced to our main character and his hot girlfriend. This guy has traveled to the remote island he was born trying to find a cure for his illness. While searching for any relatives he comes to find that they have all died off years ago..or so they tell him. Turns out from all the massive inbreeding the freaks live deep under the ground where they feast on corpses. What you see on the cover is exactly what these creatures look like. See that's what we like to see, no false advertising. Eventually the creatures come out from there undergroud dwelling to feast on the living. Somehow this guys says he needs to be with them and joins the freakshow underground. And instead of taking his hot girlfriend to pound town he decides to get freaky with his obese sister. Yeah this is some weird stuff, it'll mess you up for the rest of your life.We must say, Bleeders was really a pretty top notch 90's B horror. It had a few dull moments, which is always to be expected...especially without the Chuck, but pretty much delivered on all required B levels. The creatures were really awesome, and had to be ""little people"" or elves since they didn't stand over 4 feet tall. Not to mention you get a lot of creature action which is always required. There's no reason for a lack of creature action unless you're devoting you camera time to Don Swayze's distorted face. The story was actually decent along with some sub par acting. It walked that comfortable middle ground where it was so B but not nearly unwatchable. You really can't ask for anything more then that. The only thing this movie needed was one of those sweet holographic covers A-Pix was all about. That would have been as perfect as Sid beating Dutch with his king size butterfinger bar.
