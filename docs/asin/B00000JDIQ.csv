The significant other can become addicted to drugs. Someone powerful can insult  you and you'll just swallow - or be squashed like a bug. Alien-looking  people can attack you on a street. A bartender will decide there is no need  to be polite with you. There are some exclusive places you are not allowed  to enter. The police is supposed to protect you but there are renegades in  their ranks that can abuse and blackmail you.  We are all afraid of torture  and death.Payback is a kind of encyclopedia - the film addresses a wide  range of urban fears.And you are invited to stand in the shoes of  someone whom you always wanted to be - the fearless adventurer, expert  fistfighter and sharpshooter, a man who can start a 10-minutes walk in a  street as a shabby pauper and finish it smartly dressed, with a new credit  card and a pack of banknotes. He is irresistible to women and deadly to  men. He is not afraid to die - an almost unique quality inherited from  Gibson's Lethal Weapon character.So he beats everyone (women and  bartenders included), kills quite a few - he is getting even, he pays back,  he is fullfilling your dreams, attending to your fears. Nothing can stop  him.The film wants to look visually inventive, contemporary.  Mostly it  comes to the blue filter being kept over the camera lenses. Or were the  freshly shot rolls of film soaked in a can of blue ink? Gibson narrates the  story in a way that makes him look like Chandler's Marlowe. And the final  song sends us back to the the films noir tradition.But all these tricks  fail to amount to anything significant. The violence is excessive, Porter's  stubbornness ( -&quot;$70 000, not $130 000!&quot;) begins to annoy very  quikly and the director's invitation to participate in that feat of  gratification is too obvious.",3,Gratification poorly masked as art.,955324800,"04 10, 2000",2000,1935,"['What', 'are', 'most', 'common', 'fears', 'frustrations', 'today', 'city', 'dwellers', 'money', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'spouse', 'can', 'betray', 'significant', 'other', 'can', 'become', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'Someone', 'powerful', 'can', 'insult', ""'ll"", 'just', 'swallow', 'be', 'squashed', 'bug', 'Alien-looking', 'people', 'can', 'attack', 'street', 'bartender', 'will', 'decide', 'need', 'be', 'polite', 'are', 'exclusive', 'places', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'enter', 'police', 'supposed', 'protect', 'are', 'renegades', 'ranks', 'can', 'abuse', 'blackmail', 'are', 'afraid', 'torture', 'death.Payback', 'kind', 'encyclopedia', 'film', 'wide', 'range', 'urban', 'fears.And', 'are', 'invited', 'stand', 'shoes', 'someone', 'whom', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'fearless', 'adventurer', 'expert', 'fistfighter', 'sharpshooter', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'start', '10-minutes', 'walk', 'street', 'shabby', 'pauper', 'finish', 'smartly', 'dressed', 'new', 'credit', 'card', 'pack', 'banknotes', 'irresistible', 'women', 'deadly', 'men', 'not', 'afraid', 'die', 'almost', 'unique', 'quality', 'inherited', 'Gibson', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'character.So', 'everyone', 'women', 'bartenders', 'included', 'quite', 'few', 'getting', 'even', 'back', 'fullfilling', 'dreams', 'attending', 'fears', 'Nothing', 'can', 'stop', 'him.The', 'film', 'look', 'visually', 'inventive', 'contemporary', 'Mostly', 'blue', 'filter', 'being', 'kept', 'camera', 'were', 'freshly', 'shot', 'rolls', 'film', 'soaked', 'can', 'blue', 'ink', 'Gibson', 'story', 'way', 'look', 'Chandler', 'Marlowe', 'final', 'song', 'back', 'films', 'tradition.But', 'tricks', 'fail', 'amount', 'anything', 'significant', 'violence', 'excessive', 'Porter', 'stubbornness', 'quot', '70', '000', 'not', '130', '000', 'quot', 'annoy', 'very', 'quikly', 'director', 'invitation', 'participate', 'feat', 'gratification', 'too', 'obvious']",N/A

Mel Gibson plays the main character, a cruel thief who will do what it takes to get his money. With a cast totally formed by actors who were famous in the  seventies for these kind of pictures(like Kris Kristofferson or James  Coburn), Payback is original, and that is a lot, if we consider the trashes  that Hollywood throw into the theaters nowadays. Better than Gibson's  previous films, Payback is a violent and thrilling ride, shot with a dark,  opressive and dirty photography (what makes it seems like a seventies  crime-drama), characters that don't worth nothing (even the main character  is , in fact, a Humphrey Bogart kind of anti-hero) and a sick plot. Porter  (Gibson) hits and kills people with no significant reasons, and he seems  that he is having a lot of fun.If you are looking for something  interesting, this is a good option, but if you want a typical action flick,  with impressive adventure scenes, stay away: the action in Payback is just  basic, although very cruel and realistic.",3,good stuff for the seventies,944611200,"12 8, 1999",1999,1077,"['kind', 'movie', 'lot', 'seventies', 'classics', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'main', 'character', 'cruel', 'thief', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'get', 'money', 'cast', 'totally', 'formed', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'famous', 'seventies', 'kind', 'pictures', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Payback', 'original', 'lot', 'consider', 'trashes', 'Hollywood', 'throw', 'theaters', 'nowadays', 'Better', 'Gibson', 'previous', 'films', 'Payback', 'violent', 'thrilling', 'ride', 'shot', 'dark', 'opressive', 'dirty', 'photography', 'what', 'seventies', 'crime-drama', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'worth', 'nothing', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'fact', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'kind', 'anti-hero', 'sick', 'plot', 'Porter', 'Gibson', 'hits', 'kills', 'people', 'significant', 'reasons', 'having', 'lot', 'fun.If', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'interesting', 'good', 'option', 'want', 'typical', 'action', 'flick', 'impressive', 'adventure', 'scenes', 'stay', 'away', 'action', 'Payback', 'just', 'basic', 'very', 'cruel', 'realistic']",N/A

Theatrical version for years on endit's one of my favourite action thrillerswhich Brian Helgeland is credited as Director on the Theatrical version anywayBrian Helgeland was the original Director for PAYBACK cause he also wrote the whole scriptafter the films first screening with studio executives previewing the filmWarner bros had arguments with Brian about the last 15-20mins of the filmso Brian was firedthere is a new interview with Biran Helgeland on this blu-ray he talks all about itso he was fired even thou he directed 86mins of the film,a new Director was brought in to re-shoot the last 15mins of the filmwhich are mainly the scenes with Chris Kristophersonthis new Directors cut version which is mainly Brian's vision of how he wanted to Direct the filmBrian's first cut about 86minsis very similar to the Theatrical version you wouldn't know it to be the Directors cutuntil the last 15mins of the film where all the scenes are differentthe first 1 hour 10mins of the film is pretty much the same scenes as the Theatrical versionexcept for one scene between Mel Gibson and Deborah kara ungerwhere Mel's character gives his wife a beating in the kitchen of their apartmentpretty violent scene aswell, Deborah got injured during the scenethere is also some scenes that are exactly the same as the Theatrical versionbut different Dialoguethe Music score is also different and there is no voiceover narration by Mel Gibsonthis new 15mins ending of the film is very very interestingthe Head boss of the syndicate (Bronson) does not show his face at allonly Bronson's voice is heard on the telephone which is a woman's voice telling porter that he's Dead manthe final confrontation takes place at a train station, massive showdown, lots of bullets firedi don't want to give to much away you have to watch this new cut to find out yourselfi enjoy watching both versions actuallythe first 70mins of the film is very similar to the Theatrical version anywaybut there is no voice over narration by Mel Gibson in this new Directors cutand there is a whole new music score, orchestral score actually throughout the whole filmthere is also 1 or 2 scenes that were not in the Theatrical cutMel Gibson's character beating up his wife in the kitchen and Rosie's Dog gets shot and killed by Valplus there are a few scenes with different Dialogue aswellbut the rest of the 70mins are the same as the Theatrical cut,so your only watching the last 15mins of the film to see the difference between the 2 filmsalso this new Directors cut print is different screen colour compared to the theatrical cutthe Directors cut is more Bright coloured where is the Theatrical cut is more Dark coloured navy tintedso there's another difference between this new Directors cut and the Theatrical cutThere is also new special features for this new Directors cutan all new 30mins interview with Brian Helgeland and Mel Gibson about the Directors cut versionthere's also a new Behind the scenes Documentary, on the set footage,about 1 hours worth of interviews with the cast and crewplus a new Audio commentary with Brian Helgelandso i like watching both versions myselfthis U.S. blu-ray version only has the Directors cut, does not have theatrical version aswellit's anybody's guess why that isbut very strange is that the U.K. blu-ray release of Payback has both versionswith all the special features with itwhich does not make sense to me why the U.K.  release has both versionsand the U.S. release only has the Directors cutthe U.K. blu-ray of PAYBACK is available to buy from amazon u.k.with both versions in High Definition Widescreenso it's up to you, if you want both versions then buy the U.K. blu-ray releasefrom amazon uk, according to the amazon listing the blu-ray is ALL

It makes me think of his first two MAD MAX films or BRAVEHEART. His Porter character is that same unstoppable hero / anti-hero that Gibson plays so effortlessly. The plot is fairly basic noir- Porter is double-crossed, shot, and left for dead. He refuses to expire, leading to his hunt for those who betrayed him THE END.- However, Gibson gives Porter a human quality that bleeds through his hardened, ruthless exterior. He is righteous in his quest, even when commiting cold-blooded murder. Of course, it helps that most of the badguys he's after are reprehensible in every way! Porter's universe is populated by thugs, junkies, whores, killers, corrupt cops, sadists, psychos, and a seemingly omnipotent crime syndicate... er, I mean outfit. Porter must slay his way through it's minions in order to receive satisfaction. He is absolutely driven and set on one goal. He is MAD MAX in a suit!

Still, I imagine most people who can tolerate a gritty action flick will enjoy this version.The director's cut removes Mel Gibson's voiceover, changes the soundtrack and film quality (from blue-filter to saturated & slightly grainy), and completely re-does the ending. It's a little less flashy, but a hell of a lot grittier and truer to the real style of the movie and the book that inspired it.Porter's character isn't an evil one -- he's just devoid of the sense of 'morality' that most people have. Crime -- including murder -- is just a means to an end (money). Cold, calculating, callous, even brutal at times, Porter still draws viewers in. He's a great anti-hero. He's got his own, almost alien sense of ethics and this version really does his character more justice than the theatrical version.This is NOT your silly PG-13 action-comedy flick, where guys dodge bullets, crack jokes, and slip on banana peels in the midst of drawn-out gunbattles. This is a hardcore movie. Porter beats on his ex-wife, murders strangers without expression, and offers very little comic relief.In my opinion, this is Mel Gibson's 'coolest' role.

This is after stealing money from some Triads.  The rest of the movie involves Porter trying to get his money back ($70 000).  Naturally, some people need to be shot, blown up, beat up, etc. for this to happen.  Because Porter is a thief and a killer, the movie has a dark, anti-hero kind of tone.  Adding to the atmosphere is the fact that everyone wears black or grey, there always seems to be steam coming up from the sewers, and the building are all drab and dirty.I enjoyed this movie, and was struck by the quality of the performances, and the fact that a lot of big names are involved.  Of special note are Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn as two of the bad guys, and Lucy Lui as a dominatrix and member of the Triads (even when dressed in leather bikini and fishnet stockings, you had to take her more seriously than in Charlie's Angels).  In addition, suberb performances are put forward by Mel and Maria Bello (why, oh why would she associate herself with Coyote Ugly?!).  The action scenes are well done, and unlike the Lethal Weapon movies, the abuse that Mel's body survives is almost believable.  It is also quite funny, in a wry, ironic way (like when Coburn's character complains that Mel shot a hole in his suits - &quot;That's just mean!&quot;).However, there's nothing really special about the film.  It's just a bunch of stuff that happens, and it doens't really stand out in my mind over other action movies of the same sort.  In addition, the DVD edition is very disappointing.  There are no extras (except the trailers, and a &quot;Making of&quot; featurette that's nothing more than a glorified trailer), no director's commentary, etc.  Very low value for the money - just get the tape for 1/3 the price.",3,"Good performances, good action, but not a spectacular effort",993513600,"06 26, 2001",2001,1856,"['quickly', 'summarise', 'plot', 'main', 'character', 'Porter', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'shot', 'friend', 'wife', 'left', 'dead', 'stealing', 'money', 'Triads', 'rest', 'movie', 'Porter', 'trying', 'get', 'money', 'back', '70', '000', 'Naturally', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'shot', 'blown', 'up', 'beat', 'up', 'etc', 'happen', 'Porter', 'thief', 'killer', 'movie', 'dark', 'anti-hero', 'kind', 'tone', 'Adding', 'atmosphere', 'fact', 'everyone', 'black', 'grey', 'always', 'be', 'steam', 'coming', 'up', 'sewers', 'building', 'are', 'drab', 'dirty.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'struck', 'quality', 'performances', 'fact', 'lot', 'big', 'names', 'are', 'involved', 'special', 'note', 'are', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'James', 'Coburn', 'two', 'bad', 'guys', 'Lucy', 'Lui', 'dominatrix', 'member', 'Triads', 'even', 'when', 'dressed', 'leather', 'bikini', 'fishnet', 'stockings', 'had', 'take', 'more', 'seriously', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'addition', 'suberb', 'performances', 'are', 'put', 'forward', 'Mel', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'would', 'associate', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'movies', 'abuse', 'Mel', 'body', 'almost', 'believable', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'wry', 'ironic', 'way', 'when', 'Coburn', 'character', 'Mel', 'shot', 'hole', 'suits', 'quot', 'just', 'mean', 'quot', '.However', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'film', 'just', 'bunch', 'stuff', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'same', 'sort', 'addition', 'DVD', 'edition', 'very', 'disappointing', 'are', 'extras', 'trailers', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorified', 'trailer', 'director', 'commentary', 'etc', 'Very', 'low', 'value', 'money', 'just', 'get', 'tape', '1/3', 'price']",N/A

This movie is about  treachery, murder and revenge.  Even though you don't see any shots of cell phones or computer screens, it's still a well made movie and doesn't appear dated. Gibson plays a con man and pick pocket who'll even steal from a beggar on the street. Gibson and another one of his hoodlum buddies arrange a heist of an rival Asian gang of thugs' receipts and succeeds without a hitch.  But Gibson's partner pulls a double cross along with Gibson's wife and shoots him in the back, leaving him for dead, taking his share of the money.  Gibson somehow survives, but wants his money back.  He goes out to get it. Along the way, he encounters some dirty cops who are shaking down the criminals, a mafia boss or two, the one that double crossed him, and eventually the head of the syndicate.  Gibson is a sort of an anti hero, even though he's a crook himself, he's not as bad as the others and you'll be pulling for him all the way.

The supporting cast attacks thier various roles as typical noir sleazebags and scuzzbuckets with an amusingly gleeful relish. The finale strains credibility, but after all, its only a movie. The performances,a certain amount of atmosphere and the sparse, tough, wiseguy Raymond Chandler style dialogue ultimately keep the film afloat.

Mel Gibson's relentless pursuit of the money he was cheated out of (money which he stole in the first place) includes some brutal and stomach-churning incidents. One scene in particular, which involves Gibson and a low-life who must have regreted the day he had a nose-ring fitted, is so shocking that you've just got to laugh. Gibson could never have been expected to play the role of Porter as coldly as Lee Marvin (as Parker) did in Point Blank, the 60s thriller that Payback updates. To those that criticise Gibson for this, my response is that his talent as a comic actor far outweigh Marvin's, and as much as I enjoyed Point Blank, I found Gibson's Porter to be a much more watchable character, one who entertained me more than Marvin's character. Gibson delivers a performance that was reminiscent of Steve McQueen: slightly emotionally detached from the chaos that played around him, but always in control.

He proceeds to steal some cash for a road stake and work his way back through a collection of crime syndicate leaders, an Asian drug gang, and a couple of corrupt cops to get to his old partner and the money that is owed to him.Along the way, Porter loses his unfaithful wife to a drug overdose; gets pushed around, beaten and tortured by various heavies; and finds an old girlfriend, a prostitute played with heart-of-gold charm by Maria Bello.  His persistent willingness to be just as vicious and tough as his adversaries causes the violence to escalate to a final all or nothing confrontation with the syndicate head, played with especially chilling menance by Kris Christoferson.""Payback"" is an extremely violent movie, and Gibson's character, a classic anti-hero, could easily have become unlikeable.

After re-reading the book after thitysomething years I realize that Lee Marvin,who was cast as Parker in an earlier movie, was probably cast as a truer version of Parker.  Danny DeVito would have been a good messenger and James Gandolfini, of Supranos fame, would have made a better Mal Resnick. The ending was changed for the movie, but what the hey, that's Hollywood.  I think I'll reread all of the Parker books as my next project if I can get hold of them.  They're that good.I think Sam Elliott would make a great Parker.

Porter doesn't take crap from anybody. Gibson played it  as the strong silent type. Speak rarely, and back it up when you do.I  have to appreciate any movie that has Kristofferson in it. Who knew he was  such a movie great? He added a nice touch as the top dog of &quot;The  Outfit&quot;. Lucy Liu comes on strong as a dominatrix with a nasty  attitude that puts a thorn in Porter's side.The movie has a dark feel to  it that I feel adds to it's impact. Some comedy is thrown in to lighten the  mood, and does it's job well. The idea of working from a point of  principals plays a major role in the movie as the money factor gets blown  out of proportion by everyone but Porter.

A hold up turns too small for one of the two gangsters who wants to get rid of the other and uses this other's girlfriend to do the bad work in his own back. But in this world there is always a comeback and then a payback and the payback is always proportional to the distance to catch up on the comeback journey, and when it is near death that was the starting point of this comeback you can be sure the payback will implicate a lot of money and a lot of metal. And it does and it is not that easy to go to the top of the drug dealing business, and that sure is not easy and there are many hurdles. We wonder why he got down in front of the last one, or is it a way to really trap the boss. But he is also a very creative hit man in his come back and he pays back a lot with the metal, explosive and guns of those he shot down or he wants to bring down. He is flexible, adaptable, opportunistic and his principle is not to hit higher than the top but to hit the top just to get his due and he gets it and he does not have to share in the end. That's what is good in this gangster film. The gangster really gets our hearts in his hands because he is just asking for justice from his fellow gangsters who don't seem to have any sense of justice, nor the few cops he comes across either.

I guess they say bad guy because he's a robber...but he has feelings and he is funny. The story is EXTREMELY SIMPLE; a guy steals 14000 dollars and his associate(allied with Porter's wife) and the associate(which is one ofTHE BAD GUYS of the film)shoots Porter and thinks he is dead. And later, Porter steals a guy's wallet, buys a gun and goes back in town to get his money back(and kill his associate by the way). Like I said, Payback's good point is the characters, not the story. The scenario is cool and funny, and the atmosphere is creepy. I think this is a remake of the movie Point Blank, that was great too.

In the form of a very well done flashback about a robbery with his partner in crime and a wife who drives the getaway car, you learn what brought him to this point.  Well, his best buddy has managed to turn his wife against him, so when they go to an isolated area to split up the money he is double-crossed by his wife and his friend, shot in the back and left for dead.  Hence begins the movie with all its action.  Porter decides that it is literally payback time and goes after his friend, then after the Organization (the mob) to get his money.

But the film turns out pretty well in the end.Despite the fact Mel Gibson isn't ageing too well, since his days as Mad Max, and the constant cigarette in hand (I was told I wouldn't like this movie due to this), if you can ignore the cigarette, then the film passes quickly. If you want to call Mel all the names under the sun because he's stupid to be ruining his looks by smoking, then you'll probably want to punch the screen every time he smokes. I dread to think how many cigarettes he smoked during production. And poor Maria Bello had to kiss him. Ugh.The use of guns in this movie is quite shocking, every character seems to have at least one gun, and while Lucy Liu (credited as Lucy Alexis Liu) evens it out by doing her high kicks, it's just pure violence at its best. (Including some very surprising scenes between Lucy Liu and the bad guy - that's supposed to turn people on, beating the daylights out of each other?! Right) There are some scenes, especially towards the end, which will definitely give you flashbacks to Braveheart. You expect Mel to yell ""Freedom"" at any moment! Think this little piggy went to market, and you'll be curling your toes, until they're meeting your ankles.In the first few minutes of the movie, he has stolen from a 'crippled' Vietnam veteran, pickpocketed a man's wallet, stiffed a waitress, and used the said credit card to buy a nice fancy suit, a gun, and dinner. Later, when his meal is over, a waiter informs him the credit card he is trying to pay with has been canceled. ""Nonsense,"" Porter says. ""Try it again."" The waiter then leaves and so does Porter. (Can't they trace him?) Mel does some voice over in the movie, in one of the most sadistic voices I've ever heard.The movie's very dark, and it's a surprise to see such a cheery character as Maria Bello (best known to me as Lil from Coyote Ugly, although the long hair put me off from recognising her).

To the director's cut credit, we always thought the kidnapping part of the rich son was stupid. So we watched this D.C. last night and we were both disappointed. My problem w/ the d.c. is that eliminates a lot of the dark humor. The new score is a more serious one which doesn't mix well with the exsiting parts that were funny or the subtle things all the actors did to give it a ""smart-a**"" feel. The new voice over for Kris Kristoffersen's character, Bronson, is done by a woman. The new scene with William Devane (Jack Bauer's nemesis) & Porter on the phone with Bronson, doesn't work for me. She sounds like grandma acting ticked off rather than a ""head boss"".  A trash talking Kris Kristoffersen was better than that ""phone in"". It gets dumber when she's on speakerphone w/ James Coburn. She's says Porter has hit the ""end of the road"" and will go nowhere in one breath. Then Porter shoots the alligator bags while Bronson thinks it was Fairfax and then in the next breath, she just gives in and says Ok, you win pretty much.  Again, another ""smart-a**"" Porter part they cut was the toe torture scene.The ending is totally different. I didn't mind the newer one but it was the ""everyday"" shootout. I miss the old phone trick, him blowing the car up with ciggy, digging the bullets out of his back and ""fata-boy"".

Anyway, when it comes to playing tough guys, Mel Gibson usually manages to remain a good guy, no matter how violent, psychotic, or barbaric his character. After all those years of playing a nice guy, he finally has a chance to play something different. In Payback, Mel is one of the bad guys, but make no mistake, he is still the hero. Gibson plays a robber named Porter, who at the start of the story is having bullets surgically removed from his back. It seems like an occupational hazard. Play for the bad guys long enough, and eventually you will wind up regretting it. However, as Porter tells us, five months of lying around did not exactly change his disposition. If anything, it made him angry.Porter, now healed and fueled by thoughts of revenge, attempts to find his partner, Val and retrieve the $70,000 stolen from him. There is no finesse, greasing of palms, or clever detective work. Porter is not a subtle man. Once he gets a lead, he follows it, heedless of the danger or the people who are members of a syndicate known as ""the Outfit"" that he is confronting. There is desperation in every play Porter makes, as if he does not care if he lives or dies any more. His wife has overdosed on heroine. His former lover, Rosie is a hooker. Two crooked cops are watching every move he makes, determined to steal the money from him if he can find it. In addition, to make matters worse, Val has told the Japanese gangsters from whom they stole the money that Porter was behind the whole thing.Finally, this is a Hollywood movie which is always think about box-office power, and always main character is superhuman, nice and has all good things. Sometimes it is very unrealistic and childish like this film. Mel Gibson, actually he play an ill-matched character in this film. It is an uninteresting film except some interesting casting. For example, James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson who usually had played in Action movies. Deborah Unger, she played in &iexcl;Crash (1996)&iexcl;. She was very impressive.

This version of the film is far more streamlined and features the original ending, along with a completely revised third act, new scenes, a new head villain, new score and is essentially a different film.Based on the The Hunter, the first novel in Richard Stark's acclaimed ""Parker"" series; the story is about Parker (renamed Porter in the film)  and his single minded mission to retrieve his $70,000 share of the take from an armed robbery, where he was left for dead by his partner Val, aided by Porter's drug addled wife. To make matters worse, Val has turned Porter's share over to the Outfit, a national crime syndicate Val is trying to curry favor with after botching a job for them.Mel Gibson is great as Porter. He plays it straight and seems to understand the streamlined, all business nature of the character. The film is peppered with great performances, with standout supporting roles from David Paymer, William Devane, James Coburn and Gregg Henry, who's role as Val Resnik should have made him a star.My complaints about the film would be the relationship Porter has with Maria Bello's character. Porter as a driver for a prostitute just seems out of left field. He is an armed robber. Period. Why would he need to drive around a prostitute? for the extra pocket money? This also made him an Outfit employee, something his independent streak would never allow.I also hate the fact that the main character's name is changed from that of his litratery counterpart. Trying to make this movie a standalone affair, rather than opening the door to seeing Parker in more movies based on Stark's other books shows a lack of ambition on the part of the film makers, but then again, this is more about Helgeland's cinematic vision rather than adapting a beloved novel.The special features are just that; special. The director's commentary is insightful and entertaining and hints at why the main character's name was changes from Parker to Porter for the film; which was a big mystery to me. Mel Gibson sits for an interview and gives his side of the story as to why the Director's vision was scuttled in favor of a more audiance friendly version of the film. Even the mini documentary on the revised music score is insightful and entertaining, and highlights the 60's noir theme of the film which imporves on the original.There is also a brief interview with Novelist Donald E. Westlake, who wrote the Parker novels of the 60's and 70's (as well as the 90's revival under the pen name Richard Stark - check them out!) . You may be interested to know that Parker was featured in 7 films altogether over the last five decades, played by Lee Marvin (Point Blank), Robert Duvall (The Outfit), Jim Brown (The Split) and even by a woman in European film entitled Made in the USA. Each film version never faithful to the novel it was based upon, and the main character never named Parker as the author would not allow it unless a serious effort to make a faithful movie was undertaken (or so I am told).Watch this version of the film, it's worth your time.",5,Far better than the Theatrical Version,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,3146,"['nine', 'years', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'film', 'director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'originally', 'intended', 'version', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'streamlined', 'original', 'ending', 'completely', 'revised', 'third', 'act', 'new', 'scenes', 'new', 'head', 'villain', 'new', 'score', 'essentially', 'different', 'film.Based', 'Hunter', 'first', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'acclaimed', 'Parker', 'series', 'story', 'Parker', 'renamed', 'Porter', 'film', 'single', 'minded', 'mission', 'retrieve', '70,000', 'share', 'take', 'armed', 'robbery', 'where', 'was', 'left', 'dead', 'partner', 'Val', 'aided', 'Porter', 'drug', 'addled', 'wife', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Val', 'turned', 'Porter', 'share', 'Outfit', 'national', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Val', 'trying', 'curry', 'favor', 'botching', 'job', 'them.Mel', 'Gibson', 'great', 'Porter', 'straight', 'understand', 'streamlined', 'business', 'nature', 'character', 'film', 'peppered', 'great', 'performances', 'standout', 'supporting', 'roles', 'David', 'Paymer', 'William', 'Devane', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Gregg', 'Henry', 'who', 'role', 'Val', 'Resnik', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'star.My', 'complaints', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'relationship', 'Porter', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'character', 'Porter', 'driver', 'prostitute', 'just', 'left', 'field', 'armed', 'robber', 'Period', 'Why', 'would', 'need', 'drive', 'around', 'prostitute', 'extra', 'pocket', 'money', 'also', 'made', 'Outfit', 'employee', 'something', 'independent', 'streak', 'would', 'never', 'allow.I', 'also', 'hate', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'changed', 'litratery', 'counterpart', 'Trying', 'make', 'movie', 'standalone', 'affair', 'rather', 'opening', 'door', 'seeing', 'Parker', 'more', 'movies', 'based', 'Stark', 'other', 'books', 'lack', 'ambition', 'part', 'film', 'makers', 'then', 'again', 'more', 'Helgeland', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'rather', 'adapting', 'beloved', 'novel.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'special', 'director', 'commentary', 'insightful', 'entertaining', 'hints', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'was', 'changes', 'Parker', 'Porter', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'mystery', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'interview', 'side', 'story', 'why', 'Director', 'vision', 'was', 'scuttled', 'favor', 'more', 'audiance', 'friendly', 'version', 'film', 'Even', 'mini', 'documentary', 'revised', 'music', 'score', 'insightful', 'entertaining', '60', 'noir', 'theme', 'film', 'original.There', 'also', 'brief', 'interview', 'Novelist', 'Donald', 'E.', 'Westlake', 'who', 'wrote', 'Parker', 'novels', '60', '70', 'as', 'well', '90', 'revival', 'pen', 'name', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'check', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'Parker', 'was', 'featured', '7', 'films', 'altogether', 'last', 'five', 'decades', 'played', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Point', 'Blank', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Outfit', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Split', 'even', 'woman', 'European', 'film', 'entitled', 'Made', 'USA', 'film', 'version', 'never', 'faithful', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'named', 'Parker', 'author', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'serious', 'effort', 'make', 'faithful', 'movie', 'was', 'undertaken', 'so', 'am', 'told', '.Watch', 'version', 'film', 'time']",N/A

505979,A25XGZX0YRTJKN,B00000JDIQ,Paul J. Moade,"[1, 4]","This review concerns the orignal movie ... not the director's cut.****************************This is sort of an off-beat movie for Mel where he plays a tough guy who worked for the mob (the Outfit) along with high cost prostitute and later, girlfriend Rosie (Maria Bello).You'll notice when viewing the movie that there are no ""good guys"". Everyone is either in the Mob, part of the mob apparatus or corupt (like the two detectives who hound Porter). This lends the movie a different flavor than Mel's other productions ... but not necessarily in a bad way. As a matter of fact, Mel does an outstanding job in acting and the film is very entertaining (although the Outfit is pretty small in numbers for as much power as it's supposed to have).The entire screen play revolves around $70,000 dollars that represents Porter's (Mel Gibson) share of a heist from a gang of orientals who run an unspecified racket. Porter plans on stealing the weekly take of the oriental gang with a former member of the Outfit and sadist, Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). While the robbery comes off without a hitch, Resnick has conspired with Porter's wife to kill him (Mrs Porter found a picture of her husband with prostitute Rosie) and to take all of the stolen loot. Porter is shot in the back several times by his wife who then leaves with Resnick. From here, the story begins ...Resnick, who had a falling out with the Outfit, needs $130,000 to get back in good with them. The heist from the oriental gang provides $140,000, thus Resnick takes his partner's split and pays off the Outfit. Porter manages to survive the shooting by his wife and then embarks on a quest, after recuperating from his wounds, to get his share of the stolen money back. In doing this, he meets up with a weaselly pusher, a wimpy drug distributor, two corrupt detectives, a host of hitmen and a couple of ranking personalities from the Outfit.He hunts down his former partner, Resnick only to find that Val no longer has the stolen money ... he has already given it to the Outfit. Porter roughs Val up a bit and serves him an ultimatum, get me my share of the money. Resnick agrees, but plans to trap Porter using the gang who was the victim of the original heist. Porter survives the meeting and runs down Resnick ... then proceeds to try and get the Outfit to give him the $70,000 that Resnick stole from him.You can guess the Outfit's response, and so Porter begins a campaign against the leadership to force them to give up the cash.The action of the film is very good and Gibson plays a very convincing button man (he was the driver for and protector of prostitute, Rosie). The mobsters are somewhat comic and it is not real convincing that Porter could get to them so easily, nor that so few personel would be in the organization; but that really doesn't detract from the film.The background music is dark as is the plot (everyone is a gangster or corrupt), but on the whole, the film is very enjoyable to watch, although not believable. This because the Outfit is not far reaching (it represents organized crime) and is easily defeated by killing three key men.Transfer to DVD is sharp and clear and the audio/soundtrack is clear and vibrant. All in all, a worthwhile DVD. I'd recommend this for folks from, say, eight and up. Not that there is much blood or nudity (actually, no nudity), but simply because the younger audience simply would not understand what's going on. The film also tends to have a bit more violence in it than I would recommend subjecting a younger person to.Heartily Recommended.Once again, be sure of the movie that you buy. I haven't seen the ""Director's Cut"" version myself, but there are enough reviews here mentioning it to convince me that it is a chopped up, poorer version of this film.~P~",4,Mel a little different than we know him ...,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,3786,"['review', 'orignal', 'movie', 'not', 'director', 'cut', '****************************This', 'sort', 'off-beat', 'movie', 'Mel', 'where', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'worked', 'mob', 'Outfit', 'high', 'cost', 'prostitute', 'later', 'girlfriend', 'Rosie', 'Maria', 'Bello', '.You', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'when', 'viewing', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'Everyone', 'either', 'Mob', 'part', 'mob', 'apparatus', 'corupt', 'two', 'detectives', 'who', 'hound', 'Porter', 'movie', 'different', 'flavor', 'Mel', 'other', 'productions', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'way', 'matter', 'fact', 'Mel', 'outstanding', 'job', 'acting', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Outfit', 'pretty', 'small', 'numbers', 'as', 'much', 'power', 'supposed', 'have', '.The', 'entire', 'screen', 'play', '70,000', 'dollars', 'Porter', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'share', 'heist', 'gang', 'orientals', 'who', 'run', 'unspecified', 'racket', 'Porter', 'stealing', 'weekly', 'take', 'oriental', 'gang', 'former', 'member', 'Outfit', 'sadist', 'Val', 'Resnick', 'Gregg', 'Henry', 'robbery', 'off', 'hitch', 'Resnick', 'conspired', 'Porter', 'wife', 'kill', 'Mrs', 'Porter', 'found', 'picture', 'husband', 'prostitute', 'Rosie', 'take', 'stolen', 'loot', 'Porter', 'shot', 'back', 'several', 'times', 'wife', 'who', 'then', 'Resnick', 'here', 'story', 'Resnick', 'who', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'Outfit', '130,000', 'get', 'back', 'good', 'heist', 'oriental', 'gang', '140,000', 'thus', 'Resnick', 'partner', 'split', 'Outfit', 'Porter', 'survive', 'shooting', 'wife', 'then', 'embarks', 'quest', 'recuperating', 'wounds', 'get', 'share', 'stolen', 'money', 'back', 'doing', 'up', 'weaselly', 'pusher', 'wimpy', 'drug', 'distributor', 'two', 'corrupt', 'detectives', 'host', 'hitmen', 'couple', 'ranking', 'personalities', 'Outfit.He', 'hunts', 'down', 'former', 'partner', 'Resnick', 'only', 'find', 'Val', 'no', 'longer', 'stolen', 'money', 'already', 'given', 'Outfit', 'Porter', 'Val', 'up', 'bit', 'ultimatum', 'get', 'share', 'money', 'Resnick', 'plans', 'trap', 'Porter', 'using', 'gang', 'who', 'was', 'victim', 'original', 'heist', 'Porter', 'meeting', 'down', 'Resnick', 'then', 'proceeds', 'try', 'get', 'Outfit', 'give', '70,000', 'Resnick', 'stole', 'him.You', 'can', 'guess', 'Outfit', 'response', 'so', 'Porter', 'campaign', 'leadership', 'force', 'give', 'up', 'cash.The', 'action', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'Gibson', 'very', 'convincing', 'button', 'man', 'was', 'driver', 'protector', 'prostitute', 'Rosie', 'mobsters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'comic', 'not', 'real', 'convincing', 'Porter', 'could', 'get', 'so', 'easily', 'so', 'few', 'personel', 'would', 'be', 'organization', 'really', ""n't"", 'detract', 'film.The', 'background', 'music', 'dark', 'plot', 'everyone', 'gangster', 'corrupt', 'whole', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'not', 'believable', 'Outfit', 'not', 'far', 'reaching', 'organized', 'crime', 'easily', 'defeated', 'killing', 'three', 'key', 'men.Transfer', 'DVD', 'sharp', 'clear', 'audio/soundtrack', 'clear', 'vibrant', 'worthwhile', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'folks', 'say', 'eight', 'up', 'Not', 'much', 'blood', 'nudity', 'actually', 'nudity', 'simply', 'younger', 'audience', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'violence', 'would', 'recommend', 'subjecting', 'younger', 'person', 'to.Heartily', 'Recommended.Once', 'again', 'be', 'sure', 'movie', 'buy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Director', 'Cut', 'version', 'are', 'enough', 'reviews', 'here', 'mentioning', 'convince', 'chopped', 'up', 'poorer', 'version', 'film.~P~']",N/A

Crawford,"[1, 2]","This is a wonderful combination:  the theatrical release and the director's cut, all in super clear blu-ray.The story is about Porter, an extremely tough guy who comes back from a presumed death to seek revenge.  Because he was ripped off $70K from a heist - shot for his share - he comes back demanding to get that back.  He starts off with absolutely nothing and claws his way back with a grim nonchalance.  Any resistance he meets results in cold murder.  The perpetrators are first, but when he fails to get satisfaction from them, he goes to who got the payoff.  Along the way, he contends with a wonderful roster of quirky characters, from a hooker he used to love to a S&M; call girl (Lucy Liu in a classic cameo), dirty cops, and dripping, petty criminals.  It is as hilarious as it is horrifying and completely entertaining.I must confess that I preferred the theatrical version.  It is cleaner, less ambiguous at the end, and Gibson's narration is delivered with the chilling boredom of a sociopath.  However, with the ending of the Director's cut and no narration, it is a different, far more intelligent, film and ultimately a great pleasure as well.  The director's cut expects more from the viewer, who must figure out what is going on.  I will say no more so as not to play the spoiler.Now that I have watched this several times, it does feel a bit stylized, but the superlative acting more than makes up for it.  It is filmed with the emotional tone of film noire, but in color - quite a feat.  The director's cut is brighter.  Very interesting to contrast them.  There are also good extras included on how both versions were made.  This is destined to be a cult classic.This version is available in Europe, though it is region-free.

505988,A34DPXEGCFNZF4,B00000JDIQ,Rock,"[0, 2]","...I am a rather emphatic Mel Gibson fan. But, I think this movie could have been better if Mel had just been a little more trusting in the moviegoing public, and gone the whole nine yards with the ruthlessness of his character. Perfect example: Stegman: ""You're not gonna kill me, are ya?"" Porter: ""Well, not in front of these kids."" WHAT??? The character I know, Parker from the Westlake novels; Parker, the ruthless ice-cold professional embodied by Lee Marvin in ""Point Blank""; he would've bitchslapped Porter for even thinking ""Not-in-front-of-these-kids"" and kicked him to the curb. Unnecessary heroism aside, this a pretty good movie, with Mel as the irrepressible, slightly off-center goofball he's played in all his crowd-pleasers, but tightened up a notch here. Aside from him, the other main strength is the great ensemble: James Coburn, David Paymer, Bill Duke, Kris Kristofferson, Maria Bello, and Bill Devane.

Saw it was coming on one of my movie channels & was looking forward to adding it my DVR to watch over & over I liked it so much.I noticed right off the bat that something was 'odd' & as the movie went on, it was obvious this was not the same 'Payback' I LOVED.Now I see why. The version that came on was indeed the 'newer & re-done DC' Version & all I can say is it SUCKED.It wasn't even the same movie. I see up above in the description that they claim this is a far better version.NOPE. No friggin way.......They took a 5 star movie & TRASHED IT. Some may have liked it as everybody has different tastes, but imo, they RUINED this movie. If I could give the DC version negative stars I would, but it will only allow me to use 1 star & just to be clear, it kisnt even worth that 1 star.The original was GREAT...This version absolutely sucked & was changed so drastically, it literally is a different movie.Way to go Hollywood. If it aint broke you still try to fix it & end up breaking it in the process.100% disappointed in this version.....I mean sheez..they removed ALL the stuff that made this the GREAT 5 STAR flick it was & turned it in to unwatchable TRASH.So for those reading, I give the original version 5 stars all the way & would give this negative 10 stars if I could.

Marvin's love interest is Angie Dickinson. In the 1967 version, Dickinson is not a call girl, but Walker's sister-in-law who runs a night club. She has unresolved ties with the syndicate that Walker is after. POINT BLANK is a noir film with the standard, austere production values of the late 1960s-early 1970s period. This makes the violence more realistic and brutal. Both films have very strong supporting casts. Marvin is better in the lead role and shows no hint of the humor that Gibson shows from time to time.
