1540686,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0080K2E92,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 10]","Nominated for the ""Award for Excellent Animation of the Year"" at the 33rd Japan Academy Prize and ""Best Animated Feature Film"" for the 4th Asia Pacific Screen Award, Production I.G.'s ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" (a.k.a. Hottarake no Shima: Haruka to Mah&#333; no Kagami) will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation in August 2012.Directed by Shinsuke Sato (""Gantz"" live action films and ""The Princess Blade"") and co-written by Sato and Otsuichi (""Calling You"", ""Goth"").VIDEO:""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and if there is one thing that I have raved over the years, it's about Production I.G.'s focus on quality and creating the most wonderful looking environments in an anime film or TV series.With ""Oblivion Island"", the art backgrounds are absolutely fantastic to look at it.  Artistic, very detailed, just gorgeous.  May it be the city environment in Japan to the island environment where Teo lives, everything looks spectacular and I was just in awe of how breathtaking the film looked.While the CG animation was created in 2009 and the creatures are not as highly detailed compared to an American Pixar film, in terms of skin textures and seeing pores or grime on a character, the CG is still very good, but it's the details of the backgrounds the characters are in that truly stick out the most of this animated film.There have been a good number of CG animated films from Japan, but this is probably one of the most detailed that I have seen.  The film is very colorful, vibrant and  looks absolutely incredible on Blu-ray!But is it perfect?  Well, there is a scene where Haruka meets Cotton for the first time, and there is a good amount of light being changed and you do see slight banding.  While I didn't recognize any artifacts or edge enhancement, you do notice the details on objects and even on the scenery and mechanical designs.  It's a very beautiful film and I'm in awe of how Production I.G. once again delivered for this animated film.  It looks great!AUDIO:""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" is presented in Japanese and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  Dialogue on both Japanese and English lossless tracks are crystal clear and having watched the film in both English and Japanese, both are really well-done.  The soundtracks are primarily dialogue and musical driven through the front and center channel.  There was a little LFE and surround channel use for the music but I was hoping the sound effects were a little more immersive and utilized the surround channels a bit more.  But for the most part, the lossless soundtrack was very good.As for the subtitles, when the Japanese soundtrack is selected, English subtitles show up.  So, the English subtitles are not optional during the Japanese soundtrack.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" comes with the following special features:Behind the Scenes of Oblivion Island - (5:02) A featurette on what inspired the film and what it is about.  Information on the director and Japanese cast.A Visit to Fushimi Inari Shrine - (5:13) Voice actress Haruka Ayase visiting the Fushimi Inari Shrine which inspired the animated film ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"".Battleship Island: An Actual Oblivion Island - Voice actress Haruka Ayase and director Shinsuke Sato visiting a Gunkanjima, which are uninhabited islands in Japan, specifically Hashima Island in Nagasaki Prefecture.  A island that was once used for forced labor for coal mining during the late 1800&#8242;s to early-to-mid 1900&#8242;s but is now a ""ghost island"" with building structures that were left behind in 1950 when Japan went towards petroleum and away from coal.Greetings at the Premiere - (4:47) The press speeches from director Shinsuke Sato and the Japanese voice acting cast for the premiere.A Word from the Cast - (4:39) Q&A; with director Shinsuke Sato and the Japanese voice acting cast after the premiere.The U.S. Premiere - (8:00) Naoyoshi Shiotani (direction) talking about the U.S. premiere of ""Oblivion Island"" in New York and footage from the New York premiere.Haruka and Teo's Panel Puzzle - (4:07) A featurette at Izumo Iwai Shrine in Iruma City, Saitama and the Haruka and Teo puzzles that kids including Fuji TV announcer Mio Matsumura have to put together.A Journey Through Fox Foxlore - (25:43) A TV special exploring the fox legends in Japan.Sierra Leone Relief Spots - (:34) Two commercials featuring the collaboration with ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" and helping the children of Sierra Leone.Original Teasers - (1:40) The original Japanese teaser trailers for ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"".Original Trailers - (3:09) The original Japanese trailers for ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"".TV Commercials - (3:20) The original Japanese commercials for ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"".U.S. Trailer - FUNimation trailer for ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"".Trailers - FUNimation trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:A delightful animated family film from Japan, gorgeous in visuals and a heartwarming tale that will surely entertain people of all ages.""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" is a film that was inspired by the Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto and the Inari shrine is one of the most unique shrines in Japan with its black and red torii path.  Inari in Japan is known as the god of rice and many adults visit the shrine for wealth.  At the main gate of the shrine is a fox holding a key in its mouth.  Meanwhile, the view of the shrine is like a mirror.And so, writers Hirotaka Adachi and director Shinsuke Sato came up with a story inspired by the shrine but a story that would appeal to people of all ages and to focus on the question of what happens to those things in our childhood that are lost.  What happens to them?And both Adachi and Sato were able to come up with a delightful story of Japanese mythology and childhood memories for ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"".For many adults, when we think of our childhoods, many of us tend to remember our favorite toys or favorite things while growing up.  Toys that your parents bought you or things that were special in your life.  And what makes ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" so touching is that it revolves around a teenager who lost her mother at a young age.And because her father was dependent on her mother, having grown up with a father (a single parent) who had to work a lot, she never really understood the sacrifices her father went through to take of her and in her mind, her estranged relationship with him is because he is always working and is messy.But often in our lives, by finding objects that we have forgotten about, it makes us remember things that we also had forgotten.  May it be a photo of a deceased family member, an object taking you back of a certain time in your life.  For Haruka, it's revisiting memories that she had lost.Meanwhile, there is also a story about the importance of friendship.  For Haruka to be in another world and becoming friends with Teo, for Teo and others, humans were looked as bad people, but when he finds out for himself that Haruka was genuinely good and wanted to be his friend, he has to make a hard decision by helping his new friend out or follow on the threat by the ruler of Oblivion Island that if he doesn't bring the mirror to him, he will be severely punished for bringing a human to their world.And while you get a delightful story, possibly the most impressive part of this film are its visuals.  Production I.G. is an animation studio I have raved about in previous reviews but for this film, this is one of the most beautiful CG animated films that I have watched from Japan.  Yes, Studio Ghibli are known for their beautiful visuals but Production I.G. is also wonderful at creating scenery and environments for their TV series, OVA and animated films.And for ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"", not only are environments painted beautifully and realistically but its integration with its CG characters are also well-done.  Granted, the characters are not as detailed as a Pixar animated character but still, for a 2009 animated film from Japan and having seen a good number of them, the movements are not jerky, the balance between the CG characters and the beautiful environments are well-done!I'll go as far as to say that for a non-Ghibli animated film, Production I.G. really delivered with the visual effects.  This film looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray!And the voice acting, both on the Japanese and English dub are also well-done.  Watched both and was quite pleased with both lossless soundtracks.  Granted, I wish it was a bit more immersive and the surround channels were used much more, but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is very good, dialogue and music was crystal clear.As for special features, there are many included on this release.  From the premiere introductions and Q&A; in Japan, to the visiting locations that helped inspire the film plus a TV special on fox legends of Japan. So, I was quite pleased with this Blu-ray overall.  From the visual and audio standpoint and special features that are pretty awesome!  It's an awesome Blu-ray and DVD release combo-pack that fans should be pleased with.Heartwarming, delightful and possibly one of the best looking CG animated films to come from Japan and looks absolutely incredible on Blu-ray!  ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" is another magnificent Production I.G. animated film that I highly recommend!",5,(4.5 stars) Another magnificent Production I.G. animated film that I highly recommend!,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,9655,"['Nominated', 'Award', 'Excellent', 'Animation', 'Year', '33rd', 'Japan', 'Academy', 'Prize', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'Film', '4th',

I also saw little connection with Alice in Wonderland and don't know why that reference was made.  If a comparison has to be made, try Toy Story 3 for a similar theme of lost or forgotten stuff/toys.  In this movie, they're referred to as ""neglected"" objects.  At one point, the suggestion is strongly made that if you don't keep a tight hold on everything you own it will be stolen (a set of keys in this case).The role of the scavengers in this story is not entirely clear.  Do they provide a real service or are they just thieves who later barter their goods in order to live their meager lives?  A lot of questions arise but the bulk of this movie is simply elaborate chase sequences.  There's a great deal of eye candy to be had but I found part of the animation disconcerting.  All the humans have a plastic doll-like quality to their appearance that takes a bit of getting used to.  It's as though every piece of substance in this universe is patently fake.In the end, I did like this movie, I did enjoy watching it, and yes, I'm keeping it for my collection.

1540696,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B0080K2E92,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[14, 16]","Oblivion Island is a 2009 computer-animated film released by the Japanese company, I.G. Studio.  Directed by Shinsuke Sato, it tells the story of Haruka, a teenaged girl who, while following a curious creature seen near her mother's shrine, is pulled into Oblivion Island: the land of neglected things.  It is here that she befriends a small denizen of the hidden world and begins her search for the red mirror given to her by her mother; a mirror Haruka had previously forgotten and let slip away.I'd pulled this off the shelf hoping to find a foreign equivalent to the American twin-towers of Pixar and Dreamworks.  I've always been a bit leery of Japanese computer anime out of unfamiliarity.  To begin with, I've only barely scratched the service of anime as a whole, so taking the plunge into one of its trickier sub-genres was daunting.  But Oblivion Island boasts a confident box cover and I was familiar with I.G. Studios through Ghost in the Shell series, so I dove in.  I'm glad I did.I had some concerns that the human elements of the film would be of the creepy, almost of the too-real variety, but that wasn't the case.  While the, ""real"" people weren't as exaggerated/cartoonish as what you might find in, say, Toy Story, they weren't pixels away from looking like synthetic androids, either.  Occasionally Haruka's movements would feel a little boxy and rigid, sometimes floaty, but for the most part I think it worked out.  It's the fantasy elements, however, that I found brilliant and made the movie worth watching.  The colors are spectacular, the action sequences explosive, and the cast of characters designed for the story are vibrant and masterfully crafted.  Had someone been watching me during the 100 minutes offered here, they'd have likely seen on several occasions the same sort of expressions one gets during a fireworks display.  The scenes that wowed me were stacked by the end credits and I was left satisfied.And it's a family-friendly story.  I've no children of my own, but I think a kid would be dazzled by what's happening here.  The script is simple, fun, and written in are some wildly fantastic characters, good-to-evil, in-between.  If I were to caution a parent of anything, though, it would be that there's a resounding impact from the weight of Haruka's mother's death and it's a recurring theme.  Not that this is a bad thing, per say, but the sadness is prevalent and if your child is sensitive to such a thing, there you go.After perusing the site and seeing what Oblivion Island is being sold for, I recommend it with some fervor.

1540700,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0080K2E92,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 5]","While adult themed Japanese anime have always been my preference because of their ability to bring out compelling stories, we all know that anime isn't all about such things. There are several anime titles that come as something as we've gotten to call `family themes' and director Shinsuke Sato's (Tokyo Lullaby and The Princess Blade) ""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" (Hottarake no shima - Haruka to maho no kagami) is one such anime presentation. This internationally acclaimed CGI-anime film combines Japanese folklore, traditions and storybook sensibilities that is sure to charm the young and adults alike with its ""Alice in Wonderland""-like tale of magic, forgotten memories and wonderment.16-year old Haruka (Haruka Ayase) lost her mother (Naho Toda) at a very young age. While she was still alive, Haruka received a mirror from her a keepsake. But things become forgotten when Haruka grew older, living a life alone with her father (Nao Omori) and she eventually forgets about her prized keepsake. One day she realizes that she had lost this mirror and wonders where it was. As a way to follow a folk legend, Haruka went to a shrine to pray for the return of that mirror. There is accidentally encounters a strange creature collecting `neglected things' with the name of Teo (Miyuki Sawashiro) and Haruka is whisked away to the magical world called Oblivion island where a Baron (Iemasa Kayumi) is planning an attack on the human world to create a new one that fits his needs. Haruka must recover her mirror with the aid of Teo and her forgotten toy, Cotton (Tamaki Matsumoto) and maybe try to save Oblivion Island itself...Japanese culture has a practice where they have little shrines where they can leave food and other things for their departed loved ones. It is a way for them to communicate with the spirit of the deceased and these shrines are often part of their family routine. In this anime film, while Haruka may not have a shrine for her dead mother, but the shrine in this film becomes a gateway of sorts to another alternate world. The screenplay pitches themes of forgotten memories and how we because of our busy days, find it easy to forget about the little things that used to matter. It succeeds in the delivery of its dramatic elements, and while the film maintained an energetic and upbeat tempo throughout, when it came to getting serious, the film was able to balance its devices and themes to hit a homerun with its viewer.I suppose what really made the film work is the way it developed the friendship between Haruka and Teo. Sure, some may say that it captures the formula for familiar ""Pixar"" animated features (befriend and then get estranged and then have the friendship become stronger) and while I agree, there was a certain anime signature that made the execution different from American animation. It wasn't so much as they had mature developments, but the direction was able to connect the situation with the characters and then the characters to its story. Haruka was well developed in the script; she was the perfect heroine in this kind of film. The characters felt that they sincerely felt a bond, they felt very real thanks mostly in part to the excellent Japanese voice cast. I had no issues rooting for the friendship between Teo and Haruka, the way their friendship was formed had that certain ""thing"" necessary that we can easily relate with.The world of Oblivion Island is indeed something quite fantastic. Shinsuke Sato was a video game designer-director and this serves him well in his film. From the opening sequence that came from a storybook to the set pieces that drove its animation, the film is impressive. The set designs sometimes consists of paintings and 2D backgrounds built around a 3D CGI world. The animation and the designs were excellently blended together to create this enchanting world. The designs also have that clever touches as it is a world built from ""forgotten objects"" taken from the human world (check out the hill made from skateboards and snow boards). The creature designs had been inspired by the same touches, put together by magic and junk, powered by mirrors' magical properties. There is something to said with the designs (most notably the Petitloss and the Baron), as they seemed to have been inspired by Tim Burton or something from Neil Gaiman`s fantasy creations. Take notice of the Island's realms, there is both something dark and bright about the designs that gives them a lot of personality and character. They were fantastic and clever, with the CGI animation as good as anything Pixar could probably come up with.""Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror"" is one impressive family-friendly anime feature. I was also glad to see that the film had a great message for the young and old alike as well as leaving some details that can be read into. As with most anime films, it asks the motivations and the how is left to be read into, rather than being spoon-fed the details, the viewer is left room to feel. The last act of the film was filled with emotions that every parent should have a chance to see this with their child. This is all about your prized memories and things that sparked those memories. This is what Japanese anime is all about. ""Oblivion Island"" dazzled me with its creative designs and wowed me with the way it used theatrical touches that the emotions came alive. It is no wonder that this CGI-anime feature had been critically acclaimed and won numerous animation awards.Highly Recommended!

1540701,A1JEHPPJ4475HP,B0080K2E92,W. Watson,"[0, 0]","I bought this movie about six months ago and I put it aside because I was just busy with other things. I decided to watch it with my thirteen year old daughter today. She was sitting on the couch immersed in her laptop. When the movie started it only took about ten minutes before I'd seen that she'd put her computer and her phone down and started watching it with me. That is by no means an easy feat since she's attached to her electronic devices. As a parent of a young girl, I feel that this is exactly the kind of animation that they should be making more of. I liked it because it's one of the only animations I've seen in which the girl is the central character and not dependent upon a boy or a man to play off of. Too many times we see girls portrayed as scenery rather than characters. I liked the fact that Haru was not a Polyanna or a stereotype, but closely resembled a normal sixteen year old girl in most respects. As the movie begins she struggles with her own life in a way that most can identify with, and as the movie progresses it makes you feel the emotions she's feeling right along with her. To me, that's the hallmark of good storytelling.The animation was AMAZING! I can't say enough about that. They managed to make it so that you forget that you're watching 3D Animation. I'm not really a fan of a lot of the new Disney 3D animation because they come off as too cartoony. Haruka looks like a cartoon but not overly so. I don't feel like the CGI was overdone and I feel the lush and wonderful world that was created was something really special in a way that makes me want to see more of this style.

We are great fans of Hayao Miyazaki's body of work but lately, I've been introducing my daughter to some of the other films made by other directors. Of course, given her age, I have to choose the content with care, and I'm glad I found &#34;Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror&#34;. Directed by Shinsuke Sato, the film uses 3-D animation to present a vivid story bursting with color, and featuring a cast of characters that struck me as original and refreshing.The premise is an engaging one: Haruka is an only child being raised in a single parent household. Her mother passed away when Haruka was very young, and Haruka, in her loneliness and dejection, yearns fiercely for her mother and all the comfort of being in a happy family. A chance encounter with a strange creature propels Haruka on an amazing journey into the land of lost things, where to her utter astonishment she discovers that objects abandoned or forgotten by humans are collected by creatures inhabiting another world who live on an Island controlled by the power-hungry Baron (not to be confused with the charismatic Baron from Miyazaki's films). Haruka meets Teo, a creature who initially balks at helping a human, but the two gradually form a close bond that transcends their differences.The animation is excellent as far as 3D animation goes, but what really captured my imagination as well as my daughter's was the wonderful storytelling and engaging characters. The friendship between Haruka and Teo is beautifully conveyed and each character is well-delineated. Characterization is not sacrificed at the expense of animation effects and I appreciated that. There's also an adorable character, &#34;Cotton&#34; which Haruka comes across as she searches for her mother's mirror, one of the forgotten objects taken from her world. Cotton used to be Haruka's soft toy (a sheep) but in this fantasy world, Cotton is able to speak and move, made possible by a mirror placed within it. Cotton was beloved by my daughter who felt it embodied all the comfort and love children derive from a precious childhood toy. The villain, Baron, is aptly portrayed as an egotistical maniac out to prevent Haruka from getting her mirror, due to the power he considers it to possess.Watching this film reminded me of certain aspects of Miyazaki's films. The Baron's flying abode for example, was reminiscent of Howl's moving castle in the film of the same name. The whole girl gets lost in a strange and fantastical world reminded me of Spirited Away, although the comparison ends there. The message in Spirited Away was much deeper and philosophical compared to Oblivion Island. On the whole though, I am glad that this &#34;experiment&#34; in trying out something out of my comfort zone proved to be so rewarding, not to mention kid friendly (recommended for ages 8 and up).",5,"Excellent storytelling, engaging characters, and vivid animation make for entertaining viewing",1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,2932,"['love', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'nine-year-old', 'daughter', 'grown', 'love', 'years', 'are', 'great', 'fans', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'body', 'work', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'introducing', 'daughter', 'other', 'films', 'made', 'other', 'directors', 'course', 'given', 'age', 'have', 'choose', 'content', 'care', ""'m"", 'glad', 'found', '34', 'Oblivion', 'Island', 'Haruka', 'Magic', 'Mirror', '34', 'Directed', 'Shinsuke', 'Sato', 'film', '3-D', 'animation', 'present', 'vivid', 'story', 'bursting', 'color', 'featuring', 'cast', 'characters', 'struck', 'original', 'refreshing.The', 'premise', 'engaging', 'one', 'Haruka', 'only', 'child', 'being', 'raised', 'single', 'parent', 'household', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'when', 'Haruka', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Haruka', 'loneliness', 'dejection', 'fiercely', 'mother', 'comfort', 'being', 'happy', 'family', 'chance', 'encounter', 'strange', 'creature', 'propels', 'Haruka', 'amazing', 'journey', 'land', 'lost', 'things', 'where', 'utter', 'astonishment', 'objects', 'abandoned', 'forgotten', 'humans', 'are', 'collected', 'creatures', 'inhabiting', 'world', 'who', 'live', 'Island', 'controlled', 'power-hungry', 'Baron', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'charismatic', 'Baron', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'Haruka', 'Teo', 'creature', 'who', 'initially', 'balks', 'helping', 'human', 'two', 'gradually', 'form', 'close', 'bond', 'differences.The', 'animation', 'excellent', 'as', 'far', '3D', 'animation', 'what', 'really', 'captured', 'imagination', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'was', 'wonderful', 'storytelling', 'engaging', 'characters', 'friendship', 'Haruka', 'Teo', 'beautifully', 'conveyed', 'character', 'well-delineated', 'Characterization', 'not', 'sacrificed', 'expense', 'animation', 'effects', 'appreciated', 'also', 'adorable', 'character', '34', 'Cotton', '34', 'Haruka', 'across', 'mother', 'mirror', 'one', 'forgotten', 'objects', 'taken', 'world', 'Cotton', 'used', 'be', 'Haruka', 'soft', 'toy', 'sheep', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Cotton', 'able', 'speak', 'move', 'made', 'possible', 'mirror', 'placed', 'Cotton', 'was', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'who', 'felt', 'embodied', 'comfort', 'love', 'children', 'derive', 'precious', 'childhood', 'toy', 'villain', 'Baron', 'aptly', 'portrayed', 'egotistical', 'maniac', 'prevent', 'Haruka', 'getting', 'mirror', 'due', 'power', 'possess.Watching', 'film', 'reminded', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'Baron', 'flying', 'abode', 'example', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Howl', 'moving', 'castle', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'whole', 'girl', 'lost', 'strange', 'fantastical', 'world', 'reminded', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'comparison', 'there', 'message', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'was', 'much', 'deeper', 'philosophical', 'compared', 'Oblivion', 'Island', 'whole', 'am', 'glad', '34', 'experiment', '34', 'trying', 'out', 'something', 'comfort', 'zone', 'proved', 'be', 'so', 'rewarding', 'not', 'mention', 'kid', 'friendly', 'recommended', 'ages', '8', 'up']",N/A
