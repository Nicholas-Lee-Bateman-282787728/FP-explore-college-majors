The characters had great chemistry. It is purely sentimental with a some comedic touches.Usually, Korean dramas (series) are much better than Korean movies because the characters get well-developed and you are experiencing their lives.  This drama is a wonderful short journey (compared to longer Korean dramas) with memorable scenes and moments.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, ""Nanay: Lessons From a Mother""",5,Outstanding and memorable Love Story,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,506,"['film', 'was', 'fantastic', 'scenery', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'highly', 'recommend', 'love', 'story', 'characters', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'purely', 'sentimental', 'comedic', 'touches.Usually', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'series', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Korean', 'movies', 'characters', 'get', 'well-developed', 'are', 'experiencing', 'lives', 'drama', 'wonderful', 'short', 'journey', 'compared', 'longer', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'moments.JR', 'FelisildaAuthor', 'book', 'Nanay', 'Lessons', 'Mother']",N/A

1015408,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000HPXJKQ,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","MY GIRL AND I tells a tragic tale well known to fans of The Gorgeous Girl Dies Young genre. Soo ho (Tae Hyun Cha) attends a ten year high school reunion which he uses as a excuse for a flashback about his first love with Soo Eun (Hye Gyo Song), the prettiest girl in school. He cannot imagine why she likes him but she clearly does and they fall rapidly in love. Their love is sweet and innocent as is typical of most Korean romance dramas. Things seem to be going well for them until there is a melodramatic turn mid film when Soo Eun faints while on a date with Soo ho. A trip to the hospital reveals that she has terminal leukemia. The last third of the film is replete with tragedy. Complicating matters, So-ho's grandfather tells a parallel tale of tragedy of his own. During the Korean War he left behind his beloved only to find that by war's end she had married another and he had arrived during the funeral for his beloved's husband. MY GIRL AND I is a coming of age film that smacks of LOVE STORY with the emphasis here on how a typical teenager manages to cope with a crushing loss.

The lead girl and the grandfather I've seen in other films. Although there were many emotional moments, there were almost quite a few funny laugh out loud moments too. Overall, a film worth the watch. Makes you appreciate what you have and how quickly you can lose it without warning.
