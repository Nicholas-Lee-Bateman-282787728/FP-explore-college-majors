I actually go into the Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness each year so these skills are great to have just in case.

1255846,A2WJ6Y2KOXJ6FD,B0028ERBSK,Cerebellum,"[5, 25]","Bear Grylls has a somewhat entertaining show but it is completely worthless from a survival standpoint. I do not like the Title ""Man vs. Wild""? There are enough people going against the natural world already. That title gives nature a bad name, like it is something you must fight against. The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment. All of this goes without even mentioning the piles of dangerous advice given on this show.In the screen shots of this dvd set on Amzon's own page, you sea a picture of Edward pole vaulting down a mountain. Imagine if you were in a survival situation, and you are stupid enough to pole vault down a mountain, you fall and break your leg, what would you do? Live longer and healthier, do not listen to a word of advice you get from this show.",1,Man vs Hotel,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1267,"['Bear', 'Grylls', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'show', 'completely', 'worthless', 'survival', 'standpoint', 'do', 'not', 'Title', 'Man', 'vs.', 'Wild', 'are', 'enough', 'people', 'going', 'natural', 'world', 'already', 'title', 'bad', 'name', 'something', 'must', 'fight', 'man', 'admitted', 'staging', 'scenes', 'show', 'staying', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'almost', 'anything', 'say', 'natural', 'living', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'entertainment', 'then', 'show', 'three', 'stars', 'However', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'survival', 'information', 'not', 'interested', 'seeing', 'fool', 'run', 'around', 'woods', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Survivor', 'Man', 'Also', 'Tom', 'Brown', 'field', 'guides', 'are', 'great', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'interested', 'survival', 'not', 'just', 'cheap', 'entertainment', 'even', 'mentioning', 'piles', 'dangerous', 'advice', 'given', 'screen', 'shots', 'dvd', 'set', 'Amzon', 'own', 'page', 'sea', 'picture', 'Edward', 'pole', 'vaulting', 'down', 'mountain', 'Imagine', 'were', 'survival', 'situation', 'are', 'stupid', 'enough', 'pole', 'vault', 'down', 'mountain', 'fall', 'break', 'leg', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Live', 'longer', 'healthier', 'do', 'not', 'listen', 'word', 'advice', 'get', 'show']",Man vs Wild: Season 3

And this won't be much of a review of Bear Grylls as an expert on surviving in the wild.  But, I will say these 10 adventures are entertaining, and it shows us parts of the world that aren't too explored....television wise, that is.Also, there ARE English subtitles for this season.  So, to anybody complaining about the lack of subtitles/closed captions on previous seasons, Discovery does it right with this season.  I'm not sure if there are closed captions however, but there are English subtitles only.Another thing, be prepared, like always, for a strong stomach for at least some of these episodes.  Some of what he eats is just awful.",4,More Bear adventures!,1250899200,"08 22, 2009",2009,702,"['wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'depth', 'review', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'review', 'Bear', 'Grylls', 'expert', 'surviving', 'wild', 'will', 'say', '10', 'adventures', 'are', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'world', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'explored', '.television', 'wise', 'ARE', 'English', 'subtitles', 'season', 'So', 'anybody', 'complaining', 'lack', 'subtitles/closed', 'captions', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Discovery', 'right', 'season', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'closed', 'captions', 'however', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'only.Another', 'thing', 'be', 'prepared', 'always', 'strong', 'stomach', 'least', 'episodes', 'what', 'just', 'awful']",Man vs Wild: Season 3
