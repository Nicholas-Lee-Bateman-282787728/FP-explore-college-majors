It was a beautifully done film and of course I had to get myself a CD to replace my old cassette that I'm sure I have somewhere.  The music is like no other and it's mesmerizing.  I must say it's my favorite album of all time.,5,Best Album!!!,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,359,"['always', 'loved', 'album', 'recently', 'saw', 'special', 'problems', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'experienced', 'making', '25', 'year', 'old', 'album', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'film', 'course', 'had', 'get', 'CD', 'replace', 'old', 'cassette', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'somewhere', 'music', 'other', 'mesmerizing', 'must', 'say', 'favorite', 'album', 'time']",N/A

Simon talks about how he was influenced by South African music as the tribal drums and accordion are accented. The video looks primitive by today's high tech standards. The song was a big hit at the time but I think you'll remember it by it repeated chorus: These are they days of miracle and wonder. The producer of Graceland said that the label Warner Brothers, had never heard anything like what Paul was doing. They show the studio recording footage set to the track ""I Know What I Know"". Everyone seems to be having a really good time, from the back-up singers to the drummer. We learn that most of the song writing was done in that very studio, not before hand. Paul discusses that the album's title track ""Graceland"" was tough to set to music. The twangy southern guitar sounds compliment it well during his Saturday Night Live performance. The video for ""Homeless"" was banned in South Africa although it only highlights South African's daily life and culture at the time. This was a time of apartied, so that was a major factor. The song makes a powerful point-gently, as Paul Simon puts it.During the discussion of ""Crazy Love Vol. II"" Simon speaks of how he was criticized both South Africa and the U.S. for trying to raise awareness about the area. Simon clears up that's not why he went there. He fell in love with their music and wanted to play with their musicians, and let their musicians tell their stories. Another Saturday Night Live performance is highlighted when Paul duets with Linda Ronstat on ""Under African Skies"". The duo lay down some great vocal harmonies together. The song that everyone is familiar with is obviously ""You Can Call Me All"". Who can forget that penny whistle riff and funky bass line. There's so much more that you learn about the song here. Did you know that the base line is made up of a lick that is played forward then backward? Paul isolates the track in the studio to demonstrate. We also learn that the first video for the song sucked. SNL producer Lorn Michael's actually pitched the idea of Simon doing the video with Chevy Chase. The video was light and funny, but Simon thought it under-cut the deep meaning of the song, which is really about him.The BadNothingThe VerdictA very informative DVD; I have a whole new appreciation for Paul Simon's Graceland after watching it.

436156,A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,6304813031,"Michael Kerner ""Michael Kerner""","[3, 3]","To be honest with you, the 1980's brought out some of the most universal and influential records of all time. While we will always think of Michael Jackson's Thriller and Whitney Houston's 2 records that really shot up the charts, her 1987 Whitney album and her 1985 self-titled record, there were some of those who've felt at that time lost in the shuffle. Paul Simon was one of those acts. He was in a awkward place in his solo career and personal life with a divorce from Carrie Fisher and his reunion with Art arfunkel in the early 80's. He needed a sense of inspiration to his work, because he did feel the need of being commercial success anymore. His most successful work, lied within inspiration from discrimination and turned into Graceland.Classic Albums: Paul Simon's Graceland is a delightful and remarkable retrospective behiind what made Paul Simon's 1986 album one of the most influential records of all time, and his most successful to date. The story shows how Paul Simon went all the way to South Africa, and how he earned the influences to what became a great album. The documentary includes highlights from him as well as others who worked behind the scenes, including highlights from his Graceland tour and appearances from Saturday Night Live. The filming also shows how tracks like You Can Call Me Al were made into great videos for the MTV era with Chevy Chase. The filming was great and showed a lighter side from a country that was heavily discriminated and abused because of Apartheid rule. There also are great moments here including tracks like Graceland, the upbeat The Boy In The Bubble, and many other wonderful comments.All in all, Classic Albums has had many of its documentarires recently air on the VH1 Classic channel and reflect great music in our industry that we often really forget about and overlook. Paul Simon today is one of those acts who we still know and love, and I really recommend this if you're a die hard fan, or interested into new music. You might call him Al, but don't call him a throwback.Documentary: B+Price: A-Extras: BRemastering: BOverall: B 1/2+",4,Returning To Graceland,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,2109,"['be', 'honest', '1980', 'brought', 'out', 'most', 'universal', 'influential', 'records', 'time', 'will', 'always', 'think', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Thriller', 'Whitney', 'Houston', '2', 'records', 'really', 'up', 'charts', '1987', 'Whitney', 'album', '1985', 'self-titled', 'record', 'were', 'who', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'time', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'was', 'one', 'acts', 'was', 'awkward', 'place', 'solo', 'career', 'personal', 'life', 'divorce', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'reunion', 'Art', 'arfunkel', 'early', '80', 'needed', 'sense', 'inspiration', 'work', 'did', 'feel', 'need', 'being', 'commercial', 'success', 'anymore', 'most', 'successful', 'work', 'lied', 'inspiration', 'discrimination', 'turned', 'Graceland.Classic', 'Albums', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Graceland', 'delightful', 'remarkable', 'retrospective', 'behiind', 'what', 'made', 'Paul', 'Simon', '1986', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'records', 'time', 'most', 'successful', 'date', 'story', 'how', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'went', 'way', 'South', 'Africa', 'how', 'earned', 'influences', 'what', 'became', 'great', 'album', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'who', 'worked', 'scenes', 'including', 'highlights', 'Graceland', 'tour', 'appearances', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'filming', 'also', 'how', 'tracks', 'Can', 'Call', 'Me', 'Al', 'were', 'made', 'great', 'videos', 'MTV', 'era', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'filming', 'was', 'great', 'showed', 'lighter', 'side', 'country', 'was', 'heavily', 'discriminated', 'abused', 'Apartheid', 'rule', 'also', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'here', 'including', 'tracks', 'Graceland', 'upbeat', 'Boy', 'Bubble', 'many', 'other', 'wonderful', 'comments.All', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'had', 'many', 'documentarires', 'recently', 'air', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'channel', 'reflect', 'great', 'music', 'industry', 'often', 'really', 'forget', 'overlook', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'today', 'one', 'acts', 'who', 'still', 'know', 'love', 'really', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'interested', 'new', 'music', 'might', 'call', 'Al', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'throwback.Documentary', 'B+Price', 'A-Extras', 'BRemastering', 'BOverall', '1/2+']",N/A
436157,A1BRXLFWILNICE,6304813031,Robin McDonald,"[10, 11]","I for one am really happy they decided to release this program to the public. Originally aired on public television stations I was glued to the set from the moment I saw Paul Simon sitting behind the huge mixing console and intimately and revealing the meaning of each verse of the song Graceland and disecting the mix piece by piece to the delight of my wondering eyes and ears.  I have never seen anything like it in a music documentary. And then after reconstructing it for us,listening carefully, as if it were the first time, Simon confesses, it is the most perfect song and album he has ever done.  This coming from a man who has produced a huge catalog of loved and respected tunes resonated and gave tingles when I heard him say it. The 70 minutes of the documentary insightfully covers the history of Paul Simon's mental state at the time he began the Graceland project through the tours that followed its release.  The interviews with the members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo are particularly interesting as they reflect on their struggle to mesh their dance and harmonies with Simon's musical ideas.  They are all gentle men who speak with such a softness joy and lack of guile that you can scarcely believe people like this exist. Listening to their mutual respect for each other is quite moving  Mambazo's hypnotic movements are fascinating to watch. Equally delightful is watching the African studio musicians breakdown the development of the now legendary rifs and harmonies that makeup the album.  I found the whole documentary to be outstanding and time well spent for anyone who has spent hours listening to Graceland over the years. It is a testimony to the greatness of the songs that people don't want to hear them interupted. But to trade some of the great never before seen moments shared in this documentary with full length renditions of the songs and videos seems unrealistic. And ultimately a bad trade in light of the fact that you can buy Graceland: The African Concert on DVD as well. This documentary is a rare gift to fans that I have never seen the like of and my world would be a slightly sadder place if it was not made.",5,Graceland: A classic documentary on a classic album,998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,2153,"['one', 'am', 'really', 'happy', 'decided', 'release', 'program', 'public', 'Originally', 'aired', 'public', 'television', 'stations', 'was', 'glued', 'set', 'moment', 'saw', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'sitting', 'huge', 'mixing', 'console', 'intimately', 'revealing', 'meaning', 'verse', 'song', 'Graceland', 'disecting', 'mix', 'piece', 'piece', 'delight', 'wondering', 'eyes', 'ears', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'music', 'documentary', 'then', 'reconstructing', 'listening', 'carefully', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'Simon', 'most', 'perfect', 'song', 'album', 'ever', 'done', 'coming', 'man', 'who', 'produced', 'huge', 'catalog', 'loved', 'respected', 'tunes', 'resonated', 'gave', 'tingles', 'when', 'heard', 'say', '70', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'insightfully', 'history', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'mental', 'state', 'time', 'began', 'Graceland', 'project', 'tours', 'followed', 'release', 'interviews', 'members', 'Ladysmith', 'Black', 'Mambazo', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'reflect', 'struggle', 'mesh', 'dance', 'harmonies', 'Simon', 'musical', 'ideas', 'are', 'gentle', 'men', 'who', 'speak', 'softness', 'joy', 'lack', 'guile', 'can', 'scarcely', 'believe', 'people', 'exist', 'Listening', 'mutual', 'respect', 'other', 'quite', 'moving', 'Mambazo', 'hypnotic', 'movements', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Equally', 'delightful', 'watching', 'African', 'studio', 'musicians', 'development', 'now', 'legendary', 'rifs', 'harmonies', 'makeup', 'album', 'found', 'whole', 'documentary', 'be', 'outstanding', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'anyone', 'who', 'spent', 'hours', 'listening', 'Graceland', 'years', 'testimony', 'greatness', 'songs', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'interupted', 'trade', 'great', 'never', 'seen', 'moments', 'shared', 'documentary', 'full', 'length', 'renditions', 'songs', 'videos', 'unrealistic', 'ultimately', 'bad', 'trade', 'light', 'fact', 'can', 'buy', 'Graceland', 'African', 'Concert', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'rare', 'gift', 'fans', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'like', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'slightly', 'sadder', 'place', 'was', 'not', 'made']",N/A
