Throw inJosh Brolinhamming it up by reading every line like it was a one-liner, a couple of painted actors, tons of slo-mo/shaky cam/fight scenes/battle/war/CG blood, shoot on location in Greenland and Africa, and add a bunch of CGI. Stir. Garnish with mummy opening it's eyes, because heck why not! Sprinkle of actual facts and history on the side.You get Mankind: The Story of All of Us.This is a documentary aimed squarely at the American public audience, 15-25 year old's. This is the History Channel at it's most sensational, most OTT, most vivid, and most Hollywoodized. Mankind clearly has things going for it. The reenactments are absolutely stunning and very ambitious. The costumes are rich, the colours are vivid, the actors are competent, and it makes for great, action-packed watching. The battle scenes are stunning, and the CGI is undoubtedly grand and epic. Visually, Mankind does not disappoint; grand, epic, and often incredibly beautiful.But it's amazing how little darn history there ACTUALLY is. Rock-hard facts are minimal and dates are almost non-existent. Civilizations, emperors, kings, gods, and peoples come and go in the blink of an eye. Everything is an action scene, and Josh Brolin is certainly anything but subtle. This is more Hollywood entertainment, NOT history, and I ask teachers and parents to refrain from showing this AS actual history in a school or classroom or anything. It is impossible to cover mankind's thousands of years of existence in a mere 10 hours.The interviewees are even worse, chosen strictly for what cool things they could say and how vividly they could say it rather than on credentials or even knowledge. There's a young writer (on a HISTORY channel?) who insists he knows all about hunger: ""you will spend 4 hours talking with your friends about your next meal"", cold: ""extreme cold is like an animal"", and cannibalism: ""when you get really hungry, you will eat your friends"", he says, like he has been there and done that. There's a marine who never blinks: ""Tools make me better. Weapons make me stronger"", and ""When you see guys rushing to take your land that you worked so hard on, you think, I don't want that to happen. I will stop you."" Yes, yes, there's a smattering of professors and history teachers, but on the majority any facts they gave were a major disappointment.It was like any knowledge in the series was unintentional and an afterthought to the (admittedly very good) reenactments.Mankind: The Story of (Almost) All of Us is meant to be entertainment, and it IS entertaining. It's cool watching the first wolf get domesticated or the pyramids built. The cinematography is often very beautiful, and the costumes are, for the most part, period accurate. Visually, the series is absolutely stunning, and you can hold me to that statement. But cerebrally? Non-existent. Your children will learn more about history by reading books and looking at maps and watching BBC (the only channel to make their documentaries entertaining and informative) documentaries than by watching this. For the history buff (like me), Mankind can be simpleminded, but it's undoubtedly a splendid feast for the eyes.My rating?

1597830,APSFJ90Y5US91,B009LA1QYE,Crashlanding,"[0, 0]","When you name your series Mankind, the story of all of us, folks tend to expect something on a scale a bit higher than the average documentary show. I was expecting something like History Channel's other show, The Universe. Multiple seasons, with each episode giving some cool details about the subject they chose. Throw in some smart and funny commentary by professionals that know what they're talking about, and you have a winner. The first episode of Mankind glosses over thousands of years of history way too fast. In an episode that runs about 45 minutes they start at humans walking upright, all the way to the beginning of the iron Age! Not sure how many seasons they expect at that pace. The side bar presenters were a kind of boring lot, with the chosen subject always accompanied by a (not so well done) reenactment.There are times where they focus too long on something that really doesn't need it, just for the sake of another (frankly kinda cheesy) reenactment. For example: During the bronze age tin was about as valuable as gold, and they tell us as much. This sets up a graphic showing how trade flows during the time, which leads to a setup for some actors to be a merchant family. During the whole 10 minutes of acting out a bandit raid, the worry of the father, the happy conclusion, there was actually something interesting revealed: This family was based on a real one. They left behind some of the oldest writing ever discovered, because the clay tablets they used as journals survived. THAT was interesting and fun  to know! Okay now show me the museum pics of these tablets, or even the dig site, while the sidebar narrator tells me who, when, and where they were found. Nope! The narrator drops this info in the space of about a minute, almost as an afterthought, then onward with the pretend caravan. Tin was super valuable and people would kill for it, right? So how about we see how they get it out of the ground? Any clever tools or techniques that will surprise me? No time for that because we're setting up the next reenactment, this time with chariots!All of this and it's only episode #1. History channel usually does better.

I stopped watching after episode four (Warriors) where Christians were constantly being cast as the bad guys (no, I'm not Christian). The political correctness and the smugness of Brian Williams were just too much to for me to handle.True, the Christian Crusader's did nasty things to Muslims in Jerusalem, but Islam is given a pass for all the atrocities committed in the name of Allah.  While Arab scholars were given due respect for preserving the scholarly works of ancient Greece, we're reminded a number of times they were also Muslim. Gee, do you think they actually had a choice to be anything else in the Islamic culture of that era? I seem to recall that non-believers were hardly held in the highest respect.The reference to the Muslim inventor/ polymath Ibn Firmas of Cordoba as being the first man to fly was laughable!  The story was blown way out of proportion for the sake of claiming that a Muslim was the first man to fly.  While many of Firmas's inventions and studies are well-documented, the &#34;first-man-to-fly&#34; story was attributed to only one questionable source who wrote about it some seven centuries after the event supposedly happened. This was more legendary than factual.I tried to find more information but there's not much out there beyond a Wikipedia article. There's far more material on numerous other Arab scholars of that period, so why did the producers decide to allocated precious broadcast time (not to mention production costs) showing something that most likely never happened?  Ibn Firmas was very smart, accomplished and did a lot of cool stuff. I'd think sixty seconds of broadcast time could have been better spent showing just one of his REAL accomplishments rather than some fictional sop claiming that a Muslim was the first man to fly.On a different subject: when Christ was bound to the cross, the nails were NOT driven through the the palms of his hands, they were driven through the wrist just behind the point where the Ulna and Radius bones connect; this comes from numerous historical accounts depicting how Roman soldiers performed crucifixion on criminals. Once again, it costs a lot of money to set up a scene depicting the crucifixion of Christ complete with all the gore. You'd think they would have done just a little bit of research since the nail-through-the-hand scene was shown several times.Other rants:Enough with all the staged battles performed by professional historical re-enactors, different costumes, same stuff.The real-time graphics depicting the flow of trade & movement of people across Europe, Middle East and China were one of the few redeeming factors of the series.  Gives the viewer the impression that ancient times weren't as primitive as we're all to often  given to believe. Free market capitalism ruled even three thousand years ago!Brolin's monolog seemed dull and mono-toned. Every line was delivered exactly the same way, it was like he was on an outdoor stage doing Shakespeare rather than adopting a calmer more conversational tone to his delivery.

In twelve episodes that span the globe, the show has broad ambitions that sometimes provide interesting facts and sometimes merely spectacle. It's a glitzy effort that is loaded with dramatic recreations and CGI effects and oftentimes seems content to be more entertainment oriented than educational. As actual history, one can't really hope to boil down the rise of civilization across the world to a mere 9 hours (without commercials) but ""Mankind"" gives it a go with intermittent success. This is not a text book lesson or a college course, though, if you're looking for a classic presentation. This is an ADD whirlwind across various cultures and time frames hitting on subjects both vital and somewhat arbitrary. The episodes don't slow down for an in-depth analysis of any particular topic, but race across time jamming as much content as possible into each segment. Its focus, by its own description, is on ""Big History.""Made by the creative forces behind the successful series ""America: The Story of Us,"" this new docu-series is stretched across 12 distinct episodes and 3 discs (in both Blu-ray format or DVD) for a total of nine hours and twelve minutes. The Bonus Features include a random selection of additional footage, but nothing in these choices added much value content for me. The show, however, does look terrific in the hi-def Blu-ray transfer which makes the most of the recreations (which get bolder and more battle-centric as the series progresses).The episodes are as follows (each approximately 46 minutes): (1) Inventors, (2) Iron Men, (3) Empires, (4) Warriors, (5) Plague, (6) Survivors, (7) New World, (8) Treasure, (9) Pioneers, (10) Revolutions, (11) Speed, and (12) New Frontiers.If you are familiar with contemporary History Channel programming, you are more apt to know what to expect with ""Mankind: The Story Of All Of Us."" Sensationalized and over-the-top, the program can present even the most mundane topic in an overheated manner. From an intro that has a mummy opening its eyes (a dubious choice) to early episodes that set tasks like iron smelting to an electronic dance beat and slow motion video, it's all about the presentation. And as the opportunity to create bigger and more violent dramatic recreations becomes available, the show never hesitates to plunge right in. If you watch the History Channel, this undoubtedly won't surprise you. If, however, you are completely unfamiliar with the History series format, I might suggest sampling an episode before making the full investment. My guess, this will either really appeal to you or it will really not.Josh Brolin does the heavy lifting as the narrator, really emphasizing the importance of each new development. He virtually gasps with breathy anticipation as each new subject is ever more riveting than the last! The show's expert commentators vary in credentials, but seem camera ready and eager to participate in the spectacle as well. They include military expert Richard Machowitz (Deadliest Warrier), Dr. Mehmet Oz, Ian Morris and Patrick Hunt (of Stanford), celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, writer Sam Sheridan, Brian Williams (from NBC) and Jason Meigs (Popular Mechanics).In the end, ""Mankind: The Story Of All Of Us"" is easy enough to enjoy as an entertainment program. But I don't know that it fully succeeds at its proposed goals. You want pure science and history, this isn't it. You want a glossy and well made intro to topics that might be of further interest to you, this might be an effective overview. What you get out of this one is directly proportional to what your expectations are going in. Overall, about 3 1/2 stars for me.

That documentary did admirably in its time frame, and I absolutely loved it, and would have recommended it to others, or to be used in school as an introduction to American history. As for Mankind... well, it had a strong start, but then later it focused almost exclusively on Europe.

1597868,A163N1JTZ4Z5QR,B009LA1QYE,M. I. Raymond,"[4, 8]","I was critical of History Channel documentaries after the America Story of Us debacle, but after watching the The Men Who Built America, I was eager to watch this documentary. (I was to write a review of TMWBA, but I'm not too familiar with the Gilded Age, and would feel uncomfortable doing so....)I wasn't particularly pleased with the first episode, but still continued to watch. Once it reached the episode of Mehmet the Conqueror and Cortes, I was disappointed with the series. I thought it would get better by the time it reached the end, and it did, in certain aspects (regarding Cook and Banks), but was a huge letdown.Of course, you can't cover the entire history of mankind in the time allotted, I wouldn't expect it. That doesn't mean there couldn't have been better parts mentioned, or some omitted. It's just the presentation left too many unanswered questions for the layman. For example, the ancestral ancestor of man having dark skin, then not explaining how dark skin changed to lighter skin in different regions (Eurasia, etc.) Finding the answer to these will involve reading about molecular anthropology and the study of genetics (subjects the overwhelming majority of the viewers will have no knowledge in) and discussions of that magnitude will become too technical and 'boring' for most of the viewers, as it will involve the study on mitochondrial DNA sequences, haplogroups, and will involve studying certain groups of people such as the Negritos in South/Southeast Asia, and so forth. Considering the majority of this information will be in peer reviews that will cost around 40.00 just to review for 5 days or so, this will leave the general public with unanswered questions. There are books, but I'm more familiar with the peer reviews than books, and not as well-read in these subjects than history. Another example was the writing of the Hebrew Bible. I don't think many people know that it's believed by scholars that the majority of what is known as the Old Testament was written during the Babylonian captivity in the mid 6th century BCE. And that the first five books of the OT (Genesis-Deuteronomy) were written a few centuries before, around the 10th or 9th century BCE. Since the general public are more than likely not to be familiar with this, someone could be left asking 'How did they (academics) come to that conclusion?' It should inspire research, instead, it might perpetuate misunderstanding and some definite tongue-lashing from Jews and Christians alike.One notable glaring omission was that of Alexander the Great. No mention of his conquests that led to contacting with India, and the mentioning of the Mauryan dynasty and the Indo-Greek kingdoms that existed afterwards shouldn't have been overlooked in this segment, especially if there was discussions concerning ancient societies coming into contact with one another, which was a recurring theme. It's rather obvious the producers were going for more familiar topics of popular culture and tried to relate them to the masses (300 and the Gladiator films), and instead could have mentioned more of South Asia (India) and it's contribution in the Silk Road. I would've have preferred the gladiator segment to be omitted entirely.The coverage of both Christianity and Islam was conflicting. There is a reverend speaking of Jesus and his crucifixion, and in spite of no mention of Jesus' resurrection, the reverend was still there discussing of it. Was he hoping to be a beacon of light for the Christian faith? If I were him, I would have never signed up, since the information given in this program is different than his faith. It also includes events mentioned in the Bible (such as the person helping Jesus while he was carrying the cross) as historical fact. The only two events academics take as fact in unison is his baptism by John the Baptist and his crucifixion. What's the deal with mixing religious belief different from what's accepted as fact? Either tell one story or the other, not a mixture of both. It seemed to be fair of mentioning of Saints Paul and Perpetua concerning the spread of Christianity, but Constantine made provisions in favor of Christianity since the Edict of Milan in 313, and Christianity wasn't even made the state religion of the Roman Empire until 380, over 40 years after his death, not right before he died. The presentation of that in this program is misleading. As for Islam, the presentation seems to be showing Islam and its followers in a favorable light, becoming practically apologetic. I knew about the mentioning of the first known person to attempt flight, ibn Fadlan, and ibn Battuta, but no discussion of the Arab conquests except for a sentence was ridiculous. Also no mention of the Reconquista when mentioning of the Jews, Muslims, and Christians living together in 'harmony'. It was a mixture of tolerance and violence throughout the Reconquista. And whoever was in power in the Iberian peninsula during this era, generally the adherents to religion that wasn't in power were treated as second-class citizens. That's not to say there wasn't any peaceful interactions, as their were instances of Islamic and Christians fighting together, such as El Cid being a mercenary for Muslim and Christian armies after the death of Sancho II and Afonso VI came into power (both monarchs of Leon and Castile). I believe a person is better off reading about the history of Islamic interaction from reputable sources, and not from some of these anti-Islamic books, as they are no better than presentations such as these. Just because there a number of people who are Islamophobes in this country doesn't mean you show everything that Muslims did in history in a favorable notion and omit events that an anti-Islamist will criticize, since they already have their minds made up to begin with. It's the polar opposite.Another error in fact was that one commentator stated that before Mehmet, no one could get through the Walls of Constantinople. The Fourth Crusade that involved the sacking of Rome by the Crusaders and Venetians in 1204 contradicts that statement, as in fact the Eastern Roman Empire never fully recovered after the Fourth Crusade, and the Byzantine Empire was nothing more than a city-state (Constantinople) by 1453.Another aspect of Iberian history that was wrong was that of the Granada Wars. It's historical revisionism in one of the worst ways, as they were trying to tie it in with the Zhu Yuanzhang, the Hongwu Emperor (who I was glad they mentioned). China was using gunpowder in war since the Song Dynasty in the 12th Century to begin with, as it didn't start with Zhu. And the arquebus was in use decades in Europe before the Granada Wars (Hungary and Milan, at least), but this can be misleading and lead people to belived that the Aragonese and Castilians were the first Europeans to use it. The coverage of Cortes also wasn't true. He did not conquer the Aztecs with just 500 men. He had a huge amount of assistance (tens of thousands, possibly over one hundred thousand indigenous soldiers/allies) from the tributaries of the Aztecs such as the Tlaxcallan. It is true that the smallpox outbreak did deplete the sources, Cortes didn't walk into Tenochitlan without a fight after La Noche Triste as it is portrayed here, and no mentioning of those tributaries in their assistance is another distortion of historical fact.Some other issues regarding the information was the lack of blacks in the Mali Empire (I'm certainly no Afro-Centric, but only seeing one or two blacks in the Mali Empire can be misleading, there was a more of a blend of North Africans and Sub-saharan blacks if I'm not mistaken). I was personally hoping of the mention of Musa I, but that's a minor quibble. Also, not mentioning the Kilwa Sultanate and trade in the Indian Ocean. There were Arabic and traders from India that made contact with the Swahili coast in the 10th to the 13th centuries at least, and the Silk Road was more than trekking through land, as there was also sea routes.I also wish there was more discussion of the Persians, India prior to Shah Jahan and the building of the Taj Mahal, More of the Eastern Roman Empire/Byzantines (Why mention the significance of Constantinople without mentioning its history), Japan before the atomic bombings, Zheng He, just to mention a few. They even could have tied in how after the fall of Constantinople, countries tried to view themselves as the 'Third Rome' as part of the legacy of the Roman Empire. For example, Mehmet called himself the 'Kayser-i-Rum' after the conquest, the Russians (who made contact with the Byzantines during the 10th century, the Rus ruler Vladimir married a Byzantine Princess, and the Varangian Guard of the Byzantines even had Vikings from Rus') also viewed themselves as the legitimate successors (The coat and arms of Russia have the double-headed eagle that was the emblem for the Byzantine Empire). It may seem trivial, and it wouldn't have worked without more discussion of the Byzantines. I also wish other religions were mentioned. Just because Christianity and Islam have the most adherents of any other religion, doesn't mean those two should be the only ones mentioned. This is the History of Mankind, after all. If they took time to mention the Easter Island heads being made, they could have done something about that.I also noticed that the some of presentation after the mentioning of ibn Battuta didn't match up chronologically, and utterly confused me. From the Incas, Mehmet the Conqueror, Bartolomeo Dias and Columbus, and the mentioning of the Tulipmania just to state a few. To a person who know little to nothing of this, this could be misleading if they were to research on this. And also, the commentators. Wasn't nearly as bad as America: The Story of.... version of this documentary, but Brian Williams and James Miegs speaking about these issues, among others, weren't enlightening. And the amount of actual historians on here were overshadowed by 'military experts', writers, and celebrities, which was appalling. Some of the people mentioned here were out of place (Dr. Oz talking about the Mehmet just because they have the same name?) Even one of the military experts was speaking of the how the people of the Civil Rights movement felt. He was unqualified to speak of that issue, but considering he was speaking of the similarities of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity almost as if they were Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches when the First Crusades were mentioning, it's not a surprise. There's another instance I remember when James Meigs was stating of the people who drew the cave paintings, those people were saying 'I lived.' No it wasn't, all it was depicting what they saw. Or when the section of the Incas was mentioned, one of the commentators said it takes guts and willpower to win battles. This is not informing at all!However, I did like learning about some of the people mentioned, and seeing certain people mentioned that I wanted to see (ibn Battuta, Zhu Yuangzhang, Queen Njinga, The history of discovering the uses of electricity, Cook and Banks, the Industrial Revolution, etc.), but I certainly won't take what was presented here as fact until whenever I feel like furthering my knowledge in one of these events by means of reading.I believe I've seen someone state something of this concerning The Story of All of Us documentaries on a review, but not on this site. This is a superficial documentary made for those who are only superficially interested in history. There's some definite truth to that. But this may inspire people to want to read more about it. But considering it's safe to say that the target audience watching this won't look into history unless it's action-packed imagery on a television screen, people will have numerous misconceptions on how the academics may think on these matters covered. This definitely isn't the best documentary that could have been done, and the BBC or PBS would have been much better off attempting something like this that the History Channel, or even NGC and Discovery for that matter. Also considering that people have taken 'historical documentaries' like The Story of All of Us as a subjective like such as a favorite art or music and not a objective one as fact means that the THC has failed again.EDIT: I personally don't like how I responded in this review. I wish I could have retracted some of these thoughts earlier, but I can't, and I rather let it stand as is to show where I came from as a reminder of how not to write a review. This video can be a great primer for people to want for people to acquire further knowledge. What can be problematic is that some people may not care to do much research after looking at this documentary (or any in general), and that the History Channel didn't do a good job of hiring people who could have better described the subjects that were being covered overall. With that being said, they covered a lot of material over the years, and there can be plenty for people to look into. I was being far too meticulous, and almost condescending with this review. I do still have problems with some of the facts that were shown, or not gone over in further detail, but you cannot expect a Britannica/World Book Encyclopedia with this sort of material. This documentary is fine for what it can do, people just need to be tentative and be open to further research afterwards and not expect to get everything you need to know about the certain people from this documentary. I believe that I had unrealistic expectations for this series, and it showed.

So we purchased this one, thinking it'd be something really great as well. Not so much. I enjoyed half of it, shedding light on some of the less known historical happenings - things I didn't learn about in my history classes in school. However, I found some of the historical data to be somewhat skewed. For starters, if you are a Christian and believe in Creationism, and that according to the bible's timeline the earth is only just over 6,000 years old, then you will find a lot of the timelines in this movie to be way off. They present the typical scientific timeline of millions/billions of years old. Also, again pertaining to Creationism, you may find the idea of gold and other fine metals slamming into and exploding into the earth by pure chance, very laughable, and take that part of the movie with a grain of salt also. There is also a snarky tone with some of the data pertaining to Christianity - calling Christ someone who was disturbing the peace, Peter is referred to in a condescending way as well, the crusades & salem witch trials (while both were definitely horrible and should not have happened) are over played and drastically shamed, while islamic acts of terror are barely touched on and greatly glazed over. I also found the theory of all life beginning in Africa questionable, since many professionals have said that there is no real way to calculate where mankind began on this Earth, due to such drastic changes in landscaping over the years (so finding it according to biblical clues are even vastly remote). I was also very let down that they ended the movie in the 1960s. They show images of man going to the moon, but that is as the movie is ending. They never elaborate on it or give any facts about it. And beyond that, nothing. The movie simply ends. I realize that most people born in the 1960s are still alive and have lived through our most recent history, but it still seemed like the movie was ended on a disappointing cliffhanger.At the end of the day I take this movie at its face value - some great historical facts, mixed in with some human biases and misinformation.

It is a big challenge to create a series of this scope without making major mistakes. And the creators have managed that.First let me pay tribute to Josh Brolin's excellent narration.  Working from an excellent script, he combined the right balance of gravitas and breathless awe in describing the man's greatest achievements. Peter Coyote and David McCullogh have always been my benchmarks for big-scale documentary narrations, and Brolin easily matches them.Second: The pacing and editing was well done over all these hours of material. I especially liked the zeroing in on specific people ( some of whom even I, as an historian, was unaware of), to bring this vast story down to a manageable scale.Third: The program bravely emphasized the paramount importance of war in the development of human 'progress'. I was continually amazed at the courage of the producers in making this very clear despite our anti-military, poltically correct era.Fourth an most important: The producers overall selected the right events and people to tell the story of mankind. I have some disagreements, like where was the Renaissance?? Incredibly it received virtually no mention.  But given the thousands of years to be covered, not everything could be tackled. I was not particuarily impressed with the resident 'experts' that punctuated the narration. None of them were of sufficient renown for such a vast undertaking as this program. Contrast that with the recent 'The Men Who Built America' program, where a veritable whos-who of American tycoons showed up for pithy observations.Summary: This program well deserves a place in your DVD collection and should be required viewing in  High School history classes.",4,Pretty Darn Good Given the Scope,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,1792,"['Let', 'start', 'writing', 'series', 'was', 'considerably', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'challenge', 'create', 'series', 'scope', 'making', 'major', 'mistakes', 'creators', 'have', 'managed', 'that.First', 'let', 'pay', 'tribute', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'excellent', 'narration', 'Working', 'excellent', 'script', 'combined', 'right', 'balance', 'gravitas', 'breathless', 'awe', 'describing', 'man', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'David', 'McCullogh', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'benchmarks', 'big-scale', 'documentary', 'narrations', 'Brolin', 'easily', 'them.Second', 'pacing', 'editing', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'hours', 'material', 'especially', 'liked', 'zeroing', 'specific', 'people', 'whom', 'even', 'historian', 'was', 'unaware', 'bring', 'vast', 'story', 'down', 'manageable', 'scale.Third', 'program', 'bravely', 'emphasized', 'paramount', 'importance', 'war', 'development', 'human', ""'progress"", 'was', 'continually', 'amazed', 'courage', 'producers', 'making', 'very', 'clear', 'anti-military', 'poltically', 'correct', 'era.Fourth', 'most', 'important', 'producers', 'overall', 'selected', 'right', 'events', 'people', 'tell', 'story', 'mankind', 'have', 'disagreements', 'where', 'was', 'Renaissance', 'received', 'virtually', 'mention', 'given', 'thousands', 'years', 'be', 'covered', 'not', 'everything', 'could', 'be', 'tackled', 'was', 'not', 'particuarily', 'impressed', 'resident', ""'experts"", 'punctuated', 'narration', 'None', 'were', 'sufficient', 'renown', 'vast', 'undertaking', 'program', 'Contrast', 'recent', 'Men', 'Who', 'Built', 'America', 'program', 'where', 'veritable', 'whos-who', 'American', 'tycoons', 'showed', 'up', 'pithy', 'observations.Summary', 'program', 'well', 'place', 'DVD', 'collection', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'High', 'School', 'history', 'classes']",N/A

So Amazon it is up to to you or another phrase she used is ""There is little black in all of us""  A little deer lay dead or looks like it with 3 big spears in it.Amazon I will not be ordering you any more you can get you languages straight.I hope History Chanel can sued for this dvd and the one on religion.  She told what to do so she make this film.  I am not going to talk to you computer any more Amazon or buy from you. There are other authentic resources where I don't have to sit and write this to a computer.  Drop that History Channel series.",2,Misleading for the History Channel,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,1822,"['title', 'alone', 'not', 'true', 'Secondly', 'use', 'word', 'Mankind', 'not', 'mankind', 'not', 'story', 'us..', 'word', 'story', 'just', 'story.I', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'History', 'Channel', 'not', 'doing', 'research', 'let', 'use', 'title', 'make', 'sound', 'true', 'History', 'Channel', 'Story', 'not', 'mix', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'English', 'major', 'teacher', 'would', 'let', 'pass', 'word', 'are', 'use', 'Us', 'Why', 'not', 'say', 'story', 'just', 'not', 'am', 'not', 'you.You', 'had', 'do', 'history', 'looking', 'brush', 'up', 'use', 'English', 'language', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'more', 'dvd', 'History', 'Channel', 'Maybe', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'buck', 'Opinions', 'not', 'sell', 'History', 'am', 'adding', 'comment', 'want', 'know', 'deer', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'injured', 'anyway', 'Amazon', 'computer', 'connect', 'Cruelty', 'Animals', 'website', 'neighbor', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'other', 'one', 'America', 'religions..This', 'part', 'series', 'girl', 'composing', 'ought', 'be', 'dropped.My', 'neighbor', 'was', 'upset', 'very', 'religious', 'person', 'girl', 'who', 'wrote', 'put', 'together', 'made', 'film', 'used', 'very', 'offensive', 'picture', 'word', 'Mankind', 'animal', 'get', 'rid', 'writer', 'series', 'Amazon', 'up', 'phrase', 'used', 'little', 'black', 'little', 'deer', 'lay', 'dead', '3', 'big', 'spears', 'it.Amazon', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'ordering', 'more', 'can', 'get', 'languages', 'straight.I', 'hope', 'History', 'Chanel', 'can', 'sued', 'dvd', 'one', 'religion', 'told', 'what', 'do', 'so', 'make', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'talk', 'computer', 'more', 'Amazon', 'buy', 'are', 'other', 'authentic', 'resources', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sit', 'write', 'computer', 'Drop', 'History', 'Channel', 'series']",N/A
