Javier ""Javier""... except...I haven't ""listened"" to the DVD yet, but the dual CDs sound awful.  They're fine if you need a little musical/audio entertainment while you're waxin' the Honda, but don't expect these discs to sound even decent on a good audio system.  Whatever the problem - Over-Compression or just awful Mixing, EQ and Mastering - this sounds terrible.  Virtually no dynamic range at all... no highs... muffled thudding lows... very sad.Maybe this is purposeful, in that they'll get to ""ReMaster"" it soon, and get you to buy it again.I do disagree with some of the other reports on the performance.  I think the group ""sounds"" really inspired.  Some nice new arrangements that still capture the feel and energy of the original recordings sufficiently so the crazies won't feel ripped-off if the guys are actually inspired enough to rearrange and redux these very old arrangements.However... I haven't watched the Video yet, so maybe there's physical evidence to support the idea that the Police weren't as inspired as I think I hear...  maybe Sting or Stewart or Andy look asleep at the wheel... that might make a difference in someone's enjoyment.",4,Nice Performance! - No Dynamic Range,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,1189,"['completely', 'agree', 'O.', 'Javier', 'Javier', 'have', ""n't"", 'listened', 'DVD', 'yet', 'dual', 'CDs', 'sound', 'awful', ""'re"", 'fine', 'need', 'little', 'musical/audio', 'entertainment', ""'re"", 'waxin', 'Honda', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'discs', 'sound', 'even', 'decent', 'good', 'audio', 'system', 'Whatever', 'problem', 'Over-Compression', 'just', 'awful', 'Mixing', 'EQ', 'Mastering', 'terrible', 'Virtually', 'dynamic', 'range', 'highs', 'muffled', 'thudding', 'lows', 'very', 'sad.Maybe', 'purposeful', ""'ll"", 'get', 'ReMaster', 'soon', 'get', 'buy', 'again.I', 'do', 'disagree', 'other', 'reports', 'performance', 'think', 'group', 'really', 'inspired', 'nice', 'new', 'arrangements', 'still', 'capture', 'feel', 'energy', 'original', 'recordings', 'sufficiently', 'crazies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ripped-off', 'guys', 'are', 'actually', 'inspired', 'enough', 'rearrange', 'redux', 'very', 'old', 'arrangements.However', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Video', 'yet', 'maybe', 'physical', 'evidence', 'support', 'idea', 'Police', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'inspired', 'think', 'hear', 'maybe', 'Sting', 'Stewart', 'Andy', 'look', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'might', 'make', 'difference', 'someone', 'enjoyment']",N/A

I can't figure out what the naysayers are thinking on this one--I think ""Certifiable"" is perhaps the best live DVD I've ever seen.I did not attend a show on the big Police reunion tour last year, so I had no idea what the stage show looked like or what the set-list included, so the live DVD was my first look at Sting, Andy, and Stewart back together again.  The opening track, Message in a Bottle"" was an excellent choice, and the lighting at that point was minimal.  Once ""Synchronicity II"" kicked in, the stage show kicked in, and so did the crowd.  They were on their feet the entire show and I was mesmerized by the musicianship of these 3 players.The first thing that surprised me was the sound quality.  I have a modest home theater system set up that I don't know much about other than how to turn it on and turn it up.  Without any tweaking at all, I noticed Sting's bass was much louder and more ""present"" than I would have expected.  It made for an interesting listen to the show, because it underscored what a great bassist Sting really is.  I'm sure most of us think of him as a singer/songwriter first and as a bassist a distant second.  He is a phenomenal player and underrated in that regard.But the Police is the combustion that happens between Sting and Stewart and Andy.  Just like Sting, Summers & Copeland prove themselves masters of their instruments.I have read some complaints that some of the songs were re-worked & sound a little different.  That's true, and from my own personal point of view, it's a great thing.  1st off, nothing is reworked so drastically that a fan wouldn't be able to recognize the song that's playing.  But if you've kept up with Sting's career lately, he does this regularly.  A little change here & there makes it a bit more interesting.  One reviewer called these changes ""bored & lazy.""  If you watch dvd 2 in the set, you'll see how much work went into working up each song.  I, for one, loved the changes in the songs.If you're sitting here reading this thinking about purchasing the DVD/cd set, DON'T WAIT.  I buy a lot of live DVD sets like this, but this one is by far the best all around, from musicianship, to the stageshow, the song selection, and the extras that show how this band got back together.",5,Best live DVD I think I've ever watched,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2340,"['reviews', 'Police', 'new', 'DVD/CD', 'package', 'are', 'mixed', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'naysayers', 'are', 'thinking', 'one', 'think', 'Certifiable', 'perhaps', 'best', 'live', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.I', 'did', 'not', 'attend', 'show', 'big', 'Police', 'reunion', 'tour', 'last', 'year', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'stage', 'show', 'looked', 'what', 'set-list', 'included', 'live', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'look', 'Sting', 'Andy', 'Stewart', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'opening', 'track', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'lighting', 'point', 'was', 'minimal', 'Synchronicity', 'II', 'kicked', 'stage', 'show', 'kicked', 'so', 'did', 'crowd', 'were', 'feet', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'musicianship', '3', 'players.The', 'first', 'thing', 'surprised', 'was', 'sound', 'quality', 'have', 'modest', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'set', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'other', 'how', 'turn', 'turn', 'up', 'tweaking', 'noticed', 'Sting', 'bass', 'was', 'much', 'louder', 'more', 'present', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'made', 'interesting', 'listen', 'show', 'underscored', 'what', 'great', 'bassist', 'Sting', 'really', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'think', 'singer/songwriter', 'first', 'bassist', 'distant', 'second', 'phenomenal', 'player', 'underrated', 'Police', 'combustion', 'Sting', 'Stewart', 'Andy', 'Just', 'Sting', 'Summers', 'Copeland', 'prove', 'masters', 'instruments.I', 'have', 'read', 'complaints', 'songs', 'were', 're-worked', 'sound', 'little', 'different', 'true', 'own', 'personal', 'point', 'view', 'great', 'thing', '1st', 'nothing', 'reworked', 'so', 'drastically', 'fan', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'song', 'playing', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'up', 'Sting', 'career', 'lately', 'regularly', 'little', 'change', 'here', 'there', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'One', 'reviewer', 'called', 'changes', 'bored', 'lazy', 'watch', 'dvd', '2', 'set', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'went', 'working', 'up', 'song', 'one', 'loved', 'changes', 'songs.If', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'here', 'reading', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'DVD/cd', 'set', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WAIT', 'buy', 'lot', 'live', 'DVD', 'sets', 'one', 'far', 'best', 'around', 'musicianship', 'stageshow', 'song', 'selection', 'extras', 'show', 'how', 'band', 'got', 'back', 'together']",N/A

Pfleeger,"[8, 8]",I was one of the people lucky enough to catch this tour on an early stop in New Orleans and thought it was great so it was a no brainer to purchase this Blu ray/2CD set from Best Buy. The only problem is that the issue is now out of print.The Blu Ray offers the complete Buenos Aires show in pristine video and sound. The band looks and sounds fantastic. By this stop of the tour the show was much tighter than it was when I saw it. Viewers will be blown away by Andy Summers gutar playing. Sting and Copeland are also completely in sync in locking down the sound that the band was famous for even after the 25 year absence.The DVD features a 50 minute documentary on the reunion's origin that showcases the personality conflicts that still exist in the band brought on by the tremendous egos that are involved.

Both the concert and the documentary are extremely moving, both in terms of the band's stunning musical virtuosity and the time-mocking brilliance and originality of their songwriting.  The Police just plain embarrass most music acts present and past.  And although I'd love another studio album, you'll see in the concert footage that the old songs have become living entities of their own, and are so loaded into people's lives and consciousness through generations and across cultures that only groups like the Beatles can compare.

Perhaps one of my greatest 'live show' experiences in quite a long time...Unfortunately things are not the same when it comes to the concert you purchase in DVD / Blu Ray... image quality and resolution on Blu Ray raises up closely to perfection but, for some reason, it simply doesn't looks as amazing as how it was watching them live. Sometimes it even looks like a grammy or an MTV show rather than a two-decade-awaited reunition show. It's just a subjective matter of feeling.Unfortunately, the 2-channel stereo sound is simply awful. It got distorted several times on every single song... even the 2CD set included on the Blu Ray edition does it much better than the Blu Ray (!!!).Documentary and photo galleries are quite good, but you know I'm not buying the whole set for just watching at the pics =)So, basically, that's why I rated it with only three stars: because of post-production and packaging, which also doesn't meet my expectations.If I should be rating the show itself as I've seen it in Lisbon, Portugal, I would rather be giving five stars, but it is the whole post production which pulls down the whole item to a 'just approved'.Could have been quite much better... and it looks like there's not going to be a 'next time' to solve it.Now: it's still very good as a historic music legacy worth having, but wait till it gets cheaper.",3,Below expectations...,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,1643,"['So', 'saw', 'folks', 'touring', 'Europe', 'year', 'ago', 'simply', 'got', 'amazed', 'how', 'fantastic', 'performed', 'how', 'good', 'set', 'sound', 'reunition', 'tour', 'were', 'was', 'simply', 'worth', 'penny', 'having', 'drive', 'more', '6', 'hours', '600', 'km', 'sepparating', 'home', 'Lisbon', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', ""'live"", 'show', 'experiences', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'when', 'concert', 'purchase', 'DVD', '/', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'image', 'quality', 'resolution', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'up', 'closely', 'perfection', 'reason', 'simply', ""n't"", 'looks', 'as', 'amazing', 'how', 'was', 'watching', 'live', 'even', 'grammy', 'MTV', 'show', 'rather', 'two-decade-awaited', 'reunition', 'show', 'just', 'subjective', 'matter', 'feeling.Unfortunately', '2-channel', 'stereo', 'sound', 'simply', 'awful', 'got', 'distorted', 'several', 'times', 'single', 'song', 'even', '2CD', 'set', 'included', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'edition', 'much', 'better', 'Blu', 'Ray', '.Documentary', 'photo', 'galleries', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'whole', 'set', 'just', 'watching', 'pics', '=', 'So', 'basically', 'why', 'rated', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'post-production', 'packaging', 'also', ""n't"", 'meet', 'expectations.If', 'should', 'be', 'rating', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Lisbon', 'Portugal', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'whole', 'post', 'production', 'down', 'whole', 'item', ""'just"", ""approved'.Could"", 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'going', 'be', ""'next"", 'time', 'solve', 'it.Now', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'historic', 'music', 'legacy', 'having', 'wait', 'cheaper']",N/A

1197847,A1YUX2L0P3Z9IW,B001GM0GNC,D. W. Ewing,"[2, 2]","Yep, the packaging is flimsy, but what do we buy DVD's for?  What we have here is an astounding effort by three innovative musicians who could have receded quietly into history.  Instead they put aside their differences, reworked and rehoned their songs, hired some top-notch camera and production people, and went on a blazing world tour captured on DVD for everyone to enjoy forever.  What's not to like?  This is a so much better production than the Synchonicity Concert video, annoyingly filmed and edited by Godley and Creme and crew.Although the set list is closely the same as the 1983 Syncronicity tour, Andy Summers now breaks out guitar solos to expand many of their songs, something that sounds pretty good to my ears. Another critic called him ""paunchy"" - hmmm, he is 65 years of age here, and his bad habit of watching his own fingerings accentuates a bit of face flab, but hey - the guy still can jump from Stewart's drum riser, play some fabulous riffs, and work his effects pedals like few can.Sting's singing voice is powerful despite his own 56 years of age.  His vocal range maybe isn't as wide as 20 years ago, but his clarity isn't diminished. Well maybe a little bit late in the concert, but he absolutely wails on the opening numbers, Message in a Bottle, and Synchronicity II.  His bass playing seems more fluid and melodic than ever, and as part of this 3-piece band, is so important to the rhythm.  More than anyone, Sting set aside his robust personality a bit to co-exist with his bandmates for the practice sessions and tour, which I give him credit for.  I'm sure he didn't need this reunion to make a house payment.Stewart Copeland has always been a great drummer in my opinion, there is never a mis-timed drum beat or awkward fill.  His work really seems the same as 30 years ago, thunderous and expansive.  Without Stewart, the songs wouldn't be as unique, they wouldn't sound like The Police.In spite of my enthusiasm for this, there are some production downsides.  Obviously there has been some audio sweetening.  Personally, I wouldn't mind, if the original concert audio was included as an option on the DVD.  Most notably for me are the altered backing vocals by Andy and Stewart, they seem to have been replaced by an electronic version. I would rather hear them and their mistakes, or at least have the option to do so.  As to dubbed instruments, it's hard to for me to tell, Sting has foot pedals for synthesizer and bass and we don't always get to see him using them.  Andy as well has multiple effects pedals.  Stewart, I'm not sure about, there is some percussion work audible that he is not playing - especially noticable on ""Wrapped around your finger"".  Certainly he or one of the others could have pressed a pedal to make that happen on stage, but who knows.For anyone who wants to learn more about these guys and how they create their music, I can also recommend the DVD ""The Police - Every Breath you Take"" for the bonus items.

1197848,A1R9U3LJ9K208I,B001GM0GNC,Flexible_Strategies,"[5, 5]","I have been a fan of The Police since my youth. I would simply salivate every time they released something. It was an event to be savored. Sadly, because of my youth - at least in my parents' eyes, I never had the chance to see them live. As I grew older, I saw all of their solo ventures, but the magic of a live Police concert forever eluded me. I had even met all three blokes and shared my story with them, careful not to bring up that dreadful question of a reunion. In 2007 when they announced the tour, I was beside myself. I had patiently waited 24 years to see my heroes perform together. My friends, who until this point, thought I was just insane to think they would ever tour again, were delighted for me. I saw the tour twice in Los Angeles, and was even lucky enough to attend the final performance at Madison Square Garden - the last of the tour, and it seems, the last performance ever by Sting, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers.Police fans everywhere are begging the powers that be to dig into the vaults and release the goodies that came out on VHS in the 80's. A wealth of material remains unreleased on DVD. This tour demanded a DVD. The musical portion is an entire show shot in December of 2007 in Buenos Aires. The guys are in top form. Most ""reunion"" tours show the passage of time quite sadly. The Police had aged like fine wine. Sting's voice was in astoundingly good shape. Stewart Copeland still worked the kit like the musical magician he is. Andy Summers returned to rock guitar playing with a vengeance, after almost fading away in the 90's in the jazz fusion realm. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Andy's solo discs, but to hear him blaze during Driven To Tears is the stuff dreams are made of. My favorite tracks are an atmospheric reading of Walking On the Moon, and funktified versions of Walking In Your Footsteps and Voices Inside My Head. The picture is razor sharp and the sound is incredible. The shots of the audience bouncing up and down tell of the excitement this crowd felt at being there.The bonus material includes a documentary by Stewart's son Jordan that aptly displays the genuine joy these three guys have when they play together. But that joy doesn't come without an awful lot of hard work. They rehearsed to the point of almost over-rehearsing. As any Police fan knows, the strength of the band is in its improvisation. Their extended musical forays into unknown territory are legendary. These three guys could read each other on stage so well it was eerie. Also included is the standard photo gallery, including some nice shots by Andy.To have the audio of the concert on two CD's is a nice touch, but every Police fan I have talked to said - ""Is that it?"" I have to admit, the extras seem a bit skimpy. To wait so long for ""new"" Police material is nerve-wracking as it is, and then a release like this comes out, and you can't help but feel slightly let down. I suppose we should be grateful that there is any ""new"" material at all, since I can remember in the not-to-distant past any mention of a Police reunion would have been downright ""certifiable.""",4,"We got the boys back, but the extras are lacking...",1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,3112,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Police', 'youth', 'would', 'simply', 'salivate', 'time', 'released', 'something', 'was', 'event', 'be', 'savored', 'Sadly', 'youth', 'least', 'parents', 'eyes', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'live', 'grew', 'older', 'saw', 'solo', 'ventures', 'magic', 'live', 'Police', 'concert', 'forever', 'eluded', 'had', 'even', 'met', 'three', 'blokes', 'shared', 'story', 'careful', 'not', 'bring', 'up', 'dreadful', 'question', 'reunion', '2007', 'when', 'announced', 'tour', 'was', 'beside', 'had', 'patiently', 'waited', '24', 'years', 'see', 'heroes', 'perform', 'together', 'My', 'friends', 'who', 'point', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'insane', 'think', 'would', 'ever', 'tour', 'again', 'were', 'delighted', 'saw', 'tour', 'twice', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'even', 'lucky', 'enough', 'attend', 'final', 'performance', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'last', 'tour', 'last', 'performance', 'ever', 'Sting', 'Stewart', 'Copeland', 'Andy', 'Summers.Police', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'are', 'begging', 'powers', 'be', 'dig', 'vaults', 'release', 'goodies', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', '80', 'A', 'wealth', 'material', 'remains', 'unreleased', 'DVD', 'tour', 'demanded', 'DVD', 'musical', 'portion', 'entire', 'show', 'shot', 'December', '2007', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'guys', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'Most', 'reunion', 'tours', 'show', 'passage', 'time', 'quite', 'sadly', 'Police', 'had', 'aged', 'fine', 'wine', 'Sting', 'voice', 'was', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'shape', 'Stewart', 'Copeland', 'still', 'worked', 'kit', 'musical', 'magician', 'Andy', 'Summers', 'returned', 'rock', 'guitar', 'playing', 'vengeance', 'almost', 'fading', 'away', '90', 'jazz', 'fusion', 'realm', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Andy', 'solo', 'discs', 'hear', 'blaze', 'Driven', 'Tears', 'stuff', 'dreams', 'are', 'made', 'favorite', 'tracks', 'are', 'atmospheric', 'reading', 'Walking', 'Moon', 'funktified', 'versions', 'Walking', 'Your', 'Footsteps', 'Voices', 'Inside', 'My', 'Head', 'picture', 'razor', 'sharp', 'sound', 'incredible', 'shots', 'audience', 'bouncing', 'up', 'down', 'tell', 'excitement', 'crowd', 'felt', 'being', 'there.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'documentary', 'Stewart', 'son', 'Jordan', 'aptly', 'genuine', 'joy', 'three', 'guys', 'have', 'when', 'play', 'together', 'joy', ""n't"", 'come', 'awful', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'rehearsed', 'point', 'almost', 'over-rehearsing', 'Police', 'fan', 'strength', 'band', 'improvisation', 'extended', 'musical', 'forays', 'unknown', 'territory', 'are', 'legendary', 'three', 'guys', 'could', 'read', 'other', 'stage', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'eerie', 'Also', 'included', 'standard', 'photo', 'gallery', 'including', 'nice', 'shots', 'Andy.To', 'have', 'audio', 'concert', 'two', 'CD', 'nice', 'touch', 'Police', 'fan', 'have', 'talked', 'said', 'have', 'admit', 'extras', 'seem', 'bit', 'skimpy', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'new', 'Police', 'material', 'nerve-wracking', 'then', 'release', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'slightly', 'let', 'down', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'new', 'material', 'can', 'remember', 'not-to-distant', 'past', 'mention', 'Police', 'reunion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'downright', 'certifiable']",N/A

1197850,AY12DBB0U420B,B001GM0GNC,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I found this DVD/CD combination packet of The Police Certifiable live concert recording in Buenos Aires on the bargain rack at my local Ross Stores. Mmmmm, good. That's just the type of thing I look for and under 10 bucks. The Police were one of my favorite groups back in New Wave Days of the late 70s and early 80s. This package contains two DVDs of the concert itself, and I'll note it first. Then, in addition, there are two CDs of the live reunion concert and I'll devote the last part of the review for them.It's great to see the Police again and they look to be in good form. All look fit and healthy, even after 30 years. Their music is delightful, but it's nowhere near as good as their original recordings. Well, you could say this about most music groups so it's not fair criticism. Obviously the crowd loved the performance and I can easily understand. The visuals are quite good but the sound is terrible. You don't really notice this all that much when you're watching the performance as your attention is split between the visuals and the sound. It becomes much more apparent when you listen to only the CDs and I listened to and commented on the CDs first. Visually as viewed on the DVDs, it's a great concert and it's fun to watch.Please note that the rest of this review is for the two CDs only. First and foremost, the sound on these CDs is just awful. I'm a bit of an audiophile and I have a stereo system that is fairly good (100 watt amp per channel, two three-way speakers with 12-inch woofers and an 80-watt powered subwoofer). The sound on many CDs comes across as clean and clear and crisp on my system. The deadmau5 ""For Lack of a Better Name"" comes to mind. Well, the Police CDs are way too loud. I like loud music, by the way, and play it that way all the time. However, with these Police CDs I have to turn the stereo down a couple notches. It's that loud over my ordinary listening level. And even then, the sound quality is miserable. Everything sounds indistinct and ""mushy"" and my household furniture is rattling even at the lower volume level. I'd have to guess that part of this is due to very poor concert hall acoustics. I feel fatigued after listening to one CD, let alone two.A second part includes the songs. I love them. But, they're nowhere nearly as well done as they were on the original 80s recordings. Not even close. I suppose this is to be expected. After all, everyone in the group has aged for three decades and that takes a toll. Plus, they haven't played together for a long time. So, what can I say? If you're a big Police fan, then you're going to have these DVDs and accompanying CDs. I can understand. If you just want to listen to some pristine Police music, get the old LPs or their unaltered CD equivalents. They're excellent! Absolutely pristine! You'll love them!In one of the reviews, someone said they cried when they heard the Police again on this reunion tour, and I can understand. Well, I felt like crying too, but only because the songs were so poorly rendered and with such low sound quality.Gary Peterson",3,Great Concert Film.

But as another reviewer stated, the Police just seem to be ""going through the motions"" in this concert.  It's not hard to figure out why they decided to tour after so long.  With total guaranteed grosses in the hundreds of millions, how could they not?  One thing I love about live recordings is the rawness, and even the mistakes.  It reassures me that real humans are actually playing their instruments and singing.  I like the slop, the hums and buzzes, and the 'clams' which now are absent from any recent ""live"" album.  I'll cut Andy a break for dubbing in the second guitar part on ""Message"".  That guitar harmony is an integral part of the sound of that tune, and impossible to do by one's self.  But this recording is just too damned 'clean'.  With 45 years' experience as an audio engineer, I can tell when vocals are live or have been re-done in the studio and about 75% of Mr. Sumner's have been re-recorded.  Stuart Copland is the hero here.  His energy and expertise on the drums keep it all together in spite of Sting and Andy's somewhat uninspired playing.  Don't get me wrong.  I love this band.

Sumner's chording is really good but his lead work is a caricature of what is might have been long ago and presents his skills poorly.  The sound is adequate but empty. The sound of the bass was either not presented well or not captured correctly. But... there are a couple of real jewels on this release.  Wrapped around your finger is one of them, very well done and Sumner rises to the occasion during that number.My question to all bands out there is....  If you do a reunion and you are trying to replicate your sound why not take along a few extra musicians to really present the songs well?  Case in point:  Concert for George...  there was a large group of musicians (some might call it overkill but it was a tribute concert) onstage and they captured the vibe of the songs very well through the differing periods of production.  During their active years as a band The Police put out a lot of layered material with different concepts,  overdubs, sound effects, etc... a few extras would have added so much dimension to the performance.

I was really happy with the extra features and the fact that both a 5.1 and 2.0 mix were included. I like watching concerts in 2.0 even though I have 5.1 system and it certainly is a good thing for those who only have 2.o stereo set-ups so that they can avoid any loss in audio quality in the down-mix process.My only splitting hairs criticism is that the audio is not raw umcompressed PCM (it is DOLBY TRUEHD); they say that DOLBY TRUE HD and DTS HD MASTER are as good as PCM in theory but in practice PCM sound better because it is uncompressed, very high bit-rate and is not a variable bit-rate codec.Overall a superb purchase!

My friend and band mate had a friend who was a DJ back in the 70's and he would receive albums by bands that were up and coming. We thought these guys were something special and it turned out about a year or so later, the world thought so too!This is a well produced set with camera work that doesn't jump around so much to make you sick. Of course Sting gets the Lion's share of the camera time, but we do get to see Andy and Stewart doing their thing quite often. It's a very good set of songs, but fans of their studio recording may be disappointed. Being a three piece band has its limitations live and the harmonies and other over dubs are sorely missed on certain numbers.I understand why they had to change some song's arrangements as The Police are a very processed band, at least on the later albums and it's almost impossible to duplicate their sound live on certain songs. Even though they are polished from years of experience gone is the raw power of youth and it's sad to hear sometimes as we know we are growing old with our favorite bands.I appreciate that fact they wanted to keep it simple and this DVD sounds much better when played loud, but I almost wish they opted to hire some backup singers as Andy is barely heard on backups and adds nothing to the missing vocal harmonies. Copeland is an exceptional drummer, but he seems a little restrained here either from Sting throwing a hissy fit or just from aging.For under $20 for a full concert and an interesting documentary, stills galleries, plus a two CD live set you really can't go wrong here. I know a lot of people think Sting is a bit of an ego maniac, but having been in bands and played both the sideman bass player and the leader front man I know that with it comes a lot of pressure. Don't judge too harshly until you've been in those shoes. It's no cake walk and I almost prefer when someone else is in charge....I said almost.

The tip off is how incredibly loud it is compared to other blu-rays.  I have to turn the volume way down to equalize the volume between this and other blu-rays.  How do they get it so loud?  They sheer off the dynamic peaks in post processing.  This results in a sound track you can play loud and this might sound like a cool thing, but dynamic range is what makes music interesting.  It is possible that it is not dynamic range compression and the flaws I am hearing are simply due to the large outdoor venue.  It is true that it is hard to get a great recording in such circumstances.  Other artists have dealt with this by playing a smaller venue with better acoustics when recording the concert video on blu-ray.  In this case, it is obvious that a reference quality recording was not the priority.  Instead, they simply tried their best to get a decent recording given all of the limitations.  The result is not horrible, but it is not sonically impressive, either.  If you are looking for a souvenir to remind you of what the show sounded like in an outdoor arena, this will probably do the trick.

I thought my subs were going to implode when it first came on. Other good quality Blu Rays get to -15db or so when I really want to crank them up. This is hard to push past -30db with out thinking I'd be doing serious damage to my system. The 5.1 mix is pretty lame too. Not much at all going on in the surrounds. Picture quality is great.

They preform a whole bunch of classics and even change them up enough to make them fresh. It's good to see them all together again as it will probably be the last time.

The packaging is good, too. The discs are in individual plastic ""cradles"" (the clear type), so scratching is not an issue every time that you take them out. You definitely get an appreciation for how good Sting is, and the band plays a great show. If you are a Police fan of any level, or just like to collect quality concert DVDs, this is worth buying.NOTE: This appears to now be out of print, so my raving about the price may no longer make sense, but if you can track this down from a seller in the marketplace, go for it.",5,Fantastic Value,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,650,"['Nice', 'concert', 'video', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'feature', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'CDs', 'concert', 'audio', 'bang', 'buck', 'packaging', 'good', 'too', 'discs', 'are', 'individual', 'plastic', 'cradles', 'clear', 'type', 'so', 'scratching', 'not', 'issue', 'time', 'take', 'out', 'definitely', 'get', 'appreciation', 'how', 'good', 'Sting', 'band', 'great', 'show', 'are', 'Police', 'fan', 'level', 'just', 'collect', 'quality', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'worth', 'buying.NOTE', 'now', 'be', 'print', 'raving', 'price', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'sense', 'can', 'track', 'down', 'seller', 'marketplace', 'go']",N/A

The only concert was The Police certifiable. Im not a Sting fan but for $10 I figured why not! I own a THX certified 7.1 system. The picture is so clear I could see the hairs on Stings arms (Panasonic V10). The sound is phenomenal! I cranked up the volume by choice because it sounded so clear. I was truely entertained by this Blu-ray concert and now agree with Cnet this is one for the collection. I cant wait to have some friends over to enjoy a great concert with a clear picture and sound. My home theater has a multitude of adjustments and it sounded terrific without tweaking. If I spent the time to dial in a better picture and sound Im sure I could blow away some other of my favorite concerts on DVD.

Sting can still hit most of the vocal notes and some of his bass playing is really inspiring, Andy is solid in the rhythm department and burns on some leads but others are sloppy, and Stewart's acrobatic drumming is awesome and he doesn't speed up tempos like he used to. The set list is good, the audio and video excellent, but I feel the band is just going through the motions and some of the music sounds dull. However, ""Driven to Tears"" burns and is the highlight of the show. Also, when playing live, Sting likes to arrange songs differently, probably to keep it fresh, and a trio can't pull off the overdubs without additional players. Anyway, I prefer the studio versions, but ""Walking in your Footsteps"" is an exception.The bonus features include a 50-minute film with interviews from the band on their thoughts of the reunion tour, and two picture galleries. I've been a fan of this band from the beginning but am surprised by this DVD because it leaves me with a blah feeling.",3,Huh?,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,1056,"['guess', ""'ve"", 'burned', 'out', 'Police', 'performance', 'lacking', 'Sting', 'can', 'still', 'hit', 'most', 'vocal', 'notes', 'bass', 'playing', 'really', 'inspiring', 'Andy', 'solid', 'rhythm', 'department', 'burns', 'leads', 'others', 'are', 'sloppy', 'Stewart', 'acrobatic', 'drumming', 'awesome', ""n't"", 'speed', 'up', 'tempos', 'used', 'set', 'list', 'good', 'audio', 'video', 'excellent', 'feel', 'band', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'music', 'dull', 'However', 'Driven', 'Tears', 'burns', 'highlight', 'show', 'Also', 'when', 'playing', 'live', 'Sting', 'likes', 'arrange', 'songs', 'differently', 'probably', 'keep', 'fresh', 'trio', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'overdubs', 'additional', 'players', 'Anyway', 'prefer', 'studio', 'versions', 'Walking', 'Footsteps', 'exception.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', '50-minute', 'film', 'interviews', 'band', 'thoughts', 'reunion', 'tour', 'two', 'picture', 'galleries', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'band', 'beginning', 'am', 'surprised', 'DVD', 'blah', 'feeling']",N/A
