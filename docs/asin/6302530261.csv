318959,A2GPEV42IO41CI,6302530261,Kona,"[2, 7]","It is the height of the Cold War and Judith (Julie Andrews), who works in the British Home Office, has gone to Barbados to get over a failed love affair.  She just happens to be staying next door to suave Col. Sverdlov (Omar Sharif), a highly-placed Russian spy.  He pursues her, relentlessly, and then follows her back to London.  Does he want to defect to the West or recruit her for his side?I wanted to like this movie.  I expected it to be wonderful with such beautiful stars and a top-notch supporting cast, but it's slow, confusing, and dull.  Andrews never convinces us that she is attracted to, let alone in love with, the Colonel.  She looks stiff and uncomfortable throughout, wearing a wardrobe that was meant to be glamorous, but looks silly.  The script makes Sharif out to be an annoying, tiresome, overgrown teenager with one thing on his mind.  The lovely John Barry soundtrack is haunting and the scenery is lush, but the movie's over-all feeling is one of cool detachment and ennui.Unfortunately, there is neither romance nor spy thrills to be had in The Tamarind Seed.",3,Cold War drama left me cold,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1088,"['height', 'Cold', 'War', 'Judith', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'who', 'British', 'Home', 'Office', 'gone', 'Barbados', 'get', 'failed', 'love', 'affair', 'just', 'be', 'staying', 'next', 'door', 'suave', 'Col.', 'Sverdlov', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'highly-placed', 'Russian', 'spy', 'relentlessly', 'then', 'back', 'London', 'want', 'defect', 'West', 'recruit', 'side', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'wonderful', 'such', 'beautiful', 'stars', 'top-notch', 'supporting', 'cast', 'slow', 'confusing', 'dull', 'Andrews', 'never', 'attracted', 'let', 'alone', 'love', 'Colonel', 'stiff', 'uncomfortable', 'wearing', 'wardrobe', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'glamorous', 'silly', 'script', 'Sharif', 'be', 'annoying', 'tiresome', 'overgrown', 'teenager', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'lovely', 'John', 'Barry', 'soundtrack', 'haunting', 'scenery', 'lush', 'movie', 'over-all', 'feeling', 'one', 'cool', 'detachment', 'ennui.Unfortunately', 'romance', 'spy', 'thrills', 'be', 'had', 'Tamarind', 'Seed']",N/A
318960,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,6302530261,Love Our Military Men,"[0, 0]","The TAMARIND SEED from 1974 is a very well done espionage film with a good cast - especially Anthony Quayle as Julie Andrews superior ""Jack Loder"". It's one of my favorite movies. Although a romance eventually develops, Julie Andrews gives a terrific performance in her 'measurable' expressions of uncertainty and distrust towards her new found friend (Omar Sharif) which is realistic and very believable for someone who would have found themselves in her situation. In addition, I found the scripting and dialog between the two to be very engaging, as they discuss )following their initial acquaintance) their philosophical and ideological differences (i.e. Faith in God vs. Atheism - Democracy vs. Communism) while simultaneously being drawn towards one another.And (as always), Anthony Quayle gives a great performance as her critical and suspicious superior (and for good cause!), who, with unfolding events comes to express his care and concern for her personal safety.The picture quality on this instant video transmission is very good and is in widescreen format.THE TAMARIND SEEDRun Time: 2 HoursFormat: Widescreen, Color",5,THE TAMARIND SEED (INSTANT VIDEO) - GREAT ESPIONAGE FILM W/JULIE ANDREWS AND OMAR SHARIF,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1129,"['TAMARIND', 'SEED', '1974', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'espionage', 'film', 'good', 'cast', 'especially', 'Anthony', 'Quayle', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'superior', 'Jack', 'Loder', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'romance', 'eventually', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'terrific', 'performance', ""'measurable"", 'expressions', 'uncertainty', 'distrust', 'towards', 'new', 'found', 'friend', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'realistic', 'very', 'believable', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'situation', 'addition', 'found', 'scripting', 'dialog', 'two', 'be', 'very', 'engaging', 'discuss', 'following', 'initial', 'acquaintance', 'philosophical', 'ideological', 'differences', 'i.e', 'Faith', 'God', 'vs.', 'Atheism', 'Democracy', 'vs', 'Communism', 'simultaneously', 'being', 'drawn', 'towards', 'one', 'another.And', 'always', 'Anthony', 'Quayle', 'great', 'performance', 'critical', 'suspicious', 'superior', 'good', 'cause', 'who', 'unfolding', 'events', 'express', 'care', 'concern', 'personal', 'safety.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'instant', 'video', 'transmission', 'very', 'good', 'widescreen', 'format.THE', 'TAMARIND', 'SEEDRun', 'Time', '2', 'HoursFormat', 'Widescreen', 'Color']",N/A

Culbertson ""sjculb3""","[4, 4]","The Tamarind Seed is not one of those action/thriller spy stories, but rather a slow romance between two people on either side of the Iron Curtain.Julie Andrews plays a secretary off on vacation to Barbados to sort out her feelings from the death of her husband and a love affair that ended badly. One the beach she meets Omar Sherif who is a Russian military attach&Egrave;, supposedly on vacation as well. What follows is a ""who is trying to recruit who""game and the governments behind each player. Is it a real romance? or a cold war spy game?The dialog from Sherif sadly is one of the movies worst points. In between his explaining his philosophy on Marx and how they should keep appearances up , every other line he utters relates on how he wants to sleep with Andrews....throughout the ENTIRE movie.Julie Andrews does a fairly good job as a woman weary of getting involved in another love affair, but her response to Sherif makes her look prudish rather than reluctant.Despite the dialog, both Andrews and Sherif do a decent job. What saves this movie are the subplot involving the British Government trying to support Andrews and the soundtrack by John Barry which really gives this movie a haunting thrill to the story and frankly, quite addictive.Sadly this movie is only available in Australia, Japan and a few other places on DVD.",4,"Romance, spies and the Tamerind Seed",1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,1341,"['Tamarind', 'Seed', 'not', 'one', 'action/thriller', 'spy', 'stories', 'rather', 'slow', 'romance', 'two', 'people', 'side', 'Iron', 'Curtain.Julie', 'Andrews', 'secretary', 'off', 'vacation', 'Barbados', 'sort', 'out', 'feelings', 'death', 'husband', 'love', 'affair', 'ended', 'badly', 'One', 'beach', 'Omar', 'Sherif', 'who', 'Russian', 'military', 'attach', 'Egrave', 'supposedly', 'vacation', 'well', 'What', 'who', 'trying', 'recruit', 'who', 'game', 'governments', 'player', 'real', 'romance', 'cold', 'war', 'spy', 'game', 'dialog', 'Sherif', 'sadly', 'one', 'movies', 'worst', 'points', 'explaining', 'philosophy', 'Marx', 'how', 'should', 'keep', 'appearances', 'up', 'other', 'line', 'relates', 'how', 'sleep', 'Andrews', 'ENTIRE', 'movie.Julie', 'Andrews', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'woman', 'weary', 'getting', 'involved', 'love', 'affair', 'response', 'Sherif', 'look', 'prudish', 'rather', 'reluctant.Despite', 'dialog', 'Andrews', 'Sherif', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'What', 'movie', 'are', 'subplot', 'involving', 'British', 'Government', 'trying', 'support', 'Andrews', 'soundtrack', 'John', 'Barry', 'really', 'movie', 'haunting', 'thrill', 'story', 'frankly', 'quite', 'addictive.Sadly', 'movie', 'only', 'available', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'few', 'other', 'places', 'DVD']",N/A
