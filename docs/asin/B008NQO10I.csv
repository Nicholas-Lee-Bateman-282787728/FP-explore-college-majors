This one shows the romance, the coming out to oneself, the emotional connections of women who are lesbians. I loved it. The actors were remarkable. The story plot has to do with acceptance of who one is and falling in love. while changing, here the parents are understanding which isn't always the case in real life. There wasn't a lot of preaching. It was just a simply lesbian romance of two women who fall in love. One who has acceptance of herself, and one who struggles between an engagement to a man and her new found love for a women. Finally, it doesn't end like many do with the man getting the woman in the end because she can't accept who she is, another tragic thing that tends to happen is movies with Lesbian Romance. If you are homophobic, don't watch this. If you are open to a very good love story regardless of gender, you will enjoy this. If you are just curious, but open to other lifestyles, you will get a more accurate account of how lesbians feel about love, the emotional connection between a romance, and a better realistic of the various lesbians in life since each is unique, beautiful and different.",5,Authentic life style,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,1200,"['lot', 'movies', 'depicting', 'Lesbian', 'lifestyle', 'just', 'sex', 'one', 'romance', 'coming', 'out', 'oneself', 'emotional', 'connections', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'lesbians', 'loved', 'actors', 'were', 'remarkable', 'story', 'plot', 'do', 'acceptance', 'who', 'one', 'falling', 'love', 'changing', 'here', 'parents', 'are', 'understanding', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'real', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'preaching', 'was', 'just', 'simply', 'lesbian', 'romance', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'One', 'who', 'acceptance', 'herself', 'one', 'who', 'engagement', 'man', 'new', 'found', 'love', 'women', 'Finally', ""n't"", 'end', 'many', 'do', 'man', 'getting', 'woman', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'who', 'tragic', 'thing', 'happen', 'movies', 'Lesbian', 'Romance', 'are', 'homophobic', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'are', 'open', 'very', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'regardless', 'gender', 'will', 'enjoy', 'are', 'just', 'curious', 'open', 'other', 'lifestyles', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'accurate', 'account', 'how', 'lesbians', 'feel', 'love', 'emotional', 'connection', 'romance', 'better', 'realistic', 'various', 'lesbians', 'life', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'different']",Kiss Me

1572085,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B008NQO10I,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[46, 51]","""Kiss Me"" is a critically acclaimed film about lesbian love, and, once you watch it, you'll understand why. It not only addresses the love between two women, but also the emotional impact that it leaves in all the involved parties. It is smart, sexy, authentic - perhaps the best lesbian movie that I have had the pleasure the watch, period.Mia (Ruth Vega Fernandez) is happily engaged to Tim (Joakim N&auml;tterqvist), and we meet them at the beginning of the film, making passionate love, and then rushing over to Mia's father, Lasse (Krister Henriksson), 60th birthday party. Once at the party, we are introduced to Lasse's fabulous wife Elisabeth (Lena Endre), and her precious daughter Frida (Liv Mj&ouml;nes).  All is well until Mia and Frida later on go to visit Elisabeth at her country house, in a beautiful island. Lasse was supposed to go, but didn't make it.  Mia was not happy about it, because she wanted to talk to her father. This situation, of course, forces Mia and Frida to spend some time together. One thing leads to another, and Mia and Frida kiss each other, something that Mia regrets afterwards. She tells Frida, ""I'm marrying Tim in a few months. I can't feel this way, don't you see?""Eventually, Mia returns to Tim, and keeps preparing her wedding. Unfortunately, the tension is there, as Mia is in love with Frida, and vice versa - Frida is already a declared lesbian. Lasse, on the other hand, is a distant father, who rather doesn't get involved and tries to ignore the problem, with Elisabeth telling him at one point, ""If you tended your family like your orchids, things would be different.""  All these situations will force Mia to make a hard decision.""Kiss Me"" is well-acted, and is aided greatly by Fernandez' and Mj&ouml;nes' great, beautiful, expressive faces. Hopefully, one day Hollywood will take notice. The underwater scenes, as well as the sexual ones are truly precious. Directed Alexandra-Therese Keining, this is a penetrating and sincere film that won the Audience Award of the Breakthrough Section of the American Film Institute.

1572092,A2ZRMQC485U5WY,B008NQO10I,D. M. Kelley,"[14, 21]","There were a couple things I like about this movie. One, that the lesbian character is in a relationship. Way too many of these straight-woman-married/engaged/in-a-relationship stories have the lesbian hanging out in an isolated world where, of course, she MUST convert a straight woman to her ways in order to have a lover. By taking that factor out, we can more easily believe Frida and Mia like each other, because they like each other. It's not because they are the only two possible people for each other in a straight world or the lesbian must 'convert' someone or be alone. Which is my second winning thing about the movie, Mia's bisexuality as a factor. Once that ""comes out"", it adds a layer to things that again helps makes this less about 'the only two that could  must be"" and two people who chose each other because they want each other.Only, in my opinion, this comes out WAY too late in the film. Life is complicated, but film's should unfold in a linear fashion where the viewer can justify character's actions along the way and if you show me a woman having sex (and seeming to enjoy it) with her man and then half way through the film have herself throw herself at a woman - then damn near run away from it. I'm still thinking she's a woman who's thought herself straight up to now and this 'new' emotion is causing conflict, fine, I'm on that journey with the character. In fact, the character even SAYS as much to Frida. Then to suddenly 'cheat' me and say 'hey, I've actually known I might be bisexual for awhile' feels like just that, a cheat. I shouldn't have to re-watch the movie with the intent of redefining that character journey. There are twist and there are cheats, this just felt like a cheat. My example of a lesbian movies that pulled off the questioning female well 'Loving Annabelle' - as much as that was about the build to a love scene it at least was a logical build to a a love scene. It set up a character reluctant to deal with conflicts in her perception of her own sexuality really early in the film with simple visual clues to a pre-existing relationship, so when this good-girl teacher finally breaks down and sleeps with her female student, I buy it.The thing that really turned me off about this film and made me reluctant to root for the 'couple' was the lack of respect for existing relationships. To have the feelings and walk the fine line of what to do with them is one thing - and great dramatic tension. To throw other people under the bus because there's a jones in your crotch for someone else is another. Kill me, shoot me, but i think 'Imagine, Me, & You' did this particular bit about a thousand times better as did the movie 'When Night is Falling'. In 'Imagine', in addition to developing a relationship between the characters for me to root for, I freakin' loved Heck. I didn't want him hurt and I respected Luce, because she didn't want to hurt him either. In 'When Night is Falling' the out lesbian Petra is aggressive in putting her interest for the other woman out there, but respects whatever line she draws in the sand (to a point). But she also has NO relationship with the character's boyfriend. So while there is an affair present there, as in this film. Her mother isn't marrying the other character's father (as in Kyss Mig) or they haven't hung out and had dinner together (as in Imagine Me & You). She just met someone and she likes her. As for the Camille, who believes she's straight, she has enough of a layered conflict about her sexuality and her relationship that I give her some rope on eventually cheating on her boyfriend.Frida not only had no issue with seducing her future Step-Father's daughter, she threw her girlfriend under the bus. And she'd had a longer relationship with the father than she had with Mia. Yet, she aggressively pursues Mia after that first kiss without reluctance despite having a woman at home and the stress it might put on her mother's relationship with Mia's father, who she allegedly likes. I never got over thinking Frida was a jerk for the way she treated those characters. So much so, I didn't feel a bit sorry for her when things went bad with Mia. And poor Tim. So he was picky about where they lived and had some grand opinions on there wedding. The dude wasn't a bad guy and it seemed like the movie wanted me to believe he was. Yeah, he gets aggressive once in bed, but he backs off when he realizes she's not into it. Because he's desperate and knows he's losing the woman he's invested years with (seven if I remember correctly), yeah he's pushing some angles. He's desperate - just like Frida's girlfriend - to save his relationship. Again, I now like both Elin and Tim MORE than Frida and Mia.Also, if Frida and mom and new step-dad were all thrilled to have Tim around, why wasn't Elin hanging out with the fam? He obviously doesn't mind that Frida is gay as she isn't his daughter, again they blatantly say this in the film. So if lovers are being invited to the table and Frida and step-dad get along so well, Elin's absence seems weird once we know she exist. Another slap in the face viewer 'cheat' early in the film is not revealing this lover exist earlier in the film. And what was the point of not even speaking Elin's name? Hiding Frida's sexuality until later in the film? She's practically undressing Mia with her eyes in the first two seconds, attraction, I get it. She likes girls. There's no value in hiding the girlfriend from the viewer, even if you hide it from Mia so she can have her 'so you like girls moment'. Also once you find out Mia is aware of her own bisexuality, all these moments feel a little like lies targeted at the viewer. I bought sexual confusion in 'Loving Annabelle' (thin as plot was there) way more than I bought it here.The two women the film wanted me to root for were such horrible unfeeling people to their lovers in this film, the people and relationship I found myself rooting for was the one between the parents. That stood the greatest test and showed far more character. Oskar was a total plot device that never was properly developed. We never learn how he feels about anything. Little pre-pubescent 'H' in Imagine Me & You was at least important to the plot and had thoughts, feelings, and reactions to everything. The father-daughter relationship in Kyss Mig also failed to have a satisfying conclusion, beyond 'okay, so my daughter's bisexual'. The complicated emotional layers and divorce issues get lost in the haze of 'will these two characters get together' which at the point, I don't care if they do, because they've both been such horrible people to their lovers and too extraordinarily selfish with little too redeem them.",3,"Okay love story, it's been done better (spoilers)",1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,6711,"['were',

And you'll be happy to see some pretty decent filming and acting compared to most lesbian-themed movies out there... if you don't mind subtitles (It's Swedish).  The blonde (Frida) was certainly pretty.  But the characterization of Mia (brunette) along with all the cheating these leads do kinda put me off.  Ultimately, I thought their chemistry was pretty weak until much later in the film.So Mia is engaged to be married to her boyfriend of 7 years.  It's clear she loves him and is attracted to him.  We even get some heterosexual sex to back this up.  She's extremely anal and closed so you don't think she's anything more than a very uptight straight woman.  I found her only moderately appealing.  Some spoilers ahead....Soon Mia meets Frida.  Both of their parents are to be married to each other so they will be step-sisters.  I didn't see any sparks fly when they met... the impression I got is Mia thought Frida might be hitting on her boyfriend.  So these two end up being stuck together and spending time together.  When they actually kissed, I almost wondered what brought that on.  I just wasn't feeling any valid attraction between these two.  For the most part, the opening is quite slow. Even boring.As it turns out, Frida has a girlfriend and Mia has a bisexual past.  I was annoyed and surprised on both counts because Frida has no qualms whatsoever about cheating and Mia seems frightened to death at the prospect of being attracted to a woman like it was her first time.  Both of these leads totally screw over their partners and I kinda lost respect for them over this.  The way they disrespect their partners didn't make me too hopeful about their own future even if they did get a happy ending.The chemistry did improve once they got it on, to some degree.  It's the only time I feel Mia is actually attracted to Frida!  But this isn't something I'd watch again.  I wasn't really into their attraction too much.  And Mia is a little too uptight and I had a hard time buying her attraction to Frida.  Don't get me wrong, uptight can be very, very sexy because these kinds of women really let loose emotionally and sexually with the right partner.... but I don't think that was captured well here.  Mostly Frida was just plain weak on the seduction and Mia had a stick up her ass right up to the end.

I hate to use the term &#34;lesbian movie&#34; (I never hear the term &#34;heterosexual movie&#34;, but since there are so few good romantic movies involving two women I will use the term so that people that are looking for that type of film will know that this is one.  However, this movie is so well acted that you forget it's about two women, it's just about love and how sometimes it comes at a bad time.  I found the story really plausible and realistic.  And it allows you to empathize with both women even though they are both cheating on their partners.  I read one review that said she didn't like the fact that they were cheating, but that's real life.  Love sneaks up on you when you least expect it.  Sometimes you don't even realize that you were unhappy until someone comes along and makes you truly happy.  This is the kind of film where you forget that you are watching a movie.  The acting is so realistic and flawless.  From the parents, to the women, to their significant others, I hope to see all these actors again.  I especially fell in love with Ruth Vega Fernandez..  So beautiful and real.  If it were up to me she would have won every award possible for this role.I feel like I should mention that if you are looking for a cheesy, soft-core, lesbian sex movie... keep looking.

Her father Lasse (Krister Henriksson) has just asked his partner Elizabeth (Lena Endre) to marry him.  When Mia meets Elizabeth's fun-loving daughter Frida (Liv Mjones), she is initially wary. Reluctantly, she agrees to a weekend getaway on the island of Fyn with Frida and Elizabeth. Forced to share a bedroom with Frida, Mia finds herself fascinated by the other woman's free-spirited enjoyment of life. While out walking in the woods, Mia boldly kisses Frida leading to an amorous embrace.  Frida is ready and willing to reciprocate and the women soon feverishly make love for the first time.The weekend over, Mia must return to Stockholm and her life with Tim and Frida to her partner Elin. Both women find it hard to put the intimacy they shared behind them. Escaping into the windswept Swedish countryside, the women shed their inhibitions once more and in the process fall deeply in love. Their lovemaking scenes show the playfulness and urgency of a new love affair. The intensity of their emotions however, soon overpowers both women and they question whether they really can return to their old lives.Alexandra-Therese Keining's beautifully directed lovemaking scenes sizzle on screen, some with no music at all, just the delightful sounds of two women ardently making love. The beautiful Swedish coast and countryside makes a perfect backdrop for this sensitive portrayal of undeniable attraction and love as it collides with life and family expectations.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",5,Captivating...,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1643,"['Mia', 'Ruth', 'Vega', 'Fernandez', 'engagement', 'boyfriend', 'Tim', 'Joakim', 'Natterqvist', 'father', '60th', 'Birthday', 'Party', 'father', 'Lasse', 'Krister', 'Henriksson', 'just', 'asked', 'partner', 'Elizabeth', 'Lena', 'Endre', 'marry', 'When', 'Mia', 'Elizabeth', 'fun-loving', 'daughter', 'Frida', 'Liv', 'Mjones', 'initially', 'wary', 'Reluctantly', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'island', 'Fyn', 'Frida', 'Elizabeth', 'Forced', 'share', 'bedroom', 'Frida', 'Mia', 'fascinated', 'other', 'woman', 'free-spirited', 'enjoyment', 'life', 'out', 'walking', 'woods', 'Mia', 'boldly', 'Frida', 'leading', 'amorous', 'embrace', 'Frida', 'ready', 'willing', 'reciprocate', 'women', 'soon', 'feverishly', 'make', 'love', 'first', 'time.The', 'weekend', 'Mia', 'must', 'return', 'Stockholm', 'life', 'Tim', 'Frida', 'partner', 'Elin', 'women', 'find', 'hard', 'put', 'intimacy', 'shared', 'Escaping', 'windswept', 'Swedish', 'countryside', 'women', 'shed', 'inhibitions', 'once', 'more', 'process', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'lovemaking', 'scenes', 'show', 'playfulness', 'urgency', 'new', 'love', 'affair', 'intensity', 'emotions', 'however', 'soon', 'overpowers', 'women', 'question', 'really', 'can', 'return', 'old', 'lives.Alexandra-Therese', 'Keining', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'lovemaking', 'scenes', 'sizzle', 'screen', 'music', 'just', 'delightful', 'sounds', 'two', 'women', 'ardently', 'making', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Swedish', 'coast', 'countryside', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'undeniable', 'attraction', 'love', 'life', 'family', 'expectations.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",Kiss Me
