848022,A2EMSQ6TDKGH27,B0002W4U16,"B-Movie Nightmares ""obsessed with cinematic c...","[9, 10]","The above description of the movie is a little misleading; by no means would I describe it as ""gore-soaked"" although there are a couple bloody scenes.  Basically this is a British film from 1978 about an alien who lands on Earth and assumes human form.  He stumbles upon a house occupied by a lesbian couple, who assume he is some kind of halfwit and let him stay awhile.  I remember seeing this one on video under the title ""Alien Prey,"" with the front cover being a big-time spoiler of the one gory scene in the movie!  I rented the DVD, expecting a big gorefest, but instead got a reasonably good, occasionally slow movie with effectively weird moments.This film was directed by Norman J. Warren, whose interview is also featured on the DVD.  Apparently there is a Warren boxset in the works featuring four of his films: Prey, Inseminoid (Horror Planet), and two others.  In the interview, Warren mentions previous softcore sex films that he's done; in fact, Prey features a fair amount of nudity and a really hot lesbian sex scene.  The erotic tension underlying the relationship between the two lesbians and the alien guy is pretty well-communicated here: the ""butch"" is quite jealous of the alien's designs on her more feminine companion.  The whole movie takes place in and around the women's secluded country home; as expected, it looks all to be shot on a shoestring budget but doesn't really suffer for it.  It's well-photographed, with decent, understated performances from the actors and simple dialogue.  Not a penny wasted here.  And what an ending!I'd recommend this film for anyone who likes low-budget sleaze and weirdness, especially you freaks who are into 70's softcore sex films.  I was pleasantly surprised even though I expected something a little more ""gore-soaked.""",4,"Slow-going at times, but worth a look",1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,1790,"['above', 'description', 'movie', 'little', 'misleading', 'means', 'would', 'describe', 'gore-soaked', 'are', 'couple', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'Basically', 'British', 'film', '1978', 'alien', 'who', 'Earth', 'human', 'form', 'house', 'occupied', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'who', 'assume', 'kind', 'halfwit', 'let', 'stay', 'remember', 'seeing', 'one', 'video', 'title', 'Alien', 'Prey', 'front', 'cover', 'being', 'big-time', 'spoiler', 'one', 'gory', 'scene', 'movie', 'rented', 'DVD', 'expecting', 'big', 'gorefest', 'instead', 'got', 'reasonably', 'good', 'occasionally', 'slow', 'movie', 'effectively', 'weird', 'moments.This', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Norman', 'J.', 'Warren', 'interview', 'also', 'featured', 'DVD', 'Apparently', 'Warren', 'boxset', 'works', 'featuring', 'four', 'films', 'Prey', 'Inseminoid', 'Horror', 'Planet', 'two', 'others', 'interview', 'Warren', 'previous', 'softcore', 'sex', 'films', 'done', 'fact', 'Prey', 'fair', 'amount', 'nudity', 'really', 'hot', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'scene', 'erotic', 'tension', 'underlying', 'relationship', 'two', 'lesbians', 'alien', 'guy', 'pretty', 'well-communicated', 'here', 'butch', 'quite', 'jealous', 'alien', 'designs', 'more', 'feminine', 'companion', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'women', 'secluded', 'country', 'home', 'expected', 'be', 'shot', 'shoestring', 'budget', ""n't"", 'really', 'suffer', 'well-photographed', 'decent', 'understated', 'performances', 'actors', 'simple', 'dialogue', 'Not', 'penny', 'wasted', 'here', 'what', 'ending', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'low-budget', 'sleaze', 'weirdness', 'especially', 'freaks', 'who', 'are', '70', 'softcore', 'sex', 'films', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'even', 'expected', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'gore-soaked']",Prey
848023,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B0002W4U16,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[1, 1]","LOL at ""gore-soaked"" remark as this movie has very little gore at all. Most of the gore itself is unconvincing and laughable. I guess Norman thought less is more by shooting the death scenes (without showing the killing itself of the two policemen). If you know a little about the B-Movies Norman has done from ""Inseminoid"" and ""Bloody New Year) (two cheesy classics) then you know what to expect from this movie.The acting is at least passable. The suspense is there but could have a better payoff. Other scenes are just badly put together like the ""rescue"" of the alien which comes across as hilarious with the cheesy 70's music. There is at least some nudity and sex but not nearly enough to warrant repeated viewings of this movie.The movie has a 4.9 score on IMDB which is typically what any Norman J. Warren movies gets (below average score) still if you are in the mood for a different type of alien movie (that is more geared toward drama since the two lesibans take up a bulk of the screen time) than anything else) this might be for you.

848024,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B0002W4U16,Grindhouse and Horror,"[0, 0]","According to IS IT UNCUT magazine #6, this is missing 11 seconds. I've seen the Comet VHS tape and have also seen the ending on a movie called TERROR ON TAPE which is a compilation of horror clips. The ending gore sequence on this DVD ( the only gore scene that's shown on-screen) is noticeably shortened. This censoring of this gruesome and effective sequence damages the film. The movie itself is about a lesbian couple who encounter an alien in human form. They allow the man who appears to be injured to stay with them at there exquisite mansion that's isolated in the forest. When he transforms into the alien, only his nose, eyes and teeth change; he doesn't really look like an alien. There's some topless and rear nudity, as well as a little bit of full frontal during the violent ending sex sequence. A lesbian scene is shown, but it's dimly lit. The film has a low body count, is talky, and it basically concentrates on filming the forest locations along with the rich mansion and providing character development with these 3 people. I thought the directing was good because I like Norman J Warren, but it's a slow film that's also cut.The DVD quality overall is very good, but I thought it could've been a little brighter. You also get a director's interview. I've seen that this film has been released again by Redemption, but I don't know if it's complete for sure because I've never watched it. The British censors typically cut sexually violent scenes, so it might be exactly the same.

848025,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B0002W4U16,The Patriarch,"[0, 7]","The only reason I'd watch a movie this horrible is because I see it as some kind of sick challenge. I can sit through some of the worst movies that were ever made and still emerge with a smile on my face, like somebody that's been punched in the face so many times that they enter a painless euphoria. Well, this only applies to pre-Clinton era movies. There's a new strain in horrible cinema that even I can't stomach.This movie also goes by the name, Alien Prey, mostly because they realized that Prey was just a horrible movie name because it told us nothing about the movie. Of course considering the movie, that's probably for the best.This movie has one and ONLY one redeeming factor. The two leading ladies are lesbians. But they couldn't even get that right, as only one of them is hot! The other looks like Ellen Degenerate on a bad day. And don't expect any action, heavy petting, or even kissing between these two ""love birds."" Not that you'd even want to see that considering how fugley the one looks.Therefore you have no reason to watch this movie. Unless you want to see horrible scenery, hear horrible acting, and watch three people wallow around in a oil slick for 3 hours. Yes, let me get to that, there's a point where the alien begins to drown so the gals try to save him. They wallow in the mud, water, oil, or whatever the heck it's supposed to be for about 10 minutes. That's 10 minutes real time, we get the pleasure of watching this 10 minutes slowed down to a snails pace so it pretty much lasts for the whole movie. Or at least it feels like it, I don't know.Just when you thought this disgusting waste of celluloid could damage Earth's reputation abroad no further...it does. The gals...*grimace...dress the alien up as a women. With make-up, a wig, the whole nine-yards. I should also mention that this movie only has three characters. The two lezzies and the alien. That's it! You see, this is a tribute to the chamber plays such as Igmar Bergman's four character Through a Glass Darkly...No it's not.
