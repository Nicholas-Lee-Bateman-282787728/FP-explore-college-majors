I was so bored with step workouts always being the same up up down down that I decided to try this.  Crunch always has very good workouts and I was not disappointed with this one.  I've done the The Next Step a ton of times since I recieved this dvd.  It is my favorite workout right now and I'm smiling through just about the whole thing.  I like the music for this workout, it really gets you pumping instead of just being played quietly in the background.  There are some problems with the cueing, but once you do it a couple of times you'll have the steps down.",4,A fun step workout!,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,615,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'first', 'workout', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'step', 'workouts', 'always', 'being', 'same', 'down', 'decided', 'try', 'Crunch', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'workouts', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'one', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Next', 'Step', 'ton', 'times', 'recieved', 'dvd', 'favorite', 'workout', 'right', 'now', ""'m"", 'smiling', 'just', 'whole', 'thing', 'music', 'workout', 'really', 'pumping', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'played', 'quietly', 'background', 'are', 'problems', 'cueing', 'once', 'do', 'couple', 'times', ""'ll"", 'have', 'steps', 'down']",N/A
558256,A2W30R08QPWM4M,B00004Y6B4,"Minnesota Raven ""Viking Vixen""","[28, 29]","I used to be a member of a gym where Kendall, the instructor for the Fat Blaster segment, worked.  He was always motivating, nice to people but really not a good live instructor.  He tended to do the same moves over and over and to put together routines that had tricky segways to the next move.  Well I have to give him high marks for this DVD because it's energetic and fun.  I think he has found his calling and there are only a couple of times where he works one side more than the other.  Not enough to get worked up about.  It's short, 22 minutes not counting the warmup and cool down.  Towards the end he does a sort of latin routine which is not very good a maintaining a high cardio level.  In effect you start to cool down before the cool down.  In order to keep my heart rate up where I want it prior to the cool down I just put in some of my own moves.  I would give this DVD 4 stars if he was the only one but the other one...The Step&amp;Sweat DVD is a disaster.  I think most of the moves are too silly to be of value especially those just starting out.  Not enough cueing and not fun.  I give it 2 stars.  The instructor seems nice enough but if you don't want to trip over your own feet stick with Kendall.",3,FAT BLASTER is GREAT....

It is not very challenging from a aerobic stand point, but it is perfect for beginners and for medium/advanced looking for a littler, fun workout for those light days. Love the music the routine is set to.The other routine is just old fashioned and weird, but give it a try, you may like it.",4,Buy it for Kendall,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,378,"['Quick', 'point', 'Kendall', 'workout', 'routing', 'winning', 'combo', 'lots', 'fun', 'not', 'very', 'challenging', 'aerobic', 'stand', 'point', 'perfect', 'beginners', 'medium/advanced', 'looking', 'littler', 'fun', 'workout', 'light', 'days', 'Love', 'music', 'routine', 'set', 'other', 'routine', 'just', 'old', 'fashioned', 'weird', 'give', 'try', 'may', 'like']",N/A

He's such a great instructor (personality, on the beat, great cueing), but i just wish his portion of this dvd was a little bit longer. The warm up is ok, as is the cool-down, and the combinations are great and fun (not too complicated but not too easy or boring either!), except the last one. It slows down too much. But overall, it's a great workout!What i do instead is warm up on my own for 10-15 min.'s (I've been doing step for nearly 10 years, so i can do this easily), then do my own routine when things slow down in the last portion. (i know enough to do my own steps for that short amount of time). That way, i get a good 45 minute workout (30 minutes just seems too short for me.)Also, i wish at the end, he would review each combination and put them all together for one last go-through. I think that would be fun, because that's what many of the instructors at my gym do. (plus, it would lengthen the time!)As for the other part, i didn't like it. Her cueing is a bit late, plus she calls the steps different names. And i didn't like the routines. But i got this video for Kendell anyway! It's just too bad because i was hoping to get a great 2nd workout routine in addition to his.",3,"Could be much better, but i LOVE Kendell!!!",1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,1216,"['just', 'love', 'Kendell', 'such', 'great', 'instructor', 'personality', 'beat', 'great', 'cueing', 'i', 'just', 'wish', 'portion', 'dvd', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'warm', 'up', 'ok', 'cool-down', 'combinations', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'not', 'too', 'complicated', 'not', 'too', 'easy', 'boring', 'last', 'one', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'great', 'workout', 'What', 'do', 'instead', 'warm', 'up', 'own', '10-15', 'min', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'step', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'easily', 'then', 'do', 'own', 'routine', 'when', 'things', 'slow', 'down', 'last', 'portion', 'i', 'know', 'enough', 'do', 'own', 'steps', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'way', 'i', 'get', 'good', '45', 'minute', 'workout', '30', 'minutes', 'just', 'too', 'short', 'Also', 'i', 'wish', 'end', 'would', 'review', 'combination', 'put', 'together', 'one', 'last', 'go-through', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'what', 'many', 'instructors', 'gym', 'do', 'would', 'lengthen', 'time', 'other', 'part', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'cueing', 'bit', 'late', 'steps', 'different', 'names', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'routines', 'i', 'got', 'video', 'Kendell', 'anyway', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'i', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'great', '2nd', 'workout', 'routine', 'addition']",N/A

There were a few tricky moves, but managable and still fun.  The other workout is very boring.

558260,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B00004Y6B4,Teedums,"[1, 1]","I bought this DVD mainly for Kendell Hogan's The Next Step workout.  It's short, not too complex and a fun routine, with just a couple flaws.  I think the cueing could have been better, I ended up on the wrong foot quite a bit but I am kind of a clod to begin with.Also, I would have preferred a simpler warmup, it wasn't hard by any means, but there was a fair amount of jumping, higher impact moves.  I thought it was supposed to be a warmup???  Plus, I have to limit my high impact activities, there was a modifier for the workout itself, I would have liked a modifier here too, or keep the warmup simple at the very least.The workout itself is a lot of fun, the choreography isn't too difficult.  You see basic steps, step knees, turn steps, Z steps which I have never seen before, among others.  There is a bit of a Latin flavor to it, which I enjoyed.  The music went with it well and there is even a live drummer who plays along, seems to be having a good time himself.  There are quite a few background gals along with Kendell, they seem to be having a great time.  Crunch workouts are known for their high whooping factor, but it doesn't bother me here at all, I think it fits the atmosphere.  I didn't feel it was excessive either, not compared to other Crunch workouts where it was downright annoying.There are three combinations, the last one doesn't use the step as much, but it's fun anyway.  Mixed in with the combinations are some cardio challenges, the most difficult being some plyo squat jumps.  I can manage these okay, but try to keep the rest of the high impact out of it.Overall, a fun workout, I do like it even though it may not be the best choice for my abilities.  But I try and work around it as best as I can because I do enjoy it.  Kendell does a great job instructing, he is the perfect lead for this, very lively instructor.  I like it when he dances at the end with all the girls.I can't comment much on Step & Sweat, I have attempted this workout a couple of times.  I didn't last longer than 10 minutes either time.  The cueing wasn't great, and the choreography was overly complex and really a pain to try and master.  Needless to say, I lost my patience and haven't had the desire to try again.  Michelle Nevidomsky (now Dozois) leads this along with 2 backgrounders, one of which modifies a bit.  Michelle is a fine instructor, but this just didn't work for me, and others too based on the previous reviews.I still rate this 4 stars, but it's only worth it for The Next Step in my opinion.",4,One good step workout and one bad...,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,2527,"['bought', 'DVD', 'mainly', 'Kendell', 'Hogan', 'Next', 'Step', 'workout', 'short', 'not', 'too', 'complex', 'fun', 'routine', 'just', 'couple', 'flaws', 'think', 'cueing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ended', 'up', 'wrong', 'foot', 'quite', 'bit', 'am', 'kind', 'clod', 'begin', 'with.Also', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'simpler', 'warmup', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'means', 'there', 'was', 'fair', 'amount', 'jumping', 'higher', 'impact', 'moves', 'thought', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'warmup', 'have', 'limit', 'high', 'impact', 'activities', 'was', 'modifier', 'workout', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'modifier', 'here', 'too', 'keep', 'warmup', 'simple', 'very', 'least.The', 'workout', 'lot', 'fun', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'too', 'difficult', 'see', 'basic', 'steps', 'step', 'knees', 'turn', 'steps', 'Z', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'others', 'bit', 'Latin', 'flavor', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'went', 'well', 'even', 'live', 'drummer', 'who', 'along', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'background', 'gals', 'Kendell', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'Crunch', 'workouts', 'are', 'known', 'high', 'whooping', 'factor', ""n't"", 'bother', 'here', 'think', 'atmosphere', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'excessive', 'either', 'not', 'compared', 'other', 'Crunch', 'workouts', 'where', 'was', 'downright', 'annoying.There', 'are', 'three', 'combinations', 'last', 'one', ""n't"", 'use', 'step', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'anyway', 'Mixed', 'combinations', 'are', 'cardio', 'challenges', 'most', 'difficult', 'being', 'plyo', 'squat', 'jumps', 'can', 'manage', 'okay', 'try', 'keep', 'rest', 'high', 'impact', 'it.Overall', 'fun', 'workout', 'do', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'choice', 'abilities', 'try', 'work', 'around', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Kendell', 'great', 'job', 'instructing', 'perfect', 'lead', 'very', 'lively', 'instructor', 'like', 'when', 'end', 'girls.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'much', 'Step', 'Sweat', 'have', 'attempted', 'workout', 'couple', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'longer', '10', 'minutes', 'time', 'cueing', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'choreography', 'was', 'overly', 'complex', 'really', 'pain', 'try', 'master', 'Needless', 'say', 'lost', 'patience', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'desire', 'try', 'again', 'Michelle', 'Nevidomsky', 'now', 'Dozois', '2', 'backgrounders', 'one', 'bit', 'Michelle', 'fine', 'instructor', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'others', 'too', 'based', 'previous', 'reviews.I', 'still', 'rate', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'worth', 'Next', 'Step', 'opinion']",N/A
