865543,AO7RFXGXSY3LN,B0006FFRBG,"Amy Wallace ""Buttonsamy""","[4, 4]","I stumbled upon ""One Tree Hill"" after a good friend of mine mentioned it. I took a look at the box and sniffed. I avoided watching it for months, thinking it would be a cheap knockoff of ""Dawson's Creek"". I wanted something fresh and original. It took one episode to get me totally hooked, and ""One Tree Hill"" lived up to my high standards.Ok, so the basic plot is about half brothers: Nathan and Lucas, and basketball. Lucas (the main character) lives with his mom, and plays basketball outside of school. Nathan lives with his father, (also Lucas' father) who was a basketball star, and wants his son to follow in his footsteps. Nathan's father denies being Lucas' father, but everyone knows that he is. Lucas is invited to play varsity basketball with Nathan, which starts a conflict between the brothers, who had avoided one another previously. The entire show involves Lucas and Nathan and their friends and family, and makes the audience wonder how it will turn out.Now, I am pretty picky when it comes to TV shows. I want them to be original, interesting and engaging, and leave the audience wanting more. This is a more adult show than most of today's teenage dramas, making it an excellent show for teens and their parents, or just us adults. ;) The characters are all well-rounded and have unique and interesting personalities, and are not your stereotypical ""popular crowd"". Each character has a unique trait that makes them easy to relate to.I'd recommend this TV show to anyone who likes basketball, teenage drama or ""Freaks and Geeks"" This show is like seeing the other side of the freaks and geeks, and realizing that their lives are not so different after all.",5,Unusual teen drama that's more adult than your average show,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,1676,"['stumbled', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'good', 'friend', 'mine', 'mentioned', 'took', 'look', 'box', 'sniffed', 'avoided', 'watching', 'months', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'cheap', 'knockoff', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'wanted', 'something', 'fresh', 'original', 'took', 'one', 'episode', 'get', 'totally', 'hooked', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'lived', 'up', 'high', 'standards.Ok', 'basic', 'plot', 'half', 'brothers', 'Nathan', 'Lucas', 'basketball', 'Lucas', 'main', 'character', 'mom', 'basketball', 'school', 'Nathan', 'father', 'also', 'Lucas', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'basketball', 'star', 'son', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Nathan', 'father', 'being', 'Lucas', 'father', 'everyone', 'Lucas', 'invited', 'play', 'varsity', 'basketball', 'Nathan', 'conflict', 'brothers', 'who', 'had', 'avoided', 'one', 'previously', 'entire', 'show', 'Lucas', 'Nathan', 'friends', 'family', 'audience', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'turn', 'out.Now', 'am', 'pretty', 'picky', 'when', 'TV', 'shows', 'want', 'be', 'original', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'leave', 'audience', 'wanting', 'more', 'more', 'adult', 'show', 'most', 'today', 'teenage', 'dramas', 'making', 'excellent', 'show', 'teens', 'parents', 'just', 'adults', 'characters', 'are', 'well-rounded', 'have', 'unique', 'interesting', 'personalities', 'are', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'popular', 'crowd', 'character', 'unique', 'trait', 'easy', 'relate', 'to.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'TV', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'basketball', 'teenage', 'drama', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'show', 'seeing', 'other', 'side', 'freaks', 'geeks', 'realizing', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'different']",N/A

865547,A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4,B0006FFRBG,Brandon L. Harlow,"[3, 4]","What an amazing and exciting show. The focus on plot development and character study is tremendous and is proof as to why it outshines other contemporary shows like The O.C. (which really stinks). The plot concerns two half-brothers, the withdrawn Lucas and the popular lil s.o.b. Nathan and their struggles on the local high school basketball. I know it may sound cliched, but trust me...there is a really great pay-off. When Lucas's mom, Karen (played by the extraordinarily talented Moira Kelly), was in high school she dreamed of marrying her sweetie Dan, the hometown hero jock. Well after she gets knocked up, he leaves for college where he almost immediately impregnates freshmen Deb. Karen stays behind and raises Lucas on her own while struggling to make ends meet running a cafe. Dan and Deb move home with new son Nathan and start a successful car dealership (on Deb's family money). Add to the mix Keith, Dan's brother and wannabe lover to Karen/dad to Lucas and you get a great deal of potential storylines. Then there are the high school kids with the standout having to be Bethany Joy Lenz. Peyton is a bit annoying with her punk rock cheerleader chic, but still the show rises above typical Dawson-style mediocrity. The stand-out though has to be Paul Johannsen as the evil Dan. He is like J.R. and Alexis all rolled up into one!

Tuesdays are my new favorite night of the week because of the prime-time line-up (combined from both ABC and The WB). I bought the 1st-Season DVD set the day it came out and watched the entire first season in less than 4 days. Believe me, for those who have watched the show and weren't able to get into it due to a lack of understanding of the characters (*cough* Paola *cough* - lol), if you take the time out to give it a chance you will definately be pleased with the results, as this is one of the most intriguing and entertaining shows on television today (I personally think that it is better than The O.C., while my younger sister on the other hand, who also watches both shows, disagrees).What's interesting about the second season is that it follows right where the first left off, so it's not like it's starting a year later, the characters are still 17, the basketball season is over, and there is more focus on other aspects of the characters lives. I hope that they focus on the Ravens basketball team in Season 3, with Tree Hill winning the championship as Lucas and Nathan finish off high school on a high note (they are juniors now right?).This show is the best!!!",5,OTH Is  My Favorite Show on Television,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,1297,"['started', 'watching', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'sixth', 'episode', '2nd', 'season', 'then', 'have', 'become', 'addicted', 'Tuesdays', 'are', 'new', 'favorite', 'night', 'week', 'prime-time', 'line-up', 'combined', 'ABC', 'WB', 'bought', '1st-Season', 'DVD', 'set', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'watched', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'less', '4', 'days', 'Believe', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'due', 'lack', 'understanding', 'characters', '*cough*', 'Paola', '*cough*', 'lol', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'give', 'chance', 'will', 'definately', 'be', 'pleased', 'results', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'shows', 'television', 'today', 'personally', 'think', 'better', 'O.C.', 'younger', 'sister', 'other', 'hand', 'who', 'also', 'shows', 'disagrees', '.What', 'interesting', 'second', 'season', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'not', 'starting', 'year', 'later', 'characters', 'are', 'still', '17', 'basketball', 'season', 'more', 'focus', 'other', 'aspects', 'characters', 'hope', 'focus', 'Ravens', 'basketball', 'team', 'Season', '3', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'winning', 'championship', 'Lucas', 'Nathan', 'finish', 'off', 'high', 'school', 'high', 'note', 'are', 'juniors', 'now', 'right', '.This', 'show', 'best']",N/A
865550,AYXZU81PMZBKC,B0006FFRBG,"Christopher Wood ""anima300""","[3, 3]","I don't usually watch Prime Time TV, because I don't really have the time at those hours, and more importantly, I'd have a really tough time only watching one episode...  One Tree Hill is one of those shows where, I'd be grabbing my face and screaming much like Macauley Culkin in Home Alone.That said, One Tree Hill sports quite a few different characters, most of which going through huge trait changes as the season wears on, which is really important in these types of shows.  If your characters don't change, and don't react to consequences, then, it makes things rather boring, and you stop caring about everybody.One Tree Hill stars Chad Michael Murray ( Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek ) as Lucas Scott, estranged son from an uncaring father, living alone with his mother, Karen, (Moira Kelly, The Cutting Edge) on the other side of town who'd rather play two-on-two with his friends on the River Court.  After his uncle, Keith Scott (Craig Sheffer, The Program) goads coach Whitey Durham (Barry Corbin) to coax Lucas on the basketball team, it creates a rift with half-brother Nathan (James Lafferty), and the father, Dan (Paul Johannson).  Once Lucas joins the team, everything changes with everybody, including Lucas's best friend, Haley James (Bethany Joy Lenz), and Peyton's best friend, Brooke (Sophia Bush).This isn't just a basketball story.  It's a struggle about teens, and adults trying to find themselves, and denying who they are, and what they want.  It's enjoyable to watch how far all the main characters change, not necessarily for the better, but they all change.  Not only do main characters change, but relationships change.  Unlike The O.C., and Dawson's Creek, there isn't really a huge focus on one guy trying to get with the one girl, or vice versa.  Things occur naturally.There are many real-life situations discussed and seen:  A pregnancy which gives off a fear of history repeating itself, date rape drugs and parties, the intracacies and responsibilities involved with drinking, family death, divorce, overbearing parents,Many scenes and episodes are tear-jerking, and somewhat frustrating at times.  Everybody on this show has a heart, even Dan, and everybody's heart gets broken one way or another.  But the true focus is how Lucas, Nathan, Haley, Peyton, Brooke, and Jake really become pretty decent friends, and how they would really do anything for each other.  It's one of those shows where you kind of wish you lived in their world, because a lot of it is so sweet, and surreal that you almost find yourself immersed in it in your imagination.In conclusion, this is worth the buy.  If you've never seen or heard of this show before, it's a little tough to just buy it on a whim, which I do all the time, but trust me on this one.  This isn't your regular teen soap opera.

The show follows characters who are closely intertwined into each others lives. The character development on this show is astounding. The plots move along swiftly without sacrificing character develop. The two are so closely together and that is how a show should be written, where it seems like what the character is doing is realisitic, while moving the plot along to keep it interesting. The show follows two brothers, Lucas and Nathan, who share the same father, but different mothers. Their father Dan walked out on Lucas' mom Karen when she was pregnant, and got Nathan's mother Deb pregnant soon after. The show explores the hurt of that deception, and the depth of it as well. Lucas finds attraction in both Brooke and Peyton, while Nathan goes after Lucas' best friend Haley to get to him, only to really fall in love with her. The cast is a great ensemble of talented actors and actresses. The writing is top notch.

Most shows do not want to go so fast in hopes they can chug along for a few seasons before having any major changes but not OTH.

Haley was just a side character as Lucas' best friend and ended up becoming one of the most iconic characters in the entire nine year span of the show.  Peyton was actually not bad in the first season and it is a shame the writers made her such a victim in later years.  Even Brooke started out as a caricature and became something real by the end of the season.

Every character has a major role in the show & from the pilot episode to the season finale, every character faces something major and has to deal. They say OTH is the new Dawson's Creek, but I think OTH leaves Dawson's Creek in the dust. The writing is great. It's touching without being too cheesy. It's funny without being stupid. And it's closer to realistic than any other show on the WB or on TV for that matter. Chad Michael Murray, James Lafferty, Hilarie Burton, Bethany Joy Lenz, Sophia Bush, Craig Sheffer & Moira Kelley all do amazing jobs on the show as well as the supporting cast. They get better and better each episode. There wasn't one episode that didn't hold my attention. Especially towards the end of the season, things really get you hooked. Peyton (Hilarie Burton) would have to be my favorite character. Her drawings & her behavior are so realistic & they really remind me of myself & alot of other kids my age I know. Another great thing about this show is that it doesn't just focus on the love story. But it's hard to root for a couple, because you find things about every single one that you like that the other one just doesn't have. It really entertains. With everything that's on TV lately & all the stupid reality shows, OTH is something new & fun to watch. It'll have you coming back every week. Season 2 is currently airing on the WB.

But unlikely so many other trite tee-a-ramas, One Tree Hill is all drama of ""ER"" combined with the humor of ""Buffy"" all in a rather surprising and quirky package.Lucas is a heart of gold character with the will to save everyone, who meets a girl, Peyton, a dark/slightly Goth cheerleader with a razor tongue. Peyton is the character that definitely won me over; she has this vulnerable sadness that just makes you ache for her to be happy.Brooke, though a typical witch character...has a more hooker with a heart of gold complex. One side of her is so good, and one side is just rotten. Much so on Peyton's character (her ""best"" friend) than anyone else. Always keep one eye glued on Brooke, or she may stab it out.Along with the many sorted characters are Nathan and Haley, and odd pair that just happened to be the fairy tale couple of the series. Haley her innocent charms, and Nathan with his Jock bravado.Then there are the 'rents.

Dan's brother Keith(Craig Sheffer)became very close to Karen, and helped to raise Lucas. The two brothers soon come into conflict however, when the school basketball coach (Barry Corbin) convinces Lucas to try out for the school team. Now Nathan's position as the best player in the school is soon threatened when Lucas shows that he is just as talented. If things weren't already complicated enough, Nathan's girlfriend Peyton(Hilarie Burton) is thrown into the mix when she begins to develop feelings for Lucas which only heats up the rivalry between the two brothers even further.If you were to ask a random person what the best teenage soap on the air was today, you would most likely be told ""The O.C."". While I do agree that The O.C. is a very good show, One Tree Hill is actually better in my opinion. The best thing about One Tree Hill is that it combines elements of a sports drama with those of your basic teenage soap. The combination of the two results in top notch drama, basketball action, and romance. The acting on this show is suprisingly good! Perhaps the best character on the show is the boys' father Dan. Paul Johansson turns the character into the guy that you love to hate. The character is also very entertaining to watch because he often manages to manipulate the other characters in the show. Before One Tree Hill I was not really a fan of Chad Michael Murray. I always saw him as a guy who was cashing in on his looks and not really coming through with much acting ability. But in One Tree Hill, he really does a good job as the brooding Lucas Scott. James Lafferty is perhaps the most underrated actor of the whole show because he turns in an even better performance than Murray and he is often overshadowed because he is an unknown actor. Moria Kelly, Craig Schiffer, Barry Corbin, Hillary Burton, and the rest of the cast all do a fantastic job as well.Overall One Tree Hill is probably one of the best shows on television. Some people like to think of the show as a sports drama, while others love it for the romance and the other elements of a teenage soap. But whatever you classify One Tree Hill as, most will agree that it is a very good show overall. The acting, basketball action, romance, and drama are all top notch. I am very glad that the show is coming to DVD. The special features add an extra incentive to buy this set. They include commentary on four different episodes, two featurettes, a gag reel, deleted scenes, and more.A solid 5 stars...",5,"In my opinion, it's better than The O.C.!!",1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,2942,"['One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'deals', 'two', 'estranged', 'half', 'brothers', 'Lucas', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'Nathan', 'James', 'Lafferty', 'are', 'star', 'basketball', 'players', 'Nathan', 'was', 'raised', 'boys', 'father', 'Dan', 'Paul', 'Johansson', 'given', 'life', 'privelege', 'Lucas', 'was', 'raised', 'alone', 'mother', 'Karen', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'who', 'became', 'pregnant', 'Lucas', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'only', 'be', 'abandoned', 'Dan', 'when', 'went', 'college', 'met', 'married', 'Nathan', 'mother', 'Dan', 'brother', 'Keith', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'became', 'very', 'close', 'Karen', 'helped', 'raise', 'Lucas', 'two', 'brothers', 'soon', 'come', 'conflict', 'however', 'when', 'school', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Lucas', 'try', 'out', 'school', 'team', 'Now', 'Nathan', 'position', 'best', 'player', 'school', 'soon', 'threatened', 'when', 'Lucas', 'just', 'as', 'talented', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'already', 'complicated', 'enough', 'Nathan', 'girlfriend', 'Peyton', 'Hilarie', 'Burton', 'thrown', 'mix', 'when', 'develop', 'feelings', 'Lucas', 'only', 'up', 'rivalry', 'two', 'brothers', 'even', 'further.If', 'were', 'ask', 'random', 'person', 'what', 'best', 'teenage', 'soap', 'air', 'was', 'today', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'told', 'O.C.', 'do', 'agree', 'O.C', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'actually', 'better', 'opinion', 'best', 'thing', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'elements', 'sports', 'drama', 'basic', 'teenage', 'soap', 'combination', 'two', 'results', 'top', 'notch', 'drama', 'action', 'romance', 'acting', 'show', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'character', 'show', 'boys', 'father', 'Dan', 'Paul', 'Johansson', 'character', 'guy', 'love', 'hate', 'character', 'also', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'often', 'manipulate', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'always', 'saw', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'cashing', 'looks', 'not', 'really', 'coming', 'much', 'acting', 'ability', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'brooding', 'Lucas', 'Scott', 'James', 'Lafferty', 'perhaps', 'most', 'underrated', 'actor', 'whole', 'show', 'even', 'better', 'performance', 'Murray', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'unknown', 'actor', 'Moria', 'Kelly', 'Craig', 'Schiffer', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Hillary', 'Burton', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'well.Overall', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'people', 'think', 'show', 'sports', 'drama', 'others', 'love', 'romance', 'other', 'elements', 'teenage', 'soap', 'classify', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'most', 'will', 'agree', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'overall', 'acting', 'action', 'romance', 'drama', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'show', 'coming', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'add', 'extra', 'incentive', 'buy', 'set', 'include', 'commentary', 'four', 'different', 'episodes', 'two', 'featurettes', 'gag', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[64, 69]","When I originally heard about the show ""One Tree Hill"" I couldn't help but think that it was going to be nothing more than a rip-off of ""Dawson's Creek"" which was one of the WB highest rated shows (and ended it's 6 year run 4 month before ""one tree hill"" premiered).  But as a fan of the WB I tuned into the Pilot of the show.  And the Pilot was bad, but it showed potential so I continued to watch the show and after about 8/9 rocky episodes, the show finally found it's footing and starting slowly to becoming one of my favorite shows on the air.The show is about two brothers who grew up in the small town of tree hill and yet they barely know each other.  Luke, who along with his mother was abandoned by his father before he was born, is the outsider; while Nate, who his father considers to be his only son, grew up to become one of the popular kids in school.  But when Luke join's Nate's Basketball team, the two brothers beging to breakdown the years of walls their father has put between them.Warner Brother's has put together a really nice set, releasing it a little earlier than usual (they usually wait til at least the third season of a show to release the first on DVD).  The Set comes packaged the same was as all of Warner Brother's other WB sets (bookstyle packaging).
