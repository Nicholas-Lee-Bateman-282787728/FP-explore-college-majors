842778,ARMWTU2IDP4H5,B0002PUFW6,Chris Ohsiek,"[9, 12]","After looking at other reviews, I didnt realize the episodes are edited.  I feel kind of cheated!  But then again I must've only seen them edited in syndication back in the '80's & early '90's.  This was the most popular version & cast lineup & popular of the entire 11 season run & of the final 7 seasons when moved to CBS. (Why did Sherry Jackson have to quit after season 5 or why was Terry written out & why couldn't Miss Jackson come back for Terry's wedding in season 7 instead of unknown Penny Parker thus not being able to show flashback's when Terry was younger.  Was Miss Parker's Terry older than Miss Jackson's or did Terry get courted & married at age 18?)  It's great to see again after an abscence of 13-14 years after Nick at Nite discontinued showing after Mr. Thomas passed away spring '91.  By the way Nick at Nite from what I remember only showed seasons 5-8.  I had never seen an episode beyond that until summer '90 when an independent station where I was living at the time continued to season 9 (Angela Cartwright starts to look more & more like Brigita Von Trapp & Penny Robinson instead of 5yo Linda Williams & Rusty Hamer's Rusty Williams has gone through puberty & his voice has changed).  I didnt know that the Williams moved into two more apartments or condos & the sets were different for seasons 8 & 9. But partway into season 9 Nick at Nite must've discovered someone else was broadcasting on free antenna tv & bought out all syndicated rights because that channel stopped showing.  I had never seen the first version or ABC version until I bought the inexpensive samplers of the first 3 seasons.  I always thought of oldest child Terry as a teen & figured from pictures of season 1 that she must've been a younger girl at one time & Rusty Hamer was predessor of Angela Cartwright as the youngest cutest one who gets all the attention.  I can see why season 5 was the first to be available to the public because that's also the first season of the CBS years & cast lineup that most people of my generation who grew up watching reruns in the '70's & '80's are familiar with.  I didnt know there was an earlier version until about '87 or '88 when I checked out a tv trivia book at a local library & that's when I wondered why is Linda older than Rusty & Rusty so young?  Even if each is edited, when are the first four seasons, in a different apartment & set w/Terry & Rusty's birth mother, going to be released? How about also rereleasing season 5 unedited?  I'll gladly pay another $50 & sell the edited set even though I'll probably only get $5 for it.  Can season 6 at least be released sometime soon & the remaining Marjorie Lord seasons annually afterwards even if edited? You know I wonder if the first 3 seasons were never shown in syndication or on Nick at Nite or not available because the samplers include original footage of tobacco companies presenting & sponsoring in the first season opening credits?But anyway, I suppose it's recommended if you love this show, even if it's only the first version, or it's your first time & dying to see, to purchase this set.  It's better than nothing & it wouldn't suprise me Questar & Mr. Thomas' surviving family decide to soon remove from the market & consider this entire series out-of-print & secured in a vault permanently.  By the way, if you love the cast besides ""Sound of Music"" & ""Lost in Space"" I also recommend the following:  ""Singin' in the Rain"" (& I thought that was actually the way Miss Hagen talked until I saw a first version episode for the first time) ""I'll See You in my Dreams"" ""The Jazz Singer"" (original '40's version if not out of print, not the retarded '80 remake) "" ""Batman ('66-'68) season 1"" and ""Charlie's Angels season 4"" (when these are released)  One last thought:  what about releasing two followup reunions?  '67's pilot ""Make More Room for Daddy"" & the short-lived ""Make Room for Grandaddy"" ('70-'71 w/original CBS cast including Sherry Jackson)",3,"love the show, when will more seasons be released?",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,3967,"['looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'didnt', 'realize', 'episodes', 'are', 'edited', 'feel', 'kind', 'cheated', 'then', 'again', 'must', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'edited', 'syndication', 'back', ""'80"", 'early', ""'90"", 'was', 'most', 'popular', 'version', 'cast', 'lineup', 'popular', 'entire', '11', 'season', 'run', 'final', '7', 'seasons', 'when', 'moved', 'CBS', 'Why', 'did', 'Sherry', 'Jackson', 'have', 'quit', 'season', '5', 'why', 'was', 'Terry', 'written', 'out', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Miss', 'Jackson', 'come', 'back', 'Terry', 'wedding', 'season', '7', 'instead', 'unknown', 'Penny', 'Parker', 'thus', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'show', 'flashback', 'when', 'Terry', 'was', 'younger', 'Was', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'Terry', 'older', 'Miss', 'Jackson', 'did', 'Terry', 'get', 'courted', 'married', 'age', '18', 'great', 'see', 'again', 'abscence', '13-14', 'years', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'discontinued', 'showing', 'Mr.', 'Thomas', 'passed', 'away', 'spring', ""'91"", 'way', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'what', 'remember', 'only', 'showed', 'seasons', '5-8', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'summer', ""'90"", 'when', 'independent', 'station', 'where', 'was', 'living', 'time', 'continued', 'season', '9', 'Angela', 'Cartwright', 'look', 'more', 'more', 'Brigita', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'Penny', 'Robinson', 'instead', '5yo', 'Linda', 'Williams', 'Rusty', 'Hamer', 'Rusty', 'Williams', 'gone', 'puberty', 'voice', 'changed', 'didnt', 'know', 'Williams', 'moved', 'two', 'more', 'apartments', 'condos', 'sets', 'were', 'different', 'seasons', '8', '9', 'partway', 'season', '9', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'must', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'broadcasting', 'free', 'antenna', 'tv', 'bought', 'out', 'all', 'syndicated', 'rights', 'channel', 'stopped', 'showing', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'first', 'version', 'ABC', 'version', 'bought', 'inexpensive', 'samplers', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'always', 'thought', 'oldest', 'child', 'Terry', 'teen', 'figured', 'pictures', 'season', '1', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'younger', 'girl', 'one', 'time', 'Rusty', 'Hamer', 'was', 'predessor', 'Angela', 'Cartwright', 'youngest', 'cutest', 'one', 'who', 'attention', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'season', '5', 'was', 'first', 'be', 'available', 'public', 'also', 'first', 'season', 'CBS', 'years', 'cast', 'lineup', 'most', 'people', 'generation', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'reruns', ""'70"", ""'80"", 'are', 'familiar', 'didnt', 'know', 'was', 'earlier', 'version', ""'87"", ""'88"", 'when', 'checked', 'out', 'tv', 'trivia', 'book', 'local', 'library', 'when', 'wondered', 'why', 'Linda', 'older', 'Rusty', 'Rusty', 'young', 'Even', 'edited', 'when', 'are', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'different', 'apartment', 'set', 'w/Terry', 'Rusty', 'birth', 'mother', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'How', 'also', 'rereleasing', 'season', '5', 'unedited', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'pay', '50', 'sell', 'edited', 'set', 'even', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'only', 'get', '5', 'Can', 'season', '6', 'least', 'be', 'released', 'sometime', 'soon', 'remaining', 'Marjorie', 'Lord', 'seasons', 'annually', 'afterwards', 'even', 'edited', 'know', 'wonder', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'were', 'never', 'shown', 'syndication', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'not', 'available', 'samplers', 'include', 'original', 'footage', 'tobacco', 'companies', 'presenting', 'sponsoring', 'first', 'season', 'opening', 'credits', 'anyway', 'suppose', 'recommended', 'love', 'show', 'even', 'only', 'first', 'version', 'first', 'time', 'dying', 'see', 'purchase', 'set', 'better', 'nothing', 'would', ""n't"", 'suprise', 'Questar', 'Mr.', 'Thomas', 'surviving', 'family', 'decide', 'soon', 'remove', 'market', 'consider', 'entire', 'series', 'out-of-print', 'secured', 'vault', 'permanently', 'way', 'love', 'cast', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Lost', 'Space', 'also', 'recommend', 'following', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'way', 'Miss', 'Hagen', 'talked', 'saw', 'first', 'version', 'episode', 'first', 'time', ""'ll"", 'See', 'Dreams', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'original', ""'40"", 'version', 'not', 'print', 'not', 'retarded', ""'80"", 'remake', 'Batman', ""'66-'68"", 'season', '1', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'season', '4', 'when', 'are', 'released', 'One', 'last', 'thought', 'what', 'releasing', 'two', 'followup', 'reunions', 'pilot', 'Make', 'More', 'Room', 'Daddy', 'short-lived', 'Make', 'Room', 'Grandaddy', ""'70-'71"", 'w/original', 'CBS', 'cast', 'including', 'Sherry', 'Jackson']",Make Room For Daddy - The Complete Fifth Season

Earles ""Jaynrand""","[108, 112]","Well - as other reviewers here have pointed out, there are serious problems with this release.""Make Room for Daddy"" was an important and popular television series.  It was THE Desilu product that inherited the coveted Monday night at 9 p.m. slot vacated by ""I Love Lucy"" when it switched to an hour-long/once a month format starting in the fall of 1957.Danny Thomas starring as Danny Williams moved from ABC with his two children Terry (Sherry Jackson) and Rusty (Rusty Hamer). He had been raising them since the death of his wife (played in earlier seasons by Jean Hagen).  Along with the kids, Danny brought a new wife Kathryn Daley O'Hara Williams (Marjorie Lord) and her daughter Linda (Angela Cartwright).This is the complete 5th season.  There is also the final episode of the 4th season - where Danny proposes to Kathy.  And as an extra, the 1960 episode that served as a sort of pilot for what became ""The Andy Griffith Show.""All of the humor and love among the characters that you might fondly remember is here.  Danny sings some terrific songs, and there are some great guest stars.  Jackson, Hamer, and Cartwright each have moments to shine and take advantage of them.  Lord is one of the most lovely TV ""moms"" of the 1950's. Her clothes by Emeson's of Studio City are au courant for the time.  Also featured in many episodes is Amanda Randolph as Louise, the maid.Danny does some great spit takes - he was the master.  And there is the familiar gesture he made: a quickly upturned palm with a grunt that Hamer can imitate to perfection.There is no list of the episodes except on the disks themselves, but they seem to be in chronological order.  The transfer is very soft and there doesn't seem to have been a lot of digital enhancement on them.  Certainly for the SRP for the 34 + 2 episodes, they might have spent some time on them.The original opening credits are shown at the beginning of each disk but NOT at the beginning of each episode.  When you choose an episode, it begins with the first scene.  The ending credits are complete.  And each episode runs about 23 minutes.  This means we are getting the syndicated versions of the episodes.  Chunks of dialog are missing.  And it's not even cleverly done as it was with ""I Love Lucy.""  Many times there is a fade out and fade in the MIDDLE of a scene.  You can tell a fade to commercial because these are usually accompanied by a musical tag.Disgraceful that this pioneering series - sort of a bridge between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" - has been given such a short shrift.It is wonderful to have it.  I am glad it has been released.  But if the subsequent seasons are going to be released - let's let Questar know that we won't accept such a cheat!If you are a fan of the show - buy this set.  It will be fun to watch.

I was delighted to hear they were releasing some of the episodes of ""Make Room for Daddy"" and the 57-58 season is a representive sample of the series. The DVD is packaged very well and for the full season plus the episode introducing Andy Griffith,the set is priced very reasonably.Danny Thomas has always been one of my favorites and the cast of the show worked very well with him. Compared to other family sitcoms of the era ""Leave it to Beaver:.""Donna Reed"" and ""Father Knows Best"". the Danny Williams character was real and much more in tune with the way families act. The relationship with Danny and his son Rusty was great..sentimental and gruff at the same time. Of course for all the ""realism"" in the show,itwas always a kick when Danny would start to sing while playing the piano and miraculously, a full orchestra would emerge!After watching a few of these episodes I remembered how warm and funny they were and its good to have them on DVD""Make room for Danny"" in your DVD collection.It's a nice addition.",5,A forgotten classic,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,1094,"['show', 'ran', '11', 'years', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'television', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'delighted', 'hear', 'were', 'releasing', 'episodes', 'Make', 'Room', 'Daddy', '57-58', 'season', 'representive', 'sample', 'series', 'DVD', 'packaged', 'very', 'well', 'full', 'season', 'episode', 'introducing', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'set', 'priced', 'very', 'reasonably.Danny', 'Thomas', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'cast', 'show', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'Compared', 'other', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'era', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'character', 'was', 'real', 'much', 'more', 'tune', 'way', 'families', 'act', 'relationship', 'Danny', 'son', 'Rusty', 'was', 'great..sentimental', 'gruff', 'same', 'time', 'course', 'realism', 'show', 'itwas', 'always', 'kick', 'when', 'Danny', 'would', 'start', 'sing', 'playing', 'piano', 'miraculously', 'full', 'orchestra', 'would', 'emerge', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'remembered', 'how', 'warm', 'funny', 'were', 'good', 'have', 'DVD', 'Make', 'room', 'Danny', 'DVD', 'collection.It', 'nice', 'addition']",Make Room For Daddy - The Complete Fifth Season
