1256106,A28QU1UG32PYNV,B0028S7IB6,"Katie A. E. ""Words-at-war""","[1, 1]","I think what people are at odds with are two opposing elements of the final cut of the film. The script, which is attempting to showcase a hypothesis, as to the possible emotional components (innocence, the foolish frivolity of emotions, the fantasy of being in love, the eventual heartache and the classic wish fulfillment of a dream come true) that pepper all of Austen's characters' love stories, versus the portrayal that we get from the actress Olivia Williams, whose interpretation is uniquely hers and not necessarily, or always, in synch to the script though her acting is incredible to watch. She IS the movie, and completely believable as Jane.The Jane in this movie, is a successful writer and while constantly and overtly verbal, witty and intelligent, appears to be a facade for her own personal yearnings and disappointments--of wanting exactly what she pens for her characters and yet, unconsciously dissatisfied by everything, and yet, somehow hopeful too. Like in her books, Jane is painfully aware of all the social structures and rules of good society, especially as she helps her favorite niece, Fanny, pick and choose the man of her dreams. Theirs is a world where marrying, and marrying well, is a business, and in its ruthless lack of intimacy or chance of happiness, compels Jane to seek out something more, possibly something greater, but what that 'something' is, be it love itself or not, will elude her all her life. Only in her writings does she reveal her true wants, but I think this film moves beyond the idea of love and being in love, but focuses on Jane's forward thinking and the constant attack of her independence and individuality, her exploration and questioning of the status quo, of the meaning behind love and marriage, for herself more than society as a whole. She cannot be herself without being speculated, pitied and ridiculed for it, but also, her passion for writing and telling stories is both her greatest triumph and the source of her greatest sadness. We see this through the eyes of Jane's niece, Fanny (Imogen Poots), young and whimsically romantic, and Jane's sister, Cassandra (Greta Scacchi), wise and supportive. Writing, in this film, is and was her one and only true love. And sadly, Jane seems to know this, that the hidden desire within may never be found or touched, no matter how much she wishes for it. The Jane in this movie is outwardly indifferent but oh so clever and rational but inwardly somber, striving to not be bitter and jaded, but attempts, daily, to accept her lot in life, though at times, even she cannot withstand it. Ultimately, Miss Jane Austen's regret is left to our decision, for there are many possible regrets but all stemming from an indomitable spirit and will.The cast, production, music, it's all there and done with a luxurious and rich look and feel. The script is intelligent and incredibly thoughtful, though beautifully melancholy. The acting by the full cast is, without a doubt, worthy of any other BBC Austen renditions. I'm not sure why some are so offended by the portrayal of Jane as drinking 'too much', when I have no doubt that was as prevalent then as it is now, even for smart, proper women like Jane, nor was it that noticeable in the film. Also, Jane's seeking to make profit on her books, when having money, especially as a single woman and supporting her family, is so heavily featured in all of her books, as well as the reality for the real life Jane Austen's time isn't exactly far-fetched or outlandish. Also, I think it's meant to be shown as a way for Jane to distance herself from her personal disappointments rather then be weakened by them. Nor do I understand the accusation that Jane is presented as being too modern even for her time, which I think she was. Her books reflect that--that's where the humor and comic self-inflection from her main heroes arise from. In the end, this is strictly someone's telling of a possibility, and I think a rather provocative one. Is it accurate? Who knows. Was it fascinating to watch? Yes. This film gives us a haunting, raw and emotional depiction of a Jane Austen we can admire and respect, and see a human side of a legend, however borrowed or imagined everything else may be...",4,Interesting interpretation of the love(s) lost and never regained of Miss Jane Austen,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,4244,"['think', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'odds', 'are', 'two', 'opposing', 'elements', 'final', 'cut', 'film', 'script', 'attempting', 'showcase', 'hypothesis', 'possible', 'emotional', 'components', 'innocence', 'foolish', 'frivolity', 'emotions', 'fantasy', 'being', 'love', 'eventual', 'heartache', 'classic', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Austen', 'characters', 'love', 'stories', 'portrayal', 'get', 'actress', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'interpretation', 'uniquely', 'hers', 'not', 'necessarily', 'always', 'synch', 'script', 'acting', 'incredible', 'watch', 'movie', 'completely', 'believable', 'Jane.The', 'Jane', 'movie', 'successful', 'writer', 'constantly', 'overtly', 'verbal', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'be', 'facade', 'own', 'personal', 'yearnings', 'disappointments', 'wanting', 'exactly', 'what', 'characters', 'yet', 'unconsciously', 'dissatisfied', 'everything', 'yet', 'somehow', 'hopeful', 'too', 'books', 'Jane', 'painfully', 'aware', 'social', 'structures', 'rules', 'good', 'society', 'especially', 'favorite', 'niece', 'Fanny', 'pick', 'choose', 'man', 'dreams', 'Theirs', 'world', 'where', 'marrying', 'marrying', 'well', 'business', 'ruthless', 'lack', 'intimacy', 'chance', 'happiness', 'compels', 'Jane', 'seek', 'out', 'something', 'more', 'possibly', 'something', 'greater', 'what', ""'something"", 'be', 'love', 'not', 'will', 'elude', 'life', 'Only', 'writings', 'reveal', 'true', 'think', 'film', 'idea', 'love', 'being', 'love', 'Jane', 'forward', 'thinking', 'constant', 'attack', 'independence', 'individuality', 'exploration', 'questioning', 'status', 'quo', 'meaning', 'love', 'marriage', 'more', 'society', 'whole', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'being', 'speculated', 'pitied', 'ridiculed', 'also', 'passion', 'writing', 'telling', 'stories', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'source', 'greatest', 'sadness', 'see', 'eyes', 'Jane', 'niece', 'Fanny', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'young', 'whimsically', 'romantic', 'Jane', 'sister', 'Cassandra', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'wise', 'supportive', 'Writing', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'true', 'love', 'sadly', 'Jane', 'know', 'hidden', 'desire', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'found', 'touched', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'Jane', 'movie', 'outwardly', 'indifferent', 'so', 'clever', 'rational', 'inwardly', 'somber', 'striving', 'not', 'be', 'bitter', 'jaded', 'attempts', 'daily', 'accept', 'lot', 'life', 'though', 'times', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'withstand', 'Ultimately', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'regret', 'left', 'decision', 'are', 'many', 'possible', 'regrets', 'stemming', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'will.The', 'cast', 'production', 'music', 'there', 'done', 'luxurious', 'rich', 'look', 'feel', 'script', 'intelligent', 'incredibly', 'thoughtful', 'beautifully', 'melancholy', 'acting', 'full', 'cast', 'doubt', 'worthy', 'other', 'BBC', 'Austen', 'renditions', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'offended', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'drinking', ""'too"", 'much', 'when', 'have', 'doubt', 'was', 'prevalent', 'then', 'now', 'even', 'smart', 'proper', 'women', 'Jane', 'was', 'noticeable', 'film', 'Also', 'Jane', 'seeking', 'make', 'profit', 'books', 'when', 'having', 'money', 'especially', 'single', 'woman', 'supporting', 'family', 'so', 'heavily', 'featured', 'books', 'as', 'well', 'reality', 'real', 'life', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'time', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'far-fetched', 'outlandish', 'Also', 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'shown', 'way', 'Jane', 'distance', 'personal', 'disappointments', 'rather', 'then', 'be', 'weakened', 'do', 'understand', 'accusation', 'Jane', 'presented', 'being', 'too', 'modern', 'even', 'time', 'think', 'was', 'books', 'reflect', 'where', 'humor', 'comic', 'self-inflection', 'main', 'heroes', 'arise', 'end', 'strictly', 'someone', 'telling', 'possibility', 'think', 'rather', 'provocative', 'one', 'accurate', 'Who', 'Was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Yes', 'film', 'haunting', 'raw', 'emotional', 'depiction', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'can', 'admire', 'respect', 'see', 'human', 'side', 'legend', 'however', 'borrowed', 'imagined', 'everything', 'else', 'may', 'be']",Miss Austen Regrets: The Life and Loves of Jane Austen
1256107,A3M1BBUC0L3RQ,B0028S7IB6,Laughsalot,"[4, 4]","The information in this movie is based on Jane Austen's journals, letters to family and friends, as well as family recounts of her life.  It is so stated at the beginning of the movie.  What some are seeing as ""money grabbing"" is a complete misinterpretation on their part and/or completely taking that part of her life out of context.  She was by no means a money grabber, she was a very talented, intelligent woman who wished to be paid for her work as a man would have been paid for his writing.  She was merely fighting for her rights as a woman, way ahead of her time.  She was also trying to help out her family with her writings.  No doubt she would have been able to had she been paid what she was worth, which is another reason she was fighting for her rights to be paid as well as a man would have been paid.  She was also not interested in marrying for money.  That was more of her mother's dream than Jane's. One of Jane's love interests was a man who stood to inherit a huge fortune and they were authentically in love with each other.  Jane had accepted his proposal, as she would have not accepted the proposal of anyone she had not truly loved.  She was not a gold digger.  (I think people need to ponder on the times she lived in and the great obstacles women had to deal with in order to survive in those days.)  She did not marry at all because she was afraid that marrying would mean the end of her writing as husbands had a great deal more power over their wives than they do nowadays.  Her sister, Cassandra whispered those fears in her ear and Jane turned him down.  If she were a gold digger, she would have gone through with the marriage anyway.  This is a beautifully sad movie that helped bring more insight to a great writer and one of my heroes.",5,Beautifully Sad....,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,1774,"['information', 'movie', 'based', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'journals', 'letters', 'family', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'recounts', 'life', 'so', 'stated', 'beginning', 'movie', 'What', 'are', 'seeing', 'money', 'grabbing', 'complete', 'misinterpretation', 'part', 'completely', 'taking', 'part', 'life', 'context', 'was', 'means', 'money', 'grabber', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'wished', 'be', 'paid', 'work', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'writing', 'was', 'merely', 'fighting', 'rights', 'woman', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'trying', 'help', 'out', 'family', 'writings', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'had', 'been', 'paid', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'reason', 'was', 'fighting', 'rights', 'be', 'paid', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'interested', 'marrying', 'money', 'was', 'more', 'mother', 'dream', 'Jane', 'One', 'Jane', 'love', 'interests', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'stood', 'inherit', 'huge', 'fortune', 'were', 'authentically', 'love', 'other', 'Jane', 'had', 'accepted', 'proposal', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'accepted', 'proposal', 'anyone', 'had', 'not', 'truly', 'loved', 'was', 'not', 'gold', 'digger', 'think', 'people', 'need', 'ponder', 'times', 'lived', 'great', 'obstacles', 'women', 'had', 'deal', 'order', 'survive', 'days', 'did', 'not', 'marry', 'was', 'afraid', 'marrying', 'would', 'mean', 'end', 'writing', 'husbands', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'power', 'wives', 'do', 'nowadays', 'sister', 'Cassandra', 'whispered', 'fears', 'ear', 'Jane', 'turned', 'down', 'were', 'gold', 'digger', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'marriage', 'anyway', 'beautifully', 'sad', 'movie', 'helped', 'bring', 'more', 'insight', 'great', 'writer', 'one', 'heroes']",Miss Austen Regrets: The Life and Loves of Jane Austen
1256108,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B0028S7IB6,One More Option,"[26, 26]","Most people might assume ""Miss Austen Regrets"" will be a story about ""Jane Austen and the one great love of her life she regretted letting slip away.""If you've seen ""Becoming Jane,"" another fictional story speculating on some of the intense personal relationships that may have contributed to the creation of Jane Austen's artistry and intellect, you may remember that in that film, a main theme was ""the one that got away"" (because James McAvoy's character and Austen did not marry because they did not believe they would have enough money).But in ""Miss Austen Regrets,"" the screenplay writer speculates that Jane Austen may have been far more complex than simply an old-fashioned girl who spent her spinster years pining for the men she declined in her youth.The casting for this film is spectacular.  Olivia Williams, Gretta Scacchi, Pip Torrens, and Hugh Bonneville are all compelling and moving.  They play each role as smart and fully concerned characters, with the worries of their era:  money, reputation, and duty.Austen is portrayed as brilliantly witty and imposingly intelligent.  Her dialogues are full of double entendres as she flirts consistently, understatedly, yet overtly with every man who attempts to engage her in conversation.  The men who try to match wits with her are easily matched or exceeded.The script is solid.  Other critics have complained the script portrays Austen as a wine-loving, flirtatious and ""modern"" woman that she was not.  I didn't watch the film with an intent to find ""the truth.""  I evaluated the story as a story.  And as a story, the premise that Austen was feisty, independent minded, and focused on her work and supporting her family is easily plausible.  And given the bravery and cleverness of her novels' characters, it's safe to assume that Austen may have been as clever as they come in social situations.The film's editing pacing is swift, especially early on.  The editors appear to have purposefully rushed the scenes early in the film.  Later, as the story becomes more somber and considered, the film's editing adaptively slows.From the script:On why Austen never chose a husband, Austen jests:""I never found one worth giving up flirting for.""After Austen is unfairly chastised at a party by a former suitor, the suitor asks for her pardon.  She replies:""You are forgiven everything except your failure to ask me to dance.""When considering the financial responsibilites she has chosen to take on in order to be the primary provider for herself, her unmarried sister, and mother, she reflects:""I'm to be my own husband it seems . . . and theirs.""When facing terminal illness in her early forties, she muses:""Sickness is a dangerous indulgence at my time of life.""How many of these quotes come from her actual letters or novels?  I do not know.  But the quotes and ideas color a beautiful mind and personality.I highly recommend watching this film.  It's funny, lively, spirited, and practically insightful.Intellectually and morally, Austen was generations ahead of her era.  Her practical common sense saw through the limitations and hypocrisies of her era's social systems.  Why she never married is a fascinating question that has aroused the curiosity of every generation of her readers since.What kind of man could have been worthy of Jane Austen?  That list of men had to have been very, very short.  So short, that Austen may have had to have created and crafted fictional men to fill that void.  Sometimes, when we cannot find what we seek, we create it in our imagination - to fill the void of something we feel and believe should exist.Austen keenly understood not only what was ""missing"" from her life, but also what was missing from her social culture.  She had the force of character and intellect to shine a light on important, central, and emotional things that were absent in her generation - the unrealized wants and the unspoken hopes of millions of women (and men).  And every generation of her readers since has marvelled at Austen's ability to sympathize with us - to show us what we have wanted and what we have lacked.",5,The Complexities Of A Woman Ahead Of Her Time,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,4102,"['Most', 'people', 'might', 'assume', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', 'will', 'be', 'story', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'one', 'great', 'love', 'life', 'regretted', 'letting', 'slip', 'away', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'fictional', 'story', 'speculating', 'intense', 'personal', 'relationships', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'creation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'artistry', 'intellect', 'may', 'remember', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'was', 'one', 'got', 'away', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'character', 'Austen', 'did', 'not', 'marry', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'enough', 'money', '.But', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'simply', 'old-fashioned', 'girl', 'who', 'spent', 'spinster', 'years', 'pining', 'men', 'declined', 'youth.The', 'casting', 'film', 'spectacular', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Gretta', 'Scacchi', 'Pip', 'Torrens', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'compelling', 'moving', 'play', 'role', 'smart', 'fully', 'concerned', 'characters', 'worries', 'era', 'money', 'reputation', 'duty.Austen', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'witty', 'imposingly', 'intelligent', 'dialogues', 'are', 'full', 'double', 'entendres', 'consistently', 'understatedly', 'yet', 'overtly', 'man', 'who', 'engage', 'conversation', 'men', 'who', 'try', 'match', 'wits', 'are', 'easily', 'matched', 'exceeded.The', 'script', 'solid', 'Other', 'critics', 'have', 'complained', 'script', 'Austen', 'wine-loving', 'flirtatious', 'modern', 'woman', 'was', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'intent', 'find', 'truth', 'evaluated', 'story', 'story', 'story', 'premise', 'Austen', 'was', 'feisty', 'independent', 'minded', 'focused', 'work', 'supporting', 'family', 'easily', 'plausible', 'given', 'bravery', 'cleverness', 'novels', 'characters', 'safe', 'assume', 'Austen', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'clever', 'come', 'social', 'situations.The', 'film', 'editing', 'pacing', 'swift', 'especially', 'early', 'editors', 'appear', 'have', 'purposefully', 'rushed', 'scenes', 'early', 'film', 'Later', 'story', 'more', 'somber', 'considered', 'film', 'editing', 'adaptively', 'script', 'why', 'Austen', 'never', 'chose', 'husband', 'Austen', 'never', 'found', 'one', 'worth', 'giving', 'up', 'flirting', 'Austen', 'unfairly', 'chastised', 'party', 'former', 'suitor', 'suitor', 'pardon', 'are', 'forgiven', 'everything', 'failure', 'ask', 'dance', 'When', 'considering', 'financial', 'chosen', 'take', 'order', 'be', 'primary', 'provider', 'herself', 'unmarried', 'sister', 'mother', ""'m"", 'be', 'own', 'husband', 'When', 'facing', 'terminal', 'illness', 'early', 'forties', 'Sickness', 'dangerous', 'indulgence', 'time', 'life', 'How', 'many', 'quotes', 'come', 'actual', 'letters', 'novels', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'quotes', 'ideas', 'color', 'beautiful', 'mind', 'personality.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'funny', 'lively', 'spirited', 'practically', 'insightful.Intellectually', 'morally', 'Austen', 'was', 'generations', 'ahead', 'era', 'practical', 'common', 'sense', 'saw', 'limitations', 'hypocrisies', 'era', 'social', 'systems', 'Why', 'never', 'married', 'fascinating', 'question', 'aroused', 'curiosity', 'generation', 'readers', 'since.What', 'kind', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worthy', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'list', 'men', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'short', 'So', 'short', 'Austen', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'have', 'created', 'crafted', 'fictional', 'men', 'fill', 'void', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'what', 'seek', 'create', 'imagination', 'fill', 'void', 'something', 'feel', 'believe', 'should', 'exist.Austen', 'keenly', 'understood', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'life', 'also', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'social', 'culture', 'had', 'force', 'character', 'intellect', 'shine', 'light', 'important', 'central', 'emotional', 'things', 'were', 'absent', 'generation', 'unrealized', 'unspoken', 'hopes', 'millions', 'women', 'men', 'generation', 'readers', 'marvelled', 'Austen', 'ability', 'sympathize', 'show', 'what', 'have', 'wanted', 'what', 'have', 'lacked']",Miss Austen Regrets: The Life and Loves of Jane Austen
