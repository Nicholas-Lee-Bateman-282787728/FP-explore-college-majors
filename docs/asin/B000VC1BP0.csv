I imagine it took a very long time to put together. The script is great, very funny, my only complaint is there is too much talking, there should be more action. Imagine 2 hours of talking. My ADD can't take that.As funny as it is, I fall asleep after 30 minutes, but it is a fun thing to watch.

The major factor of this show that makes it so attractive is the witty dialogue. Obviously with this being nothing more than a bunch of guys manipulating characters in inventive ways in a video game, there must be some attraction and the voice acting and plot are the things. Beware, this show is not for those with virgin ears, there is a good amount of adult humor and vulgar language so you have been warned. Otherwise, good viewing, the full series is worth having.",5,Hard to go wrong,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,570,"['Red', 'vs', 'Blue', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'internet', 'productions', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'major', 'factor', 'show', 'so', 'attractive', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'Obviously', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'bunch', 'guys', 'manipulating', 'characters', 'inventive', 'ways', 'video', 'game', 'must', 'be', 'attraction', 'voice', 'acting', 'plot', 'are', 'things', 'Beware', 'show', 'not', 'virgin', 'ears', 'good', 'amount', 'adult', 'humor', 'vulgar', 'language', 'so', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'Otherwise', 'good', 'viewing', 'full', 'series', 'worth', 'having']",N/A

This season was a great way to tie up some ends for the first part of the saga. As always, funny, charismatic, and awesome. Caboose is still the best, hands down!

1100646,AH5TZDGHTFTBG,B000VC1BP0,J. Straker,"[5, 5]","In the concluding season of Red v/s Blue, Rooster Teeth has stayed true to its original characters and added some new characters that are outrageous enough to establish themselves in just a few short scenes.  There is no doubt that these new characters will give the writers plenty of ammunition for future projects.  Season Five has everything; love (or lust in Tucker's case), hate, mystery, intrigue, triumphant acts of courage, heartbreaking death of both human and AI.  Of course there will be sweet laughter at someone else's expense.The ending left me a little cold.  At first I didn't believe it did the characters or the previous season's justice; but after listening to the commentary on the DVD, I believe the ending chosen was the best choice.  Thankfully, this is the ending of the series and not the ending of all the characters we've grown to love in Red v/s Blue.Caboose rules!",4,Red v/s Blue Season 5,1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,893,"['concluding', 'season', 'Red', 'v/s', 'Blue', 'Rooster', 'Teeth', 'stayed', 'true', 'original', 'characters', 'added', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'outrageous', 'enough', 'establish', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'doubt', 'new', 'characters', 'will', 'give', 'writers', 'plenty', 'ammunition', 'future', 'projects', 'Season', 'Five', 'everything', 'lust', 'Tucker', 'case', 'hate', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'triumphant', 'acts', 'courage', 'heartbreaking', 'death', 'human', 'AI', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'sweet', 'laughter', 'someone', 'else', 'expense.The', 'ending', 'left', 'little', 'cold', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', 'characters', 'previous', 'season', 'justice', 'listening', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'believe', 'ending', 'chosen', 'was', 'best', 'choice', 'Thankfully', 'ending', 'series', 'not', 'ending', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'love', 'Red', 'v/s', 'Blue.Caboose', 'rules']",N/A

The writers did however manage to include an adequate amount of &#34;bathroom&#34; humor.  Just because a picture is anime doesnt mean it has to be written on the level of four year olds (even though I doubt they would sit through this).
