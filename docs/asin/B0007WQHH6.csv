Fasinating subject and I was intrigued with the setup: Over the hill Porno directer gets back in the buis. even though morally he has quams. I'll make this short, first twenty minutes pretty cool. Including a hard core sex scene that i found quite hot. But after that it goes to this french; anarchy, Political, extistential, (feel free to put another word here that i can't spell), deal. Maybe they should have put that scene at the end so that we had to pay for our dinner.  If you buy it get for cheap.

892977,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0007WQHH6,C. B Collins Jr.,"[32, 35]","This film is certainly a mixed product. Some strenghts but more weaknesses.A fifty year old pornograhic director comes out of retirement after many years of idleness supported by his architect wife. He tries to make a film but the younger directors and producers overpower his vision and produce a typical porno product. Jacques, the director, tries to make the film naturalistic with restrained dialogue, no fingernail polish, and restrained whimpers during sex rather than overacted screams of pleasure. He is quickly over-ruled and he quits the project.This man has lost much and will lose more during the film. His first wife committed suicide, leaving him with a little boy. The boy discovers his father is a pornographer and leaves home. When his son returns, they have little to say. Eventually Jacques leaves his devoted wife and alienates his best friend and isolates in a single room writing and editing his random thoughts.One redeeming aspect of the film however was a description by Jacques of his early career and work. He saw pornography as a political and social act in which he and his friends and girlfriends engaged. Thus pornography had a rebellious political and artistic overtone that became washed out through commercialization. This sentence helps explain why Jacques was considered to be a great film maker, even 30 years after he was in retirement. His films were alive because they were created with the political and social spirit of the times in which they were produced. They were works of art as well as pornography. Now Jacques does not have that same rebellious spirit. We are reminded of the nature of youthful, unrealistic, energetic, eutopian, rebellious, protest in the film when Jacques' son and his friends have the ultimate rebellion against society by becoming mute.One thing to remember, this film actually contains a pornographic scene that is as explicit as any porno movie.",2,A little long and boring which seems ironic considering,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,1918,"['film', 'certainly', 'mixed', 'product', 'strenghts', 'more', 'weaknesses.A', 'fifty', 'year', 'old', 'pornograhic', 'director', 'retirement', 'many', 'years', 'idleness', 'supported', 'architect', 'wife', 'make', 'film', 'younger', 'directors', 'producers', 'overpower', 'vision', 'produce', 'typical', 'porno', 'product', 'Jacques', 'director', 'make', 'film', 'naturalistic', 'restrained', 'dialogue', 'fingernail', 'polish', 'restrained', 'whimpers', 'sex', 'rather', 'overacted', 'screams', 'pleasure', 'quickly', 'over-ruled', 'project.This', 'man', 'lost', 'much', 'will', 'lose', 'more', 'film', 'first', 'wife', 'committed', 'suicide', 'leaving', 'little', 'boy', 'boy', 'father', 'pornographer', 'home', 'When', 'son', 'returns', 'have', 'little', 'say', 'Eventually', 'Jacques', 'devoted', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'isolates', 'single', 'room', 'writing', 'editing', 'random', 'thoughts.One', 'redeeming', 'aspect', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'description', 'Jacques', 'early', 'career', 'work', 'saw', 'pornography', 'political', 'social', 'act', 'friends', 'girlfriends', 'engaged', 'Thus', 'pornography', 'had', 'rebellious', 'political', 'artistic', 'overtone', 'became', 'washed', 'out', 'commercialization', 'sentence', 'explain', 'why', 'Jacques', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'maker', 'even', '30', 'years', 'was', 'retirement', 'films', 'were', 'alive', 'were', 'created', 'political', 'social', 'spirit', 'times', 'were', 'produced', 'were', 'works', 'art', 'as', 'well', 'pornography', 'Now', 'Jacques', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'rebellious', 'spirit', 'are', 'reminded', 'nature', 'youthful', 'unrealistic', 'energetic', 'eutopian', 'rebellious', 'protest', 'film', 'when', 'Jacques', 'son', 'friends', 'have', 'ultimate', 'rebellion', 'society', 'becoming', 'mute.One', 'thing', 'remember', 'film', 'actually', 'pornographic', 'scene', 'as', 'explicit', 'porno', 'movie']",The Pornographer

I saw the preview for this movie on the DVD of Teorema. I wanted to see it for two reasons; the movie looked pretty, um, cool and the only movie I'd seen with Jean-Pierre Leaudis The 400 Blows, a movie he did when he was 14. Now in his late-fifties/early-sixties Leaud is still a fine actor who hits all the right notes in his performance as an aging pornographer. Leaud plays Jacques, a pornographer that had a slew of hits in the seventies but has retired. He now has a wife and an adult son (Jeremie Renier, ""L'Enfant"") he rarely speaks too, but decides to return to making movies. Problem is, porn has changed since Jacques was making it and he's not able to make it the way he wants it too. As his world falls apart around him, Jacques begins to reexamine himself and, in the process, begins to lose his mind. The movie is actually a really good character study, although it sometimes takes itself to seriously. One part almost made me laugh, when Jacques is giving an interview to a journalist and is talking about a scene in which (I'm paraphrasing) ""The scene where she came, brought tears to my eyes."" The movie has probably got more attention for it's graphic sex scene than anything else. This scene (which occurs about 30 minutes into the movie) is graphic...But it's not. You see more of the guy than you do of the girl, in fact you really don't see anything of the girl. It is, technically, graphic...But ""The Brown Bunny"" had more nudity. A lot of the reviewers on here say the movie is dull. I didn't find it dull; I actually found it pretty interesting and thought provoking. It's no masterpiece, it's not in a league with masterpieces, it's not even the best look at the world of pornography, but it's definitely an underrated film.GRADE: B-",4,Not That Bad,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1869,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'Amazon', 'com', 'movie', 'Two', 'Star', 'Average', 'Customer', 'Review', 'Come', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Teorema', 'wanted', 'see', 'two', 'reasons', 'movie', 'looked', 'pretty', 'um', 'cool', 'only', 'movie', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Leaudis', '400', 'Blows', 'movie', 'did', 'when', 'was', '14', 'Now', 'late-fifties/early-sixties', 'Leaud', 'still', 'fine', 'actor', 'who', 'right', 'notes', 'performance', 'aging', 'pornographer', 'Leaud', 'Jacques', 'pornographer', 'had', 'slew', 'hits', 'seventies', 'retired', 'now', 'wife', 'adult', 'son', 'Jeremie', 'Renier', ""L'Enfant"", 'rarely', 'too', 'return', 'making', 'movies', 'Problem', 'porn', 'changed', 'Jacques', 'was', 'making', 'not', 'able', 'make', 'way', 'too', 'world', 'apart', 'Jacques', 'reexamine', 'process', 'lose', 'mind', 'movie', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'seriously', 'One', 'part', 'almost', 'made', 'laugh', 'when', 'Jacques', 'giving', 'interview', 'journalist', 'talking', 'scene', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'scene', 'where', 'came', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'movie', 'probably', 'got', 'more', 'attention', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'anything', 'else', 'scene', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'graphic', 'not', 'see', 'more', 'guy', 'do', 'girl', 'fact', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'girl', 'technically', 'graphic', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'had', 'more', 'nudity', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'say', 'movie', 'dull', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'dull', 'actually', 'found', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'league', 'masterpieces', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'look', 'world', 'pornography', 'definitely', 'underrated', 'film.GRADE', 'B-']",The Pornographer
