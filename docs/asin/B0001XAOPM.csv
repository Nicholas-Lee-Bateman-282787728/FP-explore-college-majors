816122,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B0001XAOPM,A Customer,"[8, 12]","I've been a fan of M*A*S*H for many years. But that wasn't the end of Robert Altman's career. I believe it was the beginning. He's done a whole lot of stuff since then. So how the heck did I miss it? I dunno.I suspect that, like with Stanley Kubrick and Werner Herzog and maybe a few other directors, some studio someplace just told Altman ""do whatever the heck you want and we'll worry about that other stuff (like money) later."" And, for whatever reason, I didn't see a single Altman film until now.Who were the actors and who were not? Everybody seemed so natural that it doesn't matter. You watch a movie and, best case scenario, you tend to focus on a single person or two who seems so natural that they don't appear to be acting. In this film, everybody's like that. I praise the actors who don't appear to act, and I praise the ones who weren't professional actors, and I praise the director (Altman) who found all these people and made it happen.I have no idea who wrote the dialogue for this film, but he or she also has my sincere admiration. It's as real as it gets.When you think of me, I assume two non-profane words pop into your head. China, and redneck. I've left China. Meanwhile, if I tell you that I watched a movie about ballet, I am still a redneck.Rednecks are not conformists. If that makes me the only person to ever live in Pender County North Carolina AND watch a movie about ballet, so be it. If it means I'm talking about Eminem or Shakespeare or even ballet, then that's what it means. Y'all listen up.What's this movie about? Quite simply, ballet. The dancers spend years learning to do physical feats that are impossible to the rest of us. Art directors put these moves together because they want to communicate something. Some in the audience understand this nonverbal message. This audience member probably does not. But the dancing can be beautiful, okay? And in this film, it is. The choreography and music are superb, because Altman wanted to show us this medium at its best.The film also pokes a little fun at those visionary art directors, because it's hard not to, and I laughed out loud a few times. Malcolm McDowell is every bit as credible and entertaining as those ""actors"" in the film who genuinely choreograph ballet for a living, so I'm impressed.Consider this. I've spent a whole lot of lungpower trying to communicate my love of NFL football to folks who just don't get it. It's very complex, and I'd even say beautiful. (Except for guys who weigh at least 100 pounds more than The Fridge. You have a salary cap, so why not a fatty cap?) You have a group of very different guys, you find out what they excel at, and you build a successful system that plays to their strengths in order to reach a common goal that may or may not involve a whole lot of bloodshed. To me, a blinding flash of the obvious. Meanwhile, some folks will never get it or never want to get it. This film made me look at ballet that way. Not my game, but I get it. Is that not a cool experience for a viewer to have? I think it is. Now gimme the damn ball!I want to address something that Robert Altman did not, because I think you expect it of me. Are ballet guys gay? Ballet is about grace and beauty, and maybe you gotta wonder about guys who want to achieve that instead of eating a few more pizzas for breakfast. Well, I watched a film about ballet, and I find it more accessible than break dancing, but that does not mean I'm going to prance around in tights myself. (I just offended TWO minorities with that wisecrack.)I'd like to think that we have better things to think about than homophobia. And while my aesthetic sense is rather poor, I think that a guy who has one and is aware of it is allowed to say he's ""getting redneck"" about it. And I'd also like to mention that ballet guys lift their female partners off the ground for great lengths of time, and perhaps you're jealous even though I'm not because I happen to be an old hog farmer and Jan weighs far less than any hogs I've known and loved. And just for the hell of it I'll throw in that this film has one love story between a ballet guy and a ballet girl so just grow up already.(It also had some gay guys. So what? I love how they talk.)Have you noticed how far I've drifted from the film itself? That's deliberate. An author who limits you to what he's writing about is actually a bit pathetic. Altman knows that, even when he doesn't know that. As in, I know damn well he never expected someone reviewing this film to talk about hogs or Eminem. Word! That's part of what makes this film so extremely cool.What's this film really about? What all literature, in any medium, should be about. Here are some folks, doing what they do, and maybe what they do is way outside your own experience. So why not spend a bit of time in this other world, which is a quite real world, and enjoy the experience or perhaps even learn from the experience? With the best literature, enjoying and learning are the same.",4,The Company,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,4994,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'M*A*S*H', 'many', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'end', 'Robert',

816123,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0001XAOPM,Alex Udvary,"[11, 12]","When I first found myself getting seriously involved in movies for some reason or another I took Robert Altman for granted. I knew him strictly as the film-maker of ""M*A*S*H"" and didn't care to see anything he made. Then about 2 or 3 years ago I started watching his movies. I have always heard people say wonderful things about him and I thought it was about time I check out his films. He immediately became one of my favorite American directors. And his work since the 90's, sort of his ""comback"" years have greatly impressed me. ""Shorts Cuts"" I think is his masterpiece, he then followed that films with ""Kansas City"", ""The Gingerbread Man"", ""Cookie's Fortune"" and his previous film ""Gosford Park"", which made us all think of Jean Renoir's ""Rules of the Game"". All of this makes it seem somewhat odd then that he would follow the critical successful ""Gosford Park"", which he was nominated for an Oscar, with a movie about ballet, but, I guess that just goes to show you what kind of versital talent Altman really is.As I walked into ""The Company"" I thought I would enjoy it because Altman was directing, but I didn't know I'd come out enjoying it as much as I do. With this film Altman fully displays his talents for detail, every one of his movies has a spontaneous feel to it. Sometimes we think we are seeing things we shouldn't be. As if it's the rehearsal, his movies have a very breezy attitude. ""The Company"" and I know how shocking it may seem, is actually one of his best films. There are moments when watching this movie I had to remind myself it's a movie and not a documentary. Altman's style of filmmaking is perfect for this movie. He captures moments that seem so real. We honestly forget we are watching actors.A lot of people it seems have been staying away from this movie. It has been doing very poorly at the box-office, sadly a good number of Altman's films were not commercially successful. But I'm afraid those who do go see it may not like it because they will say it has no story. It's just about dancing. Well, first of all lets remember the name of the movie, ""The Company"", secondly no one has been hiding the fact this movie is about ballet, so yes, a great deal of the movie is featuring dance scenes. There is a very light plot. And if I were to judge the movie on plot than I guess it would be disappointing, but you can't watch this movie and expect a heavy plot. In fact the plot is so fragile I wouldn't know how to describe it.We have a young woman named Ry (Neve Campbell, who also produced the movie and help with its story) who is a young talented dancer awaiting the day she can be the star of her own company. She starts a relationship with Josh (James Franco) after a bad breakup with her ex, who just happens to be a dancer who works for the same company. Then there is Mr. A (Malcolm McDowell) who is head of the company. He is having fincial trouble putting on a new show called the ""Blue Snake"". And there isn't much more to tell.Altman was robbed of an Oscar a few years back with ""Gosford Park"", but, someone could argue, at least they nominated him. Well, sadly Altman's great work here will go unnoticed, and it's not fair. ""The Company"" is one of the better films released in 2003.There is one scene I want to point out to people. There is scene were Ry and her partner or dancing, but a storm breaks out. In this moment are minds are already going to work because we think the rain will go on the stage and she'll slip and injure herself. Altman is creating such tension that movies like ""Phone Booth"" and ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" didn't make me feel. Now, I'm not going to tell you if she does injure herself or not, you'll just hae to go see the movie.Bottom-line: One of Robert Altman's best films. His directing style makes a perfect blend for the film's tone. Has a spontaneous feel to it that makes us forget it's only a movie.",4,"Robert Altman Makes Charming ""Company""",1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,3885,"['When', 'first', 'found', 'getting', 'seriously', 'involved', 'movies', 'reason', 'took', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'granted', 'knew', 'strictly', 'film-maker', 'M*A*S*H', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'anything', 'made', 'Then', '2', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'started', 'watching', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'wonderful', 'things', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'films', 'immediately', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'American', 'directors', 'work', '90', 'sort', 'comback', 'years', 'have', 'greatly', 'impressed', 'Shorts', 'Cuts', 'think', 'masterpiece', 'then', 'followed', 'films', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Gingerbread', 'Man', 'Cookie', 'Fortune', 'previous', 'film', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'made', 'think', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'Rules', 'Game', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'then', 'would', 'follow', 'critical', 'successful', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'ballet', 'guess', 'just', 'show', 'kind', 'versital', 'talent', 'Altman', 'really', 'walked', 'Company', 'thought', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Altman', 'was', 'directing', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'come', 'out', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'Altman', 'fully', 'talents', 'detail', 'one', 'movies', 'spontaneous', 'feel', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'are', 'seeing', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'rehearsal', 'movies', 'have', 'very', 'breezy', 'attitude', 'Company', 'know', 'how', 'shocking', 'may', 'seem', 'actually', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'remind', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'Altman', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'perfect', 'movie', 'moments', 'seem', 'so', 'real', 'honestly', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'actors.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'staying', 'away', 'movie', 'been', 'doing', 'very', 'poorly', 'box-office', 'sadly', 'good', 'number', 'Altman', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'commercially', 'successful', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'who', 'do', 'go', 'see', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'will', 'say', 'story', 'just', 'dancing', 'Well', 'first', 'lets', 'remember', 'name', 'movie', 'Company', 'secondly', 'one', 'been', 'hiding', 'fact', 'movie', 'ballet', 'so', 'yes', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'featuring', 'dance', 'scenes', 'very', 'light', 'plot', 'were', 'judge', 'movie', 'plot', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'disappointing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'expect', 'heavy', 'plot', 'fact', 'plot', 'so', 'fragile', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'describe', 'it.We', 'have', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Ry', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'movie', 'help', 'story', 'who', 'young', 'talented', 'dancer', 'awaiting', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'star', 'own', 'company', 'relationship', 'Josh', 'James', 'Franco', 'bad', 'breakup', 'ex', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'dancer', 'who', 'same', 'company', 'Then', 'Mr.', 'A', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'head', 'company', 'having', 'fincial', 'trouble', 'putting', 'new', 'show', 'called', 'Blue', 'Snake', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'tell.Altman', 'was', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'someone', 'could', 'argue', 'least', 'nominated', 'Well', 'sadly', 'Altman', 'great', 'work', 'here', 'will', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'not', 'fair', 'Company', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'released', '2003.There', 'one', 'scene', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'people', 'scene', 'were', 'Ry', 'partner', 'dancing', 'storm', 'out', 'moment', 'are', 'minds', 'are', 'already', 'going', 'work', 'think', 'rain', 'will', 'go', 'stage', ""'ll"", 'slip', 'injure', 'Altman', 'creating', 'such', 'tension', 'movies', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'injure', 'not', ""'ll"", 'just', 'hae', 'go', 'see', 'movie.Bottom-line', 'One', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'best', 'films', 'directing', 'style', 'perfect', 'blend', 'film', 'tone', 'spontaneous', 'feel', 'forget', 'only', 'movie']",The Company
816124,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B0001XAOPM,Amy Henley,"[5, 5]","I knew when I ordered this movie that it might be a long shot in terms of me enjoying it.  However, it at least seemed like it would be interesting, and according to that criteria, it met my expectations.  I think that the viewer's expectations are going to be the key criteria in deciding whether or not to rent this movie and will greatly impact his or her enjoyment of it.  If the viewer just wants to watch some modern dancing, then I think they will be satisfied.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the dancing both in terms of choreography and the execution of it. Even Neve Campbell, who use to be a ballet dancer by the way, did a good job. If the viewer is expecting a scripted story with lots of dialogue about the trials and tribulations of being a dancer with a few dance scenes thrown in for good meaure, then the viewer will probably be disappointed. This is not the typical dance movie that has come out in the last few years. For some viewers what might detract from their enjoyment is the plot, or what some reviewers say is a lack thereof. Also, the sound is bad during the dialogue. However, I think that Altman's goal was not to do the standard plot where there is lots of dialogue talking about being a dancer, but not much footage really showing it.  I think it was his goal to show the viewer, not tell the viewer, what it means to be a dancer. The movie is presented in a stream of consciousness type format. Although he may have presented more information visually than directors of other dance movies, it seems to me that because dancing is mostly a visual media, this may be a good way to go. In the movie we may see just a little slice of time, but I think I gained a better understanding, both from the perspective as an outsider and from a more intimate view thanks to what was shown to me, than I have watching any of the other movies about dancers that I have seen recently. Another reason some people may not like the movie is that at the end everything was not wrapped up in a nice bow. I may not know when the movie started or when it finished, or what will happen next, but I know I had a good time on the journey.",3,Enjoyment of this movie depends on your expectations.,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,2141,"['knew', 'when', 'ordered', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'long', 'shot', 'terms', 'enjoying', 'However', 'least', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'according', 'criteria', 'met', 'expectations', 'think', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'key', 'criteria', 'deciding', 'not', 'rent', 'movie', 'will', 'greatly', 'impact', 'enjoyment', 'viewer', 'just', 'watch', 'modern', 'dancing', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'dancing', 'terms', 'choreography', 'execution', 'Even', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'who', 'use', 'be', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'way', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'viewer', 'expecting', 'scripted', 'story', 'lots', 'dialogue', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'being', 'dancer', 'few', 'dance', 'scenes', 'thrown', 'good', 'meaure', 'then', 'viewer', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'typical', 'dance', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'viewers', 'what', 'might', 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'plot', 'what', 'reviewers', 'say', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Also', 'sound', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'However', 'think', 'Altman', 'goal', 'was', 'not', 'do', 'standard', 'plot', 'where', 'lots', 'dialogue', 'talking', 'being', 'dancer', 'not', 'much', 'footage', 'really', 'showing', 'think', 'was', 'goal', 'show', 'viewer', 'not', 'tell', 'viewer', 'what', 'be', 'dancer', 'movie', 'presented', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'type', 'format', 'may', 'have', 'presented', 'more', 'information', 'visually', 'directors', 'other', 'dance', 'movies', 'dancing', 'mostly', 'visual', 'media', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'go', 'movie', 'may', 'see', 'just', 'little', 'slice', 'time', 'think', 'gained', 'better', 'understanding', 'perspective', 'outsider', 'more', 'intimate', 'view', 'thanks', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'have', 'watching', 'other', 'movies', 'dancers', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'reason', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'end', 'everything', 'was', 'not', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nice', 'bow', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'movie', 'started', 'when', 'finished', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'know', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'journey']",The Company
816125,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0001XAOPM,Andy Orrock,"[3, 4]","You go into 'The Company' knowing that it's a Robert Altman film - so you expect all things Altman: more slice-o-life than contrived plot; lots of simultaneous events (and speaking) going on; inventive camera work.  Altman excels at getting into the inner workings of things.  In 'The Company,' if you like ballet - or even if you wonder in general how large creative performances fall into place - this movie will be of great interest to you.Not to say it's a great movie.  Malcolm McDowell is the only one here really given a chance to act, and he's excellent.  His dominant personality makes him the beacon of the film.  All action seems drawn to him.By contrast, Neve Campbell had her hands full with producing and dancing (she's a very good dancer).  Although she is the nominal 'star' of the film, she doesn't have more than a handful of understated lines throughout.  Just to give you an idea what this film is like:  James Franco - tipped by some as this generation's James Dean - is cast as Neve's one-night-stand-turned-boyfriend.  The guy's a serious dramatic actor and beyond making eggs and preparing some other dishes (he is cast as a chef), I can't recall him uttering a single full line of dialogue.All in all though, this is a good movie - not up there with Altman classics like 'The Player' (geting even better with time), but certainly several levels up from Altman stinkeroos like the Richard Gere/Farrah Fawcett fiasco 'Dr. T and The Women.'",3,Not 'The Player' - but not 'Dr. T & The Women' either,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",2004,1462,"['go', ""'The"", 'Company', 'knowing', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'film', 'so', 'expect', 'things', 'Altman', 'more', 'slice-o-life', 'contrived', 'plot', 'lots', 'simultaneous', 'events', 'speaking', 'going', 'inventive', 'camera', 'work', 'Altman', 'getting', 'inner', 'workings', 'things', ""'The"", 'Company', 'like', 'ballet', 'even', 'wonder', 'general', 'how', 'large', 'creative', 'performances', 'fall', 'place', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'interest', 'you.Not', 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'only', 'one', 'here', 'really', 'given', 'chance', 'act', 'excellent', 'dominant', 'personality', 'beacon', 'film', 'action', 'drawn', 'him.By', 'contrast', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'had', 'hands', 'full', 'producing', 'dancing', 'very', 'good', 'dancer', 'nominal', ""'star"", 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'handful', 'understated', 'lines', 'Just', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'James', 'Franco', 'tipped', 'generation', 'James', 'Dean', 'cast', 'Neve', 'one-night-stand-turned-boyfriend', 'guy', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'making', 'eggs', 'preparing', 'other', 'dishes', 'cast', 'chef', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'uttering', 'single', 'full', 'line', 'dialogue.All', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'there', 'Altman', 'classics', ""'The"", 'Player', 'geting', 'even', 'better', 'time', 'certainly', 'several', 'levels', 'Altman', 'stinkeroos', 'Richard', 'Gere/Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'fiasco', ""'Dr"", 'T', 'Women']",The Company
816126,A29OA882WGY2BE,B0001XAOPM,"Anne Terry ""chikwik""","[0, 3]","The opening sequence is stunning. I have never seen a better record of the effort required by dancers - some shots are so vivid, that your own body responds to the movement shown on screen. I can't however, say it's a &quot;good&quot; movie. Plot is nearly non-existant, and the movie feels very long and slow, and you spend most of the movie feeling disengaged. It does show the chaotic world of the professional dancer.

But it is not for everyone, and even the people it IS for may have to watch it two or three times to fully understand it.The most simple way I can put this is that generally speaking, movies and books tend to revolve around certain characters. In this movie, the characters take a back seat to the general happenings at a Dance Company. James Franco may be known as the likable and sympathetic eventual villain in ""Spiderman,"" but he hardly has anything to say in this film. He's just there to be Neve Campbell's boyfriend. Malcolm McDowell has a fair amount of screen time as the frantic, but good at his job company director. And to be fully honest, he makes the most of his screen time: ""Just so you know, you guys didn't help me one bit.""More than anything, the movie shows how the dancers suffer difficult lives for the sake of an hour here and there on stage. It also shows how a simple injury can throw hours, weeks, months of practice down the drain.Another character worth mentioning is the sympathetic Debby. She is a 43 year old woman who has dedicated her life to the dance, but as much as she loved it, she feels it isn't good for her to be a part of it now: ""It's not that I don't want to be in it, but at this point, it looks lime I'm working at it."" We also see through her that once somebody has learned a certain way, there comes a point where you just can't tell them to do it differently now.In a way, this is kind of like the ballet version of ""Saturday Night Fever."" (Though without the several things that made ""Saturday Night Fever"" an R rated movie.)

I'm not a fan of ballet, but even I was thrilled by the performances in this film and moved by the beauty of dance. What Altman has done here is use one art form to record the artistic process of another, and it's mostly successful on those terms.I have to admit that my attention did wander at times. I didn't want a contrived plot and was happy just watching artists at work, but even I was craving some dramatic conflict here and there. I have to think there's more drama in the behind-the-scenes world of professional dance (just as there is when any group of people come together in a community) than Altman finds here. But the visuals are superb, especially the cinematography. And, being from Chicago myself, it was fun to soak in the Windy City locations (I could have been an extra in the outdoor scene they filmed in Grant Park, but wasn't able to go to the shoot).There's really no need to mention the actors, since none of them really registers, with the exception of Malcolm McDowell, who breezes on and off the screen wearing a yellow scarf around his neck and barking tyrannical orders to have furniture moved out of his way.  No, the star of this show is the dance itself.

816130,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B0001XAOPM,Chip Kaufmann,"[3, 3]","That description fits just about every movie that Robert Altman made and is especially true in the case of THE COMPANY. It took the arrival of DVDs and the subtitle option before I finally began to appreciate and enjoy Altman as a director. Two of his signature trademarks are overlapping dialogue and organic development of his plots & characters rather than conventional storytelling. Altman said he deliberately did this because he wanted his audiences to pay more attention and focus in on what his characters were doing. Although probably unintended, it also boosted ticket sales as you had to see the movie more than once to figure out was going on. It had the opposite effect on me. All it did was to irritate and frustrate me so that I eventually lost interest and usually zoned out after about the first hour. Had I seen THE COMPANY back in 2003 when it first came out, I'm sure that would have been the result.Once Altman's movies arrived on DVD, I revisited them and began to run the subtitles which allowed me to catch all the dialogue and it made me realize that there really is a story there it's just disguised as everyday life. Most people want a standard plotline with a beginning, a middle, and an end and a few ups and downs along the way. Altman likes to eavesdrop on his characters and what is happening to them. Other reviewers have mentioned his ""fly on the wall"" approach which is very effective once you realize what he is doing and adjust your expectations accordingly. I was just unable to do that in a movie theater. In one sense Altman is like the American composer Charles Ives in that it takes repeated exposure to his works to get what he is driving at and most people (myself included) weren't willing or capable of doing that in a public venue. In the privacy of your home though, it's a different matter.The storyline focuses on several days in the lives of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago as they get ready for the world premiere of a difficult work. We meet several dancers (played by actual members of the company) eventually focusing on one (Neve Campbell who co-wrote and co-produced the film), her boyfriend (James Franco in an early role), and the prima donna head of the company (Malcolm MacDowell brilliantly cast against type). There are several breathtakingly executed and exquisitely photographed dance numbers along the way leading up to the big finale which showcases the Joffrey Ballet as a company and it is these numbers which make the film a must for any lover of modern dance. It's also an intimate portrait of the everyday goings on backstage and during rehearsals as well as a glimpse into the personal lives of the company members. THE COMPANY isn't for everyone, but if you really love dance and utilize the subtitle option (a must), it can be a rich and rewarding experience.",4,Well Done But Not For Everyone.,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,2832,"['description', 'just', 'about', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'made', 'especially', 'true', 'case', 'COMPANY', 'took', 'arrival', 'DVDs', 'subtitle', 'option', 'finally', 'began', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'Altman', 'director', 'Two', 'signature', 'trademarks', 'are', 'overlapping', 'dialogue', 'organic', 'development', 'plots', 'characters', 'rather', 'conventional', 'storytelling', 'Altman', 'said', 'deliberately', 'did', 'wanted', 'audiences', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'focus', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'doing', 'probably', 'unintended', 'also', 'boosted', 'ticket', 'sales', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'going', 'had', 'opposite', 'effect', 'did', 'was', 'irritate', 'frustrate', 'eventually', 'lost', 'interest', 'usually', 'zoned', 'out', 'first', 'hour', 'Had', 'seen', 'COMPANY', 'back', '2003', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'result.Once', 'Altman', 'movies', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'revisited', 'began', 'run', 'subtitles', 'allowed', 'catch', 'dialogue', 'made', 'realize', 'really', 'story', 'just', 'disguised', 'everyday', 'life', 'Most', 'people', 'want', 'standard', 'plotline', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'few', 'ups', 'downs', 'way', 'Altman', 'eavesdrop', 'characters', 'what', 'happening', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'fly', 'wall', 'approach', 'very', 'effective', 'realize', 'what', 'doing', 'adjust', 'expectations', 'accordingly', 'was', 'just', 'unable', 'do', 'movie', 'theater', 'one', 'sense', 'Altman', 'American', 'composer', 'Charles', 'repeated', 'exposure', 'works', 'get', 'what', 'driving', 'most', 'people', 'included', 'were', ""n't"", 'willing', 'capable', 'doing', 'public', 'venue', 'privacy', 'home', 'different', 'matter.The', 'storyline', 'several', 'days', 'lives', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'Chicago', 'get', 'ready', 'world', 'premiere', 'difficult', 'work', 'meet', 'several', 'dancers', 'played', 'actual', 'members', 'company', 'eventually', 'focusing', 'one', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'co-produced', 'film', 'boyfriend', 'James', 'Franco', 'early', 'role', 'prima', 'donna', 'head', 'company', 'Malcolm', 'MacDowell', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'type', 'are', 'several', 'breathtakingly', 'executed', 'exquisitely', 'photographed', 'dance', 'numbers', 'way', 'leading', 'up', 'big', 'finale', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'company', 'numbers', 'make', 'film', 'must', 'lover', 'modern', 'dance', 'also', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'everyday', 'goings', 'backstage', 'rehearsals', 'as', 'well', 'glimpse', 'personal', 'lives', 'company', 'members', 'COMPANY', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'really', 'love', 'dance', 'utilize', 'subtitle', 'option', 'must', 'can', 'be', 'rich', 'rewarding', 'experience']",The Company

I enjoyed the movie, but after watching it, I still don't know the answer to that question.The movie's sequence (you can't really call it a story) is primarily centered around a series of rehearsals and performances by Chicago's Joffrey Ballet company, in particular those of its star dancer, Ry (Neve Campbell - I'm guessing at the spelling of her character's name). The performances on and off stage are wonderful without exception, and the behind-the-scenes portions of the movie give us at least a taste of what's behind the beautiful dance steps and costumes.Unfortunately, though, that's really all we get - a taste. We never get to know any of the dancers in any depth or see more than a very superficial view of what their art means to them. There is ostensibly a side story involving Campbell's character and her past and future boyfriends, but neither the story nor any of the characters are sufficiently developed to make that portion of the movie very interesting.The delightfully stern and arrogant dance coach (Malcolm McDowell) is the only clearly developed character; the scenes involving him are amusing enough to be worth waiting for.

It is a way to communicate to the soul, and this art speaks to this very inner sanctimonium of the soul in more ways than one, as Antonio Antonelli (Malcolm McDowell), tries to reach his students through unorthodox methods, as well as ""force-feeding"" his energetic young charges to think outside the box. Getting his students to accept his stern and rudimentary ways of instruction is going to take an eternity, as this young troupe has a mind of their own.

816136,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0001XAOPM,Emily Todd,"[5, 5]","Robert Altman's eloquent, alluring ""The Company"" is the kind of artsy film that leaves mainstream audiences somewhat nonplussed.  Its nonexistent storyline is, in fact, one of its greatest strengths if you are simply willing to be open to a film that does not fit the constraints of traditional cinema.  Altman's documentary-style direction shows us the whimsical world of ballet, a world utterly inaccessible to the majority of the population, as an emotional, meticulous art that yields breathtaking results.  We never learn much about the characters (Neve Campbell, Malcolm McDowell, and dancers of the actual Joffery Ballet of Chicago), yet this works in the film's favor as we are compelled to keep watching in hopes of learning a bit more about each of these fascinating people and exactly what compels them to sacrifice so much for their art.Filmed with the complete cooperation of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago from a script based on a story cocreated by former dancer for the National Ballet of Canada, Neve Campbell (""Scream""), and Barbara Turner, the film's ""story"" is really just a backdrop to the stunning dance numbers and rehearsals, as well as snippets of the dancer's lives, shot in a documentary-esque style.  Therefore, it never falls prey to dance clich&eacute;s or melodramatic moments as it has the good sense not to get in the way of the astonishing look the viewer has into what it takes to be such a dancer.  I cannot say the same for such films as ""Center Stage"", which was a painfully earnest and ultimately ridiculous attempt to show us the ""real world"" of dancers.As stated by Altman upon completion of this masterpiece, ""The Company"" is a heartfelt Valentine to the dancers who dedicate their lives to ballet as well as to the elegant art itself.",5,"""...thinking about the motion isn't being the motion...""",1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1776,"['Robert', 'Altman', 'eloquent', 'alluring', 'Company', 'kind', 'artsy', 'film', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'somewhat', 'nonplussed', 'nonexistent', 'storyline', 'fact', 'one', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'are', 'simply', 'willing', 'be', 'open', 'film', 'not', 'fit', 'constraints', 'traditional', 'cinema', 'Altman', 'documentary-style', 'direction', 'whimsical', 'world', 'ballet', 'world', 'utterly', 'inaccessible', 'majority', 'population', 'emotional', 'meticulous', 'art', 'breathtaking', 'results', 'never', 'learn', 'much', 'characters', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'dancers', 'actual', 'Joffery', 'Ballet', 'Chicago', 'yet', 'film', 'favor', 'are', 'compelled', 'keep', 'watching', 'hopes', 'learning', 'bit', 'more', 'fascinating', 'people', 'exactly', 'what', 'sacrifice', 'so', 'much', 'art.Filmed', 'complete', 'cooperation', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'Chicago', 'script', 'based', 'story', 'cocreated', 'former', 'dancer', 'National', 'Ballet', 'Canada', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Scream', 'Barbara', 'Turner', 'film', 'story', 'really', 'just', 'backdrop', 'stunning', 'dance', 'numbers', 'rehearsals', 'as', 'well', 'snippets', 'dancer', 'lives', 'shot', 'documentary-esque', 'style', 'Therefore', 'never', 'prey', 'dance', 'clich', 'eacute', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'good', 'sense', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'astonishing', 'look', 'viewer', 'what', 'be', 'such', 'dancer', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'such', 'films', 'Center', 'Stage', 'was', 'painfully', 'earnest', 'ultimately', 'ridiculous', 'attempt', 'show', 'real', 'world', 'dancers.As', 'stated', 'Altman', 'completion', 'masterpiece', 'Company', 'heartfelt', 'Valentine', 'dancers', 'who', 'dedicate', 'lives', 'ballet', 'as', 'well', 'elegant', 'art']",The Company

There are fragments of storylines and a behind the scenes, very private views of what makes a Ballet Company function, but that is about it. And that is enough.  Altman knows how to stay out of the way as a director: the film feels extemporaneous.  Briefly, THE COMPANY is the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago during a season.  The cast is dominated by the company members who act with casual lyricism, dance with extraordinary grace and technique, and share their moments of joy, pain, frustration, stage fright, and physical stamina with us as though we were a fly on the wall.  Neve Campbell is responsible for bringing this film to the screen, sharing the producing and writing responsibilities as well as re-entering her past training as a ballerina to dance all her own roles -cast as a company dancer rising to premiere danseuse roles when another dancer is injured.  Malcolm McDowell ties the film together as a version of director Gerald Arpino.  But the focus here is on preparation of the company by choreographers from initial discussion of concept to full dress performance of many ballets.  In the case of Lar Lubovitch, the choreography is exquisite: the pas de deux 'My Funny Valentine' danced by Campbell and partner Domingo Rubio is the best part of the film.  The expensive production of an absurdly bad ballet by Robert Desrosiers is at the other end of the spectrum.  The filming is gently beautiful, the dancing at the bar and on the stage is peerless, and the overall feeling of camaraderie and commitment that exists in the sheltered world of ballet is sensitively portrayed.  When it comes to simple observation of life, few do it better than Altman, and THE COMPANY is no exception.

Some, of course, are monuments; my personal favorite, and a top 10 ever, is Nashville.The Company hardly approaches Altman's heights, but it has many pleasures.  For anyone who loves ballet, the work of the dancers in the Joffrey Company of Chicago is spectacular and wonderfully filmed.  Malcolm McDowell as the company director is a benign and beloved tyrant.  Watch him take possession of his personal chair in each scene where it appears.  Watch him with his endless adjustments and caressings of the gold scarf he always wears. Personally, I found the concluding ballet -- Blue Snake -- ludicrous and, unlike Nashville and Gosford Park, the characters in the ensemble acting never take much flight as individuals.  Three scenes of differing length are Altman at his height, however.  First comes the outdoor stage pas a deux where Neve Campbell first steps from company toward prima.  She and her partner dance as a thunderstorm gathers and then begins to drench the audience, umbrellas open, the dancers continue, danger and sensuality commingle.  It is wonderful stuff and goes on for minutes and minutes.  Second, a dancer snaps a tendon as she lands after a jump and, in a quick but perfect scene, watches on crutches from the spotlit wings as her cover commands the role at the performance that night.  Finally, the Christmas roast the Company does of the McDowell character and the Blue Snake choreographer is five or so minutes where the trademark Altman ensemble direction really works.The Company is not perfect, probably not even great Altman, but that's still way better than 90 percent of your box office options.",4,"It's Altman, It's Worth It",1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,1731,"['Save', 'execrable', 'Dr', 'T', 'Women', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'picture', 'price', 'admission', 'course', 'are', 'monuments', 'personal', 'favorite', 'top', '10', 'ever', 'Nashville.The', 'Company', 'hardly', 'Altman', 'heights', 'many', 'pleasures', 'anyone', 'who', 'ballet', 'work', 'dancers', 'Joffrey', 'Company', 'Chicago', 'spectacular', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'company', 'director', 'benign', 'beloved', 'tyrant', 'Watch', 'take', 'possession', 'personal', 'chair', 'scene', 'where', 'Watch', 'endless', 'adjustments', 'caressings', 'gold', 'scarf', 'always', 'Personally', 'found', 'concluding', 'ballet', 'Blue', 'Snake', 'ludicrous', 'Nashville', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'characters', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'never', 'take', 'much', 'flight', 'individuals', 'Three', 'scenes', 'differing', 'length', 'are', 'Altman', 'height', 'however', 'First', 'outdoor', 'stage', 'pas', 'deux', 'where', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'first', 'company', 'prima', 'partner', 'dance', 'thunderstorm', 'gathers', 'then', 'drench', 'audience', 'umbrellas', 'open', 'dancers', 'continue', 'danger', 'sensuality', 'commingle', 'wonderful', 'stuff', 'minutes', 'minutes', 'Second', 'dancer', 'tendon', 'jump', 'quick', 'perfect', 'scene', 'watches', 'crutches', 'spotlit', 'wings', 'cover', 'role', 'performance', 'night', 'Finally', 'Christmas', 'roast', 'Company', 'McDowell', 'character', 'Blue', 'Snake', 'choreographer', 'five', 'so', 'minutes', 'where', 'trademark', 'Altman', 'ensemble', 'direction', 'really', 'works.The', 'Company', 'not', 'perfect', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'great', 'Altman', 'still', 'way', 'better', '90', 'percent', 'box', 'office', 'options']",The Company

Altman takes us onstage, and off-stage, for a look at the world of dance, dancers, choreographers, set and costume designers and a ballet director, Alberto Antonelli, played wonderfully well by Malcolm McDowell. Actress Neve Campbell, best known for her roles in horror flicks, was trained for years in classical ballet. She is absolutely beautiful, and an extraordinarily lithe, exciting dancer. (No more scary movies Neve!!). It is obvious that she has put a lot of herself into this film. Not only does she play a major role, but she co-wrote and co-produced the movie. She did all of her own dancing, and seems to fit right in with the professional dancers from the Joffrey Ballet Troupe of Chicago, which is featured here.The film is loosely structured and documentary-like. The viewer gets a fly on the wall look at a dancer's life as Altman takes us behind the scenes, up close and personal. We watch both the professional and personal - from the grueling physical toll of constant practice to brilliant performances. The dancers' effort to perfect their mastery of dance is totally honest, and this artistic honesty really makes the film as special as a live performance. There are some spectacular dance performances throughout, with splendid colors, electric energy, creative costumes, and wonderful footwork which showcase the Joffrey Ballet Company. There's an opening modern piece where dancers leap across the stage with streamers, that is just fabulous. In another sequence a ballerina dances on and around a swing. Altman's camera emphasizes her grace and elegance, and this is one of the movie's high points for me. Neve Cambell also dances a marvelous pas de deux onstage, during an outdoor concert performance, in the rain. The effects are incredible. The music is ""My Funny Valentine."" The last number, the piece de resistance, is more garish than grande, unfortunately. The costumes and choreography look as if they had been designed for Sesame Street. I still enjoyed it, however. Just wanted to be fair and balanced here.Ballet director Antonelli, (McDowell), is a temperamental tyrant who meddles in every aspect of the ballet. But he is also charismatic, funny, and acknowledged as the troupe's backbone. Neve Campbell plays Ry, a member of the ensemble who is increasingly given important roles, as her talent merits. Her love interest, (James Franco), is a hunk! The chemistry between them is dynamite! We are also shown the tempermental behavior, tantrums, stress and strife that go on backstage.There's no major story here, just enough to entice. The main attraction is fantastic dance.

816149,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0001XAOPM,Linda Linguvic,"[78, 79]","Directed by Robert Altman, this film is about a year in the life of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, which is the true star of the film.  It also stars Neve Campbell, who  wrote and produced it as well, and it was surely an act of love on her part.  Even though she was originally trained as a dancer, she still had to train for three months, seven hours a day before even beginning to train with the company, which took another few months before shooting began. She is a wonderful dancer and The Company brings this all out.This is not a film about one person though.  And it is not a film with lots of interlocking stories.  Basically, it is a film about the creative process itself, and how an idea gets turned into an elaborate work of art.  It's hard to get the feel of this onto the screen. But Mr. Altman is a master in making sure it all come together.It takes more than hard work to be a member of the company.  It takes talent, dedication and pain and there are a few shots of the dancers' feet that made my own corns and calluses seem like nothing.  Malcolm McDowell is cast as the artistic director and he is terrific.  He's eccentric and moody and wonderfully creative as he has an intuitive understanding of how a new ballet will all come together in performance.  Most of the dancing shows the new and experimental although there is no doubt that the company is classically trained.There are a few small stories, but all of them just add to understanding of the company as a whole.  For example, there is a romance between Neve Campbell and James Franco, cast as a young chef.  This story is basically used to underscore the demanding life of the ballerina, which forces her to also work as a waitress in order to support herself.  Then there is a poignant scene where a dancer snaps an Achilles tendon during rehearsal.  Everyone knows that this means she will never dance again.  But the show must go on.  During the Grande Finale performance itself, one of the dancers is injured and another dancer takes her place in such a way that the performance seems seamless.All the dancing bore the touch of Robert Desrosiers and Lar Lubovitich, two master choreographers who also had roles in the film. I must also give a standing ovation to the cinematographers who shot this film with multiple cameras and high definition video.  I know I love watching dancers on the stage.  But the kind of angles and close-ups that are possible in film transform the experience of watching dance into an almost participatory experience.There are good extras on the DVD, including interviews and some extended dance performances.  I just couldn't stop watching and absorbing all the backstage lore.This is a wonderful film and I give it one of my highest recommendations - especially for dance fans everywhere.",5,Dance fans everywhere will LOVE this.

816155,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001XAOPM,mirasreviews,"[7, 7]","In &quot;The Company&quot;, Robert Altman applies his pseudo-documentary directing style to The Joffrey Ballet of Chicago. In a style that reminds me very much of Altman's acclaimed 1975 film &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;The Company&quot; gives us an intimate view of a year in the life of The Joffrey Ballet. Screenwriter Barbara Turner spent a few years getting to know the Joffrey's dancers and recording their stories, which she then transformed into a screenplay for &quot;The Company&quot;. Actress Neve Campbell, who was a dancer with the National Ballet of Canada before going to Hollywood, co-produces, acts and dances in the film. &quot;The Company&quot; has an ensemble cast, with a subtle concentration on the life of Neve Campbell's character, Ry. Six days a week of training and rehearsals leaves Ry little time for a personal life, but she struggles to make time for her boyfriend (James Franco) and a second job at a Goth bar while she eats, sleeps, and breathes dance. Malcolm McDowell plays the company's artistic director, Alberto Antonelli, a role inspired by the Joffrey's real Artistic Director, Gerald Arpino. The dancers are all played, quite convincingly, by The Joffrey Ballet's dancers.I really enjoyed &quot;The Company&quot;, but you probably either have to really like Robert Altman's work or really like dance to like this film. To say the story arch is unpronounced  would be an understatement. The story is the dedication and talent of these dancers. Nothing unusual happens. We simply observe them. I gather that that's the point. The dancers' performances and commitment are extraordinary. Emotions are high; good and bad things happen; but that's ordinary in the life of a professional ballet dancer. &quot;The Company&quot; 's pace is thoroughly even, and its tone is subdued. I thought at first that watching this film was going to require patience, as so many of Altman's film's do. But I was quickly sucked in by the opportunity to see inside the ballet subculture, along with some incredible dancing.There is a lot of footage of The Joffrey Ballet's performances. All of them are modern, not classical. And we can see even more of the dancers in their movie roles, to which they take quite naturally. Neve Campbell trained for months and became a temporary member of The Joffrey to make this film. She appears in eight dances in the film, although you may not be able to pick her out in all of them. &quot;The Company&quot; is her tribute to the world of dance that she loves, and it turns out to be a perfect subject for Robert Altman's signature directing style. If Altman's signature style makes you groan, you may still like &quot;The Company&quot;, as it's broken up with fantastic performances by The Joffrey Ballet.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Robert Altman and Neve Campbell, a  making-of featurette, &quot;The Passion of Dance&quot; featurette, an &quot;Extended Dance Sequence&quot;, and the ability to play all of the dance sequences from the film. The audio commentary is really pretty interesting. I found myself listening to more of it than I had intended. Robert Altman and Neve Campbell discuss the film's genesis, its style, their experiences filming and interacting with The Joffrey. It includes a lot of information about the dancing in the film and more insight into the Joffrey and the world of ballet. The &quot;Making of Featurette&quot; is a 7-minute documentary that features interviews with Altman, Campbell, Malcolm McDowell, and James Franco. In &quot;The Passion of Dance&quot; (4 minutes), Neve Campbell talks about the demanding world of professional ballet and her desire to make a film about it. The &quot;Extended Dance Sequence&quot; is a 2-minute dance sequence that takes place in the film's dance studio. It's not very interesting. I recommend the audio commentary, even if you don't have time to listen to the whole thing.",4,Look Inside the World of World-Class Ballet.,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,3937,"['quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'pseudo-documentary', 'directing', 'style', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'Chicago', 'style', 'very', 'much', 'Altman', 'acclaimed', '1975', 'film', 'quot', 'Nashville', 'quot', 'quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'intimate', 'view', 'year', 'life', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'Screenwriter', 'Barbara', 'Turner', 'spent', 'few', 'years', 'getting', 'know', 'Joffrey', 'dancers', 'recording', 'stories', 'then', 'transformed', 'screenplay', 'quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'Actress', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'who', 'was', 'dancer', 'National', 'Ballet', 'Canada', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'co-produces', 'acts', 'dances', 'film', 'quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'subtle', 'concentration', 'life', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'character', 'Ry', 'Six', 'days', 'week', 'training', 'rehearsals', 'Ry', 'little', 'time', 'personal', 'life', 'make', 'time', 'boyfriend', 'James', 'Franco', 'second', 'job', 'Goth', 'bar', 'sleeps', 'breathes', 'dance', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'company', 'artistic', 'director', 'Alberto', 'Antonelli', 'role', 'inspired', 'Joffrey', 'real', 'Artistic', 'Director', 'Gerald', 'Arpino', 'dancers', 'are', 'played', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'dancers.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'probably', 'either', 'have', 'really', 'like', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'work', 'really', 'like', 'dance', 'like', 'film', 'say', 'story', 'arch', 'unpronounced', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'story', 'dedication', 'talent', 'dancers', 'Nothing', 'unusual', 'happens', 'simply', 'observe', 'gather', 'point', 'dancers', 'performances', 'commitment', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'Emotions', 'are', 'high', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'ordinary', 'life', 'professional', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'pace', 'thoroughly', 'even', 'tone', 'subdued', 'thought', 'first', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'require', 'patience', 'so', 'many', 'Altman', 'film', 'do', 'was', 'quickly', 'sucked', 'opportunity', 'see', 'ballet', 'subculture', 'incredible', 'dancing.There', 'lot', 'footage', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet', 'performances', 'are', 'modern', 'not', 'classical', 'can', 'see', 'even', 'more', 'dancers', 'movie', 'roles', 'take', 'quite', 'naturally', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'trained', 'months', 'became', 'temporary', 'member', 'Joffrey', 'make', 'film', 'eight', 'dances', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'out', 'quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'tribute', 'world', 'dance', 'out', 'be', 'perfect', 'subject', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'signature', 'directing', 'style', 'Altman', 'signature', 'style', 'groan', 'may', 'still', 'like', 'quot', 'Company', 'quot', 'broken', 'up', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Joffrey', 'Ballet.The', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'quot', 'Passion', 'Dance', 'quot', 'featurette', 'quot', 'Extended', 'Dance', 'Sequence', 'quot', 'ability', 'play', 'dance', 'sequences', 'film', 'audio', 'commentary', 'really', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'found', 'listening', 'more', 'had', 'intended', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'film', 'genesis', 'style', 'experiences', 'filming', 'interacting', 'Joffrey', 'lot', 'information', 'dancing', 'film', 'more', 'insight', 'Joffrey', 'world', 'ballet', 'quot', 'Making', 'Featurette', 'quot', '7-minute', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'Altman', 'Campbell', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'James', 'Franco', 'quot', 'Passion', 'Dance', 'quot', '4', 'minutes', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'talks', 'demanding', 'world', 'professional', 'ballet', 'desire', 'make', 'film', 'quot', 'Extended', 'Dance', 'Sequence', 'quot', '2-minute', 'dance', 'sequence', 'place', 'film', 'dance', 'studio', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'recommend', 'audio', 'commentary', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'listen', 'whole', 'thing']",The Company

It is an undisputably Altman-esque view of life in a successful ballet company, in this case the Joffrey Ballet Company.This means that events simply unfold in a matter of fact and realistic way, with characters stumbling over phrases and talking over each other in a way that gradually convinces you this is a peek into real life rather than a `movie'.  If ballet, in particular modern ballet, fascinates you, and you like Altman's style of direction, then this is the movie for you.Having said that, if ballet does NOT fascinate, you may well be left cold by a movie which has no story to tell, but rather purports to show real life instead.The performances are fantastic, as you would expect from Robert Altman.  Malcolm McDowell is a treat as the ballet director.. a role that Roger Ebert astutely observed is very like Altman himself, overseeing the creative process with one eye always on the budget, and those around him subject to his acerbic put downs, or throwaway praises. More than once he shouts out `You're a genius!' while simultaneously walking out of the room and already thinking about something or someone else.  During the ballet training, you can feel the dancers groan as he interrupts shouting out `What are you doing! You made it pretty! I HATE pretty!'.Neve Campbell was the driving force behind getting the movie made.  She trained in Canada as a ballet dancer, and put in 4 months of training to get in shape for this role.  It was she who persuaded Altman to make the movie, after his initial disinterest.  This makes it all the more remarkable how un star-like a vehicle this is for her.  Her character is just one character within the company and never overshadows the pace and style of the movie.What we get then, is snippets of real lives and loves of all the players of a ballet company, interspersed with occasionally lengthy scenes of the ballets themselves. The performances certainly are convincing, but the end result is an oddly dispassionate but intimate view into the world of ballet.This is not Altman at his best.

You don't have some special qualification to critique this film because of that.  And why are you so obsessed with dance movies in the first place?  ""I want to spread the joy and recruit with it."" To Sally Sue running a dance class in a backwoods town trying to get all her friends to watch it and join her in ""the quest for movement"", give it a freak'n rest already!  Lordy.

This is a separate animal from those other dance promotional films.  There have been other films that have attempted this, but got screwed over by their studio.  'Havana Nights' was originally very different than it turned out, for instance.  The whole 'Dirty Dancing' connection was a bastardization of the writer's concept.  See 'The Player' for Altman's thoughts on Hollywood for an understanding of why this film is not in that category.  'The Company' is an exploration of the behind-the-scenes reality of an art form from the perspectives of individuals who have made (or are trying to make) it their sole profession.  Altman's eye once again has an objective, slightly distant documentary-like style to it, but in a way I don't think could be captured with a real documentary crew standing around.  And yet in spite of this, it is quite an intimate character piece.  You get these moments of character and situational truth again and again throughout that are universal to people, to professionalism, to art, and yet also have a unique take from this particular field.

She becomes a favorite of the company director (Malcolm McDowell) and dances in a number of other roles. Along the way she falls in love with a handsome chef (James Franco).That's about as much story as there is, although there are a number of other plotlines involving the other dancers (all of whom play themselves) that are started and then dropped. What THE COMPANY is really about is what goes on behind the scenes in the dancers lives. Bad relationships, injuries, personality conflicts, issues with the director (McDowell preens brilliantly and provides all the film's humor) , etc. There are also ballets, presented both in performance and in rehearsal, and THE COMPANY is also a celebration of the art and athleticism of these dancers.Don't go see THE COMPANY expecting a happy ending, or any ending.

Two local video stores I frequent have only one copy each. I found it entertaining; it is designed to take you backstage and show you the practice, work, and experience that goes into a ballet production. It is somewhat impressionistic and indeed somewhat plotless, though Neve Campbell does have a boyfriend and a mother who appear onscreen. Mr.Antonelli with his everpresent yellow scarf is an effective though somewhat imperious manager who motivates the company by constantly criticizing what he calls phony or pretty ballet, occasionally going over the edge with some dancers.The problem is, as an audience member I find ballet above all extraordinarily graceful. But the director must motivate his troops, and the point he makes is probably valid. Antonelli at one point wins an award from the Italian-American Heritage Society. I found it enjoyable to be caught up in the everyday lives of the dancers including a Christmas party and the practice routines and finished stage products which are on display often in the film, including 'The Blue Snake' at the end.

Likewise, to get a  master such as McDowell, you have to have a very credible idea and a great deal of talent and passion. Neve has it all.While the film is a virtual documentary snapshot of a period in the Joffrey's life, it is very coherent and organic, and avoids the pitfalls of some of the more pretentious, non-linear Art movies. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. Not everybody is a Cocteau or a Warhol.I liked the fact that the story is relatively non-hierarchical, and that Neve wasn't up on a pedestal.

816171,A1O2TW2HC06HIK,B0001XAOPM,Tom Shi,"[5, 6]","At first glance this movie is a strange beast.  Not quite drama, not documentary, not even docudrama.  Maybe it can best be described as a series of slightly fictionalized vignettes that follows a few months in a real-world ballet company. Despite the lack of plot, high drama, character development, or other things we usually expect from movies, The Company never fails to be fascinating in its portrayal of the lives of the dancers and the inner-workings of their profession.The filmmaker's restrained approach gave the movie a sense of realness absent in conventional dramas, yet doesn't dilute it's power. After all, the events depicted really happened, and the dancers on screen are dancers in real life. The movie makes its points with small, finely-observed moments that says much.  For example, when a star dancer snap her Achilles Tendon, she was quickly replaced.  As she was carried off stage it seemed that's the last we will see of her since that injury effectively ends her career.  But later at a public performance we see her limping to the side of the stage to watch her replacement dancing in her role.The reasons for these people's tremendous dedication were never explicitly articulated in the movie.  Some find this as a lack of depth.  But I feel words are not necessary, nor adequate, to illustrate it.  Simply take a look at the power and the grace the dancers display on stage, one would understand their passion and sacrifice.As a bonus, the DVD has a worthwhile commentary track, in which Altman and Campell discuss the the actual Joffrey company and its dancers in relation to the movie.

816173,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001XAOPM,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 11]","I only knew Neve Campbell as the star of the 'Scream' trilogy, and not a little number of the moviegoing people might feel the same way.  I didn't know that she was a trained dancer in Canada until 15 years old, 8 years before she became famous with the international success of the Wes Craven horror.  So, it is only natural that she thinks of her own dream as the material for the film, for which she became a co-producer and even provided the story though the script was written by veteran writer and former actress (and mother of Jeniffer Jason Leigh), Barbara Turner ('Pollock' and many others).  And the original score is done by Van Dyke Parks.But why 'directed by' Robert Altman?  Not that I hate his films, but that's the crutial point when watching 'The Company' because in this movie, like most of his previous films like 'Short Cuts,' you only have a minimal storyline in it.  Though Neve Campbell as one of the company's dancer 'Ry' is top-billed, with the supports like James Franco as a trainee chef who falls in lovw with her, and Malcom Mcdowell as 'Mister A' who runs 'The Company,' the real star of the film is, as many reviewers have rightly said, wonderful artists of The Joffrey Ballet Dancers, or the ballet campany itself.So in the film you see many real professional dancers of that company, plus two real-life choreographers Lar Lubovitch and Robert Desrosiers.  With them the film has a semi-documentary touch whenever it shows the dancers on and off the stage (especially in the 'off' scenes).  You get a glimpse of the hard life of dancers whose ultimate joy is to dance on stage, not through the characters and the story, but through the bits of realistic descriptions of their rehearsals, injuries, and arguments.But here is my question -- so why not make a documentary of the Joffrey Dancers themselves?  That is more interesting, isn't it?  Many reviewers praise the dance scenes of the film, which I think, is surely magnificient, but I was curiously unimpressed.  I don't know for sure, because I am not a fan of ballet.  But I am sure that if these hard-working dancers can show such beautiful things on stage -- and yes, they do, I know -- so, why Neve Campbell?  Why not other trained professional dancers, who deserve fame on screen?Perhaps, the reason for my slightly unsatisfied feelings is this -- why Ms. Campbell as the star?  Sorry, fans, I liked her in 'Scream' no matter what she thought about the franchise, but I just could not see why she should be the 'star'?  And again, why Altman, whose films have been, you would agree, based on just one principle -- that of ensemble drama?  'The Company' certainly captures the psuedo-family atmosphere of the ballet dancers, and the director's slightly fly-on-the-wall look is always a tender and affectionate one, but with a different approach -- in this case, documentary, 'The Company' would have been much better, doing a great survice to these dancers.",3,But Why Ms. Campbell?
