1340048,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B003EYVXV4,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","While watching 'The Hunger Games' I immediately thought of two staple school short stories:  Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"".  Despite these familiar elements, the author and movie makers make everything else their own.  I like this kind of social science fiction movie because it takes a look at society at large and makes us wince at our worst tendencies (brutality as a spectacle), and contrasts it will a reality wake-up call brimming with common decency.In this near future setting wars and rebellions have ravaged North America, and a police force and other powers that be find that human sacrifice is their solution (not unlike the Mayans).  Although they don't elaborate--at least not in the movie--it seems our near-future world is making pagan sacrifices and providing Coliseum entertainment to a vain and voyeuristic cosmopolitan audience.Twenty-four youth participants (Tributes) are chosen by lottery (where the crowd shows grim resignation.  So much for ""What if they had a 'Hunger Games' and nobody played."") and from each district (12) to fight it out in the wilderness with some contrived elements added added to the mix (not unlike 'Survivor 3: Africa - The Complete Season'). While it would be a spoiler to give the details of their feats and challenges, they train in an opulent capitol city, complete with obstacle courses and combat situations.  Harrelson (a sponser and former survivor), Tucci (a slick TV host of the Games), Banks (a gaudy, hyperventilating elite), and Sutherland (perhaps CEO of the Games) play among the status quo, and Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are the young protagonists who add a foil element to contrast the hardened adults.  And, while some of the uglier characteristics are a bit overplayed by the mentioned adult actors, the subtlety is exchanged for a presentation that is sharp and astute enough for our full appreciation.Once they start going the contest is riveting with some character faults and attributes sorting out the contestants.If small extrapolations in science fiction books and movies can make us review and renew our world, then, by golly, I am all for it. This movie is worth seeing as more than food for thought, however, and the movie makers make their point in a way that both makes it easier for us to go along for the ride while we are rooting for their heroes.",4,A Contest and Contrast Between Brutality and Bravery,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,2375,"['watching', ""'The"", 'Hunger', 'Games', 'immediately', 'thought', 'two', 'staple', 'school', 'short', 'stories', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'Lottery', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'familiar', 'elements', 'author', 'movie', 'makers', 'make', 'everything', 'else', 'own', 'kind', 'social', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'look', 'society', 'large', 'wince', 'worst', 'tendencies', 'brutality', 'spectacle', 'will', 'reality', 'wake-up', 'call', 'brimming', 'common', 'decency.In', 'near', 'future', 'setting', 'wars', 'rebellions', 'have', 'ravaged', 'North', 'America', 'police', 'force', 'other', 'powers', 'be', 'find', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'solution', 'not', 'Mayans', 'do', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'least', 'not', 'movie', 'near-future', 'world', 'making', 'pagan', 'sacrifices', 'providing', 'Coliseum', 'entertainment', 'vain', 'voyeuristic', 'cosmopolitan', 'audience.Twenty-four', 'youth', 'participants', 'Tributes', 'are', 'chosen', 'lottery', 'where', 'crowd', 'grim', 'resignation', 'So', 'much', 'What', 'had', ""'Hunger"", 'Games', 'nobody', 'played', 'district', '12', 'fight', 'out', 'wilderness', 'contrived', 'elements', 'added', 'added', 'mix', 'not', '3', 'Africa', 'Complete', 'Season', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'give', 'details', 'feats', 'challenges', 'train', 'opulent', 'capitol', 'city', 'complete', 'obstacle', 'courses', 'combat', 'situations', 'Harrelson', 'sponser', 'former', 'survivor', 'Tucci', 'slick', 'TV', 'host', 'Games', 'Banks', 'gaudy', 'hyperventilating', 'elite', 'Sutherland', 'perhaps', 'CEO', 'Games', 'play', 'status', 'quo', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'are', 'young', 'protagonists', 'who', 'add', 'foil', 'element', 'contrast', 'hardened', 'adults', 'uglier', 'characteristics', 'are', 'bit', 'overplayed', 'mentioned', 'adult', 'actors', 'subtlety', 'exchanged', 'presentation', 'sharp', 'astute', 'enough', 'full', 'appreciation.Once', 'start', 'going', 'contest', 'riveting', 'character', 'faults', 'attributes', 'sorting', 'out', 'contestants.If', 'small', 'extrapolations', 'science', 'fiction', 'books', 'movies', 'can', 'make', 'review', 'renew', 'world', 'then', 'golly', 'am', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'food', 'thought', 'however', 'movie', 'makers', 'make', 'point', 'way', 'easier', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'are', 'rooting', 'heroes']",N/A

The mockingjay pin does have a different back story than the book, but it's not that big of a problem; the cornucopia was strange looking, but it was easier to see the struggle on top actually taking place; I do agree Haymitch should have been in it more, but Katniss's struggle in the arena wasn't fully shown and I can understand that it really wasn't necessary to show every little thing that happened.Overall I believe it was a faithful adaption from one of my favorite series. The use of no music was totally unexpected and it's truly genius because you still feel the tension, the heartache, and the love.

Many of my friends have recommended the books to me, but when you read a book and then watch the movie, it is often disappointing, so therefore, I decided to watch the movie first so as to not be biased.  I was seriously disappointed after all of the hype.  I did not enjoy this movie at all.  I understand that it is a dystopia, so it isn't supposed to have a happy ending, but I didn't feel that it was very well done.  I thought the premise was kind of sick.  You have a group of kids and young adults who are randomly selected to go to slaughter, and everyone acts like they are so lucky.  Then people watch as the kids brutally murder each other, and a bunch of other people sit in a control room playing god and screwing with them for fun. I also didn't really connect with the characters.  I didn't feel like the movie did a good job about making the audience care about them.  The whole relationship between Katniss and Peeta was just awkward, and you are left wondering what happened to the guy back home, who is watching as she develops feeling for this other guy.  I have been told that in the book she is only pretending to fall for him, but the movie doesn't give that feeling.  I also found myself feeling uneasy that the target audience is tweens and young adults, and I'm forced to wonder about people who let their kids watch something so violent, where kids killing kids for sport is portrayed in such a matter of fact kind of way.  I am told that in the books, it gives the feeling that it is wrong, but that didn't translate well to screen.  Over all, I found myself wishing for the movie to be over.

1340066,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B003EYVXV4,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","To me, The Hunger Games is another chapter in, I hope, a never-ending series of popular, big distribution 'freedom and rebellion' books and movies - think of Star Wars, Firefly/Serenity, Avatar. Such movies and books place a mirror in our face and force us to take a good look at what and who we are and where we seem to be going. We read the books, watch the movies, some of us play the video games and maybe we feel good about ourselves because for a few minutes or a few days or months we 'get it'. Then we return to our real life and hibernate until the next installment arrives. Better than nothing at all and I was happy to see that half of the audience in the theater was made of teenage girls and boys, clearly hungry to experience a story of selfless sacrifice, survival, love of freedom and... love.The movie is as faithful to the book as any 2.5 hours movie covering a book can possibly be. From the point of view of someone who read the book (twice) it didn't take long to find myself immersed in the audio-visual rendition because a lot of what I saw was not unlike what I visualized for myself while reading the bool. Sure, some characters - Cena's crew, the mayor and his daughter - had to be cut out of the story, a couple of characters - Prez. Snow, Seneca - were more emphasized in the movie and there's a little spill-in from the second book in the series but it was all done honestly and gracefully and it was done only because doing so makes it easier for viewers who didn't read the books.The acting and casting are as close to optimal as they can be. Sure, there are some casting distractions - Katniss should not be taller than Peeta and Donald Sutherland is maybe too heavy of a presence for what should have been a slimy and sinister President Snow but everything blends to near perfection eventually and if noticing many in the audience wiping off a tear or two is an indication of immersive story telling then Hunger Games as a movie is very good at telling the story.Hunger Games is one of the not too many mass-market, big budget movies that manage to keep the audience alert and watching for 2.5 hours and leaving the theater feeling good about what they saw and talking about it. And it does so without a lot of CGI, very few explosions. Everyone in my family enjoyed the movie and we are all looking forward to 'Catching Fire' (part 2) of the series and surprisingly, not a lot of graphic violence.

For an action movie built upon the survival instincts of a young and humble warrior, the majority of the film is spent watching people explain things to the heroine and the audience, almost all of which is totally unnecessary.  You don't really need to know about sponsors, apartments, blue hair or the repetitious ""Rules of the Game"" so to speak. It just ends up dragging what is essentially a 80-minute movie nearly an hour longer.  Despite all the talk of myth that inspired the original novel, we've seen it all before in what is unambiguously adapted from the Most Dangerous Game.Jennifer Lawrence has an honest face which owns every scene, but unfortunately Gary Ross gets it all wrong. Ross cuts to so many arbitrary setups, he seems lost on how to lens and frame this story and by consequence, who to connect with.  You end up not caring who lives or dies in what SHOULD be a story of life and death.  On the dramatic side, we spend more time hearing people jabber on about nonsense than see them act upon anything.  Characters in The Hunger Games seemingly talk AT Katniss, never TO her and it all funnels into unmemorable noise. The empty dialog is shuttled around by lots of unmotivated shaky cam and quick cutting nonsense that doesn't edit.  The movie just doesn't flow well and in the scenes where it finally does - always in action - it is short lived.  At the end of every scene, I was awaiting the commercials because it feels like a hastily produced FOX show for Friday night.I really just wanted to see the young and talented Jennifer Lawrence out in the wild tracking down Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Running Man.  But instead we are held hostage by Gary Ross's witless direction and a dry talky script.  This is a movie with a character but no story, a setup but no payoff. Lots of hunger and very little game.Do yourself a favor, you won't regret it.

1340075,A9VSDB7HJFMAO,B003EYVXV4,AJ Hayden,"[138, 203]","EDITED AUGUST 19, 2012I bought the DVD of ""The Hunger Games"" yesterday and watched it for the first time since seeing it in the theater. Looking back on my previous review, I realized I was a little too harsh on the movie. Watching it the second time around, I liked it a lot more than I originally did. However, it's still not without it's flaws. My overall rating for the film is now teetering at about 3.5. Not quite a perfect 4, but not a 3.**SPOILER ALERT**THE GOOD*The acting. This was one of the things I was able to appreciate more watching the movie the second time around. Jennifer Lawrence appears to have been born to play this role. She embodied the role of Katniss perfectly. Josh Hutcherson played a pretty good Peeta. He certainly looks the part, with a round, sweet face. I especially liked him at the beginning, the way he followed Haymitch around like a dog, trying to get tips. I have a few quibbles with him, but overall, really enjoyed his performance. Liam Hemsworth was okay, I guess. It's sort of hard to judge his acting, with what little we were given of Gale (I mean, he wasn't in the book much more, but still.) Most of his scenes were just making angsty faces when Katniss and Peeta kissed.Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) was also perfect. He was exactly how I envisioned Haymitch. I also loved Effie (Elizabeth Banks.) Banks played the airheaded Capitol native well. She had excellent comedic timing with her lines and had a bubbly, vacant personality that was perfect for Effie.(I realize I'm using the word ""perfect"" a lot.)All of the tributes were also well-cast. Rue (Amandla Stenberg) was absolutely adorable. Cato was scary. His movement throughout the film just seemed to say, ""Don't mess with this guy."" I liked his monologue at the end, which showed that he wasn't all bad and, like the other tributes, was scared and wanted to go home. Clove was terrifying. The actress who played her was younger than what I imagined Clove in the book to be, but her younger age made her more frightening, with how vicious she was with a knife.Donald Sutherland was different than the Snow I imagined, but that's not a bad thing. I liked that he looked a little more friendly. He looked more like Santa or someone's grandpa. The way he delivered his lines and his voice, though, said otherwise. He was wonderfully creepy.Moving on...*Costumes and makeup. The Capitol's costumes and makeup were insane and I loved it. It was wonderful. It really reflected how silly and airy the Capitol people are. Oh, and some of the hairstyles in this movie. I loved Katniss's hair during the ""girl-on-fire"" scene was beautiful. Also, Seneca Crane's beard? It made me sad that he died, knowing that I would never see that beautiful beard again. RIP, Seneca.*Glimpses outside the arena. I thought that was a nice touch, since in the book, we're limited to Katniss's perspective. It was interesting to see the Gamemakers add things to the Games. That scene from District 11 was also a nice addition to the movie. In the books, we only hear about a revolution starting via Haymitch telling Katniss and it seems sort of distant. In this, we got to see that the revolution was happening NOW.*Followed the book pretty well. The movie followed the book very well. Of course, not everything was perfect, but what book-to-movie adaptation is? Overall, I was impressed with how the book transferred to the screen.THE BAD*Cinna. Now, he wasn't exactly terrible. My expectations for Lenny Kravitz were kind of low. He surprised me and I'll admit, he didn't seem completely miscast. But something about him still felt kind of...off. I personally feel that Cinna could have been cast better, but like I said, Kravitz wasn't terrible.*The score. It didn't have that broad, epic sound I thought maybe it would have. When a movie is this big, you expect it to have a theme song that will be memorable (think ""Harry Potter"" or ""Lord of the Rings.) I feel that we didn't really get to hear enough of the score, since there were so many silent moments in the movie. What we did hear was, in my personal opinion, just seemed sort of generic, like music you hear in other action/adventure movies. It just didn't really strike me as anything special.THE UGLY*Long awkward silences. At certain points during the Games, the movie goes practically silent or the sound is muffled. Occasionally, it works, but overall, it's just very awkward.*Cinematography. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the cinematography is incredibly shaky. I will praise it for this: It helped with the gore. I think the shaky cinematography eliminated some of the violence. You could tell what was going on, but it didn't get as graphic as it could have. However, it became kind of annoying after a while. I understand what the filmmakers were going for, but I don't think it had the effect that they wanted. It just made some parts difficult to watch. I also wasn't a huge fan of the zoom-ins they did (like when they zoom in on Katniss's lips before she blows up the supplies.) While the cinematography helped tone down the violence, it ended up looking more like a little kid had taped it with a camera.*Games felt rushed. Not horribly so, but I think the movie could have had a little extra time. I think the fandom would have sat through twenty-thirty extra minutes. One part that really suffers, in my opinion, were Rue's scenes. Katniss wakes up, finds Rue, there's a short (and I mean, SHORT) bit showing them eating, then it launches into the blow-up-the-supplies scene where Rue is ultimately killed.*Cave scene. This kind of goes along with the ""games felt rushed"" problem. I feel like this scene needed a little extra time. It ends up being one of the bigger scenes in the book, with Katniss pretending she loves Peeta, Peeta thinking it's real, and Katniss realizing it might not all be an act. In the end, this scene was mainly just Peeta telling Katniss about his near-lifelong crush on her, along with some rather creepy dialogue. ""I watched you walk home from school every day. Every day."" Well, hello, Edward Cullen! It also made it seem like Katniss was really, truly in love with Peeta, as opposed to faking it, although I will say that towards the end, when they come home to District 12, she seems a little awkward with Peeta.Overall, this certainly wasn't a bad movie. It was a good adaptation of the book with some amazing acting. But it did have its flaws and it wasn't perfect. However, I think fans will enjoy the movie.",3,"The Hunger Games: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,6507,"['EDITED', 'AUGUST', '19', '2012I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Hunger',

The low point scenes like an assailant that has to talk to Katness before killing her (typical chance to be saved)and weak CGI beasts that would have killed the duo hurt the film and push it into kid land from an adult perspective.The elaborate look of the film reaches grand moments along with some top notch survival acts. I do see where the appeal lies for the youth and I also see as an adult a little too much tv series style angst. Keeping the target audience in mind, it's an entertaining film. Watching the extras I was informed that Suzzane Collins who authored the book supposedly based the storyline of the ultra rich against the ultra poor on the Bush era worldview. I would say the class warfare interjection concept could be easily applied to the current White House occupant as well.The extras were also geared surprisingly towards adult viewing which I enjoyed. Donald Sutherland excelled with another creepy authoritative role and Woody Harelson was better than he has been with a realistic mixed bag persona. Jennifer Lawrence held the film together with appropriate emotions that made you want her to exceed.Josh Hutcherson as the boyfriend with a crush was a ""seen it done before"" portrayal. A few sub characters needed to brush up on the acting chops as well. All said and done, The Hunger Games mostly succeeds, you can watch it with the kids and end up with a discussion on the perils of life.",3,Moments of splendour,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,1694,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'prompted', 'watch', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'hype', 'generated', 'mostly', 'daughter', 'read', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'high', 'low', 'moments', 'are', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'nail', 'biting', 'interest', 'top', 'many', 'adult', 'oriented', 'action', 'flick', 'low', 'point', 'scenes', 'assailant', 'talk', 'Katness', 'killing', 'typical', 'chance', 'be', 'saved', 'weak', 'CGI', 'beasts', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'duo', 'hurt', 'film', 'push', 'kid', 'land', 'adult', 'perspective.The', 'elaborate', 'look', 'film', 'grand', 'moments', 'top', 'notch', 'survival', 'do', 'see', 'where', 'appeal', 'youth', 'also', 'see', 'adult', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'tv', 'series', 'style', 'angst', 'Keeping', 'target', 'audience', 'mind', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Watching', 'extras', 'was', 'informed', 'Suzzane', 'Collins', 'who', 'authored', 'book', 'supposedly', 'based', 'storyline', 'ultra', 'rich', 'ultra', 'poor', 'Bush', 'era', 'worldview', 'would', 'say', 'class', 'warfare', 'interjection', 'concept', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'applied', 'current', 'White', 'House', 'occupant', 'well.The', 'extras', 'were', 'also', 'geared', 'surprisingly', 'towards', 'adult', 'viewing', 'enjoyed', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'excelled', 'creepy', 'authoritative', 'role', 'Woody', 'Harelson', 'was', 'better', 'been', 'realistic', 'mixed', 'bag', 'persona', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'held', 'film', 'together', 'appropriate', 'emotions', 'made', 'want', 'exceed.Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'boyfriend', 'crush', 'was', 'seen', 'done', 'portrayal', 'few', 'sub', 'characters', 'needed', 'brush', 'up', 'acting', 'chops', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'done', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'mostly', 'can', 'watch', 'kids', 'end', 'up', 'discussion', 'perils', 'life']",N/A

I don't understand how the hunger games do anything whatsoever to benefit the victor. Tribute in the form of forced labor or forfeited wealth I can understand. Tribute in the form of kids killing each other doesn't seem like smart resource management. Subjugating and oppressing the rebels is one thing. Pissing them off by making their kids kill each other seems like a certain recipe for further rebellion. Intimidate the districts by giving them a spark of hope because ""hope is stronger than fear""? Does that make even the slightest bit of sense?Even assuming the districts put up with this nonsense, what's with the lottery? Why wouldn't there always be a volunteer? Has the world changed so much that districts don't have goth kids who want to die or jocks who want to prove their manhood? If victory is the ticket out of a life of assured misery, I'd expected dozens of kids to volunteer for the games.With such a preposterous premise, why am I giving The Hunger Games four stars? Because, premise aside, it's a riveting movie. In the end, I was willing to forgive the premise because there's so much here to like.I loved the editing. The quick jumps from scene to scene give the film energy, even early in the movie when nothing much is happening. The camera's brief focus on held hands and grim faces tell the viewer more about the people of District 12 than an hour of dialog would manage, and in a more meaningful way. During action scenes, close-ups are used effectively to heighten tension. It's just a pleasure to watch, and get lost in, the action.I loved the performances. Jennifer Lawrence sold me. Woody Harrelson sold me. Josh Hutcherson convinced me that he's not just a pretty face.I loved Stanley Tucci's hair.I even liked the writing. It's subtle when it needs to be. It isn't cheesy.

Since I was travelling in Busniess class I believe I saw it in its entirety (2hrs 20 mins or so). A friend has been talking about this movie and the books for some time now and I decided to watch it and form my own opinion. The movie did hold my attetnion from beginning to end but there were so many ""holes"" in the plot that I could not help myself from noticing. One of the biggest issues in the movie is the disparity of the ages of the contestants! How could a 12 year old boy or girl ever go against an 18 year old one? The whole idea is beyond absurd and I am not one having issues with ""far off"" ideas. Still, during the whole movie I kept being reminded that sompething must be really wrong with the whole human race watching their kids getting slaughtered like animals. How long would a dictatorship like this last if they messed around with a society's chil;dren? And why children in the first place?Another part of the movie I had a serious issue with is the ""blood bath"" at the beginning of the HGs! Some kids almost acted like expert killers having no issue what-so-ever to gut another human being. Totally unbelievable because there is no precedence in the movie to indicate a society that was in such chaos.Anyway, i am undecided whether I liked this movie or not.

First of all, the plot steals largely from Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 masterpieceBattle Royale(based on the 1999 novel by Koushun Takami). Secondly, this film -- while recycling that plot -- merely adds in a bunch of weird costumes, a love triangle and several little side plots that take away from the main point of the film. Don't forget that this is a story about youngsters forced to kill each other. That should be the central focus of the story, which it is inBattle Royale: The Novel; however, in ""Games,"" the deaths (except for one that contributes to the emotional intensity of the story) quickly flash by on screen. I'm sure the movie team did this so they could get the PG-13 rating and rake in more kids to the box office. And while I'm sure parents and kids alike probably will appreciate this, I think it steals away from the seriousness of the situation. I have not read the book and can only hope that the lives in there are not simply a quick, few sentences. But, in the film, by flashing through the deaths, it's as if the filmmakers are saying that the lives of those lost is not really that important. Also, the budding romance between Katniss and Peeta is too distracting and takes up too much valuable screen time. It makes the audience forget what this film is ultimately about: kids being forced to kill one another! I know this is a trilogy so this is merely the beginning and the story is being set up, but it's a poor first act. Even the predictable outcome of the two leads is a bit forced and unrealistic. The only character with any credibility in the story is Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy. Now, if there were an entire novel/movie about his winning the games and what lead to him being the way he is in this story, THAT would be a film worth making!

I'd read the book late last year and have since then intended on seeing the film but had just never gotten around to it.  I'll say pretty much what I had said in my review of the book; if you have a problem with the nature of the material then don't watch the film.  I mean, it's not like the themes here or the general plot itself isn't wholly explained on the outset.  You aren't going to be surprised by the violence since it is widely known and publicly criticized.  If you watch the movie or read the book then you have no grounds to complain about the violence.You've been warned.That said, I totally get the criticisms or the media and our society in actually targeting our youth with this `entertainment'.  Kids killing kids isn't something I think children should be entertaining themselves with.I watched it though, so I can't say much.For me, the film doesn't quite hold up against the book, which delves deeper into the political aspects of the films themes.  It actually speaks to a more socially conscious narrative than one would assume.  Sadly, the film attempts to condense and provide the audience with a more streamlined `action film' and because of this it changes up key segments and creates a less arresting experience.  The technical aspects of the film are also a letdown since they distract from the action.  The fire in particular is embarrassingly bad.  Still, Lawrence is exceptionally good here.  She cycles Katniss's emotional range with expertise.  The cheeky gaudiness of it all is engaging, but some of the rougher edges of the film really distract.  The jeering of the kids is so fake feeling, and the underdeveloped plotting of the `villains' is just too much of a head-sore.  The book was much better than I imagined and the film was more underwhelming than I imagined.It's good, but that's about where it lies.",4,"Kiss kiss, bang bang...",1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,1920,"['took', 'long', 'enough', 'finally', 'caved', 'saw', 'Hunger', 'Games', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'have', 'then', 'intended', 'seeing', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'never', 'gotten', ""'ll"", 'say', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'had', 'said', 'review', 'book', 'have', 'problem', 'nature', 'material', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'mean', 'not', 'themes', 'here', 'general', 'plot', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'explained', 'outset', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'surprised', 'violence', 'widely', 'known', 'publicly', 'criticized', 'watch', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'have', 'grounds', 'complain', 'violence.You', ""'ve"", 'been', 'said', 'totally', 'get', 'criticisms', 'media', 'society', 'actually', 'targeting', 'youth', 'entertainment', 'Kids', 'killing', 'kids', ""n't"", 'something', 'think', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'entertaining', 'with.I', 'watched', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much.For', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'up', 'book', 'deeper', 'political', 'aspects', 'films', 'themes', 'actually', 'more', 'socially', 'conscious', 'narrative', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'Sadly', 'film', 'attempts', 'condense', 'provide', 'audience', 'more', 'streamlined', 'action', 'film', 'up', 'key', 'segments', 'less', 'arresting', 'experience', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'letdown', 'distract', 'action', 'fire', 'particular', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'Still', 'Lawrence', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'here', 'Katniss', 'emotional', 'range', 'expertise', 'cheeky', 'gaudiness', 'engaging', 'rougher', 'edges', 'film', 'really', 'distract', 'jeering', 'kids', 'so', 'fake', 'feeling', 'underdeveloped', 'plotting', 'villains', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'head-sore', 'book', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'imagined', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'underwhelming', 'imagined.It', 'good', 'where']",N/A

1340162,A1LC5RBUKYY7BC,B003EYVXV4,"Andy Marlinata ""dragonlee""","[1, 2]","This movie is simply way over rated. The over hyping of the movie itself already misleads people. It gives people a pretty high expectation for the movie, so if's the movie is okay, we'll feel that it's a bad one (worse than okay). If the movie is bad, we'll feel it's really bad one.And here are the reasons of why this movie itself (without any consideration of its overhyping around it):Spoilers below1. People say that Katniss issuch a great character with all her heart, mentality, and skills. The ""heart"" part, I agree. The ""mentality"" and ""skills"" part, I don't agree at all. Both her mentality and skills are not consistent, in this movie at least (I never read the book, that's why I'm reviewing the movie only ;p)Examples: I don't think replacing her younger sister is a super noble move at all, that's what a big sister or brother do anyway, except the older sibling feel that they can't win at all or doesn't care at allor worse, both. Okay, let's say it's a noble/bold move, then what? With the Hunger Games already going on year after year, they are suppossed to be prepared mentally and strategy wise! She hasn't prepared anything for the games except her hunting skills?? No strategy, no other kind of martial art or self defense at all? That's not consitent and doesn't make sense.She also get a lot of help: from the mentor when he sent the cream in her hiding to heal her open wound, Peeta's help when he persuaded the ""bad group"" to leave her and let her tired while he gave her chance to escape and plan soemething better, and also the little girl who's smart and idolize her, she also helped our so called great main character. So she's not that good actually. Even with all those helps, she barely made it.And how come his mentor can send in help like that? If the hunger game president really doesn' twnat to give the poor (district 12) too much hope, then he'll hold Katniss' mentor to be responsible for some kind of punishment, since it's not fair, especially against the president's will (we can see how he wants to control the outcome of the game).2. The fighting scenes is so annoying!! The camera work are worse than if a 5 year old holding a video camera and trying to film an MMA match! It keeps shaking so bad and going everywhere! And I am not exaggerating at all, it is that bad!!3. The movie is way too slow and too long. Recently, this become a trend for a so called big and great movie (I called them overhyped), examples of other movies which are way too slow and long (both great or bad movies): Transformers series, The dark Knight Rises, Battleship, etc. Why come back to the old school wy of presenting movies? Remember when we watch old James Bond series still played by great Sean Connery, awesome Roger Moore? They are great James Bond movies, just way too slow and long (4 minute on underwater diving scene, etc.). The James Bond movies played by Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig are pretty way faster pace.On top of all that, it's way overhyped, then it'll mislead people to have a very high expectation, so I was about to rate this movie 1 star but again, after I cool down from the overhyped, I just review the movie itself without the overhyping, I give it 2 stars.Ooh, one more. Why do they have to use children to figth to the death? Just use adult to fight to the death? That idea also makes me sick, seeing what they intended to be 12-16 year old killing each other (this question is more for the author of teh book, Suzanne Collins ;p)Anyway, the movie itself is okay.

1340200,A23BTLTIHMJN01,B003EYVXV4,A. Simon,"[0, 1]","Synopsis: general: in a (presumably) future dystopia, a country is divided into about a dozen districts, all under the heel of an autocratic central government. Decades ago, a revolt was put down and one of the results is that each district must annually present two tributes to the central government to fight to the death until only one survives, who is then rewarded. In this way, a certain degree of divide and conquer is maintained by the central government. The gladiator combat is televised and has become such an obsession in the society that our obsession with football/soccer/basketball pales by comparison.Synopsis: specific: out of dirt-poor District 12 a girl substitutes herself for her younger sister, who would obviously last all of ten seconds in the arena. The older sister (Katniss) is adept at the bow and arrow, so she may stand a chance. She and the boy are sent to the capital, where food and luxury are abundant. The inhabitants of the capital have makeup and dress as if Salvador Dali and Lady Gaga had been given the run of the place. All tributes are treated as celebrities, and participate in training and in-depth interviews conducted by Ceasar Flickerman, sporting an outrageous outfit and wig and played by Stanley Tucci, a character actor whose star has lately been rising rapidly. Throughout, none of the adults seem to appreciate the immorality of the situation; it just does not register with these people. Ultimately, Katniss is sent to the outdoor arena where she has to survive her vicious opponents. The weak tributes are dispatched quickly by the others and then it is her turn. However, her personality is a bit unique and this comes to her advantage.

While the book had its moments of cliche and trope abuse, it also managed to put a spin on most of them.  The film?  Not so much.This is not a movie that can be enjoyed by someone who didn't read the book.  Too much of the background, exploration of the setting (if one doesn't know about District 13, the reason for the Games falls apart.), of the characters, was scuttled.In every instance where we're supposed to be overwhelmed by the decadence of the Capital, the jaded elite who view the Games and make their livings by it, the movie manages to trip over its own feet and fall flat.  The entire train sequence, where Katniss and Peeta are supposed to be overwhelmed by the sheer luxury and the sheer amount of food available flopped--because what we saw looked more like the free continental breakfast you get at a Comfort Inn.  All of the key relationships have been scraped down to the bare bones development-wise.  A movie viewer gets *no* sense of why Katniss and her mother have the relationship they do, why some people put their names in for consideration more than once (a critical detail!)  Effie's character was reduced to a mere caricature, which was criminally stupid.  Donald Sutherland was *wasted* in this movie.  I hope he got a lot of money to make up for having to perform such a narrow, limited role.  The real horror of the dogs (muttations, to use the book's term), even the arena itself, got whitewashed.  Oddly, I'm most disappointed in the presentation of the Cornucopia--I was expecting a huge golden structure, not something that looked like it got dragged out of a railyard scrap heap.The only thing that made me sit up and take notice was the riot in District 11.  That, and Cato's penultimate scene at the Cornucopia--I actually felt sorry for him.  The soundtrack/score tried very hard to deliver, but at its best, it never went beyond late-80's one-hit wonder level.I saw this for free through Amazon Prime.

1340210,AAX387K7441BL,B003EYVXV4,AvidReader,"[3, 4]","There was so much hype surrounding this film that I really wasn't sure what to expect. The film is a great satire of reality television and it takes the concept behind shows like Survivor to the most extreme conclusion.  I really enjoyed this aspect of it, but I didn't think it was critical enough of the horrifying spectacle of children killing each other for sport.Apart from one character right at the beginning (I can't remember his name) who says that people should stop watching the Hunger Games, no one else in the entire film raises any kind of moral objection to the show or suggests any way of putting an end to the madness. I know viewers are meant to know the Hunger Games are barbaric and disgusting without it being spelled out, but I found it very hard to relate to characters like Woody Harrelson, who we are supposed to like, when they are so complicit with the murder of children. Katniss also never contemplates trying to escape, or does anything to stop the killings. Personally I'd prefer a heroine with more guts.It also seems ironic, not to mention hypocritical, to make a film about the horror of mudering children for entertainment when the movie itself is based on the murder of children for entertainment. We see them sliced and diced, and apart from the few characters we get to know, their deaths are not seen as tragic or horrifying. To make it more palatable many of the other tribues are portrayed as evil sadists who totally enjoy murdering their competitors. They band together and laugh and joke as they kill people, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they will be next. This wasn't realistic at all.I'm told the book is much better than the film, and I can see how some of the faults of the film come from adapting it from a novel. I really wanted more background history for this society which could be civilised in some ways and barbaric in others. Without this context it just doesn't ring true. I also found the characters pretty one-dimensional to be honest. Despite the fact that it's quite a long movie I never felt it delved very deeply into their psyches and I really didn't care that much for them.It sounds like I hated this movie, but I didn't.

1340211,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B003EYVXV4,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","Post-apocalyptic North America is controlled by Panem, a dictatorial state which enforces control through discipline and fear. Every year, two 'tributes' from each of Panem's twelve districts are chosen at random to do battle to the death. The survivor of the carnage becomes rich and famous, and the people are reminded of the Capitol's power. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister's place in the games, and must find a way to win despite her lack of experience and training.The Hunger Games is an adaptation of Suzanne Collins's YA novel of the same name and closely follows the events of the novel. Like the book, the film pits Katniss Everdeen in a fight to the death against twenty-three other youngsters, including her fellow contestant from District 12, Peeta Mellark. The story is divided into two distinct sections, the first involving Katniss's selection and preparation for the games and the second depicting the contest itself. This shift in setting and tone halfway through the film helps sustain and the tension and drama through the movie's running time (which, at almost two and a half hours, is fairly long for a YA movie).The script closely follows the plot of the novel, apart from a fairly elegant solution to the problem of the book being based on Katniss's heavily-internalised experiences. In the novel Katniss can only speculate on the motives of the people running the game, but in the film we cut away to what's going on the game control centre and with President Snow. This expands the scope of the film a little and helps set up the sequels rather better than the novel, which was not written with sequels in mind and didn't layer in a lot of foreshadowing for what would come after.The movie follows the book in presenting the Hunger Games as a satire on modern reality TV shows, but through the visual medium is able to take this a lot further through film clips of people commentating on the game like it was the latest season of The X-Factor. Unfortunately, rather like the book, the film also does not take this satirical edge far enough, instead opting for raising questions and then not exploring them far enough. This problem also extends to the story's use of violence and morality. As in the novel, Katniss and Peeta are never put into a position of having to kill any of the other victims of the game, only the 'bad guys' who revel in it. The movie cops out on putting Katniss and Peeter in real moral quandaries, which is a shame. The film also has variable CGI, with depictions of the Capitol's cityscape looking decidedly sub-par in places.Aside from that, the film works pretty well. The movie is quite long but there's a lot of plot to fit in. Director Gary Ross has a crip, fast-paced directing style that moves us through the novel's major story beats without sacrificing too much atmosphere. He often finds concise ways of giving us backstory and worldbuilding information without having to waste time on exposition, which keeps things moving along nicely.Performances are pretty good. The movie hinges on Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss and she nails the role perfectly, bringing the required mixture of anger, determination, bravery and guilelessness. Josh Hutcherson has to settle for merely being good in the role of Peeta, with more established performers like Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson and, of course, Donald Sutherland fufilling their roles with aplomb. Sutherland brings an air of real menace to the role of President Snow that bodes well for the sequels. Lenny Kravitz also impresses in the role of Cinna, though this role has been cut down from the books somewhat.With a good script, economic story-telling and solid performances, The Hunger Games (***) is overall an enjoyable movie.

Each one of these districts as a punishment for losing in a civil war has to provide two gladiators. All these gladiators have to fight to the death in a contest that is a reality TV show. It made little sense. As the film itself shows it is not a policy that passives the locals. Nor are many of the people selected the type that would produce a sporting contest that people would want to watch. We are talking here a blood sport and people that like to see blood sports want to see action. Many of these people did not even know how to fight. Many selected did not want to fight and tried to avoid it. What is the point for the viewer, to see such contestants.Nor did it make much sense as the game started to move away from the objective of the producers of this contest that the rules be changed. Surely, after seventy years it is supposed to be going, they would be extremely unlikely to change the rules.Furthermore, the action scenes are weak. If you are going to show a blood sport I would expect some real battles, some brutal scenes. Something more like Blood Royale.Nor do I see where all this money was suppose to be spent, the actual filming, I thought could have been better,  I would describe it as ordinary.

Its action packed!  It's a different kind of move with lots of eye catching scene's.  However, if you have read the book...get ready!Once the film was over...I was actually angry!  I feel they did a HUGE disservice to the book, the author and mainly the characters.  It's like talking about history and saying that the World War's were just wars, talking about the depression as just a hard time,  saying Romeo & Juliet were just trying to tick their parents off and were not really in love.  Yes it kept with the `Main' premise of Panam & the Hunger Games, but it couldn't tie them together at all since they left all the relationships out of the film.  Furthermore they tried to tie up the main book in one movie when it should have been in 2 parts (good on twilight directors for doing this).  They left out the main relationships with Katniss and Gale (they were not just friends & not just teenagers), Katniss and her mother (why Katniss hated her mother), Katniss & the village (btw that mockinjay pin-NOT BOUGHT AT THE HOB!), the whole train scene which is a HUGE part of the story that sets the stage for everything between Peeta and Katniss & Katniss & her Prep Crew/Cinna, & Katniss/Peeta & Haymitch. I mean even Effie was cut in half with her relationships!  I was furious at the way they in the film took Katniss & Peeta's relationship and made it look superficial, forced and only for show!  It should have said LOOSLEY BASED ON MAJOR  EVENTS IN THE BOOK. I will try not to give up too much but I feel like if you buy this movie you should know all the stuff they left our and the superficial way they made this deep movie (shame on the directors).Katniss & her sister were STARVING-almost to the point of death because their father was killed in a mining explosion and their mother 'checked out'.  The mom literally wouldn't move, no dinner, no taking care of her small children, she just zoned out after the dad was killed.  So Katniss was trying to sell anything they owned for any food and no one would help, no one would even look at the 'seam kid=trash'.  She was in the pouring rain, skin and bones trying to sell some threadbare clothing for any food possible when Peeta came out to feed the pigs at their house in the village.  They were the bakers in the village.  Peeta saw the starving girl, took pity on her, and went back into the bakery (don't want to give away too much so skipped some detail in here), came out and threw her some loaves of burned bread.  They took in each other for a while and then she left and was able to feed herself and her sister.  She even `made' her mother eat something.Katniss & Gale-they met on accident in the woods and became hunting partners as she could use a bow like an extension of her own arm  & she knew what plants were for what, as her father taught her.  Gale was a master at traps, had strength and was a fierce protector.  The forged a friendship based on need.  That grew into a friendship of trust, respect, need and a bond in which few know-they would protect each other at all costs and their families.  Only one of them was in love with the other.  Katniss was the only reason her family didn't starve and die.After the Reaping in the rooms BEFORE they were carted off in the train Peeta's dad came to see Katniss and not his son.  He brought Katniss cookies for the trip and told her that he would make sure that her sister wouldn't starve.  That this stranger to her and her family would do this really hit home with Katniss.  This is another detail that later will be needed.The train ride was HUGE!  This was as important as the Games in my opinion!  This is where Peeta (the whole time) showed that he was pure of heart, genuinely a good person, protective of Katniss (which no one knew why), take charge in a way people just listened and normally agreed.  He was very persuasive, had a way with people and Katniss was having a real issue not liking him.  He did little things here and there, tried to help her here and there, protected her against Haymitch and took care of things that as a Tribute shouldn't have cared about for his competition.  He said through it all that he wouldn't let the Capital change him, he would be him to the end even if it ended up killing him.  He wouldn't give them the satisfaction, he was very passive aggressive in a good way.  He has a huge personality that you don't realize until he is actually worked his way to you, LOL.  This was a VERY deep character!  Katniss and him have lots of different interactions that develop into other things later.  Unfort, most will see these as shallow since they didn't include any of this.  Peeta is a very genuine, caring, good person, and the movie made him seem very shallow and blah.During the training, there was so much left out & other things that were not even in the book...I.E. they were told by Haymitch to NOT show what they were good at!  They were to only show that to the judges at the end when the other tributes were not around.  There was a reason for this which they didn't show either.  This whole scene to me felt forced and very awkward like they were ad-libbing their lines.The prep crews were very intricate throughout the train & training, where Katniss formed bonds with these people and how they transformed her `painfully' into what she became.  In the film you didn't understand WHY on earth she would cling to Cinna who was just a stylist for an outfit for the hunger games, a Capital person who was putting her into this death situation...because they left all the stuff on the train out.  It looked forced and out of place.  This will need to be known later or parts to come wont make a bit of sense.Haymitch, they really did this character incorrect.  Haymitch is a JERK!  HUGE JERK!  There are reasons why but I don't want to give it away.  He was a severe drunk, couldn't hardly walk or move about, and constantly drunk (I mean drunk & falling off stages).  He was abrasive, crude, rude, obnoxious, & loud.  His interaction with Katniss is so rude, that you wonder why he is so mean to her.  Peeta has to take care of him a couple times as he is such a jerk.  He is not at all what is portrayed in the movie.  It took Peeta & Katniss almost going after him to get him to agree to a truce to train them.  In the movie, he didn't seem that bad.  NO he is a JERK (there are reasons which are not going to make sense later).When they do the chariot part I was horrified when they did the whole hand scene!  It was forced, shallow and was only for show!  Peeta did this as he was trying to calm Katniss, it was a genuine act of friendship to help her out, NOT FOR SHOW! She liked it in a way and she didn't understand why he was so nice.  It made them strong together.  By this time she was really starting to trust him, and his judgment which they totally didn't show throughout this.  Their relationship wasn't defined yet but there was something whether friendship, need, strength, like, whatever, but there was definitely something there, not just for show.  I actually yelled at the TV (WHAT) when he said that!Peeta wanted to protect Katniss so much that he was with the Careers as a strategy to protect her, knowing they would attack her first and he could stop them. The scenes in the Arena looked forced between Peeta & Katniss where the book was very smooth (because the book showed the relationship before and the movie tried to just add it in).  They related to each other, they depended on each other, they looked out for each other, they formed a stronger bond based upon their growing relationship.  It was not forced, it was not shallow, it was not just for show.  Then when she did kiss him, they totally made that SHALLOW.  That kiss was not shallow, it totally shook them both up!  Here again they took out the feeling of the book.  After this point Katniss didn't know what to think, she just knew something was different.  The last scene in the arena, was again forced (it was with no feeling), where the book had feeling!  I don't want to say because it's a major part, but it was not like the book at all especially the scene after.The mockingjay pin really ticked me off.  Katniss didn't buy it at the hob.  She was given it by her only `girl' friend.  She was so surprised and moved at this gesture.  She didn't even realize how much of a friend this girl was until that moment.Casting--Pres. Snow-FANTASTIC casting!  I saw him and immediately knew which character he was.  Same with Gale.  He was just about what I would have expected him to be. Great casting on Gale, totally believable!  Effie, Mom, Cinna, dad, game maker, the other Tributes -again great casting.  Katniss, she looked the part, most of the time she was believable but there was something missing.  Maybe it was that they screwed up the scripts and she was working with what she had.  I wish she had read the book and was more like the Katniss in there, that way I would totally see her in that part.  Haymitch-totally wrong in my opinion.  I love Woody, but not as Haymitch, he is too nice, too good to play a rough, nasty, jerk.  Now again like Katniss...it might have been the script and maybe he didn't read the book to get what Haymitch was really like.  But it was not believable at all to me.  Peeta...oh Peeta...I like this actor...however not as Peeta.  I didn't believe anything about him, not the way he interacted with the people, Katniss, or when he was trying to get her to run.  It all looked forced and out of place, he just didn't convince me he was Peeta.  Peeta & Katniss had NO chemistry whatsoever.  Peeta ended up after the series to be one of my favorite people when I loved Gale from the get go in the book.  They did the biggest disservice to him in my opinion.As a movie on its own, I thought it was good.  However, because I had read the book, been in the lives of these characters and felt what they felt and had been in their heads because of the book I was annoyed all throughout the movie.  They took the feeling out of the characters, and the movie where the books were FULL of feelings (how could they not with children being put into death situations).  I was very disappointed in the director & the author for allowing it.That's my opinion, take it as you may :-)",3,DONT READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,10399,"['Normally', 'dont',

1340305,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B003EYVXV4,Brian Driver,"[2, 6]","IN A SENTENCE: I really enjoyed the books, and felt the first movie did a great job of condensing the sensational and unconventional novel for the big screen.I saw the movie with my two grown daughters, and all of us are ""Hunger Games"" aficionados (I'm almost 60, and my kids are 27 and 30).  We all loved the movie, discussed the film as we drove home, and we found few real problems.First of all, the acting was terrific.  Jennifer Lawrence did a fine job capturing Katniss, though I didn't get the same feeling of anger perennially seething under her skin.  That bothered me, but my daughters had no problems there.I thought Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth as Peeta and Gale, respectively, were both terrific.  Gale's part was very minimal, but he was certainly the right actor for the part.  Peeta is spot on as the ""doughy"" baker whose lack of skills as a fighter are counterbalanced by his wisdom at assessing the politics necessary to survival.Lenny Kravitz was a great choice as Cinna, and I would have given him more screen time.  In fact, I was extremely pleased with the entire Capital scenes...their depraved innocence, their stupidity, their love of spectacle, their entire sense of action without consequence--I felt Director Gary Ross and his compatriots did these scenes justice.  Donald Sutherland as President Snow, Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman and Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane--all accurately cast and cleverly played.Willow Shields was fine as Primrose, but her role did not ask for a lot in this movie.  I believe the reasons they picked her will become apparent by the third movie.There was not too much to complain about here: Understandably, the book did a far better job at getting into Katniss' head, especially when it came to the relationship she had with Peeta.  It's there, but her struggles with her feelings are not detailed, and because of that I would guess that those unfamiliar with the novels will not catch on to the problems she had with authenticity of her feelings.Also there, but decreased, is Haymitch's drunkenness.  He is still a drinker, but it presents nowhere near the impact here that it did in the novel.  He overcomes his dependency rapidly, almost as if it is simply an affectation and nothing more.I didn't think they did justice to the role of Katniss' mom, played by Paula Malcomson.  This is especially true when it came to the period of mourning after her husband's death when she ""checked out"" mentally and left her kids to survive on their own.  It was mentioned, but I do not believe it was not choreographed well enough for those who did not read the book to to gather its import.There are other significant changes, and many will have to be weighed as the movie's sequels move along.  One I'm interested in is the small change made concerning this movie's lack of follow up to the hovercraft scene witnessed by Katniss and Gale.  They showed the hovercraft, but there was nothing further in this movie...I'm hoping there might be a clever twist coming up.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear about this; I feel it would be too much of a spoiler to go into here.All in all, this movie is very faithful to the book, and it makes me really ""hunger"" for the sequels.  What will the setting of the second Hunger Game look like?  What about the bunker in the third movie?  What about the urban warfare in movie 4?  The sewers?I'm really looking forward to it all.",5,Hunger Games leaves you hungry for more,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,3458,"['IN', 'SENTENCE', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'books', 'felt', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'condensing', 'sensational', 'unconventional', 'novel', 'big', 'screen.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'two', 'grown', 'daughters', 'are', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'aficionados', ""'m"", 'almost', '60', 'kids', 'are', '27', '30', 'loved', 'movie', 'discussed', 'film', 'drove', 'home', 'found', 'few', 'real', 'problems.First', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'capturing', 'Katniss', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'feeling', 'anger', 'perennially', 'seething', 'skin', 'bothered', 'daughters', 'had', 'problems', 'there.I', 'thought', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Peeta', 'Gale', 'respectively', 'were', 'terrific', 'Gale', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'minimal', 'was', 'certainly', 'right', 'actor', 'part', 'Peeta', 'spot', 'doughy', 'baker', 'lack', 'skills', 'fighter', 'are', 'counterbalanced', 'wisdom', 'assessing', 'politics', 'necessary', 'survival.Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'Cinna', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'fact', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'entire', 'Capital', 'scenes', 'depraved', 'innocence', 'stupidity', 'love', 'spectacle', 'entire', 'sense', 'action', 'consequence', 'felt', 'Director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'compatriots', 'did', 'scenes', 'justice', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'President', 'Snow', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Effie', 'Trinket', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Caesar', 'Flickerman', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Seneca', 'Crane', 'accurately', 'cast', 'cleverly', 'played.Willow', 'Shields', 'was', 'fine', 'Primrose', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'ask', 'lot', 'movie', 'believe', 'reasons', 'picked', 'will', 'become', 'apparent', 'third', 'movie.There', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'complain', 'here', 'Understandably', 'book', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'getting', 'Katniss', 'head', 'especially', 'when', 'came', 'relationship', 'had', 'Peeta', 'there', 'struggles', 'feelings', 'are', 'not', 'detailed', 'would', 'guess', 'unfamiliar', 'novels', 'will', 'not', 'catch', 'problems', 'had', 'authenticity', 'feelings.Also', 'there', 'decreased', 'Haymitch', 'drunkenness', 'still', 'drinker', 'nowhere', 'impact', 'here', 'did', 'novel', 'dependency', 'rapidly', 'almost', 'simply', 'affectation', 'nothing', 'more.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'justice', 'role', 'Katniss', 'mom', 'played', 'Paula', 'Malcomson', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'came', 'period', 'mourning', 'husband', 'death', 'when', 'checked', 'out', 'mentally', 'left', 'kids', 'survive', 'own', 'was', 'mentioned', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'not', 'choreographed', 'well', 'enough', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'gather', 'import.There', 'are', 'other', 'significant', 'changes', 'many', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'weighed', 'movie', 'sequels', 'move', 'along', 'One', ""'m"", 'interested', 'small', 'change', 'made', 'concerning', 'movie', 'lack', 'follow', 'up', 'hovercraft', 'scene', 'witnessed', 'Katniss', 'Gale', 'showed', 'hovercraft', 'was', 'nothing', 'further', 'movie', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'might', 'be', 'clever', 'twist', 'coming', 'up', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'clear', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'spoiler', 'go', 'here.All', 'movie', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'really', 'hunger', 'sequels', 'What', 'will', 'setting', 'second', 'Hunger', 'Game', 'look', 'What', 'bunker', 'third', 'movie', 'What', 'urban', 'warfare', 'movie', '4', 'sewers', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward']",N/A

Please do not read this as a rant, but rather a fans opinion.This movie is garbage in the representation of the books. It was created specifically with Twilight fan-girls in mind. The first chunk of the movie is very, very slow and does not explain anything well. If you did not read the book (or books, actually, as the movie jumps a bit ahead on features), I cannot see something really understanding what is going on. At the very least, the true meaning from the book is lost.""HEY! Movies can't be exactly like the books!"" you may say. Yes, I agree with this but to a point. The books revolve around the main fact: the Capital forces two children from each district to brutally murder each other to survive. The film makers took this and decided - for the young children audience - that the kids would fluff each other to death. Deaths magically become fuzzy or shaky, with music or odd sound overlayed to the scene.I went to see this movie opening night at a nice theater - it cost me about $20 a reserved seat which I purchased first available day. It was packed 90% with teenage girls who screamed over the barely-there deaths and gasped out loud over the kiss which, if you read the book, is not a ""real"" kiss. Before the movie 12 year old girls were running around yelling ""TEAM PEETA!"".Greed took advantage of what had amazing potential. Money was the key factor - young girls will be running out to buy the ""team"" shirts and action figure toys.

1340311,ARX72X8U1HFLJ,B003EYVXV4,"Brittany Moore ""Reading Nook""","[1, 4]","I am one of the many that really enjoyed The Hunger Games series, so of course I was excited and nervous to see the movie. In short, I thought they did a very excellent job at it. The casting was spot on. I think every actor fit perfectly with the character they were playing. I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was done really well. There were quite a few things left out or condensed, but all in all I was not very disappointed.Now for the long of it and there will be spoilers so reader beware ;)There was barely any beginning to this movie. Everything happens very fast. You are introduced to some of the important characters, but they hardly feel important as Katniss and Peeta were whisked off to the Hunger Games. I think it worked okay for the movie, but it makes Peeta the logical love intrest, so it sort of cuts down on the internal struggle Katniss has picking between them. Next Madge? Anyone? Anyone? No Madge?! Why not. I think that Madge played a subtly important role and I was quite dismayed that they blotted out her existence. So the tributes are getting ready at the Capitol and I just felt like there wasn't much between Katniss and Peeta then. I think all the emotions that happen pre-games is what made them such dynamic characters in the books. You could see that they sort of become friends and then you see Peeta slow betrayal of that trust, that makes you wonder about him. I just felt like the character interactions could have been a bit stronger for the movie. I did love Cinna and Katniss, but again their movie relationship seemed a bit shallow and abrupt. There were also no transports for the dead bodies, which seemed a bit odd to take out, but ultimately didn't ruin the movie. I wished that there was more about Foxface but again, wasn't crucial to the story so they took it out. There were tons of things I loved about this movie though, like the command central for the games. It was very interesting to see the behind the scenes of the games. As easy as thinking it and they could do it. I'll mention the cast again, because the acting was great and they fit the characters so well. Definitely check out this movie. It got me so excited for the next three movies. I'm super excited to see the arena in Catching Fire. It's going to be crazy.

All of this bubbled up in one big cauldron of non-stop adventure!Our heroine, attractive young, capable, 16 year old Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, sets out early one misty morning crossing secretly into the &#34;forbidden zone&#34; to hunt. Armed only with her trusty bow and arrows, she stalks and takes aim at an innocent doe with deer eyes. I can't bear it! But, out of nowhere, who should appear but her tall dark prince charmer/neighbor Gale Hawthorne, played by hunky Liam Hemsworth! Wise beyond his years, he proceeds to demonstrate to her how she might put to better use her skills as an effective archer, in the future. Hint! hint!The forest is lush, green and serene paralleled to the &#34;highly advanced metropolis&#34; in which &#34;The Capitol&#34; is located; This, in brutal contrast to the barren wasteland of Panem City where Katniss is forced to live with her mother and younger sister.While we are slowly being introduced into this sterile &#34;post-apocalyptic&#34; environment, there is an ever present underlying ominous pale, looming over the town folk! Soon enough we discover that they are preparing for an inevitable event.Everyone will be summoned to The Capitol square, where each year one boy and one girl will be selected as &#34;Tribute&#34;. From each of 12 districts a pair will be chosen through a lottery to participate in what amounts to a death match. The repeating anthem being &#34;May all the luck be in your favor&#34;. The event, akin to the Superbowl, will be viewed on big screen monitors for the enjoyment of all to see.Voila, The Hunger Games are born!The rest of the principals in this entertaining cast o heroes victims and villains consists of Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, the unlikely boy tribute from district 12. Katniss young sister is originally picked but Katniss herself will later volunteer as tribute sparing her sister.Rounding out the cast are Mentor to our two tributes, Haymitch Abernathy, played craftily by Woody Harrelson. A semi-unrecognizable Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, aka groom and stylist to the stars; Wes Bentley as the inept minion Seneca Crane to the supreme leader of &#34;The Capitol&#34; gang, President Snow, played by Donald Sutherland who is always a joy.I never expected the clever twists and turns, the way the story skillfully unfolds, the stunning visuals and the inspiring soundtrack!Although i felt it lacking in some strange inexplicable way, it was a surprisingly well crafted PG-13 syfy-ish romp in the woods from the starting countdown all the way to the winners circle!Enjoy!",5,-The Hunger Games...Not Unlike the Downvote Game-,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,3156,"['Hunger', 'Games', 'Directed', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'Seabiscuit', 'real', 'witches', 'brew', 'many', 'genre', 'see', '34', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', '34', 'caricatures', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'over-the-top', 'flaming', 'flamboyant', 'bouffant', 'blue', 'haired', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'Caesar', 'Flickerman', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'apply', 'named', 'comic-book', 'fashionesta', 'Effie', 'Trinket.Then', 'have', 'pinch', '34', 'Lord', 'Rings', '34', 'grandeur', 'dash', 'ruthless', '34', 'Lord', 'Flies', '34', 'child', 'cinematic', 'atmosphere', 'touch', '34', 'Harry', 'Potter', '34', 'fantasy', 'big', 'dose', 'TV', '34', 'Survivor', '34', 'reality', 'show', 'bubbled', 'up', 'one', 'big', 'cauldron', 'non-stop', 'adventure', 'heroine', 'attractive', 'young', 'capable', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'out', 'early', 'one', 'misty', 'morning', 'crossing', 'secretly', '34', 'forbidden', 'zone', '34', 'hunt', 'Armed', 'only', 'trusty', 'bow', 'arrows', 'stalks', 'aim', 'innocent', 'doe', 'deer', 'eyes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'nowhere', 'who', 'should', 'appear', 'tall', 'dark', 'prince', 'charmer/neighbor', 'Gale', 'Hawthorne', 'played', 'hunky', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Wise', 'years', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'might', 'put', 'better', 'use', 'skills', 'effective', 'archer', 'future', 'Hint', 'hint', 'forest', 'lush', 'green', 'serene', 'paralleled', '34', 'highly', 'advanced', 'metropolis', '34', '34', 'Capitol', '34', 'located', 'brutal', 'contrast', 'barren', 'wasteland', 'Panem', 'City', 'where', 'Katniss', 'forced', 'live', 'mother', 'younger', 'sister.While', 'are', 'slowly', 'being', 'introduced', 'sterile', '34', 'post-apocalyptic', '34', 'environment', 'ever', 'present', 'underlying', 'ominous', 'pale', 'looming', 'town', 'folk', 'Soon', 'discover', 'are', 'preparing', 'inevitable', 'event.Everyone', 'will', 'be', 'summoned', 'Capitol', 'square', 'where', 'year', 'one', 'boy', 'one', 'girl', 'will', 'be', 'selected', '34', 'Tribute', '34', '12', 'districts', 'pair', 'will', 'be', 'chosen', 'lottery', 'participate', 'what', 'amounts', 'death', 'match', 'repeating', 'anthem', 'being', '34', 'May', 'luck', 'be', 'favor', '34', 'event', 'akin', 'Superbowl', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'big', 'screen', 'monitors', 'enjoyment', 'see.Voila', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'born', 'rest', 'principals', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'o', 'heroes', 'victims', 'villains', 'consists', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Peeta', 'Mellark', 'unlikely', 'boy', 'tribute', 'district', '12', 'Katniss', 'young', 'sister', 'originally', 'picked', 'Katniss', 'will', 'later', 'volunteer', 'tribute', 'sparing', 'sister.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Mentor', 'two', 'tributes', 'Haymitch', 'Abernathy', 'played', 'craftily', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'semi-unrecognizable', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'Cinna', 'aka', 'groom', 'stylist', 'stars', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'inept', 'minion', 'Seneca', 'Crane', 'supreme', 'leader', '34', 'Capitol', '34', 'gang', 'President', 'Snow', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'always', 'joy.I', 'never', 'expected', 'clever', 'twists', 'turns', 'way', 'story', 'skillfully', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'inspiring', 'soundtrack', 'i', 'felt', 'lacking', 'strange', 'inexplicable', 'way', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'crafted', 'PG-13', 'syfy-ish', 'romp', 'woods', 'starting', 'countdown', 'way', 'winners', 'circle', 'Enjoy']",N/A

But to be fair, I wouldn't be considered the target audience for the Twilight series as well, and I to some degree did enjoy that series, and am actually looking forward to the final installment later in the year.  Will Kristen Stewart drain Robert Pattison's blood?  Oops, already done that I suppose. . . .What's the difference then between Twilight and Games?  Well, Twilight doesn't take itself too seriously, at least it hasn't since the first film perhaps.  It pokes fun of itself, which probably means that the ""real"" Twilight fans may not like it as much, but it's more approachable for the casual fan.  Plus, I always get a laugh out of the whole six-pack-abs thing.  I laughed my head off when Taylor Lautner took off his shirt in the freezing cold on top of Mount Ranier.  (OK.  It probably wasn't Mt. Rainier for the nitpickers out there, but it was close enough by geography.)I made my wife watch ""Games""; she was (smartly) against it from the start.  But she had some great observations.  First of all, ""No talking during the movie!""  (Couldn't help myself.  I just didn't get the first half and had to ask questions, questions to someone who didn't seem to have any answers.)  Second, ""Why is Woody Harrelson a drunk in the first act and sober in the last couple?""  Hmm.  Good call.  Maybe he had an intervention that we didn't see on film?  Well, I have to say, Mr. Harrelson's performance here is downright awful, almost bad enough to make them cancel the games.  But let the games begin anyways!  Stanley Tucci was very good here, but when isn't he?  I'm a fairly big fan of his and I think that he does very nice work.  I thought that Jennifer Lawrence was a wise casting choice, but the male lead (who is he?) was somewhat of a throwaway.Now, onto major issues.  I did not read the book, and I fear that one almost has to read first to have any idea what's happening in the first act.  What year is it set in?  I'm guessing around 2100, but that is only a guess.  They didn't seem to say.  No one seems to have money for food, but why do they have lots of money for high-speed rail through the mountains?  The questions go on and on for me.  I could list more but I don't want to burn your time, like the 2.5 hours that I did last night.Well, the last act almost redeems the movie.  I did like some of that.  But what I'm looking forward to:  seeing how Ms. Stewart and Mr. Pattinson get along in the afterlife.

1340385,A2NJRBJFBTF54A,B003EYVXV4,Charles Camp,"[1, 2]","The Hunger Games is a movie about the authoritarian rule of a corrupt government that sponsors an annual reality-TV death-match between innocent kids. Sounds horrific right? Repulsive? Inhuman? You'd think so. Yet the only horror here is that the film plays out like a shallow, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster complete with an obligatory love plot and green screens galore.Seriously, talk about wasted potential. The source material is definitely there. The themes take nods from classics like George Orwell's 1984, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, and Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, laying the groundwork for a film that could've been a deep, disturbing philosophical examination of human nature and the dangers of government. I'm honestly upset that I didn't read the novel before seeing the film. In the hands of a capable and talented director, I truly feel that this story could've made for a fantastically effective, provocative film.This is what ultimately makes the end result so frustrating to watch. It's basically like gearing up to lift an 800 lb dumbbell only to have your arms swing effortlessly upward as you realize the weights are made of Styrofoam. What should've been an excruciatingly weighty, stimulating affair ended up being about as heavy as a dollop of whipped cream, and just as sweet. And that is true hypocrisy of the film as well: we're supposed to be condemning of government and the characters that put on the Hunger Games, and yet the film itself falls into the same category of glamorizing and diluting what should be portrayed as an atrocity. The action is stylized, the grit and violence is subdued, the CG-sheen is blinding, and the love plot is ham-fisted. The true meat of this story, the implications of such a horrific form of entertainment and the underlying themes of how it could've come to be, are almost swept completely under the rug.And don't get me wrong here. I'm not just condemning this movie because it wasn't what I thought it should've been. I love stylized action and I there's nothing wrong with an entertaining blockbuster. But the problem is this movie fails on that level as well. The action sequences are uninspired and just plain boring, which is probably a consequence of the fact that the movie never worked to make me emotionally invested. How can I possibly care about these kids fighting for their lives when 90% of them don't have more than four lines in the film and are portrayed as one-dimensional villains? To me, the majority of these characters were as expendable as they were to the citizens of the Capitol. They ended up feeling more like willing, eager participants than desperate, victimized innocents.The bottom line here is a movie that could've been a deep, provocative, distrurbing look at human nature ending up being a shallow Hollywood affair that barely scratched the surface of the underlying themes of its source material.

But the details that were there were true to the book.Panem (the parts we see) and the Capitol are portrayed very well.  I felt like I was really seeing the poverty-stricken districts, such as District #12, where the main characters (Katniss and Peeta) come from.  And the contrast between the districts and the luxurious Capitol is striking, just as in the book.Casting was spot on.  Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is perfect in the role.  Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark is great, although I thought he was a bit more macho in the movie than the novel version.  Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne does a good job, although we don't see him much in this part one movie. I didn't think I was going to like Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy but he surprised me and I thought he did a spectacular job.Tyranny, oppression, the haves and the have-nots - all are seen in this movie of a dystopian future.

It is basically an amalgam of ""The Running Man"", ""Lord of the Flies"", a Japanese movie that was banned in the United States until just recently called, ""Battle Royale"" and the television show ""Survivor."" ""Hunger Games"" may have borrowed its concepts, but it certainly made the most of them.""Hunger Games"" started as a novel in 2008 written by Suzanne Collins. In the not-too-distant future, North America has collapsed and it has been divided into 12 districts. A law was passed after the 12 districts rose up against their government and failed.  The law was that in order to keep the peace the districts would randomly select a boy and a girl to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a brutal, televised, survival fight to the death in which only one participant would emerge the victor.It is a touchy concept pitting children against each other in a fight to the death. It was touchy enough of a concept that Japan's version of putting children against each other in the fight to the death, ""Battle Royale"" was only just now released in the United States despite its release in 2000. Although ""Battle Royale"" chose a more gory route and chose to emphasize the violence, ""Hunger Games"" chose to emphasize the personality of its main character, Katniss Everdeen, and the humanity inside her despite her surroundings.""Hunger Games"" may on the surface seem like an ugly and depressing film and it can be, but it also is a challenging and thought provoking film about government control and not letting the world around you define who you are. Jennifer Lawrence (X:Men First Class & Winters Bone) plays the main character Katniss, a girl who has learned to live off the land, hunt and survive. Her experience with a bow and surviving in the woods gives her a leg up for the toughest part of the game, surviving in difficult environments. Yet, that didn't train her for the other part of the game, having to take another human's life.""Hunger Games"" never once falters in keeping its audiences interest. It is from beginning to end, a suspense thriller that has you hooked into the characters lives and the dire situation they are facing. Some of its authenticity is lost in the studio making a financial decision to make sure they got a PG-13, but only enough to make what could have been a great film into just a good one.There are two more books in the ""Hunger Games"" series, ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mockingjay"", and I for one will be waiting with great anticipation for the release of those movies as well.",4,Well done... but hindered by studio driven PG-13,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2568,"['concepts', 'themes', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'basically', 'amalgam', 'Running', 'Man', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'was', 'banned', 'United', 'States', 'just', 'recently', 'called', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'television', 'show', 'Survivor', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'may', 'have', 'borrowed', 'concepts', 'certainly', 'made', 'most', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'started', 'novel', '2008', 'written', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'North', 'America', 'collapsed', 'been', 'divided', '12', 'districts', 'law', 'was', 'passed', '12', 'districts', 'rose', 'up', 'government', 'failed', 'law', 'was', 'order', 'keep', 'peace', 'districts', 'would', 'randomly', 'select', 'boy', 'girl', 'participate', 'annual', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'brutal', 'televised', 'survival', 'fight', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'participant', 'would', 'emerge', 'victor.It', 'touchy', 'concept', 'pitting', 'children', 'other', 'fight', 'death', 'was', 'touchy', 'enough', 'concept', 'Japan', 'version', 'putting', 'children', 'other', 'fight', 'death', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'was', 'only', 'just', 'now', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'release', '2000', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'chose', 'more', 'gory', 'route', 'chose', 'emphasize', 'violence', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'chose', 'emphasize', 'personality', 'main', 'character', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'humanity', 'surroundings', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'may', 'surface', 'seem', 'ugly', 'depressing', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'challenging', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'government', 'control', 'not', 'letting', 'world', 'define', 'who', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'X', 'Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Winters', 'Bone', 'main', 'character', 'Katniss', 'girl', 'who', 'learned', 'live', 'off', 'land', 'hunt', 'survive', 'experience', 'bow', 'surviving', 'woods', 'leg', 'up', 'toughest', 'part', 'game', 'surviving', 'difficult', 'environments', 'did', ""n't"", 'train', 'other', 'part', 'game', 'having', 'take', 'human', 'life', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'never', 'once', 'falters', 'keeping', 'audiences', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'hooked', 'characters', 'lives', 'dire', 'situation', 'are', 'facing', 'authenticity', 'lost', 'studio', 'making', 'financial', 'decision', 'make', 'sure', 'got', 'PG-13', 'only', 'enough', 'make', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'just', 'good', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'books', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'series', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'Mockingjay', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'great', 'anticipation', 'release', 'movies', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Jennifer Lawrence is amazing of course, but Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson seem a little 'vague' in their performances.  They are both much more solid in the second film.A couple of things to bring to attention: this film does detour from the novel a bit more than Catching Fire, though it stays it's course for the most part.  Second: the transfer is horrible.  The picture quality is decent enough, but there are at least a dozen points where the film blacks out for a split second up to two seconds.  This is not my player (running a newer PS3 and I have not had any issues with other films).  I think the holiday special was for a cheaper pressing.  They case is terrible, lightweight, thin recycled plastic (got no problem with recycled, but give me a better case).  No booklets of course, not many extras.  Budget price means budget pressing I guess.  Third: the cameramen needed to stay off the caffeine or get the wobble smoothing cameras.  I understand this was an intentional choice, but it makes me nauseous watching the camera float and bump around A LOT.  Probably a directorial choice, and probably one more reason he was replaced for the second film.If not for the glitches I would have given this 4 stars.

It looks like a film from the early 80's and I see nothing that says 2012!  I do not like the look of the film as many characters have strange hairdos which is the usual stereotypical ""futuristic hairdo"" which are complete with cuts that are weird.This is one of those dystopian films where you assume it is the future, but by the looks of things, the time period is all over the place.  On the on hand it looks like the future, on the other it looks like the 1940's or earlier.  I really hate when films do this.  The special effects were sorry as well.  If there were some that I did not notice, then maybe they were great.The story is one that we can relate to today.  Athletes from poor communities compete for fame and wealth given by the elites in order to give them HOPE that they can be something that they are not and be on the side with the elite.  Little do they realize that they are only entertainment and nothing more.  They make no decisions, hold no power (only popularity), plan nothing and all they have comes from the elite in terms of money and fame.  You go against the elite and they take it away, just ask Chad Johnson!The Hunger Games world is one that we live in today, just not as stripped down and with the aura of freedom, but we are never free.  Having to pay taxes when you don't want to is a prime example of not being free.  Don't pay taxes and you are off to jail and everything that you worked for is taken away!  Ask Red Foxx!  What the Hunger Games does is to give us a glimpse into the madness of the ruling elite in their quest for one-world government (with them at the head of course - something has to lead it) with 'certain' people at the top and everyone else as slaves.In order to bring about a world government, the rich - who literally own all of the money, but up everyone's property and possessions (Cash for Gold!), ruin the economy (one that they built in order to benefit ONLY them), make people desperate enough to accept socialism (with a patsy leader implementing it) which is CONTROLLED (rationed) wealth, which in turn makes people NOT want to compete, with the idea that the elite will have no future challengers to their rule!  Of course no religion (except that of the elites, which only they can practice) also helps to eliminate any ideological opposition as well.  Socialism does not allow the type of wealth which could create weapons, payoffs etc. of any would-be challenger to power.  Hitler wanted a 1,000 reich, and so do the elite.  The thing that has eluded empires throughout history was how to take the ENTIRE world and keep under their rule.  This part is still being played out as they continue to take out ""rogue"" (not under their control) nations and nations with advanced war capability.For pointing out the world that we live in and the sorry world that we may be headed towards, this film is good at pointing that out.  As far as the presentation of the film - I don't like it.  I also did not like the lone black girl in an every man for himself killing game, the black girl somehow finds some ""good ol"" fried chicken!  They never forget to add that do they?  The same could be said of the lame love story.  There are 23 people in a game - a game of death, and they have to kill each other so that only one remains.  Why are some people concerned about other people's well being?  I know the point of the film was to show how the elites will make you do what they want, including becoming a killing machine, then they give you wealth, homes and you are deemed ""OK,"" but why did some care about the other when their lives were on the line?  I guess the ending gives us a clue.  I won't tell that.The Blu-Ray quality is good, but the picture is a little softer than I would prefer.

They left out a lot and changed quite a bit, but really, in order to get the story into just 2 1/2 hours they did a great job. Acting was great and so was setting and make-up. This movie is great for anyone who loves adventure, strength, some politics, and just a little romance and angst. It's pretty original. And I was very happy with the fact that the hero is a female but they didn't play that fact up. It's not a feminist tale by any means. So I love this movie and the books it's based on.

I won't summarize the movie since there are some really good ones here but would like to address the actors who portrayed the characters. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, as is Liam Hemsworth as Gale. At first, I wasn't sure Woody Harrelson fit the part of Haymitch but he won me over. As did Josh Hutcherson, who seemed too small for Peeta, but he does a great job in this role.

Predicting the future has always been a stumbling block for most science fiction writers. We've seen plenty of versions regarding how terrible the future will be... going all the way back to Huxley and Wells. This one divides the country (I presume it is America) into the very wealthy and the very poor, with one poor person given the chance to survive a publically broadcast games that pit children against one another until only one is left standing. This is about as likely as never happening. The premise is so weak as to make the rest of the movie a joke. Supporting performances are also weak. The film relies almost entirely on special effects and the performances of Lawrence and veteran Donald Sutherland. While I love science fiction, I found the end did not justify the means. The plot is weak throughout and solution is open ended, hence Hunger Games, two - will Jennifer end up with her true boyfriend; will she have to volunteer for the games again (she'd have to survive because I believe there is a book three!!!!).

But I did have a few issues with the film. I was hopping the beginning would have more scenes involving Katniss with her mother and sister. Why did they change the way she received the mockingjay pin? Where was the district 12 mayor and his daughter (I can't remember her name.)?The training and pre-events were too long.. I read several reviews of the movie before I watched it and they all talked about the graphic violence. In my opinion the violence was toned down compared to the book, probably to get a PG-13 rating. In the book, didn't Katniss shoot Marvel in the neck and not the stomach? Didn't Rue's district send Katniss a loaf of bread? What was up with the hound-like creatures? In the book the hounds resembled the fallen Tributes. Does anyone recall the soundtrack that was released in March with Taylor Swift, The Civil Wars, and others? Besides from a few songs during the ending credits, the others were missing in action.Like I said, I liked the movie.

1340466,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B003EYVXV4,CriticNic,"[0, 1]","I've reviewed the insanely popular book The Hunger Games in both written and video form. The video review still continues to be one of the most viewed on YouTube and is one of my most viewed videos. That just says something about how a story can have so much of an impact. The film version of the first book of the series was sure to be a success with an already astounding fan base, so I was quite eager to check it out. Luckily, I was able to get press access to an early screening of this one (yay me!), which made it all the more exciting.The film is directed by Gary Ross, which was a surprising choice for me. He's most known for films like Seabiscuit and Pleasantville, so I was unsure how he'd handle such an over-the-top production that the material called for. He ended up being a fine choice however, as the book's fantastical futuristic and post-apocalyptic world was translated perfectly onto the screen. The writing is also done by Ross, with the book's author Suzanne Collins and Billy Ray contributing to the screenplay. The follows very closely to the book, which was certainly a wise choice in order to not upset the already huge group of book fans that were guaranteed to purchase a ticket.The Hunger Games follows 12 districts which formerly made up North America, now known as Panem. Panem is run by a totalitarian government known as the Capitol. Each year the Capitol reminds the citizens of their control by holding the Hunger Games, a fight-to-the-death survival competition featuring a boy and girl chosen at random from each district. The concept may sound similar, as the idea has been done in many other books and movies, however The Hunger Games still does manage to be unique enough to hold its own. There have been constant comparisons to other certain titles, however I find such comparisons pointless as the characters and world Collins created are original and interesting.The story centers on 16 year old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of the rustic and impoverished District 12. During the Reaping, or selection ceremony for the tributes that will represent the district in the games, Katniss' younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) gets chosen. Without a second thought, Katniss throws herself forward and volunteers to take Prim's place. The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), and shortly after the two head towards the Capitol for their training where they are introduced to a world unlike anything they have seen in their village.The Capitol was where most of my worries about the film adaptation existed. The futuristic world called for technology that doesn't exist and wild clothing and hairdos (and skindos), which I wasn't sure if they'd be able to match my imagination's interpretation. However I was pleasantly surprised at the film's ability to capture the book's descriptions nearly perfectly. Not that I deny the ability of the talented individuals that have churned out some breathtaking effects and designs over the past several years, but it's tough I think for a film to match what most people picture when reading the book. In this case, I think they nailed it.Once the games actually kick off, the excitement doesn't let up. For fans of survival adventure movies such as myself, the film is a treat. There's an excellent display of survival techniques and tactical scenarios. While the film does don a PG-13 rating, there is also a surprising amount of violence involved. The story, after all, does involve kids killing kids, but the film is impressively able to pull of some of the more gruesome scenes without exploiting the gore and carnage. The action scenes are adrenaline-filled, which is good but could also give some viewers motion sickness. The camera work is fast, moving right along at the pace of the action. I liked the style at times, but the shaky cam also did hinder the detail of some of the combat scenes.The pacing of the film also works both in favor of and against the movie. At over 2 hours long, it feels much shorter. Because of this, however, many scenes that in the book were very emotional and significant seemed very much rushed past in the film, placing more attention to the action. I understand there's a lot of ground to cover with the story, and in order to keep it to one part they had to do a bit of cramming, but a few pivotal scenes were either ignored or barely touched on which was a disappointment.Being highly impressed with Lawrence in Winter's Bone, I knew she would tackle the role of Katniss with ease and she certainly did. I'm not usually too impressed with Josh Hutcherson, but I felt he did well as Peeta. The rest of the cast was just perfect, from Woody Harrelson as the drunken mentor Haymitch, to the always impressive Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman. The colorful characters were represented well, and I felt like the actors really brought each one to life.The film overall is a great example of a book adaptation done well. There may have been a few things I would have liked to have seen, but it captures a huge amount of detail in a relatively short time that seems to go by without notice. With the Games' impressive arena, full of manipulated nature and engineered animals, combined with a perfect cast and action that never lets up once it gets started, I can imagine without having read the book there really wouldn't be a lot to be unimpressed with. While the books may be popular with the female teen audience, due to its empowering heroine, this is a matured teen survival adventure flick that adults of both sexes can enjoy.Source: criticnic.com

I think the movie helps the warmth of the books fundamental characters but dosen't do justice to the gritty quality of life Katniss and friends were forced to endure. The lesser characters of the book aren't as prominent in the movie. IMHO the three books in this series do a much better job coloring stories (with characters) in that way. The movie does a good job at reloading your anxiety over governmental controls when applied to society as a whole.

1340470,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003EYVXV4,C. Sawin,"[18, 27]","I have not read The Hunger Games. I went into this movie completely blind and was pretty unimpressed with the trailers and TV spots. So I was completely unprepared for the gargantuan turnout for the screening I attended two days before this soon-to-be-blockbuster's release. All I heard about beforehand was how similar The Hunger Games was to Battle Royale and how it was a rip-off. Considering how big of a Battle Royale fan I am and how I just finished revisiting and reviewing its recent release, that didn't really sit well with me. So expectations were kind of a muddled mess for me. As it turns out, The Hunger Games is one of the best mainstream movies to hit theaters so far this year.Battle Royale wastes little time getting to the main course featuring young adults under the age of eighteen brutally murdering each other against their will. The Hunger Games takes its time and I think that's its biggest asset. We get a glimpse into the life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) before she volunteers for her sister at the ceremony before seeing all twenty four participants training, the kind of emotions that run through the pairs of participants from each district, and basically everything leading up to the event before the event itself. There's more depth to The Hunger Games and quite a bit more emotion. It certainly seems as though more is at stake in comparison to Battle Royale.The Hunger Games is really only similar to Battle Royale in the concept of children killing each other and even then it's done in different ways. Battle Royale is more focused on how the students die while The Hunger Games is more focused on introducing you to these characters and how they lived. The Hunger Games is on a grander scale and the result seems to have a bigger impact than that of Battle Royale. There's a bigger emphasis on life and the importance of death rather than the gruesome way that they die. The Hunger Games is completely absorbing. Its nearly two and a half hour runtime seems incredibly daunting at first, but will leave you thinking, ""THAT was two and a half hours?!"" You're sucked in so easily that the time just flies by. There's also this huge sci-fi influence and a bizarre sense of style that can only be described as something along the lines of Total Recall meets The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I'd even go as far to say there are shades of Blade Runner in there at times.The Hunger Games nearly lives up to every ounce of hype it has going for it and is completely satisfying except for the ending. The conclusion and last five minutes of the movie are so wishy-washy and indecisive that it just leaves you with this sense of bewilderment. It felt like the movie was building towards this epic confrontation, but it's yanked away before being thrown at you again and yanked away again all within the span of a couple of minutes. It feels controversial in a way and is obviously a lead in for the sequel. It's something that will be resolved once a sequel is released, but in the meantime feels lackluster for a standalone movie.The Hunger Games is an enthralling adventure that demands your attention its entire duration. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a fantastic and superbly emotional performance as several characters leave lasting impressions (Peeta Mellark, Effie Trinket, Haymitch Abernathy, and Caesar Flickermann just to name a few). Its slow build to the games itself leaves you the chance to digest the emotional journey that every chosen participant must be going through. With its massive cult-like following and overpowering outpour of advance ticket sales, The Hunger Games is bound to be the next big franchise and worldwide box office phenomenon. Bottom line, The Hunger Games is fantastically ""dinnertaining."" That's right.

However, one most realize that the movie is primarily targeted for a young audience and, for this audience; the movie will be a big success. Jennifer Lawrence is strong and convincing in the central role and young women will love her (in fact, a lot of young male viewers will also love her!). My main complaint is the lack of character development for the contestants in the games. The game contestants are given no personality and when they are killed, who cares? It is like inanimate objects being killed. Another aspect of the movie is the shaky camera work. In order to obtain a PG rating, a shaky-cam approach is used for the violent action scenes. This renders the most violent scenes without emotional impact and certainly leaves the movie viewer feeling detached from the action.If you are young, you will love this movie.

1340475,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B003EYVXV4,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 1]","A mega-best selling trilogy by Suzanne Collins has spawned this first installment, The Hunger Games, adapted by Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross for the big screen as a satisfying adventure thriller featuring a terrific performance by budding superstar, Jennifer Lawrence.  The film avoids the pitfalls of previous best-sellers turned into films that lacked a sound structure for the uninitiated readers (as in The Da Vinci Code); it works quite well for newbies.  The filmmakers have kept the main storyline compelling and emotional within the framework of an action film.In the not too distant future, a group of twelve districts has been punished for 74 years for a failed rebellion.  Each year, they must participate in a random lottery or `reaping' of their youth for a lethal competition, a fight to the death with only one winner.  The games are grand, lavish events that are in essence, public executions in the guise of entertainment.  There are specific rules and boundaries except when they suit the whims of the game masters.  Food, weapons, and supplies are made available but not without an accompanying danger, and there are sponsors who can provide life saving assistance and support in timely ways.In one district, Katniss (Lawrence) is a teenage girl who is good with a bow and arrow and dotes after her younger sister, Primrose, and their mother.  She is close to a boy, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who has strong feelings for her.  When Primrose and a boy, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are chosen for reaping, it sets off a surprising series of events including a desperate sacrifice by Katniss as the chosen few must train for their lives in a competition that is televised nationwide.  The contestants are feted like celebrities and are mentored by a former survivor named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) with support from Cinnas (Lenny Kravitz effective in a brief role).  When these modern day gladiators are released into the wild, loyalties are tested and survival instincts take over, and a grand spectacle is replaced by a grim fate that awaits all but one survivor.Director Ross (Seabiscuit) knows how to tell a good story and he is aided immensely by a strong cast that melds newcomers with seasoned veterans like Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.  Special mention goes to Elizabeth Banks as a macabre emcee. Lawrence (Winter's Bone) shines in a physically demanding role, but she never shortchanges her ability to show feelings and angst in a convincing way.  You root for her and feel her pain.  Her portrayal of Katniss has a genuine decency and soul which, despite the savage nature of the games, reveals her humanity for the world to see.  Might her actions and deeds register among the masses and have far reaching consequences?This brave new world of deadly sport (that plays like a perverted version of TV's Survivor), is authentically realized by impressive set designs and costumes which contrast two disparate worlds-a pauper class of citizens and the gaudy elite.  If much of this film's storyline sounds familiar, it draws from pop culture sources as Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery, and films like The Most Dangerous Game, The Truman Show, and The Running Man.  Even elements of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984 come to mind with its oppressed societies and ever watchful video screens, and when cannon fire signals a fallen victim, it echoes moments from Capricorn One.  The sacrificial humans are dubbed `tributes', a contradiction of terms not unlike Orwellian propaganda and its mixed meanings e.g. ""War is Peace"".While The Hunger Games ends in a manner that could be considered a conclusion, it does leave events open to a followup.  Strong, emotional ties that are formed during the games have powerful implications at home, and the outcome sets the stage for the germination of a movement.  I for one am very curious what will happen next.",4,The Bloodsport of THE HUNGER GAMES,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,3947,"['mega-best', 'selling', 'trilogy', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'spawned', 'first', 'installment', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'adapted', 'Collins', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'big', 'screen', 'satisfying', 'adventure', 'thriller', 'featuring', 'terrific', 'performance', 'budding', 'superstar', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'film', 'pitfalls', 'previous', 'best-sellers', 'turned', 'films', 'lacked', 'sound', 'structure', 'uninitiated', 'readers', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'quite', 'well', 'newbies', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'kept', 'main', 'storyline', 'compelling', 'emotional', 'framework', 'action', 'film.In', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'group', 'twelve', 'districts', 'been', 'punished', '74', 'years', 'failed', 'rebellion', 'year', 'must', 'participate', 'random', 'lottery', 'reaping', 'youth', 'lethal', 'competition', 'fight', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'winner', 'games', 'are', 'grand', 'lavish', 'events', 'are', 'essence', 'public', 'executions', 'guise', 'entertainment', 'are', 'specific', 'rules', 'boundaries', 'when', 'suit', 'whims', 'game', 'masters', 'Food', 'weapons', 'supplies', 'are', 'made', 'available', 'not', 'accompanying', 'danger', 'are', 'sponsors', 'who', 'can', 'provide', 'life', 'saving', 'assistance', 'support', 'timely', 'ways.In', 'one', 'district', 'Katniss', 'Lawrence', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'good', 'bow', 'arrow', 'dotes', 'younger', 'sister', 'Primrose', 'mother', 'close', 'boy', 'Gale', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'who', 'strong', 'feelings', 'When', 'Primrose', 'boy', 'Peeta', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'are', 'chosen', 'reaping', 'off', 'surprising', 'series', 'events', 'including', 'desperate', 'sacrifice', 'Katniss', 'chosen', 'few', 'must', 'train', 'lives', 'competition', 'televised', 'nationwide', 'contestants', 'are', 'feted', 'celebrities', 'are', 'mentored', 'former', 'survivor', 'named', 'Haymitch', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'support', 'Cinnas', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'effective', 'brief', 'role', 'When', 'modern', 'day', 'gladiators', 'are', 'released', 'wild', 'loyalties', 'are', 'tested', 'survival', 'instincts', 'take', 'grand', 'spectacle', 'replaced', 'grim', 'fate', 'one', 'survivor.Director', 'Ross', 'Seabiscuit', 'how', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'aided', 'immensely', 'strong', 'cast', 'newcomers', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'Harrelson', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Special', 'mention', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'macabre', 'emcee', 'Lawrence', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'physically', 'demanding', 'role', 'never', 'ability', 'show', 'feelings', 'angst', 'convincing', 'way', 'root', 'feel', 'pain', 'portrayal', 'Katniss', 'genuine', 'decency', 'soul', 'savage', 'nature', 'games', 'humanity', 'world', 'see', 'Might', 'actions', 'deeds', 'register', 'masses', 'have', 'far', 'reaching', 'consequences', 'brave', 'new', 'world', 'deadly', 'sport', 'perverted', 'version', 'TV', 'Survivor', 'authentically', 'realized', 'impressive', 'set', 'designs', 'costumes', 'contrast', 'two', 'disparate', 'worlds-a', 'pauper', 'class', 'citizens', 'gaudy', 'elite', 'much', 'film', 'storyline', 'familiar', 'pop', 'culture', 'sources', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'short', 'story', 'Lottery', 'films', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Running', 'Man', 'Even', 'elements', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'George', 'Orwell', '1984', 'come', 'mind', 'oppressed', 'societies', 'ever', 'watchful', 'video', 'screens', 'when', 'cannon', 'fire', 'fallen', 'victim', 'moments', 'Capricorn', 'One', 'sacrificial', 'humans', 'are', 'dubbed', 'tributes', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'not', 'Orwellian', 'propaganda', 'mixed', 'meanings', 'e.g', 'War', 'Peace', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'manner', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'conclusion', 'leave', 'events', 'open', 'followup', 'Strong', 'emotional', 'ties', 'are', 'formed', 'games', 'have', 'powerful', 'implications', 'home', 'outcome', 'stage', 'germination', 'movement', 'one', 'am', 'very', 'curious', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next']",N/A

But reading the book first is highly recommended.If you take the reality show ""Survivor"" and re-imagine it in ancient Rome, you might get the idea behind ""The Hunger Games"", a televised contest where 24 teenagers compete to be the last one standing. There's one catch, however. They earn that victory by hunting down and murdering the others. The story take place in a futuristic dystopia called Panem where the central authority, ""The Capital"" demands that the twelve formerly rebellious outlying districts send two ""tributes""; kids between ages 12-18, to battle in the Games. All are picked by lottery. Once chosen, they are pampered like modern day reality stars before being sent into the forest with whatever weapons and supplies they can muster.The story focuses on the brave and resourceful Katniss Everdeen (played by the extraordinary Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteers to take the place of her younger sister. The first few scenes are excellent and chilling. Katniss's home, District 12, is an impoverished coal mining backwater that eerily mimics the Appalachian locale of Lawrence's last film, the equally bleak ""Winter's Bone"". The children are chosen at a staged event, called a ""reaping"", at the train station in a vignette that echoes (deliberately, I assume) the Selection Platform processing at Auschwitz.Once at the Capital, the story sags somewhat. This is supposedly where the rich, venal rulers congregate but, adorned as they are with exaggerated costumes and grotesque florescent hair styles, they look more like extras from a Fellini film. They come off as silly, not threatening, especially Stanley Tucci as the unctuous Ryan Seacrest-like MC who is cursed with a blue-tinted pompadour. The entire sequence is meant to mock the celebrity/reality show culture of our present day but it comes off a bit forced. In the book, they look as bizarre but their malevolence is more apparent. The only character who radiates menace is Donald Sutherland's President Snow and he is dressed in plain formal attire.The story picks up again when the youngsters begin to battle although it's unsettling to see children casually slaughtering each other. Katniss is paired with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson in a tender, underplayed role), a boy from her home district and their love story, ruthlessly exploited by the show's controllers, provides the backdrop for what transpires.""The Hunger Games"", the beginning of the trilogy by author Suzanne Collins (who also wrote the screenplay), promises future sequels which will hopefully give more back story to Panem's beginnings and more challenges for the riveting and poignant Katniss Everdeen. These stories are aimed at teenage readers and it is easy to see their appeal. Combining elements of love and heroism, it also plays out every teen's revenge fantasy of getting back at the creeps who ignore them in the cafeteria and bully them in the hallways. A typical American high school is a true Hunger Games survival setting. The only difference is that the bloodletting is emotional, not physical.",4,A Review for the Over-40 Crowd Who Haven't Read the Book.,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,3141,"['DISCLAIMER', 'review', 'up', 'situations', 'movie', 'revealing', 'ending', 'reading', 'book', 'first', 'highly', 'recommended.If', 'take', 'reality', 'show', 'Survivor', 're-imagine', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'might', 'get', 'idea', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'televised', 'contest', 'where', '24', 'teenagers', 'compete', 'be', 'last', 'one', 'standing', 'one', 'catch', 'however', 'earn', 'victory', 'hunting', 'down', 'murdering', 'others', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'futuristic', 'dystopia', 'called', 'Panem', 'where', 'central', 'authority', 'Capital', 'demands', 'twelve', 'formerly', 'rebellious', 'outlying', 'districts', 'send', 'two', 'tributes', 'kids', 'ages', '12-18', 'battle', 'Games', 'are', 'picked', 'lottery', 'Once', 'chosen', 'are', 'pampered', 'modern', 'day', 'reality', 'stars', 'being', 'sent', 'forest', 'weapons', 'supplies', 'can', 'muster.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'brave', 'resourceful', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'played', 'extraordinary', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'take', 'place', 'younger', 'sister', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'chilling', 'Katniss', 'home', 'District', '12', 'impoverished', 'coal', 'mining', 'backwater', 'eerily', 'Appalachian', 'locale', 'Lawrence', 'last', 'film', 'equally', 'bleak', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'children', 'are', 'chosen', 'staged', 'event', 'called', 'reaping', 'train', 'station', 'vignette', 'deliberately', 'assume', 'Selection', 'Platform', 'processing', 'Auschwitz.Once', 'Capital', 'story', 'somewhat', 'supposedly', 'where', 'rich', 'venal', 'rulers', 'congregate', 'adorned', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'costumes', 'grotesque', 'florescent', 'hair', 'styles', 'look', 'more', 'extras', 'Fellini', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'silly', 'not', 'threatening', 'especially', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'unctuous', 'Ryan', 'Seacrest-like', 'MC', 'who', 'cursed', 'blue-tinted', 'pompadour', 'entire', 'sequence', 'meant', 'mock', 'celebrity/reality', 'show', 'culture', 'present', 'day', 'off', 'bit', 'forced', 'book', 'look', 'bizarre', 'malevolence', 'more', 'apparent', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'menace', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'President', 'Snow', 'dressed', 'plain', 'formal', 'attire.The', 'story', 'up', 'again', 'when', 'youngsters', 'begin', 'battle', 'unsettling', 'see', 'children', 'casually', 'slaughtering', 'other', 'Katniss', 'paired', 'Peeta', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'tender', 'underplayed', 'role', 'boy', 'home', 'district', 'love', 'story', 'ruthlessly', 'exploited', 'show', 'controllers', 'backdrop', 'what', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'beginning', 'trilogy', 'author', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'future', 'sequels', 'will', 'hopefully', 'give', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'Panem', 'beginnings', 'more', 'challenges', 'riveting', 'poignant', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'stories', 'are', 'aimed', 'teenage', 'readers', 'easy', 'see', 'appeal', 'Combining', 'elements', 'love', 'heroism', 'also', 'out', 'teen', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'getting', 'back', 'creeps', 'who', 'ignore', 'cafeteria', 'bully', 'hallways', 'typical', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'true', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'survival', 'setting', 'only', 'difference', 'bloodletting', 'emotional', 'not', 'physical']",N/A

What was perplexing to me was its popularity among kids.  Having now seen it some of my questions have been answered but my fears haven't been entirely quelled.  The sight of kids engaging in hand-to-hand combat to the death still turns my stomach but maybe that's the point of the creators of the books and films who would make the reverse argument that this is a metaphor for adult violence.  I think kids also embrace the heroine, Katniss Everdeen, charismatically played by Jennifer Lawrence.  Katniss is not portrayed as a killer but a survivor. This flick reminded me of ""Lord of the Flies"" by way of ""The Running Man"".  Give kids credit, though, for recognizing sophisticated irony and dark humor.  I would have liked this film to have gone more in depth about the futuristic society that stages these games but my guess is that is probably covered in future installments.

When a young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) from a mining district volunteers in order to spare her younger sister (Willow Shields), she and her fellow ""tribute"" from the same district (Josh Hutcherson) play the game as it has never been played before.Lawrence has deservedly received much praise for her portrayal of Katniss, tough as nails yet vulnerable underneath.  The film is a bit too long and lags a bit in the forest scenes when it should really be picking up steam, but ultimately emerges as very entertaining and worthy of sequels.  I have not read the books, so I am looking forward to the next developments for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale (Liam Hemsworth, who will no doubt have more to do in future films).  Director Gary Ross's shaky camerawork drove me crazy in the film's early portions, but thankfully it was only used to heighten the sense of gritty realism in scenes set in Katniss's home district, so it went away once the characters moved to the Capital.  I don't remember whether it returned during the forest combat scenes, which means either that it didn't or that I was too engrossed by the story at that point to notice (entirely possible).If you enjoyed this film, you should check out ""Battle Royale,"" a Japanese movie with nearly the same premise made more than a decade ago.  ""Hunger Games"" has more heart, but its Asian equivalent is leaner, meaner, funnier (in a very dark way), and more wicked as a social satire.

1340511,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B003EYVXV4,David Bower,"[1, 2]","I am one of those who was introduced to the ""Hunger Games Trilogy"" by the movie. I had not read or even heard of the books until I watched the movie. I had heard such a wide range of opinions about the movie that I was very curious to watch it myself and see what all the discussion was about.I rented the movie and watched it for the first time and had somewhat mixed reactions to it; the problem was it wouldn't let go of my mind and I kept thinking about it and decided to watch it again. After the second viewing I was hooked and decided to buy the three books and find out what was going to happen to Katniss and the others.My curiosity having gotten the better of me I started with book 2, ""Catching Fire"" and then followed that up with book 3, ""Mockingjay"" and lastly went back and read book 1, ""The Hunger Games."" Having seen the movie first gave me mental pictures of the characters and eliminated the need to create the characters in my mind's eye from the pages of the books.This may have worked to my advantage as after reading ""The Hunger Games"" I was favorably impressed with the movies handling of the story. I ordered this Blu-ray edition and have now watched it several times and found it an effective telling of the story of book 1.The major thrust of the books and the movie is bravery and determination in the face of a totalitarian dictatorship that uses the Hunger Games as a control device. This future government of Panem, an area now known as North America, uses military force to terrorize and intimidate the majority of the people who are viewed as essentially slaves to the privileged class who enjoy the favor of the dictator and live in ""The Capitol.""After reading ""The Hunger Games"" I was very impressed with the casting for the movie; the actors selected seemed perfect for their roles with subtle nuances of character being brought out in the acting. I'm really glad I saw the movie first.While there are some sadly brutal scenes in the movie those things being represented are all things that have happened in societies both in the past and in the present. The movie does not pull its punches when describing man's inhumanity to man; things we see on the news today and then naively think ""that can never happen here.""It is a warning against allowing any central authority to gain and use power arbitrarily.

On top of leaving out first person narration, most of the dialogue has been changed, some left out even parts of the story was changed.Example Rue, in the book you felt a connection between her and Katniss.

What you are witnessing when you watch the Hunger Games, is what the USA could end up being like if we are not vigilant. I think the eccentric costumes and emphasis on make-up, hair, excessive luxury and fashion make a revealing statement about what we deem important even now and how do we get those things. Don't we even now still buy our clothing made in sweat shops overseas? Notice the poverty of the districts and then the overwhelming glamour of the &#34;Capital&#34; and the gluttony of its inhabitants. Notice also the extent of the cruelty of this &#34;game&#34; which is obviously a sick spin on the Olympics combined with a deliberate political agenda to keep the inhabitants of the outlying districts in fear and submission by forcing them to sacrifice their children annually in this cruel form of revenge for the past uprising. With our nation in 2013 constantly being controlled by the media (and big biz/government that controls them) to fan the flames of racial hatred and gun control as a tool to attempt to provoke its citizens to rise up starting a second civil war so that our government which has long been planning to turn our own military on us would then have an excuse to do so and strip us of all our freedoms to satisfy the agenda of the elite to unite the entire world under one government. That is why the UN is screaming for US citizens to be unarmed. That is why China too is openly demanding we be disarmed. This is why we suddenly see shootings with shady &#34;prior&#34; CIA Dr.s involved in the backgrounds and &#34;treatment&#34; of the shooters who are young people on medications for depression that the drug manufacturers KNOW cause young people to become suicidal and murderous yet their medications and previous treatments are never shown on the news because everyone with a young male in public school who is being drugged just to get through the female biased public schools would pull their kid off it immediately. This is why there are supposedly &#34;mock&#34; emergency drills at each and every disaster location starting with 9/11. We are being herded toward the elite agenda for total world domination. Apparently they aren't rich and powerful enough. Pay close attention to this movie and what is going on right now in our world. Read the books and watch the movies. Research the lies our government tells us all the time. Released government documents despite the editing are beginning to tell the real stories.Look at the information leaked by our military personnel.

The premise- a post apocalyptic America with a  capital city populated by wealthy people and a bunch of territories populated by poor and oppressed who labor to support the capital. For some dumb reason each district sends two kids to a once a year game played to the death, as some sort of penance for the sins of an earlier rebelion against the Capital.

One of the dumbest types of scenes shows kids from different districts working together - happily- to kill other contestants.

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","""The Hunger Games"", the award winning young adult novel by American television writer and novelist Suzanne Collins.Inspired by watching a competition on reality TV and the invasion of Iraq, the Greek myth of Theseus and Roman gladiator games, ""The Hunger Games"" received rave reviews in 2008 by film critics but also criticized for its similarity to Koushun Takami's 1999 novel ""Battle Royale"" and Stephen King's ""The Running Man"" and ""The Long Walk"".But despite its criticism, ""The Hunger Games"" did receive a number of awards and honors in 2008and would go on to receive a film adaptation courtesy of Lions Gate Entertainment and produced by Nina Jacobson's production Company Color Force. The film adaptation was done by Suzanne Collins with help from screenwriter Billy Ray (""Color of Night"", ""State of Play"", ""Flightplan"") and also featured a collaboration with filmmaker Gary Ross (""Big"", ""Pleasantville"", ""Seabiscuit""). Ross would direct the film and would work with cinematographer Tom Stern (""Gran Torino"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Mystic River"") and feature music composed by James Newton Howard (""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Unbreakable"").""The Hunger Games"" would star actress Jennifer Lawrence (""X-Men: First Class"", ""Winter's Bone"", ""Like Crazy""), Josh Hutcherson (""Bridge to Terabithia"", ""The Kids Are All Right"", ""American Splendor""), Woody Harrelson (""No Country for Old Men"", ""Zombieland"", ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Cheers""), Donald Sutherland (""The Italian Job"", ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Ordinary People""), Liam Hemsworth (""Last Song"", ""Knowing"", ""Triangle""), Elizabeth Banks (""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", ""The Next Three Days""), Stanley Tucci (""The Devil Wears Prada"", ""The Terminal"", ""The Lovely Bones""), Wes Bentley (""American Beauty"", ""The Four Feathers"") and rock star Lenny Kravitz (""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"", ""Previous"", ""Bad Boys II"").The film which was budgeted at $78 million would become an enormous success in the box office, earning over $684 million surpassing ""Eclipse"" for the record of first-day advanced ticket sales and became the largest opening weekend for a film not released during the summer or holiday.  The film would receive favorable reviews from film critics, although similar to the novel, would be compared to its similarities with the Japanese film ""Battle Royale"".And now, ""The Hunger Games"" has been released on Blu-ray and DVD.  The 2-disc Blu-ray comes with a digital copy, while the 2-disc DVD also comes with a digital copy and the film will also be available On Demand.VIDEO:""The Hunger Games"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 Widescreen Presentation).  Its important to note that the ""The Hunger Games"" was shot on film and not digitally.  Shot in North Carolina, there was artificial coloring used in order to make Katniss' area seem lush.  But its when the characters leave their district, we see how beautiful this film looks.  From the closeups of the characters, the detail in their costume design and even the use of visual effects throughout the film, the picture quality looked absolutely fantastic.During my viewing, especially in scenes with a lot of red, I saw no banding, I saw no artifacts nor did I see any problematic issues with this film.  ""The Hunger Games"" is crisp, vibrant and looks absolutely amazing on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Hunger Games"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 Dolby Digital Audio Optimized for Late-Night Listening, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio,  I have to say that the 7.1 lossless soundtrack is absolutely immersive.  I was amazed of how sound was utilized, may it be for the sound of a spacecraft flying above, canons being shot, the crowd screaming all around you.  This is an immersive soundtrack in which the surround channels are effectively used, especially LFE.  There is no doubt that audiophiles will enjoy this lossless soundtrack.

I was wrong.I was wrong to not to have interest in this film because of a few saying it was a ""Battle Royale"" knock off.I was wrong not to have watched this film because my wife loved it so much, she wanted to see it again (and this never happens).  She loved it so much, she read all the books and was enthusiastic enough to recommend a movie to me (which rarely happens).But when a movie does so well, receives its praise and also its controversial criticism, I figured that I needed to see what all the hype was all about.  See it for myself and decide.And after watching ""The Hunger Games"", I can tell you right now that I absolutely...loved it!Granted, I'm a sucker for underdog type films.  Humanity being oppressed and someone to stand up and fight back.  We see it so much with male action heroes but here we are with a film with a strong female character.  But most importantly, director Gary Ross was able to transform Suzanne Collins novel to the big screen.From the visual effects and production design, I immediately took notice to see how the children were dressed when they headed out to the lottery.  I took notice of the makeup of Effie Trinket, so different from others with her outlandish costume design but yet separating her from the people of the district.  From seeing how those selected to battle being part of the opening ceremonies to the viciousness of the battles that took place.  The storyline is so effective and you automatically pull for the underdog.And yes, there are similarities to ""Battle Royale"" and even ""The Running Man"", but that's not to say that ""The Hunger Games"" was inspired by these films, as Suzanne Collins was not.  The fact is that we live in a society where reality TV has now become prime time television.  People love to see the underdogs win.  People love to see television taking things up a notch in order to surprise viewers and not succumb to last year and previous year's banal circumstances.""The Hunger Games"" is sleek in style but pays off in character portrayal.  First, let's talk about the visual style.Director Gary Ross was able to take Suzanne Collins but build upon its story through visual effects.  Letting people know that the Capitol is responsible for this faux arena.  They are able to manipulate the games through technology, to effectively communicate with their viewers who are pulling for their district, but also seeing how those in competition must win over sponsors.  The way things were paced and executed was wonderfully done and the costume design, makeup, set design made this sci-fi film believable and effective.But of course, you like any film or video game that can have a flashy presentation, it's characters are important.And that is where ""The Hunger Games"" wins over the viewer through its characters that are children fighting to survive.  Automatically, you get a good feeling of who is going to die.  When you see young kids, with no exceptional skills and are forced to fight but are in fear of being killed against older, much experienced teens, it's heartbreaking.All of these characters are vulnerable, but yet they fight for not themselves but their district, ensuring that their district can be fed for a year.  We see how the Capitol, especially through its President tries to manipulate the system, we see how the people of the districts are powerless and we see how these characters must put on a brave face and essentially market themselves to viewers in order to win over sponsors.Where ""The Running Man"" was more about action and ""Battle Royale"" was more interesting of seeing how many violent ways teens can be killed, ""The Hunger Games"" does feature violence but it's not the primary focus.It was important to have an actress that is not a perfect hero, a character that is vulnerable and this is where actress Jennifer Lawrence shined as Katniss Everdeen.  Yes, she has experience as tracker and a hunter but she is also a young woman who doesn't want to die.  Who wants to live for her family and be back for her sister.  And the way that Lawrence plays Katniss, is so convincing, so pure and just wonderful.  Yes, I am aware of the criticism of how the poor districts have people who must be thin and starving and that should reflect in the casting of its character.  But I've looked at it as her skills of a hunter allowed her and her family to eat.  Not everyone is a skilled hunter, she is.We have her fellow district mate, Peeta Mellark, who has no major fighting skills, aside from working in a bakery and throwing flour and also knowing how to paint himself in order to disguise himself, so he would not be caught.  But then you have this romantic angle, with Peeta who has had a long crush on Katniss.  And part of you is pulling for him to also survive.  Actor Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta has come a long way as a child star and now a teen actor and to see how this actor has grown so much since starring in ""Little Manhattan"" and ""Bridge to Terabithia"".Woody Harrelson was also great in playing the District 12 mentor, Haymitch Abernathy.  Thinking that his kids don't have a chance but then seeing Katniss' resilience and believing in her.  It was an interesting role to see Harrelson play but it turned out pretty good.And there are many more characters that are notable, talent who did a good job playing their characters.  Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley, Amandla Stenberg to name a few.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and the lossless audio was fantastic.  I don't think videophiles or audiophiles have anything to complain about this film.  As for special features, you get a lengthy making of featurette but also plenty of other shorter special features included.  The Blu-ray release comes with two Blu-rays, one for the film and the other for the special features but also a digital copy via Ultraviolet is included.Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" was a film that I didn't want to see because of its comparisons to ""Battle Royale"" but I realized that I was wrong to even think that way.  Not only is the film fantastic but while there are similarities to ""Battle Royale"" and ""The Running Man"", this film is much more effective in how the characters are portrayed.Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing and well-cast for her role as Katniss and I will never understand why one would complain about young Black talents such as Amandla Stenberg playing  Rue or Dayo Okenyi playing Thresh.  It's unimaginable that people complained about it and refuse to see the movie because of it.  Unimaginable but also another lesson that even though society has changed a lot in the last 50 years, ignorance still exists.  While the character of Thresh had a small part in this film, the character of Rue and Amandla Stenberg played this character magnificently and felt the character of Rue and her interaction with Katniss was one of the most important, unforgettable scenes of the film.Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" was a film that was pulse-pounding, exciting and all-out entertaining!  Not only was it an effective sci-fi film but it's been a long while since I watched a new sci-fi film that made me excited for the upcoming sequels and yes, even making me want to read the books.  I enjoyed the film that much!And while I have no doubt that the Blu-ray and DVD release of ""The Hunger Games"" will be an amazing success for Lions Gate Entertainment, I'm also confident in highly recommending this Blu-ray release.  It's a must buy!",5,"(4.5 Stars) The Hunger Games"" was a film that was pulse-pounding, exciting and all-out entertaining!",1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,12908,"['Hunger', 'Games', 'award', 'winning',

Reading the books first will give you insights that a non-reader won't even know they missed.The movie is a tour de force.

Not once when a tribute dies, do you cheer his or her demise. We do not even root for our heroine Katniss to win. We simply see the tributes for what they all are: pawns in the sick, twisted game that the Capitol forces upon them. Even when the tributes themselves do not realize that they are pawns, we do.Donald Sutherland asked for the role of President Snow because he considered the message of this film to be just that important to the young people in America today.

I agree that the book is much more detailed than the movie. It spends a lot of time explaining the past and goes into more detail during the games itself. I also agree that reading the book first will make the movie more understandable; however to cover all that detail in the movie would make it about 6 or more hours long. The movie follows the book with very few exceptions. The biggest one being how Katniss gets the mockingjay pin but it doesn't affect the story line at all.

Excellent cinematography, costume design, and soundtrack along with a very unique storyline help to create a really memorable screen experience. The acting-in-general is contrived and overly perfecto, and there are definitely a few holes and cop-outs in the plot. Yet, THE HUNGER GAMES is so one-of-a-kind that its flaws, some of which might be ruinous in a lesser film, are quite forgiveable.All the same, there are ways that THE HUNGER GAMES might have been better; e.g., it would have been nice to see more virtually created creature phenomena such as  the were-pitbulls (or whatever they are)toward the end. Another thing: Considering the brutality of the premise, what actually happens during the ""game"" is fairly tame. Having said that, I'm not sure how it would have worked better--It certainly would NOT have been enhanced by creating a horrific ""It's either me or you"" gore-fest. It often descends into sentimental, politically correct, teeny-bopperish romance, but just when things start to get too maudlin, new things come up.I am sure that this film does not do complete justice to the book trilogy, which I have not read but am now very eager to read.

That, after all, has become the quickest and surest avenue to success for today's would-be auteurs.  But I am going to give it a pass on that shady aspect, if for no other reason that I enjoyed it more than the Harry Potter films and I found the Twilight series to be pure rubbish.  So, in spite of the wholly gratuitous plot and script, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, finding it entertaining and, for the most part, well acted and directed.  I confess that as the movie began I kept thinking how ridiculous a concept that a modern society would slaughter it's best and brightest young people for politics and entertainment.  In Ancient Rome, yes, or the Mayans, but not today(sic).

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 4]","Every year, twenty-four teenage ""tributes"" are brought to the Capitol of Panem, and sent out into the arena to kill each other on live TV. Only one will survive.This chilling premise is at the center of ""The Hunter Games,"" a brilliant, powerful movie adapted from the first book of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy. It's a slow-burning thriller twined with some barbed satire (reality TV!) and an oppressive government -- but at heart, it's an uplifting story about a young woman fighting to be free.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the impoverished District 12, hunting food to provide for her mother and her beloved little sister Prim (Willow Shields). But on the day of the reaping, Prim is selected. And Katniss does something no one else has done -- she volunteers to go instead. Along with the male tribute, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), she is swept away to the Capitol.Once there, the tributes are pampered, tutored, styled and turned into celebrities -- until they're released into the arena, and start killing each other to survive. Katniss must evade murderous gangs, traps, and genetically engineered beasts.But because Peeta publicly declared his love for Katniss, the audience has taken a shine to the impoverished young ""lovers"" and are rooting for them to triumph. But if both Katniss and Peeta are to survive, they must learn how to play the game that the gamemakers and polticians are playing -- and use the Hunger Games against them.I'm not sure why so many people compare ""The Hunger Games"" to the Twilight movies, because it literally has everything that ""Twilight"" does not. It has plenty of action, adventure, a subtle romance, and some barbed social commentary -- and it has a raw, passionate quality that easily matches its strong-willed heroine.The movie also shows us what a rotten place Panem is, whether it's the sleek, colorful superficiality of the Capitol or the faded squalor of District 12. But ""Hunger Games"" is at its best when it's in the forests of the arena -- there's a primal, wild quality to Katniss' adventures there, tempered with tenderer moments (such as when she cares for the gravely wounded Peeta).The romance with Peeta is also refreshingly uncliched, leaving the audience unsure of how much of their love was for the audience's benefit (although we glimpse some flickers of real love between them). The biggest problems are that a lot of the violence seems rather toned down, and the shakycam becomes rather annoying at times.But Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job bringing Katniss to life, imbuing her with strength, fear, brains and a fiery temper -- exactly what the ""girl on fire"" needs to have. Josh Hutcherson is equally good as Peeta, and there are a string of great performances by Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and Amandla Stenberg. There's a lot of passion in even the minor actors' performances.""The Hunger Games"" successfully mingles dystopian sci-fi, romance and a tale of rebellion, giving us a brilliantly raw, passionate movie.

1340637,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B003EYVXV4,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga'sThe Burning Plain(2008), Drake Doremus'sLike Crazy(2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik'sWinter's Bone(2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of theX-Men: First Classin the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in ""Winter's Bone"" that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, ""Survivor""-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two ""tributes"" from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' (Seabiscuit) surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray (Shattered Glass); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district ""tribute"" at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the ""tributes"", they are groomed and trained in a style akin to ""American Idol"". This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underratedThe Truman Show. However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the ""tributes"" meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the handheld camerawork by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.Josh Hutcherson (The Kids Are All Right) doesn't make as vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the ""tributes"", Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films likeThe Running Manand even ancient relics likeThe Most Dangerous Game. It's a pretty effective start to the trilogy.",4,Survivalist Adventure with Satirical Reality TV Sensibilities Benefits from Lawrence's Star Turn,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,4983,"['indie-film',

The whole idea of the games, the inevitability, the ruthlessness, the horror, comes through in a way that creates a pervading sense of dread.

1340642,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003EYVXV4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 142 minutes including 12 minutes of credits) is a fine rip-off of Shirley Jackson's 1948 short story ""The Lottery"" (The Lottery and Other Stories), combined with the basic premises ofThe Running Man,The Truman Showand1984 [HD] to keep it from being too boring for today's video-game/music-video audience.Realizing this is based on a series of books, I'll say upfront I do not like silly, derivative versions of stories that are known to me from childhood. That is, unless they are very very good - which HUNGER GAMES is not. My feeling is the author of the original novels has so many influences occurring in her mind without even realizing it.All I can say is get this at your own risk. I'm going to add my playing of the Puritan card and offer three words to you: ""kids killing kids"". There. Top that. Oh, I know: you could argue they made this because actors have to eat and pay bills too. What I despise is the torture and murder of kids for the sake of box office bucks. Call me old fashioned that way - but I'll bet the victims from Connecticut, Oregon, Colorado and Pennsylvania will agree with me.In a deservedly nameless, future dystopic totalitarian society ruled by an evil president (Donald Sutherland), 2 kids from each of the 12 Districts, a boy and a girl, are chosen in a lottery to be sacrificed in The Hunger Games (which is apparently all these people watch on their version of television).These sacrifices, called ""Tributes"", apparently keep war and bad luck away - but we see clearly that it is mind numbing propaganda TV that fuels the Games. So there, I suppose, is the potshot at TV, the Olympics, the media and the way politicians control us through those means. Or as they said of Rome, ""bread and circuses"".From the farming district, District 12, are selected Katniss (a lovely and talented Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson, my latest insane crush). While Katniss is a strong-willed, kick-ass hunter, Peeta is just a strong, hardworking farm boy. After this deceptively interesting beginning, the kids are transported to the nameless big capital, and during the trip they are introduced to their ""mentor"" (Woody Harrelson) who fortunately takes a shine to both kids.The 26 kids are all dropped in some weird, unexplained sort of Star Trek-style holodeck (the ""arena"") where they have to duke it out for survival. This gives away the real mental range of the stories, since this is really no more than a very expensive ""Survival"" episode set in a Star Trek holodeck.After instruction from their mentor and a goofyThe Wizard of Ozintroduction to the 'TV capital', after impressing enough sponsors to ensure them a good chance (thereby prostituting themselves for good measure), the kids are whisked off to fight it out. If I ever see a film that does not take something from OZ, I think I'll send the producers a box of my favorite cigars.Since the kids are all ""offerings"" (""Tributes"") anyway I was none too interested in what happened to them. However, I am aware that the public outcry against this stupid thing was quite loud: children killing children, yeah, great, just what this world needs. I suspect that was the actual point of this ridiculous, pretentious story but I have to admit that the film wasn't preachy at all.Once a kid got killed, that was pretty much it - that is the way this holodeck world is. The obvious attempt at shock value stales immediately. One wonders what could possibly be the point of any sequel to this. To see the ""end""? Man, I've already seen the end! I saw it in the late 1960s, the start of the 1970s and am seeing it again right now, on the news. It's all we ever see. I need no smart-alecky film to tell me that fact.There never is any honest chemistry from or between Hutcherson and Lawrence; I suspect that is also intentional but it might have saved this a little. I keep waiting anxiously to see Hutcherson catapult into some greater roles, do at least one gay character which God created him to do, so I was happy as long as I could see him onscreen.Not having read the novels, I suspected Peeta, Hutcherson's character, was gay. There is a rapidly passing scene when Peeta is in with a small group and the alpha-boy calls Peeta something like ""sweetie"" or ""babycakes""--whatever it was, it was not subtle and it was not cute. Hutcherson has slyly hinted at Peeta's homosexuality, but then Hutcherson also teases audiences about his own probable homosexuality. Frankly it just adds to the ugliness of this story's concept.Lawrence is hypnotic with her sweet grace and beauty - like Hutcherson - and I think this will carry her on to a stellar career just as I know it will make her the major star of the upcoming sequels. Hutcherson is already embarked on his, which gladdens me.With the (wasted) talents of Donald Sutherland, Toby Jones, Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, and a stunning-as-always Lenny Kravitz.",2,"An

1340643,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B003EYVXV4,Ehkzu,"[0, 0]","I could name a hundred films I'd rather discuss with teenagers. But those aren't films most teenagers would freely choose to watch. This is. At least where female teens and tweens are concerned. And smart teen males will want to be knowledgeable about the films girls like to see if they're eager to make friends with girls. Dragging dates to Fast & Furious XXXV will not do the trick unless you're dating Danica Patrick...Hunger Games is good discussion fodder because it's very, very popular; it's part of a trilogy of books and a coming tetralogy of films; and it has enough good points to build on (along with bad points to deal with).How you approach it depends on the teen, of course. There are people who respond to any attempt at discussion with idiocies like ""Why do you have to analyze everything? Why can't you just enjoy it?"" People who say this may not be stupid (though that is a distinct possibility). They may be intellectually insecure or lazy, and trying to conceal this in an application of ""offense is the best defense."" If the kid is young enough you can make a post-discussion a precondition for letting them see ""Hunger Games."" If they're older...well, you may just have a dud on your hands. Sorry about that.I do know people who consider any discussion of works of art a waste of time because they think the purpose of most art is frivolous--killing time, frothy entertainment. This can be worked with, though it's still hard. But let's get back to ""Hunger Games"" in particular.Since I'm talking about talking about this film, now I'm going to include spoilers freely. Don't go on until you've seen it unless you don't care. Forewarned...There are two equally valid ways to talk about a movie like ""Hunger Games:"" as a film, and as philosophy--that is, as a reflection on life.As a film, ""Hunger Games"" is an example of how you can tackle turning a book into a film--and in particular how you can make a film that coheres as a movie while at the same time leading to more films in the series (every TV series faces this challenge).Practically speaking, a film can't be any longer than ""Hunger Games"" is. So what does your teen think of the choices the film makes in what to include from the book and what to leave out? If your teen thinks something left out should have been left in--such as, say, Rue's developing relationship with Catniss during the training period--what should be left out in order to make room for that?Then, considering what is the same in book and movie, what about the fact that Catniss winds up not having to kill anyone we like, or anyone defenseless whether we like them or not? She does have to make a tough decision when it comes to, in effect, being ordered to kill Peeta. But that's it. This is an example of a plot designed to look tough that actually is not so tough. What if she'd had to choose between killing Rue or Peeta? It could have easily worked out that way.Ask your teen what she would have done at each crucial decision point in Catniss's story. You can also see whether she caught the fact that Catniss doesn't love Peeta? She likes him, she's grateful to him for his acts of kindness earlier in their lives. But gratitude ain't love.Also, it seems like Catniss hadn't been teaching Primrose how to hunt. Why not? Would your teen have made that choice? If your teen had been in Primrose's position, would she have asked Catniss to teach her? [I'm only talking about the movie here.]Taking a step back, is this future society plausible? For example, if the Capitol City denizens are so decadent, who are the highly disciplined military/police forces? They aren't lounging around decadently. The Roman Empire wound up hiring ""barbarians"" for their military--who wound up taking over eventually. A college-bound teen might want to explore this to see what are the parallels between real empires like the Roman one and the world of Hunger Games.And what about the scientists, engineers and technicians needed to maintain a very, very advanced technological infrastructure? That all takes discipline and hard work, not dilettantish decadence. Where are these people?And, like, what are those killer dogs made of? CGI can't bite people. That's tech way beyond anything we can imagine.A lot of teens, fed on a rich diet of CGI-stuffed scifi/action movies, may not realize what's science and what's fiction. Your teen should realize that those lethal out-of-thin-air dogs represented tech waaay beyond most other stuff in the film. That doesn't make it invalid to use; but you should realize the difference, and so should your teen.Which brings us to using Hunger Games to help your teen learn about the art of movies. You can talk about casting, screenwriting, cinematography, lighting, sound, music, editing, CGI, direction, mise en scene--even to technical details like scene transitions (cuts, wipes, fade out/fade in). And you can talk about the Fourth Wall (that divides the audience from the ""stage""). About POV (Point of View). Does Hunger Games ever break the Fourth Wall, intentionally or otherwise (it's intentional when the actor turns to the audience and addresses them directly; it's unintentional when the shadow of a boom mike drifts into view). What's Hunger Games' POV? Are we seeing everything through Catniss's eyes? (we aren't--but where and when are we not, and is that a good idea here?).What about the last fight on top of the Cornocopia, when the Evil Boy makes a little existential speech about knowing he's dying, regretting the fact that his whole life has been about training to be a killer, but thinking he might as well kill once more? Why did the screenwriter include that little speech? Why? Did it complicate things for Catniss, who has trouble killing anyway? Does it tell us more about this society? Does it make the Evil Boy a little sympathetic, and is that a good thing?Look at the credits at the end with your teen. See if she knows what the different jobs are. Look up the ones you don't recognize on Wikipedia or suchlike. Who's a Best Boy? A Key Grip? A Second Unit director? See what locations were used.Some say casting is 80% of a movie. What would the film have been like if they'd used someone besides Jennifer Lawrence as Catniss? I heard Chloe Grace Moretz wanted the part. Would she have been too young? She's one of the most athletic young female stars in Hollywood, though of course Lawrence is no slouch. But she's also, like, half a foot shorter. Would that have made a difference?It's not like Hunger Games is a towering masterpiece of a movie. It isn't terrible either, though. And assuming it's one of your teen's favorite movies, you can use it as a gateway to thinking about society, real world morality, the future, and filmmaking.",3,The perfect film to discuss with your

1340648,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B003EYVXV4,ElectricMelody,"[3, 7]","I first read The Hunger Games two years ago and adored it -- thought it would make a good movie, in fact. Flash forward and here we are, with a monster hit adaptation. I won't go into the story or the characters, since if you're reading this you're probably already familiar. I had my doubts about some of the casting (mainly Peeta and Gale), but I'm happy to say that, though it doesn't touch the Harry Potter series, this is one young adult lit adaptation that doesn't suck.Filmed primarily with a naturalistic eye, and led by the incredibly effective Jennifer Lawrence, the movie deposits us immediately into the impoverished, rural setting of District 12. This is a science fiction future that, barring a few of the more outlandish flourishes, feels startlingly real. I'd put that down to the genuine emotion in every frame, and the decision to forego massive CGI overkill in favor of grit and texture.Of course, it's not all trees and dirt. The decadent Capital is well-rendered, despite being populated by a cast that looks like transplants from a Lady Gaga tribute act (which I guess was probably somewhat intentional). The film, like the book, pauses here for awhile before getting to the nonstop action of the Arena. This was one of my favorite sequences in the book--a barbed skewering of reality television and the entertainment industry. It doesn't register quite as powerfully on screen, but the film still hits all the right notes.Then we're whisked off to the Arena, where the action really kicks in. Those tense minutes as the Tributes are being released into the game are some of the most harrowing moments on film in the last few years. The stakes are high--about as high and personal as they get. The violence is never gratuitous but always unsettling. It's one thing reading about kids killing kids, and quite another seeing it on screen. It's brutal, but effectively so. From this point until the end of the movie, it's nearly constant suspense. The ""cave scene"" with Katniss and Peeta, my least favorite in the book, has thankfully been shortened for the film.At nearly two and a half hours, The Hunger Games is the rare epic-length film that flies by. It's relentlessly paced, taut in both story and character, and just as shocking as it needs to be. Now, it'll be interesting to see what they do with the next two books--especially since this first one is widely considered to be the best.

1340663,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,B003EYVXV4,Endless Kitchen,"[1, 1]","Originally published in 2008, Suzanne Collins' novel ""The Hunger Games"" became wildly popular as did its two sequels.  Luckily for movie goers, the film adaptation was not treated as a potboiler quickie and we are treated with a fantastical and well-made adventure rather than a loud, dumb and forgettable blockbuster. For those unfamiliar with the books, the story follows a place called Panem, which is a hellish empire in the future of what is now the U.S.A. where the patrician oligarchs in the wealthy city of Capitol live in fancy and lavish lifestyles and the masses in the twelve districts live in squalor. This dictatorship features an annual ritual of sacrifice in which twenty four tributes (teenagers volun-told by a lottery system) compete in a sadistic competition called The Hunger Games; a gladiator styled battle royale which is treated like the Olympics by the media and Capitol residents, despite its brutal nature. One year, a woman named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in the Appalachian and poorest district, District 12, finds herself shipped off to the Capitol to prepare for competition in the Hunger Games along with fellow denizen Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). They meet the eccentrically dressed escort Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and sympathetic stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). This trio helps them and the other tributes prepare for the mandatory pageantry and talk shows they must participate in before the Hunger Games begin. Once the tributes arrive at the arena and the competition begins, a bloodbath takes place at the starting place and the survivors run off for cover. Can Katniss survive the Hunger Games?This film is not a crisp and perfect adaption of the novel but I think it is faithful to the core and spirit of the story. Readers hoping to see the novel verbatim will be disappointed as the film cuts out a lot in the beginning including Haymitch's hangover at the Reaping and Katniss' relationships with other people in District 12 (her connections with her family and Gale are shown a bit). Katniss' and Peeta's drama to lure in sponsors is here, although some of it is abbreviated. To be frank, the film would be close to ten hours if everything were adapted, so this abridging is understandable. The great thing about this film is that it could be enjoyed by someone who has not read the novel; it is sharp and self-contained. The third-person rather than first-person POV allows viewers to see more of Panem and characters such as the antagonist, President Snow. Donald Sutherland is perfect as the Blofeld-like Snow and the extra scenes of him provide a few insights into the ideology and feelings of the Panem rulers as the competition continues. Characters like Cato, a buff and towering tribute from a district where youngsters are fed and bred to be fighters ala ancient Sparta, are given new and improved spins as he has some sympathetic moments.People compare The Hunger Games to the novel and film Battle Royale and, while they have some similarities, they are both examples of a long standing sub-genre dating back decades such as ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and centuries including mythological examples like tributes sent to fight the Minotaur and historical examples of forced mercenaries and glorified bloodshed such as the days of bread and circuses (or  panem et circenses). Nothing against the novel, the film, Koushun Takami or the late-great filmmaker Kinji Fukasaku, but this is not a ripoff or plagiarism.The film is well shot with great sets and costumes with the best examples being the contrasting fancy and colorful Capitol with decadence and showmanship in everyone and everything and the destitute districts who wear shabby clothes one might find a century ago in slums. The violence is brutal at times but it is often tastefully limited with reaction shots and off-screen terrors. The special effects for the fantastic science fiction of Panem such as the train ride in or the elaborate pageantry are magnificent but the muttations leave something to be desired. The acting makes the film as Jennifer Lawrence combines toughness and pure beauty in her role of a heroine stuck in a political game of theater, battle and death. Katniss is strong, pragmatic and stoic but there are subtle hints in Lawrence's performance that allow you to follow her experience despite the lack of narration or first-person viewpoint. Her character's country survivalist life harks back to her unforgettable performance in Winter's Bone. Harrelson's stumbling but frank Haymitch is a perfect incarnation of the novel's character, even if his screen time is cut short. Amandla Stenberg portrays Rue, the youngest and most adorable tribute, who bonds with Katniss and plays a special role in the competition. Stanley Tucci provides some humor as the over-the-top television presenter,  Ceaser Flickerman.The Hunger Games touches upon a lot of political and social themes as well as tropes and story telling arches we have seen before. While the book nor the film areNineteen Eighty-Four, the characters, their relationships and the work of filmmakers and actors to bring this science fiction to the silver screen make this a great addition to dystopic film. The Hunger Games has excitement, intelligence and a few surprises; all in all, a very enjoyable and entertaining film.",5,Great adaption of Collins' book,1347062400,"09 8,

When her young sister's name is drawn, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) volunteers in her place. Teaming with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), Katniss' hunting skills with bow and arrow--along with their budding relationship--capture the imagination of the viewing public, who wind up rooting for these two &#34;lovers&#34; from district twelve.

After several attempts, Lionsgate came out on top with this summer's highly successful ""The Hunger Games."" Obsessed fans can now watch their favorite characters battle it out with each other anytime they want thanks to the release of the movie on Blu-ray and DVD.For those who live under a rock, the Hunger Games are an annual event that pit children from different districts against each other in a battle to the death. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Evergreen must rely on her training and archery skills to survive and return to her family. Her feelings for another competitor in the deadly Games complicate matters.Everything about this movie is thought-provoking. It also contains layers of social commentary which add to its allure for teens and adults alike. Is it violent and controversial? Of course it is. It wouldn't be as wildly popular as it is if it wasn't.Director Gary Ross does a wonderful job of capturing the animalistic nature and tragedy of the Games in a faux-shaky cam way that makes viewers feel like they're in the thick of the action. However, it doesn't cause you to want to blow chunks at the screen like ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""The Last Exorcism"" do.The high definition transfer of ""The Hunger Games"" is fabulous. The picture looks phenomenal and captures every color and image put forth. It's a visual feast for the eyes with all the nature shots and CG city scenes. The dynamic 7.1 surround sound mix guarantees that viewers won't miss one single tiny noise, piece of dialogue, or tree rustling in the forest.Consumers and fans will be pleased with all the special features contained in the release. There's a two-hour documentary entitled ""The World is Watching: Making 'The Hunger Games'"" which includes interviews with the cast, crew, and author Suzanne Collins.Five featurettes with varying lengths are found as well. They're ""Game Maker: Suzanne Collins and 'The Hunger Games' Phenomenon,"" ""Letters from the Rose Garden,"" ""Controlling the Games,"" ""A Conversation with Gary Ross and Elvis Mitchell,"" and ""Preparing for the Games: A Director's Process."" Each one features interviews and conversations with Donald Sutherland, director Gary Ross, and film critic Elvis Mitchell.The complete ""Propaganda Film"" which we see segments from in the movie is presented as well. A marketing archive with posters, trailers, and a photo gallery are here, too.The 2-Disc Blu-ray + Digital Copy Edition of ""The Hunger Games"" will please enthusiasts of the film and books. We get a great high-definition transfer of the movie and a satisfying amount of special features to give everyone insight into the making of this excellent movie. If you're looking for an entertaining yet mentally stimulating movie for teens and their parents alike, this will hit the spot and encourage them to discuss the themes explored in the film.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Hunger Games""",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,2989,"['end', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'saga', 'Twilight', 'series', 'wrap', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'ripe', 'new', 'movie', 'franchise', 'take', 'place', 'several', 'attempts', 'Lionsgate', 'came', 'out', 'top', 'summer', 'highly', 'successful', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Obsessed', 'fans', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'favorite', 'characters', 'battle', 'out', 'other', 'anytime', 'want', 'thanks', 'release', 'movie', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD.For', 'who', 'live', 'rock', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'annual', 'event', 'children', 'different', 'districts', 'other', 'battle', 'death', 'Sixteen-year-old', 'Katniss', 'Evergreen', 'must', 'rely', 'training', 'archery', 'skills', 'survive', 'return', 'family', 'feelings', 'competitor', 'deadly', 'Games', 'complicate', 'matters.Everything', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'also', 'layers', 'social', 'commentary', 'allure', 'teens', 'adults', 'alike', 'violent', 'controversial', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'wildly', 'popular', ""wasn't.Director"", 'Gary', 'Ross', 'wonderful', 'job', 'capturing', 'animalistic', 'nature', 'tragedy', 'Games', 'faux-shaky', 'cam', 'way', 'viewers', 'feel', ""'re"", 'thick', 'action', 'However', ""n't"", 'cause', 'want', 'blow', 'chunks', 'screen', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'do.The', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'fabulous', 'picture', 'phenomenal', 'color', 'image', 'put', 'forth', 'visual', 'feast', 'eyes', 'nature', 'shots', 'CG', 'city', 'scenes', 'dynamic', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'guarantees', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'single', 'tiny', 'noise', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'tree', 'rustling', 'forest.Consumers', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'special', 'features', 'contained', 'release', 'two-hour', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'World', 'Watching', 'Making', ""'The"", 'Hunger', 'Games', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'author', 'Suzanne', 'Collins.Five', 'varying', 'lengths', 'are', 'found', 'well', ""'re"", 'Game', 'Maker', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', ""'The"", 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Phenomenon', 'Letters', 'Rose', 'Garden', 'Controlling', 'Games', 'Conversation', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'Elvis', 'Mitchell', 'Preparing', 'Games', 'Director', 'Process', 'one', 'interviews', 'conversations', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'film', 'critic', 'Elvis', 'Mitchell.The', 'complete', 'Propaganda', 'Film', 'see', 'segments', 'movie', 'presented', 'as', 'well', 'marketing', 'archive', 'posters', 'trailers', 'photo', 'gallery', 'are', 'here', 'too.The', '2-Disc', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'Edition', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'will', 'please', 'enthusiasts', 'film', 'books', 'get', 'great', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'amount', 'special', 'features', 'give', 'everyone', 'insight', 'making', 'excellent', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'mentally', 'stimulating', 'movie', 'teens', 'parents', 'alike', 'will', 'hit', 'spot', 'encourage', 'discuss', 'themes', 'explored', 'film']",N/A

The novel, on which the film is based, was the kind of phenomenon of the level of Harry Potter and Twilight that would bring in a built in audience. But with the kind of fan devotion that the novel has, the movie also was tasked with meeting the high expectations of those who enjoyed the book.I'll admit, I was a bit hesitant to explore the whole Hunger Games craze. While I usually enjoy thrillers and adult literature, the novel had enough buzz to warrant my attention. I devoured the book in a day, and was convinced that there was definitely something to the story that I wouldn't mind seeing on film.The movie itself does an efficient, if not inspired, job of translating the novel to the screen. Jennifer Lawrence is the undeniable star as the strong willed Katniss. In the film, Katniss takes the place of her younger sister in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death between male and female tributes from each of the 12 districts of the dystopian world. Because of the limitations of the medium, we aren't given as much character development as the novel provided, but the actors do a fine job at trying to make each character fit into the world.In the novel, there was a subtle hint of political restlessness that gets mostly hidden by the big spectacle of the film. To be fair, there are a few moments where the filmmakers excel at providing deeper emotional insight, particularly during the death of one of the tributes. Unfortunately, the constraints of the film force the plot to move so quickly that most of these subtle moments get blown over.Overall, this a a perfectly fine adaptation of an above average novel. There were no egregious departures from the source material, so fans of the novels should be satisfied. Like the book, the ending is conclusive while still setting the foundation for the continuation of the story. If you haven't read the books or seen the movies, they are definitely worth the few hours they will take for you to experience them. Having experienced the novels and this first movie, I can understand the hype that surrounds the series, and look forward to seeing the adaptation of the second novel, Catching Fire, later this year.",4,An Efficient Adaptation,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,2276,"['Hunger', 'Games', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'moment', 'film', 'began', 'production', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'was', 'kind', 'phenomenon', 'level', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Twilight', 'would', 'bring', 'built', 'audience', 'kind', 'fan', 'devotion', 'novel', 'movie', 'also', 'was', 'tasked', 'meeting', 'high', 'expectations', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'book.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'explore', 'whole', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'craze', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'thrillers', 'adult', 'literature', 'novel', 'had', 'enough', 'buzz', 'warrant', 'attention', 'devoured', 'book', 'day', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'definitely', 'something', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'film.The', 'movie', 'efficient', 'not', 'inspired', 'job', 'translating', 'novel', 'screen', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'undeniable', 'star', 'strong', 'willed', 'Katniss', 'film', 'Katniss', 'place', 'younger', 'sister', 'annual', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'fight', 'death', 'male', 'female', 'tributes', '12', 'districts', 'dystopian', 'world', 'limitations', 'medium', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'novel', 'provided', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'trying', 'make', 'character', 'fit', 'world.In', 'novel', 'was', 'subtle', 'hint', 'political', 'restlessness', 'mostly', 'hidden', 'big', 'spectacle', 'film', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'excel', 'providing', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'insight', 'particularly', 'death', 'one', 'tributes', 'Unfortunately', 'constraints', 'film', 'force', 'plot', 'move', 'so', 'quickly', 'most', 'subtle', 'moments', 'get', 'blown', 'over.Overall', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'above', 'average', 'novel', 'were', 'egregious', 'departures', 'source', 'material', 'fans', 'novels', 'should', 'be', 'satisfied', 'book', 'ending', 'conclusive', 'still', 'setting', 'foundation', 'continuation', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'seen', 'movies', 'are', 'definitely', 'few', 'hours', 'will', 'take', 'experience', 'Having', 'experienced', 'novels', 'first', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'hype', 'series', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'adaptation', 'second', 'novel', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'later', 'year']",N/A

Everyone in the downtrodden districts hates the Hunger Games, and yet they are proud of the winners. (It was awfully hard to cheer the two finalists on. I really wanted them to die and make a point.) And, if the districts are so downtrodden, so hungry, how can they afford to have bakeries? Frosted cakes? And, if the rulers are so advanced, why don't they just buy off the downtrodden, exploited people they rule? Wouldn't it be easier to simply give them food and nice houses and a bath along with their TVs? Nobody would rebel against that. (We certainly haven't.)But, I am getting ahead of myself.

The film lives up to the hype. It is clear that those responsible for producing and making the film come to life wanted to keep the spirit of the book intact, and they accomplish this. With The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins as one of the screen play writers and director Gary Ross as producer, they are able to keep the novel's vision of a disturbing and backwards society. The film works so well because it demonstrates what an Orwellian, futuristic, dystopian world would look like amid these mindless traditions like the Hunger Games, run by corrupted higher ups. It's a society and world where one must always look over their shoulder; no one is safe. The Games, projected onto society by the means of media and overblown television coverage, create a norm of desensitization to violence. Much like the book was a commentary and criticism of overblown reality television and sensationalism of media, the film follows a similar route, showing the brutality of war, a fight to the death with children as its main celebrities.The film was also terrific from the standpoint of character casting. Jennifer Lawrence really steals the show, and is a perfect fit for Katniss Everdeen. She captures Katniss' personality so well. She is stuck between concern for family and friends close to her in District 12 and being forced to survive the Games. She's presented as a sympathetic character who is emotionally drained from the reality of war, but tries to stay mentally strong. I also thought that Josh Hutcherson did an exceptional job as Peeta.The subtleties and other nuances are also presented effectively in the film. The build up and circus-like atmosphere leading up to the Games are handled perfectly. The mockingjay is introduced as a symbol that will comes into prominence later. There is a perfect blend of foreboding and surrealism both before and during the Games. Clearly, attention to detail was a high priority.Over all, this is a fine adaptation to The Hunger Games, and hopefully Catching Fire will be as good. The quality of the DVD is also superb. Extras in the two discs include a ""Making The Hunger Games"" documentary as well as conversation with director Gary Ross.Definitely recommended for anyone who loves the book, or is a fan of dystopian-based films.",5,"Awesome, completely lived up to the book",1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,2436,"['may', 'odds', 'be', 'ever', 'favor', 'big', 'following', 'lot', 'hype', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'anticipated', '2012', 'film', 'up', 'hype', 'clear', 'responsible', 'producing', 'making', 'film', 'come', 'life', 'wanted', 'keep', 'spirit', 'book', 'intact', 'accomplish', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'author', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'one', 'screen', 'play', 'writers', 'director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'producer', 'are', 'able', 'keep', 'novel', 'vision', 'disturbing', 'backwards', 'society', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'what', 'Orwellian', 'futuristic', 'dystopian', 'world', 'would', 'look', 'mindless', 'traditions', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'run', 'corrupted', 'higher', 'ups', 'society', 'world', 'where', 'one', 'must', 'always', 'look', 'over', 'shoulder', 'one', 'safe', 'Games', 'projected', 'society', 'means', 'media', 'overblown', 'television', 'coverage', 'create', 'norm', 'desensitization', 'violence', 'Much', 'book', 'was', 'commentary', 'criticism', 'overblown', 'reality', 'television', 'sensationalism', 'media', 'film', 'similar', 'route', 'showing', 'brutality', 'war', 'fight', 'death', 'children', 'main', 'celebrities.The', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'terrific', 'standpoint', 'character', 'casting', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'really', 'show', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'Katniss', 'personality', 'so', 'well', 'stuck', 'concern', 'family', 'friends', 'close', 'District', '12', 'being', 'forced', 'survive', 'Games', 'presented', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'reality', 'war', 'stay', 'mentally', 'strong', 'also', 'thought', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'did', 'exceptional', 'job', 'Peeta.The', 'subtleties', 'other', 'nuances', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'effectively', 'film', 'build', 'up', 'circus-like', 'atmosphere', 'leading', 'up', 'Games', 'are', 'handled', 'perfectly', 'mockingjay', 'introduced', 'symbol', 'will', 'prominence', 'later', 'perfect', 'blend', 'foreboding', 'surrealism', 'Games', 'Clearly', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'high', 'priority.Over', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'hopefully', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'quality', 'DVD', 'also', 'superb', 'Extras', 'two', 'discs', 'include', 'Making', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', 'conversation', 'director', 'Gary', 'Ross.Definitely', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'book', 'fan', 'dystopian-based', 'films']",N/A

These stories could have been so much more than they were.  In his film version of &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;, director Gary Ross seemed to grasp the potential, and do his utmost to fulfill what he could of it.Ross took material that never rises beyond a teen-girl fantasy vehicle (with the standard, &#34;oh no, two boys like me, whatever shall I do,&#34; formula at it's core) and made it human and resonant.  I went to see the movie out of curiosity, not expecting much, and was more than surprised by my response to it.  The film grabbed me and made me empathize even while part of my mind kept calling &#34;no way&#34; on the silliness of the premise and the situations it engenders. Confession: I cried when Rue's dad turned and fought his way out of the crowd.  And, I don't cry in movies! Luckily, others in the theater were sniffling loudly enough to cover my surreptitious eye-dabbing.With deft but subtle adjustments to character motivation, by dint of understated complexity in the performances, and by allowing the characters to drive the story, rather than the reverse, Ross successfully mined his shallow source material for substance.  He actually made me forget that the books weren't as good as the film he made from them.After watching &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;, I eagerly picked up the book to re-read it, and before the end of chapter one I remembered; the book is an elaborate backdrop, and excuse to dote on the waffling of a somewhat annoyingly adolescent girl over two boys who are, of course, slobberingly devoted to her, despite her inability to either commit or put them out of their misery.

The movie was a bit better than decent, but still not great.  Sure, I enjoyed watching it...but I'm not sure how often I will go back and watch it again.  The characters just aren't that compelling, either in print or screen (yes, I know they are for many, but that's my opinion) and the plot is not overly complicated.I'm sure that some people will jump up and down and say that they have no idea why I'm not wild about this movie (or book).  It does seem to me that this book/movie is well liked by a wide population...but for those of us who read sf/fantasy all of the time, its nothing much new.  Which is sad.  It had the seeds of greatness.(SPOILERS)One of th biggest issues is that we all know from the beginning what will happen.  That Katniss will jump in for her sister.  That she will win in the end.  That changing the rules so that both she and Peeta can win would be changed once it came down to the two of them.  There weren't any real surprises.  I'd forgive a lot with more real twists and turns in the plot.There were also a few problems with the world as portrayed.  For one, why would the Capitol with its super advanced techology (heck, they have a giant holodeck that is so real it can kill you) need old-fashioned coalminers?  There is no way that a city with that kind of technology would still be powered by burning coal.  Now, if it had been emphasized that they had the remnants of techology that was breaking down slowly but surely so that they had to make do and power it now with machines cobbled together that needed coal...well, maybe.  The writer needed to have thought this out or maybe they could have added something in when they made the movie.  It could have made for a richer story.Also, the basic premise of let's play this game and have children kill each other as entertainment for the Capitol and to prove a point to the Districts...why?  Why create anything approximating a hero?  That's just asking for trouble.  The whole plot point about giving them just a little hope, but not enough, didn't make much sense.Loved the look of the Capitol, especially the strange colors of hair and makeup and the costumes.  Beautiful and creepy at the same time.  The woods in the Arena was beautiful (if deadly).  Loved Rue.  Loved Katniss.The saddest part is that this could have been so much better a story and movie if they had gone further and ended with the Districts actually revolting against the Capitol, with Katniss becoming the key leader in overthrowing them...perhaps, that's meant to come later, but it would have made the movie better to have taken another half hour and ended it properly.  Or hinted at the end that she would lead a revolutation against them.  Just a few minute scene of her obviously making up her mind to stand against them once again...as she did when she refused to fight Peeta.Could have been great.",3,Entertaining But a Bit Flat,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,2981,"['must', 'admit', 'liked', 'movie', 'bit', 'better', 'book', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'better', 'decent', 'still', 'not', 'great', 'Sure', 'enjoyed', 'watching', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'often', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'characters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'either', 'print', 'screen', 'yes', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'opinion', 'plot', 'not', 'overly', 'complicated.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'say', 'have', 'idea', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'wild', 'movie', 'book', 'seem', 'book/movie', 'well', 'liked', 'wide', 'population', 'who', 'read', 'sf/fantasy', 'time', 'nothing', 'much', 'new', 'Which', 'sad', 'had', 'seeds', 'greatness', 'SPOILERS', 'One', 'th', 'biggest', 'issues', 'know', 'beginning', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Katniss', 'will', 'jump', 'sister', 'will', 'win', 'end', 'changing', 'rules', 'so', 'Peeta', 'can', 'win', 'would', 'be', 'changed', 'came', 'down', 'two', 'were', ""n't"", 'real', 'surprises', ""'d"", 'forgive', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot.There', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'problems', 'world', 'portrayed', 'one', 'why', 'would', 'Capitol', 'super', 'advanced', 'techology', 'heck', 'have', 'giant', 'holodeck', 'so', 'real', 'can', 'kill', 'need', 'old-fashioned', 'coalminers', 'way', 'city', 'kind', 'technology', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'powered', 'burning', 'coal', 'Now', 'had', 'been', 'emphasized', 'had', 'remnants', 'techology', 'was', 'breaking', 'down', 'slowly', 'surely', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'power', 'now', 'machines', 'cobbled', 'together', 'needed', 'coal', 'well', 'maybe', 'writer', 'needed', 'have', 'thought', 'out', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'something', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'richer', 'story.Also', 'basic', 'premise', 'let', 'play', 'game', 'have', 'children', 'kill', 'other', 'entertainment', 'Capitol', 'prove', 'point', 'Districts', 'why', 'Why', 'create', 'anything', 'approximating', 'hero', 'just', 'asking', 'trouble', 'whole', 'plot', 'point', 'giving', 'just', 'little', 'hope', 'not', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense.Loved', 'look', 'Capitol', 'especially', 'strange', 'colors', 'hair', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'Beautiful', 'creepy', 'same', 'time', 'woods', 'Arena', 'was', 'beautiful', 'deadly', 'Loved', 'Rue', 'Loved', 'Katniss.The', 'saddest', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'movie', 'had', 'gone', 'further', 'ended', 'Districts', 'actually', 'revolting', 'Capitol', 'Katniss', 'becoming', 'key', 'leader', 'overthrowing', 'perhaps', 'meant', 'come', 'later', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'have', 'taken', 'half', 'hour', 'ended', 'properly', 'hinted', 'end', 'would', 'lead', 'revolutation', 'Just', 'few', 'minute', 'scene', 'obviously', 'making', 'up', 'mind', 'stand', 'once', 'again', 'did', 'when', 'refused', 'fight', 'Peeta.Could', 'have', 'been', 'great']",N/A

1340783,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003EYVXV4,Grady Harp,"[1, 12]","Maybe if you read the books, or maybe if you love watching young people kill each other, or maybe if you like juxtaposing Alice in Wonderland with apocalyptic visions, or, as in this viewer's case, maybe you just want to see what all the commotion was about when this HUNGER GAMES hit the theaters and sold out for weeks...but seeing that there are at least four more sequels scheduled into production through 2015 means we all should know what young people are idolizing. This series is to killing fellow youngsters as the Twilight series is to vampires and werewolves - and we still have another episode in that blood bath to go.Suzanne Collins wrote the book and contributed to the screenplay along with Billy Ray and director Gary Ross so the result must be satisfactory to those addicted to the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES. According to the brief synopsis (for those who have yet to submit to this 2  hours of mayhem, the story goes something like this: In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives.'The story inserts phrases like `Hope, it is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is fine, as long as it's contained' and `They just want a good show' in order to make excuses for the wild concept of the movie. The cast includes Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson (probably the best performance in the film, sleazy though his character is), Elizabeth Banks (her makeup and costumes are more ridiculous than any of her confr&egrave;res), Lenny Kravitz (the most sensitive of the crew), and hunks Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson in addition to a cast of thousands. They do with the script what they can.Perhaps it Is the popularity of the mayhem of the current video games or perhaps it is facing the mess we adults have created of this globe, but it is worrisome that themes of films such as this (and the sequels to come) attract such a positive response form the young adults for whom the book was written and the movie was made. It is almost like we have sunk to the level of the gladiator games of ancient Rome or the cockfights still popular in the little towns of the Americas. Knowing that those who follow reviews of this film will shred it, this viewer has to rely on the oft-repeated phrase form the film, `May the odds be ever in your favor.'

(And it's nowhere near as wall to wall godawful as 'Snow White and the Huntsman.') But there are too many far SUPERIOR ripoffs of 'The Most Dangerous Game' out there for anything as insipid, dull and not infrequently just plain stupid as 'The Hunger Games' to get anything approaching a pass - most notably Kinji Fukasaku's instant classic 'Battle Royale,' comparisons to which are both inevitable and inevitably grossly unfavorable. ('BR' gets right down to business without a lot of filler and mush, for one thing, and the psychology of the characters is infinitely more accurate to the psychology of actual teenagers, e.g., the girl who lets her guard down purely because she is socially intimidated by a more popular girl.) It's also nowhere near as thrilling and engaging as the breakneck 1933 'Most Dangerous Game,' which is a sort of sister-film to 'King Kong' filmed on the same sets and also featuring the screams of Fay Wray. HG is expensively produced (and endlessly hyped) junk for young girls who have yet to discover real movies and (presumably, because I'll never read the book) real literature. Which is fine and dandy - I was way into the Batman TV show as a kid, so I take it for granted that younger audiences are drawn to swill. Just know going in that if you're an adult who has been exposed to the real thing, sitting through this soppy and frankly hard-to-swallow mess is going to be a tough slog. I'm pretty sure you have to be an initiate to appreciate it at all. And I've long passed the point of considering these fan bait franchise things they're churning out to be real movies. They exist to get undemanding and obsessed teens and arrested-development cases to part with their expendable cash, and they're generally exactly as entertaining as that assessment would suggest.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","There's no rallying moment more galvanizing for any soul than when kids are placed in jeopardy, and the ultimate extension of this is writer Suzanne Collins' THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy and the massive popularity it's garnered. I was mesmerized by THE HUNGER GAMES, enthused by CATCHING FIRE, and I'd rather not talk too much about MOCKINGJAY. I went to the movie theater yesterday, hoping for the best, preparing for a let down. When you are into a book this much, it pays to be cautiously optimistic when the film adaptation is in play. I was either gonna eat the popcorn or throw it at the silver screen. I ate the popcorn.The broad strokes of the premise: In a futuristic, dystopian world, in a North America that no longer exists, there are the twelve districts and the Capitol City that rules them. Some time ago, the twelve districts had rebelled and were harshly put down. As punishment and as a standing warning, the Capitol each year forces each district to select, by lottery, a pair of its youths (called ""tributes"") to compete in elaborately staged arenas. The objective is to kill each other until only one child remains. The Hunger Games is broadcast not only to the Capitol but to all twelve districts of which oppressed citizens are forced to watch as their terrorized children are inhumanely butchered one by one.District 12, a coal-mining community, is one of the most impoverished in the nation. One can't blame 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen for sneaking off into the woods with her bow and arrows to hunt game to feed her family. We learn right away that she has a knack for uncanny straight shooting. Not too much later, the dreaded lottery arrives. It soon finds Katniss desperately volunteering to replace her younger sister, Primrose, whose name had just been called. Katniss's aptitude for archery won't nearly be enough to guarantee survival. The underdog contestant requires charm and the gift of gab and the ability to generate sponsors to support him or her during the Game. Katniss, who scowls a lot and is standoffish, isn't exactly an extrovert. But the baker's son, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the boy selected from her same district, knows how to work the crowd. No wonder that Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a functional drunk and the assigned mentor to the District 12 contestants, demonstrates a higher regard for Peeta. ""May the odds be ever in your favor,"" recite the decadents of the Capitol. Except that you have to finesse those odds.The book presented many emotional beats, but there were two that seared themselves on my mind. One, of course, depicts the utterly gutwrenching moment in which Prim gets picked in the lottery and Katniss's prompt reaction. The film captures that perfectly. I particularly liked the scene in which Prim, heeding her older sister's advice, tucks in the back of her dress as she hesitantly goes to her own slaughter. It's a heartbreaking touch.The other truly memorable moment in the book concerns Rue of District 11, the smallest and youngest female participant, and what happens to her and how Rue's district then responds to Katniss. The film glosses over that bit, and, in fact, stinges on its moments with Rue.I liked the movie. I would've liked it better had I not read the book. The film's PG-13 rating will draw in more of the kids but it doesn't alter the fact that the rating results in a more sanitized product, a toning down of the violence, a tamping down of the impact presented by the horrific elements within this dystopian fable. The ugly bits have been suppressed some. Still, what we do see on screen is some messed-up dehumanizing stuff. It's definitely immersive and thought-provoking. And it's anchored by a tough and powerful performance by Jennifer Lawrence. Meanwhile, I thought rocker Lenny Kravitz inhabits his role of Cinna, wardrobe stylist extraordinare, more naturally and convincingly than did Harrelson as Haymitch. Stanley Tucci is again terrific as a smarmy show host type.As a manly man, I was never that keen on the trilogy's romantic triangle, although I was always aware of Katniss being torn between her childhood friend Gale and Peeta. The reader never really knew for sure whom she was setting her cap on until much, much later. In THE HUNGER GAMES, the book, Katniss was more ambivalent about her feelings for Peeta. In the film, she seems to genuinely return his romantic interest. But, again, maybe it's a false front she was presenting in the film, and I just missed the subtle cues. It's what happens when we're not privy to the characters' inner monologues. The actors who played Gale and Peeta? They were okay. I thought Hutcherson was a bit overwrought.Here's the difference between the film and the book: I recommend the film; I insist you read the book. There are many good things about the film. The acting is strong (again, Jennifer Lawrence is amazing). And while it runs over two hours, the pace doesn't lag. The rich narrative grips you and horrifies you and it provokes thought and conversation. You may even well up. The ending is open-ended (we know there'll be more chapters to this story). The girl on fire, Katniss Everdeen - often ill-at-ease and enflamed by injustice and who often rashly follows the dictates of her heart - is a better role model for girls than any Kardashian.",4,the

I couldn't tell if it was deliberately comedic, or just such an overwrought, silly story line that it was aimed at a much younger age group (tweens?).  The plot revolves around ""tributes"" (children aged 12-18) who are brought to the Utopian/Dystopian capital of a nation, to fight to the death, for the entertainment of the watching masses (think Survivor, but much less forgiving).  Now, aside from the utterly absurd idea that anyone would EVER do this, or would WATCH it, this plot has gigantic holes that you could drive a Hummer through.The main character does things like make a fire and feed a smaller girl (one of her competitors to be ""the one"" to live), despite knowing full well that other contestants have been tracked and killed by lighting fires.  When another contestant is killed, the heroine takes the time to lay her out, collect FLOWERS and decorate her poor corpse with them, despite the fact that she's still being hunted by a pack of competitors.  (Uh...really?).  She's supposed to be in what any professional pilot would call a ""mission-critical"" environment--every action has potential consequences, but she behaves like she IS on Survivor, and some host will be along any second to fix the situation.There's some very callous and questionable actions--is she genuinely interested in her ""co-star"" from her District, or simply using him for the benefit of the all-present cameras?--and as I said, not even in a jaded world can I conceive of anyone thinking a television show where child contestants beat each other's brains out is a viable prospect.  The movie just stops--doesn't ""end,"" and it's abundantly clear that there's other movies to come, to finish the (lame) storyline, which, OF COURSE, will have some monumental revolution started because of some action by this GIRL, who quite honestly, pretty much didn't deserve to survive.I found it impossible to suspend disbelief; not even the mighty Stanley Tucci, whom I adore, could save this piece of dreck.

1340858,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B003EYVXV4,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[4, 7]","`Hunger Games' Film has BiteNew film The Hunger Games takes place in the distant future of a post-apocalyptic United States.  Apparently, an obliquely referred-to war/cataclysm has purportedly decimated world resources, especially regarding food-- and the country has been divided into 12 impoverished districts.  For seven decades, once a year, a lottery is held in which two children from each of the districts are chosen to participate in gladiatorial combat.  The conflict is, of course, to the death-- the sole survivor wins the lion's share of vital rations for their district, and one presumes, bragging rights.The film's heroine is the dramatically-named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence.)  Katniss is quite adept in the use of a bow and arrow, with which she hunts animals for food and to earn money for the family--her mother apparently had a nervous breakdown when Katniss's father died in a coal-mining accident.  This year, district 12's female lottery ""winner"" is initially Katniss's younger sister, which prompts Katniss to volunteer in her place.  The male contestant from her district is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who harbors a long-dormant crush on Katniss.In an extended, perverted version of being fattened up before the slaughter, the combatants--some as young as 12--are given ornate costumes and literally paraded through the capital city (which seems to lack not at all for any resources), where they are interviewed by the cloying Games host (Stanley Tucci.)  Katniss finds sympathetic allies in her official clothier Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), and alcoholic combat mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who apparently survived the Games himself, decades ago.Peeta is strong of arm but otherwise unconvinced of his ability to survive the combat arena, a vast forest.  Naturally, every inch of it is rigged with video cameras, which broadcast even the most intimate of moments to the national audience.  ""Winning sponsors"" can occasionally get strategically delivered supplies to combatants.  Regardless, dozens of technicians in an operations room actively work equipment that manipulates the environment, causing fires and conjuring giant dogs to terrorize combatants lest they become too good at surviving (similar string-pulling tactics drove the plot of Cabin in the Woods.)Behind the curtains is Crane (Wes Bentley), an executive producer of sorts who serves at the pleasure of the President (Donald Sutherland.)  Embodying the ire of recent real-life political protests, Sutherland's leader knows the status quo he defends is immoral, and he is fully dedicated to maintaining its stark class divisions, with the games as its primary wedge.  Katniss's plucky charm threatens to rock the boat.As executed by director Gary Ross, the film functions as an extrapolation of Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"" and William Golding's youth-gone-feral ""Lord of the Flies"".  Genre viewers may also recall elements of ""The Running Man"" and ""Logan's Run"".  The original Games novel was the first in a trilogy by author Suzanne Collins.

The film is a metaphor of how superficial means of appeasement (""Hunger Games"") might be applied to a society which had been divided and had broken down. It's impressive how well they filmed a bleak mining town of the future -- where the heroine Katniss lived. It reminded me some Soviet ""dystopian fictions"" of the 1920s and 1930s. The dystopian ""future"" where society held together by ""bread and circuses"" is reminiscent of Rome in decline -- yes -- but also of the Soviet Union on the 1930s where society ""hanged together"" by the Statin's ""Show trials"". But wait, is it possible in America? The possibility of civil breakdown is probably more real than we care to think. We do not need nuclear warfare to cause a breakdown. You take a large city like New York - its water supply comes from hundreds of miles away and any interruption of that, or food, or power, or cell phone, or computer networks for a period of time will cause probably breakdown of order.

The hunting scenes reflected very one-dimensional writing lacking in tension (once again, maybe the book was much better). The whole thing was predictable, plodding and simplistic.  What's up with this so-called ""forest""? It sure looked like an artificial world under a dome, did anyone catch that?  You know, kinda like the Truman Show.  And what were these monster-dog things and that instant fire storm? This stuff was apparently generated on-demand from this master control room (also another Truman Show rip-off). The scene with the evil dog-wolf things indicated these creatures were somehow generated on-demand like something from Star Trek's Voyager's Holo-deck (poor CGI, by the way). Were they supposed to be ""natural"" animals released into the environment from holding pens?The second problem was the ending: what happened, did they run out of money and just stop filming in the middle of the final scene?  Geez, you had all this big build-up and for what?  We saw scenes of District 11 rioting, what became of that (I suspect the book probably had much more detail)?  There was a hint of some sort of social uprising but no follow through.  Supposedly, they've been doing ""Hunger Games"" for 74 years yet no one decided to show any resistance until NOW?!!If this were intended as some low-budget sci-fi B-movie, I'd give it a charitable 3-star rating, but Hollywood and the elitist arts & entertainment media cabal all went ga-ga over this -- they hyped it up as the-must-see-film of the year.

The ending isn't quite as bleak as '1984' because, through tenacity and cleverness of two of the lead characters, a bit of sand is at least thrown in the eyes of the powers that be, showing that their power isn't absolutely absolute.

A Bowen ""tabithajab""","[0, 0]","I managed to avoid being sucked into &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; for the last two years, then one dreary Friday night we decided to watch it (we'd seen everything else, it seemed).  It started off well, and I had an idea of what the basic plot would be.  Jennifer Lawrence, although ridiculously young, seems to be an interesting actress.  But more than halfway through, just when you would think I would be on pins and needles wondering who would survive, I fell asleep!Not a good sign.  I knew that the basic theme - man vs. man - had been explored in many fascinating books, starting with that most chilling of short stories, Shirley Jackson's &#34;The Lottery&#34;, to George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; and beyond.  What makes &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; relevant for these times is that the death-match is carried out on reality television.  Much has been written about and studied in popular culture courses about reality T.V. and the sickness of our society in watching people's real lives, banal or horrifying or just plain silly, carried out in front of millions of mindless viewers.

Numerous important details and events are left out, things that would set the mood. This was a cheaply done production. I had Lawrence in my mind as I read the book, and honestly, she did not strike me as the same Katniss in the book. She is a lousy actress that's barely there. I wouldn't pay her anything for this role. The studio is paying $10 million for her in the role? I could find a better actress for that money! The girl is a glorified extra! If I had to grade her Hollywood career, it would be an F. She mumbles her lines, and generally is not passionate about her job. I would love to be an actor in Hollywood! I would overact to the point people would complain about me on Amazon! However, Lawrence looks like she would rather be working in a salt mine. She always looks bothered to be working. I try to picture her in future productions, and I can't. She just wouldn't fit in. She has no future in this business.I don't know who anointed Lawrence to be the next ""it"" girl in Hollywood, but they're wrong. I don't hate her, she's sweet. However, I don't think acting is in her future.I think a much better version of The Hunger Games, in film version, is Battle Royale.

1340900,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B003EYVXV4,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[0, 1]","This isn't a bad film but I don't understand the extreme hype around it - it's The Running Man and Battle Royale mixed together with a bit of TV quality teenage romance thrown in. I enjoyed the movie (and it's been a bad, bad year for film) but it's not a great story by any means.Credibility is the major problem in the film. Given the extreme set up of having teenagers fight each other to the death, the movie did little to justify why this ever happened. Supposedly, the candidates are fighting for food in their districts but this is far from clear - everyone looks pretty well fed for the most part. There's not enough back story to allow the audience to understand the desperation that presumably drives this futuristic society. Similarly, our hero, Katniss, volunteers as a substitute for her sister without ever establishing her sudden need to face almost certain death - why did she do it?While the acting is solid, there's nothing compelling about any of the characters. The love story reads like bad teenage fiction where a life-or-death friendship literally blossoms out of nowhere. Considering the gravity of the situation they are in, the romance is like a tacked-on subplot that starts to take over the film. Predictably, the games of the reality show change to allow the star-crossed lovers to win together (if they can survive, which is pretty much a given).As the games start, teenagers wonder into the woods and one after another meet their grisly endings. There isn't anything particularly clever about the way this happens and some of the sequences are pretty weak. Here's one example - Katniss escapes a murderous group by climbing a tree and one of her pursuers fires an arrow, once, to get her. Rather than shooting off more arrows, they bizarrely decide to sleep at the bottom of the tree. She drops a nest of LSD bees to kill everyone - she then gets stung and passes out for days perfectly safely despite being 100 feet from everyone who wants to kill her. And this is how most of the sequences evolve in a ""and then"" type of plotting that doesn't make much sense or create any tension.Whereas Battle Royale shows the sudden transition of the players having to literally fight for their lives, Katniss sort of bumps along the ride with plenty of help from sympathetic players and flying jars of ointment. You never really feel she's in much danger so it's hard to get involved with the film. And the violence is toned down so much that it's easy to forget that almost everyone on the screen is going to die - they should have skipped the PG-13 rating, though maybe that's 95% of the intended audience.From a production standpoint, with the exception of the great design of the futuristic metropolis, the set looks like it was stolen from practically any show on the SyFy channel. It's hard to see where the $78 million went. Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks' wardrobe pushes the envelope a little too far and borders on the ridiculous, trumping even the The Fifth Element for distracting the audience and adding nothing to the story. I was waiting for Derek Zoolander to make a cameo.So overall I was disappointed. I was sucked into the sheer hype around this film's release and found that it delivers a reasonable way to waste a couple of hours but hardly anything to justify two more sequels.",3,The SyFy channel called and wants all their sets back,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,3323,"[""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'extreme', 'hype', 'Running', 'Man', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'mixed', 'together', 'bit', 'TV', 'quality', 'teenage', 'romance', 'thrown', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'been', 'bad', 'bad', 'year', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'story', 'means.Credibility', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'Given', 'extreme', 'set', 'having', 'teenagers', 'fight', 'other', 'death', 'movie', 'did', 'little', 'justify', 'why', 'ever', 'happened', 'Supposedly', 'candidates', 'are', 'fighting', 'food', 'districts', 'far', 'clear', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'well', 'fed', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'enough', 'back', 'story', 'allow', 'audience', 'understand', 'desperation', 'presumably', 'futuristic', 'society', 'Similarly', 'hero', 'Katniss', 'volunteers', 'substitute', 'sister', 'ever', 'establishing', 'sudden', 'need', 'face', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'acting', 'solid', 'nothing', 'compelling', 'characters', 'love', 'story', 'reads', 'bad', 'teenage', 'fiction', 'where', 'life-or-death', 'friendship', 'literally', 'nowhere', 'Considering', 'gravity', 'situation', 'are', 'romance', 'tacked-on', 'subplot', 'take', 'over', 'film', 'Predictably', 'games', 'reality', 'show', 'change', 'allow', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'win', 'together', 'can', 'survive', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', '.As', 'games', 'start', 'teenagers', 'wonder', 'woods', 'one', 'meet', 'grisly', 'endings', ""n't"", 'anything', 'particularly', 'clever', 'way', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'weak', 'Here', 'one', 'example', 'Katniss', 'murderous', 'group', 'climbing', 'tree', 'one', 'pursuers', 'fires', 'arrow', 'once', 'get', 'Rather', 'shooting', 'off', 'more', 'arrows', 'bizarrely', 'decide', 'sleep', 'bottom', 'tree', 'nest', 'LSD', 'bees', 'kill', 'everyone', 'then', 'stung', 'out', 'days', 'perfectly', 'safely', 'being', '100', 'feet', 'everyone', 'who', 'kill', 'how', 'most', 'sequences', 'evolve', 'then', 'type', 'plotting', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'create', 'tension.Whereas', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'sudden', 'transition', 'players', 'having', 'literally', 'fight', 'lives', 'Katniss', 'sort', 'bumps', 'ride', 'plenty', 'help', 'sympathetic', 'players', 'flying', 'jars', 'ointment', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'much', 'danger', 'hard', 'get', 'involved', 'film', 'violence', 'toned', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'easy', 'forget', 'almost', 'everyone', 'screen', 'going', 'die', 'should', 'have', 'skipped', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'maybe', '95', '%', 'intended', 'production', 'standpoint', 'exception', 'great', 'design', 'futuristic', 'metropolis', 'set', 'was', 'stolen', 'practically', 'show', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'hard', 'see', 'where', '78', 'million', 'went', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'wardrobe', 'envelope', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'borders', 'ridiculous', 'trumping', 'even', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'distracting', 'audience', 'adding', 'nothing', 'story', 'was', 'waiting', 'Derek', 'Zoolander', 'make', 'cameo.So', 'overall', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'sucked', 'sheer', 'hype', 'film', 'release', 'found', 'reasonable', 'way', 'waste', 'couple', 'hours', 'hardly', 'anything', 'justify', 'two', 'more', 'sequels']",N/A

Suzanne Collins does a good job of Americanizing the Japanese story and film,Battle Royal, which took battling school children to rather extreme levels.  Collins makes it a morecompelling story, rooted in Americana and pitting the kids against each other with more arcane weapons, in sharp contrast to the futuristic corporate fascist world of the Capitol.  Gary Ross obviously had to truncate the novel to fit within a convenient 2-hour time frame, so that we only get to know three of the children in any depth, but he amply succeeds in capturing the emotional impact of Rue's story.Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful as Katniss, and I really enjoyed Woody Harrelson as Haymitch.  The kids' relative innocence as contrasted to the cynicism of the adults is pitch perfect, but Haymitch proves himself to have his charges' best interests in mind, working behind the scenes to get his kids all the advantages they can have.  Lenny Kravitz is virtually unrecognizable as Cinna, and Stanley Tucci is all too often the show stealer as Caesar Flickerman.I heard quite a few concerns by parents who couldn't stomach the idea of kids pitted against each other in a fight to the death, but judging by my 11 year-old daughter's reactions, this is what held her attention.  I thought GAry Ross handled the theme very well.  The film had a strong visceral quality, holding close to the story without indulging in too much computer generated imagery.It was a movie that caught be my surprise.  Living abroad, I hadn't followed the Hunger Games phenomenon and was stunned by how much a first edition of the book sells for on the Internet.

This event is called The Hunger Games.This is not the Greek Summer Olympics of B.C. nor a boy scout Indian survival trip, but just as horrible as The Holocaust.A small 12-year old girl, Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) was chosen. She is very scared and upset. Her older sister, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), who is 16, gave her a mockingjay pin earlier for her protection. Katniss will not allow her sister to be the chosen one and she yells out that she will volunteer in place of her smaller sister. The mayor allows it.The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hucherson) who Katniss has met before.Katniss is allowed to quickly say goodbye to her mother (Paula Malcomson) and  Primrose. Her sister gives her back the mockingjay pin now for her protection. Katniss also says goodbye to Gale (Liam Hemsworth), an older teenage boy whom she likes. He tells her to use her bow. She can hunt.The journey begins on a high speed rail train traveling at 200 mph to the Capitol.Also in the cast: Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz, Wes Bentley, Toby Jones, Amandla Stenberg.Option of Language: English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 2.0 Dolby Digital (optimized for late night listening), Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.Option of Subtitles: English, Spanish.Filmed in North Carolina.

1340929,A10H47FMW8NHII,B003EYVXV4,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[1, 2]","This PG-13 movie, based on the best-selling Young Adult novel by Suzanne Collins, describes a not-too-distant future when teenagers selected by lottery are sent to an isolated area to fight to the death on live television. The last one standing will enjoy freedom from hunger for his or her loved ones. To me, this theme is absolutely off-putting, but the book itself isn't as bloody or as sensational as I had feared. Whew!My favorite part is how they skewer Reality Shows! Stanley Tucci is absolutely spot on as the master of ceremonies: complete with fluffed hair, ridiculous makeup, phony smile and over-the-top enthusiasm.Based on this first one's phenominal success, a franchise is in the works for these actors:* Jennifer Lawrence (""Like Crazy"") as Katniss, our resourceful heroine, already familiar with survival skills because that's how she keeps food on the table for her widowed mother and frail little sister.* Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids are All Right"") as Peeta, one side of what will be an eternal triangle; the two masculine sides are very different, but each appealing in his own way. This sweet young baker slips our heroine an occasional loaf of burnt bread for her hungry family and has packed a torch for her most of their lives.* Liam Hemsworth (""The Last Song"") is Gale, an outdoorsy guy, handsome, kind, and very much in love with our heroine; he looks out for her mother and sister when she leaves.* Willow Shields (TV) is Primrose, that frail sister whose name is drawn in the lottery. Her big sister Katniss leaps to her defense and volunteers to take her place.* Woody Harrelson (""Rampart"") is Haymitch, the only previous winner from District 12. He's a drunk and is supposed to mentor our two teenagers. He knows they must land some sponsors in order to get much-needed emergency supplies during the games.* Lenny Kravitz (""Precious"") is Cinna, the creative genius who designs our heroine's ""Dress of Fire."" His kindness offers the first glimmer of hope our heroine can see.* Stanley Tucci (""Margin Call"") is Flickerman, that annoying, insincere master-of-ceremonies.* Donald Sutherland (""Horrible Bosses"") is President of Panem, the dystopian country created by a global conflict. He is irked by the games and is cooking up some new trouble for our star-crossed characters in the sequel.Director Gary Ross (""Seabiscuit"") is a terrific director. I lost my way a couple of times (maybe I don't remember the book correctly), but this film kept me involved every minute. In keeping with her persona, our heroine rarely smiles, is intense, focused, and clearly uncomfortable during her public appearances. Her forced smile is perfect and she does 95% of this film without a trace of makeup. She doesn't stumble in the woods, automatically comes to the rescue of others, and is a crack shot with a bow and arrow.What a welcome change from the self-centered, foul-mouthed floozies who prance across our modern silver screens. Here is a heroine worthy of admiration for today's teenagers!

Both the book and the movie are worth your attention because they provide different perspective views of the same material.  The book is very light on dialog, and events are mostly disclosed through the thought processes of the sixteen year old protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. The movie describes a broader perspective, and provides a larger worldview than the first book provides.  In this respect, the two versions of this story are both necessary, since the motivations of the character are clearly visible in the book, while the reality-television, game-show, decadence, and despotism aspects of the ruling class are more easily seen in the movie.  So my recommendation would be to read the first book of the series, and then see the movie afterward. Due to time (and I'm sure budget) limitations the movie doesn't include many of the details that were clearly visible in the book, but the omission of those details doesn't detract from the overall story. The movie is well produced, and while it compresses weeks of story into a few frantic days, it does justice to the source material. The movie is also considerably less violent than the book, but any story that describes gladatorial games used for reality television entertainment must contain the violence necessary to convince the reader that this is unjust.  The movie is a well balanced presentation, and is suitable for kids who are old enough to not be frightened by the premise. (The grim premise being twenty-four children battling to the death in an arena until only one survives, for the purposes of entertainment of the ruling class and intimidation of the general population.)",5,Hunger Games from a different perspective.,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1775,"['live', 'rock', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'book', 'series', 'movie', 'treatment', 'first', 'book', 'book', 'movie', 'are', 'attention', 'provide', 'different', 'perspective', 'views', 'same', 'material', 'book', 'very', 'light', 'dialog', 'events', 'are', 'mostly', 'disclosed', 'thought', 'processes', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'protagonist', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'movie', 'broader', 'perspective', 'larger', 'worldview', 'first', 'book', 'respect', 'two', 'versions', 'story', 'are', 'necessary', 'motivations', 'character', 'are', 'clearly', 'visible', 'book', 'reality-television', 'game-show', 'decadence', 'despotism', 'aspects', 'ruling', 'class', 'are', 'more', 'easily', 'seen', 'movie', 'recommendation', 'would', 'be', 'read', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'afterward', 'Due', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'budget', 'movie', ""n't"", 'include', 'many', 'details', 'were', 'clearly', 'visible', 'book', 'omission', 'details', ""n't"", 'detract', 'overall', 'story', 'movie', 'well', 'produced', 'weeks', 'story', 'few', 'frantic', 'days', 'justice', 'source', 'material', 'movie', 'also', 'considerably', 'less', 'violent', 'book', 'story', 'gladatorial', 'games', 'used', 'reality', 'television', 'entertainment', 'must', 'contain', 'violence', 'necessary', 'convince', 'reader', 'unjust', 'movie', 'well', 'balanced', 'presentation', 'suitable', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'frightened', 'premise', 'grim', 'premise', 'being', 'twenty-four', 'children', 'battling', 'death', 'arena', 'only', 'one', 'purposes', 'entertainment', 'ruling', 'class', 'intimidation', 'general', 'population']",N/A

A great adaptation of the superb series by Suzanne Collins. Obviously some things have to be left out, as all novels to film go, but they did a wonderful job regardless. I do however understand, that if you have not read/or you did not enjoy the books, that you probably will not enjoy the film as much as an avid fan like myself.Even critics (not that I take their opinion into consideration) who hate all the good movies, gave it a good review. It was refreshing to see an excellent and extremely unique movie for a change, with all the static of junk movies out there. I only have one negative thing to say, the cinematography was extremely jumpy(either due to style, an attempt to tame the violence, or both) The actors for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale were perfect.Prepare for; violence in a fight to survive, the effects of war on children and their families, valor and heart, a bit of romance, maybe a few tears, and struggles from the oppression of a totalitarian Government. I can't wait to see the other movies in the trilogy. This is a must see! You don't have to own it as I will, but I would watch it at least once to form your own opinion.

The districts, kept in penurious poverty by the people of the Capitol, prepare in dread for the coming games. Catness (the amazing Jennifer Lawrence) is picked for the games and is whisked away to the Capitol for a few days of wining, dining and martial training, before being set loose against 23 other 12- to 18-year-olds in a lethal game of death tag. She truly *does* have ""catness"" - aside from being lithe and lethal, she is wily, cunning and inscrutable. The games are set in what looks like a pristine forest, but which has been salted with television cameras, all for the viewing pleasure of the gaudy, bedizened decadent Capitolites as well as the folks back home. The ensuing mayhem makes for terrific television, and sends a political message to the former rebels - redemption is possible, but only in small amounts and only at the behest of the Capitol.The movie's targets were fairly obvious - think reality shows like ""Survivor,"" extended to their logical extreme. And what greater stakes (or an affluent society) than pitting the poor against each other in a death match? But the film also hints at targeting the political and social forces behind the games - the politicians (like Donald Sutherland as the President) who benefit by giving the poor just enough hope to keep them docile; the rich (mascaraed and wildly coiffed) who have no conception of the suffering of the ""stars""; and the media, which never turns down the chance to wring profits out of misery.""The Hunger Games"" can be predictable, but it is moving and thoroughly entertaining. It will be a fine film if the sequels delve more deeply into the hidden motives of the characters -- and maybe even say something about the society that molds them.",5,Great start that hints of more depth to come,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2031,"['Take', 'dash', 'Theseus', 'Minotaur', 'stir', 'smidgen', 'gladiator', 'epics', 'dash', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'have', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'story', '12', 'formerly', 'rebellious', 'districts', 'must', 'cede', 'girl', 'boy', 'annual', 'battle', 'death', 'set', 'America', 'least', '74', 'years', 'future', 'districts', 'kept', 'penurious', 'poverty', 'people', 'Capitol', 'prepare', 'dread', 'coming', 'games', 'Catness', 'amazing', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'picked', 'games', 'whisked', 'away', 'Capitol', 'few', 'days', 'wining', 'dining', 'martial', 'training', 'being', 'set', 'loose', '23', 'other', '12-', '18-year-olds', 'lethal', 'game', 'death', 'tag', 'truly', '*does*', 'have', 'catness', 'aside', 'being', 'lithe', 'lethal', 'wily', 'cunning', 'inscrutable', 'games', 'are', 'set', 'what', 'pristine', 'forest', 'been', 'salted', 'television', 'cameras', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'gaudy', 'bedizened', 'decadent', 'Capitolites', 'as', 'well', 'folks', 'back', 'home', 'ensuing', 'mayhem', 'terrific', 'television', 'political', 'message', 'former', 'rebels', 'redemption', 'possible', 'only', 'small', 'amounts', 'only', 'behest', 'Capitol.The', 'movie', 'targets', 'were', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'think', 'reality', 'Survivor', 'extended', 'logical', 'extreme', 'what', 'greater', 'stakes', 'affluent', 'society', 'pitting', 'poor', 'other', 'death', 'match', 'film', 'also', 'targeting', 'political', 'social', 'forces', 'games', 'politicians', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'President', 'who', 'benefit', 'giving', 'poor', 'just', 'enough', 'hope', 'keep', 'docile', 'rich', 'mascaraed', 'wildly', 'coiffed', 'who', 'have', 'conception', 'suffering', 'stars', 'media', 'never', 'down', 'chance', 'wring', 'profits', 'misery', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'can', 'be', 'predictable', 'moving', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'film', 'sequels', 'delve', 'more', 'deeply', 'hidden', 'motives', 'characters', 'maybe', 'even', 'say', 'something', 'society']",N/A

Pretty much the entire book, from beginning to end was in there, with some changes made here and there.  But even with so much of the book in the movie, the movie's main problem was  Gary Ross' set up for it.  The movie's pacing was WAY to slow.  It should have picked up a lot of speed, but never does.  Another major problem that sort of ruined the movie was his direction for the action and the violence.  I know they wanted to keep this movie PG-13 and such, but the violence is one of the main themes and focuses of the book.  He turns to Blair-Witch Project shaky-cam effects when people run, fight, or get stabbed and the audience can't see what the hell's going on.  The camera is all over the place.  The violence is meant to heightned the storyline.  I know the action and the violence isn't everything but I thought that the director could have used a more effective way to show us.  Ross puts more attention on the forced romance between Katniss and Peeta more on the Games.  Instead, we have an uneven balance between the star-crossed lovers storyline and the action scenes.  I'm not one of those people who are obsessed with violence and need buckets of blood for every movie, but this movie out of all movies really needed it to showcase the theme of the novel more.

Hailing from District 12, Katniss volunteered to take her younger sister's spot in the games.  The rules of the games are simple; two people are chosen from each of twelve districts.  Once transported to the Capitol, the ""Tributes"" as they are called are given a trainer to learn from.  Then, the participants are set loose to fight each other to the death.  Only one will survive.Upon arriving at the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta are put under the tutelage of Haymith Abernathy (Woody Harrelson).  Winner of the 50th Hunger Games, Abernathy, now a older (and drunker) former winner, must devise a plan to ensure the survival of one of the tributes from District 12.Things do not go well initially for Katniss, Peeta, and Abernathy, but eventually, the two young tributes begin to trust the former winner.  Eventually, Katniss, Peeta, and the rest of the tributes are released into the wilderness to begin their fight for survival.  Attrition is high and soon, there are only a few tributes left.  To make things even more interesting, it is announced that if two tributes from the same district survive, then they can both be declared winners.

1340975,A3EAI032S3EBBK,B003EYVXV4,"Jerry Parks ""USAToday All-American Teacher; N...","[2, 4]","I knew virtually nothing about this movie, and very little about the story. Only what my middle school students told me. Since it was a rainy Sunday, I thought I would check out either this movie, or 'Revenge of the Titans'. I'm still wondering if I made the right choice.I will not rehash the plot or the merits and demerits of individual actors. I will only discuss my interpretation and impression of what this movie represents. Was I glad I watched it? Yes. Would I watch it again? No. Would I recommend it for young teens? No, but the draw of the books will make the film irresistible.This is one of the most depressing, 'pathetic' movies I've ever watched. It's 'Survivor' meets 'Lord of the Flies' in a dysfunctional (or perhaps 'malfunctional') dystopian culture. So how to rate it was my dilemma. Is movie quality based upon plot? This one certainly has that. Is it based on the performers? This movie suffers no lack here. Top notch without exception. Veteran performers teaming with experienced and talented youngsters at the top of their game. Is it based on what is remembered when the film ends? I don't think I want to remember this one. Its story often became too...shall I say, 'possible'? In short, this movie is well worth the two-and-one-half hours running time. I loved it, but I didn't like it.So what's not to like? The frightening realism of just how tenable this post-apocalyptic death struggle might really be in a totalitarian society where life is cheap and entertainment is paramount.The late Steve Allen is quoted as saying our society is rapidly becoming one where 'vulgarians entertain barbarians'. 'Hunger Games' might more be described as a world where young adolescents are washed and preened to be sacrificed upon a depraved society's altar of lust for bloodsport.This movie is frightening and disturbing in what it may well foreshadow. Plasticized talk shows, outrageously dressed gender-blenders, Neo-Roman entertainment spectacles and nomenclature (e.g., Caesar, Seneca, Tribute) as well as teenage gladiators randomly selected to satisfy the bloodguilt of generations past. Also disturbing is the gratuitous (though reasonably restrained) death of both young and older children. Certainly the film plays down the butcherous blood and death, but it leaves no doubt that it is ever-present and merciless.I will recall two things as I remember this movie. One, the foreboding--almost imperceptible--background pounding throughout the soundtrack which ever-reminded the viewer of the 'canons of death'. Two, I will remember that no one around me moved for the duration of the film. It as much captured our attention as it did disturb us with its insensitivity toward human life.That our generation of children will find this film more entertaining than disturbing speaks volumes regarding where our culture is heading. A generation steeped in video-game warfare and computer simulated death will be enamored by scenes where software comes alive to kill, the environment is manipulated through technology, death is a necessary function to satisfy the living, and survival at whatever cost is the prime initiative.As a film, this is one is good. True, amidst the carnage there are glimpses of what seem--by post-apocalyptic society standards--old fashioned. There is human compassion, appreciation for a sacrificial spirit, and of course, there is love. But again, there is that frightening portent of a world where life and death by lottery evolves into a barbaric chess game where even the good knights and pawns must succumb to the power and will of the ever-watching and all-powerful state. A state which will not allow embarrassment, and may capriciously alter its own society's rules in order to promote its own appeasement. A state which provides for and furnishes all it feels its citizenry should own in a game of survival. A state which forces its subjects to take the paths of least resistance in order to live, and manipulates its own to say what it alone wants to hear. A state which has degraded such barbarism that death itself becomes the cause of celebration.",5,"""Pathetic and frightening masterpiece of a world gone insane...""",1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,4110,"['knew', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'Only', 'what', 'middle', 'school', 'students', 'told', 'was', 'rainy', 'Sunday', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'either', 'movie', ""'Revenge"", 'Titans', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'made', 'right', 'choice.I', 'will', 'not', 'rehash', 'plot', 'merits', 'demerits', 'individual', 'actors', 'will', 'only', 'discuss', 'interpretation', 'impression', 'what', 'movie', 'Was', 'glad', 'watched', 'Yes', 'Would', 'watch', 'again', 'No', 'Would', 'recommend', 'young', 'teens', 'No', 'draw', 'books', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'irresistible.This', 'one', 'most', 'depressing', ""'pathetic"", 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'meets', ""'Lord"", 'Flies', 'dysfunctional', 'perhaps', ""'malfunctional"", 'dystopian', 'culture', 'how', 'rate', 'was', 'dilemma', 'movie', 'quality', 'based', 'plot', 'one', 'certainly', 'based', 'performers', 'movie', 'lack', 'here', 'Top', 'notch', 'exception', 'Veteran', 'performers', 'teaming', 'experienced', 'talented', 'youngsters', 'top', 'game', 'based', 'what', 'remembered', 'when', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'remember', 'one', 'story', 'often', 'became', 'too', 'shall', 'say', ""'possible"", 'short', 'movie', 'well', 'two-and-one-half', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'loved', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.So', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'frightening', 'realism', 'just', 'how', 'tenable', 'post-apocalyptic', 'death', 'struggle', 'might', 'really', 'be', 'totalitarian', 'society', 'where', 'life', 'cheap', 'entertainment', 'paramount.The', 'late', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'quoted', 'saying', 'society', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'one', 'where', ""'vulgarians"", 'entertain', 'barbarians', 'Games', 'might', 'more', 'be', 'described', 'world', 'where', 'young', 'adolescents', 'are', 'washed', 'preened', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'depraved', 'society', 'altar', 'lust', 'bloodsport.This', 'movie', 'frightening', 'disturbing', 'what', 'may', 'well', 'foreshadow', 'Plasticized', 'talk', 'shows', 'outrageously', 'dressed', 'gender-blenders', 'Neo-Roman', 'entertainment', 'spectacles', 'nomenclature', 'e.g.', 'Caesar', 'Seneca', 'Tribute', 'as', 'well', 'teenage', 'gladiators', 'randomly', 'selected', 'satisfy', 'bloodguilt', 'generations', 'Also', 'disturbing', 'gratuitous', 'reasonably', 'restrained', 'death', 'young', 'older', 'children', 'Certainly', 'film', 'down', 'butcherous', 'blood', 'death', 'doubt', 'ever-present', 'merciless.I', 'will', 'recall', 'two', 'things', 'remember', 'movie', 'One', 'foreboding', 'almost', 'imperceptible', 'pounding', 'soundtrack', 'ever-reminded', 'viewer', ""'canons"", 'death', 'Two', 'will', 'remember', 'one', 'moved', 'duration', 'film', 'much', 'captured', 'attention', 'did', 'disturb', 'insensitivity', 'human', 'generation', 'children', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining', 'disturbing', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'regarding', 'where', 'culture', 'heading', 'generation', 'steeped', 'video-game', 'warfare', 'computer', 'simulated', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'enamored', 'scenes', 'where', 'software', 'alive', 'kill', 'environment', 'manipulated', 'technology', 'death', 'necessary', 'function', 'satisfy', 'living', 'survival', 'cost', 'prime', 'initiative.As', 'film', 'one', 'good', 'True', 'carnage', 'are', 'glimpses', 'what', 'seem', 'post-apocalyptic', 'society', 'standards', 'old', 'fashioned', 'human', 'compassion', 'appreciation', 'sacrificial', 'spirit', 'course', 'love', 'again', 'frightening', 'portent', 'world', 'where', 'life', 'death', 'lottery', 'evolves', 'barbaric', 'chess', 'game', 'where', 'even', 'good', 'knights', 'pawns', 'must', 'succumb', 'power', 'will', 'ever-watching', 'all-powerful', 'state', 'state', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'embarrassment', 'may', 'capriciously', 'alter', 'own', 'society', 'rules', 'order', 'promote', 'own', 'appeasement', 'state', 'furnishes', 'citizenry', 'should', 'own', 'game', 'survival', 'state', 'subjects', 'take', 'paths', 'least', 'resistance', 'order', 'live', 'own', 'say', 'what', 'alone', 'hear', 'state', 'degraded', 'such', 'barbarism', 'death', 'cause', 'celebration']",N/A

This story takes place after a post-apocalyptic war. In the nation of Panem there is a rich capital city that is the center of the government which is surrounded by 12 districts which are poor and are forced to work hard for a meager life. All of their efforts are to support the grander and greed of the capital city residents. Every year the government forces a lottery style draft to select one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 to 18 to fight in a battle until only one survives. This nationally televised event is to show all the 12 districts that the government is totally in charge and the one survivor is a symbol of a weak but meager hope for a better life.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a master hunter and marksman with a bow and arrow. When her young 12 year old sister is selected to go to battle she quickly and bravely volunteers to take her place and she is accepted. She and her male lottery winner are taken to the capital city to train and be judged as to their abilities....What follows is a story of desperation of the games participants and the evils of a corrupt government are exposed to the viewers. The totalitarian government basically has a slave population that works to provide the economical and material needs of the rich citizens while maintaining absolute control and a police state to manage the people.Katniss's performance in the games overwhelms the people of the districts and shows that there is another way of life and that love and compassion for others is the best way to a happy life and not being a slave. This movie is rock solid and the acting is superb. Jennifer Lawrence as the protagonist does a wonderful job portraying Katniss and she simply makes the movie.The special effects are good and Katniss's skill and beauty motivate and inspire the other citizens to want and have more.

1341017,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B003EYVXV4,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[3, 6]","The Hunger Games is based of the novel by Suzanne Collins, and is the first in a series of books that are followed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I started reading the novels a few months ago when I first heard about the films and I have loved all three of the books, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. Now before I go onto the review I need to go over some of the preconceived notions about the film and books going around in movie reviews and the internet. The first is that the books and film are a rip off of manga series Battle Royal. For some reason fans of the series thinks the manga is an original idea when it isn't. I've read the manga. Years ago my older brother introduced me to the manga series. I enjoyed it for what it was a violent manga with great action, but not much else behind it. The story was lacking and so were the characters. As for the originality of the series it takes its ideas from great books and films like Lord of the Fly and Ender's Game among others, so saying that Battle Royal is original is laughable. When are people going to learn that it is virtually impossible to find a truly original idea anymore. What it comes down to is execution, bringing your own take on the idea and making it your own. Suzanne Collins does that The Hunger Games and her series of books using an idea that has been used before and making it her own in which she created a great and dark futuristic dark world with flawed and likeable characters. The second thing I hear about is how the novel is geared down tween girls and these comments from people who actually haven't read the books. I've read the novels and I'm a man and in my early thirties, and I don't think they're geared for girls in their early teens. In my opinion this is geared for everyone. It's a dark series especially Mockingjay that deals with child on child violence, children forced to sell their bodies, war and torture among the other themes in the books, so saying the novels are truly geared for teen girls is just wrong. Finally we have the comparison to the Twilight books. For some reason reviewers and the public and general are overstating the romantic element in the novels and the so called love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. It's nothing like Twilight, which I tried to read but couldn't because it was really bad. First of all unlike Twilight some crappy romance isn't the main driving force in the novels. Second there isn't a love triangle especially if you've read or have gone on to read the other two books. It comes down to Katniss and Peeta. Collin's made that pretty clear in the novels. They are after all the two most important characters in the book. Katniss who will do almost anything to survive and the kind hearted Peeta who doesn't want to let the Capital and the games change him and the confusing and growing relationship between the two. All right I'm done with my rant. I really got to stop surfing the internet or going to certain sites, and now onto what I thought of the film.As I've said I've read the novels before seeing the film, but I'm not one of those people who'll penalize a film if it's not a perfect copy of the novel. The Hunger Games film adaptation is a great film to put it mildly, but in my opinion it's an excellent film. The best I've seen in recent memory. I think since Inception a few years ago. I won't go to in-depth into the plot of the film since most people should know the general plot of the film and it might spoil the film for those who haven't read the novel. It takes place sometime in the distant future after some kind of world war/disaster which caused the collapse of the United States and North America, and what rose from the ashes was Panem. Panem has a president but it's more of an empire then a republic. Years before the novel the thirteen districts of Panem rose up against the Capital but lost with the destruction of district 13. After the war the Capital forced the districts obedience by holding annual games in which a boy and girl from each district from the ages 12 to 18 are randomly picked and forced into game/reality show in which they children must kill each other and there can be only one winner. You don't need to read the books to enjoy the film as it's pretty easy to follow. As for the film adaptation of the book its stays pretty close to the book. There are a few people cut from the film. The mayor's daughter Madge Undersee and Peeta's parents cut from the film. I shouldn't say they were cut since I don't know if they were edited out or just not added. Then there is Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who they didn't wasn't introduced in the film like he was in the movie. I didn't mind the small deviations from the novel and I liked what they added in place. The added a behind the scenes take on the film. Showing the head game master Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as he views the games along with his interaction with president Snow (Donald Sutherland).The acting was great in this film especially by many of the young actors. Of course I have to point out Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) as the lead. She is in almost every scene in the film and it's her shoulders this budding film trilogy is thrust upon. I'm sure if she'd didn't have a good performance or a less talented actress was casted for the part the film would still make a lot of money, but it would have lost much of its credibility. Jennifer delivers in her role as the young Katniss thrust into the games and fighting for survival and dealing with loss and her budding feelings for Peeta. She is a hell of an actress. I've only seen her as Mystique in X-Men: First Class, which see did a good job in. I've heard really good things about her other film Winter's Bone. I've been meaning to see that film for awhile. The other actors did a really good lob. Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) does a great job as Peeta, and he should since besides Katniss he really in the most important character in the series and what he represents. The chemistry between Jennifer and Josh is really good and their scenes together are believable. Woody Harrelson in his supporting role as Haymitch is good as a funny drunk yet dark and serious man. Wes Bently as the head game master did a really a decent job as Seneca, especially his finale scene in the film. Donald Sutherland did a great job as President Snow and his manipulation of the games. Many of the tributes got glossed over in the film. Well there are 24 for them and only one is supposed to survive, so you don't get to know many of them. A few stand out like Alexander Ludwig (Cato) and Amandla Stenberg (Rue) both do a great job in their roles. Then there is Lenny Kravitz (Cinna) who did a good job playing Katniss's stylist and friend. Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman was brilliant in his acting and his interaction with the other actors. The only actor who was left out was Liam Hemsworth (Gale Hawthorne). I think the only reason his name is mentioned a lot really is his older brother Thor Chris Hemsworth. He only has a few scenes in the film. I'm not sure what their going to do with him in the films. In the books he's a minor character in the Hunger Games, a supporting character in Catching Fire and has a main role in the final book Mockingjay.Now I've heard some complaints about the rating of the film in that it's PG-13 not R. The film script was written for a PG-13 rating. That's not to say there isn't any violence in the film. There is a lot and to be honest it's borderline R rating. I'm sure the film had to be edited for time and content to get the PG-13 rating. I'm also sure there'll be an extended edition of the film on DVD and Blu Ray in the not to distant future. That being said any complainers about the so called lack of violence should be satisfied as there is plenty of action which is done well. A small complaint is the shaking camera type of filming. I don't know why people what to continue to do this for films. I know directors are trying to add grittiness and realism to the film, but it does get a little irritating sometimes.Speaking of directing the directing of the Hunger Games is really well done by Gary Ross. I have never heard of the director before this film. I didn't know he directed some decent films in Pleasantville and Seabiscuit. I've seen he's directing the sequel Catching Fire and if he does as well as he did here along with good writing I have high hopes for the film.Isn't funny that soundtracks are virtually never used in the films their promoted for or only used in the credits. That's what happened with the so called soundtrack for the film which is relegated to the credits. As for the score there isn't much of one as you can go a long time in the film with out any kind of background music. That was another tiny flaw I had with the film, but it didn't bother me that much.Overall the Hunger Games is an excellent film with a great story, excellent acting, great action and really good directing. Instead of comparing it to Twilight in film adaptation of novels it should be compared to Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. I highly recommend this film whether you've read the books or not, and don't let the media's and many critics preconceived notions of the film keep you from seeing it. In fact I plan on seeing the film again really soon, which I really do because of ticket prices and only for truly great films.",5,"""I want to show them that I'm more than just a piece in their

1341022,AH91Y6WRATOWN,B003EYVXV4,JMR,"[1, 3]","i read all three of the books last year, so when i heard that this one was going to become a film, i instantly got excited to see it. the previews weren't very revealing, which i liked about it. if it was going to be anything like the book, i just knew it would be good. they left quite a few things out in the movie that were very significant things, that should have been included in the film. the part with the muttations was messed up. they were exactly described in that appearance and the eyes were supposed to match with the previous tributes, which was not mentioned at all. that was a very significant highlight in the novel. katniss mentioned that quite a few times to herself, but the movie showed nothing along those lines.another thing i didn't particularly like about the movie was that it was definitely apparent that the people filming the movie did not use a tripod at all, which made it annoying and hard to focus in. when the camera shakes all over the place, it does not keep a person entertained. luckily i could still tell what was happening, even when they zoomed in too close on peoples' faces and the camera shook everywhere. they also filmed way too fast between killing scenes. it is obvious by the novel's plot that the movie should have been rated R. so they should have focus on each death, seeing as that was the prominent part about the story line. collins also went into detail on each death, so that was not shown in each scene in the movie.i did not think this was supposed to be a movie for kids, but all of a sudden they were getting hyped up about, that made me wish it would have been more gruesome. i am more than surprised that parents would have let their kids go see this movie anyway. i think this was a movie where people who had already read the books would have been left wanting more, expecting more, while those who just decided to see the movie on a whim, not having read the books were simply happy with the outcome of the movie.i am not sure why they left out key characters either. Madge was supposed to be katniss's best friend in the book, so i don't understand why she was completely left out. they never also went into too much detail about the stylists for katniss. one of their names was mentioned in the movie, Octavia i think, but her other stylist was completely left out description wise.either way, i am still pumped for the next two movies. i can't wait to see what they do with them. Finnick especially will be an interesting one. he was one of my favorite characters, so it was upsetting to find him killed off in Mockingjay, as well as Cinna. i still hope the movies follow the books well. i could see certain actors/actresses for certain characters, but i know they probably go way off course with them, appearance wise. we'll see. i may buy this movie when it comes out. its hard to say. i just wasn't too excited with the two main actor choices. they just didn't fit the character descriptions at all.",4,compares somewhat to book,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2972,"['i', 'read', 'three', 'books', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'i', 'heard', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'film', 'i', 'instantly', 'got', 'excited', 'see', 'previews', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'revealing', 'i', 'liked', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'anything', 'book', 'i', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'left', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'out', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'significant', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'part', 'muttations', 'was', 'messed', 'up', 'were', 'exactly', 'described', 'appearance', 'eyes', 'were', 'supposed', 'match', 'previous', 'tributes', 'was', 'not', 'mentioned', 'was', 'very', 'significant', 'highlight', 'novel', 'katniss', 'mentioned', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'herself', 'movie', 'showed', 'nothing', 'lines.another', 'thing', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'definitely', 'apparent', 'people', 'filming', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'tripod', 'made', 'annoying', 'hard', 'focus', 'when', 'camera', 'place', 'not', 'keep', 'person', 'entertained', 'luckily', 'i', 'could', 'still', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'even', 'when', 'zoomed', 'too', 'close', 'peoples', 'camera', 'shook', 'everywhere', 'also', 'filmed', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'killing', 'scenes', 'obvious', 'novel', 'plot', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'R.', 'should', 'have', 'focus', 'death', 'seeing', 'was', 'prominent', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'collins', 'also', 'went', 'detail', 'death', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'scene', 'movie.i', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'kids', 'sudden', 'were', 'getting', 'hyped', 'up', 'about', 'made', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'gruesome', 'i', 'am', 'more', 'surprised', 'parents', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'kids', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'anyway', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'movie', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'read', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'expecting', 'more', 'who', 'just', 'decided', 'see', 'movie', 'whim', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'books', 'were', 'simply', 'happy', 'outcome', 'movie.i', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'left', 'out', 'key', 'characters', 'Madge', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'book', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'never', 'also', 'went', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'stylists', 'katniss', 'one', 'names', 'was', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'Octavia', 'i', 'think', 'other', 'stylist', 'was', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'description', 'way', 'i', 'am', 'still', 'pumped', 'next', 'two', 'movies', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'Finnick', 'especially', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'was', 'upsetting', 'find', 'killed', 'off', 'Mockingjay', 'as', 'well', 'Cinna', 'i', 'still', 'hope', 'movies', 'follow', 'books', 'well', 'i', 'could', 'see', 'certain', 'actors/actresses', 'certain', 'characters', 'i', 'know', 'probably', 'go', 'way', 'course', 'appearance', 'wise', ""'ll"", 'see', 'i', 'may', 'buy', 'movie', 'when', 'out', 'hard', 'say', 'i', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'excited', 'two', 'main', 'actor', 'choices', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'character', 'descriptions']",N/A

The film is a good attempt to interpret the book and the cast is perfect! I especially loved the young actress who played Rue, who is the most touching character in the first book; young, intelligent, resourceful and loving. I want to see more of Amandla Stenberg, that's for sure.The film, however, comes off as slightly flat. The viciousness of the Panem system, where the districts are near starvation is played down. They look merely impoverished, not near starvation as the book vividly portrays. The excess of the Capitol is beautifully filmed, but it comes off as a fairyland more than a contrast and a decadent, selfish society. A few lines of script could have illustrated this.However, ""if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage"" holds true for ""Hunger Games."" A flat, boring script simply doesn't allow the beautiful cinematography and the excellent cast to show the deeper meaning of the film. It's a good interpretation and entertaining. The gore has been held down to let it be watched by children--there is no sex and the blood and gore is limited. However, the film fails to make that incredible impression that the book does--even with all the tricks of the filmmaker at their disposal. I haven't seen ""Catching Fire"", the sequel, as of yet. The director is new; perhaps there is more depth in the second installment. We'll see.

All of them looked Bozo-The-Clownish as seen on an acid trip.  And their preferred decor was just as bad.  All of which had the effect of making me want to avert my eyes from the screen.  Or laugh.  Derisively.  But take them seriously as the future's upper crust?  Even in a movie?  Couldn't do it; not for a second.And the action scenes... never have I seen such filmed more ineffectively.  And annoyingly.  All were filmed in such tight close-up that all one could make out was a dizziness-inducing blur of body parts in motion.And I found the plot to be as disappointing as all of the above, as well.So... to those who actually liked this film, I have to ask:  Why?I'd also like to say to Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson,  Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland:  You should be ashamed of yourselves for appearing in such a turkey.  I guess, though, the paychecks were nice.

As a result the setting up of the Hunger Games is perfunctory, with no real justification for the annual sacrifice of 23 teenagers and no indication as to what is achieved, other than a TV show. The movie comes across as a combination of 'The Truman Show', with the Games taking place in an artificially controlled environment, and 'The Running Man', with people being killed for entertainment purposes.Having failed to set up the movie, the problems are then compounded by making so many of the scenes longer and less productive than is necessary. Other reviews have suggested that the story is all about relationships, but the movie isn't. There's far too much emphasis on the features of the actors and not enough storytelling. Ms. Lawrence might look appealing, but that simply isn't enough to carry a movie.

Whether that's character depth, minor plot elements, or perspective, it's simply not possible to fully translate what is essentially an inner, thought-driven medium into something we experience through more external senses.  In the case of The Hunger Games, the challenge is to translate a first-person-narrated book into more of a third-person experience.  How can the directors express Katniss' thoughts when she only speaks to other people?  How does she really feel about Gale?  About Peeta?  It's tricky, but the directors use understatement very well (witness the ""You call that a kiss?"" note) and express Katniss' emotions through other people's lines (the movie gives words to the Hunger Games commentators; the book does not).  Short shrift is given to Katniss' relationship with her mother, with Prim, with other people in her district, and even to some degree with Gale.  Peeta's parents are barely mentioned; Katniss' father never is.  Probably necessary casualties of a film adaptation, so read the book for a bit more character development.I'll say that the movie was far less gory than I expected, having read the books.  That's a good thing, given the movie's target audience.  No serious blood, but the neck-breaking scene was still disturbing, and Clove is still her usual sadistic self.  The muttations are far less demonic than in the book, and Peeta's injury appears somewhat trivial here compared to the book's festering wound right by his crotch.  No tourniquets here, no post-Games heart attacks for Peeta, no false leg. Still, don't let your children see this without seeing it yourself--I've seen tons of R-rated films that are far less disturbing (though may use more swearing).

1341059,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B003EYVXV4,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 0]","***This review may contain spoilers***So what is a ""Chimera"" movie?  Well, in Greek mythology a Chimera is a fire-breathing monster composed of a lion's forequarters, a goat's hindquarters, and a snake for a tail.  If you prefer, it's an outlandish ""Frankenstein monster"" creature, made of wildly different parts.  Therefore, I define a ""Chimera"" movie as one created from wildly different but familiar movies. Boston Globe movie critic Ty Burr reflects this sentiment in his ""Hunger Games"" review, where he states:""(If you want to count off this movie's obvious inspirations, by the way, you'll run out of fingers and  toes. ""Truman Show'' and ""Wizard of Oz'' are joined by ""Logan's Run,'' ""The Running Man,'' ""The Most Dangerous Game,'' ""The 10th Victim,'' ""1984,'' ""Big Brother,'' ""Red Dawn,'' and countless other influences, and there's an angry online contingent of ""Battle Royale'' fans that want their 2000 drive-in Japanese classic left in peace.""I'll add to this laundry list by mentioning other movie and literature references: Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"", ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", ""Gladiator"", ""Spartacus"" and other Roman Empire spectacle movies, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" (Elizabeth Banks's character Effie Trinket reminded me of Helen Bonham Carter's Queen of Hearts), ""Robin Hood"", and ""Romeo and Juliet"" (especially toward the end of the movie when game contestants and ""star-crossed lovers"" Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) consider eating some berries).Okay enough of that.  In the same review, Burr continues:  ""All of which proves that it's never about where you get a story from, but what you do with it that counts.""  So, does ""The Hunger Games"" (hereafter THG) utilize its myriad movie parts wisely and effectively?  I believe it does, and that it does so due to Lawrence's fairly nuanced and commanding portrayal as Katniss.Without repeating too much of the plot (I hope) since other posters have done that quite efficiently, I felt that Katniss exhibited the proper mixture of tension, resourcefulness, courage, and resoluteness to make THG's portrayal of a sadistic, decadent United States of Dystopia more than halfway believable.  We get a glimpse of her pre-Games struggle to keep her and her impoverished mother and younger sister Primrose (Willow Shields) fed and alive with her archery skills.  We appreciate her desperate but noble and prudent gesture to volunteer to take Primrose's place in the Games (because we suspect the fragile, terrified Prim would easily have been eliminated). We understand her brusque, standoffish demeanor as she negotiates the pre-Game trials and trainings and subtly introduces us to this bizarre world of the garish elite that control the human sacrifice games.  We get hints of her sly intelligence and tenacious will to live as, despite her fiery pride, she does listen to former Hunger Games champion and dissolute current sponsor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to curry favor with these grotesque aristocrats in order to improve her odds.  She does the same with fellow District 12 contestant Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) with whom she shares an ambiguous supportive and dismissive relationship; in other words, are they just acquaintances forced to be uncertain allies under cruel circumstances, or are they becoming friends or something even more?  Does Katniss have a plan to defy Panem's masters (her shooting the apple from the roasted pig's mouth during training and her three finger salute to the districts watching the Games sure seem like it) or is she trying to get the odds of her survival more in her favor? Katniss's tantalizingly elusive performance sells us on the seriousness of her strange predicament, and so we become invested in the workings of THG's deliberate, patchwork plot, and the fates of its characters, primarily Katniss's.Without Katniss to guide us, I'm afraid that THG might have become more sluggish under the weight of its movie and literature borrowings.  With the possible exception of Peeta, the rest of THG's characters, I feel, get scant time to develop their motivations and goals.  The other Games contestants (except maybe the crafty but soulful Rue (Amanida Stenberg)) are simply one-dimensional, sketchy victims. How about learning a little more about them?  Lenny Kravitz's sympathetic sponsor Cinna has only about a couple of meaningful interactions with Katniss as he helps her overcome her insecurities and doubts.  Banks' Effie gives us just a fleeting taste of the flaky, superficial decadence of Panem's (is that short for Pan-Empire, or All-Empire?) elite.  Regarding our introduction to the destitute District denizens, besides Katniss and her soul-sapped family, we barely meet Katniss's handsome beau(?) and fellow hunter Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who seems to be introduced mainly for a potential menage a trois with Katniss and Peeta.  As for Panem president Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), he is genteelly, quietly menacing and inscrutable, which is okay, but it would have been nice to have at least a couple more scenes to establish a little bit more about his character.THG also seems to have logical inconsistencies.  The main objective of the Games is straightforward enough (be the sole survivor), but the rules are certainly arbitrary and changeable from moment to moment.  Furthermore, the Game creaters are omniscient controllers.  Even if a winner emerges and the populace is entertained, the President could arrange to have the winner executed sometime later.  Some ""hope""! So why participate? Personally, if I'm a contestant and likely to die anyway, I would defy this rigged deathtrap and die on my own terms.  I am surpised that Peeta didn't share that sentiment.It doesn't really matter. THG is a sturdy, involving movie that combines adventure, romance, danger, and social commentary in an agreeable, palatable, almost unsettlingly innocuous way.  Without Lawrence's Katniss, I would have rated THG 3 stars.  With Katniss's complex but commanding character, THG deserves 4 stars.  She manages to make us squirm a little about our ironic enjoyment of kids being compelled to kill each other for the pleasure of a corrupt administration, and to make us reflect a little (though not as much as it could have) about the savage, violent inequalities of our present governments and societies.",4,"""The Hunger Games"" is a Well-Constructed ""Chimera Movie"" Largely Supported by

Much of how I feel has already been written, but my major complaint was Katniss as described in the books & Katniss on screen. She was supposed to be 16, skinny, dark hair & olive skin, Gale could be mistaken for her brother. Jennifer Lawrence is nothing like that, so I was never convinced that she was hungry for anything, too well fed & rosy cheeked. The choppy cinematography gave me a headache, was it really necessary? I did enjoy Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson & Donald Sutherland. The fact that we weren't hearing Katniss's thoughts also took away from the story. The actual Hunger Games were lame,these events in the book were tense & exciting & I was rooting for Katniss, but I didn't care in the movie. I never really cared for any of the characters & maybe that was the problem, apathy. In the books I cared about Prim, Rue, Gale  & Peeta, but in the movie they were just actors, nothing more. How anyone fully understood the movie if they hadn't read the book is beyond me, but having said that you wouldn't know what was missing. There were huge chunks missing & characters never developed which left a big hole in the story. I won't see the sequels because I am not interested enough.

1341069,A3F9VH8916IA40,B003EYVXV4,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[12, 24]","Full disclaimer, I've not read the books that this movie is adapted from.  Before going in I had no idea what to expect from this film except teenagers killing teenagers in a dis-utopian world sometime in the future. I had no knowledge of the story, the characters, the world this film is set in, nothing at all.Now that that's out of the way, I would like to also state that going into this film I had my reservations. When people you know have probably never read a book in their life they weren't forced to read start raving about a young adults novel than you know something's up. Leading up to the release of this film that is exactly what happened. People I know to never read came to me telling me how great this series is, how exited they were for the film, how edgy, deep, and emotional it all is. Warning flags went up in my head. This had Twilight written all over it. A young adult series about teenagers fighting to the death might sound edgy and original, but unless done right it can be neither.Sometime in the future (near or far, we're never told) a war breaks out within ""The Country"" where 12 districts rebel against the central government and are brutally crushed. Little back story is given to this war, but we are told that it was bloody. The Country, from its capital aptly named The Capital, wins ""The War"" against ""The Districts"" and imposes upon these humbled and defeated people a treaty that states every year a boy and a girl ages 12 to 17 will fight to the death in ""The Hunger Games"" as punishment. Cause you know, making the kids of conquered people fight to the death is a real fine way to pacify them. The absurdity of this premise is plain enough to see. Taking the children of your defeated countrymen and forcing them to kill each other is not a very sane strategy of pacifying the population. As demonstrated in the film itself all it does is lead to riots and anger towards ""The Country."" Unlike in like-minded stories such as Stephen Kings ""The Running Man"" or ""The Long Walk"" these games do not carry universal appeal; they are not used primarily as a means to entertain the masses and keep them happy but to punish the treasonous districts even 72 years after the fact, long after those who started The War have passed on. From what is shown the Districts have no love for the games, and indeed hate them as they should, so they serve only to arouse hatred and anger against the government. Why, after 72 years even a totalitarian government would risk riots and revolt every year just to put on a set of games defies logic. Much harsher punishment is inflicted every day in the form of starvation, terrible working and living conditions, and an electric fence system that herds the people into towns like cattle. The games are unnecessary as punishment and only incite violence towards the government. I can see it now, the heroes of this film rising up against the bad guys to take them down, all because of some idiotic games.The plot does indeed sound edgy, but it is hardly the only work of art I've seen to depict children being killed for sport or killing others. Stephen Kings ""The Long Walk"" and the anime series ""Gunslinger Girls"" have similar premises but execute their respective idea's in a much deeper and emotional fashion than does Hunger Games. At the end of the day both those works of art were written for a much older audience while Hunger Games was written for teenagers, and it defiantly shows. In a movie like this you expect to see carnage and brutality that not only tugs at the heartstrings but also shows us the real evil of such a system. The actual games take up about a quarter of the film and even then very little actual violence is shown. The opening fight scene is a slow motion blur of kids running around, screaming, and smearing the camera with terrible looking fake blood. The film pussyfoots around its brutal premise in order to avoid the R rating it by all rights should have received, which, in the end, effectively negates the shock and horror I should have felt while watching. I felt that horror while reading The Long Walk; I had that shock when I watched Gunslinger Girls; all I felt watching The Hunger Games was boredom. The fights weren't even exiting. I'm sorry, but blurry and dark close up fights where I can't even tell what the hell is going on is NOT exiting. Give me a break.And don't even get me started on the love story. It's as if the makers of this film thought their audience too shallow and stupid to fully grasp the deeper implications of the main plot and so they through in an idiotic teen romance to spice things up. No it does not reach Twilight bad, but at least Twilight was a romance from the start and wasn't advertised as anything different; The Hunger Games are a complete different beast entirely. Reading reviews and descriptions of this film I was led to expect a tale of defiance, of fighting back against incredible odds, of sticking it to the man. None of that happens. No one fights back, no one speaks out against the system or comments on how terrible killing children is. No one defies the government or anyone. Instead we are given a clich&eacute; teenager romance. In fact, hardly anyone seems to have trouble taking another person's life in this movie, not even the main character. Twelve to seventeen year olds murder one another like hardened criminals with little regard for life and hardly any fear. Grown men would be pissing themselves at the prospect of being murdered gladiator style. Most of these kids hardly blink. The entire movie I was waiting for our hero's to resist, to fight back, to do anything really that the establishment didn't want them to do. SPOILER: Trying to commit suicide at the end doesn't exactly count.The movies not all bad though. For the most part the acting is pretty decent, although most characters besides the lead stick mostly to stereotypes and clich&eacute;'s at least the stereotypes and clich&eacute;'s are decently acted. They all wear ridiculous costumes and make up, live in idiotic looking houses, and love watching kids kill each other. What a world, what a world.I honestly don't understand the love for this movie. It's okay I guess, but hardly worth all the hype and love its received. Just another silly movie aimed to please silly teenagers.

The movie proposes that the society run a contest every year where each 'province' was to send 2 representatives to compete in games.  The objective of the games is to KILL as many other players as possible as there is only 1 (ONE) winner.  While the movie is entertaining and interesting, the solution proposed is a poor solution to the prevention of war or other societal issues.Rather, it would be so much better if society went ahead and made these types of deadly competitions for the sake of satisfying people's needs to murder, kill and win at all costs an illegal type of activity.  Rather, more innovative solutions would be a more positive benefit to society at large without needlessly or inappropriately killing people for the sake of a game that is supposed to keep society out of major wars.  The concept is ignorant.  It is an ignorant concept,because people will find ways to avoid the potential of being picked as a competitor and most likely be killed.  Rather, they will kill, hide, obfuscate and do any activity that will keep them out of the games that would most likely end up killing them if they participated.Nonetheless, I give the movie a 3 star rating, because it was a fairly well made film that addresses a large societal issue.  I suspect the new &#34;Hunger Games&#34; movie will continue to discuss the concept and hopefully, will reach a better solution than the one that is being used in the first movie.

1341085,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B003EYVXV4,Josh,"[0, 0]","A week before this movie was released on dvd, I decided to read the book before buying the movie. I still to this day can not recall ever reading a book as fast as I read The Hunger Games. To describe the book (well I would have to review the book itself). I had my doubts about the movie at the time, but after watching it, I was completely hooked.This story introduces us to Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) and her sister Prim, mom (whose name is not ever revealed). Early on it is made clear that Katniss is really the backbone of the family. And right away it is also clear that life: everyone and everything around her is depressing. To be honest, the town looks and feels like a communist society.With The Reaping coming up, that is-tributes from each district selected at random to participate in the grueling Hunger Games-which is-an olympic like showdown designed so that 24 contestants fight, kill (yes kill) to come out on top. Unfortunately for older tributes, your name is entered multiple times, which obviously makes you more likely to be chosen. While at The Reaping along with Prim and Katniss's friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Prim is unexpectedly chosen which makes Katniss volunteer herself in her sister's place. And thus, we are given a movie.There is so much to admire about the movie The Hunger Games. The acting, from Woody Harrelson's sometimes hilarious but serious toned performance as Haymitch to Amanda Stenberg's adorable performance as Rue, is really on point in the movie.The movie does a good job of digging into your emotions as well. There are going to be times in the movie where you will want a certain character to survive and live, of course you will have some characters that you want to die immediately. I hear this complaint all the time about ""well this should have been in the movie"" or ""why was this part in the book but not in the movie?"" I hear it a lot with my friends and colleagues. Movies like Harry Potter or The Chronicles of Narnia, etc. come to mind as great examples of working around the lengthy pages and being adapted to two hour or more movies. This one really stayed with the book in my opinion. Obviously, there were some things left out, but as for the movie itself, it does stay on par with the book.To close, you can and will expect drama, action, suspense, and many more things with this movie. I definitely can say that the books by Suzanne Collins (I am currently reading Mockingjay) are also definitely worth it. The Hunger Games is not just about the will to survive, it is about Katniss's courage and will to win. Again, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a fantastic read, and this movie directed by Gary Ross is an exciting watch. I hope I have not set my expectations to high for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which I will be seeing this weekend, but I am even more excited to write my review for it since I have been hearing such great things about it. If you have not yet seen this movie, GO WATCH IT.

It had to be the directing because the storyline and scenes at times were overdone with makeup and outrageous designs and ignored the development of the characters and action.  Also, the movie focuses on the pre-arena storyline for too long; it should have focused more on the arena.  As a side note, the movie left out some important details of the book, but I will not go too much into that because that is being biased.  A novel and its movie should go together but make sense and stand out separate.  However, I will say that the movie failed epically when they tried to visually create the dog scene from the novel.  Those dogs at the end of the movie made me laugh.  Those beast looked ridiculous.  From the movie, I would not be completely sure if they were suppose to be dog-like; I am just making the assumption based on the novel.However, The film did well at bringing the scenery to life.  The costumes and designs were perfect.  The people of the Capitol were as I had imagined them to be.  Plus, the choice of actors/actresses for this movie were excellent choices, except for Josh Hutcherson as Peeta.  Elizabeth Banks made for a great Effie Trinket.  She was probably my favorite character.  I often laughed at her antics and the things that she said, which was a positive for this film.  Overall, I really liked the film, but if I was to give a five star review, it would have been biased because I am a fan of this trilogy.  Therefore, I kept in mind the cons and the pros of the film as an individual, and hence, it gets three stars from me.  Despite the cons, I would still recommend this movie and definitely the novels to anyone.",3,Good -- Somewhat,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,1868,"['am', 'trying', 'keep', 'review', 'as', 'unbiased', 'can', 'am', 'fan', 'novels', 'would', 'like', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'did', 'not', 'hate', 'movie', 'fact', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'be', 'directing', 'storyline', 'scenes', 'times', 'were', 'overdone', 'makeup', 'outrageous', 'designs', 'ignored', 'development', 'characters', 'action', 'Also', 'movie', 'pre-arena', 'storyline', 'too', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'arena', 'side', 'note', 'movie', 'left', 'out', 'important', 'details', 'book', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'being', 'biased', 'novel', 'movie', 'should', 'go', 'together', 'make', 'sense', 'stand', 'out', 'separate', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'failed', 'epically', 'when', 'tried', 'visually', 'create', 'dog', 'scene', 'novel', 'dogs', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'laugh', 'beast', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'sure', 'were', 'suppose', 'be', 'dog-like', 'am', 'just', 'making', 'assumption', 'based', 'novel.However', 'film', 'did', 'well', 'bringing', 'scenery', 'life', 'costumes', 'designs', 'were', 'perfect', 'people', 'Capitol', 'were', 'had', 'imagined', 'be', 'choice', 'actors/actresses', 'movie', 'were', 'excellent', 'choices', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Peeta', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'made', 'great', 'Effie', 'Trinket', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'character', 'often', 'laughed', 'antics', 'things', 'said', 'was', 'positive', 'film', 'Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'review', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'biased', 'am', 'fan', 'trilogy', 'Therefore', 'kept', 'mind', 'cons', 'pros', 'film', 'individual', 'hence', 'three', 'stars', 'cons', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'definitely', 'novels', 'anyone']",N/A

Josh Hutcherson (The Bridge to Tarabithia), was also an excellent choice as Peeta Mellark.  The film does what a good adaptation to a novel does: re-interpret it as needed to the much different medium.  The book (I have read all three) is first-person narrative, so we always know what is going on in Katniss' head.  Obviously that cannot be transferred to the screen other than by the actor's expressions and words.  And that is done immaculately by Ms. Lawrence.  Lawrence's background has been in the indies, the form she prefers she says, but showed her acting chops in a big Hollywood movie as well.  My suggestion to those who have read the book(s): watch it as a movie, not looking out for things left out or added in.  Suzanne Collins gave the screenwriter and director, Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Big, as screenwriter) wide latitude in creating the vision.  Ross obviously succeeded.  Watching it now on DVD made me love it even more than when I saw it at the cinema.  For all of those who are hesitant to see a movie of, basically, children killing children, please know that it is not shot gruesomely (with one exception), emphasizing this type of violence.  The fight scenes at the cornucopia are handled in a way that it almost seems like a blurr, for instance.  Also, it is clear that this is not to glorify violence as in an action thriller, but to show the calumnity and viciousness of the Capitol and its President, played chillingly by the great Donald Sutherland (Kiefer's dad for you under 30).

Also, none of the characters were shown to 'think about their circumstances of slaughter'.  There was no reflection on the horrible things they were asked to do.  Instead we are constantly shown close-ups of Katniss's boyfriend who gets like two lines in the first five minutes of the movie whenever she does something with Peeta.

This is a story in which teenagers duel to the death, for the most part against their will, for the amusement of the viewing audience.  How this story can be classified as Young Adult is beyond me.  I guess the powers that be who decide these things are only on the lookout for sex, nudity or swearing.  Even with the artful cuts, this is a violent movie based on a violent book.That being said, as far as the movie goes, having read the books, it was very interesting to change the POV from Katniss to an observer.

1341119,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B003EYVXV4,kacunnin,"[230, 314]","Director Gary Ross's version of Suzanne Collins's HUNGER GAMES manages to sanitize the entire concept of kids-killing-kids in order to produce a PG-13 blockbuster that's sure to rake in the big bucks.  But what was devastating and heart-wrenching in the novel is glossed over and prettified here, leaving me feeling none of the emotional impact I experienced in reading the book.[**SPOILER WARNING**  I'm assuming readers are familiar with the novel, so some plot elements will be discussed in this review.]Don't get me wrong, this is a slick and well-made film, with plenty of action and a sensational performance from Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss Everdeen.  The settings are well done, especially the Capitol in all its crazy-colored chic-ness and over-the-top luxury.  District 12, the poorest district in Panem, is believably presented as well, complete with starving people dressed in rags and walking like zombies to their depressing jobs.  The scene of the ""Reaping"" is chillingly done, and the scenes of Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) getting primped and trained in the Capitol hit perfect satiric notes (it's all so ""reality TV,"" which is what makes it all so believable).What doesn't work are the scenes of the Games themselves.  From the start, Ross misses the mark.  When the Games are seconds from beginning, the 24 teens are standing in a semi-circle, staring down at weapons and backpacks strewn about around the Cornucopia as they wait for the countdown to hit zero.  We need to feel what they're feeling.  We need to feel their terror, their horror, and yes, even their excitement.  But Ross doesn't let us feel any of that.  Instead, he keeps the focus almost solely on Katniss, and once everyone starts rushing forward, he cuts so quickly between scenes that it's almost impossible to see what's going on.  We are aware that people are being killed, but it happens so fast and with so little reaction from the characters themselves, that it has little impact.The same holds true for the rest of the games.  Horrible things happen, but I never felt that they had much affect on Katniss or Peeta.  Most of the killing in the film happens off screen, or the camera cuts away before anything brutal is revealed.  That wouldn't be a bad thing if we could at least see some believable reaction shots.  But we don't.  On top of that, none of these characters look like they've been out in the woods for days, trying to kill each other.  Close-ups of hands show clean, manicured fingernails, and everyone looks amazingly dirt-free (aside from Peeta, who camouflages himself with mud at one point - but even then, he's clean and chipper-looking a few scenes later).Rue's climactic death scene is equally ridiculous.  Rue (Amandla Stenberg) looks downright gorgeous, like she's on her way to a photo shoot instead of swinging in trees to avoid getting knifed (in fact, we don't get to see her swinging in trees at all, just peeking out from between branches).  Her hair is perfect, there's not a scratch or bit of dirt on her, and when Katniss is holding her as she dies, it's impossible to imagine that they've been out in the woods for days without soap and water, fighting for their lives.  It's just all too pretty, all too nice.I walked out of the theater feeling oddly detached from what I'd just seen.  That's not at all the way I felt in reading the book.  The novel was gripping and gut-wrenching, and although it was certainly not graphically violent or bloody, the situation Katniss found herself in was chilling and horrifying and impossible to forget.  At the end of the film, however, Katness seems almost unscathed by what she has just experienced.  I didn't see any indication that she is the wounded, devastated young woman she is in the novel.  In the final scene, she's more bothered by seeing Gale (Liam Hemsworth) in the crowd at the train station while she's holding Peeta's hand.  Yikes, girl, you've just KILLED people and seen children covered in blood . . . surely you'd be thinking of something more than which guy you like better.There are changes in the film that might bother the die-hard fans.  The ""Mutts"" that attack during the final act are just generic beasts in the film (they don't have the faces of the fallen tributes), which minimizes their impact.  The symbolic Mockingjay pin just shows up near the start of the film without explanation.  But these are minor changes.  Stanley Tucci is great as Flickerman, Woody Harrelson is terrific as Haymitch, and I enjoyed seeing Donald Southerland as President Snow (although his performance was so low-key I had trouble imagining him as a ruthless dictator).This is a big movie, and it's going to be a huge success.  I have no doubt a huge percentage of HUNGER GAMES fans will be thrilled with what they see on the screen.  I just wanted to feel more.  The whole idea of being forced to kill people for a TV viewing audience is absolutely horrifying - I wanted to see that and feel that in this movie, the way I did in the novel.  You can't win a ""game"" like this.  Haymitch is proof that you can't win (what happens to his life after winning the Games is evidence of what such brutality will do to you).  In the novel, Katniss herself is torn apart by what happens.  In the film, not so much.HUNGER GAMES is not a terrible film.  I'm glad I saw it.  But it in no way does justice to the novel, and that's too bad.",3,"Too pretty, too santized -- the film has none of the emotional impact of the novel",1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,5419,"['Director',

Poor Katniss Aberdeen is a native of district 12, an area where coal mining is the primary way of life. She lost her father in a mine collapse roughly 4 years ago and is struggling to support her 12 year old sister and mother. She takes to the woods to hunt for food. These hunting skills work in her favor when she volunteers to take the place of her sister for the 74th Hunger games.What are the hunger games, you ask? Two ""tributes"" from each of the 12 districts, 1 male and 1 female, are picked at random to participate in a ritual of anything goes war. All 24 are released in an environment and expected to fight until only one remains. Basically, being selected means your death certificate has been signed.""Catnip"", her nickname, and her district 12 partner Peeta do exceptionally well and survive the first few nights of the Hunger Games. Not wanting to spoil anything, they outlast nearly half of their competition that died within the first few minutes of being released. Talk about a bloodbath!Why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? I've read some of the book and thought the movie glossed over some important things.1. In the beginning when Catnip climbs through the fence, she does it without any hesitation whatsoever. The book makes a big deal about her listening to the hum of it and how careful she is to make sure the power is turned off. There was no indication of this at all in the movie.2. I wasn't a fan of how the movie broke down the memory of Catnip and Peter. There wasn't really a reason to do it that way, and I think the scene actually should have been longer.3. The mockingjays seem to have a rich history about them in the book including the role they played in the rebellion,  but they play an extremely small part in the movie.

I was not sure about Josh Hutcherson as Peeta but ending up thinking he made a great Peeta.  I am still Team Gale---is it just me or did they downplay they Gale scenes?---but am slightly more open to the idea of Peeta and Katniss together now that I've seen the movie.As with any book to movie adaptation, I missed the parts that were cut from the book.  The bit about the Mockingjay pin bothered me, I wanted to see more of Katniss's life before the Reaping, and I wanted to see the victory tour after the Games.  I also wanted to see Katniss break Peeta's heart at the end of the movie, like she does in the book.  Oh, burn, Peeta, burn!  I have a feeling these movies are going to be very pro-Peeta.  And I'll just have to learn to live with that.I loved the special effects as well as the costume design.  Those two elements really made the movie for me.  I also loved getting to see the Games through the Gamemaker's perspective.  I enjoyed seeing them manipulating the environment, and thought it added another layer of depth to the movie.Overall, I enjoyed The Hunger Games.

If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.The cast led by Jennifer Lawrence (as Katniss), Josh Hutcherson (as Peeta) & Liam Hemsworth (as Gale) is excellent.

1341216,A13NJZ1M018A7C,B003EYVXV4,"Kris ""Krissy P.""","[2, 6]","I recently went to see this movie and it was incredible.  It's haunting, dark and deeply disturbing; but so compelling, I had to read the book.  I waited until after reading the book to write this review.WARNING-CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS....The Hunger Games takes place in post-war Panem, formally known as North America.  Panem is made up of 12 districts.  Two children, a boy and a girl, between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district in a lottery to compete to the death in The Hunger Games for the Capitol and President Snow's entertainment.  This movie is violent and frankly, difficult to watch.  I was emotionally exhausted by the time it was over.I thought the casting in this movie was spot on.  Jennifer Lawrence gave an incredible Oscar-worthy performance as Katniss Everdeen.  I am so impressed with this actress' level of talent.  She became Katniss and I don't think anyone else could have played this part any better.  I also loved Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark.  He really impressed me as well.  I got emotionally invested in these two characters and their fight to keep themselves and each other alive.Here are my thoughts regarding the movie/book comparison:All I can say is Wow. It's really good. I loved the movie, but the book is even better.  Keep in mind that they had to condense the novel into a 2-hour movie so there is going to be some changes made to make it work on screen.Katniss' complicated relationship with Peeta is more connected in the books than the movie and I have to say that I absolutely love him. There is nothing sexier than a man who will do anything, including risking his life, for the woman he loves.  I'm Team Peeta all the way. I think I got a better sense of who Gale is to Katniss in the book as well. In the movie, he was just some kid back home that she hunted with, but in the book, you get to see what she is feeling and what his friendship really means to her. I was really affected by this movie and the book. It's funny that my feelings for certain characters were so different in the movie than the book.  For example:  I had absolutely no sympathy for Cato whatsoever in the movie, but really felt sorry for him for what he had to endure in the book at the end of the games.It was a very disturbing movie for sure, but amazing nonetheless.

I liked Lenny Kravitz (Cannis), Donald Sutherland (President Snow), and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch).

I was introduced to the novel by my adult, PhD-candidate daughter, who said the book was marketed as a juvenile novel but that I would find it anything but juvenile. She was correct: the writing is riveting. And I promptly read the next two novels.When the movie came out, I had doubts. The novel is intensely personal, so there are no grand, overarching vistas, and the reader never knows more than the first person narrator. In a film, you can't get into a character's head quite that easily, unless you want to try the god-like narrator approach, constantly talking over the action. The director wisely chose to ditch the god-like narrator, and instead you have a number of scenes not in the book, where characters manage to both increase the level of tension and drama and at the same time fill in some gaps based on knowledge not known to the main protagonist. This is done with a gentle touch; even a careful reader of the novels will not feel the story was violated.The special features on the disc help explain some of the choices in how the book was turned into a film, especially an amazing letter by Donald Sutherland, explaining his understanding of President Snow, the chief villain in the series.In short, this is an excellent film based on an excellent book.

A bit slow in the beginning, to help explain who Katnis is and her values. There's a good amount of drama tossed in, which would be obvious for the plot of the movie.There are definite moments that you notice there just isn't enough time in a 1 hour and 40-some minute movie to explain every single detail, like ""Oh, how did he end up there?"" Or ""why was it so sad that she died?"" ...things like that.Overall, it's a good movie for teenagers to watch, adults can get into it too. Not so much for smaller children.

Schultz ""msthoth""","[0, 0]","I felt that this film brought the book to life in a way that was very faithful to the book's story detail, while omitting some of the most unnecessary gore and grimness, that didn't to be there to get the ideas across.  When I first saw the film I was a little disappointed in the choice of actor to play Peeta.  Josh Hutcherson is cute but isn't he wasn't my vision of what Peeta was like.  In my head, Peeta was a much larger (and much hotter) guy.  However, the longer he was on screen and the more times I watched JH act the role, the more I could never envisage another actor playing that role-- so thoroughly and completely does Josh embody Peeta's decency and humanity.  At the end of the third book, Katniss somes to realize as she puts it, that she doesn't need Gale's fire. What she needs is the dandelion in the spring that gives hope to the heart, the hope of love and better things, the hope that nourishes both body and soul.  She can't live without it and neither can we.  The choice of Jennifer Lawrence to play Katniss is utterly perfect and apparently so from the first frames of the film.  And Lenny Kravitz as Cinna...that was a stroke of genius! But every cast member is perfect for their roles and it was a pleasure watching all these extraordinarily talented actors work.  I appreciated the art direction as well and I liked that the costumers felt free enough not to be compelled to be so literal in their interpretation. The extras on the DVD were interesting also but was a little disappointed in their quality. They didn't add very much.  Possibly I was spoiled by the truly excellent extras in another of Gary Ross' films, Seabiscuit.

Sometimes a movie based on a book leaves giant plot holes and it's difficult to follow if you haven't read the book.  Other times a movie will try to stay true to a book but lose all creativity and excitement when translated onto film.  This movie doesn't fit either of these categories.  It is a complete story and beautifully crafted.Katniss is such a strong and unique heroine.  It's not often we get a strong female, who is portrayed full of flaws and strengths that are not lovable.  But you find yourself rooting for her.  She is the glue of the whole story.The best part of the movie is the way the Games are portrayed.  The sickening fascination and joy the Capital takes in having teenagers kill each other is portrayed in a way that is relatable to our own society.  The pain of many of the contestants is palpable and I was very moved when some of the contestants die.Another awesome part of the movie: the cast.  Jennifer Lawrence brings life to Katniss in a way that no one else could.  I wasn't sure I would like Josh Hutcherson as Peeta (because of my own ideas from the book) but he brought sensitivity and class to the part.  Liam Hemsworth is a sexy and strong Gale.  And the rest of the cast is absolutely spot on for each of their various roles: Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, etc. You couldn't ask for a better group of actors!Overall:  If you haven't seen this movie, do it.

The books were written for teenagers and I found all three of them to be lacking in the writing. I believe this came through in the film. The premise is one set in the future where the inhabitants of the country Panem must give up a small group of teens to compete in a fight to the death. The whole ordeal is televised to the nation as a game. The winner is allowed to live and treated as a hero. The whole reason for this game is a sacrifice to the country for a passed uprising against the central government. I don't understand why they call it the ""hunger games"" because the game has nothing to do with finding food or being hungry. Having said that, for free it was entertaining and passed the time. If you haven't read the books you may be a little confused during some flashbacks sequences wondering what the film is trying to show/tell you. Overall it's worth watching if you enjoy movies about futuristic societies and the way they subjugate their people.

1341324,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B003EYVXV4,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[20, 32]","MOVIE REVIEW #25: "" The Hunger Games ""Well....I'm going to be the only one to give this movie a not-so-nice review - I'm sure, but let me clarify I have NOT read the book and I am only basing my review on the entertainment value of the film - as a film. I have heard MANY times the book and the series itself is very good.First, I want to say Gary Ross, the director, of this film, has done some wonderful films like `Pleasantville' and 'Seabiscut' - as well as penning the movies `Big' and `Dave' (two of my favorite comedies) - so choosing him for this film might not have been the best choice.Secondly, the things that I liked about the film is - as he always does, the performance of both Stanley Tucci (Burlesque, Julie & Julia, Devil Wears Prada) and the MC of a modern times talk-show and Woody Harrelson (Cheers, Zombieland, 2012) as an extremist publicist for this barbaric game the future has set up. The two of them made the movie interesting and tolerable. The lead character, of the games, played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bones, X-Men: First Class) was extremely versatile in her character portrayal and her need to drive the movie forward - especially when she did a wonderful job with a smaller character (played by Amanda Stenberg of Columbiana) in her emotional connection of the games being a real threat and that winning means a lot more than surviving.Which leads me now to - Thirdly - why the film didn't work. First of all the film is shot literally in close-up. At one point I was wondering if these people had any legs or waistlines. An unusual choice for direction a big screen, big budget film....also, I guess we are all suppposed to be used to the NYPD Tv style that ended up being `Cloverfield'-like photography. The moment any action occurred the camera moved violently. It was hard ot follow action...who bit who...who killed who when...how...etc. Call me old school, but when I trained in film making - I was taught that movies were supposed to capture life cinematically....on sticks and stands (tripods)...to capture real (or fantasy-like) moments on film. I had to look away from the screen several times because like Cloverfield - it gave me a headache. It was too distracting for me to stay interested in those scenes...and there were many of them.The future capital is portrayed as this elaborate `empire-like' city with lots of color and style that is over-the-top but very colorful and creative, the costumes outside the district are imaginative and broad, but everything else is basic back-woodsy and what you would expect from a society that wared against itself and created 12 separate - gated and patrolled areas that you could be killed for if you attempted to leave them.The concept of sacrificing your young in a lottery as promise of `hope' for the poor - as the then President states (Played quietly by Donald Southerland of Invasion of the Body Snatcher and Commander In Chief) - makes for an interesting society that evolved from a civil war her in the US states. High concept idea - but a low concept executive of the film for me. And, the script has the rule makers changing the rules as the game progresses...to me, unjustifiably for the story - especially since these `Hunger Games' have been running for 74 years.The film was slow in parts and it also has some things that you are expected to `suspend your disbelief' with no real logic, explanation or purpose. I have to believe the book explains more and justifies some of the actions both the game players and the game makers do.So for my money...I would wait for the DVD, Cable or Netflix....I had no expectations going in other than - what all the `buzz' was regarding this great book - which as I write this - I am absolutely sure is better than this film. My suggestion , don't read the book first...you'll probably be disappointed in the film.",2,Not Such A Big Deal....I'm Sure The Book Is Better!,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,3863,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '25', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Well', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'give', 'movie', 'not-so-nice', 'review', ""'m"", 'sure', 'let', 'clarify', 'have', 'NOT', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'only', 'basing', 'review', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'film', 'have', 'heard', 'MANY', 'times', 'book', 'series', 'very', 'good.First', 'want', 'say', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'director', 'film', 'done', 'wonderful', 'films', 'Pleasantville', ""'Seabiscut"", 'as', 'well', 'penning', 'movies', 'Big', 'Dave', 'two', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'so', 'choosing', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'choice.Secondly', 'things', 'liked', 'film', 'always', 'performance', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Burlesque', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'MC', 'modern', 'times', 'talk-show', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Cheers', 'Zombieland', '2012', 'extremist', 'publicist', 'barbaric', 'game', 'future', 'set', 'up', 'two', 'made', 'movie', 'interesting', 'tolerable', 'lead', 'character', 'games', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Winter', 'Bones', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'was', 'extremely', 'versatile', 'character', 'portrayal', 'need', 'drive', 'movie', 'forward', 'especially', 'when', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'smaller', 'character', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Stenberg', 'Columbiana', 'emotional', 'connection', 'games', 'being', 'real', 'threat', 'winning', 'lot', 'more', 'surviving.Which', 'now', 'Thirdly', 'why', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'First', 'film', 'shot', 'literally', 'close-up', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'wondering', 'people', 'had', 'legs', 'waistlines', 'unusual', 'choice', 'direction', 'big', 'screen', 'big', 'budget', 'film', '.also', 'guess', 'are', 'suppposed', 'be', 'used', 'NYPD', 'Tv', 'style', 'ended', 'up', 'being', ""Cloverfield'-like"", 'photography', 'moment', 'action', 'occurred', 'camera', 'moved', 'violently', 'was', 'hard', 'ot', 'follow', 'action', 'who', 'bit', 'who', 'who', 'killed', 'who', 'when', 'how', 'etc', 'Call', 'old', 'school', 'when', 'trained', 'film', 'making', 'was', 'taught', 'movies', 'were', 'supposed', 'capture', 'life', 'cinematically', '.on', 'sticks', 'stands', 'tripods', 'capture', 'real', 'fantasy-like', 'moments', 'film', 'had', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'several', 'times', 'Cloverfield', 'gave', 'headache', 'was', 'too', 'distracting', 'stay', 'interested', 'scenes', 'were', 'many', 'them.The', 'future', 'capital', 'portrayed', 'elaborate', 'empire-like', 'city', 'lots', 'color', 'style', 'over-the-top', 'very', 'colorful', 'creative', 'costumes', 'district', 'are', 'imaginative', 'broad', 'everything', 'else', 'basic', 'back-woodsy', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'society', 'wared', 'created', '12', 'separate', 'gated', 'patrolled', 'areas', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'attempted', 'leave', 'them.The', 'concept', 'sacrificing', 'young', 'lottery', 'promise', 'hope', 'poor', 'then', 'President', 'states', 'Played', 'quietly', 'Donald', 'Southerland', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatcher', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'interesting', 'society', 'evolved', 'civil', 'war', 'US', 'states', 'High', 'concept', 'idea', 'low', 'concept', 'executive', 'film', 'script', 'rule', 'makers', 'changing', 'rules', 'game', 'unjustifiably', 'story', 'especially', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'have', 'been', 'running', '74', 'years.The', 'film', 'was', 'slow', 'parts', 'also', 'things', 'are', 'expected', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'real', 'logic', 'explanation', 'purpose', 'have', 'believe', 'book', 'more', 'actions', 'game', 'players', 'game', 'makers', 'do.So', 'money', 'would', 'wait', 'DVD', 'Cable', 'Netflix', '.I', 'had', 'expectations', 'going', 'other', 'what', 'buzz', 'was', 'regarding', 'great', 'book', 'write', 'am', 'absolutely', 'sure', 'better', 'film', 'suggestion', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'first', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film']",N/A

I came across The Hunger Games one day while browsing through my Prime account, and well the previews looked appealing so I thought I&#8217;d give it a chance. The Greek based novel and plot of the movie seemed like excellent concepts, however, like many novel to movie stories much was lost in translation. From what I gather, if you haven&#8217;t read the book then it makes sense why the film doesn&#8217;t clearly develop Lawrence&#8217;s character and relationship to others in her district. Having said that, the movie is clear in establishing that there are 12 districts (each being known for one thing- Lawrence&#8217;s district is coal). Every year, each district sacrifices one male and female member between the ages of 12 and 18 to fight to the death until there&#8217;s only one standing.

The acting is mediocre, the only thing that saved it for me was Lenny Kravitz and the creative direction they&#8217;ve taken with costume, make-up and d&eacute;cor.

1341354,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B003EYVXV4,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1048, 1354]","""Hunger Games"" is certainly the best film I have seen since many many months, and it is a very successful adaptation of an excellent book.In my personal opinion, both the book and the film are much deeper and much more ambitious, than what most critics and reviewers would make us believe. After reading the reviews in ""New York Times"", ""Le Monde"" and on ""Msn.com"" (to cite only few) I was surprised that they mostly missed everything that is important in this film. With a kind of amused superiority, which people from Capitol in this movie would immediately recognize, the ""professional"" reviewers pointed at the obvious allusions to gladiator fights, the reality shows, the importance of trashy entertainment in today's TV, the search for a new franchise able to replace ""Twilight"", etc., etc.But they almost entirely failed to see, that this film is first and above all about much more important things: how to keep hope, not lose the courage and preserve humanity and dignity under a totalitarian oppressive regime.I believe that almost everybody now knows that when writing ""Hunger Games"" Susan Collins attempted basically a modern (even futurist) retelling of the old Greek myth of Theseus and Minotaur. According to this ancient tale, after losing a war, every year the city of Athens had to send a tribute of seven young men and seven maidens to the king of Crete. Once there the young people were locked in the Labyrinth, to be devoured by the monster Minotaur. This yearly punishment and humiliation lasted until Theseus, crown prince of Athens, volunteered to be one of the tributes and once locked in the Labyrinth he defeated and killed the Minotaur.In ""Hunger Games"" what was once United States (and I think also Canada) is now called the Panem. It is a country divided in twelve Districts remaining under the control of the Capitol central metropolis. There was once thirteen Districts, but when they rebelled against the central power, the Capitol destroyed completely the District 13 with all its population and then defeated and submitted again the twelve others. In order to remind to its subjects how absolute is its power, the Capitol claims a yearly tribute - one girl and one boy of ages from 12 to 18 from every District. The tributes are then send to an arena and forced to fight, until only one remain alive. This yearly event is called the Hunger Games and it is shown live on TV to all the population of Panem. This film tells the story of what happened at the 74th edition of Hunger Games...For Capitol the purpose of Hunger Games is to remind yearly how powerful is the central metropolis and how dire can be the consequences of its wrath, but also - and even more importantly in my opinion - to humiliate and degrade the people of the Districts by forcing them to become accomplices (even if under duress) of a barbarian custom in which some of their own children are send to the slaughterhouse. And as all bullies and abusers know, it is much easier to oppress, abuse and brutalize victims who lack self-esteem...Well, in this film we can see how one of the tributes from District 12, an exceptionnal young girl named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), manages to turn the tables on the Capitol and by allowing people of Panem to regain some of their dignity she will be the pebble which starts the avalanche. The exact way in which she does that will not be revealed here, but both in the book as in the film it is described in a very intelligent and very moving way...This may seem a rather improbable thing that a 16 years old child can do something that will ultimately bring down a seemingly invincible and all-powerful tyranny, but let's not forget that in the real world, the great wave of revolutions of Arab Spring began on 18 December 2010 with a desperate gesture of a dirt-poor 27-years old Tunisian street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, who set himself on fire after having been robbed and beaten by the corrupt local police one time too much... Less than two years after, the opressive regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya already collapsed, the seemingly invulnerable dictator of Yemen had to resign and the Syrian brutal regime is facing a massive armed rebellion..Bottom line, this film is first and before all a story about how even a seemingly powerless person can horribly hurt a tyrannic regime with a magic potion made of lots of courage, an ice-cold determination, a great personal dignity, a little compassion, a handful of flowers, a couple of tears and one defiant and powerful gesture...The powerful message and excellent scenario are not the only reasons why I consider ""Hunger Games"" as a masterpiece. Actors were selected very carefully and they perform well. Jennifer Lawrence is simply perfect - there is no other word to describe her performance! However, after seeing her in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""X-Men: First class"" I didn't expect anything less.But the real surprise in this film comes from Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta Mellark, the boy tribute from District 12. His character is more difficult to play, because Peeta is in the same time more limited but also more complicated than Katniss. Josh Hutcherson could have very easily fall in one of the many traps which are build in Peeta's character. By overacting or underacting he could have make him a wimp or a passive follower or an immature kid, but he avoided those snares with grace and his Peeta comes out of this film as a surprisingly complexe and also a very likeable character. He is certainly not a hero and a fighter like Katniss - but until the very end he preserves his honor, in a deadly place where he shouldn't ever be send...A special mention goes to little Amandla Stenberg, who plays 12-years old Rue, the youngest of all the tributes. Her character is both secondary and in the same time incredibly important - and this little cute pixie played it perfectly!Other, more known actors contribute to the success of this film. Woody Harrelson is excellent as Haymitch, the only person from District 12 who ever won in the Hunger Games and is now an advisor to Katniss and Peeta. Lenny Kravitz portrayed a perfect Cinna, the man in charge of image of tributes from District 12 in public appearances before the games begin. And finally there is the giant figure of Donald Sutherland, who plays the supreme ruler of Panem, President Coriolanus Snow. He is purely incredible. There is a moment in this film when he says to somebody ""I like you"" - and I believe that I have never heard such a terrible and deadly threat in one short sentence since the archifamous Schwarzenegger's ""I will be back""...I also absolutely adored the using of the cameras. In some moments of this film we have the impression of going after the characters with a camera, like a war correspondent following the fighters (this style was also very skillfully used in ""The Shield"" series). Of course not all the film is turned in this way, but mixing this kind of scenes with more conventional ones gives here an excellent effect.The games themselves are very skillfully described and are a very dramatic tale, full of surprises and twists. I found them much much better than ""Battle Royale"", to which this book and film are often compared. The games are deadly and brutal, but there is only limited gore - I think this film is suitable for young teenagers, although not for children younger than 12. There is also absolutely no nudity, sex or strong language and I for one found it a most excellent thing.There are still many more good things to say about this film, but I believe you should discover them by yourself. One more thing however about the book - it is of course possible to see and greatly enjoy this film without reading the book, but I believe that reading the novel first is a good idea. If reading the whole book is out of question, I would advise to read at least the first hundred pages. It will not reveal much about the games themselves, but it will allow for a better understanding of some of the key elements: the strength of the bond between Katniss and her younger sister, the history that Katniss shares with her hunting partner Gale, the complicated relation between Katniss and her mother and last but not least, the mysterious bond existing between Katniss and Peeta Mellark.About this last point: if you did not yet read the book I do not want to spoil the pleasure of discovery so I will say just this - Katniss and Peeta lived for 16 years in the same village, but they never spoke one to another (except for an occasional ""Hello"") and they never touched one another in any way. And still, they share a secret as big as life and death, a secret which both bonded them together and in the same time separated them deeply... If you want to know the solution of this riddle you have either to watch very very carefully every scene of the film or simply read the book...Conclusion: this film is a masterpiece! I loved it and I am going to buy the DVD as soon as it is available. And I am SOOO going to see the the second part, as soon as it opens!",5,"A masterpiece!

1341356,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B003EYVXV4,MadMacs,"[6, 10]","One of the perquisites of not being a fanboy/girl is impartiality. I don't have anything invested in the written works, the actors, or the viability of the franchise. In fact, until I read that this was the heir apparent, supplanting the vampires as reigning teen icons and representing a film for their generation - I had never heard of the term, the books or the author. All I have is what the film presented and delivered.If you haven't yet read the source novels, in essence: Nearly three-quarters of a century have passed since a terrible war. And the victors have set a terrible condition for the defeated. As a constant reminder and warning to never again rebel - they're forced to make an annual tribute - once a year they have to offer up their children as sacrifice. The rebellion encompassed twelve regions or zones, and from each zone one boy and one girl are selected by random drawing. The twenty-four youths, between the ages of 12-16, are then trained as warriors. After which, they're sent into a staged arena where only one survivor can emerge from the proscribed game enclosure. Fight to the death, kill all the others, and the sole remaining child is allowed to live.The passage of years has seen the game transform from punitive reminder into populist spectacle - where millions cheer, gamble and watch the children battle with one another using blades, explosives, and a variety of primitive weapons. State sanctioned bloodsport has now become the all-time favorite reality televised program.Unfortunately, the plot holes were numerous and the film dragged in many places. But I was willing to ignore most of the minor failings in favor of enjoying the tale, which is essentially a revised take on the original 'Rollerball' story by Jewison and Harrison.And star Jennifer Lawrence made the most of the role. I'm appreciative that the producers didn't go for an actress that was just 'pretty'. I understand several such physically attractive performers were considered for the job. Thankfully, they selected a young woman whom I would categorize as a simple beauty - beautiful beyond the superficial, of which there seems to be an sad unending supply in Hollywood.Overall, this wasn't bad, just pedestrian. I hope the producers hire a more appropriate director or guide the current one with more input from actual 'hunters', helping to sidestep tropes and errors of the genre which Director Gary Ross did not or could not avoid for this first installment in the series. See below for movie recommendations.Minor irks:- Very odd editing. If this is a television show, the producer didn't seem particularly concerned in keeping the flow of action steady, allowing ludicrous periods of inactivity. Today in 2012, never mind the future, audiences are notably impatient and click-happy; it's extremely difficult to imagine they would wait around for hours, even days at a time, for anything to happen. And equally strange, Director Ross seemed to disconnect the audience itself as a participant in the drama - rarely showing the effect as various players were eliminated or victorious. Just very odd.- The training sequence was wholly inadequate, almost laughable. Clearly, Ross didn't hire a proper advisor. Simply adding a SpecOps veteran or a primitive skills instructor to his staff would've immeasurably helped that important sequence. Or he could've have just as easily watched something like 'G.I. Jane' or 'Barabbas' to see how this should've been done. A definite missed opportunity for kickass-ness. Really unfortunate.- Without any background to draw upon, the film's premise left out quite a bit of history - a plot hole that I suspect could've easily been covered with just a few more sentences during the intro. My guess, based entirely on the opening scenes, was a Second Civil War - with the 'Union' forces less forgiving the second time 'round.

1341391,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003EYVXV4,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","It would seem that making a movie based on a successful series of books would be an easy thing but that's not the case. To begin with there is the task of bringing the entire story that most would read over a period of say a week and turning it into a something that takes a little over 2 hours. Then there are the fans. When you have a book as popular as THE HUNGER GAMES, those fans can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Everyone has their favorite thing about the book they love and not all will make it to the final product. Fans that have yet to see the movie should know there are changes but that the movie is still wonderful.The story takes place in the future where after a tumultuous war the continent has been divided into districts. Each district is responsible for its own product which for the most part is taken to the Capitol. As a tribute and a reminder of their defeat by those in the Capitol a yearly competition is held called the Hunger Games. A boy and girl, ages 12-18, are selected from each district. They are wined, dined and trained for a few days then set free in an area designated for the games. The way to win is to kill the other 23 contestants.The focus of the story revolves around Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman who hunts illegally to keep her family fed and taken care of. This year is the first that her young sister Prim must enter her name. The odds are against her name being drawn but when it is, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the son of the local baker. The two are allowed their goodbyes to friends and family and then whisked away to the Capitol.On their train trip to the Capitol both Katniss and Peeta are given instruction from their two mentors. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) is the prim and proper example of what the Capitol is all about: excess in nearly every area and blindly obedient to the President (Donald Sutherland). Their other mentor, clearly the better of the two, is Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson). Haymitch is a past winner who has knowledge of the games first hand. He also drinks non-stop in an effort to get through the knowledge that perhaps these two might not make it home again.With the story set up we get to the Capitol and witness the transformation of Katniss and Peeta from backwoods teens whose names were drawn to contestants who must not only be physically fit but must win the favor of viewers and wealthy sponsors who can help them with gifts throughout the games. It is their best chance for survival but Katniss hates the games and what they represent. Still, several incidents occur that win her favor in some circles.The day arrives and the contestants are set free to do bodily harm to one another. Backpacks with special equipment are left for them to take if they can avoid being stabbed or worse by other contestants. As the person with the best skills and chance of surviving, Katniss sets out to find a way to win taking as few lives as possible. When the rules are changed to allow both competitors from each district survive as a team, she must find Peeta who proclaimed his love for her during a pre-game interview. Together they might have a chance to make it out of the Hunger Games alive.Movie fans of the film BATTLE ROYALE will raise a stink that this film has taken its idea from that one. Nothing could be further from the truth. While the battling teens are similar, the way the games are handled is much different. But more important is the story of Katniss who changes as she makes her way through the games. Cold and hard at first, she comes to find romance and a caring soul among those she fights next to and against. It is a coming of age story that shows a young woman forced to reach maturity beyond her years.The movie has a great look stretching from the coal mining scenes that form the world of District 12 where Katniss is from to the over-glamorized appearance of the Capitol. These are two different worlds on the same planet and the reactions of Peeta and Katniss show that they've never seen anything outside their front door. It doesn't mean that they admire this new world; they just recognize it is different.The acting is straight forward here. No one seems to be hamming it up or overplaying their roles. Each one comes across as the person they are here to represent which would seem easier for lesser known actors and much more difficult for those who are seasoned professionals. All included in this film turn in admirable jobs.Knowing that the books are a trilogy one could be afraid that the end of this film would leave you hanging on the edge, waiting for the next. Don't be afraid. This movie would stand on its own if it had to. But once you become a fan my guess is you'll anxiously anticipate the next or perhaps you'll begin reading the books. In any event, THE HUNGER GAMES is a movie that will have you thinking, talking with friends and considering the implications. And more than anything it will entertain you.",4,THE GAMES WIN,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,5046,"['would', 'seem', 'making', 'movie', 'based', 'successful', 'series', 'books', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'thing', 'not', 'case', 'begin', 'task', 'bringing', 'entire', 'story', 'most', 'would', 'read', 'period', 'say', 'week', 'turning', 'something', 'little', '2', 'hours', 'Then', 'are', 'fans', 'When', 'have', 'book', 'as', 'popular', 'THE', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'fans', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Everyone', 'favorite', 'thing', 'book', 'love', 'not', 'will', 'make', 'final', 'product', 'Fans', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'should', 'know', 'are', 'changes', 'movie', 'still', 'wonderful.The', 'story', 'place', 'future', 'where', 'tumultuous', 'war', 'continent', 'been', 'divided', 'districts', 'district', 'responsible', 'own', 'product', 'most', 'part', 'taken', 'Capitol', 'tribute', 'reminder', 'defeat', 'Capitol', 'yearly', 'competition', 'held', 'called', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'boy', 'girl', '12-18', 'are', 'selected', 'district', 'are', 'wined', 'dined', 'trained', 'few', 'days', 'then', 'set', 'free', 'area', 'designated', 'games', 'way', 'win', 'kill', 'other', '23', 'contestants.The', 'focus', 'story', 'around', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'illegally', 'keep', 'family', 'fed', 'taken', 'care', 'year', 'first', 'young', 'sister', 'Prim', 'must', 'enter', 'name', 'odds', 'are', 'name', 'being', 'drawn', 'when', 'Katniss', 'take', 'place', 'boy', 'chosen', 'Peeta', 'Mellark', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'son', 'local', 'baker', 'two', 'are', 'allowed', 'goodbyes', 'friends', 'family', 'then', 'whisked', 'away', 'Capitol.On', 'train', 'trip', 'Capitol', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'are', 'given', 'instruction', 'two', 'mentors', 'Effie', 'Trinket', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'prim', 'proper', 'example', 'what', 'Capitol', 'excess', 'nearly', 'area', 'blindly', 'obedient', 'President', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'other', 'mentor', 'clearly', 'better', 'two', 'Haymitch', 'Abernathy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Haymitch', 'past', 'winner', 'who', 'knowledge', 'games', 'first', 'hand', 'also', 'non-stop', 'effort', 'get', 'knowledge', 'perhaps', 'two', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'home', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'get', 'Capitol', 'witness', 'transformation', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'backwoods', 'teens', 'names', 'were', 'drawn', 'contestants', 'who', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'physically', 'fit', 'must', 'win', 'favor', 'viewers', 'wealthy', 'sponsors', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'gifts', 'games', 'best', 'chance', 'survival', 'Katniss', 'games', 'what', 'represent', 'Still', 'several', 'incidents', 'occur', 'win', 'favor', 'circles.The', 'day', 'arrives', 'contestants', 'are', 'set', 'free', 'do', 'bodily', 'harm', 'one', 'Backpacks', 'special', 'equipment', 'are', 'left', 'take', 'can', 'avoid', 'being', 'stabbed', 'worse', 'other', 'contestants', 'person', 'best', 'skills', 'chance', 'surviving', 'Katniss', 'out', 'find', 'way', 'win', 'taking', 'few', 'lives', 'possible', 'When', 'rules', 'are', 'changed', 'allow', 'competitors', 'district', 'survive', 'team', 'must', 'find', 'Peeta', 'who', 'proclaimed', 'love', 'pre-game', 'interview', 'Together', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'make', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'alive.Movie', 'fans', 'film', 'BATTLE', 'ROYALE', 'will', 'raise', 'stink', 'film', 'taken', 'idea', 'one', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'battling', 'teens', 'are', 'similar', 'way', 'games', 'are', 'handled', 'much', 'different', 'more', 'important', 'story', 'Katniss', 'who', 'way', 'games', 'Cold', 'hard', 'first', 'find', 'romance', 'caring', 'soul', 'fights', 'next', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'forced', 'reach', 'maturity', 'years.The', 'movie', 'great', 'look', 'stretching', 'coal', 'mining', 'scenes', 'form', 'world', 'District', '12', 'where', 'Katniss', 'over-glamorized', 'appearance', 'Capitol', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'same', 'planet', 'reactions', 'Peeta', 'Katniss', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'front', 'door', ""n't"", 'mean', 'admire', 'new', 'world', 'just', 'recognize', 'different.The', 'acting', 'straight', 'forward', 'here', 'one', 'be', 'hamming', 'up', 'overplaying', 'roles', 'one', 'person', 'are', 'here', 'represent', 'would', 'seem', 'easier', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'who', 'are', 'seasoned', 'professionals', 'included', 'film', 'turn', 'admirable', 'jobs.Knowing', 'books', 'are', 'trilogy', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'afraid', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'leave', 'hanging', 'edge', 'waiting', 'next', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'movie', 'would', 'stand', 'own', 'had', 'once', 'become', 'fan', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'anxiously', 'anticipate', 'next', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'reading', 'books', 'event', 'THE', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'talking', 'friends', 'considering', 'implications', 'more', 'anything', 'will', 'entertain']",N/A

1341412,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B003EYVXV4,maskedgamer,"[2, 13]","and it was called ""Battle Royale"".I just want to say I stand firm on my opinion and review of this movie despite the barrage of spiteful and extremely petty down votes from over obsessive fans of this series looking to smite anyone who has something other than praise to give this adolescent film.I completely loved Battle Royale as it was an amazing and unbelievably good movie. It's hard to watch this and not see the similarities and also knowing that Battle Royale came out 10 years before this movie or book was even thought of. I didn't exactly buy into the hype of this movie because of so and actually took my time before deciding to sit down and watch it for the first time. This movie I think was just a bunch of hype the same as Black Swan and all those others than pop up out of no where and all of a sudden seem to capture the attention of the box office. Maybe it's one of those pictures where the book is different and much better but as a movie this one feels overly long and quite boring in a lot of parts. If you've seen Battle Royale or have not, you should definitely watch it. It goes into detail about the things this movie skimps over and explores the characters on a much deeper level. Watching The hunger games I felt I was watching almost like a B-movie rip off of Battle Royale, or how can I put it... it's a lot more toned down and that's which kills the shock value of the story. I think this is one of those movies you only enjoy if you've read the book and get to see it come alive. As for me it just didn't cut it especially since I've seen this done before only better with a much better plot. I'm sure there's die hard fanatics for ""The hunger games"" but if you've never seen ""Battle Royale"" than you really are just praising a false idol.What makes this movie even more painstaking to watch is that it is long and not very engaging. I found myself pausing the video and running off to do other tasks, and then coming back to it. The movie just seemed to go on and on and on dragging out scenes forever and then having the nerve to give you one of those open endings. This movie is over 2 hours long and the story hardly has any real dialogue to it. You'll find yourself more mesmerized by trying to figure out the ridiculous fashions of this futuristic world. To me that was the more interesting part to watch especially the awkwardly shaped beard of one of the head figure characters. What also struck me was the character Rue and the uproar about the casting for that character. I couldn't believe how nasty people were over the casting of a cute little girl to play her character that basically only had a couple of lines to say. I mean I think if you blinked you'd miss her role in this movie. It really goes to show just how petty certain people can be over absolutely nothing (probably some of these people randomly down voting reviews). Especially in the case of a movie where the race of characters was never described. The biggest surprise was seeing Lenny Kravitz in the film. I didn't even know he was in to acting but his character was random enough so whatever.The one thing I think that really hurt this movie the most was the lack of explanation in the film. The state of the society is never really explained. Why there are 12 districts and all of them are basically low class working districts and the city is lush and rich is never explained. What the ""hunger"" part about the entire game/story is about. They only hint at a scene where the main character is starving in flash backs or surprised to get a piece of bread from a friend saying ""is this real"" but that's all you get. No explanation at all as to why these districts are basically laborers that provide necessities for the well to do but live in poverty themselves. Just from the hints and I mean very few hints in the movie the children fighting all come from these repressed low class labor societies where they are picked at random to fight in these games and chosen to be the victor (btw that plot is never explained you have to piece it together yourself throughout the entire movie). It looked like the participating districts were rewarded with food or something if I saw correctly in the riots (also unexplained) but whatever. This is just a bad movie for lots of reasons but mostly for not explaining things that should be explained like the background for the story at least. There is just a simple clip shown in the movie about a war and the games sort of being like the Olympics to show that courage and strength still exists (yeah, still very pointless).Here's where Battle Royale does everything so much better. The plot of a group of students being forcefully captured by the government and thrown into a Military war/social project called ""The Program"". The kids are handed weapons and supplies at random and told only one of them can survive and they have to kill all of their classmates if they want to make it home alive. The kids don't really understand what is going on (not even the bombs/tracking devices) around their neck. They at first are hesitant to participate in the game but when others start killing each other it suddenly becomes a game of instinct and survival. Some of the kids form social pacts to survive, some like to survive alone, and some just enjoy killing whomever they can find, and some just refuse to participate and try to find another way out. Battle Royale does the story better because its almost like a study of human survival. You get a chance to learn about the background on the characters and their relationship to the other characters which is what makes seeing one of them die or get killed more personal. You don't get to explore any other characters in The Hunger Games but the two main characters ""Bow girl"" and ""Guy who is useless"". There's also Rue who character depth includes ""These are Mocking Jays we use them to signal time in my district"" and that's about as much as you get. For a 2.5hr movie I find The Hunger Games to be extremely vague in a lot of areas it shouldn't be.So basically overall... if you want to see a GOOD movie about Young adults being forced to kill other young adults watch Battle Royale.",1,I've seen this movie before only done better...,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,6190,"['was', 'called', 'Battle', 'Royale', '.I', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'stand',

1341413,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B003EYVXV4,maskirovka,"[1, 2]","I thought ""the Hunger Games"" was a pretty good flick...good enough to buy on DVD and to read the books (which I think are fantastic).From just watching the movie, I agree that the movie draws on a lot of different sources for plot:-""The Lord of the Flies"" (William Golding) (children killing or trying to kill each other in a wild place)Lord of the Flies-""The Running Man"" (Stephen King) (a game show centering around people killing each other)The Running Man-""The Truman Show"" (a whole ""world"" being created for the purpose of a ""reality"" show)The Truman Show-""The Lottery"" (Shirley Jackson) (a drawing to determine who will be ""sacrificed"")The Lottery-""The Most Dangerous Game"" (Richard Connell) (a life and death contest where people hunt each other in the forest)The Most Dangerous Game-""Battle Royale"" (Koushun Takami) a Japanese novel which has students being forced to fight each other to the deathBattle Royale-""The Naked Prey"" (a great ""being hunted in the wilderness"" movie starring Cornel Wilde)The Naked PreyNorth Korea (because the country is rather the same as Panem in that you have a rich ""capitol"" and impoverished outlying regions...kind of like Pyongyang)Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea""Rollerball"" (the 1975 version...where a brutal bloodsport serves a political purpose)Rollerball""Schindler's List"" (not so much because of the plot but more the style of scene where the ""reaping"" takes place...it reminded me of the scene where all the Jews arrived in the Cracow Ghetto)Schindler's List (Universal's 100th Anniversary)So it's pretty obvious that ""the Hunger Games"" is not exactly original.  But that doesn't mean it's plagiarism and it certainly doesn't mean it's not a good story.  Let's face it, human beings have been coming up with stories for thousands of years...I suspect there are very few truly original ones left to be discovered.And sometimes, a derivative work can be ""creation"" because it synthesizes old things in a new and satisfying way.  That's what ""the Hunger Games"" does.  It's just a good story with:-Jennifer Lawrence doing well as Katniss, the melancholy but brave heroine-a good turn by Stanley Tucci as the smarmy ""talk show host"" in the story-some excellent action sequences and special effects-a very interesting rendition of ""the Capitol"" and its garishly attired and styled inhabitants-Woody Harrelson playing an interesting winner of the games who helps Katniss (proving that while Harrelson is a lunatic, he can act)-a poignant and believable conclusionThe story does have some holes in the plot...&lt;spoilers>1.  I find myself wondering whether the professional tributes would form the alliances that they did in the story.  Given the fact that there can only be one winner, I think in real life people would be afraid to turn their backs on each other.2.  The story sort of came to an abrupt end ""forced"" more or less by the introduction of the CGI dogs.  I just didn't think they belonged in the story or looked too convincing.(Having read the books, I know now that mutant critters were a principal weapon of the Capitol but I think they need to improve these creations for the future movies).3.  I had a sort of similar reaction to the landmines.  Given that the tributes weren't allowed to have firearms, it was kind of odd that they had anti-personnel mines, and I thought the idea that Katniss would be able to detonate them by shooting open a bag of fruit was a bit contrived.4.  The way the Hunger Games ran did not make much sense as an event a lot of people would take interest in.-It would seem like that having kids as young as 12 competing against those 18 years old would be kind of stupid.  If you had a smaller age range, the tributes would be more evenly matched and that would make better ""entertainment.""-I couldn't see people tuning into watching more than a ""highlights"" reel of the Hunger Games, given the fact that a huge amount of what took place in the forest would hardly be cinematic.  I think watching it would be akin to watching all of the OJ Simpson murder trial in terms of being excruciatingly boring.5.  The scene early in the games where Katniss got ""treed"" by the career trackers (and Peeta) showed the career trackers with the bow and arrows came awfully close to hitting her twice, and then they just gave up?  Why wouldn't they have kept on shooting at her (in the book, that problem was taken care of with making the careers hopeless with the bow).6.  Josh Hutcherson does a good job playing Peeta, but I think they should not have him shown in the future movies with his hair combed back because he looked so different (at least to me) that I was confused at first if this was a different character.&lt;spoilers end>But all of these plot holes don't sink ""the Hunger Games.""  It's a good solid piece of entertainment that has more heart and soul than most action flicks, and I figure when the next installment rolls out next November, I'll go see it.",4,"Sort of Cross Between

I myself did not read the books and I was seriously underwhelmed.I will say that a magnanimous effort was made in creating this universe!  Costumes, architecture, ethics & psyche of the characters, zeitgeist, everything.  Think, The Golden Compass - that grand of a scale.  Having said that, most of the story was easily predictable and there were gaping holes in plot development that left me sitting there asking, ""but why?"" and all my questions remained unanswered until I could speak to someone that read the books.Although I'm sure the rest of the world saw this before I did, I will be sensitive to spoilers.  Even the commercial explains the elevator-pitch: The Hunger Games are a televised ""The Running Man"" style event where a large group of teenagers are drop-shipped onto an ""island-sized"" Thunderdome to murder each other.  So, you have to be into seeing a group of 13-19 year old children murder each other - I was not.  Also, be prepared to see our hero, Katniss, to be either asleep in a tree or otherwise unconscious for approximately 4 days!  Yawn.  Once she joins the movie, all plot points are visible from a mile a way.Jennifer Lawrence is a talented young lady, but Josh Hutcherson acts circles around her every step of the way.  There are some plot points that, as an actress, she simply could not express.  Suffice it to say that Katniss' internal thought process involved things to do:1. to survive the players2. to deceive the audience3. to deceive Peeta4. manipulate the producers5. to remain true to herselfA brutal chunk of acting for anyone - but Lawrence never came close.  All of the character motivation that I found was driven by props and dialog, and that was massively insufficient to explain what was really going on.  Again, I had to ask friends who read the book.  Then I had to read the Wikipedia page!Look for a surprising performance by Lenny Kravitz!  He is great at connecting the audience with the characters in the movie.  It is hard to explain, he is surrounded by VERY over-the-top personalities that I could not relate to - but I connected with him as someone that sees this universe the way I (the audience member) sees it.Bottom line.

1341418,A4UM5DS14TSCO,B003EYVXV4,Matthew Warner,"[9, 18]","The Hunger Games movie would have been a great adaptation of the novel by Suzanne Collins if not for the excessive use of the hand-held ""shaky-cam"" technique. Why don't we call shaky cam for what it is? Vomit cam.Maybe I'm just an old fogey and prefer the stable-cam cinematic style of True Blood. Is it too much to ask that I can see what's happening on screen and not just a blurry swoosh of color?I'm not alone in these criticisms:The amount of dramatic shaky-cam in this movie is excessive. Multiple times I had to look away from the screen. The final fight, in particular, was almost impossible to follow. Shaky-cam + quick cuts + fast-paced fight scene + darkness = very hard to see.-- Panels on PagesThe Hunger Shaky-Cam Games -- I have just returned from watching a film about an epic romantic triangle between a director, his editing suite, and the shaky-cam that he couldn't resist.-- Robyn PatersonThat last reviewer went on to make a comparison worth reading: ""It's a good technique in moderation, and like any spice can really bring out the flavour of the film it's used in. But, just like ginger or pepper, if you use too much of it, the receiver won't be able to taste anything except the spice in question.""Exactly. While I don't object to the use of shaky cam per se -- I mean, it was an effective technique, like, once, in The Blair Witch Project -- it's just one tool in a director's tool belt and should not be used at the exclusion of all else.Remember 300? Lots of gorgeous comic-booky scenes of Spartans flying through the air with their swords. But every single spear throw and sword swing was turned into a slow-motion shot. Every. Single. One. (Or at least, that's what it felt like.)They're silly affectations by artistes. Gary Ross, director of The Hunger Games, admits as much in an interview:Q:  Let's talk about the look of this movie. You employed a lot of shaky handheld, and there aren't a lot of wide shots. How did you come up with that approach?A:  Well, I mean, I tried to do what the book did.Oh, come on.Q:  Because the book is told in the first person?A:  Yeah, it's a very urgent first-person narrative. I tried to put you in Katniss's shoes the way [author] Suzanne Collins put you in Katniss's shoes. I wanted to take you through the world using this kind of serpentine tunnel vision that Katniss has. I want to destabilize you the way Suzanne has and I want you to experience the world through Katniss's eyes, and that requires a very subjective cinematic style, to be kind of urgently in her point of view, so that's why I shot it that way.Let's see. That was effective, like, twice in the whole movie. Say, when Katniss rises up through the tunnel into the arena and is blinded by sunlight, and later when she is poisoned by genetically-engineered wasps. Those were the only two times when a point-of-view cam was arguably effective. The rest of the times, it was used to cover up possibly poor fight choreography (at least that's what I have to assume since I couldn't even see the damn fights through the smearing gloss of vomit cam) and a hundred other things. Maybe I should've taken a cue from my wife and just closed my eyes and listened.What a tragedy that is, because The Hunger Games was otherwise a brilliantly executed movie. The writing was good (due, no doubt, to Suzanne Collins herself being one of the screenplay writers), the costuming was gorgeous, the acting was great, the makeup was great, the special effects were great. But it was ruined by a director who wanted to leave his tripod at home. What a shame.To make an analogy, this goes back to a basic production value I have in my own prose writing. The reader should not be aware of the fact he is reading. Readers want to be transported away into their imaginations. To escape, just for a moment, the physical reality of their lives, to forget about the press of bodies around them on the subway, the screaming baby in the next room. So I strive to make my prose invisible. This means active sentence structure, an absence of flowery language, and simple to nonexistent dialogue tags. The cardinal sin is to step in front of the movie camera, so to speak, and wave at the reader, just to remind them that I am the artiste who created the thing they're trying to enjoy.

It was about a bunch of book geeks getting their book turned into a movie.  I think this movie falls into the same phenomenon as the Twilight series (whatever all that is really about).What's funny is a movie like Battleship gets such a horrible rating, but people are trying to call this a movie of the year?  It's hilarious.  I liked the actors, their acting was exceptional at times, the story was timid and very horribly written screenplay felt too overproduced.  It fell short on believability, things were just weirdly random and seemed to have very little reason other than to be part of the visual experience. The pacing was pretty decent for most of it.I'm very generous when it comes to movies.  I tend to go in having no expectations and come out at least somewhat pleased.  I went in without any expectations and came out displeased.  I was wondering what the point to even having the movie was.  Oh, to celebrate a book that's probably popular for good reason.Maybe there needs to be a 3 or 4 hour directors cut.  I don't know.  What I saw on the big screen can stay there.

1341427,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B003EYVXV4,M. Bullions,"[1, 3]","The very point of young adult literature is to give the few young individuals with an interest in reading, a world to immerse themselves in, and a character or two to root for, who will hopefully teach them a thing or two about the world they live in, and hopefully, about themselves. Such a character should be a role model for these young people. In 2012, we are left with no more ""Harry Potter"" films to be made. The ""Twilight"" series, which has albeit made a great deal of money, doesn't quite cut it for those of us who expect something more from our moviegoing experience.""The Hunger Games"" has it all: a wonderful slew of characters, an unfamiliar and interesting world, real problems to overcome, not to mention a star-making performance by Jennifer Lawrence. One major problem that I find in the ""Twilight"" series lies in the lack of role models for young women reading them. Bella Swan is an idiot. She relies on men for every single thing she does, and doesn't change and become her own person over the course of the four books, ultimately becoming the epitome of anti-feminism, in this viewer's eyes.Having said that, ""The Hunger Games"" is something of a godsend. Katniss Everdeen is headstrong, brutal, resourceful, witty, uncannily smart and a truly original personality. She knows when to back down, yet she knows when to take charge. She is an ideal role model for young people who will undoubtedly approach the film.""The Hunger Games"" takes place in the post-apocalyptic region of Panem, divided into twelve ""districts"". Once a year, an Olympics-style event takes place where one young man and woman from each of the twelve districts is forced to take part in a fight to the death on national television, where only one contestant can survive. A member of working-class District 12, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) takes her young sister's place after she has somehow been chosen in her first year of eligibility. Katniss has essentially raised her sister, with a mother who has been useless ever since the father's death. She learns to put her knowledge to good use, becomes something of a badass in her quest to above all else, stay alive.Like I mentioned, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, is a revelation. She clearly knew the character she was playing. While her performance is strong and ever-commanding, the character of Katniss was never permitted to let her true emotions show, and Lawrence obviously understood that. She couldn't have been better. Josh Hutcherson does a good enough job as Peeta, the other contestant from District 12, who becomes a good friend to Katniss; and possibly a love interest? We'll let the next film in the trilogy tackle that.The film has a tremendous supporting cast, including Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, the often-inebriated mentor to Katniss and Peeta, ""30 Rock""`s Elizabeth Banks as the loud and flamboyant Effie, Donald Sutherland as the country's president, and the always-great Stanley Tucci, as Caesar.My only gripe lies with director Gary Ross, who has previously directed ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Pleasantville"". His shaky camerawork works in scenes where we're seeing events from a character's perspective, especially when the ""games"", themselves, begin. However, shaky handheld camerawork is present, even in scenes where only two characters are having a conversation. Why? It's distracting, and should have been done differently.However, Ross did a well enough job interpreting this novel, which I believe many other directors could have screwed up. He made a sensitive, yet not-for-the-faint-of-heart film out of a novel that felt exactly the same way. Like the ""Twilight"" series, there is a love story in ""The Hunger Games"", but it's not the most important thing going on. The film could stand as simply an adaptation of a novel, or could be interpreted as social commentary, with obvious hints being made about the Occupy Wall Street movement, as well as the grim picture it paints of our society could one day become. Yet it's quality entertainment that even the least discerning filmgoer can appreciate.

1341429,A17LSEN4UY4XZQ,B003EYVXV4,M. Daneker,"[6, 11]","There's little point in recapping the plot, so I'll instead move directly to the critique.As sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen we'll first forgive the voluptuous Jennifer for looking strikingly well nourished though she must poach for food to keep her family from starving. If the setting for your story is as police state where starvation is only a bad-hunting day away, then such a radiant girl in a very expensive looking, well fitted, leather jacket isn't selling your story. Director Gary Ross makes the mistake (the first of many) of telling us how desperate the people of the outer districts are, but he doesn't show us anything that looks nearly as bad as the actual poverty in many parts of our country now.All at once Lawrence is an issue and an asset. Her round, soft cheeks should look gaunt and sunken, her curvy, filled-out body should be thin and lank, she can't pass for starving or 16 years old. That said, she can act. The intensity displayed at the reaping when she takes her sister's place, when she tells her mother she has to keep herself together or Gale ""Don't let them starve."" You feel everything with her. Her best moment is just before the games, in the last minutes before stepping into the tube that will take her up to the game field she is not just shaking, but she is scarred out of her mind, it's so convincing you feel it in your gut. Her acting saves this film, even as her looks damn near kill it.Above all it's Director's Gary Ross's inability to convey tension or menace, to wrap the audience in peril and bring much needed suspense that drags the film down.Once in capitol city the film quickly drags, becoming sucked up in it's own leisure when a sense of urgency is required. There's many nice, small touches, like the way everyone likes to skit around the fact that all but one teenager will be savagely murdered, or the way drunken mentor Haymitch, put's his hand over his glass to keep it from being refilled, a subtle way of showing he's taking his role seriously. Unfortunately it's all for the paces, get out the information from the book and move on. There's the obligatory montage of training that is completely pointless because it feels like an obligatory montage which is just the way a lazy writer/director get a large chunk of time covered when it wasn't important to begin with.Many scenes lack power. When Peeta picks up a hundred pound weight, for example, and throws it over head into a rack of spears the rack should blow apart and the result should be dramatic and attention grabbing. Instead you barely see the impact, the rack just moves and some spears fall off, painfully non-climatic. Latter, the cornucopia sequence -- a bloodbath that claims nearly have the tributes is only seconds long, shot fast and blurry lacks any depth or sense of brutality or horror, and I'm not asking for gore, I'm asking for some emotional connection with the characters other than Katniss, a look, a couple of words as the kill or die that relates the terror of what's happening.No matter what happens there's no foreboding, no sense of danger. This film should have all the tension of Die Hard but instead it's a safe, by-the-numbers film.Possibly the most unforgivable thing is the non-relationship between Peeta and Katniss, the final moments in the arena should scream Romeo and Juliet (they are specifically referred to as star-crossed lovers) rather they could be eating cake than poison berries. Lawrence constantly looks like she's trying to coax emotion from Hutcherson, when it's supposed to be him who's truly in love here. She looks longingly at him with depth and sincerity, he stares back blank.With all that's wrong it's really Lawrence's show here and she carries it on her back well elevating a standard movie adaptation and making it her franchise. But Director Ross misses the point entirely, he's hand-held shaky cam is just annoying in the forest, and the other scenes are static and empty. Just like it was good to kiss Chris Columbus goodbye from Harry Potter, so will it be to bid Ross a fond farewell.This film's only really good as it relates most of the excellent novel and because of Jennifer Lawrence's performance as well as it being the primer for the second (and possibly best) of the three books.

In the movie, Katniss gets her Mockingjay pin from the Hub, those who have read the whole trilogy know that this is NOT where the pin comes from. To exclude the character of Madge Undersee (and by extension, Maysilee Donner) made this movie lose a bit. It causes me to wonder how Catching Fire will alter Haymitch's story since he had been allied with Maysilee Donner in the 50th Games.Another thing that bothered me was the lack of focus on the Tributes in the Tribute Parade. They should have clearly shown the costumes of each pair of Tributes, so that we could really see them, we only get a good (if short) view of the Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 11, but the other Tributes were basically ignored in the Parade. You get a brief glimpse here and then of Districts 7, 8, and 10. Highlighting the costumes (and the announcers commenting on them) would have added to the movie, and shown more of the Hunger Games and what each District represented for those who have not read the book.There was one added scene I did like, while Haymitch is at the Capitol, he sees a couple of Capitol parents buy a toy sword for his boy, you can see the disgust on his face as to these Capitol snobs it is just a game, while he has seen 46 of his fellow Tributes die (Games 51 to 73) so the omniscient potential of the movie gives a little boost to narrative that we did not see in the book.",4,Overall a good movie,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,1823,"['movie', 'was', 'overall', 'executed', 'well', 'many', 'aspects', 'am', 'pleased', 'kept', 'faithful', 'most', 'plot', 'points', 'few', 'added', 'scenes', 'movie', 'i.e', 'Snow', 'Seneca', 'Crane', 'rose', 'garden', 'really', 'added', 'movie', 'giving', 'slightly', 'more', 'omniscient', 'feel', 'stepping', 'limit', 'Katniss', 'first', 'person', 'perspective', 'book.However', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'movie', 'deviated', 'bothered', 'movie', 'Katniss', 'Mockingjay', 'pin', 'Hub', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'whole', 'trilogy', 'know', 'NOT', 'where', 'pin', 'exclude', 'character', 'Madge', 'Undersee', 'extension', 'Maysilee', 'Donner', 'made', 'movie', 'lose', 'bit', 'wonder', 'how', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'will', 'alter', 'Haymitch', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'allied', 'Maysilee', 'Donner', '50th', 'Games.Another', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'lack', 'focus', 'Tributes', 'Tribute', 'Parade', 'should', 'have', 'clearly', 'shown', 'costumes', 'pair', 'Tributes', 'could', 'really', 'see', 'only', 'get', 'good', 'short', 'view', 'Tributes', 'Districts', '1', '2', '11', 'other', 'Tributes', 'were', 'basically', 'ignored', 'Parade', 'get', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'here', 'then', 'Districts', '7', '8', '10', 'Highlighting', 'costumes', 'announcers', 'commenting', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'movie', 'shown', 'more', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'what', 'District', 'represented', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book.There', 'was', 'one', 'added', 'scene', 'did', 'like', 'Haymitch', 'Capitol', 'couple', 'Capitol', 'parents', 'buy', 'toy', 'sword', 'boy', 'can', 'see', 'disgust', 'face', 'Capitol', 'snobs', 'just', 'game', 'seen', '46', 'fellow', 'Tributes', 'die', '51', '73', 'omniscient', 'potential', 'movie', 'little', 'boost', 'narrative', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'book']",N/A

However, a movie should also be able to stand on its own, and this one absolutely cannot.I saw this film with my husband, who hasn't read any of the Suzanne Collins novels. He had no idea what was going on half the time, because the film doesn't bother giving any back story whatsoever. You don't even get any explanation of the state of the world, the state of the government, why the Districts all cater to the Capitol, what Mockingjays actually symbolize, etc. It's ridiculous. As a result, I think everything is pretty anti-climactic, at least everything leading up to the actual Games, which are done pretty well. But so much is lacking in the movie. Katniss and Gale have like 30 seconds of screen time together, which is super unfair. The whole post-reaping/pre-Games activities are glossed over pretty quickly. I was especially disappointed with the ""Girl on Fire"" costumes, which are not nearly as impressive as they are in the book. Overall, while I thought the casting was very good (except for Lenny Kravitz as Cinna...say what?!), I had major issues with the script, which allowed for hardly any character development. The character of Rue was especially underplayed, which was ridiculous. I didn't like the final scene of the Games with the dogs. The filmmakers totally sugarcoated it from the way it went down in the book, which made no sense to me.Ultimately, I just thought the film was a giant let-down. The two best things, in my opinion, are Jennifer Lawrence's outstanding performance as Katniss Everdeen, and also the fact that the actual look and feel of the Games (both the setting and the way most of the events played out) looked exactly the way I pictured them when I read the book.

After watching it the first time, I found the beginning quite slow but as the 2 heroes began their journey to the Capital to be prepped for the games, did it really start to get exciting.  First off this movie is very well casted and each made an outstanding performance.  Katniss, was my favorite and even little the little black girl who befriended her, whose name escapes me at the moment.  I was on the edge of my seat during the whole ""games"" part of the movie and bit my nails down to nothing.  This movie was so good, in my opinion, after renting it, I purchased it as well to see it whenever I wanted to.  I am very tempted to read the 2nd book now, since if it ends up being done as well as the first episode, it should be excellent reading.This is definitely an action packed film, with love and tenderness thrown in to a world in which our own is slowing evolving into. It isn't to much of a stretch to see this happening in the not so distant future, not to children persa, but to adults who would kill each other to win millions or be set for the rest of their life.  Especially, those who live in poverty and from hand to mouth.  I pray this never really happens, but blood, gore, violence are becoming more and more the norm and excepted by those that are young and middle aged alike.Anyway, my main point being this is still a great movie to buy, since I believe you will want to watch it again and again.

They really are modern classics and should be read. however this does a good job of taking a huge idea and condensing it. the killings are not graphic and very old school mostly but that's ok because this is a pg movie. However I do think a bloodier version is needed, because killing people is a bloody disgusting affair actually. I did enjoy this movie alot though , the acting was spot on and similiar to the books vision. So that's a good thing here. The lead actress really carries this movie well too, she's got a bright future ahead of her if she doesn't blow it with drugs like so many before her have. the blu ray looks fantastic, it's not a four k picture but then only a few movies are shot that way anyways and there is no format for that anyway.  This was a smash hit at the box office though and worth your viewing. read the books though , they are better, just like the lord of the rings are better books than movies too. The blu ray has a seperate disc of special features and that's good too. I was glad to get the cheaper version without a digital copy or dvd. Please stop putting those in my blu ray package! It drives up the price. The story is about a society that like Rome uses violent games to help subdue the population and control them.

The acting was solid, Jennifer Lawrence did not disappoint, displaying effectively the full spectrum of human emotions.  The supporting cast, Stanley Tucci in particular, was good.But, like most movies that are based on a book series, this movie felt like there was a greatly compressed timeline.  Events transpired too quickly for there to be any real attachment to the characters or the predicaments in which the characters were placed.  Very little backstory was given.  There was no truly effective &#34;villain&#34; that was introduced.  Sutherland's role as the President was the closest that the story came, but so little plot, dialogue, and screen time was allotted to him that he just became a generic &#34;bad guy&#34; without any believable motive behind his actions.Special effects were good, directorial style was also quite good, allowing the viewer to see and feel what the characters would have seen, introducing some &#34;shaky camera&#34; bits, but not going too over-the-top with it, the way some &#34;gritty&#34; action movies are wont to do.  I personally felt that the sound editing was a bit off, as dialogue tended to get lost in the sound effects, sound track, and background noise, and I found that I was continually adjusting my volume up for dialogue and down for action scenes.For anyone who wants to claim that this movie was excessively violent and to &#34;be warned,&#34; then perhaps they should actually understand a bit about what the movie is about before watching it:  24 children left alone in, basically, a Pay-Per-View bloodbath that pits them against each other in a lone-survivor-takes-all event.  24 children, stuck in the woods, until 23 of them are dead, either by violence or by exposure or injury.  It's rated PG-13, and I think that's appropriate.  if you're concerned about the violence and blood, then don't let your 12 year old watch it.  It's that simple.  I watched far worse when I was 8 years old (The Terminator, Alien, Aliens), and I didn't find anything in this film that even approached the levels of violence and horror that Aliens dished out in the 1980s.",3,Pretty Good Movie,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2284,"['Maybe', 'fell', 'victim', 'hype', 'went', 'watching', 'movie', 'too', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'displaying', 'effectively', 'full', 'spectrum', 'human', 'emotions', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'particular', 'was', 'good.But', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'book', 'series', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'greatly', 'compressed', 'timeline', 'Events', 'transpired', 'too', 'quickly', 'be', 'real', 'attachment', 'characters', 'predicaments', 'characters', 'were', 'placed', 'Very', 'little', 'backstory', 'was', 'given', 'was', 'truly', 'effective', '34', 'villain', '34', 'was', 'introduced', 'Sutherland', 'role', 'President', 'was', 'closest', 'story', 'came', 'so', 'little', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'allotted', 'just', 'became', 'generic', '34', 'bad', 'guy', '34', 'believable', 'motive', 'actions.Special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'directorial', 'style', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'see', 'feel', 'what', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'introducing', '34', 'shaky', 'camera', '34', 'bits', 'not', 'going', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'way', '34', 'gritty', '34', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'personally', 'felt', 'sound', 'editing', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'dialogue', 'tended', 'get', 'lost', 'sound', 'effects', 'sound', 'track', 'background', 'noise', 'found', 'was', 'continually', 'adjusting', 'volume', 'up', 'dialogue', 'down', 'action', 'scenes.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'claim', 'movie', 'was', 'excessively', 'violent', '34', 'be', 'warned', '34', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', 'actually', 'understand', 'bit', 'what', 'movie', 'watching', '24', 'children', 'left', 'alone', 'basically', 'Pay-Per-View', 'bloodbath', 'other', 'lone-survivor-takes-all', 'event', '24', 'children', 'stuck', 'woods', '23', 'are', 'dead', 'either', 'violence', 'exposure', 'injury', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'think', 'appropriate', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'violence', 'blood', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', '12', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'simple', 'watched', 'far', 'worse', 'when', 'was', '8', 'years', 'old', 'Terminator', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'film', 'even', 'approached', 'levels', 'violence', 'horror', 'Aliens', 'dished', 'out', '1980s']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised to discover it is so much more than that.The future of The Hunger Games is basically a Roman Empire updated to modern times.  In that respect it reminded of the role-playing game X-Crawl, which did much the same thing with a fantasy twist.  There are twelve districts that send ""tributes"" to the Hunger Games, which are basically televised gladiatorial combats in which children slaughter each other. Every year a raffle known as a reaping is held to choose a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18.  There can be only one winner. Being televised, The Hunger Games is influenced by the upper class citizens of the dominating Capitol district; contestants are interviewed before the game and during the event can win sponsorships, which in turn earns in-game advantages like healing ointments.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to join the Hunger Games when her little sister Primrose (Willow Shields) is selected by lottery.  Her male companion is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and his complicated past with Katniss will affect their relationship and the game. The game itself takes place on what can only be described as a holodeck like arena that can be manipulated by technicians directed by Gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley).Each team has its own entourage, including public relations (Elizabeth Banks as the grating Effie Trinket), a trainer (the drunk Haymitch Abernathy played by a probably drunk Woody Harrelson), and a personal stylist (Cinna, played by Lenny Kravitz channeling Prince).  These five characters manage to gel nicely on screen: Lawrence plays Katniss as aloof and frequently terrified, but with enough steely resolve that you believe she can kill; Hutcherson looks even more terrified than Lawrence and in a twist plays the ""damsel in distress"" to Katniss' vigorous presence; Banks is a cartoonish reminder of what Capitol citizens are like (clowns, basically); Harrelson channels frustrated class rage that keeps him in his spirits until he realizes Katniss has a chance at winning; and finally Kravitz does an excellent job of being the only sane person who seems to care about Katniss as a human being.  Director Gary Ross knew what he was doing when he cast this little dysfunctional family.If this all sounds like grim stuff on screen, it is. The Hunger Games is particularly gut-wrenching for parents.  The children can be as young as 12, so there are little ones who are far out of their depth. To the film's credit The Hunger Games never flinches from its basic premise of kids murdering each other.  Although they are more likely to die of deprivation and disease, the Gamemakers force them into conflict with forest fires and even monsters.  And it's all televised around the clock.Lurking in the background is the political unrest that The Hunger Games elicit, particularly over the slaughter of 23 children each year.  While some districts train their children for combat and thus volunteer, the other districts enter unwillingly, which has consequences for the political stranglehold the Capitol lords over them all.  The state-mandated executions have all the pomp and circumstance of a Roman gladiatorial bout.The Hunger Games is of particular interest to gamers.  Video gamers will see the constructed environments as quite similar to first-person shooters; tabletop role-players will see the Gamemaker role in their own killer game masters.  This may be the first mainstream movie that makes being a game master cool.  And if it gives preteen girls someone to look up to whose goal in life is greater than pining for her vampire boyfriend, I'm okay with that.",5,Making game masters cool again,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,3885,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'was', 'combination', 'Lottery', 'crossed', 'Running', 'Man', 'preteen', 'girls', 'know', 'Japanese', 'literature', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'that.The', 'future', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'basically', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'updated', 'modern', 'times', 'respect', 'reminded', 'role-playing', 'game', 'X-Crawl', 'did', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'fantasy', 'twist', 'are', 'twelve', 'districts', 'send', 'tributes', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'basically', 'televised', 'gladiatorial', 'combats', 'children', 'slaughter', 'other', 'year', 'raffle', 'known', 'reaping', 'held', 'choose', 'male', 'female', 'ages', '12', '18', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'winner', 'Being', 'televised', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'influenced', 'upper', 'class', 'citizens', 'dominating', 'Capitol', 'district', 'contestants', 'are', 'interviewed', 'game', 'event', 'can', 'win', 'sponsorships', 'turn', 'in-game', 'advantages', 'healing', 'ointments.Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'volunteers', 'join', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'when', 'little', 'sister', 'Primrose', 'Willow', 'Shields', 'selected', 'lottery', 'male', 'companion', 'Peeta', 'Mellark', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'complicated', 'Katniss', 'will', 'affect', 'relationship', 'game', 'game', 'place', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'holodeck', 'arena', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'technicians', 'directed', 'Gamemaker', 'Seneca', 'Crane', 'Wes', 'Bentley', '.Each', 'team', 'own', 'entourage', 'including', 'public', 'relations', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'grating', 'Effie', 'Trinket', 'trainer', 'drunk', 'Haymitch', 'Abernathy', 'played', 'probably', 'drunk', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'personal', 'stylist', 'Cinna', 'played', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'channeling', 'Prince', 'five', 'characters', 'manage', 'gel', 'nicely', 'screen', 'Lawrence', 'Katniss', 'aloof', 'frequently', 'terrified', 'enough', 'steely', 'resolve', 'believe', 'can', 'kill', 'Hutcherson', 'even', 'more', 'terrified', 'Lawrence', 'twist', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Katniss', 'vigorous', 'presence', 'Banks', 'cartoonish', 'reminder', 'what', 'Capitol', 'citizens', 'are', 'clowns', 'basically', 'Harrelson', 'channels', 'frustrated', 'class', 'rage', 'spirits', 'Katniss', 'chance', 'winning', 'finally', 'Kravitz', 'excellent', 'job', 'being', 'only', 'sane', 'person', 'who', 'care', 'about', 'Katniss', 'human', 'being', 'Director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'cast', 'little', 'dysfunctional', 'family.If', 'grim', 'stuff', 'screen', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'particularly', 'gut-wrenching', 'parents', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'young', '12', 'so', 'are', 'little', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'depth', 'film', 'credit', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'never', 'flinches', 'basic', 'premise', 'kids', 'murdering', 'other', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'die', 'deprivation', 'disease', 'Gamemakers', 'force', 'conflict', 'forest', 'fires', 'even', 'monsters', 'televised', 'clock.Lurking', 'background', 'political', 'unrest', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'elicit', 'particularly', 'slaughter', '23', 'children', 'year', 'districts', 'train', 'children', 'combat', 'thus', 'volunteer', 'other', 'districts', 'enter', 'unwillingly', 'consequences', 'political', 'stranglehold', 'Capitol', 'lords', 'state-mandated', 'executions', 'have', 'pomp', 'circumstance', 'Roman', 'gladiatorial', 'bout.The', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'particular', 'interest', 'gamers', 'Video', 'gamers', 'will', 'see', 'constructed', 'environments', 'quite', 'similar', 'first-person', 'shooters', 'tabletop', 'role-players', 'will', 'see', 'Gamemaker', 'role', 'own', 'killer', 'game', 'masters', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'being', 'game', 'master', 'cool', 'preteen', 'girls', 'someone', 'look', 'up', 'goal', 'life', 'greater', 'pining', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', ""'m"", 'okay']",N/A

IMO, ""The Hunger Games"" is anything BUT a teen movie, and it's funny how that is the target market. There is little love story like in Twilight, and the movie contains so much symbolism and deep-thinking that kids and teens cannot fully understand and see.The districts, living in what we would call a ""third world country"" being controlled by a capitalistic, ""first world country"" is something we see today to a lesser extent. The control of mass media and technology is also a main focus of the film. Sociology of how society is brainwashed by the government into thinking killing kids is the ""norm"" is not a big deal, hence why most of the tributes are ""ready to fight"" during their interviews. Also successfully pokes fun at the ridiculousness of reality TV. There is just so much more, but when you look at the film as more of a teen flick, this film is truly a masterpiece. Great acting by the lead role of Katniss, nice pacing, and even successfully follows the book IMO.

I don't get it. This movie is too drawn out, boring, very average, and WAY over-hyped. I get why it's the next Twilight-esk fad tho, it's because it's an overrated POS where teenage girls find characters attractive, and so instead of watching a movie for what it is, it's based on other facts.So the plot of this thing is that in the future, something happened like a war of some kind, and now the rich people live in the cities, and the poor live in district villages where, each year two people from each District will be chosen to fight in honor and sacrifice themselves for some stupid tribute to the battle that was won. It's now a stupid reality TV show. Boy do so many of us hate Reality TV.I was forced into watching this with my g/f, and I thought, it may be ok, it sounds something like ""The Running Man""... but no, the Running Man is actually entertaining... this movie right here, I was just about falling asleep during the first hour from boredom as it sets up who this main actress is playing the starring role, and her useless love interests; also how they live etc... B O R I N G. Get to the action already. So FINALLY, something starts to happen and you get to see that in the future, the rich people are all fashiontards, except for Woody Harrilson who hasn't had a decent hairstyle in a movie since ""White Men Can't Jump"".Once these ""games"" begin, you see it's nothing but a boring run through the meadows and into the trees as they hunt and kill each other to be the last person/s standing. Sounds more interesting than it is. Expect to see the typical, ""I don't want to be a killer"" thing to happen from the ones who become the final contenders. Everything was predictable and convenient... watch the movie if you must, and tell me you didn't know what was coming? One survivor with a heart of gold... get real.Over hyped, Overrated, Over Budgeted, Over-Kill... eckkk... but that's Hollyweed these days, so I expect this dribble will be drawn out with a million more useless sequels based on the books this fecal matter was wiped out on. I expect teeny-boppers can't wait to go and waste money on the next installment because ""oh, he's so cute"" is back on the big screen. But I know now for sure, I won't be bothering to ever see any sequels for this useless rubbish of over-hyped etc, etc...The thing that really annoyed the most was that none of these killers are even trained to kill, they are more picked at random out of a hat, and yet hardly any of them seemed to protest against wanting to be a part of what, in the end, if you win, you get a crown on TV... and the winner just accepts the crown with a smile, and goes back home like nothing happened? Reality of the situation would probably be mental therapy for years for being forced to kill or be killed, and whats even worse, people sitting around in the audience eating their popcorn and smiling like they where meant to buy into this $#!*. Gimme a break, are you people even aware of what you are watching, or did you just like the boys in tight pants and the shinny objects flickering in your face?This has got to be the #1 most overrated POS of the year.

1341495,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B003EYVXV4,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","""The Hunger Games"" was adapted from Suzanne Collins' 2008 novel of the same name. In a dystopian future, the government requires that each of its districts send one young man and one woman aged 12-18 to compete in the Hunger Games each year. The contestants must battle to the death as the nation's television audience watches. This in order to intimidate the population into submission as a result of a rebellion in the past. From the outlying District 12, the pubescent Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is selected, but her older sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place. The baker's son, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is chosen as the male ""tribute"". The young couple are taken to the capitol where their mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) will advise them. They will have two weeks to prepare to kill and, probably, to die, before they are effectively thrown into the arena.The trailers may give the impression that this is an action movie, but only about half the movie takes place in an action environment, and, even there, there is limited action. I have not read the novel, but I understand that it is narrated in the first person, so fans of the book are probably not expecting an action movie. That's good, because the film spends an hour preparing for the Games. A lot of this material is unnecessary and seems to be included in order to show off colorful characters, expensive sets, and creative hair and make-up. The Games rarely achieve any palpable tension. The pressure cooker environment, where 24 young people are fighting to the last man or woman, is undermined by numerous dei ex machina and the fact that their environment is being manipulated by its creators to please the audience, like an interactive game. We don't get to know the other contestants, and there is never any compelling sense of desperation, disorientation, or fear.The violence is tidy. ""The Hunger Games"" is generally very sentimental -completely the wrong tone for any work about a killing game. And it is pointlessly long at 2 hours 15 minutes. On the bright side, Jennifer Lawrence is a charismatic actress, and this proves she can carry a film despite a poor script. I couldn't help liking Katniss, even if I thought the movie was a snooze. Lawrence's performance in the superb ""Winter's Bone"" (2010) is the one to see, though. Woody Harrelson is also good here as the competitors' alcoholic yet effective mentor. I don't detect the presence of anything like a theme. The film doesn't seem to comment on anything. Competition is bad? No, it doesn't say that. Murder is bad? No kidding. Self-sacrifice pays off? Not for most of the contestants. Suicide gestures are a good way to resolve a problem? I hope not. No, ""The Hunger Games"" doesn't seem to be about anything. It's fluff.

1341499,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B003EYVXV4,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 1]","I loved the first book and felt fairly good about the latter two books of this trilogy. I happened upon them maybe half a year before they started to become super popular and thus came the movie later. Now with that aside let me review the picture.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the film's presentation. It's very good though I found the novel even better. Part of the overall problem is that some of the emotional delivery is lost in a film as the main character cannot internalize nearly as much as she did in the novel and that was one of its greatest strengths.The tale focuses upon a post apocalyptic setting in which several cities (known as districts) are subservient and sometimes dependent upon a main city (simply named the capitol). The capitol is rich and basically drains the districts dry and punished them for for an earlier rebellion by doing something chilling yet believable enough: they force two children from each district compete in a televised arena of death in which only one victor may walk away. The arena fight is titled ""The Hunger Games"".What follows is our main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence), taking the place of her younger sister (you can volunteer but it's rare) and finds herself entering the alien world of the capitol where people live in splendorous excess and place bets on the final and only victor yet remain emotionally detached from the overall death arena.Katniss is sent with a boy named Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and they are mentored by a survivor of the Hunger Games known as Haymitch (played by Woody Harrelson) who numbs out the trauma of his time in the Hunger Games with sarcasm and especially drinking himself to the point of death yet even though he acts destructive he does want his district to do as well as possible. What then takes place is Katniss and Peta doing their best to win the affections of the audiences (especially sponsors who are allowed to send gifts to their favorites when the arena battle  begins) in preparation for the stomach grinding Hunger Games.Also starring Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci and Wes Bentley.Good music use to create mood like when the Hunger Games begin and you can hear the breathing and almost the heart beats of the competitors. There is a direct and honest brutality as the kids began to fight for resources.

1341500,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B003EYVXV4,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","The Hunger Games is the start of another franchise of movies based a series of teen books.  However, I did not think the movie was that bad, but actually quite good.  I do not think it is as good as the Lord of the Rings films, Narnia films, or the Harry Potter films, but still fairly enjoyable.  Compared to the string of teen fantasy movies that have come out recently like Percy Jackson or Twilight this movie is god.The story is pretty simple.  It takes place in the distant future.  There was once a big civil war which has left North America in ruins.  Instead of countries there now exists twelve districts.  Each year the capital of Panem forces either a boy or a girl from each district to compete in the Hunger Games where they all battle to the death.  From District 12 a girl named Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is chosen to compete along with her friend/love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth).People accuse this film of ripping of another film called Battle Royale.  Firstly I have not seen Battle Royale so I cannot say which film is better.  Secondly, I'm sure that Battle Royale was not the first of its kind either.  Everything is inspired by something.  There have been movies and TV shows that have come out after this that have a similar premise of people put somewhere and are forced to fight to the death.  For all anime fans out there, there is an anime that came out last year (the same year that the Hunger Games came out) called Btooom that has pretty much the same premise yet I do not see many people complaining that that show ripped-off Battle Royale.Plus the film is still well structured, well, acted, and can be entertaining.  The characters are pretty solid.  I do like Katniss and it is easy to sympathize with her given the situation.  The stuff that she goes through is pretty scary and intense.  I can say that I would be dead in the first ten minutes if I was put in the Hunger Games.The movie has some great effects, decent actions scenes, and an interesting world.  I cannot comment on the 3D because I only saw the film in 2D.  There is one complaint I have and that is the middle portion.  I found much of the middle of the film to be kind of boring.  The middle mostly focuses of the political aspect of this world and preparing Katniss for the games.Overall, the Hunger Games was a pleasant surprise.  I did not expect much upon going to see it.  I basically saw it because my mother made me see it.  I have to admit it was much better than I thought it was going to be.

1341511,A3G4MPMSA9T3HK,B003EYVXV4,M. Mierendorf,"[0, 0]","Simply put, The Hunger Games is a huge success - and not just at the box office. From the dark, dreary, dystopia of District 12 to the brilliantly shining, colorful, excited nature of the Capitol, The Hunger Games is a winner. Directed by Gary Ross, the film blends the two worlds seamlessly.The film, which is based on the first book of The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, is set in a country called Panem. Using a clever propaganda film, the film indicates why every year, the citizens of the twelve districts offer up as tribute one boy and one girl to fight to the death in the Hunger Games.It's a dark world, which is run by the Capitol. Through controlled fear, organized restrictions of resources, and the Games, the Capitol maintains its rule without disruption. Governed by President Snow (Donald Sutherland), Panem is very separated. Each district is isolated, alone, and unaware of the conditions in the other districts.The hero, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), lives in District 12. District 12 is straight out of Great Depression-era Middle America. Dark, dirty, and poor, District 12 is home to the mining ore operation for Panem. Katniss finds her solace in this world in the woods outside of the fences, where she hunts with Gale (Liam Hemsworth). We're never sure about the true nature of the Katniss and Gale's relationship, although their feelings for each other are visually suggested that they're probably stronger than simple friendship.At the Reaping (the tribute selection event), which is overseen and emceed by Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Katiniss volunteers to save her sister Prim, who is originally picked. Acting as a volunteer is a first for the District - something the citizens of Panem don't overlook. Katniss' male counterpart and tribute is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). It quickly becomes clear that everything that surrounds the Games is played up for the audience.As Katniss and Peeta are shipped off to the Capitol, a former Games winner and mentor for the District 12 tributes, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), makes his first appearance. Haymitch initially comes off as a drunk, sarcastic, and relatively worthless mentor. As Katniss and Peeta prepare for the Games, Haymitch slowly warms to them and begins to offer nuggets of wisdom. Harrelson is a fun casting choice. He's the visual representation of blending District 12 grit with the Capitol style, and he offers an entertaining performance steeped with humor. As Team 12 works to appease the audience, Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), team stylist, rebelliously makes them visual protests to the Capitol. During the pre-interview sequence with the wonderful Games commentator Caesar (Stanley Tucci), Peeta drops the bombshell that he's been in love with Katniss since he was a child. Katniss and Peeta are now the star-crossed couple.All of the plot building expertly amps the tension that leads to the moment when the heroes enter the Arena. It's here that the film hits its stride. Ross crafts a film in which children are violently slaughtered - which instills regret and discomfort in the audience. Witnessing the death of children is jarring and creates a very self-aware feeling in the audience. Just by sitting in the theater, we're just as much of the Panem audience and the experience of the Games.Some critics have complained of the shaky cinematography (result of not using a Stedicam), but Ross strives to show the viewer the chaotic and jarring nature of the Games. Visually, The Hunger Games is stunning. There are certainly effects-heavy shots, but they never seem out of place or fake. The set pieces for and design of the Capitol are amazing. In contrasting the dirt and grime of District 12, the filmmakers make apparent the pure decadence.Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss with great resolve and restraint. Many of the moments during the Games are reflected in her eyes. The Games' stress, sadness, anger, and fear are all honestly apparent to the audience (real and cinematic). Hutcherson isn't as strong as Peeta but does win the audience over towards the end of the film. This isn't his fault because his role is greatly reduced from what it is in the novel. However, this is Katniss' story. She's the hero, but she's a reluctant and unwilling hero, who rises to the occasion when necessary. Smart, cunning, and aware of her situation, Katniss never takes risks that aren't needed.The film is the same way. The book is darker and more violent but also slower. Ross smartly balances these slower scenes during the Games with moments that let Katniss think and react to the artificial world around her.Overall, The Hunger Games is a fantastic film. While the first book doesn't as openly end with threads for an obvious sequel, the film very much does.

1341516,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B003EYVXV4,M. Oleson,"[3, 5]","There is always a risk when you watch a movie derived wholly or in part from a book, especially a book as popular as this intro to the Katniss saga that promises at least 2 more book and movies.  Will the movie be faithful to the book?  Will the characters be given time to be fleshed out?  Most of the time filmmakers alter much of the original concept because of economic, artistic or conceptual factors.  I have the advantage of reading the book but the disadvantage of not reading those that follow.  The book's author Suzanne Collins was closely involved in the production of the film, co-writing the script and has said she believes the film to be authentic.  So do I.Set in a future where continents are renamed due to some change in the political collective, Panem (North America) has been divided into 12 districts.  Each district has a specific purpose.  It could be agriculture or manufacturing or something else.  Each district is under the thumb of the central government that rose from a civilian rebellion some 75 years earlier.  District 12 is the coal mining region and the most poverty stricken.  In order to keep the population under control and entertained at the same time, an annual televised battle to the death is held.  This idea is similar to the gladiator games held by the Romans which was an inspiration for Collins.The combatants (Tributes) are chosen by lottery and only those between the ages of 12 and 18 are eligible.  One boy and one girl from each district.  The older you are, the more entries you will have.  Kind of like the NBA draft, only getting chosen likely means death since only one will survive the two week event.  A barely 12 year old girl is chosen in District 12, but her 16 year old sister and mother-like figure volunteers in her place.  Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a strong, independent young woman who is also the breadwinner for her sister Prim (Willow Shields) and mother (Paula Malcomson, TV's ""Caprica"").  She is a skilled bow hunter and often hunts with her hunky friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).  There is an underlying attraction but it is never pursued.Once the combatants enter the Capitol, they are treated like royalty in the few days prior to the games.  The boy from District 12 is a baker's son named Peeta (Josh Hutcherson, so good in ""The Kids Are Alright"").  He admits publically that he has always had a crush on Katniss but we're not sure this is real or just a publicity stunt prompted by the pair's mentor, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson).  The games become a battle to the finish but along the way, coalitions are formed by some of the participants.  Katniss, however goes her own way.  She's seen as a possible force due to her survival skills as well as her prowess with a bow and arrow, so is hunted by the collective.Ultimately Katniss joins forces with her district partner, Peeta and forms their own alliance.  The games' rules change when the two become closer and yes romantic, all in front of the large TV audience.  But is this real or staged?  The deaths are harrowing but not very bloody.  Some may rail against this restraint but I would argue that spears, knives and arrows don't necessarily result in copious amounts of blood.The strongest element in this movie is the character of Katniss as portrayed by Ms. Lawrence.  In the novel, she speaks in the first person so short of a voice-over narration, Lawrence must convey her inner-most thoughts, fears and emotions by her actions and facial expressions.  She pulls this off giving the audience a real connection to her plight.  In an especially touching scene, Katniss must say goodbye to a 12 year old competitor from District 11 who has been speared.  They had worked together earlier against the stronger collective.  Katniss, not one to cry, must suck it up yet convey her remorse.  Perhaps Lawrence's best scene.  One of the advantages of reading the book is that you better understand the relationship between Katniss and Peeta.  This might be a bit confusing to the viewer without that knowledge.  Appropriately the film ends with it unresolved as it should be.The film isn't perfect.  One of the book's featured events is the entrance to the arena similar to the chariot parade of ancient Rome.  Katniss as ""the girl on fire"" was underwhelming.  The mutations, wolf-like creatures artificially created, lack a certain element that was especially creepy in the book.  For some reason this was eliminated.  I also thought the use of the shaky-cam early on was a bit too much.  In short however, the film is faithful to the novel and to its fans.  It is well done, if not perfectly.  The strong performance of the actors, especially Jennifer Lawrence, elevates the film above the norm.Finally, ""The Hunger Games"" is now taking flak from fans of the film ""Battle Royale"" (2000) from Japan.  Yes it has a similar theme, but differs in other ways.  That's fine, but to think that ""BR"" is the one that came up with the idea is ridiculous.  Check out this list of films with similar themes:  ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1932), ""Lord of the Flies"" (1963) involves children too, ""Death Race 2000"" (1975), ""Rollerball"" (1975), the novella ""The Long Walk"" (1979) by Richard Bachman (Stephen King), ""The Running Man"" (1987).  These all preceded ""Battle Royale.""For more terrific movies involving Jennifer Lawrence see ""The Burning Plain"" (2008), ""Winter's Bone"" (2010)",4,Jennifer Lawrence shines in this faithful film

The Hunger Games appeals to both genders and all ages. Hundreds of years in the future, one girl and boy ages 12-18 are chosen from each of the 12 Districts to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games. This is punishment for a rebellion that happened in the past when the capital was attacked by ""lower"" peoples. The capital city has all the money and power, so every District is poor and low on food.The acting is very good all around, with Jennifer Lawrence stealing the show as Katniss Everdeen. She is tough, smart and a character the audience has no problem rooting for. Woody Harrelson has his fair share of funny lines as her mentor. Elizabeth Banks hides behind some hideous make-up and costumes, which made for a memorable character. Even Lenny Kravitz shows up in a small role.The action scenes are not really as graphic as they should be (PG-13 of course), but they do show the kids being killed in quick cuts and sometimes even a few splashes of blood. After a nice build up, it's not quite as thrilling as it could have been once the games start, but I never checked my watch once and the 2 and 1/2 hours flew by.After making 70 million dollars on Friday alone, I will be looking forward to the next two installments.I'm going to check out the Japanese film called Battle Royale (2000), which is nearly the same thing, but with a hard R rating.

They definitely left too much out in terms of the relationship between the main characters. There's none of the connection that they share which really defines who they are as the story progresses. Every actor did an amazing job and I love that they picked Jennifer Lawrence for this role. She is stunning and hilarious in real life and I so want to see her do well. Josh Hutcherson was also an excellent choice and Liam Hemsworth fit the role of.. crap.. I can't remember his name. Anyway, literally every actor in this movie is superbly talented.The cinematography was excellent, the soundtrack was perfect, and the action sequences had a way of making you lean forward in your chair while holding your breath.

However, I didn't see any problem following the movie.  I'm sure the movie left alot out from the book.  That's not my problem with the movie.  My issues with the movie is that it was just plain boringly dull.  Absolutely nothing special or even remotely amusing.  Why?* Zero character development - There is not one single reason to care for ANY of the characters.  Why should the lead character win?  She's nothing special.* False leads - In the beginning we are lead to believe that the lead character is something special and that everyone is betting on her to win the game.  Why?  The ONLY amazing thing she did was shoot one bird out of the sky with an arrow.  Then for the rest of the movie she has to have her neck saved by others EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Not once did she ever save her own neck without the help of someone else.* Predictable - It was easy to follow because there were absolutely no surprises.  Even the so-called tricky ending was obvious a mile away.  Sorry, but it was.* Why didn't the band of ""bad guys"" kill the boy friend after he served his purpose of finding the lead character?  They said they would, but then he is left alive.* Why didn't they simply shoot her out of the tree or throw a knife?  Again, lame.* For folks who are so amazed at how the lead character stepped in for her little sister, really?  Wouldn't you?  I didn't see any big deal there.* Not an original story.  Think:  Matrix, Gamer, Demolition Man, Lord of the Flies, Running Man, Logan's Run, The Island...  Point being, I can't even give it kudos for ""original"" story.  That'd be fine if it was at least a good movie.  It wasn't.  It wasn't completely rotten, however.  The acting was fine.  The SFX were okay.  Elizabeth Banks' character was fantastically amusing....But the movie itself as a whole....  It was just nothing special and will easily be forgotten.

So I approached the movie with trepidation, as let's face it, movies are almost always never as good as the book.  And that holds true for this one, although I can deifnitely see how it would appeal to those that took no interest in the book itself.Katniss is a girl from the twelvth district of Panem, a country that has a shining Capitol city and twelve districts that are somewhat poorer and supply different necessities to the Capitol.  To keep her family alive, Katniss illegally hunts in the forest with her friend Gale to provide food and other things they need.  But this year, at the Reaping, in which a girl and boy from each district are picked to go to the Hunger Games ( a brutal contest that is a fight to the death, with only one left alive), her sister Primrose is picked to be a contestant.  In a selfless moment, Katniss offers herself up as a volunteer to save her sister.  As she and Peeta (the boy who was picked) head to the Capitol, she knows that she has a minimal chance of staying alive, but she has to do whatever is in her power to survive the games.Characters:Jennifer Lawrence: Katniss EverdeenJosh Hutcherson: Peeta MellarkLiam Hemsworth: Gale HawthorneWoody Harrelson: Haymitch AbernathyElizabeth Banks:  Effie TrinketLenny Kravitz:  CinnaStanley Tucci:  Caesar FlickermanDonald Sutherland:  President Snow[...]I think they did a great job at picked all the different actors and actresses for this moment.  Katniss is a little stoic as played by Jennifer Lawrence, but considering her character isn't very touchy feely anyway, it seems appropriate.  Peeta I found nice, certainly Hutcherson is easy on the eyes, but I just didn't get that shining personality from him like I do through the books.  Gale is also pretty to look at it, but again, the personality just doesn't shine through.  That being said there are several characters who do have a wonderful effect on screen.  Woody Harrelson as Haymitch I thought was perfectly done.  He really seemed just like the character from the books.  And Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, oh my, I have to say I didn't even realize it was him at first and I think I fell a little bit in love with him from his first few minutes on screen.  He was that appealing.  And when I discovered it was Kravitz later, I just couldn't believe it.The plot for the most part follows the book, and for those who haven't read the book it still is easy to tell what's going on.  Although there are a few things that only people who've read the book would understand.  And that's fine, as it adds a certain element for them.  But there are a lot of areas it strays from the book, and like usual, that's disappointing.  Like with the dogs, there are certain things about them in the book that didn't carry through to hear, and I think it would have been simple enough to make them stay the same that way without needing to take too much time to develop it.  So small things like that.  It will be interesting to see if the sequels to the movie follow the other two books though.  I would hope that they would for the most part as Collins wrote a good series, and there's a lot of detail that is important.The special effects were pretty good in this movie.  Especially those involving fire.  I did like that they tried to capture Collins vision with ""The Girl on Fire"" and incorporate it into the movie.  Other effects, like the dogs, weren't quite as well done but luckily they weren't in as much of the movie and the better special effects were more predominant.  I do need to point out that ultimately there is a lot of death in both the book and the novel, and it is captured to an extent on the screen itself.  So be prepared for violence, and blood, and tough subjects. The music was good, but nothing special and it actually wasn't until the ending credits that I really took the time to appreciate the music.  It was just filler during the movie itself.  But the songs played during the credits were nice.Good movie, just wish it had had more elements that make it true to the book.  I will eagerly wait to see the next one.Review by M.

She (J.Lawrence) never really had to face the most difficult decisions...in fact her major decisions are reflexive.  Who would let their helpless kid sibling get slaughtered?  Not just helpless, but more helpless than all the other kids her age...based on her reactions on day of lottery.  No one...no one with a heart, so that's not really a choice -- it's like a reflex anyone would have.  When she kills later...it's reflexive...in self defense or in defense of another.  But will she kill the cute and mostly likeable male from her district?  The conflict always remains in the background as minor and gets resolved easily.  She never has a tough decision here...she never places him in the sights of her drawn bow and trembles with doubt.

The directing, the acting, and the script-writing were really well done.  It was the best translation from book to film that I'd seen in a long time.  I liked it better than the original book, mainly because the WRITING was so much better.  I've watched this movie several times, but I've only read the Hunger Games trilogy once.  Even people who haven't read the book can enjoy the movie and know what's going on, unlike the Harry Potter films (all us HP readers got it, but I have friends who just could not figure out what was going on in one or the other of the HP movies).",5,"Oddly, Better Than the Book",1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,1050,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'quite', 'liked', 'book', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'not', 'best', 'written', 'book', 'writing', 'nothing', 'super', 'spectacular', 'narrated', 'Katniss', 'point', 'view', 'well', 'much', 'time', 'teenager', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'TLC', 'film', 'widespread', 'popularity', 'book', 'meaning', 'readers', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'were', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'would', 'fail', 'bring', 'profits', 'directing', 'acting', 'script-writing', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'best', 'translation', 'book', 'film', ""'d"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'liked', 'better', 'original', 'book', 'mainly', 'WRITING', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'times', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'trilogy', 'once', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'HP', 'readers', 'got', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'other', 'HP', 'movies']",N/A

1341581,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B003EYVXV4,Newton Ooi,"[0, 0]","Another year in Hollywood and we have another dozen or so films about a future less bright and less livable than the present.  In the case of ""The Hunger Games"", the film is a tight adaptation of a bestselling novel of the same name, and the first in a trilogy.  The movie takes place in America, one where the national government has quelled an uprising by those outside the capital, and now has dictatorial control over the entire continent.  The country is now divided into 12 known districts, along with the capital.  The title of the film refers to an annual event held in this futuristic American capital whereby two representatives from each district, so 24 in total, fight to the death in a forest outside the capital.  The movie follows the trials of our heroine as she volunteers for the Hunger Games, trains for them, and then wins.The film itself clocks in at almost 2.5 hours, but it passes quickly as action and dialogue blend seamlessly from slow scenes to fast scenes.  The acting was great, considering that the cast consisted primarily of small name actors and actresses, with an occasional star past their prime thrown in to provide key roles.  The latter includes Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson.  The main roles however go to relative newcomers, with Jennifer Lawrence being the standout.  Her unique face complements her beautiful and strong physique very well.  Once we get past the acting however, the rest of the movie is quite average.  The soundtrack was forgettable, which was regrettable given that the multiple settings of the movie offered the movie's makers fertile ground to cook up a wonderful score, whether it be of original creations or rehashed tracks.  I imagine Holst's Jupiter would have been great background music for the chariot scene, while Copeland's Appalachian Spring would have been perfect for the scenes in heroine's home village.  The cinematography was average, with no ""wow"" scenes that were chock plenty in other 2012 releases such as the ""The Hobbit"", ""John Carter"", or even ""Brave"".  The special effects were also low key, about on par with that found in a TV miniseries or HBO special.Probably my biggest complaint about the film was the world it took place in.  The movie takes place in a dystopian future where democracy has given way to dictatorship.  The foundation of this dictatorship is guilt and penance.  The outside districts, as penance for their rebellion, offer up tribute to the capital in the form of their children, 24 of which must suffer in the annual Hunger Games.  This entire premise is so hokey and synthetic.  Human history has countless examples of dictatorships to model a film's context after, but they all share something in common, and that is fear.  Specifically, every dictatorship that ever existed was grounded on either the fear of a subversive minority or fear of a looming external enemy.  Maybe the best example is the Roman Empire, which manufactured fear of both.  Roman rulers stayed in power by selling themselves as defenders of the realm against Rome's feared enemies; first Carthage, then Jews, then Christians, then the Germanic tribes, and finally each other as the empire split apart.  And all along the way there was the fear of slave revolts that really enabled Rome's rulers to maintain a police state throughout the empire.  The gladiatorial combats sponsored by Rome, which was a key inspiration for ""The Hunger Games"", was where Rome's captured enemies were disposed of.  Guilt and penance were of little use in keeping Roman emperors in power.  Yet nowhere in this film do we see the national government, the capitol, use fear of the Other as a way to keep its hold on power.  So overall, a film that stands out for its casting and acting; which is a rarity in Hollywood these days.As for this package; well the film on the disc matches the theatrical release; no extended edition here.  The trailers are nothing special.  So for the patient fan, I would recommend waiting until all 3 films are available together in one package.",4,"Great acting, great casting, average plot",1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,4042,"['year', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'dozen', 'so', 'films', 'future', 'less', 'bright', 'less', 'livable', 'present', 'case', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'film', 'tight', 'adaptation', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'first', 'trilogy', 'movie', 'place', 'America', 'one', 'where', 'national', 'government', 'quelled', 'uprising', 'capital', 'now', 'dictatorial', 'control', 'entire', 'continent', 'country', 'now', 'divided', '12', 'known', 'districts', 'capital', 'title', 'film', 'refers', 'annual', 'event', 'held', 'futuristic', 'American', 'capital', 'whereby', 'two', 'representatives', 'district', 'so', '24', 'total', 'fight', 'death', 'forest', 'capital', 'movie', 'trials', 'heroine', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'trains', 'then', 'wins.The', 'film', 'almost', '2.5', 'hours', 'quickly', 'action', 'dialogue', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'slow', 'scenes', 'fast', 'scenes', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'considering', 'cast', 'consisted', 'primarily', 'small', 'name', 'actors', 'actresses', 'occasional', 'star', 'prime', 'thrown', 'provide', 'key', 'roles', 'latter', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'main', 'roles', 'however', 'go', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'being', 'standout', 'unique', 'face', 'complements', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'physique', 'very', 'well', 'get', 'acting', 'however', 'rest', 'movie', 'quite', 'average', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'forgettable', 'was', 'regrettable', 'given', 'multiple', 'settings', 'movie', 'offered', 'movie', 'makers', 'fertile', 'ground', 'cook', 'up', 'wonderful', 'score', 'be', 'original', 'creations', 'rehashed', 'tracks', 'imagine', 'Holst', 'Jupiter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'background', 'music', 'chariot', 'scene', 'Copeland', 'Appalachian', 'Spring', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'scenes', 'heroine', 'home', 'village', 'cinematography', 'was', 'average', 'wow', 'scenes', 'were', 'chock', 'plenty', 'other', '2012', 'releases', 'such', 'Hobbit', 'John', 'Carter', 'even', 'Brave', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'also', 'low', 'key', 'about', 'par', 'found', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'HBO', 'special.Probably', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'was', 'world', 'took', 'place', 'movie', 'place', 'dystopian', 'future', 'where', 'democracy', 'given', 'way', 'dictatorship', 'foundation', 'dictatorship', 'guilt', 'penance', 'outside', 'districts', 'penance', 'rebellion', 'offer', 'up', 'tribute', 'capital', 'form', 'children', '24', 'must', 'suffer', 'annual', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'entire', 'premise', 'so', 'hokey', 'synthetic', 'Human', 'history', 'countless', 'examples', 'dictatorships', 'model', 'film', 'context', 'share', 'something', 'common', 'fear', 'Specifically', 'dictatorship', 'ever', 'existed', 'was', 'grounded', 'fear', 'subversive', 'minority', 'fear', 'looming', 'external', 'enemy', 'Maybe', 'best', 'example', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'manufactured', 'fear', 'Roman', 'stayed', 'power', 'selling', 'defenders', 'realm', 'Rome', 'feared', 'enemies', 'first', 'Carthage', 'then', 'Jews', 'then', 'Christians', 'then', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'finally', 'other', 'empire', 'split', 'apart', 'way', 'was', 'fear', 'slave', 'revolts', 'really', 'enabled', 'Rome', 'rulers', 'maintain', 'police', 'state', 'empire', 'gladiatorial', 'combats', 'sponsored', 'Rome', 'was', 'key', 'inspiration', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'was', 'where', 'Rome', 'captured', 'enemies', 'were', 'disposed', 'Guilt', 'penance', 'were', 'little', 'use', 'keeping', 'Roman', 'emperors', 'power', 'nowhere', 'film', 'do', 'see', 'national', 'government', 'capitol', 'use', 'fear', 'Other', 'way', 'keep', 'hold', 'power', 'So', 'overall', 'film', 'out', 'casting', 'acting', 'rarity', 'Hollywood', 'days.As', 'package', 'well', 'film', 'disc', 'theatrical', 'release', 'extended', 'edition', 'here', 'trailers', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'So', 'patient', 'fan', 'would', 'recommend', 'waiting', '3', 'films', 'are', 'available', 'together', 'one', 'package']",N/A

Henning,"[1, 2]","""The Hunger Games"" is a science fiction action film.The narrative is futuristic with a wide social class system that divides the affluent capitol and 12 oppressed districts. This repression is the consequence of an apocalyptic conflict which occurred over 75 years prior to when the story is set.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are both from the coal mining District 12. The film essentially focuses on their participation in the 74th Hunger Games, which is a last person standing contest to the death, and it is a major entertainment event for the people of the capitol.

Would I resort to killing to stay alive, and bless my district? It was hard to think about. So, I simply sat back and watched. Katniss and Peeta do most of that sort of thinking for you, but it makes you wonder about your own convictions if put into such a situation.The filming was excellent, for the most part. Near the beginning, and a few times later on, the camera shook so much that it nauseated me, and I couldn't tell for the life of me what was happening. The broad contrast in colors from District 12 to the Capitol was really cool, and that leads me to my next observation.The Capitol really showed off its pomp and reliance on style. There were so many crazy and absurd ways of showing off their ""beauty"" that it made me sick. It starts just by wanting to get noticed. Reminds one of hollywood, eh? *chuckle*The gore was not very prevalent, which is good. In some cases, though (such as the death near the end), the violence is implied very intensely. That really bothered me, but it's a story to make you bothered at The Capitol. It did it's job well.Peeta and Katniss' characters were done well. Peeta didn't seem to show much depth, however, while Katniss did. Her reaction to her sister was chosen as tribute was heartbreaking. Judging from her excellent work in X-Men: First Class, she will go very far.In respect to the novel of the same name, it did very well! The slight few things that differed, improved the film. Seeing the book on the silver screen worked wonders, no matter if we knew the story already or not.The length of the movie, nearly 2.5 hours, was actually quite necessary. The preparation for the games required lots of attention, as did the games themselves, obviously. The time spent in each area was well-determined.I am pretty glad they didn't make this movie 3D.

I was not familiar with the books and had never even heard of the title until this last spring when news of it was everywhere. I thought ""hmm...sounds like another movie targeted at tweens/teens like the Twilight movies"". Boy was I wrong!!! Twilight is not even in the same league as this movie and will fade away over time. What makes this movie so great is the story as well as the great acting. This movie is destined to become a CLASSIC in the mold of Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and other 'totalitarian state"" movies/books. The story is eerily like where the world actually appears headed...where the elite 1% have 99% of the wealth and everyone else shares the remaining 1% of the wealth. And hence, the depiction of the decadence of the rich and their disdain for ""the masses"" really hits home and builds up our emotional ""involvement"" in the movie. Clearly, the author was shooting to sensitive us to the dangers of where we are headed. Anyway, the movie plot/story really feeds on this ""us vs them"" dynamic and does so brilliantly. What could be worse than the 1% demanding a ""tribute"" in the form of taking our children to die in a gory spectacle for their evil pleasure? The acting in this movie is superb by both the veterans and new-comers. The two main protagonists are both very appealing and you really want them to pull through. Donald Sutherland as the ""king"" of the 1% plays his role to evil perfection. And Woody....sleeper for best supporting actor? Too many great performance to list here. The cinematography is excellent and the scenes of battle/conflict are grim and realistic. And the feelings of young adults faced with being thrust into such a situation are played well. And lastly, the actress who plays Katniss is so ""hot"" that my new LCD TV almost melted. Another actress in this role and the movie would be still be good. But Jennifer puts this movie over the top...perfect casting.

1341611,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B003EYVXV4,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[3, 7]","Lionsgate's Easter blockbuster is a lengthy, high-octane dramatisation ofThe Hunger Games, a ""young adult"" novel by Suzanne Collins. It is the first in a series about which I'd heard nothing before this screening. My eleven-year-old son tells me it is quite the thing at the moment. He's read the whole series and was mightily aggrieved to find out that his square old Dad was going to see it and not someone more fully deserving, like himself.Life's like that, son - which is more or less the starting premise of the screenplay. The Hunger Games skips nimbly from the heroic quest via a cutting social satire - our vacuous TV lives are mocked in the style of Neil Postman'sAmusing Ourselves to Death- to a pretty blunt commentary on contemporary geopolitics (the backdrop is a close simile for the Arab Spring), without ever forgetting the momentum and pulse of a great story. Director Gary Ross easily could have laid on the sanctimony too thickly but his touch was light and the picture was the more effective for it.The premise is simple: post apocalypse, there is a ruling clique in the Capitol. They live contented if empty lives by exploiting the plebian ghettoes surrounding their city. As punishment for a long distant uprising, each year two dozen proletariat children are picked out from these ""districts"" to fight to the death for the titillation of the Capitol's chattering classes.Here you'll surmise, correctly, that the story is heavily derivative, but of so many things it blurs. There are shades of1984,Mad Max,Blade Runner,King Arthur,The Running Man,Lost,The Fifth Element,The Truman Show, Avatar, Total Wipeout and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here. There were no straight rip-offs, but it was difficult to say the film was any meaningful way novel.But it was executed with plenty of style, with much frenetic use of steadycam. I was sitting in the second row, cowed before a football-field sized screen. I had real trouble keeping the whole thing in focus. The jumpier scenes faded in and out dizzily and it was hard to take in without getting a headache.Nonetheless Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, looking not a million miles from a ninja Laura Ingalls), dominates the screen and has more than enough presence to carry the drama. She musters chemistry with pretty much every character on the set except Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her notional romantic interest, who is a fellow combatant she must, in theory, kill if she is to survive. Hutcherson is badly miscast as a beta-male gladiator, and was in any case asked to play the most conflicted of all the characters. We suspect Katmiss pined instead for lantern-jawed Gale (Liam Hemsworth) an under-explained hunk, or an effete Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) - anyone, in fact, other than Peeta. Even Donald Sutherland's President Snow.For a long film with a long build-up, the background exposition was rushed. The tragic history of the Everdeen family was really only hinted at. Katniss' mother (Paula Malcolmson) is emotionally unstable in ways that aren't explained, and is scripted only moon-faced stares to convey her inner conflict. Partly, there are too many characters doing not enough each to make for a tight backstory. Some economising on roles would have helped a good deal.Still, the film works surprisingly well. The drama struck me, at first, of being a little pat (a rap on TV Reality Gameshows, suggesting contestants really are gladiatorial victims self-wounding for the titillation of the great unwashed) but as it developed the heroic aspect resonated more clearly with more recent geopolitical unrest. Wikipedia reveals that Collins' inspiration came to her when channel surfing between reality TV and CNN's coverage of the invasion of Iraq. This has been cannily updated in terms of the Arab Spring, and in particular the current situation in Syria.""Give them hope,"" mutters Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley), another otiose character in a film full of them, ""but not too much hope.""At which point one must mention a splendid turn from Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) providing comic relief and vital plot exposition, at least until he resorted to parachuting lines of his script into the rest of the cast rather than saying them (you think I'm exaggerating, don't you).Through some convenient contrivances the seemingly inevitable downbeat ending was avoided, and resolute stares from all assembled at what was a rather unfulfilling conclusion suggest strongly that more episodes from Collins' series are planned.This is a well executed film which is well shot, well scripted, well edited and well paced - although it was a good twenty minutes longer than it needed to be.Olly BuxtonFlickfeast",4,"Cluttered, and overlong, but exciting nonetheless.

My daughter devoured the books and we decided to go to the midnight show at our local drive in theater.The Hunger Games movie is entertaining, but when compared to the book it falls short in several departments (like nearly every other book-to-film adaptation).One major disappointment was that the background of the Mockingjay pin was inaccurate. I don't plan on posting any spoilers here but you can comment here and I can post specifics.Katniss' costume for the Districts introduction was kind of lame. I was expecting them to really pull off some cool costume but ehh on that.There are several other things in the movie that just didn't happen at all in the book and several things were changedThe actors were all fantastic and I especially got a kick out of Elizabeth Banks' Effie and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. Too bad they didn't focus on him as much as in the book.Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman- wow awesome- just as I imagined! And Lenny Kravitz was so endearing and wonderful as Cinna! Jennifer Lawrence was great as Katniss and brought such humanity, loyalty, and focus of what it all meant to be in the Hunger Games. This was a 2 hour and 22 minute movie and it easily could have been longer to accommodate more specifics of the book.Overall, it was a good movie, but you can find things to nitpick if you are a huge fan of the books.

When I heard that Gary Ross was directing the movie version, I had high hopes because of the quality of his previous films (such as Seabiscuit.) This filming of the book is generally very faithful. Inevitably, it leaves out some aspects (such as the mute slaves.) The casting is nearly ideal, with standout performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Henderson, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, and Elizabeth Banks. But, the production, expensive as it was, seems to lose some of the grandeur that the book creates because of lack of resources. The initial reaping has too few applicants - it is, after all, the collective young people from a whole district which may have more than a million people. The riot scenes are all too obviously filmed close so that the poverty of extras isn't obvious. The views of the Capital are momentary instead of awe-inspiring. The design is excellent, but the implimenation seems to be too sparse. The hand-held camera is particularly annoying: close and shaky, it is supposed to suggest a documentary but seems all-too-obviously a ploy to distract from the small cast. Nevertheless, the human aspects come through very well, particularly given the very high level of artistry among the actors.I recommend this film.",4,An Excellent Dramatization,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1310,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Hunger', 'Game', 'books', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'When', 'heard', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'was', 'directing', 'movie', 'version', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'quality', 'previous', 'films', 'such', 'Seabiscuit', 'filming', 'book', 'generally', 'very', 'faithful', 'Inevitably', 'out', 'aspects', 'such', 'mute', 'slaves', 'casting', 'nearly', 'ideal', 'standout', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Josh', 'Henderson', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'production', 'expensive', 'was', 'lose', 'grandeur', 'book', 'lack', 'resources', 'initial', 'reaping', 'too', 'few', 'applicants', 'collective', 'young', 'people', 'whole', 'district', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'million', 'people', 'riot', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'close', 'poverty', 'extras', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'views', 'Capital', 'are', 'momentary', 'instead', 'awe-inspiring', 'design', 'excellent', 'implimenation', 'be', 'too', 'sparse', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'close', 'shaky', 'supposed', 'suggest', 'documentary', 'all-too-obviously', 'ploy', 'distract', 'small', 'cast', 'Nevertheless', 'human', 'aspects', 'come', 'very', 'well', 'particularly', 'given', 'very', 'high', 'level', 'artistry', 'actors.I', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

From the bleak and gray District 12, to the ridiculously fashionable and indulgent Capitol, the movie accurately depicts many characters and scenes from the novel. If you haven't read the book, the basic premise is that many years in the future, the country of Panem (basically North America) is divided into 12 districts and ruled by one president. Every year, a teenage boy and girl from each district are selected via a lottery system to participate in the Hunger Games. The resulting 24 tributes are trussed up and paraded around the Capitol before being thrust into an arena where only one will survive. Katniss, the strong and brave central character, must utilize her cunning and resourcefulness to win the games. However, with her fate determined by the gamekeepers, and her growing relationship with Peeta, the other district contestant, the odds of her survival are slim.I am a firm believer in that books are generally better than film adaptations. And while that remains true in this case, I thought that the movie was able to portray the book pretty similarly to how I had imagined it. There were many relationships between Katniss and other characters- her mother, Rue, Peeta, Gale- that I wish would have been further explored, but I think the filmmakers did the best they could in the limited time available. My only complaint is that I did not enjoy the shaky-camera effect. It made it hard to focus on the scene and sometimes was kind of dizzying. I understand the images they were trying to create, but it was a little overdone, in my opinion.Please note that while the movie is not overly gory or bloody, there are some scenes that might be too violent for viewers under 13.

Just found a little bit boring the second disc with the special features that were just a sequence of interviews with the producers, cast and director boasting about their work as if it were something exceptional. Well, in my opinion they just did what they were expected to do as professionals; like in any other profession.With that said, while I was watching the movie, I started wondering if Suzanne Collins ever read Japanese manga from late 1950/early 1960. Why? Because the story she is telling is so similar to a manga I read while I was learning to read in early 1960. Yes, I learned to read, reading manga. The difference being that the two warriors actually died at the end; but not because they fought to death. In that manga, the two warriors are on different sides and they were required to wear masks and were never referred to by names, but by numbers only. And at the end, when only two warriors were still alive and at their final battle, one warrior manages to cut out his opponent's mask, thus revealing that the other warrior was a female. More than that, that the girl was someone he loved deeply (yes, a star-crossed lover) and the revelation makes him hesitate to deliver the final blow.She, then, takes the opportunity given by his hesitation and attacks. Just to find out that he was just warding her attack off and purposefully avoiding hurting her. This enrages her for she thinks he feels superior because she is a female. And then, she manages to rip his mask off and the truth is revealed....They were a long lost love of each other. But bound by honor, one must kill the other. She offers her life but he refuses to kill her and asks her to kill him instead. Honor demands. The final solution: they kill each other in a seppuku style.Of course, this kind of ending is not suitable for the American taste and therefore, Katniss and Peeta would never be allowed to eat the deadly poisonous berry...The storyline is actually not original. There was an episode in the Sliders TV Series where the premise was exactly the same: A game of death with only one victor allowed; and other movies with similar storyline.Anyways, like they say: there are no creation in entertainment, only imitation: art imitating Life and one producer imitating the other, etc. etc.",5,BEWARE: SPOILER in this review,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,2378,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'Just', 'found', 'little', 'bit', 'boring', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'just', 'sequence', 'interviews', 'producers', 'cast', 'director', 'boasting', 'work', 'were', 'something', 'exceptional', 'Well', 'opinion', 'just', 'did', 'what', 'were', 'expected', 'do', 'professionals', 'other', 'profession.With', 'said', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'started', 'wondering', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'ever', 'read', 'Japanese', 'manga', 'late', '1950/early', '1960', 'Why', 'story', 'telling', 'so', 'similar', 'manga', 'read', 'was', 'learning', 'read', 'early', '1960', 'Yes', 'learned', 'read', 'reading', 'manga', 'difference', 'being', 'two', 'warriors', 'actually', 'died', 'end', 'not', 'fought', 'death', 'manga', 'two', 'warriors', 'are', 'different', 'sides', 'were', 'required', 'wear', 'masks', 'were', 'never', 'referred', 'names', 'numbers', 'only', 'end', 'when', 'only', 'two', 'warriors', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'final', 'battle', 'one', 'warrior', 'cut', 'out', 'opponent', 'mask', 'thus', 'revealing', 'other', 'warrior', 'was', 'female', 'More', 'girl', 'was', 'someone', 'loved', 'deeply', 'yes', 'star-crossed', 'lover', 'revelation', 'hesitate', 'deliver', 'final', 'blow.She', 'then', 'opportunity', 'given', 'hesitation', 'attacks', 'Just', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'warding', 'attack', 'purposefully', 'avoiding', 'hurting', 'superior', 'female', 'then', 'rip', 'mask', 'truth', 'revealed', '.They', 'were', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'other', 'honor', 'one', 'must', 'kill', 'other', 'life', 'kill', 'kill', 'instead', 'Honor', 'final', 'solution', 'kill', 'other', 'seppuku', 'style.Of', 'course', 'kind', 'ending', 'not', 'suitable', 'American', 'taste', 'therefore', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'eat', 'deadly', 'poisonous', 'berry', 'storyline', 'actually', 'not', 'original', 'was', 'episode', 'Sliders', 'TV', 'Series', 'where', 'premise', 'was', 'exactly', 'same', 'game', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'victor', 'allowed', 'other', 'movies', 'similar', 'storyline.Anyways', 'say', 'are', 'creation', 'entertainment', 'only', 'imitation', 'art', 'imitating', 'Life', 'one', 'producer', 'imitating', 'other', 'etc', 'etc']",N/A

I thought it was one of the current, endless dark, violent, plot-weak/less ""shallow"" movies that rates way up there for teens.  Despite the number of people who rated it, and the near 5.0 star rating from so many, I was not going to watch it.I changed my mind when my husband told me he believed ""Katniss Everdeen"" was, in real life, a professional archer (as is Geena Davis.)

1341750,A39W3263A9HCMN,B003EYVXV4,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[8, 13]","In all honesty, I appreciate the efforts of Gary Ross and co. He did what he could with what is really difficult source material, and in some form he managed to really pull it off. The film has great graphics and such, and right off the bat it already feels more intimate than your typical blockbuster thanks to some very low-key mood setting and handheld camera.But judging by the way the story is presented, this ultimately felt more like a fan movie than an official presentation. I mean yes there are flashes of brilliance throughout- one in particular being the Countdown scene. A moment of quiet brilliance. The embrace between Cinna and Katniss, the elevator to the arena, etc. Then the sudden blast into brutal violence. I will also admit found Haymitch to be hilarious too, great acting from Woody Harrelson. I knew when I read the book that he had to be played by Woody, and I got what I hoped.One more positive comment: Jennifer Lawrence was amazing, she was not an Oscar nominee for nothing people. She really helped lift the movie off the ground. She IS Katniss and she managed to keep the movie running, though weak and sloppy it may be.Now for the bad parts. Warning there's tons of spoilers.First, if I had to narrow down what I loved about the book to one thing was its intensity. Sure the book wasn't particularly amazingly written but Susanne knew how to keep a rising line of tension throughout the book. She kept the action constant, the violence brutal and she saved the romance for when appropriate. The movie has almost zero suspense in the action scenes. I get that the filmmakers wanted to go for that ""silent action"" thing, and problem is for this movie it doesn't work. It worked for Haywire, it worked for Edge of Darkness, it worked for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but for a movie about a bunch of kids forced to kill each other.The next big problem was there was not very much development. Sure Katniss is well developed but thats only because she is the protagonist. We don't get a sense that the kids in the other districts are connected, etc. Peeta's backstory is COMPLETELY CUT OUT. Primrose comes and goes. Effie Trinket gets a small amount of development in the sense that she as been around since the reaping began but that's it.Oh, and the adaptation discontinuity. Cutting out various big parts (Madge Undersee, AVOX,  etc) while emphasizing on smaller parts (Rue's death goes on for an atrociously long 10 minutes. They know each other for like 2 minutes then suddenly they are trying to get her out from the net, then she gets speared and Katniss cries for 10 minutes) and adding in parts that AREN'T IN THE BOOK (When Cato and the careers see smoke they leave a kid behind, and Foxface steals food without anyone knowing. So then Katniss tries stealing supplies and blows them up. And she doesnt go deaf or lose an ear.I guess it's a good standalone movie and those who haven't read the book will like it.

It is a Godless and hopless society, and the only religion is a basic ""worship"" of the leadership, whose word is law, from whom life and death decisions are dropped like a used kleenex. The elitists have their usual opulence and surplus, and wave it in the face of those who produced it but cannot enjoy for themselves.

Hawthorne,Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy,the mentor,Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman,the show host,Donald Sutherland as President Coriolanus Snow and many others.It is a solid cast in an overly long movie that the film makers successfully pull you into at the beginning,but bog down in unnecessary detail during the actual games.The story finds the country divided into districts,12 of them to be exact.After a bloody uprising over 75 years before,society has rebuilt a dystopian world for itself.Each district annually must bring forth two volunteers who compete in a life or death scenario;in an age group of 12-18 years.This is in payment/tribute for past sins while ensuring obedience for the future.The games are held in the capitol city and the farther away people travel to the games,the more impoverished their district is.Our protagonist is Katniss who comes from district 12.She lives a hand to mouth existence and when the call comes for people to register for the games,the scene is something out of a concentration camp.This year Katniss's younger sister is picked but Katniss volunteers to take her place;a gutsy move.Katniss and another local lad are whisked into the capitol city aboard an opulently styled train,filled with food and other delights,none have ever seen before.This is two weeks before the actual games.During that time the two are assigned a mentor,appear on local TV and the more favour they garner,the more sponsors they can pick up.The sponsors can actually help them during the games.It is a whirlwind two weeks,much of it media geared,but at the end the games DO inevitably begin.24 teens are thrust together in a forested area,with a cache of weapons and supplies within reach,but when the alarm sounds to begin Katniss rushes away from the cache to higher ground;advice she follows from her mentor.The cache soon becomes a killing ground and only half the number remain.Katniss is pursued relentlessly by a group,one of which is her friend from her district.When she is chased up a tree her pursuers wait her out.She spots a nest of tracker-jackers,genetically engineered wasps.She drops it on them and while one out of the group perishes,she is also stung.She comes down but is delirious.Her friend from her district tells her to run but she only goes so far before she collapses.A young girl from a different district helps her.They become fast friends and work together,until the girls untimely demise.Katniss eventually finds her friend from her district in a bad way and nurses him back to health.However the two have become close and the media plays it up as two star crossed lovers and even change the rules to allow two victors from the same district instead of one.The games continue until finally the two friends and one of the favoured males from the first district come together on top of a weapons cache.Not only do they struggle against each other but there are four big and vicious cat-like creatures below waiting to feed.The district one male goes over and the two remain.Suddenly the rules are changed once more to allow only one victor.They agree to eat poison berries together,but before they do so,the rules are changed back.They have to have someone as a victor,and their deaths would have denied that;they must not let the public down.The film ends as Katniss and her fellow district 12 friend,return home once more to a rousing reception.The film,in the beginning,takes its time to show you the world you are about to enter and once it grabs you it keeps you;for a time.The absolute decadence of the capitol city compared to the desolate countryside and deprivation there is stark,to say the least.When the actual games begin,that is where this film bogs down.Too much detail and an overly long scenario takes place there.Judicious editing should have been the word of the day here.We also expect our heroine to be more assertive and powerful during the games,than she is.We soon come to realize that she is just as ordinary as anyone else,strong personality aside.And of course this is going against formula and that is perfectly alright,and I get that.However more than once she is saved from certain death by the most formulaic of circumstances;for example,she is about to be killed by another district female and she is in turn killed by the partner of the little girl she befriended who comes out of nowhere,as an altruistic gesture of thanks,or we have the actual killing of the little girl,as a sword flies through the air and should have hit Katniss,but hits the girl instead(bait and switch).That,of course,is bound to give our heroine the extra strength she needs to carry on;as formulaic as it comes.Despite these criticisms,the cast is strong and the plot,despite its obvious weak points,is still an interesting one overall.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras on the one disc DVD which I am reviewing here.All in all an intriguing look at a future complete with death games,worked into its dystopian dynamic.The film moves along fine until too much attention to detail bogs the film down in what should be its most exciting moments.Unfortunate.3 1/2-4 stars.It could/should have been better.",4,An intriguing story goes slightly awry!,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,5373,"['Hunger', 'Games',

1341799,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003EYVXV4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","The Hunger Games (Gary Ross, 2012)Terence Malick's desecration of James Jones' greatest novel, The Thin Red Line, sits at #4 on my list of the one hundred worst movies of all time. While the catalog of faults there are to be found with the film is approximately the length of the average encyclopedia, there's one glaring problem with the thing that always stands out in my head: it ends halfway through the book. Well, almost. That truncated speech George Clooney shows up to give five minutes before the end of the movie? That is the exact halfway point of the novel. They compressed the entire second half of a six-hundred-plus page novel into five minutes of screen time. Now, given that, what do you expect I'm going to say about The Hunger Games? I grant you, the compression wasn't that drastic, but you're talking about a movie that runs over two hours (and, it should be noted--this may be considered a spoiler alert, but I don't give a damn--the last eight minutes of the movie are credits. Eight minutes of end credits.), and Katniss and Peeta don't find that cave until there's less than forty minutes of movie left (and eight minutes of that are end credits)? Doubleyou-tee-eff, Gary Ross and Suzanne Collins?For this paragraph, you can simply cut and paste everything I wrote in my review of the novel re: how similar it is to Battle Royale, though the movie highlighted a key point in the difference between the two I hadn't really considered before: one of the reasons Takami Koshoun's book is so successful at what it does is the razor-sharp satire. The film adaptation of it, while not nearly as successful as the book, takes the satire and jacks it up a few notches, to the point where portions of the movie are flat-out comedy. (That first scene in the abandoned classroom? That's an exercise in tension in the book. In the movie, it's comedy gold--it's the movie's best scene.) Collins' novel certainly has satirical qualities, but she traded most of the satire to go the dystopian-fiction route. This is neither a surprise, in today's YA literary culture, nor necessarily a bad thing; I thought it worked well in the novel. In this adaptation, by comparison, all of the satire has been leached out. This thing is serious as a heart attack. Even Haymitch is clean and well-coiffed throughout, which is kinda ridiculous if you're the town drunk. And the dead-flat seriousness serves to highlight the superiority of BR. This is SENSITIVE DYSTOPIAN FICTION DAMMIT, PAY ATTENTION. Oh, for the love of pete. Give it a rest. If you don't know people are watching this movie for the sheer joy of watching teenagers beat on one another, you've kind of missed the entire point.I'm blaming that one solely on Collins, because Ross, once he got behind the camera and started directing this silly thing, obviously did not forget that, and as a result the movie's main strengths are its action sequences. This is not necessarily a surprise (Seabiscuit, anyone?). That first scene at the Cornucopia... but I'm getting ahead of myself.NOTE: the plot summary may be construed to contain spoilers based on how the novel unfolds, but they were things mentioned up front in the movie (I am assuming the script was written based on ""everyone who's going to go see this already read the book, so...""); if you have done neither, you may want to do one or the other before reading and/or skip the next paragraph.Plot: Panem is a post-apocalyptic America that, since an uprising almost seventy-five years ago, has been separated into twelve districts. The higher the number, the poorer the district. Katniss Everdeen (Winter's Bone's Jennifer Lawrence) lives with the remains of her family in District 12 (in modern-day America, this is the rural Appalachians), whose main function in Panem is the mining of coal. Katniss' father was a coal miner; he died in an industrial accident years before the opening of the film, which sent her mother (Tombstone's Paula Malcomson) spiralling into a depression from which she has never emerged, leaving Katniss and her younger sister Primrose (Beyond the Blackboard's Willow Shields, whom I believe has the distinction of being the first actor I have ever named in a review to have been born in the 2000s) to care for her. Katniss makes her living as a hunter beyond the bounds of the District. It's forbidden, and if she and her hunting partner Gale (Knowing's Liam Hemsworth) ever get caught they'll be in dutch, but no one who actually lives there cares; Katniss is well-known for being willing to barter her excess meat, and in fact the town's mayor is one of her best customers. All of which is minor details, really, as Panem, every year, holds the Hunger Games, a countrywide battle royale to which each district sends one male and one female according to a lottery with a complex system of entries. To make a long story short (the movie sure did), Primrose is chosen, and Katniss volunteers in her place. Peeta Mellark (Bridge to Terabithia's Josh Hutcherson) (and I don't have a copy of the book close to hand, but I swear that last name was spelled ""Malark"" in the book) is her male counterpart, and the two of them are whisked off to District One, the capital city. (In the book, it is obvious this is in the Rocky Mountains; I always assumed it was Denver, for some reason.) They're being coached, somewhat, by Haymitch (Now You See Me's Woody Harrelson), the last person from District 12 to win the Hunger Games, and now the town roustabout. He doesn't often come up with good advice, but the two of them learn quickly that when he does, it's very wise to heed. For soon, they and twenty-two other teenagers are going to be sent into a coliseum, and only one can emerge alive....and thus, back to the action sequences. The entire second half of the movie, really, is one long action sequence with a few lulls, but there are a few pieces that really stick out. The opening sequence at the Cornucopia I mentioned up top may actually be the best scene in the movie, though Ross, unsurprisingly, glosses and soft-focuses a good deal of the violence therein; The Hunger Games was mandated as PG-13 rather than the hard-R of Battle Royale (or, more amusingly, 2010's Tomorrow, When the War Began--which is also based on a teen dystopian-fiction novel). There's a riot, which IMDB's trivia section notes was shot by ""second unit director Steven Soderbergh"", and when's the last time you heard that phrase?, that punctuates things nicely as well. Granted, you will get more out of these scenes if you've read the book, especially the climax. I'm tempted to offer the hypothesis that if you haven't read the book, in fact, the climax will seem a bit on the senseless side--they removed a lot of the context from the second half of the novel that gives the climax the punch it has in print.As for the acting, well, I just gave you the tip of the iceberg, though what a tip it is; Jennifer Lawrence can seemingly do anything. (I mean, she made The House at the End of the Street almost bearable.) And she holds her own against a case that also includes Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Alexander Ludwig, Stanley Tucci, and Jacqueline Emerson, among others. (You don't know that last name yet. You will.) To be succinct, which I haven't done too well in this review so far, everyone does the best with what they were given, really. The problem is, what they were given is so much less than it could have been. **",2,"The Long(ish) Stalk, abridged",1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,7466,"['Hunger', 'Games', 'Gary', 'Ross', '2012',

Since I haven't read the novels, I can't speak to the faithfulness in comparison with the source material, but for a book that supposed to be rather violent, the movie was very tame.  My biggest complaint would be the shaky-camera work, which, while useful in creating a sense of intensity or confusion, is quite headache-inducing and more importantly, obscures the action.  Among the positives were Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson, who I felt gave rather entertaining performances, and the lighter, more humorous bits of the film were more enjoyable to watch.  In regards to the preparation for the Games, I take issue with the backdrop of the whole affair, as it reeks of so-called &#34;reality&#34; TV, which I despise.

1341804,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B003EYVXV4,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 6]","Warning:  I will make no attempt to avoid spoilers here.After all the hype about this new dystopia, I found it rather disappointing for the most part.  This film is in 3 parts.  The first is to show the condition of the fenced-in proletariat worlds, which house slave laborers to a distant city.  It is realistic and well acted, a brutish existence with a great risk of chance, the games, which are designed to channel yet truncate hope.  That they choose children to kill eachother off is almost believable.Second, there is the new seemingly totalitarian aristocracy.  This is the weakest part of the film.  The collective baddies are walking caricatures, two-dimensional at best, but over-acted with an absurdity that isn't clever.  It's just odd looking.  Now a radically different future as parody, such as that in Fifth Element, can definitely work - what it takes is great imagination that weaves the details into a coherent vision, where questions have implied answers (think Dreyfus' bizarre behavior in Close Encounters).  It fails to make sense on an intuitive level that the viewer can accept without question.  Unfortunately,  the ""city"" simply appeared insipid, like someone made it up without thinking.  Perhaps I am asking too much, I had hoped for a masterpiece like, say, the heavily atmospheric Children of Men.  Woody Harrelson's character, as a mentor to Katniss as she develops her gladiator skills, is the only redeeming feature that truly works in this section.  It is a botched opportunity.Third, there is the game.  This is by far the strongest portion of the film, the core that brings out the strengths of character and body.  Katniss here is absolutely wonderful, played by a gifted actress with psychological nuance and desperate intelligence.  I was completely convinced by her plight and enjoyed her journey of self discovery.  She keeps her human compassion, doesn't shed her emotion even when asked to kill, and is willing to risk everything for another.  It is beautifully done.  The surprise resolution was also excellent, with the boy from her district delivering a moving performance.  This was worth the price of admission.  The conclusion, which reveals some of the politics of the ""city"", is somewhat better than the earlier portion, but again, the characters are too weak to be truly interesting to the point that they would enter the viewers' imagination.I would say this is a 3.5-star film.

Koretsky ""DIYer""","[0, 2]","Even though this film, and the book, have a predictable ending and plot development, I still like its allegorical message which is very optimistic, romantic, and brave. In my humble opinion, I see the world of the film as not so much a dystopic view of some possible future, but as a candid portrait and satire of our current post-capitalist dystopia. It helped me to realize that we currently live in a totalitarian, feudal, aristocratic, religious global society and culture, where the rich and powerful sacrifice the young in order to keep the lower classes in line. Think Iraq, Afganistan, Iran, .. Keep everyone afraid, hungry, oppressed, and ignorant/ stupid by hypnotizing them with hyperreal media.The ultra mediatized Spectacle society portrayed so beautifully in the movie, with the exaggerated super fashion bizarro look of the residents of the Capitol, reminded me so much of Guy Debord's revealing and incisive look at the Society of the Spectacle done in the 1960's, and still equally valid today in 2012. Panem is the American Empire, but where is our Katniss?Another observation on the metaphor and trope, I noticed that like many other post-apocalyptic films, after the great conflagration, it is always a reactionary, conservative, totalitarian regime that takes over the running of the world-as if the apocalypse always leads to regression and a return to a feudal society. A good example is ""The Handmaids Tale"" by Margaret Atwood, and the film based upon her book.Excellent movie and book, see the film and read the book(s).

The dramatic question is not will she make it, but will they let her make it. And that makes it less dramatic. All in all, an interesting movie but not a satisfying story. (""The Truman Show"" is a much better movie.) The whole Hunger Games thing almost feels like a con game, where the audience is being conned.

The film captures both the flavor and the essence of the best-selling novel, and this film is destined to become a classic. In point of fact, films as good as ""The Hunger Games"" only come around once in a while. This movie and story have a gripping, easy to follow plot that is full of surprises and action. And the film makes a powerful statement against totalitarianism. The real point of this story is the oppression exercised by ""The Capitol"" against the working class citizens of ""The Districts"" and the symbolic defeat of this oppression through the humanity and heroism of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen.Jennifer Lawrence is magnificent as Katniss Everdeen in this gripping story and is exactly as I had envisioned Katniss to be when I read the novel. The supporting cast is just as good, and the presence of Donald Sutherland as the heartless ""President Snow"" adds a pleasant surprise to this fine film. The callous manner in which the media stars at ""The Capitol"" embrace and enable the oppressive ""Hunger Games"" is particularly chilling, and the stars in this film do a matchless job of portraying this.This film and story are a superb work of imagination for all ages. The only caveat is that this is one violent film with numerous bloody sequences that are probably inappropriate for small children. In particular the viciousness of the ""career"" tributes is absolutely convincing and not something that a small child should be exposed to.After seeing this film we will all look forward to the second film in this trilogy.

Developmentally, the 10- to 12-year-olds who've read the book may find the movie's visceral, sometimes bloody teen-on-teen violence upsetting -- especially the brutal scene that opens the Games, in which several teens are slaughtered by their fellow contestants. Even young teens need to be mature enough to deal with the 20+ deaths in The Hunger Games; characters are viciously dispatched with various weapons -- including spears, arrows, and swords -- as well as by having their necks broken, their skulls cracked, and their bodies ravaged by carnivorous and poisonous creatures. Despite the violence (which is, overall, less graphic than the novel's descriptions but is still very intense), the movie explores thought-provoking themes about reality television, totalitarian government, and screen violence as entertainment. And Katniss, the main character, is a strong heroine who's resourceful, selfless, and a true survivor. Her mentor, Haymitch, is initially depicted as a cynical drunk, but he ultimately proves to be a valuable ally. more on this at [...]The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]",4,Ouch! not for kids under 13-teen.,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,1349,"['What', 'need', 'knowParents', 'need', 'know', 'bestselling', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'books', 'are', 'enormously', 'popular', 'tweens', 'clear', 'distinction', 'reading', 'violence', 'seeing', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'Developmentally', '10-', '12-year-olds', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'visceral', 'sometimes', 'bloody', 'teen-on-teen', 'violence', 'upsetting', 'especially', 'brutal', 'scene', 'Games', 'several', 'teens', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'fellow', 'contestants', 'Even', 'young', 'teens', 'need', 'be', 'mature', 'enough', 'deal', '20+', 'deaths', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'characters', 'are', 'viciously', 'dispatched', 'various', 'weapons', 'including', 'spears', 'arrows', 'swords', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'necks', 'broken', 'skulls', 'cracked', 'bodies', 'ravaged', 'carnivorous', 'poisonous', 'creatures', 'violence', 'overall', 'less', 'graphic', 'novel', 'descriptions', 'still', 'very', 'intense', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'themes', 'reality', 'television', 'totalitarian', 'government', 'screen', 'violence', 'entertainment', 'Katniss', 'main', 'character', 'strong', 'heroine', 'who', 'resourceful', 'selfless', 'true', 'survivor', 'mentor', 'Haymitch', 'initially', 'depicted', 'cynical', 'drunk', 'ultimately', 'be', 'valuable', 'ally', 'more', '[', 'Hunger', 'Games', '[', '2-Disc', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Ultra-Violet', 'Digital', 'Copy', ']']",N/A

1341898,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B003EYVXV4,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[2, 3]","First Impressions:  Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is now a major motion picture and though the film is quite well done, it pales to the richness of the first Collins' novel of the same name.The Hype:  Word of mouth has gotten around that Collins' novel is so similar to the Japanese novel ""Battle Royale"" that some have said it is a copy.  BR is also way more bloody and has a different angle to the whole ""government suppression and make kids fight our wars"" angle.  Regardless, the fight scenes appeal to the male viewers and the romance appeals to the women viewers, while the differences and similarities between the book and film remain in the cynical overview of the discerning reader!What's It About?:  I have read the book and have watched the film and yet don't want to bore the dear reader with the differences or similarities.  You can Google that!  No, I want to communicate what impressed me and some scenes I wish were lifted from the book to the screen that I would think would have enhanced my entertainment experience.Katniss Everdeen is a tough gal who flaunts the rules of her District by sneaking through a hole in an electric fence (which is not electrified, a fact mentioned and explained in the book but not the film) to meet her pal Gale and start shooting wild animals of the forest in exchange for food and supplies in their village.  This is forbidden by the government as the government wants to keep all Districts in line and run them hard and ragged.  Several police march around looking somewhat like CHP knockoffs, LOL.Katniss resents her mother for zoning out and not taking care of her and her sister.  This is shown through flashbacks in some parts of the film.  You can easily miss the closeness of the village communities if you did not read the book nor were familiar with Kat's mother and her descent into madness.  Gosh I wish that was better explored.Also Gale is clearly close to Katniss but she looks at him as a big brother of sorts.  The romantic triangle in the book is underplayed in favor of the actual Games themselves.The rest of the film deals with Katniss volunteering to be a Tribute in place of her sister (which would clearly be a death sentence), her naivety and her strength in terms of survival, of trust and of taking on the false pretenses of the Capitol society for her own and others' survival.Ultimate Reality Show:The Hunger Games is the ultimate reality show.  I wrote up as much in my earlier book review.  The direction of the film was the best part of the film!  Close-up of mouth and eye as Katniss breathes and centers before releasing the bow.  Haymitch dealing with his own alcoholism and defeatism as he shapes up Katniss (this is done better in the book where he is a falling down drunk!) and Katniss as she is torn apart emotionally in losing some of her dearest friends.  The ending is especially tense and brought to mind the same intensity from the book's ending.  Don't worry, no spoilers, but you don't want to miss that!Bottom Line:Hunger Games is entertaining and does take the best of the book and translates it to film through concentrating on the reality game show / gladiator aspect of the Games.  The colored hair, futuristic ambiance and the arrogant superiority of President Snow and his gang, really tie together a great little tale, though I'm afraid the readers of the book may be disappointed.  I wasn't.More Village?  Any word on District 13?  The struggle between the Girl on Fire and the cold, calculating Snow?  Anything on the ""pit crew"" who put Kat together for the Games?  See the film and get back to me on that!Recommended!Cast & Crew:Directed byGary RossWriting creditsGary Ross  (screenplay) andSuzanne Collins  (screenplay) andBilly Ray  (screenplay)Suzanne Collins  (novel)Cast (in credits order)Stanley Tucci ...

1341906,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B003EYVXV4,Scrimshaw,"[0, 1]","I just finished watching The Hunger Games about a half an hour ago, so it is still fresh in my mind. It truly was, in my view anyway, a truly amazing film filled with beauty, tragedy, adventure, and hope all combined to create a masterpiece. And despite clearly being influenced by, among others, today's trashy reality tv, the film itself is not trashy or lowbrow at all, which in today's entertainment world, is a breath of fresh air. It stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, both from District 12 in the post-apocalyptic dystopian society of Panem, located in futuristic North America. Every year in Panem, there is a slaughterfest in the form of a televised event called The Hunger Games which takes the form of two ""tributes"" from all 12 districts, which unlike the Capitol of Panem, are very poor and exploited. These tributes must then face off against each other against other tributes in a battle to the death during the annual Hunger Games, where there can be only one victor remaining alive out of the original 24. Katniss is a tough girl, having to live her entire life amongst squalor and poverty and because of this, she volunteers as tribute in place of her younger sister Primrose, who as it is made clear in the beginning scenes, is far less strong than her older sister. The first half of the film focuses on the tributes preparing for the hunger games and showing off their talents to the judges in hopes of winning their favor. And it is essentially this aspect of the film that prevents it from getting 5 stars from me, it takes too long to focus on the actual combat scenes, and was quite boring, but luckily, once the actual combat begins, the film really takes off and because very exciting and thrilling, as well as brutal and sad. I'll be the first to admit that some of the death scenes, for a PG-13 film, were quite disturbing and sad, especially considering that these are children getting killed, children who have grown up in poverty and never gotten the opportunity to see how wonderful and joyful life can be. And yet despite this, they still manage to have compassion and love for one another, especially the lovely, adorable girl Rue, who saves Katniss's life at one point. Of course, there are other kids who are much more bloodthirsty and violent, showing the other, darker side of humanity prevalent in us all. And it's not at all surprising that they're like this, considering the dystopian society that's all they've ever known. All in all, The Hunger Games is an amazing film that was spawned from what I understand to be a truly addicting novel written by Susan Collins. I'll definitely look forward to more films in this series.",4,An amazing Dystopian Film relatable to present day society,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,2715,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'half', 'hour', 'ago', 'still', 'fresh', 'mind', 'truly', 'was', 'view', 'anyway', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'filled', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'adventure', 'hope', 'combined', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'clearly', 'being', 'influenced', 'others', 'today', 'trashy', 'reality', 'tv', 'film', 'not', 'trashy', 'lowbrow', 'today', 'entertainment', 'world', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Peeta', 'Mellark', 'District', '12', 'post-apocalyptic', 'dystopian', 'society', 'Panem', 'located', 'futuristic', 'North', 'America', 'year', 'Panem', 'slaughterfest', 'form', 'televised', 'event', 'called', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'form', 'two', 'tributes', '12', 'districts', 'Capitol', 'Panem', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'exploited', 'tributes', 'must', 'then', 'face', 'off', 'other', 'other', 'tributes', 'battle', 'death', 'annual', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'victor', 'remaining', 'alive', 'original', '24', 'Katniss', 'tough', 'girl', 'having', 'live', 'entire', 'life', 'amongst', 'squalor', 'poverty', 'tribute', 'place', 'younger', 'sister', 'Primrose', 'who', 'made', 'clear', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'far', 'less', 'strong', 'older', 'sister', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'tributes', 'preparing', 'hunger', 'games', 'showing', 'off', 'talents', 'judges', 'hopes', 'winning', 'favor', 'essentially', 'aspect', 'film', 'getting', '5', 'stars', 'too', 'long', 'focus', 'actual', 'combat', 'scenes', 'was', 'quite', 'boring', 'luckily', 'once', 'actual', 'combat', 'film', 'really', 'very', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'as', 'well', 'brutal', 'sad', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'death', 'scenes', 'PG-13', 'film', 'were', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'sad', 'especially', 'considering', 'are', 'children', 'getting', 'killed', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'poverty', 'never', 'gotten', 'opportunity', 'see', 'how', 'wonderful', 'joyful', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'yet', 'still', 'manage', 'have', 'compassion', 'love', 'one', 'especially', 'lovely', 'adorable', 'girl', 'Rue', 'who', 'Katniss', 'life', 'one', 'point', 'course', 'are', 'other', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'bloodthirsty', 'violent', 'showing', 'other', 'darker', 'side', 'humanity', 'prevalent', 'not', 'surprising', ""'re"", 'considering', 'dystopian', 'society', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'spawned', 'what', 'understand', 'be', 'truly', 'addicting', 'novel', 'written', 'Susan', 'Collins', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'films', 'series']",N/A

The movie is strongly suggestive of the excesses of Rome, in it's final days. The premise is that to stop wars they pull a male and female champion from each district (they have split the world/country into districts.) The champions are turned loose in the booby trapped forrest, to fight to the death.  Until one and only one emerges the ultimate champion for that year. Of course the powers that be are not content to allow natural selection to  decide which champion is truly champion. Like strange puppet-masters they feel it necessary to pull the strings and make the final outcome, one they control. The casting contains unknowns and well knowns. All of which did an excellent and believable job bringing this futuristic movie to the big screen.I have to add that I bought an Amazon prime account at Christmas time (which literally paid for itself by New Years.) This account had a benefit that I didn't count on. I watched this movie, at no added cost and without joining a club, in the comfort of my living room.

But the idea intrigued me right off from the beginning, so I ordered a copy on blu-ray way back in May or June.Amazon offered me a free copy of the movie digitally (These are usually $10-15 USD), I suppose because the movie was released on Friday or Saturday and the movie wouldn't arrive in the mail til at least Monday (they generally have the item to you on the day of release if you have the two-day service (I bought Amazon Prime, so get ""free"" 2-day shipping)), so I was pretty excited and began to watch just as the movie became available at midnight in our time zone.I was enthralled from the first second to the end.  Katniss is played wonderfully by Jennifer Lawrence, who I think does a wonderful job of acting a responsible person, capable of making difficult choices, as well as a soft and caring person.  I have not seen this played so well by another actor or actress before, so it was wonderful to see!It was also so easy to see the evil of the capitol and those living there, versus the humility and goodness of the poorer people from outlying districts.  What does it take for the higher ups to become excited and bask in the glory of their ""victories"", while sending off innocent young people to lose their lives?  Well, it happens every time evil dictators begin wars for their own selfish purposes.  It is a reality and has been since the beginning of time.  I think for the young people who watch or read ""The Hunger Games"", much has been made obvious, rather than hidden in allegory and symbolism, although there is still much of this for the adult to enjoy.My copy comes today (I hope!), so I can watch it on the big TV in all its blu-ray splendour!  I will loan it out to a co-worker the next day for him to watch, as well.  I'm very excited to watch it again and I've already watched it twice on the ""little"" screen in not such good quality.But whatever you may think of ""The Hunger Games"" and other books (so far) in this ""franchise"", this much is undeniable.

Katniss Everdeen (a fairly wooden Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to go this year, in the place of her much-younger sister, and her male counterpart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) - seemingly more brawn than brains - joins her in the forced games of death ... which, ultimately in this film, aren't all that exciting or even involving (with a few exceptions) when you don't really give a hang about the main characters. Kat and Peeta, for me, had ZERO chemistry together on-screen, and the entire film in fact comes across with an air of sterility and coldness that keeps you from getting emotionally attached to anyone or anything. And its nothing like 'Battle Royale' unless you remade it, TOTALLY Americanized it, and THEN molded the entire thing for the atypical 'Twilight' fan.

The film is not as bad a rendition of the novel, there were moments that took me right back to the book which were nicely done. I loved the casting of everyone except for Sine and Peter (what were they thinking with this peter!).  But here's what I think, this book is very rich, nuanced and detailed and the movie simply rushed right through the story leaving out many layers.  I believe the Hunger Games trilogy would have been better if it were turned into a high quality 3 season teleseries where they allow for all the relevant content of the book to be realized over time and keep the version as close to the book as possible, I would have preferred that to the thin shell of a rush job. However for what it is they did a decent job.  Visually I think they caught the feeling and aesthetic of the novel. They totally botched to Cornucopia which was a large gold structure and they totally downsized the tail end of the game which was fierce. The film didn't catch the darkness portrayed in the book and I don't like the way they downplayed the significance of the Mockingjay pin.  There was so much material in the book they could have tapped into but again that would have taken an HBO tele series or something like that, not a one shot film.

The film would have been stronger shown solely through her perspective, as the book was.Apart from showing how oddly and ornately people in the Capital dressed, there wasn't a real sense of disparity between the lives of those in the Capital as opposed to the poor districts.  For that matter, the feel of the Capital came off more like a Rocky Horror parade than the sinister society that it is.Reducing the Games to merely reality TV competition undermined the story's theme of dire survival.

I just watched the movie, and for me it was so good that I look forward to watching it again on Blu Ray with my family. Then I looked at some of the negative reviews, and it turns out that most of them can be grouped into three common themes. Let me just say that this is a great movie, and you should at minimum get it into your rental queue. And since there are already hundreds of reviews at this time to tell you what The Hunger Games is about, l will address some of the relatively common, silly complaints that The Hunger Games is getting....Silly Complaint #1 - ""Waaaah: The movie is not as good as the book."" Really? The movie was excellent! If every detail and characterization from the book was transferred to the screen we'd have ended up with a 10 hour movie instead of just over a 2 hour movie. Sometimes liberties need to be taken for a film adaptation in order to keep the action moving, and the action indeed moves at a quick pace in the movie. And, look, Suzanne Collins co-wrote the script, so I'd say the integrity of the novel holds quite strong in the film.Silly Complaint #2 - ""Boo hoo: The Hunger Games is a rip off ofBattle Royale."" I had heard that there was some controversy that Battle Royale was an uncredited inspiration for The Hunger Games, so I grabbed the opportunity to check out Battle Royale and....It turns out that while the concept that pulled me into the Battle Royale hype was cool, ultimately the movie was as hokey as I've seen in quite a while. The script that the concept bloomed is terribly formulated. The story flow is discombobulated. And the acting is...well?....It seems like the concept of selecting a random middle school class to participate in a free-for-all deathmatch was the same concept used to select who the actors would be in the movie; in a word, the acting in Battle Royale was atrocious. The Hunger Games is the opposite of Battle Royale in these respects: The Hunger Games is well put together, well acted & well directed. The Hunger Games is exciting, action packed and I thoroughly enjoyed all 2 hours and 20 minutes from start to finish.Complaint #3 (notice that I didn't say ""silly"" complaint this time?) - No one seems to be happy with the relatively new Ultraviolet digital media format that much of Hollywood has adapted to, and I'd have to agree that when I purchase a digital copy I don't want to have to stream it from the Cloud. A lot of the negative 1 & 2 star reviews here at Amazon for this movie are an outcry against said format. As a result, the average number of stars that this movie is getting is unjustly lower based on the outcry to this format that Hollywood has taken to versus the quality of the movie. So don't be mislead by almost 100 (as of this writing) 1 & 2 star reviews that have more to do with digital format than they do movie content.Do check this movie out if you're into the action/thriller genres.

1341970,A3RF46CL8GDIN8,B003EYVXV4,SouthGenie,"[3, 5]","Naturally, the movie isn't as good as the book, that's usually the case and we all know that going in; it's unrealistic to expect the movie to be just as good as the book. However, I suppose I had higher expectations for this movie going in because of Peter Jackson's work on the LOTR trilogy. My thought was that since Peter Jackson could condense such a complex world into such good movies, couldn't an experienced screenwriter/author such as Suzanne Collins, author of the books themselves, which are nowhere near as complex as the world or story in LOTR, could do the same? Not quite, apparently.Clearly, an effort was made to bridge the gap between book and movie. I would have given the theatrical movie 3.5 stars; it was worth seeing because the actors gave wonderful performances and it had a visual impact that the book didn't, as well as scenes that were not in the book that enhanced the story. It doesn't stand on its own though, it's more of a companion to the novel, like illustrated pictures that move and speak. However, they cut scenes from the DVD that were in the movie, some that had been in the book and some that were not, but all things that made the movie worth seeing. Everything certainly would have fit on the disc, so I just cannot make sense of why they were cut from the DVD.Initially, the thing that annoyed me about the movie was the loss of the true story of the Mockingjay pin. However, there are some things in the movie that were either not in or you couldn't get from the book. The real reason to watch the movie is to get a visual representation of the book's scenes. Not because children killing children is at all glamorous or fun, it's not. It's because while it's horrific enough to read about, the full horror comes home to you when you see it played out on screen. It's a little like the difference between hearing about the Titanic sinking and watching the movie ""Titanic,"" but more like the difference between hearing about the Holocaust and watching ""Schindler's List,"" or hearing about slavery and watching ""Roots.""But I have to go back to the pin. So much is made of the pin in the book that I can't understand why they changed its story in the movie. I certainly don't understand how they could refer to it as if it were something of a ""good luck charm"" after the way it was used in the movie. Katniss finds it randomly in the Hob and gives it to her sister Prim for ""protection"" right before Prim's first Reaping. Immediately thereafter, Prim, whose name is only entered once in the Reaping, is chosen as tribute from among hundreds of names. Prim then gives the pin back to Katniss for ""protection"" in the games. Really? After the poor protection the pin gave Prim that's more like a sinister Greek tragedy than sisterly love. After Prim was chosen, they should have thrown the thing into the fire at Mount Doom. That plot change was ridiculous.Because it was completely changed and diminished in the movie, the real story of the pin isn't even a SPOILER- unless you haven't read and still plan to read the books. This is the actual story of the pin. If your first instinct is to roll your eyes, let me ask you this: can you imagine the Lord of the Rings with the story of the One Ring changed and Gollum cut out? Again, this next part is only a SPOILER if you haven't read the book; because it's not in either of the first 2 movies released so far (Hunger Games or Catching Fire) at all.The mockingjay pin was actually a fine gold piece of jewelry that belonged to a classmate acquaintance of Katniss' named Madge. Madge wore it the day of the Reaping and wasn't chosen as tribute, then rather urgently gave it to Katniss during Katniss' allotted goodbye visits before leaving for the games. Before Madge, it belonged to Madge's aunt Maysilee. Maysilee was a young woman chosen as tribute for the Hunger Games in a Reaping the same year as Haymitch was, 24 years earlier in the 2nd Quarter Quell. That year, twice the number of tributes were sent into the arena. Madge's mother and her aunt Maysilee were twin sisters and both were good friends with Katniss' mother in school as well. Maysilee turned out to be handy with a blowpipe and poison darts she found in her backpack in the arena; she actually saves Haymitch's life at one point in the games, after he stumbled into a pack of careers. They allied for a while after that, until she decided they should go their separate ways, not relishing the thought of having to kill each other if it came down to them as the last two. Shortly after they split up, she was attacked by some huge pelican like birds that fatally stabbed her neck, and while Haymitch was too far away to help, he still came back to hold her hand and comfort her while she was dying.Haymitch wins his games by outsmarting the game makers. He stays off by himself (when not allied with Maysilee) not provoking fights, not killing unless necessary to defend himself until he is one of the final two survivors. When it comes to their big showdown, he throws a hatchet into a force field and it flies back up and into his opponent, killing her. Therefore, the kill that won him the game was not caused by a direct act on his part, the game killed her for him. Because of that and because he did not gleefully participate in the games by hunting down and savagely killing his opponents he shows up the Capitol and is punished. His mother, brother and girlfriend are all killed off in separate ""accidents,"" and Haymitch comes to realize that anyone he cares about will be killed. So he retreats into life as a loner who cares about no one in order to keep more people from being killed, slowly sinking into alcoholism. Each year he's forced to watch as his district's tributes are targeted and killed off. Then Katniss comes along wearing a pin that belonged to Maysilee, with not only the skills to win the game but the spunk to show up the Capitol at the same time. The pin is a thread from the past, a Mockingjay echo from a fallen tribute reaching into the present, sparking hope for the districts rebellion against the Capitol's cruelty. That is why the pin was so important, why it's really the soul of the story.With so much already lost in going from book to movie, I just cannot understand why they would cut parts of the actual theatrical movie out of the DVD when it would easily have fit. I would give this DVD release negative stars if I could. One star is four too many. It's not worth buying unless the chintzy studio idiots re-release it in an extended version that includes the entire theatrical movie on it.",1,One star is 4 too many because they cut the theatrical

Meant to be a punishment to a number of districts that tried to rise up against the government, the games have become great entertainment to the people of the time. Each year a boy and a girl from each district who are from 12 to 17 years old are chosen to fight to the death until only one is left alive. When her 12 year old sister is chosen, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to save her sister.In a nutshell, this movie was: Survivor meets Running Man meets The Truman Show meets The Bachelor.I gave it 4 stars (and would have given 4 1/2 if Amazon allowed) because there was a bit too much predictability in the script. Otherwise it was a brilliant production.SciFi fans will love the amazing look and feel of this future world. It's a brutal world of people divided into the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" The ""have nots"" are penned in, suppressed and live in poverty while the ""haves"" live in luxury and are so hard hearted that they enjoy watching children kill each other for sport. It was believable.The sets were utterly amazing. The clothing, hair styles, make up, and culture of this future society were like nothing else I've seen elsewhere. There should be some awards there. The acting was also spot on.You're led through the process of the Hunger Games, with the movie focusing on Katniss Everdeen from start to finish. Like watching Survivor on TV, you quickly decide who you can cheer for, and who you hope to see fail. It's easy to care about Katniss, since she's a kind hearted girl who's instincts are to protect the vulnerable. There were also villain type characters that were easy to hate.There was a bit of romance in the movie, but it wasn't the focus of the film.This movie is NOT for kids, or even young teens in my opinion. Children are killed, and there is blood in this movie. The violence sequences are made a bit less gory by the use of ""cinema verte"" or ""shakey cam"" with fast moving cuts. Regardless, this is not appropriate for kids or the sensitive.So to conclude, I'd certainly recommend this movie to SciFi fans and action/adventure fans.",4,4 1/2 stars - Fantastic in many ways,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,2141,"['future', 'time', 'year', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'run', 'government', 'Meant', 'be', 'punishment', 'number', 'districts', 'tried', 'rise', 'up', 'government', 'games', 'have', 'become', 'great', 'entertainment', 'people', 'time', 'year', 'boy', 'girl', 'district', 'who', 'are', '12', '17', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'chosen', 'fight', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'alive', 'When', '12', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'chosen', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'volunteers', 'save', 'sister.In', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'was', 'Survivor', 'Running', 'Man', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Bachelor.I', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', '1/2', 'Amazon', 'allowed', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'predictability', 'script', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'brilliant', 'production.SciFi', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'amazing', 'look', 'feel', 'future', 'world', 'brutal', 'world', 'people', 'divided', 'haves', 'have', 'nots', 'have', 'nots', 'are', 'penned', 'suppressed', 'live', 'poverty', 'haves', 'live', 'luxury', 'are', 'so', 'hard', 'hearted', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'children', 'kill', 'other', 'sport', 'was', 'believable.The', 'sets', 'were', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'clothing', 'hair', 'styles', 'make', 'up', 'culture', 'future', 'society', 'were', 'nothing', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'should', 'be', 'awards', 'there', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'spot', 'on.You', ""'re"", 'led', 'process', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'movie', 'focusing', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'start', 'finish', 'watching', 'Survivor', 'TV', 'quickly', 'decide', 'who', 'can', 'cheer', 'who', 'hope', 'see', 'fail', 'easy', 'care', 'Katniss', 'kind', 'hearted', 'girl', 'who', 'instincts', 'are', 'protect', 'vulnerable', 'were', 'also', 'villain', 'type', 'characters', 'were', 'easy', 'hate.There', 'was', 'bit', 'romance', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'focus', 'film.This', 'movie', 'NOT', 'kids', 'even', 'young', 'teens', 'opinion', 'Children', 'are', 'killed', 'blood', 'movie', 'violence', 'sequences', 'are', 'made', 'bit', 'less', 'gory', 'use', 'cinema', 'verte', 'shakey', 'cam', 'fast', 'moving', 'cuts', 'Regardless', 'not', 'appropriate', 'kids', 'sensitive.So', 'conclude', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'SciFi', 'fans', 'action/adventure', 'fans']",N/A

I went to see the moviebecause a lot of people seemed to think it would be well made.And it is well made, in several ways. CGI and gore are notallowed to detract from the story. Nonetheless this is notwhat I would call a movie for little kids, no way. It's grim,heart-wrenching at times. This isn't a happy, feel-good movieat all, that isn't what its about. For me, it isn't a ""heroine""movie. But it is the kind of movie where I want to see the nextmovie. Very much so.I spent a fair amount of time thinking about it after I saw it.Having not read the book, I was free to think about how theirsociety could become as it is. The story became believable to me,in the sense I could extrapolate from our society today, to thefuture the movie presents.Because the characters live in a much different world than we do,a world different than other fictional worlds, I didn't immediatelyappreciate them, nor the acting. But the characters, and the acting,became multi-dimensional after I had some time to integrate things.The characters all belong in their world, they have a very personalstake in it, and they are all trying to preserve the values it holdsfor them personally, whether they are ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"",innocent or worldly. They all have hopes, and they all have fears.No one is truly secure, and the ending, although quiet, is very stark.Yet very human also.The movie has a mix of young actors, and middle aged actors, andthat mix works superbly, yet subtly, when they have 1-on-1 scenestogether. They bring out the best in each other. First impressionsfall by the wayside, because these characters are all much more thanthey seem. They live in a complex world, dangerous for the powerfuland powerless alike, and they are all desperately trying to wend theirway thru it alive. Several of them are keenly focused on the humanityof the people around them, trying to keep that in the forefront, orat least bring it into view for a few moments in the brief time theyhave left.I debated giving this 4 stars or 5. I'm often tempted to try makingcomparisons with other movies, but for Hunger Games, I choose notto do that. I decided on 5 stars, because this movie makes the mostof what it has. A thought-provoking story, sufficient budget, a lotof very talented people, and a long enough run-time, 2:20, to presentitself as it truly is.

1342007,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B003EYVXV4,Steve Douglas,"[1, 2]","There have been more than enough summaries of the movie, comparisons to the book and various opinions offered about the plot, characters, acting etc, etc so this review will focus solely upon the quality of the Blu Ray itself and my rating is based on that.  For that matter, all my reviews are always based upon the quality of the transfer of a film to Blu Ray.  So lets begin.VIDEO&#8230;The video transfer is excellent in every way with great saturation of colors during the color grading post production without having colors over saturated.  There is a warmness to the grading without it being artificial in any way that I can see.  Colors do not pop in an unnatural manner.  The Mbps rate is one of the highest I have seen averaging in the low 40's which means they have packed a lot of data on this blu ray which results in greater resolution and sharper contrast.  At no point did I notice any distracting grain or artifacting during the film. While the movie certainly  has many green and blue screen effects and CGI manifestations, I noticed no haloing as a result no stair-steppiing in the long wide angle shots of the audience. While the 'monster dogs' do take on a CGI appearance to me, they are what they are, a computer generated prop the rulers use to bring the 'contest' to closure. Blacks are deep without sacrificing details which can be seen even in the tiniest of articles.  For example, when Rue dies and is laid on a bed of tiny flowers, each flower can easily be discerned without being a mush of white pedals.  An excellent video transfer in all ways.AUDIO&#8230;.For me, the audio production is the star of the disc.  DTS MA HD, a lossless audio codec, is offered in both a 5.1 and 7.1 configuration.  Having a fairly esoteric home theater system, I set it to produce a 7.1 audio stage and the audio editing, which often gets the short straw in films due to either budget or just poor audio editing, is absolutely outstanding and completely demo worthy for those who want to show off their systems capabilities.  There is an undeniable immersion of natural audio that surrounds you with completely discreet sounds from all 7 channels that brings you totally into the movies' environment.  This is especially so when the film movies into the games in the forest scenes.  Discreet directionality of the audio is fantastically all around you throughout the majority of the film.  The LFE sub channel is given plenty to do in added bottom end ambience and a couple of natural sounding explosions.  Dialogue is clear and transparent and audio leveling done right so you don't have to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control.  I realize that most home theater owners use a 5.1 system and I have played that as well.  You won't be disappointed by the audio at any time.  I do wish that all Blu Rays, especially of this type of film, where action is a main component of the movie, would offer an audio 7.1 option.EXTRAS&#8230;.There are a great many extras and I can't say I have watched them all yet, however, I did watch the featurette on the making of the special effects and one on the post production of the film and was very impressed with them both for being informative without self congradulating pats on the back.  Another excellent feature was the 'DTS Sound Check' which creates audio taken from the film and sends it discreetly to each of your channels so that you know that  your audio system is set up and balanced correctly.  You can choose between a 5.1 and a 7.1 system for this feature and it can save you some time and puzzlement if your system is incorrectly wired or if the little ones in the house pulled a wire off without your knowledge or accidentally pressed the wrong button on your processor remote.  There are several other extras as well that I look forward to watching.The one big negative on the disc is that there are 5 or 6 previews and ads for other movies and ultraviolet.  The consumer does not want to pay for advertising which simply takes up disc space demanding even more compression of the film. I really hate previews on DVDS or Blu Rays.Also included is a digital disc which you can use to either download to iTunes or Ultraviolet.  I personally do not care for Ultra Violet and like to have the digital disc on hand.All in all, while this may or may not be your favorite film, the actual transfer of it to Blu Ray is excellent in every way.  I do  hope this review has been of some help to your in deciding your purchase.  All my reviews focus on the disc's quality and maybe they will be of help to you as well.Thanks for reading.",5,The Hunger Games on Blu Ray Triumphs in Transfer to BR.,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,4609,"['have', 'been', 'more', 'enough', 'summaries', 'movie', 'comparisons', 'book', 'various', 'opinions', 'offered', 'plot', 'characters', 'acting', 'etc', 'etc', 'so', 'review', 'will', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'rating', 'based', 'matter', 'reviews', 'are', 'always', 'based', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'So', 'begin.VIDEO', '8230', 'video', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'way', 'great', 'saturation', 'colors', 'color', 'grading', 'post', 'production', 'having', 'colors', 'saturated', 'warmness', 'grading', 'being', 'artificial', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'Colors', 'do', 'not', 'pop', 'unnatural', 'manner', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'one', 'highest', 'have', 'seen', 'averaging', 'low', '40', 'have', 'packed', 'lot', 'data', 'blu', 'ray', 'results', 'greater', 'resolution', 'sharper', 'contrast', 'point', 'did', 'notice', 'distracting', 'grain', 'artifacting', 'film', 'movie', 'certainly', 'many', 'green', 'blue', 'screen', 'effects', 'CGI', 'manifestations', 'noticed', 'haloing', 'result', 'stair-steppiing', 'long', 'wide', 'angle', 'shots', 'audience', ""'monster"", 'dogs', 'do', 'take', 'CGI', 'appearance', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'computer', 'generated', 'rulers', 'use', 'bring', ""'contest"", 'closure', 'Blacks', 'are', 'deep', 'sacrificing', 'details', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'even', 'tiniest', 'articles', 'example', 'when', 'Rue', 'dies', 'laid', 'bed', 'tiny', 'flowers', 'flower', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'discerned', 'being', 'mush', 'white', 'pedals', 'excellent', 'video', 'transfer', 'ways.AUDIO', '8230', 'audio', 'production', 'star', 'disc', 'DTS', 'MA', 'HD', 'lossless', 'audio', 'codec', 'offered', '5.1', '7.1', 'configuration', 'Having', 'fairly', 'esoteric', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'set', 'produce', '7.1', 'audio', 'stage', 'audio', 'editing', 'often', 'short', 'straw', 'films', 'due', 'budget', 'just', 'poor', 'audio', 'editing', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'completely', 'demo', 'worthy', 'who', 'want', 'show', 'off', 'systems', 'capabilities', 'undeniable', 'immersion', 'natural', 'audio', 'completely', 'discreet', 'sounds', '7', 'channels', 'totally', 'movies', 'environment', 'especially', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'movies', 'games', 'forest', 'scenes', 'Discreet', 'directionality', 'audio', 'fantastically', 'majority', 'film', 'LFE', 'sub', 'channel', 'given', 'plenty', 'do', 'added', 'bottom', 'end', 'ambience', 'couple', 'natural', 'sounding', 'explosions', 'Dialogue', 'clear', 'transparent', 'audio', 'leveling', 'done', 'right', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'play', 'roller', 'coaster', 'remote', 'volume', 'control', 'realize', 'most', 'home', 'theater', 'owners', 'use', '5.1', 'system', 'have', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'audio', 'time', 'do', 'wish', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'especially', 'type', 'film', 'where', 'action', 'main', 'component', 'movie', 'would', 'offer', 'audio', '7.1', 'option.EXTRAS', '8230', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'watched', 'yet', 'however', 'did', 'watch', 'featurette', 'making', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'post', 'production', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'being', 'informative', 'congradulating', 'pats', 'back', 'excellent', 'feature', 'was', ""'DTS"", 'Sound', 'Check', 'audio', 'taken', 'film', 'discreetly', 'channels', 'know', 'audio', 'system', 'set', 'up', 'balanced', 'correctly', 'can', 'choose', '5.1', '7.1', 'system', 'feature', 'can', 'save', 'time', 'puzzlement', 'system', 'incorrectly', 'wired', 'little', 'ones', 'house', 'pulled', 'wire', 'knowledge', 'accidentally', 'pressed', 'wrong', 'button', 'processor', 'remote', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'extras', 'well', 'look', 'forward', 'watching.The', 'one', 'big', 'negative', 'disc', 'are', '5', '6', 'previews', 'ads', 'other', 'movies', 'ultraviolet', 'consumer', 'not', 'want', 'pay', 'advertising', 'simply', 'up', 'disc', 'space', 'demanding', 'even', 'more', 'compression', 'film', 'really', 'hate', 'previews', 'DVDS', 'Blu', 'Rays.Also', 'included', 'digital', 'disc', 'can', 'use', 'download', 'iTunes', 'Ultraviolet', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Ultra', 'Violet', 'have', 'digital', 'disc', 'hand.All', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'favorite', 'film', 'actual', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'excellent', 'way', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'reviews', 'focus', 'disc', 'quality', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'help', 'well.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

1342012,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B003EYVXV4,Steven Aldersley,"[67, 98]","The Top 5 films at the box office (worldwide) this year are: The Avengers ($1.5 billion), The Dark Knight Rises ($1 billion), Ice Age: Continental Drift ($836 million), The Amazing Spider-Man ($744 million) and The Hunger Games ($645 million). In the US, The Hunger Games ranks third behind The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. It's clear that comic book heroes sell, and other key elements are action and conflict. The Hunger Games aims to give us a new fantasy hero to follow after the conclusion of the Harry Potter franchise.Does it succeed?The movie is an adaptation of the first part of a trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins, which was initially aimed at young adults. But, like the Harry Potter series, the trilogy appeals to readers of all ages. I can't comment on the quality of the books because I haven't read them, so I don't know how faithful the movie adaptation is. All I can judge is how well the story works on the big screen. The second movie in the series is set for a 2013 release, while the final part of the trilogy will be split into two movies. So, to answer my question, The Hunger Games is a resounding success as a financial venture and it's enormously popular.Financial success is one thing, but is the movie worth your time? I guess that depends on what you find entertaining. Let me describe what you can expect.***Spoilers ahead***The story opens with a glimpse into the life of Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence). We learn that she lives in one of the poorest of twelve districts in Panem, and that food is scarce. She feeds her mother and sister by hunting for game in the woods and she's a gifted archer. The twelve districts hold a lottery each year to select a boy and girl to represent them. The 24 children will fight to the death and only a single victor will survive. When Katniss sees her young sister chosen, she volunteers to take her place. The chosen boy from District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson).That's all we are told about life in District 12. This is not a drama in which we learn about the struggle to live under such a regime, it's more of an action movie. The story moves on quickly and we are shown the sharp contrast between District 12 and the Capitol, where the population is wealthy and the games are seen as nothing more than a form of entertainment. Katniss and Peeta are interviewed on television by host Caesar Flickerman (Tucci). The Capitol is presented as weird and decadent, and most people look like extras from Amadeus. One character looks to be based on Rita Skeeter from Harry Potter. I had the impression that these people were weird for the sake of being weird and it didn't feel convincing.The movie plays out like an American version of Battle Royale with elements from The Running Man added for good measure. Those in control of the game can intervene at will using computers. Sometimes they will send medicine, while at other times they will harm or kill some of the contestants. It's all a grotesque manipulation aimed at entertaining the population in the Capitol.Director Gary Ross is a gifted storyteller, and he also has writing credits for Big, Pleasantville, and Seabiscuit. Unlike all three of those movies, I found that The Hunger Games lacked depth. It's obvious why I am supposed to root for Katniss as she risks her own life to save her sister, but there aren't enough background details to make me connect with her strongly. It felt more like a cynical plot device than anything that was remotely real.So, for me, The Hunger Games became something of a comic book. There is an attempt at showing group dynamics. Who will work together? At what point will they try to kill each other? Who will take their chances alone? What skills will each of the characters have? How inventive will the deaths be? But the attempt is flawed because some of the most dangerous contestants are displayed as sneering idiots, and it detracts from the seriousness of the situation. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, not a comedy?I'm trying to give a balanced review, but some of the battles are rather silly. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have a few good moments. One alliance in particular did resonate with me and I reacted emotionally to the death of one character.My overall impression is one of sadness. Not because of the death of some of the characters, but at what we are becoming as a society. Do we really need to see children fight to the death in order to be entertained? As with modern comedies, we are relying more on shock value than good writing. Katniss Everdeen was portrayed well by a promising actress, but original ideas were few and far between. You know almost exactly what to expect from The Hunger Games before it begins, and most events are thoroughly predictable.The next three movies will be a huge success, I am sure, but I'm not anxiously awaiting their release. I'm glad that I avoided The Hunger Games in theaters and waited to borrow the Blu-ray from a friend. Don't label me as a prude or someone who is against violence in movies. One of my favorites is Kill Bill, but, unlike the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen, I was shown enough background to care about what happened to The Bride.This movie does have a huge audience as I outlined at the beginning. If you are the kind of moviegoer who enjoys action, good presentation, and special effects, The Hunger Games will entertain you. You'll need to switch your brain off for a couple of hours, but movies like this do have their place. I guess that's why they get made. I am left wondering about the book and how much was left out. Don't let this review stop you from buying the Blu-ray (which looks and sounds fantastic) or checking out the movie for yourself. I'm clearly in the minority on this one.(9/29/13 Edit to add: After seeing this movie for the second time, I eventually ended up buying it. It seems that I was in the wrong mood the first time I saw it. Jennifer Lawrence is very good in the role and I am planning to see the sequels and maybe even read the books. I upgraded my rating to 3.75/5).",3,"Good acting and action, but light on story",1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,6081,"['Top', '5', 'films', 'box', 'office', 'worldwide', 'year', 'are', 'Avengers',

1342016,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B003EYVXV4,Steven Johnson,"[7, 10]","I can't even begin to say what a great surprise The Hunger Games was. Having recently finished the novel, I had concerns over how the film would adapt the first-person narrative, filled with introspection by the protagonist Katniss Everdeen and flashbacks to earlier in her life. What's great about the movie: they didn't try to do that.Instead, we have a remarkably directed, almost dreamlike flow through the story. The film travels briskly from scene to scene, organically blending in backstory that is easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. Rather than filling in the exposition through explanation, as the novel does, we are given the dystopic scenario and the formation of the Hunger Games through news broadcasts of the current year's Games. None of this feels forced or even too heavily reinforced.The Hunger Games is the rare film for children / young adults that trusts that the audience is an intelligent and mature one. It counts on the audience to pay attention, as names and details fly by in quick succession. There is very little sweet or sugarcoated about this world, and the movie doesn't bother to dwell on that. The color palette is filled with bleak greys and blacks, with some very intense sequences of violence (which honestly made me wonder how on earth this movie scraped past an R rating and instead earned a PG-13).In addition to its disturbing content, this film is also noteworthy for its strong performances. Jennifer Lawrence (as always!) is fantastic as the lead character, and pairs well with her semi-love interest Josh Hutcherson, who also gives a well-restrained and believable performance.Following in the tradition of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Hunger Games is so effective because it feels as authentic as it possibly could. Given the fantastical elements that are embedded in the story, everything else, from the characters' dialogue, the scenery, and even the wobbly first-person camera work, ring true.The Hunger Games is an excellent start to what I hope will be a solid film series. It is such an unusual concept for a major studio to pursue, and I welcome its confidence to present a film experience that is disturbing, harsh, and most importantly, believable.",5,Excellent and disturbing young adult thriller,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,2225,"['ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'say', 'what', 'great', 'surprise', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'was', 'Having', 'recently', 'finished', 'novel', 'had', 'concerns', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'adapt', 'first-person', 'narrative', 'filled', 'introspection', 'protagonist', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'flashbacks', 'earlier', 'life', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'that.Instead', 'have', 'remarkably', 'directed', 'almost', 'dreamlike', 'flow', 'story', 'film', 'travels', 'briskly', 'scene', 'scene', 'organically', 'blending', 'backstory', 'easy', 'miss', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'Rather', 'filling', 'exposition', 'explanation', 'novel', 'are', 'given', 'dystopic', 'scenario', 'formation', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'current', 'year', 'Games', 'None', 'feels', 'forced', 'even', 'too', 'heavily', 'reinforced.The', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'rare', 'film', 'children', '/', 'young', 'adults', 'audience', 'intelligent', 'mature', 'one', 'audience', 'pay', 'attention', 'names', 'details', 'fly', 'quick', 'succession', 'very', 'little', 'sweet', 'sugarcoated', 'world', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bother', 'dwell', 'color', 'palette', 'filled', 'bleak', 'greys', 'blacks', 'very', 'intense', 'sequences', 'violence', 'honestly', 'made', 'wonder', 'how', 'earth', 'movie', 'scraped', 'R', 'rating', 'instead', 'earned', 'PG-13', 'addition', 'disturbing', 'content', 'film', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'strong', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'always', 'fantastic', 'lead', 'character', 'pairs', 'well', 'semi-love', 'interest', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'who', 'also', 'well-restrained', 'believable', 'performance.Following', 'tradition', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'so', 'effective', 'as', 'authentic', 'possibly', 'could', 'Given', 'fantastical', 'elements', 'are', 'embedded', 'story', 'everything', 'else', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'scenery', 'even', 'wobbly', 'first-person', 'camera', 'work', 'ring', 'true.The', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'excellent', 'start', 'what', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'solid', 'film', 'series', 'such', 'unusual', 'concept', 'major', 'studio', 'pursue', 'welcome', 'confidence', 'present', 'film', 'experience', 'disturbing', 'harsh', 'most', 'importantly', 'believable']",N/A

1342021,A26MJME9IBNETY,B003EYVXV4,StrangePegs,"[1, 1]","Just to make it clear, I have not read The Hunger Games and I don't intend to. I have my reasons. I have my reasons which I spend a considerable amount of time explaining, as the question of why I'm not going to read The Hunger Games is now the most frequent question I'm asked by people that know me in person. Also, let's just say, the movie only affirmed those reasons, so I'm even less likely to read the book now than I was before I saw it. But I'm sort of jumping ahead...So here's the spoiler warning, because I'm not going to be very careful about what I say since I expect that most of you that actually care have already seen the movie anyway (and nothing I say is going to change your opinion, but, still, maybe I can make a person or two stop and think). If you haven't already seen it, you probably don't care enough for it to matter.We're supposed to believe that Katniss and the other members of District 12 are poor. But not just poor, dirt poor. As in they don't have enough to eat. They don't have good clothes to wear. That's what the film would like us to believe from the presentation. But it doesn't back it up. Everyone is too healthy, and they have nice, clean clothes (and, evidently, plenty of them). Not just Katniss. Everyone. Especially Katniss, though, with her round cheeks. No one here is deprived. They're also clean. All of them. Pristine clean. Even Peeta in the midst of throwing out scraps to the pigs in the mud during the rain is wearing pristine white clothes. Poor people don't live like this. My sense of reality is already at odds with the movie, and it's barely started.The next major disconnect is &#34;the reaping.&#34; It's a stupid name for what's going on as the whole thing is &#34;random.&#34; That's not what reaping is at all. But my big issue here is the way that everyone just stands by while it's going on. Even the parents. It's totally unbelievable. Throughout history, we have seen parents go to all sorts of lengths to protect their children. Even up to death. So I can't buy into the fact that the parents just stand by and allow their children to be taken. Without protest. Of any kind. I don't care what kind of social conditioning you try to say is going on, there is nothing that can override the biological need of a parent to protect his/her child. At least, in the short story &#34;The Lottery&#34;, the people don't know why the lottery is happening. It's origins have been lost, and they don't know what kind of badness will transpire if they fail to follow through every year. Superstition lends believability to the events. But they do know in Hunger Games, so that whole set up came off as contrived to me. And, of course, it is contrived, because that's what authors do, but it shouldn't feel contrived. That did. Even if Katniss' mother wasn't going to wail or protest, someone should have. Peeta's parents didn't. And there was no mention of it from any other district, either, so it just rang false.Since we're on the subject, were we also supposed to believe that that was the entire District 12 there in that courtyard? That was it? There's few enough of them to fit all the names in that one little fish bowl? A couple of hundred kids in the whole District? Give me a break. And if that was it, if that's what we're supposed to buy into, then I can't buy into districts that are that small supporting a city the size of the capitol. Especially at the level of technology they have. It's also way beyond plausibility that they support all of that off of coal mining. Seriously? That's what we're expected to believe?All of that to say that I was already busy shaking my head at the ridiculousness of the entire thing within 30 minutes. I don't know what the book is like, but the movie created a foundation built on sand. I think it was made out of sand, too. I mean, the whole set up is just so that they can make the point that it's all for the entertainment of the city folk. I get the point. I even appreciate the point. But you have to make it believable.Other things I couldn't buy:The flaming clothes of Katniss and Peeta: Not that I couldn't believe the possibility of it, but I couldn't accept that Cinna was the only one to think of something extravagant. Again, give me a break. Not a single one of the other publicity people were creative enough to think of something cool to bring attention to their people?Peeta: Shy boy from a backwater district suddenly becomes all cool and suave for television? No way... That coupled with his speech to Katniss about how he didn't want them to change him just about made me gag.The game itself. And this will be my last point, but it's a big one.The idea is that the 24 tributes will fight to the death for riches and glory, but only four of them, the representatives from Districts 1 and 2, are invested in that. The rest of them, mostly, just really want to live. Collins, in effect, put the characters into a situation where they have no motivation to make anything happen. After that first rush for supplies, it becomes enough that the tributes just figure out a way to live. Even Cato, in the end, just stakes his territory and sits around and waits. There is no motivation for anyone to do anything, and that's just bad writing. In order to move the story along, at this point, Collins (because she was involved in writing the script for the movie, too) has to introduce an external force to push the characters into what she wants to happen. Again, this whole sequence of events came off as very contrived. Because it was.The dogs were stupid. I mean, that whole bit with them coming out of the ground was just dumb. And, then, Katniss and Peeta running to where they knew Cato was? Also dumb. Katniss had already shown great skill at climbing trees, so the fact that they ran off through the forest to get to the clearing was just beyond reasonable. Except that that is where Collins wanted them to be.Also, the whole &#34;there can be two winners&#34; &#34;oh, no, we lied&#34; bit. Also dumb. And the wasps. Convenient. Especially since they managed to not sting anyone in the at least 12 hours the sitting right next to them.And, since I haven't read the books, and I don't really know what's going on with it, I won't say a thing about the &#34;love&#34; story. Maybe my initial thoughts about it will be proven incorrect, so I'll reserve judgment.Not to be completely negative, though, Woody Harrelson was great as Haymitch. I've seen a lot of criticism about that character from people that read the books, but I thought Harrelson was great. Actually, I think Harrelson is a generally underrated actor.The only person better? Stanley Tucci. He was amazing. Tucci is another actor that rarely gets the credit he deserves.I'd like to say I was impressed with Elizabeth Banks, but I think her makeup did most of her acting for her.And I'd really like to say that I was impressed with Lawrence, but, really, I don't think she stood out at all in the role. There was nothing that she did to make the role hers. Nothing that made it distinct. Nothing that would keep a dozen other actors from stepping in and doing the job just as well.

Having read the books I was a little concerned when the casting was announced, however, the movie is incredible and I was not disappointed.  Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as Katniss Everdeen.  Perfect.  The movie basically stays true to the trilogy in content and in spirit.  The scene when Katniss looks at the audience when she is being interviewed on TV is amazing.  You can tell that even though Katniss is young she has been through a lot and has some wisdom.  She has also been completely submerged in poverty and is numb from seeing the excesses of the Capitol.  I appreciated the way the director showed Katniss's vulnerability throughout the film.  She's a young girl, she's not a comic book superhero.  When she shoots arrows she sometimes misses.  She's human.  She's real.  I liked the way the movie didn't shy away from depicting the horror of the games when older, stronger children literally butcher younger frail children and hunt down others.  I didn't like the violence, but I liked that the director didn't try to candy coat the scenario.  The movie stayed true to the books in many areas including the Rue incident.  This incident in particular is important as seen when Thresh (the second tribute from District 11) refrains from harming Katniss.  All of District Eleven -- all the districts -- were watching when Katniss honored Rue.  Katniss honoring another district's tribute starts the wheels in motion that ultimately bring about war.  I plan on buying this film when it comes out on dvd.  And now I am anxiously awaiting the sequel which will cover book 2 and show Katniss's life when she is forced to embark on a tour of the districts like some pageant queen.  She will suffer the consequences of her rebellion and she will once again be sucked into The Hunger Games.  I highly, highly recommend this dvd and the book trilogy.  3/31/12",5,YEAH IT WAS T-H-A-T GOOD!!!,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,1918,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'forever', 'Having', 'read', 'books', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'when', 'casting', 'was', 'announced', 'however', 'movie', 'incredible', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'awesome', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'Perfect', 'movie', 'basically', 'true', 'trilogy', 'content', 'spirit', 'scene', 'when', 'Katniss', 'audience', 'when', 'being', 'interviewed', 'TV', 'amazing', 'can', 'tell', 'even', 'Katniss', 'young', 'been', 'lot', 'wisdom', 'also', 'been', 'completely', 'submerged', 'poverty', 'numb', 'seeing', 'excesses', 'Capitol', 'appreciated', 'way', 'director', 'showed', 'Katniss', 'vulnerability', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'When', 'shoots', 'arrows', 'sometimes', 'human', 'real', 'liked', 'way', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'depicting', 'horror', 'games', 'when', 'older', 'stronger', 'children', 'literally', 'butcher', 'younger', 'frail', 'children', 'hunt', 'down', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'violence', 'liked', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'candy', 'coat', 'scenario', 'movie', 'stayed', 'true', 'books', 'many', 'areas', 'including', 'Rue', 'incident', 'incident', 'particular', 'important', 'seen', 'when', 'Thresh', 'second', 'tribute', 'District', '11', 'refrains', 'harming', 'Katniss', 'District', 'Eleven', 'districts', 'were', 'watching', 'when', 'Katniss', 'honored', 'Rue', 'Katniss', 'honoring', 'district', 'tribute', 'wheels', 'motion', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'war', 'plan', 'buying', 'film', 'when', 'out', 'dvd', 'now', 'am', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'sequel', 'will', 'cover', 'book', '2', 'show', 'Katniss', 'life', 'when', 'forced', 'embark', 'tour', 'districts', 'pageant', 'queen', 'will', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'rebellion', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'sucked', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'book', 'trilogy', '3/31/12']",N/A

I wasn't sure who all the characters were from District 1, guess the director didn't think it necessary to give them names.

It was hilarious but I had to put it in there somewhere. The story is a compelling one about a grim futuristic society where the former United States has been demolished and broken into 12 districts and a capitol. Every year, a boy and girl from each district is brought to the Capitol for training and to be launched literally into the hunger games where kids kill other kids.The premise might come across as bizarre but the film does a faithful job in capturing Suzanne Collins's novel. Jennifer Lawrence deserves her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in her performance as Catniss Everdeen, a teenager who takes her younger sister's place in the games. The younger cast members who play the 24 all do a fantastic job in believable life and death performances.I bought this DVD 2 pack which includes several extra features like the background of the popularity regarding the trilogy, the making, the message from the Rose Garden, etc. which is worth having. Since the novel is taught in schools, the DVD will be helpful in the classroom as a teaching tool in bringing the story to life. It's a disturbing tale but is worth learning about war, famine, droughts, and society overall.I have to say that I was a bit disturbed by the outfits, costumes, make-up and hair of the Capitol denizens who seem bizarre and detached from the yearly grisly event.If I am disappointed, it's because we don't get to hear from the author, Suzanne Collins about her classic trilogy.

I haven't read the book so my impressions relate solely to the book, and I found it wanting. There seems to be a lot of going on, but the timing was weird. The first half hour was at District 12, yet not a lot of revealed about the people there, the main character, the politics, how they got in the situation they were in, or anything that really mattered except how Catniss and Peeta ended up in the games. In contrast, many things that were pretty important are glossed over in a minute or two. Many things are eluded to, but not explained fully. I suppose the book fleshes them out, but it left me scratching my head and wondering why I should care.The settings did a good job of contrasting the wealth and party atmosphere of the capital vs. the poor and miserable existence in the provinces, but it doesn't really say WHY it is this way. There is obviously some sort of cultural conflict and enforced submission, but WHY? How exactly? The few lines addressed to that doesn't help.I thought the comic book feel of the fashion was an odd choice. It was like a blend between the 1980s, King Louis XIV France, Batman, and ancient Rome. I was confused. The poverty was real enough so why go off in a fantasy direction with the wealth?As for the story, I guess there wasn't enough of it to make it great for me. I felt like I was given a skeleton. It was a fair skeleton, but not enough to make me want to watch more. It might have been more interesting if it had been more of a reflection of reality. The lottery scene in district 12 shows a wide range of people, but the ones who were selected all had some special talent. Where were the fat kids, the sickly kids, the ones with glasses?I'm not asking for someone to explain it to me. I don't really care. I am just letting you know that if you haven't read the book, you may be as bewildered as I was. I didn't hate it.

1342050,A2I2A7N3OCPNW4,B003EYVXV4,"T. A. Daniel ""Alex""","[0, 1]","(this review contains no spoilers)Gary Ross's adaptation of THE HUNGER GAMES is pretty faithful -- in fact, it's probably one of the most faithful book-to-movie adaptations I've ever seen. I remember reading the first book in the series and constantly thinking ""oh man, this would make a great movie."" And it's true: the movie version of THE HUNGER GAMES is good. However, most of the movie will seem very, very familiar to those that have already read the books. With original author Suzanne Collins cowriting the screenplay, many of the points in the movie are line-for-line translations to film.Here's some plot information for those that have not read the books: in the future, America has been segregated into 12 districts, and every year, two young adults are selected from each district (one male, one female). Those that are selected are entered into a competition called ""The Hunger Games;"" it's a competition where the winner is the last male or female left standing. In a dangerous environment with little food and plenty of weapons/traps, the main character, Katniss Everdeen, has to find a way to survive and make it back home.While I was skeptical of the cast, all of them turn in great performances. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic in Winter's Bone, not so great in X-Men: First Class, but she really inhabits the role of Katniss Everdeen well. Elizabeth Banks isn't even recognizable while playing Effie Trinket. Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman is an absolute blast. And on and on -- the cast is great.Gary Ross's direction is remarkably clear. I was pleasantly surprised by the dystopian aesthetic that the crew was able to achieve early in the movie. Once the characters find themselves in the Hunger Games, the setting is so wildly different -- and the same goes for the Capital. These settings never look cheap or uninspired: they are all different and relatively detailed. Some of the dialog doesn't quite translate well to the screen -- where characters spouting off exposition in the book feels natural, it comes off as a bit stilted here. The romance element doesn't really manifest itself all that well here either. One of the unfortunate things about this adaptation is how rigidly it adheres to its PG rating. The book is a bloody mess at times, and the movie is pretty sterile in comparison. While I understand that the studio essentially forced the movie to meet a PG-rating so that children would be able to to see it, the move really tones things down. A certain character's death isn't nearly as poignant because viewers aren't able to see everything that happens. Haymitch, a slobbering drunkard in the book, has a few drinks here, but isn't depicted nearly as disorderly as he does in the books.If you've read the books, your enjoyment of this movie will come from what you want from it: if you want a literal adaptation of the book, you are in for a treat because this movie never strays from the book. If, however, you would prefer the movie add something to the series that couldn't have been done in the books, you won't find much of it here. Overall, it's a pretty good movie, but the PG-rating removes some of the book's teeth.",4,Good Whether or Not You Read the Book(s),1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,3170,"['review', 'spoilers', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'fact', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'faithful', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'remember', 'reading', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'oh', 'man', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'true', 'movie', 'version', 'THE', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'good', 'However', 'most', 'movie', 'will', 'seem', 'very', 'very', 'familiar', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'books', 'original', 'author', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'cowriting', 'screenplay', 'many', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'line-for-line', 'translations', 'film.Here', 'plot', 'information', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'future', 'America', 'been', 'segregated', '12', 'districts', 'year', 'two', 'young', 'adults', 'are', 'selected', 'district', 'one', 'male', 'one', 'female', 'are', 'selected', 'are', 'entered', 'competition', 'called', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'competition', 'where', 'winner', 'last', 'male', 'female', 'left', 'standing', 'dangerous', 'environment', 'little', 'food', 'plenty', 'weapons/traps', 'main', 'character', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'find', 'way', 'survive', 'make', 'back', 'home.While', 'was', 'skeptical', 'cast', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'really', 'role', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'well', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognizable', 'playing', 'Effie', 'Trinket', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Caesar', 'Flickerman', 'absolute', 'blast', 'cast', 'great.Gary', 'Ross', 'direction', 'remarkably', 'clear', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'dystopian', 'aesthetic', 'crew', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'early', 'movie', 'characters', 'find', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'setting', 'so', 'wildly', 'different', 'same', 'Capital', 'settings', 'never', 'look', 'cheap', 'uninspired', 'are', 'different', 'relatively', 'detailed', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'quite', 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'where', 'characters', 'spouting', 'off', 'exposition', 'book', 'natural', 'off', 'bit', 'stilted', 'here', 'romance', 'element', ""n't"", 'really', 'manifest', 'that', 'well', 'here', 'either', 'One', 'unfortunate', 'things', 'adaptation', 'how', 'rigidly', 'PG', 'rating', 'book', 'bloody', 'mess', 'times', 'movie', 'pretty', 'sterile', 'comparison', 'understand', 'studio', 'essentially', 'forced', 'movie', 'meet', 'PG-rating', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'move', 'really', 'tones', 'things', 'down', 'certain', 'character', 'death', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'poignant', 'viewers', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'see', 'everything', 'Haymitch', 'slobbering', 'drunkard', 'book', 'few', 'drinks', 'here', ""n't"", 'depicted', 'nearly', 'as', 'disorderly', 'books.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'what', 'want', 'want', 'literal', 'adaptation', 'book', 'are', 'treat', 'movie', 'never', 'book', 'however', 'would', 'prefer', 'movie', 'add', 'something', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'books', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'here', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'PG-rating', 'book', 'teeth']",N/A

Katniss has developed prodigious hunting skills while faring for her family.This character is not far from her role as Ree in Winter's Bone,both characters dragged into adulthood prematurely, having developed survivalist instincts to cope.Lawrence conveys strength,moral intensity and yet compassion.A face that launches a 1000 films or Joan of Arc?Katniss is plucked from Appalachian poverty and made over as a TV star.The film recalls Battle Royale,Rollerball and Running Man,though Ross takes the central conceit and plays it straight.Like a bird's wings the main elements open up and fly.It suggests only the lotteried contestants can briefly savour the delights of the elite before most of them die,while they are prepared in-house for the savagery that awaits them. Katniss realises she must play a game of charm to win sponsors as well as survive the battle for the fittest,even play a love game with Petaa,which becomes real.Her mentor is Haymich(Harrelson) an ex-winner alcoholic who also mentors Petaa,from District 12.Tucci is a foppish grotesque,the pre-bloodbath interviewer.The 1st part of the film(1 hour) builds the contestants up,coaches and primes them giving us bits of back-story for the 2nd part which is the fight to the death in the televised arena.The film is impressively cast with many cameo parts for successful mature actors like Harrelson, Tucci(blue bouffant hairdo),Sutherland and Banks,who all play their parts with professional seriousness. But the spotlight is on the younger actors,who have acted in only one or two films up to now.The cinematography captures the agitated nature of the bloodsport in the sylvan forest with hand-held cameras,the blood is downplayed to 12 A, to reach a mass audience,so the gore is often soft-pedalled,off camera or hazy.This is a blockbuster and it works.",5,Prepare for the battle of the ratings: it works!,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2522,"['Marrying', 'worst', '30s', 'depression', 'la', 'shacks', 'backwoods', 'poverty', 'post-apocalyptic', 'reality', 'TV', 'major', 'premise', 'film.Set', 'dystopian', 'post-America', 'known', 'Panem', 'where', 'elite', 'preside', 'starving', 'working', 'class', 'annually', 'forces', '12', 'districts', 'send', 'teenage', 'boy', 'girl', 'compete', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'brutalised', 'televised', 'tournament', 'where', 'battle', 'death', 'enjoyment', 'oppressors.This', 'franchise', 'based', '3', 'Collins', 'novels', 'destined', 'fill', 'gap', 'left', 'Twilight', 'series.The', 'reason', 'will', 'do', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence.Lawrence', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'volunteers', 'tribute', 'spare', 'younger', 'sister', 'Prim', 'Katniss', 'developed', 'prodigious', 'hunting', 'skills', 'faring', 'family.This', 'character', 'not', 'far', 'role', 'Ree', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'characters', 'dragged', 'adulthood', 'prematurely', 'having', 'developed', 'survivalist', 'instincts', 'cope.Lawrence', 'conveys', 'strength', 'moral', 'intensity', 'yet', 'compassion.A', 'face', '1000', 'films', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Katniss', 'plucked', 'Appalachian', 'poverty', 'made', 'over', 'TV', 'star.The', 'film', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'Rollerball', 'Running', 'Man', 'Ross', 'central', 'conceit', 'bird', 'wings', 'main', 'elements', 'open', 'up', 'fly.It', 'only', 'lotteried', 'contestants', 'can', 'briefly', 'savour', 'delights', 'elite', 'most', 'die', 'are', 'prepared', 'in-house', 'savagery', 'Katniss', 'must', 'play', 'game', 'charm', 'win', 'sponsors', 'as', 'well', 'survive', 'battle', 'fittest', 'even', 'play', 'love', 'game', 'Petaa', 'real.Her', 'mentor', 'Haymich', 'Harrelson', 'ex-winner', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'also', 'mentors', 'Petaa', 'District', '12.Tucci', 'foppish', 'grotesque', 'pre-bloodbath', 'interviewer.The', '1st', 'part', 'film', '1', 'hour', 'contestants', 'up', 'coaches', 'giving', 'bits', 'back-story', '2nd', 'part', 'fight', 'death', 'televised', 'arena.The', 'film', 'impressively', 'cast', 'many', 'cameo', 'parts', 'successful', 'mature', 'actors', 'Harrelson', 'Tucci', 'blue', 'bouffant', 'hairdo', 'Sutherland', 'Banks', 'who', 'play', 'parts', 'professional', 'seriousness', 'spotlight', 'younger', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'acted', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'now.The', 'cinematography', 'agitated', 'nature', 'bloodsport', 'sylvan', 'forest', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'blood', 'downplayed', '12', 'A', 'reach', 'mass', 'audience', 'gore', 'often', 'soft-pedalled', 'off', 'camera', 'hazy.This', 'blockbuster']",N/A

I know it sounds nuts, but I am very glad I went to see the movie, wouldn't have missed it.  Yet at the same time I was so disappointed in it.  I felt cheated.  I think the director and producers knew they were going to have this huge hit and make mega millions and yet chose to make the movie as cheaply as possible.  It seemed like a corporate decision to squeeze the last few cents of profit out of the franchise at the expense of the product.I didn't like the shaky camera.  I didn't like the grainy film.  I didn't like the almost constant close ups, as if this film/world had no scope or sweep.  I hated the costumes which were so impressive in the book and so wrong in the movie.  What was up with that bad prom dress in Katniss's  last interview before returning to district 12.  The dress was supposed to make her look like an innocent young girl.  Instead she looked like an oompa loompa, with bad posture in a ballet tutu.  I hated the color balance of the picture.  It looked like a comic book with limited choice of colors. All these choices seemed to be wrong and not justified by idea of the book which was that the hunger games were these billion dollar spectaculars.  No expense was spared and the Capital had the capability of making almost anything happen.  At the same time Cinna, Katniss's stylist was a genius, but the costumes and hair styles he supposedly created and/or approved were so lame. He was, with the help of a crew, supposed to be able to manipulate and inspire a whole nation.  Yet the way Katniss was dressed and coiffed during the movie (and shot, BTW) did nothing to make her attractive.The last thing I will say is that I think the movie was somewhat miscast.

There have been many a failed attempt at turning a hit book into a hit movie.

I'm going to give 5 quick reasons why this movie/book series has creeped into my most favorite entertainment of all time, but most importantly why this movie is getting 5/5 stars:5. The length of the movie is just long enough to do justice to the entirety of the book without leaving too many gaping holes that need outside knowledge to fill.4. There were no drastic changes that would take away from the motives and the driving principles the book created thus making it necessary to read the books to truly understand what happens.3. The actors fit their roles and truly represented their roles masterfully making me actually believe they were the same people I read in the books.2. The movie itself captures all of the pure moments, the emotions, the ups and downs, and the essence of what made the books great has been transformed into digital media form.1.

This is normally contained within the text, or a line someone speaks. The movie starts giving us some background for the games, but we don't know why there was a rebellion in the first place, something that is in the book. The rebellion resulted in a lottery where teens from the various districts must now compete in a survivor battle to the death, all for the entertainment of the audience. Early in the film we hear, ""If no one watches, we won't have a game."" In other words if we stop watching reality TV shows, they will be taken off the air.In those other films the evil of society had been either, capitalism, socialism, the super rich, corporations, religion, or science. The irony of the film/book is that it makes fun of the viewer/reader for enjoying it. They are the problem with today's voyeuristic dummy down society, which like the movie can be divided into two groups"" Those who see the movie/games as entertainment. And the intellectuals who realize the metaphor contained within. I'm loving it! (Pardon my pop culture response, but it seems apropos.)There is a stark contrast in wealth and dress between those who participate in the games and the society who runs them. However, it is those who participate who ultimately empower those who run them, just like with war, the second message of the film which dates from Homer ""War is old men lying, young men dying.""Jennifer Lawrence, who I thought was Oscar worthy in ""Winter's Bone,"" immediately becomes our heroine when she volunteers to take the place of her sister in the Hunger Games. We don't expect her to die anytime soon. As the fighting begins I kept wondering if they were going to simply fight for everyone's entertainment or are we going to get a Captain Kirk/Agorn moment when he has defeated his opponent and refuses to kill him shouting, ""You are going to have to get your entertainment elsewhere!"" Or maybe we could end it like ""Death Race 2000"" where Frankenstein kills the president...but I am getting way ahead of myself.The victims, or tributes as they are called, are paraded and cheered having done nothing...similar to reality show TV ""stars."" (Yes I mean you talentless Snooki.) People wildly cheer because...they can. Woody Harrelson helps to bridge the time from when Jennifer Lawrence is selected until the fighting begins. Donald Sutherland appears as an unrealistic unlikeable President Snow, a composite character representing the evil of society. There are interviews and pageantry prior to the games during which time we get to know more about Jennifer and very little about the other contestants. It would have been nice to have known some of the quirky combatants and have them killed in ironic ways to their character, but maybe that was too much to ask about a film about shallow entertainment.Jennifer, with her honesty and rebellious attitude has become the fan favorite and our favorite because she is the only contestant that we know. She lacks the killer instinct...until she must. Alliances form and everyone wants to get the fan favorite aka Rambette Jennifer Lawrence, who did an excellent job to give girls a heroine being both a compassionate woman and a huntress.

She is one of our greatest new actors. I was sadly disappointed. Hardly any back story to set up the reason for the games. No character development for the 24 contestants. Peetas' hair style changes 8 times in the first half hour. So much for continuity. And the hand held camera movements during the battles, were done intentionally, to keep the bloodless battles PG13. An obvious ploy to garner the kid market. 'Battle Royale', a violent Japanese flick that came out about 10 years ago, had the same premise, so the idea is certainly not new. Whatever reasons for the hunger games, is just not translated in the film. Hence, we dont feel very much for the characters. Although Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all in a good performance, most of the other characters are quite laughable. Peeta is portrayed as a whiny wuss. It is difficult to transcribe any novel into a film, but it would have been interesting, to have seen this movie directed, lets say, by the late Tony Scott. I am sure we would have had quite a different vision. I would pass on this film. Although, I am now interested in reading the novel.

1342116,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B003EYVXV4,titania86,"[1, 3]","** This review contains spoilers for the book and the movie. **Katniss Everdeen lives in poverty stricken District 12 with her sister Primrose and her mother. The Reaping is approaching fast and Primrose is frightened she will be chosen even though it will be the first time her name is in the drawing. When Prim's name is called, Katniss volunteers as tribute to take part in the Hunger Games, where 2 young people (boy and girl, aged 12 to 18) from each of the 12 districts fight to the death for prestige and goods for their district. Only one victor survives. Katniss is plunged into a completely different world where being memorable and likeable will mean her survival. She will do what it takes to survive, but will it be enough?I read The Hunger Games a couple of years ago and it was never my favorite in the series. I felt it was a Battle Royale ripoff and the later books explored the dystopic world better and went beyond the obvious comparisons between the two works. This film made me forget all that. I was completely blown away and I really want to watch it about 20 more times. I haven't felt like this about a movie in a really long time. The ensemble cast was amazing, giving believable portrayal of characters I feel I know very well after reading 3 books about them. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen acted wonderfully. She always had an air of sadness yet responsibility. She made the tough heroine believable and relatable because her emotions were close beneath the surface despite her hard exterior. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket provided much needed humor that alleviated the emotion and drama of the story. The other most notable actors were Woody Harrelson as Haymitch (more comic relief and makes Katniss realize the gravity of the reality TV aspect) and Isabel Fuhrman as Clove (sociopath and career tribute that left me with a chill every time she was onscreen).This film did 3 things extremely well that made it one of the best book to film transitions I've ever seen: capturing the emotions, humanizing the otherwise unlikeable characters, and working out timing. Two scenes in particular were very emotional for me.  The scene where Katniss volunteers as tribute for her sister was absolutely heartwrenching even though I had seen at least some of the scene hundreds of times in the past month from the commercials. The other scene that made me bawl like a baby was when Rue died. It was so sudden it took me a few moments for her death to process. I had cried at the scene in the book, but it's different seeing it on the screen. It was captured perfectly and there wasn't a dry eye in my theater. The other tributes were well humanized despite being portrayed as villains, especially the career tributes. Marvel at the end made a speech about how even he won he would be doomed because the Games are all he was good for. It showed that the other tributes aren't the real villains; President Snow and all those that perpetuate these sadistic Games are. I was surprised at how well the film flowed from scene to scene. About half of the film was dedicated to portraying the world, the assessing of the tributes, and the reality television aspect of the Games. The Games took up the latter half. I was never bored and I never thought any of the scenes ran too long. Although every single scene of the book wasn't included in the film, the essential scenes were preserved and given a satisfying amount of time.The most important triumph of this film was that I was never distracted by analyzing each and every difference from the novel. I was completely immersed in the cruel and depressing world of The Hunger Games and wondered at the characters' capacity for hope in the face of a bleak totalitarian regime. The only drawback at all was the shaky cam got a little extreme at points.

I am a huge fan of the series, having read all the books months ago, but I've avoided the movie until all the hype died down, so that I could give an honest opinion, and here it is. The film was terrific, one of the best adaptation of a book I've read. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely perfect as Katniss and if she doesn't get a ton of awards for the role, there is no justice in Hollywood. That's the good news, however the movie was far from perfect. Friends who went with me and had never read the books, found it to be slow, and didn't understand certain things. At times, I could see their point. Several major things were rushed or just left out of the film. This led to some confusion, and then there's Peeta. I love Josh Hutcherson and thought he was terrific, but the portrayal of Peeta wasn't accurate. He was nowhere near as likeable as he is in the books and he comes off looking like kind of a pussy. The end of the games was also problematic, as they changed a key point that I thought was pivotal going into Catching Fire. It will be interesting to see what they do to fix that before the next film. Overall I loved the movie and thought it was awesome, but if you didn't read the books, you might be a little confused by parts of it and see it as slow. Parts of the film that dragged on were explained through thoughts in Katniss's head during the book. Without knowing what was going on at those points, I could see how some audience members may have been bored with it.

There was so much hype about this movie that my husband and I thought we had to see it.  Maybe something was lost by not seeing it in the theater but I just wasn't that into it.  I get that we are supposed to be horrified at the idea of sacrificing children for the sins of our forefathers.  I get that it would be a horrible experience that would turn a child into an animal and rip your humanity away and that two people refuse to become animals.  I get that there will always be people who stand to profit from the suffering of others.  I just didn't care, I didn't feel like there was enough to make a connection with the main characters.

1342140,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B003EYVXV4,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[5, 8]","The very best of science fiction tends to be memorable for more than just robots, space ships, and dystopian future. What makes them remarkable are the litany of ideas and concepts , both large and small, presented throughout. And if you can do that in a way that looks cool and is entertaining, then so much the better. It's one reason why 35 years later we still admire Star Wars, and why Hollywood continues to try and emulate it. Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games trilogy of novels falls into much the same category, a sprawling, epic adventure with social commentary to spare and a lead hero in Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) everyone can relate to. Yet people were justifiably worried about how that scope would be presented on the big screen, because more so than Harry Potter or Twilight, the exclusion of any single element could topple the immaculately constructed balance between fantasy and brutal realism that Collins constructed.There is little reason to fear, Team Gale and Team Peeta fans. The Hunger Games is everything a loyal reader could ask for, but more than that it's the type of film that promises a truly epic franchise in the making. With studios looking to adapt every semi-popular novel with the hopes of creating the next Twilight, few of them ever turn out to have the complexity and depth of character to stand the test of time. The Hunger Games is diverse enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience. There's enough of a love triangle to have people rioting in favor of Team Peeta or Team Gale, yet the action is equally intense and effective without being overly graphic.Credit immediately goes to Gary Ross, a seemingly odd choice for director who turns out to have been a perfect fit. Best known for Capra-esque movies like Dave, Seabiscuit, and the visually stunning Pleasantville, Ross is essentially doing the opposite of everything he's done before. The deep, textured story begins with a simply worded prologue, introducing us to the line of thinking that allows for something like the Hunger Games to exist. Taking place in the fictional realm of Panem, where the ruling Capitol lords over 12 separate districts, each poor in their own way but working to sustain themselves and the government. District 12 has had it the worst, a mining town that looks chillingly like the squalor of Winter's Bone, Jennifer Lawrence's big breakthrough performance. She plays a similarly strong, fearless young woman with a family completely dependent upon her. Katniss dotes on her younger, more fragile sister, Prim(Willow Shields), and does the work their mother seems incapable. To escape the burden of her life, Katniss occasionally scales the barrier fence into the restricted wilderness to hunt alongside her best friend, Gale(Liam Hemsworth), who has dreams of running away with her to start anew elsewhere.The hopelessness of their situation is made more stark by the decadence of the Capitol, which we see in quick flashes of brightly colored hair, an unending supply of food, and garish architecture. Meanwhile the people of District 12 look at bread as a rare delicacy.Any hope of escape is quickly dashed with the Reaping, a twisted lottery event held each year to select a boy and girl from each District to compete in the Hunger Games. The youngest have the fewest entries, while the oldest like Katniss and Gale have many, increasing their chances of being picked. When Prim has her name drawn, Katniss does the only thing she can think of to save her sister, and that is volunteer to take her place. The dramatics of the situation only brings a smile to the face of the flashy Effie Trinket(Elizabeth Banks), just the first taste that these games of literal life and death are seen merely as entertainment for the ruling class.Katniss is soon joined by Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson), a quiet and fiercely confident boy she shares a mysterious past with. A few rushed ""good-byes"" later and the two are quickly taken to the Capitol for training. Not just in the deadly arts they'll need to survive against 22 other ""Tributes"", but mainly in showmanship. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy(Woody Harrelson), is a survivor of the Games and butts heads with the gruff Katniss over her inability to make friends and impress potential sponsors. Peeta instantly takes to his new found celebrity, using it to make a stunning revelation on national television that forces everyone to fall in love with the two poor combatants from District 12. While this would please the toothy, pearly white grin of talk show host Caesar Flickerman(an inspired Stanley Tucci), it would draw the unwanted attention of President Snow(Donald Sutherland), who has a malicious vision for the Games that would send a chill up Darth Vader's spine.Looking back on when The Hunger Games was just entering production, one of the great debates was who could possibly take on the Katniss role in a believable way. Some felt Gary Ross needed to aim younger, but the decision was made to select the red hot Jennifer Lawrence, and it was a decision that proved to be the right one. She is simply phenomenal here, capturing some of that awkwardness of youth, but also showing a real strength and resolve of someone who has seen too much for someone of her age. The search always seem to be on for a new heroine that girls can look up to, and unfortunately too many of them have flocked towards Twilight's Bella Swan, even though she is a character who is who she is because of the guys in her life. How interesting would she be without a wolf and a vampire fighting over here? Not much. Katniss is different, and whether we ever saw Peeta or Gale and the inevitable squabble for her affections, she would still be a character worth following. She's incredibly likable, smart, and tougher than even her male counterparts. Katniss is a character every girl can actually look up to, genuinely one of the most fully realized movie characters of any gender.The rest of the cast is superb, as well. In particular Josh Hutcherson, who many(including me) felt didn't have the look or the natural presence the Peeta role demanded. He proves to be more than up to the task, showing flashes of real charisma in his verbal sparring with Stanley Tucci, and leading man charm when together with Lawrence. Lenny Kravitz is dead on perfect as Cinna, Katniss' stylist who sees her as more than just tool in the Capitol's games.How does the film compare to the book? Well, as with any adaptation there are some characters and story elements that need to be dropped. Ross, along with Collins and Billy Ray as screenwriters, have managed to maintain the story's integrity while cutting down some of the extraneous portions. One of the book's prevailing features was that it was seen entirely from Katniss's perspective, and they've managed to capture her internal monologue on screen, mainly thanks to Lawrence's emotive performance. There are some portions of the story that are intentionally glossed over, likely because they will become bigger factors in the sequels, which are already in development. Lionsgate knows they have a hit on their hands, so why wait? This is a minor quibble, and can looked past because the allegorical elements are so on point. This is what happens when our celebrity obsessed, reality TV culture goes too far. It bears some striking resemblances to a film called Series 7: The Contenders, in which people killed one another off in a highly rated television show. The easy comparison many have made is to the controversial Battle Royale, but the two aren't saying the same thing at all once you get past the surface similarities.Those who might have been turned off by the extreme amount of hype swirling around the film need to put all that aside and just see the movie. This is without question one of the best pieces of science fiction we have seen in years. By comparison, The Hunger Games is a better opening salvo than Twilight and Harry Potter delivered by far, and the potential for this to to be a significant, celebrated franchise appear to be forever in Gary Ross's favor.",5,Review: 'The Hunger Games',1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,8107,"['very', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'be', 'memorable', 'more', 'just', 'robots', 'space', 'ships',

How do you pacify such angry citizens? Simple: Reality television. No, not Jersey Shore, something much worse. Or better, depending on how you look at it.Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence of Winter's Bone and X -Men: First Class) is a skilled tracker, hunter, and survivalist who lives in the impoverished District 12 where most earn their living in the mines. Her mother (played by Paula Malcolmson) has been struggling since her husband died, leaving her to raise Katniss and her sister Prim by herself. Katniss (Lawrence) is sixteen and a close friend of Gale Hawthorne (played by Liam Hemsworth) who dreams of running away. Every year, each of the twelve districts randomly selects two children (one boy and one girl) or ""tributes"" no younger than 12 and no older than 18 and Gale (Hemsworth) believes he's dodged the bullet as long as he can. Still, when the tributes are selected, Gale is spared and so is Katniss. But when Prim (Katniss's sister) is chosen. Katniss volunteers to take her place. Making her and Peeta Melark, (a baker's son portrayed by Jess Hutcherson of Bridge to Terabithia and Journey to the Center of the Earth) the candidates for the 74th annual, winner-take-all, death match known as The Hunger Games. Held in the Capital, The Hunger Games are broadcast live to the entire nation. Each participant is trained, sponsored, and ranked and then locked in a massive, futuristic Coliseum with remote control hazards, predators, and cameras hidden throughout.Now, this was a much-anticipated film.

In the end, it sadly didn&#8217;t live up to my expectations.  Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, there was plenty of violence, suspense, the acting was pretty good, and it left you wondering what would happen next.  Those weren&#8217;t the main problems I had with the movie.  I felt that because of the targeted audience the makers of the movie tamed it down a little bit.  There was at least one, if not more, of the contestants that died off screen and all you heard was the blast that indicated another contestant had been killed off.  I also hated the scene where one of the move ruthless characters had a knife up to Katniss&#8217; neck and instead of killing her, which she clearly had no problems doing, decides to take the opportunity to have a little chat with her.  In the movie world that&#8217;s a recipe for allowing the protagonist an opportunity to escape.  Which, of course, happened seconds later.  There were plenty of other things that I didn&#8217;t like about the movie, which I won&#8217;t get into, but I think I&#8217;ve addressed the point that this movie was far from perfect.

1342154,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003EYVXV4,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Let me start off by saying that I haven't read the original books by Suzanne Collins. I would also rather not repeat the synopsis in detail here because so many reviewers have done that, with more than 2,500 reviews posted at the time of writing this. Already a huge commercial hit (more than 400 million dollars in US alone), ""The Hunger Games"" has garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. But is the film really worth that?If you looking for something entertaining, this is not the one you should choose. I almost forgot to say that this is a film by Lionsgate, a company responsible for the ""Saw"" franchise. You don't see much blood in ""The Hunger Games,"" but still watching kids killing each other is hardly entertainment, even though in the film's story it is done for the enjoyment of the rich. (Anyway, the shaky and fast-cut camera of ""The Hunger Games"" would not allow you to ""enjoy"" watching the deadly ""game."")The heroine Katniss Everdeen is effectively played by Jennifer Lawrence. Katniss volunteers to join the game instead of her younger sister. Strangely, while the rich citizens seem to be enjoying the game so much, some even becoming the financial supporters of their favorite participants, I couldn't understand why these people are so excited about the game itself. Now I'm not talking about moral dilemma or something like that. I'm talking about how dull and even pointless the game sequence is.For our heroine Katniss is being given an advantageous position with regard to the game. Her ""mentor"" Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), at first drunk, turns out a decent teacher giving her some good advice. Her costume designer Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is a nice person, who can help her get the ""sponsors."" Even some of the game's contestants help her survive, while they should be killing her. If luck is the key to survival, the director has surely made the point.You may call the film a social satire. Any dystopian story could be one, if only developed into a more biting commentary on society or humanity, which ""The Hunger Games,"" tame and shallow, is simply not. Even if you have not seen ""The Truman Show,"" ""Battle Royale"" or ""The Running Man"" - films made by the people who know what they are doing - you will notice something is not quite right with the story.

1342156,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003EYVXV4,Turfseer,"[10, 20]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5'The Hunger Games' is an amalgamation of many films and TV shows we've seen before. For starters, the long-running reality show 'Survivor' comes to mind as a good part of the film is set in the forest where the characters must rely on survival skills to survive. The film's premise, in which children and teens between the ages of 12 and 18 must fight to the death as part of a televised spectacle, is reminiscent of 1998's 'The Truman Show', where Jim Carrey's entire life is put under the microscope of a reality show, broadcast to millions.The setting of Hunger Games is a post-apocalyptic dystopian future similar to the 2010 British film, 'Never Let Me Go'. Both films posit a future where a society of mindless, brainwashed automatons are unable to rebel against a totalitarian system that calls for deathly self-sacrifice of the young. With all the characters adopting such a one note conformity, there's very little wiggle room for any kind of interesting drama in the film, which relies more on the cheap thrill of watching teenagers attempt to do themselves in vis-a-vis mortal combat.The rulers of the post-apocalyptic country we're introduced to, 'Panem', are more like unpleasant fops from an 18th Century Louis VI French court than the ineffectual pacifists of the 1993 sci-fi satire, 'Demolition Man', starring Sandra Bullock. And our 'common folk' protagonists 'Katniss' and 'Peeta', from 'District 12', remind us of an Appalachian setting, similar to scenes from 'Winter's Bone', the same film in which the Hunger Games' star, Jennifer Lawrence, was nominated for a Best Actress Academy award.The Hunger Games takes an interminably long time before we get to the meat of the story. The reason for this is that the film's scenarist, Suzanne Collins, seeks to extract as many tears as possible from her teenage audience, by dwelling on the victimization on the protagonist's younger sister, Primrose, and Katniss' sacrifice, when she volunteers to take her place as part of the Hunger Games. Can the cold-hearted leaders at the 'Capitol' be stand-ins for parents in general, as the 'kids' appear to be completely at the mercy of adults who hypocritically claim to be acting beneficently on their behalf.The Hunger Games won't begin until we're treated to the next long-winded sequence where the principals are introduced to the public via the big media broadcast. The criticism of the media here seems to be all too obvious but Stanley Tucci is effective as the foppish master of ceremonies. Like many of the 'twists' throughout Hunger Games, Kantniss' dress catching on fire during her TV interview, hardly seems fantastic at all. If you want better 'magic', check out any Harry Potter flick instead!Finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of the film--the fight to the death between the kids. One immediately thinks of a futuristic 'Lord of the Flies' here. Interestingly enough, director Gary Ross's herky-jerky style prevents us from really experiencing the full import of the violence. On one hand, that's commendable since the film's basic premise is wholly unappetizing. On the other hand, it prevents the film from being suspenseful, as the violence doesn't seem real, suggesting that these characters are also not real people.Hunger Games finally morphs into a completely dopey and comical spectacle as the teenagers (aided by the surly establishment) attempt to do one another in. As the games begin, the kids begin hacking each other with machetes. The rest of it is completely derivative including a dull computer-generated fire, a wasp nest falling from a tree, booby-trap explosions, more computer-generated nonsense (a pack of gnarling hounds), poisonous berries and a fight to the death on top of a weird sculpture called 'Cornucopia'.If this isn't ridiculous enough, at a certain point, the powers that be declare that there can now be two survivors, provided they're from the same district. This turns out to be a ruse and the new rule is rescinded which lead the protagonists to threaten mutual suicide. Although the bulk of the people are depicted as enjoying the spectacle of the mass killings at the beginning, the authorities now fear that a mutual suicide may cause unrest in the districts. Hence, the basic rules are changed, and now two are allowed to survive, instead of one.As Jennifer Lawrence appears to have signed on for three more Hunger Games sequels, she'll probably be set financially for life. Whether her overall reputation will survive after acting in such drivel, remains to be seen.The Hunger Games is really designed for young teenagers and older, less sophisticated teens who have little interest in reading anything resembling what any reasonably educated adult may refer to as 'literature'. It's a film that's mostly devoid of 'ideas' and appeals to devotees of soap operas, who always seem to end up entranced with one-dimensional villains and heroes or heroines, that inevitably end up on elevated pedestals!",1,Survivor meets The Truman Show meets Demolition Man meets Marie Antoinette meets Winter's Bone meets Lord of the Flies,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,5031,"['***', 'review',

No way in the future of America will people willingly let the government randomly take children just so 24 enter and 1 leaves. American people have been and always will be armed, even after the government is gone. This kind of behavior just does not work in our society. Granted this is a post-revolution future, but a revolution requires people with independence and the will to fight. In this version of the future they are sheep to the government. That is not what Americans will be, if there is a revolution all those sheep will not be around anymore. I cannot explain how little sense this story makes.To make things worse there is too much teen drama. Just way too much.

The Hunger Games was one of the first series I went towards, pretty much because of the Harry Potter like hype and books were getting. After reading the first book of course i was on line to see the film.I have to say what impressed me the most about this film was the actors chosen to play these characters. It seems each actor was picked specifically because they could not only act the parts, but their features and their acting styles were prefect fits. Jennifer Lawrence was great as usual. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson officially broken through and will definitely have work after this franchinse. Still, it was their supporting cast that impressed me the most, especially Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci. The story was very well translated to film, though it is very different from the book it was still great how the story got expanded a little to make it watchable. The only thing I didn't like and it seems to be something almost everyone has issues with. The shakey cam was just a little over done, but I understand why it was filmed the way it was.This was one of the best films I have seen this year and the book along side the film was definitely something I did not expect.

The special effects are quite sound, though nothing that hasn't been seen before. The score is fitting, but again, not outstanding. The costume designs and make-up were outrageous in the best way possible to fit the people of The Capitol.Though a lot of the movie is very action-oriented, the connections Katniss makes during the tense atmosphere of the film are moving, even - or perhaps, most especially - when they lead to heartbreak and pain.

Very Roman-esque, except that instead of gladiators or political prisoners, we have children doing the killing. Therein lies my biggest complaint against these books/movies. Children slaughtering each other in violent, ghastly, bloody, remorse-less ways. That alone renders these stories inappropriate in my view, especially considering these are marketed to children as readers. Beyond that, I just can't swallow the idea that the people would be so mindlessly accepting of this. Sure, they sulk and brood and mutter against it, but in the end, they just go along with it. Sure honey, go on and kill your friends, make sure your dress is pretty when you get selected. I mean... really?? It's just too far-fetched to be plausible to me, and that ruined it in the end.

After seeing her performances in Winter's Bone (2010) and The Burning Plain (2008) I have made it a point to follow her career. Solid actors and actresses are a rare breed in Hollywood so one best follow along while you can because once their first big budget, blockbuster hit comes along wherein style trumps substance, the days of truly human performances are gone.  Such was the case with Ashley Judd, Halle Berry, Tom Cruise, just to name a few.Nevertheless, I decide to go and see The Hunger Games (2012) because the movie looked to be a deft fusion of style and substance.  And for the most part it delivered.The StoryCo-written and directed by Gary Ross, The Hunger Games is based on the Suzanne Collins novel of the same name.  Jennifer Lawrence ( stars as Katniss Everdeen a 16-year old who along with her sister, Primrose (Willow Shields) and mother (Paula Malcomson) inhabit a world wherein hunger is the norm and Fascism rules in a place called Penem.As the movie opens it is time for The Hunger Games, a vulgar little affair in which one boy and one girl are chosen from each of the 12 districts surrounding the capital fight to the death on live television.  The winner will be fed for life, but there can be only one winner.  Katniss' sister Primrose is selected from their district, but Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is the boy chosen.My ThoughtsHaving never read the book upon which this movie was made I cannot speak to how close one followed the other.  I can state however that I did enjoy the movie.  Jennifer Lawrence turned in a meaty performance as the bow and arrow yielding heroine who uses her cunning to survive the cutthroat game of death.  I found her character believable, tough, but compassionate, and having never read the book, I was on the edge of my seat at times wonder what would happen to her.The Hunger Games is adequately dark to qualify as a thriller, but overly so.  The gee-wiz computer generated wizardry that has so marked movies out of Hollywood, was kept to a dull roar while the human story(s) were allowed to take center stage; yes my fellow movie lovers, real acting was allowed to take flower!The Hunger Games is rated PG-13 no doubt for its violent overtone; swearing is kept to a minimum and there is no sex to speak of.  Indeed other than wanton and sometime callous violence--something American teens are used to--there is nothing offense about the movie.When the credits rolled I was left wanting more, only because the story remained unfinished; this will be taken up by sequels, good thing because there were a lot of unanswered question dancing in the air at the end of the movie. Before they are released however I will read the book(s) just to flesh out the parts that were left on the editing room floor.

Villines ""WJ Villines""","[0, 0]","When assessing movies for quality, holywooders often fall way short of the top of the scale -- some however shine beyond the scale -- One movie that was way beyond the scale was The Mission staring Robert Dinero. It is not often when a movie that I expected to be limited turns out to be fantastic. One example of this was John Carpenter.Now, after being sure that I would not like a movie where teans are both the heros and the villans (after all, haven't we had enough of those with the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Power-rangers?), I watched this one with a major lack of expectations.This is one movie that is WAY over the Top of the Quality Movie Scale -- the story pulls you in fairly quickly, then it keeps you focused. Yes, you pick favorites and hope they get to be successful in their mission. But the story is inbedded in such politicalism and socialism that given everything that seems to be going on today feel to be a part of this story.The acting was supperb from all the cast, the editing did not leave anyone wondering if there would or should be a directors cut -- and the story spell was magical.I must say, I did not expect Amazon to provide this in their Prime Selections so that I could see it with out additional outlay of funds, but I am truely glad they did. I will probably mark this movie as one to add to my private movie collection once my finances start to improve again, until then, I will watch this one via Amazon Prime a couple more times.Fantastic for sure.----Update -- since my original viewing of this movie, I have read the book. I must be honest, I was avoiding both because of the idea of Teen on Teen violence this glamourizes -- I do understand the critics denouncement on that note. The movie was a brilliant composition, but the story does focus and glamorizes the violence which it seems we are seeing more and more of in our real life society -- Without reading the book, much of the understanding of this movie is lost -- this is actually NOT a story that glamorizes the violence, but is a cultural commentary of a society that is in fact degrading in a path leading to Tyranny -- the people are being placed into a state of growing fear to encourage us to surrender freedoms and protections that we used to stand up for. There is reason to believe there will be some kind of civil clash that could lead to the political climate as seen in this story -- So while this is a fiction - fantasy story, it is also a possibility and thus, the story does not glamorize the violence but shows a society where the violence is being used to suppress the people's freedoms.I still recommend the movie, but remember, by not reading the book, you are missing out on a bunch of understanding behind the story -- and the significance of various events and symbolic components. Watch the movie, then read the book, then re-watch the movie -- there will be a significant change in how you perceive the movie as a result.And if you have a Kindle and the Amazon Prime service, you can ""borrow"" the book without further cost -- it really is a value unto itself.",5,Movie Caliber is a scale too small,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,3097,"['When', 'assessing', 'movies', 'quality', 'holywooders', 'often', 'fall', 'way', 'short', 'top', 'scale', 'however', 'shine', 'scale', 'One', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'scale', 'was', 'Mission', 'staring', 'Robert', 'Dinero', 'not', 'often', 'when', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'limited', 'out', 'be', 'fantastic', 'One', 'example', 'was', 'John', 'Carpenter.Now', 'being', 'sure', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'where', 'teans', 'are', 'heros', 'villans', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'enough', 'likes', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Power-rangers', 'watched', 'one', 'major', 'lack', 'expectations.This', 'one', 'movie', 'WAY', 'Top', 'Quality', 'Movie', 'Scale', 'story', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'then', 'focused', 'Yes', 'pick', 'favorites', 'hope', 'get', 'be', 'successful', 'mission', 'story', 'inbedded', 'such', 'politicalism', 'socialism', 'given', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'today', 'feel', 'be', 'part', 'story.The', 'acting', 'was', 'supperb', 'cast', 'editing', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'anyone', 'wondering', 'would', 'should', 'be', 'directors', 'cut', 'story', 'spell', 'was', 'magical.I', 'must', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'Amazon', 'provide', 'Prime', 'Selections', 'could', 'see', 'out', 'additional', 'outlay', 'funds', 'am', 'truely', 'glad', 'did', 'will', 'probably', 'mark', 'movie', 'one', 'add', 'private', 'movie', 'collection', 'finances', 'start', 'improve', 'again', 'then', 'will', 'watch', 'one', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'couple', 'more', 'times.Fantastic', 'sure.', 'Update', 'original', 'viewing', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'must', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'avoiding', 'idea', 'Teen', 'Teen', 'violence', 'do', 'understand', 'critics', 'denouncement', 'note', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'composition', 'story', 'focus', 'glamorizes', 'violence', 'are', 'seeing', 'more', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'society', 'reading', 'book', 'much', 'understanding', 'movie', 'lost', 'actually', 'NOT', 'story', 'violence', 'cultural', 'commentary', 'society', 'fact', 'degrading', 'path', 'leading', 'Tyranny', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'placed', 'state', 'growing', 'fear', 'encourage', 'surrender', 'freedoms', 'protections', 'used', 'stand', 'up', 'reason', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'kind', 'civil', 'clash', 'could', 'lead', 'political', 'climate', 'seen', 'story', 'So', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'story', 'also', 'possibility', 'thus', 'story', 'not', 'glamorize', 'violence', 'society', 'where', 'violence', 'being', 'used', 'suppress', 'people', 'freedoms.I', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'remember', 'not', 'reading', 'book', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'bunch', 'understanding', 'story', 'significance', 'various', 'events', 'symbolic', 'components', 'Watch', 'movie', 'then', 'read', 'book', 'then', 're-watch', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'significant', 'change', 'how', 'perceive', 'movie', 'result.And', 'have', 'Kindle', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'service', 'can', 'borrow', 'book', 'further', 'cost', 'really', 'value', 'unto']",N/A

What a performance!!! PERFECT!!!!She never Flinched in her Masterful Performance!!!Josh Hutcherson played a very good supporting actor & did quite well in his role as well...This movie was a very, very good start to what hopes to be several more Lionsgate Movie Releases based on the book series...I would highly recommend going to see this movie on the big screen!

1342218,A1XE2JOZZKMEG6,B003EYVXV4,Wikileaker,"[0, 1]","There are a great many things wrong with this movie. The dialogue and character development are juvenile and boring (it was, after all, a so-called ""young adult"" book). Characters take actions that are not logical or reasonable. Much time is wasted developing threads that are never brought to fruition. This is perhaps because the story is Part One of a trilogy of books. Regardless, I am reviewing what now exists, and this movie doesn't hang together alone (without Parts Two and Three).A few examples of what my summary above includes:1) At the initial battle at the Cornucopia, when the girl from District 2 is chasing after Katniss, we are not shown how Katniss got away. The camera simply cuts to the other melees between the other Tributes, and the next we see of Katniss, she's made it into the woods and runs into Foxface. Are we supposed to assume that the girl from 2 just gave up the chase?2) Alot of time in the first hour is spent developing the notion of the importance of ""getting sponsors"". Haymitch says ""...things that can save your life...water, a knife, matches...only come from sponsors"". Well, Katniss found water herself, and got a knife and matches in the knapsack she snatched at the Cornucopia...NOT sponsors. In fact, she never gets any sponsors. Cinna cannot be a sponsor because he asks Katniss about being told about sponsors. Yes, she gets a jar of medicinal cream for herself and for Peeta...probably came from a sponsor? But the accompanying card is signed by ""H"", which we must understand to be Haymitch (not a sponsor). Yes, we are shown Haymitch talking with some wealthy Capitol types just after having watched TV coverage of Katniss ministering to her leg wound...those must be sponsors. But they didn't contribute because of any effort that Katniss made...it was all Haymitch. Therefore, all the talk of sponsors throughout the first hour of the movie was all for nothing. There is no greater sin of a storyteller than that of wasting the reader's time. Big mistake.3) This is the one that gets me. Remember Peeta walking around the woods with the District 1 and 2 alliance? How Cato explains that they need to keep Peeta alive long enough to show them where Katniss is? What do they do when they chase Katniss up the tree? They lie down and camp out with him! (Maybe they decided to keep him alive as a walking, talking store of meat, in case later they can't get any food. Instead of calling him ""loverboy"" they could start calling him ""Meat Locker""). Oh, and get this: did anyone notice that Peeta was allowed to FOLLOW the alliance members BEHIND, and carrying a SPEAR? And they even let him SLEEP with them?  How stupid/naive can you get?  And these are supposed to be ""Careers"", professionally trained Tribute volunteers from Districts 1 and 2! What a wus Peeta turned out to be; he had a perfect opportunity to stab one or two of them in their sleep and run off before they knew what'd happened. If he was really wanting to help his girl Katniss up in the tree, he could have done that.4) Last item, I promise. Remember the scene when Marvel throws the spear into Rue's chest? Somebody tell me why he threw it at Rue instead of Katniss? Katniss had the bow and arrows...Rue had nothing. Oh, and how when Katniss freed Rue from the snare, they just hugged each other instead of looking around for danger, which they should have known was coming because of Rue's cries for help. Ridiculous.There are alot of things wrong with this movie (hard to believe the author Collins herself adapted her book for the screen), but it has one big thing going for it: originality. It seems there's nobody left in Hollywood who knows how to think of anything new anymore. All we get nowadays are sequels, rehashed old plotlines, and these ""reimagined"" or ""rebooted"" superhero franchises. Is anybody else getting sick of all these tired old stories and characters? In my review ofAvatar, I noted the fact that its plot was just a ripoff of Frank Herbert'sDune. I awarded two stars for its copycat plot because I detest lazy, thoughtless writing. Just as Tom Clancy'sThe Hunt for Red Octoberwas just a ripoff of Craig Thomas'Firefox. On the other hand, I praisedBuriedandFermat's Roomfor their wealth of innovative and inventive ideas and presentations.So despite all its flaws, which are really apparent only upon watching the movie several times, the Hunger Games is an exciting movie the first time or two. Perhaps that's because of all the anticipation that preceded its opening, but it's still a decent experience to have at least the first time. I cannot call it a great movie, but it does try to be different, and in my book that's a huge plus that is worth being rewarded. I also find worthy its treatment of Big Ideas, such as when President Snow (Donald Sutherland) says that hope is the only thing stronger than fear. (though I think that's a worthy statement, I personally can't always agree with it. Love of country -- patriotism -- often prompts soldiers to overcome their fears. And the emotion of hate always trumps fear: when you are possessed with pure elemental hatred, fear vanishes. You're focused on destruction of the enemy.)So, though I have to callThe Hunger Gamesa two-star movie, it was a five-star effort. That's worth four stars for my review. I can only hope that when they get to writing and shooting the Hunger Games sequels, they will do a better job of translating the books to the screen. No, correction -- I can also hope this new franchise is the beginning of a long and successful career for the Hunger Games world of stories yet to be conceived.",4,"two star movie, but five star

The rest of the movie is about her survival in the games.I have to admit that I was at first skeptical about this movie, but the sudden twist by changing the scenery from an impoverished luddite community to a futuristic and eccentric society sold me on it.

The contestants, called ""tributes,"" range from ages 12-18 and there can only be one winner since it's a survival fight to the death!The first thing that impressed me was the realistic air and overall ambiance of the film, as well as the entire dystopian concept and story set-up.Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as the two ""tributes"" from District 12, Katniss and Peeta, are quality protagonists and I like the ambiguity of their feelings - are they for real or for show.Lenny Kravitz stands out as one of the few caring characters from the Capitol, while Woody Harrelson is effective as the drunken advisor to the tributes, a past victor of the hunger games. Also on hand are Elizabeth banks, as the creepy but sorta winsome host of the District 12 tributes; Donald Sutherland as Panem's dictatorial president; and Wes Bentley as his right-hand man with a beard Satan himself would covet.For me, the weak point of the film is the long third act, which constitutes the hunger games themselves, a fight-to-the-death in the forested wilderness (shot in the mountains of Western North Carolina). I anticipated this to be the best part, especially since I love survival stories and the wilderness, but it just wasn't as suspenseful or thrilling as it could have been. At the same time, it wasn't bad. The additions of the dubious ""mockingjay"" sequence and artificial horror-dogs who for some strange reason can't overtake the protagonists mar the film.I thought the name of the nation -- Panem -- was really strange, until I discovered that `Panem' means ""bread"" in Latin, as in the popular phrase ""bread and circuses"" (panem et circenses), which is figurative of superficial appeasement to pacify the masses. In the film, President Snow said something to this effect to Seneca Crane (Bentley). On top of this, the film shows flashbacks of Peeta intentionally burning literal bread and throwing it to the starving Katniss, which saves her. The bread motif appears elsewhere as well:as a parachute offering to Katniss from District 11 to show her their gratitude for her kindness to Rue (Amandla Stenberg) and the bread parachutes given to the tributes that communicated covert information.I was a bit bewildered by the ending, since it left some things up in the air, but I suppose it leaves room for sequels.When the credits began to role a song came on that just blew my mind; my wife motioned to leave, but I couldn't leave my chair while this awe-inspiring tune played. It's ""Abraham's Daughter"" by Arcade Fire, an incredible piece. Check it out on youtube.FINAL WORD: If the long third act were better I wouldn't hesitate to give ""The Hunger Games"" an A-level rating. As it is, it's a good dystopian adventure with some excellent aspects, like the entire set-up, the protagonists and closing song.The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes.GRADE: B",4,Worthwhile dystopian adventure,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,3243,"['Released', 'theaters', 'March', '2012', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'post-apocalyptic', 'film', 'based', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'popular', 'book', 'new', 'nation', 'Panem', 'North', 'America', 'where', 'Capitol', 'seat', 'Panem', 'wealthy', 'eccentric', 'populace', 'cruel', 'totalitarian', 'government', 'hunger', 'games', 'annually', 'brutal', 'reality', 'show', 'featuring', '24', 'contestants', 'Panem', '12', 'subjugated', 'districts', 'contestants', 'called', 'tributes', 'range', 'ages', '12-18', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'winner', 'survival', 'fight', 'death', 'first', 'thing', 'impressed', 'was', 'realistic', 'air', 'overall', 'ambiance', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'dystopian', 'concept', 'story', 'set-up.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'two', 'tributes', 'District', '12', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'are', 'quality', 'protagonists', 'like', 'ambiguity', 'feelings', 'are', 'real', 'show.Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'out', 'one', 'few', 'caring', 'characters', 'Capitol', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'effective', 'drunken', 'advisor', 'tributes', 'past', 'victor', 'hunger', 'games', 'Also', 'hand', 'are', 'Elizabeth', 'banks', 'creepy', 'sorta', 'winsome', 'host', 'District', '12', 'tributes', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Panem', 'dictatorial', 'president', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'right-hand', 'man', 'beard', 'Satan', 'would', 'covet.For', 'weak', 'point', 'film', 'long', 'third', 'act', 'hunger', 'games', 'fight-to-the-death', 'forested', 'wilderness', 'shot', 'mountains', 'Western', 'North', 'Carolina', 'anticipated', 'be', 'best', 'part', 'especially', 'love', 'survival', 'stories', 'wilderness', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'suspenseful', 'thrilling', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'additions', 'dubious', 'mockingjay', 'sequence', 'artificial', 'horror-dogs', 'who', 'strange', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overtake', 'protagonists', 'mar', 'film.I', 'thought', 'name', 'nation', 'Panem', 'was', 'really', 'strange', 'discovered', 'Panem', 'bread', 'Latin', 'popular', 'phrase', 'bread', 'circuses', 'panem', 'et', 'circenses', 'figurative', 'superficial', 'appeasement', 'pacify', 'masses', 'film', 'President', 'Snow', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'Seneca', 'Crane', 'Bentley', 'top', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'Peeta', 'intentionally', 'burning', 'literal', 'bread', 'throwing', 'starving', 'Katniss', 'bread', 'motif', 'elsewhere', 'as', 'well', 'parachute', 'offering', 'Katniss', 'District', '11', 'show', 'gratitude', 'kindness', 'Rue', 'Amandla', 'Stenberg', 'bread', 'given', 'tributes', 'communicated', 'covert', 'information.I', 'was', 'bit', 'bewildered', 'ending', 'left', 'things', 'up', 'air', 'suppose', 'room', 'sequels.When', 'credits', 'began', 'role', 'song', 'came', 'just', 'blew', 'mind', 'wife', 'motioned', 'leave', 'could', ""n't"", 'leave', 'chair', 'awe-inspiring', 'tune', 'played', 'Abraham', 'Daughter', 'Arcade', 'Fire', 'incredible', 'piece', 'Check', 'out', 'youtube.FINAL', 'WORD', 'long', 'third', 'act', 'were', 'better', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'give', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'A-level', 'rating', 'good', 'dystopian', 'adventure', 'excellent', 'aspects', 'entire', 'set-up', 'protagonists', 'closing', 'song.The', 'film', '2', 'hours', '22', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

They put in just about every major piece from the book and did a decent job in casting. Gale and Katniss are a little too well fed for district 12. Gale is freaking buff and these people are suppose to be starving. Katniss is described in the book to be scrawny and boney like a runway model figure - Jennifer Lawrence is not. Cato need to be more psychotic. He trained his entire life to kill. The movie portrayed him just like a high school bully - Johnny from Karate Kid or something.  I know, I know, nitpicking. Better to have good actors than perfect figures. Anyways, fans of the series should be happy. If you didnt read the books you are missing out on a lot of good information, because in the movie we dont get all of Katniss' thoughts. I had only two disappointments. One is that Haymitch (Woody Harrelon) wasnt drunk enough. He is basically one sip from passing out throughout the entire series. Barely capable of speech. Woody didnt portay that in the movie. The second disappointment is that the flying ships did not appear to collect the dead tributes. This plays an important role in part 2 Catching Fire and would have been a nice setup here.

I had a very similar reaction to this movie, an indication of the faithfulness of the book-to-film transfer.For a basic plot summary, ""The Hunger Games"" sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) & Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) thrown into a battle-to-the death with 23 other young people as a result of a ""1984""-like dystopian society bent on total population control.  Living in a society completely controlled by ""The Capitol"", Katniss & Peeta struggle to survive in the deathly competition while at the same time sending a message of hope to the thirteen districts watching the Hunger Games event.In terms of being faithful to the book, this movie succeeds tremendously.  Director Gary Ross takes a great written story and adeptly adapts it to the big screen.  All the major events happen as written by Suzanne Collins, while even the minutiae is, for the most part, accurate.  There's really nothing to get upset over in the translation, besides (of course) the usual pairing down of some background dialogue to keep the film from going even longer than its 2 hours, 22 minute runtime.The casting/acting is also quite well-done.  About the only cast member that didn't potentially live up to the billing was Liam Hemsworth as Gale.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the two leads as well as the auxiliaries such as Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, & Elizabeth Banks, to name a few.Basically, ""The Hunger Games"" movie succeeds because of the strength of the original story and the faithful adaptation of that story.  Because this is (at heart) a young-adult story, a lack of deeper character development & plots prevents me from giving it a full five stars (fair or not).  Other than that, though, there is nothing else negative I can say about the experience.",4,Did You Like/Dislike The Book?

1342259,AXROMYH3MTVRZ,B003EYVXV4,Zorro,"[4, 6]","Hackneyed and silly, there is nothing remotely believable about this story or its execution.  The entire premise, of a society that allows its government to send 17-year-old boys trained in killing and wilderness survival to murder 12-year-old girls, is flatly absurd.  Even the most oppressive and barbaric societies in the history of the world have had no ritual comparably fatuous.  As for the execution, it is trite from start to finish.  There is a &#34;chosen one,&#34; a girl who grew up bow hunting and can basically outshoot Olympic gold medalists with a style of bow and arrows she's never even used before.  There is an inane teenage love triangle (shades of Twilight).  There is the placid comic-book evil of a tyrant who trims roses (instead of stroking a cat) while plotting to crush the hopes and dreams of a forlorn and mostly passive populace (shades of the Star Wars Emperor or the less imaginative James Bond villains).  There is trite dialogue with no spark of wit or insight.  Redeeming qualities?: Meh.  Some of the sets were nice.",2,"Utter tripe, Part I",1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,1053,"['Hackneyed', 'silly', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'believable', 'story', 'execution', 'entire', 'premise', 'society', 'government', 'send', '17-year-old', 'boys', 'trained', 'killing', 'wilderness', 'survival', 'murder', '12-year-old', 'girls', 'flatly', 'absurd', 'Even', 'most', 'oppressive', 'barbaric', 'societies', 'history', 'world', 'have', 'had', 'ritual', 'comparably', 'fatuous', 'execution', 'trite', 'start', 'finish', '34', 'chosen', 'one', '34', 'girl', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'bow', 'hunting', 'can', 'basically', 'outshoot', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medalists', 'style', 'bow', 'never', 'even', 'used', 'before', 'inane', 'teenage', 'love', 'triangle', 'shades', 'Twilight', 'placid', 'comic-book', 'evil', 'tyrant', 'who', 'roses', 'instead', 'stroking', 'cat', 'plotting', 'crush', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'forlorn', 'mostly', 'passive', 'populace', 'shades', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Emperor', 'less', 'imaginative', 'James', 'Bond', 'villains', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'spark', 'wit', 'insight', 'Redeeming', 'qualities', 'Meh', 'sets', 'were', 'nice']",N/A
