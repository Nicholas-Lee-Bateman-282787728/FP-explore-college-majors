1578734,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B008YKV2NW,Adron Gardner,"[1, 2]","License to Kill feels like what could have been.  Almost as if it was a dry run through.  First, it's filmed too tight and lit like a basketball game.  There's not much wide angle and half the time it looks like an episode of Scarecrow and Mrs. King on TV.  If you ignore that bad 80s cliche directing, poor lensing and lame dialog, there could be a really good Bond movie, but it's not all here. The story itself is pretty solid in a way. Junk the opening wedding and crappy gun battles and it's almost believable. Bond becomes a Ronin and chases revenge - that in itself is near genius they reused to lesser effect in the Daniel Craig movies.  The movie is hard edged in content but not in actual execution.  Better direction, more money, darker photography and we would be praising this as the ultimate modern Bond. Instead it feels as if we're watching Timothy Dalton fight tooth and nail while being forced to re-enact Romancing the Stone with a 9mm to his head.  Robert Davi phones in his typical 80s thorn job and Bencicio del Toro looks like he's not old enough to watch the movie let alone star in it, but Talisa Soto is welcome if underused.  Timothy Dalton very well could have been the first Daniel Craig.  He had the acting chops to sell reality and the presence to sell a laugh.  While George Lazenby threw away a good opportunity, Dalton was never given one.Yep, what could have been.  They should have hired Lawrence Kasdan.All that said, the Blu-Ray is mostly good looking.  Some scenes have a crisp clarity even though they are often over lit.  Later scenes play soft and a little smoothed over with noise reduction.  The sound is very crisp, however.  Good Blu-Ray, overall.License to Kill is the Bond movie I fight hardest to enjoy.  It's just hard to ignore the unending disappointment.  While an ice palace may have killed Brosnan's Bond career in Die Another Day, it's the 80s that killed Timothy Dalton.

His performance in The Living Daylights and License to Kill were layered with subtext and had a visceral presence none have captured till the arrival of Daniel Craig. He's even got a palm recognition gun, something Craig only got in Skyfall. Dalton was twenty years ahead of the curve. Poor scripts, low production values and bad screenplays got the better of him.

1578738,A7Y6AVS576M03,B008YKV2NW,gobirds2,"[9, 11]","LICENCE TO KILL is an interesting and progressive follow-up to Timothy Dalton's version of a world weary James Bond in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.Dalton's Bond certainly possesses the drive that Connery gives Bond and adds more realism and conviction in his no-nonsense performance. Dalton posses the intensity and a certain presence that Connery often played with his tongue in cheek, but Dalton adds an enigmatic quality of the lonely world-weary blunt instrument to Bond. At times one can detect a melancholic aura tinged with disgust for his line of work. These were qualities that Dalton openly wanted to put into his performance. This film integrates the thinking man's hero and the man of action into Dalton's Bond.James Bond resigns in this film, putting his current assignment aside, and sets out on a relentless crusade of revenge for the mutilation of his friend, Felix Leiter, and the death of Leiter's wife.  Why should Bond loose his objectivity and his professionalism over this incident? There is duty and there is loyalty and honor. Sometimes these virtues become in conflict.Dalton's Bond has little time for levity or diversion from his personal mission at hand. Yet, he is the dedicated civil servant to some higher order in a world gone cynical and unsympathetic. Once Bond breaks into Milton Krest's warehouse in Key West and proceeds to get pulled in by M at the Hemmingway House, the film focuses on the vengeful Bond. We see Sharkey's body being towed to Krest's boat, another victim of Sanchez, and Bond in a restrained fit of controlled rage takes care of business immediately in one of the better scenes from the series. Eventually, Bond catches up with and confronts Sanchez face to face in many scenes that are full tension and suspense.  Ultimately, they have a very brutal no-holds-bared showdown.LICENCE TO KILL contains good performances. One of the best is that of Benicio Del Toro's as Dario, a Sanchez henchman. Dario's screen presence is twisted and contorted bringing the notion that evil menace is the only reason for his existence in life. Don Stroud was very credible and somewhat likeable as Heller, the head of security and Sanchez's private army. Wayne Newton actually brought a nice touch of comic relief as Professor Joe Butcher, head of a meditation temple and front for Sanchez's laboratories. Anthony Zerbe brought his unique brand of histrionics to his role of the seemingly drunken smuggler Milton Krest. From a sentimental point of view, it was good to see David Hedison reprise his role as Felix Leiter and it was nice to see Desmond Llewelyn as Q in the field in a meatier role than usual. Robert Brown gave his most credible performance as M in this film. Brown never possessed the charisma that Bernard Lee brought to the role, but Brown as M brings a cold detachment in his scene with Bond even deploying sharpshooters in the event that the rogue agent may attempt to act irrationally when his ""Licence to Kill"" is revoked.LICENCE TO KILL is one of the better Bonds.",5,World Weary and Grittier Bond,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,3018,"['LICENCE', 'TO', 'KILL', 'interesting', 'progressive', 'follow-up', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'version', 'world', 'weary', 'James', 'Bond', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DAYLIGHTS.Dalton', 'Bond', 'certainly', 'drive', 'Connery', 'Bond', 'more', 'realism', 'conviction', 'no-nonsense', 'performance', 'Dalton', 'intensity', 'certain', 'presence', 'Connery', 'often', 'played', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'Dalton', 'enigmatic', 'quality', 'lonely', 'world-weary', 'blunt', 'instrument', 'Bond', 'times', 'one', 'can', 'detect', 'melancholic', 'aura', 'tinged', 'disgust', 'line', 'work', 'were', 'qualities', 'Dalton', 'openly', 'wanted', 'put', 'performance', 'film', 'thinking', 'man', 'hero', 'man', 'action', 'Dalton', 'Bond.James', 'Bond', 'resigns', 'film', 'putting', 'current', 'assignment', 'aside', 'out', 'relentless', 'crusade', 'revenge', 'mutilation', 'friend', 'Felix', 'Leiter', 'death', 'Leiter', 'wife', 'Why', 'should', 'Bond', 'loose', 'objectivity', 'professionalism', 'incident', 'duty', 'loyalty', 'honor', 'Sometimes', 'virtues', 'become', 'conflict.Dalton', 'Bond', 'little', 'time', 'levity', 'diversion', 'personal', 'mission', 'hand', 'dedicated', 'civil', 'servant', 'higher', 'order', 'world', 'gone', 'cynical', 'unsympathetic', 'Once', 'Bond', 'breaks', 'Milton', 'Krest', 'warehouse', 'Key', 'West', 'proceeds', 'get', 'pulled', 'M', 'Hemmingway', 'House', 'film', 'vengeful', 'Bond', 'see', 'Sharkey', 'body', 'being', 'towed', 'Krest', 'boat', 'victim', 'Sanchez', 'Bond', 'restrained', 'fit', 'controlled', 'rage', 'care', 'business', 'immediately', 'one', 'better', 'scenes', 'series', 'Eventually', 'Bond', 'up', 'confronts', 'Sanchez', 'face', 'face', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'full', 'tension', 'suspense', 'Ultimately', 'have', 'very', 'brutal', 'no-holds-bared', 'showdown.LICENCE', 'TO', 'KILL', 'good', 'performances', 'One', 'best', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Dario', 'Sanchez', 'henchman', 'Dario', 'screen', 'presence', 'twisted', 'contorted', 'bringing', 'notion', 'evil', 'menace', 'only', 'reason', 'existence', 'life', 'Don', 'Stroud', 'was', 'very', 'credible', 'somewhat', 'likeable', 'Heller', 'head', 'security', 'Sanchez', 'private', 'army', 'Wayne', 'Newton', 'actually', 'brought', 'nice', 'touch', 'comic', 'relief', 'Professor', 'Joe', 'Butcher', 'head', 'meditation', 'temple', 'front', 'Sanchez', 'laboratories', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'brought', 'unique', 'brand', 'histrionics', 'role', 'seemingly', 'drunken', 'smuggler', 'Milton', 'Krest', 'sentimental', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'David', 'Hedison', 'reprise', 'role', 'Felix', 'Leiter', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Desmond', 'Llewelyn', 'Q', 'field', 'meatier', 'role', 'usual', 'Robert', 'Brown', 'gave', 'most', 'credible', 'performance', 'M', 'film', 'Brown', 'never', 'possessed', 'charisma', 'Bernard', 'Lee', 'brought', 'role', 'Brown', 'M', 'cold', 'detachment', 'scene', 'Bond', 'even', 'deploying', 'sharpshooters', 'event', 'rogue', 'agent', 'may', 'attempt', 'act', 'irrationally', 'when', 'Licence', 'Kill', 'revoked.LICENCE', 'TO', 'KILL', 'one', 'better', 'Bonds']",License to Kill
