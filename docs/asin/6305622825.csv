This is the weaker of the two, but still enjoyable. Sean Connery is not equalling his performances in Finding Forrester and The Untouchables, but he brings some fun to the part. Catherine Zeta Jones is fine, but this movie is supposed to be a fun old caper, and it lacks some of the flair that Crown had in excess. Whenever the two were stealing something the movie was fun, but it was just about a half-hour too long. It was okay, but so was the DVD. The deleted scenes had no audio, but the studio made the right choice cutting them.

It's really too bad that that's really all that it is. The countless suspenseful scenes, and pulse-quickening action is so plentiful, that this movie has very little actual plot.

Anyway, the romantic subplot is far from romantic, and is very disjointed from the rest of the story.

Catherine Zeta-Jones is definitely a gorgeous and  sensual woman with a lot of class.She strongly resembles the classic  Hollywood beauty reminiscent of Vivian Leigh from Gone With The Wind and  other Hollywood sexy sirens of the 30's, 40's, and 50's.What's amazing  about Jones is how she can switch off or un-do her thick Welsh-European  accent in any movie and convert over to either American or Mexican (Zorro);  Talk about ironing out your natural accent.

Still, there some scenes (not enough) which contained real suspense and thrilling action. The ending was entirly unconvincing and unrealistic.

Otherwise, I tend to agree with those reviewers who found faults with this caper. It is oddly uneven: parts of it are not bad at all. The scenery is splendid. The technology is well above my head. Some of the action is quite exciting. Totally implausible, anything is possible,  particularly as it draws on almost every other suspense heist ever made. Some parts drag, others seem unnecessary. The whole thing doesn't gel, and in the end it's all too complicated to understand. Moreover, after all the strenuous work that Connery puts in, in the final scene he definitely looks as if he's had enough, and is just looking to put his feet up, and perhaps take a wee dram before hitting the sack.

471389,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6305622825,David Baldwin,"[3, 4]","This is a terrific latter day thriller that brings to mind the work of Hitchcock.  The plot twists are clever yet plausible.  The motives of the main characters and true identities are shadowy which adds to the intrigue of the film.  The film looks terrific and the action and stuntwork are excellent.  The film is anchored by two dynamic performances by Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  At the time much was made of the age difference between the two(Connery was 67 and Zeta-Jones was 29) but the chemistry between the two makes it a non-factor.  Connery, in probably his last film that required grueling physical exertion, shows that in the twilight of a storied career that he won't go quietly into the night.  This was Zeta-Jones' second American film. In her first, ""The Mask of Zorro"", she was good but her role there did not have the heft of ""Entrapment"".  Aside from her natural beauty that just explodes on screen she more than holds her own with Connery.  There is a mystique to her character, an insurance investigator who is out to ensnare Connery's thief.

For the first 30 minutes are utter chaos -- not giving the audience the  information it needs, stingy with exposition, and quite frankly badly  scripted, staged, and acted.  Catherine Zeta-Jones comes alive onscreen,  though, once she is paired with Connery -- faced with the task of matching  Connery's legendary screen presence, she faces up to the task admirably,  projecting charisma and a good degree of emotional authenticity.  Not a  great performance, but a solid one.  Connery waltzes his way through  another not-so-challenging but fun performance.The execution of the  dramatic scenes as well as the set-ups for the scenario were very poorly  done by Jon Amiel (Copycat).  However, Amiel redeems himself partially by  the slam-bang last half hour of the film, where suspense and tension are  both high and the stunts have a degree of freshness to them.

There seems to be a hidden meaning to every scene, and to almost every scene a twist that brings us into a totally different spot.  It's like a wild roller coaster ride in the dark.The second is the robberies.  It is amazing to watch the high tech devices in the hands of experts used to waltz through some of the most intricate security systems.  There are some minor slips in the robberies technically speaking, but nothing that destroys the film or even the robberies.The third element is the chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is extremely intriguing especially because of the age difference.  And who's to say that normal people don't do strange things like that all the time?I'm tacking a fourth on here: In my opinion this film is the best work either Connery or Zeta-Jones has ever done.Also if you are looking for a similar movie with real style.

Ginny Barker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who worked for Waverly Security had a much larger goal in mind robbing the International Clearance Bank during the Millenium Celebratrion on New Year's Eve in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia but she needed help. She had been planning this event for a few years ... Hector Cruz (Will Patton) head of security had noticed she had no friends. She had no social life. She worked long hours doing statistical calculations and creating computer graphics examining all angles of the rooms and items her company insured and protected. He worried about her. She convinced Hector to let her attempt to catch and bring to justice the highly successful thief: McDougall (Sean Connery). He was a handsome foxy older gentleman, a wealthy Scotsman who had no need for the money but was a thief for the challenge of it. He was in the gallery where the Rembrandt was showcased during its opening exhibit, he was the likliest suspect. Hector was worried because two agents had previously disappeared trying to apprehend McDougall but Gin Barker convinced him because she was a woman ... she could do it. Despite misgivings, he gave her the chance to try.Sean Connery played the aging gray haired foxy thief to perfection. He lived in Scotland, in a castle on an isolated island. He thought he had everything ... until he met Gin Barker. She followed him about in London, and watched him wander into a computer company, where he managed to steal five chips easily worth a million dollars each. She was exhausted as she returned to her hotel room, only to discover her luggage missing. She was too tired to report it immediately, pealed off her clothes and and prepared for bed ... totally naked because her dressing gown was among the missing items. She was shocked to discover someone staring at her in the dark. It was Mac (McDougall). He asked why was she following him around London. She then presented to him her grandiose plans. He mentioned his rules: ""first we try, then we trust"" and the corollary, ""it's strictly business"" ...First he tested her and when she passed all his challenges, beyond his wildest expectations, he took her up on the job. They trained for the highest value monetary robbery of all time. This film appeals on multiple levels: it includes mystery, romance, tension, unexpected twists and turns in the plot and exotic locales, London, Scotland and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The May - December romance and relationship which builds from total distrust, to mutual respect, to outright admiration is fun to watch. Catherine Zeta-Jones is believable, beautiful and in fantastic form as she executes gymnastic maneuvers that would make a Gold Medal Female Olympics Champion blush with pride. Sean Connery delivers a superb performance and also delivers outstanding one line responses to her confident approach. He says, ""I don't like surprises."" She replies, ""There won't be any."" He countermands, ""Trust me, there always are."" This is a highly enjoyable film and receives my highest recommendation for acting, story-line, plot development, action, and intrigue.

Virginia is young and naive andshe takes the lies and garbage that Mac says at face value. Mac is not even a goodliar yet Virginia's character is dumb enough to believe this old thief'ss lies.Now on to the dvd itself:The DVD is very well done and contains a greatnumber of features:* Deleted scenesThe deleted scenes in the movie are actually quite good, in fact, I think they were alot better than a couple of the scenes in the finished draft of the movie.One great deleted scene is the car chase that Mack and Virginia get into while trying to dodge a couple of hitman that are tracking them down.The scene has a great climax at the end that has you guessing what's going to happen next.The scene is actually in the film, but what you get in the finished movie is actuallyless than half of the original scene!!Needless to say, I think this scene was great and should have been put in the original film.Other features in the DVD include:* Special feature on the making of the film*Special commentary on the film itselfThe commentary is teriffic, the director Jon Amiel, provides a lot of great insights and fact into the characters and Catherine Zeta herself, that fans may notknow.*Alternate ending to the film!!!The alternate ending in the film is actually very similiar to the original endingwith minor differences.*Special trailers of the film* Production Notes and much more!!!Entrapment from head to toe is one of the best heist/thriller movies in quite a long time.It gets predictable in a couple of areas, but the film is entertaining from beginning toend.Rent the DVD and enjoy it, along with the film itself.",3,Entrapment a DVD review,1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,2791,"['Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'star', 'two', 'ingenious', 'jewel', 'painting', 'money', 'burglars', 'who', 'plan', 'huge', 'heist', 'turn', 'millenium', 'New', 'Years', 'Eve', '1999.Zeta', 'actually', 'insurance', 'detective', 'Virginia', 'Baker', 'trying', 'find', 'person', 'responsible', 'couple', 'burglary', 'crimes', 'area.She', 'Mack', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'aka', 'Robert', 'MacDougal', 'person', 'rather', 'try', 'bring', 'get', 'man', 'confidence', 'try', 'pull', 'big', 'heist', 'thus', 'implicating', 'Mac', 'more', 'andgetting', 'evidence', 'put', 'bars', 'long', 'time.Mack', 'not', 'idiot', 'very', 'first', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'pulled', 'great', 'heist', 'otherwill', 'either', 'be', 'jail', 'long', 'time', 'worse', '2', 'contrasting', 'styles', 'movie', 'styles', 'pulling', 'different', 'heists', 'movie', 'really', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'stunts', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'including', 'culminatingclimatic', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Mac', 'Virginia', 'plot', 'big', 'escape', 'aftera', 'are', 'problems', 'film', 'however', 'Virginia', 'young', 'naive', 'andshe', 'lies', 'garbage', 'Mac', 'face', 'value', 'Mac', 'not', 'even', 'goodliar', 'yet', 'Virginia', 'character', 'dumb', 'enough', 'believe', 'old', ""thief'ss"", 'lies.Now', 'dvd', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'greatnumber', 'features', '*', 'Deleted', 'scenesThe', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'fact', 'think', 'were', 'alot', 'better', 'couple', 'scenes', 'finished', 'draft', 'movie.One', 'great', 'deleted', 'scene', 'car', 'chase', 'Mack', 'Virginia', 'get', 'trying', 'dodge', 'couple', 'hitman', 'are', 'tracking', 'down.The', 'scene', 'great', 'climax', 'end', 'guessing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next.The', 'scene', 'actually', 'film', 'what', 'get', 'finished', 'movie', 'actuallyless', 'half', 'original', 'scene', 'Needless', 'say', 'think', 'scene', 'was', 'great', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'original', 'film.Other', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', '*', 'Special', 'feature', 'making', 'film*Special', 'commentary', 'film', 'itselfThe', 'commentary', 'teriffic', 'director', 'Jon', 'Amiel', 'lot', 'great', 'insights', 'fact', 'characters', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'fans', 'may', 'notknow', '*Alternate', 'ending', 'film', 'alternate', 'ending', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'similiar', 'original', 'endingwith', 'minor', 'differences', '*Special', 'trailers', 'film*', 'Production', 'Notes', 'much', 'more', 'Entrapment', 'head', 'toe', 'one', 'best', 'heist/thriller', 'movies', 'quite', 'long', 'time.It', 'predictable', 'couple', 'areas', 'film', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'toend.Rent', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'film']",Entrapment VHS

He is in Entrapment as well, too bad the script fails him again.Entrapment has Catherine Zeta Jones (Zorro) playing an insurance investigator (ooh, scary!) on the trail of Connery the master thief.  Ving Raimes (Mission Impossible) hoins in an all too minor role.  The plot is full of twists, and there is really some genuine excitement during the chase scenes, but I couldn't help but feel I've seen all this before and better (see Sneakers). The sexual tension between Connery and Jones is also excellent until it turns into something which left most of the group I saw it with crying out, &quot;He's old enough to be her grandfather!&quot; No points for grossing out the audience.

Some of the classic Hollywood pairings have been older men with younger women: Bogie/Bacall, Clark Gable/Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn, even Julia Roberts/Richard Gere. So...move on. What matters is if the pair work well together, and Catherine and Sean are great together. By the way they never actually hook up, but if they had, it would have been very intense. The chemistry between the 2 was very evident to me throughout the entire movie, I was egging on a romance. But Sean's character is above the physical involvement level with partners, so Catherine is held at bay. The movie reminded me of a classic thriller, a movie loaded with action...but thank God, not an &quot;action movie&quot;. Enough of a hint at romance to keep us gals interested...but certainly not a romance. And on top of everything it was smart and well done.

471431,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6305622825,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 3]","We are introduced early in this movie to someone whole steals a valuable Rembrandt Van Rijn painting.  We do not see this person because the person is wearing a mask.  Insurance investigator Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) tells her boss that she thinks Robert ""Mac"" MacDougal (Sean Connery) stole the painting.  Her boss tells her that she has blamed MacDougal for half the thefts committed for a period of time I no longer recall.  The beginning of this movie sounds very similar to ""The Thomas Crown Affair.""  Fear not, this movie has more twists than that movie, to which is bears only a few similarities.  This movie is much more like ""It Takes a Thief,"" though you may not realize how much until you reach the end.Baker begins following Mac around, ostensibly to find some clue as to where the Rembrandt painting might be.  However, we soon learn that Baker has something much bigger in mind.  Things become even more interesting when Baker reveals to Mac that she stole the Rembrandt, and she used a clever, non-obvious way of getting the painting out of the building.  Soon we learn that there is even more to the theft of the Rembrandt.  I know I was surprised.What happens next is a sort of competition, where we see Baker and Mac continuing to try to outdo each other.  If you are not paying attention it is easy to get lost in who is doing what and when they are doing it; thus the advantage of DVDs where you can keep stepping back a chapter or so to try and digest the complexity of this movie.  Eventually the plot reveals that Baker has a plan to steal a huge (billions) sum of money by breaking into a computer.  The plan involves very fine timing that has to coincide with the millennium (of course, otherwise there would be no sense of urgency).Once things get set into motion the movie moves forward briskly.  There is getting into the building, the timing of breaking into the computer, and the nasty mistake that sends dozens of people chasing after them.  It is all good fun up until someone gets caught.This movie tends to get polarized reviews.  I think mostly it is about your expectations.  If you like Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and try to avoid analyzing action movies very much, then you would probably like this movie.  On the other hand, if you do not care for either actor, or you spend too much time realizing that there are a number of continuity problems and implausibilities sprinkled throughout the movie, you will likely be too focused on those and disappointed that the director was hoping you would like his cleverness in spite of the fact that much of the plot was impossible.In balance, I should note that Christopher Young received a BMI Film Music Award in 2000 for this movie.  Catherine Zeta-Jones won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actress - Action.  Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery won European Film Awards Audience Awards for Best Actress and Best Actor.  In addition, Ving Rhames was nominated for the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor - Action, and the Motion Picture Sound Editors of USA nominated the movie for a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing for a Foreign Feature.  To keep things in perspective, Catherine Zeta-Jones was also nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Actress and Zeta-Jones and Connery were nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Couple.As for me, once I realized that the movie had too many implausible situations, I just enjoyed the plot and tried to figure out what was what.  I also must point out that I have liked Connery in nearly every movie he has starred in.  He has a lot of charisma.  I also like Zeta-Jones, though she has much less talent than Connery.I must admit that the ending puzzles me just a little.  It seems to me that there came a point where the director made something happen, and ignored the trivial problem that what he did was impossible.  I think he was hoping that people would like the end of the movie so much that they would not notice the problem.  Unfortunately, nearly everyone noticed.  Fortunately for the director, many people did not care.",3,It Takes a Thief - Redux,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,4138,"['are', 'introduced', 'early', 'movie', 'someone', 'whole', 'steals', 'valuable', 'Rembrandt', 'Van', 'Rijn', 'painting', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'person', 'person', 'wearing', 'mask', 'Insurance', 'investigator', 'Virginia', 'Baker', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'boss', 'Robert', 'Mac', 'MacDougal', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'stole', 'painting', 'boss', 'blamed', 'MacDougal', 'thefts', 'committed', 'period', 'time', 'no', 'longer', 'recall', 'beginning', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'not', 'movie', 'more', 'twists', 'movie', 'only', 'few', 'similarities', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'Thief', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'reach', 'end.Baker', 'following', 'Mac', 'ostensibly', 'find', 'clue', 'where', 'Rembrandt', 'painting', 'might', 'be', 'However', 'soon', 'learn', 'Baker', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'mind', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'Baker', 'Mac', 'stole', 'Rembrandt', 'used', 'clever', 'non-obvious', 'way', 'getting', 'painting', 'building', 'Soon', 'learn', 'even', 'more', 'theft', 'Rembrandt', 'know', 'was', 'surprised.What', 'happens', 'next', 'sort', 'competition', 'where', 'see', 'Baker', 'Mac', 'continuing', 'try', 'outdo', 'other', 'are', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'easy', 'get', 'lost', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'when', 'are', 'doing', 'thus', 'advantage', 'DVDs', 'where', 'can', 'keep', 'stepping', 'back', 'chapter', 'so', 'try', 'digest', 'complexity', 'movie', 'Eventually', 'plot', 'reveals', 'Baker', 'plan', 'steal', 'huge', 'billions', 'sum', 'money', 'breaking', 'computer', 'plan', 'very', 'fine', 'timing', 'coincide', 'millennium', 'course', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'sense', 'urgency', '.Once', 'things', 'get', 'set', 'motion', 'movie', 'forward', 'briskly', 'getting', 'building', 'timing', 'breaking', 'computer', 'nasty', 'mistake', 'dozens', 'people', 'chasing', 'good', 'fun', 'up', 'someone', 'caught.This', 'movie', 'get', 'polarized', 'reviews', 'think', 'mostly', 'expectations', 'like', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'try', 'avoid', 'analyzing', 'action', 'movies', 'very', 'much', 'then', 'would', 'probably', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'actor', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'realizing', 'are', 'number', 'continuity', 'problems', 'implausibilities', 'sprinkled', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'too', 'focused', 'disappointed', 'director', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'like', 'cleverness', 'spite', 'fact', 'much', 'plot', 'was', 'impossible.In', 'balance', 'should', 'note', 'Christopher', 'Young', 'received', 'BMI', 'Film', 'Music', 'Award', '2000', 'movie', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'won', 'Blockbuster', 'Entertainment', 'Award', 'Favorite', 'Actress', 'Action', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'won', 'European', 'Film', 'Awards', 'Audience', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Actor', 'addition', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'was', 'nominated', 'Blockbuster', 'Entertainment', 'Award', 'Favorite', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Action', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Sound', 'Editors', 'USA', 'nominated', 'movie', 'Golden', 'Reel', 'Award', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Editing', 'Foreign', 'Feature', 'keep', 'things', 'perspective', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Razzie', 'Award', 'Worst', 'Actress', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Connery', 'were', 'nominated', 'Razzie', 'Award', 'Worst', 'Couple.As', 'once', 'realized', 'movie', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'implausible', 'situations', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'plot', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'also', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'have', 'liked', 'Connery', 'nearly', 'movie', 'starred', 'lot', 'charisma', 'also', 'Zeta-Jones', 'much', 'less', 'talent', 'Connery.I', 'must', 'admit', 'ending', 'puzzles', 'just', 'little', 'came', 'point', 'where', 'director', 'made', 'something', 'happen', 'ignored', 'trivial', 'problem', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'impossible', 'think', 'was', 'hoping', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'not', 'notice', 'problem', 'Unfortunately', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'noticed', 'Fortunately', 'director', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'care']",Entrapment VHS

As with most action movies, there are definitely scenes that are very unrealistic, yet others that I never would have dreamed of, that under the right circumstances could work.Things that improved the rating of the movie:1)  NO SEX SCENES!  It is nice to see a movie that has great action, yet did not put in filth just to sell it.2) A unique plot.  So many flicks are about the same thing, just done differently.3) Great twists!  The movie kept you guessing until the end.  I kept wondering how it would end.  No, the good guys do not always win!4) Good acting.5) It kept a good pace through the entire movie.  I did not get bored by it being too slow nor did I get overwhelmed by it moving so fast that I could not keep track of what was happening.Things that hurt the rating of the movie:1) The use of the ""F"" word several times.  There was absolutely no need to add profanity to this movie, especially what I consider being hard core profanity.2) A couple completely unbelievable and unrealistic scenes.  Stretch the imagination, but keep to things that can really happen.Overall, this was a good movie with a good plot.  I would recommend this movie - especially if you have TV Guardian to filter out the few times of foul language.My Rating: B+",4,"Great Action, but not too Intense!",1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,1428,"['great', 'movie', 'number', 'twists', 'couple', 'highly', 'skilled', 'thieves', 'traveling', 'world', 'find', 'steal', 'worth', 'millions', 'billions', 'dollars', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'definitely', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'others', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'dreamed', 'right', 'circumstances', 'could', 'work.Things', 'improved', 'rating', 'movie:1', 'NO', 'SEX', 'SCENES', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'great', 'action', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'filth', 'just', 'sell', 'it.2', 'unique', 'plot', 'So', 'many', 'flicks', 'are', 'same', 'thing', 'just', 'done', 'differently.3', 'Great', 'movie', 'kept', 'guessing', 'end', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'No', 'good', 'guys', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'win', '4', 'Good', 'acting.5', 'kept', 'good', 'pace', 'entire', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'bored', 'being', 'too', 'slow', 'did', 'get', 'overwhelmed', 'moving', 'so', 'fast', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'was', 'happening.Things', 'hurt', 'rating', 'movie:1', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'absolutely', 'need', 'add', 'profanity', 'movie', 'especially', 'what', 'consider', 'being', 'hard', 'core', 'profanity.2', 'A', 'couple', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'unrealistic', 'scenes', 'Stretch', 'imagination', 'keep', 'things', 'can', 'really', 'happen.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'plot', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'especially', 'have', 'TV', 'Guardian', 'filter', 'out', 'few', 'times', 'foul', 'language.My', 'Rating', 'B+']",Entrapment VHS
471437,A129YBX5BVNW2,6305622825,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[9, 10]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY ISSUE ***I have to admit to a guilty pleasure on this one - I've always liked the wonderfully cheesy ""Entrapment"" - especially the slightly odd yet very convincing chemistry between the young and beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones and the old but still incredibly sexy Sean Connery. You genuinely feel that Connery fancies Jones and she likewise - and apparently that was the case. You can see that Connery actually likes and admires her and it gives the film a great dynamic - enjoying themselves rather than just grinning and bearing it.Which is a shame, because I was hoping that this would be a decent buy on BLU RAY, but it isn't.The principal reason is not the film itself (which is very entertaining), but the way it was filmed. There's a sort of filtered haze over at least 75% of the print (possibly hiding someone's age my dear?) that now looks even worse - accentuated by its transfer to the mercilessness of High Def. The picture isn't crap, but it's NOT 1080P DEFINED either - and it's absolutely NOT AN IMPROVEMENT over say a dirt-cheap DVD. ""Entrapment"" on BLU RAY looks murky and poorly executed most of the time - and for a film that was issued in 1999, that's just not good enough.The Extra Feature is a commentary by Director Jon Amiel, but that's all (no making of, no interviews). Presentation is in Letterbox 16:9 (so it fills the full screen) and languages include French, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch and English For The Hard-Of-Hearing.I'd say hire this before you buy it.

471438,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305622825,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","Entrapment is a good old-fashioned crime caper movie. The story of a master criminal playing cat and mouse with an investigator has been done a hundred times before, and sometimes better, as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair. Still, this picture has enough humor, thrills and plot twists to keep most viewers pleasantly occupied for a couple of hours. It also has something most movies don't have -Sean Connery.Mr., Connery, now nearing seventy years old, remains as elegant, wise and impish as ever. Perhaps this is because, unlike today's generation of male stars, he was never buffed, pumped up and made to look like a model in a media blitz for Nordic Track. Even as James Bond, he had a five o'clock shadow, body hair, and skin that was not deeply tanned all over. He has always been a star that we are comfortable and at home with.As Robert MacDougal, art thief of thieves, Connery is, well, Connery. This role is hardly a stretch for him, but he plays it with his usual skill. MacDougal has gotten rich over the years and seems to pinch art treasures these days because he enjoys it. At the outset, we see him pull an especially spectacular heist, and soon, Virginia Baker, a beautiful insurance investigator, is on to him. She is played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose performance is not quite up to her usual standard. Virginia cleverly works her way into MacDougal's life and persuades him to help her with an even more incredible robbery. He doesn't trust anyone, but he is both amused and intrigued by Virginia. The plot gets more and more involved, and we spend a lot of time guessing who is fooling whom.The movie's pacing is uneven, which causes it to bog down from time to time. In particular, the scenes in which MacDougal trains Virginia for the upcoming heist are too drawn out. These scenes are followed by some exciting stuff, but why the wait? This problem is especially prevalent in movies like Entrapment, because they start off in high gear. You can't then easily shift into low gear without losing the audience. Director Jon Amiel might have been wise to consider the style of three decades worth of James Bond movies. They don't just start with a bang, they are all one big two hour bang.The violence quotient in Entrapment is low, which I am always glad to see. Perhaps more than sex, violence in movies should not be gratuitous. If it's essential to the plot, then fine. Otherwise, we all get the point with a minimum of bloodshed.",3,"Old-fashioned, thriller has lots of humor",1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,2463,"['Entrapment', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'crime', 'caper', 'movie', 'story', 'master', 'criminal', 'playing', 'cat', 'mouse', 'investigator', 'been', 'done', 'hundred', 'times', 'sometimes', 'better', 'remake', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'Still', 'picture', 'enough', 'humor', 'thrills', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'most', 'viewers', 'pleasantly', 'occupied', 'couple', 'hours', 'also', 'something', 'most', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '-Sean', 'Connery.Mr.', 'Connery', 'now', 'nearing', 'seventy', 'years', 'old', 'elegant', 'wise', 'impish', 'ever', 'Perhaps', 'because', 'today', 'generation', 'male', 'stars', 'was', 'never', 'buffed', 'pumped', 'up', 'made', 'look', 'model', 'media', 'blitz', 'Nordic', 'Track', 'Even', 'James', 'Bond', 'had', 'five', ""o'clock"", 'shadow', 'body', 'hair', 'skin', 'was', 'not', 'deeply', 'tanned', 'over', 'always', 'been', 'star', 'are', 'comfortable', 'home', 'with.As', 'Robert', 'MacDougal', 'art', 'thief', 'thieves', 'Connery', 'well', 'Connery', 'role', 'hardly', 'stretch', 'usual', 'skill', 'MacDougal', 'gotten', 'rich', 'years', 'pinch', 'art', 'days', 'outset', 'see', 'pull', 'especially', 'spectacular', 'heist', 'soon', 'Virginia', 'Baker', 'beautiful', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'performance', 'not', 'quite', 'up', 'usual', 'standard', 'Virginia', 'cleverly', 'way', 'MacDougal', 'life', 'help', 'even', 'more', 'incredible', 'robbery', ""n't"", 'trust', 'anyone', 'amused', 'intrigued', 'Virginia', 'plot', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'guessing', 'who', 'fooling', 'whom.The', 'movie', 'pacing', 'uneven', 'bog', 'down', 'time', 'time', 'particular', 'scenes', 'MacDougal', 'trains', 'Virginia', 'upcoming', 'heist', 'are', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'scenes', 'are', 'followed', 'exciting', 'stuff', 'why', 'wait', 'problem', 'especially', 'prevalent', 'movies', 'Entrapment', 'start', 'high', 'gear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'then', 'easily', 'shift', 'low', 'gear', 'losing', 'audience', 'Director', 'Jon', 'Amiel', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'wise', 'consider', 'style', 'three', 'decades', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'start', 'bang', 'are', 'one', 'big', 'two', 'hour', 'bang.The', 'violence', 'quotient', 'Entrapment', 'low', 'am', 'always', 'glad', 'see', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'sex', 'violence', 'movies', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'essential', 'plot', 'then', 'fine', 'Otherwise', 'get', 'point', 'minimum', 'bloodshed']",Entrapment VHS

I found it to be quite a fast paced movie, although I'm not keen on Sean Connery (Mac). I don't like the spelling of the name :) and the only reason they had to bring in Catherine Zeta Jones (Gin) is because he's getting on a bit now! I'm always going to be a bit iffy about Catherine, as her accent is so WEIRD now, and she reverts back to her Welsh accent, particularly when she wants people to believe she's still the same little Welsh girl that starred in Darling Buds Of May. I don't think so! She keeps saying ""combuder"" instead of ""computer"". Watching her struggle with the name Kuala Lumpur in half-Welsh-half-American is genuinely funny.Both actors do a great job of portraying their characters. Sean Connery does a brilliant eye roll a lot of the time, and is probably the only actor who can get away with saying ""If I'm late, I'm dead"".The film is shot in Kuala Lumpur, what looks like Scotland, and London, I think. The Scotland scenery looks lovely, very peaceful and remote. The building used for exterior shots of Mac's safe house (Castle Duart on the Isle of Mull) is the ancestral home of the Chief of the Clan MacLean.I love the whole stealing of precious items, it's so weird how much thought & work actually goes into it during the film. And you're always holding your breath, waiting for them to hit a laser, or for a security guard to spot them.The finale to this, I will NEVER understand, no matter how many times I watch it! It's very subtle, highly original, and you're left guessing until the very last frame, and trying to search the screen! In this, there are double-crosses, triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses, enough to leave you spinning. Is he double-crossing her? Is she double-crossing him? Is Ving Rhames in this for anything other than hard cash, and lots of it? Considering he doesn't have much of a role, and he's not really who you think he is!There's been a lot of comparisons to a movie called The Thomas Crown Affair. Sorry, but I haven't seen this, so I'm not likely to compare.There's a lot of sexual chemistry between Catherine & Sean, although you'll be glad to hear, they never really get it on, and it's almost a paternal attraction on Sean's side.Forget the negative reviews for this movie. You're not supposed to take this film at all seriously, you're supposed to be watching the pretty lady get herself into all kinds of positions (Michael Douglas must love that!) with some laser beams.",3,Never trust a naked woman,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,2627,"['Cos', 'face', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'when', ""'re"", 'naked', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'questionable', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'own', 'opinion', 'guess', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'keen', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Mac', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spelling', 'name', 'only', 'reason', 'had', 'bring', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Gin', 'getting', 'bit', 'now', ""'m"", 'always', 'going', 'be', 'bit', 'iffy', 'Catherine', 'accent', 'so', 'WEIRD', 'now', 'back', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'particularly', 'when', 'people', 'believe', 'still', 'same', 'little', 'Welsh', 'girl', 'starred', 'Darling', 'Buds', 'May', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'saying', 'combuder', 'instead', 'computer', 'Watching', 'struggle', 'name', 'Kuala', 'Lumpur', 'half-Welsh-half-American', 'genuinely', 'funny.Both', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'brilliant', 'eye', 'roll', 'lot', 'time', 'probably', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'saying', ""'m"", 'late', ""'m"", 'dead', '.The', 'film', 'shot', 'Kuala', 'Lumpur', 'what', 'Scotland', 'London', 'think', 'Scotland', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'very', 'peaceful', 'remote', 'building', 'used', 'exterior', 'shots', 'Mac', 'safe', 'house', 'Castle', 'Duart', 'Isle', 'Mull', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Chief', 'Clan', 'MacLean.I', 'whole', 'stealing', 'precious', 'items', 'so', 'weird', 'how', 'much', 'thought', 'work', 'actually', 'film', ""'re"", 'always', 'holding', 'breath', 'waiting', 'hit', 'laser', 'security', 'guard', 'spot', 'them.The', 'finale', 'will', 'NEVER', 'understand', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'very', 'subtle', 'highly', 'original', ""'re"", 'left', 'guessing', 'very', 'last', 'frame', 'trying', 'search', 'screen', 'are', 'double-crosses', 'triple-crosses', 'quadruple-crosses', 'enough', 'leave', 'spinning', 'double-crossing', 'double-crossing', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'anything', 'other', 'hard', 'cash', 'lots', 'Considering', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'role', 'not', 'really', 'who', 'think', 'been', 'lot', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'called', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'Sorry', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'likely', 'compare.There', 'lot', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'Catherine', 'Sean', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'hear', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'almost', 'paternal', 'attraction', 'Sean', 'side.Forget', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'watching', 'pretty', 'lady', 'get', 'kinds', 'positions', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'must', 'love', 'laser', 'beams']",Entrapment VHS

Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and  Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of  Zorro. But is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual,  and sexual ?  I find the movie entertaining, as it shows 2 people  enjoying doing what they like best - no, I am not saying you should do the  same thing ! - but as it happens in life, people perform so much better  when they really like what they do.  The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones  youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery's less evident, more inward  quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime  experience.  As they go about doing and accomplishing things together, the  old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth.  Slowly he starts to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of  his age, he feels that, to a certain extent he cares for her.  While, at  the same time, she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually  liking him on her side. Admittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between  Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair  and eyes, but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with  occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.

Berquist,"[0, 0]","As much as &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; surprised me with its exciting plot and charismatic lead actors, &quot;Entrapment&quot; disappointed me. Here's why-The plot is a little clunky- a heist in  Kuala Lumpur (for the geographically illiterate, that is in Malaysia) that  can only be pulled off at midnight of December 31st, 1999 because of the  Y2K computer glitch. Interesting, topical, and a little too expository at  times for my taste. I was genuinely surprised by the trick ending to  &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;. I didn't see it coming and yet it was  entirely believable. I didn't buy the trick ending to  &quot;Entrapment&quot;. I did sort of see it coming, and it wasn't  believable. Too left field for my liking.Much was made of the casting of  this movie- since Sean Connery is old enough to be his co-star's  grandfather. Personally it didn't bother me too much- Connery is still the  epitome of the action star and still has the intensity and passion to carry  a film all by himself. I hate to say it, but the problem I have with this  movie is with Catherine Zeta-Jones, Connery's costar. Zeta-Jones is a  stunningly beautiful woman who looks very good here, and also, in this film  at least, is a stunningly bad actress who hits all of the wrong notes and  is not believable in her role.What else?

You get engulfed into the action practically as the movie starts and the rollercoaster ride ends when the movie ends. So who's got the time to examine wether frame 121 was sharp enough or if that squeeky noise on the right channel was really perfect.Once you enter in the game it won't let you loose one minute and you will almost shout at it to stop, but as Zeta-Jones, you will be dragged even deeper into the charade and be so fascinated by it that you won't want it stop once it does.The finale is a pure surprise and, though not unexpected for a Hollywood movie, truly original.If you like this kind of movies, this one is certainly for you and will keep you guessing to the end on the who does what to whom and why... but who is really what and does really what to whom?

Zwick,"[1, 4]","The &quot;heist&quot; plot has been a staple of movies down through the decades, including such films as &quot;Rififi,&quot; &quot;Topkapi,&quot;  &quot;Gambit,&quot; &quot;How to Steal a Million,&quot; &quot;The Hot  Rock&quot; ad infinitum. In most cases, the object of the carefully crafted  theft usually involved priceless jewels or artwork. In the latest  installment, &quot;Entrapment,&quot; there are indeed valuable tangible  works to be lifted, but, in the style of true '90's thievery, the real  goldmine lies in the more abstract vein of computer banking and currency  transfer. Alas, the aptly named &quot;Entrapment&quot; falls into a trap of  its own making, gussying up a hopelessly conventional script with a display  of impressive computer hardware and eyeboggling gadgetry in a vain attempt  to overcome dull, barely believable characters and a script totally devoid  of the cleverness and wit necessary to carry this sort of story off.Sean  Connery and the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones portray accomplished thieves  who, after a customary skirmish of mutual doubt and suspicion, decide to  steal first a priceless Chinese mask and then $8 billion from the Southeast  Bank in Koala Lampur. To give the film's its patina of contemporary  relevance, the script inserts timely references to Y2K and the millennial  bug - all to no avail. For unfortunately, Connery and Zeta-Jones, though  both very charismatic stars in other circumstances, do not register high on  the credibility scale here. It is hard to believe that this doddering dolt  and this whiny, weepy fashionplate could possible concoct, let alone carry  out, such elaborate heists and even gravity-defying stunts. Even less  believable are the romantic interludes between this 60-year old man and  this 20-something year old woman. The scenes in which Connery trains Jones  to perform elaborate tricks of physical dexterity are dull and cutesy - and  the final scene of reconciliation (at an empty train station) is so  hopelessly contrived that the filmmakers seem to have thrown all logic out  the window and allow the characters to perform feats that actually defy the  laws of physical possibility.The basic purpose of &quot;Entrapment&quot;  seems to have been to allow two likable actors the chance to cavort in a  myriad of eyepopping settings and to dazzle the audience with the latest in  technocyber hardware. It's too bad that the less techno value of a solid  script driven by smart dialogue and well developed characters was not  downloaded into this film as well.",2,dull heist caper,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,2559,"['quot', 'heist', 'quot', 'plot', 'been', 'staple', 'movies', 'down', 'decades', 'including', 'such', 'films', 'quot', 'Rififi', 'quot', 'quot', 'Topkapi', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gambit', 'quot', 'quot', 'How', 'Steal', 'Million', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hot', 'Rock', 'quot', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'most', 'cases', 'object', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'theft', 'usually', 'involved', 'priceless', 'jewels', 'artwork', 'latest', 'installment', 'quot', 'Entrapment', 'quot', 'are', 'indeed', 'valuable', 'tangible', 'works', 'be', 'lifted', 'style', 'true', ""'90"", 'thievery', 'real', 'goldmine', 'more', 'abstract', 'vein', 'computer', 'banking', 'currency', 'transfer', 'Alas', 'aptly', 'named', 'quot', 'Entrapment', 'quot', 'trap', 'own', 'making', 'gussying', 'up', 'hopelessly', 'conventional', 'script', 'display', 'impressive', 'computer', 'hardware', 'eyeboggling', 'gadgetry', 'vain', 'attempt', 'overcome', 'dull', 'barely', 'believable', 'characters', 'script', 'totally', 'devoid', 'cleverness', 'wit', 'necessary', 'carry', 'sort', 'story', 'off.Sean', 'Connery', 'beautiful', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'portray', 'accomplished', 'thieves', 'who', 'customary', 'skirmish', 'mutual', 'doubt', 'suspicion', 'decide', 'steal', 'first', 'priceless', 'Chinese', 'mask', 'then', '8', 'billion', 'Southeast', 'Bank', 'Koala', 'Lampur', 'give', 'film', 'patina', 'contemporary', 'relevance', 'script', 'timely', 'references', 'Y2K', 'millennial', 'bug', 'avail', 'unfortunately', 'Connery', 'Zeta-Jones', 'very', 'charismatic', 'stars', 'other', 'circumstances', 'do', 'not', 'register', 'high', 'credibility', 'scale', 'here', 'hard', 'believe', 'doddering', 'dolt', 'whiny', 'weepy', 'fashionplate', 'could', 'possible', 'concoct', 'let', 'alone', 'carry', 'out', 'such', 'elaborate', 'heists', 'even', 'gravity-defying', 'stunts', 'Even', 'less', 'believable', 'are', 'romantic', 'interludes', '60-year', 'old', 'man', '20-something', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'scenes', 'Connery', 'Jones', 'perform', 'elaborate', 'tricks', 'physical', 'dexterity', 'are', 'dull', 'cutesy', 'final', 'scene', 'reconciliation', 'empty', 'train', 'station', 'so', 'hopelessly', 'contrived', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'have', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'allow', 'characters', 'perform', 'feats', 'actually', 'laws', 'physical', 'possibility.The', 'basic', 'purpose', 'quot', 'Entrapment', 'quot', 'have', 'been', 'allow', 'two', 'likable', 'actors', 'chance', 'cavort', 'myriad', 'eyepopping', 'settings', 'dazzle', 'audience', 'latest', 'technocyber', 'hardware', 'too', 'bad', 'less', 'techno', 'value', 'solid', 'script', 'driven', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'downloaded', 'film', 'as', 'well']",Entrapment VHS

Entrapment  takes you out of the humdrum into a life of  sophisticated crime.  Elegant art works,  computerized finance, exotic  locations and unusual people.  Big Tam always manages to  provide rich wit,  delivered effortlessly with his particular charm.  Here, he's partnered  with  insurance investigator Zeta-Jones as they weave through an bizarre  array of heists, each  building from one to the next.  The ultimate goal  must be achieved in a specific time and  place.  The finale is inevitable,  but given Connery's film history, not disappointing nor  surprising.Big  Tam has developed an inexplicable ability to draw out the best of his film  partners.  In his  only truly serious film, Medicine Man, he brought a  lustre to Lorraine Bracco not seen in her  other films.  Entrapment  displays Catherine Zeta-Jones as more 'alive' than any of her other  films.  Anthony Hopkins could only use her as decoration in Zorro, but against  Connery, she  presents a wider range of expression.  Still appearing a bit  constrained, she's at least  competent in this role, if not  outstanding.Entrapment almost seems one of a new genre of Connery type  roles.  The Rock, Medicine  Man, Hunt for Red October and this film present  him as the devious outcast who makes  good.  It's not a bad type, although  one wonders what the insurance companies think of  presenting us with such  a successful thief always going scot-free.

The version I saw was a never ending string of cliches embedded into a plot so flimsy it couldn't stand up if it were not for Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The direction of Jon Amiel was a never ending series of well worn manipulation techniques that were not even well done. I don't mind being a passive observer, but I do not like to be blatantly manipulated.Several times during the movie I found it difficult not to laugh out load at the ludicrousness of what I was seeing. For example, in the well advertised scene of Catherine Zeta-Jones wriggling her way through the fake laser beams I couldn't stop thinking ""Why doesn't she just crawl"" or ""What was the point of that move?"" It's indicative of the whole movie. It's a scene played for the audience, and we aren't supposed to be there. In another scene between Sean Connery and Ving Rhames, Rhames scolds Connery for changing partners etc. Who is this scene for? We discover later in yet one more feeble plot twist that these two know this conversation is a sham, but rather than playing it out to further some clever hidden agenda it is solely to pull the wool over the eyes of the audience. And as I've stated before, the audience is not supposed to be there.There are so many good caper movies...

Like every action flick,  it leans toward the unrealistic, especially a scene in which they're  dangling from a 78-floor building, but that's what makes it fun to  watch.There are several plot twists that will keep you wondering what  will happen next, and you will always be surprised.

An insurance investigator and art thief played by Catherine Zeta-Jones (too hot to even by near the retired guy) is assigned to check out the retired burglar.

471480,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6305622825,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","When this movie was originally released in theatres, I was warned not to see it on the big screen. I was told it was a bad movie, not worthy of watching. I didn't understand why so many people told me that; I mean the film has Sean Connery, contains a seemingly interesting plot, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. There was also a lot of discussion over the fact that Sean Connery was old enough to be Catherine Zeta-Jones' grandfather, yet he was playing her love interest. Luckily, I didn't see the movie in theatres and I am grateful for that.ENTRAPMENT starts off on the right foot. The film's early scenes are interesting and demand attention. However, about thirty minutes later, the movie takes an unexpected twist into territory it should not have entered: romantic entaglement with bad dialogue and no chemistry. Even though Sean Connery is pushing 75, he's still considered by many to be one of the sexiest men alive.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is a beautiful young woman and attracts the eye of many men. Nevertheless, just because two people are physically attractive does not mean that there will be any chemistry between them. In this film the chemistry between Connery and Zeta-Jones is like the chemistry between the same sides of a magnet: instead of uniting, the two objects pull away from each other.  Of course, it doesn't help that the movie is full of bad dialogue and many of the emotional scenes of Zeta-Jones are totally forced with no reality or logic to them at all. The screenwriters should have kept to the basics instead of relying on dazzling special effects to save the film.There are a few good action scenes, especially at the beginning. However, towards the end even those are so blown out of proportion that you begin wondering when the masked superhero will arrive that can match Connery's superhuman skills and foil his evil plans.
