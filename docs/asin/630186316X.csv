270954,A2RUUTTFJQ7CBH,630186316X,Anton Tobias,"[7, 7]","With the recent loss of Corey Haim I've noticed a decent amount of newly released older titles, staring the late actor, gracing the shelves of my local department store.  Of course this is nothing new.  A celebrity passes away & studios generate more income for their previous work (i.e. Kurt Cobain, Michael Jackson & Heath Ledger) thus releasing everything they can in response to the recent publicity.  I suppose it's a win/win for both consumers & studios.  After all, true Corey fans can finally get their hands on a few of his obscure 80's films such as Dream A Little Dream 2 & Demolition University (which, by the way, has ""Remembering TheTeen Idol"" prominently displayed on the front cover) but I can't help but feel his death is being slightly exploited here.  I mean, just a few short months ago the License To Drive DVD was out of print, leaving fans of the movie SOL if they wanted to pick it up for a fair price.  I suppose that's show business though....Nonetheless we have License To Drive on Blu-Ray; my personal favorite Corey's movie.  By now, we consumers, know how this works.  Just because an older film is finally released on Blu-Ray it doesn't guarantee its been given the Blu-Ray treatment.  Transfers can sometimes be atrocious.  Thankfully this is not the case with License To Drive.Presented in a 1080p picture the images are strong & steady perhaps slightly soft in places but sharp for the most part.  Details are steady with strong clarity and a slight grain structure.  Facial complexions have a soft edge, but generally the texture is satisfactory.  Colors are decent, not exactly vibrant, not exactly dull, which results in an intermediate shading that works fairly well.  Darks are fine, but can't match the deepness of newer titles.  The print itself has been cleaned up removing the dust & nicks that accompanied previous releases.  Truth be told, this is probably the best License To Drive has, or ever will, look... but don't expect Mission-Impossible-Ghost-Protocol-type picture quality here.Like the picture, sound is good through the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless soundtrack, but leaves something to be desired.  Music is strong with fair clarity but solid spacing; a noticeable surround element is achieved nicely.  The action scenes toward the end of the movie have all the desructive sounds of automotive chaos; very crisp accuracy.  Certain scenes, however, sound indistinct; like a bus crashing through an alleyway early in the opening chase scene.  For the most part the sound is rewarding, but not top notch.  Still... not too shabby for a 1987 title.If anyone here is thinking of replacing their DVD version I would say yes, this is a justifiable upgrade; especially for the price.  Corey Haim will be missed by fans, but it's Blu-Ray titles like this that keep his memory alive.  Normally I would give four stars for a Blu-Ray of this quality, but considering what they had to work with & the fact that certain Corey titles have yet to even be released on DVD (Dream Machine) I'm giving it the extra star.  Like I said... this is the probably the best License To Drive will ever get.",5,"Baby, You Can Drive My Car",1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,3130,"['recent', 'loss', 'Corey', 'Haim', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'decent', 'amount', 'newly', 'released', 'older', 'titles', 'staring', 'late', 'actor', 'gracing', 'shelves', 'local', 'department', 'store', 'course', 'nothing', 'new', 'celebrity', 'away', 'studios', 'generate', 'more', 'income', 'previous', 'work', 'i.e', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'thus', 'releasing', 'everything', 'can', 'response', 'recent', 'publicity', 'suppose', 'win/win', 'consumers', 'studios', 'true', 'Corey', 'fans', 'can', 'finally', 'get', 'hands', 'few', 'obscure', '80', 'films', 'such', 'Dream', 'A', 'Little', 'Dream', '2', 'Demolition', 'University', 'way', 'Remembering', 'TheTeen', 'Idol', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'front', 'cover', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'death', 'being', 'slightly', 'exploited', 'here', 'mean', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'months', 'License', 'Drive', 'DVD', 'was', 'print', 'leaving', 'fans', 'movie', 'SOL', 'wanted', 'pick', 'up', 'fair', 'price', 'suppose', 'show', 'business', '.Nonetheless', 'have', 'License', 'Drive', 'Blu-Ray', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Corey', 'movie', 'now', 'consumers', 'know', 'how', 'Just', 'older', 'film', 'finally', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'been', 'given', 'Blu-Ray', 'treatment', 'Transfers', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'atrocious', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'case', 'License', 'Drive.Presented', '1080p', 'picture', 'images', 'are', 'strong', 'steady', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'soft', 'places', 'sharp', 'most', 'part', 'Details', 'are', 'steady', 'strong', 'clarity', 'slight', 'grain', 'structure', 'Facial', 'complexions', 'have', 'soft', 'edge', 'generally', 'texture', 'satisfactory', 'Colors', 'are', 'decent', 'not', 'exactly', 'vibrant', 'not', 'exactly', 'dull', 'results', 'intermediate', 'shading', 'fairly', 'well', 'Darks', 'are', 'fine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'deepness', 'newer', 'titles', 'print', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'removing', 'dust', 'nicks', 'accompanied', 'previous', 'releases', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'probably', 'best', 'License', 'Drive', 'ever', 'will', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Mission-Impossible-Ghost-Protocol-type', 'picture', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'good', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1', 'lossless', 'soundtrack', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Music', 'strong', 'fair', 'clarity', 'solid', 'spacing', 'noticeable', 'surround', 'element', 'achieved', 'nicely', 'action', 'end', 'movie', 'have', 'desructive', 'sounds', 'automotive', 'chaos', 'very', 'crisp', 'accuracy', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'however', 'sound', 'indistinct', 'bus', 'crashing', 'alleyway', 'early', 'opening', 'chase', 'scene', 'most', 'part', 'sound', 'rewarding', 'not', 'top', 'notch', 'Still', 'not', 'too', 'shabby', '1987', 'title.If', 'anyone', 'here', 'thinking', 'replacing', 'DVD', 'version', 'would', 'say', 'yes', 'justifiable', 'upgrade', 'especially', 'price', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'fans', 'Blu-Ray', 'titles', 'keep', 'memory', 'alive', 'Normally', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'Blu-Ray', 'quality', 'considering', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'fact', 'certain', 'Corey', 'titles', 'have', 'yet', 'even', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Dream', 'Machine', ""'m"", 'giving', 'extra', 'star', 'said', 'probably', 'best', 'License', 'Drive', 'will', 'ever', 'get']",License to Drive VHS

Corey Haim is perfect for the role along with Corey Feldman and Heather Graham. Yes, License to Drive can be tacky and too 80's yet is totally watchable and loads of fun. Richard Masur, who played the father of Les Anderson, gives the best performance of the film. The picture has tons of energy and enough laughs to make License to Drive a great comedy. License to Drive captures a significant moment of a period during a teenager's life because of what a driver's license meant to them. So, that's why License to Drive never gets aged or becomes outdated. Great lines, humorous moments, and terrific performances create License to Drive a fun film to watch.10/13: License to Drive is still a fun film to watch yet I am going to bring my rating of the film from `8' to `7'. I think now there is a small lack of fulfillment about it. The cast is good for this type of 80's comedy, and the concept is clever. Probably Richard Masur and Corey Feldman are the standouts and help to energize the film to sustain the comedy when License to Drive need it the most.

Anyone who remembers a time when all our idols were named COREY will love this trip back down memory lane. First off - great cast with Heather Graham in an early role as dream girl Mercedes Lane and Carol Kane as the pregnant mom.  It's a typical comedy, but the director provided enough style and zip to make it all work well.  The driving exam scene is classic, and there a lot of good one liners ""Who would have thought a Mercedes could fit in the trunk of a Cadillac?"".  The DVD includes a deleted sequence with an ALTERNATE CLIMAX.  The whole thing runs about 20 minutes, and shows you how the movie could have ended.

It's about a 16 year old dude named Les (Corey Haim, The Lost Boys) who wants nothing more in the world than a driver's license.  Unfortunately, he thinks he knows everything about driving and doesn't need to study for his test.  Is he right?  No way!The most beautiful girl in his school (Heather Graham, Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me) has just asked him out on a date.  There's only one problem:  He doesn't have a license!  Does that stop him?  No!  He sneaks out in the middle of the night in his grandpa's '72 Cadillac, thinking nothing can possibly go wrong.  He tries his best to keep anything from happening to it, which he finds out is almost impossible!!This movie was filmed in 1987, and released in the summer of 1988.  It also features Corey Feldman (also from the Lost Boys) and is a great comedy, and a must-see!  Unfortunately, its out of print on VHS, but hopefully it will come back, and on DVD!

He is too cool to be seen on the school bus and it's totally not cool to have your friends mom drop you off at parties. Plus, Wes has a crush on a hot blonde who just happens to be named Mercedes.The time arrives when Les finally has his opportunity to go out on a date with Mercedes--but his parents discovered that he really failed his driving test. Les has got to make it happen and he takes the car anyway. Heck, Mercedes called him and expected to see him in 20 minutes, what's a teenage boy to do? The night becomes filled with misadventures and Mercedes gets so smashed she spends part of the night in the trunk of the car. The excitement only continues when Les' mother, played by Carol Kane needs to get to the hospital.If you haven't seen this film in a while, it's just as great as it was when it was first released. The two Coreys followed up License to Drive with the movie Dream a Little Dream. Dream a Little Dream didn't have the commercial appeal as License to Drive. Although both Corey's appear on the cover, this was another film in which Corey Haim was definitly doing most of the driving considering the majority of the storyline revolved around him, his circumstance and his family, but Corey Feldman is a good sidekick as his buddy Dean.There is also some cool music featured in License to Drive. While watching the movie keep your ears peeled for ""Rush Hour,"" by Go Go's member Jane Wiedlin, ""Mercedes Boy,"" by Pebbles, ""Trouble,"" by Nia Peeples, ""I Feel Free,"" by Belinda Carlisle, and ""Get Out of My Dreams and Into My Car,"" by Billy Ocean.The DVD itself does have some cool features which makes up for the wait in having this cool film on DVD. Extra's include interviews with Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, audio commentary with director Greg Beeman and writer Neil Tolkin, deleted scene, TV spots and theatrical trailers. The DVD-Rom portion of extras include the films screenplay.The best extra's are the interviews with Corey Haim and Corey Feldman. Both actors look much better than they have in years. Corey Feldman has cut his hair since he appeared on The Surreal Life. Corey Haim has lost some weight and is sporting a spiky blond haircut. Both actors discuss how they got involved with the film, how they met and their experience of working together.

I bought this copy since it was a lower price and the Special Edition dvd is so expensive. That being said, however, the special features on this are nill. You get a theatrical trailer and that is all. But if you just want the movie with great picture and sound get this blu-ray. If you have the dvd you may want to keep it for the extras but purchase this for the upgrade.

From The Dukes of Hazzard to Knight Rider, from Max Headroom to Magnum PI. But there were two actors who's body of work pretty much sums up all that was wonderful about the 80's-- Corey Haim and Corey Feldman. License To Drive (1988) is a GREAT film that stars both the Coreys when they were in their prime. With great hair and great 'tude they made this film an unforgettable timestamp of the era. Haim plays Les Anderson who like every high school kid has two things on his mind--cars and girls. But Les doesn't have the hots for just any girl, no, he has his eye on the most beautiful girl in his high school [played by the one and only, Heather Graham.] He finally scores a date with her, but needs to get his Drivers License first. Well, this is where the real fun begins. License To Drive really has it all. It's good clean teenage fun start to finish.

270993,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,630186316X,Marty Gillis,"[1, 1]","'License to Drive' from 1988 is a nice compact and surprisingly addictive 80's teen comedy.  The ""Two Corey's"" (Haim and Feldman respectively) provide the high octane chemistry to propel this little gem into the public consciousness and  remains a cult favorite, even if it wasn't a huge hit back in the day. Throw in Richard Masur, Carol Kane and an extremely hot looking Heather Graham (hey, I was young once!) and couple it with a fast moving script and a snappy soundtrack and you've really got something!  With that said, this review will focus on the video and audio quality of this Blu Ray presentation and not the film itself.I dared to hope ""License to Drive' would look at least passable on Blu ray.  It is WAY MORE than just passable!  Presented on a BD-25 in 1080p with a 1.:85.1 aspect ratio and Dolby TruHD 5.1 non compressed sound, this film looks the very best I have ever seen it.  Let's start with print quality. Nary a speck, fleck or scratch. VERY clean.  Colors are bold and vibrant with very strong primaries. They never looks garish or over saturated and flesh tones are lush and natural.  Anchor Bay has done a great job on this.  Noise reduction is just not an issue, you can easily SEE the extreme amount of pancake on Haim and Feldman in the close ups, totally chock full of fine detail for the most part.Motion is rendered smoothly with no authoring issues I could detect. Image is also very stable and with the exception of just a small few soft shots, the contrast and clarity is spot on during the entire film. The only bad part really is the 20th Century Fox logo at the very start of the film. Don't worry, it is the only overly grainy image you are going to see for the rest of the disc.For the sake of comparison, this release puts other Blu ray titles such as 'Arthur"" , ""National Lampoons vacation' and 'Being There' to utter shame, to name just a few other 80's catalog releases.  Marty G doffs his hat at the techs that did this scan/remastering job. GREAT WORK folks!As for the audio, this is a very dialogue driven film and you GET everything nice and clear and upfront in the middle where it belongs.  Music is nicely rendered in stereo with surrounds enraged occasionally for the soundtrack and of course for car related effects such as skids, crashes, etc. Your sub will kick in when needed and overall this is just a VERY pleasant 5.1 mix for this minor 80's title. I was more than pleased with it. It is really lively and in no means a let down. Again, hats off to the remixers. VERY NICE job!As for special features, you get a very short 7 minute low def ""making of"" featurette and an SD trailer for the film. Meh! Still, I didn't buy this for special features but for good sound and picture that is what I got! Far out!If you are a fan of 80's comedies or a fan of this film, you will be VERY happy with what you get for your money here! As stated, it tromps on many big name titles in the PQ and AQ departments and if you are upgrading your DVD collection like me for a bump in quality then 'License to Drive' on Blu Ray will NOT disappoint!

These guys are a lot of fun. The movie itself still funny after all these years. Just a little note, this is the debut for lovely Heather Graham.I left out the summary for this movie as it has been described in lenghty details by other reviewers but I have to say that this DVD is a must own.

As I've been on a quest lately to recaputre my cinematic childhood, I picked this movie up remembering the 2 Corey hype and wanting to see it again with adult eyes.This movie was actually a lot of fun.  It captures an awkward time in our lives where we are desperate to break free with that just-about-to-get-my -licence feeling.  Driving means freedom and liberation, and like Corey Haim, we were eager.  As he was the one the story evolves around, in the way only an adolescent boy can, without the coveted licence and desperate for the affection of the most beautiful girl in school, he takes the car out for the night.  What could possibly go wrong?Everything, as it soon ensues.  Near brushes with death are accompanied by many bumps, scrapes and dents in the car, as well as encounters with happy, bumbling characters and his sidekick, Corey Feldman, and that nerdy friend (a well behaved Corey Feldman).  It's not the best movie on earth, no question, but we got to see a younger Heather Graham before Boogie Nights and that she's actually hotter now than then.

271006,A2JYIDH7JIG48H,630186316X,"R. Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[1, 1]","The easiest way to tell you about License To Drive is to compare it to similar movies.  It falls into that category of teen comedy adventures that includes ""16 Candles,"" ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" and ""Mystery Date.""  These films each follow the comic adventures of teens through the events of one night, each with a fun atmosphere of romance and risk.  Probably ""American Graffiti"" is the mold for these later films.  License to Drive is not as fine a film as ""Graffiti"" or even ""16 Candles,"" but still fun to watch, and for the most part suitable for the whole family (there's a bit of vulgarity, including the ""F"" word at least once).  The story concerns young Les Anderson (Corey Haim, of ""Lucas"" and ""Lost Boys""), about to apply for his driver's license.  Les's main purpose in driving is to impress the girl of his dreams, Mercedes (Heather Graham).  Some parts of the film are very funny and original, like the sequence where Les and his twin sister take their driving tests.  (One of the examiners is played by Grant Goodeve of ""Eight Is Enough."")  Also Les father's (Richard Masur) tirade near the end made me laugh.  After Les fails his test, he sneaks out anyway for an unauthorized midnight date with Mercedes and a joyride in his grandfather's cadillac.  As Les checks that his parents are asleep, he asks the audience:  ""An innocent girl, a harmless drive, what could go wrong?"" and that's what the rest of the movie's about.  The date get's falling-down drunk early, and when Les stops for help from his friend Dean (Corey Feldman), he's talked into continuing the night out with his freinds - the girl conveniently stored in the caddy's large trunk.  The bulk of the movie concerning the boys' misadventures is not hilarious, but still very entertaining due to the atmosphere of light adventure created by smooth directing (by Greg Beeman, now a producer/director for Smallville), camera-work, editing, and dead-on performances by the entire cast, which includes Carol Kane (""Taxi"") as Les's mother.  Corey Haim brings attractive energy to the role of Les; Masur and Feldman add enough realism to their characters to hold the story together.

I highly recommend it to anyone who is an 80's fan and/or a fan of the Coreys!",5,Attack of the Coreys!,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,426,"['movie', 'Coreys', 'best', 'main', 'character', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'driver', 'test', 'go', 'out', 'boys', 'anyway', 'stealing', 'parent', 'car', 'wild', 'night', 'friends', 'girl', 'love', 'whole', 'lot', 'trouble', 'fun', 'movie', 'great', 'reliving', 'classic', '80', 'know', 'miss', 'so', 'much', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', '80', 'fan', 'fan', 'Coreys']",License to Drive VHS
271018,A3373I4II32NA1,630186316X,Tyler,"[0, 1]","This movie is about a high-school kid who is convinced that getting his license to drive a car will promote the much-deserved freedom he needs, and hoping that his pregnant mom and his dad, who is charged with guarding the grandfather's 1972 Cadillac, will buy him a BMW with the arrival of his license in order to impress the prettiest girl at school, Mercedes, who just got plans for their ""first date.""Except that the kid fails miserably on his written test. Due to a computer malfunction, he is allowed to take his driver's test, which he manages to pass with flying colors, but he only gets a glimpse of his newly-printed license before the truth of his test scores is revealed and the license is ripped up in front of his disbelieving eyes. Determined to take the test again after the weekend, he leads his parents on with the understanding that he passed his test until then, but they find out pretty quickly about the truth and ground him as a punishment.Remembering his date with Mercedes, he sneaks out of the house while his parents are asleep and even takes the grandfather's Cadillac, which only has 20,000 miles on the odometer and is in great shape. The date doesn't quite go as expected, since the car is towed, he has to bribe the tow-truck driver with $80 to let his car go, and Mercedes gets drunk and passes out shortly afterwards. So he invites his friends with him for a night on the town, and each encounter they go through ends up with the car getting more scratched and banged up than before, even with a drunk driver stealing the Cadillac, as he thinks it's HIS car, and gives the car a lot of body damage before the guys recover it.By morning, the car looks like a shattered wreck, and the father is infuriated by the result. But the mom happens to go into labor on the spot, requiring him to drive the parents to the hospital with a bad transmission that only works in Reverse. Everything works out in the end, even with the Cadillac being pancaked by a falling beam at a construction site, because the grandfather happens to return the father's BMW from his trip literally in the same condition as his Cadillac, and the kid, Les, still gets his girl in the end. This movie was completely hilarious and would be 10 stars if it allowed more than 5.",5,Very hilarious!,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,2275,"['movie', 'high-school', 'kid', 'who', 'convinced', 'getting', 'license', 'drive', 'car', 'will', 'promote', 'much-deserved', 'freedom', 'hoping', 'pregnant', 'mom', 'dad', 'who', 'charged', 'guarding', 'grandfather', '1972', 'Cadillac', 'will', 'buy', 'BMW', 'arrival', 'license', 'order', 'impress', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'school', 'Mercedes', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'plans', 'first', 'date', 'kid', 'miserably', 'written', 'test', 'Due', 'computer', 'malfunction', 'allowed', 'take', 'driver', 'test', 'pass', 'flying', 'colors', 'only', 'glimpse', 'newly-printed', 'license', 'truth', 'test', 'scores', 'revealed', 'license', 'ripped', 'up', 'front', 'disbelieving', 'eyes', 'Determined', 'take', 'test', 'again', 'weekend', 'parents', 'understanding', 'passed', 'test', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'truth', 'ground', 'punishment.Remembering', 'date', 'Mercedes', 'house', 'parents', 'are', 'asleep', 'even', 'grandfather', 'Cadillac', 'only', '20,000', 'miles', 'odometer', 'great', 'shape', 'date', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'expected', 'car', 'towed', 'bribe', 'tow-truck', 'driver', '80', 'let', 'car', 'go', 'Mercedes', 'drunk', 'out', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'friends', 'night', 'town', 'encounter', 'go', 'ends', 'up', 'car', 'getting', 'more', 'scratched', 'banged', 'up', 'before', 'even', 'drunk', 'driver', 'stealing', 'Cadillac', 'HIS', 'car', 'car', 'lot', 'body', 'damage', 'guys', 'recover', 'it.By', 'morning', 'car', 'shattered', 'wreck', 'father', 'infuriated', 'result', 'mom', 'go', 'labor', 'spot', 'requiring', 'drive', 'parents', 'hospital', 'bad', 'transmission', 'only', 'Reverse', 'Everything', 'out', 'end', 'even', 'Cadillac', 'being', 'pancaked', 'falling', 'beam', 'construction', 'site', 'grandfather', 'return', 'father', 'BMW', 'trip', 'literally', 'same', 'condition', 'Cadillac', 'kid', 'Les', 'still', 'girl', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'completely', 'hilarious', 'would', 'be', '10', 'stars', 'allowed', 'more', '5']",License to Drive VHS

Things never went right for me on those nights and the Corey's are no acception.
