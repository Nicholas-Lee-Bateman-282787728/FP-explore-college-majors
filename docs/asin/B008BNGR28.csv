Found myself captivated by the whole story and the actors portrayed these characters in a very convincing way. Eric Roberts as Bill Bonanno was very appealing  and  convincing.

It's amazing that they eventually stayed together and seemed to be still in love over many years.",4,Entertaining story,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,522,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'quite', 'what', 'expect', 'title', 'Found', 'captivated', 'whole', 'story', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'very', 'convincing', 'way', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Bill', 'Bonanno', 'was', 'very', 'appealing', 'convincing', 'always', 'managed', 'seduce', 'Rosalie', 'played', 'Nancy', 'McKeon-', 'young', 'innocent', 'wife', 'who', 'eventually', 'strength', 'make', 'life', 'own', 'support', 'family', 'amazing', 'eventually', 'stayed', 'together', 'seemed', 'be', 'still', 'love', 'many', 'years']",N/A
