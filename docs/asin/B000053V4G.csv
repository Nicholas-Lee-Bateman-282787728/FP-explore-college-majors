565001,A3LKP6WPMP9UKX,B000053V4G,Anna V. Carroll,"[2, 2]","This film was made in late fall 1993, high in the mountains of Utah. I know this because I was there with Chief Ted Thin Elk, a full-blood Sicangu Brule Lakota from South Dakota. His first film was Thunderheart starring Val Kilmer.This movie was made by a Mormon film studio. John Denver kept to himself, but had a private concert at the end of filming. He and Chief Thin Elk died the same year: 1997.  John was in his early 50's and Ted in his late 70's. The few times we shared the same car up to the site, John Denver was just how you think he would be.  Just a nice, average, regular guy.  He talked about his daughter Jesse and I talked about my daughter Jessie.  She was his whole world.One of the 'Indian' actors turned out to be Japanese! We found this very amusing. However, it shouldn't have been as many American Indians originated in Asia. Many of the Lakota elders looked very much like the Tibetan actors in Kundun.This was Ted's last film as he had recently suffered a heart attack before going to Utah to make the film. He made two films back-to-back that fall. We flew to Texas so he could film the final installment of North & South. He loved San Antonio, as did I. And we both fell in love with Utah and the beautiful mountains there.  South Dakota, where he was born and remained his entire life, is flat and grassy. Of course we spent time in the Black Hills (Paha Sapa) but they were a few hours drive from where we lived.As film shoots go, this was a very casual, laid-back setting.  No egos, no diva fits. Everyone got along well. There was a rush to finish the film before the roads to and from the mountain (Mt. Timpanogos) were closed due to ice and snow. The day after we left the site and returned to Sandy, Utah, the snow and ice began. Perfect timing. While on the mountain, Moose, Deer, Beavers and other forest animals would wander near the set to take a look at what was going on.In one scene, when Ted is praying in Lakota, the hills echoed with sounds of wolves howling! Everyone froze. The Park Ranger who was there said he had not heard these sounds in years.  They must have felt the Lakota prayers and answered in their own way.  This was filmed but I don't know if it made it to the final cut or not.  If so, when you hear the howling it is real.  It was a truly magical moment.  I took numerous photographs during the filming and have them on the walls of my NYC apartment.I wish there were more family films like this.  I buy Shirley Temple movies for my grand daughter to watch. When she is older I will show her this one and tell her all about what happened behind-the-scenes that lovely fall in Utah.",4,WHOLESOME FAMILY FILM,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,2646,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'late', 'fall', '1993', 'high', 'mountains', 'Utah', 'know', 'was', 'there', 'Chief', 'Ted', 'Thin', 'Elk', 'full-blood', 'Sicangu', 'Brule', 'Lakota', 'South', 'Dakota', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'Thunderheart', 'starring', 'Val', 'Kilmer.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Mormon', 'film', 'studio', 'John', 'Denver', 'kept', 'had', 'private', 'concert', 'end', 'filming', 'Chief', 'Thin', 'Elk', 'died', 'same', 'year', '1997', 'John', 'was', 'early', '50', 'Ted', 'late', '70', 'few', 'times', 'shared', 'same', 'car', 'up', 'site', 'John', 'Denver', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'Just', 'nice', 'average', 'regular', 'guy', 'talked', 'daughter', 'Jesse', 'talked', 'daughter', 'Jessie', 'was', 'whole', 'world.One', ""'Indian"", 'actors', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Japanese', 'found', 'very', 'amusing', 'However', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'as', 'many', 'American', 'Indians', 'originated', 'Asia', 'Many', 'Lakota', 'elders', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'Tibetan', 'actors', 'Kundun.This', 'was', 'Ted', 'last', 'film', 'had', 'recently', 'suffered', 'heart', 'attack', 'going', 'Utah', 'make', 'film', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'back-to-back', 'fall', 'flew', 'Texas', 'could', 'film', 'final', 'installment', 'North', 'South', 'loved', 'San', 'Antonio', 'did', 'fell', 'love', 'Utah', 'beautiful', 'mountains', 'there', 'South', 'Dakota', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'remained', 'entire', 'life', 'flat', 'grassy', 'course', 'spent', 'time', 'Black', 'Hills', 'Paha', 'Sapa', 'were', 'few', 'hours', 'drive', 'where', 'lived.As', 'film', 'shoots', 'go', 'was', 'very', 'casual', 'laid-back', 'setting', 'egos', 'diva', 'Everyone', 'got', 'along', 'well', 'was', 'rush', 'finish', 'film', 'roads', 'mountain', 'Mt', 'Timpanogos', 'were', 'closed', 'due', 'ice', 'snow', 'day', 'left', 'site', 'returned', 'Sandy', 'Utah', 'snow', 'ice', 'began', 'Perfect', 'timing', 'mountain', 'Moose', 'Deer', 'Beavers', 'other', 'forest', 'animals', 'would', 'wander', 'set', 'take', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.In', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Ted', 'praying', 'Lakota', 'hills', 'echoed', 'sounds', 'wolves', 'howling', 'Everyone', 'froze', 'Park', 'Ranger', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'said', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'sounds', 'years', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'Lakota', 'prayers', 'answered', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'not', 'so', 'when', 'hear', 'howling', 'real', 'was', 'truly', 'magical', 'moment', 'took', 'numerous', 'photographs', 'filming', 'have', 'walls', 'NYC', 'apartment.I', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'family', 'films', 'buy', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movies', 'grand', 'daughter', 'watch', 'When', 'older', 'will', 'show', 'one', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'behind-the-scenes', 'lovely', 'fall', 'Utah']",N/A
565002,A22XHZ3MFP6MSV,B000053V4G,Cranky Reviewer,"[7, 11]","I was hoping to show some Bart the Bear features publicly to local kids, and had to reject this movie due to potentially offensive material. Probably accurate to the times, but I know that some people would consider the use of the term 'Redskin' to be offensive, as well as little brother's comments that big brother, late returning home, might have been scalped. On the other hand, I think the film did make it clear that it was white Indian hunters who were doing most of the scalping.  The main Indian character is an old Sioux medicine man who speaks no English, but can communicate with the giant bear.  Less offensive, but still a bit of a stereotype.Apart from that, the film was a fairly enjoyable wilderness picture, though not containing anything really exceptional apart from big ol' Bart. And it's nice that it didn't end with the kid having to hunt down the bear, as I first assumed when I read the film description.",3,"Maybe not for Indian kids, anyway...",1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,929,"['was', 'hoping', 'show', 'Bart', 'Bear', 'publicly', 'local', 'kids', 'had', 'reject', 'movie', 'due', 'potentially', 'offensive', 'material', 'Probably', 'accurate', 'times', 'know', 'people', 'would', 'consider', 'use', 'term', ""'Redskin"", 'be', 'offensive', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'brother', 'comments', 'big', 'brother', 'late', 'returning', 'home', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'scalped', 'other', 'hand', 'think', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'clear', 'was', 'white', 'Indian', 'hunters', 'who', 'were', 'doing', 'most', 'scalping', 'main', 'Indian', 'character', 'old', 'Sioux', 'medicine', 'man', 'who', 'English', 'can', 'communicate', 'giant', 'bear', 'Less', 'offensive', 'still', 'bit', 'stereotype.Apart', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'wilderness', 'picture', 'not', 'containing', 'anything', 'really', 'exceptional', 'apart', 'big', 'ol', 'Bart', 'nice', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'kid', 'having', 'hunt', 'down', 'bear', 'first', 'assumed', 'when', 'read', 'film', 'description']",N/A
565003,A2V62ETXCADXU6,B000053V4G,"Henry Smiley ""cade's dad""","[7, 12]","&quot;Walking Thunder&quot; is a well-meaning, occasionally entertaining movie about a New England family's efforts to survive in the West after their wagon is demolished by a huge grizzly.  The problem is that the movie, while clearly targeted at families, is at times disturbingly violent.  The scenery is beautiful (shot on location in Utah), the costumes are authentic, but the performances are wooden and everything about the movie screams low budget.  Many John Denver fans will purchase this movie for historical or sentimental value since it was his last film project.  However, he displays little of the charm that he displayed in his debut, &quot;Oh, God!&quot;  If you watch this movie, watch it for the heartfelt performance of Klara Irene Miracle as Denver's long-suffering wife or the quiet dignity of Chief Ted Thin Elk.  The DVD features a host of extras;  unfortunately, they range from disappointing (the director's commentary sounds like it was recorded on a tapedeck) to embarrassing (the amateurish &quot;music video&quot; featuring the unknown &quot;Fresh&quot;--does the world really need another boy band?).
