I think the director just wanted to use the clip, because at the time it was unreleased and is shot very nice from D A Pinnebaker.But its an extra song so WHO cares.  It just messes with the flow of the movie, other than that, its fast paced, packed with Full length performances (there is one ""medley"" section though).  It shows the amazing video from 1968's Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus ""A Quick One"" Many of the interviews are quit humerious.Just a great documentry of the WHO era with Keith Moon.I actauuly thought of making a second volume of material and videos from 1980-present in the same style and format called ""The Kids are still alight"", but maybe someone will do it for me someday.Enjoy the Film!",5,"if you own just one Who DVD, make it THIS ONE !",1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,1118,"['1979', 'Documentry', 'done', 'old', 'fashion', 'way', 'let', 'music', 'clips', 'do', 'talking', 'narrator', 'lost', 'art', 'form', 'today', 'standard.The', 'film', 'very', 'nicely', 'song', 'interview', 'back', 'song', 'ect.I', 'think', 'film', '10', 'ONLY', 'gripe', 'film', 'Generation', 'then', 'nicely', 'Who', 'Afre', 'then', 'reason', 'Generation', 'Monterey', 'think', 'director', 'just', 'wanted', 'use', 'clip', 'time', 'was', 'unreleased', 'shot', 'very', 'nice', 'D', 'A', 'Pinnebaker.But', 'extra', 'song', 'so', 'WHO', 'cares', 'just', 'flow', 'movie', 'other', 'fast', 'paced', 'packed', 'Full', 'length', 'performances', 'one', 'medley', 'section', 'amazing', 'video', '1968', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Circus', 'A', 'Quick', 'One', 'Many', 'interviews', 'are', 'quit', 'humerious.Just', 'great', 'documentry', 'WHO', 'era', 'Keith', 'Moon.I', 'actauuly', 'thought', 'making', 'second', 'volume', 'material', 'videos', '1980-present', 'same', 'style', 'format', 'called', 'Kids', 'are', 'still', 'alight', 'maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'do', 'someday.Enjoy', 'Film']",N/A

489395,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B000000T01,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[2, 2]","""The Kids Are Alright,"" starring John Entwistle, Roger Daltrey, Keith Moon, and Pete Townshend, aka The Who, came out just after I finished 11th grade, the Summer of 1979, when everyone was still kind of raw over the loss of Keith Moon, but it was still several years before I got to see it. It played on the big screen in Pittsburgh's Stanley Theater, in a double feature, the opening film being George Harrison's ""Concert For Bangla Desh,"" another really fine film.This version of the release returns  it to its original theatrical release, several segments long missing are restored, and the sound and picture quality are refurbished as well. For years, it was only available on VHS, and with no other option, it had to suffice. But, seeing it in this version again, it is astonishing, how much the video tape suffers in comarison. The picture is now razor sharp, the sound is once again full, and the experience is what it should've been all along.Even if Keith Moon had lived longer, the main point to properly enjoying this movie, is to ALWAYS watch him; never take your eyes off him. Of course, the whole band is in fine form all the way through, but truthfully, Moon is the undisputed star of the film. Along with Pete Townshend, he is up there with any of the great comedians in TV and movie history. Of course, he is a drummer first and foremost, and especially in the older concert clips, he is just astonishing to watch. He wasn't often very technical, but when he cuts loose, you'll never see anyone like him. Of course, the whole band is is in top form throughout, don't put anything past them. Townshend, John Entwistle and Roger Daltrey are often at their best here as well.And somehow, even the material that is flawed, is still priceless to watch. There is a clip of them playing ""Barbara Ann,"" the old Beach Boys song, Moon doing the falsetto, and yes, it is atrocious. But somehow, this doesn't matter, it is a perfect picture of the camaraderie they had with one another. Four aggressive men who were often at one another's throats, still managed to pull off a career unlike any other, I feel they were unique here. But despite all the infighting, especially in the Russel Harty interview segments, you see a true brotherhood among them. They genuinely loved one another, and this becomes obvious in the earliest post-Moon years, when Townshend's anger at Moon dying manifested itself in a series of unflattering haircuts, public socio-political rants which nobody really wanted to hear, and the abuse of very dangerous, hard drugs. He began using cocaine, and even experimented with heroin. He nearly joined Moon one night when he was found passed out in a public men's room, and by the time he was placed in the back seat of his car, he had turned blue. Rehab followed, and virtually every essay he composed after this included some reference to Keith Moon, one of his dearest friends, being dead. He wrote what some call an ""arrogant"" introduction in the ""30 Years Of Maximun R&B;"" box set, but this many years later, he is obviously still sad, and very angry at Moon for leaving us so soon.In 2002, just before a new tour, John Entwistle joined Moon as well, found dead in a hotel room on the eve of the tour's first date. And as talented as they are, Pino Palladino and Zak Starkey are not Entwistle and Moon. To see them now, it is still a great band, worth going to see, but seeing ""The Kids Are Alright,""  or the current line-up of The Who fills one with great sadness, not only at a world without Entwistle or Moon, but the entertainment today in general. Watch the Shepperton clips of The Who, circa 1978, playing ""Baba O'Riley,"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again."" Here you have four thirty-something, grown men, putting on an excellent rock show, and doing it with such aplomb, no fan wanted it to end. Now, cut to today. Turn on your TV, and you see the latest exploits of people like Brittany Spears, headed for a brick wall quicker than Moon ever did, and not very gracefully, at that. And even in his final days, Elvis Presley could wow an audience. This is what makes ""The Kids Are Alright"" such a treasure. It is the epitome of the heyday of rock.",5,"The best rock movie ever, has gotten better",1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,4180,"['Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'starring', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'Who', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'finished', '11th', 'grade', 'Summer', '1979', 'when', 'everyone', 'was', 'still', 'kind', 'raw', 'loss', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'was', 'still', 'several', 'years', 'got', 'see', 'played', 'big', 'screen', 'Pittsburgh', 'Stanley', 'Theater', 'double', 'feature', 'opening', 'film', 'being', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Concert', 'Bangla', 'Desh', 'really', 'fine', 'film.This', 'version', 'release', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'several', 'segments', 'long', 'missing', 'are', 'restored', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'refurbished', 'well', 'years', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'other', 'option', 'had', 'suffice', 'seeing', 'version', 'again', 'astonishing', 'how', 'much', 'video', 'tape', 'suffers', 'comarison', 'picture', 'now', 'razor', 'sharp', 'sound', 'once', 'again', 'full', 'experience', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'along.Even', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'had', 'lived', 'longer', 'main', 'point', 'properly', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'ALWAYS', 'watch', 'never', 'take', 'eyes', 'course', 'whole', 'band', 'fine', 'form', 'way', 'truthfully', 'Moon', 'undisputed', 'star', 'film', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'there', 'great', 'comedians', 'TV', 'movie', 'history', 'course', 'drummer', 'first', 'foremost', 'especially', 'older', 'concert', 'clips', 'just', 'astonishing', 'watch', 'was', ""n't"", 'often', 'very', 'technical', 'when', 'loose', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'anyone', 'course', 'whole', 'band', 'top', 'form', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'anything', 'Townshend', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'are', 'often', 'best', 'here', 'well.And', 'somehow', 'even', 'material', 'flawed', 'still', 'priceless', 'watch', 'clip', 'playing', 'Barbara', 'Ann', 'old', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'song', 'Moon', 'doing', 'falsetto', 'yes', 'atrocious', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'matter', 'perfect', 'picture', 'camaraderie', 'had', 'one', 'Four', 'aggressive', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'often', 'one', 'throats', 'still', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'career', 'other', 'feel', 'were', 'unique', 'here', 'infighting', 'especially', 'Russel', 'Harty', 'interview', 'segments', 'see', 'true', 'brotherhood', 'genuinely', 'loved', 'one', 'obvious', 'earliest', 'post-Moon', 'years', 'when', 'Townshend', 'anger', 'Moon', 'dying', 'manifested', 'series', 'unflattering', 'haircuts', 'public', 'socio-political', 'rants', 'nobody', 'really', 'wanted', 'hear', 'abuse', 'very', 'dangerous', 'hard', 'drugs', 'began', 'using', 'cocaine', 'even', 'experimented', 'heroin', 'nearly', 'joined', 'Moon', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'was', 'found', 'passed', 'out', 'public', 'men', 'room', 'time', 'was', 'placed', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'had', 'turned', 'blue', 'Rehab', 'followed', 'virtually', 'essay', 'composed', 'included', 'reference', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'one', 'dearest', 'friends', 'being', 'dead', 'wrote', 'what', 'call', 'arrogant', 'introduction', '30', 'Years', 'Maximun', 'R', 'B', 'box', 'set', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'obviously', 'still', 'sad', 'very', 'angry', 'Moon', 'leaving', 'so', 'soon.In', '2002', 'just', 'new', 'tour', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'joined', 'Moon', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'dead', 'hotel', 'room', 'eve', 'tour', 'first', 'date', 'as', 'talented', 'are', 'Pino', 'Palladino', 'Zak', 'Starkey', 'are', 'not', 'Entwistle', 'Moon', 'see', 'now', 'still', 'great', 'band', 'worth', 'going', 'see', 'seeing', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'current', 'line-up', 'Who', 'one', 'great', 'sadness', 'not', 'only', 'world', 'Entwistle', 'Moon', 'entertainment', 'today', 'general', 'Watch', 'Shepperton', 'clips', 'Who', 'circa', '1978', 'playing', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'Here', 'have', 'four', 'thirty-something', 'grown', 'men', 'putting', 'excellent', 'rock', 'show', 'doing', 'such', 'aplomb', 'fan', 'wanted', 'end', 'Now', 'cut', 'today', 'Turn', 'TV', 'see', 'latest', 'exploits', 'people', 'Brittany', 'Spears', 'headed', 'brick', 'wall', 'quicker', 'Moon', 'ever', 'did', 'not', 'very', 'gracefully', 'even', 'final', 'days', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'could', 'wow', 'audience', 'what', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'such', 'treasure', 'epitome', 'heyday', 'rock']",N/A

I'm buying this as soon as I finish this review, and since I've seen the crux of this rockumentary already, coupled with having read all the reviews, I can say in advance, that The Who were not only the greatest band to come out of the sixties and/or seventies, but also the most underrated.  Their music had meaning and ferocity long before punk came along and declared that there was no other way.  They were the first punk band (and ""the FIRST band to vomit in the bar""), and even The Clash (during their prime) covered The Who.  One of the best things about The Who is that, tribute bands aside, no one sounds like them.  Plenty sound like The Beatles or The Rolling Stones or (insert band of choice here), but The Who were/are unique, and no one did what they did the way they did it.  Keith Moon was a madman, unlike anyone else, before or since.  His style of back to front playing (a phrase I read John Entwistle use once) stands alone among rock drummers, and though he did deteriorate, he lived on his own terms, without apologies or remorse.  Entwistle was/is GOD among bass players.  I'm a bass player myself, and his playing never ceases to amaze me.  He played lead while Townshend played rhythm, unheard of for a rock band (esp. back then).  As for Townshend, what else can be said???  I love him for the power he brought to his live performances, and for his simple yet powerful and melodic playing.  His songs are still under-appreciated, touching on themes of gender identity, masturbation, alienation, angst, anger, political commentary, and more, long before it became fashionable or acceptable.  He wasn't Dylan, but Dylan never smashed a guitar onstage and told everyone to ""FU#$ OFF!"" now did he???  As for Roger Daltrey, he might be the MOST under-appreciated of The Who.  In his prime, he had more power, presence, range, and feeling than Lennon, McCartney, Jagger, et al. combined.  AND, HE DID IT WITH SONGS HE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE!!!  He brought life to Pete's songs that Pete's voice could not.  Props to Pete for recognizing that early on...  I know I'll love this DVD, even before actually watching it.  Finally, I think it's a shame that Pete and Roger continue to tour.  Going on without Keith was bad enough, but touring as 'The Who' without John is insulting.  It's not The Who without Keith and John, so the reviewer who said they've become their own tribute band is not that far off.  However, that said, what they accomplished in their prime can't be changed (Thank God!), so their legacy (of what they did in their prime) is intact, no matter what.  Personally, I don't want to see them performing at 60 and beyond--it's not what rock and roll is about.  Truth be told, them performing in their 40s and 50s is almost as absurd.  Kurt Cobain once said that he thought it was ridiculous for them (Roger, Pete, and John) to tour in their 40s-that they couldn't possibly do what they did when they were in their 20s.  13 years after Kurt said that, I have to say I agree.  On the other hand, what the hell else would they do???  Be rust repairers???",5,I taped this off TV in 1990 and...,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,3161,"['wondered', 'would', 'EVER', 'get', 'DVD', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'more', ""'m"", 'buying', 'as', 'soon', 'finish', 'review', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'crux', 'rockumentary', 'already', 'coupled', 'having', 'read', 'reviews', 'can', 'say', 'advance', 'Who', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'greatest', 'band', 'come', 'sixties', 'and/or', 'seventies', 'also', 'most', 'underrated', 'music', 'had', 'meaning', 'ferocity', 'long', 'before', 'punk', 'came', 'along', 'declared', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'were', 'first', 'punk', 'band', 'FIRST', 'band', 'vomit', 'bar', 'even', 'Clash', 'prime', 'covered', 'Who', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'Who', 'tribute', 'bands', 'aside', 'one', 'Plenty', 'sound', 'Beatles', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'insert', 'band', 'choice', 'here', 'Who', 'were/are', 'unique', 'one', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'way', 'did', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'was', 'madman', 'anyone', 'else', 'style', 'back', 'front', 'playing', 'phrase', 'read', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'use', 'once', 'alone', 'rock', 'drummers', 'did', 'deteriorate', 'lived', 'own', 'terms', 'apologies', 'remorse', 'Entwistle', 'was/is', 'GOD', 'bass', 'players', ""'m"", 'bass', 'player', 'playing', 'never', 'amaze', 'played', 'lead', 'Townshend', 'played', 'rhythm', 'unheard', 'rock', 'band', 'esp', 'back', 'then', 'Townshend', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'love', 'power', 'brought', 'live', 'performances', 'simple', 'yet', 'powerful', 'melodic', 'playing', 'songs', 'are', 'still', 'under-appreciated', 'touching', 'themes', 'gender', 'identity', 'masturbation', 'alienation', 'angst', 'anger', 'political', 'commentary', 'more', 'long', 'became', 'fashionable', 'acceptable', 'was', ""n't"", 'Dylan', 'Dylan', 'never', 'smashed', 'guitar', 'onstage', 'told', 'everyone', 'FU', 'now', 'did', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'might', 'be', 'MOST', 'under-appreciated', 'Who', 'prime', 'had', 'more', 'power', 'presence', 'range', 'feeling', 'Lennon', 'McCartney', 'Jagger', 'et', 'al', 'combined', 'HE', 'IT', 'WITH', 'SONGS', 'HE', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'EVEN', 'WRITE', 'brought', 'life', 'Pete', 'songs', 'Pete', 'voice', 'could', 'not', 'Props', 'Pete', 'recognizing', 'early', 'know', ""'ll"", 'love', 'DVD', 'even', 'actually', 'watching', 'Finally', 'think', 'shame', 'Pete', 'Roger', 'continue', 'tour', 'Going', 'Keith', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'touring', ""'The"", 'Who', 'John', 'insulting', 'not', 'Who', 'Keith', 'John', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', ""'ve"", 'become', 'own', 'tribute', 'band', 'not', 'far', 'off', 'However', 'said', 'what', 'accomplished', 'prime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'changed', 'Thank', 'God', 'so', 'legacy', 'what', 'did', 'prime', 'intact', 'matter', 'what', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'performing', '60', 'not', 'what', 'rock', 'roll', 'about', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'performing', '40s', '50s', 'almost', 'absurd', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'once', 'said', 'thought', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'Roger', 'Pete', 'John', 'tour', '40s-that', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'when', 'were', '20s', '13', 'years', 'Kurt', 'said', 'have', 'say', 'agree', 'other', 'hand', 'what', 'hell', 'else', 'would', 'do', 'Be', 'rust', 'repairers']",N/A

Great lyrics, great melodies, great musicianship (Entwistle is/was the greatest bassist ever!).To the reviewer below who quotes Kurt Cobain slandering The Who back in the 1990s: Who gives a rip what Cobain said about The Who? Nirvanna is the most overrated band in rock history, and didn't achieve what The Who did. Cobain was just filled with jealousy and envy that The Who are usually considered by society as being in the top 3 or 4 bands of all time. All Nirvanna did was be the first Seattle grunge band to have a hit single on MTV. So Cobain helped kill hair metal, big deal. That doesn't make them worthy to stand alongside The Who, no matter what the (young) big media says today. Say all you want about the post-Moon Who, but the band in 2000, still with Entwistle, was incredible! Nirvanna is just crappy music, crappy guitar solos, crappy singing. Boring.

489403,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B000000T01,Brian J Hay,"[0, 0]","Whatever the hell it is the Who play, it isn't rock. It's not. The musical tapestry spanned in Townshend's song writing is far too broad and varied to pigeonhole it with a genre label. His father played the music of his time. Townshend himself fell in love with the R&amp;B singles that made their way to Britain from America. His mentor, Kit Lambert loved pop but also carried the influence of his father, Constant Lambert, a composer who worked in film and theatre. Lambert also loved the Baroque and Classical styles, all of which he passed on to Townshend. Townshend has his own ideas. All of it shows. This is not music of any one genre-it's a genre unto itself. But, when the Who plays it, it becomes rock.When they play it on stage it becomes the greatest and most powerful rock music imaginable.It was no surprise (not to Who fans anyway) that their DVD release from the fall 2000 show at the Royal Albert Hall was one of the most celebrated concert videos from that year. The band was firing on all cylinders on the 2000 tour and played at a level closer to what they achieved during their glory years than they'd ever managed since Keith Moon died. That alone was enough to put then back at the forefront.The &quot;Kids are Alright&quot; shows what it was like in the first place.It was the oddest of musical relationships. With the exception of the friendship between Moon and Entwistle none of them really liked each other, at least not in the early days anyway. Townshend's temper was enough to keep anyone away and everyone hated Roger. It reached a head in 1965 when they tossed Roger out for beating up Moon only to realize (to a man) that they were throwing away something that might go beyond anything any of them could imagine. It was their Waterloo and it happened before any of them passed twenty-one.It produced greatness.The Who had what it took to go places, always; everyone in the fold knew that. When they made that commitment they took it beyond what anyone could have dreamt. Throughout their (active recording) career they never followed a formula,  never stopped pushing musical boundaries, and, in concert, always tried to do better than &quot;last night&quot;. They became the most astonishing rock band ever to step on the stage.This film concentrates on showing that.It doesn't preach. There's no narration going through historic details. There's not even a chronological order to the piece. All it does is try to show the Who, and the ingredients that formed their magic to the world. The live footage is electrifying. The interviews are illuminating and hilarious. How could anyone (or anything) contain Keith Moon? How could an interviewer ever hope to step into the middle of the way the core group constantly challenged each other? They couldn't. This was four strong personalities merged into something larger than life. Their relationship wasn't harmonious but an outsider stepping into it found found themselves confronted with, the whole. When they stepped onstage that &quot;whole&quot; was what audiences got. Jeff Stein has been criticized for just &quot;putting what was around&quot; together. That's crap. Jeff Stein is a brilliant film maker who had the sense to let his subjects speak for themselves. That shows all the way through the film. You get the music, a sense of who the band are and a great sample of why their performances are the stuff of legend.How much more is needed? Get it.",5,Get it now!

I immediately bought an Army parka and became an annoyingly avid Who fan, and for weeks watched ""The Kids Are Alright"" over and over and over and over....My girlfriend at the time sat down for about 10 minutes of it and shook her head in amazement. ""Man, they're ugly,"" she said. ""I can't even decide which one is the ugliest.""On another occasion, my sister passed through the TV room as The Who performed ""Baba O'Riley""; she stopped, seemingly transfixed by Pete Townshend's windmill guitar slashes and Roger Daltrey's microphone-cord rope tricks, then announced, ""They... look so ridiculous.""Both opinions seemed beside the point to me, and I couldn't really argue: The Who isn't exactly pretty, and I preferred the term ""theatrical"" to ""ridiculous,"" but then again, this is a band that built its early popularity around the fact that they smashed their instruments after each show and detonated bombs onstage. This is why they're primarily a boys' band. Plus, they played great, thundering songs about spiders and pinball and deodorant and angst. How could a 16-year-old kid not love that?""The Kids Are Alright"" perfectly conveys all the bombast of the band and the beauty of the music. Director Stein was barely out of his teens himself when he somehow badgered the band into letting him make the film. For three years, he scoured up hours of live footage of the group (mostly culled from European TV appearances) and, against all expectations, assembled one of the best rock movies ever - it's a not-always-flattering but consistently grin-inducing piece of music history.The movie has been released on a remastered two-disc DVD that looks and sounds great. Extra features include a segment that focuses on the late John Entwistle's supremely nimble bass playing (by selecting different audio channels, you can hear two songs with or without the other instruments); featurettes on the restoration process; a funny commentary by Stein; and a trippy new video for the song ""Who Are You.""",5,"The kids are better than alright; an excellent, much-needed upgrade of a classic rock film!",1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,2245,"['was', '16', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'stumbled', 'airing', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'late-night', 'TV.Before', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Who', 'Jeff', 'Stein', 'groundbreaking', 'documentary', 'band', 'struck', 'fast', 'ride', 'rickety', 'rollercoaster', 'immediately', 'bought', 'Army', 'parka', 'became', 'annoyingly', 'avid', 'Who', 'fan', 'weeks', 'watched', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', '.My', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'sat', 'down', '10', 'minutes', 'shook', 'head', 'amazement', 'Man', ""'re"", 'ugly', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'decide', 'one', 'ugliest', 'occasion', 'sister', 'passed', 'TV', 'room', 'Who', 'performed', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", 'stopped', 'seemingly', 'transfixed', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'windmill', 'guitar', 'slashes', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'microphone-cord', 'rope', 'tricks', 'then', 'announced', 'look', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'opinions', 'seemed', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'argue', 'Who', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'pretty', 'preferred', 'term', 'theatrical', 'ridiculous', 'then', 'again', 'band', 'built', 'early', 'popularity', 'fact', 'smashed', 'instruments', 'show', 'detonated', 'bombs', 'onstage', 'why', ""'re"", 'primarily', 'boys', 'band', 'played', 'great', 'thundering', 'songs', 'spiders', 'pinball', 'deodorant', 'angst', 'How', 'could', '16-year-old', 'kid', 'not', 'love', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'perfectly', 'bombast', 'band', 'beauty', 'music', 'Director', 'Stein', 'was', 'barely', 'teens', 'when', 'somehow', 'badgered', 'band', 'letting', 'make', 'film', 'three', 'years', 'scoured', 'up', 'hours', 'live', 'footage', 'group', 'mostly', 'culled', 'European', 'TV', 'appearances', 'expectations', 'assembled', 'one', 'best', 'rock', 'movies', 'ever', 'not-always-flattering', 'consistently', 'grin-inducing', 'piece', 'music', 'history.The', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'remastered', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'great', 'Extra', 'features', 'include', 'segment', 'late', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'supremely', 'nimble', 'bass', 'playing', 'selecting', 'different', 'audio', 'channels', 'can', 'hear', 'two', 'songs', 'other', 'instruments', 'restoration', 'process', 'funny', 'commentary', 'Stein', 'trippy', 'new', 'video', 'song', 'Who', 'Are']",N/A

Devin,"[7, 7]","In their glory days no band delivered a more explosive live show than the Who, and the members of the band have always felt that their studio albums never quite captured that astonishing energy.  Well, this re-mastered version of this classic rock movie captures it just fine.  The producers of this re-release did a lot of work finding old film and tape and making it all look and sound better than ever before, they deserve our thanks for putting so much effort into this.  The results make the Who jump right through your TV-audio system.  I've seen much of this footage before on other releases, it has never looked as sharp and rich, or sounded so powerful, they really did a fantastic job.  The special edition is worth a few bucks extra as it comes with a second DVD with extra features.  Hardcore Who fans have their little gripes, even more rare footage would have been nice etc., but the complaints pale beside the quality of this release, which shows just how good these old rock films can be made if somebody puts enough effort into them.  It's an erratic film, it jumps all over, sort of like the band, but it's a time capsule of one of rock's mightiest acts at their best.

On occasion, however, the movie studios slip up and actually make good on the full promise of digitized audio/video restoration. The 2003 DVD version of director/superfan Jeff Stein's labor of love rockumentary about the Who, &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; is a perfect example of &quot;promise fulfilled&quot;. If you are only familiar with the once-in-a-blue-moon VH-1 screening, with its tattered print, muffled audio and 600 commercial interruptions, you are in for a real treat. Fans of the film won't notice a lot of difference on the early archival footage; you have to consider the source (usually fuzzy b&amp;w T.V. kinoscopes), although audio on these clips has been noticably upgraded. The restoration shines brightest on the late 70's footage that Stein staged and photographed exculsively for the film; image and sound are breathtaking, particularly for the performances of &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;. With the passing of John Entwistle, this footage has become even more of a precious document, showing the original classic lineup in majestic performance probably only months before Keith Moon's unfortunate demise.

And having read many of the reviews I was in a sweat of anticipation to finally see this film. Sometimes reading such positive reviews can create over-expectation, and this is what I was most concerned about. I've had that with Roger Waters' In the Flesh and also Pink Floyd's Pulse. This expectation was all the greater as I rate Who's Next as the single greatest album of all time. There is not a note in the wrong place. How can you better that?So it was with some trepidation I shoved in disk 1. This was made even worse by my 9-year old daughter occasionally coming into the room to laugh at the 'gay guy' singing. This standing joke began with them seeing Mick Jagger in Rock 'n Roll Circus and my kids now routinely mock every 60s band I watch - but it doesn't stop them watching in fascination.In the end I wasn't disappointed. Quite the contrary. Usually, no matter how good a performance is I rarely watch it all the way through at one sitting - there's just too much else to do. This time I did, and even more rarely it left me wanting much more by The Who.I've always been very selective about The Who - I don't have much of their pre-Tommy stuff, except a compilation, or their post-Quadrophenia.But this film demonstrated that they are not a by-numbers band. I hadn't expected them to be an improvisational band, but this DVD has several renditions of the same song and each was worth watching, and were better than the studio version. I've already seen 30 Years of Maximum R&B;, and was really divided as to which one to buy. Now I see I need both, as well as Live at the Isle of Wight and maybe even the Royal Albert Hall.My philosophy with other bands is just to have one DVD to see what they're like live. But The Kids Are Alright shows the evolution of the band - as only 60s bands seemed to evolve. Their early 60s music is quite different to late 60s, and their early 70s music is similarly quite different. Only the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Traffic and Pink Floyd evolved quite as much.The film also clarified another thing for me - the praise heaped on John Entwhistle.

The special features are incredible; especially the multiple camera angles for ""Baba O' Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" the interview with Daltrey, and the solo Entwistle bass tracks for the two songs mentioned above.  The interview with Jeff Stein is also excellent along with the comparisons of the old picture and sound versus the new. The movie itself looks and sounds so much better.  Jeff Stein's commentary is also very good.  The best live performances in this movie for me are ""Baba O'Riley (best live version),"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again (also best live version),"" ""Roadrunner,"" ""A Quick One While He's Away,"" ""Young Man Blues,"" ""Sparks,"" ""My Generation (from Monterey Pop),"" and ""Barbara Ann.""The Woodstock performances of ""Pinball Wizard"" and ""See Me Feel Me"" have great sound but bad camera angles.  Other highlights include watching the band record ""Who Are You"" in the studio, the interview footage with all four members together, the ""Happy Jack"" and ""Cobwebs and Strange"" segments, John shooting Daltrey's gold records, all of Pete's interviews, all of Keith's interviews, ""I Can't Explain"" on Shindig, ""My Generation"" on the Smothers Brothers show, and whatever else I haven't mentioned.  I could go on for hours.  This is such an amazing movie and my only complaint is that it could have even been an hour or two longer so it could include more footage of the Who live or doing interviews.  However, it is still the best Who DVD available and rightly so.  I hope there will be another Who DVD soon with more classic live footage of the original Who.

When I saw Pete's arms flailing all over the place, doing wind mill after wind mill I thought to myself that this guy that I'm looking at could be the epitome off rock &amp; roll.

489429,A2WJSVSBXEYEF,B000000T01,Jefferson T. Packer,"[10, 10]","Really, I just don't know how this DVD could be any better.It seems like every night, Dave and Jay have some new band on stage.  Some angst-projecting vocalist trying to sound like Kurt Cobain, some guitarist who knows 5 chords and 2 ways to strum each one, a bassist who plays one note at a time, and a drummer who knows only one rythem - bump-bah-bump-bah-bump-bah-badump.  But no matter how bad they are, they all have one thing in common - they're all pretty enough for MTV.  It's enough to make me scream in frustration, because I know how good rock and roll can really be, and THIS DVD is it.Patch your DVD player through your stereo, put masking tape on all your window glass, stuff the dog's ears with cotton, protect all small children with DOT approved devices, then pop this DVD in and hide under the couch, because THIS is rock and roll as it was and is meant to be - master musicians with genuine f--- it all attitude, playing through 10 tons of Marshall Hiwatt amps.  In the late 70's there was a famous ad in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; showing a guy sitting in an armchair in front of a speaker, with his necktie being blown straight back behind him.  Picture that, and you get an idea of what this movie and this band are all about.The movie itself is half comedy and half action-drama.  The comedy comes during interviews and conversations with the band, with Keith initiating most of it and everyone else either joining in or, in the case of the slick corporate &quot;host&quot; types, getting skewered.  The action-drama is all on stage, with Pete whirling his way through incredible guitar playing, Roger providing his usual peerless singing, Keith bringing something almost otherworldly to his drums, and John holding it all down, standing there motionless like the rock of gibralter, his fingers on the bass a blur.Unlike so many modern bands, who surround themselves with &quot;star&quot; mystique and who are always safe and cool on stage, The Who were self-deprecating and able to laugh at themselves when they weren't playing, and when they were playing... well, when they were playing, they consistently reached for the stars.  Sometimes it didn't work - sometimes they sounded like crap.  But when they were in the sweet spot, when they were in &quot;the zone,&quot; they were, to use the apt words of another reviewer, &quot;the greatest rock and roll band ever to draw breath.&quot;Most of what you get in this DVD special edition is &quot;in the zone,&quot; and what little isn't, doesn't really detract from the experience.  Everyone who worked on producing this DVD edition should get a medal, as the film looks and sounds as close to perfection as it is ever going to get.By the way, if you are listening through an old-fashioned, two speaker system, choose &quot;stereo&quot; under sound options.  The reviewer who panned the sound, probably hadn't tried that option yet - on my system (Carver tuner with 2 Dahlquist DQM-9 Compact loudspeakers) choosing &quot;stereo&quot; cleaned up the sound greatly.Unfortunately, most of the people who buy this DVD, probably already know how great it is.  You won't be disappointed, and if you show it to a friend or two, maybe the memory of The Who won't die with us.  There's never been another band like them, and this DVD does them justice for the ages.",5,Rock DVD doesn't come any better than this one,1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,3329,"['Really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'better.It', 'night', 'Dave', 'Jay', 'have', 'new', 'band', 'stage', 'angst-projecting', 'vocalist', 'trying', 'sound', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'guitarist', 'who', '5', 'chords', '2', 'ways', 'strum', 'one', 'bassist', 'who', 'one', 'note', 'time', 'drummer', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'rythem', 'bump-bah-bump-bah-bump-bah-badump', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'are', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'enough', 'MTV', 'enough', 'make', 'scream', 'frustration', 'know', 'how', 'good', 'rock', 'roll', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'it.Patch', 'DVD', 'player', 'stereo', 'put', 'masking', 'tape', 'window', 'glass', 'stuff', 'dog', 'ears', 'cotton', 'protect', 'small', 'children', 'DOT', 'approved', 'devices', 'then', 'DVD', 'hide', 'couch', 'THIS', 'rock', 'roll', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'master', 'musicians', 'genuine', 'f', 'attitude', 'playing', '10', 'tons', 'Marshall', 'Hiwatt', 'amps', 'late', '70', 'was', 'famous', 'ad', 'quot', 'Stereo', 'Review', 'quot', 'showing', 'guy', 'sitting', 'armchair', 'front', 'speaker', 'necktie', 'being', 'blown', 'straight', 'back', 'Picture', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'band', 'are', 'about.The', 'movie', 'half', 'comedy', 'half', 'action-drama', 'comedy', 'interviews', 'conversations', 'band', 'Keith', 'initiating', 'most', 'everyone', 'else', 'joining', 'case', 'slick', 'corporate', 'quot', 'host', 'quot', 'types', 'getting', 'skewered', 'action-drama', 'stage', 'Pete', 'whirling', 'way', 'incredible', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Roger', 'providing', 'usual', 'peerless', 'singing', 'Keith', 'bringing', 'something', 'almost', 'otherworldly', 'drums', 'John', 'holding', 'down', 'standing', 'there', 'motionless', 'rock', 'gibralter', 'fingers', 'bass', 'blur.Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'bands', 'who', 'surround', 'quot', 'star', 'quot', 'mystique', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'safe', 'cool', 'stage', 'Who', 'were', 'self-deprecating', 'able', 'laugh', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'playing', 'when', 'were', 'playing', 'well', 'when', 'were', 'playing', 'consistently', 'reached', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'sometimes', 'sounded', 'crap', 'when', 'were', 'sweet', 'spot', 'when', 'were', 'quot', 'zone', 'quot', 'were', 'use', 'apt', 'words', 'reviewer', 'quot', 'greatest', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'ever', 'draw', 'breath.', 'quot', 'Most', 'what', 'get', 'DVD', 'special', 'edition', 'quot', 'zone', 'quot', 'what', 'little', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'experience', 'Everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'producing', 'DVD', 'edition', 'should', 'get', 'medal', 'film', 'looks', 'as', 'close', 'perfection', 'ever', 'going', 'get.By', 'way', 'are', 'listening', 'old-fashioned', 'two', 'speaker', 'system', 'choose', 'quot', 'quot', 'sound', 'options', 'reviewer', 'who', 'panned', 'sound', 'probably', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'option', 'yet', 'system', 'Carver', 'tuner', '2', 'Dahlquist', 'DQM-9', 'Compact', 'loudspeakers', 'choosing', 'quot', 'quot', 'cleaned', 'up', 'sound', 'greatly.Unfortunately', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'DVD', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'great', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'show', 'friend', 'two', 'maybe', 'memory', 'Who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'never', 'been', 'band', 'DVD', 'justice', 'ages']",N/A

Tubbs,"[0, 1]","This 1979 movie film really put the Who on the map - after it came out everybody was a Who fan - Keith Moon just died a year before and many kids I knew never even heard of the Who even till The Kids Are Alright came out - This led to feverish ticket sales with the 1979 tour a month or two later that eventually developed into the tradgity a the Ohio gig where many kids were killed because time magizine said this might be thier last tour etc.. So in a way this film made the Who even bigger than they were - Many Who fans never saw Kieth Moon play but in this film including myself - I would guess at least two thirds of Who fans never saw Keith live except this film - When kieth played with the band The Who played generally 2000 to 4000 seat venues except for special larger gigs like New Castle England gig which had over 100,000 kids there - and other famous super gigs - They played at the 3000 seat Capital Theater in Washington DC in 1973 during the Quadraphina Tour - it is the example of a smaller 3000 seat venue etc.. - the oval roof cement building is still there next to the DC Union Station yard - The Greatful Dead were the last band to play there in 1973 before it closed down then - the Beatles played thier first gig in America there after the TV show in 1964 after riding down on a train from New York City - The Who did do many big shows with Kieth but more people saw Kenny Jones play with them than any other drummer before or since - every show they did with him sold out in a hour or less - the gigs were at least the Arena size from 1979 to 1982 - I know it sounds stupid now but when Pete - Roger - John and Kenny hit the stage at the spectrum in 1979 the place went crazy with applause and screaming - It was like seeing the Beatles or something - Pete plugged in the Les Paul and made some tune up sounds - people went nuts etc,..  I know it was all because of this film they became superstars to kids that where only like 9 to 12 years old when Who's Next came out - definitely a new Who generation so to speak - so this is a important part of Who history for me - They sold more records than ever after Kieth died and I know this film did that for them - 20 year old kids were yelling out song names to play at the band that were already ten to 6 years old then long after they off the charts - kids would yell at John to play Whisky Man and stuff like that you know he never did it was crazy - So thats what this film means to me and when you see it again or never saw it before you'll see why they went crazy I guess - It is a pretty good Rock film even now a must have for any Hooligan at any age",5,The Who bigger than life,1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,2633,"['1979', 'movie', 'film', 'really', 'put', 'Who', 'map', 'came', 'out', 'everybody', 'was', 'Who', 'fan', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'just', 'died', 'year', 'many', 'kids', 'knew', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Who', 'even', 'till', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'came', 'out', 'led', 'feverish', 'ticket', 'sales', '1979', 'tour', 'month', 'two', 'later', 'eventually', 'developed', 'tradgity', 'Ohio', 'gig', 'where', 'many', 'kids', 'were', 'killed', 'time', 'magizine', 'said', 'might', 'be', 'thier', 'last', 'tour', 'etc..', 'So', 'way', 'film', 'made', 'Who', 'even', 'bigger', 'were', 'Many', 'Who', 'fans', 'never', 'saw', 'Kieth', 'Moon', 'play', 'film', 'including', 'would', 'guess', 'least', 'two', 'thirds', 'Who', 'never', 'saw', 'Keith', 'live', 'film', 'When', 'kieth', 'played', 'band', 'Who', 'played', 'generally', '2000', '4000', 'seat', 'venues', 'special', 'larger', 'gigs', 'New', 'Castle', 'England', 'gig', 'had', '100,000', 'kids', 'there', 'other', 'famous', 'super', 'gigs', 'played', '3000', 'seat', 'Capital', 'Theater', 'Washington', 'DC', '1973', 'Quadraphina', 'Tour', 'example', 'smaller', '3000', 'seat', 'venue', 'etc..', 'oval', 'roof', 'cement', 'building', 'still', 'next', 'DC', 'Union', 'Station', 'yard', 'Greatful', 'Dead', 'were', 'last', 'band', 'play', 'there', '1973', 'closed', 'down', 'then', 'Beatles', 'played', 'thier', 'first', 'gig', 'America', 'TV', 'show', '1964', 'riding', 'down', 'train', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Who', 'did', 'do', 'many', 'big', 'shows', 'Kieth', 'more', 'people', 'saw', 'Kenny', 'Jones', 'play', 'other', 'drummer', 'show', 'did', 'sold', 'out', 'hour', 'less', 'gigs', 'were', 'least', 'Arena', 'size', '1979', '1982', 'know', 'stupid', 'now', 'when', 'Pete', 'Roger', 'John', 'Kenny', 'hit', 'stage', 'spectrum', '1979', 'place', 'went', 'crazy', 'applause', 'screaming', 'was', 'seeing', 'Beatles', 'something', 'Pete', 'plugged', 'Les', 'Paul', 'made', 'tune', 'up', 'people', 'went', 'nuts', 'etc', '..', 'know', 'was', 'film', 'became', 'superstars', 'kids', 'where', 'only', '9', '12', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Who', 'Next', 'came', 'out', 'definitely', 'new', 'Who', 'generation', 'so', 'speak', 'so', 'important', 'part', 'Who', 'history', 'sold', 'more', 'records', 'ever', 'Kieth', 'died', 'know', 'film', 'did', '20', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'were', 'yelling', 'out', 'song', 'names', 'play', 'band', 'were', 'already', 'ten', '6', 'years', 'old', 'then', 'long', 'off', 'charts', 'kids', 'would', 'yell', 'John', 'play', 'Whisky', 'Man', 'stuff', 'know', 'never', 'did', 'was', 'crazy', 'So', 'what', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'again', 'never', 'saw', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'went', 'crazy', 'guess', 'pretty', 'good', 'Rock', 'film', 'even', 'now', 'must', 'have', 'Hooligan', 'age']",N/A

489436,AYKN84MIK63TP,B000000T01,M. Hughes,"[2, 2]","Let me preface my review by first saying that I am first and foremost a Rolling Stones and Beatles fan. However, this is for me the best rock documentary - really, rock movie - ever made. I saw it in theaters when it was first released and was blown away. Back then there was still an intense rivalry between fans of the big English bands. Beatles fans looked down on Stones fans and vice versa. Zeppelin fans didn't mix with Stones fans and The Who fans didn't mess with either of them. You get the point, and believe me it is not much of an exaggeration - there was not a lot of crossover love between these bands fans back in the day. I had sat through a bunch of rock and roll movies before I saw this one - Ladies & Gentlemen, The Song Remains the Same, etc., but none of them ever quite captured fully the raw excitement and energy that rock and roll made us feel - until I saw this movie. For the live footage of Keith Moon alone this movie should always be held in high esteem, but what this movie captured for me was the excitement of the English bands of the Sixties, that time, that atmosphere, the mood, the fashion - all of it - all that captured the imagination of those of us fascinated by what the Sixties were, but slightly too young to have been there to participate in it.

This film cemented in my mind, who was the best live band ever. Have been waiting for this DVD release patiently for a few years now. I am blown away by the special features that come with this movie (DTS surround, director commentary, Roger Daltrey interview, alternate camera angles, 5.1 mix of the studio version of ""Who Are You"", assorted featurettes). The producers of this DVD really did a great job with the mastering and packaging of this product. You WILL NOT be disappointed.Reasons why you should buy this DVD:1. You will not find a better live version of any of the songs in this movie, on any other Who release. Trust me, I own every Who release there is, and many bootlegs.2. Interviews with the band - Townshend and Keith Moon are in rare (not sober) form. These really show the four distinct personalities within the band.3. Rare performances from the very early years & television programs that have not been released on anything else.4. The special features mentioned above. Check out the multi angle feature for ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" - 4-6 camera angles are available on each, so you can watch any member of the band for the entirety of the songs. Also contains a feature to view/listen to the same two songs with John Entwistle's bass part on an isolated track. Besides being an interesting feature, imagine this would really appeal to somebody that has tried to learn his bass lines.5. The 'My Generation' opening on the Smothers Brothers show. If that kind of performance went down on Leno or Letterman today, it would probably result in authorities shutting down the show and some arrests being made.6. Song selection - Live cuts from every Who studio album through Who Are You, except Quadrophenia. Plus some off cuts thrown in like 'Cobwebs and Strange', 'Success Story', 'Shout and Shimmy'.7. The tour scene through John Entwistle's home, showing off his guitar collection and gold record skeet shooting ability.8. Last live performances of Keith Moon before he died in 1978.There may be other bands with better production in the studio, such as Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones, but this movie does a great job of showing you who the best live performance band is. Hands down it has to be The Who. Live performance was and is the Who's niche. Production can't hide what other bands are not capable of on stage.If you need your live fix of Quadrophenia songs, I strongly recommend 'The Who: Live at Royal Albert Hall'.

Show', 'Monterey Pop', 'Woodstock', 'Gimme Shelter' and the other documentaries that have achieved legendary status. But I think there is one more thing that needs to come onto DVD to truly understand what The Who meant to their fans.Much more so than other acts, writers discussing The Who would bend over backwards to show that their opinions were not influenced by radio airplay - as a result they proclaimed ad nauseum that everything recorded before 'Tommy' was perfect while everything after was garbage (TKAA even has something to offer that crowd as there are four (!) versions of ""My Generation"").Growing up a fan, however, my friends and I would decide what to listen to and buy according to our own instincts about what was exciting and energetic rather than the pretensions or delusions of Rolling Stone writers. This meant of course that among one of rock's mightiest repertoires one album would always be the greatest ('Who's Next') and one song always the greatest - ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" - the original version a performance so stirring and majestic that it cannot be left off any SINCERE list of the greatest rock songs of all time.But as the song's reputation built throughout the 1970's the live performance of WGFA transformed into something far, far, far beyond a routine rendition. The grandest of grande finales, it became the single greatest moment of anticipation, drama and ecstasy in all of 20th Century music - I personally can't think of anything comparable other than the endings of the greatest Verdi operas. If you were lucky enough to be there when every last fan in a crowd of 20,000, 40,000 or 60,000 raised his hands and yelled YEEEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!! with Roger at the end of the last synthesizer break, then you knew you were part of a spine-tingling, goose-bumping audience thrill you could experience nowhere else.All Who fans should be grateful to Jeff Stein for acknowledging the pride of place of WGFA in the Who canon by selecting it as the concluding number. The version here is magnificent, unto itself justifying a five star rating for the DVD. But because it was filmed on a soundstage, there is only the faintest glimmer of the audience dynamics that would help the viewer understand what that song, and indeed what the band, meant to its audience. I'm still hoping that someday there will be a DVD of comparable quality of one of the large scale shows (the Shea Stadium concert comes to mind) so everyone can understand completely why The Who inspired more devotion than any act in the history of rock'n'roll.",5,the best of its kind ... but one piece of the puzzle is missing,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,2659,"['finest', 'biographical', 'rock', 'documentary', 'negligent', 'not', 'include', ""'The"", 'T.A.M.I', 'Show', 'Pop', ""'Woodstock"", 'Gim', 'Shelter', 'other', 'documentaries', 'have', 'achieved', 'legendary', 'status', 'think', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'come', 'DVD', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'Who', 'meant', 'fans.Much', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'acts', 'writers', 'discussing', 'Who', 'would', 'bend', 'backwards', 'show', 'opinions', 'were', 'not', 'influenced', 'radio', 'airplay', 'result', 'proclaimed', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'everything', 'recorded', ""'Tommy"", 'was', 'perfect', 'everything', 'was', 'garbage', 'TKAA', 'even', 'something', 'offer', 'crowd', 'are', 'four', 'versions', 'Generation', '.Growing', 'up', 'fan', 'however', 'friends', 'would', 'decide', 'what', 'listen', 'buy', 'according', 'own', 'instincts', 'what', 'was', 'exciting', 'energetic', 'rather', 'pretensions', 'delusions', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'writers', 'meant', 'course', 'one', 'rock', 'mightiest', 'one', 'album', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'greatest', 'Next', 'one', 'song', 'always', 'greatest', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'original', 'version', 'performance', 'so', 'stirring', 'majestic', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'left', 'off', 'SINCERE', 'list', 'greatest', 'rock', 'songs', 'time.But', 'song', 'reputation', 'built', '1970', 'live', 'performance', 'WGFA', 'transformed', 'something', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'routine', 'rendition', 'grandest', 'grande', 'finales', 'became', 'single', 'greatest', 'moment', 'anticipation', 'drama', 'ecstasy', '20th', 'Century', 'music', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'comparable', 'other', 'endings', 'greatest', 'Verdi', 'operas', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'last', 'fan', 'crowd', '20,000', '40,000', '60,000', 'raised', 'hands', 'yelled', 'YEEEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHH', 'Roger', 'end', 'last', 'synthesizer', 'break', 'then', 'knew', 'were', 'part', 'spine-tingling', 'goose-bumping', 'audience', 'thrill', 'could', 'experience', 'nowhere', 'else.All', 'Who', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'Jeff', 'Stein', 'acknowledging', 'pride', 'place', 'WGFA', 'Who', 'canon', 'selecting', 'concluding', 'number', 'version', 'here', 'magnificent', 'unto', 'justifying', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'DVD', 'was', 'filmed', 'soundstage', 'only', 'faintest', 'glimmer', 'audience', 'dynamics', 'would', 'help', 'viewer', 'understand', 'what', 'song', 'indeed', 'what', 'band', 'meant', 'audience', ""'m"", 'still', 'hoping', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'comparable', 'quality', 'one', 'large', 'scale', 'shows', 'Shea', 'Stadium', 'concert', 'mind', 'everyone', 'can', 'understand', 'completely', 'why', 'Who', 'inspired', 'more', 'devotion', 'act', 'history', 'rock', ""n'roll""]",N/A

This film showcases some of the last great performances of the venerable Keith Moon. Both Moon's fantastic drumming and Daltrey's famous blood-curdling scream on ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" are classic pieces of rock history. The likes of which will never be seen again.Keith Moon was not only rock's greatest drummer but he was also one of rock's funny men. Moon always had a quick wit about him and you can see some of that in this film.

489452,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000000T01,Robert Moore,"[188, 190]","After having seen several other major DVD opportunities get squandered (The Beatles's HARD DAYS NIGHT leaps to mind), it is an utter delight to watch/listen to this DVD.  It is great on several levels:  the original film was one of the best collections of live performances in the history of rock, the reissue has dramatically improved the look and sound of the film, and the Special Edition extra disc includes some truly wonderful features.  This ought to be the model for all future reissues, such as when/if they reissue the Rolling Stones's TWENTY-FIVE BY FIVE.Only a couple of years ago I was trying to explain to my daughter that in the sixties and seventies, the Who were full-fledged members of the rock Pantheon, as revolutionary and crucial as the Stones, the Beatles, or Led Zeppelin.  For some reason, they went into a bit of a decline in the general musical consciousness (I found kids my daughter's age might not know of them at all, whereas they knew the other aforementioned bands quite well).  Thanks to some timely re-released and a tragic tour that saw the death of John Entwhistle, their star truly seems to be on the ascendant again.  This album is crucial for proving what all of us at the time knew:  the Who was without question one of the very greatest live bands of all time.The Who was an amazing band, full of paradoxes.  Roger Daltrey was one of the great front men in the history of rock, and Pete Townshend a crack songwriter and arguably the most entertaining to watch guitarist of all time.  Yet, the lead instruments in the band, almost unique in rock, were Keith Moon and his maniacally abused drum kit and John Entwhistle's bass, both of them among the top two or three of all time on their instruments, if not the best.  They were a great rhythm section, but they jointly tended to take over the songs musically, unlike Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman for the Stones, who were content to stay rock solid in the background.  Live, they were amazing, with Daltrey marching in place, swinging the mike around like David about to use his sling against Goliath; Pete Townshend dancing disjointedly around while doing his famous helicopter chording of the guitar; Keith Moon playing as if he were on eight different drugs, tossing his drumsticks ten and twenty feet in the air; and amid it all, like the quiet in the eye of the hurricane, John Entwhistle standing stock still, motionless except for his hands moving up and down his bass, playing the instrument better than anyone else ever had, or perhaps has since.The film begins with a bang, with a famous appearance on The Smothers Brothers Show (an awesome show because it was so amazingly subversive, with Tom and Dick acting like total squares, but in reality leftists who loved exposing the public to acts like Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl, and bands like The Who and Cream).  Unlike Ed Sullivan, Tom and Dick truly loved these bands, and the opening number/skit, a rollicking version of &quot;My Generation&quot; (with Roger Daltrey suffering so badly from a faux upper-induced stammer that was a badge of their identification with the amphetamine-crazed Mods that one isn't certain he is going to be able to finish each line).  Each number brings new revelations or refreshes old memories.  For instance, in &quot;I Can't Explain&quot; from SHINDIG! Keith Moon is sporting a T-shirt with a bull's eye on it, a full decade before Richard Hell would achieve notoriety in New York for wearing one when he was still with Television.The numbers included in the film are both wide-ranging and representative.  I suppose any Who fan will find many of their own favorites missing, but no one can complain that the numbers focus too much on one phase of their career.  The selections are extraordinarily well balanced.  One of the more poignant features is the fact that the performance of &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again,&quot; which was performed specifically for the film so that they could have one really good performance on film of one of their most famous numbers, was the last time the Who ever performed in their original line up; Keith Moon would die only three months later.The extras disc is truly worth having, with a feature on the restoration of the movie, and nice items like a tour of the Who's London, an interview with Roger Daltrey, and, my favorite bit, interesting versions of &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again,&quot; that features only John Entwhistle's bass and visuals.  There is no question about it:  the guy could play bass.All in all, one is going to come across very few music DVDs quite this good.

Until I saw the movie!  The Kids are Alright is the perfect distillation of this incredible band, from the striking visual spectacle of them performing live, to Keith Moon's spontaneous lunacy, to Peter Townshend's caustic wit, to the thunderous noise they made, and the stages they left looking like fresh battlefields.  Though this movie is more in the nature of a audio/visual collage rather than a chronological history of The Who, watching this you will understand who Messrs. Townshend, Daltrey, Entwhistle and Moon are (or were), and what all the fuss was about.  As bonuses on this dvd set (besides the cleaned up audio and picture), you get an interesting commentary by the director that conveys the labor of love that this movie was for him, and a revealing interview with Roger Daltrey that provides some fascinating insight on The Who's music and the movie.

I watched it over and over with my brothers, fascinated by Pete Townshend's songs and Keith Moon's lunatic drumming. Then I grew up and the movie came out on VHS . . . but big chunks of it were missing.Now it's been restored. The sound is perfect, the picture looks better than ever, and everything from the original documentary is back. This includes the infamous mini-opera, A Quick One While He's Away. This 7-and-a-half minute song marks the transition between the band's overheated R&amp;B and their art rock phase (in which Townshend tried to make sense of his stardom with a series of conceptual albums. Most of them worked, too). It's not easy to get into A Quick One the first time you see/hear it. You have to come back to it over and over until it sinks in and you realize what a breakthrough it was for the band.The extras on the DVD are pretty good. The best extra bit is an interview with Roger Daltrey. He talks about how shocked Keith Moon was to see the final cut of the film, noticing how quickly he had aged. Daltrey also gives the full story on the exploding drum kit from the opening scene --- an explosion that knocked the singer to the ground and permanently damaged Townshend's hearing.This is one of the best rock and roll documentaries you'll ever see. You get the full history of the band, with over a dozen complete performances.

All the little interview snippets that Jeff Stein had interwoven between the big segments acted as filmic grace notes, so it's great to have them back.  Also welcome is the restoration of the complete mini-opera from the Stone's R&R; Circus.The DVD is both less and more than the original film was.  The hi-def rendering makes the old b/w footage seem even grainier than it did on the theatrical release's celluloid.  (The Producer's Cut, as someone on an interview track calls it!)  Plus, since no one seems to have kept a whole negative, the film had to be reassembled from parts again, many of which had deteriorated over the years.But all that is like the wrinkles in a piece of leather: the flaws give it character.  There's the film itself, Jeff Stein's impressionistic montage of The Who.  Given that there's little footage of their early 70s peak, and no Quadruphenia material at all, it's still impressive how amazingly great the band is onscreen.Okay, no need to plug the film; any given Who fan will have most of it committed to memory anyway.  But if you're new to the DVD, there's plenty of goodies here.  On one feature, Jeff Stein and an interviewer voiceover the whole film, reminiscing and commenting as each segment unreels.  The producer tells the tangled tale of how the film was re-produced for the DVD.  And joy of joys, there are the bonus footage tracks.  These are not additional music clips, but are the Shepperton sequences, with the individual camera angles broken out separately.  So, if you are a big Entwistle fan, you can select the Oxcam and enjoy his formidable prestidigitation on ""Baba O'Riley"" and Won't Get Fooled Again"" uninterrupted from start to finish.  Indeed, Entwistle gets spotlighted in a couple of isolated audio tracks from Shepperton.  It too is wonderful, showing him flailing his Alembic bass.  His sound is like a boxer working over a speed bag, as he lays down a cacophany of 32nd notes, and then hauls off for a killer bottom string note.  It's of much more than just historical interest.The Who's place in rock history is secure, thanks in no small part to this lovingly restored landmark film.

Jeff Stein's tribute to his favorite band has always been a favorite of mine, even though as a kid I really wasn't much of a Who fan.This movie does what the director wanted it to do--it shows how,regardless of how ripped, how zonked, how crazy these guys were, they never lost the energy, especially when they played live.From a documentary standpoint, if the movie has any downpoint to it, it tends to skip over demons that are clearly at play here, or poke fun at them. Witness the clearly inebriated team of Moon and Ringo, probably the two most famous rock drummers ever, both trying to justify their drinking habits. Stein lets you draw your own conclusions, and we all know what happened to Keith. (Ringo, thank goodness, dried up eventually.)  There are so many points here where you KNOW, from history, that Townshend is hopped up on heroin  that you can't help but wonder if he'd have been just as good without it--or even better.Watching this now, one can marvel at what incredible genius we lost when Keith Moon died. He may well have been the only drummer ever to play the drums as a lead instrument.

All of that is fixed with this stupendous DVD restoration of the film to its original glory! The footage that was cut, like the tremendous performance of A Quick One While He's Away has been fully restored, as has the sound and color quality of the film. This documentary of The Who at their most explosive should be required viewing for all fans of rock music. The quality of this DVD version of the film is terrific and you'll want to listen to it VERY LOUD! Many great performances and rare clips were collected for this documentary, including early TV performances in the US, UK and Germany, early promotional films and explosive performances like Woodstock and those filmed specifically for The Kids Are Alright. Fascinating interviews with the band are interspersed throughout.The disc of extras is a wonderful bonus that includes great recent interviews with Jeff Stein and Roger Daltrey, multi-camera angle views of the performances of Baba O'Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again, isolated bass tracks of The Ox playing on the aforementioned two tracks, a tour of locations important to The Who in the early days, and more.If you are a long-time Who fan you will rejoice to see the film looking and sounding this good again. If you are a newer fan who has never seen the astounding force of The Who at the peak of their energy, then you absolutely must see this version of The Kids Are Alright! Thank goodness Jeff Stein didn't let his film fade away, it is a treasure for all Who fans that are now and are yet to be. He has preserved musical magic, hopefully for many years to come.

In this 1979 rockumentary directed by Jeff Stein, the band is shown in classic clips performing some of their best songs.  When it opens, we see them performing ""My Generation"" on ""The Smothers Brothers Show"".  After the documentary's titles are shown, we cut to a clip of them singing ""I Can't Explain"" on what would be the last broadcast of ""Shindig"", ABC's evening answer to their ever-popular ""American Bandstand"".  About a half-hour or so into the movie, we're treated to their electrifying performance of ""See Me, Feel Me/Listening to You"" at the 1969 Woodstock Festival.  In between these rocking performances, we get to see the four men reveal their true selves during interviews, such as the one done by English TV show host Russell Harty.  Here, you get to see them display their sense of humor, with Harty not batting an eye.  They are also asked, by various fans, questions on topics ranging from drugs to looks.  Although all four members are interviewed, none is interviewed more often than Pete Townshend, who presents a thoughtful, serious side of himself.  Of course, no Who documentary would be complete without clips of him destroying his guitar during concerts, for which he is legendary.  During the ""Smothers Brothers"" segment, after Tom watches Townshend destroy his guitar, he tells his brother Dick to bring his guitar (so that Townshend could destroy it!).  We also get to see drummer Keith Moon during his crazy, maniacal moments and on the drums.  I would say he was The Who's equivalent of The Beatles's Ringo Starr, who, by the way, we see talking to Moon.  Throughout this whole movie, we hear the best that these guys had to offer, including the aforementioned ""My Generation"" (we also get treated to a clip of them singing it at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), ""I Can't Explain"", ""Teenage Wasteland"", ""Happy Jack"", ""Tommy"", ""Pinball Wizard"", ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""Magic Bus"", and at the end, ""Long Live Rock"".These men knew how to rock; their music defined a generation.

Show', 'Monterey Pop', 'Woodstock', 'Gimme Shelter' and the other documentaries that have achieved legendary status. But I think there is one more thing that needs to come onto DVD to really understand what The Who meant to their fans.Much more so than other acts, writers discussing The Who will insist that their opinions are not influenced by radio airplay - as a result they will claim that everything recorded before 'Tommy' was perfect while everything after was garbage (this film even has something to offer that crowd as there are four (!) versions of ""My Generation"").Growing up as a fan, however, my friends and I would decide what to buy and listen to according to our own instincts about what was exciting and energetic rather than the delusions of the writers at Rolling Stone. This meant of course that among one of rock's mightiest repertoires one album would always be the greatest ('Who's Next') and one song would always be the greatest - ""Won't Get Fooled Again"". The original version forms a performance so stirring and majestic that it cannot be left off any SINCERE list of the greatest rock songs of all time.But as the song's reputation grew throughout the 1970's the live performance of WGFA transformed into something far,far beyond a routine rendition. The grandest of grande finales, it became the single greatest moment of anticipation, drama and ecstasy in all of 20th Century music - I personally can't think of anything comparable other than the endings of the greatest Verdi operas. If you were lucky enough to be with 20,000, 40,000 or 60,000 people when every last one of them raised their hands and yelled YEEEEEEAAAHHHHHH!!!! with Roger at the end of the last synthesizer break, then you knew you had gone through a spine-tingling, goose-bumping audience thrill you could experience nowhere else.All Who fans should be grateful to Jeff Stein for acknowledging the pride of place of WGFA in the Who canon by selecting it as the concluding number. The version here is magnificent, unto itself justifying a five star rating. But because it was filmed on a soundstage, there is only the faintest glimmer of the audience dynamics that would help the viewer understand what that song, and indeed what the band, meant to its audience. I'm still hoping that someday there will be a DVD of comparable quality of one of the large scale shows (the Shea Stadium concert comes to mind) so everyone can understand completely why The Who inspired more devotion than any act in rock music history.",5,the best of its kind ... but one piece of the puzzle is missing,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,2616,"['finest', 'biographical', 'rock', 'documentary', 'negligent', 'not', 'include', ""'The"", 'T.A.M.I', 'Show', 'Pop', ""'Woodstock"", 'Gim', 'Shelter', 'other', 'documentaries', 'have', 'achieved', 'legendary', 'status', 'think', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'come', 'DVD', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'Who', 'meant', 'fans.Much', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'acts', 'writers', 'discussing', 'Who', 'will', 'insist', 'opinions', 'are', 'not', 'influenced', 'radio', 'airplay', 'result', 'will', 'claim', 'everything', 'recorded', ""'Tommy"", 'was', 'perfect', 'everything', 'was', 'garbage', 'film', 'even', 'something', 'offer', 'crowd', 'are', 'four', 'versions', 'Generation', '.Growing', 'up', 'fan', 'however', 'friends', 'would', 'decide', 'what', 'buy', 'listen', 'according', 'own', 'instincts', 'what', 'was', 'exciting', 'energetic', 'rather', 'delusions', 'writers', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'meant', 'course', 'one', 'rock', 'mightiest', 'one', 'album', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'greatest', 'Next', 'one', 'song', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'greatest', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'original', 'version', 'performance', 'so', 'stirring', 'majestic', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'left', 'off', 'SINCERE', 'list', 'greatest', 'rock', 'songs', 'time.But', 'song', 'reputation', 'grew', '1970', 'live', 'performance', 'WGFA', 'transformed', 'something', 'far', 'far', 'routine', 'rendition', 'grandest', 'grande', 'finales', 'became', 'single', 'greatest', 'moment', 'anticipation', 'drama', 'ecstasy', '20th', 'Century', 'music', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'comparable', 'other', 'endings', 'greatest', 'Verdi', 'operas', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', '20,000', '40,000', '60,000', 'people', 'when', 'last', 'one', 'raised', 'hands', 'yelled', 'YEEEEEEAAAHHHHHH', 'Roger', 'end', 'last', 'synthesizer', 'break', 'then', 'knew', 'had', 'gone', 'spine-tingling', 'goose-bumping', 'audience', 'thrill', 'could', 'experience', 'nowhere', 'else.All', 'Who', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'Jeff', 'Stein', 'acknowledging', 'pride', 'place', 'WGFA', 'Who', 'canon', 'selecting', 'concluding', 'number', 'version', 'here', 'magnificent', 'unto', 'justifying', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'filmed', 'soundstage', 'only', 'faintest', 'glimmer', 'audience', 'dynamics', 'would', 'help', 'viewer', 'understand', 'what', 'song', 'indeed', 'what', 'band', 'meant', 'audience', ""'m"", 'still', 'hoping', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'comparable', 'quality', 'one', 'large', 'scale', 'shows', 'Shea', 'Stadium', 'concert', 'mind', 'everyone', 'can', 'understand', 'completely', 'why', 'Who', 'inspired', 'more', 'devotion', 'act', 'rock', 'music', 'history']",N/A

The bad thing is that the film doesn't offer much but clips of great performances and chopped up interviews that could have been interesting. The32 page book is short on in-depth information and the tiny photos are a huge dissapointment. The second DVD which reveals the clean up process is alright but not really worth one's money. They could have put complete performances in that one...what a loss.The last tragedy here is the interview voice over with Director Jeff Stein. Stein never seems to give a straight answer to the simplest question. He rambles and constantly praises Keith and Pete but doesn't articulate on the film scenes, process or motivation. It is the most painfull part of the entire film. trully a horrible voice over! I still purchased it for the rare footage and the great performance of  &quot;Baba O' Riley'&quot; and &quot;Who Are You.&quot;  If you want the actual &quot;Who&quot; I would suggest  &quot;The Who's Maximum R&amp;B video.&quot; It contains complete performances from the rarest  places all in great Stereo sound.I guarentee you &quot;won't get fooled again!&quot;",3,GET FOOLED AGAIN.........,1071360000,"12 14, 2003",2003,1429,"['Wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'fooled', 'again', '.Yeah', 'was', 'pretty', 'fooled', 'new', 'DVD', 'version', 'quot', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Who', 'quot', 'Documentry', 'Directed', 'byJeff', 'Stein', 'very', 'little', 'added', '25', 'years', 'originally', 'came', 'out.The', 'good', 'thing', 're-release', 'cleaned', 'up', 'footage', 'clarity', 'audio', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'clips', 'great', 'performances', 'chopped', 'up', 'interviews', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'The32', 'page', 'book', 'short', 'in-depth', 'information', 'tiny', 'photos', 'are', 'huge', 'dissapointment', 'second', 'DVD', 'clean', 'up', 'process', 'alright', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'one', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'complete', 'performances', 'one', 'what', 'loss.The', 'last', 'tragedy', 'here', 'interview', 'voice', 'Director', 'Jeff', 'Stein', 'Stein', 'never', 'give', 'straight', 'answer', 'simplest', 'question', 'constantly', 'Keith', 'Pete', ""n't"", 'articulate', 'film', 'scenes', 'process', 'motivation', 'most', 'painfull', 'part', 'entire', 'film', 'trully', 'horrible', 'voice', 'still', 'purchased', 'rare', 'footage', 'great', 'performance', 'quot', 'Baba', 'O', 'Riley', 'quot', 'quot', 'Who', 'Are', 'You.', 'quot', 'want', 'actual', 'quot', 'Who', 'quot', 'would', 'suggest', 'quot', 'Who', 'Maximum', 'R', 'amp', 'B', 'video.', 'quot', 'complete', 'performances', 'rarest', 'places', 'great', 'Stereo', 'sound.I', 'guarentee', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'fooled', 'again', 'quot']",N/A

I like being able to isolate the ""Bass"" line on two songs and changing camera angles.  While my family had lived within earshot of the 1967 Monterey Pop festival, I didn't know much about ""The Who"" until I saw this movie. I viewed ""Tommy"" and ""The Kids Are Alright"" as a double feature in Seattle.  Every time the WHO appeared on the screen, the audience would jump up and yell (especially when the film broke during ""Tommy"")!  I remarked to the woman sitting next to me that ""I'd never been in a riot before."" The recent commercialization of The Who's music (The CSI TV Shows, Hummer Commercials etc.)reminded me how great they were, so I ordered this DVD.  I am not disappointed.

I had reviewed this back in 2000 (see my review &quot;My friends call me Keith but you can call me John&quot;) in reference to the VHS version and was impressed with the packaging and the quality.  Interestingly enough, this edition features the song &quot;The Kids Are Allright&quot; as the final credits roll.  Also, you get to see Keith Richards introduce the Who (with eyepatch and his distinctively raspy voice &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, dig the Who!&quot;).  I was amused by the footage respliced for &quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot; (which features Keith Moon's manic drums) and to find out that the records John Entwistle used for skeet shooting were Roger Daltrey's solo albums!  Pete Townshend and Moon the Loon are quite amusing in interview, tearing the sleeves off each other's shirts!Now for the extras.  Inside is a booklet with pictures and insights by Jeff Stein.  There's a commentary by Jeff as well.  There's a 30 minute sequence on how they improved both the sound and picture quality of the original and you get to see for yourself the improvement between the old (very grainy and sped up sound) and the new.  There are 2 trivia games with a surprise at the end of each one!).  There's an angle to angle view of &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; (along with a separate bass track, a nice tribute to the late John Entwistle).  There's a tour of many of the famous spots in Who history.  And finally, there are interviews with Roger Daltrey, who's both diplomatic and direct about his memories with the Who and Jeff Stein, a passionate Who fan, who recalls his experiences in making a movie of his favourite band (not too unlike the movie Almost Famous!).  If you liked the original, you'll love this repackaged edition.
