Jake Cutter played by Stephen Collins, of 7Th heaven fame. Does a phenominal job, And I have to say I was impressed that he could not only do action and comedy, but alittle bit of Drama as well. The sad thing about this show, is that Raiders Of The Lost Ark just came out. And so the producers wanted more of that kind of show, but Bellisario wanted a more Casablanca show.  There's Cutter's sidekick Corkey, he maintains the Cutter's plane. Sarah Stickney White, Cutter's love interest in the show. Princess Koji, but the one character that steals the show is Jack the dog. All of these characters call a backwater corner of the south pacific home, Cutter is an Expatriate American Adventurer who often finds himself in the thick of High-seas Adventure. BoraGora is their lush tropical home, jake also lives above the Monkey Bar run by Bon Chance Louie. Sarah Stickney white, who is also an American Agent, provides the musical Entertainment. Why the studio decided to cancell the show is still a mystery, because this show is really good. The characters a well developed, the stories are solid.

I recently got the DVD set and marveled at the talent that went into this show.Tales of the Gold Monkey is set in the South (or central) Pacific in the year just before the outbreak of WWII in Europe. A Flying Tiger pilot, convalescing following being shot down over China by the Japanese, marks time by flying his Grumman Goose seaplane on a series of adventures in the French Pacific Mandate islands.Unfortunately, there were no Flying Tigers until 1941, nor was there a French Mandate in the Pacific (there was a Japanese Mandate, as portrayed in the series). The cargo cult phenomenon came about AFTER WWII, not before it. In one show the pilots are flying a DC-3 for the flying tigers but it has a USAF Military Airlift Command paint scheme from the 1960s. There are other items which are incongruous or chronologically challenged. This is not a program which will improve your history knowledge.With that being said I liked the show despite myself. It had a lot of fun scenes and some good plots. Too bad the writers just took so many liberties. But if you can forget about some of the unlikely events in this show (pretend that we're talking about an alternate universe if it bothers you that much!) then I think you'll like this.",4,"Great story, but lots of historical flaws",1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,1323,"['remember', 'when', 'program', 'was', 'air', 'never', 'watched', 'time', 'recently', 'got', 'DVD', 'set', 'marveled', 'talent', 'went', 'show.Tales', 'Gold', 'Monkey', 'set', 'South', 'central', 'Pacific', 'year', 'just', 'outbreak', 'WWII', 'Europe', 'A', 'Flying', 'Tiger', 'pilot', 'convalescing', 'following', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'China', 'Japanese', 'marks', 'time', 'flying', 'Grumman', 'Goose', 'seaplane', 'series', 'adventures', 'French', 'Pacific', 'Mandate', 'islands.Unfortunately', 'were', 'Flying', 'Tigers', '1941', 'was', 'French', 'Mandate', 'Pacific', 'was', 'Japanese', 'Mandate', 'portrayed', 'series', 'cargo', 'cult', 'phenomenon', 'came', 'about', 'AFTER', 'WWII', 'not', 'one', 'show', 'pilots', 'are', 'flying', 'DC-3', 'flying', 'tigers', 'USAF', 'Military', 'Airlift', 'Command', 'paint', 'scheme', '1960s', 'are', 'other', 'items', 'are', 'incongruous', 'chronologically', 'challenged', 'not', 'program', 'will', 'improve', 'history', 'knowledge.With', 'being', 'said', 'liked', 'show', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'scenes', 'good', 'plots', 'Too', 'bad', 'writers', 'just', 'took', 'so', 'many', 'liberties', 'can', 'forget', 'unlikely', 'events', 'show', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'talking', 'alternate', 'universe', 'much', 'then', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like']",N/A

He even has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame along with his producer friends, Glen A. Larson and Stephen J. Cannell. But his rise to that lofty position wasn't an easy one....The Bellisario produced series ""Quantum Leap"" was nearly cancelled on several occasions, finally being saved by a letter writing campaign which allowed the series to continue for two additional seasons (Five in all). He also created the TV series ""JAG"" which was swiftly CANCELLED by NBC after only one season. Amazingly, JAG was picked up (saved) by rival network CBS, where it became a HUGE hit, running for an additional NINE YEARS!!!! Talk about a huge mistake being made by NBC!One can only wonder what would have happened if the morons at ABC had actually given Tales of the Gold Monkey a second chance (second season) to find its audience.I think a lot of viewers were initially disappointed because they were expecting an action based ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" rip-off.

There's the former Flying Tiger pilot and his Grumman Goose flying boat; his mechanic buddy who can't remember anything; the urbane and droll French magistrate; a German spy masquerading as a priest whose time is spent bestowing ""blessings"" on the local native girls; a beautiful American singer who is really a government agent; and a one-eyed Jack Russel terrier named Jack that seems to be smarter than all of them combined.The period is the mid 1930's in the south Pacific islands run by the French.  Roddy McDowell is Louie, the droll magistrate who spends most of his time fining people for damage to his club, the Gold Monkey.  Jake Cutter (Stephen Collins) is his friend and a former Flying Tiger who flew against the Japanese in China prior to WWII.  His most prized possession is a well used Grumman Goose flying boat he uses to ply his trade as a bush pilot among the islands of the French Mandate.  Jake's mechanic has been with him since China, but he's a lush and can't remember much of anything.  But he's a lovable character (no doubt lifted from Walter Brennan's character in ""To Have and Have Not"") who manages to keep the Goose flying under the most adverse conditions.  There is lots of espionage intrigue bubbling beneath the surface.  The German preacher has a weakness for the beautiful native island girls who are always wanting him to ""bless"" them -- privately, of course.  He is barely able to find time to actually spy on the French, and frequently has encounters with a Japanese princess who fills the Mata Hari role.  Then there is the ditzy American agent who pretends she's a lounge singer and actress, and who is in love with Jake.This series is one of the dozens of TV shows from Donald Bellisario, and those familiar with his style of plotting and dialogue will immediately recognize it as such.  Plotting is not real intricate, but reasonably clever, and better than most of the shows from that era.  The characters are engaging, and the kind of people you'd want to hang out with if you were there.  Jack the dog is a hoot with his eye patch and barks for yes and no.  He frequently steals the show in fact.  The show was only one long season (21 episodes) but like so many of the TV shows from that period, didn't get picked up for renewal more because of impatience on the part of network execs and poor scheduling than lack of viewership.  It was one of my favorites at the time.

Number one, of course, you love flying fighters, but these days you have been reduced to island hopping, in the Pacific for hire, in a twin-engine seaplane that has clocked more flying hours then you would like to think; luckily you have a crackerjack mechanic, named Corky, who can keep the old Goose airworthy.You love baseball.  Before your flying days, you played for a Duluth team; alas, you can't do everything in life.  But then when your baseball idol - who looks strikingly like Babe Ruth - comes to your island, you get to fulfill your fantasy of pitching to the all-time great.You love Sarah who is pure as the driven snow, as they would say in the old movies; it vexes her greatly when other women would throw themselves at you, especially the hot hot-tubbing princess, but then the princess once called your one-eyed dog Jack, a cur!  Sarah would never say that; she loves your one-eyed dog.""Isn't that right Jack?""""Woof Woof!""Aircraft note: Cutter's goose looks like the same aircraft - with a different paint job - used to ferry guests to ""Fantasy Island.""Package warning:  There is a risk that your discs may become scratched; discs do not always remain on their mounts.History note:  These tales take place during 1938 and Jake's major background story was that he had been a ""Flying Tiger.""

641441,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00005JOJP,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[19, 21]","""Tales of the Gold Monkey"" is an easy show to make fun of. It is full of worn-out clich&eacute;s, embarrassing stereotypes, stupid dialogue, needless narration, bad blue screen effects, cruddy matte paintings, ill-fitting stock footage, archaic costumes, cringeworthy acting, fake sets and utterly preposterous plots. When people try to defend this series, they often begin by pretending as if this isn't so, and thus fatally weaken their argument. I would never make the case that ""Tales"" was great television. I would actually start by acknowledging that in many ways it was terrible television...and then explain just why that doesn't make (hardly) any difference.""Tales"" is a series which even in 1982 was a rare breed: the action-adventure show. It recreated a period in history (the last period in history, actually) when vast areas of the Earth were still unconquered, and thus adventure and exploration still possible. We forget it now, but there was a time within the living memory of some people when a large portion of this planet still slept in the pre-industrial era, and wandering too far off the map could get you eaten by cannibals, devoured by wild beasts, or plunk you down amidst the ruins of a lost city. When men and women who lived on the edge of that map literally straddled the line between civilization and savagery, the known world and the deep blue. It was an era of explorers, treasure-hunters, missionaries, smugglers, sailors, silk-scarfed pilots, drunken storytellers, one-eyed traders, pirate, crooks, spies, unscrupulous businessmen, and empire-builders. And that is what ""Tales of the Gold Monkey"" was all about. That brawling, half-tamed lawless time when half the world was an unknown quantity and wonder was still possible. Think ""Magnum P.I."" train-wrecked into ""Indiana Jones"" (with just a little ""Land of the Lost"" sprinkled on top) and you have ""Tales Of The Gold Monkey.""The premise was dead simple. An ex-Flying Tiger named Jake Cutter (Stephen Collins), his drunken, memory-challenged sidekick Corky (Jeff Mackay), and their one-eyed dog Jack (Leo the Dog) operate their seaplane, Cutter's Goose, out of the fictional island of Boragora, somewhere in the Marivellas Islands of the South Pacific. When they are not flying supplies, mail or passengers to this or that far-flung outpost in the French or Japanese mandates, they are belly-up at the Monkey Bar, which is operated by the island's enigmatic magistrate Bon Chance Louie (Ron Moody in the pilot, Roddy McDowell in the series). In the bar are likely to be found Sarah Stickney White (Caitlin O'Heany), a redheaded lounge singer and American spy; the Reverend Willie Tenboom (John Calvin), who is also a spy, albeit for Germany; and Gushie, a crippled ex-member of the Foreign Legion (Les Jankey). Pushing through the saloon doors every now and again are the villainous but charming Japanese princess Koji (the super-lovely Marta DuBois) and her grumpy samurai henchman Todo (John Fujioka, in full samurai rig). With a group like this, where nearly everyone is hiding secrets from each other and unknowingly working at cross-purposes, you just know all sorts of wacky adventures are going to ensue, and believe me, they do. Over the course of the season (sadly, the only one the show ever produced), Jake & Co. come up against slavers, spies, cultists, boys raised by apes, treasure hunters, giant octopi, rebel insurgents, angry mobs, and pretty much anything else you can think of. It's incredibly silly, cheesy, clich&eacute;d and outlandish, ripping off from just about every old movie and Western you can think of, and often looking as if it were shot entirely on dusty old sets on Universal Studios backlot...but it's also great, great fun. ""Tales"" is a show that made up for in heart and good, clean adventure what it lacked in other places. Though it was shot in 1982, it was essentially the product of a much earlier era, the era of the adventure tales written for boys and young men back in pulp magazines the 20s, 30s and 40s, which Bellasario undoubtedly grew up on, and that sense of lighthearted, fistfights are fun, don't-worry-it's-just-a-flesh-wound heroics percolates all throughout the series.The age we live in is cynical, and cynicism is the opposite of wonder. Kids nowadays sit in front of first-person shooter video games, YouTube and Facebook with glassed-over eyes, and seldom get a chance to flex the adventure-muscles that are every child's absolute birthright. If you're a parent of a youngish kid, ""Tales"" is as good an antidote for today's world as anything out there. And if you happened to be growing up in the early 80s, it's a fabulous flight down memory lane.",4,See you in the Monkey Bar!,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,4695,"['Tales', 'Gold', 'Monkey', 'easy',

641456,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B00005JOJP,Terry Sunday,"[12, 14]","The DVDs in my media cabinet prove that I'm a sucker for short-lived television series. With few exceptions, any series that I think is good gets the axe after only one or two seasons. Here are some cases in point. ""Firefly,"" the outstanding, cerebral sci-fi series, lasted less than a season. ""The Lone Gunmen,"" an X-Files spinoff, bit the dust after 13 episodes. The superb ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" was ignominiously cancelled by shortsighted Fox bean-counters after a season and a half. The edgy, groundbreaking ""Dollhouse"" fared no better. There are other examples, but you get my point.So I had high hopes for ""Tales of the Gold Monkey: The Complete Series,"" which ran for one season of 21 episodes in 1982. I don't know why, but I never watched it when it originally aired. I never even heard of it until I saw this DVD set. But the description pressed all my buttons. Everything about the series seemed calculated to fire up my interest. It takes place in 1938, on the eve of World War II, a time period that I find endlessly fascinating. It features action, adventure, international intrigue and exotic locations in a backwater corner of the South Pacific. It has a cast of interesting characters who would fit right in with Indiana Jones. And, best of all, one of the ""stars"" is a well-used Grumman ""Goose"" amphibian (okay, ""seaplane""). It's a real airplane, with genuine noisy, temperamental, smoke-belching radial engines, and it really flies--there's no CGI here. What's not to like?Having now watched some but not all of the episodes, I have mixed feelings. First, the quality of the DVD set is outstanding. The six single-sided disks are securely packaged in a sturdy case on hinged partitions that protect them from damage. Inside is a glossy 24-page booklet with a short overview of the series and synopses of all the episodes, with credits and a small color photo from each one. Extras include a 36-minute ""Making of..."" documentary, audio commentaries on five episodes, cast and character biographies, stills galleries and a few other items. But what about the episodes themselves? Here I think perhaps my expectations were too lofty. The stories are okay, but the production values are a bit lacking and the pacing is fairly slow some of the time, especially in the 1-1/2-hour pilot, which seems padded by about 15 minutes. I do enjoy watching the episodes, but they're not the best thing I've ever seen. I'd call this series ""typical '80s television,"" with all that the term implies, both good and bad. My most serious issue is with the soundtracks. The dialogue is so quiet that I have to crank the volume way up, but then the music comes in so loud that it almost blows out my speakers. A little level equalization would have been nice.So, if you fondly remember watching ""Tales of the Gold Monkey"" when it aired, I'm sure you won't be disappointed with this set. If, like me, you were not familiar with the series, it's still a good purchase, as long as you keep your expectations in line with the time when it was made. I think the decade of the '80s was a transition period for television in many ways. It was neither ""classic"" nor ""modern,"" but something in between. There are very few shows from that time that I find worth owning. ""Tales of the Gold Monkey"" is a rare exception.",4,"Action, Adventure and Espionage in the Pre-World-War-II South Pacific",1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,3324,"['DVDs', 'media', 'cabinet', 'prove', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'short-lived', 'television', 'series', 'few', 'exceptions', 'series', 'think', 'good', 'axe', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'seasons', 'Here', 'are', 'cases', 'point', 'Firefly', 'outstanding', 'cerebral', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'lasted', 'less', 'season', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'X-Files', 'spinoff', 'bit', 'dust', '13', 'episodes', 'superb', 'Terminator', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'Chronicles', 'was', 'ignominiously', 'cancelled', 'shortsighted', 'Fox', 'bean-counters', 'season', 'half', 'edgy', 'groundbreaking', 'Dollhouse', 'fared', 'better', 'are', 'other', 'examples', 'get', 'point.So', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Tales', 'Gold', 'Monkey', 'Complete', 'Series', 'ran', 'one', 'season', '21', 'episodes', '1982', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'never', 'watched', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'saw', 'DVD', 'set', 'description', 'pressed', 'buttons', 'Everything', 'series', 'seemed', 'calculated', 'fire', 'up', 'interest', 'place', '1938', 'eve', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'time', 'period', 'find', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'action', 'adventure', 'international', 'intrigue', 'exotic', 'locations', 'backwater', 'corner', 'South', 'Pacific', 'cast', 'interesting', 'characters', 'who', 'would', 'fit', 'right', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'best', 'one', 'stars', 'well-used', 'Grumman', 'Goose', 'amphibian', 'okay', 'seaplane', 'real', 'airplane', 'genuine', 'noisy', 'temperamental', 'smoke-belching', 'radial', 'engines', 'really', 'CGI', 'here', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'Having', 'now', 'watched', 'not', 'episodes', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'First', 'quality', 'DVD', 'set', 'outstanding', 'six', 'single-sided', 'disks', 'are', 'securely', 'packaged', 'sturdy', 'case', 'hinged', 'partitions', 'protect', 'damage', 'Inside', 'glossy', '24-page', 'booklet', 'short', 'overview', 'series', 'synopses', 'episodes', 'credits', 'small', 'color', 'photo', 'one', 'Extras', 'include', '36-minute', 'Making', 'documentary', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'five', 'episodes', 'cast', 'character', 'biographies', 'stills', 'galleries', 'few', 'other', 'items', 'what', 'episodes', 'Here', 'think', 'perhaps', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'lofty', 'stories', 'are', 'okay', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'bit', 'lacking', 'pacing', 'fairly', 'slow', 'time', 'especially', '1-1/2-hour', 'pilot', 'padded', '15', 'minutes', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'not', 'best', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'d"", 'call', 'series', 'typical', ""'80s"", 'television', 'term', 'implies', 'good', 'bad', 'most', 'serious', 'issue', 'soundtracks', 'dialogue', 'so', 'quiet', 'have', 'crank', 'volume', 'way', 'then', 'music', 'so', 'loud', 'almost', 'out', 'speakers', 'little', 'level', 'equalization', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.So', 'fondly', 'remember', 'watching', 'Tales', 'Gold', 'Monkey', 'when', 'aired', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'set', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'series', 'still', 'good', 'purchase', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'expectations', 'line', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'think', 'decade', ""'80s"", 'was', 'transition', 'period', 'television', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'classic', 'modern', 'something', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'time', 'find', 'worth', 'owning', 'Tales', 'Gold', 'Monkey', 'rare', 'exception']",N/A

I remember the show when it first aired on TV back in the early 1980's, although I never watched it at the time.  The title was somewhat odd, but it had a beautiful girl and one eyed dog in it as I recalled.  Now nearly thirty years later, I ran across it on sale and purchased the DVD set to see what I had missed back then.  In my opinion, it was not one of the greatest series ever made, but was very entertaining in a fun and campy way.  The costumes and sets brought back the atmosphere of the 1930's and the scenes of the Grumman Goose and long gone Boeing 314 ""Pacific Clipper"" were most welcome.That said, the historic timeline of the Jake Cutter character's flying past was way off.  Being set in 1938, Jake was portrayed as a former member of the American Volunteer Group, the AVG aka The Flying Tigers, American Army Air Corps or Navy pilots who resigned from their respective branches to basically become mercenaries recruited by U.S. General Claire Chennault to fight against the Japanese for the Nationalist Chinese Government led by General Chaing Kai-shek.  The AVG was formed on July 4, 1941 and the Curtiss P-40 which they flew was not flight tested until late 1938, so Jake could not have been an ex-Flying Tiger because they didn't even exist yet!  However, that fact does not detract from the show's entertainment qualities, nor does the numerous visual blunders that crept into several of the episodes.  Jack, the dog appears in two different places at the same time in more than one episode, a Boeing 314 floating on the water suddenly becomes a Martin 130 when it takes off, a twin funneled ocean liner in motion transforms into a three stacked ship at rest, etc.  In one scene where three men are supposedly standing naked before Princess Koji, the camera pans too low and shows the actors wearing shorts with their hands crossed in front of their crotches to cover up nothing showing.  This only makes the show more interesting as it gives the viewer something to look for and yell, ""Aha, gotcha again!"" An extra treat for me was discovering that the gorgeous Marta DuBois was a regular on this show and it's too bad that she and the almost as beautiful Caitlin O'Heaney did not get into a hair pulling, clothes ripping catfight over Jake.Unfortunately, Tales of The Gold Monkey lasted only one short season, when it deserved more years.
