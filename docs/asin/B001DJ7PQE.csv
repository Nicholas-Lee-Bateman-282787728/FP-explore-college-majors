Course, when I seen that Jerry Lewis was doing a voice in the movie, I decided to get the DVD. To be sure, Jerry Lewis wouldn't do something like this if it didn't do his original vision justice. Well, I was right in that assumption. This movie, even though it is directed more towards kids, is a fun CGI film that is nearly on par with the likes of ""Open Season"" and ""Ice Age"" with some pretty decent CGI.The plot, itself, is about a kid named Harold Kelp.  When his grandfather, Julius,  offers him the opportunity to attend a high tech school, the boy jumps at the chance. Hoping to impress a girl he has his eye on, he works on a class project to build-race and win an annual school bike challenge but he fails.  When he stumbles across his grandfather's database, he learns of a formula that can make him charismatic, and coordinated. Yet, the potion soon unleashes his deepest and darkest fears & that's when things get interesting.While it may not be Pixar quality CGI and filmmaking, it still is a fun and decent romp into the world of The Nutty Professor again. I highly recommend it. I think kids and adults will like this take. I loved it. I really loved it!!!",4,The Nutty Professor.........,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,1294,"['must', 'admit', 'was', 'intrigued', 'yet', 'little', 'skeptical', 'when', 'seen', 'CGI', 'version', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'Course', 'when', 'seen', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'was', 'doing', 'voice', 'movie', 'decided', 'get', 'DVD', 'be', 'sure', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'original', 'vision', 'justice', 'Well', 'was', 'right', 'assumption', 'movie', 'even', 'directed', 'more', 'towards', 'kids', 'fun', 'CGI', 'film', 'nearly', 'par', 'likes', 'Open', 'Season', 'Ice', 'Age', 'pretty', 'decent', 'CGI.The', 'plot', 'kid', 'named', 'Harold', 'Kelp', 'When', 'grandfather', 'Julius', 'opportunity', 'attend', 'high', 'tech', 'school', 'boy', 'jumps', 'chance', 'Hoping', 'impress', 'girl', 'eye', 'class', 'project', 'build-race', 'win', 'annual', 'school', 'bike', 'challenge', 'When', 'grandfather', 'database', 'formula', 'can', 'make', 'charismatic', 'coordinated', 'potion', 'soon', 'deepest', 'darkest', 'fears', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Pixar', 'quality', 'CGI', 'filmmaking', 'still', 'fun', 'decent', 'romp', 'world', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'think', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'like', 'take', 'loved', 'really', 'loved']",The Nutty Professor

I watched it and man I knew he wouldn't do it unless he could have it done in his ""unique"" way and I wasn't disappointed. This is kinda of a sequel from the original in 1963 with Stella Stevens, Jerry Lewis, and Kathleen Morgan. His grandson has failed at a competition and is trying to impress a girl he likes. Well, he finds his grandfather's Buddy Love juice I'll call it and and tries it on himself and the results are close to that of when professor Kelp tried it in 1963. Loved the originality, Jerry Lewis, and also some pretty good CGI for this family style movie.
