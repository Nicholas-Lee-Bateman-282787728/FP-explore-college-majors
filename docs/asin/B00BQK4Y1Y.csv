However, I think its more important to review the DVD itself at this point.  Each of the last three seasons I have experienced serious problems with at least one disc.  The season 6 part 2 blu-ray third disc contained errors that would not allow me to get past the first few minutes of the first episode and the other episodes would not play either.Season 7 had similar issues on two discs but my dvd player was able to fight through them.Season 8 part 2 contained a new error.  On the last disc the video play back halted every few seconds,  however the audio played fine.  This resulted in the audio gradually getting further and further ahead of the video and basically unwatchable episodes.The systems for holding the discs in place in the DVD cases (which for some reason they change every year) have also been week and/or damaged on several other seasons.I own every season and the two full length Halloween specials.  However, the last three season's DVD/blu-rays having these issues makes it unlikely that I will continue this.  Syfy needs to get its act together and produce quality products or they will have lost a loyal viewer/customer.  On top of all this they don't even offer the episodes for digital download/viewing.I won't tell you to not to buy this.  However, I will tell you not to buy it if you don't want to deal with the possibility sending it back.",2,This review pertains to the quality of the DVD not the show,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1455,"['love', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'was', 'reviewing', 'show', 'would', 'show', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'think', 'more', 'important', 'review', 'DVD', 'point', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'experienced', 'serious', 'problems', 'least', 'one', 'disc', 'season', '6', 'part', '2', 'blu-ray', 'third', 'disc', 'contained', 'errors', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'get', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'first', 'episode', 'other', 'episodes', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'either.Season', '7', 'had', 'similar', 'issues', 'two', 'discs', 'dvd', 'player', 'was', 'able', 'fight', 'them.Season', '8', 'part', '2', 'contained', 'new', 'error', 'last', 'disc', 'video', 'play', 'back', 'halted', 'few', 'seconds', 'however', 'audio', 'played', 'fine', 'resulted', 'audio', 'gradually', 'getting', 'further', 'further', 'ahead', 'video', 'basically', 'unwatchable', 'episodes.The', 'systems', 'holding', 'discs', 'place', 'DVD', 'cases', 'reason', 'change', 'year', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'week', 'and/or', 'damaged', 'several', 'other', 'seasons.I', 'own', 'season', 'two', 'full', 'length', 'Halloween', 'specials', 'However', 'last', 'three', 'season', 'DVD/blu-rays', 'having', 'issues', 'unlikely', 'will', 'continue', 'Syfy', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'produce', 'quality', 'products', 'will', 'have', 'lost', 'loyal', 'viewer/customer', 'top', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'offer', 'episodes', 'digital', 'download/viewing.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'not', 'buy', 'However', 'will', 'tell', 'not', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'possibility', 'sending', 'back']",Ghost Hunters: Season 8: Part 2
