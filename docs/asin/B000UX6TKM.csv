Fonzie becomes bigger in the U.S.A. in 1976-77 than Spiderman is now.  For the record the show hits #1 at a price.  The previous two seasons had a presentation like a movie on the small screen.  Beginning in season #3 Happy Days starts to portray itself like a high level stand-up comedy act with perfect timing.  The decision to primarily film in front of a live studio audience was a bad one.  Most of the funny outdoor scenes like the midnight drag race and Marsha knocking off the female mannequin are history.  Paramount also should have held back the release of the spin-off Laverne & Shirley on DVD.  We get their introduction.  The problem is Happy Days came out in 1974 and Laverne & Shirley in 1976.  The order is messed up on DVD.  Besides the debut of Pat Morita, my favorite episodes in seasons #3 are ""Fonzie Moving In"" and ""Fearless Fonzarelli"". See how much different Happy Days is when they branch outside for a change. Sadly it took a motorcycle jump over 14 garbage cans to mix things up.  I still loved the show.  It was better in season #2.  More Fonzie, yes!

While I haven't reviewed season 4 yet, I think this is much better than Season 2 and even Season 1 on DVD.  Filming is excellently transferred to DVD, very vivid colors and great film transfer.The shows are supper funny.  Very good writing.  The characters are all fully developed by now, and it's fun to see early appearances from currently well known actors like Jeff Conaway (Ritchie Fights Back), and others.  Ritchie's sister seemed like such a baby in the first two season, but she seems like a full-fledged teen in this season; makes me wonder if they ""babied"" up her appearance in the first two seasons.  She's very funny in this season, and not such a ""little girl"" annoying anymore.Where's Ritchie's older brother?  Killed in a war?  Off to the NBA?  Funmny, I know this disappearance is well discussed on all the message boards, but you gotta admit, it's probably more discerned, but less noticed than even the ""jumping the shark"" bit by Fonzie in a later season.I highly recommend this season for purchase, or even rental.  My wife bought it for me, for Christmas, and I'm well into the 2nd disc.  The 4 disc set includes a very nifty space saving 1 plastic case holder, and the discs all fit nicely into the packaging.

It is a hilarious show with all the actors giving energy and originality to the stories. Henry Winkler really does steal the show. Sure, by today's standards, he is kinda boorish, but it's great fun to see him flex his muscles as Fonz. And this was before the show started getting really silly.The following seasons were progressively worse but still not awful. The problem is they all became caricatures of themselves. In every episode Ralph would say 'I still got it' after saying a bad joke. Potsie would sing. Richie would make that laugh or sing 'Ive found my thrill'.

1097377,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000UX6TKM,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[12, 19]","Okay, we still contend with amazingly flimsy DVD cases (as if the technology just came out!). But the 24 episode 1975-1976 season is the closest I've gotten to once again seeing a cherished series in its full glory, including yes, the original music performances by Anson Williams himself.Continuing with the `consciousness raising' he himself had began last season with an intended marriage; Fonzie voluntarily agrees to enter a dance contest with Marion (""Dance Contest""). The multiple references to Marion being bored and then having an affair to break up the routine of her daily life allude to the 1970's displaced homemaker's movement. We do not know if she has picked up and flipped through Betty Friedan's ""The Feminine Mystique"" or other books. But we do know that things are not as ideal as were mythologized in more traditional 1950's sitcoms!Fonzie himself assumes a prominent role during this season---moving into the apartment right above the Cunningham garage to maximize screen time to the greatest extent possible. The original plan was to have his Grandmother Nussbaum take the room, initially so the Cunninghams would compensate for lost revenue against a newly opened local outpost of a national mega-chain (""Fonzie Moves In""). It was threatening the viability of Cunningham Hardware.But she could not make the move and ethics problems prevented the mega chain from expanding in Wisconsin. So the accommodation was for him to become their apartment tenant. Their impromptu arrangement also makes it convenient for the Fonz to now appear at the Cunningham household to quickly dispense advice--or save the day. Fonzie quickly went from a bit part to attracting near thunderous cheers from the now live audience.  Richie was excited about getting essentially a new big brother. Chuck is gone, never to be referenced again!But Howard was anxious about the arrangement. He realized that Fonize's moving in required some adjustment on everybody's part during this first year--including Fonzie.  This Howard Cunningham is one of the knowledgeable fathers who you could feel good about turning to in a crisis.  He's obviously not a fuddy-duddy himself either.The person who is a fuddy-duddy is Officer Kirk (deliciously played by Ed Peck), making his first appearance in ""Jailhouse Rock"". Milwaukee is a big city, even by 1950's population standards. But for some reason, this police officer takes it upon himself to be the sole arbiter of morality. Out of everything which could and probally did happen, he was actually most threatened by teens being out after dark, so a curfew was enacted against them.  Inadvertently getting tangled up in Kirk's world view of `law and order' Howard finally concedes that being the grand poobah of a lodge in a fascist society would not be worth anything.Adding some drama to the television sitcom, Fonzie becomes an informant for Officer Kirk of all people! This and Henry Winkler lifting weights are the interesting parts of the episode. Contemporary police dramas and their watchers know that informants do not go back to their former group publically dressed out in police uniform--they instantly stick out like a sore thumb and the cover is blown! Still, I suppose it was the thought that mattered with this particular episode. The writers wanted to show that Fonzie had dramatic tension despite now being good. Hanging out with clean cut guys is not at all the same as always having been one.He makes another valiant attempt when Herb sells the auto shop (""Fonzie the Salesman""). Since this career has essentially now been killed courtesy of the Internet, it definitely dates the series. In addition to being an anal retentive neat nick who apparently does not get the concept of `grease monkey', the new owner wants the Fonz to gasp--get a crew cut! He is moderately successful selling books door-to-door, meeting lonely women, but truthfully needs to work on cars. The episode is finally interesting because it's one of the few times in this series where the Fonz's hair is yes, uncombed!And then people who Richie believed were `hip', decide to boycott a party just because there is an African American band player (""Fonzie's New Friend""). Apparently in Wisconsin, the mere mixing of races was considered that controversial in the 1950's. Again, retrospect provides subtle---but powerful sociopolitical critique in a supposedly apolitical sitcom about a theoretically innocent era.  Fonzie is a very well connected guy for the era; not only is he friends with different races, but he is then able to hook Sticks up with an African American woman, also suggesting that he knew women of other races.But with this new idolization also comes new responsibility (""Tell it to the Marines""). Fonzie learns that the comments which he makes now get taken very seriously by the people around him.  After a girl breaks up with him, a despondent Ralph decides to join the military, after Fonz unwittingly talked him into it. Living with people and being part of a crowd has a cost! While it's possible that the military would provide a growth experience for Ralph, going through life not accountable for the power which his words had over other people would also have made the Fonz (and his real life counterpart) the worst kind of role model imaginable. An ego-manaic celebrity!And then ""Bringing Up Spike"" confirms he can't pawn off HIS responsibilities on other people even when he is frustrated and does not know what to immediately do. This season is good yes, because it shows Fonzie as flawed and immediately relatable to audiences. He is not a superhero who just happens to wear a leather jacket.One of the clumsy examples of working in 70's inferences was ""Richie Fights Back"". Attempting to initially address the off-screen phenomena's both of Fonzie-mania and Asian American awareness, it did not adequately explain the latter. It would have perhaps been more in line with the times to explain why `Matsuo Takahashi' had really Americanized his name to 'Arnold' during that era. Sure, the kids accept him as long as he keeps serving up their food, but what additional barriers was he facing?The second anniversary show is included and I guess this is technically an extra, as it was with the series. The filming of this season looks to be carried out in good quality. The accurate title credits are used and the original music is included. Some people claim that portions of episodes were removed, but I honestly cannot tell the difference.  I really want there to be a fourth season.",5,Our dinner sundaes are yummy!,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,6542,"['Okay', 'still', 'contend', 'amazingly', 'flimsy', 'DVD', 'cases', 'technology',

1097379,A2SDM2D1X3HE7Z,B000UX6TKM,take403,"[3, 3]","This is the 3rd season, the one season when I became a fan of the show. I remember begging my mother to buy me a Fonzie T-shirt at the local store! Here, you have Fonzie (Henry Winkler) co-starring with Richie (Ron Howard), along with their buddies Ralph Malph (Donnie Most) and Potsie (Anson Williams) and sister Joanie (Erin Moran), mother Marion (Marion Ross) and father Howard (the late Tom Bosley). I had to dock it one star because the endings of Fonzie's New Friend and A Date With Fonzie are missing (I hope if this is ever released on Blu-Ray, the omission will be rectified, that and re-storing the music in Season 2 to its original). Also, the popular song ""Happy Days"" makes its debut at the opening (though it was used as background music and the ending theme as early as Season 1. Fonzie debuts his catchphrase ""Aaaaay!,"" Ralph debuts his catchphrase ""I still got it,"" Potsie is known as much by his singing abilities as his occasional dopey actions (""You're such a Potsie, Potsie!"") and Richie debuts his theme song ""I found my thri-i-ill on blueberry hi-i-ill!"" and his sarcastic ""Huh! Huh! Huh!"" laugh.In the opening episode, Fonzie Moves In, Fonzie rents out the room in the Cunninghams' garage and becomes a part of the family (though Howard naturally has his reservations). In Two Angry Men, Fonzie builds a roost for his pigeons on the roof and the roof caves, leaving Fonzie to sue Mr. Cunningham and Howard counter-sues (June Lockhart plays the judge). A Date With Fonzie marks the debut of characters Laverne (Penny Marshall) and Shirley (Cindy Williams), who would earn their own show later that season in 1976 (""'Laverne, you have a mouth like a sewer', I said. So she curls up her chubby little fist and BAM!"" knocking down Richie who's just brought in refreshments). Bringing Up Spike features Fonzie's carbon copy nephew Spike (Danny Butch), who would later disappear without any references (""So Chachi, how's my other nephew Spike doing? He's got a homecoming date? Whoa!""). Fonz realizes the need to be a father figure after Spike is the accessory of a crime. Potsie plays Richie in The Other Richie Cunningham, when Howard forces Richard to take out a client's daughter, though Richie already has a date (and Potsie's not much a gentleman and gets the real Richie in trouble!). Richie tries to stand up to 2 bullies in Richie Fights Back (""Don't ever grab me again!""). In The Motorcycle, Ralph accidentally totals Fonzie's bike and must face the wrath of the Fonz! Fearless Fonzarelli features (as well as Pat Morita's debut as the lovable Arnold) the Fonz riding his motorcycle over a series of garbage cans (a 2-part episode, the ending of the 1st part features the Fonz getting ready to jump (not the shark- yet!). Fonzie's New Friend features an African American named Sticks (John Anthony-Bailey) and the town just isn't ready for him. Arnold's Wedding features Arnold getting married to a young Asian lady who gets cold feet (and Fonzie has cold feet about being the best man). Joanie develops a crush on Potsie after he croons ""Put Your Head On My Shoulder"" to her (""Things'll be different when I'm 22 and you're 19,"" Potsie politely tells Joanie). Howard's 45th Fiasco shows a self-conscious Howard fearing getting old. In Tell It To The Marine, Ralph gets turned down and considers enlisting in the Marines (with the Fonz's encouragement) and it's up to the Fonz to talk him out of it (""I admit I was r-r-r-r...""- the opposite of right, a word the Fonz has trouble saying). In Jailhouse Rock, Officer Kirk (Ed Peck) lays down the new curfew and when Richie and his friends are locked inside Arnold's past 10pm, he arrests them all on the spot (along with Howard for wearing a silly Leopard skin cap). But in Fonzie The Flatfoot, Kirk pardons Howard's numerous parking tickets and approves a parking area on the condition the Fonz serve duty to break up a rumble (Richie does a brief imitation of the Fonz, much to Fonzie's chagrin). In A Sight For Sore Eyes, Fonzie learns he needs glasses (and Potsie is nominated for King Fool and Richie, while away in Chicago, meets a nice Texan belle, also Jack Dodson plays Ralph's father, who's an optometrist). Fonzie tries getting a new job after his job as a mechanic requires a crewcut from his new boss (Dick Van Patten makes a guest appearance). In Three On A Porch, Richie, Potsie and Ralph pretend they're older so they can reserve a place at Uncle Tom's Cabin for Spring break (Richie's ""older"" voice is a scream, as are the accents of the 3 ""Tunisians"" who try to impress 3 beautiful women they share the porch with). Marion enters a dance contest and Arthur (the Fonz, of course) willingly agrees to be her partner, leading to rumors, speculations and a swift boot from ""Shortcake"" Joanie!. Richie and his friends (and little Spike) try to get tickets they cannot afford to a football game, so they wind up babysitting a few kids at the Cunningham house in order to raise money. Fonzie attempts to sing in Fonzie The Superstar (he narrates rather than sings ""Heartbreak Hotel""). In one of my favorite episodes, Beauty Contest, Richie, Potsie and Ralph host a faux beauty contest promising prizes they cannot afford to give, just so they can meet women! Potsie serenades the not-so-lucky ""winner"" with ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World."" Finally, at The Second Anniversary Show, the gang hosts a surprise birthday party for the Fonz where they reminisce about past episodes.So there you have it- one of the 1st seasons to make it big-

Objectivity is difficult, but I (and some other viewers who have posted, as well) found Season 2 to be relatively not-so-well-written, and, worse, boring and dry at many turns. Sure, it was shot film style ... and, yes, ""every episode is like a little movie,"" etc. ...But, Season 3 leaps off the page. The energy is so palpable you become a part of it. And, I think Season 3 is the raciest and sexiest of all the seasons (sometimes downright - and very UN-Happy Days-esque, naughty). It is truly the peak of Fonzie mania, and it captures the Winkler/Howard/Williams/Most fab four at their rawest. Tom Bosley's character has an edge (and layers) in this season that the writers never really gave him again. After watching Season 2, pop in Season 3 and I defy you to miss it: it's live, it's raw, it's exciting ... and funny as all hell. Probably the most laugh-out-loud season of all eleven. Purists may be purists, but I truly believe if Happy Days had stuck to the first formula (one-camera with canned laughter), it wouldn't have seen a fourth season. Happy Days was quite Darwinian. It morphed into a variety of shapes to survive 11 seasons. Like some, I love them all, and all for different reasons. Garry Marshall said, ""I just wanted to create a group of people that you'd want to welcome into your home every week."" He sure did. These kinds of heartwarming shows just don't exist anymore. At least we have these DVD sets!",5,"Happy Days, Season 3",1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1589,"['appreciate', 'who', 'hold', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'such', 'high', 'reverence', 'expense', 'live', 'audience', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'terribly', 'deserved', 'Objectivity', 'difficult', 'other', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'posted', 'well', 'found', 'Season', '2', 'be', 'relatively', 'not-so-well-written', 'worse', 'boring', 'dry', 'many', 'turns', 'Sure', 'was', 'shot', 'film', 'style', 'yes', 'episode', 'little', 'movie', 'etc', 'Season', '3', 'leaps', 'page', 'energy', 'so', 'palpable', 'become', 'part', 'think', 'Season', '3', 'raciest', 'sexiest', 'seasons', 'sometimes', 'downright', 'very', 'UN-Happy', 'Days-esque', 'naughty', 'truly', 'peak', 'Fonzie', 'mania', 'Winkler/Howard/Williams/Most', 'fab', 'four', 'rawest', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'character', 'edge', 'layers', 'season', 'writers', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'again', 'watching', 'Season', '2', 'pop', 'Season', '3', 'defy', 'miss', 'live', 'raw', 'exciting', 'funny', 'hell', 'Probably', 'most', 'laugh-out-loud', 'season', 'eleven', 'Purists', 'may', 'be', 'purists', 'truly', 'believe', 'Happy', 'Days', 'had', 'stuck', 'first', 'formula', 'one-camera', 'canned', 'laughter', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'fourth', 'season', 'Happy', 'Days', 'was', 'quite', 'Darwinian', 'morphed', 'variety', 'shapes', 'survive', '11', 'seasons', 'love', 'different', 'reasons', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'said', 'just', 'wanted', 'create', 'group', 'people', ""'d"", 'want', 'welcome', 'home', 'week', 'sure', 'did', 'kinds', 'heartwarming', 'shows', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore', 'least', 'have', 'DVD', 'sets']",Happy Days: Season 3
1097382,AQYSBQWES50MO,B000UX6TKM,VWC,"[27, 28]","This, in my opinion, is the best season of Happy Days.  The writing was outstanding and Henry Winkler was at his peak.  THIS is the season that should have ranked as the #1 show on television (it finished at #11, season four is the one that reached the top).  There is one problem with the DVD though.  Certain episodes (very few...I think) are edited.  One of my all-time favorite scenes is missing.  It is the end tag of the episode titled ""Fonzie's New Friend"".  This is where Fonzie does the limbo.  But it's gone....why?  I also noticed a couple of edits here and there on one or two other episodes.  The sad thing is that this is probably the only form these episodes will ever be released in.  Yet, we won't ever be able to see certain parts of some episodes.  Sad.On a lighter note, I recently had the opportunity to see the Happy Days house when I was in Hollywood.  Of course this was just used for the exterior shots, but it hasn't changed much.  If you're ever out there and you're interested in seeing it, it's easy to find.  I can't give you the house address here (especially since people actually live there) but it's easy to research on the internet.",3,WHY DID THEY EDIT CERTAIN EPISODES???,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,1167,"['opinion', 'best', 'season', 'Happy', 'Days', 'writing', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'was', 'peak', 'THIS', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'ranked', '1', 'show', 'television', 'finished', '11', 'season', 'four', 'one', 'reached', 'top', 'one', 'problem', 'DVD', 'Certain', 'episodes', 'very', 'few', 'think', 'are', 'edited', 'One', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'missing', 'end', 'tag', 'episode', 'titled', 'Fonzie', 'New', 'Friend', 'where', 'Fonzie', 'limbo', 'gone', '.why', 'also', 'noticed', 'couple', 'edits', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'episodes', 'sad', 'thing', 'probably', 'only', 'form', 'episodes', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'certain', 'parts', 'episodes', 'Sad.On', 'lighter', 'note', 'recently', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Happy', 'Days', 'house', 'when', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'course', 'was', 'just', 'used', 'exterior', 'shots', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', ""'re"", 'ever', 'there', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'easy', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'house', 'address', 'here', 'especially', 'people', 'actually', 'live', 'easy', 'research', 'internet']",Happy Days: Season 3
