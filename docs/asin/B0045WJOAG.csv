1385888,A1WXCMB52BON8N,B0045WJOAG,A Customer,"[11, 15]","My nomination for the best British comedy series since 'The Office' and 'Extras' - except that the script writer Graham Lineham is Irish, so it might not count as a purely British show. He also co-wrote 'Father Ted' and 'Black Books', both of them good for a laugh, but The IT Crowd is the funniest of the three.As with 'Black Books', the three main protagonists are a cynical Irishman, a niceguy-nerd, and a slightly dizzy female professional. However, the IT department at the basement of the Reynholm Industries skyscraper is a far cry from Bernard's shop in 'Black Books'.In this first 'IT Crowd' series, the aforementioned female professional Jen is made head of the IT department, the only problem being that she knows nothing about computers. Half the series consists of her trying to get along with the two workers (who eat, sleep and breathe computers), the very weird boss, and the goth in the basement. It might not sound so funny on paper, but the sheer creativity of the script, as well as the strong mannerisms of the actors, breathe life into it.The second series is even funnier than the first, especially episode one 'The Work Outing', which had me in stitches. Other episodes revolve around German cannibals, extra-vibrating phones, film piracy warnings, unfortunate surnames, and spontaneously combusting bras. Not to mention the boss's insanely lecherous son, who arrives to take over the corporation, developing a fixation on Jen, who he describes as a ""hoochie-toochie humdinging coochie mama...""The third series is excellent, as Roy and Moss try to be 'real blokes' by learning football-speak; Jen tries to catch out a builder she suspects is urinating in her sink; Douglas is forced to wear 'electric sex pants' that shock him whenever he has arousing thoughts (as part of an out-of-court harassment settlement with Jen after the Rohypnol incident in series two); Roy has to trick Moss and his geek friends to pose for a 'sexy calendar'; and in my favourite episode, Jen's addiction to a social networking site called Friendface ends in disaster.The fourth series isn't quite so laugh-out-loud funny as the second and third, however it definitely still has its moments, with some crazed plots ideas just as inspired as those of previous instalments. Scenarios include Jen hooking up with the zombie-like keyboard player of a rock group; Douglas becoming a 'spaceologist' in a send-up of scientology; Jen pretending she is a skilled interpreter, then having to bluff her way out of it when her instant translation program breaks down; and Douglas trying to divorce his wife and being forced to air his Star Trek-themed homemade sex tapes in court. Come to think of it, most of the best bits in this series seem to involve Douglas or Jen rather than Roy or Moss, although the latter still have some presence by virtue of their unmistakable personalities.'IT Crowd' is required viewing for comedy fans. I haven't laughed so hard in ages.A couple of the actors from this also star in a lesser-known but also very funny British comedy called 'Garth Marengi's Darkplace'.",5,A few things you should know about 'The IT Crowd',1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,3089,"['nomination', 'best', 'British', 'comedy', 'series', ""'The"", 'Office', ""'Extras"", 'script', 'writer', 'Graham', 'Lineham', 'Irish', 'might', 'not', 'count', 'purely', 'British', 'show', 'also', 'co-wrote', ""'Father"", 'Ted', 'Books', 'good', 'laugh', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'funniest', 'three.As', ""'Black"", 'Books', 'three', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'cynical', 'Irishman', 'niceguy-nerd', 'slightly', 'dizzy', 'female', 'professional', 'However', 'IT', 'department', 'basement', 'Reynholm', 'Industries', 'skyscraper', 'far', 'cry', 'Bernard', 'shop', ""Books'.In"", 'first', 'Crowd', 'series', 'aforementioned', 'female', 'professional', 'Jen', 'made', 'head', 'IT', 'department', 'only', 'problem', 'being', 'nothing', 'computers', 'series', 'trying', 'get', 'two', 'workers', 'who', 'eat', 'sleep', 'breathe', 'computers', 'very', 'weird', 'boss', 'goth', 'basement', 'might', 'not', 'sound', 'so', 'funny', 'paper', 'sheer', 'creativity', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'mannerisms', 'actors', 'breathe', 'life', 'it.The', 'second', 'series', 'even', 'funnier', 'first', 'especially', 'episode', 'one', 'Work', 'Outing', 'had', 'stitches', 'Other', 'episodes', 'revolve', 'German', 'cannibals', 'extra-vibrating', 'phones', 'film', 'piracy', 'warnings', 'unfortunate', 'surnames', 'spontaneously', 'combusting', 'bras', 'Not', 'mention', 'boss', 'insanely', 'lecherous', 'son', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'corporation', 'developing', 'fixation', 'Jen', 'who', 'hoochie-toochie', 'humdinging', 'coochie', 'mama', 'third', 'series', 'excellent', 'Roy', 'Moss', 'try', 'be', ""'real"", 'blokes', 'learning', 'football-speak', 'Jen', 'catch', 'out', 'builder', 'urinating', 'sink', 'Douglas', 'forced', 'wear', ""'electric"", 'sex', 'pants', 'shock', 'whenever', 'arousing', 'thoughts', 'part', 'out-of-court', 'harassment', 'settlement', 'Jen', 'Rohypnol', 'incident', 'series', 'two', 'Roy', 'trick', 'Moss', 'geek', 'friends', 'pose', ""'sexy"", 'calendar', 'favourite', 'episode', 'Jen', 'addiction', 'social', 'networking', 'site', 'called', 'Friendface', 'disaster.The', 'fourth', 'series', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'second', 'third', 'however', 'definitely', 'still', 'moments', 'crazed', 'plots', 'ideas', 'just', 'as', 'inspired', 'previous', 'instalments', 'Scenarios', 'include', 'Jen', 'hooking', 'up', 'zombie-like', 'keyboard', 'player', 'rock', 'group', 'Douglas', 'becoming', ""'spaceologist"", 'send-up', 'scientology', 'Jen', 'pretending', 'skilled', 'interpreter', 'then', 'having', 'bluff', 'way', 'when', 'instant', 'translation', 'program', 'breaks', 'down', 'Douglas', 'trying', 'divorce', 'wife', 'being', 'forced', 'air', 'Star', 'Trek-themed', 'homemade', 'sex', 'tapes', 'court', 'Come', 'think', 'most', 'best', 'bits', 'series', 'seem', 'involve', 'Douglas', 'Jen', 'rather', 'Roy', 'Moss', 'latter', 'still', 'have', 'presence', 'virtue', 'unmistakable', 'personalities', 'Crowd', 'required', 'viewing', 'comedy', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'ages.A', 'couple', 'actors', 'also', 'star', 'lesser-known', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'British', 'comedy', 'called', ""'Garth"", 'Marengi', 'Darkplace']",N/A

1385892,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B0045WJOAG,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[1, 1]","Graham Linehan surely must be one of the most talented comedy writer/directors of recent years. Father Ted, Black Boooks and then this - top quality stuff and good enough to keep you crying with laughter.I can remember that the first series got a rather tentative write up when it was first aired, and in an interview on the 3rd DVD even Linehan admits that the 1st series didn't quite hit the mark. I can't see it myself - the 1st series is as funny (or better) as its successors and benefits from a fair degree of freshness - it's hard to find any reason to criticise it. Perhaps the rather conventional sitcom settings that Linehan produces in his comedy might seem rather unadventurous to the more demanding audience members, but the writing is what makes this so special. Linehan also seems to have a knack of bringing high quality performers into his productions and O'Dowd, Ayoade and Parkinson work wonderfully together. They are well supported by a number of other actors, including Noel Fielding who plays the gloomy goth Richmond and Chris Morris and Matt Berry who play the trio's successive (and appalingly overbearing) bosses. If I'm honest, S4 seems to tail off a littel and it isn't quite as funny as its predecessors but it's still pretty good and it's well worth having the full set, if you haven't already got the earlier series (where have you been?).There are a few extras, including outtakes, deleted scenes, set tours and the like and the Ken Korda (Adam Buxton) documentary on the first disc had me aching with laughter. Perhaps the best thing about these DVDs is the menu system which are based on popular computer games. I won't spoil it for you but it's well worth taking the time to watch the menus which have a life of their own.This stuff just doesn't get old.""Prepare to put mustard on those words, for you will soon be consuming them along with this slice of humble pie, that comes direct from the oven of shame, set at gas mark 'egg on your face'.""",5,Twenty four episodes of fantasticness,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,1981,"['Graham', 'Linehan', 'surely', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'comedy', 'writer/directors', 'recent', 'years', 'Father', 'Ted', 'Black', 'Boooks', 'then', 'top', 'quality', 'stuff', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'crying', 'laughter.I', 'can', 'remember', 'first', 'series', 'got', 'rather', 'tentative', 'write', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'interview', '3rd', 'DVD', 'even', 'Linehan', '1st', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'mark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', '1st', 'series', 'funny', 'better', 'successors', 'benefits', 'fair', 'degree', 'freshness', 'hard', 'find', 'reason', 'criticise', 'Perhaps', 'rather', 'conventional', 'sitcom', 'settings', 'Linehan', 'comedy', 'might', 'seem', 'rather', 'unadventurous', 'more', 'demanding', 'audience', 'members', 'writing', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'Linehan', 'also', 'have', 'knack', 'bringing', 'high', 'quality', 'performers', 'productions', ""O'Dowd"", 'Ayoade', 'Parkinson', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'together', 'are', 'well', 'supported', 'number', 'other', 'actors', 'including', 'Noel', 'Fielding', 'who', 'gloomy', 'goth', 'Richmond', 'Chris', 'Morris', 'Matt', 'Berry', 'who', 'play', 'trio', 'successive', 'appalingly', 'overbearing', 'bosses', ""'m"", 'honest', 'S4', 'tail', 'off', 'littel', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'predecessors', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'full', 'set', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'got', 'earlier', 'series', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'set', 'tours', 'like', 'Ken', 'Korda', 'Adam', 'Buxton', 'documentary', 'first', 'disc', 'had', 'aching', 'laughter', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'DVDs', 'menu', 'system', 'are', 'based', 'popular', 'computer', 'games', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'well', 'worth', 'taking', 'time', 'watch', 'menus', 'have', 'life', 'own.This', 'stuff', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'old', 'Prepare', 'put', 'mustard', 'words', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'consuming', 'slice', 'humble', 'pie', 'direct', 'oven', 'shame', 'set', 'gas', 'mark', 'face']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","Take two hopeless I.T. nerds (one a slob and one a bespectacled social misfit), and add one pathologically lying people expert. That's the setup for ""The IT Crowd,"" a fun little workplace sitcom that sits on the other end of the comedy spectrum from ""The Office"" -- in particular, hardcore farce. These four seasons are crammed full of pure weirdness and mild surreality, starting with simple workplace comedies and then piling on the weird.As the story begins, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) is hired by the deranged CEO Dernholm, whom she has told that she knows plenty about computers. Unfortunately, he doesn't plan to have her working on the levels that are full of ""lots of sexy people, not doing much work, and having affairs."" So he sends her down to the I.T. department, a filthy basement occupied only with ""standard nerds"" -- an embittered slob named Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and socially oblivious Moss (Richard Ayoade).Despite the fact that they keep the company from imploding, nobody appreciates them (""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""). Initially the guys loathe Jen and vice versa, but gradually they start to appreciate one another. And as the series goes on, the trio of awkward weirdos has to deal with countless strange occurrences, problems, disasters and the occasional criminal undertaking.""The IT Crowd: Series 1-4"" has a few bumps in the road (""The Haunting of Bill Crouse"" way overextends some of its jokes) but is overall a pretty solid sitcom -- think a more farcical version of ""The Office"" with a dash of ""The Mighty Boosh."" It even has Noel Fielding as the supremely freaky goth that lives down in the basement like a vampire (mostly in the first two seasons).And it's got some great running jokes like Douglas Reynholm's (""I don't think I've ever looked in this drawer... WOW, a gun!"") and the idiots who call IT because their computers are unplugged. But each episode has its own running gags: toe-deforming shoes, iPhones, bottom-kissing, ""manly"" behavior, flaming bras, erotic calendars and Douglas offending the top five major world religions. And the dialogue is a big oozing bundle of hilarity (""My trouser hams are not for sale sir!"").The core three actors are all brilliant at their very different characters -- Parkinson (who looks like a slapstickier version of Gillian Anderson) is wonderful as a pathological liar and girly-girl with the worst office on Earth. O'Dowd is deliciously sloppy and resentful about the way the rest of the employees treat him (a necessary evil), and Ayoade is gloriously monotonic and clueless about real life.It has a couple weak episodes, but ""The IT Crowd: Seasons 1-4"" is the funniest Britcom in years -- and thankfully, it's still going strong.",5,Have you tried turning it off and on again?,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,2723,"['Take', 'two', 'hopeless', 'I.T', 'nerds', 'one', 'slob', 'one', 'bespectacled', 'social', 'misfit', 'add', 'one', 'pathologically', 'lying', 'people', 'expert', 'setup', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'fun', 'little', 'workplace', 'sitcom', 'other', 'end', 'comedy', 'spectrum', 'Office', 'particular', 'hardcore', 'farce', 'four', 'seasons', 'are', 'crammed', 'full', 'pure', 'weirdness', 'mild', 'surreality', 'starting', 'simple', 'workplace', 'comedies', 'then', 'piling', 'weird.As', 'story', 'Jen', 'Katherine', 'Parkinson', 'hired', 'deranged', 'CEO', 'Dernholm', 'whom', 'told', 'plenty', 'computers', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'plan', 'have', 'working', 'levels', 'are', 'full', 'lots', 'sexy', 'people', 'not', 'doing', 'much', 'work', 'having', 'affairs', 'down', 'I.T', 'department', 'filthy', 'basement', 'occupied', 'only', 'standard', 'nerds', 'embittered', 'slob', 'named', 'Roy', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'socially', 'oblivious', 'Moss', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', '.Despite', 'fact', 'keep', 'company', 'imploding', 'nobody', 'Have', 'tried', 'turning', 'off', 'again', 'Initially', 'guys', 'loathe', 'Jen', 'vice', 'versa', 'gradually', 'start', 'appreciate', 'one', 'series', 'trio', 'awkward', 'weirdos', 'deal', 'countless', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'problems', 'disasters', 'occasional', 'criminal', 'undertaking', 'IT', 'Crowd', '1-4', 'few', 'bumps', 'road', 'Haunting', 'Bill', 'Crouse', 'way', 'jokes', 'overall', 'pretty', 'solid', 'sitcom', 'think', 'more', 'farcical', 'version', 'Office', 'dash', 'Mighty', 'Boosh', 'even', 'Noel', 'Fielding', 'supremely', 'freaky', 'goth', 'down', 'basement', 'vampire', 'mostly', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', '.And', 'got', 'great', 'running', 'jokes', 'Douglas', 'Reynholm', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'looked', 'drawer', 'WOW', 'gun', 'idiots', 'who', 'call', 'IT', 'computers', 'are', 'unplugged', 'episode', 'own', 'running', 'gags', 'toe-deforming', 'shoes', 'iPhones', 'bottom-kissing', 'manly', 'behavior', 'flaming', 'bras', 'erotic', 'calendars', 'Douglas', 'offending', 'top', 'five', 'major', 'world', 'religions', 'dialogue', 'big', 'oozing', 'bundle', 'hilarity', 'trouser', 'hams', 'are', 'not', 'sale', 'sir', '.The', 'core', 'three', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'Parkinson', 'who', 'slapstickier', 'version', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'wonderful', 'pathological', 'liar', 'girly-girl', 'worst', 'office', 'Earth', ""O'Dowd"", 'deliciously', 'sloppy', 'resentful', 'way', 'rest', 'employees', 'treat', 'necessary', 'evil', 'Ayoade', 'gloriously', 'monotonic', 'clueless', 'real', 'life.It', 'couple', 'weak', 'episodes', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'funniest', 'Britcom', 'years', 'thankfully', 'still', 'going', 'strong']",N/A
