I first saw Val Kilmer in the 3rd Batman film; BATMAN FOREVER co starring Tommy Lee Jones (THE CLIENT) and Jim Carrey (ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE). This movie is alright but not as good as BATMAN FOREVER or TOMBSTONE (from what I've heard). The transitions are kind of weird because in the scene with Dr. Jimmy Pettis in the Police car, he is in the back seat but the transition also makes him look like he's in the passenger seat as well.

It's just yelling and someone dies, then cut to a scene of some overacting cop with a newyork accent interrogating Val Kilmer. I'm not even sure what this film was about... Globalwarming? huh? This movie is confusing as hell to watch and is a complete mind trip. I actually ended up pausing my dvd player to go on a rage punching walls and throwing chairs in a fit that I could have spent the 4.99 to rent this on lottery tickets or beer, or even donated to a charity. Instead I wasted it on whatever this is...

Kelly song but it doesn't make for too good of a movie.Val Kilmer continues slumming in the ""direct to video"" world along with staples Armand Assante and Eric Roberts. Kilmer plays Jimmy Paris, a nut who shows up at a newspaper office with a wild story of global warming and testing peoples' limits. He spends the rest of the film feasting on scenery with Detective Mancini (Assante). Kilmer narrates a tale of how he locked up a group of people in a steam room under the guise of a dating service. He's like Jig Saw from the Saw movies if Jig was down with Club Med.Eric Roberts leads the steam room group in killing one another and themselves. The poor group has literally two sentences of motivation with which to work. They play things out like every other ""we're trapped in a confined space"" thriller (Headless Body in a Topless Bar, Cube, etc). The only thing missing is that their antics are being broadcast on the internet--something screenwriter Robert Malkani already did with the 2005 film Dot Kill (produced by The Chaos Experiment's director, Philippe Martinez).The steam room scenes are cross-cut with the police interrogation, helping to make The Chaos Experiment all the more disjointed.
