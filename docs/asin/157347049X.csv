It turned out to be very good. I don't think it was meant to be scary in a slasher way, but that's a good thing. I don't want to see another Jason or Freddy movie, and this is very original. The titular freak played by Jonathan Fuller has real pathos and even as he's running amok and eating people you can't help but feel really sorry for him. You can tell he desperately wants to communicate and be around people after a lifetime of solitude, but all he has known is torture and darkness, and can't react to anyone except with violence.

Their marriage has been hurtling toward divorce ever since John got drunk, took a drive with the kids; and cracked up the car, killing their 5 yo son JJ and blinding their teenage daughter. Now, two years later, John finds out that he's inherited a castle in Italy. The three remaining Reillys move in with the intention of liquidating and selling the place. No one is aware that John's aunt had spent the last 42 years in the castle, never venturing beyond it's walls up until her death. She also kept a very dark secret in the castle's vast basement. The Reillys go about their business, unaware that another resident has escaped his chains beneath them! Insane and hungry, the castle freak emerges, looking for some dinner! He prefers human meat, so things get a bit complicated. CASTLE FREAK is a good movie for lurking monster fans like me. The story is good enough to make this more than just another gore-fest (although the gore level is fairly high). There is a semi-sympathetic creature, and a family that must fight in order to survive. Stuart Gordon has fashioned a film here that is good on several levels, not just the visceral. Where his Re-Animator was strictly for laughs and gross-outs, CASTLE FREAK has a surprising amount of depth and emotion to it.

188938,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,157347049X,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","A rarity for the 1990's, CASTLE FREAK is a classic throwback to the bygone era of Gothic Horror that follows in the grand tradition of the Hammer and Universal pictures. Directed by the great Stuart Gordon of RE-ANIMATOR fame, CASTLE FREAK follows the Reilly's as they move into their family's beautiful Italian villa, only to discover that the castle is also home to a hideously deformed creature that lives deep within the dungeon walls. Gordon brings together genre favorites Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton once again, who do a fine job in handling the agony and grief of a war-torn couple that are dealing the death of their young son. The shadowy corridors and decrepit crypts found throughout the Italian castle set an ominous mood, themselves, and allow Gordon the tools he needs to carefully craft his creeping terror and timely suspense. Much applause is also in order for the frightening performance put forth by Jonathan Fuller as the freak. Horrifying as he may be, Fuller also remains expressly human, and in time, he becomes a pitiful and sympathetic monster. The full-body makeup designs created by Optic Nerve are also very well done and extremely believable.

As far as I'm concerned, he's the most underrated dude still doing it, and his work in the last few years is the best he's ever done.Though I didn't cringe as much as during Stuck (2007), Castle Freak is definitely his most gruesome film to date. It's unrated, and if it were to be rated by the MPAA, would no doubt receive an NC-17. Gordon always pushes the envelope with his images, toying with his audience. He holds on the gore when you expect he might cut away from it, he cuts when you expect he might hold. In addition to that, he paints his horrific images with a very fine brush. Though the acts may be similar to other films (after all, there are only so many horror situations in the world) his gore always looks more original than 90% of the other horror movies out there, which is a great lesson for anyone looking to get into horror. It's a crucial way to stray from the pack.The only thing preventing me from giving this one five stars is that the script could have been way more interesting. They had all the pieces of a compelling story there, but it didn't really gel together. That said, I adore every other aspect of this movie, and highly recommend it.

188944,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,157347049X,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[1, 2]","Well, the freak isn't actually a ""freak"".  He's more the product of poor parenting (that's putting it mildly).  I haven't seen everything Stewart Gordon has done, but I've seen enough to know he always had the potential to make a less than stellar film.  ""Castle Freak"" is the evidence.  The title of this film conjures up so many ghoulishly delightful images in ones mind.  My imagination had all kinds of demented scenarios for this film.  None of them were quite as lifeless as this.  While trying to figure out why this film fizzled, the only honest reason I could come up with is that Stewart Gordon got sloppy and/or lazy.  All the elements for a fun horror film were at his disposal and he muffed it.  Let's break down what he had and what he did with it:-CREEPY ENVIRONMENTApparently this was shot on the same setting as ""Pit and the Pendulum"".  Even the exterior looks just unkempt enough to garner doubt about its security.  Much of ""Freak"" takes place in the sufficiently dank dark corners of the cellar.  Nearly the rest takes place in a pub, the rustic kitchen, a bedroom and the ""Castle"" ramparts (topside).  This is limited but sufficient if used properly.-GRUESOME CREATURE EFFECTSYea, this ""Freak"" is a glorious mess.  They used full body makeup for reasons an explanation would spoil.  Gordon never had bad makeup and prosthetic people in any film I've seen.  Plenty of blood gets smeared around too.-TRIED AND TRUE CASTJeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton are Gordon veterans by the time this gets made.  They both proved highly enjoyable in their previously campy, but convincing roles.  Nobody else hurt this film with bad acting.-A FAIR CONCEPTThe results of life long neglect and abuse on the loose; what more could you ask for.-THE RESULTS (some mild spoilers, no plot conveyed)I think the first problem I had with this film is that it's played too straight.  Because of this, Combs is completely out of his element.  He's not good enough an actor to pull of a leading man role in a straight horror film without looking incapable.  Everyone else did a fair job considering they were given nothing to do.  Another unwelcome result of playing it straight; it got a little boring.  Despite some nasty sexual situations (in one, Combs looks porno bad) and an adequate body count, none of it was unique or particularly well staged. The pacing just languished in the attempt at a deep, emotional story. There were some thought provoking psychological situations here, but not enough to keep it going.  With the lack of humor, the copious blood was simply gratuitous where in other Gordon films it heightened the fun gross-out factor.I like horror played straight, but Stewart Gordon just didn't do a good job of it here.  The actual ""Freak"" was an abomination.  Though you should feel sympathy, you simply want him dead to end his demented suffering and horrific acts.  The chases were clumsy, the action mediocre and fairly unimaginative and the mistakes glaring. Check out Combs running up the castles tower staircase.  As the stone steps turns to wood, his foot-falls still sound like stone.  Check out the blind daughter falling down into the cellar.  When she reaches the bottom, her cane falls wildly behind her.  She cusses at her violent tumble and scrapes, then quickly turns and reaches for her cane; BULLS EYE!!  In a film played for camp, this is forgivable and actually funny. In this attempt, it came off as inept.  Of course, many films make mistakes; but I don't usually notice them so easily.  I like Stewart Gordon's ""bite me"" attitude, and I love his more campy efforts; they are gruesome, shocking, imaginative and fun.  I think he discovered playing it straight is not his strength.  I can't say this film is all that fun, scary or enjoyable on any level, though disturbing it can be.  For the curious, a rental will do.  I can't recommend you buy it though.-Concept....3.5 stars-Players.....3 stars-Creature...3.5 stars-Script.......2 stars-Effort......2 stars2.8 Stars.",3,"I Don't Know Who's Sloppier; The ""Freak"" or Stuart Gordon?",1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,4008,"['Well', 'freak', ""n't"", 'actually', 'freak', 'more', 'product', 'poor', 'parenting', 'putting', 'mildly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'everything', 'Stewart', 'Gordon', 'done', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'know', 'always', 'had', 'potential', 'make', 'less', 'stellar', 'film', 'Castle', 'Freak', 'evidence', 'title', 'film', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'ghoulishly', 'delightful', 'images', 'ones', 'mind', 'imagination', 'had', 'kinds', 'demented', 'scenarios', 'film', 'None', 'were', 'quite', 'as', 'lifeless', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'film', 'fizzled', 'only', 'honest', 'reason', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'Stewart', 'Gordon', 'got', 'sloppy', 'and/or', 'lazy', 'elements', 'fun', 'horror', 'film', 'were', 'disposal', 'muffed', 'Let', 'break', 'down', 'what', 'had', 'what', 'did', '-CREEPY', 'ENVIRONMENTApparently', 'was', 'shot', 'same', 'setting', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Even', 'exterior', 'just', 'unkempt', 'enough', 'garner', 'doubt', 'security', 'Much', 'Freak', 'place', 'sufficiently', 'dank', 'dark', 'corners', 'cellar', 'Nearly', 'rest', 'place', 'pub', 'rustic', 'kitchen', 'bedroom', 'Castle', 'ramparts', 'topside', 'limited', 'sufficient', 'used', 'properly.-GRUESOME', 'CREATURE', 'EFFECTSYea', 'Freak', 'glorious', 'mess', 'used', 'full', 'body', 'makeup', 'reasons', 'explanation', 'would', 'spoil', 'Gordon', 'never', 'had', 'bad', 'makeup', 'prosthetic', 'people', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Plenty', 'blood', 'smeared', 'too.-TRIED', 'AND', 'TRUE', 'CASTJeffrey', 'Combs', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'are', 'Gordon', 'veterans', 'time', 'made', 'proved', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'previously', 'campy', 'convincing', 'roles', 'Nobody', 'else', 'hurt', 'film', 'bad', 'acting.-A', 'FAIR', 'CONCEPTThe', 'results', 'life', 'long', 'neglect', 'abuse', 'loose', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'for.-THE', 'RESULTS', 'mild', 'spoilers', 'plot', 'conveyed', 'think', 'first', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'played', 'too', 'straight', 'Combs', 'completely', 'element', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'pull', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'straight', 'horror', 'film', 'looking', 'incapable', 'Everyone', 'else', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'considering', 'were', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'unwelcome', 'result', 'playing', 'straight', 'got', 'little', 'boring', 'nasty', 'sexual', 'situations', 'one', 'Combs', 'porno', 'bad', 'adequate', 'body', 'count', 'none', 'was', 'unique', 'particularly', 'well', 'staged', 'pacing', 'just', 'languished', 'attempt', 'deep', 'emotional', 'story', 'were', 'thought', 'provoking', 'psychological', 'situations', 'here', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'going', 'lack', 'humor', 'copious', 'blood', 'was', 'simply', 'gratuitous', 'where', 'other', 'Gordon', 'films', 'heightened', 'fun', 'gross-out', 'factor.I', 'horror', 'played', 'straight', 'Stewart', 'Gordon', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'actual', 'Freak', 'was', 'abomination', 'should', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'simply', 'want', 'dead', 'end', 'demented', 'suffering', 'horrific', 'acts', 'chases', 'were', 'clumsy', 'action', 'mediocre', 'fairly', 'unimaginative', 'mistakes', 'glaring', 'Check', 'out', 'Combs', 'running', 'up', 'castles', 'tower', 'staircase', 'stone', 'wood', 'foot-falls', 'still', 'sound', 'stone', 'Check', 'blind', 'daughter', 'falling', 'down', 'cellar', 'When', 'bottom', 'cane', 'wildly', 'violent', 'tumble', 'scrapes', 'then', 'quickly', 'turns', 'reaches', 'cane', 'BULLS', 'EYE', 'film', 'played', 'camp', 'forgivable', 'actually', 'funny', 'attempt', 'came', 'off', 'inept', 'course', 'many', 'films', 'make', 'mistakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'notice', 'so', 'easily', 'Stewart', 'Gordon', 'bite', 'attitude', 'love', 'more', 'campy', 'efforts', 'are', 'gruesome', 'shocking', 'imaginative', 'fun', 'think', 'discovered', 'playing', 'straight', 'not', 'strength', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'fun', 'scary', 'enjoyable', 'level', 'disturbing', 'can', 'be', 'curious', 'rental', 'will', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buy', 'though.-Concept', '.3.5', 'stars-Players', '..3', 'stars-Creature', '3.5', 'stars-Script', 'stars-Effort', '2', 'stars2.8', 'Stars']",Castle Freak

The main theme of the story from my impression was about how people could get second chances to redeem themselves. (You'll see what I mean when the husband does something heroic to ask for forgiveness from his wife because he did something awful earlier). The only flaw in the movie is that Castle Freak wasn't in the movie enough. He'll pop up every now and then, killing whoever shows up in the house. There weren't much graphic scenes, except for the one part where he murders a hooker. The make-up is impressive, none of that computer generated nonsense. Looks like it took a great deal of labor.

No cheap gags like in _Re-Animator_ and no black comedy like in _From Beyond_. This is actually a very well-made film despite being a straight-to-video B-horror flick.A problem for me is that it is not pleasant to watch. It is in fact a decidedly *unpleasant* viewing experience. This point can not be overstated. I'm not a squeamish person but the sheer brutality exhibited in this film rivals that seen in _The Passion of the Christ_ or _Blood-Sucking Freaks_. Meanwhile, I found myself entirely un-sympathetic toward the very tortured protagonist yet disturbingly sympathetic toward the ""castle freak"" who was by the end of the film far beyond any kind of redemption. Granted, I am often inclined to root for the ""bad guy,"" but this is different. The characters are all thoroughly developed and very real, so that is not the problem. I kept feeling that ""I'm SUPPOSED to identify with this guy, but [on some level] he deserves what he gets.""This is, however, not the main reason why I chose to deduct 2 stars. I only gave this film 3 stars because 1) the story and direction is not of the same caliber as Gordon and Comb's other colaborations and 2) the plot is entirely too predictable. I was also expecting something ""Lovecraftian"" in this film (that is, after all, Stuart Gordon's bread-and-butter) since had read that it was ""loosely"" based on _The Outsider_. Yet there is nothing of that or any other H.P. Lovecraft story here save the setting of a castle and Lovecraft is not credited at all (if Lovecraft had been even a remote inspiration, trust me, they would have credited him). Perhaps I had false expectations for the film that have colored my reaction to it.I recommend this movie IF you are A) a die-hard Stuart Gordon fan or B) a vicariously inclined sado-masochistic horror/snuf aficianado.

188955,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,157347049X,Kevin F. Tasker,"[0, 0]","Castle Freak is a painful, low-budget genre picture with nasty gore effects, a plodding storyline and scattered moments of genuine dread. The story is basically irrelevant but concerns a family moving into a castle where a demonic creature has been housed and periodically abused for many years. The acting in the film is almost unbelievably atrocious with a monotone blind girl taking the cake for worst performance--and the film stock crinkles and fades, creating the effect--unintentional or not--of a 70's shlock horror flick. Depending on where you stand, this is a good thing or a bad thing.The 'film' is more or less a series of dark corridor gags, jump scares and gory attacks. The creature effects created for the titular villain (never once referred to as a 'freak') are incredibly good, especially for a 'film' of his caliber. In fact, most of the violence is well-done and singularly disturbing, especially near the end. It is easy to see that this was the focus of the film's presumably tiny, tiny budget. Really this film is an homage of sorts to old-school horror where plot, acting and overall production values served only the eventual meltdown. Castle Freak's last act is immense fun if one suffers through the sometimes monotonous and often gruelingly poor-acted exposition scenes.

Don't watch this film if you are affended easily. I had to turn it off I was so appalled! It was the part where castle freak bit the prostitute's boob off and ate her...well...you know. After he saw the man of the house(who has a wife and daughter)doing it to the prostitute. This goes down in my book as the only film that truely scared me and made me cringe! It is very sad how castle freak never got to live a life.He was locked up in chains by his horrible crazy mother after her husband left her. After she dies Castle freak breaks free and lurks in the castle. Meanwhile a family moves in the castle. When mutalated bodies turn up they must fight for survival. You start to not feel so sorry for the freak when he starts killing people and animals in horrific ways. The acting is amazing! Jonathan Fuller who played Georgio the freak was great in this and should have won an award! Raffaella Offidani who played the Italian prostitute was also great in this. That scene with her chained to the dungeon wall with the freak in the room always scares me! It is worth four stars due to the fact that Jeffrey Combs ways really bad in his drunk scenes! Any amature actor trying to make it in Hollywood could have done that! That was more of a comedic performance if you ask me! Barbara Crampton who played Combs' wife in the movie was quite good in her dramatic scenes. New-commer Jessica Dollarhide was very good in this considering this was her 1st feature film. Also, Elizabeth Kaza was good as the creepy, yet kind housekeeper.

188960,A2M1N8G4W4END8,157347049X,Michael R Gates,"[3, 3]","Stuart Gordon's CASTLE FREAK (1995) is a direct-to-video production that is actually way above the average quality of such fare.  Gordon, as most genre fans know, is the director of the highly venerated RE-ANIMATOR, the Lovecraft-inspired horror-comedy starring Jeffrey Combs as the titular character, Herbert West, and the beautiful Barbara Crampton as the requisite T&amp;A.  With CASTLE FREAK, Gordon re-unites with Combs and Crampton, but this film is much bleaker than the other, dealing with more serious and grimmer themes.  Fans of RE-ANIMATOR will therefore be disappointed if they go in expecting the same tongue-in-cheek situations and gallows humor, 'cause it just ain't there.  CASTLE FREAK is an earnest, adult horror film.The film follows the three members of the dysfunctional Reilly family--father John (Combs), mother Susan (Crampton), and daughter Rebecca (Jessica Dollarhide)--as they travel to Italy to check out a castle and surrounding estate that has been bequeathed to John by a recently deceased aunt.  But the family arrives at the castle with more baggage than just that which contains their clothing and personal items: A year earlier, an inebriated John had been driving his kids home from school during a rainstorm, and an accident resulting from his drunkenness caused the death of his son and the blindness of his daughter.  In spite of John's sincere contrition and his subsequent commitment to remaining sober, wife Susan has been unable to forgive him, and her participation in the marriage has since been perfunctory at best.  John hopes that Susan's willingness to come to Italy, stay in the castle, and help him sort out the details of his inheritance is a signal that the wound to their relationship is healing.  Once there, however, Susan is as icy as ever, and this depresses John so much that he eventually falls prey to old habits and seeks solace from a bottle...and from a local prostitute.In the mean time, sightless daughter Rebecca decides to explore their new digs on her own, and she learns that she and her parents are not the castle's only inhabitants when, deep in the miasmic caves and catacombs beneath the old building, she inadvertently stumbles upon the dwelling place of a hideous, blood-thirsty freak.  In spite of her ocular handicap, Rebecca is able to escape unharmed, but she is unable to subsequently convince her parents or the police that her subterranean encounter was genuine.  Eventually, though, everyone associated with the Reilly family will have to face this castle freak, and John Reilly will also come face-to-face with the truth about his heritage and his own past.The plot of CASTLE FREAK--very loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft's THE OUTSIDER--is actually pretty deep, with good character development and tons of subtle Freudian and Existentialist subtext.  As fans would expect, Gordon's direction is judicious and tight, and the work of Italian cinematographer Mario Vulpiani is breathtakingly aesthetic. Though CASTLE FREAK lacks the levity and humor of Gordon's RE-ANIMATOR, it still has plenty of the shocks and gore.  In fact, the current DVD version from Full Moon offers the restored, unrated director's cut, and the gore and violence that has been added back is pretty gut-wrenching and gruesome.  Since the special FX and make-up FX are skillfully executed, the blood and guts look quite realistic, so the gore hounds should not be disappointed.The acting in CASTLE FREAK is also wonderful.  Jeffrey Combs affects his usual smarmy yet likable on-screen persona, and the acting abilities of beautiful Barbara Crampton have only improved with age.  (Alas, Ms. Crampton does not have the same degree of--ahem!--exposure here that she had in RE-ANIMATOR.)  One of the best performances is from newcomer Jessica Dollarhide, who creates a refreshingly sincere average-teen character, one of the best to appear in a horror flick in recent years.  Rather than the cocky know-it-all attitude that teenagers exude in most contemporary genre films, Dollarhide's Rebecca is a genuinely nice, likeable kid who loves both of her parents and is struggling to cope with both the growing contention in her family and her new disability.  Also outstanding is Jonathan Fuller as the eponymous &quot;castle freak.&quot;  Presumably because of injury or deformity, the character is unable to articulate normal speech, but Fuller is nonetheless able to relay to the audience all of the character's emotions or thoughts via groans, whines, and guttural sounds or sometimes via pantomime.  His is an amazing performance.As mentioned before, the DVD from Full Moon offers the restored, unrated director's cut of CASTLE FREAK, meaning that there is some pretty graphic gore and some pretty explicit nudity--all the trappings of a really cool horror flick.  Since this film is a direct-to-video production from the mid-1990s, it is assumed that the 1.33:1 aspect ratio is the original format.  (Close scrutiny of the framing bears out this assumption, as there is never a shot that appears to be poorly arranged, nor is there any camera motion that clearly indicates pan-and-scan butchery.)  The digital transfer from film appears fairly sharp, with only occasionally noticeable digital or film-wear artifacts.  A few nice extras include the film's trailer, a cool making-of featurette, and some amusing trailers of other lesser Full Moon home-video offerings.All in all, 1995's CASTLE FREAK is a high-quality horror production that belies its conception and design as a direct-to-video release.  It is a must-see for fans of director Stuart Gordon, and the superb DVD from Full Moon is priced low enough that any horror aficionado can add it to his or her collection.",4,Frightfully Freaky Flick

188964,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,157347049X,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Castle Freak (Stuart Gordon, 1995)I was actually surprised to see that Castle Freak was based on a Lovecraft story; in general, once you get past Re-Animator, the two types of Stuart Gordon movies are ""the good ones"" and ""the Lovecraft adaptations"". And yet Gordon and longtime collaborator Stuart Paoli took Lovecraft's ""The Outsider"" and made it into something that sure doesn't look like a Lovecraft adaptation. It looks like a classic monster movie written straight for the screen, which is the kind of thing Gordon has always done very well.The story starts with the Reilly family--John (Gordon regular Jeffrey Combs), his wife Susan (Gordon's wife at the time, Barbara Crampton), and their blind daughter Rebecca (Jessica Dollarhide in her only big-screen appearance)--relocating to the country so John and Susan can try to patch up their marriage after a horrible trauma that tore the family apart. (The revelation of what that trauma is is a big part of the movie's tension, so I won't reveal it here.) And hey, wasn't it nice of our many-times-removed many-times-great aunt to die and leave us this castle at just the perfect time? As you can probably tell from the title, however, that wasn't the only thing Great Auntie left them. Except no one knows about the freak in the basement, or who he is. His presence, however, has an unsettling effect on John. So imagine what happens when someone actually runs into him...One of my favorite plot lines, no matter what the medium, has always been the main character's slow descent. Into what doesn't matter. Madness is a popular destination, but getting in touch with one's bestial instincts is a favorite of novelist Joyce Carol Oates, whom I adore. Gordon takes that tack here (I'm hoping that's not a huge spoiler), and Combs, who is well-known for his overacting abilities, actually tones it down here; I can't think offhand of a movie in which I've seen him so understated so much of the time. It's a very pleasant surprise to find out that, hey, Jeffrey Combs really can act without chewing scenery. And why Dollarhide never worked again after this (and had only gotten a couple of TV roles before) is beyond me. She does sterling work here, though to be fair she has that Naomi Watts kind of role where most of what you have to do is look good and scream a lot. Many of the minor characters take over Combs' usual mien, but I believe Gordon's intention here was to show the difference between the reserved Americans and the more expressive Europeans, so it works. (It also obviously fits in with the change in Combs' character as the film progresses.)Really surprising little flick, this. In Gordon's canon, I'd put it right behind King of the Ants and Re-Animator as some of his best work. Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the golden age of monster movies. *** ",4,Pleasantly understated horror from Stuart Gordon.,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,2840,"['Castle', 'Freak', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', '1995', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'see', 'Castle', 'Freak', 'was', 'based', 'Lovecraft', 'story', 'general', 'once', 'get', 'past', 'Re-Animator', 'two', 'types', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'Lovecraft', 'adaptations', 'yet', 'Gordon', 'longtime', 'collaborator', 'Stuart', 'Paoli', 'took', 'Lovecraft', 'Outsider', 'made', 'something', 'sure', ""n't"", 'look', 'Lovecraft', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'monster', 'movie', 'written', 'straight', 'screen', 'kind', 'thing', 'Gordon', 'always', 'done', 'very', 'well.The', 'story', 'Reilly', 'family', 'John', 'Gordon', 'regular', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Gordon', 'wife', 'time', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'blind', 'daughter', 'Rebecca', 'Jessica', 'Dollarhide', 'only', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'relocating', 'country', 'so', 'John', 'Susan', 'can', 'try', 'patch', 'up', 'marriage', 'horrible', 'trauma', 'tore', 'family', 'apart', 'revelation', 'what', 'trauma', 'big', 'part', 'movie', 'tension', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', 'hey', 'was', ""n't"", 'nice', 'many-times-removed', 'many-times-great', 'aunt', 'die', 'leave', 'castle', 'just', 'perfect', 'time', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'title', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'Great', 'Auntie', 'left', 'one', 'freak', 'basement', 'who', 'presence', 'however', 'unsettling', 'effect', 'John', 'So', 'imagine', 'what', 'when', 'someone', 'actually', 'One', 'favorite', 'plot', 'lines', 'matter', 'what', 'medium', 'always', 'been', 'main', 'character', 'slow', 'descent', 'Into', 'what', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Madness', 'popular', 'destination', 'getting', 'touch', 'one', 'bestial', 'instincts', 'favorite', 'novelist', 'Joyce', 'Carol', 'Oates', 'whom', 'adore', 'Gordon', 'tack', 'here', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'not', 'huge', 'spoiler', 'Combs', 'who', 'well-known', 'overacting', 'abilities', 'actually', 'down', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'offhand', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'understated', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'find', 'out', 'hey', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'really', 'can', 'act', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'why', 'Dollarhide', 'never', 'worked', 'again', 'had', 'only', 'gotten', 'couple', 'TV', 'roles', 'sterling', 'work', 'here', 'be', 'fair', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'kind', 'role', 'where', 'most', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'look', 'good', 'lot', 'Many', 'minor', 'characters', 'take', 'Combs', 'usual', 'mien', 'believe', 'Gordon', 'intention', 'here', 'was', 'show', 'difference', 'reserved', 'Americans', 'more', 'expressive', 'Europeans', 'also', 'obviously', 'change', 'Combs', 'character', 'film', 'Really', 'surprising', 'little', 'flick', 'Gordon', 'canon', ""'d"", 'put', 'right', 'King', 'Ants', 'Re-Animator', 'best', 'work', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'golden', 'age', 'monster', 'movies', '***']",Castle Freak

Poor baby has been locked away in the cellar and beaten his entire life, but he has also been fed regularly.  Till Mama dies.John Reilly inherits this beautiful castle, and travels with his wife and blind daughter to see his new windfall.  A brief and non-intrusive flashback show us that John and Susan have recently lost their son in an automobile accident, the same accident that left their daughter blind.  Susan blames John for their son's death, and this explains the tension between the two as they settle into their quarters in the castle.  Their plans are to sell the furnishings and artwork, and John wants to get started right away on inventory.  He takes his daughter Jessica along with him, but Jessica gets curious about a cat meowing and follows it instead.Of course, we all know that Jessica will wind out in the lower halls of the castle where our hungry, wretched little friend awaits.  Jessica gets away, Freak eats Kitty and gets loose, but while Jessica didn't see Freak, he saw Jessica and would like a closer look.  He sneaks into her room, leaving with a sheet to wrap himself in, and only Jessica's dad believes her tale that there is someone or something else in the castle with them.Surprisingly good acting in this low budget film, with Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator and the Frighteners) and Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator and Body Double) and a good supporting cast; plus gorgeous castle background giving us beauty and creepiness all in one, set the perfect stage for our lovely, twisted, lonely freak.When John Reilly brings home a local prostitute, our darling, grotesque little intruder will give you a whole new meaning to the term ""oral sexx"" in a particularly gory ""love"" scene.Over all, if you are lover of cheap and/or cheesy horror flicks, you will not want to miss out on this jewel.

That route just happens to be Full Moon Productions that have been supplying Sid with poorly made hilarious b for years. We had enjoyed the Puppet Master series but were drawn in when we saw Sideshow about 8 years back and couldn't help but continue on. They have made so many films that are on the verge of barely watchable except for a select handful of gems. Castle Freak happens to be one of those rare occurrences where we enjoyed it for being a good flick instead of a complete low budget laughs fest. Yes the budget was still very minimal but was actually really decent for what they spent.The films starts with John Reilly (not Cal Naughton) who goes to Italy accompanied by his wife and blind daughter. He's inherited a huge castle and wants to put in on the market, but will be staying there for a bit. He's been dealing with lots of guilt since he killed in son and blinded his daughter when he drove them around totally wasted, and decided the Italy trip would be good to repair the damaged relationships. Before he hatch the chance to patch things up Dr. Phil style they're introduced to the freak lurking in the dungeon. This kid had spent year being beaten by his old lady, the duchess that owned the castle prior, and remained chained up for quite some time after she passed. So he's hungry, angry, and for some reason very horny which made for a very uncomfortable scene with a prostitute. Oh yeah This is one freak you'd like to avoid at all costs. Just look at his mug shot on the cover and you'll understand why.For Sid Castle freak was supremely entertaining. You have to give Stuart Gordon props for bringing one of the few legitimate films under the Full Moon label. What we liked about it was the very original concept and great dark atmosphere the castle provides. It's a creepy thought strolling around a castle without even knowing a complete mutated nut job lurks around the in a dark lair below. The film wasn't overly gory outside of some breast eating done by the castle freak, which is a good thing as far as Sid's considered. We happen to like the ones that don't have to rely too much on the blood and guts, even though you do need a healthy balance.

They did so again for Castle Freak.Well, two out of three ain't bad.Not that Castle Freak is awful.  It just falls short of what one has come to expect from this talented troika.  Such as sharp witty dialogue, pitch black humor, innovative stories, and envelop-pushing carnage.Instead, Castle Freak is about this guy.  You know who he is.  You've met him in hundreds of horror films.  We all have.  He's a regular Joe, kind of a horror everyman, who's suffered some tragedy.  Could be he was born deformed.  Or maybe burned or disfigured in a prank gone bad.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  Been there, done that.  Anyway, he's shut away somewhere.  An attic, a basement, an asylum, a cabin in the woods.  It's an old story.But in case any Julia Roberts fans need to be clued in, the film is called Castle Freak.  Subtle title, no?  At least Senator Lieberman can't call on the FTC to charge Full Moon with false advertising.  The film is Castle Freak, and it's about a castle freak.Here are the details of his all-too-common tale of woe: His mom was an Italian noblewoman who fell in love with an American soldier.  The soldier married and impregnated her, then deserted her for the States.  Left her heart-broken, alone in her castle (well, where else would a noblewoman live?).  So she took vengeance on their son.  Chained him inside a dungeon, whipped and beat and tortured him every day of his miserable life.  Even maimed his genitalia.  (I won't spoil the details, but guys, be prepared to cringe.)  After forty years of this, the noblewoman dies intestate.  Nobody knows about the son in the dungeon, so her attorney locates her heirs in America.A few minutes into the film, the American family is already arriving to inspect their newly acquired castle.  The lucky heirs consist of dad (Jeffrey Combs), the missus (Barbara Crampton), and their blind daughter.  Soon after they're settled, the freak escapes and the body count mounts.  It's all pretty straightforward killer-freak-on-the-rampage stuff.Naturally, this freak desires women, although, his manhood incomplete, he's unable to enjoy or satisfy them.  This further frustrates him, with predictably bloody results.  ""Progressives"" might disdain another entry in horror's long tradition of portraying freaks and retards as sexually frustrated rapists, but there you have it.  Take it for what it's worth.Castle Freak does try to ""stretch"" the genre with an Oprah subtext. Dad's alcohol problem resulted in the car crash that killed his son and blinded his daughter.  Although his daughter has forgiven him, his wife cannot.  They haven't slept together in nine months.  So dad too is sexually frustrated, and guilt-ridden, even as he continues to fight the bottle.It's an okay subtext, in a soapish sense.  Yes, there's symbolism in there (the freak's childhood photo resembles dad's dead son), and it allows for some closure at film's end, with the wife finding reason to forgive.  It's not a bad storyline, but considering the talents involved, one expects more.Full Moon likes to attach promos it calls ""video magazines"" at the end of its films, mainly trailers and ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff.  Combs and Crampton provide aesthetic assessments of Gordon's work.  (Now, just how honest will the average out-of-work actor be when discussing an employer's work?)  Combs allows that Castle Freak is humorless, but claims to believe it strengthens the horror, and that Gordon was right to eschew humor.Not!Combs is a sterling character actor, with unique features and intense facial ticks.  He shines when delivering quirkily funny lines.  Re-Animator and The Frighteners (1996) display Combs at his darkly comedic best.  But he disappoints in the dreary Dr. Mordrid: Master of the Unknown (1992).  To cast Combs in a humorless role is to waste his edgy gifts.  It's like hiring Tiger Woods to caddy.Barbara Crampton was only called to be pretty in Re-Animator, but rose to glory in From Beyond, playing a broad range from repressed scientist, to sexual libertine, to madwoman.  In Castle Freak, she's cast in the thankless role of mother.  She's got the soap credentials (The Young & The Restless), and competently handles her limited material.  But she can handle so much more than she's given.Jonathan Fuller plays the freak.  He claims the body makeup required six hours to apply.  He's an effective freak, but no more.  Unlike Karloff (Frankenstein) or Dafoe (Shadow of the Vampire), Fuller fails to emote a sympathetic persona from beneath his heavy makeup.  The fault is not entirely his.  The script offers him little opportunity.  (But neither did Karloff have lines in his first Frankenstein monster portrayal).Before anyone protest that Castle Freak's low budget makes comparisons to Frankenstein or Shadow of the Vampire inapposite, note that the freak in The Unseen was hideous and inarticulate (and yes, he had a frustrated sexual thing for Barbara Bach), but his death was unexpectedly poignant.  (On the opposite end ofthe freak spectrum, fans of envelop-pushing, grindhouse splatter will delight in The Grim Reaper (Italian 1981, aka Anthropophagus), whose freak performs a late-term abortion on an unwilling woman, with his bare hand.)Fuller's freak resides in the middle of the spectrum.  Yes, he callously racks up a body count, but other freaks are both more prolific and more savage in their technique.  Yes, he has personal issues, but other freaks have handled their issues with more aplomb.Combs and Crampton are enjoyable to watch, but you wish the script had given free reign to their talents.  You wish Gordon had used his immense talent for frenetic black comedy to deliver another Re-Animator or From Beyond.  (The dreadful Bride of Re-Animator (1989) could have used his touch.)Yes, artists want to stretch.  But sometimes their old work is so outstanding, you want multiple encores.  Instead, we have Castle Freak, a serviceable killer-freak film.",3,satisfying but unexceptional,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,6057,"['Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'Stuart', 'Gordon',

This is a straight horror story without the wit of the re-animator series.  It's about a family that inherits a castle with a surprise guest in the dungeon.  It's too bad that the movie is full screen since it has such a beautiful transfer.  Let's hope that it gets the widescreen treatment soon.  There are a few extras on the disc which is more than I could have hoped for.  The movie also has some nice special FX.  The only problem with the film is the family has selective hearing since they can't hear everything going on in the castle.
