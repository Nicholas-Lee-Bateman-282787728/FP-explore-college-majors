I'm not gonna tell you the plot about this one either, but I strongly suggest you watch this one right now. This is the best FARRELY'S BROTHER movie along with ""There's Something About Mary"". I love this two. I'm not that much of a ""Dumb And Dumber"" fan.I think you should purchase or rent this one.

147195,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792841840,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 6]","I've never been a huge fan of the Ferrelly brothers (they surely aren't the Coen's) but this film starred Bill Murray (or so I thought) and I just love him so I had to watch it at least once.  Truth be told, Murray is hilarious here in every frame he's in, but sadly he's just not in enough.  Woody Harrelson, and to a lesser degree Randy Quaid, are funny in their own rights here, but neither of them can truly carry this film and it isn't really until Murray comes onto the screen that my attention was gotten and I found myself fully amused.`Kingpin' tells the story of Roy Munson, a young guy who quickly rose to the top of the bowling world due to his dynamic skill and training.  When he makes enemies with the greedy Ernie McCracken he finds that all is not fair in love and bowling.  After an altercation that leaves Roy without his bowling hand he slips away into obscurity.  The love of the game has not left Roy though, and when he catches a glimpse of the Amish Ishmael Boorg and sees his raw potential for the game he offers to manage him.  Thankfully Ishmael's family is in dire need of some quick cash and so he agrees to allow Munson to train him for an upcoming tournament.  Along the way they face some difficulties, and when they finally make it to the tournament they have to face McCracken.The truth of the matter is that `Kingpin' only works some of the time.  A lot of the gags fall short, especially after a repeat viewing.  Woody Harrelson had a good year in `96, but that was due to his Oscar nominated performance in `The People vs. Larry Flynt', not this underwhelming comedy.  His performance isn't bad, but I just feel that the overall material is too weak to really sustain the audience.  Murray is really the only standout, mostly because his delivery is so naturally funny (thanks to his adlibbing just about everything he does).  When McCracken is on the screen I am in stitches; but when he leaves I am bored.",2,Definitely not as funny as I figured it would be...,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,1944,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Ferrelly', 'brothers', 'surely', 'are', ""n't"", 'Coen', 'film', 'starred', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'so', 'thought', 'just', 'love', 'so', 'had', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Murray', 'hilarious', 'here', 'frame', 'sadly', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'are', 'funny', 'own', 'rights', 'here', 'can', 'truly', 'carry', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'Murray', 'screen', 'attention', 'was', 'gotten', 'found', 'fully', 'amused.', 'Kingpin', 'story', 'Roy', 'Munson', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'quickly', 'rose', 'top', 'bowling', 'world', 'due', 'dynamic', 'skill', 'training', 'When', 'enemies', 'greedy', 'Ernie', 'McCracken', 'not', 'fair', 'love', 'bowling', 'altercation', 'Roy', 'bowling', 'hand', 'away', 'obscurity', 'love', 'game', 'not', 'left', 'Roy', 'when', 'glimpse', 'Amish', 'Ishmael', 'Boorg', 'raw', 'potential', 'game', 'manage', 'Thankfully', 'Ishmael', 'family', 'dire', 'need', 'quick', 'cash', 'so', 'allow', 'Munson', 'train', 'upcoming', 'tournament', 'way', 'face', 'difficulties', 'when', 'finally', 'make', 'tournament', 'have', 'face', 'McCracken.The', 'truth', 'matter', 'Kingpin', 'only', 'time', 'lot', 'gags', 'fall', 'short', 'especially', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'had', 'good', 'year', '96', 'was', 'due', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'People', 'vs.', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'not', 'underwhelming', 'comedy', 'performance', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'feel', 'overall', 'material', 'too', 'weak', 'really', 'sustain', 'audience', 'Murray', 'really', 'only', 'standout', 'mostly', 'delivery', 'so', 'naturally', 'funny', 'thanks', 'adlibbing', 'just', 'everything', 'When', 'McCracken', 'screen', 'am', 'stitches', 'when', 'am', 'bored']",Kingpin VHS

Directed by Peter Farrelly, director of such hillarious hits as ''Dumb and Dumber'', ''Theres something about Mary'', and the upcoming movie, ''Shallow Hal'', and co-directed by his brother Bobby, Kingpin stars Woody Harrelson as Roy Munson, a former state bowling champ, whos on the way to be the world champ, until his bowling hand is destroyed, and Roy is forced to live life with a hook on his arm. After an epilouge explaining that, the movie blasts back to the present, were Roys a 40 year old nobody, struggling to pay his rent. But Roys life is about to change when he meets Ismael (played by Randy Quaid), an amish bowler who is cluless about the real world. Roy is impressed by Ismaels bowling, and invites him on a trip to Reno, Nevada, where Ismael would compete for the bowling championship. At first Ismael turns it down, but after Roy follows Ismael back to the plantation, disguised as an amish man named Hessiciah, Roy convinces him to travel to Reno, one problem, there flat bloke. After surviving on illegal games to make money, Roy and Ismael must team up with an attractive rich woman named Claudia(played by Vannesa Angel.) Roy, Ismael, and Claudia have one hillarious adventure as they try to get to Reno, to defeat heavy favorite, Ernie ''Big Ern'' Mckracken(played by Bill Murray), Roys former rival.There are plenty of laughs in Kingpin as Quaid and Harrelson are hillarious, and the Farrelly brothers have proven to create another comedic hit to follow up ''Dumb and Dumber''.

The Farrelly Brothers make a movie out of a very un-funny subject: bowling. Yes, bowling. That's what makes it even funnier. Woody Harrelson stars as a bowling pro whose bowling hand is cut off from some thugs. It's years later and he's a balding, fat bum with no life. He sees Randy Quaid, who plays an amish, bowling a perfect score. He plans on turning this guy into a star!. Bill Murray co-stars as a bowling rival with the world's most horrendous comb over. You gotta see it to believe it. This kind of film is an acquired taste. It's not for everybody. There are some huge knee slapping moments that will make you almost ashamed that you were laughing. The film also has hot babe Vanessa Angel. Wow. I'm not a Woody Harrelson fan. In fact, I can't stand him. But I do give him credit for this. He's quite funny. Bill Murray is another acquired taste. He can be really funny when he wants to be. He's exceptionally funny here in a smaller role. This is definitley his best role to date. This is an offensive film.

Well how's about man and his rubber hand.It's 1979 and Ocelet Iowa is Roy Munson (Woody  Harrelson) territory. When it comes to knocking down the pins, Roy-boy  moves like a leisure-suited Fred Astaire and throws the strikes when they  count. He bowls the pro circuit until Ernie &quot;Big Ern&quot; McCracken  (Bill Murray)--the skunk of the tournies, the guy with the worst hair since  Shatner--leaves Roy to get his hand lopped off by a bunch of  pinheads.Downtrodden, drunk, and sinking low (and I mean it literally)  to pay the rent, Roy discovers a naive forty-year old Amish farmer named  Ishmael (Randy Quaid) and figures he can make him into a bowling  thoroughbred. On the road to Reno and a million dollar payday, the odd  couple picks up well-proportioned Claudia (Vanessa Angel) and proceeds to  pack their trip with enough gross-out humor to keep you gassed-up for  life.Made by the Farrelly Brothers, Kingpin hits a few of its marks on  the bull's eye. Roy's time among the simple people provides some of the  nastiest/goofiest moments. But then, too much crude and rude and not enough  fun and ny wreck the gross-out get-down.

Their short career has been filled with ups and downs starring with `Dumb  and Dumber' which is so-so, then `Kingpin', which is probably their best,  followed by `There's Something About Mary' which has a softer side and a  larger audience and then the Jim Carrey misfire `Me, Myself &amp; Irene'.  While `Mary' is often thought of as their best, `Kingpin' is in a lot of  ways better and has a higher LPM (laughs per minute) average. Quite  possibly the funniest movie of the 90's, I'm not saying it's the best  comedy, just that it's the most constantly funny. Woody Harrelson is  hilarious and so is Randy Quaid as bowling Amish (?) Ishmael. Bill Murray  is hilarious and steals almost all his scenes. Vanessa Angel is the  super-sexy Claudia, she is the typical sexy female presence that the  Farrelly Bros. seem to need to round up the cast, in order they are; Lauren  Holly, Vanessa Angel, Cameron Diaz and Renee Zellweger. As for the typical  `hair gel' joke we've come to expect from the Farrelly's, this time it  deals with Roy `milking a bull' and drinking the `milk'. The film is filled  with these jokes that are still hilarious even after repeated viewings. It  also features a great soundtrack with songs from Goldfinger and other  modern bands. The `bowling sequences' are well made, nicely edited with a  great soundtrack, with a heavy dash of humor and exciting as well. Roy  loosing the tournament and avoiding the typical ending was a great move and  heightens the originality level, which is very high. Peter and Bobby  Farrelly are very talented comedy filmmakers and some of their films (at  least 2) have become instant comedy classics. If they're lucky they might  be considered the `Mel Brooks' of their generation, not because their humor  is the same (it isn't, Brooks is better), but because they are fearless and  original filmmakers that revive the comedy genre every decade or so.

I remember at least two people walking out sometime during the show. No matter because for me, this ranks as one of the the most brilliant and unique comedies in a long, long time.The Farelly Brothers, who would return to us in such top form with &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; give us an insane twist on the comeback-kid story.Woody Harrelson is Munson, a washed-up former bowling protege who finds a way out in Ishmael, a simple Amish farmer with exceptional skill on the bowling lane. Munson sees the kid as a tool for revenge, for money, for fame -- all the things that were denied him (largely by the hand of his ruthless rival, deliciously played by Bill Murray in one of his funniest supporting roles).What follows is a practically non-stop series of gags, satire and slapstick that are brilliant in their timing and effect.

It has since gone on to be one of my favorite comedies and showcases Bill Murray's evil, sarcastic humor at it's finest.Woody Harrelson is Roy Munson a young, up-and-coming bowler who falls foul of 'Big' Ern McCracken (simply by beating him). Ern executes a cunning revenge on Roy which results in the loss of his precious bowling hand. Flash-forward 17 years and Roy is living a truly grotty life and is a complete and utter loser. His hustling attempts fall flat and it looks like he's destined for a future of failure until he meets naive Amish 'boy' Ishmael, who just so happens to be a bowling prodigy. Roy and Ishmael team-up and head to Reno, Nevada for a big bowling showdown with the diabolical 'Big' Ern.Part road movie, part profound life journey, Kingpin is probably the most mature Farrelly Brothers movie and certainly their best effort so far. The script is just jam-packed with brilliant dialogue and gags, and Ishmael (or 'the kid' as they keep calling him despite the fact that Randy Quaid was 45 at the time of filming) may just be the sweetest character of all time and may even rival Cousin Eddie as Quaid's funniest role. But it is Bill Murray as 'Big' Ern who steals the movie and runs away with it. Apparently he just threw the script away and decided to ad-lib, and you can tell. He keeps the rest of the cast on their toes and enjoys himself way too much. His Unified Fund TV commercial is comedy gold.It may well be one of the most underrated comedies of all time, but Kingpin is a far superior film to the likes of There's Something About Mary or Me, Myself & Irene. It's lack of success or popularity is not a reflection on its brilliance.The DVD looks horrible in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Why is there not a Blu Ray yet.

McCracken tempts him into running a scam that gets poor Munson so roughly handled that his bowling hand is torn off (non-explicitly), replaced by a hook, which he covers with a grotesque rubber hand.

The Farrelly have created a comedic masterpiece with this movie.  There are so many funny lines and so many memorable moments.  Vulgar, disgusting... and hilarious all the way through, &quot;Kingpin&quot; is a comedy treat that stands out from most of the comedies of today.Roy Munson was a bowling legend until a hustling gig gone wrong ended up taking his right hand.  Now, Munson is an alcoholic mess who can't even afford his rent.  Everything seems to be a giant downward spiral for him until he sees somebody who has the potential of becoming the next great bowler that he could've been.  That person he sees is Ishmael; a person of Amish decent that secretly goes bowling without his family's knowledge.  Munson knows that with this Amish bowler under his watch that they can turn the bowling world upside down...or at least do their best not to &quot;Munson&quot; it all up!I absolutely love this movie.  It is hilarious and clever at the same time.  There are sick and vulgar gags, to be sure, but I don't see them as overly gratuitous or annoying.  They work for what the film is trying to accomplish.  There are many, MANY moments were I am laughing out loud hysterically.  Woody Harrelson  is terrific as the alcoholic mess, &quot;Roy.&quot;  Randy Quaid is also a joy to watch, as he always is.  Yet, I must admit that the man who simply steals the show without breaking a sweat is Bill Murray.  He is brilliantly funny and outrageous in the most subtle of ways.  He's always the showstopper without trying too hard.  I loved everybody in this movie, but I have to admit that Bill was the one who I was the most impressed with, and he makes the movie what it is.  The script is extremely funny and takes the comedy to a different level.The DVD is poor when it comes to special features.  It'd be great if they would releases a special edition of this movie, as it is extremely popular.  The great thing about this movie is that it's not PG-13 anymore and now has an R-rating, which includes footage that was not included in the original theatrical version.  The picture and sound quality is more than satisfactory.  The DVD includes both widescreen and fullscreen versions.  Commentary from the Farrelly Brothers and the original theatrical trailer are included as well.  I wished more was included, but hopefully a fully-loaded special edition will come out sometime in the near future.&quot;Kingpin&quot; rolls strikes every single time when it comes to delivering laughs and a great script.  While the gags can be a bit disgusting and vulgar at times, they are not gratuitous and they end up working in the movie.  If you're looking for a comic gem that is unlike any other comedy that is out there, this may be the one for you.  A five-star movie all the way!",5,&quot;Was I talking out loud?&quot;,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,2874,"['quot', 'Kingpin', 'quot', 'quickly', 'become', 'cult-classic', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'became', 'Farrelly', 'have', 'created', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'lines', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Vulgar', 'disgusting', 'hilarious', 'way', 'quot', 'Kingpin', 'quot', 'comedy', 'treat', 'out', 'most', 'comedies', 'today.Roy', 'Munson', 'was', 'bowling', 'legend', 'hustling', 'gig', 'gone', 'wrong', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'right', 'hand', 'Now', 'Munson', 'alcoholic', 'mess', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'afford', 'rent', 'Everything', 'be', 'giant', 'downward', 'spiral', 'somebody', 'who', 'potential', 'becoming', 'next', 'great', 'bowler', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'person', 'Ishmael', 'person', 'Amish', 'decent', 'secretly', 'bowling', 'family', 'knowledge', 'Munson', 'Amish', 'bowler', 'watch', 'can', 'turn', 'bowling', 'world', 'down', 'least', 'do', 'best', 'not', 'quot', 'Munson', 'quot', 'up', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'clever', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'sick', 'vulgar', 'gags', 'be', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'overly', 'gratuitous', 'annoying', 'work', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'are', 'many', 'MANY', 'moments', 'were', 'am', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'hysterically', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'terrific', 'alcoholic', 'mess', 'quot', 'Roy.', 'quot', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'also', 'joy', 'watch', 'always', 'must', 'admit', 'man', 'who', 'simply', 'show', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'outrageous', 'most', 'subtle', 'ways', 'always', 'showstopper', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'loved', 'everybody', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'Bill', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'movie', 'what', 'script', 'extremely', 'funny', 'comedy', 'different', 'level.The', 'DVD', 'poor', 'when', 'special', 'features', ""'d"", 'be', 'great', 'would', 'releases', 'special', 'edition', 'movie', 'extremely', 'popular', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'PG-13', 'anymore', 'now', 'R-rating', 'footage', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'more', 'satisfactory', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'versions', 'Commentary', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'are', 'included', 'well', 'wished', 'more', 'was', 'included', 'hopefully', 'fully-loaded', 'special', 'edition', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'sometime', 'near', 'future.', 'quot', 'Kingpin', 'quot', 'rolls', 'strikes', 'single', 'time', 'when', 'delivering', 'laughs', 'great', 'script', 'gags', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'disgusting', 'vulgar', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'comic', 'gem', 'other', 'comedy', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'five-star', 'movie', 'way']",Kingpin VHS
147242,A1OXUVBFZAAQAQ,0792841840,minguy,"[2, 3]","(Anyone with a low threshold for gross-out/toilet humor, STAY AWAY!)""Kingpin"" is a highly underrated film that tragically remains unseen by many people. There are two reasons for this:1) It's a film about bowling.2) It's a gag-filled comedy starring Woody Harrelson, a good actor in his own right but one who just doesn't have the kind of audience-drawing power of, say, Jim Carrey.But don't let these factors fool you. Woody and bowling are a odd coupling, but it does wonders up on screen.The strength of ""Kingpin"" lies in its characters. All three of the main protagonists undergo individual arcs that are completely believable and relatable to the audience. Vanessa Angel's street-smart but wanton sex cat develops into a charming woman. Randy Quaid's Omish oaf matures into an adult and makes a name for himself. And Woody Harrelson's Roy Munson changes from a one-handed, past-prime, deadbeat, ex-bowling-champion to a decent human being.Of course, great characters are nothing till great actors bring them to life. And what a cast! Woody Harrelson, a highly underrated actor, gives a stand-out performance. Bill Murray? Forget about it. This guy's the king of witty, understated, visual comedy. And geez, who would have ever thought Randy Quaid could be this funny? Displaying excellent comic timing and delivery, Quaid surprised me as much as Jeff Daniels did in ""Dumb and Dumber."" Unfortunately, ""Kingpin"" does have a weak spot: Vanessa Angel and her less-than-stellar acting voice. But this is only a small distraction. She manages well and has great chemistry with the other two leads.I firmly believe this is the best film the Farrellys' have made so far. Sure, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is funnier but it's a film that has no impact (which is fine since it's a goofy comedy). Sure ""There's Something About Mary"" is more romantic (in a twisted sort of way) and made tons of money but it's a film that's too harsh and over-the-top. ""Kingpin,"" on the other hand, makes you laugh and causes you to care about its characters - about the hero of the story, in particular. Roy Munson starts off truly dispicable and pathetic, but ends up charming and appealing. He gains much empathy in his quest to become a ""winner."" And when he goes up against Murray's Ernie McCracken in a bowling showdown (which, by the way, is as tense as any other showdown in the world of sports), you are there with him, aching and hurting and hoping he'll win. And he does become a winner. Just not in the way you'd expect.Truly, the ending of ""Kingpin"" is the Farrellys' finest hour of storytelling: they fall into a screenwriting pit (how will Munson be redeemed?), defy both cliche and expectation, and come out on top with a moving, poignant and highly satisfying ending. You will be hard pressed to find another comedy bearing so much heart while retaining its witty humor.As for the DVD itself, it features a R-rated cut of the film that includes added scenes, which admittedly, do not really add or take away anything from the overall movie. Just some raunchier material. And there's the commentary from the Farrellys, which is amusing but random, spotty, and not very informative. Obviously, this disc is not brimming with extras but can't complain with the cheap price. You'll also notice the DVD has both widescreen and full-screen versions of the film. Normally, I only watch widescreen because there's no cropping. But take note, this film was shot in super35, which basically means it was shot in full screen and matted to cover the top and bottom (some directors, like Cameron and Verhoven, are known to shoot in this format). Widescreen crops the top and bottom. Full-screen shave a little off the sides.

If they had just kept the levels of humor above vulgar slapstick this could of been a real masterpiece. Well the offensive slapstick aside, this is a really good tape. Though I suggest parents screen it before they let their children watch it. Well, that said, this is a really good movie that does not rely on special effects. There is a really good story with characters that can speak to us. We may argue that what happens to Roy (losing his hand) is his own fault, but in a way he represents all of us by twisting the rules to get ahead. He is a great creation in that he is a faulted hero. We certainly won't see him as blameless, but we can understand his actions, and he goes through an interesting moral development. Ernie McCracken is very, very, bad. But he carries a charm that makes him likable despite his evil nature. Stanley is the same way. He is really fierce and brutal, but he also carries a charm that makes him more fascinating than repulsive. Ishmael is well handled (for the most part). In a world of under the table deals, and corruption, his untainted innocence is touching. (Especially if we consider the fact that most people who bowl, are doing it for money. While Ishmael wants to bowl to save his home and Ahmish family.)

147254,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,0792841840,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[1, 29]","For some reason, a good friend of mine recommended this film to me... probably because he knows I like to go bowling. The little bit of bowling that takes place in this movie is about the only thing worth while... and when it comes down to it, nothing is really worth while in this mind-numbing flick.Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was groomed by his father from the time he was a young child to be a professional bowler. As he reaches adulthood in the late 70s, he quickly becomes well known as the best bowler in the state, and the hero of his home town of Ocelot.He soon teams up with Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray), a bitter, manipulative con man who would be the top bowler if it were not for Munson.The short-lived partnership turns to tragedy when, thanks to McCracken, Munson is attacked and loses his right hand. This is supposed to be a comedy - even the scene in which he loses his hand is intended to be funny. Don't get me wrong - I understood the humor, and maybe if I was incredibly drunk, I would laugh - but nothing about someone being permanently disfigured is funny.Non-stop slapstick jokes are used throughout the film, using Munson's prosthetic hook. This worked in the Peter Pan re-make, &quot;Hook,&quot; but does not work here.The film fast forwards to 17 years after his disfigurement an not much has changed - he has been drinking himself into sorrow the entire time. This is also made out to be a comedic element - a man so devastated, that he drinks his life away in utter despair and loneliness. Funny, huh?Even though he can't bowl, he loves the bowling experience and is a struggling salesman to bowling alleys. During a sales call, he encounters Ishmael Boorg (Dennis Quaid), an Amish farmer who has snuck to the bowling alley to re-live an experience he had with his grandfather years before.Munson convinces Boorg that he is a bowling genius and that they should go to Reno, Nevada to a million-dollar bowling tournament.A worldly, drunk, selfish man takes a selfless, naive Amish farmer across the country in a beat-up wreck... a recipe for humor, right?About every cliche you can think of happens - before the film is over, Ishmael has been dressed in drag, gotten drunk, gotten grotesque tattoos and been in fist fights. As though it were by osmosis, Munson suddenly becomes less selfish and suddenly sober.The viewer is bombarded with tasteless gags, disgusting bedroom humor, implied animal abuse, and foul bathroom humor.I have a great sense of humor, which is why this film did nothing to provoke me to laughter.The acting was as good as it could have been in such a story. Like another slapstick, bathroom-humor film, &quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; the Farrelly brothers try to have a tongue-in-cheek approach to this movie. The characters are almost winking at the audience. The difference is that in &quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; the comedic timing worked and the gags were not predictable.In order to rally bowling fans to see the film, many pro bowlers, including the legendary Mark Roth, are given cameo appearances - but none of them have more than 1 or 2 seconds of screen time and none of them have any dialogue.This film is a true waste of celluloid and talent... and worse, a waste of time to watch.",1,"So stupid, it's almost fatal",1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,3271,"['reason', 'good', 'friend', 'mine', 'recommended', 'film', 'probably', 'go', 'bowling', 'little', 'bit', 'bowling', 'place', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'when', 'down', 'nothing', 'really', 'worth', 'mind-numbing', 'flick.Roy', 'Munson', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'was', 'groomed', 'father', 'time', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'be', 'professional', 'bowler', 'adulthood', 'late', '70s', 'quickly', 'well', 'known', 'best', 'bowler', 'state', 'hero', 'home', 'town', 'Ocelot.He', 'soon', 'teams', 'up', 'Ernie', 'McCracken', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'bitter', 'manipulative', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'top', 'bowler', 'were', 'not', 'Munson.The', 'short-lived', 'partnership', 'tragedy', 'when', 'thanks', 'McCracken', 'Munson', 'attacked', 'right', 'hand', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'even', 'scene', 'hand', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'understood', 'humor', 'maybe', 'was', 'incredibly', 'drunk', 'would', 'laugh', 'nothing', 'someone', 'being', 'permanently', 'disfigured', 'funny.Non-stop', 'slapstick', 'jokes', 'are', 'used', 'film', 'using', 'Munson', 'prosthetic', 'hook', 'worked', 'Peter', 'Pan', 're-make', 'quot', 'Hook', 'quot', 'not', 'work', 'here.The', 'film', 'fast', 'forwards', '17', 'years', 'disfigurement', 'not', 'much', 'changed', 'been', 'drinking', 'entire', 'time', 'also', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'comedic', 'element', 'man', 'so', 'devastated', 'life', 'away', 'utter', 'despair', 'loneliness', 'Funny', 'huh', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bowl', 'bowling', 'experience', 'struggling', 'salesman', 'bowling', 'alleys', 'sales', 'call', 'Ishmael', 'Boorg', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Amish', 'farmer', 'who', 'snuck', 'bowling', 'alley', 're-live', 'experience', 'had', 'grandfather', 'years', 'before.Munson', 'convinces', 'Boorg', 'bowling', 'genius', 'should', 'go', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'million-dollar', 'bowling', 'tournament.A', 'worldly', 'drunk', 'selfish', 'man', 'selfless', 'naive', 'Amish', 'farmer', 'country', 'beat-up', 'wreck', 'recipe', 'humor', 'right', 'cliche', 'can', 'think', 'happens', 'film', 'Ishmael', 'been', 'dressed', 'drag', 'gotten', 'drunk', 'gotten', 'grotesque', 'tattoos', 'been', 'fist', 'fights', 'were', 'osmosis', 'Munson', 'suddenly', 'less', 'selfish', 'suddenly', 'sober.The', 'viewer', 'bombarded', 'tasteless', 'gags', 'disgusting', 'bedroom', 'humor', 'implied', 'animal', 'abuse', 'foul', 'bathroom', 'humor.I', 'have', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'why', 'film', 'did', 'nothing', 'provoke', 'laughter.The', 'acting', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'such', 'story', 'slapstick', 'bathroom-humor', 'film', 'quot', 'Something', 'Mary', 'quot', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'try', 'have', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'approach', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'winking', 'audience', 'difference', 'quot', 'Something', 'Mary', 'quot', 'comedic', 'timing', 'worked', 'gags', 'were', 'not', 'predictable.In', 'order', 'rally', 'bowling', 'fans', 'see', 'film', 'many', 'pro', 'bowlers', 'including', 'legendary', 'Mark', 'Roth', 'are', 'given', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'none', 'have', 'more', '1', '2', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'none', 'have', 'dialogue.This', 'film', 'true', 'waste', 'celluloid', 'talent', 'worse', 'waste', 'time', 'watch']",Kingpin VHS

It's a story of a has-been bowler named Roy Munson, played by Harrelson, who had lost his hand after his so-called pal Eddie McCracken, played by Murray, runs off and leaves poor old Roy to the gang of bowlers who just got nailed by the duo. Years later, Roy has become a drunken, out of shape, bald headed loser who discovers an Amish farmer, played by Quiad, who can bowl like a pro, and takes him around the country in his car to hustle and win the bowling championship against his arch-enemy McCracken himself. The movie obviously lampoons such past films as The Color Of Money, with a funny spoof on Indecent Proposal, which starred Harrelson also, which features a cameo by Chris Elliot.The movie is not to be taken seriously at all.

Roy Munson is an up-and-coming bowler when he suffers an accident and loses his bowling hand.  He retreats into the bottle, and leaves bowling behind.  Seventeen years after the accident, Roy sees a possible way out of his problems, Ishmael, an Amish bowler.  Together, the two men team up to get to the Bowling Championship in Reno where the top prize is one million dollars.  At the same time, Roy seeks revenge for what happened to his hand.  As with all Farrelly brother movies, there is your usual gross-out humor that is very funny at times.  This is a funny movie with plenty of good moments and good performances by the cast.Woody Harrelson is great as Roy Munson, the down and out bowler seeking redemption.  Plenty of jokes concern his prostethic hand and also his ever dangerous hook.  Randy Quaid is equally funny as Amish bowling prodigy, Ishmael Boorg.  Bill Murray steals every scene he is in as Ernie ""Big Ern"" McCracken.  At the showdown, Big Ern's ridiculous combover gets more and more out of control as he bowls.  The movie also stars Vanessa Angel, Chris Elliott, and Lin Shaye.  The DVD offers commentary from the Farrelly brothers, deleted scenes, booklet with production notes, theatrical trailers, and widescreen and fullscreen presentation.
