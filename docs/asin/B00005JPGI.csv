650447,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPGI,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","I had very high hopes for this movie.  It stars one of my favorite actresses, Ashley Judd, and it promised to be a return to form for her, her best performance to date, something to finally get her noticed by the academy maybe.  It's a shame that Judd is really the only redeeming factor in this film.  `Come Early Morning' suffers from being just too plain, nothing special indeed.  There really is no life to this movie other than Judd's impressive performance.  I think my wife summed it up best when she said ""she's a whore who had a bad life, end of story"" and that is really the case here.  In fact we never really even get a real glimpse into what made her life so incredibly bad other than she had a philandering father who she never really had a relationship with and the family around her seems to fight an awful lot.The film, written and directed by actress Joey Lauren Adams (who is another one of those talented actresses who never seems to get a break in the right movie), revolves around Lucy Fowler.  She is afraid of rejection more than anything else and so she spends her nights with one stranger after another, drowning her sorrow and or pain in booze.  This is until she meets Cal Percell, a newbie to her town and a gentleman of sorts.  He wants to have a real relationship with Lucy and she seems to want the same with him, but her innate tendencies start to tear them apart before they really have a chance to begin.  She struggles to right things with her father, accompanying him to his new `holy roller' church and she continues to visit and help out her family the best way she can.  She's guided somewhat by her roommate Kim, a young girl who has very different views on love, life and dating.The film fails to really go anywhere.  Its premise is one of promise but it never capitalizes on it.  I saw this playing on Lifetime the other night and I chuckled a little bit because that's what this movie feels like, a Lifetime movie.  The execution is a bit amateurish.  Sure, Lucy may be a character close to Lauren Adams heart but you'd think that she would have really wanted to flesh her out more then.  By the end of the film the audience is left not really caring what happens to Lucy because the film doesn't really give us a reason to.But there is Ashley Judd, and the hype is not overdone.  She really turns out a stand up knock down drag out performance here, really embracing all that she's given despite the lack of real material.  She's completely believable and convincing in her execution.  I really want to see her embraced for her talent because she has so much of it.  Laura Prepon is wasted here as Kim, she really doesn't have much to work with and is kind of left to fall flat on her face.  Jeffrey Donovan is decent here but is overshadowed by Judd's magnificence.  In fact, the only actor that holds him own against Judd is Scott Wilson who plays her father.  The final confrontation between the two is his moment to really shine without even saying a word.  While I feel that the scene should have gone a little deeper his solemn silent performance was touching to say the least.In the end I really can't say much more about the film.  It's not one I would ever recommend to anyone wanting to witness a good film, but if you're a fan of Judd and want to see her really sink her teeth into a performance then watch this for that reason and that reason only.",2,"Could have been better, could have gone deeper but Judd is still fantastic...",1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,3405,"['had', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'promised', 'be', 'return', 'form', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'something', 'finally', 'get', 'noticed', 'academy', 'maybe', 'shame', 'Judd', 'really', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'film', 'Come', 'Early', 'Morning', 'suffers', 'being', 'just', 'too', 'plain', 'nothing', 'special', 'indeed', 'really', 'life', 'movie', 'other', 'Judd', 'impressive', 'performance', 'think', 'wife', 'summed', 'up', 'best', 'when', 'said', 'whore', 'who', 'had', 'bad', 'life', 'end', 'story', 'really', 'case', 'here', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'even', 'get', 'real', 'glimpse', 'what', 'made', 'life', 'so', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'other', 'had', 'philandering', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'relationship', 'family', 'fight', 'awful', 'lot.The', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'actress', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'who', 'one', 'talented', 'actresses', 'who', 'never', 'get', 'break', 'right', 'movie', 'Lucy', 'Fowler', 'afraid', 'rejection', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'so', 'nights', 'one', 'stranger', 'drowning', 'sorrow', 'pain', 'booze', 'Cal', 'Percell', 'newbie', 'town', 'gentleman', 'sorts', 'have', 'real', 'relationship', 'Lucy', 'want', 'same', 'innate', 'tendencies', 'start', 'tear', 'apart', 'really', 'have', 'chance', 'begin', 'right', 'things', 'father', 'accompanying', 'new', 'holy', 'roller', 'church', 'visit', 'help', 'out', 'family', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'guided', 'somewhat', 'roommate', 'Kim', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'very', 'different', 'views', 'love', 'life', 'dating.The', 'film', 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'premise', 'one', 'promise', 'never', 'saw', 'playing', 'Lifetime', 'other', 'night', 'chuckled', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'execution', 'bit', 'amateurish', 'Sure', 'Lucy', 'may', 'be', 'character', 'close', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'heart', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'wanted', 'flesh', 'out', 'more', 'then', 'end', 'film', 'audience', 'left', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'what', 'Lucy', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'reason', 'to.But', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'hype', 'not', 'overdone', 'really', 'out', 'stand', 'up', 'knock', 'down', 'drag', 'performance', 'here', 'really', 'embracing', 'given', 'lack', 'real', 'material', 'completely', 'believable', 'convincing', 'execution', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'embraced', 'talent', 'so', 'much', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'wasted', 'here', 'Kim', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'kind', 'left', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'decent', 'here', 'overshadowed', 'Judd', 'magnificence', 'fact', 'only', 'actor', 'own', 'Judd', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'who', 'father', 'final', 'confrontation', 'two', 'moment', 'really', 'shine', 'even', 'saying', 'word', 'feel', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'little', 'deeper', 'solemn', 'silent', 'performance', 'was', 'touching', 'say', 'least.In', 'end', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'witness', 'good', 'film', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Judd', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'sink', 'teeth', 'performance', 'then', 'watch', 'reason', 'reason', 'only']",Come Early Morning

650453,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005JPGI,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[5, 5]","COME EARLY MORNINGHave you ever seen a movie and thought to yourself afterward that ""man that real"", but not like a documentary but just a piece of cinema that looks like it was plucked out of real life. If you have ever felt that way then chances are that you were watching this one right here. ""Come Early Morning"" is a wonderful little film done marvelously by Joey Lauren Adams of ""Chasing Amy"" fame and starring the great Ashley Judd and of course Jeffrey Donovan. This honestly feels like cameras were set up all around a town and this is what was captured, it feels real.The film follows Lucy Fowler {Judd} on her journey through her thirties waking up every morning next to one useless guy after another. She also is dealing with a father that she is trying desperately to spend time with even though it seems he could care less. So the story goes she is a desperate and confused woman who is only looking for love and acceptance. Of course you could say that her problems with men steams from her estranged relationship with her father. Still she ends up meeting at least one decent guy named Cal Percell {played excellently by Donovan} who seems that he wants a relationship with her despite her problem. It is this relationship here that is the driving force of the film although the time spent with her father and room mate also add interesting dynamics. The great thing about all this is how it all ends.Writer/director Adams proves that all that time spent with Kevin Smith paid off because this is a wonderful debut film. Her direction is excellent but it is her writing that really makes this film so good. Like I said this has to be one of the realest movies I have seen in a while. I like the fact that she didn't romanticize the lead character and her problems, things do not end up like you want them to. This movie has an ending that is probably what would actually happen, how great is that? Even those that have not grown up in a small town can relate to the things going on in this movie.Ashley Judd of course is brilliant as the lost thirty something year old that is trying to find her way. And you know that Jeffery Donovan is excellent as the guy that should have been the one for her. Laura Prepon of ""That 70's Show"" fame is just as good as Judd's room mate and best friend, she even finds love. Also Scott Wilson is brilliant as her finding religion father who seems as out of it as she does. As a matter of fact the entire cast is great and deserves all the credit in the world. Aside from that the film was also shot very well and for such a limited budget it seems like the movie showed the entire town even though it didn't.I would have to say that this is one of the better movies that has come out in a while, and a wonderful debut for a filmmaker. To those who have seem this I say spread the word and review it now. And for those who have yet to see I recommend this as a purchase but I guess you can try a rental. This is a wonderful film with a great cast with real problems that all should be able to relate to. I would love to go about this film but all can come up with is see it, if it isn't your thing that's ok, but for those who like these types of films you will highly enjoy this.",4,"EXCELLENT FILM WITH JEFFERY DONOVAN, ASHLEY JUDD",1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,3230,"['COME', 'EARLY', 'MORNINGHave', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'thought', 'yourself', 'afterward', 'man', 'real', 'not', 'documentary', 'just', 'piece', 'cinema', 'was', 'plucked', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'ever', 'felt', 'way', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'were', 'watching', 'one', 'right', 'here', 'Come', 'Early', 'Morning', 'wonderful', 'little', 'film', 'done', 'marvelously', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'fame', 'starring', 'great', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'course', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'honestly', 'cameras', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'town', 'was', 'captured', 'real.The', 'film', 'Lucy', 'Fowler', 'Judd', 'journey', 'thirties', 'waking', 'up', 'morning', 'one', 'useless', 'guy', 'also', 'dealing', 'father', 'trying', 'desperately', 'spend', 'time', 'even', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'story', 'desperate', 'confused', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'looking', 'love', 'acceptance', 'course', 'could', 'say', 'problems', 'men', 'steams', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'father', 'Still', 'up', 'meeting', 'least', 'one', 'decent', 'guy', 'named', 'Cal', 'Percell', 'played', 'excellently', 'Donovan', 'who', 'relationship', 'problem', 'relationship', 'here', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'time', 'spent', 'father', 'room', 'mate', 'also', 'add', 'interesting', 'dynamics', 'great', 'thing', 'how', 'ends.Writer/director', 'Adams', 'time', 'spent', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'paid', 'off', 'wonderful', 'debut', 'film', 'direction', 'excellent', 'writing', 'really', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'said', 'be', 'one', 'realest', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'romanticize', 'lead', 'character', 'problems', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'want', 'movie', 'ending', 'probably', 'what', 'would', 'actually', 'happen', 'how', 'great', 'Even', 'have', 'not', 'grown', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'can', 'relate', 'things', 'going', 'movie.Ashley', 'Judd', 'course', 'brilliant', 'lost', 'thirty', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'know', 'Jeffery', 'Donovan', 'excellent', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'Laura', 'Prepon', '70', 'Show', 'fame', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Judd', 'room', 'mate', 'best', 'friend', 'even', 'love', 'Also', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'brilliant', 'finding', 'religion', 'father', 'who', 'matter', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'great', 'credit', 'world', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'very', 'well', 'such', 'limited', 'budget', 'movie', 'showed', 'entire', 'town', 'even', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'while', 'wonderful', 'debut', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'have', 'seem', 'say', 'spread', 'word', 'review', 'now', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'guess', 'can', 'try', 'rental', 'wonderful', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'real', 'problems', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'would', 'love', 'go', 'film', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'see', ""n't"", 'thing', 'ok', 'who', 'types', 'films', 'will', 'highly', 'enjoy']",Come Early Morning
650454,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JPGI,Grady Harp,"[19, 20]","COME EARLY MORNING  marks the writing and directing debut of Joey Lauren Adams who elects to share a bit of her birthplace atmosphere in Arkansas and while the story is sound and the writing evocative of the personal turmoil  of little towns populated by good but bored people, there is nothing new here.  But just the opportunity to see gifted actress Ashley Judd strut her stuff is reason enough to watch this little film and makes us wonder where has she been since her 2004 stint in 'De-Lovely'. She is just too fine an actress not to be given more beefy roles.Lucy Fowler (Judd) lives in a little Arkansas town, a successful contractor with boss Owen Allen (Stacy Keach, another underused fine actor), but a woman without a firm attachment to her fragmented family: her shy and sequestered father (Scott Wilson) has returned to town where he hides in alcohol and steps out only for Holy Roller church services; her grandmothers Doll (Candyce Hinkle) is unstable and keeps to herself and Nana (Diane Ladd) remains in a mutually abusive marriage; and her uncle Tim (Tim Blake Nelson) who is the only stalwart member of the clan.  Lucy lives with her friend Kim (Laura Prepon) who understands Lucy's shortcomings: unable to form relationships, Lucy spends her weekends getting drunk at the local tavern and sleeping with anonymous men whom she deserts a dawn.But things change when Lucy encounters Cal Percell (Jeffrey Donovan) who provides her with the first semblance of normalcy in her relationships with men, a frightening new step she abuses by entering into her drinking mode again.  Lucy begins to make changes in her view of her family, her fear of being the mirror image of her father, in her work, and in the way she views men.  And the film just trails off leaving us wondering what life will now be like.Adams has a fine handle on her subject and creates dialog that feels like it should: her election to make such a fine three-dimensional character out of Lucy's father who barely has a line to say is much to her credit (and the strong performance by Scott Wilson!).  But in the end it is the pleasure of seeing Ashley Judd in a meaty role that makes the difference.

650455,A2FEE88JZLDLXZ,B00005JPGI,"H. S. Wedekind ""Mr. Weekend""","[21, 23]","Initially, I was drawn into this small movie and wanted to learn more about Lucy (Ashley Judd) and why she was so self-destructive. She is a strong-willed woman in her 30s who wants to be loved, but seeks out men who don't qualify as anything more than one-night-stands. Lucy works hard in the construction business by day and then transforms into a barfly at night. She does a lot of drinking (this movie is also part info-mercial for a certain light beer) and sleeping around with nameless guys she meets when she's drunk. There's also a side story about a sick dog she takes home that was written into the script for some unknown reason. Eventually, Lucy meets Cal, a nice guy who is in love with his car, and struggles to avoid getting too involved with him. She begins to feel something for Cal, until she senses he wants more than she is willing to give, and then she reverts back to drinking and promiscuity and turns him away. This was the part that didn't quite make this an enjoyable romantic movie for me. Lucy is a very attractive woman (even without makeup and uncombed hair) and has a ""girl-next-door"" innocence...until she becomes a foul-mouthed slut after drinking to excess. Flip-flop personality aside, I was somewhat drawn to her. I won't go into the other characters in the story who happen to be her dysfunctional family. They were generally unhappy and there was a connection between them and Lucy's dark side. It was inferred that she acted the way she did because of her father's drinking and womanizing past. I have to say that I was surprised this movie was praised so highly by many critics.

Well, she was in a total of three movies that involved serial killers and in one of those her scene wasn't used in the final film. The only reason she gets pegged as Thriller Chick is because those are the only films a mass audience has bothered to watch.Thanks to nonexistent media saturation, odds are that they'll miss this independent delight, too. Or if they do watch it, they'll hate it because of the bait-and-switch packaging it's received in its DVD release. The cover promises a light and airy, tied-up-in-a-neat-bow-at-the-end, rom-com confection that is miles removed from the scruffy, minimalist, starkly honest, fair-minded, and open-ended slice of semi-rural life that is contained inside.

Ashley Judd who I enjoyed in the Cole Porter bio picDe-Lovely& ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" does a good job as Lucy Fowler who has a lot of alcohol-soaked one night stands but shies from commitment.  Her performance is rich and varied.  I also liked the male lead Jeffrey Donovan who won Best Supporting Actor for ""Sam & Joe"" in 2003 from the Meth Fest that celebrates the actors' ""method"" for realistic acting.  He's worked in TV series like ""Burn Notice"" with Sharon Gless, ""Crossing Jordan"" & ""The Pretender.""  As Cal Percell, he's a sincere guy who tries to establish a loving relationship with Lucy.  Some of their love scenes are very tender.  Lucy's roommate Kim is played by Laura Prepon from ""That 70s Show"" & ""October Road"" TV series.  Her values are quite different as she's looking for substance over flash.  Scott Wilson does a nice job as Lucy's taciturn dad Lowell that she accompanies to a holy roller church.  Diane Ladd with 3 Oscar nominations including ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" plays her grandmother Nana who is in an abusive relationship.  The film was presented at the Sundance Film Festival.  I think audiences want lovers to get together in the end.  Not having that happen makes the film seem like it's about lost opportunities and poor timing.  While it gives the film depth, it's not quite the happy ending we hope for in a romantic picture.  The performances here are deep and worth viewing.  Adams does a nice job of keeping the pacing brisk and making each supporting character seem to be multi-dimensional.

Lucy Fowler (Ashley Judd) is a construction contractor by day and at night hits the bars of her small Arkansas town to get drunk and pick up men -who disgust her by the time she wakes up with them the next morning. Uncomfortable in social situations without alcohol and likewise with men who don't treat her badly, Lucy craves the love of her distant and disinterested father. When a newcomer to town, Cal Percell (Jeffrey Donovan), is interested in a relationship, not just a one-night stand, Lucy is wary but gives it a try in her own self-defeating way.Lucy's emotional journey just failed to capture my interest. This territory has been covered many times before. The promiscuous woman who uses sex as a substitute for fatherly love is a clich&eacute; -and probably a disingenuous one. Ashley Judd looks like she gained weight for the role, and Lucy rarely parts or brushes her hair. These attempts to ""ugly her up"" are conspicuous. Ashley Judd is an attractive woman, and any small-town thirty-something woman who looked like her would be aware of that. Women that age are desperate to preserve their looks, not vandalize them. There is no reason for this character to be plain when she obviously isn't. Ultimately, Lucy is a nice woman whose problems are not so momentous as she thinks, but I tired of her angst and histrionics before the film was over.The DVD (Weinstein Company 2007): This is a two-sided disc with a widescreen version of the film on one side and full screen version on the other.

The aspect of euthanizing aloved pet, found on the side of a road, also pulls onthe heart strings of the audience, as does theheartbreak shown to be had by the actress.The script doesn't shy away from showing familyconflicts, the elderly, the passed away, the relationsof adults in motels, trucks, night clubs and bars.Interestingly, the moral dimension of human beings isbrought into the story, as one-night-stands time andagain, result in confusion, pain, anguish, suffering,tantrums, profanity directed at loved ones, tarnishedreputations, etc.Religion is suggested as an outlet that can alleviateemotional pain, and also, physical frailty.Every 5 minutes, it seems someone is opening up abottle of bear, having a smoke, an adult seekingcompanionship, or intimacy.Overall, this movie is scary for someone looking for anuplifting experience at the theatre, but a good DVDrental.",3,"A good DVD rental,. more than an uplifting experience at the theatre",1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,2609,"['Come', 'Early', 'Morning', '2006', 'story', 'too', 'close', 'forcomfort', 'reality', 'matter', 'asignificant', 'part', 'USA', 'population', 'anon-megacity', 'lifestyle', 'residing', 'mainly', 'theMid-West.Based', 'story', 'be', 'rooted', 'back', 'the1970', 'perhaps', '1980', 'modern', 'times', 'reachesall', 'corners', 'country', 'snail', 'pace', 'unevenly', 'fair', 'bit', '70', 'pickup', 'trucks', 'traditional', 'country', 'music', 'etc.The', 'movie', 'heavily', 'rooted', 'promiscuouslifestyle', 'number', 'adult', 'men', 'women', 'thetown', 'driving', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'whatthey', 'want', 'life', 'personal', 'relationships', 'being', 'truly', 'chaotic', 'intimacy', 'realm', 'oftenjumping', 'partner', 'partner.The', 'soundtrack', 'key', 'role', 'carrying', 'story', 'building', 'small-town', 'countryside', 'atmosphere', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Bobby', 'Dylan-like', 'etc', 'filmingis', 'crystal', 'clear', 'song', 'selections', 'wisely', 'chosen.If', 'perhaps', 'questionable', 'approach', 'theexcess', 'detail', 'bed-side', 'scenes', 'nevergraphic', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'tend', 'tozoom', 'center', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'tight', 'jeans', 'pants', 'andbackside', 'even', 'tight', 'tank', 'tops', 'loosefitting', 'open', 'ones', 'underwear', 'showing', 'herpulling', 'down', 'pants', 'putting', 'pants', 'forexample.Judd', 'also', 'paired', 'attractive', 'blonde', 'herroommate', 'throwing', 'extra', 'eye-candy', 'sell', 'theworth.This', 'approach', 'selling', 'film', 'touching', 'akind', 'voyeurism', 'actress', 'pretext', 'ofmaking', 'story', 'hit', 'home', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'byall', 'audience.At', 'same', 'time', 'doubt', 'whatsoever', 'areal', 'segment', 'USA', 'population', 'indeed', 'itselfin', 'lifestyle', 'depicted', 'aspect', 'euthanizing', 'aloved', 'pet', 'found', 'side', 'road', 'also', 'onthe', 'heart', 'strings', 'audience', 'theheartbreak', 'shown', 'be', 'had', 'actress.The', 'script', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'showing', 'familyconflicts', 'elderly', 'passed', 'away', 'relationsof', 'adults', 'motels', 'trucks', 'night', 'clubs', 'bars.Interestingly', 'moral', 'dimension', 'human', 'beings', 'isbrought', 'story', 'one-night-stands', 'time', 'andagain', 'result', 'confusion', 'pain', 'anguish', 'suffering', 'tantrums', 'profanity', 'directed', 'loved', 'ones', 'tarnishedreputations', 'etc.Religion', 'suggested', 'outlet', 'can', 'alleviateemotional', 'pain', 'also', 'physical', 'frailty.Every', '5', 'minutes', 'someone', 'opening', 'up', 'abottle', 'bear', 'having', 'smoke', 'adult', 'seekingcompanionship', 'intimacy.Overall', 'movie', 'scary', 'someone', 'looking', 'anuplifting', 'experience', 'theatre', 'good', 'DVDrental']",Come Early Morning
