By the end of that hour, I felt like I had just sat through an entire feature film and was clamouring for more. Sutherland and Hurt both turn in powerful performance as a hitman for hire and a Catholic Priest with his own closet of skeletons.While the debate philosophical issues revolving around good and evil, the viewers get to see defining moments from Sutherland's past. While often quite visceral, there is no denying that very best scenes are those that take place inside the confessional with only Hurt, Sutherland and the divider.

1503925,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005TZFZ5Q,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[23, 23]","For those that don't follow the increasingly complex world of Internet entertainment, Brad Mirman's series of webisodes entitled ""The Confession"" has been packaged as a feature film DVD.  Airing as original episodes on Hulu for a nine week run, this may well set the standard for sophisticated and professional programming for a new age.  The taut and dramatic screenplay unravels as basically just a verbal exchange between two men.  But when those men are Keifer Sutherland and John Hurt, both giving riveting performances, the screen is alive with electricity.  The webisodes blend seamlessly into a feature that runs just shy of seventy minutes.  ""The Confession,"" with Sutherland as an enigmatic hitman, may not meet the violence and action quota that many similar stories would choose.  It is, instead, something much more interesting--almost like a dynamic two man play (with flashes of other characters and peripheral material).  While mostly just talk, it is still ceaselessly entertaining and tense.The plot is not that unexpected, truth be told.  Sutherland steps into a confessional with priest Hurt ready to absolve his sins.  But he isn't seeking forgiveness, he is pushing to understand Hurt's theological perspective on the nature of good versus evil.  Is he trying to reconcile his criminal lifestyle?  Perhaps seeking redemption?  Playing mind games? Or trying to provoke this man of God?  Through a series of flashbacks, his ulterior motives will be revealed.  I wasn't particularly surprised about where this sordid little tale led (it seems rather apparent), but it is always a fascinating journey to get there.If I was rating ""The Confession"" as a straight-up movie, I might give it four stars.  The two leads are absolutely mesmerizing and make this a can't miss proposition.  The dialogue is sharp, snappy, and appropriately introspective.  It is a solid short film.  However as something produced as original web content, ""The Confession"" easily earns five stars for its level of technical proficiency.  If this is the future of entertainment and this is the quality of content that we can expect, than count me in!  I commend everyone involved for raising this medium to a new level of excellence--but once again shout out to great, great performances by Sutherland and Hurt!  The DVD extras include 4 back story episodes about some of the supporting roles that don't add a whole lot to the experience.  But it is also loaded with behind-the-scenes features and interviews that capture almost every element of the production.  Check it out!

1503926,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B005TZFZ5Q,MadMacs,"[6, 7]","I knew something was odd when the rental download was completed and it registered just a bit over one hour in length. Had no idea this was a speciality production, created as part of an anthology that was viewable via the web. It plays however, much in the vein as a made-for-tv movie.Not that that would be a deterrence, excellence in tv movies is not uncommon. Especially given that, in addition to taking on the lead role, this was also produced by Keifer.However, that bona fides aside, 'Confession' is not a particularly novel idea. I've screened several productions over the years where the characters argue 'good' versus 'evil' and the true nature of humanity. And I've even seen it in this very configuration, utilizing an assassin and a priest.But it's Keifer Sutherland wielding the weapon, and that carries a much greater impact, a depth of interest given his performance over the past decade as his tv alter-ego,Jack Bauer.The film opens as the assassin enters a confessional on Christmas Eve. He confronts the priest there, telling him that they are going to debate the qualities of God and man's inhumanity -or- someone will die that very night. He's deadly serious.Again, I've seen this before and the plot is not particularly creative.

The fact is that &#8220;The Confession&#8221; is a webseries, or mini-series exclusively made for the internet, that premiered online on March 28, 2011.Kiefer Sutherland plays a mysterious visitor to a church, where he confesses that he has just killed a man. John Hurt is a priest who listens to the stranger&#8217;s confession. In flashbacks we see what Kiefer Sutherland&#8217;s character did, and by the time the film ends, we also learn why the stranger insists that the priest should listen to his stories.Because considerable portion of the story takes place in a confessional, where the two main characters exchange philosophical dialogue about morality, &#8220;The Confession&#8221; (divided into ten &#8220;chapters&#8221;) feels like watching a stage play.Both leading stars turn in credible acting performance, but some may think 60 odd minutes are too short for us to get to know their characters, with a resolution that feels slightly incomplete. Maybe I felt so because I am too much accustomed to conventional film/TV format.
