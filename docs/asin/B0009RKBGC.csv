All we did was walk them everyday (instead of every other day), remaining calm and assertive, etc. which this DVD shows you how to do.Thanks Cesar!

That is until I discovered Cesar Millan's TV show ""The Dog Whisperer"".  Then I realized how much more there was to learn.  So I was thrilled when his DVD ""People Training for Dogs"" was released and couldn't wait for it to arrive.Since I've taped all his shows, I was glad that this DVD was primarily an hour long lecture on dog psychology.  I was most impressed with the content.  Cesar covers all the key elements we 'humans' need to understand (including the 'why' of it all) in order to become the calm and assertive pack leader that is so crucial in creating that perfect canine/human relationship.I also like that the DVD contains a Chapter Section, making it quick and easy to review specific segments of information.  And the section on Cesar feeding his 30+ pack of dogs was amazing to say the least.I can't say enough good things about this DVD.  It contains a wealth of valuable information and insights that every dog owner can benefit from knowing.  I HIGHLY recommend it for every dog owner, but almost more importantly, for every person even contemplating having a dog as part of their household.  This is critical information you need to know and understand so it can be implemented from day one, thus eliminating the potential for bad behaviors to manifest.",5,"Fabulous Introduction to Understanding Dog Psychology - A ""Must Have"" For Every Dog Owner",1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1370,"['have', 'done', 'pet', 'behavior', 'counseling', 'many', 'years', 'so', 'thought', 'knew', 'few', 'things', 'dogs', 'discovered', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'TV', 'show', 'Dog', 'Whisperer', 'Then', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'there', 'was', 'learn', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'DVD', 'People', 'Training', 'Dogs', 'was', 'released', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'arrive.Since', ""'ve"", 'taped', 'shows', 'was', 'glad', 'DVD', 'was', 'primarily', 'hour', 'long', 'lecture', 'dog', 'psychology', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'content', 'Cesar', 'key', 'elements', ""'humans"", 'need', 'understand', 'including', ""'why"", ""'"", 'order', 'become', 'calm', 'assertive', 'pack', 'leader', 'so', 'crucial', 'creating', 'perfect', 'canine/human', 'relationship.I', 'also', 'DVD', 'Chapter', 'Section', 'making', 'quick', 'easy', 'review', 'specific', 'segments', 'information', 'section', 'Cesar', 'feeding', '30+', 'pack', 'dogs', 'was', 'amazing', 'say', 'least.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'DVD', 'wealth', 'valuable', 'information', 'insights', 'dog', 'owner', 'can', 'benefit', 'knowing', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'dog', 'owner', 'almost', 'more', 'importantly', 'person', 'even', 'contemplating', 'having', 'dog', 'part', 'household', 'critical', 'information', 'need', 'know', 'understand', 'can', 'be', 'implemented', 'day', 'one', 'thus', 'eliminating', 'potential', 'bad', 'behaviors', 'manifest']","People Training for Dogs (Cesar Millan's Mastering Leadership Series, Vol. 1)"

He presents it in a very understandable way though on TV.I noted he was very specific on ""putting out the calm, assertive energy"" --which some readers took literally & grew angry that he didn't explain how to grow that ""magic energy"" or whatever... He means carry your face, hands, body & voice in a very calm, quiet, assertive manner, like a top executive, not like a scared, shivering little girl, or an aggressive mean Tasmanian Devil, or a Flapping Bozo the Clown. Note this works on people too.I wholeheartedly agree on exercise working like Dog (& human) Prozac, and it creates a more manageable dog. 4H, again! It also works to control anxiety & concentration in humans & animals.I never thought about dog backpacks and have HUGE hopes for it. I'd been trying to think of something that'd wear them down a bit. Currently, I have to struggle and fight my way to the 4th lap around the block---by then, they are much calmer & easier to walk. They are easy to walk by themselves, but maybe that pack mentality makes them nutso together. If I leave one at home, he screams, jumps on the window.On one show, he had the dog pull a skateboarder or roller-skating person. My sister had great results with her boxer pulling her on skates--(use a helmet & guards).Note on his TV show, there is a frequent disclaimer: ""Do not attempt by yourself, get a professional to help you.""I totally agree with this--I've seen people totally misinterpret things on their own in totally goofy, usually lazy & self-serving ways and the pet is the ultimate victim.",5,"Excellent Guy, but don't neglect Taking Good Classes",1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,1799,"['Mom', 'recorded', 'bunch', 'TV', 'shows', 'not-so-subtle', 'hint', 'have', 'two', 'extremely', 'high-energy', 'border-collie/retriever', 'mixes', 'wilder', 'previous', 'dogs', ""'ve"", 'had.I', 'was', 'hooked', 'Cesar', 'messages', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'compatible', 'standard', '4H', 'dog', 'training', 'very', 'understandable', 'way', 'TV.I', 'noted', 'was', 'very', 'specific', 'putting', 'out', 'calm', 'assertive', 'energy', 'readers', 'took', 'literally', 'grew', 'angry', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'grow', 'magic', 'energy', 'carry', 'face', 'hands', 'body', 'voice', 'very', 'calm', 'quiet', 'assertive', 'manner', 'top', 'executive', 'not', 'scared', 'shivering', 'little', 'girl', 'aggressive', 'mean', 'Tasmanian', 'Devil', 'Flapping', 'Bozo', 'Clown', 'Note', 'people', 'too.I', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'exercise', 'working', 'Dog', 'human', 'Prozac', 'more', 'manageable', 'dog', '4H', 'again', 'also', 'control', 'anxiety', 'concentration', 'humans', 'animals.I', 'never', 'thought', 'dog', 'backpacks', 'have', 'HUGE', ""'d"", 'been', 'trying', 'think', 'something', ""'d"", 'wear', 'down', 'bit', 'Currently', 'have', 'struggle', 'fight', 'way', '4th', 'lap', 'block', '-by', 'then', 'are', 'much', 'calmer', 'easier', 'walk', 'are', 'easy', 'walk', 'maybe', 'pack', 'mentality', 'nutso', 'together', 'leave', 'one', 'home', 'jumps', 'window.On', 'one', 'show', 'had', 'dog', 'skateboarder', 'roller-skating', 'person', 'sister', 'had', 'great', 'results', 'boxer', 'pulling', 'skates', 'helmet', 'guards', '.Note', 'TV', 'show', 'frequent', 'disclaimer', 'Do', 'not', 'attempt', 'get', 'professional', 'help', 'totally', 'agree', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'totally', 'misinterpret', 'things', 'own', 'totally', 'goofy', 'usually', 'lazy', 'self-serving', 'ways', 'pet', 'ultimate', 'victim']","People Training for Dogs (Cesar Millan's Mastering Leadership Series, Vol. 1)"
911124,AXPHBN3HAWW7I,B0009RKBGC,"Pamela M-L ""Pit Bull lover""","[14, 14]","I have been watching Cesar Millan's television program for a few months now and was delighted to see that he had come out with a DVD, which I bought as soon as I knew about it. When I first started watching Cesar, I didn't like some of the things he said because I had so humanized my dog, I treated him like a 4-legged child. I couldn't argue with Cesar's dramatic results, though - often seeing years'-long behavior problems eliminated within the course of one session with Cesar. Gradually, my mindset began to shift, and I came to realize that understanding dogs AS THEY ARE was the best gift I could give to my own dog, Connor. I've come to respect Connor's ""dog-ness"" instead of seeing him through the eyes of human psychology. I am now happy to report that, just by implementing what I've learned from Cesar, my 3-yr-old American Pit Bull Terrier, who had become increasingly dog-aggressive, now goes to local dog parks and plays happily with other dogs! I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. To anyone who has trouble with the message (which is clearly and logically presented), I would say give it a chance, and give it some time! You may be surprised to find that your own way of perceiving dogs will shift.",5,An Essential Perspective,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1221,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'television', 'program', 'few', 'months', 'now', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'bought', 'as', 'soon', 'knew', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'Cesar', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'things', 'said', 'had', 'so', 'humanized', 'dog', 'treated', '4-legged', 'child', 'could', ""n't"", 'argue', 'Cesar', 'dramatic', 'results', 'often', 'seeing', ""years'-long"", 'behavior', 'problems', 'eliminated', 'course', 'one', 'session', 'Cesar', 'Gradually', 'mindset', 'began', 'shift', 'came', 'realize', 'understanding', 'dogs', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'was', 'best', 'gift', 'could', 'give', 'own', 'dog', 'Connor', ""'ve"", 'come', 'respect', 'Connor', 'dog-ness', 'instead', 'seeing', 'eyes', 'human', 'psychology', 'am', 'now', 'happy', 'report', 'just', 'implementing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'Cesar', '3-yr-old', 'American', 'Pit', 'Bull', 'Terrier', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'increasingly', 'dog-aggressive', 'now', 'local', 'dog', 'parks', 'plays', 'happily', 'other', 'dogs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'highly', 'enough', 'anyone', 'who', 'trouble', 'message', 'clearly', 'logically', 'presented', 'would', 'say', 'give', 'chance', 'give', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'perceiving', 'dogs', 'will', 'shift']","People Training for Dogs (Cesar Millan's Mastering Leadership Series, Vol. 1)"

While the information was what you hear in the show, it was sketchy, and not enhanced by having him delivering it in a conference room, away from dog examples.  Basically it was Cesar saying what he says in every show, but without the dogs.  I suppose it's a fair summary of his philosophy but that can be reduced to a scant paragraph as others have mentioned -  walk your dog, be first going out the door, etc.  I was just expecting something more or new.  The ""extras"" -- cesar feeding the pack, and the ""pilot"" demo, were very short. And he doesn't feed the whole pack but only a few. I would have liked to see him feed the whole pack successively - we never saw the first dogs get off the table and the others come up and that would have been interesting to see the first give way, etc. (and there were enough dogs there for 3 waves of that). Basically, I think you can get this same info watching any hour show, and you won't see the dogs in this.  but for Cesar fans I suppose it is a must.
