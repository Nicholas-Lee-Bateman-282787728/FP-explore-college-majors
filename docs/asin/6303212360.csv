363711,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6303212360,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","""The Boy Who Could Fly"" was one of those movies for us 80s kids that you remember seeing a lot on HBO and watched dozens of times, only to discover later on that the movie was practically non-existent at the box office and has become a forgotten film that hardly anyone knows. But for those of us who know and remember, it remains a very fond memory from a time when they still made great movies like this.The movie centers on young Milly (the adorable Lucy Deakins), who moves into a new home with her mom and little brother, Lewis. Milly soon learns of the strange boy, Eric Gibb (Jay Underwood), who lives next door. He doesn't speak and sits on his second story window sill pretending to be a plane and flying. Milly soon befriends the young boy and learns that they are both dealing with significant losses in their life. Can Milly break Eric out of his shell? Can he be saved from the people who want to send him to an institution? And can he really fly?""The Boy Who Could Fly"" is a movie that I am re-discovering for the first time in over 20 years. It's been hard to get. I am happy to say that the movie has completely charmed me all over again with that ""only in the 80s"" sense of awe and wonder and complete and total magic. It's a fantasy that is grounded in the real world with two teenage characters who are suffering losses in their lives and end up finding kindred spirits in each other. It's a classic tale that is wonderfully and upliftingly told in a way that could not be done in our hard edged, cynical, super-realistic movies of today. Why is that? Come on, Hollywood! Even though the movie has a whimsical tone and a fantasy element, it relies on these two main characters and the recent struggles they've been through and continue to go through. It's touching and moving without piling it on too much, and makes you feel and inspires you.The movie is helped along with a truly outstanding supporting cast. This includes Bonnie Bedelia (TV's ""Parenthood"", ""Die Hard""), Fred Savage (""The Wonder  Years""), Mindy Cohn (""The Facts Of Life""), Fred Gwynne (""The Munsters""), Colleen Dewhurst, and a special cameo appearance by Louise Fletcher (""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""). The film was written and directed by Nick Castle, who also did the wonderful 1984 film, ""The Last Starfighter"", and also played Michael Meyers in the original ""Halloween"" movie. It is a very solid and capable cast. There's Someone here for past generations who will be delighted in seeing, especially Herman Munster himself. Everyone is wonderful and believable in their roles. But our main two stars are the focus. Lucy Deakins is beautiful in that sweet, lovely, girl-next-door look. Why did she disappear? And Jay Underwood wonderfully brings Eric to life.""The Boy Who Could Fly"" is a wonderful and hopeful movie that brought back so many wonderful memories. As I mentioned before, it's a movie I hadn't seen in two decades or more. The second it started, I remembered every single scene, every frame, and it was a delight. It was a special movie back then, and it deserves to continue to be so and delight and attract new generations of fans. Seriously, why can't we still make movies like this that so once meant something to us in childhood?",5,You'll Believe A Boy Can Fly,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,3243,"['Boy', 'Who', 'Could', 'Fly', 'was', 'one', 'movies', '80s', 'kids', 'remember', 'seeing', 'lot', 'HBO', 'watched', 'dozens', 'times', 'only', 'discover', 'later', 'movie', 'was', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'box', 'office', 'become', 'forgotten', 'film', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'remember', 'very', 'fond', 'memory', 'time', 'when', 'still', 'made', 'great', 'movies', 'this.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'young', 'Milly', 'adorable', 'Lucy', 'Deakins', 'who', 'new', 'home', 'mom', 'little', 'brother', 'Lewis', 'Milly', 'soon', 'strange', 'boy', 'Eric', 'Gibb', 'Jay', 'Underwood', 'who', 'next', 'door', ""n't"", 'speak', 'sits', 'second', 'story', 'window', 'sill', 'pretending', 'be', 'plane', 'flying', 'Milly', 'soon', 'young', 'boy', 'are', 'dealing', 'significant', 'losses', 'life', 'Can', 'Milly', 'break', 'Eric', 'shell', 'Can', 'be', 'saved', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'send', 'institution', 'can', 'really', 'fly', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Could', 'Fly', 'movie', 'am', 're-discovering', 'first', 'time', '20', 'years', 'been', 'hard', 'get', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'movie', 'completely', 'charmed', 'over', 'again', 'only', '80s', 'sense', 'awe', 'wonder', 'complete', 'total', 'magic', 'fantasy', 'grounded', 'real', 'world', 'two', 'teenage', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'losses', 'lives', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'other', 'classic', 'tale', 'wonderfully', 'upliftingly', 'told', 'way', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'hard', 'edged', 'cynical', 'super-realistic', 'movies', 'today', 'Why', 'Come', 'Hollywood', 'Even', 'movie', 'whimsical', 'tone', 'fantasy', 'element', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'recent', 'struggles', ""'ve"", 'been', 'continue', 'go', 'touching', 'moving', 'piling', 'too', 'much', 'feel', 'you.The', 'movie', 'helped', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'TV', 'Parenthood', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Munsters', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'special', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Nick', 'Castle', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'wonderful', '1984', 'film', 'Last', 'Starfighter', 'also', 'played', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'original', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'very', 'solid', 'capable', 'cast', 'Someone', 'here', 'past', 'generations', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'seeing', 'especially', 'Herman', 'Munster', 'Everyone', 'wonderful', 'believable', 'roles', 'main', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'focus', 'Lucy', 'Deakins', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'lovely', 'girl-next-door', 'look', 'Why', 'did', 'disappear', 'Jay', 'Underwood', 'wonderfully', 'Eric', 'life', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Could', 'Fly', 'wonderful', 'hopeful', 'movie', 'brought', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'two', 'decades', 'more', 'second', 'started', 'remembered', 'single', 'scene', 'frame', 'was', 'delight', 'was', 'special', 'movie', 'back', 'then', 'continue', 'be', 'so', 'delight', 'attract', 'new', 'generations', 'fans', 'Seriously', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'still', 'make', 'movies', 'so', 'once', 'meant', 'something', 'childhood']",N/A
363712,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6303212360,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[2, 2]","The 80s had a lot of great movies from a variety of genres. And with the bevy of great teen flicks, it's easy to forget or overloook a few gems, especially if you didn't catch them during their first runs at the theater or on TV. ""The Boy Who Could Fly"" is one of those kind of movies. It didn't get the kind of attention, publicity or promotion that, say, the John Hughes-Brat Pack teen flicks did. But box office aside, this movie didn't need it. It stands on its own feet. Though this movie didn't star what could be considered any big names at the time, a lot of great performances by ""soon to bees"" give this movie a true heart. Since this movie isn't saturated with dialogue or contain a steady pace of action, the heartwarming story is accomplished through fine direction that gets outstanding performances from the entire cast: the adorable and accomplished Lucy Deakins, a very young Fred Savage, Bonnie Bedelia (pre-""Die-Hard""), Mindy Cohn (""Facts of Life""), Colleen Dewhurst, Fred Gwynne (whom directors in the 80s finally realized could act without his Herman Munster costume), and a cameo by effectively typecast Louise Fletcher. It's a great mix of young actors and experienced veterans who create an inspiring, touching story that provides encouraging lessons with such subtlety, you wonder where that lump in your throat came from by the movie's end. I always wanted to see more of Deakins and was disappointed she made so few movies. But I was more impressed to see what she'd done with herself around her movie career. With such a background it's easy to see why her performance as Milly seemed so effortless.

363723,ALP5YTSQO6VMD,6303212360,Gregory Dowling,"[3, 4]","&quot;The Boy Who Could Fly&quot; is such a rarity in the genre.  This is not so much a kid's movie, as it is a full-blooded drama that happens to have kids as characters.  It tells the story of a family, suffering the loss of their father/husband.  The decline in income requires them to move into a &quot;fixer upper&quot; home in a quiet residential neighborhood.  The eldest child, Millie (beautifully played by Lucy Deakins) becomes fascinated with the teenage autistic boy next door, Eric (Jay Underwood) who sits in his window all day and pretends to fly.  Through circumstances at school, Millie takes him on as a &quot;project.&quot; As her kindly teacher(Colleen Dewhurst) points out, &quot;Doctors haven't been able to get a word out of him.  Maybe a friend could.&quot;  She tries to draw him out of his condition through every day activities, and over time, the form a very close connection, and even fall in love.  Meanwhile, Millie must deal with the burdens of home, trying to reconcile the suicide of her father, and her very stressed out and grief-stricken mother(the wonderful Bonnie Bedelia), who is trying to get back into the work force.While there is certainly more to the story than this, it would be a shame to spoil details for those who have not seen this film.  It is uncommonly intelligent, charming, and very moving.  It speaks in the language of children, without ever becoming condescending or silly, even when the film's more fantastic elements are revealed.  The story and its characters feel real.  Their grief feels real.  Their longing to believe in happy endings feels real.The performances are outstanding.  Lucy Deakins and Jay Underwood are entirely convincing.  It's so rare to see a teenage girl portrayed with this kind of uncynical intelligence.  Underwood's Eric barely has any lines in the film, but instead, like a young Harrison Ford, communicates so much in his face that we hardly notice.  This is a teen romance for the ages.The adult players are also fine.  Bonnie Bedelia, one of the most convincing actors or our era, plays Charlene as tough yet fragile, nurturing but flawed. The late Colleen Dewhurst is lovely and compassionate as Mrs. Sherman.Surprisingly the film has been written and directed by Nick Castle, known for such disappointments as &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot; and &quot;The Last Starfighter.&quot;  He is better known as being the 1st actor to play Michael Myers in the original &quot;Halloween.&quot;  This is his best film by far.

Every other week we are tortured with some nonsense of this caliber and whenever I wish for a movie that stands out from the crowd I have to go back in time and consider some overlooked gem. The Boy Who Could Fly is exactly that.The characters seem so real and their emotions genuine, it builds at a slow pace but it never gets boring and story development is consistent. This is not a ferociously loud summer crowd-pleaser or something bloated with pointless SFX. Very few movies have the power to make a whole story out of characters and situation alone without feeling the need for some ridiculous set piece or blaring thrash metal guitars.In fact Bruce Broughton's score is the wonderful opposite of that. The performances, especially the two leads, are flawless and the direction is far more refined than the typical. Everything in this movie comes together perfectly to make a film so unique and charming. If you have lost your faith in the current dreck that graces our screens and if you want a family movie with some meaning and subtext then check this out. And keep an eye out for director John Carpenter as on of the Coupe De Villes.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 2.0.

363726,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,6303212360,Irishgirl,"[7, 8]","Ahhh, ""The Boy Who Could Fly."" This is a film that I grew up with and still share with my family today. This is a true inspirational film that is for all ages and families across the miles and sends a wonderful message to those who have been through pain, been down on their luck, or just simply want to believe in something positive. This message is brought forth through an unlikely pair who with their friendship and love, literally learn to fly.Millie Michaelson (played by the lovely Lucy Deakins) is a shy 14 year-old who, along with her mother (played by the talented Bonnie Bedelia) and kid brother Louis, (played by a very young Fred Savage) is struggling to come to grips with the tragic death of her father. They are the new family on the block, at work and at school as they try to rebuild their lives after moving into a new home. They all struggle with the normal hassles of life. Louis, who tries to act tough and wants to be a soldier like the G.I. Joe's he plays with, faces neighborhood bullies who won't let him get around the block and keeps getting in trouble at school. Millie, who becomes friends with Geneva (played by the hilarious Mindy Cohn), goes through the coming-of-age rituals of adjusting to a new school and the popular girls and the temptations of alcohol. Mrs. Michaelson struggles with learning how to use a computer in the insurance business (and keep in mind, this movie was made in 1986 when computers were still relatively new).But from the moment Millie first sets foot in her new home, she finds out that they have not moved into any ordinary neighborhood. The strange boy next door instantly intrigues Millie. Eric Gibb (a magnificent performance from Jay Underwood) lives with his lazy, alcoholic uncle (played by the convincing and entertaining Fred Gwynne) and does not speak nor does he show emotion. But one thing he does do is sit on the windowsill and pretend to fly. Nobody can seem to get through to him and nobody can really understand him accept that he may be autistic. But Millie learns that Eric's own deep dark tragedy concerning his parents is likely reflected in his obsession with flying.Eric is in Millie's class at school, taught by Ms. Sherman (played by the late, extraordinary Colleen Dewhurst). Sherman, who has been helping Eric for quite a while, notices a connection between he and Millie. She sees Eric doing things around Millie that no doctor could do with him. Millie agrees to help Ms. Sherman by spending time with Eric in an effort to break him of his emotional disturbances and keep him out of the mental institution and the workers there who have been after him. Millie reads to Eric, plays with him in gym class, has lunch with him everyday at school, makes paper airplanes with him and he even comes home with Millie for dinner with her family.As Millie and Eric get closer, Millie seems to find the true Eric hiding behind his emotion-less face. The two develop a very special relationship. All the while, dramatic things happen, which test their love and friendship for one another, from Millie's concussion during a fall, to Eric's run-in with the institution, to the chase they have with the institution workers, to the dramatic climax on the roof. But the hardest test of all comes after their flight, however from that day forward, things start taking a better turn for Millie and her family and even Eric's uncle.But in the long run, Millie and her family realize that Eric was perhaps a symbol of what we can all do if we try, wish and love enough. When we feel like life is too much we can remember Eric Gibb and how he could teach us all to fly. I think Millie taught Eric to really fly in more ways than one. Millie was there for Eric during a time of need and she lifted him out from under his shell if you will. In turn, Eric taught Millie to fly with his inspiration to wish, dream and love. And look what came of it? Millie learned that anything is possible if we wish, dream and love enough. Louise Fletcher made a brief appearance as a psychiatrist, Dr. Grinada who talked with Millie after she had gotten a concussion. She told Millie: ""Sometimes you have to believe in a little magic, especially when there's so much pain."" And rightfully so. Both Millie and Eric have dealt with tremendous pain in their lives, but with each other, they both learned to fly together.This movie is absolutely superb for the family. It sends such a positive message to those who may feel discouraged in life. But it is also inspiring to those who do not get discouraged easily. It's just a nice, feel-good story; a true heartfelt drama with plenty of real emotion, and even action. The cast is outstanding. All do a tremendous job. Lucy Deakins and Bonnie Bedelia are excellent at portraying deep emotion from tears to anger. Jay Underwood does a superb job of playing the emotionally disturbed Eric Gibb. He is so believable. He can go from having no emotion to just the right amount of it at the right time. Jay is indeed a very versatile actor who can touch on all the human emotions effectively. Then there's little Fred Savage, who actually adds comic relief to the film with his macho attitude. Mindy Cohn is awesome as Geneva. She may play a small part, but she's such a kick. The music of the film is beautiful and they even throw in some special effects complete with fireworks, as you'll see in Millie's dream sequence. The special features are a real treat, with a really cool theatrical trailer, and introduction featuring Jay Underwood and a commentary with Underwood, Lucy Deakins, Fred Savage and director Nick Castle. Together, they are quite an entertaining bunch who sound like they're decent ordinary people have a great time talking with one another and the audience about their personal experiences with the film and various other stories.When I was a little kid.

His parents died in a plane crash and ever since he has been pretending to be an airplane as the only way to save them.But when daughter becomes intrigued by the boy and begins to reach out to him, it becomes clear that the two share a connection.

363730,A22MQ2OAHY8SIJ,6303212360,"KittyKins ""KittyKins""","[0, 0]","I want to start out this review by saying that I love this movie.  It has a special quality that I can't quite put my finger on, but I think it encourages one to look beyond oneself and to think on deeper matters.  It's a bit disturbing at times, but at the same time it is a touching love story.  There are a lot of lessons presented in this movie including learning to trust and love again after tremendous personal loss.  Also, that there is hope, and we should not give up despite tragic circumstances or difficulties in life.Eric and Millie are both dealing with death in different ways.  Eric's parents died in a plane crash when he was very young and after that point, living with his uncle who is an alcoholic, he retreats into a world that seems similar to autism. I looked online to see if emotional disturbance could cause autism, and I came up blank, except that Bruno Bethleheim was an ""expert"" who believed that autism was caused by traumatic experiences because the children affected had unloving mothers. Autism experts believe this to be a dark time in the field of Autism, and his ideas weren't followed for long, fortunately.  I don't suppose it matters why Eric withdraws, but I think that the beauty of this story is that two people learn to love each other unconditionally despite their setbacks or disabilities.  Millie is on a similar journey to Eric in that she is dealing with the loss of her father to suicide.  I feel the white rose with a hint of pink, represents hope in the presence of grieving from the loss of a loved one.Putting all the deep meanings aside, as one can appreciate this movie on two different levels; I think it is a touching love story with lots of special moments that those with romantic sensibilities can enjoy.  I love the cloud dream sequence, wow!  The acting is superb especially by Lucy Deakins who plays Millie.  Fred Savage is just adorable as the younger brother.

I thought it was creative and inventive and it went on the premise that what you believe in - can be real.It's completely fiction and almost science fiction but it works. Jay Underwood plays a boy orphaned because of plane accident. He becomes a recluse and a mute. Then his new neighbor a young girl who is also his age befriends him.Convinced she can help him she makes an effort to communicate with him. He is a social misfit, however, he has one gift and talent that he keeps hidden well - he can fly.A great premise and some good special wire effects (perfected because of the Superman films) the film is very simple but it has a sweet and warm chocolaty center. Bruce Broughton did a wonderful score for the film.Special note: If you go to see a movie at the Hollywood's El Capitan - it is the score from this film that you hear as they open the curtains to view each movie. It is a wonderful score and cue that goes well with the film.Not on DVD yet, but if it ever does - I hope it has extras.

It reminded me of one of those TV movies or a true-life film, which my mum watches constantly, and they don't normally appeal to me. It was a bit slow to start with, and I really didn't think it was going to enjoy it. After watching the trailer, which didn't impress me, I didn't think it would be any good, but the turning point for me would be when Eric smiles for the first time.Jay Underwood played the part brilliantly and you could almost feel that he enjoyed playing the role of Eric. He was lucky not to have a script with loads of lines to learn! Although he never quite managed to say ""Millie"" (of course not, she gave him the wrong mouth shapes), he managed to poignantly say that he loved Millie, before he flew away, and never returned. I wanted to know what happened to him! Where's the sequel?Lucy Deakins annoyed me throughout the whole film, as I know her from somewhere. She looks so familiar, but I didn't recognise any of the films she'd appeared in listed in the extras. She also reminds me very much of a young Heather Graham, especially on the front cover, and at certain points throughout the film. I don't know whether it's the blue eyes, or the airbrushed clear skin. She just did.Bonnie Bedelia played the mother, and although she doesn't appear very much in the film, I recognised her too. She probably stars in a lot of the TV movies that my mum watches.The one character who made me want to throw something at the TV, was the actress who played Geneva. Talk about annoying! Her voice totally grated. Thankfully, she didn't have a very big starring role, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to watch it.If you're a fan of `Anne Of Green Gables' (I know I am, considering we've just bought all 3 DVDs), look out for Colleen Dewhurst. She played Marilla Cuthbert in `Anne', and plays Mrs Sherman in this film, one of the teachers.Also, if you're a fan of `One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', then look out for a small role, of the psychiatrist who comes to see Millie after her fall from the bridge.

She tries to open him up and she ends up finding a special friendship with in him not only that helps Eric, but helps her own family come closer together. Directed by Nick Castle this movie has an amazing cast: Milly: Lucy Deakins, Eric Gibb: Jay Underwood, Bonnie Bedelia: Charlene Michaelson, Fred Savage (in his first movie): Louis Michaelson, the amazing Colleen Dewhurst: Mrs. Sherman, Fred Gwynne: Uncle Hugo, Mindy Cohn (Facts of Life fame): Geneva ... also interestingly enough you may pick out Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) as a kind nurse, & a very young Jason Priestly.

I myself have a very active dream state and often have dreams where I'm flying in my dreams or where I'm young again.  It's a great escape from the harsh realities of this world and a great gift to have. So if you too, have dreams of flying and wish it would really happen to you, this film is for you!Plot wise, this story is a no brainier. A young girl named Milly, played by Lucy Deakins, moves into a new neighborhood with her mom Charlene, played by Bonnie Bedelia, along with Lewis, her younger brother, played by Fred Savage.  This was Fred Savage's first motion picture film which got his career started, for those of you who loved him in ""The Wonder Years"".The family has lost their father and Charlene, their mother, is working to hold them together.  The mother has to reintegrate back into the world of insurance having been away for 13 years from that type of work, while trying to wrestle with learning computers. Both brother and sister have to integrate into a new neighborhood and new school with its harsh realities.  Lewis's main challenge, throughout the whole film, is to try and get past the bullies living down the street, just to finally get around the block, which he finally manages toward the end of the film. This may seem like no real challenge to you as an adult or if you have forgotten your own childhood, but I remember the bullies I grew up with and when kids are bigger than you, they can scare the bejeebers out of you if you are 7 or 8 years old.I can also equate to the new neighborhood the family moves into, given my own parent's divorce and the number of schools we went through growing up while they fought against each other. It's no fun on the kids when the parents divorce, but in this case, its worse on the kids given they have lost their dad to death before the movie starts. The part were Lewis is out in the rain trying to dig for his army men, not wanting to quit, like he feels his father did, who died of cancer or suicide, started to bring tears to my eyes.  What a great talent Fred Savage had and he was perfect for this movie.Across from them lives a young boy, a savant or autistic kid named Eric, played by Jay Underwood, who has a secret ability he wants no one to know about for fear they might lock him up as a scientific curiosity, which is made clear at the end of the film. The boy does not speak until the end of the film, but is bright minded under his demeanor nevertheless. Jay was pretty cute when he played the role.  Both Lucy and he make for a cute pair on screen.The story is more a light love story between Jay's character, Eric, and Lucy's character, Milly, and I think Nick Castle does a convincing job pulling off the whole thing including the way it ends and why it must end the way it does.Throughout the whole story you are asked the question whether this boy can really fly and don't find out until the very end if he really can.  Fred Gwynne, who plays Eric's uncle an alcoholic, drinks because he thinks he has seen Eric fly, but tops it off to the fact he's getting old and losing his mind. Colleen Duhurst's character greatly adds to the chemistry of this film as Jay's teacher, who protects Jay from the state mental authorities; bringing the whole thing down to earth in their title roles. If some other review tells you how the film ends, I won't. You must see it and I think you will enjoy it if you ever wished as a kid to have the ability to fly.This is a great film for the whole family. No violence or anyone killed.  Just a beautiful story and a chance to escape the world as you watch it. It was films like this that made the golden years of the motion picture business, before the whole world went insane with all its violence on the big screen.Also listen to the commentary audio with the film.

Villines ""WJ Villines""","[1, 1]","It seems the most recent review was from back in 2003, So I thought I would chime in here.First, This Fred Savage was prior to Wonder Years.Then There is Mindy Cohn from before Facts of Life andFred Gwynne from the Muster's Herman fameof course there must be recognition for Colleen Dewhurst.Fred Savage was a good actor as a kid... and since he was a kid in this film, the acting skill definately shines through... and working with child actors usually leaves a pasty feel the way the first two movies in the Harry Potter did with the Wonder Triplets.There was the touch of magic to make the movie themes less intense as they could otherwise be, however the story itself is very well worked out so that everything in the final production produces a fantastic tail of rediscovery after tragic losses.If you ever stop to watch something you might just pass by, this movie will NOT leave you feeling cheated. It is well worth the watch, and at Amazon price of $7 for the unlimited stream, well worth the price. I may even opt to get a hard copy dvd or Blue Ray for my home library... we shall see though.By the way -- this is a fairly family friendly movie, but does contain some ""bullying"" sequences and some child-sensitive (for the early 80s) ideas, ""this isn't water in the sqirtgun, it's piss."" ... of course this would not even be offensive by the standards of 2013.But it still works.You know what, just watch the movie and you will know why modern movies just dont match the older stuff for quality.",5,Fantastic and Fantastical.,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1505,"['most', 'recent', 'review', 'was', 'back', '2003', 'thought', 'would', 'chime', 'here.First', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'was', 'prior', 'Wonder', 'Years.Then', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'Facts', 'Life', 'andFred', 'Gwynne', 'Muster', 'Herman', 'course', 'must', 'be', 'recognition', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst.Fred', 'Savage', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'kid', 'was', 'kid', 'film', 'acting', 'skill', 'definately', 'working', 'child', 'actors', 'usually', 'pasty', 'feel', 'way', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'did', 'Wonder', 'Triplets.There', 'was', 'touch', 'magic', 'make', 'movie', 'less', 'intense', 'could', 'otherwise', 'be', 'however', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'worked', 'out', 'everything', 'final', 'production', 'fantastic', 'tail', 'rediscovery', 'tragic', 'losses.If', 'ever', 'stop', 'watch', 'something', 'might', 'just', 'pass', 'movie', 'will', 'NOT', 'leave', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'Amazon', 'price', '7', 'unlimited', 'stream', 'well', 'price', 'may', 'even', 'opt', 'get', 'hard', 'copy', 'dvd', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'home', 'library', 'shall', 'see', 'way', 'fairly', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'contain', 'bullying', 'sequences', 'child-sensitive', 'early', '80s', 'ideas', ""n't"", 'water', 'sqirtgun', 'piss', 'course', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'offensive', 'standards', '2013.But', 'still', 'know', 'what', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'know', 'why', 'modern', 'movies', 'just', 'dont', 'match', 'older', 'stuff', 'quality']",N/A
