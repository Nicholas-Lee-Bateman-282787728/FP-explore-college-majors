You'd better deliver the goods or horror fans will do little more than ridicule the name over and over again, citing the title in their jokes and slams. If you can deliver the goods, then you make a movie that fans can enjoy. DAMNED BY DAWN is just such a movie.A slow start finds a young couple going to the home of Claire to visit her grandmother perhaps for the last time. Her boyfriend Paul finds the family a bit off kilter but not enough to make him run for the hills. When Claire sits at her grandmother's side to talk about the mysterious package (an urn) her grandmother sent her, she's told she is the only one her grandmother trusts with its care. She knows her time is coming and wants her grand daughter at her side to insure nothing prevents what is to happen.That night the inevitable does happen and grandma dies. At the same time a storm whips up outside and Claire looks out the window to see something unexpected, a visage in white flowing gown, eyes bleeding and packing a scream that sends her reeling while opening the window. The banshee is here to take grandma's soul. But Claire unknowingly interferes and puts not just her grandmother's soul in jeopardy but the lives of everyone inside as well.The dead rise and take wing, tracking down everyone in the house as they try to figure out what has happened. When Paul goes for help, he's attacked by a scythe wielding creature that flies at him. His body is later discovered by Claire's father and a neighbor who was visiting. As those who survive in the house are taken out one by one, Claire must figure out just how to put a stop to the banshee before everyone dies.A rather simple story, the movie opens at a dreadfully slow pace but don't let that prevent you from watching as it gets better. The usual mind set needed for a horror film, suspension of belief, needs to kick in to truly enjoy the film but it does offer some truly creepy images and sounds. The cry of the banshee, a mind piercing scream, is one that jolts you while watching the film. Coupled with the images of the banshee it might be something that will cause a few sleepless nights for those who scare easily.The movie is not Oscar worthy but it does offer a decent horror tale with a new twist on an old legend. The acting is up to par and the effects are well done. Some are obviously CGI effects but at least they do a good job with them here unlike the weekly dose of sharks or pythons dished up by the SyFy network. If you're looking for a decent horror movie you could do worse but at least this one has some heart, talent and desire to be considered a well done piece. It succeeds on several levels and is worth watching.",3,MORE CHILLS THAN EXPECTED,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,2809,"['When', 'choose', 'have', 'title', 'horror', 'film', 'words', 'feature', 'expectations', 'viewer', 'increase', ""'d"", 'better', 'deliver', 'goods', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'ridicule', 'name', 'over', 'again', 'citing', 'title', 'jokes', 'slams', 'can', 'deliver', 'goods', 'then', 'make', 'movie', 'fans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'DAMNED', 'BY', 'DAWN', 'just', 'such', 'movie.A', 'slow', 'start', 'young', 'couple', 'going', 'home', 'Claire', 'visit', 'grandmother', 'perhaps', 'last', 'time', 'boyfriend', 'Paul', 'family', 'bit', 'off', 'kilter', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'run', 'hills', 'When', 'Claire', 'grandmother', 'side', 'talk', 'mysterious', 'package', 'urn', 'grandmother', 'sent', 'told', 'only', 'one', 'grandmother', 'trusts', 'care', 'time', 'coming', 'grand', 'daughter', 'side', 'insure', 'nothing', 'prevents', 'what', 'happen.That', 'night', 'inevitable', 'happen', 'grandma', 'dies', 'same', 'time', 'storm', 'up', 'outside', 'Claire', 'out', 'window', 'see', 'something', 'unexpected', 'visage', 'white', 'flowing', 'gown', 'eyes', 'bleeding', 'packing', 'scream', 'reeling', 'opening', 'window', 'banshee', 'here', 'take', 'grandma', 'soul', 'Claire', 'unknowingly', 'not', 'just', 'grandmother', 'soul', 'jeopardy', 'lives', 'everyone', 'well.The', 'dead', 'rise', 'take', 'wing', 'tracking', 'down', 'everyone', 'house', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'When', 'Paul', 'help', 'attacked', 'scythe', 'wielding', 'creature', 'body', 'later', 'discovered', 'Claire', 'father', 'neighbor', 'who', 'was', 'visiting', 'who', 'survive', 'house', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'Claire', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'put', 'stop', 'banshee', 'everyone', 'dies.A', 'rather', 'simple', 'story', 'movie', 'dreadfully', 'slow', 'pace', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'prevent', 'watching', 'better', 'usual', 'mind', 'set', 'needed', 'horror', 'film', 'suspension', 'belief', 'kick', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'offer', 'truly', 'creepy', 'images', 'sounds', 'cry', 'banshee', 'mind', 'piercing', 'scream', 'one', 'jolts', 'watching', 'film', 'Coupled', 'images', 'banshee', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'cause', 'few', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'who', 'scare', 'easily.The', 'movie', 'not', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'offer', 'decent', 'horror', 'tale', 'new', 'twist', 'old', 'legend', 'acting', 'up', 'par', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'obviously', 'CGI', 'effects', 'least', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'weekly', 'dose', 'sharks', 'pythons', 'dished', 'up', 'SyFy', 'network', ""'re"", 'looking', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'least', 'one', 'heart', 'talent', 'desire', 'be', 'considered', 'well', 'done', 'piece', 'several', 'levels', 'worth', 'watching']",Damned by Dawn

1378882,A3559I6Q7RCPP3,B00404ME1U,"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll""","[9, 11]","This title is not to be confused with the famous and far superior Evil Dead moniker, ""dead by dawn"".  The first 50 minutes of the film go by pretty well.  The legend of the banshee seems to be used quite effectively.  The sets every now and then almost come across as fairy tale-like, especially the scenes in the mine.  That's the first 50 minutes.  After this, things quickly go to hell as folklore gets substituted by clich&eacute; and everything stops making sense.  As for the raison d'etre of the film, the dead, you have to have a certain love for flying, scythe wielding skeletons to get your full boo's worth, or boo crap, if you don't lean towards this kind of dead.  The acting was pedestrian to competent, nothing to light the sky on fire or anything.  For me, there were some continuity discrepancies; unless I wasn't paying attention, I could swear that I saw a father and son running from a mine at night, and then the father being let into the house in obvious daylight.  The story itself could have been better.  The banshee was awesome, probably the best one ever put on screen.  Just you go try and figure out the last 10 minutes of the film, though!

1378883,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B00404ME1U,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[3, 4]","Damned by Dawn is a 2010 independent horror film directed by Brett Anstey and tells the story, I think, of a banshee who is trying to damn a family.  I think.  The details got lost in all of the fog being blown around for the last hour and a half.To be fair, the movie actually started off fairly well.  If you're an Evil Dead fan, you'll recognize immediately a similar film style utilized here, but only at an environmental angle.  The moving ground shots through hazy nighttime forest, etc.  It's a nod in the right direction, so I feel I owe Anstey some recognition for that.  He also did a decent job of spooking me.  Every so often a form will move silently through the background and it's startling.  Well, the first ten times it was, I should say.  He must have known it was working because he kept doing it and doing it and doing it, and......THIS is where I start stomping on his effort.The film went nowhere.  It gained a little momentum in the beginning, but quickly began bleating one note and stayed that way through its entirety.  Keeping my hand away from the fast-forward button on my remote because I promised myself I'd not review the movie unless I'd seen the whole thing was exhausting.The banshee got on my nerves right away.  The screaming was obnoxious.  I know that's what banshees DO, but it drove me nuts.The main actress wasn't very good.  At all.  She basically spends the whole movie going from panicky to wide-eyed and back to panicky, rinse and repeat.  At one point in the movie, she's on a balcony looking down and her eyes are huge.  Cut to a different scene, then back to the balcony and she's looking down again with an almost identical face.  She just kept doing that.Weakest zombies ever.  One undead guy walks into the house, gets their attention, dumps his guts on the floor, then starts flaccidly punching at them.  When he connects, they act as if they've been hit by a Thor's hammer, but there's no way.  NO way.  If anything, this movie gave me hope that when zombies finally do start perusing my populace, they'll be walking daffodils like the creatures in this little ditty.The music was sporadic and poorly placed.  Multiple genres fluttered around carelessly until the end scene when one of the worst songs I've heard brings the whole house crashing down around me.I don't know what else to say.  I wanted to like the movie, but I just could not.  At one point I even tried to get excited about a tear in the father's cheek because it reminded me of similar wound handed to Lionel's mother in Dead Alive, but then I realized that while watching one movie, I was fantasizing about another, and that's a disappointing thing to happen to a guy.Unless you're the type of person that's trying to watch every movie with, ""Dawn"" in it, I'd avoid this film, and I'd avoid this film really hard.- t -",2,Fox traps pop open on their own eventually.,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2840,"['Damned', 'Dawn', '2010', 'independent', 'horror', 'film', 'directed', 'Brett', 'Anstey', 'story', 'think', 'banshee', 'who', 'trying', 'damn', 'family', 'think', 'details', 'got', 'lost', 'fog', 'being', 'blown', 'last', 'hour', 'half.To', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'actually', 'started', 'off', 'fairly', 'well', ""'re"", 'Evil', 'Dead', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'immediately', 'similar', 'film', 'style', 'utilized', 'here', 'only', 'environmental', 'angle', 'moving', 'ground', 'shots', 'hazy', 'nighttime', 'forest', 'etc', 'nod', 'right', 'direction', 'feel', 'owe', 'Anstey', 'recognition', 'also', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'spooking', 'so', 'often', 'form', 'will', 'move', 'silently', 'background', 'startling', 'Well', 'first', 'ten', 'times', 'was', 'should', 'say', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'working', 'kept', 'doing', 'doing', 'doing', 'THIS', 'where', 'start', 'stomping', 'effort.The', 'film', 'went', 'nowhere', 'gained', 'little', 'momentum', 'beginning', 'quickly', 'began', 'bleating', 'one', 'note', 'stayed', 'way', 'entirety', 'Keeping', 'hand', 'away', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'remote', 'promised', ""'d"", 'not', 'review', 'movie', ""'d"", 'seen', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'exhausting.The', 'banshee', 'got', 'nerves', 'right', 'away', 'screaming', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'know', 'what', 'DO', 'drove', 'nuts.The', 'main', 'actress', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'basically', 'whole', 'movie', 'going', 'panicky', 'wide-eyed', 'back', 'panicky', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'balcony', 'looking', 'down', 'eyes', 'are', 'huge', 'Cut', 'different', 'scene', 'then', 'back', 'balcony', 'looking', 'down', 'again', 'almost', 'identical', 'face', 'just', 'kept', 'doing', 'that.Weakest', 'zombies', 'ever', 'One', 'undead', 'guy', 'walks', 'house', 'attention', 'dumps', 'guts', 'floor', 'then', 'flaccidly', 'punching', 'When', 'act', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hit', 'Thor', 'hammer', 'way', 'way', 'anything', 'movie', 'gave', 'hope', 'when', 'zombies', 'finally', 'do', 'start', 'perusing', 'populace', ""'ll"", 'be', 'walking', 'daffodils', 'creatures', 'little', 'ditty.The', 'music', 'was', 'sporadic', 'poorly', 'placed', 'Multiple', 'genres', 'fluttered', 'carelessly', 'end', 'scene', 'when', 'one', 'worst', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'whole', 'house', 'crashing', 'down', 'around', 'me.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'wanted', 'movie', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'tried', 'get', 'excited', 'tear', 'father', 'cheek', 'reminded', 'similar', 'wound', 'handed', 'Lionel', 'mother', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'then', 'realized', 'watching', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'fantasizing', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'happen', 'guy.Unless', ""'re"", 'type', 'person', 'trying', 'watch', 'movie', 'Dawn', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'film', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'film', 'really', 'hard.-', 't']",Damned by Dawn
