Shirley Booth looks tired and seems to lack the energy of the earlier seasons but she's still &#34;Hazel&#34;, who knows everything about everything.  Ray Fulmer and Lynn Borden as Steve and Barbara Baxter are a cute couple and endearing and their little girl, Suzie, played by Julia Benjamin is a doll.  Bobby Buntrock is growing up and its kind of eerie watching this last season knowing that in six years, he would meet a tragic death in a car accident.  He would have been a great man.  Anyhow, the episodes are pure delight and just as good as the earlier seasons.  This season has a bad reputation because of George and Dorothy (Don DeFore and Whitney Blake) being written out of the series.  It is not a fair assessment.

Little Harold and Hazel have moved in with them while George and Dorothy (&#34;Missy&#34;) are in the middle east for 2 months.  It's strange to me to see Harold without his parents.  Other than that, Hazel is still the unstoppable, lovable Hazel.  Even though it IS so different from the other seasons, it's still worth buying because it's a good, classic family tv show in color.

1672121,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B00FM4S8IU,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[9, 9]","TV's beloved version of Ted Key's newspaper gag cartoon, Hazel was one of those cozy shows that was just there for comfort, like a carton of ice cream or mom's leftover soup. It wasn't groundbreaking or earth-shaking, but is was better than it gets credit for, largely due to its gifted star, Shirley Booth.Booth was an unlikely movie and Broadway superstar, winner of Oscars and Emmys (for Hazel) and the narrator of one of the all-time most loved Rankin/Bass holiday specials, The Year Without a Santa Claus. Short and plump with a voice like Betty Boop's, Booth was ideal in the lead role of her series. She reveled in its nuances (yes, Hazel had nuances).For the first four years of the series, which was also a long-running hit in syndication, Hazel was the live-in maid to the affluent Baxter family. The dad was played by Don DeFore (who also starred in the wonderful Christmas B-movie It Happened on Fifth Avenue and also an owner of one of Disneyland's first restaurants). Mom was played by lovely Whitney Blake (mother of actress Meredith Baxter and co-creator of One Day at a Time). Bobby Buntrock played little Harold with the skill to tear your heart out when he cries about losing his dog or some such--the hallmark of a great child actor.Season Five was bizarre-O because suddenly mom and dad moved to Saudi Arabia because dad had a business deal...? Harold was left behind to continue in school, to be cared for by dad's younger brother and his young wife. They also had a daughter, giving the lad someone with which to get into wacky adventures.Hazel was still there for Harold (which seemed to suit him fine, since he always seemed most partial to her). She moved in to a somewhat fancier house with young Steve and Barbara. If you think this sounds convoluted, watch the first episode of season five and set your timer for how long it takes it all to be explained!Anyway, Steve is sort of like a pre-perm Mike Brady, if he fell asleep at his drafting table and his face stayed pushed in. Barbara (Lynn Borden) is like Samantha's little sister with a sing-song voice but without magic powers. Adorable Susie is adorable (visit stusshow.com to download an exclusive interview with grown up Julia Benjamin, who played Susie). Also appearing regularly was Ann Jillian as Steve's teen secretary.Hazel lost none of her crusty-but-benign common-sense nor her fresh-baked gumption. She was constantly butting into people's business and coming up with wacky schemes to help others or herself, always in a loving and sensible way. She was the mom we never had -- or the mom we did have minus all the baggage.There are some great episodes in season five, including one in which she mistakes a great painter for the house painter; Hazel tries to overhaul a roadster; Hazel markets her homemade chili (a surefire sitcom staple); Steve tries to win a perfect boss contest; and my favorite of the season, in which the adults aim to get the boys to give up that surely-to-go-away ""rock and roll fad"" by dressing and acting like hippies and groovers (it's always fun to see how '60s sitcoms treated the youth movement).By the time that episode was made, Ray Fulmer, who at first had lacked the charm and warmth of Don DeFore, had become more comfortable and loose in his role as Steve. The chemistry between Steve and Hazel was different; Hazel couldn't chide this thinner, younger man about his weight or his age. Film veteran DeFore never lost his charm, even when he was furious. Stage actor Fulmer, who later derided the Hazel show's writing, became a soap actor, for which his dour demeanor was better suited.Steve and Barbara are like a sitcom version of Don and Betty Draper, a couple that looks like the top of a wedding cake, trying to ascend the ladder of what was defined as success in the Wonder Bread world of early sitcom suburbia.The later shows in Season Five of Hazel are the strongest. The cast begins to connect and storylines are less about real estate and more about the people in and around the Baxter home, particularly sister-in-law Deirdre, a social shark played masterfully by TV and radio veteran Cathy Lewis (the original Jane on My Friend Irma). She's the perfect Margaret Dumont to Hazel's Groucho. Once familiar faces return, the season swings into gear.There would have been a sixth season, since the series was still getting great ratings (this year it had moved to CBS's strong Monday night lineup), but Booth's ill health prevented it. Too bad, the world always needs its Hazels -- especially in the late '60s.How would Hazel Burke have dealt with protestors? She'd probably pick up a sign, march with them, totally embarrass Mr. Steve, enrage Mr. Steve's stuffy business associates, then whip up some hot, juicy roast beef sandwiches and home-fried donuts (all the while claiming that ""they ain't up to my usual"") -- which would soften everyone's heart so much that all the troubles would go away.Until next week.",4,Hazel's BIZARRO

My favorite episode of the final season is &#34;My Son the Sheepdog&#34;. I'm glad Shout Factory picked up the rights to release these last four seasons after Sony left us hanging after releasing only season one. Once again though, we are left with episodes which are not digitally remastered. Perhaps the original negatives are lost or simply not available, who knows. While most of the episodes look pretty good there are a few episodes which to my eyes appeared to be somewhat dark. I can overlook that. At least now I can watch any episode of Hazel that I want to see. One other thing I noticed...the final season featured two opening title sequences. The only one presented on this release is the more rare opening with the family talking on the phone, not the opening where Hazel offers an umbrella to the family as they leave the house. Oh well. Despite the few flaws I've mentioned I'm happy to have the entire Hazel collection.

1672130,A3W3OG4JJKFFTV,B00FM4S8IU,RetroRhythms,"[15, 15]","After enjoying the first four seasons of 'Hazel' starring the original 'Baxters' (Don Defore and Whitney Blake) alongside Shirley Booth, I was prepared to be disappointed by the revamped lineup of the sitcom's final season. Instead, I found the change to be a refreshing one which gave the show an inherently lighter tone. Not that the previous seasons were dark or anything--but the component of George's confrontational tone with Hazel had gradually become more of a focal point, which I think took something away from the feel-good quality for which 'Hazel' is most prevalently known. With the arrival of Lynn Borden and Ray Fulmer as the new 'Baxter' family for which Shirley Booth plays the maid, there is a less volatile feel--not to mention a slightly more believable component to the character portrayals.No doubt about it, Defore and Blake were both fine actors. But Borden and Fulmer seemed to portray more everyday personality traits which lent themselves well to the fun, often zany, story lines. There are 29 episodes in total. Some focus on Hazel's tendency to stir up trouble inadvertently; others zoom in on various aspects of Steve Baxter's work as a real estate agent; and one even places the spotlight on Harold (the late Bobby Buntrock, who remained from the original cast) and his friends as they start a kids' rock band of sorts.There are other familiar faces from earlier seasons of ""Hazel"" here, too: Cathy Lewis (playing George's sister, Deirdre) and Maudie Prickett (as Hazel's fellow maid and friend, Rosie). Through it all, Shirley Booth maintains her remarkably believable acting style which truly makes you forget she's acting. I read an interview with Ray Fulmer from not long after the series was canceled stating that he found the show's writing to be very shoddy, but Booth's abilities to be nothing short of miraculous. I do agree that some of the episodes suffer from loopholes in the plots (and on occasion, abrupt endings). But between the chemistry of the actors, the interesting guest players, Booth's one-of-a-kind talent, and even the background music in the shows, those shortcomings are easy to overlook.I won't hesitate to recommend this final season of ""Hazel"" to anyone who relishes in the joys of a simpler time in TV during which one could feel like they were getting an inside view of a good-natured, upbeat family which seems to solve problems with humor and persistence.",5,Surprisingly Satisfying!,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2422,"['enjoying', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', ""'Hazel"", 'starring', 'original', ""'Baxters"", 'Don', 'Defore', 'Whitney', 'Blake', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'was', 'prepared', 'be', 'disappointed', 'revamped', 'lineup', 'sitcom', 'final', 'season', 'Instead', 'found', 'change', 'be', 'refreshing', 'one', 'gave', 'show', 'inherently', 'lighter', 'tone', 'Not', 'previous', 'seasons', 'were', 'dark', 'anything', 'component', 'George', 'confrontational', 'tone', 'Hazel', 'had', 'gradually', 'become', 'more', 'focal', 'point', 'think', 'took', 'something', 'away', 'feel-good', 'quality', ""'Hazel"", 'most', 'prevalently', 'known', 'arrival', 'Lynn', 'Borden', 'Ray', 'Fulmer', 'new', ""'Baxter"", 'family', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'maid', 'less', 'volatile', 'feel', 'not', 'mention', 'slightly', 'more', 'believable', 'component', 'character', 'portrayals.No', 'doubt', 'Defore', 'Blake', 'were', 'fine', 'actors', 'Borden', 'Fulmer', 'seemed', 'portray', 'more', 'everyday', 'personality', 'traits', 'lent', 'well', 'fun', 'often', 'zany', 'story', 'lines', 'are', '29', 'episodes', 'total', 'focus', 'Hazel', 'tendency', 'stir', 'up', 'trouble', 'inadvertently', 'others', 'zoom', 'various', 'aspects', 'Steve', 'Baxter', 'work', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'one', 'even', 'spotlight', 'Harold', 'late', 'Bobby', 'Buntrock', 'who', 'remained', 'original', 'cast', 'friends', 'start', 'kids', 'rock', 'band', 'sorts.There', 'are', 'other', 'familiar', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Hazel', 'here', 'too', 'Cathy', 'Lewis', 'playing', 'George', 'sister', 'Deirdre', 'Maudie', 'Prickett', 'Hazel', 'fellow', 'maid', 'friend', 'Rosie', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'remarkably', 'believable', 'acting', 'style', 'truly', 'forget', 'acting', 'read', 'interview', 'Ray', 'Fulmer', 'not', 'long', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'stating', 'found', 'show', 'writing', 'be', 'very', 'shoddy', 'Booth', 'abilities', 'be', 'nothing', 'short', 'miraculous', 'do', 'agree', 'episodes', 'suffer', 'loopholes', 'plots', 'occasion', 'abrupt', 'endings', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'interesting', 'guest', 'players', 'Booth', 'one-of-a-kind', 'talent', 'even', 'background', 'music', 'shows', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'easy', 'overlook.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'final', 'season', 'Hazel', 'anyone', 'who', 'joys', 'simpler', 'time', 'TV', 'one', 'could', 'feel', 'were', 'getting', 'inside', 'view', 'good-natured', 'upbeat', 'family', 'solve', 'problems', 'humor', 'persistence']",Hazel: The Final Season

The only two regular cast members who returned were Shirley Booth (Hazel) and Bobby Buntrock (Harold). News reports at the time stated that when ABC canceled the series Whitney Blake went onto other projects, and so was unavailable to return to the role as Dorothy &#34;Missy&#34; Baxter, when CBS later assumed the show. Therefore she and both her TV husband Don DeFore (George Baxter, Esq.) were passed-over for the fifth (and consequently) the final season. It had been later revealed that Blake and DeFore were deemed too old, as demographics were now being heralded to measure audience ratings/ revenue. This season Hazel and Harold move in with George Baxter's younger brother Steve (Ray Fulmer), his wife and daughter Susie. George and Dorothy Baxter are in the Middle-East due to business obligations. This brings a fresh overhaul with Steve Baxter's real estate business as a new challenge for the meddling maid. Also returning on occasion is George and Steve's haughty sister, who finds Hazel a constant irritant. Veteran actress Ann Jillian started her TV career here as Steve Baxter's youthful secretary.

He's one of the biggest Hazel fans around and could easily pass as Hazel Burke's nephew.  He's just like her in real life.  I hadn't seen the show since reruns last aired in 1975 on local television.  I so enjoyed watching the show again after thirty-one years, that together we waited, and waited, for subsequent seasons to be released on DVD, celebrating each season's announcement.  Today we both fainted in delight over the news that Shout Factory will be releasing the fifth and final season of this classic sitcom on 1-14-14, which will complete the series on DVD.Since rediscovering ""Hazel"" I have done some recruiting of my own, getting several others hooked on the show.  The storylines are good, Hazel means well, Harold is a cute kid, the Baxters are decent, and I don't have to worry about being offended by some idiot one line jokes like today's television.  I can seek comfort watching Hazel taking care of her family, while getting into some sticky situations.Thank you, Shout Factory, for giving us the final season of ""Hazel.""",5,Yay!
