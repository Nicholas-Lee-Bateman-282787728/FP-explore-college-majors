Alot of them went straight to video and are barely remembered, some went to theaters but never did much. I remember seeing this movie preview when I was younger and it freaked me out, and I finally bought it on dvd. I previewed the trailer again after buying it and thought ""ut oh, i bought a crapfest."" They do have T2 star Edward Furlong, which I guess at thus time was still considered a star. I thought the downfall of the movie was the Trickster, who was enjoyable but didnt really flesh out to be a villian and the cop he run into alot, should have had a slightly bigger part. Furlong is perfect in his role as a bored teen who loves metal, video games, and horror films. The downfall is the rest of the cast falls flat. A few good scenes are scattered about but nothing exciting. The ending started off as crap but the real ending was enjoyable but I guess.

""Brainscan"" is an incredibly fun, psychological nightmare that stars Edward Furlong (who also starred in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" in 1991) as troubled teen Michael Bower who lost his mother as a child and seldom ever gets to see his father who is always away on business trips. He finds refuge with close friend, Kyle (James Marsh) and his collection of violent low-budget horror movies, while having a crush on the sexy girl next door, Kim (Amy Hargreaves).After reading an add for the all-new virtual reality game (the title name of the movie itself) in an issue of Fangoria magazine, Michael receives a trial version in the mail and decides to try it out, considering that it is claimed to be the ultimate experience in terror! The gameplay is simple: Michael must find and kill someone within a certain time limit, or it's Game Over! But soon, Brainscan turns out to be more than just a game when Michael discovers that people die for REAL!The police arrive to the scene of the crime and Michael must clear his name off the list of suspects with the help of the mischievous Trickster (a creepy and campy performance by T. Ryder Smith) However, to do this he must continue playing all four parts of the game. The only problem is that now the whole neighborhood is on the search for the serial killer and Michael will have to remain anonymous, while destroying all pieces of evidence before the clock runs out! A(n) original plot and script, great acting, and awesome special effects make up this 1994 low-budget blockbuster hit! Take my word for it, there normally isn't that many good modern horror flicks, but this is one of the very few that actually ARE!

365356,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303236723,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[21, 23]","Oh, man, I love this movie.  It's not perfect, but it takes such a fresh and juicy approach to horror that I can only wonder why more horror fans haven't feasted of the virtual flesh that is Brainscan.  Sure, the climax of the film is predictable, and the plot requires the mega-indulgence of your imagination, and the final, final twist is something of a letdown (of little importance), but this film has pizzazz and originality, a heavy rocking soundtrack, and a genuine element of creepiness that flowed through my veins like liquid nirvana.Edward Furlong of T2 fame plays Michael Bower, a rather solitary computer nerd of a teenager who lives in a world of horror films, computer games, and rock music; like many a horror fanatic, he is always on the lookout for the ultimate horror experience (although, as typically happens, he's afraid to make a move on the girl next door whom he secretly pines for).  He sounds a lot like me, actually, but this kid has an awesome computer system (especially for 1994) which includes a virtual assistant named Igor.  When his best (and only) bud tells him about this new interactive game called Brainscan (dude, it's advertised in Fangoria), he calls up the number and soon finds himself engaged in an experience he was not prepared for.  The first disk promises him a realistic experience of killing from the viewpoint of the killer himself.  Don't get hung up on the details because he basically just sits there and the game sends out some kind of special hypnotic waves toward his brain or something.  Anyway, he's pretty stoked about the experience until he learns that a local man was actually murdered in an identical fashion - it was supposed to be just a computer game.  Naturally, he starts to freak out a little bit, but the friendly Brainscan mastermind is there to help him.  Trickster (T. Ryder Smith) even keeps popping into his room in some kind of magically electronic fashion to guide (more like compel, actually) him through the other three game disks - he has to take care of witnesses, you see.  Meanwhile, the law is circling in on him, he doesn't know what's real and what's not, and he's basically forced to keep playing the game.  We all know who the last victim will be, of course, but we have to wait and see whether he can go through with the final kill.  The ultimate conclusion comes as no surprise because there is really only one way to end a film such as this, but it was pulled off fairly well, throwing in a couple of elements that seemed a little left of center.This was not some high-budget theatrical production, and that's fine - in fact, more money would probably have ruined this film.  The acting isn't the best in the world, although Furlong improves as he goes along, Amy Hargreaves has that cute girl next door thing working to perfection, and T. Ryder Smith is an absolute joy to watch in the role of Trickster.  Some mysteries are left a little murky, such as those about a trauma in Michael's past, and much of the secrets of the game play itself are basically just ignored, but there's no need to overanalyze this gloriously over-the-top film.  I was a little annoyed at first by the darkness of the film print, but I soon concluded that this was a good thing; Brainscan really should be watched in the dark.  Just sit back, give yourself over completely to the film, and reap the rewards of this ingeniously different kind of horror/science fiction/suspense classic.Finally, I have to throw out some kudos to the makers of this film for including Zak the dog in the credits; Zak had a significant albeit supporting role in the film, but this canine earned his money and certainly deserved credit for his work.",5,One of my all-time favorite cult horror/sci-fi films,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,3700,"['Oh', 'man', 'love', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'fresh', 'juicy', 'approach', 'horror', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'why', 'more', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'feasted', 'virtual', 'flesh', 'Brainscan', 'Sure', 'climax', 'film', 'predictable', 'plot', 'mega-indulgence', 'imagination', 'final', 'final', 'twist', 'something', 'letdown', 'little', 'importance', 'film', 'pizzazz', 'originality', 'heavy', 'rocking', 'soundtrack', 'genuine', 'element', 'creepiness', 'flowed', 'veins', 'liquid', 'nirvana.Edward', 'Furlong', 'T2', 'fame', 'Michael', 'Bower', 'rather', 'solitary', 'computer', 'nerd', 'teenager', 'who', 'world', 'horror', 'films', 'computer', 'games', 'rock', 'music', 'many', 'horror', 'fanatic', 'always', 'lookout', 'ultimate', 'horror', 'experience', 'typically', 'afraid', 'make', 'move', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'whom', 'secretly', 'lot', 'actually', 'kid', 'awesome', 'computer', 'system', 'especially', '1994', 'virtual', 'assistant', 'named', 'Igor', 'When', 'best', 'only', 'bud', 'new', 'interactive', 'game', 'called', 'Brainscan', 'dude', 'advertised', 'Fangoria', 'up', 'number', 'soon', 'engaged', 'experience', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'first', 'disk', 'realistic', 'experience', 'killing', 'viewpoint', 'killer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'details', 'basically', 'just', 'sits', 'there', 'game', 'out', 'kind', 'special', 'hypnotic', 'waves', 'brain', 'something', 'Anyway', 'pretty', 'stoked', 'experience', 'local', 'man', 'was', 'actually', 'murdered', 'identical', 'fashion', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'just', 'computer', 'game', 'Naturally', 'freak', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'friendly', 'Brainscan', 'mastermind', 'there', 'help', 'Trickster', 'T.', 'Ryder', 'Smith', 'even', 'popping', 'room', 'kind', 'magically', 'electronic', 'fashion', 'guide', 'more', 'compel', 'actually', 'other', 'three', 'game', 'disks', 'take', 'care', 'witnesses', 'see', 'Meanwhile', 'law', 'circling', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'basically', 'forced', 'keep', 'playing', 'game', 'know', 'who', 'last', 'victim', 'will', 'be', 'course', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'can', 'go', 'final', 'kill', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'surprise', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'such', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'fairly', 'well', 'throwing', 'couple', 'elements', 'seemed', 'little', 'left', 'center.This', 'was', 'not', 'high-budget', 'theatrical', 'production', 'fine', 'fact', 'more', 'money', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'ruined', 'film', 'acting', ""n't"", 'best', 'world', 'Furlong', 'along', 'Amy', 'Hargreaves', 'cute', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'thing', 'working', 'perfection', 'T.', 'Ryder', 'Smith', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch', 'role', 'Trickster', 'mysteries', 'are', 'left', 'little', 'murky', 'such', 'trauma', 'Michael', 'past', 'much', 'secrets', 'game', 'play', 'are', 'basically', 'just', 'ignored', 'need', 'overanalyze', 'gloriously', 'over-the-top', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'annoyed', 'first', 'darkness', 'film', 'print', 'soon', 'concluded', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'Brainscan', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'dark', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'give', 'over', 'completely', 'film', 'reap', 'rewards', 'ingeniously', 'different', 'kind', 'horror/science', 'fiction/suspense', 'classic.Finally', 'have', 'throw', 'out', 'kudos', 'makers', 'film', 'including', 'Zak', 'dog', 'credits', 'Zak', 'had', 'significant', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'canine', 'earned', 'money', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'credit', 'work']",Brainscan VHS

It just makes such a big deal out of CD-ROM technology. I guess the only game out back then was Myst.Michael Brower (Furlong) is a lonely kid. His mother is dead and his dad is often away on long business trips leaving him alone in his attic bedroom with his massive computer station big enough to be the Skynet system core (one presumes his dad is computer salesman or something). Horror movies are his obsession and spying on his would-be girlfriend next door breaks up the day. For him, life is easier when seen through a TV rather than dealing with it up front.His attention is drawn to an ad in Fangoria, a video game called Brainscan which promises the ultimate high in interactive gaming. It's a horror game that is so real it'll chill your blood etc etc. Michael is sceptical but goes along with it anyway. He dials the number and gets his (apparently free) Brainscan disc.The object of the game is to kill and that's exactly what Michael does. He's sent into a state of deep hypnosis through the TV and wakes up on his ultimate killing high. So THIS is what it feels like to be Jason Voorhees!Trouble is it appears that Michael really is killing people and when he tries to shut the game down wonderfully mad character called The Trickster pops out of the TV and involves himself in conversations regarding the nature of horror that become a bit too philosophical.Brainscan ends with a plot twist that is quite ingenius and caught me totally off-guard the first time I saw it. However, a couple of plot points that occur after this make no sense and throw the whole logic of the plot into confusion. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker (the very man who gave us Se7en and 8mm) you can expect there to be a certain tightness to the structure of the film but it seems to be to small and restricted for it's own good. If more opportunities created by the bizarre story were explored and fleshed out it could have been a great film instead of only being a good one.The Brainscan DVD is in average looking 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with average Dolby 2.0 sound. The region 1 disc is really the only way to go as the Region 2 is in crappy fullscreen. Neither have any features.

It will also change the way many people who watch it look at the world.It delivers in every facet of movie making.  Each of the main characters owns his role so thoroughly that the viewer can't imagine anyone else doing it.  The cinematography is lush, the sound is riveting, and the pacing is so tense it's almost painful.It is everything good that this sort of surrealist phantasy usually isn't.  It is mind-blowingly weird, yet each step of the plot follows step like an equation.  No character is a one-dimensional cartoon.  Frank Langella manages to be ominous and sympathetic.

365363,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6303236723,JRP,"[0, 0]","Hello out there & welcome to this, this is going to be the last 20 years ago 2004 in film for the month of April this is a review for Brainscan. Now this movie holds a cult status although it does have a 6.0 on imdb. I saw bits & pieces of this movie back around 99 or 2000 this was my chance to sit down & watch the full movie & it is a good movie. Directed by John Flynn he directed Lock Up & Out For Justice & he passed away back in 07. While I can't find the budget information I bet it wasn't a hit it only made $1 million opening weekend & $4 million it's full US run. The movie stars Edward Furlong as Michael Brower, T Ryder Smith as Trickster, Frank Langella as Detective Hayden, Jamie Marsh as Kyle & Amy Hargraves as Kimberly. The story is about this 16 year old named Michael he's into horror films & you find out in the beginning of the movie he had a horrific event when he was a kid that involved the death of his Mother. He & his Friend Kevin get caught showing a horror movie during activity period. Michael also has the hots for the girl next named Kimberly he takes pictures of her & records her from his bedroom he is afraid to ask her out cause he is an outcast type kid. He's going home 1 day he runs into this Detective named Hayden when he gets home he gets a package in the mail for this game called Brainscan & if you ever heard growing up when people called this new type of genre of gaming called First Person Shooter & they called them murder simulators well this ain't no simulator you have 4 installments & around this time I always heard that virtual reality games were going to be the wave of the future which it never came to be. In this game he goes into 1st person mode & brutally kills this man then cuts his foot off. The next day when coming home he tells Kyle about the game & he wants to play it. He goes to Kimberly House he wants to talk to her & her parents are watching the news there's a story about a local murder & it sounds just like what he did in The Brainscan Game. He goes home & he finds the foot in the freezer. He goes to the victims house The Cops are there he runs into Detective Hayden & then you have the introduction of Trickster who annoys him to play the 2nd installment & kill the witness to his murder. Michael gets in an argument with Kyle cause he wants to borrow a Brainscan. Michael goes to bury the foot this Dog carries it off Michael gets the foot back but then The Dog comes through with his owner & he's hiding in the bush's which is a decent amount of suspense.  Michael records himself to make a confession & when he starts the game up it jumps to Michael waking up he finds this necklace in the freezer which is a charm to for his Friend Kyle he uses his program called Igor that dials number which is kind of cool. Detective Hayden picks up the phone which confirms that Kyle is dead. Next Michael has to cover up foot tracks he left behind at Kyle's House in the meantime you have Cops & towns folk looking for the killer there's this Cop in Kyle's room going through his stuff while Michael is in Kyle yard Trickster calls the house & tells The Cop someone is in the yard then Michael makes a run for it. He is grabbed by a plain clothes Cop but he inadvertently killed him cause that Cop set off a switch & a ton of bricks fell on him. Michael's hiding in the construction site that same Dog from earlier shows up he tells that Dog to leave a group of towns people accidentally killed a Cop. As Michael runs home you have Kimberly trying to get through to Michael. We get to the 4th installment of Brainscan Trickster has Michael go & kill Kimberly but he doesn't want to & Trickster is there he tells him that he is Michael's darkside. They merge & Kimberly wakes up during this & she is scared she gets through to him she tells him how she loves him & she has took pictures of him too. He's broken free & Trickster tells him that he knew he didn't have the guts to do it he opens the door Detective Hayden comes in calls Michael a murder & shoots him in the chest. Michael wakes up & well he played 1 h  **  l of a game. Michael smashes & breaks all of his computer equipment he gets an answer at the door it's Kyle who he is excited to see & Kyle tells him that Brainscan isn't a good game cause he read a story about how a kid in Texas died playing that game. They go to this party & where he asks Kimberly out she tells him she will think about he also finds where she has really took pictures of him. He then gives his Principal Brainscan to see if it's ok for activity period. Final thoughts are it had a cool idea dealing with VR gaming which at the time was going to be the future. The message of this movie is still relevant cause video game violence cause anyone with a half decent education knows it's fake & you have a game like Brainscan that will mind f  **  k you. John Flynn did a good job directing. Edward Furlong did a very good job. Frank Langella was good. James Marsh was ok. Amy Hargreaves did a pretty good job. Not a great movie but a good movie if you're interested you can find it cheap cause I got it in a 4 film set I got for like $10 at The Dollar Store I got it only for this movie cause I'm not going to watch The Craft. I already have Fright Night & maybe I'll watch Monster High around Halloween time. Anyway the next review I will do will be for a movie I am excited to review it will be 20 years ago The Crow.",4,20 years ago Brainscan 7.5/10,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,5427,"['Hello', 'there',

365364,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,6303236723,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","Searching around on On Demand's Fearnet for some good nostalgic horror movies to check out and they had Brainscan on the list, so I checked it out and I love it!Edward Furlong (John Connor from Terminator 2) stars as Michael Brower, a lonely high school student who's a horror movie addict. His best friend, Kyle, is also a horror addict just like him. Kyle tells Michael about a new horror game called Brainscan that gives the player a POV feeling that they're playing a real game and allows them to kill people. Michael takes interest in the game and orders it through the mail, which is where the problems begin. When the game arrives, a weird monster like man by the name of Trickster appears and convinces Michael to play the game, to which he reluctantly agrees. Michael teleports into the game where he kills a man while he was sleeping and cuts of his foot. Turns out that the man was real and was a local in the neighborhood, but Michael doesn't know that......yet until he finds the foot in his freezer the next day and hears about the murder on the news.Trickster lures Michael into playing the following discs of the game to manage to keep his name cleared of any suspicion from the police. When Kyle and his next door neighbor crush, the cutie, Kimberly end up getting tangled in up in all the drama, their lives are put at risk with the video game and Michael doesn't even know it! What was supposed to be a simple and fun video game has now become a hellacious nightmare for young Michael who has no choice but to play the game until the end, whether he wants to or not and manage to keep him from being in trouble with the law at the same time. For each level of the game Michael is in, he has a limited amount of time to complete it. The only possible way out of the game is if he fails to kill the selected victim during the allotted time he's given. Will he succeed?Overall: A pretty good horror film. It's more along the lines of psychological than bloody or scary but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie to watch. Edward Furlong showcases his great acting skills as the lonely cool kid, while T. Ryder Smith delivers as the creepy demonoid monster, The Trickster The plot is original, the acting is decent, and it tells a great story beginning, middle, and end. The end of the movie comes down to the obvious 2 it was expected to come down to but takes a complete cool twist that no one probably saw coming. If you're looking for a movie that will give you a scare, skip this. But if you want a movie that has a great plot and tells the story to perfection, choose Brainscan.",5,Amazing Movie With An Original And Entertaining Plot!,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2606,"['Searching', 'around', 'Demand', 'Fearnet', 'good', 'nostalgic', 'horror', 'movies', 'check', 'out', 'had', 'Brainscan', 'list', 'checked', 'love', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'John', 'Connor', 'Terminator', '2', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Brower', 'lonely', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'horror', 'movie', 'addict', 'best', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'also', 'horror', 'addict', 'just', 'Kyle', 'Michael', 'new', 'horror', 'game', 'called', 'Brainscan', 'player', 'POV', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'playing', 'real', 'game', 'kill', 'people', 'Michael', 'interest', 'game', 'orders', 'mail', 'where', 'problems', 'begin', 'When', 'game', 'weird', 'monster', 'man', 'name', 'Trickster', 'convinces', 'Michael', 'play', 'game', 'reluctantly', 'Michael', 'game', 'where', 'man', 'was', 'sleeping', 'cuts', 'foot', 'out', 'man', 'was', 'real', 'was', 'local', 'neighborhood', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'foot', 'freezer', 'next', 'day', 'hears', 'murder', 'news.Trickster', 'Michael', 'playing', 'following', 'discs', 'game', 'manage', 'keep', 'name', 'cleared', 'suspicion', 'police', 'When', 'Kyle', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'crush', 'cutie', 'Kimberly', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'tangled', 'up', 'drama', 'lives', 'are', 'put', 'risk', 'video', 'game', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'What', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'simple', 'fun', 'video', 'game', 'now', 'become', 'hellacious', 'nightmare', 'young', 'Michael', 'who', 'choice', 'play', 'game', 'end', 'not', 'manage', 'keep', 'being', 'trouble', 'law', 'same', 'time', 'level', 'game', 'Michael', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'complete', 'only', 'possible', 'way', 'game', 'kill', 'selected', 'victim', 'allotted', 'time', 'given', 'Will', 'succeed', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'lines', 'psychological', 'bloody', 'scary', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'great', 'acting', 'skills', 'lonely', 'cool', 'kid', 'T.', 'Ryder', 'Smith', 'delivers', 'creepy', 'demonoid', 'monster', 'Trickster', 'plot', 'original', 'acting', 'decent', 'great', 'story', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'end', 'movie', 'down', 'obvious', '2', 'was', 'expected', 'come', 'down', 'complete', 'cool', 'twist', 'one', 'probably', 'saw', 'coming', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'scare', 'skip', 'want', 'movie', 'great', 'plot', 'story', 'perfection', 'choose', 'Brainscan']",Brainscan VHS

Furlong is all alone at his house with his father on vacation, he reads in a issue of Fangoria about a game called BrainScan..a terrifying reality game. He orders it and when it gets there he experiences the realistic feel of the game about seeing threw the eyes of a serial killer. Soon things spiral down as he finds out that the murder actually happened and from there things dont go so well. Furlong is even visited by the creator of BrainScan, a poofy mullet haired virtual creature named Trixter, T Rider-Smith. Frank Langella (Masters Of The Universe (The He-man Movie), The Ninth Gate) plays the suspicious cop on the murder cases who suspects Furlong for the murders. Interesting premise wasted in the dull script but the actors and the diretor try their best with the corny material. Furlong in one of his pubescent breakout roles is ok but doesnt cut it like I said. Langella is wasted..I was expecting him to turn into Skeletor and break stuff. T Rider Smith has his moments with Trixter but it's hard to keep a straight face when he looks like a mutated troll doll with pimped out attire that matches the dye of his hair. Watched it because I was bored and I still am.

365367,ATNX84AGYIN39,6303236723,"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard""","[0, 0]","When 'Scream' made it big, it was a huge shock that rocked the waves of America...and certainly Hollywood studios. It was a rarity that a horror film was actually a success. Not since the 80's had there been such a huge run for horror films. Freddy, to most fans, was dead. As was Jason and Michael. Yet...everything suddenly came back.Mind you that was 1996, December of 1996, and things before then for horror was very different. In the year, 1994, a science fiction horror film called 'Brainscan' came out. It starred T2's Edward Furlong and was basically underwritten and never heard of. But, either way, success or failure, the film is decent.The film is frightening in a way. In a time when 'The Matrix' was never released yet, this film comes off as very original. With the eerie score by George Clinton, not Dr. Funkenstein, and a cold, silver edged directing job, the film runs like a classy horror film. It's not a slasher and it's not campy, it's just a horror film, which is what I think was a lot of what was missing with the horror resurfacing in the late nineties.Following Furlong's character, he's been ridden with a different lifestyle than others. A car accident killing his mother and giving himself a limp, after one nasty laceration. What's his escapism? Horror films, of course. He even has his own horror club at school, closed down by the 90's cliche, evil principal(I miss these old cliches). When he reads in a magazine, Fangoria to be precise, of a new type of video game, he must take part. It's called Brainscan, hey! that's the title of the film, and it takes you in for more than a ride. As the game has him as a killer, the cops in his town begin finding his victims. What is reality?It's a different film and it's not for everyone. It's a classic in my book. From the writing to the acting, it's all not too shabby. In fact, Furlong plays it real well, and the supporting cast follows just as nicely. The real notable addition is the leader of the game, Trixster, as he mixes in that unnerving edge with some comedic performance, as well. The film just brings us back to a different time, where kids wore flannel and listened to Guns and Roses or Mudhoney...and horror movies were untampered with. Either way, it's a movie you either take or leave it.The DVD has nothing on it, this is purely for film viewing. It's a bummer, I'd like to see something, even a trailer. But, either way, I enjoy the film and am glad they actually put it out!",4,Different and not a slasher.,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,2474,"['When', ""'Scream"", 'made', 'big', 'was', 'huge', 'shock', 'rocked', 'waves', 'America', 'certainly', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'was', 'rarity', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'success', 'Not', '80', 'had', 'there', 'been', 'huge', 'run', 'horror', 'films', 'Freddy', 'most', 'fans', 'was', 'dead', 'was', 'Jason', 'Michael', 'everything', 'suddenly', 'came', 'was', '1996', 'December', '1996', 'things', 'then', 'horror', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'year', '1994', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'film', 'called', ""'Brainscan"", 'came', 'out', 'starred', 'T2', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'was', 'basically', 'underwritten', 'never', 'heard', 'way', 'success', 'failure', 'film', 'decent.The', 'film', 'frightening', 'way', 'time', 'when', 'Matrix', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'yet', 'film', 'off', 'very', 'original', 'eerie', 'score', 'George', 'Clinton', 'not', 'Dr.', 'Funkenstein', 'cold', 'silver', 'edged', 'directing', 'job', 'film', 'classy', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'slasher', 'not', 'campy', 'just', 'horror', 'film', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'horror', 'resurfacing', 'late', 'nineties.Following', 'Furlong', 'character', 'been', 'ridden', 'different', 'lifestyle', 'others', 'car', 'accident', 'killing', 'mother', 'giving', 'limp', 'one', 'nasty', 'laceration', 'What', 'escapism', 'Horror', 'films', 'course', 'even', 'own', 'horror', 'club', 'school', 'closed', 'down', '90', 'cliche', 'evil', 'principal', 'miss', 'old', 'cliches', 'When', 'magazine', 'Fangoria', 'be', 'precise', 'new', 'type', 'video', 'game', 'must', 'take', 'part', 'called', 'Brainscan', 'hey', 'title', 'film', 'more', 'ride', 'game', 'killer', 'cops', 'town', 'begin', 'finding', 'victims', 'What', 'reality', 'different', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'classic', 'book', 'writing', 'acting', 'not', 'too', 'shabby', 'fact', 'Furlong', 'real', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'nicely', 'real', 'notable', 'addition', 'leader', 'game', 'Trixster', 'unnerving', 'edge', 'comedic', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'just', 'back', 'different', 'time', 'where', 'kids', 'wore', 'flannel', 'listened', 'Guns', 'Roses', 'Mudhoney', 'horror', 'movies', 'were', 'untampered', 'way', 'movie', 'take', 'leave', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'purely', 'film', 'viewing', 'bummer', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'something', 'even', 'trailer', 'way', 'enjoy', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'actually', 'put', 'out']",Brainscan VHS

He has the latest computer technology of his day (1994), and when it comes to horror-themed computer games, he's played 'em all. So, Michael is pretty unimpressed when his best friend, Kyle, tells him about ""Brainscan"", a new video game advertised in Fangoria Magazine promising horror thrills like never before. Still, ever bored with his teen-angsty frustrations (like spying on the hottie-hot-hottie next door, Kimberly, if you like the girl next door type, which I happen to like best), Michael finally decides to give Brainscan a try. Unlike anything he's played before, it uses a technique ""similar to hypnosis"", creating a virtual reality experience in mindless violence and murder at a level Michael never could have expected. The only problem is, once the game has been played, you have to keep playing till the game is finished, and whenever Michael plays a round, it seems someone around him has died.""Brainscan"" is a unique and clever, but sadly overlooked horror film from 1994, directed by the late John Flynn. Its story and the intended source of horror, in my opinion, lies in Michael's unintentional acts of murder, fear of being caught by a hard detective played by the always great Frank Langella, and the pressure he is under to reluctantly commit more crimes, causing him to feel completely hopeless in the situation and slowly driving him to madness. However, most viewers seem to focus their attention on ""Trickster"" (played by T. Ryder Smith), a game-host character who appears to Michael more and more, urging him to keep playing, and who perhaps puts many in mind of a not so scary but slightly more annoying Freddy Krueger. Here lies a problem Brainscan has with much of its audience, and I think the problem with folks wanting Trickster to be scary (and complaining that he isn't): he's not supposed to be very scary. I see him as more of a mythological trickster type character with a taste for the more horrific. Think along the lines of the tricksters on ""Supernatural"" or ""Q"" on ""Star Trek the Next Generation"", or Superman's old nemesis, Mr. Mxyzptlk; all tricksters with near limitless powers, and Brainscan's Trickster just seems to be a really horrible one who gets great entertainment from murder and messin' with people's heads. Then again, that's if he is real at all, and the film doesn't make that totally clear. But, my point is, he's not the guy going around doing the killing here, and he's not supposed to be all that scary. Someone like Freddy Krueger trying to be all buddy-buddy with Michael wouldn't play off as well as it does with a slightly goofy but creepy enough looking/acting freakazoid like the Trickster. Another problem some folks might have with this film is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but this sort of ending works in some films, and I think it works very well here. The only bit I didn't like (because it makes no sense) is the very tiny bit tacked on during the end credits involving the German Shepherd.Putting aside the issues that some folks don't like the kind of ending ""Brainscan"" has, and many folks seemed to want it to be a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" kind of film, which is totally not what it is supposed to be, ""Brainscan"", as it is, is a really interesting and fun ride. There's some goofball, '90's kind of stuff, but this is more like some of the classic supernatural horror of the 80's than most of the stuff we've gotten since the 80's, and yet it's not something I felt I had seen before. I'm really glad I stumbled upon the DVD recently, which I didn't even know existed. I had never forgotten this film since I first saw it in theaters shortly before starting college, partially because I always thought Amy Hargreaves (Kimberly) was a hottie in it (apparently, she was 24 when she made it, though playing 16), but also because it's such a fun flick. I just cannot believe it's already nearly 16 years old. Sadly, the DVD is bare bones, and the trailers it carries do not include one for the film. But, at least it's anamorphic widescreen, and I'm just happy to have discovered that it is even available!

365374,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,6303236723,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[3, 4]","If Brainscan were released today, there's absolutely no doubt it would be straight to video, but the early 90s still rocked coz the direct to video market wasn't so huge then and fun little horror flicks like this still got theatrical releases(Hell, Leprechaun did.  Even Leprechaun 2!).  Brainscan has Edward Furlong as a loner horror film obsessed metalhead teen who decides to spice life up a bit by ordering a new horror video game from Fangoria.  It's interactive!!  It puts Eddie in a kind of trance where he believes he's committed a senseless, random killing.  After the game, he's totally psyched about it until he finds out that the murder actually happened.  Soon he's visited by Trickster, a kind of metalhead demon that emerges from his t.v.  Trickster convinces Furlong to play the rest of the discs in the series.  Ya see, each disc has a catch that traps the player into having to play the next disc or risk getting caught by the police.  This includes destroying evidence and even murdering witnesses.  Soon Furlong is nearing the end of his rope.  His best friend ditches him, the police are starting to snoop around, but on the positive side he does seem to be finally establishing a relationship with his neighbor who he has a secret crush on.  So, how does Furlong pull himself out of this trap and get the girl of his dreams?  Can he even do it?  The answer is actually a very satisfying one if you ask me.  I really liked the way this movie ended, though some don't.On the acting front, Furlong is Furlong.  The guy looks and talks like he's stoned in just about everything I've seen him in, and this is no exception.  Frank Langella isn't given much to do other than be a snoopy detective, but he does it with style.  He's a rather underused actor if you ask me.  Amy Hargreaves is decent enough.  She's no knockout, but that is what I loved.  She's just cute enough to look like a real high school girl a young man might have a crush on rather than the fake supermodel types that tend to creep into these movies.  Alot of flak is given to T. Ryder Smith, or just the character of Trickster in general.  The character is usually seen as an annoying poor man's Freddy Krueger.  Well, I liked him.  The technology in this film, both the effects and the equipment in Furlong's room might seem ancient already, but it was a product of the day.  That stuff was state of the art at the time, right there at the beginning of CD-ROM.  It's kinda neat to see it actually, and it shows how far we've come in so short of time.  Although I don't think the doodad Furlong uses as his telephone exists yet, at least not quite the way he uses it.  Maybe I'm wrong about that though.  Brainscan remains a fun little gem to rediscover, it does still deliver the goods for the horror fan.  It's directed by the same guy who gave us the Steven Seagal opus, Out For Justice.
