739045,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00008DDVK,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[32, 32]","This is the first video of Rainbeau Mars' Sacred Yoga Practice: Vinyasa Flow series. Although it is labelled as a ""Beginners"" workout, I would not recommend it for those totally new to yoga, as 1) the instruction is not overly detailed, and 2) some of the poses present a bit of a challenge and require some strength.  Beginners might also find more helpful to start with Mars' ""Pure Tranquility"" video prior to using this one.Rainbeau begins the practice lying on the floor in relaxation pose--a nice change--and slowly leads you through some basic breathing and warm up stretches. She then moves to an all-fours position (table pose) for some nice back stretches: there are several different sequences involving cat pose plus a few downward dogs, some of which are held for a fairly lengthy period of time. From here, Rainbeau guides you into a standing forward bend with bent legs, gently encouraging you to open up further into this pose with several repetitions. She also spends a bit of time in a mountain pose variation before moving on to a single sun salutation. This series is done at very slow pace: Rainbeau goes through lunges on both sides and then lowers to the floor in push-up pose, which brings the practice to an end at 28 total minutes.Rainbeau comes across as sort of a young, hippy chick. She is obviously very knowledgable about yoga--she sometimes uses the Sanskrit names for the postures and provides detailed anatomical information--and she is gently encouraging throughout the practice. Although she cues well, at times her voiceover cuing was slightly out-of-sync with her on-screen movements.Overall, I enjoyed this practice, which I would describe as gently challenging rather than gentle per se. This is not the video I would choose for pure relaxation, but I definitely will reach for it again when I want a moderate-length, not-too-difficult practice.",4,A nicely flowing basic practice to introduce the series,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,1884,"['first', 'video', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Sacred', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'Vinyasa', 'Flow', 'series', 'labelled', 'Beginners', 'workout', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'totally', 'new', 'yoga', '1', 'instruction', 'not', 'overly', 'detailed', '2', 'poses', 'present', 'bit', 'challenge', 'require', 'strength', 'Beginners', 'might', 'also', 'find', 'more', 'helpful', 'start', 'Mars', 'Pure', 'Tranquility', 'video', 'prior', 'using', 'one.Rainbeau', 'practice', 'lying', 'floor', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'nice', 'change', 'slowly', 'basic', 'breathing', 'warm', 'up', 'stretches', 'then', 'all-fours', 'position', 'table', 'pose', 'nice', 'back', 'stretches', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'sequences', 'involving', 'cat', 'pose', 'few', 'downward', 'dogs', 'are', 'held', 'fairly', 'lengthy', 'period', 'time', 'here', 'Rainbeau', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'bent', 'legs', 'gently', 'encouraging', 'open', 'up', 'further', 'pose', 'several', 'repetitions', 'also', 'bit', 'time', 'mountain', 'pose', 'variation', 'moving', 'single', 'sun', 'salutation', 'series', 'done', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'Rainbeau', 'lunges', 'sides', 'then', 'lowers', 'floor', 'push-up', 'pose', 'practice', 'end', '28', 'total', 'minutes.Rainbeau', 'sort', 'young', 'hippy', 'chick', 'obviously', 'very', 'knowledgable', 'yoga', 'sometimes', 'Sanskrit', 'names', 'postures', 'detailed', 'anatomical', 'information', 'gently', 'encouraging', 'practice', 'well', 'times', 'voiceover', 'cuing', 'was', 'slightly', 'out-of-sync', 'on-screen', 'movements.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'practice', 'would', 'describe', 'gently', 'challenging', 'rather', 'gentle', 'se', 'not', 'video', 'would', 'choose', 'pure', 'relaxation', 'definitely', 'will', 'reach', 'again', 'when', 'want', 'moderate-length', 'not-too-difficult', 'practice']",N/A
739046,A1ZUK82SVPB3MX,B00008DDVK,Candice Michelle,"[5, 5]","The video is shot on a beautiful Hawaiian island and features Rainbeau Mars performing her Yoga practice on a rock bed with the ocean waters surrounding her. This setting is not only beautiful but the accompanying new age music is both tranquil and blissful.Rainbeau has a pleasant personality, using many Sanskrit names for the poses, as she leads a series of Hatha Vinyasa style Yoga poses beginning lying down. The moves are somewhat gentle and slow-placed but require enough strength to keep a beginner feeling challenged. While the Yoga practice of this video will certainly leave you feeling very relaxed, it is not exactly ""Yoga for relaxation"" per se, as the poses do engage the muscles some. Rainbeau's ""Pure Tranquility"" DVD would be a better choice for that.Overall this is a great DVD for Yoga beginners. The only slight drawback for me is that I prefer an all-relaxing Yoga DVD for when I want to relax, and a more challenging Yoga DVD for when I want to really sweat. The Yoga practice of this DVD however, falls somewhere inbetween, and therefore slightly short of either. However, everything else about this video - the set, the instructor and the music - is wonderful, and I'd eagerly recommend this to beginners.",4,"Serene setting, midly challenging but overall gentle Yoga practice",1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,1230,"['video', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'Hawaiian', 'island', 'features', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'performing', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'rock', 'bed', 'ocean', 'waters', 'surrounding', 'setting', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'accompanying', 'new', 'age', 'music', 'tranquil', 'blissful.Rainbeau', 'pleasant', 'personality', 'using', 'many', 'Sanskrit', 'names', 'poses', 'series', 'Hatha', 'Vinyasa', 'style', 'Yoga', 'beginning', 'lying', 'down', 'moves', 'are', 'somewhat', 'gentle', 'slow-placed', 'require', 'enough', 'strength', 'keep', 'beginner', 'feeling', 'challenged', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'video', 'will', 'certainly', 'leave', 'feeling', 'very', 'relaxed', 'not', 'exactly', 'Yoga', 'relaxation', 'se', 'poses', 'do', 'engage', 'muscles', 'Rainbeau', 'Pure', 'Tranquility', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'choice', 'that.Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'Yoga', 'beginners', 'only', 'slight', 'drawback', 'prefer', 'all-relaxing', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'when', 'want', 'relax', 'more', 'challenging', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'when', 'want', 'really', 'sweat', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'DVD', 'however', 'somewhere', 'inbetween', 'therefore', 'slightly', 'short', 'However', 'everything', 'else', 'video', 'set', 'instructor', 'music', 'wonderful', ""'d"", 'eagerly', 'recommend', 'beginners']",N/A

It's particularly excellent if you are having stiffness or pain in your lower back.Rainbeau is a gifted teacher who comes across very naturally and openly. She radiates sincerity and grace.The scenery is beautiful which is always a nice addition and is nice to wake up to (especially in the middle of January:) )and the music is a perfect compliment to it.I would highly recommend this to those new to yoga or those (like me) who have been doing it for years but want to have a gentle routine for those days when you want to do some yoga but don't want to push too hard. I felt amazing after doing this tape (and I've got over 80 Yoga videos) and will use this regularly on those more ""Gentle"" days.Namaste.",5,Pure Bliss!,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,910,"['tape', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'first', '4', 'tape', 'set', 'really', 'wonderful', 'thru', 'gentle', 'sequence', 'poses', 'emphasis', 'breathing', 'will', 'open', 'body', 'mind', 'spirit', 'gentle', 'way', 'particularly', 'excellent', 'are', 'having', 'stiffness', 'pain', 'lower', 'back.Rainbeau', 'gifted', 'teacher', 'who', 'very', 'naturally', 'openly', 'sincerity', 'grace.The', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'always', 'nice', 'addition', 'nice', 'wake', 'up', 'especially', 'middle', 'January', 'music', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'it.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'new', 'yoga', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'want', 'have', 'gentle', 'routine', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'do', 'yoga', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'push', 'too', 'hard', 'felt', 'amazing', 'doing', 'tape', ""'ve"", 'got', '80', 'Yoga', 'videos', 'will', 'use', 'regularly', 'more', 'Gentle', 'days.Namaste']",N/A

The poses are perfect for beginners or relaxing for intermediates. As Rainbeau leads you through a flowing set of asanas the pleasant narrations is subtly calming.

During the first 30 minutes you will be doing Cat/Cow, Downward Facing Dog, Child's Pose, Table, Moving Cat, Forward Bends, Low Lunges and Cobra.

739050,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B00008DDVK,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[2, 2]","Many people wrote great reviews already. I want to add that Rainbeau has great body awareness, she is very calm & inspiring. She teaches very patiently, gives modifications for those who aren't as flexible or as strong. There are some ""new agey"" terms or mantra to cultivate the spiritual side & mind/body awareness connection, but much less then her ""power sweat"" or ""power"" dvds.For each pose/stretch, she tells you what organs it benefits, body system, ailments, or for which people it would help depending on which sport they participate in. She is not overly chatty at all and is good on details making sure you don't overdo it.She mostly concentrates on simple lying down stretch, 2 lying down spinal twists, downward dog, standing fwd bends, cat/cow stretching w/1 leg up & then also w/knee to nose, crescent (lower leg on ground), mountain & baby cobra.The setting is a beautiful beach w/waves, dolphin light music and it's in 2.0 or 5.1 surround sound.The extras are to work w/o narration and a detailed teaching of mountain, downward dog, lunge, baby cobra, and chair seen in it's entirety of side or front views w/even more detailed straight forward instruction.This is best for those who are beginners, those who want a more spiritual aware basic instruction, or those who want a slow relaxing workout that isn't too physically demanding. Those who want a normal speed workout should try her ""power"" for strength & ""sweat"" for cardio dvds.You can see an idea of her personality at youtube under her name that shows her other dvd workouts or her advanced, graceful ability.",4,Spiritual slow for beginners & relaxation w/telling of benefits for each asana,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,1584,"['Many', 'people', 'wrote', 'great', 'reviews', 'already', 'want', 'add', 'Rainbeau', 'great', 'body', 'awareness', 'very', 'calm', 'inspiring', 'very', 'patiently', 'modifications', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'flexible', 'strong', 'are', 'new', 'agey', 'terms', 'mantra', 'cultivate', 'spiritual', 'side', 'mind/body', 'awareness', 'connection', 'much', 'less', 'then', 'power', 'sweat', 'power', 'pose/stretch', 'what', 'benefits', 'body', 'system', 'ailments', 'people', 'would', 'help', 'depending', 'sport', 'participate', 'not', 'overly', 'chatty', 'good', 'details', 'making', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'it.She', 'mostly', 'simple', 'lying', 'down', 'stretch', '2', 'lying', 'down', 'spinal', 'twists', 'downward', 'dog', 'standing', 'fwd', 'bends', 'cat/cow', 'stretching', 'w/1', 'leg', 'up', 'then', 'also', 'w/knee', 'nose', 'crescent', 'lower', 'leg', 'ground', 'mountain', 'baby', 'cobra.The', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'w/waves', 'dolphin', 'light', 'music', '2.0', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound.The', 'extras', 'are', 'work', 'w/o', 'narration', 'detailed', 'teaching', 'mountain', 'downward', 'dog', 'lunge', 'baby', 'cobra', 'chair', 'seen', 'entirety', 'side', 'front', 'views', 'w/even', 'more', 'detailed', 'straight', 'forward', 'instruction.This', 'best', 'who', 'are', 'beginners', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'spiritual', 'aware', 'basic', 'instruction', 'who', 'want', 'slow', 'relaxing', 'workout', ""n't"", 'too', 'physically', 'demanding', 'who', 'want', 'normal', 'speed', 'workout', 'should', 'try', 'power', 'strength', 'sweat', 'cardio', 'dvds.You', 'can', 'see', 'idea', 'personality', 'youtube', 'name', 'other', 'dvd', 'workouts', 'advanced', 'graceful', 'ability']",N/A
