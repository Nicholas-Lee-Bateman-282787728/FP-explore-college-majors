Seeing is not the same as reading about it.  Well, even Jews have dumb narcissists who endanger everyone and throw other people under the bus as if it weren't even happening.  That's the kind of person depicted in this movie.  Because her kids never figure her out, they are hampered in their assessments of the outside world as well and so she created and instilled a downfall for each of her children and they have no idea they have been fed a fatal dosage.  I'm sure that off camera, the ending is that her ""boyfriend"" kills her.

He did not disappoint, nor did the rest of the cast.  I had an instinct that this film would be hard to watch because I countered it with ""Have you heard about the Morgans""..so I was not wrong to pair it with this film.  It has a rare sexual rawness that is disturbing, and images of concentration camp experiments that sicken your heart. For all the nakedness and sex, it actually told an important part of the story for a change.  It's about how the horror of one young woman's experience of being abandoned by her family in Nazi Germany, to be put in a concentration camp, falling in love with a German doctor, abandoned again, then how it affects her two sons lives years later.  It is a film that left ME to think through what I saw, and it brought up feelings about my own experiences, and it left me feeling like I'd seen a story told which has the potential to heal. The purpose of art.  A commercial movie is all neatly wrapped up in a non offensive package with how to feel and interpret it, whereas here I was watching their story but interested in my own reactions and judgements and 'allowing' myself to watch this movie with the curtains open...I took an acting class and was fascinated how it felt to explore that process...and this film made me feel that intensity like no other film ever has...it was only after watching the actors and the director's comments about how they felt, that I see that for them it was that same feeling...the terror doing something that makes you want to run the other direction, but once you do it, you have a fierceness no one can take away.  We are all filled with judgements about things, about how we should live and how much we will allow ourselves to be happy, and this film, on so many levels, lets you explore that.  It is interesting that I am seeing this film as I'm struggling with family issues, so I would say, if you are drawn to this movie, then most definitely watch it, but get a comedy for later....it is intense and will likely affect you.  It's not a film that I would watch over and over..but I won't forget that it said to me to rethink what I've told myself based on what I experienced as a child.

1289807,A1R46XWHZ01D34,B002UJIY2A,Kay F Gibbs,"[1, 1]","The film begins with a dramatic portrayal of a kind of perverted love story, the traumatic bonding between a Nazi Doctor and a female prisoner; a young woman abandoned by her parents escaping  Nazi Germany leaving her behind, alone, and how she sacrifices the last of her self respect in order to survive Nazi captivity.  Surviving that captivity and suffering from the effects of her trauma unknown to her, she marries and becomes the mother of two sons living in New York City.  What follows are the desperate measures by the family in grappling with the results of the mother's failure at managing her life and how, like a virus, her abusive past has infected her two sons and the people they are involved with, now adult men trying to cope with the lives they have inherited.To me Death In Love is a depiction of the hidden cruelty within our society as a whole, the incapacity to truly love, the sado-masochism hiding behind what we blindly accept as being for our benefit or best interest.  The film was better than expected. I was hesitant in viewing it based on the previews I watched but I have rarely been misled by Bisset's choices in her roles or films and they have surprised me recently, so I felt compelled to see it. This film is different than The Fine Art of Love as the rage is seriously repressed and the cruelty not so obvious.  In Death In Love the anger and rage being reenacted is abounding, real and often frightening.If you want to be enlightened and know nothing about post traumatic stress disorder, traumatic bonding or Stockholm syndrome, then this is a film to see that leaves little hidden from view.The acting is excellent and believable.",4,Best film I have seen depicting traumatic bonding...,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,1671,"['film', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'kind', 'perverted', 'love', 'story', 'traumatic', 'bonding', 'Nazi', 'Doctor', 'female', 'prisoner', 'young', 'woman', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'escaping', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'leaving', 'behind', 'alone', 'how', 'last', 'self', 'respect', 'order', 'survive', 'Nazi', 'captivity', 'Surviving', 'captivity', 'suffering', 'effects', 'trauma', 'unknown', 'marries', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'What', 'are', 'desperate', 'measures', 'family', 'grappling', 'results', 'mother', 'failure', 'managing', 'life', 'how', 'virus', 'abusive', 'past', 'infected', 'two', 'sons', 'people', 'are', 'involved', 'now', 'men', 'trying', 'cope', 'lives', 'have', 'inherited.To', 'Death', 'Love', 'depiction', 'hidden', 'cruelty', 'society', 'whole', 'incapacity', 'truly', 'love', 'sado-masochism', 'hiding', 'what', 'blindly', 'accept', 'being', 'benefit', 'best', 'interest', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'was', 'hesitant', 'viewing', 'based', 'previews', 'watched', 'have', 'rarely', 'been', 'misled', 'Bisset', 'choices', 'roles', 'films', 'have', 'surprised', 'recently', 'felt', 'compelled', 'see', 'film', 'different', 'Fine', 'Art', 'Love', 'rage', 'seriously', 'repressed', 'cruelty', 'not', 'so', 'obvious', 'Death', 'Love', 'anger', 'rage', 'being', 'reenacted', 'abounding', 'real', 'often', 'frightening.If', 'want', 'be', 'enlightened', 'know', 'nothing', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'traumatic', 'bonding', 'Stockholm', 'syndrome', 'then', 'film', 'see', 'little', 'hidden', 'view.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'believable']",Death in Love

The content is extremely disturbing, from that beginning montage of lovemaking and human butchery, to that last scene of misery, pain and release. I had been warned ahead of time to expect extreme dysfunction in all of the relationships shown, from the concentration camps to 1990s NY, so hopefully this will help a little.The story follows a concentration camp survivor, later played by Bisset, who with her two sons (played very well by Brody and Lucas) fill a life of guilt, morose relationships and shallow emotions. As the story progresses we are intermittently subjected to harsh visuals from the war years to modern day abusive lovemaking. A difficult watch through and through, but it should not detract from the believability of the performances. The BD clarity is non-existent in all scenes, with prevalent grain and focus issues from the hand-helds at various times. The sound was selectable between standard 5.1 and DTS, which is used with most clarity in that final scene. The supplements are thorough and include:* 5 interviews totaling 11:39 minutes, all lodef. Main cast and crew discuss their reasons for being in/making the film. Has a play all option.* 5 featurettes totaling 26:18 minutes, intermittent HD clarity in some of the interviews and behind the scenes shots, most lodef. Play all option. The longest featurette contains interviews from all of the parties akin to the lengthy lovemaking requirements. Probably the rawest input you will hear from this many actors about doing these kinds of scenes. I did not even recognize Baccarin (remember her most fromSerenity [Blu-ray]) until her interview. The Sundance intro and Q&A; are the standard material from a release there.Region A coded, with English subs only.
