1277207,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B002LVGXHK,,"[0, 0]","This is by far one of Hallmark's best Christmas movies. In fact it is so good that I think if Sandra Bullock and Jonathan Silverman had been cast in the lead roles it would have been a five star huge hit. Don't get me wrong it is very good as is but I couldn't help wondering if those roles had more mainstream actors that it would have been so much more. In fact it reminded me a little of Bullock's role inWhile You Were Sleeping. The support cast is great, especially Bruce Davison in one of his finest roles. He should have gotten an academy award for this one. If this doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you are definitely a Scrooge.A woman has lost the spirit of Christmas because of a hard life. Fortunately her neighbor tells her he is a secret Santa and he wants her to help him give presents to those that need them. Not necessarily a present with a price tag, it can be helping them to reach out to someone or accomplish a goal. The people that are picked are not necessarily because they are financially bad off. It could be if they need hope and/or faith in the human spirit. It is a truly wonderful study of our perception of others and how we can help each other be better people by being more aware of each others needs. As we all know the holiday season is hectic and we sometimes stare something in the face and don't see what is right there in front of us.

1277211,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B002LVGXHK,,"[0, 1]","How do you pick the best Christmas movies to watch?  There are so many (I don't know whether hundreds or thousands) of them out there today.  I just saw Christmas Angel for the first time and would say that it's got some unique things to offer which transcend your typical Christmas themes.  No matter the genre, the movies that make a long-term impact on a person do so because of the merits of their stories, not their actors or marketing alone.  And if this movie had a canned Christmas drama premise, of a person with a troubled past who warms up to the spirit of giving and loving, I'd probably have no interest in seeing it again.  While that is part of the story, it is not the heart of the movie.  The heart of Christmas Angel is individual enterprise in proactively helping others in the community, which is surprisingly underemphasized in most Christmas stories.  Most Christmas stories revolve just around the romance, or someone becoming less selfish, or the silly catastrophes that happen during the hectic Christmas season.  There are so many renditions of ""A Christmas Carol"" by this point, that it's time for something new, and Christmas Angel is a new way of presenting the same kind of theme as Charles Dickens did in 1843, well over 150 years ago.  One of Christmas Angel's merits is that the female lead in this movie, played by Kari Hawker, is the kind of person we can much more easily relate to than Ebenezer Scrooge.  Scrooge wouldn't be interesting for long without exploring in detail the lives of people he knew, but the character of Ashley in Christmas Angel is interesting on her own.  She gets you interested early on with a day filled with unexpected catastrophes.There are always things I can explain about why a movie is appealing, but sometimes there is ""magic"" in a movie or piece of music which I CAN'T describe, where I can sense the spirit that drove its creation and made it transcend stylistic and story limits.  I was surprised by how the second half of this movie blossomed with warmth and solid values, when I thought this movie had already reached its potential a little over halfway through.  The extended resolution to the story resolves every plot element in a more than satisfactory way.  Like the movie Last Ounce of Courage, which is one of my favorite Christmas movies (and probably the only one with more focus on patriotic activism than Christmas!), this movie goes extra steps in its script's affirmation of Bible-based values.  It doesn't feel fake or awkward in doing so, to its credit.  It's not a ""faith"" film, but it has Bible-based values of chastity (marriage rather than cohabitation), honoring others above yourselves, responding to another's kindness by showing kindness to yet others, and honoring the dead who have been heroes and role models.  In other words, a Christian ethic imbues the movie.Concerning acting:  The younger male lead, played by K. C. Clyde, is really fun for me to watch, and I would love to see him play in more romances.  He is as good and charismatic as a funny male romantic lead as Cary Grant was, with his own personality and a different kind of cleverness.  The female lead is decent and definitely has chemistry with her male counterpart, but for much of the movie, her demeanor is stuck-up--but the cause of that later gets explained, so my impression of the earlier scenes in the movie was reshaped after that.  These two leads don't always articulate clearly, but then, superstars Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper didn't, either, and there are subtitles if you need to catch lines.  The character who helps her learn to open her heart and be a ""Secret Santa"" in his stead, played by Bruce Davison, is highly likable and shepherds her along toward personal growth.  I enjoy how the script slowly brings out information about the characters, which is true to life and also good storytelling.Speaking of storytelling, I rather enjoy the cute cliche, where the male and female literally bump into each other in public and have a stormy or awkward beginning.  I'd much rather have a story with a little added cuteness like that than one which tries deliberately to present the badness of the world with no holds barred.  That is the ONLY cliche in this movie!  Every movie's allowed a few cliches without losing credibility :-) .The last impressions I want to share from Christmas Angel are its sights and sounds.  The cinematography was really well thought out.  It was filmed at Christmastime in Chicago, and the beautiful outdoor shots are composed really well so that they add necessary brightness to some difficult discussions the two principals have with each other.  And when they have romantic scenes without the tension, the outdoor shots amplify the joy.  I really like the music, too.  It has nice, gentle, lovely counterpoint that feels sweet but not sappy.",5,"The values go farther than typical Christmas fare; the story feels like a blossoming flower; and great acting, filming, &

The better ones like Season of Miracles, The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year, Boyfriend For Christmas, etc., have a good theme, a story that moves along and doesn't put you to sleep, and interesting characters. This one, for me, was very slow... and very irritating. The male star, ""Will,"" was trying to be upbeat throughout the whole movie, and all he got from the girl at work (Francine), the girl he was chasing (Ashley), and his boss...was rude, arrogant, apathetic behavior. A little of that would have been o.k. for awhile, but this went on for 3/4 of the movie. I would have given up long ago on Ashley. She never cracked a smile, had one nice thing to say, or had one spark of fun about her. She was sullen, withdrawn, and constantly rude. The only time she seemed to be happy was when she was giving away Nick's (a rich philanthropist she was helping) money. I would've packed up my bags, and moved to another location by this time.

I even gave a little fist pump when his carelessness with an article gets him demoted to fact-checker. Huh. I thought it'd be an interesting swerve to kick off this review by focusing on the third most relevant character in the movie. Whoops.I take it back. Let's talk about Ashley Matthews (Kari Hawker) - lonely, unemployed Ashley Matthews. For her, things are in a state of suck. The water in her apartment just died. This is especially problematic because, at the time, she was in the shower. Luckily, there's water from her dog's drinking bowl to finish washing off her hair (not so lucky for the dog). Ashley is running late for a job interview, and so, naturally, her car won't start. Then she loses her cell phone. That's okay. That way, she didn't have to have that call informing her that the position's been filled. So, yeah, state of suck.People have let her down all her life. Raised by the foster care system, Ashley Matthews finds it hard to trust. Her only friend - the only person she ever really talks to - is her neighbor, kindly old Nick Anderson (Bruce Davison). When Ashley confides that she's in dire straits, Nick offers her a job as his personal assistant. Ashley reflexively rejects the offer, not wanting to take pity money from the old softie.Except that it's a legitimate offer. Three weeks before Christmas, Nick has got stuff to do. See, he's a secret Santa, an anonymous do-gooder. Ashley is stunned to learn that Nick is filthy rich, that he once was a CEO, a titan of the industry, before he gave it all up. Ashley confesses that she's not down with the seasonal cheer. She thinks Christmas the most depressing time of the year, regards it as a ""soulless, commercial endeavor that encourages overspending and overeating."" And, oboy, don't get her started on Christmas carols. She takes the job.So don't get this CHRISTMAS ANGEL (2009) twisted with theChristmas Angel(2012) that stars Kevin Sorbo, Teri Polo, and Della Reese. Both happen to be really watchable holiday pictures. I would say the most well-known actor in our version is Bruce Davison, and he's fine as the benevolent Nick Anderson. But the story truly revolves around Kari Hawker's role. Her Ashley Matthews is a compelling character. There's a sense of gratification in watching Ashley metamorphose from being this very guarded person to someone who gradually reaches out as her walls of reserve crumble. And like how the holiday spirit slowly comes to possess Ashley, so does this movie creep up on you. I didn't expect to be so moved, and I credit Hawker and Davison and a script that is sentimental but doesn't pander.In the end, I even grew to tolerate K.C. Clyde, him what plays that smug writer. Is he snooping for a scoop, trying to reverse his demotion? Is he in like - and maybe more than in like - with secret Santa's personal assistant? Yes. And yes. The conflict for our writer is that he promised his editor a story, except that the very private Nick doesn't want news of his deeds to get around, and Ashley is very protective of Nick. This being that kind of story that's set during that time of year, I had an inkling which way the writer would lean. Anyway, this is come full circle, and I guess I'll end this talking about the film's third most relevant character. Go see CHRISTMAS ANGEL, and then go do someone a solid but keep it to yourself. Somewhere, there's an Ashley Matthews who's a little less lonely and with a better opinion of seasonal cheer.",4,philanthropist in hiding,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,3581,"['took', 'forever', 'day', 'warm', 'up', 'William', 'Price', 'K.C', 'Clyde', 'smug', 'writer', 'Modern', 'Business', 'Weekly', 'even', 'gave', 'little', 'fist', 'pump', 'when', 'carelessness', 'article', 'demoted', 'fact-checker', 'Huh', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'interesting', 'swerve', 'kick', 'off', 'review', 'focusing', 'third', 'most', 'relevant', 'character', 'movie', 'Whoops.I', 'take', 'back', 'Let', 'talk', 'Ashley', 'Matthews', 'Kari', 'Hawker', 'lonely', 'unemployed', 'Ashley', 'Matthews', 'things', 'are', 'state', 'suck', 'water', 'apartment', 'just', 'died', 'especially', 'problematic', 'time', 'was', 'shower', 'Luckily', 'water', 'dog', 'drinking', 'bowl', 'finish', 'washing', 'off', 'hair', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'dog', 'Ashley', 'running', 'late', 'job', 'interview', 'so', 'naturally', 'car', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'Then', 'cell', 'phone', 'okay', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'call', 'informing', 'position', 'been', 'filled', 'So', 'yeah', 'state', 'suck.People', 'have', 'let', 'life', 'Raised', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'Ashley', 'Matthews', 'hard', 'trust', 'only', 'friend', 'only', 'person', 'ever', 'really', 'talks', 'neighbor', 'kindly', 'old', 'Nick', 'Anderson', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'When', 'Ashley', 'dire', 'straits', 'Nick', 'job', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Ashley', 'reflexively', 'offer', 'not', 'wanting', 'take', 'pity', 'money', 'old', 'softie.Except', 'legitimate', 'offer', 'Three', 'weeks', 'Christmas', 'Nick', 'got', 'stuff', 'do', 'See', 'secret', 'Santa', 'anonymous', 'do-gooder', 'Ashley', 'stunned', 'learn', 'Nick', 'filthy', 'rich', 'once', 'was', 'CEO', 'titan', 'industry', 'gave', 'up', 'Ashley', 'not', 'down', 'seasonal', 'cheer', 'Christmas', 'most', 'depressing', 'time', 'year', 'regards', 'soulless', 'commercial', 'endeavor', 'overspending', 'overeating', 'oboy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'Christmas', 'carols', 'job.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'CHRISTMAS', 'ANGEL', '2009', 'twisted', 'theChristmas', 'Angel', '2012', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'Della', 'Reese', 'happen', 'be', 'really', 'watchable', 'holiday', 'pictures', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'well-known', 'actor', 'version', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'fine', 'benevolent', 'Nick', 'Anderson', 'story', 'truly', 'around', 'Kari', 'Hawker', 'role', 'Ashley', 'Matthews', 'compelling', 'character', 'sense', 'gratification', 'watching', 'Ashley', 'metamorphose', 'being', 'very', 'guarded', 'person', 'someone', 'who', 'gradually', 'out', 'walls', 'reserve', 'crumble', 'how', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'slowly', 'possess', 'Ashley', 'so', 'movie', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'so', 'moved', 'credit', 'Hawker', 'Davison', 'script', 'sentimental', ""n't"", 'pander.In', 'end', 'even', 'grew', 'tolerate', 'K.C', 'Clyde', 'what', 'smug', 'writer', 'snooping', 'scoop', 'trying', 'reverse', 'demotion', 'maybe', 'more', 'like', 'secret', 'Santa', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Yes', 'yes', 'conflict', 'writer', 'promised', 'editor', 'story', 'very', 'private', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'want', 'news', 'deeds', 'get', 'Ashley', 'very', 'protective', 'Nick', 'being', 'kind', 'story', 'set', 'time', 'year', 'had', 'inkling', 'way', 'writer', 'would', 'lean', 'Anyway', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'end', 'talking', 'film', 'third', 'most', 'relevant', 'character', 'Go', 'see', 'CHRISTMAS', 'ANGEL', 'then', 'go', 'do', 'someone', 'solid', 'keep', 'Somewhere', 'Ashley', 'Matthews', 'who', 'little', 'less', 'lonely', 'better', 'opinion', 'seasonal', 'cheer']",N/A

I only wish someone had explained the story behind ""The Drummer Boy"" song to the lead female character as she seemed greatly disturbed by this song.All in all, I would recommend this movie for ""Family Night"" and applaud the producers for creating a good family movie void of any foul language, sexuality, or violence.

I was attracted to this by the synopsis of the story and the fact that I think Bruce Davison is a terrific actor.What I didn't expect was to be watching this the day after my brother passed away after a long, drawn out illness.  But I was trying to find something that I thought would occupy my mind for a little while.  It gave me a great deal more than I'd bargained for.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone--it says a great deal about renewing the spirit and caring about other people as well as being a great Christmas story.  Yes, there are some sad moments, but I had shed so many tears that a few  more didn't seem to matter.  There were some instances that the acting left a bit to be desired (not Mr. Davison's), but the overall feel and idea of the story should not be missed.  In a world where car chases and gratuitous violence seem to rule a large sector of our entertainment choices, I'd take something like this any day of the week.
