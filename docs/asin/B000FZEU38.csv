Other countries (Canada, UK) have a shorter film without the gay scenes.  Like Dante's Cove on the same network, the gay scenes are, I guess, suppose to excuse the limited scope of the plot and the acting.

997703,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FZEU38,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Who can tell why this film was made? FORCE OF IMPACT (aka DEADLY SKIES) was apparently made for TV though it seems highly unlikely that it was ever screened. Not that the story itself is a problem: giant asteroid is sailing toward the earth with the potential of destroying the planet unless someone is smart enough to out guess the logistics.  In this film the smart one is Rae Dawn Chong in a role she can sleep walk through.  The government is not eager for her company to employ its 'better than government issue' strategies:  Rob LaBelle and Michael Moriarty have a great time being mean.  But it is Rea dawn Chong who remembers a terrific mind in the form of Antonio Sabato, Jr. who can save the planet....And that is where the difference lies - Chong encounters Sabato and his lover Michael Boisvert in flagrante in a completely nude sex scene that is as sensual as any found in the movies.  Nothing much is made of the reason for Sabato to be gay and that is good: he just happens to be a gay man in a healthy relationship, and the chemistry with Boisvert is definitely there.  But that is about all we get, other than an opening scene when two beautiful young au naturel women make it in a swimming pool while a mini-asteroid collides in the water.So it is another routine space age flick, but add to the salad the eye candy offered, and it is almost worth sitting through the movie!  Pretty people help keep this one afloat.

997705,A4F8CJ1L4348V,B000FZEU38,"Mark ""Madison Man""","[8, 8]","I really liked this movie because of the gay theme and positive story. There are many ""mainstream"" movies out there with gay characters that are not positive at all. This story shows the gay men in a positive way and doing something with purpose. What it also shows is how the military discharges men and women, and in this case men who are gay because they are gay. The main character was sick of ""living a lie"" within the military and came out. It was then that they discharged him. You can be hetrosexual and advertise it to everyone, but let someone say that they are gay and they are discharged from the military. Granted this is a B thriller movie, but in my book it is A+. I recommend everyone seeing this movie. If for nothing else, to see a gay positive movie that does have a happy ending.",5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent",1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,799,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'gay', 'theme', 'positive', 'story', 'are', 'many', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'there', 'gay', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'positive', 'story', 'gay', 'men', 'positive', 'way', 'doing', 'something', 'purpose', 'What', 'also', 'how', 'military', 'discharges', 'men', 'women', 'case', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'gay', 'are', 'gay', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'sick', 'living', 'lie', 'military', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'then', 'discharged', 'can', 'be', 'hetrosexual', 'advertise', 'everyone', 'let', 'someone', 'say', 'are', 'gay', 'are', 'discharged', 'military', 'Granted', 'B', 'thriller', 'movie', 'book', 'A+', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'seeing', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'see', 'gay', 'positive', 'movie', 'have', 'happy', 'ending']",Deadly Skies

Two meteors are heading towards Earth and one, the sneaky one hiding behind the first, is on a collision course with our Planet! Will anyone listen? No, of course not. Except one scientist who resigned from the military, coming out as a gay man in the process. Yes, there still isn't any place for a gay man in the service...but all is not lost, he will still have his chance to save the day. And the Earth. A nice thought. The acting was fair. The two actors playing gay were a touch awkward with each other, though very handsome. I wished fervently for more obvious intimacy between them, after all they are seriously involved, right? Well, at least an attempt is being made to have a heroic gay couple. Both actors are very mascluine, not parodies, for once. I only wish they were more comfortable with each other.

Although the story line has been played more than once, the fact that the key men are gay and a couple made me interested even more.I guess all I can say about this movies is that its alot like the movie ""Asteroid"" but the main characters are portrayed gay instead of str8.  Scientist gets ignored and she finds someone else to help her with finding a solution.  But what I likes about it is the characters are portrayed gay and I like that.  So I watched this movie and bought it as soon as I finished.It helps that the main character is Antonio Sabato Jr. (He's hott) and Rae Dawn Chong (New to me but he's FINE!)A movie I would recommend to watch if your into military guys and some romance along the way.
