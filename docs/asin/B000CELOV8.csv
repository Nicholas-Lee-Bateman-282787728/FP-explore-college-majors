957504,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000CELOV8,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","In the first full season of the series, fireman-paramedics Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) find themselves faced with a variety of challenges that range from an accusation that they stole $700 from the wallet of an unconscious patient to the problem of extracting a nun and several children from a bus that has gone over the side of a cliff to a ""cooking-challenged"" woman who keeps having silly accidents.  There's always plenty of suspense--medical and otherwise--in these episodes, and humor too, often at the expense of Johnny, who sweats his way through an IRS audit and spars with mustachioed joker Chet Kelly at every turn.  We also learn that Johnny is at least part Indian and was ""raised on a ranch"" and spent a lot of time on the Reservation.  Meanwhile Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller) has become a passionate advocate for the paramedic system and a staunch ally to the guys when they're in trouble.  As Roy and Johnny ""rescue the perishing,"" Brackett and his team, headed by Nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) and Dr. Joe Early (Bobby Troup), cope with problems of their own, ranging from a man with an array of puzzling symptoms to an explosion and fire in a detached wing of their hospital.  Episodes not infrequently have a topical bent, as when a rather stridently liberationist female reporter comes to the station to follow its personnel through a typical day and immediately makes herself unpopular.  Guest stars range from Dick Van Patten to Jophn Travolta, the latter in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role as a downed hiker.

957509,A3W3X1WBBY6I6B,B000CELOV8,D. Fadden,"[2, 2]","There are so many shows I loved as a kid.  I have revisited many of these shows years later and found myself scratching my head in dismay that I could have EVER actually liked that!Then you have EMERGENCY!I was in grade school when I loved this show.  I watched it religiously.  Now fast forward 40 years into the future.  I haven't watched EMERGENCY since the 1970's when it first came out.  I have forgotten all the episodes and story lines.  It's like I'm watching them all again for the first time.I was a big fan of ER.  You would think after ER with all its quality and realism, EMERGENCY, a spin-off show from ADAM 12 (Remember THAT???) wouldn't even remotely compare.  That's what I thought.Ok, granted, the show is dated.  You can't get around this fact.  There were no computers then, or cell phones.  Digital did not exist.  Everything takes longer.  Even the phones are DIAL phones, not even the button variety.  The cars all look like boats--it's laughable.  The first season the ambulances look like white hearses.  The hair styles...everyone looks like they just emerged from a hair salon--the men too.  The nurses are all female with the funny paper hats, and most of them obviously wearing false eyelashes.  There is no swearing.  In the first season not one single person dies.  The dialog is laughable in some places.  And yet....One thing that's cool about EMERGENCY--you're looking at real fires.  Some of the scenes are actually quite amazing when you consider when this show was filmed.  EMERGENCY simply WAS the &#34;ER&#34; of its day.  It was the best television could offer, and in my view, ahead of its time.By Season Two we see a bit more modern style vehicles.  The ambulances look more like they do today, and so do the fire trucks.  But people die sometimes.  You have that little bit of added realism.Strengths that carry through every season I've watches so far-- EMERGENCY is character driven.  I defy anyone to try to watch this show and not fall in love with firemen paramedics Johnny and Roy, or laugh at Chet Desoto's practical jokes, or feel along with the head nurse Dixey.McCall.ER was great, but EMERGENCY did it first.  ER probably wouldn't have been what it was without this founding show which demonstrates the importance of strong, multi-faceted, FEELING characters.You will be transported back in time in EMERGENCY.  After you get through Season Two you will be used to the outdated styles of clothing, cars, technology and mentality.  In a way Emergency is a time capsule in that respect.  The 1970's get to live again.  And though every now and then you'll be brought up short (when it comes to the attitudes/portrayal of women back then especially), much of the time you will forget the outdatedness of the show because you will be so caught up in the STORY.I am again, to Season Four and so far not one story hasn't been exciting, funny, interesting, moving.  EMERGENCY has still got it.  If you loved ER, you need to experience this show that came first.As for the quality of the DVDs--they are bar none.  I feel, for the most part, like I'm watching them new again on TV.  Season two, if I recall, has one episode that suffered a little deterioration in its quality--but that was the one exception I have seen so far.Very HIGHLY recommend.  I'm still a big fan of this show.  I'm guessing now I'll always be.",5,Excellent Show ENDURES!,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,3362,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'loved', 'kid', 'have', 'revisited', 'many', 'shows', 'years', 'later', 'found', 'scratching', 'head', 'dismay', 'could', 'have', 'EVER', 'actually', 'liked', 'Then', 'have', 'EMERGENCY', 'was', 'grade', 'school', 'when', 'loved', 'show', 'watched', 'religiously', 'Now', 'fast', 'forward', '40', 'years', 'future', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'EMERGENCY', '1970', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'have', 'forgotten', 'episodes', 'story', 'lines', ""'m"", 'watching', 'again', 'first', 'time.I', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'ER', 'would', 'think', 'ER', 'quality', 'realism', 'EMERGENCY', 'spin-off', 'show', 'ADAM', '12', 'Remember', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'compare', 'what', 'thought.Ok', 'granted', 'show', 'dated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'were', 'computers', 'then', 'cell', 'phones', 'Digital', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Everything', 'longer', 'Even', 'phones', 'are', 'DIAL', 'phones', 'not', 'even', 'button', 'variety', 'cars', 'look', 'boats', 'laughable', 'first', 'season', 'ambulances', 'look', 'white', 'hearses', 'hair', 'styles', 'everyone', 'just', 'emerged', 'hair', 'salon', 'men', 'too', 'nurses', 'are', 'female', 'funny', 'paper', 'hats', 'most', 'obviously', 'wearing', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'swearing', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'person', 'dies', 'dialog', 'laughable', 'places', 'yet', '.One', 'thing', 'cool', 'EMERGENCY', ""'re"", 'looking', 'real', 'fires', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'amazing', 'when', 'consider', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'EMERGENCY', 'simply', 'WAS', '34', 'ER', '34', 'day', 'was', 'best', 'television', 'could', 'offer', 'view', 'ahead', 'time.By', 'Season', 'Two', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'modern', 'style', 'vehicles', 'ambulances', 'look', 'more', 'do', 'today', 'so', 'do', 'fire', 'trucks', 'people', 'die', 'sometimes', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'added', 'realism.Strengths', 'carry', 'season', ""'ve"", 'watches', 'so', 'far', 'EMERGENCY', 'character', 'driven', 'defy', 'anyone', 'try', 'watch', 'show', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'firemen', 'paramedics', 'Johnny', 'Roy', 'laugh', 'Chet', 'Desoto', 'practical', 'jokes', 'feel', 'head', 'nurse', 'Dixey.McCall.ER', 'was', 'great', 'EMERGENCY', 'did', 'first', 'ER', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'what', 'was', 'founding', 'show', 'importance', 'strong', 'multi-faceted', 'FEELING', 'characters.You', 'will', 'be', 'transported', 'back', 'time', 'EMERGENCY', 'get', 'Season', 'Two', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'outdated', 'styles', 'clothing', 'cars', 'technology', 'mentality', 'way', 'Emergency', 'time', 'capsule', 'respect', '1970', 'get', 'live', 'again', 'now', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'short', 'when', 'attitudes/portrayal', 'women', 'back', 'then', 'especially', 'much', 'time', 'will', 'forget', 'outdatedness', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'STORY.I', 'am', 'again', 'Season', 'Four', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'one', 'story', ""n't"", 'been', 'exciting', 'funny', 'interesting', 'moving', 'EMERGENCY', 'still', 'got', 'loved', 'ER', 'need', 'experience', 'show', 'came', 'first.As', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'are', 'bar', 'none', 'feel', 'most', 'part', ""'m"", 'watching', 'new', 'again', 'TV', 'Season', 'two', 'recall', 'one', 'episode', 'suffered', 'little', 'deterioration', 'quality', 'was', 'one', 'exception', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far.Very', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'still', 'big', 'fan', 'show', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'now', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be']",Emergency!

957511,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B000CELOV8,Eric Mayforth,"[0, 0]","""Emergency!"" appeared on Saturday nights on NBC for much of the 1970s, and this DVD set contains the 21 episodes that were originally aired from September 1972 to April 1973 during Season Two.The series follows Los Angeles Squad 51 firefighters John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy Desoto (Kevin Tighe), as well as nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) and doctors Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller) and Joe Early (Bobby Troup).  The five are called upon to handle a wide range of emergency situations over the course of the season.A comment in one of the episodes suggests that paramedics were not widely respected then, but this show demonstrated to the country just how skilled EMT workers are and the wide range of skills that they have.  The show also offered a couple of gentle safety tips for everyday situations without being preachy, and shows how much that doctors, nurses, and paramedics accomplished with the relatively primitive equipment available nearly 40 years ago.The show attempted to show just how hectic the paramedics' job can be--it tried to portray real life in that they usually had to make multiple emergency runs per episode.  Being a paramedic is a stressful job that involves some ethical decisions, and the characters are shown to struggle with wondering whether they did the right thing and made the right call.

And, wow, John Travolta as a teen, Deidre Hall (""Days of Our Lives"") as a nurse, and the cameos keep coming!  Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe click as firefighters/paramedics (and as what could be construed as one of TV's earliest bromances), as well as the rest of the cast, and they make you care about them and their extraordinary day-to-day lives.

957538,AFJ6ZVBQG4LRK,B000CELOV8,Too Cold in Madison,"[4, 5]","5 stars for the show; 1 star for Universal's disc quality = 3 stars for this set.I loved this show when I watched it on a B&W; (my parents didn't get color until about 1980) TV as a 12 y/o. I still enjoy it today. It's proof that entertainment doesn't have to be profane and sexual to be thoroughly entertaining. It's amazing how far we've sunk in 30 year.Unfortunately, this set suffers from poor Universal DVD quality. I've yet to meet a Universal TV DVD set in which all of the discs worked properly. Two of my three discs show no visible defects, but hack up in the middle in most machines. Interestingly, only my laptop computer's DVD player can handle them. I've tried them in several others and they hack up in the same place. It's some sort of very tiny defect that is not visible to my 47 y/o presbyopic eyes.",3,Great Show!
