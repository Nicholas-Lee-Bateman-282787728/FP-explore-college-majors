337918,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,6302814715,Anton Ilinski,"[1, 11]","Although I knew this movie might not fit my expectations, I still ordered all three parts in a box from British amazon, much because of its cult status among horror fans. Actually I wanted to watch this since I was a boy. And I was right as well as many reviewers (I mean about expectations) - ""It's Alive"" appeared to be rather boring and not scary at all. The only pluses I saw in it are great work by John P. Ryan (I always adored him) and that nostalgic feeling I got while watching. And by nostalgic I mean the epoch of 70s itself shown in the film, and the way movie was shot. Nowdays we used to see monsters from the first minutes on screen, and in ""It's Alive"" we get to see the evil baby just closer to the end.Anyway I think the film lacks some brutality and real horror, maybe they'll come up with something more infernal in the sequel which is being planned, as I heard.But in general ""It's Alive"" is quite OK for a low budget movie that doesn't claim to be a masterpiece of horror genre. Buy it if you like old cheesy horror films, especially those which became legends a long time ago.",2,"THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DAVIS BABY, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WITH THE FILM ITSELF",1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,1099,"['knew', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'fit', 'expectations', 'still', 'ordered', 'three', 'parts', 'box', 'British', 'amazon', 'much', 'cult', 'status', 'horror', 'fans', 'Actually', 'wanted', 'watch', 'was', 'boy', 'was', 'right', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'reviewers', 'mean', 'expectations', 'Alive', 'appeared', 'be', 'rather', 'boring', 'not', 'scary', 'only', 'saw', 'are', 'great', 'work', 'John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'always', 'adored', 'nostalgic', 'feeling', 'got', 'watching', 'nostalgic', 'mean', 'epoch', '70s', 'shown', 'film', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'used', 'see', 'monsters', 'first', 'minutes', 'screen', 'Alive', 'get', 'see', 'evil', 'baby', 'just', 'closer', 'end.Anyway', 'think', 'film', 'brutality', 'real', 'horror', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'come', 'up', 'something', 'more', 'infernal', 'sequel', 'being', 'planned', 'heard.But', 'general', 'Alive', 'quite', 'OK', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'horror', 'genre', 'Buy', 'like', 'old', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'films', 'especially', 'became', 'long', 'time', 'ago']",N/A

Little baby Davis (at a whopping 11-12 pounds) enters the world with a bit of a bang, slaughtering the roomful of doctors and nurses unlucky enough to witness it's arrival! Now on the loose, the cuddly mutant proceeds to attack anyone who gets too close. The famous milkman scene is a grabber. Just watch as the poor milkman is pulled through the back of his truck like a log in a mulcher (with only a minimal amount of gore, as it's mostly in our heads)! Soon, the entire LA police force is on the trail of our bouncing baby beasty. Lenore goes a bit nutty (who wouldn't?), while Frank grows increasingly hardened toward the whole bloody mess. Of course, the drug company that fears they may have been the cause of baby Davis' condition want it destroyed, in order to avoid any implications. Frank is horrified to find that Lenore has let junior in the house and fed it a freezer-ful of food! This leads to the climax in the Los Angeles sewer system.

Ryan, Sharon Farrell, James Dixon, William Wellman Jr., Shamus Locke, Andrew Duggan, Guy Stockwell, Michael AnsaraP: A mutated infant goes on a rampant killing spree. At first, the baby's father is against it, but finds his fatherly instincts taking over to protect it as the police zero in.Larry Cohen's monster themed movie, It's Alive, not only delivers the thrills and chills requisite of this sub-genre, but it also manages to bring forth a biting social commentary about environmental poisoning and a spot on depiction about the anxieties of parenthood.It's Alive would go on to become a cult classic and showcased Larry Cohen's ability to take universal truths/fears or things that were going on at the moment and give them a horror like spin. What I admire about his work was that Cohen found a way to work within the horror realm without letting his messages or commentary become too overly preachy or melodramatic. He found a way to fuse the two together and make them work together harmoniously.His work was cutting edge and ahead of its time, though his films were very much of their time. Often, he wasn't given the budgets he needed to give his films a certain level of polish and professionalism. The puppetry and special effects present in It's Alive are below average, but I don't go into films looking for special effects. I want to watch films that are going to challenge me, intrigue me. I want to see something that is bold and daring. Some might try to dismiss It's Alive as schlock, but for those willing to look beneath the surface, It's Alive is a smart, intelligent film with something to say.

Let's face it, once the cord is cut, you're out there, for better or worse...now usually things settle after the birth, as babies settle into a regular routine of sleeping, crying, drooling, eating, and messing their pants, allowing for those that brought them into this world to take care of all their needs, as they're are totally helpless and completely dependant on the kindness of others...right?  That's pretty much what I thought, and so did Mr. And Mrs. Davis...but we were both wrong....so very wrong...It's Alive (1974), not to be confused with the dreadful 1969 Larry Buchanan made for TV movie of the same name, was written and directed by the extremely multi-faceted schlock auteur Larry Cohen, who's had some recent successes with stories produced into the films Phone Booth (2002), Cellular (2004), and Captivity, scheduled for 2004, but will probably see a release in '05.  It's Alive stars John P. Ryan (Class of 1999) and Sharon Farrell (Night of the Comet).  Also appearing is William Wellman Jr. (The Puppet Masters), James Dixon (Q: The Winged Serpent), and Andrew Duggan (Bone).Frank (Ryan) and Lenore (Farrell) Davis are expecting a baby...and now it's hospital time as the birth is nearing.  Things appear normal, but difficulties arise as the doctor estimates the bambino a whopping 11 pounds (ouch!)...what they don't know (at least until it's born), is that, not only is this one big baby, but it has some unusual features, like extended fangs, claws, and a humongoid head, along with the creepiest eyes I've seen this side of Bette Davis.  Oh yeah, it also possesses a thirst for flesh and is extremely mobile, which is evident as it kills all those within the delivery room (except Lenore) in short order and then runs off (what a lil' rascal), escaping by breaking through a skylight, leaving no witnesses and everyone wondering just what the heck happened (Lenore is no help, claiming she was out of it the whole time).  The answers do not come quickly, but the bodies sure do, as brutally mutated victims begin popping up in the surrounding community and the Davis' gain unwanted notoriety as the couple that spawned a killer freak.  The police soon begin a manhunt (or, infanthunt, to be more accurate...well, to be completely accurate, I'd call it a freakymonsterbabyhunt, but that's a mouthful), as no one knows where the terrifying tot will strike next, or what its' motivations are...at least those past its' seemingly insatiable hunger...for HUMAN FLESH!It's Alive is probably one of the best exploitation films I've seen come from the 70's.  It's listed as a horror film, but viewers expecting over-the-top gore will be sorely disappointed.  Instead, what Larry Cohen brings forth is a sort of realistic drama/thriller, one that features a freakish, mutant cannibal baby...no easy feat, I'll tell you what.  As with his 1982 film Q (it's about a giant winged serpent terrorizing New York), the characters presented are infused with a perceived sense of realism, like these are people you might or could know, people who actually reside in the same world as you.  Sure, there's that completely unrealistic element of the hideous mutant cannibal baby, but when the two are combined, Cohen creates a story that almost exists beyond the screen, and will causes the hair on the back of your neck to continue standing long after the movie is over.  Some will feel the pacing is too slow, extended periods where nothing happens, but I felt this was deliberate, as to not only allow for the tension to build, but also to focus on the development of the characters, the main ones, finding themselves having to deal with this completely unique and terrifying experience, along with incorporating various other aspects involving local law enforcement, the medical establishment, and the pharmaceutical industry (it's thought maybe the child was a result of long term usage of a certain medication) and their own, particular views and opinions of the situation.  I thought John P. Ryan was really good as the distraught father, living in denial.  His character actually scared me almost more than the creature, as he appeared to me as a pot always on the verge of boiling over, or a taught piece of twine near its' snapping point.  He's got serious anger management issues (don't tell him I said that).  I also thought Sharon Farrell did well, the mother suffering from a sort of post-partum depression of not only the birth, but of her now on-the-lam child, filling her time with meaningless tasks avoiding the horror of her birthing of a mutant, but also the very real possibility that it will soon be dispatched by local law enforcement, or her husband, as his abject rejection of the abomination along with his anger management issues forces him to take matters into his own hands.  One thing you'll notice about Cohen films is they often look like they're made on a low budget, but I think, while he may not have the money of others, he makes the most of what he has, often filming on location, adding to the overall sense of reality...think Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets (1973) or Frank Henenlotter's Basket Case (1982)...and the musical scoring by the legendary Bernard Herrmann adds so much.  The effects aren't great, but they are notable as an early work of special effects master Rick Baker.I thought the widescreen picture looked pretty good here (much better than the VHS copy I had), although I thought the audio a bit soft.  Special features include a commentary track by Larry Cohen and a trailer for this film along with the sequels, It Lives Again (1978) and It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (1987), both also available on DVD.Cookieman108",4,It's newborn.

I was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn.  The baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum.  The pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn't stand up that well today.  The actors who took part in this didn't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel.  Why there was a sequel is beyond me.

337926,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,6302814715,General Zombie,"[7, 8]","I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The relatively mixed reviews did a good job of lowering my expectations.  What I realize now, which I hadn't then, is that 'It's Alive' is a film that is prominent enough and strange enough that it's more likely to draw the attention of non-horror buffs.  So when I hear this being accused of being cheap and incompetent, what I'm thinking is a lot different from what the writer likely is.  Sure, this film is cheap, but as far as low-budget 70's horror goes this is fairly sharp and professional, and stands alongside most of the 'Classic' films of the era fairly nicely.  (And it is, technically, definitely a cut above a few of them, such as 'The Last House on the Left' and 'Shivers'.)  It's an odd film though, in execution, in that it takes an extremely odd, outrageous premise and creates a relatively uneventful, low-key film.  If you're looking to see a film with a whole lotta baby combat you're probably gonna be disappointed.  It's got some of that, no doubt, but the film is more interested in the infant's family.  Of all the 70's cult horror films I've seen, `It's Alive' is unquestionably the one that is most interested in the people in the film.  Needless to say, that isn't going to be to everyone's taste, but it worked for me.Technically this film is competent, though it does have a few particularly rough edits.  The acting isn't great, but it's perhaps above average for this sorta film, with out a single stunningly bad performance.  Special note goes to John Ryan as Frank Davis.  His stoicism could be interpreted as simply wooden acting, but however you take it it fits the role well enough.  Again, the film is mostly about how the baby's rampage effects him, so you need to like and be interested in the guy, and I was.  He's just got a good, sad face that naturally fits the emotions of the film.  The score is by Bernard Hermann, so you get something that is quite a bit more lush and dramatic then you'd usually find in cult horror.  The oft-repetitious score occasionally gets on my nerves, but it's works alright in general and gives the whole thing an added air of class and professionalism.Shots of the baby are wisely kept to a minimum, and the thing looks alright.  Better than I would've thought.  The baby murder scenes are competently done as well, with some amusing baby-cam.  The film isn't scary, but it manages to be fairly serious, far moreso than I would've imagined.  The murder of the milkman is especially well done, as is the aftermath of the infants opening rampage.  Despite the premise I never laughed at the movie, which is an impressive feat, and intentional humor is kept to a minimum, which is nice as it would be very tempting to turn such a film into a horror-comedy.  It does have *some* humor in it, yes, but not a ton, and certainly not enough to move into horror-comedy territory.The film is pretty slow, I'll admit, but I was interested enough in  what was going on with the Davis family that I didn't mind, and it all comes to a fairly effective climax.  The later scenes, where the baby returns to the Davis house and Frank searches all around for it are surprisingly tense, and the final confrontation out in the city is, yes, touching.  More than a few movies out there have tried to make you sympathize with the monster, but none does a better job than 'It's Alive'.I must also note that the box art is awesome.  I remember seeing that in the video store as a little kid, and it is indelibly imprinted on my mind. (Same goes for the 'Deepstar Six' box.  I gotta see that movie someday, though I assume that it sucks.)  It's also got perhaps the most awesome tagline ever: 'There's only one thing wrong with the Davis baby... It's Alive!'.

337930,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6302814715,Jeffrey Leach,"[0, 0]","You gotta hand it to Larry Cohen. If you don't know who he is, he's the chap responsible for some of the more ludicrous horror and exploitation films made in the last thirty or so years. You probably heard about a little film called ""The Stuff"" where a greedy corporation markets a mysterious organic substance as the latest low fat sensation only to discover later that the tasty snack turns people into gelatinous mounds of goo. What, you never heard about it? O.k., then you at least know a thing or two about ""God Told Me To,"" a strange movie that takes as its starting point a string of grisly murders but ends up morphing into your run of the mill alien abduction/return of the Son of God picture. No way! You aren't familiar with this film either? Don't tell me you've spent most of your life working, taking care of your kids, or other such meaningless activities? You're starting to make me angry. Do you mean to tell me you never heard about any of these classic schlock films? Pathetic. Well, it's off to your room with a copy of Cohen's classic ""It's Alive."" That will teach you to defy cult filmdom!Ahhh, the total cheesefest that constitutes ""It's Alive."" You haven't lived until you've witnessed this greasy little shocker. The film tells the story of Frank and Lenore Davies (John P. Ryan and Sharon Farrell respectively) and their heartfelt attempt to have a second child. Their first son Chris (Daniel Holzman) turned out normal, but something tells us right from the start that we ought to fear the bundle currently baking in Lenore's oven. First, the fetus appears larger than normal. Second, when Lenore goes into labor pains in the middle of the night, her agony seems extreme. Third, while Frank sits around in the waiting room with the other soon to be fathers, we hear a lot of talk about pollution and pesticides. And since the story takes place in good old Los Angeles in the 1970s, you just know the pollution levels are through the roof. Fourth, and finally, we learn something is seriously amiss when Lenore finally gives birth to a creature that promptly rips and tears its way through the operating room like a mini-tornado. By the time the concerned Frank races into the OR, he discovers the doctors and nurses stretched out on the floor in pools of blood and the baby long gone. Yikes! Something ain't right here! Of course it isn't--this is a Larry Cohen film!Incredibly the baby manages to survive out in the wilds of California while the authorities, led by the caring yet tough as nails Lieutenant Perkins (James Dixon), form posses of uniformed cops to hunt the monster down. It's definitely shoot to kill time in the City of Angels since this terrible tot slaughters anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path. A milkman, a harridan arriving home from a long night of work--these people and several others learn too late about this devil's spawn thirst for blood. In between quick scenes of the kid wreaking havoc, the movie focuses in on Frank's inability to cope with the reality of this evil baby. He distances himself from his mentally fractured wife, must learn to cope with scientists turning up on doorstep seeking ownership of the child for ""research"" purposes, and has a big problem dealing with the fact that he helped create such a terrible monstrosity. He's so disgusted with the perceived flaw in his manhood that he wants the child to die, and he offers his assistance to Lieutenant Perkins in this capacity. But something is happening about which Frank is unaware, namely that the child is homing in on his family like some sort of grotesque carrier pigeon. When the inevitable reunion occurs, will Frank have the strength to put his own son down for the count, even a son this monstrously hideous? Could you?Schlock, schlock, schlock! Cohen outdoes himself with this downbeat piece of B-budget sleaze, which went on to spawn two sequels. ""It's Alive"" is the most serious entry, however, in that the film's primary focus has little to do with blood and guts. Sure, we get a few splashes of blood from time to time, blood that looks like red paint, and the glimpses we see of the child reveal a creature that looks like a pint sized demon from the lower reaches of Hades, but the 'PG' rating (!) ensures a minimal display of sauce. Cohen is far more interested in presenting a film of emotional and psychological terror, a movie that tries to place the viewer in the mindset of Frank and Sharon Davies. How would we react if our child resembled a freakish mutation capable of murder? Most of us would probably end up somewhere in the neighborhood of Frank and Sharon. Poor old Frank. He walks around like he's in an emotional coma after the kid is born, sweating and fretting as he tries to deal with the maelstrom of sensations swirling around in his head. His extremely fragile mental state, as much if not more fragile than that of his wife, makes his sudden conversion at the conclusion of the film even more dramatic. It also makes it somewhat unbelievable.I'm not sure what Cohen tried to say here. Pollution is bad? If so, why doesn't the film examine that except in passing? We should love our children no matter what? Well, that's fairly obvious. Sadly, the commentary track included as an extra on the disc fails to provide any significant insight into what Larry tried to accomplish here. He's far more interested in how much money the film made and how much of a profit he turned on his New York brownstone. You ought to watch the film if you love exploitation, but it's not gory and the script doesn't examine in-depth many of the questions it raises.",3,It's alive and it wants to eat you!,1123200000,"08

The theme Cohen plays with is less a &quot;monster on the loose&quot; picture than one in which the very human parents are forced to confront the ugly consequences in which society, and particularly the media, want only to feed on and exploit the pain of individuals thrust into a situation beyond their immediate comprehension or control. Farrell, (understandably) close to the edge of insanity, still maintains a mother's love for her child - no matter what it might look or behave like. Ryan, seeing this as a slam against his manhood, simply refuses to accept that this &quot;child&quot; is anything that he could have fathered. The film also raises dark questions concerning the pharmaceutical industry's cynical promotion of birth-control drugs and their side-effects, as well as a speculating on the effect pollutants in the air and water might have on our bodies. (A theme revisited by director Phillip Kaufmann in the 1978 version of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;).Unfortunately, these themes are a bit hamstrung by Larry Cohen's flat-footed direction; there are some great, and funny scenes to be sure (the milkman comes to mind), but the film is unsure whether it wants to be a social satire or a real horror film. Ironically, it ends up being neither; the &quot;Davis baby&quot; actually emerges as a truly tragic figure, crawling up alongside King Kong and Frankenstein's monster (who Ryan's character makes reference to in the film) as a poor creature unwittingly thrown into the harsh world of mankind, which always fears and hates what it doesn't understand.Flaws aside, this is still a great example of how far out (and how much sick fun) horror films of the '70's could be. Even though this was distributed by a major studio (Warner Bros.), this was essentially a low-budget independent film. The &quot;baby&quot; was created by the brilliant,  multiple Oscar-winning makeup artist Rick Baker. At the time the film was made, the &quot;baby&quot; puppet didn't permit (nor did the budget) any of the cable-control mechanisms inside to create movement, as Baker and his crew would later use to great effect on &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; and &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;. Still, few could argue that the &quot;Davis baby&quot; is one of the wildest and most bizarre characters ever to emerge from '70's horror films.Highly dated, but still recommended nonetheless!",4,&quot;What's wrong with my baby!!?&quot;,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,2810,"['One', 'great', 'cult', 'films', ""'70"", 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'quot', 'Alive', 'quot', 'horror', 'film', 'psychological', 'drama', 'smartly', 'focusing', 'emotional', 'devastation', 'wrought', 'marriage', 'parents', 'Frank', 'Leonor', 'Davis', 'well', 'played', 'John', 'Ryan', 'Sharon', 'Farrell', 'lesser', 'extent', 'existing', 'eleven-year-old', 'son', 'Chris', 'theme', 'Cohen', 'less', 'quot', 'monster', 'loose', 'quot', 'picture', 'one', 'very', 'human', 'parents', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'ugly', 'consequences', 'society', 'particularly', 'media', 'want', 'only', 'feed', 'exploit', 'pain', 'individuals', 'thrust', 'situation', 'immediate', 'comprehension', 'control', 'Farrell', 'understandably', 'close', 'edge', 'insanity', 'still', 'mother', 'love', 'child', 'matter', 'what', 'might', 'look', 'behave', 'Ryan', 'seeing', 'slam', 'manhood', 'simply', 'accept', 'quot', 'child', 'quot', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'fathered', 'film', 'also', 'dark', 'questions', 'concerning', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'cynical', 'promotion', 'birth-control', 'drugs', 'side-effects', 'as', 'well', 'speculating', 'effect', 'pollutants', 'air', 'water', 'might', 'have', 'bodies', 'theme', 'revisited', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Kaufmann', '1978', 'version', 'quot', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'quot', '.Unfortunately', 'themes', 'are', 'bit', 'hamstrung', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'flat-footed', 'direction', 'are', 'great', 'funny', 'scenes', 'be', 'sure', 'milkman', 'mind', 'film', 'unsure', 'be', 'social', 'satire', 'real', 'horror', 'film', 'Ironically', 'up', 'being', 'quot', 'Davis', 'baby', 'quot', 'actually', 'truly', 'tragic', 'figure', 'crawling', 'up', 'alongside', 'King', 'Kong', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'who', 'Ryan', 'character', 'reference', 'film', 'poor', 'creature', 'unwittingly', 'thrown', 'harsh', 'world', 'mankind', 'always', 'fears', 'what', ""n't"", 'understand.Flaws', 'aside', 'still', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'far', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'sick', 'fun', 'horror', 'films', ""'70"", 'could', 'be', 'Even', 'was', 'distributed', 'major', 'studio', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'was', 'essentially', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'created', 'brilliant', 'multiple', 'Oscar-winning', 'makeup', 'artist', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'quot', 'quot', 'puppet', 'did', ""n't"", 'permit', 'did', 'budget', 'cable-control', 'mechanisms', 'create', 'movement', 'Baker', 'crew', 'would', 'later', 'use', 'great', 'effect', 'quot', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'quot', 'quot', 'Harry', 'Hendersons', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', 'quot', 'Still', 'few', 'could', 'argue', 'quot', 'Davis', 'baby', 'quot', 'one', 'wildest', 'most', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'ever', 'emerge', ""'70"", 'horror', 'films.Highly', 'dated', 'still', 'recommended', 'nonetheless']",N/A

I saw this when it was a new release and didn't pay much attention to details like make-up or music credits, but the soundtrack was immediately noticeable.  It just wasn't like other 'B' horror flicks.  The music gave the movie a peculiar aura, a strong sense of dread, one of intense gloom as much as the sense of horror.  It also struck a sense of pity for the parents, the monstrous child too, a stunning disbelief since the cause of all this horror was far beyond what they could understand.  So when I learned that it was no less than Bernard Herrmann who had done the soundtrack I wasn't surprised.  He was a master at film music.

337938,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6302814715,Michael R Gates,"[1, 2]","Prolific cult-flick auteur Larry Cohen delivered one of his first B-grade horror hits with this tale of a mutant baby who goes on a murderous rampage immediately after emerging from the womb of his seemingly normal middle-class mom.  As with all of his genre films, IT'S ALIVE demonstrates Cohen's skill in using the fright format to address important issues.  While not as bitingly satirical as 1985's THE STUFF, Cohen's jab at the marketing and advertising industry, this flick nonetheless offers deep and clever--and still surprisingly germane--comments on unplanned pregnancy, chemical-based birth control, and the negative effects that pollution and environmental toxins may be having on the unborn.Also skillful is Cohen's ability to convey his social message while simultaneously delivering the genre goods to full effect.  The  terrifying titular character seemingly lurks around every corner and generates goosebumps aplenty, yet Cohen actually keeps the bloodthirsty bambino--make-up effects for which were created by Oscar-winning FX man Rick Baker--off camera most of the time, thereby creating suspense and shocks that make the climactic scenes pay off even better.Some critics have faulted IT'S ALIVE by claiming it's an insult to audience intelligence in asking viewers to accept the idea of such a nefariously necrotic neonate.  But genuine genre fans will dismiss this criticism in light of the long tradition of murderous moppets in the movies, a tradition that includes classics such as VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960), ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968), THE EXORCIST (1973), and THE OMEN (1976), to name just a few.All in all, IT'S ALIVE is a worthy genre entry that will delight horror fans and Cohen fans alike.

337941,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6302814715,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","Killer babies rule, or at least that was the mindset of the late seventies. Evil children decorated the screen with such hits as Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, some being decent while others sunk like the crud they were. Roger Cohen was no stranger to B pictures and saw the opening to make something that would get noticed - strangely, It's Alive became one of his more successful productions. Despite it's cheesy premise and campy advertising slogan, the theme of the movie was close to the hearts of many, exploring social commentary with a dark twist, somber tones, and with surprisingly apt psychological depth.Frank and Lenore seem like boring folk, but they were the average couple. They were blessed with a young son who looked clean cut and acted well-mannered; Frank held a posh job at a local advertising firm; and Lenore was pregnant with their second baby. The film starts immediately with her labor - why the hell do babies only come in the middle of the night?? - and then proceeds on to the hospital where Lenore anxiously gets Frank to reassure that it's all right, that it's ok for her to have this baby. There is a minor touching scene where she inquires on it being a burden to him, something he's keeping to himself and not telling her, how she feels a bit of guilt and anxiety.A very good touch to the movie, especially considering how things turned out. I'm sick of seeing all this Disney type shit on TV surrounding childbirth, pregnancy, and newborns. Down the Brady Bunch families that make men and women feel guilty if they don't feel the same way. Here we witness a very realistic sort of dialogue exchange that touched me in a deep way. Even if it was just a minor gesture, it spoke volumes. Anyway, the baby is born but the viewer doesn't see him till later. All the viewer sees is dear old Frank frantically rushing to the emergency room when screaming is heard and someone stumbles out of the door and drops dead. He claws his way into the delivery room to see his wife, strapped the table, screaming about her baby, incoherent. There is blood everywhere, bodies, and no infant in sight. He's forcefully removed by two nurses - or security people - or who really cares? - and this is where the real nightmare begins.The police and everyone know it WAS the baby, they just don't know why - or even how. They only know there's a deranged infant crawling around that rips out  human throats and bites into their flesh like butter. Frank angrily rejects all tests to see if there's something wrong with his genes. It's brought up that they had considered an abortion early on in the pregnancy, but decided against it. The audience gets the idea from Frank's defensiveness that it had been his idea.It's Alive is classic Cohen; no one does it the way he did. His monster craze is something to be celebrated; here we have an over the top premise delivered in a way that demands attention. The more interesting thing is not the baby's vicious antics, but rather the study of the parents. Frank and Lenore both feel guilt, as is classic with parents of a deformed child. Frank coldly claims that he doesn't care if the baby is killed, saying the baby has nothing to do with him, that he is normal.

It forgives, it forgets, it lives!Review: a little while ago, around the year of 2007, before the remake was on the market, I heard about this movie that made woman not want to give birth and I was very confused since the title of this movie wasn't something like ""Killer Baby"" but then I saw the art work and new immediately what it was about... the movie was very unique and creepy, it had elements of atmosphere I have never experienced before! I immediately bought the 3 movie pack with three parts of these flicks! They were all amazing in there own way! I felt so sad throughout as I couldn't imagine what the family must've gone through even if this movie is a fake it still felt pretty real to me mostly by the dialogue and performances!Acting: John P. Ryan is amazing in this movie.... it has all the elements of a good acted movie and creates a perfect environment for the characters to be stressed in!Gore: Ripped throats, blood splatter, it truly wasn't that gory but for the time period being 1974 and all... it was downright nasty!Bottom Line: It works on every level no matter how crazy it sounds!

337945,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6302814715,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","In ""celebration"" of the Halloween spirit, my wife and I watched a couple of old horror flicks in recent days.  As a lark, one of our selections was Larry Cohen's IT'S ALIVE.  I had not seen the film in about 20 years, and I knew perfectly well it was not exactly a class act.  But I was looking for modest, guilty-pleasure diversion.It was a diversion, but not altogether a pleasure.  Made in 1973/74, it absolutely REEKS of the sensibilities of that fashion-challenged time.  Everyone smokes...everywhere.  Bosses still played ""grab a**"" with their secretaries.  Fabrics, carpets, cars and curtains were all shades of brown (""earth tones"").  Everyone drank hard liquor.  If the TV series MAD MEN slavishly recreates the feel of the early `60s...IT'S ALIVE actually gives a somewhat convincing idea of what the early `70s were like.  Because not only was it made at that time, but everything was done on such a low budget that little concern was given to making things look nice or glamorous.  It almost feels like the cast was just asked to wear their everyday clothes...and it feels like they just pulled up to some random house in the LA suburbs and asked if they could film there.  It feels decidedly ""TV movie"" in scale...but now, with 35 years of history between the film and today...it also feels authentic in its way.This cultural fascination aside, the film also offers a perfectly simple and silly story.  Frank & Lenore Davis (John Ryan and Sharon Farrell) are a near middle-age, middle class couple with a 12 year old son.  The film literally begins with a pregnant Lenore waking up in the middle of the night to announce ""it's time.""  The couple get up, get dressed, make arrangements for their son, and head to the hospital.  Lenore remarks a couple of times that things ""don't feel the same this time"" in reference to her pregnancy.  Otherwise, the first 15 minutes of the film is almost irredeemably mundane.  We see Frank pacing around in the father's waiting room.  We see Lenore wheeled into delivery.  Just as your eyelids begin to droop, a scream breaks out from down the hall.A ""baby"" of some sort has been born, but this is a baby capable of killing the 5 doctors & nurses who attended its birth.  It's also capable of escaping the hospital on its own.  Throughout the film, we get only the briefest glimpse of this little monster, just before it leaps onto the throat of an unsuspecting person.But much of the film is really about the reaction of the parents to their monster.  It is assumed by the authorities that the beast will simply be killed.  Frank is all for this idea...he constantly insists that this baby ""isn't mine.""  Lenore, who understandably is a little nuts at this point from the sedatives and her own dismay at giving birth to a serial killer, mostly wanders around her house in a nightgown, saying weird things to her husband, such as suggesting they ""try again"" to have a baby.Eventually, the baby finds its way home, and the dynamics of the movie actually take on a few surprising twists that I won't reveal.  It's not exactly earth-shaking stuff...but it does show that creator Cohen was actually interested in making some sort of psychological or sociological point.Early in the film, one of the waiting fathers talks about how the smog in LA is so bad, and how many bad things are in the air.  Later, Frank tells a detective that he and his wife had considered an abortion early on, and he says ""Doesn't everyone talk about it these days?""  And Frank also has to deal with a hostile press and a smarmy boss who shows sympathy on one hand, yet maneuvers Frank out of his job on another.  I say all this as my way of stating that Cohen appeared to be making an attempt to comment on the baby/creature as an non-surprising ""offspring"" of our society.In no way is the point made successfully, but I have to reluctantly give the movie some credit for trying to inject some brains into what is mostly a laughably simplistic horror tale.Most of the performances are substandard.  No one is particularly horrible, but no one convinces either.  The lead detective feels nothing like a cop.  A researcher does not come across like a scientist at all.  Frank's boss is a playboy wanna-be who doesn't feel like a guy who has ever spent a single day in an office.  Etc. etc.  (Particularly laughable are all the extras playing uniformed policeman...walking around slowly in stony silence, shining flashlights everywhere without actually looking at what the light beams reveal.)In the midst of all this is the performance of John Ryan.  He was a character actor that showed up a lot in cheapie flicks like this in the 70s and `80s.  (He was actually quite effective as the insane warden in RUNAWAY TRAIN.)  This part was a rare lead role for him.  And he clearly relished it, and he gives a performance that sort of dances to its own tune, if you will.  He infuses Frank with anguished subtext that is never quite coherent.  You can FEEL Ryan working to give a great performance, even though his skills as an actor were not up to the task.  There are flashes of total conviction, followed by scenes in which he mostly stares off into the distance with bug eyes.  His Frank seems to be teetering on insanity...but honestly, it almost feels that way BEFORE the baby is born.This movie is actually rated PG (I guess it would have been ""GP"" back in the day)...and the violence is quite mild by today's standards.  Heck, even the blood is a totally unconvincing light red.  There is not one single genuine moment of fright...but there are a few modestly creepy moments.  And there are just enough surprises, and just enough fascination with the look of 1974 to make IT'S ALIVE worth a look.  Kids and teens of today will be bored right out of their minds...but if you lived during this time and have clear memories of it, I think you might actually be passingly amused.  2.5 stars",3,A fun

Cohen (Air Force One: The Final Mission)'s fourth film is one of the most popular and enduring cult films of all time. It's a touching story about the bond between a father and his psychotic, murderous infant.Frank (The Postman Always Rings Twice's John Ryan) and Lenore (Night of the Comet's Sharon Farrell) Davies are expecting their first child, and as we open, the blessed event is about to take place. When Lenore gives birth, however, the child is deformed. And hungry. And has a thing for human blood. The rest of the film concerns Frank and the police trying to track the infant as it leaves a trail of bodies through suburban Los Angeles.With a Bernard Hermann score and Rick Baker effects, you know this ain't Rosemary's Baby. Cohen was going for the gut from moment one, as usual, and everyone involved in the production was right on board with that idea. This is melodrama with just enough gore to keep seventies-era gorehounds happy. These days, the big plot twist at the end is going to look like a clich&eacute;, but it wasn't all that normal back in the day. (It does, however, reference an obvious film that had been released a few years back; which one will be obvious if you go back and re-read this review so far.)

337947,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,6302814715,Robert J. Schneider,"[9, 9]","Larry Cohen has always had fun making no-frills, slightly creepy &quot;B&quot; Horror movies. As a result, his films tend to be non-cerebral, quirky, violent, cheesy-looking, infectiously funny, and, most of all, fun. It is in this spirit of fun that I write this review for one of Cohen's most memorable and fun films, IT'S ALIVE! (1974).The plot is simple: a relatively normal (though slightly quirky) middle-aged couple with an 11-year-old son, who decided to have one more child, is going through what is obviously a prolonged, painful pregnancy for the expectant soon-to-be-second-time-mother. The Davis family, consisting of Frank (John P. Ryan), Lenore (Sharon Farrell) and Chris (Daniel Holzman) just want to get through it, already. Lenore finally goes into labor one night, and the whole family drives to the hospital, during which time Frank tries to lighten the mood with a little humor.  During the interminable wait in the hospital lobby, Frank overhears two men discussing something about the toxins being released into the environment and how scientists are warning of the possible mutations this could cause for humans. Suddenly, a badly wounded doctor comes stumbling out of the O/R and drops dead on the hallway floor. Frank and the others run into the room to find a scene of sheer horror: five doctors and nurses dead, their throats all torn and bloody. As they stare in shock and amazement, Lenore (who is uninjured) delivers the chilling news: she gave birth to a newborn baby monster. As Frank and the police try to find the Davis' mutated son, who had escaped the hospital through a ventilation shaft, Baby Davis tries to find his way home by himself, dispatching several unaware victims in the process. Frank is torn amongst his feelings of protectiveness for his son, of the sense of duty to snuff out this newborn killer's life, and anger at those he feels are overly anxious to kill him.I have rented this film and seen it on three separate occasions (all on VHS, of course; unfortunately, Warner Brothers has not yet seen fit to issue it on DVD) and it gives me something new to focus on each time.  The first time, it was the visceral violence of the film (it is quite bloody); the second time, it was the sheer campiness of the whole thing. The third time, it was the emotional suffering of Frank Davis, as he tries to simultaneously make sense of the situation, figure out what his newborn monstrosity will do next, and to make it right.Although all of the acting in the film is effective and dependable, none stands out more than John P. Ryan. I love his goofiness at the beginning of the film as he's talking to his &quot;young whipperschnapper&quot; son in a comic Humphrey Bogart-meets-Edward G. Robinson voice. I like the effectiveness of the quiet, tense scene that takes place right after the horrible slaying in the hospital, in which the police try to dance lightly around Frank as they begin to ask him uncomfortable questions at this very awkward time. Frank's foot-shifting, equally uncomfortable responses and increasing agitations hit just the right note, and are a subtle example of great Method Acting. Finally, I like the heartbreakingly somberness of the climactic, and inevitable, final scene.The PG-rating for IT'S ALIVE! remains something of a deceptive mystery; it IS quite bloody, although there isn't much in the way of graphic gore. Still, this got rather strong ratings abroad: According to IMDb, it received a &quot;15&quot; rating in Sweden, an &quot;18&quot; rating in both the U.K. and The Netherlands (the numbers referring to the age at/above to which the film's viewership was restricted), an &quot;R&quot; rating in Australia, and in Finland, it was banned!I know it's cheesy, I know that you hardly see the monster baby (which, given the lack of special effects, was probably a good thing and even added to the suspense), and I know that future multiple-Oscar-winning makeup genius Rick Baker was basically beginning to learn his craft here; the fact is, I find it impossible not to like IT'S ALIVE! If you love those late-night creepy old movies, then you know you will like this too. You've got to admit, you like this kind of stuff--and director Larry Cohen sure makes it fun to watch!RECOMMENDEDHIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF 1970'S FILMS",4,It's a B-Movie Classic!,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,4310,"['Larry', 'Cohen', 'always', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'no-frills', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'quot', 'B', 'quot', 'Horror', 'movies', 'result', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'non-cerebral', 'quirky', 'violent', 'cheesy-looking', 'infectiously', 'funny', 'most', 'fun', 'spirit', 'fun', 'write', 'review', 'one', 'Cohen', 'most', 'memorable', 'fun', 'films', 'IT', 'ALIVE', '1974', '.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'relatively', 'normal', 'slightly', 'quirky', 'middle-aged', 'couple', '11-year-old', 'son', 'who', 'decided', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'child', 'going', 'what', 'obviously', 'prolonged', 'painful', 'pregnancy', 'expectant', 'soon-to-be-second-time-mother', 'Davis', 'family', 'consisting', 'Frank', 'John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'Lenore', 'Sharon', 'Farrell', 'Chris', 'Daniel', 'Holzman', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'already', 'Lenore', 'finally', 'labor', 'one', 'night', 'whole', 'family', 'drives', 'hospital', 'time', 'Frank', 'tries', 'lighten', 'mood', 'little', 'humor', 'interminable', 'wait', 'hospital', 'lobby', 'Frank', 'two', 'men', 'discussing', 'something', 'toxins', 'being', 'released', 'environment', 'how', 'scientists', 'are', 'warning', 'possible', 'mutations', 'could', 'cause', 'humans', 'Suddenly', 'badly', 'wounded', 'doctor', 'stumbling', 'O/R', 'drops', 'dead', 'hallway', 'floor', 'Frank', 'others', 'run', 'room', 'find', 'scene', 'sheer', 'horror', 'five', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'dead', 'throats', 'torn', 'bloody', 'stare', 'shock', 'amazement', 'Lenore', 'who', 'uninjured', 'chilling', 'news', 'gave', 'birth', 'newborn', 'baby', 'monster', 'Frank', 'police', 'try', 'find', 'Davis', 'mutated', 'son', 'who', 'had', 'escaped', 'hospital', 'ventilation', 'shaft', 'Baby', 'Davis', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'dispatching', 'several', 'unaware', 'victims', 'process', 'Frank', 'torn', 'feelings', 'protectiveness', 'son', 'sense', 'duty', 'snuff', 'out', 'newborn', 'killer', 'life', 'anger', 'feels', 'are', 'overly', 'anxious', 'kill', 'him.I', 'have', 'rented', 'film', 'seen', 'three', 'separate', 'occasions', 'VHS', 'course', 'unfortunately', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'fit', 'issue', 'DVD', 'something', 'new', 'focus', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'visceral', 'violence', 'film', 'quite', 'bloody', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'sheer', 'campiness', 'whole', 'thing', 'third', 'time', 'was', 'emotional', 'suffering', 'Frank', 'Davis', 'simultaneously', 'make', 'sense', 'situation', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'newborn', 'monstrosity', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'make', 'acting', 'film', 'effective', 'dependable', 'none', 'out', 'more', 'John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'love', 'goofiness', 'beginning', 'film', 'talking', 'quot', 'young', 'quot', 'son', 'comic', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart-meets-Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'voice', 'effectiveness', 'quiet', 'tense', 'scene', 'place', 'right', 'horrible', 'slaying', 'hospital', 'police', 'try', 'dance', 'lightly', 'around', 'Frank', 'begin', 'ask', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'very', 'awkward', 'time', 'Frank', 'foot-shifting', 'equally', 'uncomfortable', 'responses', 'increasing', 'agitations', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'are', 'subtle', 'example', 'great', 'Method', 'Acting', 'Finally', 'like', 'heartbreakingly', 'somberness', 'climactic', 'inevitable', 'final', 'scene.The', 'PG-rating', 'IT', 'ALIVE', 'something', 'deceptive', 'mystery', 'quite', 'bloody', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'graphic', 'gore', 'Still', 'got', 'rather', 'strong', 'ratings', 'abroad', 'According', 'IMDb', 'received', 'quot', '15', 'quot', 'rating', 'Sweden', 'quot', '18', 'quot', 'rating', 'U.K.', 'Netherlands', 'numbers', 'referring', 'age', 'at/above', 'film', 'viewership', 'was', 'restricted', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'rating', 'Australia', 'Finland', 'was', 'banned', 'know', 'cheesy', 'know', 'hardly', 'see', 'monster', 'baby', 'given', 'lack', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'added', 'suspense', 'know', 'future', 'multiple-Oscar-winning', 'makeup', 'genius', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'was', 'basically', 'beginning', 'learn', 'craft', 'here', 'fact', 'find', 'impossible', 'not', 'IT', 'ALIVE', 'love', 'late-night', 'creepy', 'old', 'movies', 'then', 'know', 'will', 'like', 'too', ""'ve"", 'got', 'admit', 'like', 'kind', 'stuff', 'director', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'sure', 'watch', 'RECOMMENDEDHIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'FOR', 'FANS', '1970', 'FILMS']",N/A

No matter how outlandish the premise of a Cohen film might be, he has a real knack for getting you to least play along, because outside of the fantastic elements, dramatically Cohen's films ring true.I think you could look far and wide in contemporary horror films, before you would find characters this well-drawn, performances as sincere, or social observations as keen as Cohen's. It's Alive perfectly captures the ""everyman for himself "" bad morale and cynicism of the 70's, as the monster-baby's troubled family is both exploited and ostracized. It is absurd, Cohen knows that, yet he plays it with a strait face, never allowing the film to slip into parody. Like George Romero, Cohen is a thinking-mans genre director who isn't afraid to make a ""smart"" horror film, that's still entertaining to watch.This Warner Brother's DVD looks grainy, the color leans to the yellows, and some of the night scenes are bit too dark. This is true of many low-budget 70's films, but I think it could have looked better.
