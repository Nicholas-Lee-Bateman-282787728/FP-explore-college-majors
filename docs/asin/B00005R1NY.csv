It is a wonderful performance, but I can't pretend to be an expert on music, so trust the other reviews.  One tip - some complaints have appeared about the disappointing sound.  My DVD also has that defect on the 5.1 DTS and Dolby 5.1 settings, Belinda's vocals are muddy.  Don't fret - use the 2 channel stereo setting, and all is well.  If your DVD player has equilization settings - look for EQ on your remote - try a setting such as ""live"" or ""rock"".

Considering I only was familiar with three of their songs (""Vacation"", my favorite ""Our Lips Are Sealed"", and of course ""We've Got The Beat""), this was a nice introduction to more of the Go Gos songs, and it did not disappoint.Charlotte, Belinda, Kathy, and Jane all seemed to be having as much fun singing as the audience (and myself) enjoyed listening.  The one drawback to this video:  Gina Shock (the drummer), who I consider the prettiest, did not seem to be enjoying herself.  It may be she was just focusing on her playing instead of smiling, but she looked angry to me.  (Just my personal opinion.)One concern both my wife and I have is the dress (or more specifically the lack thereof) of women in the public eye.  We both were impressed by how modest the women were, especially considering it was taped in 2001.  Kathy Valentine (the bassist) did wear a miniskirt, but that is better than a lot of what one sees nowadays.Let me conclude my review with a warning.

677377,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005R1NY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 8]","I thought ""God Bless the Go-Go's"" was one of the best albums of 2001 and a really great rock `n' roll album.  I thought that Belinda Carlisle had never sounded better, mainly because of the wonderful harmonies provided by Jane Wiedlin.  I thought Charlotte Caffey was continuing to build on the song writing talent she displayed on ""Talk Show"" (and on her one album with the Graces, ""Perfect View"").  Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade were the main producers and mixers on the album and apparently deserve a lot of credit because the Go-Go's never sounded better.  The main reason this concert video of the ""Go-Go's Live in Central park"" is so disappointing is that the sound mix is awful, deplorable, utterly disappointing, and really, really bad.  Slightly better than the rehearsal tapes from the early days that popped up on ""Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's.""  For the most part the instruments overwhelm the vocals from start to finish in this concert.  I have seen several live performances by the Go-Go's over the years, and Belinda Carlisle is never as good on stage as she is in the studio, but she does not even stand a chance on this one.The concert is a mix between the new (seven tracks from the new album) and the requisite hits from yesterday (""Vacation,"" ""We Got the Beat,"" and ""Our Lips Are Sealed"").  The ""Talk Show"" album, which represented the original great leap forward by the band from punk group to pop rockers, is woefully under-represented (""Head Over Heels"" still starts the gig), but that is understandable since the group's previous concert video was for the tour for that album.  Again, the new songs, which rely more on the vocal harmonies (e.g., ""Unforgiven,"" ""Apology""), suffer because of the sound problems.Fortunately the DVD is redeemed, somewhat, by the over 30-minutes of behind-the-scenes footage which show the band getting ready for the gig while their fans get all revved up to party.  The person who ends up impressing you the most in this footage is Gina Schock, not only because she is all business drumming away on stage, but because she emerges as the most articulate member talking about the Go-Go's then and now (ironic, since she is the only one of the group who never sings and remains silent throughout the concert, although she is working seriously on her wad of gum).  Finally, I do want to point out that ""Apology"" is far and away the best song for which Kathy Valentine has ever been listed as lead writer.  In the end ""The Go-Go's Live in Central Park"" is for the true Go-Go groupie, who will endure the less than adequate sound just to see the gals rockin' and rollin' again.",4,Looks 10 Sound 3 for the Go-Go's Concert in Central Park,1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,2635,"['thought', 'God', 'Bless', 'Go-Go', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'albums', '2001', 'really', 'great', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'album', 'thought', 'Belinda', 'Carlisle', 'had', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'mainly', 'wonderful', 'harmonies', 'provided', 'Jane', 'Wiedlin', 'thought', 'Charlotte', 'Caffey', 'was', 'continuing', 'build', 'song', 'writing', 'talent', 'displayed', 'Talk', 'Show', 'one', 'album', 'Graces', 'Perfect', 'View', 'Paul', 'Q.', 'Kolderie', 'Sean', 'Slade', 'were', 'main', 'producers', 'mixers', 'album', 'apparently', 'deserve', 'lot', 'credit', 'Go-Go', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'main', 'reason', 'concert', 'video', 'Go-Go', 'Live', 'Central', 'park', 'so', 'disappointing', 'sound', 'mix', 'awful', 'deplorable', 'utterly', 'disappointing', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'Slightly', 'better', 'rehearsal', 'tapes', 'early', 'days', 'popped', 'up', 'Return', 'Valley', 'Go-Go', 'most', 'part', 'instruments', 'overwhelm', 'vocals', 'start', 'finish', 'concert', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'live', 'performances', 'Go-Go', 'years', 'Belinda', 'Carlisle', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'stage', 'studio', 'not', 'even', 'stand', 'chance', 'one.The', 'concert', 'mix', 'new', 'seven', 'tracks', 'new', 'album', 'requisite', 'hits', 'yesterday', 'Vacation', 'Got', 'Beat', 'Lips', 'Are', 'Sealed', 'Talk', 'Show', 'album', 'represented', 'original', 'great', 'leap', 'forward', 'band', 'punk', 'group', 'pop', 'rockers', 'woefully', 'under-represented', 'Head', 'Over', 'Heels', 'still', 'gig', 'understandable', 'group', 'previous', 'concert', 'video', 'was', 'tour', 'album', 'Again', 'new', 'songs', 'rely', 'more', 'vocal', 'harmonies', 'e.g.', 'Unforgiven', 'Apology', 'suffer', 'sound', 'problems.Fortunately', 'DVD', 'redeemed', 'somewhat', '30-minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'show', 'band', 'getting', 'ready', 'gig', 'fans', 'get', 'revved', 'up', 'party', 'person', 'who', 'up', 'impressing', 'most', 'footage', 'Gina', 'Schock', 'not', 'only', 'business', 'drumming', 'away', 'stage', 'most', 'articulate', 'member', 'talking', 'Go-Go', 'then', 'now', 'ironic', 'only', 'one', 'group', 'who', 'never', 'sings', 'silent', 'concert', 'working', 'seriously', 'wad', 'gum', 'Finally', 'do', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'Apology', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'song', 'Kathy', 'Valentine', 'ever', 'been', 'listed', 'lead', 'writer', 'end', 'Go-Go', 'Live', 'Central', 'Park', 'true', 'Go-Go', 'groupie', 'who', 'will', 'endure', 'less', 'adequate', 'sound', 'just', 'see', 'gals', 'rockin', 'rollin', 'again']",N/A

677384,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005R1NY,trebe,"[0, 0]","The Go-Go's Live in Central Park, is a fun and entertaining performance recorded in 2001, very shortly after the release of God Bless the Go-Go's, the band's first new album in seventeen years.  The concert is both a journey back to the band's heyday in the 80's, and a look forward with their new music.  The eighteen song performance, features a mix of classic material and eight selections from their new album.  Although the new material is perhaps a bit edgier and more mature, the music still has the same classic Go-Go's sound, resulting in a pretty cohesive show.The large outdoor stage in New York's Central Park is a neat venue for the band, who kick things off with 'Head Over Heels', featuring Charlotte Caffey on keyboards.  It doesn't take long for singer Belinda Carlisle to kick off her heels and begin roaming around the stage, making keeping a spotlight on her a challenge.  Gina Schock drives the beat hard on the drums, while guitarist Jane Weidlin and bass player Kathy Valentine, keep things jumping.  The band seems to be having a great time.  The infusion of a lot of unfamiliar new material, may cause the crowd to be a bit subdued, but enthusiasm builds during the older material.  With 'This Town', 'Vacation', 'Skidmarks On My Heart', 'Beatnik Beach', 'Our Lips Are Sealed' and ""We Got the Beat', the Go-Go's deliver the classic material people came to her.  However the new songs like 'Apology', 'Insincere', 'Stuck in My Car', 'La La Land', and 'Sonic Superslide' are great as well.  The ladies certainly rocked hard in this performance, which is a mere 65 minutes, with the finale being a cover of The Ramones 'I Wanna Be Sedated'.The video is wonderfully clear, if the editing cuts were just delayed a few seconds, the concert would be much more enjoyable.  The audio mix is pretty good, with vocals being mostly up front and only occasionally drowned out.  The drums are kicking all the time, and the guitars have some cool industrial dirtiness, but as is evident in Kathy's solo passage in 'Head Over Heels', the bass needs to be cranked up.The extras are fun stuff, including video shot the day of the performance of the band members getting their makeup done, goofing around on the way to Central Park, and then getting ready to take the stage.  We see that Jane is very outgoing, while Belinda is the quiet one, at least on this day.  And there is a four minute interview piece with the band, discussing their comeback and some of the new songs.  A little more depth interview would have been nice.  After so long, fans might be interested in things like what's been happening since the split, why and how did they reunite, and how do the members feel about the band and their music after recording the new album?  Was there any special story behind the Central Park concert?  What about additional follow up regarding the 2001 comeback?Formed in 1978, with a punk/new wave influence, The Go-Go's were one of the first all female bands in rock to perform their own material.  In a short hyper-productive period, the band produced the albums Beauty and the Beat (1981), Vacation (1982), and Talk Show (1984).  Unfortunately, problems within the group led to Jane Weidlin's departure in 1984, stalling the Go-Go's career.  The members pursued their individual paths, with Belinda Carlisle finding the biggest commercial success.  The original lineup reunited a few times over the years, recording some new material for the retrospective Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's (1994).  But it was not until 2001, that the original members would reunite to record God Bless the Go-Go's, a great album which seasoned by mature song writing, updates the classic Go-Go's sound.  At the moment, the CD is very inexpensive, so check it out.",4,The Go-Go's 2001 comeback . . .,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,3765,"['Go-Go', 'Live', 'Central', 'Park', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'recorded', '2001', 'very', 'shortly', 'release', 'God', 'Bless', 'Go-Go', 'band', 'first', 'new', 'album', 'seventeen', 'years', 'concert', 'journey', 'back', 'band', 'heyday', '80', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'music', 'eighteen', 'song', 'performance', 'mix', 'classic', 'material', 'eight', 'selections', 'new', 'album', 'new', 'material', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'edgier', 'more', 'mature', 'music', 'still', 'same', 'classic', 'Go-Go', 'sound', 'resulting', 'pretty', 'cohesive', 'show.The', 'large', 'outdoor', 'stage', 'New', 'York', 'Central', 'Park', 'neat', 'venue', 'band', 'who', 'kick', 'things', 'off', ""'Head"", 'Heels', 'featuring', 'Charlotte', 'Caffey', 'keyboards', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'singer', 'Belinda', 'Carlisle', 'kick', 'off', 'heels', 'begin', 'roaming', 'stage', 'making', 'keeping', 'spotlight', 'challenge', 'Gina', 'Schock', 'beat', 'hard', 'drums', 'guitarist', 'Jane', 'Weidlin', 'bass', 'player', 'Kathy', 'Valentine', 'keep', 'things', 'jumping', 'band', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'infusion', 'lot', 'unfamiliar', 'new', 'material', 'may', 'cause', 'crowd', 'be', 'bit', 'subdued', 'enthusiasm', 'builds', 'older', 'material', ""'This"", 'Town', ""'Vacation"", 'My', 'Heart', ""'Beatnik"", 'Beach', 'Lips', 'Are', 'Sealed', 'Got', 'Beat', 'Go-Go', 'deliver', 'classic', 'material', 'people', 'came', 'However', 'new', 'songs', ""'Apology"", 'Car', 'La', 'Land', ""'Sonic"", 'Superslide', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'ladies', 'certainly', 'rocked', 'hard', 'performance', 'mere', '65', 'minutes', 'finale', 'being', 'cover', 'Ramones', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', ""Sedated'.The"", 'video', 'wonderfully', 'clear', 'editing', 'cuts', 'were', 'just', 'delayed', 'few', 'seconds', 'concert', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'audio', 'mix', 'pretty', 'good', 'vocals', 'being', 'mostly', 'front', 'only', 'occasionally', 'drowned', 'out', 'drums', 'are', 'kicking', 'time', 'guitars', 'have', 'cool', 'industrial', 'dirtiness', 'evident', 'Kathy', 'solo', 'passage', ""'Head"", 'Heels', 'bass', 'be', 'cranked', 'up.The', 'extras', 'are', 'fun', 'stuff', 'including', 'video', 'shot', 'day', 'performance', 'band', 'members', 'getting', 'makeup', 'done', 'goofing', 'around', 'way', 'Central', 'Park', 'then', 'getting', 'ready', 'take', 'stage', 'see', 'Jane', 'very', 'outgoing', 'Belinda', 'quiet', 'one', 'least', 'day', 'four', 'minute', 'interview', 'piece', 'band', 'discussing', 'comeback', 'new', 'songs', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'interview', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'so', 'long', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'things', 'what', 'been', 'happening', 'split', 'why', 'how', 'did', 'reunite', 'how', 'do', 'members', 'feel', 'band', 'music', 'recording', 'new', 'album', 'Was', 'special', 'story', 'Central', 'Park', 'concert', 'What', 'additional', 'follow', 'up', 'regarding', '2001', 'comeback', 'Formed', '1978', 'punk/new', 'wave', 'influence', 'Go-Go', 'were', 'one', 'first', 'female', 'bands', 'rock', 'perform', 'own', 'material', 'short', 'hyper-productive', 'period', 'band', 'produced', 'albums', 'Beauty', 'Beat', '1981', 'Vacation', '1982', 'Talk', 'Show', '1984', 'Unfortunately', 'problems', 'group', 'led', 'Jane', 'Weidlin', 'departure', '1984', 'stalling', 'Go-Go', 'career', 'members', 'pursued', 'individual', 'paths', 'Belinda', 'Carlisle', 'finding', 'biggest', 'commercial', 'success', 'original', 'lineup', 'reunited', 'few', 'times', 'years', 'recording', 'new', 'material', 'retrospective', 'Return', 'Valley', 'Go-Go', '1994', 'was', 'not', '2001', 'original', 'members', 'would', 'reunite', 'record', 'God', 'Bless', 'Go-Go', 'great', 'album', 'seasoned', 'mature', 'song', 'writing', 'classic', 'Go-Go', 'sound', 'moment', 'CD', 'very', 'inexpensive', 'so', 'check', 'out']",N/A
