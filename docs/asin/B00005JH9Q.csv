The two girls can't speak English and just look bewildered most of the time as they mouth some of the most tiresome ""jokes"" from some of the chessiest hack writers of all time, and it has all sorts of racists imagery including some fat Japanese guy dressed up like a Samauri running around threatening Jeff with a sword (oh ha ha).  Jeff, of course, was the guy they brought in to speak English, and he is - if it is possible - even chessier than the absurd jokes the girls are forced to ""deliver.""  His stupid ridiculous etc. Nixon impressions were probably great hits in some lounge in Grand Rapids, Michigan, full of drunk Rotatarians, but they don't even evoke a groan, just an eye-roll that any human being could possibly, at any time ever, find them entertaining.  The dancers are fifth rate, not too attractive, and obviously going through the motions of some of the most absurd 70s chirography possible (and they are rarely even together).  The guests are people like Hugh Hefner, who wanders around in a bathrobe (sorry, ""dressing gown,"") with braindead playmates hinting about all the sex he is supposedly having and that you are not.  Jim Varney had talent as we all know, but is swamped by such utterly bad material that even he has trouble taking it seriously.  The ""guest"" musical acts are just cheap videos put on to make the thing relevant - Blondie's ain't bad..  And, of course, everyone is dressed in third-rate costumes put together by some designer who got drunk in Vegas and caught Elvis a couple of times.Everytime I begin to bitch about how bad television is today, I just put this on, and suddenly I am so glad that some thirty years separate myself from this radioactive excrement that smells so badly I have to put on a DVD of ""My Mother the Car"" to clean the place up.Now with all that said, why am I buying the DVD set?  Because this is a treasure that represents the depths of mediocrity to which the human imagination can plunge, and I just love it.  P.S.

583757,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B00005JH9Q,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[1, 1]","Yes, this show was produced in 1980, but it is pure late 70s through and through.  Many people may say, ""How could a show this bad actually be produced?""  However, if one looks at the comparable TV shows of the era, Pink Lady & Jeff can easily be dissected into an amalgam of every variety show that had come before it.Although even the best of the late 70's variety shows were pure cheese, the ratings could not be argued with.  Sonny & Cher and Donny & Marie perfected the formula of these variety hours.  Other, lesser examples of the time included Captain & Tenille, Tony Orlando & Dawn, and of course The Brady Bunch Variety Hour.  The last of which, produced by the same team responsible for Pink Lady & Jeff, would probably have received the honor of ""worst variety show ever produced"" had a certain Japanese pop group and low-rent comedian never gotten together.Pink Lady & Jeff takes the variety show format and presents it in an unfunny, watered-down, non-sensical way.  It truly is a program that is amazingly awful.  You cannot help but sit there, mouth agape, while an endless array of confusing comedy sketches, uncomprehensible accents, and horribly un-PC ""jokes"" are thrown around for six hour-long shows.  Jeff (Altman) is the host of the show for all intents and purposes.  His jokes are horrible, however I am not sure if he is fully to blame as I doubt he wrote all his bits himself.  Pink Lady probably have charisma and charm, but it does not translate well to American audience (obviously, based on the dismal ratings these six episodes garnered).  They read their lines phonetically, and make no bones about the fact that they have NO idea what they are saying.  They stand there, head down, waiting for Jeff to finish speaking.  Then one of them will look up, attempt to spit out some kind of degrading remark about Jeff, and get an obviously sweetened hearty laugh from the studio audience.  This is repeated ad infinitum throughout the course of the series.  Of course, these are interspersed with the aforementioned bad comedy sketches (think Laugh-In Lite) and sometimes surprisingly good guest stars and song-and-dance numbers.Now, this review may sound like I hated this show.  Quite the opposite, actually.  I ate up every minute of it!  It's one of those shows that you almost feel sorry for.  It's like a dog that is so ugly it is cute.  If you can think of it in that regard, all the while imagining what must have been going on in the guest stars heads as they bumbled through this nonsense, you can have a VERY fun, enjoyable time with this series.  But, as a qualifier, I must say that this is a show for those who appreciate camp value and understand it completely.  Because with this show, you ain't got nothin' else!My only beef with this set is the confusing packaging.  It's in a giant amaray case and includes three discs.  There are two episodes on each disc, so it's kind of a bulky DVD set for a six episode series.  Other than that, this set is great.  The menus are kind of busy, but the picture quality is perfect.  It looks slightly better than a first generation VHS tape, which is really better than should be expected for a show of this caliber.So, in conclusion, if you enjoy the more popular and well-known variety shows of the time, definitely check out Pink Lady & Jeff.  It may not be good for you, but it sure is fun to watch!",5,Amazing slice of late '70s camp.,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,3386,"['Yes', 'show', 'was', 'produced', '1980', 'pure', 'late', '70s', 'Many', 'people', 'may', 'say', 'How', 'could', 'show', 'bad', 'actually', 'be', 'produced', 'However', 'one', 'comparable', 'TV', 'shows', 'era', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'Jeff', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'dissected', 'amalgam', 'variety', 'show', 'had', 'come', 'it.Although', 'even', 'best', 'late', '70', 'variety', 'shows', 'were', 'pure', 'cheese', 'ratings', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'argued', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'perfected', 'formula', 'variety', 'hours', 'Other', 'lesser', 'examples', 'time', 'included', 'Captain', 'Tenille', 'Tony', 'Orlando', 'Dawn', 'course', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Variety', 'Hour', 'last', 'produced', 'same', 'team', 'responsible', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'Jeff', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'received', 'honor', 'worst', 'variety', 'show', 'ever', 'produced', 'had', 'certain', 'Japanese', 'pop', 'group', 'low-rent', 'comedian', 'never', 'gotten', 'together.Pink', 'Lady', 'Jeff', 'variety', 'show', 'format', 'presents', 'unfunny', 'watered-down', 'non-sensical', 'way', 'truly', 'program', 'amazingly', 'awful', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'sit', 'there', 'mouth', 'agape', 'endless', 'array', 'confusing', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'uncomprehensible', 'accents', 'horribly', 'un-PC', 'jokes', 'are', 'thrown', 'six', 'hour-long', 'shows', 'Jeff', 'Altman', 'host', 'show', 'intents', 'purposes', 'jokes', 'are', 'horrible', 'however', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'fully', 'blame', 'doubt', 'wrote', 'bits', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'probably', 'have', 'charisma', 'charm', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'American', 'audience', 'obviously', 'based', 'dismal', 'ratings', 'six', 'episodes', 'garnered', 'read', 'lines', 'phonetically', 'make', 'bones', 'fact', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'stand', 'there', 'head', 'down', 'waiting', 'Jeff', 'finish', 'speaking', 'Then', 'one', 'will', 'look', 'up', 'attempt', 'spit', 'out', 'kind', 'degrading', 'remark', 'Jeff', 'get', 'obviously', 'sweetened', 'hearty', 'laugh', 'studio', 'audience', 'repeated', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'course', 'series', 'course', 'are', 'interspersed', 'aforementioned', 'bad', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'think', 'Laugh-In', 'Lite', 'sometimes', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'guest', 'stars', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers.Now', 'review', 'may', 'sound', 'hated', 'show', 'opposite', 'actually', 'ate', 'up', 'minute', 'one', 'shows', 'almost', 'feel', 'sorry', 'dog', 'so', 'ugly', 'cute', 'can', 'think', 'regard', 'while', 'imagining', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'guest', 'heads', 'bumbled', 'nonsense', 'can', 'have', 'VERY', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'series', 'qualifier', 'must', 'say', 'show', 'who', 'appreciate', 'camp', 'value', 'understand', 'completely', 'show', 'ai', ""n't"", 'got', 'nothin', 'else', 'My', 'only', 'set', 'confusing', 'packaging', 'giant', 'amaray', 'case', 'three', 'discs', 'are', 'two', 'episodes', 'disc', 'kind', 'bulky', 'DVD', 'set', 'six', 'episode', 'series', 'Other', 'set', 'great', 'menus', 'are', 'kind', 'busy', 'picture', 'quality', 'perfect', 'slightly', 'better', 'first', 'generation', 'VHS', 'tape', 'really', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'show', 'caliber.So', 'conclusion', 'enjoy', 'more', 'popular', 'well-known', 'variety', 'shows', 'time', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'Jeff', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'sure', 'fun', 'watch']",Pink Lady ...And Jeff

This series only ran 6 episodes in 1980,  but it was such a wacky idea that it actually worked.Mie and Kei were both good performers, and while you could tell they didn't seem too comfortable performing in English, you could still see how fun they could be.Jeff Altman wasn't as unfunny as people say, I thought they guy had a few funny sketches, the problem was, awful writing.I was only a few months old when this series ran in 1980, but I caught episodes on Trio a few months ago, and the side of me that appreciates camp had to buy this.  And what a purchase it was.  I find the show amusing and cringeworthy at the same time.  There were some good guest-stars but you just know they don't consider it part of their resume.

583760,A313FHXGRZNB68,B00005JH9Q,"FateJacketX ""FJX""","[1, 1]","""Pink Lady and Jeff"" was a variety show from the late 70's or early 80's - hell I don't know. All I remember is, I was in love with this show when I was a kid. It was a show with jokey skits and musical guests and all that, hosted by two cute Japanese women and an American comedian named Jeff Altman. Jeff Altman's other grand roles include ""Weather Wizard"" from 1979's opus ""Legends of the Superheroes"" and 2007 ""Urban Decay"" where he plays ""Man in Dumpster.""The ladies were Keiko Matsuda and Mitsuyo Nemoto. The IMDB has one little nibble of interesting trivia about Keiko: ""She is one half of the Japanese singing duo ""Pink Lady"". And Mitsuyo's trivia is only slightly more riveting: ""She is one half of the Japanese singing duo ""Pink Lady"" with Keiko Masuda.""Such was the ""talent"" behind the very ill-fated run of ""Pink Lady and Jeff."" Weirdly, the girls were big hits in Japan throughout the 70's and 80's, having turned some popular American songs into Japanese versions with different lyrics. Problem is, some doofus saw them and thought it would be a great idea to put them on tv with a second-rate clown telling bad jokes:Jeff: ""You girls are the biggest thing in Japan!""Pink Lady: ""No, Jeff, the biggest thing in Japan is Godzilla!""Ba-DUM-dum.Not only could the girls speak very little English, but the guy was just as bad at the language of humor. Why did I like this show when I was young?? Because the girls were hot? I don't know. All I know is, I wasted twenty+ bucks on this thing, thinking I could relive a childhood curiosity. All I got for my money was an irresistable need to write a rant review. If you feel like gritting your teeth while laughing at sheer ineptitude, buy ""Pink Lady and Jeff.""

583761,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B00005JH9Q,Graves,"[2, 2]","Pink Lady and Jeff, if this title conjures up memories of uncomfortable gags and a miserable pan-Pacific attempt at variety, then congratulation, you DO remember it correctly!In 1980 before NBC had discovered shows like Cosby or Cheers they were desperate to try anything. The president got wind of Pink Lady the hottest pop duo in Japan and signed them to host a prime time variety show. It was only after they were signed and `delivered' to the US did anyone bother to ask if the ladies actually spoke English. In short, the answer was...no.Yup, NBC had sunk big bucks into a show that was going to be hosted by two beautiful, talented women who were completely unintelligible to their target audience. In an attempt to salvage the mess the network hired Jeff Altman an up and coming stand up comic to act as host to step in as the person who would explain America to the ladies from the east.The effect was like trying to save the Titanic with duct tape. Pink Lady was talented and these women truly worked at it. They would learn jokes and dialogue phonetically so they could look like they were interacting with Jeff but since they didn't really understand what they were saying and couldn't relearn new routines quickly, there was no chance for re-writes or improv. Also in a misguided attempt at political correctness the network tried to give each woman a distinctive personality. One was bubbly the other was waspish, ""see they're not all alike,"" I'm sure someone said. Unfortunately Pink Lady's act was that they moved and sang interchangeably so this well intentioned act only served to further throw off the timing of the shows ""star's"" from their usual routine.I think the ultimate blame for this train wreck of a program falls on the saggy shoulders of Jeff Altman. Sure he was asked to step up and salvage a situation almost beyond repair from the start. But if you watch some of the acts with some of the guests they DO work. Sid Caesar spewing gibberish as the over protective samurai father of the girls preparing for their first date or a song and dance routine with Donnie Osmond work, brilliantly! It played to the strengths of Pink Lady and you could see why they were stars in Japan. The problem is these gems make the bulk of the interaction with Jeff Altman all the more painful because you've seen how well it CAN work and what the vision of the producer was. If Pink Lady shined in a comedy bit with Sid Caesar and was just painful in a comedy bit with Jeff Altman, then you have to ask, what was different?There are great bits in this series but to get to them you have to sit through some painfully unfunny bits.

Unfortunately, the only thing funny about this disc set is why I bought it at all.The &quot;so-bad-it's-funny&quot; element of PL&amp;J wears thin about 10 minutes into the first episode. By then it's easy to see why this show is so infamous; the sketches were lame, the running gags never got any better with age, and the whole premise just needed working out before this went to air in the spring of 1980. What's really bad about this is how some great guest stars such as Sid Caesar, Red Buttons, Larry Hagman, Sherman Hemsley (of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;) and more are wasted here.On the positive side, Red Buttons' &quot;Abraham Lincoln Roast&quot; on episode 5 and Byron Allen's monologue on episode 6 are worth viewing, but they are the exception, not the rule.In the interview segment, Jeff Altman (who gets zero laughs in all six episodes) admits that the premise was faulty and that the execution was inept. Krofft Entertainment should have erased the tapes of this disaster immediately after NBC pulled the plug, but they had to let it turn up on DVD two decades later instead.

Collins ""DVD Junkie""","[4, 4]","It's hard to describe what a BIG deal Pink Lady was in Japan - For almost five years, everyone followed what they did, ate, wore... and they bought guidebooks on how to do the steps for each of their songs. During the opening of ""Pink Lady and Jeff"" you see them perched on convertibles in a huge stadium packed with frenzied fans. Even now in Japan there are commercials referring to some of their most famous songs.This show was just a travesty - they'd had a surprisingly successful show in Vegas, so Sid and Marty thought, ""Well maybe..."" But at the same time, Pink Lady's popularity was slipping - they'd overstepped some boundaries and the Japanese public felt that Pink Lady were getting too big for their satin mini-britches.The travesty is that they weren't allowed to draw on their strongest point - the fact that they did everything in perfect unison, like disco fembots. The producers forced them to take on different personalities - one sweet and ditzy, the other sharp-tongued, and they were very uncomfortable. Plus, they were singing English disco songs which were already a couple years old in America. In the very last episode they sang some of their Japanese hits - the relief is palpable when you watch them.There were worse shows at the time - I just saw Paul Lynde's 1976 Halloween Special, and believe me, Pink Lady and Jeff is Shakespeare compared to that!I do recommend seeing this, but try to trick one of your friends into buying this, then watch it together.

Curiousity got the better of me and I decided to subject myself to all six episodes in this set.There's no doubt about it that this is hands down one of the worst variety shows ever made.  It make the Brady Bunch Variety Hour look like an Emmy award-winning masterpiece.One thing that makes this a nice period piece is the guest stars.  Where else but on an early 1980s variety show could you see Donny Osmond, Larry Hagman, Boomer the dog, Hugh Hefner, Sherman Hemsley and others?Pink Lady are actually a very interesting piece of Japanese pop culture but NBC failed when they brought them to the American television audience.  Instead of letting the girls do what they do best-singing in Japanese and dancing with cloned robotic precision, the writers tried to give Mie and Kei distinct personalities and made them sing mostly in English.  Add in the fact that they were paired with unfunny supporting actors and that the girls could barely speak English and you have a recipe for disaster.NBC could've truly had an usual cult show if they would've created a different format for Pink Lady.  They could've shown it late at night (perhaps in the timeslot for SNL or David Letterman) and had a Neo-Tokyo Anime style set.  Mie and Kei could've spoken in Japanese with subtitles (like Kaga in early episode of ""Iron Chef"") or with a futuristic robotic translator.  The real show featured some early video clips from Blondie and Cheap Trick.  Perhaps if Pink Lady had introduced video clips instead of guest stars, MTV (which didn't even exist when this show was aired) would be very different today.As you watch these episodes, try to image what could've been.  If you want to minimize your exposure to Pink Lady, check out Episode 3.  It has Mie and Kei singing their Japanese hit ""UFO"" with great dance moves and it has Greg Evigan from ""BJ and the Bear"" performing a halfway decent song.Audio commentary from Sid and Marty Krofft and Jeff Altman should've been a MUST on this set.  I'd love to hear their explanations for putting this on the air and how they would've reacted after having to view these shows after 20 years.  A ""Behind the Music"" style documentary could've helped U.S. viewers to see how popular Pink Lady were in Japan and presented a different side to them from their variety show.The extras in the set are minimal.  Jeff Altman introduces each show and there is a small gallery of TV print ads.  The box promises the history of Pink Lady as one of the extras but some of the text pages seemed to be missing when I viewed them.There only 2 episodes on each disc and the box is very bulky; it's thicker than some VHS cases.  There are also no captions.  Sometimes Mie and Kei are hard to understand and subtitles would've helped.  Chapters for each Pink Lady song would've been useful also.The curious who wish to watch this are warned to take it in small doses.
