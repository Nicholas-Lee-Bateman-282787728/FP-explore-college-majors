1161890,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00198TUO4,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Okay, it was bound to happen, right? After all the gnashing of teeth about the lost of American jobs to other countries, after all the India-China bashing as the symbol of those loses and after all the strident, if fruitless, lambasting of those facts by every yahoo politician and cretin-like labor bureaucrat we were bound to get out of Hollywood (or Bollywood, for that matter) a comedic take on this phenomenon. And, given the political ethos of these times, a little `lesson' in multi-culturalism to boot.It may be unfair to lay the vagaries of the world labor market and the current phase of capitalist ""globalization"" on a simple film, and I won't, at least not much because this was actually an entertaining film on its own terms, but its subtext (nice weasel word, right?) does fit in rather nicely about the state of the still fervent ""outsourcing"" strategy that virtually every large corporation in America (and elsewhere) has hit upon in order tot reduce (and reduce significantly) their wage bills, particularly administrative costs and the price of unskilled and semi-skilled labor.A quick sketch of the plot is in order. An American telemarketing corporation in order to cut those high administrative costs fires it's American-centered order-taking staff and out sources to the highly skilled but cheap wage Indian labor market. A middle level executive, the star of the film, Josh Hamilton, is called upon to bring the Indians up to speed and the twists and turns of the plot turn around the struggle to get the Indians to conform to the Taylor productivity speed up system well-known in American business circles. The faults and follies of this transformation drive the, sometimes understated, comedy of the film. Along the way, naturally, said executive gets an up close and personal lesson in multiculturalism from a very fetching Indian love interest.But here is the point for our purposes-in the end, and I am really giving nothing away here, the Indian employees in their turn are fired so that the corporation can set up shop in the even cheaper Chinese labor market. In short, the race to the bottom continues on its merry way unabated. It is that unabated condition that I will finish up with. I've mentioned those cretin-like labor bureaucrats above who have ""belly-ached"" about the flight of jobs to other countries without lifting finger one to organize labor internationally to drive wages up and make the flight of jobs out much less attractive . Hell, they haven't, at least since the great wave of industrial unionism led by the CIO drives of the 1930's, done anything to organize labor in the cheap-labor American south or, and here is the real crime, Wal-mart. This is hardly the end of the discussion. Let's leave it at this for now- organize globally and think locally. Thinking the other way around gets us no place- American, Indian or Chinese.",4,Outsourcing For Fun And Profit,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,2882,"['Okay', 'was', 'bound', 'happen', 'right', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'lost', 'American', 'jobs', 'other', 'countries', 'India-China', 'bashing', 'symbol', 'loses', 'strident', 'fruitless', 'lambasting', 'facts', 'yahoo', 'politician', 'cretin-like', 'labor', 'were', 'bound', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'Bollywood', 'matter', 'comedic', 'take', 'phenomenon', 'given', 'political', 'ethos', 'times', 'little', 'lesson', 'multi-culturalism', 'boot.It', 'may', 'be', 'unfair', 'lay', 'vagaries', 'world', 'labor', 'market', 'current', 'phase', 'capitalist', 'globalization', 'simple', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'least', 'not', 'much', 'was', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'film', 'own', 'terms', 'subtext', 'nice', 'weasel', 'word', 'right', 'fit', 'rather', 'nicely', 'state', 'still', 'fervent', 'outsourcing', 'strategy', 'virtually', 'large', 'corporation', 'America', 'elsewhere', 'hit', 'upon', 'order', 'tot', 'reduce', 'reduce', 'significantly', 'wage', 'bills', 'particularly', 'administrative', 'costs', 'price', 'unskilled', 'semi-skilled', 'labor.A', 'quick', 'sketch', 'plot', 'order', 'American', 'telemarketing', 'corporation', 'order', 'cut', 'high', 'administrative', 'costs', 'American-centered', 'order-taking', 'staff', 'out', 'sources', 'highly', 'skilled', 'cheap', 'wage', 'Indian', 'labor', 'market', 'middle', 'level', 'executive', 'star', 'film', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'called', 'bring', 'Indians', 'up', 'speed', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'turn', 'struggle', 'get', 'Indians', 'conform', 'Taylor', 'productivity', 'speed', 'up', 'system', 'well-known', 'American', 'business', 'circles', 'faults', 'follies', 'transformation', 'drive', 'sometimes', 'understated', 'comedy', 'film', 'way', 'naturally', 'said', 'executive', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'lesson', 'multiculturalism', 'very', 'fetching', 'Indian', 'love', 'interest.But', 'here', 'point', 'purposes-in', 'end', 'am', 'really', 'giving', 'nothing', 'away', 'here', 'Indian', 'employees', 'turn', 'are', 'fired', 'corporation', 'can', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'even', 'cheaper', 'Chinese', 'labor', 'market', 'short', 'race', 'bottom', 'merry', 'way', 'unabated', 'unabated', 'condition', 'will', 'finish', 'up', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'cretin-like', 'labor', 'bureaucrats', 'who', 'have', 'belly-ached', 'flight', 'jobs', 'other', 'countries', 'lifting', 'finger', 'one', 'organize', 'labor', 'internationally', 'drive', 'wages', 'up', 'make', 'flight', 'jobs', 'out', 'much', 'less', 'attractive', 'Hell', 'have', ""n't"", 'least', 'great', 'wave', 'industrial', 'unionism', 'led', 'CIO', 'drives', '1930', 'done', 'anything', 'organize', 'labor', 'cheap-labor', 'American', 'south', 'here', 'real', 'crime', 'Wal-mart', 'hardly', 'end', 'discussion', 'Let', 'leave', 'now-', 'organize', 'globally', 'think', 'locally', 'Thinking', 'other', 'way', 'place-', 'American', 'Indian', 'Chinese']",N/A

Grudgingly, Todd goes, and immediately becomes overwhelmed in a strange land. From a bad choice of food right off the plane to trying to run a business like Americans do in a country halfway around the world, Todd feels lost. However, slowly but surely, he starts to acclimate to the culture and the people all around him, and starts to discover the true beauty that exists in India, but that many never allow themselves to see. As his understanding grows, his employees grow to like and respect him, including Asha (Ayesha Dharker), a strong, independent woman who quickly puts him in his place...but also wins his heart. Through many twists and turns and less-traveled paths, Todd discovers himself in a place he never thought he would, half a world away from the life he thought he wanted.

1161893,AR0TPKBRIOECO,B00198TUO4,Azzan,"[0, 0]","Unlike The Other End of the Line, OUTSOURCED does not take the typical route of a &#34;border-crossing&#34; romantic comedy. In fact, it is bigger than a romantic comedy.Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) is an average man who has been in the comfort zone too long. (Comfort being watching or listening from a distance, through the nightly or 24/7 news). He was in need of an upfront reality check that the U.S.A. is not the center of the universe. Puro (Asif Basra) and Asha (Ayesha Dharker) do not hesitate to make that clear, and in a civilized, non-arrogant manner. Plus, they show that we all want big and better in our lives. At the same time, Puro and Asha demonstrate appreciation of the simple things and do not deny that primitive does not mean idiotic or neurotic. Josh shows how easy it is when we listen and look very closely to who and what is near and far from us. From a first-hand point-of-view.The film could have shown more of Todd's life prior to his journey to and through India, rather than just relying on word of mouth. Same with Asha and Puro's stories. Maybe even add in some the other workers at the call center; expand on their parts.But all in all OUTSOURCED is recommended for viewers who are done with stereotypes and media defamation.

January, 2008, 115 minutes, not to be confused with the five other films of the same title) is a most charming and quite hilarious film that settles into a warm, quasi-mystical human experience. Todd (Josh Hamilton) is a quiet and mild-mannered management dude with a crummy novelty gift company. When the work is outsourced to India, losing everybody's job except Todd's, he's sent to a town near Bombay (Gharapuri) to train their call center manager.As a review said, this is a film that totally drenches the viewer in the humanity and beauty of the Indian people. While it will naturally not immerse us in some of the ugliest aspects of Indian life, we see the poverty and living conditions in a way I felt could have only been seen if you actually traveled to India to see. That, after all, is a film's true purpose.Todd naturally falls in love with one of the workers (the spectacularly beautiful Ayesha Dharker) while straining to help his replacement, (the wonderful Asif Basra, a Rowan Atkinson lookalike). In his one-on-one culture clashes you will not only recognize yourself - whoever you are - you will recognize India. It's best seen, thoroughly enjoyed rather than explained in a review.I waited anxiously for years to see this film, because I think it fell between the cracks, flopped, was forgotten and I myself completely forgot I wanted to see it. About 25% of these films are like that for me ... luckily I get to see them eventually. This film happens to be on one of my cable movie channels at the moment. It seems the subject matter may be one of extreme sensitivity, as anyone can attest who's been stuck on the phone with a non-American, accent thick as butter.It pins down a vital point: this is not about jobs anymore. The people of India, like those of Africa, are our parents, our elders and our betters. They suffer and struggle partly because of the West - but all they want is a chance to live a good, decent life. I am NOT arguing in favor of outsourcing. I don't agree with it. I am arguing about humanity.This film will teach you a bit of that, show you the humor, the laughs, the tears and the satisfaction of putting your palms together, bowing and sincerely saying, ""Namaste"".

The premise was wonderful: A young marketing executive finds that his entire department has been outsourced to India. In order to keep his job (and his stock options), he needs to fly to India to train his replacement. With this kind of set-up, the opportunity for inter-cultural gags and misunderstandings was enormous.So, why wasn't this movie funnier, more poignant, more touching, more quirky, more everything? For one thing, the acting was thoroughly uninspired. Although the Indian cast did its best, the Americans sounded bored with their lines. I can't say that I blame them. The lackluster writing contributed quite a bit to the general lack of flavor in this film, but so did the directing. Scenes which might have generated some tension sounded like read-throughs rather than performances. The unrelenting predictability of the plot certainly didn't help. How difficult could it have been to come up with ONE original plot point? The scene in which the young couple was forced to share a pink, heart-shaped bed at the Kamasutra Hotel actually made me groan.On the bright side, the film was nicely shot.

1161908,A2RE5ZLL3RB084,B00198TUO4,H. P.,"[0, 0]","Ashok and Asha are about to consummate their marriage.  They were engaged when she was only four years old, arranged by their parents, and the pending marriage had been the focus of Ashok&#8217;s life ever since.  He took a less than glamorous job, with the sole intention of supporting who would soon be the love of his life, not a love at first sight as he had seen in more recent Bollywood movies, but a deeper love that would soon develop as they spent their years together.  And he had remained celibate, difficult, as Western culture infiltrates India. As he looked at her, about to give her her first kiss, he sensed that her mind was somewhere else.  &#8220;Is this the way it should be?&#8221; he thought.  He had been thinking and dreaming of this moment for years, and yet she did not seem all that excited about it.  As they began to make love, she seemed deftly comfortable with it, practiced, as though she had done this before.  Yet, she did not seem passionate about it.  She appeared to be going through the motions, but her heart wasn&#8217;t in it.&#8220;Are you alright,&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;You seem as though something is wrong.&#8221;&#8220;No,&#8221; she flatly replied.  &#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;He, of course, had to accept that at face value.  He had not much experience with women, in that their words alone don&#8217;t always convey exactly what they mean.  But continuing felt as though performing with an uninspired doll, beautiful to look at but dreadfully inactive.  He stopped and looked at her.  She looked back, but not with the depth of one truly in love, but rather like someone who desperately wanted to be in love, almost as if she was trying but couldn&#8217;t make it happen.  As she continued to look, a tear fell from here eye, and then another, and then another.&#8220;I can&#8217;t do this,&#8221; she cried.  She turned onto her belly and began weeping.Feeling that it was somehow his fault, he began to console her, until the guilt was overwhelming and she needed to unload.  She was in love with another man, an American named Todd, whom she affectionately called &#8220;Toad.&#8221;  She had made love to him, twice, as part of her &#8220;Goan Vacation&#8221; about which she had planned not to tell a soul.  But she had to tell him.  She could not go through the lovemaking with him when she loved someone else.Ashok was devastated and furious.  He had waited his entire life for this moment, had saved himself, and had expected the same of her.  After all, her parents had presented her to his parents as a virgin with every intent on staying that way.  Therefore, he had taken not his dream job but one that would provide his wife a comfortable living for the rest of her life.  And so began their marriage.&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; you say.  &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t part of the movie!  I don&#8217;t remember these scenes.  &#8216;Outsourced&#8217; was a happy romantic comedy that took place when a young manager of a call center has to travel to India to bring a call center up to speed and has to deal with daily life in rural India as he falls in love with one of his employees.  It&#8217;s cute and funny.&#8221;But indeed it was, an essential part of the story.  It was the part of the story you didn&#8217;t see, but that would surely have taken place as a result of Todd and Asha&#8217;s dalliance.Asha did not grow up in modern American society, where premarital sex is so prevalent high school students often learn to perform oral sex prior to learning how to shake hands.  She grew up in culture where girls have their marriages arranged at age four and it is improper for a man and woman to touch each other in public other than a business handshake.  How do we know this?  Asha herself says so.  In such a culture, premarital sex is regarded somewhere between grand larceny and murder.  Sure, that presentation of India is a bit twisted.  We know that men and women in large cities date and have sex before marriage, but Asha is not from that culture.  Again, she says so.  She is from a culture where a man takes a stable job just so he can marry, which is exactly what her work colleague did.This is what ultimately killed the movie for me.  The overall story itself started out perfect.  An American call center is being outsourced to India and the call center manager has being made to go to India to set up the center there and train the staff.  In doing so, he realizes that things don&#8217;t work quite the way they do in the US and that presents numerous humorous situation as he takes a train, rides a cab, gets pickpocketed, patronizes a street vendor, and deals with a stray cow that has wandered into his office building.  But as he does so, he also realizes that he must learn about India as well and that success is not merely imposing American ways on India but also understanding Indian ways as well.  It is a predictable but wonderfully positive message to put forth.Yet, somehow, that was not enough.  It is almost as though the producers decided that they need to shove sex down our throats just to show how hip and un-prude they were, hoping someone would criticize them on it, thus allowing them to choose one of a series of previously canned retorts alluding to Mormonism, Puritanism or &#8220;Ozzie and Harriet.&#8221;  And what made it so obvious is how cheesily it was done.  Todd and Asha were stranded on a remote island and the only hotel had only one room available: the &#8220;Kama Sutra Suite,&#8221; complete with a heart-shaped bed, which they were forced to share.  I mean, seriously?  After trying for two-thirds of the movie to present a somewhat accurate picture of India, they come up with this?It is unfortunate that the producers had to do this because the movie could have been really top notch.  The concept was funny, the characters were likable, cinematography was pleasant and interesting, and many of the episodes were humorous as well as touching.  But instead, it just felt unclean after having seen it, as though I was part of an effort to corrupt a culture that a lot of people consider truly sacred.",2,Gradually Slips from Likeable to

This is essentially a cultural comparison movie that helps the main character discover himself, and it shows a side of Indian life that most of us are probably not aware of. There's a cute romantic subplot, and a spattering of local color that reminds me of my trip to Thailand, and will make most viewers want to book the next plane to Mumbai.The film doesn't dwell on the awkward political issues of outsourcing except to poke fun at everyone involved: the consumers are moaning about outsourcing but refuse to pay higher domestic prices; the Indian workers don't understand why they have to fake American accents and love all the ""tacky"" junk the company sells; and the American managers are bad-tempered, cynical and soulless.

Asha would inform Todd that he had much to learn about Indian culture.This was a colorful film with some funny scenes. It was cute how Asha tried to understand the slang that westerners use.  The character played by Josh wanted to learn about the culture also. He stayed at a home with customs he didn't always understand. There is a funny scene involving food also.

1161924,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00198TUO4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Outsourced is a very entertaining film with comedy, a bit of drama and a healthy side dish of romance that avoids being syrupy sweet. The acting is extremely convincing and the casting was excellent. The cinematography is very good and the choreography shines, too. The musical score enhances the film; and this film held my full attention every step of the way.When the action starts, we meet Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) who manages a customer service/order entry call center in Seattle and his boss Dave (Matt Smith). Things start to get complicated real fast when Dave tells Todd that the company is outsourcing all the jobs in their department to a call center in India; and Dave insists that Todd go there to train his successor who will be making much less money than the company ever paid Todd. Todd initially refuses but when Dave intimidates him, Todd goes to India and the story really gets going.Todd has quite a hard time adjusting to India and its people with their customs; and of course we see that Indians have difficulty understanding American customs, too. Todd also begins working with his successor Purohit N. Virajnarianan (Asif Basra) and he stays at the home of ""Aunti Ji"" (Sudha Shivpuri). Tensions start almost immediately when Aunti Ji questions Todd from the very word go about his love life and how much he makes a year at his job; these are not typical questions when you meet somebody for the first time if you are used to American social norms and mores.Todd is under quite some pressure to get the call center up and running fast so that he can get back home to Seattle. Todd realizes he has to learn about India in order to get the most out of his employees; and then he cleverly designs an incentive program to motivate the Indian employees to handle their calls faster. Meanwhile, Todd's affection is slowly but surely increasing for Asha (Ayesha Dharker); a beautiful young woman who returns Todd's affections for her.Look for some excellent scenes throughout this movie that offer us fantastic insights about the Indian way of life and the customs of the Indian people.In addition, the plot can certainly go anywhere from here. What happens when Dave unexpectedly turns up in India to see for himself just how the call center is doing? Do Todd and Asha enter into a committed relationship? No spoilers here--watch and find out!In addition, the DVD comes with some nice bonus features. There is a ""behind-the-scenes"" featurette; a discussion with cinematographer Teodoro Maniaci and director John Jeffcoat; another interview with director John Jeffcoat; a music video and more!Outsourced is a fine motion picture for people who want a view of how people in foreign countries deal with the influx of new jobs that have been outsourced to their country; and the light comedy and romance spice it up a bit as well.

None of the actors in this film were used in the series, but that is not to imply they are better or worse than those chosen by the network. The story is simple: Todd, an American head of a call center is sent to India to train his replacement. While there, he experiences significant culture shock, but instead of turning into the ""Ugly American"", he come to appreciate many of the finer points of Indian culture. There is also a romantic interest between Todd and Asha, one of his workers. She is smart, attractive, and there is clearly a degree of mutual interest, however she is already engaged to another through an arrangement between her parents and her fiance's parents. The viewer is left wondering how this will be resolved until literally the very last scene, and still it's subject to interpretation.I felt that that Indian culture was treated in a sensitive manner, although Todd's reaction was sometimes one of confusion.

1161936,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00198TUO4,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 3]","""Outsourced,"" (2006) is a brisk 103 minutes, a romantic, feelgood PG-13, in full color, of course.  The script was written by, and directed by the young John Jeffcoat, and is a cross-cultural comedy, clearly made by, for, and about the young.  But, for a wonder, this independently-made, tiny budget dramatic comedy is not about young louts, nor a gross-out picture, and, while it's somewhat sentimental, should offend no one.  The picture is set in that youthful West Coast city Seattle, and in an India that's growing exponentially overnight, as more and more jobs are exported there from the Western world.When his department is sent to India, customer call center manager Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton -The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)) must head to Mumbai to train his successor Purohit N. Virajnarianan (Asif Basra).  Amusing culture clashes ensue as Anderson tries to explain American business practices to his willing, but befuddled new employees, and they try to explain India to him.  The chief explainer-of-India to Anderson proves to be his employee and love interest, Asha, played by the alluring Ayesha Dharker, (Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones (Full Screen Edition)).  Mind you, Dharker is not in the same category of sheer knockout beauty as is Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire), but she's charming, and easy on the eyes.  However, these actors are all unknown to me, though the Indians may be known in Bollywood cinema, with which I have no familiarity.  Nevertheless they do a nice job.The scenery, filmed in India, is affectionate, spicy, and eye-opening.  Anderson's call center has supposedly been located in Guaripur, a dusty backwater town in the state of Bihar, in the vicinity of the city of Bombay, now Mumbai  -- the very small town that "" call me Angie,"" Anjali Bose, the heroine ofMiss New India, the most recent book by American-Indian author Bharati Mukherjee, is so eager to leave.  Nevertheless, even Angie does mention that call centers-- and jobs - are finally coming to Guaripur, as the bigger cities on the subcontinent are packed out.  And Purohit does mention to Anderson that, as every suitable building, even in Guaripur, is fully occupied, the company has been forced to build a new one.  It's plopped down in the middle of farmland; it looks like an above-ground bunker, and its address is simply ""Fulfilment Centre.""

It's a typical fish out of water tale, but with a nice modern twist.  Take a customer service manager that is comfortable with his existence in a call center in the United States and force him to go run the companies new call center that has been Outsourced to India.  Seems simple enough, take a few days, go check out the center and make the required improvements and then climb on the plane and go back home.  If only it was that simple.U.S. citizens tend to think of the world revolving around them and the United States, but that is far from the truth.  If you've seen any episodes of the reality TV series Amazing Race you may have learned a bit about the rest of the world and also may have learned about how bad U.S. citizens can behave while visiting the rest of the world.  Many times we (U.S. citizens) assume that the rest of the world should automatically understand and speak U.S. English.  We also assume that the U.S. dollar should be good everywhere, and that we can find our choices of food items everywhere we go.  Such is really not the case, as is evidenced by the realism that shines through this film with comedic flare.This is a great film to watch whether or not you ever had the priviledge of traveling outside the U.S. or not. If you are lucky, you might have friends and co-workers that are immigrants.  I have had just that experience, with a former co-worker that is from India.  Having seen this film streamed from the by-mail/internet disc rental company on my gaming console with the green X on the controller, I was very happy to be able to show them that co-worker and her family the movie while visiting one afternoon.  She and her husband (also from India) both thoroughly enjoyed telling myself and my family about how realistic things were in the film.I would dearly love to have this film on Blu-ray or the now defunct HD DVD format.  It's a very good film, and for some it might even hit the status of great.  It is certainly well worth viewing, and would be a definite buy on Blu-ray (if it was available) if that was possible.  On DVD, well, I'm holding out for now in the hopes it eventually comes out on Blu-ray, but at the right price it would be a nice addition to anyone's collection.",4,What's another word for delightful? and I'd love to own this on Blu-ray :-),1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2681,"['few', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'charming', 'and/or', 'delightful', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'use', 'same', 'words', 'being', 'bit', 'short', 'theasarus', 'moment', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'could', 'fire', 'up', 'word', 'processor', 'use', 'theasarus', 'function', 'there', 'etc.', 'why', 'do', 'when', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'nice', 'Hindi', 'word', 'use', 'instead', 'think', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'words.This', 'funny', 'film', 'also', 'being', 'sweet', 'charming', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'typical', 'fish', 'water', 'tale', 'nice', 'modern', 'twist', 'Take', 'customer', 'service', 'manager', 'comfortable', 'existence', 'call', 'center', 'United', 'States', 'force', 'go', 'run', 'companies', 'new', 'call', 'center', 'been', 'Outsourced', 'India', 'Seems', 'simple', 'enough', 'take', 'few', 'days', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'center', 'make', 'required', 'improvements', 'then', 'climb', 'plane', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'only', 'was', 'simple.U.S', 'citizens', 'tend', 'think', 'world', 'revolving', 'United', 'States', 'far', 'truth', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'reality', 'TV', 'series', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'may', 'have', 'learned', 'bit', 'rest', 'world', 'also', 'may', 'have', 'learned', 'how', 'bad', 'U.S.', 'citizens', 'can', 'behave', 'visiting', 'rest', 'world', 'Many', 'times', 'U.S.', 'citizens', 'assume', 'rest', 'world', 'should', 'automatically', 'understand', 'speak', 'U.S.', 'English', 'also', 'assume', 'U.S.', 'dollar', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'everywhere', 'can', 'find', 'choices', 'food', 'items', 'everywhere', 'go', 'Such', 'really', 'not', 'case', 'evidenced', 'realism', 'film', 'comedic', 'flare.This', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'not', 'ever', 'had', 'priviledge', 'traveling', 'U.S.', 'not', 'are', 'lucky', 'might', 'have', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'are', 'immigrants', 'have', 'had', 'just', 'experience', 'former', 'co-worker', 'India', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'streamed', 'by-mail/internet', 'disc', 'rental', 'company', 'gaming', 'console', 'green', 'X', 'controller', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'be', 'able', 'show', 'co-worker', 'family', 'movie', 'visiting', 'one', 'afternoon', 'husband', 'also', 'India', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'telling', 'family', 'how', 'realistic', 'things', 'were', 'film.I', 'would', 'dearly', 'love', 'have', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'now', 'defunct', 'HD', 'DVD', 'format', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'might', 'even', 'hit', 'status', 'great', 'certainly', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'would', 'be', 'definite', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'available', 'was', 'possible', 'DVD', 'well', ""'m"", 'holding', 'out', 'now', 'hopes', 'eventually', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'right', 'price', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection']",N/A
