1289557,A3Q096SIAEEC1Z,B002U6CJQA,Daniel Bowne,"[0, 0]","OK... First off I love the UFC but this DVD was one of the worst they have put out. I wouldn't say it is the absolute worst they have put out but to me this was a waste of time and money. This dvd is clips of what UFC calls their 100 greatest fights. What UFC did was they had a poll on their website and the fans voted on the fights but the bad thing was that UFC left a lot of really great fights off the list because some of the fighters are or were on bad terms with Dana White. These fighters are guys like Ken Shamrock, Frank Shamrock, Tim Sylvia, Tito Ortiz, etc... Like I said, it is a waste of time and money when you can buy a set of all 100 fights in their complete form for about fifteen dollars more.",3,Not That Great!!!!,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,713,"['OK', 'First', 'love', 'UFC', 'DVD', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'absolute', 'worst', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'dvd', 'clips', 'what', 'UFC', '100', 'greatest', 'fights', 'What', 'UFC', 'did', 'was', 'had', 'poll', 'website', 'fans', 'voted', 'fights', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', 'UFC', 'left', 'lot', 'really', 'great', 'fights', 'list', 'fighters', 'are', 'were', 'bad', 'terms', 'Dana', 'White', 'fighters', 'are', 'guys', 'Ken', 'Shamrock', 'Frank', 'Shamrock', 'Tim', 'Sylvia', 'Tito', 'Ortiz', 'etc', 'said', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'when', 'can', 'buy', 'set', '100', 'fights', 'complete', 'form', 'about', 'fifteen', 'dollars', 'more']",UFC: The Ultimate 100 Greatest Fight Moments

It's a cool DVD to have when you don't have time to watch actual full fights. I think it's good to see short highlights of memorable moments of past UFC matches and having fighters talk about what happened in those fights; but don't expect to see all the fights you like. For example, I would of hoped to see some Bas Rutten, Marco Ruas, and even Frank Shamrock in this DVD. All in all I would say it's a nice DVD to have. I have watched it a few times now and am still watching it.. just to get that rush now and again.",4,Over a decade of UFC in one DVD,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,636,"['Highlights', 'anyone', 'who', 'intending', 'item', 'should', 'know', 'highlight', 'DVD', '100', 'fights', 'UFC', 'cool', 'DVD', 'have', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'actual', 'full', 'fights', 'think', 'good', 'see', 'short', 'highlights', 'memorable', 'moments', 'past', 'UFC', 'matches', 'having', 'fighters', 'talk', 'what', 'happened', 'fights', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'fights', 'like', 'example', 'would', 'hoped', 'see', 'Bas', 'Rutten', 'Marco', 'Ruas', 'even', 'Frank', 'Shamrock', 'DVD', 'would', 'say', 'nice', 'DVD', 'have', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'am', 'still', 'watching', 'it..', 'just', 'get', 'rush', 'now', 'again']",UFC: The Ultimate 100 Greatest Fight Moments
1289559,A23LHYBAB2SXWC,B002U6CJQA,nin/ja77,"[2, 3]","It's fair to say that back at UFC 1 in 1993 not many people thought that 16 years later UFC would be getting ready for its 100th event and would be easily doing over a million pay per view buys in the U.S alone and have a worldwide audience and would even be now accepted as a mainstream sport and be sanctioned in most U.S states, and sell out arenas in those that it is sanctioned. So what better way to celebrate the historic event UFC 100 would go on and become is to count down the top 100 moments in it's history.It's fair to say two things saved UFC, first was the Fertitta brothers listening to Dana White and buying the company that was on it's last legs and the second was the self financed make or break reality show The Ultimate Fighter(TUF) becoming an overnight sensation on cable tv mainly thanks to the finale featuring finalists Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin.So what you get with this dvd is over 3 hours of a countdown(from 100 to 1) of the UFC's greatest moments, whether it be Ken Shamrock's and Tito Ortiz's heated rivalry, Matt Hughes coming back from an illegal groin strike or Randy Couture defying the critics and father time to become a champion at the age of 43 they are all include here, all the great fights and upsets!! I don't want to give away too much as that would spoil the countdown but there's many jump out of your seat moments and it's a great dvd for new fans of the sport to learn a bit of history.There's loads of talking heads to talk about the moments including UFC president Dana White as well as commentator Joe Rogan and of course loads of the actual fighters that actually competed in the fights.This dvd is really a must for new and old fans of the UFC and it must hurt the knockers of the sport who said it would never last and was too barbaric. One thing is for sure is that it won't take another 16 years before UFC 200 comes along!!",5,BRINGS BACK LOADS OF MEMORIES,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,1890,"['fair', 'say', 'back', 'UFC', '1', '1993', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'thought', '16', 'years', 'later', 'UFC', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'ready', '100th', 'event', 'would', 'be', 'easily', 'doing', 'over', 'million', 'pay', 'view', 'buys', 'U.S', 'alone', 'have', 'worldwide', 'audience', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'now', 'accepted', 'mainstream', 'sport', 'be', 'sanctioned', 'most', 'U.S', 'states', 'sell', 'out', 'arenas', 'sanctioned', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'celebrate', 'historic', 'event', 'UFC', '100', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'count', 'down', 'top', '100', 'moments', 'history.It', 'fair', 'say', 'two', 'things', 'saved', 'UFC', 'first', 'was', 'Fertitta', 'brothers', 'listening', 'Dana', 'White', 'buying', 'company', 'was', 'last', 'legs', 'second', 'was', 'self', 'financed', 'make', 'break', 'reality', 'show', 'Ultimate', 'Fighter', 'TUF', 'becoming', 'overnight', 'sensation', 'cable', 'tv', 'mainly', 'finale', 'featuring', 'finalists', 'Stephan', 'Bonnar', 'Forrest', 'Griffin.So', 'what', 'get', 'dvd', '3', 'hours', 'countdown', '100', '1', 'UFC', 'greatest', 'moments', 'be', 'Ken', 'Shamrock', 'Tito', 'Ortiz', 'heated', 'rivalry', 'Matt', 'Hughes', 'coming', 'back', 'illegal', 'groin', 'strike', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'defying', 'critics', 'father', 'time', 'become', 'champion', 'age', '43', 'are', 'include', 'here', 'great', 'fights', 'upsets', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'spoil', 'countdown', 'many', 'jump', 'seat', 'moments', 'great', 'dvd', 'new', 'fans', 'sport', 'learn', 'bit', 'history.There', 'loads', 'talking', 'heads', 'talk', 'moments', 'including', 'UFC', 'president', 'Dana', 'White', 'as', 'well', 'commentator', 'Joe', 'Rogan', 'course', 'loads', 'actual', 'fighters', 'actually', 'competed', 'fights.This', 'dvd', 'really', 'must', 'new', 'old', 'fans', 'UFC', 'must', 'hurt', 'knockers', 'sport', 'who', 'said', 'would', 'never', 'last', 'was', 'too', 'barbaric', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', '16', 'years', 'UFC', '200', 'along']",UFC: The Ultimate 100 Greatest Fight Moments

1289562,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B002U6CJQA,Richard Ross,"[7, 8]","Actually, you have two more choices. You can buy this DVD of ""moments"" from the 100 Greatest Fights for $5 or you can spend 5-6x that and buy theUFC: Ultimate 100 Greatest Fightsbox set which shows all 100 fights in their entirety. That set runs over 26hrs whereas this DVD clocks in at just under 3.5hrs. If you're just a casual fan who's curious as to which fights they picked, you won't be disappointed with this DVD. It packs a lot of punch for such a cheap price. But if you want to see all 100 fights go the distance, you're gonna wanna go with the box. It all comes down to how much time and money you want to invest in some of the best the UFC has to offer.Here's my personal ""Tale Of The Tape"" as to how these two match up: This ""moments"" DVD, unlike the box set, actually features on-camera commentary from more than half of the fighters on the countdown. They share their training regiment, fight strategy, injuries - both sustained and inflicted -, what they really think about their opponents, reactions to the judge's decisions, their personal picks for the greatest fight of all time and all kinds of other interesting trivia. For instance, I never knew that the Huerta/Garcia fight landed the UFC on the cover of Sports Illustrated. So even if you buy the box set, this DVD might make a nice companion piece if you want to learn more about the fighters or the fights. The only problem, and it's a big one, is that you can't directly access individual fights. This program was taken from a five night event that SpikeTV aired to coincide with UFC 100. In total there were five 50min. episodes. So you can only pick Episodes 1-5. For those who want to watch specific fights, you're going to be doing a lot of fast-forwarding. It's kind of a big hassle. But other than that, I still highly recommend this DVD. You're gaining some and losing some compared to the box set but you're saving a hell of a lot of money in the process. Truth be told, if I had found this DVD before I bought the box set, I probably wouldn't have spent the money on the box.",4,2 Choices: Snap Or Tap,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,2062,"['Actually', 'have', 'two', 'more', 'choices', 'can', 'buy', 'DVD', 'moments', '100', 'Greatest', 'Fights', '5', 'can', 'spend', '5-6x', 'buy', 'theUFC', 'Ultimate', '100', 'Greatest', 'Fightsbox', 'set', '100', 'fights', 'entirety', 'set', 'runs', '26hrs', 'whereas', 'DVD', 'just', '3.5hrs', ""'re"", 'just', 'casual', 'fan', 'who', 'curious', 'fights', 'picked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'lot', 'punch', 'cheap', 'price', 'want', 'see', '100', 'fights', 'go', 'distance', ""'re"", 'gon', 'wan', 'na', 'go', 'box', 'down', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'money', 'want', 'invest', 'best', 'UFC', 'offer.Here', 'personal', 'Tale', 'Tape', 'how', 'two', 'match', 'up', 'moments', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'actually', 'on-camera', 'commentary', 'more', 'half', 'fighters', 'countdown', 'share', 'training', 'regiment', 'fight', 'strategy', 'sustained', 'inflicted', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'opponents', 'reactions', 'judge', 'decisions', 'personal', 'picks', 'greatest', 'fight', 'time', 'kinds', 'other', 'interesting', 'trivia', 'instance', 'never', 'knew', 'Huerta/Garcia', 'fight', 'landed', 'UFC', 'cover', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'So', 'even', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'DVD', 'might', 'make', 'nice', 'companion', 'piece', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'fighters', 'fights', 'only', 'problem', 'big', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'directly', 'access', 'individual', 'fights', 'program', 'was', 'taken', 'five', 'night', 'event', 'SpikeTV', 'aired', 'coincide', 'UFC', '100', 'total', 'were', 'five', '50min', 'episodes', 'can', 'only', 'pick', 'Episodes', '1-5', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'specific', 'fights', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'doing', 'lot', 'fast-forwarding', 'kind', 'big', 'hassle', 'other', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'gaining', 'losing', 'compared', 'box', 'set', ""'re"", 'saving', 'hell', 'lot', 'money', 'process', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'had', 'found', 'DVD', 'bought', 'box', 'set', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'spent', 'money', 'box']",UFC: The Ultimate 100 Greatest Fight Moments
