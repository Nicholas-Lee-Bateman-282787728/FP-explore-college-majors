We laughed and laughed as Kyle's luck turned from good to bad... and he begins turning into a leprechaun - all because his ""lucky charm"" is stolen.The movie brings up an important subject of family heritage... something that we all have.  Kyle is not interested in anything of his own until he believes his parents are hiding it from him... with that and his sudden bad luck and the physical changes his mother and him take on... Kyle is the answer to preserving that history, and saving his good fortune of being an American.At the end of the movie, you will want to stand up and sing along with the final song.  This is a warm, feel-good, family movie... good for kids of all ages, and a great way to get your children interested in their own family heritage.",5,Fun... charming... educational,1014940800,"03 1, 2002",2002,818,"['love', 'Disney', 'movie', 'so', 'do', 'young', 'daughters', 'laughed', 'laughed', 'Kyle', 'luck', 'turned', 'good', 'bad', 'turning', 'leprechaun', 'lucky', 'charm', 'stolen.The', 'movie', 'up', 'important', 'subject', 'family', 'heritage', 'something', 'have', 'Kyle', 'not', 'interested', 'anything', 'own', 'parents', 'are', 'hiding', 'sudden', 'bad', 'luck', 'physical', 'changes', 'mother', 'take', 'Kyle', 'answer', 'preserving', 'history', 'saving', 'good', 'fortune', 'being', 'American.At', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'stand', 'up', 'sing', 'along', 'final', 'song', 'warm', 'feel-good', 'family', 'movie', 'good', 'kids', 'ages', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'children', 'interested', 'own', 'family', 'heritage']",Luck of the Irish VHS

It aired on the Disney channel a few years ago and we watched it then and decided to buy it. I think we got it on iTunes as well but sometimes we pop this in and pop some corn and enjoy it. It is even better  if you made green popcorn balls, drank green river soda's and had an &#34;Irish night&#34; on St Patrick's Day.

685820,A3TXPVSQ4LUQGK,B00005UQEK,"""sonnetinkinston""","[1, 1]","I first saw this movie in 2001, when it was produced for the Disney Channel.  ST. Patty's Day was on the weekend that year, and it was raining.  My little brother and I (17 at the time) were home alone, fell in love with this movie, and watched it twice more that weekend.  Ever since, we watch to try and catch it every year.  Now, we don't have to.True, this follows typical Disney Channel Original Movie Style, sometimes seeming overacted or cheesy.  But for the most part, it makes for an extremely culturally informative and fun adventure the whole family can enjoy, or at least appreciate.",5,Family favorite...,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,595,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', '2001', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'ST.', 'Patty', 'Day', 'was', 'weekend', 'year', 'was', 'raining', 'little', 'brother', '17', 'time', 'were', 'home', 'alone', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'watched', 'twice', 'more', 'weekend', 'Ever', 'watch', 'try', 'catch', 'year', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'to.True', 'typical', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movie', 'Style', 'sometimes', 'seeming', 'overacted', 'cheesy', 'most', 'part', 'extremely', 'culturally', 'informative', 'fun', 'adventure', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'least', 'appreciate']",Luck of the Irish VHS

Well, I guess you may or may not know where your family came to the United Centers from, but then if you learn about where you family came from, where you and your luck start to change. In this movie it does happen. Kyle Johnson (Ryan Merriman) is a junior high school student, that does not know where his family came from. His mom (Marita Geraghty) and Dad (Paul Kiernan) doesn't give him any information on the famliy's history, and the only thing they share with him is that he is They are from Cleveland. Kyle has special taletns, like guessing on a test, turning in in and getting it right and touch the net on the basketball hoop. One morning, Kyle wakes up and finds his mom not only talking Irish, but also making Irish food. Now if don't think it can get bad enough, check out the movie to watch what happens, to Kyle and his Mom. I reccomend this movie to you if you are Irish, or Irish at heart.",4,A good movie to watch around St. Patrick's Day,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,1043,"['are', 'looking', 'movie', 'Irish', 'characters', 'watch', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'watch', 'Well', 'guess', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'family', 'came', 'United', 'Centers', 'then', 'learn', 'where', 'family', 'came', 'where', 'luck', 'start', 'change', 'movie', 'happen', 'Kyle', 'Johnson', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'family', 'came', 'mom', 'Marita', 'Geraghty', 'Dad', 'Paul', 'Kiernan', ""n't"", 'give', 'information', 'famliy', 'history', 'only', 'thing', 'share', 'are', 'Cleveland', 'Kyle', 'special', 'taletns', 'guessing', 'test', 'turning', 'getting', 'right', 'touch', 'net', 'basketball', 'hoop', 'One', 'morning', 'Kyle', 'up', 'mom', 'not', 'only', 'talking', 'Irish', 'also', 'making', 'Irish', 'food', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'get', 'bad', 'enough', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'watch', 'what', 'Kyle', 'Mom', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'are', 'Irish', 'Irish', 'heart']",Luck of the Irish VHS
