686164,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005UW7I,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 20]","One could consider this film like a cinematic whole-wheat pancake.  Your film comes topped with butter, syrup, and all the fruits you can think of (the characters of the film).  When it is presented originally Va Savoir looks tantalizingly delicious, but after ten minutes of eating you realize that you finished and still hungry.  You realize that this mound of goodness was nothing more than fluffy cooked dough that will ultimately make you fat, lazy, and sleepy.  While it may give you a high at first, the darkness of the inevitable ""sugar-low"" is fast approaching and causing you to grab your stomach in disgust.  Also, it was a flop.  Perhaps that was a bit overboard, but I really wanted to explain this film in a way that was a bit more entertaining than the film itself.  To put it bluntly, this film was like watching the grass grow in your back yard in anticipation of having to mow it again.  It was slow, not very colorful, and a pain to sit through.  When it finally gets too long, it hurts too much to do it again, but you know it must be done.  That feeling is exactly how I felt about the film Va Savoir.This is a devoutly character based film.  To make a deeply rooted character based film to work, you must first have exciting characters that you know your audience is going to want to follow.  Sadly, this was not the case in this film.  From the opening scene (where the subtitles were not working on my DVD) all the way till the final moments of the film, we have to follow four of the dullest characters in cinematic history.  Cammille is our pilot, following an emotion and feeling that is never quite developed in the story and therefore never quite developed in her.  Her mannerisms and reactions to situations made me feel as if she was a bit on the loony side.  Perhaps it was the way that Jeanne Balibar chose to play her, but there was nothing making me believe that Cammille was a very strong character.  Her actions throughout the film prove that much, but what are her motives and reasonings?  That is never explained or developed, yet there was three hours to do it.  Strange.  This goes the same for Sonia, who I also never really fully grasped onto.  She seemed to be in love, but at the same time enjoying moments with Arthur.  Her need to rearrange made me think that her and Cammille had similar personalities (loony), which is what made them become friends near the end.  Yet, again, it was never explained.  We, the audience, were forced to follow a lot of assumptions in this film, and whenever we felt that we fully understood and connected with a character, Rivette would pull us further away.  It was as if he never really wanted us to fully understand them, but still accept them.  That didn't brood well with me.Couple this with random intermissions of the play that these performers are putting on for the Parisians only helps to confuse the audience.  I couldn't tell if Cammille was actually acting in the play or just walking through the lines.  Half the time it looked as if it bothered her to be there.  There was no emotion or excitement when she was on stage prompting me to question whether she was this ""infamous"" actress that they claimed her to be.  I have seen several foreign films in my lifetime, but this one takes the cake as possibly the longest passenger car to Dullsville.  I had trouble understanding the play that was happening throughout the film, thus causing me to care less about the characters.  The final thirty minutes of this movie are actually fun.  The scenes where Pierre and Ugo decide to duel are hysterical.  I actually watched this scene over again because I enjoyed it so much.  The connections made at the end tied the film up nicely, but still left too many questions unanswered.Overall, I was lost in this film.  If you ever pick up this film and you see a blonde-hair, blue-eyes 26-year old wandering through the scenes, it is I just trying to understand this film.  I can't figure it out, I can understand most Lynch, Gilliam, and others of the ""jigsaw puzzle"" genre, but this was just beyond my control.  The characters seemed drab and never fully comfortable in their roles, and those that were jumped between emotions like playing leapfrog in kindergarten.  The stories were connected well, but it didn't make any difference if the characters (the glue of the stories) didn't hold them together.  In your eyes, and in your DVD player, you can see where this film just falls apart.  If you are looking for a stronger emotional powerhouse film where characters work with their characters and push the envelope even further, I would check out Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia.  This film reminded me of Magnolia except bad.I don't suggest anyone wasting their three hours on this film, but who am I except a lost guy in this film.Again, if found, please return!Grade: * out of

686165,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005UW7I,Andy Orrock,"[6, 7]","At 154 (!) minutes, ""Va Savoir"" could use about about 40+ minutes of judicious editing.  I'm open to French cinematic experiences - there's nothing like the thrill of discovering gems like ""Read My Lips"" or ""The Dinner Game"" - but at 2 hours 30 minutes plus, director Jacques Rivette here strains the patience of even the most hardened of cinephiles.That's not to say it isn't fun to watch Jeanne Balibar ooze her way across the screen - she's such a silky-smooth, enchanting presence.  And it's a treat to see Sergio Castellitto, who was spectacular in the winning 'Mostly Martha.'  And how about an actor who can play leads in German (as he did in 'Martha') and Italian and French (he does both with aplomb here in 'Va Savoir')?  This is one talented guy.  But condensing the film down to a tighter 1 hr 45 minutes would have greatly increased the viewing experience.Also, viewers should take care not to get freaked out during the first 1 - 2 minutes of the film.  It's in Italian, and the filmmakers (or its distributors?) don't start the subtitling until Camille (Balibar, on stage in the film, emoting in Italian) steps off stage and out of character and says ""In French now.""  And, viola, at that point the subtitles kick in.

686166,A1ENC0ALMHVBU,B00005UW7I,"D. HupFons ""Hup234""","[2, 2]","This French romantic comedy kept my interest mostly due to the twists of the various relationships and the overall fine performances by the cast.  The plot/story was hard for me to follow until 30-40 minutes into the movie due to 2 factors: (1) the frequent changes between the scenes of the touring play and the off-stage lives of the main characters with the other members of the cast and (2) the very slow pace of the first part of the story.  I found Jeanne Balibar's & Sergio Castellito's performances to be excellent, and that helped me to accept more easily the ambiguity of the story line.  I liked the film so much that when I finished watching it once, I watched the first 30-40 minutes of it again so I could enjoy that part of the film more than I did on my first viewing.  While that worked for me, I consider it to be a shortcoming of the film in general.  I also think that I would have enjoyed the film more if it had been carefully edited to be about 30 minutes shorter.",4,An Enjoyable French Romantic Comedy,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,987,"['French', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'kept', 'interest', 'mostly', 'due', 'twists', 'various', 'relationships', 'overall', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'plot/story', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', '30-40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'due', '2', 'factors', '1', 'frequent', 'changes', 'scenes', 'touring', 'play', 'off-stage', 'lives', 'main', 'characters', 'other', 'members', 'cast', '2', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'first', 'part', 'story', 'found', 'Jeanne', 'Balibar', 'Sergio', 'Castellito', 'performances', 'be', 'excellent', 'helped', 'accept', 'more', 'easily', 'ambiguity', 'story', 'line', 'liked', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'once', 'watched', 'first', '30-40', 'minutes', 'again', 'could', 'enjoy', 'part', 'film', 'more', 'did', 'first', 'viewing', 'worked', 'consider', 'be', 'shortcoming', 'film', 'general', 'also', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'carefully', 'edited', 'be', '30', 'minutes', 'shorter']",Va Savoir
686167,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005UW7I,Doug Anderson,"[7, 9]",This film runs 154 minutes which is about the length of most epics. This however is not an epic and though an excellent story(once it gets going)it will tire and try the patience of even the most devoted Rivette loyalists. I like this film and am glad to have stayed the course with it but Rivette could have given us filmgoers a little more to look at(most shots are interiors of hotels or apartments) for those 2 1/2 hours. That said this film in every other way succeeds and on a very high level.The story: In true new wave fashion the movie has no real starting point. The characters are at first met at some distance as we see them in their professional roles as actors. Slowly we see them in more relaxed settings and slowly we get to know them. The key word is slowly because for all the attention that must be paid the true payoffs don't start coming til approximately half way through the movie. It takes Rivette awhile (perhaps too long) to set up all the various situations/relationships but once set up the movies pace picks up. The lead actress plays a leading actress and how you feel about this movie will largely be determined by how you feel about her because everything pivots around her. The actress is not particualarly attractive and it takes awhile to begin to find her fascinating but she is that. In love with her director and in love with her ex her main emotion is indeciciveness. Not passion nor desire or anything excting just uncertainty. Interestingly however the other characters are equally indecisive. They are all indecisive in a different way and that makes this film farcical even though you rarely find yourself laughing at this human comedy. What is most memorable about the picture is how well eacg character is brought to us. Rivette is great with detail and nuance and you have to be with a picture like this. Every character has some aspect which will capture your interest and though the plot does not take you anywhere there is an arrival at the end. An arrival at a kind of understanding that allows for peoples complexities to coexist and that makes this film experience a very civilized one.  Rivette makes insightful use of the theatre in Va Savoir. The theatre is the place we ask the big questions about love and identity but life is not written out for us ahead of time so life is the even more uncertain cinema-theatre we actors all occupy. Rivette finds both art and life are richest when in most intimate contact with one another. In the end you will feel enlivened by that spirit of understanding and glad to have given your time to this epic length look at intimacy.,5,A Very Rare Kind of Pleasure,1024963200,"06 25, 2002",2002,2622,"['film', '154', 'minutes', 'length', 'most', 'epics', 'however', 'not', 'epic', 'excellent', 'story', 'going', 'will', 'tire', 'try', 'patience', 'even', 'most', 'devoted', 'Rivette', 'loyalists', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'stayed', 'course', 'Rivette', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'look', 'most', 'shots', 'are', 'interiors', 'hotels', 'apartments', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'said', 'film', 'other', 'way', 'very', 'high', 'level.The', 'story', 'true', 'new', 'wave', 'fashion', 'movie', 'real', 'starting', 'point', 'characters', 'are', 'first', 'met', 'distance', 'see', 'professional', 'roles', 'actors', 'Slowly', 'see', 'more', 'relaxed', 'settings', 'slowly', 'get', 'know', 'key', 'word', 'slowly', 'attention', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'true', 'payoffs', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'coming', 'til', 'approximately', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'Rivette', 'awhile', 'perhaps', 'too', 'long', 'set', 'up', 'various', 'situations/relationships', 'once', 'set', 'up', 'movies', 'pace', 'up', 'lead', 'actress', 'leading', 'actress', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', 'will', 'largely', 'be', 'determined', 'how', 'feel', 'everything', 'pivots', 'actress', 'not', 'particualarly', 'attractive', 'awhile', 'begin', 'find', 'fascinating', 'love', 'director', 'love', 'ex', 'main', 'emotion', 'indeciciveness', 'Not', 'passion', 'desire', 'anything', 'excting', 'just', 'uncertainty', 'Interestingly', 'however', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'indecisive', 'are', 'indecisive', 'different', 'way', 'film', 'farcical', 'even', 'rarely', 'find', 'laughing', 'human', 'comedy', 'What', 'most', 'memorable', 'picture', 'how', 'well', 'eacg', 'character', 'brought', 'Rivette', 'great', 'detail', 'nuance', 'have', 'be', 'picture', 'character', 'aspect', 'will', 'capture', 'interest', 'plot', 'not', 'take', 'anywhere', 'arrival', 'end', 'arrival', 'kind', 'understanding', 'peoples', 'complexities', 'coexist', 'film', 'experience', 'very', 'civilized', 'one', 'Rivette', 'insightful', 'use', 'theatre', 'Va', 'Savoir', 'theatre', 'place', 'ask', 'big', 'questions', 'love', 'identity', 'life', 'not', 'written', 'out', 'ahead', 'time', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'uncertain', 'cinema-theatre', 'actors', 'occupy', 'Rivette', 'art', 'life', 'are', 'richest', 'when', 'most', 'intimate', 'contact', 'one', 'end', 'will', 'feel', 'enlivened', 'spirit', 'understanding', 'glad', 'have', 'given', 'time', 'epic', 'length', 'look', 'intimacy']",Va Savoir

686169,A1NIEIENEWXCCQ,B00005UW7I,kaioatey,"[4, 4]","I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.  The story line is simple and, in some way, rather unimportant - Camille, a well-known Parisian actress, is returning from Rome to act in front of her home audience in a play directed by her new lover Ugo.  The play is Pirandello's Come Tu Mi Vuoi, a classical work (written for his lover Martha Abba) about a woman pinned between the yin and yang forces of reality and illusion.  Throughout the film Rivette switches his camera between the play and Camille and Ugo's  ""reality"" as if to ask us who are the real Camille and Ugo. What do they really want? What makes them tick? Can I, the spectator, enter their scriptless universe? Rivette (and his excellent actors) show us that delicateness can be robust and inventive, that desire for another can never be fulfilled and yet that the fulfillment does not really matter, because in the process of the struggle to achieve it we become alive and creative. What matters is style; style is substance. We are also treated to a brilliant depiction of the incestuous relationship between the Italians and the French and there is a delicious succession of nuances, hints and plays with the national stereotypes that  brought many a smile to my face.I can see why some - those used to Hollywood cliches with their happy endings and oh so predictable plots - might not find the movie to be that hot.

What's more, she's horribly overindulged by director Jacques Rivette, whose pacing often seems to take her lead and drags scenes out far beyond their natural lifespan just so she can slowly, dreamily roll her eyes up heavenward while smiling like an idiot another three times for no discernible reason. While a certain degree of affectation might have suited the character, this is in the realms of the absurd, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast are excellent and the film has a lot going for it whenever she's offscreen.

I just love the characters in this film. The way they talk, the dialogue, the situations and places they find themselves in, all of it magical. I do not understand people saying the film is enjoyable, but not heavy or a &quot;major Rivette&quot;, which I wholeheartedly disagree with (I find this to be Rivette's best work since &quot;La Belle Noiseuse&quot;). I have seen the film around 6 or 7 times and have yet to tire of it. For anyone looking for a charming, intelligent, hugely entertaining, and romantic movie...this is it. Highly recommended.",5,My favorite movie of 2001,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,774,"['When', 'saw', 'quot', 'Va', 'Savoir', 'quot', 'theaters', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'stayed', 'seat', 'next', 'showing', 'film', 'lethargic', '154-min', 'running', 'time', 'around', '5', 'hours', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'just', 'love', 'characters', 'film', 'way', 'talk', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'places', 'find', 'magical', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'people', 'saying', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'heavy', 'quot', 'major', 'Rivette', 'quot', 'wholeheartedly', 'disagree', 'find', 'be', 'Rivette', 'best', 'work', 'quot', 'La', 'Belle', 'Noiseuse', 'quot', 'have', 'seen', 'film', '6', '7', 'times', 'have', 'yet', 'tire', 'anyone', 'looking', 'charming', 'intelligent', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'romantic', 'movie', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Va Savoir
