William Powell is always a delight and is well supported in this tense and comedic film. The black and white film got 4 stars because the film quality isn't what we are used to today. Since men wore the same type clothing and same hairstyles, it was hard to distinguish characters at first. Once &#34;in&#34; to the story, that difficulty disappeared.

This time he is in the military and getting harassed by another woman trying to protect him and being jealous at the same time. That means interfering with the investigation. Poweell's character figures it out regardless. The bad guys are assembled, in a different way, and he nails the bad guys. Powell plays the same character but he does so entertainingly.

I am discovering there are quite a few movies that we have not yet seen from this time period, so I am hoping to find a few more treasures we can enjoy for the first time.  As I said, I love William Powell; he just has a certain charm.  I had read that they tried to get Myrna Loy for the role played by Rosalind Russell, but she was unavailable.  I'm not a huge fan of Rosalind Russell but decided to try it anyway.  We did still enjoy the movie, but I think it would have rated 5 stars if Myrna Loy had played the part.  Ms. Russell was an irritant, even annoying in her part, but the rest of the actors made the movie interesting and enjoyable.
