1238491,A1IP7XHSXLGKZB,B001U7B4T8,Statman,"[0, 0]","Many of the performances from this concert were absolutely terrific, while others - not so much. Unfortunately, this DVD contains too little of the former and too much of the latter. It does present Ronnie Wood, who turns in the most unexpectedly excellent performance of the show (but it doesn't have the similarly surprising Clancy Brothers). It also has excellent performances from Eric Clapton, the Band, George Harrison, and Roger McGuinn. But there are several fine performances missing, especially &#34;My Back Pages&#34;, one of the few superstar jams which actually works beautifully. I can't really recommend this DVD, but I would recommend the CD set. Of course, since I bought the CDs & DVD a few months ago, deluxe versions of both have been released.",2,Very Dissappointing - You May Want to Check Out the Deluxe Version,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,764,"['Many', 'performances', 'concert', 'were', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'too', 'little', 'former', 'too', 'much', 'latter', 'present', 'Ronnie', 'Wood', 'who', 'most', 'unexpectedly', 'excellent', 'performance', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'similarly', 'surprising', 'Clancy', 'Brothers', 'also', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Band', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Roger', 'McGuinn', 'are', 'several', 'fine', 'performances', 'missing', 'especially', '34', 'My', 'Back', 'Pages', '34', 'one', 'few', 'superstar', 'jams', 'actually', 'beautifully', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'CD', 'set', 'course', 'bought', 'CDs', 'DVD', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'deluxe', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'released']",N/A

I've watched it many times over the past decades and it never fails to move me. There were a lot of early '80s concert and early '90s concerts which were released on VHS before the DVD appeared and I have found most of them on LaserDiscs although ironically the cheapest place to buy them has been from Japan!This show is essential watching for anyone who loves Dylan. Imagine Dylan and Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty, Neil Young (vocal and guitar solos), George Harrison (vocal), and Eric Clapton (vocal and guitar solos) backed by Booker T. & The MGs and B. T. (with Steve Cropper) and G. T. Smith (Hall & Oates) and Anton Fig on drums doing ""My Back Pages"" and you know this is not a show that will disappoint.Dylan is even thrown in for good measure.",2,This Show Had The Audience Knockin' On Heaven's Door but not this version,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,915,"['have', 'entire', 'concert', 'Laserdisc', 'minus', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'Keep', 'Mine', 'woman', 'singer', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'actual', 'concert', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'decades', 'never', 'move', 'were', 'lot', 'early', 'concert', 'early', ""'90s"", 'concerts', 'were', 'released', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'appeared', 'have', 'found', 'most', 'LaserDiscs', 'ironically', 'cheapest', 'place', 'buy', 'been', 'Japan', 'show', 'essential', 'watching', 'anyone', 'who', 'Dylan', 'Imagine', 'Dylan', 'Roger', 'McGuinn', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Neil', 'Young', 'vocal', 'guitar', 'solos', 'George', 'Harrison', 'vocal', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'vocal', 'guitar', 'solos', 'backed', 'Booker', 'T.', 'MGs', 'B.', 'T.', 'Steve', 'Cropper', 'G.', 'T.', 'Smith', 'Hall', 'Oates', 'Anton', 'Fig', 'drums', 'doing', 'Back', 'Pages', 'know', 'not', 'show', 'will', 'disappoint.Dylan', 'even', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure']",N/A
