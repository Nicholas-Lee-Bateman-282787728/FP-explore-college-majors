Ying,"[5, 7]","Susanne Bier, the acclaimed Danish director almost never made bad films.I have seen and liked many of her films, ""In a Better World"", ""After the Wedding"", ""Brothers"" and ""Open Heart"",all exceptional quality films.Trine Dyrholm is a veteran Danish actor of many quality films.And there is Pierce Brosnan who played the romantic lead.The background was Sorrento, Italy, during summer, in a lemon orchard, where the two leading actors' childrenwere getting married.When Pierce and Trine first met, Trine's head was bald, due to chemo.And they fell in love, to be more accurate, Pierce the long suffering widower was attracted to Trine, the still marriedmother of the bride-to-be with an overweight husband not only get caught on living room sofa with his much youngerstaff but brought her along to the wedding!Then there is the annoying sister of Pierce's long deceased wife who used the occasion in an attempt to snatch Pierce.Not to mention the groom-to-be who discovered his choice for life was his best male friend rather than the bride.It all ended up with the respective parents of the to-be-wed couple became a twosome.Any love story requires the viewers to feel the presence of love, the tenderness of love, the urgency of love and the longing for love.You may find some in this film but you are not there and you don't feel it.There is no chemistry between Trine (who looked uncomfortable in most of tender scenes) and Pierce (who tried hard to be gallant and doing his best).This is not a good or successful romantic comedy.",2,An Uncomfortable Film to Sit Through,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,1531,"['Susanne', 'Bier', 'acclaimed', 'Danish', 'director', 'almost', 'never', 'made', 'bad', 'films.I', 'have', 'seen', 'liked', 'many', 'films', 'Better', 'World', 'Wedding', 'Brothers', 'Open', 'Heart', 'exceptional', 'quality', 'films.Trine', 'Dyrholm', 'veteran', 'Danish', 'actor', 'many', 'quality', 'films.And', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'played', 'romantic', 'lead.The', 'background', 'was', 'Sorrento', 'Italy', 'summer', 'lemon', 'orchard', 'where', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'childrenwere', 'getting', 'married.When', 'Pierce', 'Trine', 'first', 'met', 'Trine', 'head', 'was', 'bald', 'due', 'chemo.And', 'fell', 'love', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'Pierce', 'long', 'suffering', 'widower', 'was', 'attracted', 'Trine', 'still', 'marriedmother', 'bride-to-be', 'overweight', 'husband', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'caught', 'living', 'room', 'sofa', 'much', 'youngerstaff', 'brought', 'along', 'wedding', 'Then', 'annoying', 'sister', 'Pierce', 'long', 'deceased', 'wife', 'who', 'used', 'occasion', 'attempt', 'snatch', 'Pierce.Not', 'mention', 'groom-to-be', 'who', 'discovered', 'choice', 'life', 'was', 'best', 'male', 'friend', 'rather', 'bride.It', 'ended', 'up', 'respective', 'parents', 'to-be-wed', 'couple', 'became', 'twosome.Any', 'love', 'story', 'viewers', 'feel', 'presence', 'love', 'tenderness', 'love', 'urgency', 'love', 'longing', 'love.You', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'it.There', 'chemistry', 'Trine', 'who', 'looked', 'uncomfortable', 'most', 'tender', 'scenes', 'Pierce', 'who', 'tried', 'hard', 'be', 'gallant', 'doing', 'best', '.This', 'not', 'good', 'successful', 'romantic', 'comedy']",N/A

1635647,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00BM9T27K,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 5]","LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED (Orig. title ""Den skaldede frisr"" (lit. ""The Bald Hairdresser""), 2012, 115 minutes, in Danish and 'Pierce Brosnan English', subtitled) was an odd film to enjoy--which I did. Yet it shows an awful lack of good direction and a boring, disappointing lack of character chemistry.Guess I should begin by pointing out to certain dummies that being a Danish film, this movie is in the Danish language. There is virtually NO Italian spoken here, and only a couple of actors speak English once in a while--except for Brosnan, who had the cojones to learn to sing for one movie, but apparently could not deal with Danish in order to speak it in this film.Grumpy expat widower/tycoon Philip (Pierce Brosnan, hey, what the heck's HE even doing in this??) bumps into a frazzled Danish housewife Ida (a very familiar-looking Dane, Trine Dyrholm) as they encounter an unfortunate little fender-bender in Copenhagen. As it happens, Philip's son (a very gay/gorgeous Sebastian Jessen) is marrying Ida's daughter (the stunning Molly Blixt Egelind).Flying to Philip's old villa in Italy, where the young couple is living, Philip and Ida get somewhat acquainted. As everything and people's lives start to come undone at the seams, Philip falls in love with Ida. All that and the guests have only just started to arrive for the big wedding. So, this might have been a good family film but it has some raunchy comic moments that make that impossible. It could have been a gently funny romance, but the chemistry between Brosnan and Dyrholm is more like chemo.The acting, though generally superb, is aimless and the characters simply do not click at all. I mean to say, characters have to click, in the way we see families and friends click in real life--or the thing stinks then falls flat. Which, sadly, this film does again and again ... and I would say I actually waited a good hour for it to improve and liven a little.However, some weird, voyeuristic quality within me kept me watching. Aside from the characters being directed to display dopey, inappropriate grins at regular intervals, they did their professional best here. It is the director who ought to be ashamed for really wrecking a great film idea and storylines that should have cleverly interwoven instead of hanging there like Lazarus' shroud-threads.Northern European film just does not seem capable of the warmth that Americans and even British film almost always has. Everyone is so robotic that the only true passion I sensed was when Jessen has a romantic kiss with the one he really loves, Alessandro (a cute Italian fellow named Ciro Petrone--and that's right, I said ""fellow"").So what this essentially works out to: an amateurish, sloppy attempt to copy just about every good film plus attain the fun and glee I so loved inMamma Mia! The Movie(see my review) while trying to rob the character richness ofLove Actually. The only real joy in this film was the presence of young Jessen and Petrone. I'd have preferred the bravery of a film treating with THEIR wedding instead of this stupid, sneak stab at young gay love and the awful flop of approaching middle age.See this if you must; I can't find much to recommend it but I liked it well enough to sit through it. It is such a grand-scale failure it may be worth your time. The only thing of which I am certain is this is, cinematically, one of the worst films I've ever seen due to all its failures.

In a story that could have become Hallmarky, Bier is able to score with just the right amount of human need, sentiment and reality testing that makes this little film win.In Denmark, a hairdresser - very significant occupation we'll find - named Ida (Trine Dyrholm) has just finished post mastectomy carcinoma treatments yet when she goes home to share the news with her husband Leif (Kim Bodnia) en flagrante with a young chick form work and leaves her loutish husband to his life choices. Also living in Denmark is wealthy Englishman Phillip, a middle aged, estranged man still angry at the world for the loss of his wife, leaving him to raise his Patrick (Sebastian Jessen)? Patrick plans to marry Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind) who happens to be the daughter of Ida. The fates of these two souls are about to intertwine as they embark for a trip to Italy to attend the wedding of Patrick and Astrid, to be staged in Philip's villa with the aid of his sister-in-law Benedikte (Paprike Steen) who has always had eyes for Philip, a thwarted romantic delusion. All eyes are on the wedding Patrick has meticulously planned but eventually takes a turn when Patrick finally admits his same sex feelings, and his thawing father falls in love with the emotionally fragile but captivating Ida. It's a story about seeking love and having the courage to change your life - even when you think it's too late.So many threads to this story but Susanne Bier has tied them together nicely - not providing a Hollywood ending but leaving us with thoughts about how circumstances can alter the way we have been unsuccessfully viewing life.

""Den skaldede frisr"" (English captions) is a Danish film about a hairdresser who has been fighting breast cancer. After a partial mastectomy and chemo, she gets the all-clear, but comes home only to discover her husband having a fling with a co-worker. Problem is, next week they are flying from Denmark to Italy for their daughter's wedding. Of course Dean Martin's ""That's Amore"" underscores the opening credits.Writer Suzanne Bier (""After the Wedding"" - terrific by the way!) directed this award-winning romance that features:* Trine Dyrholm (""The Royal Affair"") is Ida, the bald hairdresser (nice wig though) who has to confront one serious upset after another. She's the mother of the bride.* Pierce Brosnan (""The Ghost Writer"") is Philip, a highly successful international trader of fresh fruits and vegetables. It's his Italian villa where the wedding party convenes. He's the widowed father of the groom.* Sebastian Jessen (""Almost Perfect"") is Patrick, the groom...but he's starting to wonder....* Molly Blixt Egelind (""Rebounce"") is Astrid, the bride. The groom's wondering is making her start to wonder...* Paprika Steen (""Keep the Lights On"") is Benedikte, the worst sister-in-law EVER!Things get off to a bad start when the mother of the bride backs her car into the father of the groom's car at the airport in Copenhagen. Then they are on the same flight but HER luggage gets lost. Finally, her wandering husband brings along his new sweetheart to Italy because she missed her flight back to Denmark. (She introduces herself as his ""fianc&eacute;e."")I'll bet you have it all figured out, don't you? Well, you don't. I love it when things become unpredictable, and they do!

The attractive young coworker who is sleeping with the husband/dad is an insensitive, superficial, dumb, slut. Go ahead and enjoy hating her! It's pandering in the worst way.

Oleson,"[1, 1]","Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier (""Brothers"") lighten things up a bit with this romantic comedy geared toward the AARP set (that would include me).  While the film uses up all the clich&eacute;s of the genre, it has more than enough going for it for a recommendation.One of those is Trine Dyrholm who plays Ida, an attractive middle aged Danish woman who has just completed cancer treatments and is awaiting her prognosis.  Her daughter Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind) is in Italy preparing for a wedding to Patrick (Sebastian Jessen).  When Ida returns home unexpectedly, she finds her husband Marco (Marco D'Amore) in the sack with one of his young secretaries (Paprika Steen).Separately Marco and Ida head for Italy for the wedding.  At the airport, Ida manages to crash her car into one driven by Philip (Pierce Brosnan) who unbeknownst to Ida is Patrick's father.  Still languishing over his wife's death years earlier, Philip is a bit of a bastard.  Both to his employees at a fruit wholesaling business and to anyone else who gets in his way.  He's aloof, stoic and likes it that way.Once everyone arrives in Italy the various couplings begin and end as you might forecast.  Things are complicated by the fact that Philip owns the lemon-groved estate where he first met his wife 20 years earlier.  And to add to the complications, grumblings between the betrothed children may be more than typical wedding jitters.  I would also point out that the comedy portion of this alleged rom-com film is almost non-existent.  Sure Ida is a bit quirky but the humor is mostly focused on the estranged Marco bringing his sexy secretary to the affair.What gets you hooked early on is some beautiful photography of the Italian coast.  The small town vistas are to die for and Bier and her cinematographer have an excellent eye.  This is all captured nicely in the Blu ray transfer which comes with 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are gorgeous as are skin tones.  Detail is excellent and the film has wonderful shadings as the scenes transition between day and night.  Dark blacks abound and the ocean blues are perfectly set.  The audio is excellent as well as ambient sounds are abundant.  But this is a dialog heavy film so expect a consistently placed center channel.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is in Danish and English and a little Italian with appropriate subtitles (English, French, and English SDH).

The actors were okay. How can you can this movie romantic? In the opening scene the husband is having sex with a much younger co-worker while his wife is visiting her doctor for her chemo treatment. Then late in the movie the groom is kissing his best friend before his wedding. It was very hard to like most of the characters. What a waste of time! It could have been a lovely romantic movie. I've watch thousands of movies and this was very disappointing. I am glad that I watched it before offering it to my friends. I will get rid of it as soon as possible.

However, I encourage you to give this one a try.  It's rare to see a movie portray people and their interactions in such a believable and unpredictable manner, rather than having the characters dancing around like puppets in service to the screen play's awkward bends and twists. You may not find any laugh out loud funny parts, but plenty of warm, family interactions and heartfelt conversations, not always pleasant. The female lead is very appealing, a cancer survivor (she hopes), estranged from her husband, who meets the widowed father of her daughter's fiance as wedding preparations are underway in Italy. There's a beautiful setting, on the Amalfi coast somewhere (I believe) and a number of interesting, well-rounded characters. The father, played by Pierce Brosnan, is initially sketched in a conventional and somewhat cliched manner, someone who withdraws into his work and away from his son after the death of his wife.. However, his awakening under the influence of the bride's mother is believable and touching.",4,Romantic dramedy - for grownups,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,1133,"['So', 'here', 'Danish', 'film', 'English', 'dialog', 'apparently', 'deal', 'breaker', 'folks', 'However', 'encourage', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'rare', 'see', 'movie', 'portray', 'people', 'interactions', 'such', 'believable', 'unpredictable', 'manner', 'rather', 'having', 'characters', 'dancing', 'puppets', 'service', 'screen', 'play', 'awkward', 'bends', 'twists', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'parts', 'plenty', 'warm', 'family', 'interactions', 'heartfelt', 'conversations', 'not', 'always', 'pleasant', 'female', 'lead', 'very', 'appealing', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'estranged', 'husband', 'who', 'widowed', 'father', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'wedding', 'preparations', 'are', 'underway', 'Italy', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'Amalfi', 'coast', 'somewhere', 'believe', 'number', 'interesting', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'father', 'played', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'initially', 'sketched', 'conventional', 'somewhat', 'cliched', 'manner', 'someone', 'who', 'work', 'away', 'son', 'death', 'wife..', 'However', 'awakening', 'influence', 'bride', 'mother', 'believable', 'touching']",N/A
