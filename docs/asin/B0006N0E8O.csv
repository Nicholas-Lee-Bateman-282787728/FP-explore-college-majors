Many lessons to be learned here and I give kudos to the showing of senators and representatives trying to stop NAFTA. Amazing that they are the same people that media portrays in a negative light today but were abslutely correct in regards to NAFTA and its aftermath.,5,Insightful,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,353,"['Very', 'insightful', 'unbiased', 'look', 'what', 'state', 'American', 'job', 'market', 'Many', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'give', 'kudos', 'showing', 'senators', 'representatives', 'trying', 'stop', 'NAFTA', 'Amazing', 'are', 'same', 'people', 'media', 'portrays', 'negative', 'light', 'today', 'were', 'abslutely', 'correct', 'regards', 'NAFTA', 'aftermath']",N/A

The average American has not had the chance to participate in REAL discussions about the economy because the ""big picture"" is seldom discussed by media. The truth is that the slide to second world status began with NAFTA and the out-sourcing of American jobs, first to Mexico and then to the Pacific rim. Mr Spotts film tried to wake us up to the facts years ago...but hardly any one listened. We were too comfortable with our full pocket books to care what was happening around us.His film shows how American workers were laid off and/or forced to train replacements in other countries as we began to bleed jobs from both ends of the economy. Manufacturing was the first to go followed by jobs in engineering and computer technology. While corporations got rich reaping the profits of slave labor in Third World countries, we participated in our own demise by buying the items we once produced from global marketers like Walmart. Spotts has done an excellent job of cataloging the damage via interviews with the people most affected.  A must needed education that many of you will see too late.",5,Its not just Banking that is in trouble in the US!!,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,1172,"['current', 'Banking', 'crisis', 'being', 'made', 'catch', 'many', 'problems', 'average', 'American', 'not', 'had', 'chance', 'participate', 'REAL', 'discussions', 'economy', 'big', 'picture', 'seldom', 'discussed', 'media', 'truth', 'slide', 'second', 'world', 'status', 'began', 'NAFTA', 'out-sourcing', 'American', 'jobs', 'first', 'Mexico', 'then', 'Pacific', 'rim', 'Mr', 'Spotts', 'film', 'tried', 'wake', 'up', 'facts', 'years', 'ago', 'hardly', 'one', 'listened', 'were', 'too', 'comfortable', 'full', 'pocket', 'books', 'care', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'us.His', 'film', 'how', 'American', 'workers', 'were', 'laid', 'off', 'and/or', 'forced', 'train', 'replacements', 'other', 'countries', 'began', 'bleed', 'jobs', 'ends', 'economy', 'Manufacturing', 'was', 'first', 'go', 'followed', 'jobs', 'engineering', 'computer', 'technology', 'corporations', 'got', 'rich', 'reaping', 'profits', 'slave', 'labor', 'Third', 'World', 'countries', 'participated', 'own', 'demise', 'buying', 'items', 'once', 'produced', 'global', 'marketers', 'Walmart', 'Spotts', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'cataloging', 'damage', 'interviews', 'people', 'most', 'affected', 'must', 'needed', 'education', 'many', 'will', 'see', 'too', 'late']",N/A

It does a good job in presenting the story, one that should be considered, in a straightforward style that is easy to understand.

I really liked how it showed both the blue-collar, and white-collar, worker, and how they are steadily losing their jobs to offshoring and outsourcing.  What I don't get about what the corporations are doing is that don't they realize they are only hurting themselves?  If they continue to lay off American labor in favor of foreign workers, then how will Americans be able to afford the products that are being sent back into this country for the consumer to buy?  Do I smell eventual economic collapse?  It is a sad day in America....and this documentary shows that we need to do something about NAFTA and outsourcing before it is too late for our country, and economy, to recover.

I'm going to give ""American Jobs"" an additional star though, because it does offer an important look into the outsourcing issue, and touches on global trade policies.There is a great deal of discussion regarding ""neoconservatives"" these days, and deservedly so; but we also need to inform ourselves of ""neoliberal"" economics, which tear down protections countries utilize to protect local economies and also privatizes public services and jobs.  The Wikipedia review of ""neoliberal economics"" and the writings of Noam Chomsky cover some of the problems with this corporatist agenda that's harming so many people all over the world.For a DVD that includes the concerns of people in sweatshops in Mexico and China, I'd recommend ""Wal Mart: The High Cost of Low Prices.""  It appears that since we have multinational corporations and financial institutions, there will need to be a larger multinational labor and human rights movement.  The inspirational documentary ""The Fourth World War"" includes amazing footage of grassroots struggles around the world.  As they increasingly network and operate in solidarity, the world will become a more just place. The ""World Social Forum"" is one such effort.",3,"Flawed, but still useful for understanding job flight",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,1286,"['share', 'criticisms', 'film', 'Thomas', 'Fackler', 'customer', 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'American', 'Jobs', 'additional', 'star', 'offer', 'important', 'look', 'outsourcing', 'issue', 'touches', 'global', 'trade', 'great', 'deal', 'discussion', 'regarding', 'neoconservatives', 'days', 'deservedly', 'so', 'also', 'need', 'inform', 'ourselves', 'neoliberal', 'economics', 'tear', 'down', 'protections', 'countries', 'utilize', 'protect', 'local', 'economies', 'also', 'public', 'services', 'jobs', 'Wikipedia', 'review', 'neoliberal', 'economics', 'writings', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'cover', 'problems', 'corporatist', 'agenda', 'harming', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'world.For', 'DVD', 'concerns', 'people', 'sweatshops', 'Mexico', 'China', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'High', 'Cost', 'Low', 'Prices', 'have', 'multinational', 'corporations', 'financial', 'institutions', 'will', 'need', 'be', 'larger', 'multinational', 'labor', 'human', 'rights', 'movement', 'inspirational', 'documentary', 'Fourth', 'World', 'War', 'amazing', 'footage', 'grassroots', 'struggles', 'world', 'increasingly', 'network', 'operate', 'solidarity', 'world', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'just', 'place', 'World', 'Social', 'Forum', 'one', 'such', 'effort']",N/A
