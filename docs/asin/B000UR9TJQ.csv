Then they take bodys and throw  them in dumpers.And those empoyees have been arested for animal cruelty .Ingrid newkirk knew  about it and was for it.

1096206,A12IRGQLFE4EBA,B000UR9TJQ,"Fabulinus ""To err is human. To forgive for no...","[6, 11]","The DVD ""I Am an Animal"" is a riveting look at one of the founders of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the cause that moves her to get up everyday and come to work for a very average working wage.  It not only shows you the inner workings of Ingrid Newkirk's mind, but gives you insight into the way others in the fight for animal rights regard her and the PETA organization.  I thought it was extremely brave of the producers of ""I Am an Animal"" to give such massive airtime and footage to PETA's detractors which tells me how seriously PETA does in fact take its work.  Ingrid and the organization are not ashamed to show all of what and who they are.  Their primary goal is to show the naked truth of how all animals are perceived and therefore treated in human culture... which is poorly.This dvd is not for the faint of heart.  I choked back tears many times throughout, but walked away with such reverence for Ms. Newkirk, PETA and their work.  What will be most surprising and a question for you to ask yourself is how could you walk away unchanged after seeing it?  Hopefully change will be afoot.",5,Balanced and Fair,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,1127,"['DVD', 'Am', 'Animal', 'riveting', 'look', 'one', 'founders', 'People', 'Ethical', 'Treatment', 'Animals', 'PETA', 'cause', 'get', 'up', 'everyday', 'come', 'work', 'very', 'average', 'working', 'wage', 'not', 'only', 'inner', 'workings', 'Ingrid', 'Newkirk', 'mind', 'insight', 'way', 'others', 'fight', 'animal', 'rights', 'regard', 'PETA', 'organization', 'thought', 'was', 'extremely', 'brave', 'producers', 'Am', 'Animal', 'give', 'such', 'massive', 'airtime', 'footage', 'PETA', 'detractors', 'how', 'seriously', 'PETA', 'fact', 'take', 'work', 'Ingrid', 'organization', 'are', 'not', 'ashamed', 'show', 'what', 'who', 'are', 'primary', 'goal', 'show', 'naked', 'truth', 'how', 'animals', 'are', 'perceived', 'therefore', 'treated', 'human', 'culture', 'poorly.This', 'dvd', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'choked', 'back', 'tears', 'many', 'times', 'walked', 'away', 'such', 'reverence', 'Ms.', 'Newkirk', 'PETA', 'work', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'surprising', 'question', 'ask', 'how', 'could', 'walk', 'away', 'unchanged', 'seeing', 'Hopefully', 'change', 'will', 'be', 'afoot']",I am an Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA

1096208,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000UR9TJQ,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[11, 19]","While it seems that all of the reviews before me gave this documentary five stars for the bravery, willpower and commitment of Ingrid Newkirk, I have to say that my reasoning for giving it five stars is a little different.  First of all let it be known that I agree with Newkirk and PETA that there are many horrible things happening to animals throughout the world.  I also agree that mankind should step up to protect these animals as best as we can.  However, I highly disagree with Newkirk's attention-getting tactics.  From naked running of the humans to caged humans protesting a circus to ""Un-Happy Meals"" to vandalizing storefronts, PETA is, at times, a borderline cult.  This documentary highlights the sometimes tasteless and illegal tactics used by the group to promote their message.  I completely understand attacking sacred cows, but any advertising class will inform you that such actions can produce results on both ends of the spectrum.  Representatives of other animal rights groups such as the Humane Society are interviewed as well as the now-departed co-founder of PETA, Alex Pacheco.  All of them call into question the motives and the actions of Newkirk and her group.A revealing expose of Butterball and ConAgra is also shown.  It shows the process that PETA goes through in order to get inside a slaughterhouse and what they do in order to gather evidence to form a case against the company.  We also get to see a freed turkey from the Butterball plant live in a containment room until a home is found for it.  The oddity of it all is that Newkirk and the investigator leave the turkey alone in a brightly lit room with soothing sounds playing in the background.We also get a glimpse at the ""look at me"" crowd in Hollywood basically using Newkirk and PETA to gain exposure.  Bill Maher, who's responses to questions in this documentary draw doubts about his sanity, is also highlighted.A possible connection between PETA and animal rights terrorist groups such as the E.L.F. and A.L.F. is also explored, although PETA completely denies any direct affiliation with such groups.As much as ""I Am A Friend Of God"" tries to show the extremes of fundamentalist Christians in the United States, ""I Am An Animal"" shows the extremes of the animal rights movement.  While there are definitely some terrible things happening to animals in the world and groups such as the Humane Society are trying to put a stop to them rationally, this documentary shows us just how irrational and, dare I say, semi-psychotic some animal rights activists can be.I highly recommend this documentary.  It does move the viewer to want to go out and help an animal, but I don't think that PETA is taking the proper action to get things corrected.",5,A Revealing Look At A Controversial Woman And Organization,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,2740,"['reviews', 'gave', 'documentary', 'five', 'stars', 'bravery', 'willpower', 'commitment', 'Ingrid', 'Newkirk', 'have', 'say', 'reasoning', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'little', 'different', 'First', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'agree', 'Newkirk', 'PETA', 'are', 'many', 'horrible', 'things', 'happening', 'animals', 'world', 'also', 'agree', 'mankind', 'should', 'step', 'up', 'protect', 'animals', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'However', 'highly', 'disagree', 'Newkirk', 'attention-getting', 'tactics', 'naked', 'running', 'humans', 'caged', 'humans', 'protesting', 'circus', 'Un-Happy', 'Meals', 'vandalizing', 'storefronts', 'PETA', 'times', 'borderline', 'cult', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'sometimes', 'tasteless', 'illegal', 'tactics', 'used', 'group', 'promote', 'message', 'completely', 'understand', 'attacking', 'sacred', 'cows', 'advertising', 'class', 'will', 'inform', 'such', 'actions', 'can', 'produce', 'results', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'Representatives', 'other', 'animal', 'rights', 'groups', 'such', 'Humane', 'Society', 'are', 'interviewed', 'as', 'well', 'now-departed', 'co-founder', 'PETA', 'Alex', 'Pacheco', 'call', 'question', 'motives', 'actions', 'Newkirk', 'group.A', 'revealing', 'expose', 'Butterball', 'ConAgra', 'also', 'shown', 'process', 'PETA', 'order', 'get', 'slaughterhouse', 'what', 'do', 'order', 'gather', 'evidence', 'form', 'case', 'company', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'freed', 'turkey', 'Butterball', 'plant', 'live', 'containment', 'room', 'home', 'found', 'oddity', 'Newkirk', 'investigator', 'leave', 'turkey', 'alone', 'brightly', 'lit', 'room', 'soothing', 'sounds', 'playing', 'background.We', 'also', 'get', 'glimpse', 'look', 'crowd', 'Hollywood', 'basically', 'using', 'Newkirk', 'PETA', 'gain', 'exposure', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'who', 'responses', 'questions', 'documentary', 'draw', 'doubts', 'sanity', 'also', 'highlighted.A', 'possible', 'connection', 'PETA', 'animal', 'rights', 'terrorist', 'groups', 'such', 'E.L.F', 'A.L.F', 'also', 'explored', 'PETA', 'completely', 'direct', 'affiliation', 'such', 'groups.As', 'much', 'Am', 'Friend', 'God', 'tries', 'show', 'extremes', 'fundamentalist', 'Christians', 'United', 'States', 'Am', 'Animal', 'extremes', 'animal', 'rights', 'movement', 'are', 'definitely', 'terrible', 'things', 'happening', 'animals', 'world', 'groups', 'such', 'Humane', 'Society', 'are', 'trying', 'put', 'stop', 'rationally', 'documentary', 'just', 'how', 'irrational', 'dare', 'say', 'semi-psychotic', 'animal', 'rights', 'activists', 'can', 'be.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'move', 'viewer', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'help', 'animal', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'PETA', 'taking', 'proper', 'action', 'get', 'things', 'corrected']",I am an Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA
1096209,A1TUDEC66M9FO3,B000UR9TJQ,Preston C. Enright,"[6, 13]","I monitor a lot of right-wing talk radio, and I've noticed how often PETA and Ingrid Newkirk are targets of their derision.  The reason is that they are threats to the markets and profits of the  meat industry, as well as those who make money off of selling animals for demonic tests that Nazi doctors like Mengele would appreciate.Newkirk has created an organization that is extremely effective.  Not only have they ended unnecessary experimentation, and helped to create less savage conditions in some meat processing plants, they've moved many people to vegetarianism and have expanded the meat-free options on menus across the country.  They have also helped spur the growth of the ""free range"" chicken market, and customers of businesses around the world are pushing for ever more considerate behavior of animals.In ""I Am an Animal,"" Ingrid challenges all sorts of sacred cows of our society, including our obsession with sex, and the desire of so many people to have kids when there are already so many children who need homes.  She says something like, ""I think it's very selfish of people to need a replica of themselves when there are so many children without parents.""  Newkirk, who was once married herself, says her marriage ended because she ""simply didn't have the time for it,"" and instead chose to dedicate her life to reducing the suffering of sentient beings.  Buddha would be proud.  We need more people like her.Kudos to HBO for producing this important film, and to those who will use this DVD as a tool to inspire awareness and change in others.For some other animal related DVDs:VarmintsKilling Coyoteand sustainabletablemovie.comA great magazine on vegetarianism:VegNewsAnd a documentary that explains why organizations like PETA are so hated by Big Business:The Corporation",5,Challenging the meat industry.,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1798,"['monitor', 'lot', 'right-wing', 'talk', 'radio', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'how', 'often', 'PETA', 'Ingrid', 'Newkirk', 'are', 'targets', 'derision', 'reason', 'are', 'threats', 'markets', 'profits', 'meat', 'industry', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'make', 'money', 'selling', 'animals', 'demonic', 'tests', 'Nazi', 'doctors', 'Mengele', 'would', 'appreciate.Newkirk', 'created', 'organization', 'extremely', 'effective', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'ended', 'unnecessary', 'experimentation', 'helped', 'create', 'less', 'savage', 'conditions', 'meat', 'processing', 'plants', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'many', 'people', 'vegetarianism', 'have', 'expanded', 'meat-free', 'options', 'menus', 'country', 'have', 'also', 'helped', 'spur', 'growth', 'free', 'range', 'chicken', 'market', 'customers', 'businesses', 'world', 'are', 'pushing', 'ever', 'more', 'considerate', 'behavior', 'animals.In', 'Am', 'Animal', 'Ingrid', 'sorts', 'sacred', 'cows', 'society', 'including', 'obsession', 'sex', 'desire', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'kids', 'when', 'are', 'already', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'who', 'need', 'homes', 'something', 'think', 'very', 'selfish', 'people', 'need', 'replica', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'parents', 'Newkirk', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'married', 'marriage', 'ended', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'instead', 'chose', 'dedicate', 'life', 'reducing', 'suffering', 'sentient', 'beings', 'Buddha', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'need', 'more', 'people', 'her.Kudos', 'HBO', 'producing', 'important', 'film', 'who', 'will', 'use', 'DVD', 'tool', 'inspire', 'awareness', 'change', 'other', 'animal', 'related', 'DVDs', 'VarmintsKilling', 'Coyoteand', 'great', 'magazine', 'vegetarianism', 'VegNewsAnd', 'documentary', 'why', 'organizations', 'PETA', 'are', 'so', 'hated', 'Big', 'Business', 'Corporation']",I am an Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA
