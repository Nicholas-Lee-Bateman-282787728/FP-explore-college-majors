119579,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,0790749351,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[1, 1]","This is one of those""Timeless"" comedies, one that never seems to grow old.In his most famous role, Paul Reubens stars as Pee-Wee Herman, an eccentric boy whose one passion in his life is his bicycle. He lives with his dog, Speck, and seems to have a care-free existence, until the day his treasured bike is stolen. He then embarks on a cross-country journey to find it, and meets a variety of people, some friendly, some not, and gets into various scrapes as well. Of course, in time he gets it back, and becomes a minor celebrity in the process.This is one of those movies that has SO MANY layers in the screenplay, it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it. On the surface, it is chock full of sight gags and puns, and within the first few minutes, you see a brilliant Rube Goldberg invention that prepares breakfast for our hero as he brushes his teeth and gets ready to greet the day. Yes, it's silly, but that's what attracts younger viewers, and the depth is what draws the adult segment of the audience into it. The breakfast segment is pure genius. The rapid-fire jokes and such keep one amused as a sinister plot develops. Pee-Wee's nemesis, a spoiled rich boy named Francis Buxton covets the bike, and since it's his birthday, he offers to buy the bike from Pee-Wee. Of course, the offer is declined, and the story takes a turn as Francis says, ""...You'll be SORRY, Pee-Wee Herman!!!"" Covering his own tracks, he pays some punk to steal the bike, but decides he doesn't want it anymore. The theft puts Pee-Wee on a cross-country journey, as stated earlier, and the art of parody comes into play. Literally every genre of film is lampooned as he thumbs a ride from an escaped convict, and they get past a police force's roadblock in disguise. He gets a ride with a truck driver who turns out to be a ghost, he eats a meal in a diner where they fear this ghost, and so on. To name it all, would be very time-consuming, and spoiling to anyone who hasn't seen this comedy masterpiece, if any such people exist. And if you haven't seen this, it's probably because you never watch movies or have never owned a TV.It's a little overkill, reviewing this movie after so long, and after so many people have seen it, so many times, but it is a bit of nostalgia, and if you try to put your pride aside, and distance yourself from Reubens' recent exploits, it will be the fastest hour-and-a-half in your day.""...I know you are, but what am I?...""",5,"After twenty-odd years, still funny!",1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,2451,"['one', 'Timeless', 'comedies', 'one', 'never', 'grow', 'old.In', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'Pee-Wee', 'Herman', 'eccentric', 'boy', 'one', 'passion', 'life', 'bicycle', 'dog', 'Speck', 'have', 'care-free', 'existence', 'day', 'treasured', 'bike', 'stolen', 'then', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'find', 'variety', 'people', 'friendly', 'not', 'various', 'scrapes', 'well', 'course', 'time', 'back', 'minor', 'celebrity', 'process.This', 'one', 'movies', 'SO', 'MANY', 'layers', 'screenplay', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'surface', 'chock', 'full', 'sight', 'gags', 'puns', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'see', 'brilliant', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'invention', 'breakfast', 'hero', 'teeth', 'ready', 'greet', 'day', 'Yes', 'silly', 'what', 'younger', 'viewers', 'depth', 'what', 'adult', 'segment', 'audience', 'breakfast', 'segment', 'pure', 'genius', 'rapid-fire', 'jokes', 'such', 'keep', 'one', 'amused', 'sinister', 'plot', 'Pee-Wee', 'nemesis', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'boy', 'named', 'Francis', 'Buxton', 'bike', 'birthday', 'buy', 'bike', 'Pee-Wee', 'course', 'offer', 'declined', 'story', 'turn', 'Francis', ""'ll"", 'be', 'SORRY', 'Pee-Wee', 'Herman', 'Covering', 'own', 'tracks', 'punk', 'steal', 'bike', ""n't"", 'want', 'anymore', 'theft', 'Pee-Wee', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'stated', 'earlier', 'art', 'parody', 'play', 'Literally', 'genre', 'film', 'lampooned', 'ride', 'escaped', 'convict', 'get', 'police', 'force', 'roadblock', 'disguise', 'ride', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'ghost', 'meal', 'diner', 'where', 'fear', 'ghost', 'so', 'name', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'time-consuming', 'spoiling', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'such', 'people', 'exist', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'owned', 'TV.It', 'little', 'overkill', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'try', 'put', 'pride', 'aside', 'distance', 'Reubens', 'recent', 'exploits', 'will', 'be', 'fastest', 'hour-and-a-half', 'day', 'know', 'are', 'what', 'am']",N/A

119581,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,0790749351,AKN,"[0, 0]","I love PeeWee Herman for his flat out silliness. Poor guy got a bad rap and ruined career for being busted in that porn theater, which most people agreed should have never have happened.This child like character in his too small glen plaid suit, white tassle loafers, and red bow tie, gets his tricked out antique Schwinn bike stolen and goes on a journey to the Alamo to try to retrieve it.He minces around like he's holding a drinking glass between his legs as he hitch hikes around town looking for it. Sort of reminds me of the young silly Jerry Lewis in The Bellboy. A sissified, skinny,goofy guy misadventuring his way through a life of run ins withodd characters.This is a pleasant movie to watch when you are a bit down and taking things too seriously. I must say I got pretty bored by the end as a little PeeWee Herman goes a long way.Paul Reubens, the former Paul Reubenfeld, aka PeeWee Herman, was a great comedian, beloved in his time in the 1980's and 1990's. He earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, had a hit TV show for six years that earned twelve emmy awards, was in at least half a dozen movies since he gave up the PeeWee Herman character, including one of my favorites, Blow, with Johnny Depp, and has had stage performances to sell out crowds as his PeeWee Herman character.He stayed in character as PeeWee always during his almost twenty years playing that character, and people wondered if he was reallylike that and that was his real name. By the time he got arrested in the porn movie theater for lewd acts he was ready to give up the character anyway. The arrest affected him greatly and sent him into a deep depression for years, during which he was not seen much in public.This movie is fun to watch and should especially appeal to children.PeeWee smiles, laughs and minces his way throughout the movie, having adventures everywhere he goes. It's not a great movie but it's entertaining for the most part if you are the type who doesn't need to be serious all the time. PeeWee's home decor is a retro delight complete with a Rube Goldberg breakfast making machine.I saw this with my Amazon Prime account for free.",4,Mildy amusing silliness,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,2149,"['love', 'PeeWee', 'Herman', 'flat', 'out', 'silliness', 'Poor', 'guy', 'got', 'bad', 'rap', 'ruined', 'career', 'being', 'busted', 'porn', 'theater', 'most', 'people', 'agreed', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'have', 'happened.This', 'child', 'character', 'too', 'small', 'glen', 'plaid', 'suit', 'white', 'tassle', 'loafers', 'red', 'bow', 'tie', 'tricked', 'out', 'antique', 'Schwinn', 'bike', 'stolen', 'journey', 'Alamo', 'try', 'retrieve', 'it.He', 'minces', 'holding', 'drinking', 'glass', 'legs', 'hikes', 'town', 'looking', 'Sort', 'reminds', 'young', 'silly', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'Bellboy', 'A', 'sissified', 'skinny', 'goofy', 'guy', 'misadventuring', 'way', 'life', 'run', 'ins', 'withodd', 'characters.This', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'watch', 'when', 'are', 'bit', 'down', 'taking', 'things', 'too', 'seriously', 'must', 'say', 'got', 'pretty', 'bored', 'end', 'little', 'PeeWee', 'Herman', 'long', 'way.Paul', 'Reubens', 'former', 'Paul', 'Reubenfeld', 'aka', 'PeeWee', 'Herman', 'was', 'great', 'comedian', 'beloved', 'time', '1980', '1990', 'earned', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'Walk', 'Fame', 'had', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'six', 'years', 'earned', 'twelve', 'emmy', 'awards', 'was', 'least', 'dozen', 'movies', 'gave', 'up', 'PeeWee', 'Herman', 'character', 'including', 'one', 'favorites', 'Blow', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'had', 'stage', 'performances', 'sell', 'out', 'crowds', 'PeeWee', 'Herman', 'stayed', 'character', 'PeeWee', 'always', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'playing', 'character', 'people', 'wondered', 'was', 'reallylike', 'was', 'real', 'name', 'time', 'got', 'arrested', 'porn', 'movie', 'theater', 'lewd', 'acts', 'was', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'character', 'anyway', 'arrest', 'affected', 'greatly', 'sent', 'deep', 'depression', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'seen', 'much', 'public.This', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'should', 'especially', 'appeal', 'children.PeeWee', 'smiles', 'laughs', 'minces', 'way', 'movie', 'having', 'adventures', 'everywhere', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'type', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'serious', 'time', 'PeeWee', 'home', 'decor', 'retro', 'delight', 'complete', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'breakfast', 'making', 'machine.I', 'saw', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'account', 'free']",N/A

Lazo,"[0, 0]","As a child, I loved this film for it's silly jokes and imaginative visuals.As an adult, and a daily bicyclist (commute and recreation), I love this film for Pee-Wee's perpetually youthful joie de vivre -- seeing every experience through the fresh perspective of the young-at-heart. Also, as an adult I'm able to appreciate the subtle innuendo (though very watered-down from his original stage shows) that I completely missed as a child.But one thing has always rung true with this film: it is a love-letter to bicycle ownership. It resonates with anyone who has ever put the time and effort into making a bike their own. I can empathize with the joy on Pee-Wee's face when he's on his bike. Perhaps most important of all is the pain at the loss of his bike. It is Pee-Wee's reaction to losing his bike that makes this movie, and it is the hyperbole of that reaction that makes it a story that can be fittingly told only through the medium of film. Pee-Wee feels the same pain that we do at losing his loved bike, but he is able to go beyond our real-life constraints and do what we all wish we could: hunt our beloved bike down, come hell or high water, and stop at NOTHING until we are reunited!Fun fact: during pre-production, Paul Rubens commented on how many people had their own studio bikes that they used to get around the expansive Warner Bros. lot. He was then presented with his very own Schwinn cruiser, which became the basis for Pee-Wee's bike -- and the entire story. Rubens recounts how he immediately went into his trailer, realizing he'd been writing the wrong story, and started over on the plot we now know and love. What's more, apparently that original bike given to Rubens was even used for some of the publicity photos for the film, perhaps explaining why the bike on the cover is so simply appointed when compared with the bike in the film.",5,Quite possibly the greatest bicycle film ever made.,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1864,"['child', 'loved', 'film', 'silly', 'jokes', 'imaginative', 'visuals.As', 'adult', 'daily', 'bicyclist', 'commute', 'recreation', 'love', 'film', 'Pee-Wee', 'perpetually', 'youthful', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'seeing', 'experience', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'young-at-heart', 'Also', 'adult', ""'m"", 'able', 'appreciate', 'subtle', 'innuendo', 'very', 'watered-down', 'original', 'stage', 'shows', 'completely', 'missed', 'child.But', 'one', 'thing', 'always', 'rung', 'true', 'film', 'love-letter', 'bicycle', 'ownership', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'put', 'time', 'effort', 'making', 'bike', 'own', 'can', 'empathize', 'joy', 'Pee-Wee', 'face', 'when', 'bike', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'pain', 'loss', 'bike', 'Pee-Wee', 'reaction', 'losing', 'bike', 'movie', 'hyperbole', 'reaction', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'fittingly', 'told', 'only', 'medium', 'film', 'Pee-Wee', 'feels', 'same', 'pain', 'do', 'losing', 'loved', 'bike', 'able', 'go', 'real-life', 'constraints', 'do', 'what', 'wish', 'could', 'hunt', 'beloved', 'down', 'come', 'hell', 'high', 'water', 'stop', 'NOTHING', 'are', 'reunited', 'Fun', 'fact', 'pre-production', 'Paul', 'Rubens', 'commented', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'own', 'studio', 'bikes', 'used', 'get', 'expansive', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'lot', 'was', 'then', 'presented', 'very', 'own', 'Schwinn', 'cruiser', 'became', 'basis', 'Pee-Wee', 'bike', 'entire', 'story', 'how', 'immediately', 'went', 'trailer', 'realizing', ""'d"", 'been', 'writing', 'wrong', 'story', 'started', 'plot', 'now', 'know', 'love', 'What', 'more', 'apparently', 'original', 'bike', 'given', 'Rubens', 'was', 'even', 'used', 'publicity', 'photos', 'film', 'perhaps', 'explaining', 'why', 'bike', 'cover', 'so', 'simply', 'appointed', 'when', 'compared', 'bike', 'film']",N/A

Unfortunately, their commentary becomes instead The Mutual Admiration  Society, with long stories about how they came across each other, how great  each thinks the other is, and who else was in the room when they met.  Reubens and Burton spend too much time telling stories that ramble and  don't go anywhere, and too little time commenting on the film  itself.When they DO manage to discuss the film, they are as interesting  as you would expect, but these instances are few and far between.  Burton  for the most part sounds like he just woke up, and Reubens spends a lot of  the film saying, &quot;Uh-huh, yeah.&quot;It's also rather appalling  that Reubens can hardly bring himself to say the name of fellow  screenwriter Phil Hartman (Reubens early on says &quot;me and the other two  guys who wrote the film...&quot;) -- in fact, you won't hear him mention  Hartman by name until the very end of the film when Hartman makes his  cameo.Some gentle prodding during the taping of this sequence would have  produced something that I think more fans were looking for and  expecting.Like some other reviewers, I too couldn't find some of the  knick-knacks promised in the pre-release.  However, the one real prize on  this disc is the alternate track isolating the music, with commentary by  Danny Elfman.  Elfman's insights into the film and its music are  first-rate, and while I'm pleased Elfman does NOT talk over his music, it  might have made it even more interesting had he discussed some of the  nuances of his work while the tracks were playing.The film quality on  the DVD is top-notch, and the menu screens are clever (when you make a  selection, Pee-wee goes speeding over to the new menu on his bike). The  film itself is brilliant -- no need on my part to give you a summary -- and  the widescreen format and new sound for this film alone would make the DVD  worth owning.  But with the exception of the Elfman alternative track, many  of the first-rate extras viewers are coming to expect in these packages  are, sadly, missing here.Five stars for the film itself, but a low two  for the extras, bringing this one to a soft three.

The directorial debut of one of the most influential directors in Hollywood: Tim Burton and an excellent tour de force performance by Paul Reubens as Pee Wee.  This wacky adventure begins with Pee Wee's discovery that his beloved bicycle has been stolen.  After receiving phony info from an even phonier(phonier?  not a word,  but it works!) fortune teller,  he sets off in search of his bike,  which is supposedly in the basement of the Alamo.  Off he goes on one of the funniest adventures ever captured on screen.  Paul Reubens is brilliant as Pee Wee Herman.  Elizabeth Daily makes a wonderful Dotty,  Pee Wee's would-be love interest. Mark Holton is great as Francis,  as well as Diane Salinger as the wanna-be French waitress Simone.  Judd Omen makes a great escaped-con Mickey,  who is the first to help Pee Wee out on his journey.  Also good are the small cameos by such stars as Ed Herlihy,  Cassandra Peterson(TV's  Elvira),  Alice Nunn,  Toru Tanaka,  Carmen Filpi, James Brolin,  Morgan Fairchild,  Milton Berle,  and the best cameo of all,  SNL's Jan Hooks.

Paul Reubens lives and breathes this role, (literally - he's credited for the role of Pee-Wee as ""himself"") and he couldn't have asked for a better partner than the similarly quirky, fringe-dwelling director Tim Burton (in his first major picture). Reubens is genuinely larger-than-life in this loose collection of vignettes and skits, with the whole mess tied together with all the care and subtlety of a spaceship made of duct tape and cardboard. Even when he's not making a direct footprint on the screen, Pee-Wee's influence is positively oozing out of each frame, coating everything from the scenery to the wardrobe to the manic, impulsive style of shooting. It's a perfect interpretation of the character's famous stage show, an ideal introduction for the unfamiliar masses, and a natural launchpad to super-stardom. I'll grant that it's not for everyone, but for those of us with an appreciation for drag queens, John Waters, the B-52's and sixties housewife chic, it's a direct hit. It's that rare crossroads where unbridled mayhem, conscienceless good times and hysterical laughter collide in a loud, twisted, dirty ball of pandemonium.

119611,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,0790749351,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[1, 2]","Back when I was a kid in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies.  Watching this movie again as an adult, this still holds up well.  It's only been a few years since I knew that Pee Wee's Big Adventure was Tim Burton's debut as a film maker, and after seeing it, it's really no wonder to me as to why Burton has become an acclaimed film maker in the movie world over the years.STORYThis movie is about a ""man-child"" named Pee Wee Herman (Paul Reubens).  Pee Wee absolutely loves his custom bike, and another man-child named Francis Buxton (Mark Holton) wants Pee Wee's bike, but Pee Wee rejects all of Francis's fiscal offers.  On a day out to the mall, Pee Wee's beloved bike gets stolen, and Pee Wee goes on a surreal adventure to find it.  On his adventure, he meets a smorgasbord of interesting people, including a Texan truckstop waitress named Simone that longs to go to France, a violent biker gang in Texas, and an escaped convict named Mickey.CHARACTERSOne of the strengths of this movie is the characters.  Pee Wee is well-portrayed as a man-child, since he obviously has the mind of a kid, but at the same time, doesn't push it to the point where he's annoying.  He's also portrayed as being coherent of the ""real"" world, but at the same time, has an air of childlike innocence to him.  Francis is great as the ""opposite"" to Pee Wee, as he's a spoiled brat with too much money, and it's pretty surreal to see him as a grown man and still need his dad to settle petty disputes and whatnot.  Dotty (Elizabeth Daily) is great as Pee Wee's love interest, and with Pee Wee being the man-child that he is, seems fairly resistant to her attempts at romantic advances.Even the minor characters are well done and have distinct personalities.  One of my favorite ""minor"" characters is Simone.  She's good as the waitress who has greater ambitions since she's afraid to pursue them and gets help from Pee Wee.  Similarly, there's a giant man named Andy, whom Simone has a reluctant relationship with, and he provides some good comic relief when he chases Pee Wee after he sees him with Simone.  Strangely enough, he bares a strong resemblance to Bluto from the Popeye cartoons.ACTINGThe acting in this movie was quite good.  Everybody did a good job with their roles, and the actors and actresses fit in their roles like keys in a keyhole.  Of course, Paul Reubens stole the show as Pee Wee, since you can tell that it's almost like he's made his own alter ego, which makes sense since the Pee Wee character was formed in 1977, so he's had a long time to develop the character like he's a separate person.HUMORWhat's an adventure comedy film without good humor?  Thankfully, the humor in this works well (other than a few parts that fall kinda flat).  A scene that I thought was quite funny was when Pee Wee accidentally steps on the toes of a violent biker gang in Texas, and he just acts politely in front of them, not knowing how dangerous they are.One of the most humorous and most exciting scenes in the movie is near the end, when Pee Wee attempts to get his bike back from the Warner Bros. Studio, which ends up in a grandiose chase scene.  In the chase scene, the Warner Bros. security staff go after him and in it, they crash through several movie sets including a Godzilla movie and a Christmas-themed movie.  It's quite a surreal thing to see a security officer in a prop boat with Godzilla in Santa's sleigh getting dragged behind.SPECIAL EFFECTSWhile this movie isn't the type that's heavily-dependent on special effects, there's some scenes that have some special effects implemented to enhance them.  One of the best effects in this movie is the ""Large Marge"" scene, where Pee Wee is picked up by a female truckdriver, and she tells the story of a horrific truck crash.  She makes a face that would feel right at home with Burton's future movies, Beetlejuice and A Nightmare Before Christmas.  There's also a scene where Pee Wee dreams of his bike being destroyed by nefarious clowns and of Francis dressed as the devil, and the set designs and makeup for the clowns look like something straight out of Burton's imagination, and they're all well done.SOUNDTRACKDanny Elfman made the soundtrack for this movie, and he did a marvelous job with it.  His compositions fit the moods of each scene so perfectly, and I think some of the best music he did in the movie is for the scene of Pee Wee's nightmare of his bike being destroyed, as it has a pretty dark tone to it, but at the same time, has a slight ""whimsical"" air to it.  Elfman started off on the right foot with this movie, though he'd master his musical craft in Burton's future films like Beetlejuice and his two Batman movies.FINAL WORDThis is a classic 80's adventure comedy, and this was a good start for Tim Burton as a movie director.

That Tim Burton is behind this film is no surprise. But neither can one overlook that Paul Reubens is a masterful comic, and this film is a masterpiece of comedic timing and pacing. The writing is funny and very innocent.Paul and company did their homework. From the 'fifties mom and pop shops that people the small town Main street (the same inspiration for Disney's Main Street USA), to the tributes to Pinkie Lee and Soupy Sales and other kid hosts (the basis for Pee Wee's Playhouse), Reubens and Burton everywhere got it right.Why is this film so much better than the sequel, Big Top Pee Wee, which nevertheless shares some of these elements and is filled with funny and moving moments?

Like the old Warner Brothers cartoons, it works at different levels for adults and children and can be enjoyed through multiple  viewings.  Children will appreciate Pee Wee Herman's manic style of comedy.  Adults, while enjoying this as well, are also likely to notice that the  movie swirls with images from the filmgoer's collective unconscious, all  delightfully twisted for comic effect.  Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is a giddy  kaleidescope of parodies on '70s road pictures, Hitchcock films, James  Bond, the Bicycle Thief, the Petrified Forest, and about a dozen other  films or genres.  Danny Elfman's score is perfect for the movie, full of  ironic references to classical film composers like Bernard Herrmann  (&quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;) and Ennio Morricone (&quot;The  Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;).Pee Wee's adventures out on the road  seem larger than life, drawn from deeply ingrained archetypes of the  American film.  At the end, the movie's focus contracts and we see that  Hollywood is actually smaller than life, full of banal falsehood.  The  irony is almost unbearable: it is this same Hollywood that brings us the  bigger-than-life images on which Pee Wee's adventures are based!  In the  final irony, James Brolin and Morgan Fairchild provide a patently phony  &quot;Hollywood version&quot; of Pee Wee's story.  Tim Burton seems to be  telling us &quot;don't look for your dream in Hollywood; it isn't  there--the beauty lies within, in the world of your own imagination.&quot;  It is a world in which something of the child lives on in the mind of every  adult.",5,A Comedy Classic,957312000,"05 3, 2000",2000,1682,"['very', 'funny', 'film', 'put', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'map', 'old', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', 'different', 'levels', 'adults', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Children', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'manic', 'style', 'comedy', 'Adults', 'enjoying', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'also', 'likely', 'notice', 'movie', 'swirls', 'images', 'filmgoer', 'collective', 'unconscious', 'delightfully', 'twisted', 'comic', 'effect', 'Pee-Wee', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'giddy', 'kaleidescope', 'parodies', ""'70s"", 'road', 'pictures', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'James', 'Bond', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'Petrified', 'Forest', 'dozen', 'other', 'films', 'genres', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'perfect', 'movie', 'full', 'ironic', 'references', 'classical', 'film', 'composers', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'quot', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'quot', 'Vertigo', 'quot', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'quot', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'quot', '.Pee', 'Wee', 'adventures', 'out', 'road', 'seem', 'larger', 'life', 'drawn', 'deeply', 'ingrained', 'archetypes', 'American', 'film', 'end', 'movie', 'focus', 'contracts', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'actually', 'smaller', 'life', 'full', 'banal', 'falsehood', 'irony', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'same', 'Hollywood', 'bigger-than-life', 'images', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'adventures', 'are', 'based', 'final', 'irony', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'provide', 'patently', 'phony', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'quot', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'story', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'be', 'telling', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'dream', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'beauty', 'world', 'own', 'imagination.', 'quot', 'world', 'something', 'child', 'mind', 'adult']",N/A

You're either gonna LOVE this film and watch it over & over, laughing until your sides hurt, or you'll shut it off minutes after you start watching it, thinking it's absolutely the stupidest thing you've ever seen. Not much middle ground here. You can tell by my rating that I'm a fan who loves this movie. Director Tim Burton really proved his unique talents with this bizarre effort early in his career, crafting a pretty amazing movie with very little prep time & practically zero budget. Everything works somehow, and that's saying something since it's essentially a bunch of little comedy snippets loosely sewn together into a surreal, demented ""road film."" The music is a real treat, too. Composer Danny Elfman also seems to be one of those polarizing movie talents that folks either love to death or hate with a passion.  Here, he seems so perfectly suited to the work that I cannot imagine this film without his musical contributions. This film wouldn't be half as much fun without Elfman's light, circus-like themes complimenting Burton's cotton-candy, fever-dream visuals. Fans know all the great scenes: Pee-wee's crazy house & opening Rube Goldberg breakfast scene, Large Marge, the biker bar, the studio chase finale... and they can probably quote most of the goofy dialogue, too.

Of course, Pee Wee himself is a strange guy, but this film is packed with quirky characters who all add something special.  The story is a little forced, but that aspect only adds to the campy value that this film possesses.  The plot is basically just an excuse for Pee Wee to travel around, meet weird people, and do crazy things.  The first few minutes of this film are the most entertaining, beginning when Pee Wee wakes up.  The breakfast scene is classic.  I used to rewind it over and over again when I was a kid because it's so funny.  The other classic part is the ending, where Pee Wee reunites with all the friends he's met and plays a small role in his own movie, even though his voice is dubbed over.  Hilarious stuff.

It's the struggle of good versus evil, skinny versus fat, rich versus poor; it's got nearly all the classic themes in cinematic history.  I really do enjoy it.  Having said that...Picture Pee Wee Herman for a moment.  Red bowtie, nasally voice, plastered smile, infantile brain capacity, rubbery arms, pedophilic appearances, sideways cocked face during nearly all speech, Rainman suit.  Weird guy, right?  Well, the truth is, Pee Wee Herman was an idiot savant, an engineering genius with a severe case of Tourette's Syndrome.  Think about it.  He had the facial tics; the awkwardly inappropriate, glottal giggle; the irritatingly incessant, self-amusing laugh; and the eardrum rupturing, parrot-raping honk.  Doubt his brilliance?  Oh, you clearly don't remember how he mechanically set up breakfast, with everything from an egg-head egg breaker to a life sized Abe Lincoln mannequin flipping flap jacks.  Genius, I say.  Considering that, the biggest problem I have with the movie is Pee Wee's chain and lock used to secure the bike.  Essentially it was just a 50-foot chain with one lock on it.  You'd think a brain like Pee Wee's, and an obsessively unhealthy love for a bike, would have led to better security.Beyond the normal review, here are the fifteen most puzzling questions I take from Pee Wee's Big Adventure:Question: In his original hitch-hiking attempt, did Pee Wee rob Toad from Super Mario Bros. in order to make his nap-sack on a stick?Question: Did Pee Wee Herman, a man (?) with obvious psychological issues, really hitch-hike through the desert and get picked up by Large Marge, a bull dyke truck driver with Bride of Frankenstein hair, who also happened to be a ghost?  Or was it a hallucination?Question: How exactly did Pee Wee manage to pay for his extravagant house filled with enough contraptions to resemble that old Mouse Trap board game?  Did he have a lucrative eBay business set up, or was he selling meth?Question: Why did Francis Buxton - a morbidly obese, rich kid with a 6-ft. deep indoor pool with an obvious aversion to exercise - want Pee Wee's bike?Question: Why weren't the kids in the bike clue creeped out by Pee Wee's obvious pedophiliac tendencies?Question: Why was Dottie fixing Pee Wee's horn?  Seems like a lame excuse for Pee Wee to hang out near the bike club.Question: How much exactly did Francis pay the stereotypical Italian hooligan to steal Pee Wee's bike?Question: Why did everyone show up to Pee Wee's ridiculous impromptu interrogative meeting?Question: After Pee Wee successfully hitch-hikes and gets a ride with escaped convict Mickey, why does he help Mickey evade capture at the police roadblock?  Seems kind of hypocritical to me considering Pee Wee's current criminal chase.Question: Since Simone (the waitress) and Andy (her boyfriend) are an obvious reference to Olive Oil and Bluto, does that make Pee Wee Popeye, or is he another Olive?Question: Why did everyone laugh when Pee Wee asked if the Alamo had a basement?  I've been there, and it's VERY overrated, and VERY small.  The better question would be, ""Why DOESN'T it have a basement?""Question: When Pee Wee is about to be murdered in the biker bar and asks for a last request, why does he choose to dance like an epileptic on top of the bar in a bad Coyote Ugly impersonation?  More importantly, why isn't he beaten to within an inch of his life precisely for the dance?Question: Dreams about clown nurses disassembling his bike and carrying it through hallways of funhouse mirrors and doors to perform surgery?!

In fact, Pee Wee's Big Adventure would sort of serve that purpose: Pee Wee is completely white and lives the life of a big kid.  Seriously, early Burton was a master at presenting stories of outcasts who live in their own worlds and whose worlds we see to seep into the world around them, like a little magic spilled.Pee Wee's Big Adventure is a delightful movie.  Not only is it funny, but, in ways, it is profound.  The late and under-appreciated Phil Hartman co-penned the story and there is a little method to the madness, an entire vision of American history, especially Manifest Destiny and a slight critique of the idea of the quest for New Cannan.

FOWLER,"[6, 9]","Pee-wee's Big Adventure is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen,( and believe me, I've seen a lot of movies in my life. ) It has comedy for all ages. You can't beat this movie. Paul Ruebens is a genius!  It all starts out with Pee-wee Herman, a grown man with a child sense of humor, taking a day out on his deluxe, red, super-duper bicycle. But while he's away at Chuck's Bike-O-Rama talking to his girl-friend,( she's a girl, and she's a friend,) his bike gets hoisted from the Houdini-type lock-up! After that, Pee-wee meets crooks, bikers, phantom truck drivers, and truck stop waitresses on his treck to find his bicycle. His trip takes him to Warner Brother's Studios, where he meets up with a brat child star! You'll love the ending, but I'm not going to spoil it for you !  In this DVD you will get to hear commentary from the star, Paul Reubens, the Director, Tim Burton, and the movie's Musical Composer, Danny Elfman. You also get to hear Danny's tremendous musical score without the soundtrack of the movie. You also get the original theatrical trailor that starts with the Most famous movie song ever - Tequila!  You will love this movie with all of your heart. Great comedy, music, and just silly acting will leave you howling as you watch this movie with your family! It might have been Tim Burton's directorial debut, but he did it right! Check this movie out if you love great comedy, great music, and great photography in movies.

SNL alum Phil Hartman, who also worked with Reubens on his stage show as Capt. Carl, co-wrote  what seems to be an almost stream-of-conscience story involving Pee Wee going on a road trip to find his beloved stolen bicycle.  Along the way, he meets, in no paticular order, an escaped con, a fortune teller, a truck driving ghost, a biker gang, a rodeo circus, a Hollywood producer, a hobo, and a down and out waitress with dreams of better things.  The first full length live action film for director Burton gives him plenty to work with, and he does so without any of the overtly flashy imagery that has become the mainstay of so many current Hollywood releases, and simply takes great joy in exploring the possibilities of art direction.  Added to all of it is Danny Elfman's first film score, which hops along so well with all the visuals, encorporating so many different styles of thematic scores, and still managing to have a life all its own.  The final film is something that can be enjoyed by anyone at anytime, and at any age: a truly fun and entertaining fairy tale, so rare to discover these days.DVD NOTES: The disk has some cut scenes that tie up a few loose ends that viewers may have been thinking about, and a nicely detailed set of production notes, but the real gem is the commentary by Burton and Reubens.  Insightful, funny, revealing, and continually moving along at a steady pace with the film.

Pee-Wee lives in a bizarre, childlike house populated with manequins, props, and other contraptions. He also has a bunch of Rube Goldberg-esque machines that makes breakfast for him. Wait till you see just how he eats his breakfast!Pee-Wee has one love of his life, his bicycle. He loves it even more than the girl at the bike shop who is sweet on him and sells him his horn. And he won't sell it even for a hundred, million, trillion dollars. Therefore he is devastated when his bicycle is stolen.Thus begins Pee-Wee's desperate cross country journey to retrieve his bicycle. Along the way he will meet such memorable characters as a deceased truck driver (Large Marge), an annoying folk song singing hobo, an escaped convict (he cut the tag off a mattress), and a biker gang. His journey will be filled with trials and tribulations. But not to worry, Pee-Wee has been assured by a fortune teller that his bicycle is safe and awaits him at the Alamo.  In the basementUnfortunately, the Alamo doesn't have a basement...""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" is one of the most original comedies ever made. Tim Burton's direction is truly inspired. This was his first feature film, and one can easily see why he went on to a successful career, making such films as ""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman"", and ""Edward Scissorhands"". Like those films, PWBA concerns a misunderstood loner existing in a bizarre, sometimes hostile world. Tim Burton and Paul Reubens were a perfect match as they seem to share the same sense of humor. Danny Elfman's score is the icing on the cake.Interestingly, some of the shots early on bring to mind that Italian film ""The Bicycle Thief"". It makes me wonder if Tim Burton saw that film and used it as inspiration.Pee-Wee Herman is now an almost forgotten 80s icon. It's really sad to think that people have allowed their personal feelings about Paul Reubens get in the way of enjoying a great comic creation. I sure hope parents won't think that this film will be a bad influence on their kids, as PWBA is a delightful and quite innocent film. After all, anyone who will risk his life to save a bunch of cute pets from a fire can't be all bad.I also hope parents don't think that this film is only for kids.

Pee-Wee Herman isn't exactly playing a part, or acting; he has become his role of the perpetually cheerful 20-something man-child with curiously red lips and aerial voice. The movie, simply, is about how Pee-Wee tries desperately to find his stolen bike. In an effort to make the movie appear deeper than it doesn't want to be, this man-child's sweaty pursuit of his vintage 50's styled bike could be construed as a metaphor for Pee-Wee's continued avoidance of the adult lifestyle; he's chasing down his youth, just as Charles Foster Kane was struggling to find the rosebud of his childhood. But it isn't just Pee-Wee's bicycle that's vintage, it is also his haircut and suit. Ironically, Pee-Wee lives alone in his own home, instead of in the basement of his parents'. It's the sort of gadget drunk fun house that MTV Cribs was born to document. One of the perks of his home is that he has a machine to make breakfast for him (cereal atop pancakes, bacon, etc). But does Pee-Wee have a job? ... According to the movie, No. Does Pee-Wee have a girlfriend? Well, now, you all know that boys at a very young age aren't into the cootie girls. In Pee-Wee's hunt for his bike, does he come of age? No. Does he find his bike? Well, yeah... Duh! Does he eventually get a job? Well, kind of. Hollywood producers learn of his race across the world to find his bicycle and decide to make it into a movie. And does he eventually accept his once platonic girlfriend into his life? Sure, but their union probably won't lead to anything... maybe one step at a time, though.

For every DVD I've ever had, it wasn't a bit better than its counterpart VCR tape.  Finally I now see a DVD that's clearly superior to its video.  In addition to the feature film, this particular DVD has the original theatrical trailer, a whole slew of production design sketches compiled in a short film, deleted scenes, and a good amount of commentary from Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and Pee-Wee Herman himself.  The extras make the DVD so much better than just a plain old video tape.  You learn SO much about the making of the film from the extras alone.  I learned that Phil Hartman co-wrote this, and that this was Tim Burton's first time directing a full-length picture.This movie really is something special.  Scene after scene has neat stuff in it.  Pee-wee's bike is awesome, and his house is awesome, and he goes to awesome places.  The coolest place he goes to has these giant dinosaur statues that are hollowed out inside.  You can go inside of them and see the open sky.This movie definitely has a Tim Burton feel to it, and you can really see why it launched his career.  It's very creative, and when you combine it with elements from the Pee-wee's Playhouse show, whoa.  You've got one heck of an unreal combination.  Very unusual and very fun to watch.

What a creepy charecter, ay?That was his thing though, no? A creepy dude, with a playhouse. This gimmick was meant to be sick. Somebody was wacked to turn it into an actual kids show. Initially it was a stage show for adults, designed to look like a kids show. It turned me into a quite bizzare child, which I have to say I'm actually sort of grateful for. Not to mention the movie PEE WEEs BIG ADVENTURE. This was a staple for every kid back then. We all used to talk about this one for ever. I recently bought this DVD and, man, its even funnier now than it was back then. THIS IS NO KIDS MOVIE, although I probably would let my kids watch it, its not that bad really, but its way more fun when you understand more of the jokes.But kids no doubt will still take pleasure in its off the wall creepiness.
