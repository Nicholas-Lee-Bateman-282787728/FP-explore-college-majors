It has some footage from the early 70's and a lot of interviews interspersed with some of the music from the album.  My only criticisms would be 1.  They did not really play any song all the way through.  I would have liked that and I would have liked to see some of them played live with vintage concert footage.  And 2.  Although Davey Johnstone talked at length about his guitar work on the album (and played some, too), they barely mentioned the late Dee Murray's bass guitar work. And although there were some brief shots of Nigel Olsson playing in concert, they were not long and certainly not close-up, and they never showed him playing now.  I realize the DVD is not primarily about the band, but I feel that they were a big part of how it turned out.  Nigel's drumming on the album was wonderful and he should have had the air time that Davey was given to show his playing.  Otherwise, it really is an interesting DVD.  Just remember that it's not a &quot;music video&quot; but rather a documentary about how a classic album was created.",4,A Look at the Way They Were,1059004800,"07 24, 2003",2003,1088,"['excellent', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'footage', 'early', '70', 'lot', 'interviews', 'interspersed', 'music', 'album', 'only', 'criticisms', 'would', 'be', '1', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'play', 'song', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'played', 'live', 'vintage', 'concert', 'footage', '2', 'Davey', 'Johnstone', 'talked', 'length', 'guitar', 'work', 'album', 'played', 'too', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'late', 'Dee', 'Murray', 'bass', 'guitar', 'work', 'were', 'brief', 'shots', 'Nigel', 'Olsson', 'playing', 'concert', 'were', 'not', 'long', 'certainly', 'not', 'close-up', 'never', 'showed', 'playing', 'now', 'realize', 'DVD', 'not', 'primarily', 'band', 'feel', 'were', 'big', 'part', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'Nigel', 'drumming', 'album', 'was', 'wonderful', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'air', 'time', 'Davey', 'was', 'given', 'show', 'playing', 'Otherwise', 'really', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'Just', 'remember', 'not', 'quot', 'music', 'video', 'quot', 'rather', 'documentary', 'how', 'classic', 'album', 'was', 'created']",N/A
673565,A391UWNYC7K7JS,B00005Q2Z4,"Gary Gardner ""Your resident dillettante""","[3, 3]","This reviewer has just recently been made aware of this series, and I must say it certainly has made the advent of DVD's even more welcome. Such a genre serves many purposes: a way for music fans to get behind-the-scenes glances at how a great album gets made; a historical perspective that someone who was perhaps too young during the original release date can get from watching such a historical record; and an eye-opener on the inner workings of music studios, and how the choice of studio can actually help in the crafting of a particular album.Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" remains a singularly monumental achievement of 1970's era rock 'n' roll, and is considered one of John's best works. The ""Classic Album"" edition takes one to the genesis of the creation of this awesome work, with an aborted attempt to record first in Jamaica--until disaster struck. Don't miss Elton's and guitarist Davey Johnstone's commentaries on this particular experience.Elton's commentaries are, of course, numerous throughout, touching on the songs that meant quite a bit to him. The late producer, Gus Dudgeon, luckily lived long enough to be a part of this work too. On the DVD, he highlights particular parts of assorted songs, with the assistance of the album's engineer, David Hentschel. For instance, Dee Murray's bass part in ""The Ballad of Danny Bailey"" and Elton's unique vocal in ""Roy Rogers"" get examined to further elevate the musicianship involved.The best commentary (next to that of the effusive Dudgeon) is that of Johnstone. In his Scottish burr, he rattles off some amusing bits of dialogue he remembered from 1973, when the band was ensconsed in the Chateau H'erouville, in France. His discussion of the backing vocals, provided by himself, Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, was extremely interesting; we actually get to witness the trio record backing vocals to the bare bones of ""Candle in the Wind""!. Johnstone even lays down some of the classic guitar riffs from such greats songs as ""Funeral For a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"" and ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"" to show how he came to use those licks.Those interested in seeing what the studio in France was like will be pleasantly surprised too. There are many moments in the film showing Elton and the band working on the tracks and vocals at the Chateau; even included is some footage of the incredible scenery surrounding the studio.This DVD is incredibly satisfying for those who are interested in the ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" album. It is a worthy document indeed of a classic-rock work that still resonates with fans to this day. If you love the album as much as this reviewer does, then please pick this one up. It will not disappoint you in the least.",5,Great series featuring great album!,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2741,"['reviewer', 'just', 'recently', 'been', 'made', 'aware', 'series', 'must', 'say', 'certainly', 'made', 'advent', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'welcome', 'genre', 'many', 'purposes', 'way', 'music', 'fans', 'get', 'behind-the-scenes', 'glances', 'how', 'great', 'album', 'made', 'historical', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'perhaps', 'too', 'young', 'original', 'release', 'date', 'can', 'get', 'watching', 'historical', 'record', 'eye-opener', 'inner', 'workings', 'music', 'studios', 'how', 'choice', 'studio', 'can', 'actually', 'help', 'crafting', 'particular', 'album.Elton', 'John', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'singularly', 'monumental', 'achievement', '1970', 'era', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'considered', 'one', 'John', 'best', 'works', 'Classic', 'Album', 'edition', 'one', 'genesis', 'creation', 'awesome', 'work', 'aborted', 'attempt', 'record', 'first', 'Jamaica', 'disaster', 'struck', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Elton', 'guitarist', 'Davey', 'Johnstone', 'commentaries', 'particular', 'experience.Elton', 'commentaries', 'are', 'course', 'numerous', 'touching', 'songs', 'meant', 'bit', 'late', 'producer', 'Gus', 'Dudgeon', 'luckily', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'part', 'work', 'too', 'DVD', 'particular', 'parts', 'assorted', 'songs', 'assistance', 'album', 'engineer', 'David', 'Hentschel', 'instance', 'Dee', 'Murray', 'bass', 'part', 'Ballad', 'Danny', 'Bailey', 'Elton', 'unique', 'vocal', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'get', 'examined', 'further', 'elevate', 'musicianship', 'involved.The', 'best', 'commentary', 'next', 'effusive', 'Dudgeon', 'Johnstone', 'Scottish', 'burr', 'amusing', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'remembered', '1973', 'when', 'band', 'was', 'ensconsed', 'Chateau', ""H'erouville"", 'France', 'discussion', 'backing', 'vocals', 'provided', 'Murray', 'drummer', 'Nigel', 'Olsson', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'actually', 'get', 'witness', 'trio', 'record', 'backing', 'vocals', 'bare', 'bones', 'Candle', 'Wind', 'Johnstone', 'even', 'down', 'classic', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'such', 'greats', 'songs', 'Funeral', 'Friend/Love', 'Bleeding', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Alright', 'Fighting', 'show', 'how', 'came', 'use', 'licks.Those', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'studio', 'France', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'too', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'film', 'showing', 'Elton', 'band', 'working', 'tracks', 'vocals', 'Chateau', 'even', 'included', 'footage', 'incredible', 'scenery', 'surrounding', 'studio.This', 'DVD', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'album', 'worthy', 'document', 'indeed', 'classic-rock', 'work', 'still', 'fans', 'day', 'love', 'album', 'as', 'much', 'reviewer', 'then', 'please', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'least']",N/A
673566,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005Q2Z4,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Last night, instead of watching one of my bargain-rack movies, I watched a semi-documentary on the album ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" by Elton John on DVD. It was apart of a ""Classic Albums"" series, and the first one I have viewed. It was an interesting DVD. Elton John and his partner Bernie Taupin are, of course, one of the greatest composer duos of the past 50 years. Their songs are legendary. John probably gets most of the credit, in that he's the upfront singer/piano player. However, it's Taupin who writes the lyrics to all songs and then hands them over to John who composes the music to go along with them and sings and plays the piano. It's been an astonishingly successful duo and is a rival to the Beatles in popularity.The documentary is very interesting. John and Taupin are featured and interviewed throughout and appear both in their modern form plus from archival footage. Cuts of songs are liberally planted among the interviews. Members of the band, particularly the guitarist, and the producer and sound engineers all add their comments and opinions. If you're interested in how popular music is constructed, it's a fascinating video to watch and gives a lot of insight. It's also interesting from a historical point of view. The sound is clean and crisp and the video is excellent. I might indicate that Elton John music has always been in the background for me and I enjoy it but have never been a fan.Gary Peterson",4,Interesting Insight To One Of The Great Composing Duos.,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1439,"['Last', 'night', 'instead', 'watching', 'one', 'bargain-rack', 'movies', 'watched', 'semi-documentary', 'album', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'Elton', 'John', 'DVD', 'was', 'apart', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'series', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'viewed', 'was', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'Elton', 'John', 'partner', 'Bernie', 'Taupin', 'are', 'course', 'one', 'greatest', 'composer', 'duos', 'past', '50', 'years', 'songs', 'are', 'legendary', 'John', 'probably', 'most', 'credit', 'upfront', 'singer/piano', 'player', 'However', 'Taupin', 'who', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'then', 'John', 'who', 'music', 'go', 'along', 'sings', 'piano', 'been', 'astonishingly', 'successful', 'duo', 'rival', 'Beatles', 'popularity.The', 'documentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'John', 'Taupin', 'are', 'featured', 'interviewed', 'appear', 'modern', 'form', 'archival', 'footage', 'Cuts', 'songs', 'are', 'liberally', 'planted', 'interviews', 'Members', 'band', 'particularly', 'guitarist', 'producer', 'sound', 'engineers', 'add', 'comments', 'opinions', ""'re"", 'interested', 'how', 'popular', 'music', 'constructed', 'fascinating', 'video', 'watch', 'lot', 'insight', 'also', 'interesting', 'historical', 'point', 'view', 'sound', 'clean', 'crisp', 'video', 'excellent', 'might', 'indicate', 'Elton', 'John', 'music', 'always', 'been', 'background', 'enjoy', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fan.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

Davey Johnstone does great famous riffs from the album and it is interspersed with the actual song with neat segues.  The concert footage is a bit fuzzy, but the showmanship and the songs are displayed with great affection.

Boy, was I wrong.This is an in-depth look at the making of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", using vintage clips of Elton and band in the studio and newer interviews from the same to have them recollect their memories of the making of that album. From the new interviews, Elton plays little snippets of songs to show how they came together, and guitarist Davey Johnstone plays some of his guitar parts solo and does some analysis of them. Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin describe their songwriting process. Many individual songs from GYBR are discussed.The aspect of this DVD I enjoyed the most was having the master tapes being played in the studio and having them dissected to our ears.  The engineer will solo track the backing vocals to a particular song to show you exactly what was being done there....will pull only Nigel's drums up to spotlight them, etc. You see how a now-famous song came together.On top of this, we hear from many of those involved why this recording was a pinnacle in Elton's career, being more of a landmark than many of his other recordings.

It was much harder though for double albums to be as univeral masterpieces than, as much as it is now. Although there are few that stand out like Pink Floyd's The Wall, Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Volumes I & II, and The Beatles White Album. For a living legend like Elton John, he has had so many different double albums from Blue Moves in 1976, and Here & There in 1975. Although those records have shined, his masterpiece Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is still the prime record of his career. Although he has made so many, this was the breakthrough one, that still remains his highest-selling one.Classic Albums: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, is a comprehensive documentary describing the highs and lows of what made Elton's 1973 classic, a standard in music today. This documentary highlights the hindrances, and achievements with footage from Elton through his live performances from his career from his classic landmark show at the legendary Hollywood Bowl, to his intimate rendition of Candle In The Wind from his 1986 Live In Austrailia conert, with each track shown in reminicing stories. This documentary shows how sessions inspired tracks from Jamaican Jerk-off, to Bennie & The Jets, and the somber Roy Rogers which songwriter Bernie Taupin claimed as a childhood hero. You also see the late Gus Dudgeon, who sadly was killed in a car accident in 2003, and how he fused each track, and even early versions of tracks such as Funeral For A Friend / Love Lies Bleeding and Harmony. The documentary is very gripping, and makes you wonder why very few artists have really made the achievement and magic appeal Elton John and Bernie Taupin accomplished.All in all, Classic Albums: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is a very detailed documentary that is not just enjoyable, it captures the imagination of one of the best recorded and definitive albums ever. I loved watching this documentary recently on the VH1 Classic channel, and it was just a real treat. If you haven't seen this one, you realy don't know what you are missing. I recommend this for any die hard fan of Elton's, and a owner of the yellow brick road.DVD Cover: BPrice: BMastering: AExtras: B-Overall: B 1/2+",4,"Hello, Yellow Brock Road",1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2259,"['music', '1970', 'brought', 'out', 'most', 'dynamic', 'universal', 'records', 'ever', 'was', 'much', 'harder', 'double', 'albums', 'be', 'univeral', 'masterpieces', 'as', 'much', 'now', 'are', 'few', 'stand', 'out', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Wall', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'Greatest', 'Volumes', 'II', 'Beatles', 'White', 'Album', 'living', 'legend', 'Elton', 'John', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'double', 'albums', 'Blue', 'Moves', '1976', 'Here', '1975', 'records', 'have', 'shined', 'masterpiece', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'still', 'prime', 'record', 'career', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'one', 'still', 'highest-selling', 'one.Classic', 'Albums', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'comprehensive', 'documentary', 'describing', 'highs', 'lows', 'what', 'made', 'Elton', '1973', 'classic', 'standard', 'music', 'today', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'hindrances', 'achievements', 'footage', 'Elton', 'live', 'performances', 'career', 'classic', 'landmark', 'show', 'legendary', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'intimate', 'rendition', 'Candle', 'Wind', '1986', 'Live', 'Austrailia', 'conert', 'track', 'shown', 'reminicing', 'stories', 'documentary', 'how', 'sessions', 'inspired', 'tracks', 'Jamaican', 'Jerk-off', 'Bennie', 'Jets', 'somber', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'songwriter', 'Bernie', 'Taupin', 'claimed', 'childhood', 'hero', 'also', 'see', 'late', 'Gus', 'Dudgeon', 'who', 'sadly', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', '2003', 'how', 'fused', 'track', 'even', 'early', 'versions', 'tracks', 'such', 'Funeral', 'A', 'Friend', '/', 'Love', 'Lies', 'Bleeding', 'Harmony', 'documentary', 'very', 'gripping', 'wonder', 'why', 'very', 'few', 'artists', 'have', 'really', 'made', 'achievement', 'magic', 'appeal', 'Elton', 'John', 'Bernie', 'Taupin', 'accomplished.All', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'Goodbye', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'very', 'detailed', 'documentary', 'not', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'imagination', 'one', 'best', 'recorded', 'definitive', 'albums', 'ever', 'loved', 'watching', 'documentary', 'recently', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'channel', 'was', 'just', 'real', 'treat', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'realy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'missing', 'recommend', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Elton', 'owner', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road.DVD', 'Cover', 'BPrice', 'BMastering', 'AExtras', 'B-Overall', 'B', '1/2+']",N/A

Contemporary interviews are interspersed with archival footage of the recording sessions.  Elton discusses various aspects of the songwriting process, and which songs should or should not have been released as singles.  At the time, he fought against &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot; being released as a single, but thankfully the record company prevailed and it became a #1 hit.  He regrets that by the time &quot;Harmony&quot; would have been issued as a 45, &quot;Caribou&quot; had been released and &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot; was issued as the next single to promote that album.  Bernie Taupin talks about the inspiration and meaning of his lyrics.  He reveals that &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; wasn't just about Marilyn Monroe but is representative of anyone who dies young and at the peak of their career, mentioning James Dean and Jim Morrison as examples.  The core Elton John band members finally get their due.  Nigel Olsson discusses not only his drumming duties but his background singing as well.  As he admits, his voice was so loud that he sometimes had to sing with his back to the microphone!  Davey Johnstone demonstrates some excellent guitar riffs.  He mentions that he came up with the classic, rocking intro to &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting.&quot; Dee Murray, Elton's bass player, unfortunately passed away, but is fondly remembered.
