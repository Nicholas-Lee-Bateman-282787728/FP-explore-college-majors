It has wonderfully well drawn characters, and the actors, Joseph Morgan particularly, are more than up to their challenges.The problem, as mentioned in another review, is that this is Ben-Hur, and not Ben-Hur, A tale of the Christ.The book spends nearly a hundred pages with the three kings before we even meet Ben-Hur.  They don't even appear in this version.  And Jesus, in this version, is reduced to one line that he says several times.  It's not unimportant, but it isn't all there is to him!This version seem like it is based on the 1960 movie.  The primary female character (Athena) is well acted, but one suspects, since the book's closest character is quite distant from this one, that she was added so Ben-Hur could have a sex scene.The story (in all movies) gets worked around so the race comes nearer the end of the book.  But in the book, Messala, who survives but is crippled (like Simonides) is just as duplicitous after the race as he was before.  His actions against the Hur family were greed on his part and on the part of Gratus.  If Ben-Hur survives, he can try to get it back.  The imprisonment of Ben-Hur's family is not at all specific in this movie - or very even in 1960.  Messala is also dishonored after the race because he bet heavily and then refused to pay.While the subplot between Messala and his father is very interesting, it does not stem at all from the book. Imagination seems better to me when it stems from General Lew Wallace.  It's a good movie, I just wish it had a little more to do with the original book.BTW, in the ""Making of"" they refer to the ""original movie"" but, in that they mean 1959-60, not the earlier one, which still holds up, even if it's silent.",4,Good with reservations.,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,1727,"['did', 'like', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'drawn', 'characters', 'actors', 'Joseph', 'Morgan', 'particularly', 'are', 'more', 'up', 'challenges.The', 'problem', 'mentioned', 'review', 'Ben-Hur', 'not', 'Ben-Hur', 'A', 'tale', 'Christ.The', 'book', 'nearly', 'hundred', 'pages', 'three', 'kings', 'even', 'meet', 'Ben-Hur', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'version', 'Jesus', 'version', 'reduced', 'one', 'line', 'several', 'times', 'not', 'unimportant', ""n't"", 'version', 'seem', 'based', '1960', 'movie', 'primary', 'female', 'character', 'Athena', 'well', 'acted', 'one', 'book', 'closest', 'character', 'quite', 'distant', 'one', 'was', 'added', 'so', 'Ben-Hur', 'could', 'have', 'sex', 'scene.The', 'story', 'movies', 'worked', 'so', 'race', 'nearer', 'end', 'book', 'book', 'Messala', 'who', 'crippled', 'Simonides', 'just', 'as', 'duplicitous', 'race', 'was', 'before', 'actions', 'Hur', 'family', 'were', 'greed', 'part', 'part', 'Gratus', 'Ben-Hur', 'can', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'imprisonment', 'Ben-Hur', 'family', 'not', 'specific', 'movie', 'very', 'even', '1960', 'Messala', 'also', 'dishonored', 'race', 'bet', 'heavily', 'then', 'refused', 'pay.While', 'subplot', 'Messala', 'father', 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'stem', 'book', 'Imagination', 'better', 'when', 'General', 'Lew', 'Wallace', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'do', 'original', 'book.BTW', 'Making', 'refer', 'original', 'movie', 'mean', '1959-60', 'not', 'earlier', 'one', 'still', 'up', 'even', 'silent']","Ben Hur NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Italy"

1420115,A1QVEQC37PRHP6,B004MOY97U,GWH,"[0, 0]","To start out, I have seen this miniseries, and I have read some of the reviews.  A lot of people are comparing this miniseries to the Charlton Heston 1956 version.  I have seen both the 1956 version and the silent Ben Hur (in fact I own both on DVD), and one cannot compare this to either of those movies on any level, and in my opinion, for obvious reasons.  Not to be tedious and repetitive of other reviewers, I still feel the need to clarify some things, in the defense of this miniseries.  First, it is not &#34;A Tale of the Christ&#34;, as is lauded in the 1956 version. Quite frankly, the 1956 version is not &#34;a tale of the Christ&#34; either.  It is a tale about the relationship of two boys of different ethnicities, who grow apart as they become adults because of the life paths that they have taken, and because of their times and social situations. Jesus Christ is kind of a sub plot if you will.  Basically, Judah and Messalla's story is set in the first century during the time and happenings of Jesus Christ.  That's it. Neither has anything to do with Jesus Christ necessarily, other than how Judah and Jesus' paths happen to cross.  Therefore, telling the public not to watch this for Easter, or for the holiday's is kind of silly, since neither movie is really a &#34;holiday&#34; movie. The networks run these films during the holiday's for ratings and such.Second, this Ben Hur is a miniseries and it is clear that it was made on a small budget, therefore comparing it to a Hollywood epic block buster is unfair. The 1956 movie won a record 11 Academy Awards and is one of the best movies ever made in Hollywood. But also, in fairness to this miniseries, these young actors did the best they could with the experience that they have.  I don't think their acting is all that bad.  Again, one cannot compare these young actors to Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd. By the time of the 1956 Ben Hur, Heston and Boyd were veteran actors with a pantheon of experience and credit to their credentials.  They were part of the MGM studio system where they were groomed and nurtured and coached to be the very best. Hollywood is not like that today, in 2014. The studio system and the glory days of Hollywood are long gone, and so is some of the quality. These young actors need time to gain some experience, do more projects, and maybe in time they will develop into actors like Heston and Boyd. Liz Taylor didn't start out as an amazing actress. She was in some flops. However, she evolved into the legendary actress that she later became.Third, I must have missed something but I didn't see a whole lot of sex and nudity as some of the reviewers claim there to be in this miniseries. If the scene's containing nudity that I saw where that offensive to some viewers, then all I can say is that those reviewers haven't seen much TV lately. This miniseries is nothing in the nudity or sex department compared to Starz's SPARTACUS series. All of them. Or HBO's ROME, or SHOWTIME'S THE TUDORS, or THE BORGIA'S. Not to impugn the opinion of other reviewers, but those miniseries that I just mentioned above has 10x's the nudity, sex, blood and gore that the 2010 Ben Hur has .... and the SPARTACUS series is thought by some, to be soft porn.  Therefore, I'd say that some reviewers are over reacting concerning the nudity in this miniseries, unless I totally missed those scenes all together.I'll end by recalling what I liked about this miniseries.  I liked how it portrayed their youth and friendship.  This one tells you &#34;what happened&#34; in their youth that played a part in the tensions that were present when they reunited years later. The 1956 version does not set one up that way.  In the 1956 version, the prologue is the birth of Christ ( which I view as the authors way of setting up the time frame) and then the movie starts.  They are adults already when the film starts, and we as an audience must surmise what their friendship as children were like.",3,"NOT THE ""TALE OF THE CHRIST""",1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,3981,"['start', 'out', 'have', 'seen', 'miniseries', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'comparing', 'miniseries', 'Charlton', 'Heston', '1956', 'version', 'have', 'seen', '1956', 'version', 'silent', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'fact', 'own', 'DVD', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'movies', 'level', 'opinion', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Not', 'be', 'tedious', 'repetitive', 'other', 'reviewers', 'still', 'feel', 'need', 'clarify', 'things', 'defense', 'miniseries', 'First', 'not', '34', 'Tale', 'Christ', '34', 'lauded', '1956', 'version', 'Quite', 'frankly', '1956', 'version', 'not', '34', 'tale', 'Christ', '34', 'tale', 'relationship', 'two', 'boys', 'different', 'ethnicities', 'who', 'grow', 'apart', 'become', 'adults', 'life', 'paths', 'have', 'taken', 'times', 'social', 'situations', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'kind', 'sub', 'plot', 'will', 'Basically', 'Judah', 'Messalla', 'story', 'set', 'first', 'century', 'time', 'happenings', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'anything', 'do', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'necessarily', 'other', 'how', 'Judah', 'Jesus', 'paths', 'happen', 'cross', 'Therefore', 'telling', 'public', 'not', 'watch', 'Easter', 'holiday', 'kind', 'silly', 'movie', 'really', '34', 'holiday', '34', 'movie', 'networks', 'run', 'films', 'holiday', 'ratings', 'such.Second', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'miniseries', 'clear', 'was', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'therefore', 'comparing', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'block', 'buster', 'unfair', '1956', 'movie', 'won', 'record', '11', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'fairness', 'miniseries', 'young', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'experience', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'acting', 'bad', 'Again', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'young', 'actors', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'time', '1956', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Heston', 'Boyd', 'were', 'veteran', 'actors', 'pantheon', 'experience', 'credit', 'credentials', 'were', 'part', 'MGM', 'studio', 'system', 'where', 'were', 'groomed', 'nurtured', 'coached', 'be', 'very', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'today', '2014', 'studio', 'system', 'glory', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'so', 'quality', 'young', 'actors', 'need', 'time', 'gain', 'experience', 'do', 'more', 'projects', 'maybe', 'time', 'will', 'develop', 'actors', 'Heston', 'Boyd', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'out', 'amazing', 'actress', 'was', 'flops', 'However', 'evolved', 'legendary', 'actress', 'later', 'became.Third', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'whole', 'lot', 'sex', 'nudity', 'reviewers', 'claim', 'be', 'miniseries', 'scene', 'containing', 'nudity', 'saw', 'where', 'offensive', 'viewers', 'then', 'can', 'say', 'reviewers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'TV', 'lately', 'miniseries', 'nothing', 'nudity', 'sex', 'department', 'compared', 'Starz', 'SPARTACUS', 'series', 'HBO', 'ROME', 'SHOWTIME', 'THE', 'TUDORS', 'THE', 'BORGIA', 'Not', 'impugn', 'opinion', 'other', 'reviewers', 'miniseries', 'just', 'mentioned', 'above', '10x', 'nudity', 'sex', 'blood', 'gore', '2010', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'SPARTACUS', 'series', 'thought', 'be', 'soft', 'porn', 'Therefore', ""'d"", 'say', 'reviewers', 'are', 'reacting', 'concerning', 'nudity', 'miniseries', 'totally', 'missed', 'scenes', 'together.I', ""'ll"", 'end', 'recalling', 'what', 'liked', 'miniseries', 'liked', 'how', 'portrayed', 'youth', 'friendship', 'one', '34', 'what', 'happened', '34', 'youth', 'played', 'part', 'tensions', 'were', 'present', 'when', 'reunited', 'years', 'later', '1956', 'version', 'not', 'set', 'one', 'way', '1956', 'version', 'prologue', 'birth', 'Christ', 'view', 'authors', 'way', 'setting', 'up', 'time', 'frame', 'then', 'movie', 'are', 'adults', 'already', 'when', 'film', 'audience', 'must', 'surmise', 'what', 'friendship', 'children', 'were']","Ben Hur NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Italy"

Cornwell ""Reviewer at Large""","[21, 26]","I have seen both versions of Ben Hur, its earlier black and white version and the 1959 version starring Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, so the comparison between the 1955 version and this one is still fresh in my mind. I had recently watched the DeMille version before watching this miniseries and the differences are monumental.I doubt that director, Stephen Shill, set out to make an epic adventure and in that he succeeded. Shill's Ben Hur is a little movie with the emphasis on sex and as much nudity as he could get on the screen to spice up what needs no spice, rather like adding a cup full of jalapenos to an already spicy chili.Shill's Ben Hur is earthy with a very young cast, most of whom give credible performances, but in whom there is little of gravitas or depth. Joseph Morgan broods well and purses his full lips as often as possible but fails to give more than brooding life to the character of Judah ben Hur. Kristin Kreuk is wasted as Tirzah and Alex Kingston's full blown charms fail to enliven Ruth, Judah's mother, or give her actions any heft or reality. Stephen Campbell Moore as Messala is feckless and rash without the depth of villainy that characterized Stephen Boyd's portrayal of Messala. Morgan and Moore are at best pretty boys playing at being men writ large and end up scribbled small in the sand, 2-dimensional at best, but not 3-dimensional or noteworthy. Jimenez as Athene was by far more interesting, although lacking in definable motives.Shills' Ben Hur is a low budget bit of fluff with plenty of skin, sex, and nudity that pales in comparison to the 1955 epic saga. An actor with a little more mileage and a better understanding of the times and characters would have lifted this average film from mediocrity.The scenery is, however, earthy and realistic and small, matching the smallness of the endeavor.

Jerusalem). .As adult-level drama, the principal actors (the Agrippas, Arias, and Hur) present a tale of an aristocratic member of the Jewish upper class, Judah ben Hur,  who painstakingly overcomes great obstacles (unjust imprisonment and slavery at the hands of Roman Military Tribune Messala Agrippa) and who in the end emerges victorious over his Roman oppressors (namely, the Agrippas, Pilate, Tiberias, and, by extension, Rome)..In the end, &#34;truth&#34; seemingly does win out over &#34;evil&#34;: The good does triumph over the bad. The oppressed win, at least for the moment, against the Tiberian imposed Pax Romana. As a bonus, the details of the Wallace book are more finely etched in our consciousness than those presented in the former movie version.While not recommended for children because of several scenes of the sexual intercourse and of the graphic cruelty and violence, Ben Hur (2010) is, nonetheless, well worth watching.Thank you.M.

This new version only shows a bright light with no explanation. In the book, Jesus is riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. He sees Judah, Judah's mother, and sister. Jesus stops and lays His hand on the women thus healing them. The book is subtitled &#34;A Tale of the Christ.&#34; It deals with a deeply wronged man who vows revenge, hears the gospel message taught by Jesus Christ, repents, and becomes a born again Christian.

I hadn't intended to watch it all, but couldn't turn it off. And it brought me to tears at least 3 times. I believe it was re-edited to lengthen some scenes over what was originally shown on American TV (it's, I believe, a Canadian/German/Moroccan co-production) and there's some slight male nudity as well as some above the waist female nudity that I don't remember seeing when it was broadcast in the U.S. I had picked it up (here) at Amazon for $1 plus shipping and it's one of the best deals I've found in quite some time. HIGHLY recommended.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I agree with some reviewers who bemoan the absence of a Blu-ray version of this, but the DVD is excellent, although I want to advise any who buy this to skip the lengthy flashbacks at the beginning of part 2, which is about as close to a quibble as I can get.Ben-Hur is portrayed as a sort of Everyman and NOT as the burly superhero as played by Charlton Heston in the remake. And I'm a big fan of that version, having bought it on low fi VHS, then hi fi stereo VHS, then the first edition on DVD, then the special edition DVD, and finally the big and elaborate Blu-ray set. But, as I wrote above, I was quite taken with this version and feel that it stands on its own. And judging by the low prices one can get it here, a real bargain!

It stars The Vampire Diaries' Joseph Morgan as the title character Judah Ben Hur.  His performance was more acceptable than the more well known Hollywood epic version with Charlton Heston in that role.  What it lacked in big budget and overall production value it made up for in character development because since it was in a mini-series format it had more time to bring in a bit more detail than any of the previous big screen versions and was better able to fill in some of the blanks left missing, particularly in the Heston film.

1420130,A1N5YEQ29VU3C2,B004MOY97U,Trout26,"[6, 9]","I am a huge fan of Wallace's book, and the 1959 film is amongst my favorites. Yes, it had problems (the middle third of the book and several sub-plots were cut and Heston was at least 20 years too old for the part), but the parts that were there were faithful to the source. Not so with this loose adaptation. A number of other reviews have already discussed the changes made in this version; I will add some of my comments to the ongoing discussion.The one thing they got right was the age of the actor playing Judah; he is both the correct age, and his acting is considerably better than the over-acting of Heston. But that's where it stops.The number of abridgements, alterations, and fabrications not found in Wallace are far too numerous to list, but a few of the most aggregious are as follows. (1) Judah's motivation; Judah's motivation in the original is to find his family - it is his sole reason for surviving the gallies, the numerous adventures not included in the film, and ultimately the chariot race. In this version, it is reduced to simple revenge, and being reunited with his family becomes an afterthought. (2) Judah is betrothed to Ester before he is taken as a slave; in the book this doess not happen until the very end. (3) Once again, the middle third of the book is missing. (4) An extended subplot involving Agrippa nd Athene that intertwines itself throughout the entire film is introduced that in no was is rooted in Wallace's book.The issues with the script aside, the acting is quite good throughout, as is the production design and filming. This is certainly a much ""smaller"" production than the 1959 film (the chariot race is reduced to a street race vice an arena race), but it is self-consistant throughout. It is for these reasons that I have given this 3 stars. Based on writing alone, it would have been 1 or maybe 2 stars.I could go on and on, but I will stop here. If someone has neither read the book, nor seen the 1959 film, they might find this an interesting film to watch, but if you come to it with any preexisting frame of reference, you will only be disappointed",3,Certainly not Lew Wallace's Ben-Hur,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2109,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Wallace', 'book', '1959', 'film', 'amongst', 'favorites', 'Yes', 'had', 'problems', 'middle', 'third', 'book', 'several', 'sub-plots', 'were', 'cut', 'Heston', 'was', 'least', '20', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'parts', 'were', 'were', 'faithful', 'source', 'Not', 'so', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'number', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'discussed', 'changes', 'made', 'version', 'will', 'add', 'comments', 'ongoing', 'discussion.The', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'right', 'was', 'age', 'actor', 'playing', 'Judah', 'correct', 'age', 'acting', 'considerably', 'better', 'over-acting', 'Heston', 'where', 'number', 'abridgements', 'alterations', 'fabrications', 'not', 'found', 'Wallace', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'numerous', 'list', 'few', 'most', 'aggregious', 'are', '1', 'Judah', 'motivation', 'Judah', 'motivation', 'original', 'find', 'family', 'sole', 'reason', 'surviving', 'gallies', 'numerous', 'adventures', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'ultimately', 'chariot', 'race', 'version', 'reduced', 'simple', 'revenge', 'being', 'reunited', 'family', 'afterthought', '2', 'Judah', 'betrothed', 'Ester', 'taken', 'slave', 'book', 'doess', 'not', 'happen', 'very', 'end', '3', 'Once', 'again', 'middle', 'third', 'book', 'missing', '4', 'extended', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Agrippa', 'nd', 'Athene', 'entire', 'film', 'introduced', 'was', 'rooted', 'Wallace', 'book.The', 'issues', 'script', 'aside', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'production', 'design', 'filming', 'certainly', 'much', 'smaller', 'production', '1959', 'film', 'chariot', 'race', 'reduced', 'street', 'race', 'vice', 'arena', 'race', 'self-consistant', 'reasons', 'have', 'given', '3', 'stars', 'Based', 'writing', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'been', '1', 'maybe', '2', 'stars.I', 'could', 'go', 'will', 'stop', 'here', 'someone', 'read', 'book', 'seen', '1959', 'film', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', 'film', 'watch', 'come', 'preexisting', 'frame', 'reference', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed']","Ben Hur NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Italy"
