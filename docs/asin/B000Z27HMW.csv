1121142,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000Z27HMW,,"[0, 0]","Jane Austen's unique romantic drama Mansfield Park is perhaps a little too long and complicated to be faithfully reproduced in a single episode television production, and that may be the major challenge for this Masterpiece Theater version.Billie Piper is an interesting choice to play Fanny Price, a poor relation of the wealthy Bertram family.  She is invited to live with the family at Mansfield Park, but is treated as something of a glorified servant and expected to be grateful.  Her one friend in the household is her kindly cousin Edmund (Blake Ritson).As the story gets properly underway, the rhythm of life at Mansfield Park is upset by two events, the departure of patriarch Sir Thomas to tend to family properties in Antigua, and the arrival of Henry and Mary Crawford.  Henry and Mary are presented as worldly schemers who plan to marry the most eligible of the Bertram clan and claim a share of the family fortune.  The absence of Sir Thomas allows them to gain undue influence over the young adults in the household.  Henry pursues the already engaged eldest daughter, while Mary flashes her considerable charm at Edmund.Fanny suffers in silence as her Edmund is distracted by Mary.  Her life is further complicated when the untrustworthy Henry makes a surprise marriage proposal, and Fanny is placed under great pressure by the returned Sir Thomas to accept.  Fanny's dilemma sets up a rather dramatic ending...This shortened version of the original story results in a choppy delivery and a loss of the some of the subtlety of the plot.  Most of the minor characters get minimal screen time.  The ending is not bad, but it doesn't really project the moral challenge presented to Fanny, or her courage in resolving it.

This is the second Mansfield Park I've bought (I have the version starring Frances O'Connor) and this one, while it definitely kept to the book more, did not seem to actively grasp the characters. In fact there seemed to be very little personality to anybody, except Mary Crawford, who was much more lascivious than merely misled and progressive in mindset. Henry Crawford was duly wicked, but no more than a blandly personified rake. Sir Thomas seemed always to speak as though in a rage, and in such a low, hissing tone I just stopped trying to hear his lines. Mrs. Norris was mostly disapproving, and mostly silent. Edmund was played well, as was (surprisingly) Lady Bertram, and William was well done as well. But worst of all was Fanny, who seemed to have no personality at all and at most displayed a repressed disappointment when Edmund professed his love for Miss Crawford. There are multiple scenes where she is running about playing tag or hide and seek, or chasing a dog - multiple enough to cause some eyebrow raising and thoughts of, ""Really?""

1121155,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000Z27HMW,,"[10, 20]","All of the novels in the new BBC series so far have been altered, jumbled, and severely cut to fit within the confines of approximately 90 minutes of screen time. ""Mansfield Park"" suffers further from oddities in casting: Billie Piper, though plain enough and believably pious, is far too lively a character for Fannie, and Blake Ritson is much too handsome for Edmund. One of Jane Austen's consistent points is that her heroes and heroines are not strikingly handsome, but only near it and, as is psychologically sound, become better looking as their characters are revealed to their potential suitors. Ritson would have better fitted Austen's vision if he'd been cast as Henry Crawford. Beautiful, but depraved Mary Crawford, on the other hand, is perfectly cast.Apart from the weak points just mentioned, I think ""Mansfield Park"" the best of the series so far. It's the truest to Jane Austen's vision. Thus we have retained here the corruption of the witty, attractive, big city young people set against the relative paleness of the conventional country dwellers, Fanny and Edmund, who've internalized the values that represent the best of the Mansfield life. Never simple in confounding virtue with mere geography, Austen as well as her adapters here shows the parental failure of Mansfield's Sir Thomas in having overseen only his daughter's manners, not their moral education. Corruption can bloom then in the countryside as well as in the big city.The novel ""Mansfield Park,"" which is the favorite of high-Janeites, turns on the conflict between cleverness and goodness. In most of Jane Austen, a combination of both qualities in the main characters is the ideal. Think Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood. Here, though, push comes to shove, and the author's judgment is that in a conflict comparatively dull goodness is vastly preferable to witty heartlessness.

And...that's about it. Yup, it was a dud. Patricia Rozema made a terrible movie, but you could tell she cared about the movie she made. This one...it was as if their hearts weren't in it. The script was dull and the budget was almost nonexistent. Everything took place in the same couple of rooms or on the lawn at Mansfield Park. That means no Portsmouth and no Prices, other than Fanny and William, and no trip to Sotherton. And the casting and characterizations...most were decent (with a couple bizarre exceptions) but nothing amazing.The bizarre casting choice for me was definitely Billie Piper. This is a horrible thing for me to say, but I thought she looked more like a prostitute than Fanny Price, with the cleavage, the bleach blond hair (but still black eyebrows!), and the buck tooth veneers. The screenwriter really didn't seem to know what to do with her character either. She had moments where she was quiet and shy and observant and others where she was running around laughing like Patricia Rozema's Fanny. They wanted to stay truer to the book character, I guess, but were still afraid to keep Fanny really as she was. Really, the only compliment I can give is that she and the actress who played young Fanny really looked alike.I guess if you're really turned off by the old-school production values in the 1983 version or you can't find a copy, it would be better to watch this version than the 1999 one.

1121177,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000Z27HMW,,"[2, 4]","Jane Austen fans have certainly been spoiled of late, for between 2007-2009, the BBC and ITV commissioned brand new versions of ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Northanger Abbey"", ""Persuasion"", ""Emma"", and this MANSFIELD PARK.  The BBC's previous miniseries version in 1983 I would single out as being one of the most faithfully-drawn and utterly delightful; whilst a 1999 big-screen version retained precious little of the original Austen story except for the title.  This 2007 version I'd place somewhere in the middle.Viewing all of these new Austen adaptations recently, it's come to my notice that all of them have tried to appeal to new viewers by casting the stories with popular younger talents.  In MANSFIELD PARK, former pop singer and ""Dr Who"" heroine Billie Piper stars as Fanny Price, the put-upon young orphan who goes to live with rich relations, the Bertrams of Mansfield Park.At Mansfield Park, Fanny is regarded as the poor relation and is expected to comply with their every wish.  Only Edmund Bertram (Blake Ritson - 2009's ""Emma"" and ""Upstairs Downstairs"") treats her with the regard he shows his other siblings.  When Sir Thomas Bertram (Douglas Hodge) is called away to Antigua on urgent business, the Bertrams fall prey to the manipulations of their new neighbours, Mary Crawford (Hayley Atwell - ""The Sally Lockhart Mysteries"") and her brother Henry (Joseph Beattie).  Whilst Henry's quest to lure away the soon-to-be-married Maria (Michelle Ryan) is underway, Mary finds Edmund more challenging.  Upon Sir Thomas' return, Fanny is shocked to learn that the Bertrams wish her to marry Henry - despite what she has observed of his blatant seduction of Maria.  Once again, only Edmund is there to offer a comforting shoulder, but the events about to unfold will cause the Bertrams to view Fanny in an entirely new light...There are two big stumbling blocks with this version of MANSFIELD PARK.  One is the length: there's a reason why the last BBC miniseries approached 6 hours in total.  One cannot enjoy the subtleties in Austen's original tale when everything is alarmingly sped up (and many important plot points chopped out) in order to tell the story in 93 minutes.  The other objection may be Billie Piper's casting as Fanny.  She isn't the Fanny from the novel at all, running around the gardens, talking back to Aunt Norris; not to mention that her blonde hair teamed with black eyebrows hardly fits the period.Fanny is supposed to be meek, compliant and so devoted to her family at Mansfield Park that, at one point, she seriously considers going through with the marriage to Henry because she cannot bear to make them unhappy or worse, make them think she is ungrateful.  Although I eventually warmed to Ms Piper in the role, I believe she would have been better-cast as Mary Crawford.  Sylvestra Le Touzel in the 1983 BBC miniseries shall always be my ideal screen Fanny Price.Blake Ritson is a fabulous Edmund and Hayley Atwell brings us a most beguiling, kittenish Mary Crawford.  The Bertrams are handled with great sensitivity, and I loved Douglas Hodge as Sir Thomas.  Jemma Redgrave, I'm happy to report, finally gave me a Lady Bertram that I could completely warm to, as opposed to the detached creature portrayed in previous versions.  Maggie O'Neill (TV's ""Shameless"") is delicious as the icy Aunt Norris.Amongst other credits, screenwriter Maggie Wadey has previously written ""The Buccaneers"" in addition to the *admittedly problematic* 1986 BBC version of ""Northanger Abbey"", so she already has cache amongst the period drama set.  It's just a shame that she wasn't commissioned to write a longer miniseries version, as MANSFIELD PARK simply doesn't work as well in a conventional movie-length treatment.  Despite the shortcomings it remains enjoyable, though I suspect it will be more so for the casual viewers who don't know what is missing.",4,"""You think if you shake me hard enough something profound will come out, but I assure you, I am profoundly shallow""",1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,3882,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'spoiled', 'late', '2007-2009', 'BBC', 'ITV', 'commissioned', 'brand', 'new', 'versions', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Persuasion', 'Emma', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'BBC', 'previous', 'miniseries', 'version', '1983', 'would', 'single', 'out', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'faithfully-drawn', 'utterly', 'delightful', '1999', 'big-screen', 'version', 'retained', 'precious', 'little', 'original', 'Austen', 'story', 'title', '2007', 'version', ""'d"", 'place', 'somewhere', 'middle.Viewing', 'new', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'recently', 'come', 'notice', 'have', 'tried', 'appeal', 'new', 'viewers', 'casting', 'stories', 'popular', 'younger', 'talents', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'former', 'pop', 'singer', 'Dr', 'Who', 'heroine', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'put-upon', 'young', 'orphan', 'who', 'live', 'rich', 'relations', 'Bertrams', 'Mansfield', 'Park.At', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Fanny', 'regarded', 'poor', 'relation', 'expected', 'comply', 'wish', 'Only', 'Edmund', 'Bertram', 'Blake', 'Ritson', '2009', 'Emma', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'regard', 'other', 'siblings', 'When', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Bertram', 'Douglas', 'Hodge', 'called', 'away', 'Antigua', 'urgent', 'business', 'Bertrams', 'fall', 'prey', 'manipulations', 'new', 'neighbours', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Sally', 'Lockhart', 'Mysteries', 'brother', 'Henry', 'Joseph', 'Beattie', 'Whilst', 'Henry', 'quest', 'lure', 'away', 'soon-to-be-married', 'Maria', 'Michelle', 'Ryan', 'underway', 'Mary', 'Edmund', 'more', 'challenging', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'return', 'Fanny', 'shocked', 'learn', 'Bertrams', 'wish', 'marry', 'Henry', 'what', 'observed', 'blatant', 'seduction', 'Maria', 'Once', 'again', 'only', 'Edmund', 'there', 'offer', 'comforting', 'shoulder', 'events', 'unfold', 'will', 'cause', 'Bertrams', 'view', 'Fanny', 'entirely', 'new', 'light', 'are', 'two', 'big', 'stumbling', 'blocks', 'version', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'One', 'length', 'reason', 'why', 'last', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'approached', '6', 'hours', 'total', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'subtleties', 'Austen', 'original', 'tale', 'when', 'everything', 'alarmingly', 'sped', 'up', 'many', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'chopped', 'out', 'order', 'tell', 'story', '93', 'minutes', 'other', 'objection', 'may', 'be', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'casting', 'Fanny', ""n't"", 'Fanny', 'novel', 'running', 'gardens', 'talking', 'back', 'Aunt', 'Norris', 'not', 'mention', 'blonde', 'hair', 'teamed', 'black', 'eyebrows', 'hardly', 'period.Fanny', 'supposed', 'be', 'meek', 'compliant', 'so', 'devoted', 'family', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'one', 'point', 'seriously', 'considers', 'going', 'marriage', 'Henry', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'make', 'unhappy', 'worse', 'make', 'think', 'ungrateful', 'eventually', 'warmed', 'Ms', 'Piper', 'role', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better-cast', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'Sylvestra', 'Le', 'Touzel', '1983', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'shall', 'always', 'be', 'ideal', 'screen', 'Fanny', 'Price.Blake', 'Ritson', 'fabulous', 'Edmund', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'most', 'beguiling', 'kittenish', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'Bertrams', 'are', 'handled', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'loved', 'Douglas', 'Hodge', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Jemma', 'Redgrave', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'finally', 'gave', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'could', 'completely', 'warm', 'opposed', 'detached', 'creature', 'portrayed', 'previous', 'versions', 'Maggie', ""O'Neill"", 'TV', 'Shameless', 'delicious', 'icy', 'Aunt', 'Norris.Amongst', 'other', 'credits', 'screenwriter', 'Maggie', 'Wadey', 'previously', 'written', 'Buccaneers', 'addition', '*admittedly', 'problematic*', '1986', 'BBC', 'version', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'already', 'cache', 'period', 'drama', 'set', 'just', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'commissioned', 'write', 'longer', 'miniseries', 'version', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'conventional', 'movie-length', 'treatment', 'shortcomings', 'enjoyable', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'so', 'casual', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'missing']",Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park

1121186,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000Z27HMW,,"[4, 6]","Jane Austen was and is one of my favorite authors, her Pride and PrejudiceThe Jane Austen Collection: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion (Halcyon Classics)being my favorite.  Mind you, this is from someone who rarely reads narrative fiction except for murder mysteries and who thinks sitting down with a popular book on physics or a biography of Richard II is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Austen's sense of character and of the manners--no pun intended--of her time is flawless.  Though it's not my favorite Austen novel, Mansfield Park has its moments.There are several cinematic Mansfield Parks out there from which to chooseMansfield Park (1999),Mansfield Park (BBC, 1986), etc.  It would appear that, like Louisa May Alcott'sLittle Women (Signet Classics), every generation must have its own version with its own stars,Little Women (Collector's Series)(Winona Ryder),Little Women( June Allison), andLittle Women (1933)(Katherine Hepburn).  I've seen at least two---and part of a third---and of those I've viewed from credits to credits this one, starting Billie Piper as Fannie, is quite good; I think that it certainly conveys the author's intentions.  The complexity of the novel, with its wheels within wheels, has been much pared down to suit a two hour production, but the central issue of the rot of overindulgence, vanity, and deceit and its effects on society is quite clear.  Less clear is the issue of slavery, the foundation of the Bertram family's wealth, which is only alluded to in passing when Mr. Bertram is forced to go to the West Indies to deal with urgent ""problems"" there that effect their financial situation. (England was beginning to question the morality of slavery, which it abolished in the 1830s, and Austen was composing the novel during the opening years of the century).The Bertram family has done all the ""correct"" things dictated by society and on this yardstick has measured itself  ""successful.""  Smug in its sense of its own worth, the family invites a young relative, eight year old Fanny the daughter of the ""unfortunate"" sister of Mrs. Bertram, to live with them and enjoy the benefits of her connection.  Essentially they need an appreciative audience whose duty is to be ""grateful"" and humbled by the Bertram family's status.  (In other versions, the sycophantic Aunt Norris shows us how it's done).  Her presence in the family is to be a constant reminder of how perfect their lives are compared to those of others.  Instead the little girl misses her own family and is intimidated rather than awed by the excesses she sees around her.  The limits that Mr. Bertram places on his generosity to his niece because she is not quite ""acceptable"" actually allow Fanny to grow up normal in the midst of the dysfunction of his own family.  When the fruits of his arrogant sense of identity become apparent by the ruination of his eldest daughter's reputation and the near death of his eldest son and heir through drink, Bertram finally admits that it is only the sensible Fanny upon whom he can depend.The stifling boredom arising from a life lived in affluence but without purpose is made abundantly clear by Mrs. Bertram and her children.  The lady shows utter devotion to her pug dogs whose litters she is apparently allowed to raise herself, and she has a propensity for falling asleep anytime there is a family gathering.  She lies languidly on her couch, doing little or nothing, day in and day out, while her children are raised by and her home managed by others.  Her eldest son is so overwhelmed by boredom and purposelessness that he gambles and drinks himself nearly to death, while her youngest finds it difficult to make decisions without first consulting Fanny and even begins to question his choice of professions because his infatuation over his neighbor has brought this choice into conflict with her ambitions.  Mrs. Bertram's eldest daughter is so used to getting her way in everything, that she sees no reason why she shouldn't have a rich husband and an exciting and handsome lover.  And her youngest daughter simply disappears into London ""society.""  This is the ""perfect life"" only if you are Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss,Candide.The WGBH Boston production of Mansfield Park is played straight; that is to say, it's entirely serious and straight forward.  Little by way of levity occurs.  This is the ""Henrick Ibsen"" version of the story, so to speak.  There is another, more George Bernard Shaw, version where some of the characters, particularly Aunt Norris and Aunt Bertram, are played as more comedic and where the family's complete dependence on Fanny borders on obsession.  Although I enjoyed it very much when I saw it on TV, I'm not certain it really conveyed the author's intentions nearly as well as this one does.Costumes---a strong presence in many of the WGHB Boston/BBC productions---are not quite as stunning in this instance, though they're probably more realistic for the times.  One of the wedding gowns is quite lovely--though I hated the hat--but otherwise the costumes designed for this version are less impressive.  The scenery too is somewhat lacking, which is amazing given that even a series likeMidsomer Murders: Set 16orAgatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collectionis able to convey an intensity of natural verdure that is positively breath taking.  Admitting that some of the dialogue indicates the appreciation of the natural vistas of Mansfield Park--as opposed to the often overdone formal gardens of such estates--one might still expect more of a sense of from whence this appreciation arises. Even fields in England can be glorious works of ""art,"" but those viewed from Mansfield Park are just boring--like the people perhaps?Accurate but not aesthetic.",3,Accurate but not

It's a bit slow, (but so is the book) but very faithful to the spirit of the novel. This film, whatever it is, is not Mansfield Park, nor is the actress in any way Fanny. Fanny was reserved, shy, and not strong. The girl in this movie had her breasts and hair continually flopping about and her face (under her two tone hair) bore a perpetually sulky smirk that seemed to be trying for sultriness.  Her wild behavior (and appearance) bears no resemblance to the character in the book. The rest of the film wasn't too bad, but with the central character so out of character, it was hard to enjoy anything else.Whoever did this adaption appears to have been influenced by the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" version of Pride and Prejudice that had equally bizarre behavior on the part of the main characters.

Her turn in ""Shakespeare Retold: Much Ado About Nothing"" was excellent, and though I haven't seen all her episodes, I found Piper's Rose very good as well.  She more than held up her own against veterans like David Tennant and especially Christopher Eccleston.""Mansfield Park"", though, was very bad.  Very...not good.Fanny is supposed to be a mousy, sickly creature; it's why Edmund gives her a horse to ride for exercise every day.  When she misses a few days, she gets sick.  Why is Fanny running about and chasing people around the house?  I can't tell if this is poor script or poor acting or both.  This is not Fanny Price.Most people have picked up on the major plot alteration as well, with Fanny not being forced to leave Mansfield Park despite her rejection of Crawford.  It's a major plot and character point - Fanny getting kicked around and basically living at the whim of the Bertrams.  Also, her rejection of Crawford is a major, major problem, and her being sent away is evidence of that.To be honest, I can't remember much more; it was kind of painful to watch.  Not any better than the 1999 Frances O'Connor ""Mansfield Park"", though I personally wouldn't say it was worse.  (1999's Fanny the budding writer?!)  Austen sighs in her grave and hopes Andrew Davies will write the next ""Mansfield Park"" adaptation.What was good?  Blake Ritson turned in a fairly good Edmund, and Hayley Atwell turned in a fantastic Mary Crawford, with all her complexity - her kindness towards Fanny, her protectiveness towards Fanny, and her moral laxness.  I'm biased towards Jemma Redgrave.  I was also amused that the Bionic Woman played Maria Bertram and that young Fanny (Julia Joyce) had played the younger version of Billie Piper's characters twice before.It might look stagy, but I found the 1980s BBC ""Mansfield Park"" truer to the book than either of the new versions.  Nicholas Farrell and Sylvestra Le Touzel in their first cooperative outing were good.

She would have been better as a naughty chambermaid than someone brought up in an aristocrat's home.  Another victim of inaccurate hair and make-up was Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford) who had a 2007 hair style and sculpted eyebrows which were lovely, but completely wrong for the time.  Her casual speech and flirtatious actions would have had no place in formal Regency society.The actors playing Fanny's aunt and uncle were too young and lacked a lord and lady's proper breeding.

Strip Austen of layers, if you must, but her genius is so forgiving that a worthwhile (i.e., passionate) story still exists. Couple that with the dexterous acting of Blake Ritson, Billie Piper and cast, and you have an enjoyable movie that brings the past to life in vivid colour.  The beginning is a bit awkwardly done, and if you stand on the letter of the law, so to speak, you will find fault (as many have, see more reviews) but if you can view the film for what it does offer, there is much to be enjoyed. (Other than Piper's hair; pretty, but shockingly improper for a regency miss!) And Hayley Atwell does a tantalizing Mary Crawford though her forwardness in the film would have forewarned the devout Edmund long before the scriptwriters allowed him to catch on to her true nature here. Her facial mannerisms are so well-done that she comes across rather likeable, despite her faults. Poor Fannie is good, to be sure, but more child-like than Austen intended, and her good choices seem to come more from a strong childish passion rather than sense or strong wits. Nevertheless, you will be drawn in and swept along to a strong ending that is great fun. (And I do love fun--or I wouldn't be a regency romance author, would I?)",5,"Passion, not purity, is the key",1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1445,"['dearly', 'love', 'Austen', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'could', 'agree', 'much', 'what', 'wrote', 'missing', 'adaptation', 'nevertheless', 'can', 'appreciate', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'still', 'delightful', 'costume', 'drama', 'Strip', 'Austen', 'layers', 'must', 'genius', 'so', 'forgiving', 'worthwhile', 'i.e.', 'passionate', 'story', 'still', 'Couple', 'dexterous', 'acting', 'Blake', 'Ritson', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'cast', 'have', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'past', 'life', 'vivid', 'colour', 'beginning', 'bit', 'awkwardly', 'done', 'stand', 'letter', 'law', 'so', 'speak', 'will', 'find', 'fault', 'many', 'have', 'see', 'more', 'reviews', 'can', 'view', 'film', 'what', 'offer', 'much', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'Other', 'Piper', 'hair', 'pretty', 'shockingly', 'improper', 'regency', 'miss', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'tantalizing', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'forwardness', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'forewarned', 'devout', 'Edmund', 'long', 'scriptwriters', 'allowed', 'catch', 'true', 'nature', 'here', 'facial', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'so', 'well-done', 'rather', 'likeable', 'faults', 'Poor', 'Fannie', 'good', 'be', 'sure', 'more', 'child-like', 'Austen', 'intended', 'good', 'choices', 'seem', 'come', 'more', 'strong', 'childish', 'passion', 'rather', 'sense', 'strong', 'wits', 'Nevertheless', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'swept', 'along', 'strong', 'ending', 'great', 'fun', 'do', 'love', 'fun', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'regency', 'romance', 'author', 'would']",Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park
1121199,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B000Z27HMW,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[265, 284]","It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen fans have yet to find an adaptation of ""Mansfield Park"" that truly does justice to the novel.  ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""Persuasion"" have their share of successes, with the 1995 versions and the recent versions having (for the most part) become instant classics and fan favorites.  But not so for poor ""Mansfield Park.""I wanted so badly to love this version, especially with all the press hoopla surrounding the casting of Billie Piper (Dr. Who). The 1980s version starring Sylvestra Le Touzel remains the most faithful adaptation of the book, but has become outdated, is slow moving and tends to drag in places. The 1990s version starring Frances O'Connor is an anathema to Austen purists. This is Mansfield Park in name only, and is a slap on the face for true fans of the book. In short, Janeites were ready for a new and improved adaptation of ""Mansfield Park.""Sadly though, this new version falls short of expectations. If you have not read the book, then you will probably like it. If you have - and especially if you count yourself as an Austen purist - then there are many aspects of this version that you may find irritating (or worse..).I dislike starting my reviews on a negative note, but I was disappointed with this one. Among the shortcomings are as follows (warning - SPOILERS):- Casting of Billie Piper and Maggie O'Neill. Personally, I find Billie's blonde hair and dark eyebrows very distracting and far too modern for a period piece. Ladies in the Regency era tied their hair back in a bun but the filmmakers totally disregarded this and left Billie to run around like a wild child instead of a proper Regency lady.  I also took issue to Maggie O'Neill who was not quite the right age and was a tad too ""fine looking"" as the widow Mrs. Norris.- Very choppy beginning. It almost feels like the first half hour is filmed in hand-held camera.  It is annoying and gave me a headache.- Too many scenes were altered or omitted entirely. Many characters do not even make an appearance.  There is no visit to the Price family home in Portsmouth; no visit to the Rushworth home; Maria and Julia Bertram disappear in the second act, when Maria and Rushworth marry; Maria and Julia Bertram and Mr. Yates are mere cyphers and don't have much to do; other than William Price, all the other Prices (including Susan) are absent in this story...and the list goes on.- Scenes jump around and there is little coherence to the screenplay. Novices to the story will be confused (especially in the beginning) as new characters come and go, there is little character development and no fluidity as the scenes move from one to another.  Everything in the first act is rushed and you feel like the filmmakers are trying to cram hundreds of pages of storyline into the first half hour.There is, however, a light at the end of the tunnel.  The story does improve as you go along and the last half hour provides some memorable highlights.  Blake Ritson's Edmund proves to be swoon-worthy in some key (romantic) scenes from the book.  The 'thunderbolt' scene (you will know what I mean when you see it) up until the end is certainly worth seeing.  Jemma Redgrave's Lady Bertram also does some scene stealing of her own.Most of the cast are perfect for their roles.  Blake Ritson is quite dashing (in a solemn, Byronic way) and handsome as Edmund Bertram and Joe Beattie makes for a charming and attractive Henry Crawford.  Jemma Redgrave, Douglas Hodge (Sir Thomas Bertram), Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford), Michelle Ryan (Maria Bertram) and others are well cast.  Hayley Atwell shines as the scheming, manipulative and lovely Mary Crawford. Jemma Redgrave's portrayal of Lady Bertram is a change from the book, but I actually liked it.  She gave an otherwise bland character added dimension and some warmth.  Douglas Hodge (a veteran of British period dramas) is excellent as always.All in all, this version has a bumpy beginning but a much improved second act, overall good casting, mediocre screenplay and what appears to be a relatively low budget (all of the scenes were filmed in one location - yes, no kidding).  If you want a more faithful adaptation of Mansfield Park, look to the 1980s version starring Sylvestra Le Touzel and Nicholas Farrell (who, incidently, play Mrs. Allen and Mr. Musgrove in the new versions of ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Persuasion"", respectively).Of the 3 recent Austen tv adaptations, this is my least favorite. For my choices in the recent Masterpiece Theater dramas, my vote goes to ""Northanger Abbey"" with ""Persuasion"" a distant second.  I have yet to see the new version of ""Sense & Sensibility"" so I will reserve judgement until then.  This ""Mansfield Park"" is certainly worth a viewing, just make sure to keep your expectations in check.",3,Could have been better......,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,4821,"['truth', 'universally',

The first couple of minutes take you well into the book with almost dizzying speed. I have never been a big fan of Fanny and she ties Emma as one of my  least favorite Jane Austen characters as she is a sickly, righteous young lady whose sole distinction is her goodness.  After allowing some time to pass between the rereading and then re-watching I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Mansfield Park, such as it is, which is to say, in many ways, it is not.  Lady Bertram, as portrayed by Jane Austen, can barely summon the strength to breathe, let alone share an insightful thought, but in this MS she is perceptive.  Mrs. Norris, her sister, is robbed of all her malevolent, insipid and ultimately destructive  nature and is quite passive. Her behavior in the book results in grave character flaws in  Maria and Julia.  Fanny as portrayed by Billie Piper is an enjoyable character,and, unlike the Fanny in the book one can understand why Mr. Crawford and Edmund fall in love with her.

First of all, they carefully cast all the characters extremely well, except Fanny, the central character- just ridiculous!  Fanny has to exude quiet intelligence which has not been given its due because of the combination of a shy nature and the way she has been treated or there is no point to the story.  Secondly, they have telescoped the story into an hour and a half by eliminating most of Jane Austen's best dialogue which is exactly what makes the story so worthwhile. This is not a tale that can be told though a series of occurrences which the screenwriter attempted.  It is painful to watch.  If only they had cast Fanny properly, the production would have been tolerable!A word about the aunts- they are pretty much one-dimensional archtypes in the book.  The movie humanizes indolent Aunt Bertram especially in the end which is probably a good thing although it is done inconsistently and clumsily- the idea would have been to keep the idea of the detached, spoiled, unproductive  upper class without being totally dehumanizing.  On the other hand, the removal of the mean spirited, better-than-thou edginess of Aunt Norris with an attractive, bland character was, well, a stupid way of undermining the whole theme of the book- yes, the book may have indeed been a bit too repetitive without added dimension, but her role is pivotal and needed to be kept in some form.",1,What a Mess!!!!!!!!,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,1402,"['inexcusable', 'First', 'carefully', 'cast', 'characters', 'extremely', 'well', 'Fanny', 'central', 'character-', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Fanny', 'exude', 'quiet', 'intelligence', 'not', 'been', 'given', 'due', 'combination', 'shy', 'nature', 'way', 'been', 'treated', 'point', 'story', 'Secondly', 'have', 'telescoped', 'story', 'hour', 'half', 'eliminating', 'most', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'best', 'dialogue', 'exactly', 'what', 'story', 'so', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'tale', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'series', 'occurrences', 'screenwriter', 'attempted', 'painful', 'watch', 'only', 'had', 'cast', 'Fanny', 'properly', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tolerable', 'word', 'aunts-', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'one-dimensional', 'archtypes', 'book', 'movie', 'indolent', 'Aunt', 'Bertram', 'especially', 'end', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'done', 'inconsistently', 'clumsily-', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'keep', 'idea', 'detached', 'spoiled', 'unproductive', 'upper', 'class', 'being', 'totally', 'dehumanizing', 'other', 'hand', 'removal', 'mean', 'spirited', 'better-than-thou', 'edginess', 'Aunt', 'Norris', 'attractive', 'bland', 'character', 'was', 'well', 'stupid', 'way', 'undermining', 'whole', 'theme', 'book-', 'yes', 'book', 'may', 'have', 'indeed', 'been', 'bit', 'too', 'repetitive', 'added', 'dimension', 'role', 'pivotal', 'needed', 'be', 'kept', 'form']",Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park
1121202,AMAOS41TZ1V89,B000Z27HMW,Price Grisham,"[98, 108]","As an Austen scholar, I was bracing myself for something that would take liberties with the novel, but it seems that the screenwriter must surely have read only the Cliff notes. Even then, the early part's first-person narrative made me wonder if s/he had picked up her abbreviated version of Jane Eyre instead. An estate called Mansfield Park is indeed involved, but that's about as close it gets.Even such a massive rewrite might have been tolerable with some accurate historical research, but there are SO many funny mistakes in the representation of both the characters and the period that it was hard to believe this production could appear on (the program once known as) Masterpiece Theatre.One could hardly determine which was longer and bounced more--Fanny's full and unbound hair or her full and nearly unbound cleavage, as the charity-case companion races shrieking and laughing through the estate. Nor should you look for the novel's complacent, drowsy, plump Lady Bertram (for whom so many have a secret affection); the beautiful but miscast Jemma Redgrave presents an elegant, intelligent mother with sharp insight.But there's worse. When Henry Crawford drags Maria behind the curtain and declares himself her lover as they grope and grab, I nearly gagged; and when Edmund sits next to a sprawling Fanny after the picnic (no ball) and tells her how lovely she looks, I did gag. Plus, Fanny's absolutely central visit to Portsmith is axed. I don't mind streamlining when the end product is smooth and historically and literarily accurate, but this production was jumpy and jumbled.When the whole thing finally closes with a WALTZ in 1810, it was I who was shrieking with laughter--eveyone knows that dance did not come out until 20 years later and THEN was considered very racy; certainly not something a reserved clergyman from the upper classes would have initiated at his rural Tory wedding. Good lord, who wrote this mess anyway, Barbara Cartland?Which is a real shame, because the marvelous actors and actresses (except for the lovely Miss Redgrave) looked right for their parts--and I'm sure we'll see them again in hopefully better material.

As always, there is not a great adaptation of Mansfield Park available: the 80's version is fairly true to the book, but that Fanny is not my favorite in casting: the 90's version is too modernernized, and this one again, just ends up missing the mark.  For one, the story is too much condensed, with so much being left out, that I was almost shocked, for one, to have met Mr Rushworth within the first 4 minutes of the film.The casting of Billie Piper worked out somewhat: she does a good job of being active of mind and body, but never quite gets the tone of humbleness and quiet servitude which should also accompany this, in the person of Fanny Price.  Her blond hair hanging loose and wild (it's never up in a proper Regency hairdo) is far too unrealistic for me, to what would have been expected of a young Regency woman, poor dependent or not (I'm sorry, but her hair would have always been up or pulled back!  EXCEPT maybe when she's in her own bedroom).  Blake Ritson as Edmund is fine casting, as well as Hayley Atwell as Mary Crawford, Joseph Beattie as Henry Crawford, and Jemma Redgrave as Lady Betram.  I found the whole story a bit rushed and stilted, and it seemed to be a whirlwind: if I, avid reader of Jane Austen, had trouble following the storyline, how much more so would someone who had not read the book?Content: there are some things to be aware of: some cleavage is shown, sexual innuendos, an engaged woman kisses a man who is not her fianc&eacute;, there is talk of a scandal where a married woman runs off with another man, a scene where a woman is washing her hair in a basin and a man comes in to talk with her, there is not much else: it is pretty tame.Although it was a bit of a disappointment, I can appreciate certain moments in the film, where the fine acting of some shines through, and with good costuming to eye and things along that line, it is an enjoyable way to wile away 90 minutes: not up to par they way that I would have hoped, but all in all, and enjoyable version of Mansfield Park until one better comes along.",3,A decent adaptation of Mansfield Park,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,2241,"['three', 'iTV', '90-minute', 'films', 'done', 'year', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'least', 'favorite', 'Persuasion', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'were', 'just', 'much', 'better', 'done', 'even', 'faults', 'foibles', 'always', 'not', 'great', 'adaptation', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'available', '80', 'version', 'fairly', 'true', 'book', 'Fanny', 'not', 'favorite', 'casting', '90', 'version', 'too', 'modernernized', 'one', 'again', 'just', 'up', 'missing', 'mark', 'one', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'condensed', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'almost', 'shocked', 'one', 'have', 'met', 'Mr', 'Rushworth', 'first', '4', 'minutes', 'film.The', 'casting', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'worked', 'out', 'somewhat', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'active', 'mind', 'body', 'never', 'quite', 'tone', 'humbleness', 'quiet', 'servitude', 'should', 'also', 'accompany', 'person', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'blond', 'hair', 'hanging', 'loose', 'wild', 'never', 'up', 'proper', 'Regency', 'hairdo', 'far', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'young', 'Regency', 'woman', 'poor', 'dependent', 'not', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'hair', 'would', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'up', 'pulled', 'back', 'EXCEPT', 'maybe', 'when', 'own', 'bedroom', 'Blake', 'Ritson', 'Edmund', 'fine', 'casting', 'as', 'well', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'Joseph', 'Beattie', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'Jemma', 'Redgrave', 'Lady', 'Betram', 'found', 'whole', 'story', 'bit', 'rushed', 'stilted', 'seemed', 'be', 'whirlwind', 'avid', 'reader', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'storyline', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'would', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'Content', 'are', 'things', 'be', 'aware', 'cleavage', 'shown', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'engaged', 'woman', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'talk', 'scandal', 'where', 'married', 'woman', 'man', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'washing', 'hair', 'basin', 'man', 'talk', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'pretty', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'can', 'appreciate', 'certain', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'fine', 'acting', 'shines', 'good', 'costuming', 'eye', 'things', 'line', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'wile', 'away', '90', 'minutes', 'not', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'enjoyable', 'version', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'one', 'better', 'along']",Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park

Fanny Price as a flirty, pouty,  bosoms almost falling out, bottle blonde with bed hair and  an acting style straight out of  ""Tom Jones""  pretty much ruins the whole thing singlehandedly. The intended villainess, Mary Crawford, looks downright demure by comparison and a far more suitable match for a clergyman.  Then there's the inconsistent  uncle  who starts out  Simon Legree and ends up Father Knows Best.  And the otherwise adequate and attractive  actor playing Edmund who's given about 15 seconds of close-up across the family breakfast table to show, with just his face,  the aha! moment when he realizes it's Fanny he loves after all.  That  scene alone may end up  earning  this movie a place in  the so-bad-it's-funny pile.

Most fans of Austen have read the original books, so we understand much of the manners, custom and dress of the times, and have certain expectations. Other reviewers have pointed out the problems, and I agree with them. I also could not get past Fanny's appearance (which was more like a bar maid than even a servant) to have any empathy for the character. I did not understand the director's decision to dress everyone else in the piece for the period and not the main character. Keeping every scene in one spot and mostly in the same room might have been cost effective but hardly does justice to the richer world that Austen was so adept at portraying. Although I own most DVD versions of other Austen productions, I know I will not want to see this again.

I was therefore pretty disappointed when I watched ""Mansfield Park"" master piece theater the first time...Here a short list of the major aspects (there is unfortunately more) that made me dislike this version;The actress cast as Fanny Price (Billie Piper) while is not bad expressing Fanny's demure personality, she seems physically all wrong.  Her hair, looks stringy, color is really brassy (VERY FAKE LOOKING) and as other readers have mentioned not historically correct!  Why is it always down?  And for the most part looks like it hasn't been brushed!  Also the dark eyebrows and hint of mascara were really distracting!  She shows a bit too much cleavage for Fanny which might be plausible ONLY for her ""special picnic""The character of Henry Crawford is really unlikable, there is not one moment in the film where you wonder, is he misjudged? Is he really a changed man?  That is one of the most entertaining parts of the story, is just when you start to believe that Henry Crawford might be a changed man, you discovered that you are being fooled!  This was missing in the movie, maybe because they have not devoted to much time showing Crawford trying to win Fanny's affection..  The older version staring Frances O Connor developed the relationship between Fanny & Crawford thoroughly.You don't get to see just how poor Fanny's parents are in comparison to the Bertram's (it is mentioned only), thus it is more difficult to establish why Fanny feels like such an outsider at Mansfield Park.Mrs. Norris is not as comical as she is in the book nor the other older movie version of Mansfield Park...There was one thing that I did enjoy in this Mansfield Park, which the version staring Frances O Connor was missing....The close relationship of Fanny's and her brother William, as this character is totally missing from the older movie version.I give it 2 stars for the nice costumes, set decorations and beautiful location.",2,Disappointment,1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,2110,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'newer', 'versions', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'favorites', 'were', 'works', 'automatically', 'pre', 'ordered', 'thinking', 'Austen', 'how', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'was', 'therefore', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'when', 'watched', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'master', 'piece', 'theater', 'first', 'time', 'Here', 'short', 'list', 'major', 'aspects', 'unfortunately', 'more', 'made', 'dislike', 'version', 'actress', 'cast', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'while', 'not', 'bad', 'expressing', 'Fanny', 'demure', 'personality', 'physically', 'wrong', 'hair', 'stringy', 'color', 'really', 'brassy', 'VERY', 'FAKE', 'LOOKING', 'other', 'readers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'not', 'historically', 'correct', 'Why', 'always', 'down', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'been', 'brushed', 'Also', 'dark', 'eyebrows', 'hint', 'mascara', 'were', 'really', 'distracting', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'cleavage', 'Fanny', 'might', 'be', 'plausible', 'ONLY', 'special', 'picnic', 'character', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'really', 'unlikable', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'wonder', 'misjudged', 'really', 'changed', 'man', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'story', 'just', 'when', 'start', 'believe', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'might', 'be', 'changed', 'man', 'discovered', 'are', 'being', 'fooled', 'was', 'missing', 'movie', 'maybe', 'have', 'not', 'devoted', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'Crawford', 'trying', 'win', 'Fanny', 'affection..', 'older', 'version', 'staring', 'Frances', 'O', 'Connor', 'developed', 'relationship', 'Fanny', 'Crawford', 'thoroughly.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'poor', 'Fanny', 'parents', 'are', 'comparison', 'Bertram', 'mentioned', 'only', 'thus', 'more', 'difficult', 'establish', 'why', 'Fanny', 'feels', 'outsider', 'Mansfield', 'Park.Mrs', 'Norris', 'not', 'as', 'comical', 'book', 'other', 'older', 'movie', 'version', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'version', 'staring', 'Frances', 'O', 'Connor', 'was', 'missing', '.The', 'close', 'relationship', 'Fanny', 'brother', 'William', 'character', 'totally', 'missing', 'older', 'movie', 'version.I', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'nice', 'costumes', 'set', 'decorations', 'beautiful', 'location']",Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park
1121207,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000Z27HMW,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","The 1986 BBC adaptation of Mansfield Park remains in my opinion the most faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's work. Starring Sylvestra Le Touzel as Fanny Price and Nicholas Farrell as Edmund Bertram, the two leads were a bit tepid in their performances, yet the script was quite faithful, perhaps too much so. Then we had the 1999 movie version of Mansfield Park starring Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price. Though she acted very well with the given script, the version was so far removed from Austen's work as to render it alien, and could only be appreciated if viewed as a story by itself, without drawing comparisons with Austen's work [for one, O'Connor's Fanny was way too spirited and audacious].And now we come to the 2007 adaptation of Mansfield Park, starring Billie Piper [of ""Doctor Who""] as Fanny Price, who at the age of ten is sent by her impoverished mother to live with her wealthy sister, Lady Bertram [Jemma Redgrave] and her family comprising husband, Lord Bertram, daughters Mariah and Julia, and sons Tom [James D'arcy] and Edmund [Blake Ritson]. Young Fanny knows her place and grows up loving her cousin Edmund [yes, it was apparently acceptable back in Austen's time]. Enter the scheming Mary Crawford [Hayley Atwell] ,and her brother Henry [Joseph Beattie] who worm themselves into Mansfield Park and cause much havoc within the family - Henry flirting with Mariah, and Mary setting her cap at Edmund, much to Fanny's chagrin. What follows is Fanny's journey through heartache, awakening, and finally happiness.The acting in this version was not all that commendable - Billie Piper's Fanny with her striking blond locks and contrasting dark eyebrows is a far cry from Austen's portrayal of the demure and sickly Fanny Price in the novel. The rest of the cast too are quite lukewarm in their performances. Blake Ritson's Edmund, though very good-looking was very shallow and unconvincing,especially in his ardor for Ms Crawford. It is only in the later part that he seems to portray some semblance of sincerity in his newly discovered love for Fanny. Hayley Atwell's Mary Crawford does carry a semblance of credibility in her role and even manages to upstage Fanny Price at times.This version takes too many liberties with Austen's work - the characters here are not faithful to the ones portrayed in the book, even the minor characters like Lady Bertram who was sickly in the novel,seems enthused with enough energy to pass energetic comments in this version. Many important scenes are cut out as are characters, and there is not much character development at all. It all appears like a rush job with disastrous consequences for the storyline.The sets and cinematography though are beautifully done and the scenes of the countryside are particularly enchanting. On the whole, I can't say I love this latest adaptation of Mansfield Park [which seems to be the only one of Austen's works to fare so poorly in its screen adaptations], yet it is watchable, and makes for light entertainment.",3,"Not the best adaptation, yet watchable",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,3010,"['1986', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'opinion', 'most', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'work', 'Starring', 'Sylvestra', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'Edmund', 'Bertram', 'two', 'leads', 'were', 'bit', 'tepid', 'performances', 'yet', 'script', 'was', 'quite', 'faithful', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'Then', 'had', '1999', 'movie', 'version', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'starring', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'Fanny', 'Price', 'acted', 'very', 'well', 'given', 'script', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'Austen', 'work', 'render', 'alien', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'viewed', 'story', 'drawing', 'comparisons', 'Austen', 'work', '[', 'one', ""O'Connor"", 'Fanny', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'spirited', 'audacious', ']', '.And', 'now', 'come', '2007', 'adaptation', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'starring', 'Billie', 'Piper', '[', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'who', 'age', 'ten', 'sent', 'impoverished', 'mother', 'live', 'wealthy', 'sister', 'Lady', 'Bertram', '[', 'Jemma', 'Redgrave', ']', 'family', 'comprising', 'husband', 'Lord', 'Bertram', 'daughters', 'Mariah', 'Julia', 'sons', 'Tom', '[', 'James', ""D'arcy"", ']', 'Edmund', '[', 'Blake', 'Ritson', ']', 'Young', 'Fanny', 'place', 'up', 'loving', 'cousin', 'Edmund', '[', 'yes', 'was', 'apparently', 'acceptable', 'back', 'Austen', 'time', ']', 'Enter', 'scheming', 'Mary', 'Crawford', '[', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', ']', 'brother', 'Henry', '[', 'Joseph', 'Beattie', ']', 'who', 'worm', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'cause', 'much', 'havoc', 'family', 'Henry', 'flirting', 'Mariah', 'Mary', 'setting', 'cap', 'Edmund', 'much', 'Fanny', 'chagrin', 'What', 'Fanny', 'journey', 'heartache', 'awakening', 'finally', 'happiness.The', 'acting', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'commendable', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Fanny', 'striking', 'blond', 'locks', 'contrasting', 'dark', 'eyebrows', 'far', 'cry', 'Austen', 'portrayal', 'demure', 'sickly', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'novel', 'rest', 'cast', 'too', 'are', 'quite', 'lukewarm', 'performances', 'Blake', 'Ritson', 'Edmund', 'though', 'very', 'good-looking', 'was', 'very', 'shallow', 'unconvincing', 'especially', 'ardor', 'Ms', 'Crawford', 'only', 'later', 'part', 'portray', 'semblance', 'sincerity', 'newly', 'discovered', 'love', 'Fanny', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'carry', 'semblance', 'credibility', 'role', 'even', 'manages', 'upstage', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'times.This', 'version', 'too', 'many', 'liberties', 'Austen', 'work', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'faithful', 'ones', 'portrayed', 'book', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'who', 'was', 'sickly', 'novel', 'enthused', 'enough', 'energy', 'pass', 'energetic', 'comments', 'version', 'Many', 'important', 'scenes', 'are', 'cut', 'out', 'are', 'characters', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'rush', 'job', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'storyline.The', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'scenes', 'countryside', 'are', 'particularly', 'enchanting', 'whole', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'love', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'Mansfield', 'Park', '[', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'Austen', 'works', 'fare', 'so', 'poorly', 'screen', 'adaptations', ']', 'watchable', 'light', 'entertainment']",Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park
