Copper Mountain is one of the latter. There is absolutely no reason to watch this, not even if you are a die hard Jim Carrey fan. This is half lame plot about a ski competition and half really talentless and annoying country music concert. Of all the bad movies I have seen this is the most boring and pointless of them all. The production values aren't as bad as Z-movie sci-fi classics like the Beast of Yucca Flatts, but the production here is still crap. This has to be in anyone's list of the top 5 worse movies of all time. For me it's the very worst.",1,Absolutely no redeeming qualities,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,695,"['are', 'bad', 'movies', 'are', 'entertaining', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'bad', 'movies', 'have', 'entertainment', 'value', 'whatsoever', 'Copper', 'Mountain', 'one', 'latter', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'watch', 'not', 'even', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'half', 'lame', 'plot', 'ski', 'competition', 'half', 'really', 'talentless', 'annoying', 'country', 'music', 'concert', 'bad', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'boring', 'pointless', 'production', 'values', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'Z-movie', 'sci-fi', 'classics', 'Beast', 'Yucca', 'Flatts', 'production', 'here', 'still', 'crap', 'be', 'anyone', 'list', 'top', '5', 'worse', 'movies', 'time', 'very', 'worst']",Copper Mountain: A Club Med Experience 1983

This is a glorified music video of horrible music. Jim Carey should not be on the cover of this movie either, as he is in about 15 to 20% of the whole thing. They should have had whoever the musical artist was. I honestly don't even know the plot of this movie, and I'm not kidding. I laughed so hard out loud ... when I had to read the back of the DVD case to remember what it was supposed to be about. The sound? They interlaced two songs (one in your right speaker, one in your left) that don't even match. If you want an idea for a good movie, read the back of this DVD case, and follow that plot, as the director sure steered clear of it. Alan Thicke ... I thought I knew ye! Oh, and I gave it one star only because I couldn't find the ""Give me my money back"" option.***EDIT*** It's currently selling at $.16 in the used section. That says something right there. It's almost tempting to buy to give to people. I go to a university out in OKC, and we've passed it around the dorm telling everyone ""It's the best movie ever!

Jim can't be himself around women and scares them off, and Alan wants to be the world's best skier. That 20 minute plot is wrapped around 40 minutes of music. It is almost makes no sense.
