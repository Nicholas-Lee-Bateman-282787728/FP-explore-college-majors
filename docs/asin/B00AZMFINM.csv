Even now, it seems to be generally panned, possibly for not being the triumphant, genre starting return fans had hoped for.  However, for the originators of horror parradody, this film takes up were Scary Movie 2 left off in terms of paying homage as much as it jests at the source material it would not exist without.This is a comedy; this is a parody; there is a pot smoking scene; google mandingo party before you watch.  Plot and character development are not the primary focus, nor is much given or expected.  In terms of the comedy, both Wayans and Essence Attkins provide hilarious slap stick as demons of a pastiched hell descend upon their abode.  Wayans steps away from a Shorty like character, which gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath before he freaks out again.  Atkins does an excellent job in reacting and provoking the startling actor while managing to keep her character grounded (except for, well...).  It is their performance that drives the movie by staying away from common parody archetypes that are just there to enact the plot. They may not be well rounded, but the actors playing them are assured of their role and seamlessly pass into this absurd world.The ensemble all provide apt performances; not standing out too far from another.  Perhaps because each portrayed characters they had previously done in other work.  Still, they provide honest laughs (google mandingo party) and not so over blown as seem ridiculous.

Also, while the jokes may seem sophomoric, the underlying narrative does hold critical weight.

Little does he know that Kisha has brought along a little extra baggage in the form of a pesky paranormal entity that terrorizes the couple in their new home! A HAUNTED HOUSE is the latest in a long slew of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY spoofs, this time putting SCARY MOVIE's Marlon Wayans in front of the camera as the terrified tenant, Malcolm. While the film contains the same stupid gags and raunchy humor as the other idiotic attempts like SUPERNATURAL ACTIVITY and 30 NIGHTS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY WITH THE DEVIL INSIDE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, we experience the difference between hiring trained comics and amateur actors first-hand. Wayans is as hilarious as ever playing Malcolm, and draws a laugh even out of the most childish and profane moments in the script. He is joined by several brilliant comics and bit players in equally funny roles, with appearances by David Koechner as Dan the Security Man, Nick Swardson as Chip the Psychic, and Cedric the Entertainer as the recently-released Father Williams. Individually, these characters are given many of the most memorable moments, but there is a clash of personalities as they all join together for the final act.

1618889,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00AZMFINM,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[0, 0]","Indulge me a metaphor. If cinema is sport then most genres, be they action, adventure, thriller, horror or romance, are some variety of the beautiful game: a careful build up from the back, fluid off-the ball movement, the odd languorous long ball into space, snappy interchanges in the middle of the park and clinical execution in the final third.Comedy spoofs are different. They are more like rugby (or football, for you uncultured Americans) on a wet day. It's about having a game plan, following it, and after that, tackling. Lots and lots of tackling.Tackling requires full commitment and perfect timing. Go in half-heartedly and you'll get hurt; make the hit early or late and someone else will, and you'll be heading for an early shower.In a comedy there's no half-hour grace period in which the back four can elegantly stroke the ball around while scene is set and characters introduced: every man needs to be making good hard tackles from the first whistle. Those first critical collisions must all be on the money, or you'll find yourself 15-0 down with a man in the sin-bin before the first quarter's out.That said, even as you take your seat and flip through the matchday programme, you fear for A Haunted House. Even in its game plan it has the look of a pup about it: it features one, which meets a grisly end, in its opening sequences. Nor are early reports from the American broadsheets encouraging, though I hardly think they figured heavily when Marlon Wayans contemplated his target demographic. (Nor, should I think, did people like me, for that matter.) But it does seem to go over well-raked ground. A Haunted House is a horror-spoof - superficially like the Scary Movie franchise, thus begging the question why Marlon Wayans, with four of those exact movies in the tank and a fifth due to open imminently, isn't leaving the genre well alone.But look on the bright side: entering this sort of movie with low expectations is the best way to enjoy it. And so it proves.Early doors the tackle count is certainly high and with Malcolm (Wayans) and Kisha (Essence Atkins) charging around the park like the undead possessed, you brace yourself for each one. Wayans hits each ruck with vigour, and with each contact we feel a flash of relief that the tackle has passed without injury. Before long you've passed the ten minute mark, and with the odd mis-hit, the game plan seems to be working out pretty well.And so goes on. A ripple of laughter from one corner of the (hardly overstuffed) theatre grows into a general chuckle throughout. One chap on the left starts braying like a donkey. It is infectious. Soon enough we are all at it.There is nothing original in the screenplay - it is scatologocal, features fart jokes and lots of innuendo - so put most of this down to the actors' commitment and timing in the tackle. Wayans is a likeable, high octane presence and what his script lacks on lofty cerebral planes he makes up for in sheer effort: there are no half hearted shoulder charges here. Everyone commits full bloodedly, and you fancy one or two jokes which might have led to a turnover or even a yellow card in less enthusiastic hands (an extended one-man orgy with cuddly toys, for example) carry through on sheer bravura and timing alone.The screenplay is uneven, but the script is lively throughout, and there are droll comedy turns from David Koechner as a security expert, Nick Swardson as a gay psychic, Alanna Ubach and Andrew Daly as a couple of would-be swingers and Cedric the Entertainer as an ex-con turned exorcist. The whole thing looks like it was (and apparently was) shot on steadycams on a shoe string.I dare say the box office takings, already at something like fifteen times production costs before its UK release, will help Marlon Wayans come to terms with a sniffy review in the New York Times.Olly Buxton",3,Rugby on a wet day,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,3854,"['Indulge', 'metaphor', 'cinema', 'sport', 'then', 'most', 'genres', 'be', 'action', 'adventure', 'thriller', 'horror', 'romance', 'are', 'variety', 'beautiful', 'game', 'careful', 'build', 'back', 'fluid', 'off-the', 'ball', 'movement', 'odd', 'languorous', 'long', 'ball', 'space', 'snappy', 'interchanges', 'middle', 'park', 'clinical', 'execution', 'final', 'third.Comedy', 'spoofs', 'are', 'different', 'are', 'more', 'rugby', 'football', 'uncultured', 'Americans', 'wet', 'day', 'having', 'game', 'plan', 'following', 'tackling', 'Lots', 'lots', 'tackling.Tackling', 'full', 'commitment', 'perfect', 'timing', 'Go', 'half-heartedly', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hurt', 'make', 'hit', 'early', 'late', 'someone', 'else', 'will', ""'ll"", 'be', 'heading', 'early', 'shower.In', 'comedy', 'half-hour', 'grace', 'period', 'back', 'four', 'can', 'elegantly', 'stroke', 'ball', 'around', 'scene', 'set', 'characters', 'introduced', 'man', 'be', 'making', 'good', 'hard', 'tackles', 'first', 'whistle', 'first', 'critical', 'collisions', 'must', 'be', 'money', ""'ll"", 'find', '15-0', 'down', 'man', 'sin-bin', 'first', 'quarter', 'out.That', 'said', 'even', 'take', 'seat', 'flip', 'matchday', 'programme', 'fear', 'A', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Even', 'game', 'plan', 'look', 'pup', 'one', 'grisly', 'end', 'opening', 'sequences', 'are', 'early', 'reports', 'American', 'broadsheets', 'encouraging', 'hardly', 'think', 'figured', 'heavily', 'when', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'contemplated', 'target', 'demographic', 'should', 'think', 'did', 'people', 'matter', 'seem', 'go', 'well-raked', 'ground', 'A', 'Haunted', 'House', 'horror-spoof', 'superficially', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'thus', 'begging', 'question', 'why', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'four', 'exact', 'movies', 'tank', 'fifth', 'due', 'open', 'imminently', ""n't"", 'leaving', 'genre', 'well', 'alone.But', 'look', 'bright', 'side', 'entering', 'sort', 'movie', 'low', 'expectations', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'proves.Early', 'doors', 'tackle', 'count', 'certainly', 'high', 'Malcolm', 'Wayans', 'Kisha', 'Essence', 'Atkins', 'charging', 'park', 'undead', 'possessed', 'brace', 'one', 'Wayans', 'ruck', 'vigour', 'contact', 'feel', 'flash', 'relief', 'tackle', 'passed', 'injury', 'long', ""'ve"", 'passed', 'ten', 'minute', 'mark', 'odd', 'mis-hit', 'game', 'plan', 'be', 'working', 'out', 'pretty', 'so', 'ripple', 'laughter', 'one', 'corner', 'hardly', 'overstuffed', 'theatre', 'general', 'chuckle', 'One', 'chap', 'left', 'braying', 'donkey', 'infectious', 'Soon', 'are', 'nothing', 'original', 'screenplay', 'scatologocal', 'features', 'fart', 'jokes', 'lots', 'innuendo', 'so', 'put', 'most', 'down', 'actors', 'commitment', 'timing', 'tackle', 'Wayans', 'likeable', 'high', 'octane', 'presence', 'what', 'script', 'lofty', 'cerebral', 'planes', 'up', 'sheer', 'effort', 'are', 'half', 'hearted', 'shoulder', 'charges', 'here', 'Everyone', 'full', 'bloodedly', 'fancy', 'one', 'two', 'jokes', 'might', 'have', 'led', 'turnover', 'even', 'yellow', 'card', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'hands', 'extended', 'one-man', 'orgy', 'cuddly', 'toys', 'example', 'carry', 'sheer', 'bravura', 'timing', 'alone.The', 'screenplay', 'uneven', 'script', 'lively', 'are', 'droll', 'comedy', 'turns', 'David', 'Koechner', 'security', 'expert', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'gay', 'psychic', 'Alanna', 'Ubach', 'Andrew', 'Daly', 'couple', 'would-be', 'swingers', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'ex-con', 'turned', 'exorcist', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'apparently', 'was', 'shot', 'steadycams', 'shoe', 'string.I', 'dare', 'say', 'box', 'office', 'takings', 'already', 'something', 'fifteen', 'times', 'production', 'costs', 'UK', 'release', 'will', 'help', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'come', 'terms', 'sniffy', 'review', 'New', 'York', 'Times.Olly', 'Buxton']",A Haunted House

And though Wayans and Forte are lively and appealing as the haunted couple, even they can't sustain the movie much past its one-joke premise.",2,drives its subject matter into the ground,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,836,"['Haunted', 'House', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'movie', 'parody', 'knockoffs', 'have', 'been', 'rage', 'Airplane', 'lifted', 'runway', 'thirty-three', 'long', 'years', 'ago', 'outing', 'specific', 'aim', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movies', 'sideswipes', 'Poltergeist', 'Exorcist', 'way.Marlon', 'Wayans', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Rick', 'Alvarez', 'hyperkinetic', 'camera-obsessed', 'young', 'man', 'suburban', 'home', 'host', 'ghost', 'when', 'sweet', 'sassy', 'girlfriend', 'Marlene', 'Forte', 'in.The', 'movie', 'hit', 'amusing', 'concepts', 'time', 'time', 'unfortunate', 'tendency', 'belabor', 'point', 'where', ""'re"", 'really', 'very', 'funny', 'anymore', 'Wayans', 'Forte', 'are', 'lively', 'appealing', 'haunted', 'couple', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'movie', 'much', 'one-joke', 'premise']",A Haunted House

Too much yelling it reminded me of a bad Everybody Loves Raymond episode where all they do is yell at each other all day and all night.  No thank you Wayans.  You're going to laugh at the beginning but soon after the laughs stop because it's just a stupid movie.  I was hoping for a good fun flick like the Scream series remakes these guys made in the past.  Not to be found here.  Folks- if you have RedBox or Netflix- wait until it's available there for much less.  You will thank me.

1618924,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00AZMFINM,Terry Mesnard,"[0, 0]","It's impossible to discuss A Haunted House without acknowledging the Scary Movie franchise because not only did Marlon Wayans co-create Scary Movie, but the latest in that franchise just came out recently and parodies some of the same films.  Before Scary Movie was neutered and smashed into the ground into some ridiculous teen parody film, it actually was pretty entertaining.  The first film, in particular, was actually a decent parody and pretty strictly followed the original Scream's story with dialogue taken directly from the script and, most of the time, warped into comedic sensibilities.  While it catered to the lowest common denominator and was filled to the brim with juvenile humor, it also showcased a team that had comedic timing and knew the rules of the genre it was aping (slasher).  It also wasn't just unfunny vignettes with no real over-arching plot tying it together.So now we have A Haunted House, with Marlon Wayans back in the writing and starring role.  And while it's a step up from what's become of the Scary Movie franchise, it still not as good as the movie that started it all.  A lot of the jokes feel ""been there, done that...only better before.""  The only reason the movie succeeds at all is based on the comedic timing and chemistry between Marlon Wayans and Essence Atkins.  When A Haunted House begins, Malcolm Johnson (Wayans) is expecting his girlfriend Kisha (Atkins) to move in and he, as is required of a found footage film, wants to film everything.  The opening is actually quite smile-inducing because Wayans plays on the found footage genre and throws in a couple funny homages (e.g., quick-panning to the house keeper to startle the viewers, girl arriving and accidentally killing the dog, etc.).  The dialogue is quick, often-times funny, if not laugh-out-loud, and surprisingly subtle.  When a knife is found on the floor and Kisha goes crazy, saying that the house is haunted, I couldn't help but smile because of how quickly they were willing to jump to the paranormal.  The first half is funny and follows Paranormal Activity pretty well.Then things start to go downhill, as they introduce the go-to-actors to play their stereotypical parts.  Here we have Nick Swardson playing Chip the Psychic, bringing up gay jokes and making Malcolm uncomfortable.  Racism gets addressed as David Koechner shows up, playing the role he always does as the racist Security Man.  Here, the humor relies on very similar (if not the same) jokes Marlon Wayans has mined in the first two Scary Movies (there's even a ghostly sex session...scratch that, two ghostly sex sessions...that is nowhere near as chuckle-inducing as it was with Tori Spelling).  As the movie continued, it felt like it was dragging much longer than the short 86ish minute running time.The only thing that kept me going was the comedic timing of Essence Atkins specifically and the chemistry between her and Wayans.  They manage to elevate, however small, the score.  I was kind of hoping a return to the original Scary Movie and, to some degree, I got just that.  Just not in a good way.",3,"Everything you can do, the original Scary Movie can do better",1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,3096,"['impossible', 'discuss', 'A', 'Haunted', 'House', 'acknowledging', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'co-create', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'latest', 'franchise', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'recently', 'same', 'films', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'was', 'neutered', 'smashed', 'ground', 'ridiculous', 'teen', 'parody', 'film', 'actually', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'first', 'film', 'particular', 'was', 'actually', 'decent', 'parody', 'pretty', 'strictly', 'followed', 'original', 'Scream', 'story', 'dialogue', 'taken', 'directly', 'script', 'most', 'time', 'warped', 'comedic', 'sensibilities', 'catered', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'was', 'filled', 'brim', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'also', 'showcased', 'team', 'had', 'comedic', 'timing', 'knew', 'rules', 'genre', 'was', 'aping', 'slasher', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'unfunny', 'vignettes', 'real', 'over-arching', 'plot', 'tying', 'together.So', 'now', 'have', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'back', 'writing', 'starring', 'role', 'step', 'up', 'what', 'become', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'started', 'lot', 'jokes', 'feel', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'only', 'better', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'based', 'comedic', 'timing', 'chemistry', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'Essence', 'Atkins', 'When', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Malcolm', 'Johnson', 'Wayans', 'expecting', 'girlfriend', 'Kisha', 'Atkins', 'move', 'required', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'film', 'everything', 'opening', 'actually', 'quite', 'smile-inducing', 'Wayans', 'plays', 'found', 'footage', 'genre', 'couple', 'funny', 'homages', 'e.g.', 'quick-panning', 'house', 'keeper', 'startle', 'viewers', 'girl', 'arriving', 'accidentally', 'killing', 'dog', 'etc.', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'often-times', 'funny', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'surprisingly', 'subtle', 'When', 'knife', 'found', 'floor', 'Kisha', 'crazy', 'saying', 'house', 'haunted', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'how', 'quickly', 'were', 'willing', 'jump', 'paranormal', 'first', 'half', 'funny', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'pretty', 'well.Then', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'downhill', 'introduce', 'go-to-actors', 'play', 'stereotypical', 'parts', 'Here', 'have', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'playing', 'Chip', 'Psychic', 'bringing', 'up', 'gay', 'jokes', 'making', 'Malcolm', 'uncomfortable', 'Racism', 'addressed', 'David', 'Koechner', 'up', 'playing', 'role', 'always', 'racist', 'Security', 'Man', 'Here', 'humor', 'relies', 'very', 'similar', 'not', 'same', 'jokes', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'mined', 'first', 'two', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'even', 'ghostly', 'sex', 'session', 'scratch', 'two', 'ghostly', 'sex', 'sessions', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'chuckle-inducing', 'was', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'movie', 'continued', 'felt', 'was', 'dragging', 'much', 'longer', 'short', '86ish', 'minute', 'running', 'time.The', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'going', 'was', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Essence', 'Atkins', 'specifically', 'chemistry', 'Wayans', 'manage', 'elevate', 'however', 'small', 'score', 'was', 'kind', 'hoping', 'return', 'original', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'degree', 'got', 'just', 'Just', 'not', 'good', 'way']",A Haunted House

In comparison to other Wayans' films, like Scary Movie 1 and 2, this one definitely isn't as good as those films. But if you're looking for over-the -top, crude, and raunchy humor, then this one is for you. And personally, I don't mind that type of humor, but I just felt this one was trying a bit too hard and some of the jokes just weren't that funny. But I'm definitely not going to overly critique a film like this. You have to take a film like this for what it is, and its sole purpose is really just to make you laugh. And if this is your humor of choice, I suppose you won't be disappointed.",2,"2.5 Stars: Too much siliness, not enough laughs",1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1059,"['not', 'lot', 'say', 'film', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'comedy', 'style', 'Wayans', 'Brothers', 'case', 'only', 'Marlon', 'was', 'involved', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'simply', 'goofy', 'raunchy', 'parody', 'few', 'more', 'popular', 'paranormal', 'films', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'one', 'not', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'were', 'few', 'laughs', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'silly', 'be', 'funny', 'comparison', 'other', 'Wayans', 'films', 'Scary', 'Movie', '1', '2', 'one', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'films', ""'re"", 'looking', 'over-the', '-top', 'crude', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'then', 'one', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'type', 'humor', 'just', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'jokes', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'not', 'going', 'overly', 'critique', 'film', 'have', 'take', 'film', 'what', 'sole', 'purpose', 'really', 'just', 'make', 'laugh', 'humor', 'choice', 'suppose', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",A Haunted House
1618929,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00AZMFINM,Thomas M. Sipos,"[7, 9]","This is NOT a clever satire of horror films, but rather, a very low-brow comedy abounding in jokes about sex, race, drugs, and defecation.When Malcolm's girlfriend, Kisha, moves into his house, the hauntings start.It's important to know that Malcolm and Kisha are black, because so many jokes concern race. For instance, they're friends with a white couple who are into wife-swapping and aMandingofetish. However, though the white wife wants to be gang-raped by black men (and eventually realizes this fantasy, to her grinning husband's pleasure) she also comes onto Kisha.Yes, there are many gay jokes. A gay psychic, called to communicate with the haunting spirit, instead keeps coming onto Malcolm. This allows for such ""hilarious"" jokes as...Room goes dark. Everyone screams in fear. Lights come back up.Malcolm: ""Why are you holding my balls?""Gay Psychic: ""I'm protecting it from spirits.""Later, while a priest is trying to exorcise a demon from Kisha, the gay psychic keeps slapping Malcolm's chest (i.e., copping a feel), screaming, ""Begone, spirits, begone!""Malcolm: ""Why are you hitting me? I'm not the one possessed.""Later, the psychic convinces Malcolm to dress up in leather bondage gear to exorcise the demon.At one point the ghost (or demon?) butt-rapes Malcolm. It yanks off Malcolm's pajama bottom (the ghost is invisible), then rapes Malcolm in his rear-end.In another scene, Malcolm simulates sex with two of his stuffed animals, in a variety of positions.The priest is black. (He's played by Cedric the Entertainer.) Important to know, as he's such a stereotype. He has an extremely foul mouth, and keeps calling the possessed Kisha a ""b*tch."" He complains about how ""skank"" Kisha is (possessed people tend to stink), and tries to convince Malcolm to forget about her. ""There plenty more b*tches out there,"" says the priest.This black priest had recently left prison. He brags about all the people he ""shanked,"" (i.e., stabbed), and asks Malcolm if, instead of exorcising Kisha, he wouldn't just rather have him ""skank the b*itch.""Although in one scene, after the priest calls Kisha a ""b*tch,"" he says to Malcolm, ""Excuse me. That was insensitive. I mean ho.""Naturally, the priest has marijuana hidden in his Bible. (Ha, ha, a priest with a hollowed-out Bible -- now there's an original joke!).Yes, in addition to jokes about race and sex, A HAUNTED HOUSE has plenty of drug jokes.And many defecation jokes. Such as when Kisha sleeps beside Malcolm on her first night after moving in. Malcolm is surprised to learn that Kisha farts all night long. HUGE farts that cause the blankets to rise.A HAUNTED HOUSE is done as a found footage film, so Malcolm often follows Kisha around with his video camera. Including into the bathroom so he can record her on the toilet. (Ha ha! See Kisha on a toilet!)At one point, Malcolm comes home drunk. He trips around the living room, spilling an urn -- which contains the ashes to Kisha's father. So then Malcolm pulls down his pants, crouches, and defecates onto the ashes.A HAUNTED HOUSE also boasts a Latina maid (allowing for sex and drug jokes about Mexicans) and a racist video installer, who asks permission to use the N-word in exchange for letting Malcolm call him a ""cracker.""A guess this film is supposed to be ""politically incorrect,"" but I was never offended. The jokes are tired and obvious, very broadly drawn, very low-brow.

Thankfully, this film sticks much to the Wayans' sense of the quirky, crazy, crude, grotesque, and foul in a way where much of the most offensive content on screen revolts at times but still make people laugh at the hilarity of it all.In a spoof of ridiculously trendy ""found-footage"" horror films and paranormal films like Paranormal Activity, The Exorcist, and The Amityville Horror, Marlon Wayans plays Malcolm and his girlfriend Kisha played by Essence Atkins both live in a large house in California only to find out that a weird, sexually perverted ghost or demonic spirit surrounds their every existence.The film does not take its subject matter very seriously and often detours toward showcasing rather crude, off-the-wall situations involving fart jokes, aberrational sex acts done by the ghost and a possessed Kisha, interracial flirting cues, and a previously incarcerated reverend who cares much more about quoting Pulp Fiction than performing exorcisms. The humour is always there because the film, much like how I view ghosts and the supernatural, is just one big joke to scare away people or make people believe in superstitious things. Also, the over-the-top trend in these recent horror films and its unnecessary popularity proves for its occasional greatness here in this spoof.Nothing is spectacular here and nothing in here that upper-crust film critics will love, A Haunted House is and will only be the best and scariest horror and/or comedy involving horny ghosts and the supernatural since The Evil Dead did it when it satirised the slasher horror genre. A good but not very refined film for a boys' night out with beer, tortilla chips, and a day with no football games on TV!""",2,"What was Marlon thinking?
