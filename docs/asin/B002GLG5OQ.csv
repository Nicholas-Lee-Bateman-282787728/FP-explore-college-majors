I promptly ordered it and sent my taped off tv copy straight to hell!!!! If a VHS considers the garbage can hell. Based on a true story of two brothers caught up in a murder investigation involving their parents and younger brother. I won't go into detail and spoil it for you but I will say it isn't Kimberly as I don't think anyone that oblivious could do such a thing.

1267616,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B002GLG5OQ,Jeffery Mingo,"[2, 6]","This film would be good for people interested in the complex interaction between brothers.  ""Jason's Lyric"" and ""Boyz N Da Hood"" touched upon the same issue.  Here, three family members are killed and more and more the older surviving brother begins to suspect the younger.  But wives, girlfriends, nieces and nephews, sheriffs, and aunts all play into the mix.  Have you ever had a relative who did soemthing unethical, but then they'll respond to your accusation with, ""How can you accuse your dear, sweet relative of doing that!?""  This film touches upon that.  The film says it's based on a true story.  However, ever since learning that ""Fargo"" wasn't true, I don't give much credit to the ""true story"" bit.  You may want to see this film just to see J. Corbett's booty.  It doesn't come until near the very ends, but he does have some globes of which to be proud, assuming he didn't use a body double.Actually, the more I type, the more I think I liked this film.  However, it is a bit dull.  It's not a true whodunit where you'd be surprised with the conclusion.  The disc doesn't have foreign language subtitles or extra features.  You can tell the film was done on a limited budget.  I mean, it's not awful, it's okay; it's just not ""The Color Purple"" or ""Joy Luck Club"" or something.",3,Brother to Brother,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,1293,"['film', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'people', 'interested', 'complex', 'interaction', 'brothers', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Da', 'Hood', 'touched', 'same', 'issue', 'Here', 'three', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'killed', 'more', 'more', 'older', 'surviving', 'brother', 'suspect', 'younger', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'sheriffs', 'aunts', 'play', 'mix', 'Have', 'ever', 'had', 'relative', 'who', 'did', 'soemthing', 'unethical', 'then', ""'ll"", 'respond', 'accusation', 'How', 'can', 'accuse', 'dear', 'sweet', 'relative', 'doing', 'film', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'However', 'ever', 'learning', 'Fargo', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'credit', 'true', 'story', 'bit', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'just', 'see', 'J.', 'Corbett', 'booty', ""n't"", 'come', 'very', 'have', 'globes', 'be', 'proud', 'assuming', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'body', 'double.Actually', 'more', 'type', 'more', 'think', 'liked', 'film', 'However', 'bit', 'dull', 'not', 'true', 'whodunit', 'where', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'conclusion', 'disc', ""n't"", 'have', 'foreign', 'language', 'subtitles', 'extra', 'features', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'limited', 'budget', 'mean', 'not', 'awful', 'just', 'not', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'something']",The Morrison Murders

The actors that portrayed the brothers, one innocent, the other guilty, were so good in their respective roles, it sent chills up & down my spine watching the murderous brother act so casual after the horrific murders of his OWN Mom, Dad, and younger brother. John Corbett-since ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is one of my faves, the seemingly unknown, but equally talented actor who played his  brother(Jonathan Scarfe) was as handsome as he was strange in this role. The sets were very well done. Scenery was terrific, and the director never missed his mark.

It was your pretty standard made for TV movie, with one exception, the cast. Usually these things are pretty poorly written, predictable, and a little slow. This movie was far from slow, however a lot of the lines were cheesy and I figured out who did it within the first ten minutes. Sex & The City's John Corbett was very solid as was NYPD Blue's Gordon Clapp. It's nice to see people we associate with one character, stand out and be something completely different in another role.
