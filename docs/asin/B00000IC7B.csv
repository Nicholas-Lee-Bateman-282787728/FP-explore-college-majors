Not for the easily offended, but it's admirably unique and far better balanced than  Welcome to the Dollhouse, Solondz's first film. This film succeeds in  peeling back the candy-coated &quot;surface reality&quot; of middle-class  life, (and spares none of the candy-coating in its depiction, making use of  gaudy, colorful sets and juxtaposing cheesy sentimental music on strange  and sometimes disturbing scenes) -- and displaying the rot beneath. At the  same time it is a sympathetic film (though not exceedingly so), for all of  the characters in the movie, no matter how despicable their actions seem,  are above and beyond all, just human beings like anyone else. Not for  everyone, unfortunately, but I thought it was a fine film.",5,.,939686400,"10 12, 1999",1999,874,"['incredible', 'engrossing', 'movie', 'home', 'what', 'are', 'unquestionably', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'history', 'cinema', 'Not', 'easily', 'offended', 'admirably', 'unique', 'far', 'better', 'balanced', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'Solondz', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'peeling', 'back', 'candy-coated', 'quot', 'surface', 'reality', 'quot', 'middle-class', 'life', 'none', 'candy-coating', 'depiction', 'making', 'use', 'gaudy', 'colorful', 'sets', 'juxtaposing', 'cheesy', 'sentimental', 'music', 'strange', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'displaying', 'rot', 'beneath', 'same', 'time', 'sympathetic', 'film', 'not', 'exceedingly', 'so', 'characters', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'despicable', 'actions', 'seem', 'are', 'just', 'human', 'beings', 'anyone', 'else', 'Not', 'everyone', 'unfortunately', 'thought', 'was', 'fine', 'film']",N/A

Happiness is more mild and I had an impression that Mr.Solondz outlook is that of a weak person. Of course there is a lot of garbage in the human life and human nature but it  takes a strong person to live through it and make it better instead of  concenttrating on this with a sick pleasure. I do not agree that art is  necessarily dark and hopeless and to create art film you have to &quot;tell  the truth&quot;. Yes, people do go through the bad times in  their lifes - it's a common knowledge. But what is the point of throwing it  back to their faces? To show that you are sophisticated and  familiar with  the disgusting aspects of life? I think that the main function of Happiness  is to demonstrate the one extreme of the American life. On the other side  is the happy idiocy of the You've Got Mail characters. I think no real life  person can feel affinity with the inhabitants of either movie. Of course I  am not serious but I'd like to see the double feature DVD -  Happiness/You've Got Mail.

The film is filled with cynicism, dark humor, loneliness, anger, frustration, and helplessness. It mercilessly destroy all things middle-class American. The acting is superb.

But ive seen movies that were way more disturbing than this one so like i said it's not bad only subject matter.Anyone under 18 i guess shouldnt see this- though it really depends on how mature you are if you are open minded on discussing and watching controversial subjects and getting into peoples heads.Id say i wouldve still enjoyed this and not been offended even at 17.I'm 21 now.But all kids arnt the same so yes not for under 18 but all over 18 this is a good movie, i recomend it.",5,UNIQUE/ORIGINAL MOVIE,1052870400,"05 14, 2003",2003,1786,"['Happiness', 'basically', 'story', 'people', 'ar', ""n't"", 'always', 'appear', 'more', 'going', 'scenes', 'think', 'people', 'private', 'lives', 'emotions', 'feel', 'reveals', 'thier', 'lives.It', 'story', 'family', 'people', 'just', 'puts', 'out', 'there.At', 'times', 'funny', 'strange', 'wierd', 'reason', 'i', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'very', 'unique', 'diffrent', 'film.Ive', 'never', 'seen', 'film', '5', 'creativity', 'openness', 'subject', 'matter', 'actors', 'were', 'amazing', 'perfect', 'actors', 'charachters', 'movie.I', 'didnt', 'find', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'people', 'reviews', 'here', 'said-', 'was', 'nudity', 'not', 'much', 'violence', 'can', 'see', '.But', 'i', 'guess', 'got', 'nc', '17', 'rating', 'subject', 'matter', 'pedophilia', 'other', 'issues', 'discuss.There', 'was', 'one', 'part', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'lil', 'sick', 'end', 'other', 'movie', 'fine', 'are', 'ok', 'witnessing', 'people', 'talking', 'major', 'issues', 'thier', 'lives.This', 'first', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'movie', 'ive', 'seen', 'i', 'think', 'i', 'just', 'might', 'try', 'other', 'movies', 'i', 'liked', 'one.This', 'movie', 'deals', 'diffrent', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'diffrent', 'problems', 'very', 'strange', 'brilliant', 'same', 'time', 'ive', 'seen', 'movies', 'were', 'way', 'more', 'disturbing', 'one', 'i', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'only', 'subject', 'matter.Anyone', '18', 'i', 'guess', 'shouldnt', 'see', 'this-', 'really', 'how', 'mature', 'are', 'are', 'open', 'minded', 'discussing', 'watching', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'getting', 'peoples', 'heads.Id', 'say', 'i', 'wouldve', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'been', 'offended', 'even', '17.I', ""'m"", '21', 'kids', 'arnt', 'same', 'so', 'yes', 'not', '18', 'over', '18', 'good', 'movie', 'i', 'recomend']",N/A
502827,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000IC7B,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I&#8217;ll just start by saying that &#8216;Happiness&#8217; is completely messed up.I honestly don&#8217;t know what else to say.  This kind of reminds me of what Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s &#8216;Magnolia&#8217; would have been like had it not been so entirely self-indulgent, and then again I wonder if some of that self-indulgence is what made &#8216;Magnolia&#8217; so memorable.  While &#8216;Happiness&#8217; is similar in tones and some themes, the film has an air of nonchalance that &#8216;Magnolia&#8217; never had.  &#8216;Magnolia&#8217; took itself VERY seriously, whereas &#8216;Happiness&#8217; is far more laid back and tries to come from a more humorous angle, even when dealing with situations that are far from funny.The main themes here have to do with sexual perversions, pedophilia, loneliness, masturbation and physiological abuse.This is a tapestry film, much like &#8216;Magnolia&#8217; was, and covers the lives of seemingly normal people who are all hiding something that makes them less than happy.  Joy Jordan, a lonely woman with no real life to hold onto, opens the film by breaking Andy Kornbluth&#8217;s heart, and then suffers the consequence for the remainder of the film when he commits suicide.  Her sisters are both just as messed up, but in less obvious ways.  Helen is popular and famous and yet suffers serious insecurities and self-doubt that she keeps hidden from the world.  She is also being, sort of, stalked by Allen, her boorish neighbor with some sick fantasies.  Trish is the sister who seems to have it all together.  Her husband Bill is a successful therapist (who also sees Allen) and she has a nice house and two healthy boys, but her eldest son Billy is having some puberty problems and Bill is harboring a really dark secret that comes out and destroys Trish&#8217;s world (and the world of quite a few other people).But it&#8217;s not like these three women had great role models, as their parents are separating and causing quite a ripple in the family.There is a very light air about the film, which I think in the end lessens the impact.  This can be seen as a plus (for it never feels indulgent) and yet also a detriment (because this material should affect us more), but the film should be praised for attempting to cover such serious ground without feeling stereotypical or preachy.  The ensemble is also to be commended, for they really went all out here.  The late (I hate saying this) Philip Seymour Hoffman buries into the soul of this man with such force, and he leaves a sad note in our hearts.  But really, this is all about Dylan Baker, who had such a  rough task at hand.  This man is repulsive and yet he had to play both sides, creating a monster but giving him a soul and playing up his rouse.  He does it brilliantly.If you are a fan of &#8216;Magnolia&#8217;, I recommend seeing this one for they would make a great double feature.",4,"Sick, twisted and uncomfortable&#8230;",1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2911,"['8217', 'just', 'start', 'saying', '8216', 'Happiness', '8217', 'completely', 'messed', 'up.I', 'honestly', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'kind', 'reminds', 'what', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', '8217', '8216', 'Magnolia', '8217', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'entirely', 'self-indulgent', 'then', 'again', 'wonder', 'self-indulgence', 'what', 'made', '8216', 'Magnolia', '8217', 'memorable', '8216', 'Happiness', '8217', 'similar', 'tones', 'themes', 'film', 'air', 'nonchalance', '8216', 'Magnolia', '8217', 'never', 'had', '8216', 'Magnolia', '8217', 'took', 'VERY', 'seriously', '8216', 'Happiness', '8217', 'far', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'tries', 'come', 'more', 'humorous', 'angle', 'even', 'when', 'dealing', 'situations', 'are', 'far', 'funny.The', 'main', 'themes', 'here', 'have', 'do', 'sexual', 'perversions', 'pedophilia', 'loneliness', 'masturbation', 'physiological', 'abuse.This', 'tapestry', 'film', 'much', '8216', 'Magnolia', '8217', 'was', 'lives', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'hiding', 'something', 'less', 'happy', 'Joy', 'Jordan', 'lonely', 'woman', 'real', 'life', 'hold', 'film', 'breaking', 'Andy', 'Kornbluth', '8217', 's', 'heart', 'then', 'consequence', 'remainder', 'film', 'when', 'suicide', 'sisters', 'are', 'just', 'messed', 'up', 'less', 'obvious', 'ways', 'Helen', 'popular', 'famous', 'yet', 'suffers', 'serious', 'insecurities', 'self-doubt', 'hidden', 'world', 'also', 'being', 'sort', 'stalked', 'Allen', 'boorish', 'neighbor', 'sick', 'fantasies', 'Trish', 'sister', 'who', 'have', 'together', 'husband', 'Bill', 'successful', 'therapist', 'who', 'also', 'Allen', 'nice', 'house', 'two', 'healthy', 'boys', 'eldest', 'son', 'Billy', 'having', 'puberty', 'problems', 'Bill', 'harboring', 'really', 'dark', 'secret', 'out', 'destroys', 'Trish', '8217', 's', 'world', 'world', 'few', 'other', 'people', '.But', '8217', 'not', 'three', 'women', 'had', 'great', 'role', 'models', 'parents', 'are', 'separating', 'causing', 'quite', 'ripple', 'family.There', 'very', 'light', 'air', 'film', 'think', 'end', 'impact', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'plus', 'never', 'indulgent', 'yet', 'also', 'detriment', 'material', 'should', 'affect', 'more', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'attempting', 'cover', 'such', 'serious', 'ground', 'feeling', 'stereotypical', 'preachy', 'ensemble', 'also', 'be', 'commended', 'really', 'went', 'here', 'late', 'hate', 'saying', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'soul', 'man', 'such', 'force', 'sad', 'note', 'hearts', 'really', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'who', 'had', 'rough', 'task', 'hand', 'man', 'repulsive', 'yet', 'had', 'play', 'sides', 'creating', 'monster', 'giving', 'soul', 'playing', 'up', 'rouse', 'brilliantly.If', 'are', 'fan', '8216', 'Magnolia', '8217', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'double', 'feature']",N/A

But what is remarkable about Solondz's writing and direction is that even the most reprehensible characters are painted with warm tones of humanity.  A compulsive pedophile is also a loving father.  An aggressive obscene phone caller is just a frail man who wants to be loved, but doesn't know how to reach out to others.

502833,A1HUBEP5DJ6W51,B00000IC7B,Brooke276,"[8, 11]","Taking risks that most filmmakers would never dream of, Todd Solondz has mangaged a rare feat in American film -- pushing the envelope of good taste without resorting to sophomoric shock humor while simultaneously creating  realistic, complex characters. The film will no doubt offend many, but  unlike the overwrought preachiness of many in Hollywood, Solondz respects  the intelligence of the audience to come to their own conclusions. Because  Americans tend to lean in the direction of self-righteousness and moral  absolutism, we are left aghast when we witness a film that refrains from  judgment. In addition, Solondz has created a film of unprecedented power  and black humor, where loneliness and desperation are treated with the  proper level of seriousness that so many films avoid. To be sure, there are  big laughs in this film, but they come from our collective recognition  rather than the belief that we are superior to the people on the screen.  Every scene works perfectly; every performance contains the precise mixture  of dignity and absurdity; and all is presented with the understanding that  easy answers and forced closure are not parts of life, therefore they  should remain absent from film. As a viewer, ask yourself one question:  Given that all human beings are united in the desire to love, be loved, and  express affection for another, what are those not &quot;blessed&quot; with  socially acceptable traits (wealth, beauty, strength, even sanity) supposed  to do? How do they capture that essential part of life?

An attention-getting, semaphore-waving, ""hey looky here how cutting edge, mod, hip, shoot from the hip, auteur I can be!"" On the other hand, it's a pretty darned well directed movie, with many carefully-crafted, dramatic and dark comic vignettes, that don't quite add up to a great sum total.Without going into the lurid details of what makes this movie so controversial (read any other review to get the idea), Solondz' main strength would appear to be his allowing his excellent ensemble cast the latitude to fully investigate their roles. Even Jon Lovitz, not exactly what one would usually think of when the word ""method acting"" comes up, delivers a delightfully unrestrained, semi-monologue at the beginning of the film that serves as the keynote address in the convention of the mad that is to follow. Perfect delivery. Perfect timing. Nice payoff.Self-indulgent or not, the film will definitely hold your interest (even when you wish it wouldn't) and have you believing in the characters and the storyline.

While lunatics, perverts, the socially inept, the depressed, ugly, fat and others do in fact exist, to find them all in such close proximity to one another is of course farce. Excuses can be give for why this is, given that it is a film and this is the story the filmmakers choose to tell. Fine. I still hated it. None of the characters were compelling and I could not relate to barely any aspect of this film. Like that horrid overrated garbage CRASH, this film supposes the entire world is a certain way. I say no, no the world is not this way. This film reminds me more of CNN or other such news organizations where the news is always bleak when you watch. Aliens might imagine this to be an awful place if they used the news for a guide. hurricanes, floods, murders, rapes, and so on and so forth. Turns out my life is not like that, my friends and families lives are not like that and in my almost 40 years I have encountered very little of what i have seen on the news. This film is the same. Although people like this do exist, to find them all existing together on the screen in an intersecting mess is unbearable. I am not sure of even what this films aim was. While art itself does not need a reason of course, a film still should at least be watchable and enjoyable on some level, even if only to communicate other kinds of people that the film viewer may be unaware of. Usually there is someone in the film for the viewer to relate to, a character that arcs, a mildly satisfying ending, an attempt at making some aspect of the film worth the torture one may see. This had none of that. Since I love films and tend to watch films many times. I could no sit through this mess again. It was the most depressing and awkwardly compiled collection of societies fringe.

Gardner,"[19, 38]","&quot;Happiness&quot; is like an American Peter Greenaway film without stunning visual images, witty dialogue, intellectual game-playing indugences. What do get when you strip those signature items away from a Greenaway film? Pure misanthropy and contempt for the audience. After watching this film, I got the distinct feeling that writer/director Todd Solondz was taking revenge on us all for harms visited upon him in middle and high school. He wants us all to suffer so he can have the last laugh and possibly feel a little better about himself. Sure, we humans all have secrets that evoke shame. We can do stupid, shocking and repulsive things. We tell people we think we can trust. Some people can cope with them, some can't. But if you're going to make a movie about such things, you damn well better have something to say about it instead of just presenting tableaux of cruelty. So we're left here with an undoubtedly talented cast in service of a script that seems to be an exercise in moral relativism, but on closer inspection there's less there than meets the eye.What can I say about this piece of garbage? The characters depicted are pretty much unredeemable--because redemption simply is not possible in Solondz's little universe. In order to depict a world as bleak as this one (and for the characters' unhappy states to truly mean something) one needs to balance it with wit and, you know, the occasional happy person. Solondz does no such thing, of course; that would be to compromise with &quot;Them&quot;--the people in the real world for whom happiness or finding beauty in life is possible--the kind of people who will see through his films for the solipsistic messes they are. It's one thing to depict deeply sick characters in order to deepen our understanding of how terrible acts occur (see Martin Scorsese's &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; for example) or to illuminate transpersonal forces at work, and another thing altogether to show moral sickness simply for the sake of a contest of whose wounds are deeper, or some sophomoric existential statement. &quot;Happiness&quot; does nothing of the former, and is, bereft of that, a reprehensible film.",1,The Cinema of Revenge,1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,2168,"['quot', 'Happiness', 'quot', 'American', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'film', 'stunning', 'visual', 'images', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'intellectual', 'game-playing', 'indugences', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'strip', 'signature', 'items', 'away', 'Greenaway', 'film', 'Pure', 'misanthropy', 'contempt', 'audience', 'watching', 'film', 'got', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'writer/director', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'was', 'taking', 'revenge', 'harms', 'visited', 'middle', 'high', 'school', 'suffer', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'last', 'laugh', 'possibly', 'feel', 'little', 'better', 'Sure', 'humans', 'have', 'secrets', 'evoke', 'shame', 'can', 'do', 'stupid', 'shocking', 'repulsive', 'things', 'tell', 'people', 'think', 'can', 'trust', 'people', 'can', 'cope', 'ca', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'such', 'things', 'damn', 'well', 'better', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'instead', 'just', 'presenting', 'tableaux', 'cruelty', ""'re"", 'left', 'here', 'undoubtedly', 'talented', 'cast', 'service', 'script', 'be', 'exercise', 'moral', 'relativism', 'closer', 'inspection', 'less', 'there', 'meets', 'eye.What', 'can', 'say', 'piece', 'garbage', 'characters', 'depicted', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'unredeemable', 'redemption', 'simply', 'not', 'possible', 'Solondz', 'little', 'universe', 'order', 'depict', 'world', 'as', 'bleak', 'one', 'characters', 'unhappy', 'states', 'truly', 'mean', 'something', 'one', 'balance', 'wit', 'know', 'occasional', 'happy', 'person', 'Solondz', 'such', 'thing', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'compromise', 'quot', 'Them', 'quot', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'whom', 'happiness', 'finding', 'beauty', 'life', 'possible', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'see', 'films', 'solipsistic', 'messes', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'depict', 'deeply', 'sick', 'characters', 'order', 'deepen', 'understanding', 'how', 'terrible', 'acts', 'occur', 'see', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'quot', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'quot', 'example', 'illuminate', 'transpersonal', 'forces', 'work', 'thing', 'altogether', 'show', 'moral', 'sickness', 'simply', 'sake', 'contest', 'wounds', 'are', 'deeper', 'sophomoric', 'existential', 'statement', 'quot', 'Happiness', 'quot', 'nothing', 'former', 'bereft', 'reprehensible', 'film']",N/A

Todd Solondz, director of Happiness, sees the validity in both points of view.  For him, the world is an awfully funny place.  And in this bleak comic masterpiece, Solondz shows us how to find hope in the most despairing of circumstances, dignity in the face of shame, and compassion in the face of one's most monstrous acts.  In other words, Solondz shows us what humanity really is, and isn't that - at its basest level - what filmmaking is supposed to be?""Happiness"" is also the best movie that Robert Altman never made, in that it is a mosaic of the masses, interspersing a loose narrative thread through the disparate lives of many without seeming disjointed.  It essentially follows the lives and disfunctional loves of five characters through a myriad of morbid situations, some stemming from deterministic outside pressures, most a result of the characters' inner turbulence churning to the surface through misguided thought and deed.At the supposed center of the conflicts is a pedophilic psychiatrist (Dylan Baker) who preys on the peers of his adolescent son.  A monstrous act, indeed, but the camera's unflinching objectivity serves to neither condone or condemn the man, so we are left to see the struggle amidst the strife, the human within the monster.Other characters include an unlucky-in-everything hapless spinstress named Joy (ha ha) who allows the world to treat her like a welcome mat placed in front of a door to better things.  Her sanctimonious sister, Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), while seeming to have it all, secretly wallows in the emptiness of her hollow life.  Lara Flynn Boyle plays still another sadistic sibling, a famous writer who wishes that she were raped, so as to provide a more authentic muse.And though simple verbal descriptions of these characters make them sound ghastly, in thought and indeed, the magic of the film is the even-handed well-weighted treatment that they receive through Solondz' direction and the actors' depictions, letting the audience decide whether empathy is in order.  Too many people in our society have a need to characterize aberrant and abhorrent behavior as coming from an ""other"" - someone less than human and thus tangibly different from them.  The truth, of course, is that we are all people who - good or bad - are capable of some pretty disturbing things.  In Solondz' cinematic society, the sinners are just like you and me, whether that scares us or not.It should also be noted that amidst all this weighty discussion, philosophy and sociological insight are some of the funniest and most demented sight gags, stuff that gives the Farrelly brothers a literal run for their runny money in the Gross Out Olympics (acronym: G.O.O) - body fluid jokes that put the ""stick"" back into ""slapstick"".  Gags that make you wanna.And when the characters themselves instill the audience with laughter, Solondz' artistry and control leave us wondering whether we are laughting at them, with them, or in spite of them, when the truth is somewhere in between.

It deals with adult subject matter, for sure, but it manages to present the inherent, subtle humor of strange, bizzare, or grotesque  situations.  One scene that sticks out in my mind is when Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is in a diner with the character played by Camryn Manheim and she just finished telling him about her being assaulted and the particularly gruesome way she dealt with the assault, and he replied, ""Well, we all have our plusses and minuses.""  I laughed until my sides hurt.  You really have to see the scene and all it's nuances to fully appreciate it.  And there are a lot of scenes like this throughout the movie.  This is definately a squeamish and unsettling type of movie with some pretty difficult subject matter.  Given that, I wouldn't recommend this movie to just anyone.  Seek it out if you must, but be warned, it's not a happy story.  As far as one reviewers' statement that the scenes were presented for there shock value only, I didn't really see it that way.  I saw a peeling away of the appearance that is presented by people to show the sorid underbelly of life, like turning over a big rock to see what kind of creepy crawlies are hiding underneath.  That's not to say that the people in this movie are representative of people in general, but I think we all have little secrets about ourselves, our 'rocks', that we wouldn't want the rest of the world to know.  I can understand why some people would be turned off by a movie like this, as I think a lot of people go to see movies to escape from this kind of material.  Also, I think Dylan Baker did an excellent job in portraying his character.  He played a character who seemed to have the idyllic life, a beautiful wife, a large home in the suburbs, three children, and good career...and pedoephillic tendancies towards young boys.  He was so creepy, taking advantage of oppourtunities presented to him, regardless of the consequences.  I didn't feel sorry for his character, but I did feel like he was a creature trapped by his own demons, acting on his primal urges.  He was what he was, and that wasn't going to change.  I don't understand the urges he felt, but the characterization of the monster he became was certainly interesting to watch.  I enjoyed this movie, and I am looking forward to seeing 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'.Cookieman108",4,I'm living in a state of irony.,1054080000,"05 28, 2003",2003,2460,"['Having', 'seen', ""'Storytelling"", 'had', 'fairly', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'picked', 'movie', 'up', 'adult', 'subject', 'matter', 'sure', 'present', 'inherent', 'subtle', 'humor', 'strange', 'bizzare', 'grotesque', 'situations', 'One', 'scene', 'out', 'mind', 'when', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'diner', 'character', 'played', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'just', 'finished', 'telling', 'being', 'assaulted', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'way', 'assault', 'replied', 'Well', 'have', 'plusses', 'minuses', 'laughed', 'sides', 'hurt', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'scene', 'nuances', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'are', 'lot', 'scenes', 'movie', 'definately', 'squeamish', 'unsettling', 'type', 'movie', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'Given', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'just', 'anyone', 'Seek', 'out', 'must', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'happy', 'story', 'As', 'far', 'one', 'reviewers', 'statement', 'scenes', 'were', 'presented', 'shock', 'value', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'way', 'saw', 'peeling', 'away', 'appearance', 'presented', 'people', 'show', 'sorid', 'underbelly', 'life', 'turning', 'over', 'big', 'rock', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'creepy', 'crawlies', 'are', 'hiding', 'underneath', 'not', 'say', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'representative', 'people', 'general', 'think', 'have', 'little', 'secrets', ""'rocks"", 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'rest', 'world', 'know', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'go', 'see', 'movies', 'escape', 'kind', 'material', 'Also', 'think', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'played', 'character', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'idyllic', 'life', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'large', 'home', 'suburbs', 'three', 'children', 'good', 'career', 'pedoephillic', 'tendancies', 'young', 'boys', 'was', 'so', 'creepy', 'taking', 'advantage', 'oppourtunities', 'presented', 'regardless', 'consequences', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'character', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'creature', 'trapped', 'own', 'demons', 'acting', 'primal', 'urges', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'urges', 'felt', 'characterization', 'monster', 'became', 'was', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', ""Dollhouse'.Cookieman108""]",N/A

502847,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00000IC7B,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","This one will knock your socks off even if you aren't wearing any socks.  I dare you to watch it.  I double-dare you.But first a few words.  This is about sex.  Not your Cinderella meets Prince Charming sex.  Not your boy meets girls sex at all, or not exactly.  This is more like REAL sex, the kind you don't talk about.  This is about several varieties of sex, most of them perverted or deviant and/or illegal in most states.  And this is about ""happiness"" in only the most ironic sense of the word.Yet, somehow this movie seems...well, not uplifting, heaven forbid, but somehow reassuring in a strange way.  I guess what happens is that after all the perversions, the hang-ups, the unrequited desires, the bizarro fantasies, the unnatural desires, the depraved acts, the exploitation, the sheer desperation of the biological imperative, somehow with the family sitting around the dinner table at the end, somehow we are reassured that life not only goes on, but things could be worse.It is interesting that director Todd Solondz--who previously gave us the captivating and totally original Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995), a strikingly truthful look at the middle child in junior high school--spun this out the way he did.  The story is really about three sisters and their parents and the dysfunctional sex that they encounter and the pitiable/ normal lives they live. Solondz could have begun with having us meet the sisters one by one like some kind of chick flick with the expectation that we will find out about their lives and their loves.  Instead he starts from another angle, and only gradually does it develop that this really IS about their lives and loves.Well, their lives and loves are a bit beyond kinky or pathetic, and yet they are so very like the lives and loves so many people lead--if only we knew.  By the way, at times the film is belly laugh funny.Starring are Jane Adams (Joy), Lara Flynn Boyle (Helen), and Cynthia Stevenson (Trish) as the three sisters.  Joy is the wallflower at the dance of life, Helen is the hard as a stiletto woman of fashion, accomplishment and beauty who can't find the right man, and Trish is the desperate housewife ""happily"" married to a man who is a homosexual pedophile and a psychiatrist.  Dylan Baker plays the shrink who can't help himself in a way that makes it tough for the audience not to identify with his problem.  He is so honest with his son and so clearly loves his son and his wife that we are almost won over.  Almost.  We do NOT see him with the boys he exploits, and in this way perhaps Solondz has stacked the deck.  Still a movie that paints a pedophile in anything close to a positive light deserves credit for courage if nothing else.The other characters who are anything but sympathetic in an objective assessment--one is a murderer--somehow come across as being vulnerable instead of monstrous.  Perhaps Joy, who is so hopeful and so very, very vulnerable, is the one who most inspires our sympathy.  The Russian who frankly admits he's a thief and exploits Joy seems more despicable than anyone in the film.  Perhaps.  I think it really depends on your point of view, your sexuality and perhaps your individual experience.Ben Gazzara is the father who is just sick of his wife, and Louise Lasser (whom I haven't seen since she starred in the offbeat TV sit com ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" from the seventies) plays the wife.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a guy who is terrified of performing with women, but gets his jollies dialing strangers on the phone and talking dirty.  Camryn Manheim plays the large woman who wants intimacy but finds sex disgusting.I think you've got the picture.  This is sexual dysfunction as TV's Lifetime would never have it.  Solondz's intent seems to be to demonstrate the truth of the adage ""To know all is to forgive all.""  He also does a good job of showing that although we think we are the self that makes the decisions, maybe it is true that our biology overrides our intentions.This is decidedly not for the straightlaced or the intolerant.  This the sort of movie that is so terrifying to social conservatives that they won't even attack it for fear that such an attack would only give it greater currency.See this for Todd Solondz who is a film maker of verve and insight, a humanist who is not afraid to shock the bourgeoisie.",5,A most original film sure to bemuse and offend almost everybody,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,4350,"['one', 'will', 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'socks', 'dare', 'watch', 'double-dare', 'you.But', 'first', 'few', 'words', 'sex', 'Not', 'Cinderella', 'meets', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'sex', 'Not', 'boy', 'meets', 'girls', 'sex', 'not', 'exactly', 'more', 'REAL', 'sex', 'kind', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'several', 'varieties', 'sex', 'most', 'perverted', 'deviant', 'and/or', 'illegal', 'most', 'states', 'happiness', 'only', 'most', 'ironic', 'sense', 'word.Yet', 'somehow', 'movie', 'well', 'not', 'uplifting', 'heaven', 'forbid', 'somehow', 'reassuring', 'strange', 'way', 'guess', 'what', 'perversions', 'hang-ups', 'unrequited', 'desires', 'bizarro', 'fantasies', 'unnatural', 'desires', 'depraved', 'acts', 'exploitation', 'sheer', 'desperation', 'biological', 'imperative', 'somehow', 'family', 'sitting', 'dinner', 'table', 'end', 'somehow', 'are', 'reassured', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'worse.It', 'interesting', 'director', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'who', 'previously', 'gave', 'captivating', 'totally', 'original', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', '1995', 'strikingly', 'truthful', 'look', 'middle', 'child', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'spun', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'story', 'really', 'three', 'sisters', 'parents', 'dysfunctional', 'sex', 'encounter', 'pitiable/', 'normal', 'live', 'Solondz', 'could', 'have', 'begun', 'having', 'meet', 'sisters', 'one', 'one', 'kind', 'chick', 'flick', 'expectation', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'lives', 'loves', 'Instead', 'angle', 'only', 'gradually', 'develop', 'really', 'lives', 'loves.Well', 'lives', 'loves', 'are', 'bit', 'kinky', 'pathetic', 'yet', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'lives', 'loves', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'lead', 'only', 'knew', 'way', 'times', 'film', 'belly', 'laugh', 'funny.Starring', 'are', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'Joy', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Helen', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'Trish', 'three', 'sisters', 'Joy', 'wallflower', 'dance', 'life', 'Helen', 'hard', 'stiletto', 'woman', 'fashion', 'accomplishment', 'beauty', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'right', 'man', 'Trish', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'happily', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'homosexual', 'pedophile', 'psychiatrist', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'shrink', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'way', 'tough', 'audience', 'not', 'identify', 'problem', 'so', 'honest', 'son', 'so', 'clearly', 'son', 'wife', 'are', 'almost', 'won', 'over', 'Almost', 'do', 'NOT', 'see', 'boys', 'way', 'perhaps', 'Solondz', 'stacked', 'deck', 'Still', 'movie', 'pedophile', 'anything', 'close', 'positive', 'light', 'deserves', 'credit', 'courage', 'nothing', 'else.The', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'anything', 'sympathetic', 'objective', 'assessment', 'one', 'murderer', 'somehow', 'come', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'instead', 'monstrous', 'Perhaps', 'Joy', 'who', 'so', 'hopeful', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'inspires', 'sympathy', 'Russian', 'who', 'frankly', 'thief', 'Joy', 'more', 'despicable', 'anyone', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'think', 'really', 'point', 'view', 'sexuality', 'perhaps', 'individual', 'experience.Ben', 'Gazzara', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'sick', 'wife', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'whom', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'starred', 'offbeat', 'TV', 'sit', 'com', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'seventies', 'wife', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'guy', 'who', 'terrified', 'performing', 'women', 'jollies', 'dialing', 'strangers', 'phone', 'talking', 'dirty', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'large', 'woman', 'who', 'intimacy', 'sex', 'disgusting.I', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'picture', 'sexual', 'dysfunction', 'TV', 'Lifetime', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'Solondz', 'intent', 'be', 'demonstrate', 'truth', 'adage', 'know', 'forgive', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'think', 'are', 'self', 'decisions', 'maybe', 'true', 'biology', 'intentions.This', 'decidedly', 'not', 'straightlaced', 'intolerant', 'sort', 'movie', 'so', 'terrifying', 'social', 'conservatives', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'attack', 'fear', 'attack', 'would', 'only', 'give', 'greater', 'currency.See', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'who', 'film', 'maker', 'verve', 'insight', 'humanist', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'shock', 'bourgeoisie']",N/A

He always has such a great take on serious subject matter, for instance pedophilia and murder and suicide like in this flick. The opening scene is sooo hilarious, thanks to Jon Lovitz's performance. He has such a great line when he's telling Joy she's horrible, ""You're s***, I'm champagne."" And the whole family dynamic and how it's thrown up in hte air and turned upside down. The stereotypical nuclear family with a pedophile as a father, drugging his family to have his way with his son's friend. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is tremendous, he's the epitamy of pathetic. A charachter so boring even his therapist zones out on his session thinking of what he needs from the market. Being so frightend to talk to the beautiful woman next door, but calls her obsessivly.

In that same way, a movie like Happiness will always draw a fair amount of admiration from some, just for the fact that it touches (or, actually, dwells) on dysfunction and such taboo subjects as pederasty. In many peoples' minds, this alone will be enough to make Happiness ""daring"" or have some other merit. They will love it because it goes where other movies don't. And... there *is* something to be said for that, but just as the word 'penis' doesn't make the Holocaust actually funny, depicting pederasty doesn't make this a good movie.Happiness is a tedious film. It is tedious from its opening scene to its final credits. It uses its ""shocking"" subject matter, questionable characters and tawdry situations to distract us from the fact that it does not, at heart, have a whole lot to say. And, that's a shame, because if you're going to bother to do so much to draw people's notice, you might as well do something useful with it once acquired. Instead, the movie closes on roughly the same notes as that with which it opened -- the characters are no more enlightened at the end about their situations than are we.The casting is brilliant -- Philip Seymore Hoffman, Jon Lovitz, Cameryn Manheim along with a host of strong character actors -- but they don't get a chance to truly move the audience. Am I supposed to be rooting for Hoffman's character? Against it? Do I really have any reason to care about him, or any of the others that drift through the screenplay like flotsam?To sum this up, the movie Happiness is basically the equivalent of an ethical freak show. Some claim that there is educational value to be found in a carnival's side show -- just as some will claim that there is something of worth, here -- but really it's just there to provide a shock to the system.

502856,A2E6LOTVXW8X2P,B00000IC7B,E A Glaser,"[8, 10]","""Happiness"" is not a movie for everyone by any means. Personally I thought it was occasionally hilarious, brutally honest about the private lives of unhappy people, and frequently painful to watch. The director goes for maximum discomfort in many scenes which really make you squirm in your seat. If you consider yourself an optimist than this movie might seem stomach-turning and exaggerated and pointlessly misanthropic, and you might understandably despise it. I myself could definitely relate to the characters who are unable to escape the cycle of prolonged periods of self-loathing punctuated by moments of brief relief (although I have no desire to make obscene phone calls or prey on young boys).There are four loosely related storylines in ""Happiness"". The most memorable one looks at a suburban dad who harbors secret fantasies about prepubescent boys. The striking thing is that the man is presented sympathetically -- he is sick, he knows he's sick, but he has nowhere to turn for help. Even though his actions are repugnant, I still ended up feeling sorry for the man himself. I thought the treatment of the issue was effective and not too apologetic for the man's proclivities; child abusers are rightly reviled by society, but the movie reminds you that the taboo is so strong that there is no place for potential offenders to turn. The focus with sex criminals is punishing them after the fact, but are there any outlets where such people can privately seek help before they succumb to their urges? If there aren't, perhaps there should be.The other subplots follow a chronic masturbator, a down-on-her-luck woman who is mistreated throughout the movie in ways that straddle the knife-edge between cruelty and humor, and an older couple whose marraige is dissolving. Maybe it's just me, but I thought Ben Gazzara was scene-stealingly funny as the stoic retiree who just wants to be alone.Anyway, this is a worthwhile movie to see if you are not automatically turned off by the inner lives of desperate people. The uncomfortable scenes force you to think about happiness itself: what is it, who deserves it, and how do I go about getting it anyway?",4,Very uncomfortable and disturbingly accurate movie,1034121600,"10 9, 2002",2002,2163,"['Happiness', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'means', 'Personally', 'thought', 'was', 'occasionally', 'hilarious', 'brutally', 'honest', 'private', 'lives', 'unhappy', 'people', 'frequently', 'painful', 'watch', 'director', 'maximum', 'discomfort', 'many', 'scenes', 'really', 'make', 'squirm', 'seat', 'consider', 'optimist', 'movie', 'might', 'seem', 'stomach-turning', 'exaggerated', 'pointlessly', 'misanthropic', 'might', 'understandably', 'despise', 'could', 'definitely', 'relate', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'escape', 'cycle', 'prolonged', 'periods', 'self-loathing', 'punctuated', 'moments', 'brief', 'relief', 'have', 'desire', 'make', 'obscene', 'phone', 'prey', 'young', 'boys', 'are', 'four', 'loosely', 'related', 'storylines', 'Happiness', 'most', 'memorable', 'one', 'suburban', 'dad', 'who', 'secret', 'fantasies', 'prepubescent', 'boys', 'striking', 'thing', 'man', 'presented', 'sympathetically', 'sick', 'sick', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'help', 'Even', 'actions', 'are', 'repugnant', 'still', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'man', 'thought', 'treatment', 'issue', 'was', 'effective', 'not', 'too', 'apologetic', 'man', 'proclivities', 'child', 'abusers', 'are', 'rightly', 'reviled', 'society', 'movie', 'taboo', 'so', 'strong', 'place', 'potential', 'offenders', 'turn', 'focus', 'sex', 'criminals', 'punishing', 'fact', 'are', 'there', 'outlets', 'where', 'such', 'people', 'can', 'privately', 'seek', 'help', 'succumb', 'urges', 'are', ""n't"", 'perhaps', 'should', 'be.The', 'other', 'subplots', 'follow', 'chronic', 'masturbator', 'down-on-her-luck', 'woman', 'who', 'mistreated', 'movie', 'ways', 'straddle', 'knife-edge', 'cruelty', 'humor', 'older', 'couple', 'marraige', 'dissolving', 'Maybe', 'just', 'thought', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'was', 'scene-stealingly', 'funny', 'stoic', 'retiree', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'alone.Anyway', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'see', 'are', 'not', 'automatically', 'turned', 'off', 'inner', 'lives', 'desperate', 'people', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'force', 'think', 'happiness', 'what', 'who', 'how', 'do', 'go', 'getting', 'anyway']",N/A

I had heard so much about its more controversial elements, but I had no idea it would be quite so hateful. This said, I did not hate the movie as a viewer at all. At times I was shocked by some of its more unsavoury storylines, but I was captivated by how the darker elements of human nature are so pervasive. We just do not always notice them in reality. This film examines those darker parts of humanity by exacerbating them and looking past the veneer of ""pretty and perfect"" nuclear families. Many people who watch this film WILL hate it. Many will be highly offended. Some will be perplexed and moved to thought. All the actors here give outstanding performances as people who lead seemingly normal lives but who have secrets and edges to their personalities which make them more... human. Sometimes these flaws and faults make them positively disgusting people. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as a prank-phone-calling pervert with a whiny but monotone voice. He lusts after his neighbour, played with an icy touch by a self-absorbed Lara Flynn Boyle (the role does not seem much of a stretch for her). When Hoffman begins phoning Boyle, she insists they have to meet so he can do all the obscene things to her that he talks about doing in his prank phone calls. When they do, she immediately says, ""This isn't working."" Another tenant in their building, played manically well by Boyle's The Practice co-star Camryn Mannheim, lusts after Hoffman and comes to his door nightly to report minutiae about various other tenants in the building. Hoffman is blind to her feelings and rejects her. Until finally she confesses nonchalantly to having murdered their doorman. The film, with characters and scenes like these, can be at once horrifying and also heartbreaking. Meanwhile, Boyle's character has two sisters, one (played well by Jane Adams, whom we have seen in Frasier and in Wonder Boys) an aimless sort who cannot keep a job and cannot fall in love and even when she thinks she does, one bad things after another happens. The other sister is played by Cynthia Stevenson, who might best be remembered for playing a similar role in tv's short-lived Hope and Gloria (she was the irrepressible and always positive Hope). Her character believes she has the perfect, stable life with a psychologist husband, a wonderful son, and a nice house. Little does she know, and this is how depraved the characters in the film are, her husband is a pedophile, and he drugs one of his son's friends in order to molest him. By the end of the film, of course, all of these illusions fall apart.

You just sit there for two hours agog, wondering what in the world talented performers are doing in a film such as this. You ask yourself Is there no line an actor will draw when offered a role? It really is as though the entire cast have been conditioned not to detect obscenity before walking onto the set.I am really loath to lower myself to Todd Solonz's level by discussing the (literally) masturbatory  visuals and dialogue, but suffice to say that the movie is indeed explicit to the point of repulsion, and therefore, by modern American artistic standards, must be profound and thought-provoking. You find the sight of a man using his own natural glue to stick postcards to his bedroom wall repulsive? Well, you musn't be thinking hard enough about the deep message of the movie. You're turned off by the sight of a father abusing himself in the back seat of a car while flicking through a children's comic? Well then you musn't be letting the movie challenge your assumptions about yada yada yada ...It needs to be said plainly. American taste is rapidly descending into a quagmire where the intellectual knee-jerk reaction to obscenity is to immediately, unthinkingly mistake it for profundity. Champions of freedom of expression have sought to make this freedom boundless, such that even what is universally acknowledged to be appalling is given voice, that the demon of censorship may never get a toe-hold. But by now the very act of pushing the envelope of bad taste has itself become a mark of artistic merit, and works that are self-evidently repulsive are considered great for no other reason than that they supposedly reaffirm the sheer breadth of America's freedom of expression.The point made by almost every advocate of freedom of speech, from Jefferson to Mill, is that suppression of that freedom may exclude us from coming into contact with important ideas. Thus even bad ideas should be given a forum. This is true enough. But that does not mean that the broader the leeway for expression, the more we should jettison our taste and judgement. In fact, the opposite is true: when there is no external quality control, then our own taste and discernment needs to be at its sharpest, to winnow the wheat from the chaff. Happiness clearly crosses a threshold of taste, and when movies such as this are well-received, we are in trouble. But that must just be the repressed prude in me talking. You know - that bad person who doesn't sit back and pensively stroke his chin at the sight of someone masturbating.When Monsters from the Moon, one of the worst sci-fi B-movies of the 50s was released, one reviewer commented: `Everyone involved with this film deserves censure.'

The screenplay was daring, unusual, and intelligent, and the acting was all-round superb.Of course this is not the kind of movie that everyone can enjoy - it's two and a half hours of utter human misery and depravity, all centered around the powerful sexual obsession that can overwhelm and eventually consume people.  I felt deep sadness for the son of the child molestor, who spends the movie worrying about whether he will ever have an orgasm - at only eleven, he has already been corrupted by a society that is hopelessly bound to and dependent on sexuality.

At one point in my life, I had a great deal of patience with experimental work, precisely because it was experimental.  The very effort to establish new ground, to expand the vocabulary of the cinema (or of music or literature, whatever the genre) seemed admirable, in some cases even heroic.  But the older you get, the less patience you have with youthful indulgences and pretensions.  It just happens.It's nice to be reminded that there are people out there, doing provocative, challenging work, that is also good.  As I read some of the comments people have posted here re: Todd Solondz' 1998 film HAPPINESS, I found myself agreeing both with the positive AND many of the negative reviews.  It is a difficult, actually oftentimes painful film to watch.  The humor, mordant as it may be, is apparently all that saves Solondz from total despair.  (I could be wrong on this point, since I know little about him and haven't yet seen his other work.)  What I can say is that this stark, grim movie is one that sticks with you.  You may end up wishing otherwise, but you won't forget it.One point where I would differ with a number of the film's harsher critics.  I don't know that the Dylan Baker's character is particularly sypmpathetic.  He is portrayed as being complex and tormented soul--traits that would seem to be likely in at least some pederasts.  One could say that Fritz Lang's classic film M's portrait of a child abuser (in this case, actually, a child murderer) more sympathetic than Solondz.

It will shock you, depress you, disturb you, and profoundly affect you in all kinds of emotional ways. This film is misunderstood because most people don't realize that this is a black/dark comedy in disguise. The film is hard to watch, but at the same time you HAVE to keep watching. The plot is really just a group of people acting absolutely loathsome towards each other and/or going through extremely distressing drama. The characters consist of a pedophile, a sexually frustrated pervert, a young boy who is drugged and raped, a completely depressed and lonely woman whose emotions are trampled throughout the film, and a sexually curious pre-teen asking every embarrassing question about sex you could possibly conceive a child asking (and beyond), among others. The filmmakers obviously have a lot of animosity towards people, and life in general. So, if you watch this film, be warned: absolutely ADULTS ONLY!! And, I'd say only watch this if you can handle very disturbing sexual and/or violent content. The acting is great, the script is really good, and the content is totally engrossing. There are NO special features here, so only buy this if you like the film, or don't care about special features.

I'd heard so many things about it, both good and bad, that I had no idea what to expect.  And indeed, it was the absolute last thing I expected: truly and profoundly boring.Having recently watched 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' (which I adored) and now 'Happiness', I think Solondz employs a reliable method to evoke laughter - he delves into our deepest anxieties, in this case our fear that we are depraved, weak, pitiful, unlovable. While many movies dance around this subject matter, Solondz dives right in, and refuses to grant any relief. His films tell you that your worst doubts may very well be true. That break-up conversation WILL go horribly wrong. The sad loser you dump WON'T recover and go on to find his soul mate. I consider myself to be fairly demon-riddled, and thus a prime candidate to enjoy this type of humor, but 'Happiness', despite the abundance of sexual fluids, remains an oddly arid film.While I know this will comparison will cause 'Happiness' lovers to quiver with rage, I really consider 'American Beauty', while far less ambitious, to be a more powerful film. I sympathized with Kevin Spacey's character a great deal, which made his obsession with his daughter's best friend all the more squicky. I didn't empathize with anyone in 'Happiness' in the slightest, and was therefore not moved by the cruelty, pathos, and flat-out stupidity of their actions. Everyone could have turned into giant, talking aardvarks halfway through the movie, and I wouldn't have been particularly surprised or affected.I find this particularly odd because I know several women like Joy, and feel the anxiety her character is meant to evoke: what do you do with people who care so much about helping others, but are somehow ineffectual? I would think I'd find her character utterly engrossing, but no. Not even a shiver of interest. While watching `Dollhouse', I was constantly debating whether to laugh, cry, or throw up. While watching ""Happiness', I was debating whether to turn it off and catch something on HBO.Finally, and I know this is just a personal quirk, I can't stand watching conversations that are filled with long, awkward pauses, which pretty much defines this entire movie.The acting is fairly solid and there are a few funny moments here and there, which is why I think the film merits two stars. Overall, though, if you haven't seen a Solondz yet, I'd suggest `Dollhouse'. I'd also like to recommend another movie that covers similar themes, though it is not well known: `Spanking the Monkey'.",5,Turns out that happiness is not all it's cracked up to be,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2611,"['watched', 'film', 'hoping', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'afraid', ""'d"", 'be', 'too', 'disgusted', 'finish', ""'d"", 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'good', 'bad', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'indeed', 'was', 'absolute', 'last', 'thing', 'expected', 'truly', 'profoundly', 'boring.Having', 'recently', 'watched', 'Dollhouse', 'adored', 'now', ""'Happiness"", 'think', 'Solondz', 'reliable', 'method', 'evoke', 'laughter', 'deepest', 'anxieties', 'case', 'fear', 'are', 'depraved', 'weak', 'pitiful', 'unlovable', 'many', 'movies', 'dance', 'subject', 'matter', 'Solondz', 'right', 'grant', 'relief', 'films', 'tell', 'worst', 'doubts', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'true', 'break-up', 'conversation', 'WILL', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'sad', 'loser', 'dump', 'WO', ""N'T"", 'recover', 'go', 'find', 'soul', 'mate', 'consider', 'be', 'fairly', 'demon-riddled', 'thus', 'prime', 'candidate', 'enjoy', 'type', 'humor', ""'Happiness"", 'abundance', 'sexual', 'fluids', 'oddly', 'arid', 'film.While', 'know', 'will', 'comparison', 'will', 'cause', ""'Happiness"", 'lovers', 'quiver', 'rage', 'really', 'consider', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'far', 'less', 'ambitious', 'be', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'sympathized', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'great', 'deal', 'made', 'obsession', 'daughter', 'best', 'friend', 'more', 'squicky', 'did', ""n't"", 'empathize', 'anyone', ""'Happiness"", 'slightest', 'was', 'therefore', 'not', 'moved', 'cruelty', 'pathos', 'flat-out', 'stupidity', 'actions', 'Everyone', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'giant', 'talking', 'aardvarks', 'halfway', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'particularly', 'surprised', 'affected.I', 'find', 'particularly', 'odd', 'know', 'several', 'women', 'Joy', 'feel', 'anxiety', 'character', 'meant', 'evoke', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'helping', 'others', 'are', 'somehow', 'ineffectual', 'would', 'think', ""'d"", 'find', 'character', 'utterly', 'engrossing', 'Not', 'even', 'shiver', 'interest', 'watching', 'Dollhouse', 'was', 'constantly', 'debating', 'laugh', 'cry', 'throw', 'up', 'watching', 'Happiness', 'was', 'debating', 'turn', 'off', 'catch', 'something', 'HBO.Finally', 'know', 'just', 'personal', 'quirk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'conversations', 'are', 'filled', 'long', 'awkward', 'pauses', 'pretty', 'much', 'defines', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'fairly', 'solid', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'why', 'think', 'film', 'merits', 'two', 'stars', 'Overall', 'though', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Solondz', 'yet', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Dollhouse', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'recommend', 'movie', 'similar', 'themes', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'Spanking', 'Monkey']",N/A
502870,A34A095NNHFMB5,B00000IC7B,Jack Felson,"[5, 7]","""Happiness"" tells the story of about twelve characters all looking for happiness, especially three sisters. Joy (Jane Adams) is a single, average, not very attractive but very nice and sensitive woman, employed in a software company. When she manages to find a boyfriend (a Russian thief), she believes she just found love and happiness but the trouble begins. Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle, ""Twin Peaks"", ""Men in Black 2""), just published a useless novel. She has too many boyfriends, which means she doesn't have any. She's aware of the meaninglessness of her life and believes she just found happiness when her neighbor, a sick man, insults her on the phone. Trish (Cynthia Stevenson, ""The Player"") is married to an average American man, with a situation. She believes she's happy, with the ideal family, but she doesn't know that her husband is fond of little boys...Their father is more reasonable: when his doctor tells him he's gonna live until he's a hundred years old, with the condition of staying away from salt, he just adds more salt in his meals, in order to make his life shorter...With this third long feature, Todd Solondz, an independent and iconoclast American writer-director, slowly and carefully destroys the goldened image of the average family, not only in the U.S. The result is a real shocker, trashy, hilarious and highly, disturbly realistic. What Sam Mendes (along with his screenwriter, Alan Ball) only suggested in ""American Beauty"", Todd Solondz shows it straight (uncomfort, hypocrisy, vice and vanity in life, especially inside families), dealing with [sexual situations] without putting gloves on. This leads to the hilarious and unstandable scene where the father confesses in front of his son that he's a pervert. Many people compared ""Happiness"" to ""American Beauty"", talking about it as a hard version; but they forgot or didn't know that ""Happiness"" was filmed and released one year before. So actually, ""American Beauty"", it's ""Happiness"" in a soft, sweet way. I even suspect Alan Ball for having taken ""Happiness"" and based upon it to write a gentle version.The casting is very ecclectic. Dylan Baker and Philip Seymour Hoffman are great as nutcases, Camryn Manheim is very good, and Ben Gazzara, who used to be one of Cassavetes' favorite actors, gets involved in Solondz's universe the most ideal way. With this film, Solondz can easily be compared to Tarantino and ""Pulp Fiction"" from his many portraits and his way to go from one character to another, with talent, competence and control. ""American Beauty"", with Dreamworks behind, its cast of stars and a bunch of Oscars, still doesn't have the strength of Cannes International Film Festival acclaimed (and prized) ""Happiness"", which is about to be a classic. An incredible shocker and a rarer and rarer piece of American cinema work. Some people should see it to understand the world.

Todd Solondz combines really absurd situations and embarrassing moments -some of which most of us do encounter in daily life and some we hopefully won't- with serious issues. Thus, this film provides not only a very high degree of entertainment -Solondz' sense for irony is exceptional-, it gives you a critical view on society without judging or condemning or forcing you to think one way or the other. I am genuinely impressed by Happiness and its cast full of great actors.It is littered with an assortment of characters that seem to have sexual fetishes and perversions of some sort. Solondz explores some dark subjects and you would think this would make the film harsh and difficult to watch, but it holds your attention throughout mainly because of the excellent performances on show, especially from Dylan Baker as a respected doctor who holds a terrible secret, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as an obscene phone-caller. He is so incredibly versatile - he successfully made my skin crawl here. Before I even go further the very first scene is probably the best work John Lovitz has ever done. This movie looks dead on at some of the most awkward and horrific things in American culture, but never ever ever tells you or suggests to you what you should think or feel, the way most films do. John's Speech will blow you away. Jane Adams, who has a calamitous love life and plays the social reject of three dysfunctional sisters, does a wonderful job in role her facial expressions will get you going.  My personal favorite was Cynthia Stevenson as one of those typical housewives with 2.5 kids and a carpool. Her character was so obnoxious, superficial and condescending - she clearly did a wonderful job. I was also a huge fan of Camryn Manheim (what a twist!), Lara Flynn Boyle (she gives new meaning to the role of the phony snob), Elizabeth Ashley, and Molly Shannon's cameo which was HYSTERICAL. And the child actors...simply brilliant and such difficult material. The film's most powerful and emotional scene is towards the end when Baker's character has a trying conversation with his son.I think it is fair to say that anyone watching this film can identify with at LEAST one of the so-called 'sicknesses' of the characters, therefore, it is the look in to the dark recesses of their own minds that makes them so uncomfortable. The world is a messed up place, and we all contribute to that in our own fashion, some more than others, but nevertheless, we all do, because our lives all clash with one another at some point. The best we can do is to face it and deal with it, not act as though we are separate from it! I suppose what I am trying to say is that this work is an important, unflinching look at the REAL reality in this world and, like it or not, it does affect you in one way or another, so you might as well face up to it by identifying with this film!",4,"The Banality of Perversion & Dysfunction, middle-America style",1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,2906,"['film', 'indeed', 'marvelous', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'combines', 'really', 'absurd', 'situations', 'embarrassing', 'moments', '-some', 'most', 'do', 'encounter', 'daily', 'life', 'hopefully', ""won't-"", 'serious', 'issues', 'Thus', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'high', 'degree', 'entertainment', '-Solondz', 'sense', 'irony', 'exceptional-', 'critical', 'view', 'society', 'judging', 'condemning', 'forcing', 'think', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'am', 'genuinely', 'impressed', 'Happiness', 'cast', 'full', 'great', 'actors.It', 'littered', 'assortment', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'sexual', 'fetishes', 'perversions', 'sort', 'Solondz', 'dark', 'subjects', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'harsh', 'difficult', 'watch', 'attention', 'mainly', 'excellent', 'performances', 'show', 'especially', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'respected', 'doctor', 'who', 'terrible', 'secret', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'obscene', 'phone-caller', 'so', 'incredibly', 'versatile', 'successfully', 'made', 'skin', 'crawl', 'here', 'even', 'go', 'further', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'probably', 'best', 'work', 'John', 'Lovitz', 'ever', 'done', 'movie', 'dead', 'most', 'awkward', 'horrific', 'things', 'American', 'culture', 'never', 'ever', 'ever', 'what', 'should', 'think', 'feel', 'way', 'most', 'films', 'do', 'John', 'Speech', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'who', 'calamitous', 'love', 'life', 'social', 'reject', 'three', 'dysfunctional', 'sisters', 'wonderful', 'job', 'role', 'facial', 'expressions', 'will', 'get', 'going', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'one', 'typical', 'housewives', '2.5', 'kids', 'carpool', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'superficial', 'condescending', 'clearly', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'was', 'also', 'huge', 'fan', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'what', 'twist', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'new', 'meaning', 'role', 'phony', 'snob', 'Elizabeth', 'Ashley', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'cameo', 'was', 'HYSTERICAL', 'child', 'actors', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'such', 'difficult', 'material', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Baker', 'character', 'trying', 'conversation', 'son.I', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'anyone', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'identify', 'LEAST', 'one', 'so-called', ""'sicknesses"", 'characters', 'therefore', 'look', 'dark', 'recesses', 'own', 'minds', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'world', 'messed', 'up', 'place', 'contribute', 'own', 'fashion', 'more', 'others', 'nevertheless', 'do', 'lives', 'clash', 'one', 'point', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'face', 'deal', 'not', 'act', 'are', 'separate', 'suppose', 'what', 'am', 'trying', 'say', 'work', 'important', 'unflinching', 'look', 'REAL', 'reality', 'world', 'not', 'affect', 'one', 'way', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'face', 'up', 'identifying', 'film']",N/A

Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), the main character if there is one, is the primary receptacle of abuse either in her obvious relationships with men, or her subtle relationships with her own family. She is a fledgling songwriter, who wistfully sings about a ""happiness"" that doesn't exist in director Todd Solondz' dysfunctional world. Other denizens of this world are her sister Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) who deludes herself into thinking she has a wonderful marriage and family, her other sister Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) a self loathing and cynical writer, Trish's husband Bill (Dylan Baker) a psychiatrist and covert pedophile who drugs and rapes his son's friend and schoolmate, and one of his patients, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a shy neighbor of Helen's who fantasizes about brutally raping her and gets his rocks off making lewd phone calls. There are also Joy's parents (Ben Gazzara and Louise Lasser), and an overweight, psychotic tenant (Camryn Mannheim) in Helen and Allen's building..but I won't elaborate on them.HAPPINESS is not a happy movie, although there is a load of very dark humor in it.

With the exception of Larry Clark's work the topic of pedophilia has never been treated as openly and boldly as in HAPPINESS. Bill's final conversation with his son is totally unnerving and makes you squirm in your seat.I will recommend this film, but with reservations.

502878,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00000IC7B,J from NY,"[0, 0]","I loved &quot;Happiness&quot;. Not once did it breach my sense of ethics, humor or morality. That might be because it is a film expressly intended to dig into the tenuous roots of modern morality, humor, and ethics.It goes without saying that I had an idea of what I was going to see coming in. If you rent/buy this film under the impression that you are going to sit back and be entertained for a few hours, you will be in for quite the unpleasant shock. But after all, isn't that why there's a label on the front: &quot;FOR MATURE AUDIENCES&quot;? Yeah, probably. All you Fascists of Film who got your panties in a bunch because it deals with subject matter you can't handle should stick to &quot;Love Actually&quot; or &quot;13 Going on 30&quot;.The truth of the matter is that Solondz's &quot;Happiness&quot; is one of the most engaging, challenging films to roll around in awhile. It is also drop dead funny, if in an extremely strange way. It forces us to sympathize with characters we normally see on the 6:00 news wearing orange jumpsuits, leg shackles and cuffs, and does so in a way we will never forget. Admittedly, Solondz's portrait of humanity is not appealing or optimistic; the characters run the gamut from revolting specimens, deeply sick individuals, depressed and 'downcast' people, criminals, to children caught in the crossfire of a postmodern world devoid of real human connection. My favorite scene is when Timmy's father, a closet pedophile, makes a desperate plea to his oblivious wife. &quot;I'm sick,&quot; he says, his face dead pale. &quot;Take an aspirin,&quot; she replies drowsily.The lie of cozy domesticity, the illusion of innocence, the truly repugnant nature of most of our basic instincts are driven home with brutal force. The ending is the most heart-rending piece in the entire film, and one wonders how they pulled it off. Think of it as a particularly distasteful episode of &quot;South Park&quot; with cinematic genius behind it. Kudos to Todd Solondz for having the balls to make and market this singular, disturbing film.",5,&quot;I am not a scab...I am a STRIKE BREAKER&quot;,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,2068,"['loved', 'quot', 'Happiness', 'quot', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'breach', 'sense', 'ethics', 'humor', 'morality', 'might', 'be', 'film', 'expressly', 'intended', 'dig', 'tenuous', 'roots', 'modern', 'morality', 'humor', 'ethics.It', 'saying', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'coming', 'rent/buy', 'film', 'impression', 'are', 'going', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'entertained', 'few', 'hours', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'unpleasant', 'shock', ""n't"", 'that', 'why', 'label', 'front', 'quot', 'FOR', 'MATURE', 'AUDIENCES', 'quot', 'Yeah', 'probably', 'Fascists', 'Film', 'who', 'got', 'panties', 'bunch', 'subject', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'should', 'stick', 'quot', 'Love', 'Actually', 'quot', 'quot', '13', 'Going', '30', 'quot', '.The', 'truth', 'matter', 'Solondz', 'quot', 'Happiness', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'challenging', 'films', 'roll', 'around', 'awhile', 'also', 'drop', 'dead', 'funny', 'extremely', 'strange', 'way', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'normally', 'see', '6:00', 'news', 'wearing', 'orange', 'jumpsuits', 'leg', 'shackles', 'cuffs', 'so', 'way', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Admittedly', 'Solondz', 'portrait', 'humanity', 'not', 'appealing', 'optimistic', 'characters', 'run', 'gamut', 'revolting', 'specimens', 'deeply', 'sick', 'individuals', 'depressed', ""'downcast"", 'people', 'criminals', 'children', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'postmodern', 'world', 'devoid', 'real', 'human', 'connection', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Timmy', 'father', 'closet', 'pedophile', 'desperate', 'plea', 'oblivious', 'wife', 'quot', ""'m"", 'sick', 'quot', 'face', 'dead', 'pale', 'quot', 'Take', 'aspirin', 'quot', 'drowsily.The', 'lie', 'cozy', 'domesticity', 'illusion', 'innocence', 'truly', 'repugnant', 'nature', 'most', 'basic', 'instincts', 'are', 'driven', 'home', 'brutal', 'force', 'ending', 'most', 'heart-rending', 'piece', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'Think', 'particularly', 'distasteful', 'episode', 'quot', 'South', 'Park', 'quot', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'Kudos', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'having', 'balls', 'make', 'market', 'singular', 'disturbing', 'film']",N/A

damaged,empty,disgusting characters.The type of person who has the facade  of success but who are really just wasting away.It makes me uncomfortable  and uneasy admitting that i thoroughly enjoyed this film,but i definitely  did.What does that say about me that i thought this was a brilliantly  written,directed,and acted film that entertained from start to finish.Some  reviewers say that Solondz exploited and took pleasure in the characters'  hopelessness and evil acts,and i agree he crossed the line in some scenes  and went into unnecessary detail with regards to sexually explicit  conversations Dylan Baker's character would have with his son played by  Justin Elvin.I can't defend those aspects of the story as i believe they  were utilized for sheer tittilation.Some things do not have to be said,and  a more mature director would have found a way to broach some of this  subject matter,which i feel is very important,without going into graphic  detail.A movie called &quot;The War Zone&quot; dealt with similar themes  but with more sublety and class.It's scary that there are pedophiles who  will watch this film and get excited by some of these scenes and  dialogue.It's Solondz responsibility as an director and person to avoid  glamorizing pedophilia in the guise of simply pointing it out.The rest of  the characters aren't as sickening as Baker's but there still  revolting.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a virtual hermit whose social life  consists almost entirely of making random obscene phone calls to women  and,well,you know the rest.Jane Adams is a confused young women who just  can't get it right with men.She consistently picks men who will use her for  sex,or whatever else they may want.Lara Flynn Boyle(the Joker's main  squeeze)plays her sister,a woman with ice in her vains and vanity that  knows no bounds.The third sister,played by Cynthia Stevenson,is the loving  housewife,who loves her husband so much she does'nt realize what a  vile,disgusting creature he is,and that he's a sexual predator of young  boys.Jon Lovitz in a brief cameo plays a jilted lover in the opening  scene,a scene i feel is one of the funniest in the film.Ben Gazzara and  Louise Lasser play the parents of the three sisters.It's the typical  married couple don't excite each other anymore sexually subplot i've seen  countless times before.It's the weakest link in the film.What i was left  with was that if you love someone too much you might fail to see how  degenerate and evil they've become,and that when you finally except who you  are ,that even a sad sack or lost soul can find &quot;Happiness&quot;.If  you can overlook some absolutely disgusting dialogue this film delivers the  goods.A definite purchase for people who love character driven ensemble  pieces with wonderful acting.Beware:Watch At Your Own Risk.",4,Short Cuts with grim subject matter,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,2959,"['doubt', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'immensely',

Also outstanding is Adams, a shrinking violet incapable of malice and always at the butt end of petty brutalities.

The first time I saw this, I was so shocked by the themes of the film that I missed the absurd humor of it. The next time, my friend was so obviously uncomfortable that I slept so I didn't have to watch him nauseated and confused. Now, I can see it as the most brilliant mix of sadness and comedy that I'm ever bound to see. There are moments where you're not sure how you're supposed to react. That's the point. What am I supposed to think about something I have empathy for and laugh at? That's the open-ended question that remains long after the plot is tied up. You always hear people say that they don't know whether to laugh or cry in everyday situations, but how many director's do you think can capture such a real feeling in a fictional story? todd solondz is amazing and overlooked, and this is his gem. He sees things as the are, with an appreciation for irony and the ability to observe without judging. ""Happiness"" is a low-budget movie; I can't deny that it shows. It doesn't look like a shiny new hollywod blockbuster. It looks like an actors-without-pay indie film. That's what it is, but the cast always pulls through.

502884,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00000IC7B,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","""Happiness"" is a movie that is basically about irony and everything about the movie is ironic...Including the title. No one in this movie is happy, not even the characters who think they are. And once the movie's over, you probably won't be overwhelmed with happiness either. This is not a happy movie...Although it is pretty funny, in a sick demented way. But I think the review on the cover sums up the film nicely;""Deeply Disturbing and Shockingly Funny.""This movie has some of the most disturbing and sometimes disgusting scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time. The movie centers around three sisters; Joy (Jane Adams), Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), and Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) Jordan. Although almost all the characters in the film kind of circle back to these three sisters, they're not really the main characters.The movie opens with Joy on a dinner date with a man named Andy (Jon Lovitz). Andy looks distraught as Joy tells him that it's not going to work out. In what I think to be one of the funniest and awkward scenes in a movie that I've seen recently, Adam gives her a limited edition goldplated ashtray and then takes it away and tells her he's saving it for the girl who truly loves him. The credit sequence promptly follows. Then we suddenly meet a man named Allen (Oscar Winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) who explains to his therapist Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker, 'Head of State') that he's having sexual fantasties about his next door neighbor, who just happens to be Helen.Bill also happens to be married to Trish. Ironic. Allen begins a series of calls to Helen, telling her in graphic detail what he thinks about her before more irony begins pouring in. Meanwhile, we learn that it seems Trish is the only happy one in this trio of sisters...She seems to have the perfect life; three kids and a good husband. But Bill is hiding something as well, a perverted fascination with little boys. Really disturbing scenes become of this fascination. There's also a subplot about the sister's parents (Louise Lasser & Ben Gazzarra) who are splitting up; And Camryn Manheim (The former ABC TV show 'The Apprentice') who plays a neighbor of Allen's who's also hiding a secret. Now, I expected to love ""Happiness"" for some reason; Even though I knew hardly anything of the plot. But, I didn't love...I liked it, but I didn't love it. It's a very unique movie and it's definitely funny; but I thought that the most interesting aspect of the movie was the one you see the least.Allen, played so well by Hoffman, could've been the subject of his own film. Don't get me wrong, I don't think they should've gotten rid of the rest of the story but I think that they should have payed more attention to this character.Besides the story, there are other good things about it. The dialogue is very smart and there's some classic lines in this movie. The conversations Bill has with his son are very creepy though. In case, this hasn't been made clear. This movie is not for everybody; Many people may find it sick and immoral, especially since it seems that nothing really bad happens to Bill despite his wrongdoings.

The answer to that question was unimaginable until I saw this very interesting approach.  Todd Solondz goes overboard with shock in this lengthy and twisted comedy-drama. If you find yourself laughing at this film and then you feel guilty about it you are not alone.I stayed up one night until 2:30am attached to this film. It is horribly depressing and none of the characters are remotely likable but you relate to them nonetheless and eventually they manage to win you over. This film sticks in your head and is NC-17 for a reason. It takes a pedophile and a sexually harassing office worker (played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman) and it allows you to see a side of them that is just like yourself. You will find yourself relating to characters you hate and then you will find yourself feeling sorry for them. This film does something to the subconscious that can only be explained as disturbing.

502888,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00000IC7B,Kenji Fujishima,"[7, 15]","Todd Solondz is an undeniably talented filmmaker, with an ear for dialogue that rivals with the best. I haven't seen his most recent film PALINDROMES yet, but his 2001 film STORYTELLING, for me, proved that he could be genuinely challenging and provocative, making a two-part film that explored ideas about truth and art, and whether art can ever really contain truth. In many ways, it was Solondz striking back at his critics. STORYTELLING was a film with thematic depth that still managed to maintain that shocking edge that characterized this film and his 1995 WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE; that's why, of his first three films, I consider STORYTELLING to be the best of them.As for HAPPINESS...well, for all its occasional scenes of sensitive acting and writing, and for all its occasionally effective shock scenes (enough to earn the movie an extra star from me), HAPPINESS strikes me as little more than a generally worthless freakshow of a movie. It's as if Solondz decided to put his mind toward creating as shocking and disgusting a bunch of characters as possible, placing them in everyday settings, filming the various stories in as innocent-looking a style as possible (the set designs and bright color schemes seem right out of a '60s family TV show or something), and calling the whole thing his singularly harsh vision of the darkness underlying suburbia. But I never bought for a second that this was the work of someone who was serious about exploring characters or motivations, or exploring what could lead to such shocking behavior in the suburbs. No, in HAPPINESS, Todd Solondz is simply trying to shock you as much as  possible---and apparently it worked well enough that people fell for it and considered it ""edgy"" and ""brilliant."" It may be edgy and brilliant after all; but it's also worthless as either black comedy or a harsh look at the depravity that lurks underneath the placid veneer of suburban existence. Call me a prude if you must, but I still found Solondz's misanthropy much more convincing in the superior WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE.

This movie reportedly is a very dark comedy, but I did not even smile one time. Not once.I am not easily shocked, or conservative, but much of the movie seemed to be there only so that those responsible could say ""look, our movie talks about or shows this or that"" - in this case we get semen shooting on to a wall in one scene, then later, semen shooting onto a balcony railing to be licked off by a dog. Wonderful.Maybe the humor was in the sex-ed Q&A; between the 11-year old son and father, where words of wisdom included the fact that it's not the length that is important, but the width (so says the dad), and that ""come"" can be a verb as well as a noun. Insightful!I can't find a way to get any humor out of anally raping young boys - and I'm afraid Happiness couldn't find it either - unless it was the father's line to his 11-year old son that he would only jerk off instead of raping him. Witty.OK, OK, I did find the one bit of humor. It was at the restaurant when Camryn Mannheim's character orders a hot fudge sundae after talking about murdering the doorman who helped carry her groceries to her apartment and asked for some ice before raping her.Every character was hopelessly uninteresting and one-dimensional. Who cares? But seriously, it could have gotten an oscar for best special effect - creating an animatronic character looking exactly like Lara Flynn Boyle. On the back cover is a picture of her looking flat and unmoving. That represents her action sequence. The rest of the characters? Look at the front cover.

Loosely, it follows a dysfunctional family through a variety of perverse situations.  The father in the &quot;perfect&quot; family is a pedophile who is after his 11-year-old son's friends; another character is an obscene phone caller; and then there is the lonely sister-in-law who looks for love in all the wrong places.  There's masturbation, shock value in most of the scenes, and lots of twists and turns to the plot. There's also some incredibly good acting and directing.However, the director, Todd Solondz,  didn't seem to quite know whether to play this film for comedy or pathos and most of it is not funny, just sick and depressing.

When it came out on DVD, I had to go out and purchase it immediately.The Amazon.com review calls this film ""abuse in the guise of art,"" an ill-conceived criticism which shows why this film is so revelatory.  The best films do not play to the moral rigidities or sensitivities of the viewer, but attempt to shatter these and reveal situations in new lights.  Yes, there is a pedophile in the film.  No, he is not glorified.  Perhaps he is humanized.. but he is a HUMAN BEING.  People can fall in love with others besides those of the opposite sex who have reached a certain age.  (See Mann's Death in Venice, Lolita, etc.)  If you want your TV movie-of-the-week with its sugarcoated, spoonfed morality, look elsewhere.The comparison of the father's disturbed sexuality with his son's sexual coming of age is interesting as well.  The son is preoccupied with his ejaculatory ""rite of passage"" into manhood.  We're all sexual beings and we've all passed that rite.. but what happens when our intrinsic sexual natures go awry, as with the father?The other stories are outstanding, especially Vlad, the simultaneously hilarious and disturbing ""go-getter"" new to America.  The only flaw was the story of the elderly couple, whose apathetic stupor contributes little to the film.It has been said that great literature suggests a vastness without explicitly saying it.  This movie suggests a lot, and leaves one thinking.  But for others, perhaps the movie will simply be a sideshow of freaks they can't relate to.

Few of these break out.  However, that's even more to reason investigate films that push the limit and Todd Solondz's ""Happiness"" not only does that, it pushes your buttons.  Heaped with plenty of characters with dubious or questionable morals (great actors ensemble), viewers have found pieces of this story either hilarious or repellent, but outrageous in every respect.  ""Happiness"" presents characters of middle America at their rawest and sometimes bleakest moments, making decisions that almost always bring them another difficult hurdle to overcome.I personally saw this film as hilarious and unbelievably inventive.  Every character is woven in a twisted plot of selfishness or self-awareness.  Sex appears as the main motif and it isn't always pretty.  In fact, Solodnz seems to use it as a tool to both disgust and delight the audience simultaneously.  There's the rub - the viewer never knows quite how to appropriately react - just like most of the characters in the film.

It seems that just about everyone in this movie has serious personal problems; and the film gives us a frank and often brutally honest view of troubled lives.There are several main characters in the film whose lives all intertwine to some degree. There's Mona and Lenny Jordan (Louise Lasser and Ben Gazzara) whose marriage is coming apart after 40 years of togetherness; and we see their three daughters Trish Maplewood, Joy Jordan and Helen Jordan (Cynthia Stevenson, Jane Adams and Lara Flynn Boyle, respectively). Trish has no idea that her husband Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) likes little boys way too much as he supports his family by being, of all things, a psychiatrist.In addition, we also meet Allan (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Allan is frustrated for lack of a woman in his life so he makes lewd crank phone calls to women. We also meet the Maplewood's two sons, Billy and Timmy. Look for some particularly fine acting from Rufus Read who plays Billy Maplewood.As the film progresses, we see all of these people trying to find happiness. Although they try to make emotional connections with other people they fail. Allan can't do any better than a woman with a rather grisly little secret; and Mona cracks up when Lenny, her husband of forty years, leaves her for ""no one"" and the one time we see Lenny with another woman he complains that he feels ""nothing."" Of course, trouble looms over the Maplewood household as Bill Maplewood tries desperately to hide his pedophilia from his family. It doesn't help that the love life has faded out of the Maplewood marriage.Suffice it to say that the plots and subplots take many interesting turns along the way; and although the subject matter can definitely be disturbing few people who do choose to watch or buy this movie will ever switch it off before the ending. Actually, there is one person who does achieve a degree of happiness at the very ending of the movie--but I'll leave out the specifics so you can experience that for yourself.The DVD comes with pitifully few extras. Instead of a few commentaries and some extra deleted scenes, we get little more than scene selection and a ""filmography"" for five of the actors in the movie. A disappointment for sure!Overall, this excellent movie is for a crowd that's not exactly squeamish. Happiness eagerly delves into deeply disturbing yet all too real problems society faces every day--and when the movie ends you feel better off for having watched it.

502905,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00000IC7B,M. Burns,"[120, 126]","There have been few times that I've sat for more than two hours, intently watching a film, screaming ""I hate this movie!"" as the credits begin to roll, but then realize that I don't hate it at all. In fact, I don't know if that has ever happened before, but last night, after the final, revolting line of Todd Solondz's 1998 shocker Happiness, I did just that, and probably because I couldn't bring myself to admit I liked it. It's a movie that deals with wildly perverse subject matter, contains not a truly likeable character in the whole bunch, and doesn't even bother to show the consequences of the horrible actions for any of its transgressors. If there is a poster-child movie for complete and total amorality, Happiness is the one. But I liked it, and that scares me.Joy (Jane Adams) has absolutely nothing in common with her name; her sister Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is a sultry, narcissistic author who wants the experience of being raped to make her writing authentic; other sister Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) is married to Dr. Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) and has three kids. Dr. Bill is a pedophile who pleasures himself to teen magazines in the backseat of his car and has dreams of murdering strangers in a park; Dr. Bill's strangest patient, Allen (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), makes obscene phone calls and has an inventive way of pasting postcards to the wall; Allen's neighbor, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), is in love with him but has her own disgusting little story to hide. Nearly every character has a dark side, the only truly 'good' one (Joy) seems to get everything wrong, and the one romance that blooms during the movie has a twinge of wrongness to it. The movie is a strung-together mosaic of perpetual sadness, the search for the remedy, and the stomach-churning causes of it all; and yet, between my gasps of shock and uneasiness, I can't say there's a boring moment in the film.The most difficult character in the movie to even look at is, obviously, Dr. Maplewood. Dylan Baker has that glaring gaze that could boil cheese, and it takes on an especially creepy tone when he's gazing longingly at his son's baseball teammate at a little league game. But, believe it or not, Solondz injects comedy even into something as despicable as the Maplewood situation. The film's most controversial scene, involving drugged chocolate sundaes and a tuna salad sandwich, is god-awfully wrong...but had me thinking about that great moment in Psycho when Marion Crane's car stops as it's sinking into the swamp and Norman Bates panics for a moment. And laughing, too. This element of the plot angered many people in 1998 and is still something to wrestle to this day; why make Maplewood a three-dimensional man with real emotions when all he is is a predatory pederast? Because it wouldn't be interesting, it wouldn't be watchable, if he wasn't. Take a climactic scene in the film, that must deal with the truths of Maplewood's actions: Solondz creates a scene that is brutally honest and deeply disturbing, but still grounded in the poignancy of a father-son discussion.I found myself alternating between pure puzzlement and a desire to turn the movie off in its first, love-it-or-leave-it act. But Solondz is in such control of his connecting plot strands that he makes the links quickly, moves in and out of them with ease, and even allows for unexpectedly moving moments to occur. The great subplot of the film is with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Camryn Manheim. In some ways, it sums up the entire theme of the film, while having all of Happiness' strengths and weaknesses. Solondz gives us a great scene where the two come together, dancing to a pop song in a bar, and it's a brief moment of euphoria and sweetness despite the depravity that surrounds and underscores it. Of course, for some viewers, the hidden lives of even Allen and Kristina may be too strange to merit caring about. I struggled with it, too.Solondz made a very good film a few years ago, Storytelling (rent it), that contains similarly risque subject matter but ends up being too facile in the resolutions of the two vignettes that comprise the film. His breakthrough movie, Welcome to the Dollhouse, came before Happiness, and takes a similarly piercing look at real life but is bogged down too much in its deadpan humor and relentless punishment of its protagonist. Happiness straddles the shortcomings of both of those films, neither offering a simple resolution to its problems or being too strange to the point where unrealism sets in. It is real, it is complex, and it's also deeply disturbing and maybe morally offensive. I'm also known for not really caring about the morality of a movie, so maybe that's why I was never bored or too offended at any time.The best line in Happiness comes toward the very end, when the sisters and their parents are sitting around talking about a grisly New Jersey murder, involving dismemberment and plastic baggies, that occurred in the apartment building of Flynn Boyle's Helen. ""Everyone uses baggies; that's why we can relate to this crime,"" she says. Happiness is one of those twisted American suburbia flicks that contains things that happen every day, probably closer to us than we expect. That's why I could relate to this movie. I don't expect you to; in fact, I don't blame you if you hate it with a passion or don't get past the first ten minutes. Things will happen that will disgust you, revolt you, and disturb you. There is no reason why anyone should like this movie or why it should 'work.' But I was entertained in some sick and twisted way, even while my jaw stayed glued to the floor. Don't say I didn't warn you, and extensively...but I dare you to see it.

In all, I watched it 3 parts, simply because I didn't have the time to watch it. I switched it off an hour into it originally, as I was in too much of a mood to 'enjoy' it if that's the right word. It is one of the most powerful films you'll see, but also one of the most shocking & depressing.You know you're in for a ride, when the film starts abruptly with a really harsh breakup (which I didn't need to see), and ends with a family moving out.The actors really throw themselves into their roles, especially the father (Dylan Baker) & son (Rufus Read). These scenes were the most uncomfortable I've ever had to watch in a film, as it deals heavily in paedophilia. I had to say, the dad & son discussing [...], and then their final scene, were handled brilliantly. It's an embarrassing subject at the best of times, but with the paedophilia hanging over the scenes, it will make you squirm. This subject might put people off the film, and I'll say, I thought it would be, but it's handled well, and most scenes are based on implication, rather than actually showing anything.Other issues the actors deal with are: divorce late on in life; a single 30-something female, who's largely ignored, and is part of the break up at the beginning of the film; sex with a student (was he really a student?); obscene phonecalls; and murder. Not a cheery film, and one you definitely have to psyche yourself up for, and be in the right mood. Be in the wrong mood and the movie will fail.This movie will stir up some really strange emotions in you, that when the credits roll, you won't be sure whether you'll love or hate it. I'm still torn. It's definitely not a film that will be going back in my DVD player anytime soon, but it will also stay with me for a good long while yet. I unfortunately saw a lot of myself in Jane Adams character, which has given me the heebies jeebies. That's the thing about the two films of Todd Solondz's films that I've seen - both times I've seen myself in one of the characters. (Welcome To The Dollhouse is the other.)I'm curious about seeing Palindromes now, Todd Solondz's latest movie, just to see how that turns out. Nothing will ever match Happiness or Welcome To The Dollhouse, as both films have effected me in a way that no other film ever will. And you'll never let a dog lick you in the face after seeing this film again. You'll be left with shivers going up your spine afterwards, and wandering what did happen at the end. Oh by the way, it ends abruptly.

Anybody who has seen 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' knows filmmaker Todd Solondz likes to explore the social boredom of alienated suburbanites and expose their darkest perversions hidden under a false outer shell. In this regard, 'Happiness' is no exception and definitely the pinnacle of Solondz' ""suburban pervert"" vision. The movie starts off with an argument in a restaurant between a man and a woman (Lovitz and Jane Adams) and takes a left down a fork in the road to the weird. It's like a train-wreck playing on repeat that you cannot stop watching. Controversial themes such as pedophilia, child-rape, voyeurism, loneliness, sexual harassment-via-phone, yadda ya...it's all here for you to feast your eyes on. Most of it is ugly.But let's be real here --- this film is brilliant! From the writing, acting, screenplay, musical score, its utterly magnificent. Yup, Solondz struck a lot of nerves with people on this one. What do we make of it? I'm not too sure. Maybe it's not a social commentary after all. Maybe it's just Solondz making one sick little flick that turned out to be superb.

A lot praised Happiness, but I find it to be boring, overlong and sometimes funny but who really cares. There's four stories here and in the end they connect with family members. The stories go like this....there's some guy, he looks depressed, he's fat and he likes to call women up on the phone, while he masterbates, yeah, may the force be with him...anyway and talk dirty to them adn then hang up and there's this girl who lives next door to him who wants to know who this guy is that keeps calling her and hanging up on her. Meanwhile, one of women who lives in the apartment tells the guy she killed the doorman, cut him up into pieces and she still has some of his remains in the fridge. 2nd story consists of a Father who has a loving wife and kids....his oldest son is having trouble trying to make the white gooey stuff come out and his Father says, ""when the right time comes, you'll come"" and his Father happens to be a pedophile and winds up being arrested for molesting his Son's friend and a kid at his Son's school....ok, with me so far? Ok the 3rd story consists of an old couple and the 4th one consits of a school teacher who falls madly in love with one of her russian students who happens to be a thief and he seduces her, they do it and he steals her guitar and anyway, that's what the movie has for you.  If your cup of tea is watching some guy try to get a boy to eat a sandwich and then molest him or closeup shots of semen hitting stuff and then a dog licking it up, then have at it but it isnt mine. Jane Adams (Anniversary Party) is my only interest and that's what made me watch it...from the first scene where she dumps Jon Lovitz (Little Nicky) and the rest of her story...she's the actress that kept me from turning the movie off and what kept it at a 2 star rating. Also starring Jared Harris (Igby Goes Down), Dylan Baker (Changing Lanes), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote), Lara Flynn Boyle (Where the Day Takes You), Camryn Manheim (Tv's The Practice), Ben Gazzara (Road House) and Molly Shannon (Superstar).

502909,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B00000IC7B,Mir,"[4, 6]","I'm not really sure what the writer/director wants us to take away. I rarely feel that way after a film. This, however, is a hard, hard, hard film to watch. Here it is in a nutshell: Interlocking stories of people who are deeply miserable or harboring secrets, who all want to connect and BE happy, but just can't seem to fit in. And maybe that's the point--that none of us fully fit our ideal of happiness, that happiness is just a moment here or there and that it passes and our dark human condition won't be covered up for long. I'm not so cynical as to think joy and happiness are impossible. (I'm pretty darn happy a good deal of the time despite the occasional blows of life) This film, however, makes you wonder if your own life is undermined by what's going on in the life of people around you. In this film, the clean-cut ""family guy"" is a pedophile who, bit by bit, loses control and takes his desires beyond fantasy/masturbation to reality/rape. The character who thinks she has a perfect life is living a lie and doesn't know it until her world crashes down on her. The older couple are splitting up, and the man has become numb, so lacking in true feeling that sex is meaningless and the act of salting his food becomes a supremely nihilistic statement. The hopeful, wounded waif keeps being rejected at every turn, becoming the scapegoat for the misery of those around her. Rejection in all forms abounds. Pain in hideous variety. Horrors in assorted flavors. And you can't look away thought something in you says, ""I shouldn't see this. Do I have to see this? I want to see something PRETTY RIGHT NOW, PLEASE!""Camryn Mannheim is oddly touching as a woman whose misery and isolation make her flip out at the moment of an unwanted and uninvited human connection. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays yet another misfit who can't make his life work. Jane Addams looks like a breeze could knock her over, she's so fragile. The pedophile makes you want to run criminal searches on all the adult males in your neighborhood who seem so ""nice, quiet, hard-working.""It's unrelenting.Watch this movie if you can empathize with an array of futile searches for happiness. Be prepared to be slapped in the face by the underbelly of several lives. I gave it four stars because it was masterfully done, not because I ""really liked it""--because this is not a film you can like. Why then? Because it was impossible for me to look away or to turn it off and not know how it ended. Because I kept hoping for some ray of light to shine on these damaged people. If you think you're brave enough, see this.

502911,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B00000IC7B,mrliteral,"[1, 9]","While watching this generally well-made film, I could not help but keep wondering why it was even made.  Happiness evokes anything but that emotion.Happiness is what I think of as an unfunny comedy.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, it just means that it has few - if any - ha ha ha moments.  Instead, it is just the generally the absurdity of the world depicted that makes it amusing.  In a certain way, the world of this movie is funny, but it is generally just bleak and disturbing.  Not a single scene lacks unpleasantness and often the viewer is even more uncomfortable than the characters.Nonethless, like a car crash, you cannot look away from this tale of three sisters each undergoing problems in their lives.  One sister, played by Jane Adams, is the most likable, but is also is such a willing victim to life that she is often unsympathetic.  Another sister is so intent on having an ideal life she is self-righteously smug, even as her child-molesting husband is about to bring ruin to her world.  The final sister is perhaps the only happy character in the entire film, primarily because she is so shallow and self-centered.  Add to this mix the story of their parents splitting up and a pathetic obscene phone caller and you have a disjointed and disturbing film.Even if a viewer disagrees with my assessment about the unpleasantness of this movie, few can dispute that there is just too much going on.  There are at least four stories going on, all virtually separate from each other, and just when you get interested in one plot line, it disappears for twenty minutes and you practically forget about it.  Everything ties together to a limited extent at the end of the movie, but it's too little, too late.  Nonetheless, this is still a (weak) three star movie, based on the generally good acting and writing, despite the unhappy nature of the story.  It is the feel-bad movie of the 90's.",3,Why?,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1909,"['watching', 'generally', 'well-made', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'keep', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'Happiness', 'anything', 'emotion.Happiness', 'what', 'think', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'few', 'ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'moments', 'Instead', 'just', 'generally', 'absurdity', 'world', 'depicted', 'amusing', 'certain', 'way', 'world', 'movie', 'funny', 'generally', 'just', 'bleak', 'disturbing', 'Not', 'single', 'scene', 'unpleasantness', 'often', 'viewer', 'even', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'characters.Nonethless', 'car', 'crash', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'tale', 'three', 'sisters', 'undergoing', 'problems', 'lives', 'One', 'sister', 'played', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'most', 'likable', 'also', 'such', 'willing', 'victim', 'life', 'often', 'unsympathetic', 'sister', 'so', 'intent', 'having', 'ideal', 'life', 'self-righteously', 'smug', 'even', 'child-molesting', 'husband', 'bring', 'ruin', 'world', 'final', 'sister', 'perhaps', 'only', 'happy', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'primarily', 'so', 'shallow', 'self-centered', 'Add', 'mix', 'story', 'parents', 'splitting', 'up', 'pathetic', 'obscene', 'phone', 'caller', 'have', 'disjointed', 'disturbing', 'film.Even', 'viewer', 'assessment', 'unpleasantness', 'movie', 'few', 'can', 'dispute', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'are', 'least', 'four', 'stories', 'going', 'virtually', 'separate', 'other', 'just', 'when', 'get', 'interested', 'one', 'plot', 'line', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'practically', 'forget', 'Everything', 'ties', 'together', 'limited', 'extent', 'end', 'movie', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Nonetheless', 'still', 'weak', 'three', 'star', 'movie', 'based', 'generally', 'good', 'acting', 'writing', 'unhappy', 'nature', 'story', 'feel-bad', 'movie', '90']",N/A

What is it about this movie that makes it 'Top 10 Worthy'?  As the credits continue to roll, I still can't answer the question.I can honestly say that I've never been more uncomfortable watching a movie.  Scene after scene you think to yourself, 'Okay, this can't get any more taboo, right?'  And then, all of a sudden, you see a father (who is a therapist, played by Dylan Baker) talking to his son about ""coming"" (the son is depressed because he hasn't ever had an orgasm, but allhis friends at school say that they have). One of the more uncomfortable scenes is when the father is talking to the son, ""Have you ever played with yourself"" ""Yes, well no, not really"".  ""Do you want me to show you?""  ""No (thank god). That's okay.""The theme of the movie is about three sisters who have parents who are very unhappy with each other.  The mother is afraid of of becoming a divorcee, while the father is looking for feelings of any kind for anything.  The three daughters meanwhile each have there own problems.  The opening scene shows one of them at dinner with a man who kills himself the next day (Jon Lovitz, who got top billing, but in his only scene here, is really more of a cameo).Next we move on to PSH's character who is rambling to a therapist (yep, same one as mentioned above) about a girl that he is in ""love"" with (yep, one of those daughters).  He's affraid to tell her his feelings, or for that matter, even talk to her.  Hoffman gets his kicks by making crank calls, hoping a woman answers on the other end, and hoping they don't hang up before he finishes pleasuring himself.  In one lucky scene, we get to watch PSH make one of these calls, and the scene closes with Hoffman wiping his semen off the wall.  The therapist, mind you, (you guessed it,  is also married to one of the ""three"") is trying to give the appearance of a normal life. But, in his spare time, we find him jerking off to Teen Beat magazines inthe back of his car (the male variety is the only that interest him), drugging his kids friends so he can fondle and rape them, dreaming about shooting strangers in a park and talking to his son about mastubation.  I wanted to hate this character so much. But there is so much confusion around him, and you know that he realizes that he has a disease.  He just is scared to face the music. These two men (Baker and Hoffman) are by far the most compelling characters.The last unmentioned daughter is an aspiring author, who can't find a subject to write about.  She gets angry that she was never raped, because she thinks that would be a perfect topic to write about.  She's tired of everyone wanting to be with her and be like her.  But she imposes upon herself to keep the family running.You would think that the above are all negatives about the movie.  But truthfully, it is an 'intersting' movie.  At times it feels like there is way too much going on, and you wish that the writer and director of the film would have focused more on portions of the story instead of opening so many cans of worms.  But should some of the scenes been taken out.  No.  But while watching you'll wish they would have.  Somehow it comes together to give the viewer a somewhat satisfied feeling.  Maybe it will take repeated viewings to understand what is really going on in this movie.  After just one viewing, it's impossible to know it all.  Between cringing at the uncomfortable scenes, black, dry and dark humor is abundant.  This carries the film and keeps the viewer wondering what else is next.Did I mention the russian cab driver who loves New Jersey? How about the tenant who gets raped by the doorman and then kills him, cuts him up and throws him away little bits at a time in little baggies?This DVD was unrated for obvious reasons.  Although there isn't any male, or child nudity, we do see a sex scene (with exposed female breast) and numerous scenes with implied male masturbation (one with a child) Everything in this film seems very foreign to watch as a movie.  We read (too many times) about these things happening in the newspaper, and think to ourselves 'That's too bad'.  But for someone to make a film about these things. Wow.  What do we take away from this?  Well, it could be said that everybody has problems.  Apperance on the outside isn't necessarily what is really going on. Most of these actors seem to be 'tolerating' there lives, rather than trying to make them better.But really, what makes this movie good (if anything)?  Again, I think it's too soon to say for me if this is a good movie.  I think the story line that is anything but routine for Hollywood is fun to watch.  It's fresh and different. To see these actors play out on the screen some of the most uncomfortable topics is great to watch.Do I recommend this film?  Certainly.  But only to the most open minded people.  Not for the conservative.  I don't regret watching this movie, and I will most certainly watch it again.  I think a film like this deserves at least two or more viewings so it can be appreciated what these actors did, and in hopes that we can make sense of these unfortunate lives.",4,Taboo + Interesting =

502914,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00000IC7B,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[0, 1]","Never before has a film addressed ""coming of age"" quite so literally.This is a dark, dark comedy: the sort of thing that might emanate from the deepest circle of the hell of Woody Allen's nightmares. The titular happiness, in case you were wondering, is colossally ironic. This is a story of loosely related individuals - more loosely related than you'd expect given most relations are of the blood or marital sort - all of whom are profoundly at odds with themselves and their environment. Much of their collected oddness manifests itself in sexual dysfunction of one sort or another, but of a far deeper and sicker kind than is commonly found in Woody Allen's material. Indeed, by comparison Allen's neuroticism seems positively winsome.These people are deeply, darkly, fatally neurotic: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who seems to revel in these kinds of parts, an overweight, greasy, bespectacled misogynist who has unspeakable fantasies, fantasies which he nonetheless brazenly speaks about, to his shrink and to his victims, through inept crank calls. His shrink Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) is a paedophile. Maplewood is married to Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) a woman whose hi-tensile smugness betrays a fundamental insecurity about her place in the world. Trish doesn't know of, but we suspect she may fear for, her husband's ghastly proclivities. Trish has two sisters who, in turn, field Allen's crank calls, and seem to enjoy them. The sisters' parents, holed up in a Florida condo, see their Marriage as a loveless contractual bind.In the middle of it all is a teenaged boy, Timmy (Justin Elvin), Trish and Bill's son, who is fruitlessly willing on the onset of his own puberty, providing his father a running commentary. His father darkly enjoys.Could the set-up be any more neurotic?The narrative gradually displaces itself from early focus on Allen towards the Bill, at which point whatever tacky residue of humour the film had retained is jettisoned and we are let into the paedophile's modus operandi. From there, for thirty minutes, Happiness is unrelentingly grim. Relief comes in the form of the travails of the third sister Joy (Jane Adams), a chronically frustrated spinster, who has stumbled into the arms of a Russian taxi driver (Jared Harris), whom we are invited to like for his uncluttered and direct approach to life, but who also turns out to be a monstrous pig.The film has as its climax a harrowing exchange between Timmy and his father, now exposed as a paedophile, in which Timmy interrogates Bill about his sexual proclivities and his father answers him calmly and directly. It really is a striking sequence, but as with much of the film, it is thoroughly contrived.These characters are archetypes we recognise as being profoundly American. Had the film been located anywhere else, the screenplay could would have seemed utterly implausible: you just can't imagine Europeans, let alone anyone else, being this self-involved.Black humour returns at a stroke in the final scene, in a scene which will have you bent over in mirth or nausea depending on your, well, taste for such things. It seems a little bit of a cheap shot, though that's clearly not how Timmy will have felt about it.Olly Buxton",3,A literal take on coming of age,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,3222,"['Never', 'before', 'film', 'addressed', 'coming', 'age', 'quite', 'literally.This', 'dark', 'dark', 'comedy', 'sort', 'thing', 'might', 'emanate', 'deepest', 'circle', 'hell', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'nightmares', 'titular', 'happiness', 'case', 'were', 'wondering', 'colossally', 'ironic', 'story', 'loosely', 'related', 'individuals', 'more', 'loosely', 'related', ""'d"", 'expect', 'given', 'most', 'relations', 'are', 'blood', 'marital', 'sort', 'whom', 'are', 'profoundly', 'odds', 'environment', 'Much', 'collected', 'oddness', 'manifests', 'sexual', 'dysfunction', 'one', 'sort', 'far', 'deeper', 'sicker', 'kind', 'commonly', 'found', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'material', 'Indeed', 'comparison', 'Allen', 'neuroticism', 'positively', 'winsome.These', 'people', 'are', 'deeply', 'darkly', 'fatally', 'neurotic', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'revel', 'kinds', 'parts', 'overweight', 'greasy', 'bespectacled', 'misogynist', 'who', 'unspeakable', 'fantasies', 'fantasies', 'nonetheless', 'brazenly', 'about', 'shrink', 'victims', 'inept', 'crank', 'calls', 'shrink', 'Bill', 'Maplewood', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'paedophile', 'Maplewood', 'married', 'Trish', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'woman', 'hi-tensile', 'smugness', 'fundamental', 'insecurity', 'place', 'world', 'Trish', ""n't"", 'know', 'suspect', 'may', 'fear', 'husband', 'ghastly', 'proclivities', 'Trish', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'turn', 'field', 'Allen', 'crank', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'sisters', 'parents', 'holed', 'up', 'Florida', 'condo', 'see', 'Marriage', 'loveless', 'contractual', 'bind.In', 'middle', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'Timmy', 'Justin', 'Elvin', 'Trish', 'Bill', 'son', 'who', 'fruitlessly', 'willing', 'onset', 'own', 'puberty', 'providing', 'father', 'running', 'commentary', 'father', 'darkly', 'enjoys.Could', 'set-up', 'be', 'more', 'neurotic', 'narrative', 'gradually', 'displaces', 'early', 'focus', 'Allen', 'Bill', 'point', 'tacky', 'residue', 'film', 'had', 'retained', 'jettisoned', 'are', 'let', 'paedophile', 'modus', 'operandi', 'there', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Happiness', 'unrelentingly', 'grim', 'Relief', 'form', 'travails', 'third', 'sister', 'Joy', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'chronically', 'frustrated', 'spinster', 'who', 'stumbled', 'arms', 'Russian', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'whom', 'are', 'invited', 'like', 'uncluttered', 'direct', 'approach', 'life', 'who', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'monstrous', 'pig.The', 'film', 'climax', 'harrowing', 'exchange', 'Timmy', 'father', 'now', 'exposed', 'paedophile', 'Timmy', 'Bill', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'father', 'answers', 'calmly', 'directly', 'really', 'striking', 'sequence', 'much', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'contrived.These', 'characters', 'are', 'recognise', 'being', 'profoundly', 'American', 'Had', 'film', 'been', 'located', 'anywhere', 'else', 'screenplay', 'could', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'utterly', 'implausible', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Europeans', 'let', 'alone', 'anyone', 'else', 'being', 'self-involved.Black', 'humour', 'returns', 'stroke', 'final', 'scene', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'bent', 'mirth', 'nausea', 'depending', 'well', 'taste', 'such', 'things', 'little', 'bit', 'cheap', 'shot', 'clearly', 'not', 'how', 'Timmy', 'will', 'have', 'felt', 'it.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

The film comes with warnings all over the cover. People got up and left the cinema. People tried to boycott it and wanted to see it banned. It is an assault on morals. It is the darkest of dramas. It is only funny because a smile is all you can do to deal with what you are witnessing. It is nauseating. It is completely taboo. You do not want to tell people you saw this. You do not want to watch it with your girlfriend. You do not want to recommend it. You would feel excruciatingly embarrassed to watch this with your parents. You can not comprehend why anyone would want to make it. You feel that the actors have gone too far. You never want to see anything like it again. However, inside, deep down, you know that what you have seen is nothing short of the horrific truth about some people. You know that your parents could very well be like this. You know that your girlfriend or boyfriend may have some secrets like this. You know that your friends could well be involved in some of the topics conveyed in this film. You know all too well that the media reports on it 24/7. You know that PEOPLE DO THESE THINGS! But it is taboo, taboo and it is not you! Never you! How could you ever do such a thing or even think such things.... But there in the darkness of your soul is something that is not a hundred miles away from the topics that this darkest of film expounds on. The human condition and its western syndrome are all too capable of what is on display here.The fact remains that millions of people have experienced first-hand much of themes that this film covers. It is not something that does not happen. It does and they do. The media talk about non-stop. Any tabloid magazine is full of it. The telephone services have to deal with it - so do the police and social services. People even make money out of these things. It is terrible, awful, disgusting - but real.What most people fail to realize is that this film is all about the mentally ill who have very deep-seeded psychological problems that they can not cope with, without some help. These people can be found in any walk of life. As on display in ""Happiness"" those who suffer from these diseases of the mind are in fact everyday Joe-soaps and some with important jobs or are even authority figures. It is this angle that makes it all the more real and upsetting. It is this upper-class take on the whole problem that shows that no matter who you are, you too can suffer from these problems. Too long has this material been only played out in the hands of the seedy ""villains"" or underground freaks. Too long has cinema devoted these themes to prisoners and baddies and the elements of society who most of us never engage in.

And they do some awfully uncomfortable things.The actors are all outstanding.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a loser (what a stretch!!) who starts making obscene phone calls to his next door neighbor (Lara Flynn Boyle), who enjoys them.  What happens when they meet?  That's just one sample of the kind of interactions you might see in this movie.  It plays a little like MAGNOLIA, but without much of the hopeful tone that movie ends with.But the source of all the controversy in this movie is the character played by the brave, brilliant Dylan Baker. He plays a totally milquetoast, average, middle-class father.  Yet his character is also a child-molester.  I wouldn't say his character is presented sympathetically, but he isn't always shown as just a monster either.  There's one scene, wherein his son has just discovered his beloved father's secret and questions him in detail about his twisted desires.  The scene is hands-down the most uncomfortable thing I've ever watched.  I was literally squirming...it is so shocking, so obscene and so terribly, terribly sad.  In two minutes, we see how several lives are shattered forever.Baker's performance should have been nominated for an Oscar, but this would have required too much bravery on the part of the selection commmittee.Do I recommend the film?  Well, if you aren't afraid to have your limits tested, absolutely.  It has a lot to say, not just about child molestation.

I would say that Happiness is a film in a Robert Altman style but with  a very realistic touch. Altman's films are maybe less realistic because you  recognize those famous actors and that's exactly the feeling that I did not  have while watching Happiness. The film is very realistic and authentic to  me, the way the actors mold their character and the way they relate to the  others is superb and very non-selfish from an actor's point of view. What I  am trying to say here, is that this is one of those rare films in which you  can see people playing other people without noticing it's all worked out in  a script. I'd like to mention David Lynch's masterwork, 'the Straight  story', in which Sissy Spacek plays this stuttering daughter in a way that  can only be described as heartbreaking realistic and very heartwarming at  the same time. Some of the characters in Happiness did the same to me and  that makes me say that this movie is a must-see. Although every viewer  should be warned that there are some shocking moments and images, but they  are all in place where they belong if you can take it. It is a movie about  ordinary people living their ordinary, sometimes average life, and the way  they are connected to eachother. Sometimes not knowing that they are  connected, or will be connected at a certain moment in time, maybe in a  certain place or brought together by people they both know. In this way,  Happiness has some parallels with Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts', but  Happiness stands out as a shocking, sometimes even funny but very present  day in-depth look into people and their lives.

502925,A6FIAB28IS79,B00000IC7B,Samuel Chell,"[9, 16]","Eventually I had to see this controversial, cultish film, which I had been told by various parties was distasteful, full of hilarity, socially relevant.  Indeed, it's all three--a dark comedy that occupies a midway place between ""Deliverance"" and ""Something About Mary.""  Unfortunately, the shocking scenes don't have sufficient justification to illuminate life and the comedy doesn't entertain sufficiently to justify the frequently deviant subject matter.  (I laughed heartily at the opening scene with Jon Lovitz, but thereafter the film provokes primarily the kind of nervous laughter that serves as a defense against embarrassment).The narrative is engaging but in a way that lacks, on the one hand, the verisimilitude of a Robert Altman movie and, on the other, the depth of Woody Allen (in his Ingmar Bergman mode).  And if the intent is to do a parody of soap opera, ""Guiding Light"" is way beyond ""Happiness"" both in its intricate, multiple plotting and its resonant, complex characterizations.  By comparison, ""Happiness"" is shallow, juvenile, and cynical--a film that, whatever its intentions, is without much insight or heart.  I found myself responding to some of its questionable choices (masturbation and pedophiliac scenes)  as I did to Kenneth Starr's obsession with throwing in our faces each and every lurid detail of Clinton's affair with Monica.  Who needs it?Stolondz obviously (far ""too"" obviously) wants to make a case for empathy and compassion for society's outcasts.  He fails to make that case.  Fritz Lang's brilliant ""M"" (1930) is far more successful both in exposing the common dominator of ""original sin"" and in eliciting compassion for a serial child killer who, like Dr. Maplewood, ""can't help himself.""  By contrast ""Happiness,"" in its climactic father-son talk, offers little more than masturbation as a metaphor for the redirection of antisocial impulses.What ""saves"" the film, if anything, is the acting.  Each of the three sisters is sharply individualized, thanks less to the script than absolutely ""on key"" performances that somehow transcend the caricaturist  dialogue.  There's Lara Flynn (as a worldly prima-donna writer), Cynthia Stevenson (as a ""necessarily"" happy married yuppie who ""has it all"") and, above all, Jane Adams (as the youngest, relentlessly victimized sister).  Also, Dylan Baker, as the psychiatrist-pedophile, strikes just the right balance between a serenely successful professional and a neurotic and clumsy, middle-aged  ritard.  Finally, it's always rewarding to see Ben Gazarra back on the screen.  His appearance alone generally insures that something of value can be salvaged from an otherwise questionable if not time-wasting scenario.(Postscript: I'll have to admit that a ""dramatic"" film that manages to hit home with many young people and that provokes good writing such as that in the ""Spotlight Review,"" may have more going for it than I'm able or willing to see.  I certainly don't mean to dismiss the film because of the subject matter, however repellant.

502927,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B00000IC7B,Scrimshaw,"[1, 2]","Happiness is a 1998 dark comedy film written and directed by Todd Solondz. It stars Cynthia Stevenson, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Jane Adams as the three Jordan sisters Trish, Helen, and Joy, respectively, as well as Dylan Baker as Trish's husband Bill, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Helen's creepy neighbor Allen. This film reminded me a lot of a similar film which coincidentally also starred Philip Seymour Hoffman called Magnolia, a Paul Thomas Anderson film which was released a year later. Both films feature ensemble casts which are all related/connected in some way, and also feature thoroughly miserable, depraved, angry, and unlikable characters. Happiness at times felt like it was going for pure shock value, or rather, that it was trying to hard to be shocking and controversial. It seems as if the director Todd Solondz, who is also responsible for a much better, but still dark film which I enjoyed called Welcome to the Dollhouse, simply went out of his way to be as dark, vulgar, and offensive as possible, for no reason other than to be shocking. He didn't seem like he was trying to make any profound messages or insights into the reality of damaged characters like the ones in this film. I guess the closest theme one can take from this film is that even people and places that outwardly seem happy and idyllic can in reality but incredibly tragic and well, unhappy, for want of a better word. Bill Maplewood, who's probably the most messed up character in the film, outwardly seems like a relatively pleasant, if not a tad boring, man, but in reality he's a very sick, twisted pedophile who suffers from deranged fantasies and compulsions.While it is true that there are people like this, a few notable serial killers are proof enough, I still feel that this film, although certainly funny at times, was an empty, black abyss of pain and suffering that would have been much better if it had more light and less darkness, it seems that there are far too many films, books, and TV shows that instead of trying to be simply entertaining, or intelligent, insightful looks into the human condition, instead go for the easy route out and be as dark and offensive as possible with little to no redeeming social merit. This film gets three stars because although I didn't particularly like it, I did sympathize with some of the characters, particularly Joy, and while I certainly felt guilty doing it, I did laugh alot. At the end of the day, this film is still a comedy, and it succeeded in doing what it set out to do.",3,The Black Abyss,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2528,"['Happiness', '1998', 'dark', 'comedy', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'three', 'Jordan', 'sisters', 'Trish', 'Helen', 'Joy', 'respectively', 'as', 'well', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Trish', 'husband', 'Bill', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Helen', 'creepy', 'neighbor', 'Allen', 'film', 'reminded', 'lot', 'similar', 'film', 'coincidentally', 'also', 'starred', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'called', 'Magnolia', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'later', 'films', 'feature', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'are', 'related/connected', 'way', 'also', 'feature', 'thoroughly', 'miserable', 'depraved', 'angry', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'Happiness', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'pure', 'shock', 'value', 'rather', 'was', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'shocking', 'controversial', 'director', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'who', 'also', 'responsible', 'much', 'better', 'still', 'dark', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'called', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'simply', 'went', 'way', 'be', 'dark', 'vulgar', 'offensive', 'possible', 'reason', 'other', 'be', 'shocking', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'profound', 'messages', 'insights', 'reality', 'damaged', 'characters', 'ones', 'film', 'guess', 'closest', 'theme', 'one', 'can', 'take', 'film', 'even', 'people', 'places', 'outwardly', 'seem', 'happy', 'idyllic', 'can', 'reality', 'incredibly', 'tragic', 'well', 'unhappy', 'want', 'better', 'word', 'Bill', 'Maplewood', 'who', 'probably', 'most', 'messed', 'up', 'character', 'film', 'outwardly', 'relatively', 'pleasant', 'not', 'tad', 'boring', 'man', 'reality', 'very', 'sick', 'twisted', 'pedophile', 'who', 'deranged', 'fantasies', 'compulsions.While', 'true', 'are', 'people', 'few', 'notable', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'proof', 'enough', 'still', 'feel', 'film', 'certainly', 'times', 'was', 'empty', 'black', 'abyss', 'pain', 'suffering', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'light', 'less', 'darkness', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'books', 'TV', 'shows', 'instead', 'trying', 'be', 'simply', 'entertaining', 'intelligent', 'insightful', 'human', 'condition', 'instead', 'go', 'easy', 'route', 'be', 'dark', 'offensive', 'possible', 'little', 'redeeming', 'social', 'merit', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'did', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Joy', 'certainly', 'felt', 'guilty', 'doing', 'did', 'laugh', 'alot', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'still', 'comedy', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do']",N/A
502928,AVN00ASBFTMN6,B00000IC7B,Smoking Ace,"[3, 5]","Just 10 minutes after seeing Todd Solondz's Happiness, I am in shock at how much I loved this film. Happiness is perverted, dark, and pessimistic but it is also an insightful allegory on human nature. All of these characters are dispicable, except Joy, but there is something in them that we can relate to: and that is the need to be happy. No matter how deeply  wretched a desire might be, it is still a desire just like your's and mine, and at the end of the day all we want to do is to gain happiness by fufilling them. Reviewers who say this film isn't honest are completly dense, if anything this film is too  honest. There are some scenes here, the father/son conversation near the end especially, that are so open that I cringed. The acting from the entire cast was incredible and Dylan Baker's performance here asserts that he is one of the most underrated (and unsettling!)actors working today. In the end I found the most impressive feat of Happiness to be Solondz's balancing act in tone. He walks this whole film on a thin line between comedy and complete depravity and succeeds. While most will call the Bill Maplewood thread of the film disgusting, I found  it miraculous how Solondz managed to make a pedophile somewhat empathetic and three dimensional. The audience is supposed to hate this man, but why do we hold are breath when we feel his crimes have been found out? (The reviewer who made the psycho comparision said it all). Happiness is not a film for everyone, only for those who can see through the dark tunnel of perversions and find the existential truths at the end of it. The sex is raw, the people are mean, the acts are heinous, but the main desire is our own: and that is to be happy.  See Happiness, I effing loved it.

I've seen a few Solondz films, and they're pretty twisted on their own terms, but this was flat out sick. It's as if Solondz solely set out to shock, disturb, and disgust...but you know, there are people like this out in the world, and these situations need to be dealt with and confronted. This film is merely a window into a part of our world that is pitch black, a world filled with characters who are all looking for happiness, yet find none. They're all going around in circles. With all of that being said, I can tell you that now that I've seen this film, I have no desire to see it again. It's going to be hard for me to recommend this to anyone, especially any of my friends, but if I had to recommend it at all, it would be for the sheer power of the film, the emotions that it pulls out of you, and last but not least, the performances. Every one of them is superb. Dylan Baker has the toughest role as a seemingly perfect father of three who just happens to be a pedophile on the side. He is a monster, yet Solondz never lets us forget that he is sick and wrestling with some pretty serious demons. It was hard for me to sympathize with this character, and I'm sure that many will understand why.The rest of the characters are just as conflicted, except for maybe one...a character named Joy. She's a bright shining light in this film, and you keep watching, wondering if she'll ever find the true happiness that she is both looking for and deserves.I give the film three stars because at times, as I mentioned before, it seems as though Solondz just wants to rub your face in ugliness for the sake of it. There were times when I was infuriated because of that, but for the most part, like the films ""Blue Velvet"" and ""American Beauty"", the film is an expose of the darker side of suburbia.And I will not be watching this one again any time soon!

The movie really makes you think and I felt a little bit sad and disgusted after I saw it, but it is really good. The movie really makes you think about what goes on behind the nice faade. I would really recommend you to see this movie!",4,Very interesting,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,445,"['very', 'interesting', 'tragic', 'movie', 'family', 'get', 'follow', 'three', 'sisters', 'different', 'lives', 'movie', 'American', 'Beauty', 'acting', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'movie', 'really', 'think', 'felt', 'little', 'bit', 'sad', 'disgusted', 'saw', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'think', 'what', 'nice', 'faade', 'would', 'really', 'recommend', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

502938,A3B6FJBIQS1TD2,B00000IC7B,Zac R Cocciolo,"[2, 10]","At my university, there are quite a few people who call this ""the meanest movie ever"" as a great compliment. Well, it is the meanest movie ever but that is far from a good thing; the film is so misanthropic that it just becomes silly. Solondz's attitude toward the characters feels almost like he's just bullying them, making them be at their worst 100% of the time, building entire characters just around ""dark little secrets"", and making just about every male character who isn't suicidal or a child a rapist (not kidding). However it is paced all right, but is completely average visually. The music, when not by the film's composer, is great sometimes (Thanks, Todd, I never would have found that Vivaldi concerto otherwise!), but the film's score is so painfully ironic. Happy music under overbearingly sad or morally questionable things, sad music under normal things. The acting is sometimes good. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jane Adams are the only ones who are at all interesting; everyone else is an annoying ridiculous caricature. People call this film ""real"" but that's far from true, it is exactly a zany mainstream comedy, just played more serious, with worse people (people are not that horrible in real life). Put Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler or whoever in this instead of Hoffman and Dylan Baker and it could be a full-on-comedy. If this movie was a highschooler it would wear all black and listen to My Chemical Romance constantly.",1,"If you hate people so much, Todd, why make a movie at all?",1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,1448,"['university', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'call', 'meanest', 'movie', 'ever', 'great', 'compliment', 'Well', 'meanest', 'movie', 'ever', 'far', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'misanthropic', 'just', 'silly', 'Solondz', 'attitude', 'characters', 'feels', 'almost', 'just', 'bullying', 'making', 'be', 'worst', '100', '%', 'time', 'building', 'entire', 'characters', 'just', 'dark', 'little', 'secrets', 'making', 'just', 'male', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'suicidal', 'child', 'rapist', 'not', 'kidding', 'However', 'paced', 'right', 'completely', 'average', 'visually', 'music', 'when', 'not', 'film', 'composer', 'great', 'sometimes', 'Thanks', 'Todd', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'Vivaldi', 'concerto', 'otherwise', 'film', 'score', 'so', 'painfully', 'ironic', 'Happy', 'music', 'overbearingly', 'sad', 'morally', 'questionable', 'things', 'sad', 'music', 'normal', 'things', 'acting', 'sometimes', 'good', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'interesting', 'everyone', 'else', 'annoying', 'ridiculous', 'caricature', 'People', 'call', 'film', 'real', 'far', 'true', 'exactly', 'zany', 'mainstream', 'comedy', 'just', 'played', 'more', 'serious', 'worse', 'people', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'horrible', 'real', 'life', 'Put', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'whoever', 'instead', 'Hoffman', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'could', 'be', 'full-on-comedy', 'movie', 'was', 'highschooler', 'would', 'wear', 'black', 'listen', 'My', 'Chemical', 'Romance', 'constantly']",N/A
