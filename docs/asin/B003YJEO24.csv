She is an excellent instructor---motivating without being cutesy, easy to follow, always a great workout.This DVD is a mess---the video quality is so poor, I can't believe the company issued this DVD and that Amazon sells it.  I watched for about 10 minutes and was dizzy.  The DVD is constantly going out of focus and every minute or so there is a flash of light.  At first I thought there was a thunderstorm outside, but the weather was calm.  I switched TV's and DVD players, but got the same result.I will be returning it.",1,Who produced this DVD?,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,597,"['have', '6', '7', 'Prevention/Chris', 'Freytag', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'instructor', '-motivating', 'being', 'cutesy', 'easy', 'follow', 'always', 'great', 'workout.This', 'DVD', 'mess', '-the', 'video', 'quality', 'so', 'poor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'company', 'issued', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'watched', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'dizzy', 'DVD', 'constantly', 'going', 'focus', 'minute', 'so', 'flash', 'light', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'thunderstorm', 'weather', 'was', 'calm', 'switched', 'TV', 'DVD', 'players', 'got', 'same', 'result.I', 'will', 'be', 'returning']",10 Pound Slimdown
1376372,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B003YJEO24,Amazon Customer,"[12, 12]","Every one of these 20 minute chapters (except the Yoga) is a circuit workout that alternates cardio & weights. It gets a lot done in a short time. I'm a big fan of Chris, she is so pleasant and knowledgable to work out with. I really like these workouts but had to modify it to my needs. For example, while doing bent-over flies, she mentions how challenging the 2 lb weights are. Well, I have been lifting weights for over 25 years and I have to use 12 to 15 lbs there. Basically, if you go as heavy as you can handle this is a fantastic workout.Now to the technical part: the DVD is chaptered but doesn't let you select one at a time. The only option that works is 'Play All', however, it lets me skip forward to get from one chapter to the next, so if I only want to do the last two workouts for example, I have to skip through a few times to get there which works ok, but is definitely a flaw considering the price of this DVD. I bought it from Amazon and not Exercise TV which is now out of business (as of Feb 2012 - I'm editing my original review).Additionally, there is now a follow-up set out by Chris: 10 Pound Slimdown Xtreme which consists of 3 DVDs, one with 40 minute workouts (xtreme), one with 20 minute workouts (recovery) and one with 10 minute workouts (bonus). This set is very expensive and is currently only sold by QVC. The workouts are great but I want to give you a ""heads-up"" on a couple of things: the 20 minute recovery workouts are the exact same ones as on this orignal Slimdown DVD. I think this is deceiving and I felt ripped off. Second, the packaging is cardboard and there is a good chance you get them scratched and scuffed. As a result some of the chapters froze up and jumped back to the main menu in the middle of the workout. Cleaning the disc didn't help either. Aside from that, all DVDs were chaptered and let me select each workout individually. But I definitely wanted to mention that one of the DVDs is the same as this one.",4,Great Circuit Interval Training&lt;>Production Flaw,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1970,"['one', '20', 'minute', 'chapters', 'Yoga', 'circuit', 'workout', 'cardio', 'weights', 'lot', 'done', 'short', 'time', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Chris', 'so', 'pleasant', 'knowledgable', 'work', 'out', 'really', 'workouts', 'had', 'modify', 'needs', 'example', 'doing', 'bent-over', 'flies', 'how', 'challenging', '2', 'lb', 'weights', 'are', 'Well', 'have', 'been', 'lifting', 'weights', '25', 'years', 'have', 'use', '12', '15', 'lbs', 'there', 'Basically', 'go', 'as', 'heavy', 'can', 'handle', 'fantastic', 'workout.Now', 'technical', 'part', 'DVD', 'chaptered', ""n't"", 'let', 'select', 'one', 'time', 'only', 'option', ""'Play"", 'All', 'however', 'skip', 'forward', 'get', 'one', 'chapter', 'next', 'only', 'want', 'do', 'last', 'two', 'workouts', 'example', 'have', 'skip', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'there', 'ok', 'definitely', 'flaw', 'considering', 'price', 'DVD', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'not', 'Exercise', 'TV', 'now', 'business', 'Feb', '2012', ""'m"", 'editing', 'original', 'review', '.Additionally', 'now', 'follow-up', 'set', 'out', 'Chris', '10', 'Pound', 'Slimdown', 'Xtreme', '3', 'DVDs', 'one', '40', 'minute', 'workouts', 'xtreme', 'one', '20', 'minute', 'workouts', 'recovery', 'one', '10', 'minute', 'workouts', 'bonus', 'set', 'very', 'expensive', 'currently', 'only', 'sold', 'QVC', 'workouts', 'are', 'great', 'want', 'give', 'heads-up', 'couple', 'things', '20', 'minute', 'recovery', 'are', 'exact', 'same', 'ones', 'orignal', 'Slimdown', 'DVD', 'think', 'deceiving', 'felt', 'ripped', 'off', 'Second', 'packaging', 'cardboard', 'good', 'chance', 'get', 'scratched', 'scuffed', 'result', 'chapters', 'froze', 'up', 'jumped', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'middle', 'workout', 'Cleaning', 'disc', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'Aside', 'DVDs', 'were', 'chaptered', 'let', 'select', 'workout', 'individually', 'definitely', 'wanted', 'mention', 'one', 'DVDs', 'same', 'one']",10 Pound Slimdown
