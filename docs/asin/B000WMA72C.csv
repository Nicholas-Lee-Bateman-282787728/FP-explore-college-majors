Hey, two and a half years? I think this number is a coincidence with the series title...maybe this was made on purpose!In a time where TV seasons - even the least successful ones - are released on DVD within six months or less from its finales, letting ""Two and a Half Men"" be out of the DVD market for such a long time was, at least, an odd attitude. Even more oddly is to figure that some other countries (like England) have already this set for sale for a while.From the 24 episodes of this second season (which occasionally still airs on CW), there is no one of them I could call a lame one.

I've owned this now for a little while, watched the whole season through, and watched it again.  I love it as it's one of the best tv comedy shows out there.  There are 24 episodes on these disks and this is the way they pan out.1 - BACK OFF MARY POPPINS - Charlie's male support group includes lots of Hollywood celebrities like Sean Penn and Elvis Costello - but not Alan.2 - ENJOY THOSE GARLIC BALLS - Alan is jealous that Judith has a new beau ... and delighted that he may be off the hook for alamony.3 - A BAG FULL OF JAWEA - Teacher's Pet.  Trying to be a good uncle, Charlie romances the teacher who threatened to suspend Jake.4 - GO GET MOMMY'S BRA - What is Evelyn's bra doing in the back seat of Charlies car?  The answer is ... uh...unnerving.5 - BAD NEWS FROM THE CLINIC? - Charlies falls for a female verson of himself.  And man, does she make him look miserable.6 - THE PRICE OF HEALTHY GUMS IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE - Is Alan a Jekyll and Hyde?  A childhood shoplifting story has him convinced there's a ""bad Alan"" inside.7 - A KOSHER SLAUGHTERHOUSE OUT IN FONTANA - Charlie and Alan's party for Evelyn turns into an affair to remember... for al the wrong reasons.8 - FRANKENSTEIN AND THE HORNY VILLAGERS - Confusing love and lust, Alan promptly proposes when he dates a woman who's sexually adventurous.9 - YES, MONSIGNOR - Charlie's old flame Lisa has everything: beauty, wit, intelligence, charm ... and a brand-new baby.10- THE SALMON UNDER MY SWEATER - Right 'toon, wrong tune.  Jake hates Charlie's theme song for the TV version of his favourite comice book.11- LAST CHANCE TO SEE THOSE TATTOOS - What a tangled worldwide web we weave.  Charlie discovers he's the subject of an unflattering website.12- A LUNGFUL OF ALAN - A homely girl Charlie and Alan knew in high school visits - and the boys are in for a surprise.13 - ZEJDZ Z MOICH WLOSOW (GET OFF MY HAIR) - First an earthquake, then a real disaster: With her house quake damaged, Judith moves into Charlie's beach pad.14- THOSE BIG PINK THINGS WITH COCONUT - Aland tells Evelyn she's no longer welcome at the house.  But his mother is, as always, a step ahead of him.15- SMELL THE UMBRELLA STAND - Vegas, baby!  Charlie's attempts to leave for Las Vegas keep coming up snake eyes.16- CAN YOU EAT HUMAN FLESH WITH WOODEN TEETH? - Faced with a sudden IRS audit, Alan needs someone reliable to take care of Jake.  Someone like ... Charlie?17- WOO-HOO, A HERNIA EXAM! - Back attack.  When Charlie injures his back, he refuses chiropractic help from Alan.18- IT WAS ""MAME,"" MOM - Charlie wants to make a good impression at a gay ad exec's party.  So he asks Alan to be his 'date'.19- A LOW GUTTURAL TONGUE-FLAPPING NOISE - Second best?  Alan is attracted to a beautiful woman who once had a fling with Charlie.20- I ALWAYS WANTED A SHAVED MONKEY - Angry at the women in their lives, Charlie and Alan do the mature thing.  They turn on each other.21- A SYMPATHETIC CROTCH TO CRY ON -  The death of Evelyn's second husband Harry, affects everyone in the family differently.22- THAT OLD HOSE BAG IS MY MOTHER -  He's traded his sould for a Porsche.  That's what Charlie thinks when Alan accepts a car loan from Evelyn.23- SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB, SQUAB - Bad parenting?  The guys are wracked with guilt after leaving Jake with Evelyn for an evening.24- DOES THIS SMELL FUNNY TO YOU? -Poetic license.  Jake's ""How I Spent My Weekend"" report differs somewhat from reality.This show is so hilarious.  Charlie Sheen does a fantastic job of delivering his lines with perfect comic timing and all the cast members are funny too.  Holland Taylor as Evelyn is one of the best, and this show doesn't slow down.  it's no wonder they're always nominated for awards.  I can't wait to see and own the third season.

1110485,AQFGSOIZXWRS7,B000WMA72C,Your Role Model,"[10, 33]","Honestly folks, save your cash. The show's definitely nothing special, unless you love the dull thud of jokes falling on their face, punctuated by the oddly sad beats of the always inappropriately amused laugh track. This is truly a 'comedy' for an easily amused, lowest-common-denominator type of audience. Any smart ppl that watch are doing so ironically (and shame on you for enjoying the train wreck).About the only thing the show has going for it is some servicable acting by the guy who plays the uptight brother (Jon Cryer), but even Cryer is hampered by the fact that is character is not likable in any way.  And worse (MUCH worse, actually) the Charlie Sheen character is a boat anchor around the neck of the proceedings.Sheen's acting range on the show consists of three facial expressions: blank, smirk, and 'Who, me?'. If Cryer's character is unlikeable, Sheen's alternates between being hate-able and utterly wooden. How this guy still gets work is beyond me... even in his big hit 'Wall Street', he displayed little emotional range, it was really Michael Douglas that made that movie.The writing on this show is no gem either, always the obvious and crass joke, every time. *You* could write 2.5 Men, and no doubt you could write it better than the show's staff does.Far as the DVD goes, you can put your money to far better use here on Amazon, trust me. 2.5 Men is as disposable as Charlie Sheen's sanity, and a glaring reminder (warning?) that, much like McDonald's restaurants or Britney Spear's music career, popular does not always = good.",1,"Just Your Typical, Unfunny, Boring, Laughtrack Sitcom",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1558,"['Honestly', 'folks', 'save', 'cash', 'show', 'definitely', 'nothing', 'special', 'love', 'dull', 'thud', 'jokes', 'falling', 'face', 'punctuated', 'oddly', 'sad', 'beats', 'always', 'inappropriately', 'amused', 'laugh', 'track', 'truly', ""'comedy"", 'easily', 'amused', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'type', 'audience', 'smart', 'ppl', 'watch', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'ironically', 'shame', 'enjoying', 'train', 'wreck', 'only', 'thing', 'show', 'going', 'servicable', 'acting', 'guy', 'who', 'uptight', 'brother', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'even', 'Cryer', 'hampered', 'fact', 'character', 'not', 'likable', 'way', 'worse', 'MUCH', 'worse', 'actually', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'character', 'boat', 'anchor', 'neck', 'proceedings.Sheen', 'acting', 'range', 'show', 'three', 'facial', 'expressions', 'blank', 'smirk', 'Cryer', 'character', 'unlikeable', 'Sheen', 'alternates', 'being', 'hate-able', 'utterly', 'wooden', 'How', 'guy', 'still', 'work', 'even', 'big', 'hit', 'Street', 'displayed', 'little', 'emotional', 'range', 'was', 'really', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'made', 'movie.The', 'writing', 'show', 'gem', 'either', 'always', 'obvious', 'crass', 'joke', 'time', '*You*', 'could', 'write', '2.5', 'Men', 'doubt', 'could', 'write', 'better', 'show', 'staff', 'does.Far', 'DVD', 'can', 'put', 'money', 'far', 'better', 'use', 'here', 'Amazon', 'trust', '2.5', 'Men', 'as', 'disposable', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'sanity', 'glaring', 'reminder', 'warning', 'much', 'McDonald', 'restaurants', 'Britney', 'Spear', 'music', 'career', 'popular', 'not', 'always', '=', 'good']",Two and a Half Men:S2 (DVD)
