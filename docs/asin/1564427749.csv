When the movie first played here I was enchanted as it took me back to remembering what I faced as an American woman representing my company in a country that slightly resented Americans and woman with control. It was a joy to remember and to realize how Australia has changed--forfiting some of its uniqueness as it mirrors all the developed countries. This is a wonderful story with excellent actors and expands Neville Shutes story so interestingly.,5,Understanding and loving Australia,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,602,"['lived', 'worked', 'Australia', '80', 'when', 'many', 'small', 'towns', 'visited', 'looked', 'exactly', 'town', 'depicted', 'mini-series', 'When', 'movie', 'first', 'played', 'here', 'was', 'enchanted', 'took', 'back', 'remembering', 'what', 'faced', 'American', 'woman', 'representing', 'company', 'country', 'slightly', 'resented', 'Americans', 'woman', 'control', 'was', 'joy', 'remember', 'realize', 'how', 'Australia', 'changed', 'forfiting', 'uniqueness', 'developed', 'countries', 'wonderful', 'story', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Neville', 'Shutes', 'story', 'so', 'interestingly']",N/A

183896,A2L2M2J3879ID8,1564427749,Doug Briggs,"[28, 29]","Maybe it's the distance from Hollywood that allowed the movie-making industry in Australia to grow up on its own feet, making movie after movie that smolders satisfyingly in our minds long after they are over. This one is as good as a movie needs to be.It was a lucky stroke that it was a Mobil Masterpiece Theater TV mini-series, for a film five hours long, however good, would not work in a theater. But it worked for me, and I hated to see it come to an end. The second viewing was even better.Nevil Shute, author of many fine stories, including ""On the Beach,"" would have been proud of this production so faithful to his epic story, and populated with Shute's own characters right down to the smallest detail. Every aspect of movie making shines here: a perfect and incredibly talented cast, fine direction, beautiful photography, splendid music. The dialog is exactly on the mark, and many a time an expression, a look, said everything without a word spoken.The story begins as the Japanese are overrunning Maylasia early in WWII. A British community is taken, the men sent to prison camps, the women sent to . . . They didn't have a place for women prisoners, so Jean Paget and the other fifteen or so women and several children are marched from one Japanese-held place to another. It seems that the officers at each one, not knowing what to do with women and children, passed the problem by sending them off to yet another place, afoot. After walking some 300 miles over perhaps a good part of a year, during which half the women and some children died, providence and Jean Paget's resourcefulness lead them to a ""home,"" an isolated village where they spend the remainder of the long war.The story continues after the war, leading to a truly heartwarming romance. Not to mention some providential intervention that makes the romance work wonderfully. Never does the drama get sticky. There is a nice balance of conflict, but never melodramatic overt conflict.The Aussies are renowned for the fine horses in their movies, always ridden with evident skill, and they didn't disappoint here. The airplane scenes I particularly enjoyed, for their adherence to the period and the way they were handled. The Twin Beech's first landing was a grease-job, making me wonder how many times they had to shoot it. That was answered by the next landing &#8211; not nearly so slick but nevertheless okay in spite of the bounce. We get to see the planes taxi in, where Hollywood would have shown the landing then cut to the opening door.Joe Harmon's beat-up old pickup &#8211; it may have been a Studebaker &#8211; made me smile. He always had to open the door with the outside handle, and it drooping at half mast.Sadly, I have not encountered a soul who has seen ""A Town Like Alice,"" before I introduced them to it. The accolades have created a waiting list and a one-week time limit on borrowers. Buy it, I know you will love it. And you'll bring enjoyment to those you lend it to. A word of caution: put a time limit on borrowers. Call them after a few days and nudge them into starting it. Otherwise, it may find a new home, as books and movies tend to do.DANGER! This is a three-tape package starring Helen Morse as Jean Padget and Bryan Brown as Joe Harmon. Don't fall for the video of the same title with a different illustration on the jacket. It's a 60-minute production by someone else. May not even be the same story.I wish ... would do a favor to the masses who enjoy truly good movies by putting this one on their feature page. It cries out for some exposure.",5,"The best movie, the sweetest story that nobody ever heard of",993168000,"06 22, 2001",2001,3563,"['Maybe', 'distance', 'Hollywood', 'allowed', 'movie-making', 'industry', 'Australia', 'grow', 'up', 'own', 'feet', 'making', 'movie', 'movie', 'smolders', 'satisfyingly', 'minds', 'long', 'are', 'over', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'be.It', 'was', 'lucky', 'stroke', 'was', 'Mobil', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'film', 'five', 'hours', 'long', 'however', 'good', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'theater', 'worked', 'hated', 'see', 'come', 'end', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'even', 'better.Nevil', 'Shute', 'author', 'many', 'fine', 'stories', 'including', 'Beach', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'production', 'so', 'faithful', 'epic', 'story', 'populated', 'Shute', 'own', 'characters', 'right', 'down', 'smallest', 'detail', 'aspect', 'movie', 'making', 'shines', 'here', 'perfect', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'cast', 'fine', 'direction', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'splendid', 'music', 'dialog', 'exactly', 'mark', 'many', 'time', 'expression', 'look', 'said', 'everything', 'word', 'spoken.The', 'story', 'Japanese', 'are', 'overrunning', 'Maylasia', 'early', 'WWII', 'British', 'community', 'taken', 'men', 'sent', 'prison', 'camps', 'women', 'sent', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'place', 'women', 'prisoners', 'Jean', 'Paget', 'other', 'fifteen', 'so', 'women', 'several', 'children', 'are', 'marched', 'one', 'Japanese-held', 'place', 'officers', 'one', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'women', 'children', 'passed', 'problem', 'sending', 'off', 'yet', 'place', 'afoot', 'walking', '300', 'miles', 'perhaps', 'good', 'part', 'year', 'women', 'children', 'died', 'providence', 'Jean', 'Paget', 'resourcefulness', 'lead', 'home', 'isolated', 'village', 'where', 'spend', 'remainder', 'long', 'war.The', 'story', 'war', 'leading', 'truly', 'heartwarming', 'romance', 'Not', 'mention', 'providential', 'intervention', 'romance', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'Never', 'drama', 'get', 'sticky', 'nice', 'balance', 'conflict', 'never', 'melodramatic', 'conflict.The', 'Aussies', 'are', 'renowned', 'fine', 'horses', 'movies', 'always', 'ridden', 'evident', 'skill', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'airplane', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'adherence', 'period', 'way', 'were', 'handled', 'Twin', 'Beech', 'first', 'landing', 'was', 'grease-job', 'making', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'shoot', 'was', 'answered', 'next', 'landing', '8211', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'slick', 'nevertheless', 'okay', 'spite', 'bounce', 'get', 'see', 'planes', 'taxi', 'where', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'landing', 'then', 'cut', 'opening', 'door.Joe', 'Harmon', 'beat-up', 'old', 'pickup', '8211', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Studebaker', '8211', 'made', 'smile', 'always', 'had', 'open', 'door', 'outside', 'handle', 'drooping', 'half', 'mast.Sadly', 'have', 'not', 'encountered', 'soul', 'who', 'seen', 'Town', 'Alice', 'introduced', 'accolades', 'have', 'created', 'waiting', 'list', 'one-week', 'time', 'limit', 'borrowers', 'Buy', 'know', 'will', 'love', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'enjoyment', 'lend', 'word', 'caution', 'put', 'time', 'limit', 'borrowers', 'Call', 'few', 'days', 'nudge', 'starting', 'Otherwise', 'may', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'books', 'movies', 'tend', 'do.DANGER', 'three-tape', 'package', 'starring', 'Helen', 'Morse', 'Jean', 'Padget', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Joe', 'Harmon', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'video', 'same', 'title', 'different', 'illustration', 'jacket', '60-minute', 'production', 'someone', 'else', 'May', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'same', 'story.I', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'favor', 'masses', 'who', 'enjoy', 'truly', 'good', 'movies', 'putting', 'one', 'feature', 'page', 'out', 'exposure']",N/A

Before winding up in the village, she, and other captive women and children, were forced to march from town to town by the Japanese, who did not know what to do with them.  They meet Joe Harmon, an Australian soldier, who steals food for them, and is crucified by the Japanese and left for dead.While in Malaya, she learns that Harmon survived, and goes to Australia to find him.  Meanwhile, Harmon, who had thought she was a married woman when they met in Malaya, had learned otherwise, and gone to England to seek her out.  They eventually meet up in Australia, and she determines to marry him and to make his town in the Outback into &quot;a town like Alice&quot;--a modern town, like Alice Springs.Wonderful performances by all, great scenery, very faithful to the book.  I should add that they added a bit of conflict near the end--Jean enters a bar, which is forbidden by the local mores, and Harmon rages at her and they nearly separate.  Unneeded, to my mind.

183904,A3TPSEI5YZO777,1564427749,Jane Beckwith,"[8, 9]","A friend mentioned this movie to me.  I had never heard of it, but was glad to be able to find it at my library.  After watching it and loving it, I was thrilled when I found a used VHS copy in a second hand shop.  This is one of those movies that can be pulled out and watched at least every year.  I first viewed it over the course of four evenings and each time, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen with Jean and Joe.  At the beginning of the movie, Jean is on the island of Malaya with her brother and a group of English workers.  The Japanese overtake the island and cart off the men, apparently to a work camp.  They force the women and children of the group to walk from place to place with accompanying soldiers.  We see the woman at times afraid, at times bold, on the verge of giving up, yet determined to keep on.  We see them sick, hungry and dirty.  We watch some of them die.  This is where the movie is the most engrossing.  The characters are well developed and I almost felt as if I was marching right along with them.  I came to love the character of Jean--she's smart and determined and also has a lot of compassion and a sense of humor.  One of the best parts of the movie is when this rag tag group of women and children meet up with two Australian prisoners of war.  There's an immediate attraction between Jean and one of the prisoners, Joe, and his energy infuses Jean with new life during the short time they are together.  After the war, Jean inherits a large amount of money.  She has never forgotten Joe and after much time and effort on both their parts, Joe and Jean get together again--this time in Australia.  Jean uses her determination and smarts to develops some businesses, all the while wondering if she can make it on the outback.

Some of the events are improbable but that is not necessarily a disadvantage if needed for the plot.The summary is that a group of English women, from the families of administrators of the local rubber plantations are taken captive by the Japanese and marched to and fro, no Japanese officer wishing to have to do with them(to be fair, they probably didn't have enough to keep their own army going). While they are in distress they meet an Australian POW, Joe Bonnock who helps them because of his attraction to Jeane Paget, one of the Englishwomen, by stealing from the Japanese. He is eventually caught and crucified. After the war, Jeane returns and comes into money. The first thing she does is go to Malaya to thank the villiage that helped her. Here she learns that Joe is still alive and so travels to the Australian Outback to meet Joe. While she is with mixed success becoming used to the local culture, Joe goes to England and meets Jeane's lawyer to find that Jeane has left. After a few weeks stay Joe returns home. Then he meets Jeane and they court in the Outback for several months. Finally they get married and live happily ever after.Much of the plot is trite and melodramatic. But the setting and the attractive and believable characters more then make up for it. Jeane's stuffy but kind lawyer, Noel also deserves mention as a sympathetic character who is attracted to Jeane(despite his age)but nonetheless helps her find Joe.The setting is some of the best parts of the movie. The jungles of Malaya is presented well, as is the Outback. The  movie can drag at times-it is 301 minutes.

And so does this whole movie, based on Nevil Shute's superb novel of the same name. It starts well, picks up speed, and gets better and better. During WWII, Jean (who is her family's only survivor) is force marched back and forth across Malaysia by the Japanese, who don't know what to do with a bunch of English women and children. As their group dwindles from starvation, fatigue, malaria and dystntery, Jean becomes the leader of the little group, and she negotiates a deal with the headman of a small village whose men have been taken off to fight in the war: if the village will shelter them, the surviving English will work in the rice fields.But it was during the months of wandering that Jean met Joe Harmon, an Austrailian prisoner of war who steals food for her, is crucified and left for dead by the Japanese.After the war, when Jean is back in England, she comes into her family's money, and she has a dream: to return to Malaya to build a well for the village women. To her amazement, she learns that Harmon actually survived: when the Japanese could not grant him his last wish, they were honor bound to save his life. Jean goes back to find him at the same time he, having just discovered that she wasn't married when he met her (a deception she fostered for her own protection), flies to England to look for her. The two planes cross.But, as with most good love stories, they meet - and things are awkward and stilted. When he knew her, her hair was loose and tangled, she was barefoot and wearing a sarong, and she had an orphan child balanced on her hip. Now when he sees her, she's an English lady - and he's still just a bloke from the outback.Oh, I'm telling too much. Suffice to say that Jean's attempt to resume their former easy and relaxed relationship while in Australia's Great Barrier Reef is spectacularly successful, and she's faced with spending the rest of her life in the desolate and lonely outback. Alice Springs, the nearest thing to `civilization,' is too far to go, so Jean determines to spend her small fortune turning her little nowhere town into a place from which the young people will no longer flee in frustration. In short, she creates the world in which she wants to live and raise Joe's and her children.It's so, so, so, so good, one of those videos you'll have to buy.

My friends and family have borrowed it over the years and it is a favorite of all to watch over and over.  It is markedly different from so many films that purport to be love stories.  The couple are separated before they can really get to know each other, but even years later, the man and the woman have never forgotten the initial attraction.  The fact that they even can connect again is a fluke, and then they must make the commitment that two people from opposite sides of the world can adjust to the other and build a life together in a primitive part of Australis.  The challenges of an ""in-charge"" man in a male-dominated society when he has to deal with a strong-minded woman, made even stronger because of her wartime experiences, is a triumph over obstacles.

183936,A16KH9DGUDMAQ2,1564427749,"V. Garlock ""Radical Feminist""","[5, 5]","I was first introduced to ""A Town Like Alice"" over a decade ago. I was only in the 8th grade when I saw it but I greatly enjoyed it. So much so that I kept getting it out of the library again and again. Finally, I had the common sense to get it on VHS.When I upgraded to dvd, I searched for this. Apparently, it is out of print. I emailed PBS to ask them if they planned to re-release it. (""A Town Like Alice"" was on the PBS series ""Masterpiece Theatre"" many moons ago.) They said they don't own the copyright and the best thing to do is to have someone copy my VHS tape to dvd.Well, that sucks! Whoever owns this film needs to release it on dvd. With bonus features! It is long overdue for a proper dvd release!For those who have not seen it, this miniseries follow the character of Jean during and after World War 2. It is based on the novel by Nevil Schute. Also of note: while the novel and miniseries are fiction, some of the events portrayed are based on fact.The miniseries begins years after World War has ended. Jean has come into an inheritance and wants to use it to give back to those who have helped her so long ago. She tells her story to her lawyer, who, in time, becomes a good friend.Jean and her brother are in Malaysia during World War 2. They are at an uppper-class resort with many other English families vacationing. However, before they can get out, the war reaches them. The men and women and children are separated into groups. The men are sent one way, the women and children another. The women and children are forced on a harrowing death march aross Malaysia.Jean, brought up an English lady, discovers her true character on these marches. Despite the circumstances, she is able to rally the women to keep hope. She becomes a caretaker and leader in her right.During the years of the march, Jean meets up with Joe, an upbeat and caring Aussie man. He sees the hardships the women are going through and risks his life to enable theirs to become more survivable.I will end my summary there as I don't want to give any plot spoilers for those who haven't seen this brilliant series yet. Lots more happens and it is very rewarding to watch. I also reccommend the book as a worthwhile read too.If you are wondering why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, it is because I have always felt the second half is too quickly wrapped up. We needed to spend a little more time with the characters and what is currently happening with them.If you enjoy ""A Town Like Alice,"" I also suggest ""Paradise Road"" as it deals with this aspect of World War 2 as well.",4,A masterpiece sorely in need of a dvd release,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,2569,"['was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Town', 'Alice', 'decade', 'ago', 'was', 'only', '8th', 'grade', 'when', 'saw', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'So', 'much', 'kept', 'getting', 'library', 'again', 'again', 'Finally', 'had', 'common', 'sense', 'get', 'VHS.When', 'upgraded', 'dvd', 'searched', 'Apparently', 'print', 'emailed', 'PBS', 'ask', 'planned', 're-release', 'Town', 'Alice', 'was', 'PBS', 'series', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'copyright', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'have', 'someone', 'copy', 'VHS', 'tape', 'dvd.Well', 'Whoever', 'film', 'release', 'dvd', 'bonus', 'features', 'long', 'overdue', 'proper', 'dvd', 'release', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'miniseries', 'follow', 'character', 'Jean', 'World', 'War', '2', 'based', 'novel', 'Nevil', 'Schute', 'Also', 'note', 'novel', 'miniseries', 'are', 'fiction', 'events', 'portrayed', 'are', 'based', 'fact.The', 'miniseries', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'ended', 'Jean', 'come', 'inheritance', 'use', 'give', 'back', 'who', 'have', 'helped', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'story', 'lawyer', 'who', 'time', 'good', 'friend.Jean', 'brother', 'are', 'Malaysia', 'World', 'War', '2', 'are', 'uppper-class', 'resort', 'many', 'other', 'English', 'families', 'vacationing', 'However', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'war', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'are', 'separated', 'groups', 'men', 'are', 'sent', 'one', 'way', 'women', 'children', 'women', 'children', 'are', 'forced', 'harrowing', 'death', 'march', 'Malaysia.Jean', 'brought', 'up', 'English', 'lady', 'true', 'character', 'marches', 'circumstances', 'able', 'rally', 'women', 'keep', 'hope', 'caretaker', 'leader', 'right.During', 'years', 'march', 'Jean', 'up', 'Joe', 'upbeat', 'caring', 'Aussie', 'man', 'hardships', 'women', 'are', 'going', 'risks', 'life', 'enable', 'theirs', 'become', 'more', 'survivable.I', 'will', 'end', 'summary', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'brilliant', 'series', 'yet', 'Lots', 'more', 'happens', 'very', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'also', 'reccommend', 'book', 'worthwhile', 'read', 'are', 'wondering', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'second', 'half', 'too', 'quickly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'needed', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'characters', 'what', 'currently', 'happening', 'them.If', 'enjoy', 'Town', 'Alice', 'also', 'suggest', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'aspect', 'World', 'War', '2', 'as', 'well']",N/A

There must be a reason it is not available in the USA. I would pay anything (already got pirated, poor copies) to watch on DVD. With all the amateur sleuths on Amazon, surely there is someone who can get to the solution and make a lot of people happy.I have tried everywhere to get A TOWN LIKE ALICE on DVD, I did get two pirated copies which were unwatchable from a site somehow illegally linked to Amazon, so be careful-you can't get hold of them after you send your money.
