I felt it was better than X-files and had a great ending (though the X-files ending did not do the story any justice at all).Some buyers may want to beware that the added bonus of the X-files episode of Millennium did not play at all on the two copies that I ended up getting.  At that point i decided it wasn't worth exchanging as I had the episode on my X-files season 7.Nonetheless, this show is awesome.  It may be my favorite of all time.

915628,A2JYEHX2FCZDE5,B0009X76XW,B. Bargh,"[3, 3]",This season was my favourite. Frank Black comes back to the FBI and a new Character FBI Agent Hollis is introduced. Agent Hollis character is very intelligent and out shines her dim colleagues. Hollis and Black work well together. Black holds the Millennium group responsible for his wifes death and through this season we see an evil side to the group. There is tension between the Watts and Black characters and the group persues Hollis as a new recruit towards the end of the season. This show was really cut in its prime i think of the X-Files as a show for kids and the Millennium was made for adults. Lets hope Chris Carter makes a Millennium movie soon while the original actors are around.,5,Millennium the Third Season,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,697,"['season', 'was', 'favourite', 'Frank', 'Black', 'back', 'FBI', 'new', 'Character', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Hollis', 'introduced', 'Agent', 'Hollis', 'character', 'very', 'intelligent', 'shines', 'dim', 'colleagues', 'Hollis', 'Black', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'Black', 'Millennium', 'group', 'responsible', 'wifes', 'death', 'season', 'see', 'evil', 'side', 'group', 'tension', 'Watts', 'Black', 'characters', 'group', 'Hollis', 'new', 'recruit', 'end', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'cut', 'prime', 'i', 'think', 'X-Files', 'show', 'kids', 'Millennium', 'was', 'made', 'adults', 'Lets', 'hope', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Millennium', 'movie', 'soon', 'original', 'actors', 'are', 'around']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season

I've been waiting a long time to complete my Chris Carter collection!  I'm not going to list a description of every episode, because I don't want to ruin everything for first-time viewers. ;-)Millennium underwent some drastic changes over its 3-year run; the first season, the Millennium Group seemed to be a legitimate criminal consultant firm, with interesting abilitiesm now employing ex-FBI agent Frank Black, who wants to raise his daughter in a safer world with his wife Catherine. Season 1 also introduced one of the darkest (and most underutilized) villains in the series; Lucy Butler, who could possibly be the devil. In the second season, Frank was smack-dab in the middle of it, seperated from his family as the Group became larger, darker, and more terrifying as its true knowledge and dangerous capabilities became known, leading to a viral outbreak in Seattle, which killed 80 people, including Catherine. Frank also encountered Lucy Butler, though she evaded him once again.In the 3rd season, Frank had left the Millennium Group and was back at the FBI, after recovering from the mental collapse he suffered from Catherine's death. He unofficially teamed up with Special Agent Emma Hollis, and they began attempting to bring Millennium to justice, which had become a distant, yet still dangerous villain. He also had one (maybe two; see Saturn Dreaming of Mercury and decide for yourself) more encounter with the evil Lucy Butler, who tried to tempt him into ruling the world with her (if that ain't the devil, what is?). We also got to see a lot more of his daughter Jordan in this season than the previous two, played by the gifted Brittany Tiplady, who I haven't seen in anything since a DELL computers commercial a few years back. The series ended with the apparent demise of Frank's onetime friend Peter Watts, and his taking his daughter and disappearing.Although Millennium's finale was reasonably conclusive, fans of the series, and Chris Carter himself, weren't quite satisfied with it, and made an episode which crossed Millennium with the X-Files, which took place on the Millennium Eve, Dec. 31, 1999 (and for those who say the new Millennium began in 2001, I quote Mulder: No one likes a math geek, Scully.), in which Frank Black teamed up with Mulder and Scully to save the world from ending. It seems they did!Millennium's 3rd season was the end of a great series, but I'm glad it ended where it did, instead of dragging through a 4th season which in all likelihood would've ruined it. Millennium had its full run, and ended successfully. Buy this season and complete the collection today!

Middleton,"[2, 2]","A die-hard fan of Millennium and a loyal viewer from the show's inception, like many others, discovering that the series came to an end after only three years, was a terrible disappointment. This unique series failed to reach a wider audience, however, managed to sustain a core following. This could be one reason the Fox Network cancelled it, nonetheless, most fans would agree, Millennium could have credibly continued for at least two more seasons.To compare each season is difficult, as each year had its own signature, the teams' writers taking the show in new directions. In season 1, Frank Black is a consultant for the Millennium Group, a vague organization with unlimited resources, aiding the FBI on their more bizarre and difficult cases. It is in this season that we see the utter insanity and evil that the human being is capable of. Frank Black's gift is the ability to enter the consciousness of evil, therefore making it less difficult to track the offender down and bring them to justice. Never the less, by the end of the first season, the series begins to turn in a strange direction, hinting at the supernatural, demonology, and the esoteric. It is also hinted that the Group is not exactly what it seems.Season 2 dives head long into the esoteric/occult, pushing the boundaries of this genre, which had never been seen portrayed to such extremes on mainstream television. My favourite episode would have to be ""Anamnesis"", expertly written by Erin Maher and Kay Reindl, and directed by John Peter Kousakis. This episode, well before the publication of ""The Da Vinci Code"", addresses the legend of Mary Magdalene and the Holy Bloodline of the Grail. A little girl and her friends have witnessed the manifestation of Mary in their local church and the whole town is up in arms, claiming demonic possession. The little girl quotes lines from Gnostic scripture (directly from the Gospel of Mary) and owns a statue of the mysterious Black Virgin. The season ends with a supposed pandemic, a contagious virus sweeping its way across the United States. Is this end of the world?Season 3 changes again, returning back to the original atmosphere of the show and the type of stories told. Frank Black no longer works for the Millennium Group; in fact he blames the group for creating the virus, which killed hundreds of people including his beloved wife. He is back with the FBI with a new partner, no longer investigating the occult but vicious serial killers and the Millennium Groups' involvement in major crimes and conspiracies to create Armageddon by the new millennium. Black is raging a one-man war against the Group as no one can see the connections between a multitude of strange deaths and unexplained events.Although the show blasted off in many directions throughout its three-year life, the character of Frank Black managed to maintain his integrity. Season's 1, 2 and 3 are all well crafted shows thoroughly researched with exciting and adeptly written scripts.The last episode, ""Good-Bye to All That"", almost wrapped the series up, but cleverly leaves a few unanswered questions, leaving it open for more...a possible feature film?

915633,A2BT578J4IZOK6,B0009X76XW,"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua""","[3, 6]","Created by Chris Carter, ""Millennium"" first appeared on television in 1996. It stars Lance Henriksen as Frank Black who, as a FBI Agent, specialised in profiling serial killers. After suffering a breakdown, Frank retired from the Bureau and moved from Washington to Seattle. To help with the bills, he joined a team of ex-law enforcement agents known as the ""Millennium Group"". Initially, this arrangement suited Frank perfectly. The Group would lend their expertise, as consultants, to whatever investigation requires their help. Naturally, given Frank's experience, the bulk of his work initially focussed on suspected serial killers. The focus of the show changed entirely, however, when Carter passed control of the show's second season to Glen Morgan and James Wong. Conspiracies appeared everywhere, while the Millennium Group suddenly became a devious, manipulative organisation - its role in fighting crime nothing more than a front. Season Two culminated in the death of Frank's wife, Catherine, from a disease developed and released by the Group.Carter thankfully returned for Season Three, allowing for the welcome departure of Morgan and Wong. However, there were certain elements of the second season that couldn't be ignored - most notably, Catherine's death and what the Millennium Group had become. As Season Three opens, Frank has severed his ties with the Group and has returned to the FBI as a consultant. Based at the FBI Academy in Quantico, he and Jordan have left Seattle and are now living in Fall's Church, Virginia. The transition hasn't been easy for the pair - Jordan still sets a place for Catherine at the dinner table, while its obvious Catherine's father blames Frank for her death. Frank has been attending sessions at the FBI Psychiatric Evaluation Office for five months and has made, it appears, significant progress. Although Frank's boss, Andy McClaren, is reluctant to assign him to cases, Frank is keen to return to work. McClaren is also very dubious about Frank's claims about the Group - he seems to believe they indicate, at best, a certain level of stress. In fact, McClaren in happy continue working with the Group in general and Peter Watts in particular.In addition to McClaren, Frank's new circumstances bring a couple of other new characters. The most notable is Agent Emma Hollis, played by Klea Scott, who becomes Frank's new sidekick. She's a very likeable character who's had more than her fair share of kicks in her personal life - unfortunately for Hollis, some of these kicks play key parts in some of the season's stronger episodes. Unlike some of the other support characters ""Millennium"" has had - particularly Lara Means - Hollis is definitely an asset. When we first meet Emma, she's partnering Barry Baldwin, an ambitious, smug and snotty individual who suffers from a definite superiority complex. He features only occasionally, but in the early episodes it's very enjoyable watching Frank pulling the rug form beneath his feet.While Carter's return to ""Millennium"" didn't see a complete return to what the show had been in Season One - nor could it have following Morgan and Wong' stewardship - Season Three is a drastic improvement on Season Two. Despite Frank's vow to bring the Group down, many of the episodes don't have a `Frank against the Group' theme. Some of the episodes are conspiracy-based, while others are plain, everyday, `normal' sort of crimes. Of the 22 episodes, there were only two I didn't really enjoy. ""...Thirteen Years Later"" was pretty poor - it was little more than a pastiche of the slasher movie, and was like something Morgan and Wong would've dreamt up. ""Omerta"" didn't do a great deal for me either - there was just too much Christmas cheer ! Some of the other episodes are excellent, though - some of the very best look into Emma's past. ""Human Essence"" sees Emma take a trip to Vancouver on family-related business, a trip that also threatens her career. The episode also sees some contributions from two other very well-known FBI Agents. Other episodes, like ""Collateral Damage"", give Peter Watts a chance to come out and play. (That episode also features James Marsters, who may be better known as Spike from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" - Marsters was one of several notable guest stars the season had to offer). ""Darwin's Eye"" was also excellent, though the season really saved its best for last with ""Via Dolarosa"" and ""Goodbye to All That"".Among the extras is a ""Making of Season Three"" documentary which, like the equivalent features on the previous seasons, is well worth watching. There were a couple of comments that I found slightly off-the-mark though. The decision to make the Millennium Group `evil' was essentially taken by Morgan and Wong in Season Two - remember what happened in that season's finale ? - and Frank's decision to leave the Group was really the most obvious thing to do. There was also a comment Lance Henriksen made about Frank and Peter Watts no longer being friends and, at times, there is clear friction between the two. However, looking at the last couple of episodes especially, it seemed to me that Watts bore Frank no real malice and the friendship may well have been alive on his part. If anything, the Group were a little more successful in manipulating Watts than they had been with Frank.Overall, Season Three was a strong finish for ""Millennium"" - the improvement over Season Two can't be exaggerated. However, I'm sorry the show had to finish at all. There is a sense that part of the story remains untold - I do have some questions about what happened between the last episode of Season Three and Frank's visit from Mulder and Scully. (There's a `bonus' episode of the X-Files, where Frank makes a guest appearance). If only someone from Fox would authorise a movie or - even better - Season Four...",4,Exits Stage Left - Anyone Want an Encore ?,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,5843,"['Created', 'Chris', 'Carter',

Seasons 1 and 2 are flat out amazing, each in a different way (See my reviews). Unfortunately, season 3 just doesn't measure up to the same level of excellence.Upon completing this experience, here are my observations:1) I think there should have been a season 4 and that the writers were in fact planning for one. The whole development of the Emma Hollis character would have made more sense and probably ended differently. Same for the Peter Watts character.2) There are still some very good episodes like Omerta, Collateral Damage, Antipas, Saturn Dreaming of Mercury and Bardo Thodol, amongst others. That's not the problem with season 3.3) The lack of a cohesive and focused story arc in season 3 is the problem. In this respect, the show seems off-kilter and Frank Black's purpose a bit less focused. I think Chris Carter, who returned as a creative presence for this season, just couldn't get a handle on where he wanted the show to go. He must have had a hard time justifying/expanding his vision of Millenium (from Season 1) with the reality of what it had become after season 2.Overall. I still love this TV series a lot.

The Millennium Group itself is still a lurking threat to Frank and its covert agenda comes to a head near the end of the season.Many viewers have stated that this season is weaker than the previous two and is simply a watered-down version of the X-Files.

If imitation is the highest form of flattery etc......then the Millenium TV series is one of the most highly regarded TV shows ever produced.Sadly, the series ended prematurely....or did it?  As a person who has viewed and studied every Millenium episode I make this observation:  The three year phenomenon called Millenium gave birth to a number of the most successful TV series ever conceived.  Shows about criminal profiling, crime scene investigation, missing persons, strange coincidences, secret societies, and psychic intuition regarding deeply dark deeds.Am I just an over zealous Millenium fan who sees the shows' influence everywhere I look?  In fact,IMO, the prescience of Millenium scripts goes way beyond current TV series and extends to movies as well.  You might think me completely over the edge when I also express the opinion that the writers and genius producer of Millenium also presaged a number of important and cataclysmic events in the world-dangers real, potential, and imagined that are on the minds of most of us today who bother to keep up with world events.The writing was simply inspired.  Of course, the acting, directing, locations, etc etc. are of uniformly high quality.  If, like me,  you love Vancouver BC, then you'll love the locations.Curious?

Carter was determined to do something that was *not* the X-Files.  Millenium was launched, and from the beginning it was hard to tell what, exactly, the series was about.Each of the three seasons has a distinct identity.  The first season is (mostly) an unremittingly grim serial-killer-of-the-week series, with people being set on fire, having their eyes sewn shut, and other atrocities.  The show survived because of the moral center provided by Frank Black, who has journeyed into the heart of evil and was almost consumed by it.  Retired from the FBI and recruited into the Millenium group, an association of former law enforcement officers, Frank is forced to protect his wife and daughter from the evil around them.Carter closely supervised the first season and was careful to avoid explicit references to the supernatural.  This was *not*, he repeated, *not* the X-Files.  But even in the first season, the producers couldn't refrain from introducing a fantastic element, although in very small doses.Many of the plots were incoherent and only partly explained; but we were used to this because of the X-Files.In the second season, Carter turned to series over to producers Morgan and Wong, who took the show in very interesting directions.  The Millenium Group is now revealed to be a conspiracy, itself divided by a struggle between religious and scientific camps.  Both fear a coming apocalypse in 2000 and are in fact working to bring it about.Just as the show was really becoming interesting, with a dramatic conclusion to Season 2, Carter returned to the show, unhappy with the direction Morgan and Wong had taken it.  Instead of picking up where Season 2 left off, Season 3 tosses out much of the continuity and starts over, with Frank Black now back at the FBI teamed with a female partner.  But oh no, it's *not* the X-Files!Season 3 is easily the worst season of this promising show.  My biggest complaint is that many episodes are simply incoherent.  Fantastic things happen, but nothing --- and I mean absolutely nothing --- is explained.  It's one giant McGuffin after another.  The style and flash are still there, but it's become a poor man's X-Files, without the fun and the humor.It's hard to say where Carter would have taken the show had it survived, but it's clear that he couldn't do what he'd sworn to do: create a show that was completely different from the X-Files.It's not surprising this show was cancelled; each season has a different identity, it's almost entirely lacking in humor, and it's dark, bloody, brooding, and grim.  However its high production values and excellent acting (especially from Lance Henriksen, as Frank Black) earned the show a devoted cult following.I bought Season 3 when it came out and still haven't watched the last four episodes.  With the Season 2 set, I watched the whole thing in one week.  That's how disappointing Season 3 is: you're set up for an intriguing mystery in 1 and 2; then Chris Carter comes back and says, ""Oh, never mind.  Let's just clone the X-Files.""It's a shame.  This show could have been so much better, if someone had ever decided once and for all what is was supposed to be about.",3,"Flashy, Stylish, but Incoherent",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,3263,"['Chris', 'Carter', 'wanted', 'prove', 'could', 'do', 'again', 'Fox', 'TV', 'was', 'hoping', 'cash', 'cow', 'Carter', 'was', 'determined', 'do', 'something', 'was', 'X-Files', 'Millenium', 'was', 'launched', 'beginning', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'exactly', 'series', 'was', 'about.Each', 'three', 'seasons', 'distinct', 'identity', 'first', 'season', 'mostly', 'unremittingly', 'grim', 'serial-killer-of-the-week', 'series', 'people', 'being', 'set', 'fire', 'having', 'eyes', 'sewn', 'shut', 'other', 'atrocities', 'show', 'survived', 'moral', 'center', 'provided', 'Frank', 'Black', 'who', 'journeyed', 'heart', 'evil', 'was', 'almost', 'consumed', 'Retired', 'FBI', 'recruited', 'Millenium', 'group', 'association', 'former', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'Frank', 'forced', 'protect', 'wife', 'daughter', 'evil', 'them.Carter', 'closely', 'supervised', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'careful', 'avoid', 'explicit', 'references', 'supernatural', 'was', '*not*', 'repeated', '*not*', 'X-Files', 'even', 'first', 'season', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'refrain', 'introducing', 'fantastic', 'element', 'very', 'small', 'doses.Many', 'plots', 'were', 'incoherent', 'only', 'partly', 'explained', 'were', 'used', 'X-Files.In', 'second', 'season', 'Carter', 'turned', 'series', 'producers', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'who', 'took', 'show', 'very', 'interesting', 'directions', 'Millenium', 'Group', 'now', 'revealed', 'be', 'conspiracy', 'divided', 'struggle', 'religious', 'scientific', 'camps', 'fear', 'coming', 'apocalypse', '2000', 'are', 'fact', 'working', 'bring', 'about.Just', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'becoming', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'Season', '2', 'Carter', 'returned', 'show', 'unhappy', 'direction', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'had', 'taken', 'Instead', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'Season', '2', 'left', 'off', 'Season', '3', 'out', 'much', 'continuity', 'over', 'Frank', 'Black', 'now', 'back', 'FBI', 'teamed', 'female', 'partner', 'oh', '*not*', 'X-Files', 'Season', '3', 'easily', 'worst', 'season', 'promising', 'show', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'simply', 'incoherent', 'Fantastic', 'things', 'happen', 'nothing', 'mean', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'explained', 'one', 'giant', 'McGuffin', 'style', 'flash', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'become', 'poor', 'man', 'X-Files', 'fun', 'humor.It', 'hard', 'say', 'where', 'Carter', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'show', 'had', 'survived', 'clear', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', ""'d"", 'sworn', 'do', 'create', 'show', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'X-Files.It', 'not', 'surprising', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'season', 'different', 'identity', 'almost', 'entirely', 'lacking', 'humor', 'dark', 'bloody', 'brooding', 'grim', 'However', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'acting', 'especially', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Frank', 'Black', 'earned', 'show', 'devoted', 'cult', 'following.I', 'bought', 'Season', '3', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'last', 'four', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'one', 'week', 'how', 'disappointing', 'Season', '3', ""'re"", 'set', 'up', 'intriguing', 'mystery', '1', '2', 'then', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'back', 'Oh', 'never', 'mind', 'Let', 'just', 'clone', 'X-Files', 'shame', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'someone', 'had', 'ever', 'decided', 'once', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season

It was a mildly interesting story of a downed airliner and bizarre blondes, seemingly involving the Millennium Group. That continued with ""EXEGESIS"", in which Frank and his new FBI partner Emma Hollis tried to determine the Group's involvement. ""TEOTWAWKI"" (aka The End of the World as We Know It) was a story of school violence and survivalists awaiting Y2K. ""CLOSURE"" involved Emma's sister's death at a young age and the connection with a seemingly motiveless killer.""...THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"" was an enjoyable Halloween story that somehow mixed murders patterned on 80s and 70s horror films, a performance by the band KISS, and the black comedy that the show tried to use in the second season. ""SKULL & BONES"" was the unusual story of buried bodies in Maine and the nebbishy young man who tried to escape the clutches of the Millennium Group. It showed what ""really"" happened to Cheryl Andrews (the great CCH Pounder), in case we weren't to believe last season's ""THE HAND OF ST. SEBASTIAN"".

""HUMAN ESSENCE"" was a lame attempt at X-Files-esque horror in which Emma's junkie half-sister faced mutation-causing drugs in Vancouver.""OMERTA"" (aka Holiday) was the infinately enjoyable Christmas episode in which a mobster resurfaces (from the dead?) after his healers, a couple of sweet sisters in the woods, are threatened. ""BORROWED TIME"" was the story of a series of drowning deaths that featured the return (in character, if not performance) of an angel from the first season! ""COLLATERAL DAMAGE"" was the story of Watts' daughter's kidnapping at the hands of a bitter ex-Gulf War soldier who blamed the Millennium Group. ""THE SOUND OF SNOW"" was the story of a series of recordings that seemed to cause deaths, leading Frank to face his wife Catherine's own demise.""ANTIPAS"" was the story of Lucy Butler being the nanny for a Wisconsin senator's daughter, leading Frank to try to prove her as the evil woman she is. ""MATRYOSHKA"" was the intriguing mix of the origins of the Millennium Group, the Atom Bomb and J. Edgar Hoover's creation of both. ""FORCING THE END"" was the interesting story of a pregnant woman's kidnapping by a Jewish cult. ""SATURN DREAMING OF MERCURY"" was the story of Jordan's unhealthy fascination with the new kid on the block, a seemingly evil little boy with supernatural powers.""DARWIN'S EYE"" was the great story of a young mental patient kidnapping and falling in love with a highway patrolman after her bloody escape. ""BARDO THODOL"" was an interesting tale of Millennium Group pseudoscience involving red bowls. ""SEVEN AND ONE"" introduced a new theme: Frank's fear of water and the haunting pictures of his own drowning! ""NOSTALGIA"" involved a murder in Emma's hometown.""VIA DOLOROSA"" was part one of what turned out to be a two-part series finale. It was the story of an Ed Cuffle-esque serial killer seemingly engineered by the Millennium Group. Frank investigates as Emma's ties to the Group deepen. ""GOODBYE TO ALL THAT"" was the bittersweet finale in which Frank and Jordan had to finally escape from the Group as Watts and Emma gave in to their inconceivable futures.The series continued, sort of, in a seventh season X-FILES episode, fittingly titled ""MillenniuM"". It was the story of Frank helping FBI agents Scully and Mulder investigate mysterious graverobbings that lead to the discovery of zombies being conjured by the Group's remaining member.The show is, all in all, a success, if not totally. It had its lame moments and HUMAN ESSENCE is an all-time low.

I can't watch anymore.  I think that was after the episode with the guy who burned a priest alive. I was disappointed because I really identified with Lance Henriksen's Frank Black character (wanting to protect my own wife and daughter from the evils of this world).Then I heard they were going to tone things down for Season 2, I became a Millennium junkie.  I revisited Season 1 and it seems they started backing off the gore just about the time I stopped watching.  I loved Season 2 and just couldn't see how Carter was going to pick up the pieces left behind by Morgan and Wong.  (see my Season 2 review).Season 3 is rather like a blend of Seasons 1 and 2. You get the straight ahead crime stories interspersed with more evil Millennium types and Peter Watts' soul searching about the nature of the group.  Klea Scott is a welcome addition to the cast and plays off Lance very well, especially in the season opener.  The Halloween episode featuring Kiss is hilarious.  The story line involves a movie production about one of Frank's cases.  Watch while the lead actor evolves from a Sonny Crockett type character (Miami Vice) into Frank Black.  The guy nails Henriksen's voice perfectly.  I nearly died laughing at this one, especially the final encounter between Frank and the actor portraying him for the movie in production.  That particular episode was nearly as good as Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense from Season 2 - one of the funniest hours of television ever.For those paying close attention, there is an espisode involving Agent Hollis' cousin and bad heroin (I forget the title) that has a bit of a collision with the X-Files universe.  There is a scene where Hollis is walking down the hallway of an apartment building in Vancouver and inside one of the apartments you can hear Scully talking to Mulder and, if I recall correctly, she even uses his name.  Of course later in the year, Frank Black turned up on an X-Files episode.  A bit odd that.Most of Season 3 brings you the same high-quality writing, acting, and cinematic direction and shooting as Seasons 1 & 2. By the time I got to disk 5 it seemed like this season was struggling to find its footing.  The stories are a little more hit-and-miss toward the end of the season though the performances and direction are still excellent. Millennium is quite simply one of the finest series in the history of American television.  If you have Seasons 1 & 2, then you have to go for Season 3.",5,An Ok Conclusion to This Most EXCELLENT Series,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2552,"['funny', '1/3', 'way', 'Season', '1', 'said', 'wife', 'just', 'too', 'grim', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'anymore', 'think', 'was', 'episode', 'guy', 'who', 'burned', 'priest', 'alive', 'was', 'disappointed', 'really', 'identified', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Frank', 'Black', 'character', 'wanting', 'protect', 'own', 'wife', 'daughter', 'evils', 'world', '.Then', 'heard', 'were', 'going', 'tone', 'things', 'down', 'Season', '2', 'became', 'Millennium', 'junkie', 'revisited', 'Season', '1', 'started', 'backing', 'off', 'gore', 'just', 'time', 'stopped', 'watching', 'loved', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'Carter', 'was', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'left', 'behind', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'see', 'Season', '2', 'review', '.Season', '3', 'rather', 'blend', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'get', 'straight', 'ahead', 'crime', 'stories', 'interspersed', 'more', 'evil', 'Millennium', 'types', 'Peter', 'Watts', 'soul', 'searching', 'nature', 'group', 'Klea', 'Scott', 'welcome', 'addition', 'cast', 'off', 'Lance', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'season', 'opener', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Kiss', 'hilarious', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'production', 'one', 'Frank', 'cases', 'Watch', 'lead', 'actor', 'evolves', 'Sonny', 'Crockett', 'type', 'character', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Frank', 'Black', 'guy', 'Henriksen', 'voice', 'perfectly', 'nearly', 'died', 'laughing', 'one', 'especially', 'final', 'encounter', 'Frank', 'actor', 'portraying', 'movie', 'production', 'particular', 'episode', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Jose', 'Chung', 'Doomsday', 'Defense', 'Season', '2', 'one', 'funniest', 'hours', 'television', 'ever.For', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'espisode', 'involving', 'Agent', 'Hollis', 'cousin', 'bad', 'heroin', 'forget', 'title', 'bit', 'collision', 'X-Files', 'universe', 'scene', 'where', 'Hollis', 'walking', 'down', 'hallway', 'apartment', 'building', 'Vancouver', 'one', 'apartments', 'can', 'hear', 'Scully', 'talking', 'Mulder', 'recall', 'correctly', 'even', 'name', 'course', 'later', 'year', 'Frank', 'Black', 'turned', 'up', 'X-Files', 'episode', 'bit', 'odd', 'that.Most', 'Season', '3', 'brings', 'same', 'high-quality', 'writing', 'acting', 'cinematic', 'direction', 'shooting', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'time', 'got', 'disk', '5', 'seemed', 'season', 'was', 'struggling', 'find', 'footing', 'stories', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'hit-and-miss', 'end', 'season', 'performances', 'direction', 'are', 'still', 'excellent', 'Millennium', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'finest', 'series', 'history', 'American', 'television', 'have', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'then', 'have', 'go', 'Season', '3']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season
915648,ATDBWYU6MJNQ3,B0009X76XW,"M Bardi ""med""","[4, 8]","Let me start by saying that Millennium is one of the best Tv shows in history, i enjoyed all three seasons, especially the unique and superior first season.I first heard of Millennium back in the 90s when it first aired on TV, but i never had the chance to see it, now years later and thanks to DVDs, i was able to watch the entire show on DVD uncut.All three seasons were good Tv material and very unique and distinguished from any other show being aired on Tv, very dark and gloomy with an amazing cast and plot twists.SEASON 1 :Season one was by far the best of the three seasons, and as we all know it started with Frank moving to Seatlle with his family and joining the Millennium group, invistigating dark murders and profiling serial killers.I enjoyed season one pretty much, and i was immediatley addicted to the show, and as one mentioned before that it was a show in which each episode was a shorter version of the movie seven ! however, it was even better !Lance Henrikson was great as Frank black, he palyed the role perfectly, so did Megan who played his wife Catherine, so acting was superb in the first season.The plot of each episode was so well organized and filled with surprises and twists. the atmosphere was also great, very darkish and depressing (in a good way).97% of the episodes were great and super,and only one or two episodes were sort of average.SEASON 2 :Going to season 2, for me it was less enjoyable than season 1, but still was pretty much entertaining, it took a wide turn and deviated from the killer of the week show of season 1 to a more of Frank's envolvement with the Millennium group, and was more of a religious type of show.For me i enjoyed the serial killers type of show of season one more than the religious show of S2.Another let back of S2, was the introduction of Lara Means, the psychologist who was paired with Frank, The thing is that it was'nt clear whats her role in the show was, and i just did'nt like the whole thing of her seeing Angels.However, S2 did have some good points, like Peter Watts character was more pronounced, more matured and more involved in the show.And one of the best things of S2 was the Holiday episodes ( The curse of frank black AND midnight of the century ) were very touching.35% of S2 episodes were super, 45% were average and 20% were sort of below average.SEASON 3 :the problem with season 3 is that it had no clear definition, no clear identity.I mean it wasn't like S2 and it wasn't like S1 either, it was like something in between, although alot more like S1.However, S3 was still pretty much enjoyable for the most part.It concentrated mainly on Frank's anger towards the group and him trying to expose them and of what they really are.Again Frank was paired with a new partner Agent Emma hollis played by Klea scot, Klea does a good job as Emma, however i wish if the role was casted for someone more fit and a little cuter ! :)Episodes were mostly average 65%. with only 20% being super and 15% bieng terrible.This season has one of the worst episodes in the show (Matryoshka and Bardo Thodol) just Terrible. others like (White noise, Darwin's eye and Nostalgia) were amongst the best.The two finalle episodes were also great, although they left us without closure.Overall :The show is just great and is worth all the time and the money for watching and enjoying it. So go ahead and Enjoy !Ratings :Season one 10\10season two 8\10season three 8.5\10Thanks",5,Millennium..A great show,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,3448,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'Millennium', 'one', 'best', 'Tv', 'shows', 'history', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'seasons', 'especially', 'unique', 'superior', 'first', 'season.I', 'first', 'heard', 'Millennium', 'back', '90s', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', 'i', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'now', 'years', 'later', 'thanks', 'DVDs', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'entire', 'show', 'DVD', 'uncut.All', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'good', 'Tv', 'material', 'very', 'unique', 'distinguished', 'other', 'show', 'being', 'aired', 'Tv', 'very', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'amazing', 'cast', 'plot', 'twists.SEASON', '1', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'three', 'seasons', 'know', 'started', 'Frank', 'moving', 'Seatlle', 'family', 'joining', 'Millennium', 'group', 'invistigating', 'dark', 'murders', 'profiling', 'serial', 'killers.I', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'i', 'was', 'immediatley', 'addicted', 'show', 'one', 'mentioned', 'was', 'show', 'episode', 'was', 'shorter', 'version', 'movie', 'seven', 'however', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'was', 'great', 'Frank', 'black', 'palyed', 'role', 'perfectly', 'so', 'did', 'Megan', 'who', 'played', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'first', 'season.The', 'plot', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'organized', 'filled', 'surprises', 'twists', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'very', 'darkish', 'depressing', 'good', 'way', '.97', '%', 'episodes', 'were', 'great', 'super', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'sort', 'average.SEASON', '2', 'Going', 'season', '2', 'was', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'season', '1', 'still', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'entertaining', 'took', 'wide', 'turn', 'deviated', 'killer', 'week', 'show', 'season', '1', 'more', 'Frank', 'envolvement', 'Millennium', 'group', 'was', 'more', 'religious', 'type', 'show.For', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'serial', 'killers', 'type', 'show', 'season', 'one', 'more', 'religious', 'show', 'S2.Another', 'let', 'back', 'S2', 'was', 'introduction', 'Lara', 'Means', 'psychologist', 'who', 'was', 'paired', 'Frank', 'thing', ""was'nt"", 'clear', 'role', 'show', 'was', 'i', 'just', ""did'nt"", 'whole', 'thing', 'seeing', 'Angels.However', 'S2', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'Peter', 'Watts', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'pronounced', 'more', 'matured', 'more', 'involved', 'show.And', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'S2', 'was', 'Holiday', 'episodes', 'curse', 'frank', 'black', 'AND', 'midnight', 'century', 'were', 'very', 'touching.35', '%', 'S2', 'episodes', 'were', 'super', '45', '%', 'were', 'average', '20', '%', 'were', 'sort', 'average.SEASON', '3', 'problem', 'season', '3', 'had', 'clear', 'definition', 'clear', 'identity.I', 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'like', 'S2', 'was', ""n't"", 'like', 'S1', 'was', 'something', 'alot', 'more', 'S1.However', 'S3', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'part.It', 'concentrated', 'mainly', 'Frank', 'anger', 'group', 'trying', 'expose', 'what', 'really', 'are.Again', 'Frank', 'was', 'paired', 'new', 'partner', 'Agent', 'Emma', 'hollis', 'played', 'Klea', 'scot', 'Klea', 'good', 'job', 'Emma', 'however', 'i', 'wish', 'role', 'was', 'casted', 'someone', 'more', 'fit', 'little', 'cuter', 'Episodes', 'were', 'mostly', 'average', '65', '%', 'only', '20', '%', 'being', 'super', '15', '%', 'bieng', 'terrible.This', 'season', 'one', 'worst', 'episodes', 'show', 'Matryoshka', 'Bardo', 'Thodol', 'just', 'Terrible', 'others', 'White', 'noise', 'Darwin', 'eye', 'Nostalgia', 'were', 'amongst', 'best.The', 'two', 'finalle', 'episodes', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'left', 'closure.Overall', 'show', 'just', 'great', 'worth', 'time', 'money', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'So', 'go', 'ahead', 'Enjoy', 'Ratings', 'Season', 'one', '10\\10season', 'two', '8\\10season', 'three', '8.5\\10Thanks']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season

This DVD includes extras, such as the 'making of season 3', that have chris carter's insights into HIS vision of where this series should go. Unfortunately, Millennium never developed more than a loyal cult following, and never saw the success of the x-files, but them again, it was never really given a chance.Overall, season 3 tries to tie together some of the aspects of season 2, but it distances itself from the Group mythology that Morgan and Wong developed in Season 2.

Lance is still great, but his new partner is boring and doesn't stand an acting chance playing opposite of the interesting Frank Black. There are only a couple of stand out episodes here and most are average at best. You should buy this set if you already have the first two, but those new to the show should stay away from Season 3.

However, if the first episodes I had started watching were all from season 3, I would never have made it to seasons 1 and 2.  I recently got this boxset and halfway through I'm dreading the remaining episodes.  One of the biggest problems is the Agent Hollis character.  She is quite the wet blanket and for a supposed FBI Special Agent for 5 years (you find out a bit of her history in one of the episodes off the first disc I think), she's awfully insecure, naive, and overly sensitive.  In the episode ""Closure"", the girlfriend of the killing spree guy says to Agent Hollis ""you're not cut out for this job""(or something similar) and she was dead on.  This season would have been much better if they could have written the Lara Means character back into the thread; at least Ms. ""Here's my thing..."" wasn't annoying every time she was on screen.Additionally, ""...THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"" gets the ""worst episode ever"" award.  I don't get it... a tongue-in-cheek holiday thriller episode used to explain the origins of Frank Black's breakdown 13 years prior?  Wow, what a horrible way to fill in a backdrop for a major point in the lead character's personal history and reason for leaving the FBI and working with the Millennium group.  I even like KISS and this still is the worst episode also because they succeeded in making it as annoying and boring as a typical made-for-teens predictable horror/slasher flick.And seriously, what's with the choice for the actor portraying Assistant Director Andy McClaren?  I think they hired a G. W. Bush impersonator for this guy.  I guess that's kinda realistic though, as a lot of people who you wouldn't expect to deserve it end up getting elevated to a position of being in charge of others.  The other reviewer who mentioned that dialogue between McClaren and Black is predictably the same is right, too.Season 1 was good and Season 2 is my absolute favorite.  Apparently a lot of critics and ""fans"" rejected the tone and direction of the stories in season 2, but I thought they were the most fascinating and balanced.  Instead of ultimately making a Millennium movie, I'd rather they just try to negotiate getting a couple more seasons of this show, and keep it in the vein of season 2.  The last X-Files movie was apparently a failure and I think a Millennium movie wouldn't be so great either, because it couldn't possibly wrap up all the things that made season 2 great into a neat little 2 hour package.",3,Season 3 is a let down,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,2529,"['did', ""n't"", 'start', 'watching', 'Millennium', 'was', 'already', 'fresh', 'reruns', 'However', 'first', 'episodes', 'had', 'started', 'watching', 'were', 'season', '3', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'made', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'recently', 'got', 'boxset', 'halfway', ""'m"", 'dreading', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Agent', 'Hollis', 'character', 'quite', 'wet', 'blanket', 'supposed', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', '5', 'years', 'find', 'out', 'bit', 'history', 'one', 'episodes', 'first', 'disc', 'think', 'awfully', 'insecure', 'naive', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'episode', 'Closure', 'girlfriend', 'killing', 'spree', 'guy', 'Agent', 'Hollis', ""'re"", 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'job', 'something', 'similar', 'was', 'dead', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'Lara', 'Means', 'character', 'back', 'thread', 'least', 'Ms.', 'Here', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'time', 'was', 'screen.Additionally', 'THIRTEEN', 'YEARS', 'LATER', 'worst', 'episode', 'ever', 'award', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'holiday', 'thriller', 'episode', 'used', 'explain', 'origins', 'Frank', 'Black', 'breakdown', '13', 'years', 'prior', 'Wow', 'what', 'horrible', 'way', 'fill', 'backdrop', 'major', 'point', 'lead', 'character', 'personal', 'history', 'reason', 'leaving', 'FBI', 'working', 'Millennium', 'group', 'even', 'KISS', 'still', 'worst', 'episode', 'also', 'succeeded', 'making', 'annoying', 'boring', 'typical', 'made-for-teens', 'predictable', 'horror/slasher', 'flick.And', 'seriously', 'what', 'choice', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Andy', 'McClaren', 'think', 'hired', 'G.', 'W.', 'Bush', 'impersonator', 'guy', 'guess', 'kinda', 'realistic', 'though', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'deserve', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'elevated', 'position', 'being', 'charge', 'others', 'other', 'reviewer', 'who', 'mentioned', 'dialogue', 'McClaren', 'Black', 'predictably', 'same', 'right', 'too.Season', '1', 'was', 'good', 'Season', '2', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Apparently', 'lot', 'critics', 'fans', 'rejected', 'tone', 'direction', 'stories', 'season', '2', 'thought', 'were', 'most', 'fascinating', 'balanced', 'Instead', 'ultimately', 'making', 'Millennium', 'movie', ""'d"", 'rather', 'just', 'try', 'negotiate', 'getting', 'couple', 'more', 'seasons', 'show', 'keep', 'vein', 'season', '2', 'last', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'was', 'apparently', 'failure', 'think', 'Millennium', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'great', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'wrap', 'up', 'things', 'made', 'season', '2', 'great', 'neat', 'little', '2', 'hour', 'package']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season

Durham ""Big Evil""","[8, 12]","The third, and sadly final, season of Chris Carter's Millennium finds Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) coping with life without his wife, and without the sinister Millennium group.  During the course of the season, Frank is more or less teamed up with FBI Special Agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) to bring the group to justice, while trying to care for his young daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady).  While season three is a step down compared to the excellent and visionary first two seasons, the third season of Millennium still proved to be one of the best shows of it's genrein years, thanks to the brilliant vision of Carter and his staff, and especially to the brilliant performances of Henriksen, which are the absolute best of his career.  The series ends with most of the loose ends tied up, but the fans, and especially Carter weren't completely satisfied.  Just before the year 2000 hit in the seventh season of Carter's X-Files, Henriksen reprised his role in a special crossover episode which sees Frank teaming up with Mulder and Scully to take on the Millennium group one last time.

What we basically have in season 3 is a hybrid of seasons  1 and 2, but it goes several steps further.The Amazon editorial comments are, i feel, once again wide of the mark. Makes me feel that they never watch the series, or even liked it. And it is A very good  set.The DVD is packaged well, with some good commentaries, good extras, and great quality Video and audio; plus some great insight into the academy group.Out of 22 ""official"" episodes, not counting the bonus X-FILES  season 7 episode which is included, the  first two are one story, as are the last two. Some commentary seems to downplay the first 8 episodes, and say that the season does not really start until the episode OMERTA, however, the double header that starts the series is great, with an excellent introduction to ""Emma"", and Klea is Superb in this role... the only other comparable actress in my view at the moment is Sanaa  Lathan ( starred in AVP).The commentary  by Lance and Klea on episode  one is very useful, and tells  a lot without revealing later details.Contrary to previous comments, the Nature of the MILLENNIUM group is NOT stated in Season two, but it is very clearly stated in this season, as is this nature of the relationship between Frank and Peter Watts.Lance's insights through thecommentary are very useful in understanding his take on the series, but it does not  interfere with the great  performances.The KISS Performance is a Halloween  show, and whilst it is more on a par with the Donut shop Demons  from Season 2, it still has a high quality.The SKULL AND BONES episode is, I feel, pivotal, since ""Emma""  gets to see things that Frank ""Knows.And the obvious hint at the ""society"" is rather intriguing.Overall, the development of the Mythology works well, with the hybrid of Season 1 and 2 producing some great Dark elements, and some superb work. The Denoument of the series, a double header, is brilliant, and places some elements in the darkest realms, with a ""checkmate or else"" type of feel.The Commentaries are good, except that the commentary for COLLATERAL is mostly  technical, and is effectively uselesswithin the context of the show... little enlightenment, and sounds like the commentary you have when not having acommentary. ""Lucy Butler"" as a character is taken to a whole new level ... very significant. Overall, I agree with Lance that Chris Carter is sitting on a Goldmine with the possibility of a MILLENNIUM film still very viable.",5,Excellent Finish for a High Quality  Series,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2819,"['Season', 'Three', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'season', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'quality', 'very', 'high', 'respect', 'say', 'special', 'features', 'disc', '6', 'about', '90', '%', 'current', 'movies', 'very', 'much', 'TV/cable.Chris', 'Carter', 'notes', 'was', 'left', 'different', 'creature', 'what', 'created', 'original', 'concept', 'MILLENNIUM', 'What', 'basically', 'have', 'season', '3', 'hybrid', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'several', 'steps', 'further.The', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'comments', 'are', 'i', 'feel', 'once', 'again', 'wide', 'mark', 'Makes', 'feel', 'never', 'watch', 'series', 'even', 'liked', 'very', 'good', 'set.The', 'DVD', 'packaged', 'well', 'good', 'commentaries', 'good', 'extras', 'great', 'quality', 'Video', 'audio', 'great', 'insight', 'academy', 'group.Out', '22', 'official', 'episodes', 'not', 'counting', 'bonus', 'X-FILES', 'season', '7', 'episode', 'included', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'one', 'story', 'are', 'last', 'two', 'commentary', 'downplay', 'first', '8', 'episodes', 'say', 'season', 'not', 'really', 'start', 'episode', 'OMERTA', 'however', 'double', 'header', 'series', 'great', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'Emma', 'Klea', 'Superb', 'role', 'only', 'other', 'comparable', 'actress', 'view', 'moment', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'starred', 'AVP', '.The', 'commentary', 'Lance', 'Klea', 'episode', 'one', 'very', 'useful', 'lot', 'revealing', 'later', 'details.Contrary', 'previous', 'comments', 'Nature', 'MILLENNIUM', 'group', 'NOT', 'stated', 'Season', 'two', 'very', 'clearly', 'stated', 'season', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Frank', 'Peter', 'Watts.Lance', 'insights', 'thecommentary', 'are', 'very', 'useful', 'understanding', 'take', 'series', 'not', 'interfere', 'great', 'performances.The', 'KISS', 'Performance', 'Halloween', 'show', 'whilst', 'more', 'par', 'Donut', 'shop', 'Demons', 'Season', '2', 'still', 'high', 'quality.The', 'SKULL', 'AND', 'BONES', 'episode', 'feel', 'pivotal', 'Emma', 'see', 'things', 'Frank', 'Knows.And', 'obvious', 'hint', 'society', 'rather', 'intriguing.Overall', 'development', 'Mythology', 'well', 'hybrid', 'Season', '1', '2', 'producing', 'great', 'Dark', 'elements', 'superb', 'work', 'Denoument', 'series', 'double', 'header', 'brilliant', 'elements', 'darkest', 'realms', 'checkmate', 'else', 'type', 'feel.The', 'Commentaries', 'are', 'good', 'commentary', 'COLLATERAL', 'mostly', 'technical', 'effectively', 'uselesswithin', 'context', 'show', 'little', 'enlightenment', 'commentary', 'have', 'when', 'not', 'having', 'acommentary', 'Lucy', 'Butler', 'character', 'taken', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'very', 'significant', 'Overall', 'agree', 'Lance', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'sitting', 'Goldmine', 'possibility', 'MILLENNIUM', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'viable']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season
915658,A3D7P8Q4SC1617,B0009X76XW,shadowdoc,"[10, 14]","The third season was evidently the most challenging season for the production team behind the series.  Executive producers Glen Morgan and James Wong that had helmed the second season had shifted the focus of the series from a dreary ""serial killer of the week"" format to a show focused on the spiritual and religious issues associated with the coming new millennium.  By far, the second season is a dramatic improvement over the first.  However, knowing the second season was to be their last association with the series,  in the two-part finale episodes, they basically started the apocalypse with the arrival of the Great Plague.Resuming his grip on the creative control of the series in the third season and with a new set of executive producers, Chris Carter decided that the show had not developed in the direction that he had envisioned when he conceived it.  He made a conscious decision to sweep away the religious iconography that had become characteristic of the series in the second season.  Coupled with that task, a major character (Frank Black's wife played by Megan Gallagher) had died as a result of the unleashed plague, and he had to figure out how to continue a show when the end-of-the-world had begun.Many people probably saw it coming, but the only way Chris Carter and his new creative team could continue Millennium for a third season was to downplay the events at the conclusion of the second season.  It turns out that it was not the Great Plague, and it apparently trickled out.  Not much exposition is given to this in the two-part opening episodes of the season (""The Innocents"" and ""Exegesis""), and as such many avid followers of the second season will feel an immediate disconnect.  The death of Frank Black's wife and the culmination of the events of the second season have led to Frank's (Lance Henriksen) decision to resign from the Millennium Group, who he is now certain have less than altruistic secret agendas.  He has returned to the Washington D.C. area to accept a position as consultant for the FBI behavioral sciences division, where he has been partnered with a young FBI agent, Emma Hollis (Klea Scott).  From this point, Frank continues to investigate high profile crimes without the Judeo-Christian influences of the Millennium Group.Early warning: the early episodes of the third season are, in my opinion, rather bland.  This not to say that the stories are weak (though, ""Closure"" and ""Human Essence"" are really really bad episodes, probably the lowest points of the whole series), but after becoming accustomed to the scripts having an underlying spiritual meaning, these episodes came across as flat crime stories.  And anyone who had become attached to the creative trends of the second season will have difficulty transitioning to the third season.Apparently somewhere midway through the season, the new producers saw the fanbase dwindling as a result of the changes, and as such began to slowly revert to the storytelling of the second season.  Beginning with ""Borrowed Time"", which is an emotionally gripping episode as Frank confronts the possible loss of his daughter, to ""The Sound of Snow"" which finally explains what happened at the conclusion of the previous season especially with regard to Frank Black's wife, to ""Antipas"" featuring the return of Lucy Butler, and ""Saturn Dreaming of Mercury"" where Frank Black's daughter Jordan confronts a demonic boy.There are some continuity problems between this season and the previous ones as well.  In ""Seven and One"", which is an otherwise excellent episode, we are told about an event from Frank Black's childhood with his brothers (plural!).  This conflicts with the established storyline that Frank Black has only one little brother Thomas, who we met in the first season episode ""Sacrament"".  Also, in ""Matryoshka"", there is a flashback sequence that suggests J. Edgar Hoover may be the founder of the Millennium Group, which seriously clashes with the second season episode ""The Hand of St. Sebastian"" that flashes back to Millennium Group members in Dark Ages.  And sadly, the two-part season/series finale episodes ""Via Dolorosa"" and ""Good Bye to All That"" fail to deliver the coda that long time fans had wanted.Interestingly, the behind-the-scenes featurette for this season is the most brief compared to the previous boxsets.  Chris Carter states clearly at the beginning that he was not pleased with the direction the second season had gone.  Moreover, fans of the second season will find themselves annoyed with some of the interviews by the obvious disdain that writer Michael Perry shows for the Morgan/Wong helmed second season.  I find it amusing that the third season producers suggest that they had actually run out of ideas for episodes by the middle point of the third season, when in magazine articles, Morgan and Wong had said that there were tons of stories and ideas that they did not have time to explore for the show.  Also on the DVD is another featurette containing discussions with real-life Academy Group members.  Lastly, the X-Files' episode ""Millennium"" featuring the return of Frank Black is also included on the final disk.This boxset is a ""must own"" for any fan of the TV series Millennium.  And for the more casual viewer, there are quite a few remarkable episodes from this season.  As I mentioned before, fans of the second season will have some measure of difficulty accepting the changes in this season: the early departure from spiritual/end of the world themed episodes, the demonization of the Millennium Group and particularly of beloved character Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn), and the continuity conflicts.  Still, this season holds some great promise, and we can always wonder what might have been in store for us had the show been renewed for a fourth season.  Viewers will see that there was an interesting plotline developing towards the end of the season that sadly never came to full fruition.**And one nitpicker's point: one episode of the third season will leave many viewers scratching their heads called ""Bardo Thodol"".  There are two threads in the plot that are both engaging and they do intertwine, though it is never made clear how they do: one involves red lacquer Tibetan bowls and another involves Frankstein-like stem cell research.  In only some TV markets, when this episode first aired, there were additional scenes included such as Peter Watts angrily smashing one of these red lacquer bowls.  These lost scenes were not added to the episode on this boxset.  When I bought this DVD set, I was hoping that I might finally get to see them and perhaps better understand the episode, but sadly they are not here.**",5,A Season of Challenges.....and a Swift

However, I had an upcoming birthday, and decided to ask someone for it. I received it, and from the first episode, the show was entirely reborn into quality programming. The third season is far more compelling and interesting than the two prior seasons (although season one was very good), despite all the reviews on this site praising the second (I'm just speechless...). Emma Hollis is a much more interesting and appealing sidekick than whatever-her-name-was in season two, and the quality of writing on nearly every episode is better than nearly every episode of the prior season. It's too bad they killed the show after its best season, but after season two, most of the fans of the show abandoned it, and didn't come back for the third. Trust me, if you liked season one and loathed season two like me (and most), you'll honestly like season three the best.",4,The series' best season...,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1053,"['abysmal', 'season', 'two', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'purchase', 'season', '3', 'own', 'X-Files', 'sets', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'Millennium', 'season', 'two', 'really', 'bad', 'However', 'had', 'upcoming', 'birthday', 'decided', 'ask', 'someone', 'received', 'first', 'episode', 'show', 'was', 'entirely', 'reborn', 'quality', 'programming', 'third', 'season', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'two', 'prior', 'seasons', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'reviews', 'site', 'praising', 'second', ""'m"", 'just', 'speechless', 'Emma', 'Hollis', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'appealing', 'sidekick', 'whatever-her-name-was', 'season', 'two', 'quality', 'writing', 'nearly', 'episode', 'better', 'nearly', 'episode', 'prior', 'season', 'too', 'bad', 'killed', 'show', 'best', 'season', 'season', 'two', 'most', 'fans', 'show', 'abandoned', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'third', 'Trust', 'liked', 'season', 'one', 'loathed', 'season', 'two', 'most', ""'ll"", 'honestly', 'season', 'three', 'best']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season
915660,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B0009X76XW,William Smith,"[25, 31]","(***This contains Season Two SPOILERS!***)The Good:I had no idea what to expect with Season Three, I had never seen a single episode. Having been left for 9 months with the conclusion of the Season Two DVD set, my mind wandered about what Season Three would bring; Frank isolated at the cabin, Jordan now missing her mother, a huge infectious outbreak, all to be summed up... finally! I was also anxious to get this set to see who would be ""left standing"". Sadly it appears that ""Lara Means"" got the ax though she may reappear, but fortunately everyone else is onboard. It wasn't made wholly clear whether Lara died in the S2 closer, but I can hope she didn't.I can say that as soon as I opened the box and looked at the art work I was skeptical. Seeing the attractive African American female so proximately displayed instantly made me think of one word; pandering. But maybe I shouldn't have jumped to such a radical conclusion because Klea Scott (as Agent Hollis) has proved to be a tremendous asset! Her humble demeanor is so perfect I'm truly glad she's here. Another new face that is a welcome addition is the ""Agent Baldwin"" role. His sarcastic and ""by the book"" no-nonsense way plays off of Scott perfectly, not to mention Frank. Even Frank's new boss is solid and above par. Of course Lance and Terry (Frank Black/Peter Watts) are also well above par and this season promises to be a treat since the main focus seems to be them as adversaries which was always their strong suits.I loved the Glen Morgan and James Wong vision of Season 2 with its lean towards a fantasy/history hybrid though Chip Johannessen's and Michael Duggan's (Season 3) seems tighter, similar, and actually somewhat more consistent (so far); even the humorous elements in certain episodes have returned (Kiss!). I'm really surprised by the overall quality... shocked actually, because so far this has lived up to Season 2, which out does my expectations there.The (not so) Good:There is a rough spot here and there though. The two parter that starts off Season Three has some amazing qualities, particularly in the production and casting areas, though what it lacks is continuity. In the last episode of S2 ""The Time Is Now"" the infection rates and scope seemed huge; from San Diego to even the Asian coast, however the infection as discussed in ""The Innocents"" (the S3 opener), describes the outbreak as being confined to the North West and killing 70 people. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't jibe and what was the graying hair on Frank all about? The flickering TV? I think I envisioned Season Three to be almost a post-Apocalyptic siege of sorts, what I got is a solid, well controlled, if confusing review of prior events. Another bit of a niggle I have; as much as I like the Agent Hollis role, the Frank Black role sometimes appears to be a foot-note. Hopefully as the show progresses his presence will too. Lastly, like Season 2, the episodes NOT about the Millennium Group are all over the map and range from; Great: ""Closure"", Typical: ""Through a Glass, Darkly"", and Generic: ""Teotwawki,"" it's just too bad every episode couldn't be about ""the Group"".The Packaging/Extra's:Kudos' to Fox for keeping the packaging consistent and not being tempted by the double-sided discs so many of the ""evil"" companies are embracing. This is probably the only 3 season set I have besides Star Trek that didn't under go some wild alterations or cost cutting measures. The extras are a bit too sparse, though welcome. On the back of the box it says that commentaries are provided for certain episodes, what it doesn't say is that there is only two of them. I have yet to watch the behind the scenes though if previous seasons are a quality barometer, these will surely be instructive and worthwhile. And making an unwelcome return is the ETERNITY it takes to get through the menu start-up screen.The Aftermath:In conclusion I do feel pangs of guilt over Millennium. Truly, I do. On network television I never watched beyond the first Season as it seemed the ""serial killer of the week"" scenario was severely overplayed, but now I feel total regret at not taking the time to watch the re-inventing of each Season (how was I to know?). God only knows where this show could have gone and now I guess we'll never really know. Though I've only watched a handful of this seasons efforts I would like to extend an invitation to Fox, Chris Carter, and of course Lance Henriksen to revive this show via the big screen or whatever vehicle is possible. I think I can speak for many here at Amazon and beyond when I say; build it, and we will come... now.",5,Regrets.,1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,4615,"['***This', 'Season', 'Two', 'SPOILERS', '***', 'Good', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Season', 'Three', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'Having', 'been', 'left', '9', 'months', 'conclusion', 'Season', 'Two', 'DVD', 'set', 'mind', 'wandered', 'what', 'Season', 'Three', 'would', 'bring', 'Frank', 'isolated', 'cabin', 'Jordan', 'now', 'missing', 'mother', 'huge', 'infectious', 'outbreak', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'finally', 'was', 'also', 'anxious', 'get', 'set', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'standing', 'Sadly', 'Lara', 'Means', 'got', 'ax', 'may', 'reappear', 'fortunately', 'everyone', 'else', 'onboard', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'wholly', 'clear', 'Lara', 'died', 'S2', 'closer', 'can', 'hope', ""didn't.I"", 'can', 'say', 'as', 'soon', 'opened', 'box', 'looked', 'art', 'work', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Seeing', 'attractive', 'African', 'American', 'female', 'so', 'proximately', 'displayed', 'instantly', 'made', 'think', 'one', 'word', 'pandering', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'jumped', 'such', 'radical', 'conclusion', 'Klea', 'Scott', 'Agent', 'Hollis', 'proved', 'be', 'tremendous', 'asset', 'humble', 'demeanor', 'so', 'perfect', ""'m"", 'truly', 'glad', 'here', 'new', 'face', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Agent', 'Baldwin', 'role', 'sarcastic', 'book', 'no-nonsense', 'way', 'Scott', 'perfectly', 'not', 'mention', 'Frank', 'Even', 'Frank', 'new', 'boss', 'solid', 'above', 'par', 'course', 'Lance', 'Terry', 'Frank', 'Black/Peter', 'Watts', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'par', 'season', 'be', 'treat', 'main', 'focus', 'be', 'adversaries', 'was', 'always', 'strong', 'suits.I', 'loved', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Wong', 'vision', 'Season', '2', 'lean', 'towards', 'fantasy/history', 'hybrid', 'Chip', 'Johannessen', 'Michael', 'Duggan', 'Season', '3', 'tighter', 'similar', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'more', 'consistent', 'so', 'far', 'even', 'humorous', 'elements', 'certain', 'episodes', 'have', 'returned', 'Kiss', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'overall', 'quality', 'shocked', 'actually', 'so', 'far', 'lived', 'up', 'Season', '2', 'out', 'expectations', 'there.The', 'not', 'so', 'Good', 'rough', 'spot', 'here', 'there', 'two', 'parter', 'Season', 'Three', 'amazing', 'qualities', 'particularly', 'production', 'casting', 'areas', 'what', 'continuity', 'last', 'episode', 'S2', 'Time', 'Now', 'infection', 'rates', 'scope', 'seemed', 'huge', 'San', 'Diego', 'even', 'Asian', 'coast', 'however', 'infection', 'discussed', 'Innocents', 'S3', 'opener', 'outbreak', 'being', 'confined', 'North', 'West', 'killing', '70', 'people', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'was', 'graying', 'hair', 'Frank', 'flickering', 'TV', 'think', 'envisioned', 'Season', 'Three', 'be', 'almost', 'post-Apocalyptic', 'siege', 'sorts', 'what', 'got', 'solid', 'well', 'controlled', 'confusing', 'review', 'prior', 'events', 'bit', 'niggle', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Agent', 'Hollis', 'role', 'Frank', 'Black', 'role', 'sometimes', 'be', 'foot-note', 'Hopefully', 'show', 'presence', 'will', 'too', 'Lastly', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'NOT', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'are', 'map', 'range', 'Great', 'Closure', 'Typical', 'Glass', 'Darkly', 'Generic', 'Teotwawki', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'episode', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'Group', 'Packaging/Extra', 'Kudos', 'Fox', 'keeping', 'packaging', 'consistent', 'not', 'being', 'tempted', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'so', 'many', 'evil', 'companies', 'are', 'embracing', 'probably', 'only', '3', 'season', 'set', 'have', 'besides', 'Star', 'Trek', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'wild', 'alterations', 'cost', 'cutting', 'measures', 'extras', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'sparse', 'welcome', 'back', 'box', 'commentaries', 'are', 'provided', 'certain', 'episodes', 'what', ""n't"", 'say', 'only', 'two', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'scenes', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'quality', 'barometer', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'instructive', 'worthwhile', 'making', 'unwelcome', 'return', 'ETERNITY', 'get', 'menu', 'start-up', 'screen.The', 'Aftermath', 'conclusion', 'do', 'feel', 'pangs', 'guilt', 'Millennium', 'Truly', 'do', 'network', 'television', 'never', 'watched', 'first', 'Season', 'seemed', 'serial', 'killer', 'week', 'scenario', 'was', 'severely', 'overplayed', 'now', 'feel', 'total', 'regret', 'not', 'taking', 'time', 'watch', 're-inventing', 'Season', 'how', 'was', 'know', 'God', 'only', 'where', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'now', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'know', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'handful', 'seasons', 'efforts', 'would', 'like', 'extend', 'invitation', 'Fox', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'course', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'revive', 'show', 'big', 'screen', 'vehicle', 'possible', 'think', 'can', 'speak', 'many', 'here', 'Amazon', 'when', 'say', 'build', 'will', 'come', 'now']",Millennium - The Complete Third Season
