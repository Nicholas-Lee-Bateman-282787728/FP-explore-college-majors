1457627,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B005F3XV8U,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[1, 1]","All Mary Kee wants out of life is to move on with hers now that she's divorced her abusive husband and gotten her own apartment.  And at first, things seem to be moving in that direction.  She's taking time off work, she's taking a few night classes at the college, where she meets a mathematics professor who seems to like her.  There is still the occasional visit from the mean ex, who just doesn't understand that 500 feet means 500 feet and he can't come any closer, but Mary's a woman discovering her inner strength, and she's not going to put up with too much nonsense from him.The only real major concern for Mary now is the disturbed woman who keeps calling her.  At first, it seemed like a wrong number, the woman was looking for Bobby.  But she had the number and the address right.  Must have been the person who lived here before me, Mary thinks.  But then Rose says Bobby proposed to her when he got back from Vietnam.  That was over 35 years ago, Mary says.Some time later, Rose calls again and says she's going to draw something inside the pantry for Mary to find.  Mary does find it, a picture of a rose, but it's hidden beneath a layer of paint.That's because I'm calling you from 1979, Rose claims.Mary thinks it's all an elaborate trick being played by her ex, until Rose calls again one day and says she took Mary's advice and got rid of her cheating boyfriend Bobby, and no one will ever find him.  Then Mary goes to the pantry and finds it's been bricked up.  It wasn't like that the last time she went in there, and this seems too much even for her ex-husband.She tells Rose to never call her again.  But that was the exact wrong thing to say to an unstable woman who lives in the same town you lived in 32 years earlier, and knows how to find your younger self.THE CALLER is a very intelligent thriller from writer Sergio Casci and director Matthew Parkhill.  Originally written as a short titled ""Rose"" in 1998, THE CALLER stars Rachelle Lefevre from ""Under the Dome"" as Mary.  Lefevre carries the movie very well, giving a very subtle but believable performance.  She comes across as someone tired of being the victim and is making the necessary changes in her life.  She has her moments of fear against her ex when he shows up, but Lefevre displays a growing confidence throughout the movie that makes us root all the more for her character.  Which makes her trials against Rose all the more suspenseful.The premise of the plot is full of tension and a pervading sense of hopelessness.  Mary can't give Rose the friendship she wants, but if Mary doesn't give Rose something, anything, there's no telling what will happen.  With the kind of one-way access road going on where Rose can get to Mary 32 years before Mary can even bat an eye, really, how can Mary hope to protect herself?Stephen Moyer stars as Johnny, the college professor/hopeful boyfriend, and for a change I actually found him pleasant and charming.Casci's script is well-crafted and Parkhill's direction creates an excellent atmosphere.  A few of the plot twists were predictable from miles away, but it didn't make them any less effective when they came, and there were a couple of really glaring plot holes in the third act, but nothing that couldn't be ignored for the greater good of the movie as a whole.  Overall, I very much enjoyed THE CALLER, and can recommend it without hesitation.",4,The Caller,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,3386,"['Mary', 'Kee', 'life', 'move', 'hers', 'now', 'divorced', 'abusive', 'husband', 'gotten', 'own', 'apartment', 'first', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'moving', 'direction', 'taking', 'time', 'work', 'taking', 'few', 'night', 'classes', 'college', 'where', 'mathematics', 'professor', 'who', 'like', 'still', 'occasional', 'visit', 'mean', 'ex', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', '500', 'feet', '500', 'feet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'closer', 'Mary', 'woman', 'discovering', 'inner', 'strength', 'not', 'going', 'put', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'nonsense', 'him.The', 'only', 'real', 'major', 'concern', 'Mary', 'now', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'who', 'calling', 'first', 'seemed', 'wrong', 'number', 'woman', 'was', 'looking', 'Bobby', 'had', 'number', 'address', 'right', 'Must', 'have', 'been', 'person', 'who', 'lived', 'here', 'Mary', 'then', 'Rose', 'Bobby', 'proposed', 'when', 'got', 'back', 'Vietnam', 'was', '35', 'years', 'ago', 'Mary', 'says.Some', 'time', 'later', 'Rose', 'again', 'going', 'draw', 'something', 'pantry', 'Mary', 'find', 'Mary', 'find', 'picture', 'rose', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'layer', 'paint.That', ""'m"", 'calling', '1979', 'Rose', 'claims.Mary', 'thinks', 'elaborate', 'trick', 'being', 'played', 'ex', 'Rose', 'again', 'one', 'day', 'took', 'Mary', 'advice', 'got', 'rid', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'Bobby', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'Then', 'Mary', 'pantry', 'been', 'bricked', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', 'time', 'went', 'there', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'ex-husband.She', 'tells', 'Rose', 'never', 'call', 'again', 'was', 'exact', 'wrong', 'thing', 'say', 'unstable', 'woman', 'who', 'same', 'town', 'lived', '32', 'years', 'earlier', 'how', 'find', 'younger', 'self.THE', 'CALLER', 'very', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'writer', 'Sergio', 'Casci', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Parkhill', 'Originally', 'written', 'short', 'titled', 'Rose', '1998', 'THE', 'CALLER', 'Rachelle', 'Lefevre', 'Dome', 'Mary', 'Lefevre', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'giving', 'very', 'subtle', 'believable', 'performance', 'someone', 'tired', 'being', 'victim', 'making', 'necessary', 'changes', 'life', 'moments', 'fear', 'ex', 'when', 'up', 'Lefevre', 'growing', 'confidence', 'movie', 'root', 'more', 'character', 'Which', 'trials', 'Rose', 'more', 'suspenseful.The', 'premise', 'plot', 'full', 'tension', 'pervading', 'sense', 'hopelessness', 'Mary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'Rose', 'friendship', 'Mary', ""n't"", 'give', 'Rose', 'something', 'anything', 'telling', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'kind', 'one-way', 'access', 'road', 'going', 'where', 'Rose', 'can', 'get', 'Mary', '32', 'years', 'Mary', 'can', 'even', 'bat', 'eye', 'really', 'how', 'can', 'Mary', 'hope', 'protect', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'Johnny', 'college', 'professor/hopeful', 'boyfriend', 'change', 'actually', 'found', 'pleasant', 'charming.Casci', 'script', 'well-crafted', 'Parkhill', 'direction', 'excellent', 'atmosphere', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'predictable', 'miles', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'effective', 'when', 'came', 'were', 'couple', 'really', 'glaring', 'plot', 'holes', 'third', 'act', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'greater', 'good', 'movie', 'whole', 'Overall', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'CALLER', 'can', 'recommend', 'hesitation']",The Caller

Soon enough she starts recieving phone calls of a woman who claims she is from the past and desperatly needs a friend. Unlucky for Mary the woman is also seriously disturbed and soon uses the past to destroy Mary's present.The Caller would be something Rod Serling would write in his worse days. The film isn't intelligent nor is it scary in anyway imaginable but it's also perfectly watchable. The film does manage an impressive little atmosphere throughout and there are a few decent albeit confusing plot twists here and there but it just never elevates to anything above average. It just simmers until it's eye roll worthy final scene and never takes off. Rod Serling would rightfully trash this one amazon shoppers and start from scratch!The Caller also struggles to properly identify itself. You'll groan as you notice every part of town needs better lighting. You'll mutter when the lead sees a figure in her old photos she just never noticed before. Really the list goes on and on but I don't have all night ;)  Maybe if The Caller had a few more capable people behind the camera  and a much more talented screenwriter with ides of his own then we would've got a more satisfying finished product.But even if I was hard on it it's not all bad really! It's still rather interesting and I wasn't bored so I say give it a watch and judge for yourself :) If you aren't familar with The Twilight Zone or the horror genre you'll likely dig it much more then I did.Perfectly okay if cliche and confusing.Not a must buy or must own.

Mary begins receiving strange phone calls from an old woman that claims to be from the past, and the two strike up an odd friendship until Rose begins to show cracks in her fractured personality.

THE CALLER gets off to a thrilling start, but eventually digresses into the supernatural equivalent of BACK TO THE FUTURE. By the end, the film becomes so laughably absurd and far-fetched that it loses all credibility. Twisted timelines require a huge suspension of disbelief, and often result in plot holes and logical inconsistencies. THE CALLER is no exception. The dramatic events that Rose initiates in the past have only a single small impact on the future. This leaves the audience focused on their confusion, and not on the film.

1457640,A11IEVWTVBKW2J,B005F3XV8U,Femvamp,"[0, 0]",I thought this movie was fantastic. The problem is people confuse horror and thriller. This is more thriller than horror. Kind of a VERY dark version of Back to the Future and Frequency. What happens when you change the past so much that it changes who you are in the present? This is low budget but in a good way and although the genre bills it as supernatural thriller it is more psychological thriller than anything else.

1457641,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B005F3XV8U,G. Teslovich,"[10, 10]","Compliments:First, to the phone - an ancient black rotary menace. Nice job creepy phone!Second, at times endearing; at times disturbing; at times threatening phone voice created by Lorna Raver.Third, to the claustrophobic apartment setting; subdued lighting, shadows and colors; use of sound and environment such as rain to enhance tension.Fourth, to the actors for their casual naturalistic acting e.g. pauses, conversational dialogue, nuanced everyday behaviors, facial expressions. In particular Lefevre, who was tossed into the role at the last moment and might be well served to use that method for future roles, looked very comfortable. She is a talent that is being wasted in TV spots.Brief storyline:Mary moves into an apartment in about 2010 that was inhabited by Rose in 1979. Rose calls Mary from around 1979 which becomes obsessively more frequent. They both acknowledge that their connection is happening for a reason. Both Rose and Mary have issues with males close to them and just in general. ""Men don't change ever!"" Then Mary suggests to Rose, while thinking of solving her own problems, to ""just get rid of him."" At this point you see that Rose instantly alters the future by changing the past and more than once.Spoiler (read when confused after watching the film):The rotary phone in Puerto Rico in the 70s would not be unusual. Using a phone as a vehicle for the past to communicate with the present is common in film. The phone was shown, in deleted scenes, being found in a box in the pantry coincidentally it was a phone cord used by Rose to hang herself. Rose lived close to where Mary (as a child) lived so she is able to threaten Mary (as a child) as well as people close to her. Rose kills her boyfriend Bobby and Mary's friends George and John (but when John was a boy). Thus the future changes and memories of each from the moment of death ceases. Rose wraps them all in the same old burlap and rope tucking them into the pantry while building a brick wall to hide the evidence. Rose eventually becomes upset with older Mary and takes it out on young Mary by spilling hot cooking oil consequently we see the burn marks instantly appear on the older Mary. Mary, in response, tries to get Rose to kill herself and in failing to do so Rose gets even more upset and tries to kill the visiting young Mary. The young Mary protects herself by breaking a wardrobe mirror and uses the broken glass to disable Rose. In 2010 we see the the now broken wardrobe mirror as well as a now appearing scar in Mary's palm where she held the glass. Both the young and old Mary are trying to protect themselves from Rose at the same time. As for Mary's ex (Steven) who several times threatens (e.g. Wedding photo with ""Till death do us part."" written on the back as well as stalking) she eventually says, ""Last chance Steven."" and to which he says, ""Yeah. Or what?"" which is why Mary's dispatching and tucking him into the newly re-bricked pantry along with the others fits into the story. She not only is re-enacting Rose but is singing her Shafto ""broken heart"" song at the end.Problems:Most of the ages and times just don't match up e.g. the gravestone used for the missing young John appears to say 1924. Rose was in her 40s in the '70s and appears not to have aged and still moves like she in her 40s. Rose did not die when she hung herself according to deleted scenes which changes the story considerably such as how can she be calling from the 70s while also in the present where she again attempts to kill the now older Mary. Without seeing the deleted scenes we have Rose in two separate time periods at once. What do the previous occupants (Mr. Mrs. Alvarez) of Mary's apartment have to do with the story. The alternate ending of a refurbished apartment with ringing phone makes no sense. The reason for the two scenes with blood on her finger is not clear. The subway and dream scenes just add confusion. Generally too many holes from poorly developed backgrounds; in tidying up loose ends and editing made the movie more confusing than it should be.",5,Puzzle Pieces That Don't Quite Fit,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,4071,"['Compliments', 'First', 'phone', 'ancient', 'black', 'rotary', 'menace', 'Nice', 'job', 'creepy', 'phone', 'Second', 'times', 'endearing', 'times', 'disturbing', 'times', 'threatening', 'phone', 'voice', 'created', 'Lorna', 'Raver.Third', 'claustrophobic', 'apartment', 'setting', 'subdued', 'lighting', 'shadows', 'colors', 'use', 'sound', 'environment', 'such', 'rain', 'enhance', 'tension.Fourth', 'actors', 'casual', 'naturalistic', 'acting', 'e.g', 'pauses', 'conversational', 'dialogue', 'nuanced', 'everyday', 'behaviors', 'facial', 'expressions', 'particular', 'Lefevre', 'who', 'was', 'tossed', 'role', 'last', 'moment', 'might', 'be', 'well', 'served', 'use', 'method', 'future', 'roles', 'looked', 'very', 'comfortable', 'talent', 'being', 'wasted', 'TV', 'spots.Brief', 'storyline', 'Mary', 'moves', 'apartment', '2010', 'was', 'inhabited', 'Rose', '1979', 'Rose', 'Mary', '1979', 'obsessively', 'more', 'frequent', 'acknowledge', 'connection', 'happening', 'reason', 'Rose', 'Mary', 'have', 'issues', 'males', 'close', 'just', 'general', 'Men', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'ever', 'Then', 'Mary', 'Rose', 'thinking', 'solving', 'own', 'problems', 'just', 'get', 'rid', 'point', 'see', 'Rose', 'instantly', 'future', 'changing', 'past', 'more', 'once.Spoiler', 'read', 'when', 'confused', 'watching', 'film', 'rotary', 'phone', 'Puerto', 'Rico', '70s', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'unusual', 'Using', 'phone', 'vehicle', 'past', 'communicate', 'present', 'common', 'film', 'phone', 'was', 'shown', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'being', 'found', 'box', 'pantry', 'coincidentally', 'was', 'phone', 'cord', 'used', 'Rose', 'hang', 'Rose', 'lived', 'close', 'where', 'Mary', 'child', 'lived', 'so', 'able', 'threaten', 'Mary', 'child', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'close', 'Rose', 'boyfriend', 'Bobby', 'Mary', 'friends', 'George', 'John', 'when', 'John', 'was', 'boy', 'Thus', 'future', 'changes', 'memories', 'moment', 'death', 'ceases', 'Rose', 'same', 'old', 'burlap', 'rope', 'tucking', 'pantry', 'building', 'brick', 'wall', 'hide', 'evidence', 'Rose', 'eventually', 'upset', 'older', 'Mary', 'out', 'young', 'Mary', 'spilling', 'hot', 'cooking', 'oil', 'consequently', 'see', 'burn', 'marks', 'instantly', 'appear', 'older', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'response', 'tries', 'get', 'Rose', 'kill', 'failing', 'do', 'so', 'Rose', 'even', 'more', 'upset', 'tries', 'kill', 'visiting', 'young', 'Mary', 'young', 'Mary', 'protects', 'breaking', 'wardrobe', 'mirror', 'broken', 'glass', 'disable', 'Rose', '2010', 'see', 'now', 'broken', 'wardrobe', 'mirror', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'appearing', 'scar', 'Mary', 'palm', 'where', 'held', 'glass', 'young', 'old', 'Mary', 'are', 'trying', 'protect', 'Rose', 'same', 'time', 'Mary', 'ex', 'Steven', 'who', 'several', 'times', 'threatens', 'e.g', 'Wedding', 'photo', 'Till', 'death', 'do', 'part', 'written', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'stalking', 'eventually', 'Last', 'chance', 'Steven', 'Yeah', 'what', 'why', 'Mary', 'dispatching', 'tucking', 'newly', 're-bricked', 'pantry', 'others', 'story', 'not', 'only', 're-enacting', 'Rose', 'singing', 'Shafto', 'broken', 'heart', 'song', 'end.Problems', 'Most', 'ages', 'times', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'e.g', 'gravestone', 'used', 'missing', 'young', 'John', 'say', '1924', 'Rose', 'was', '40s', ""'70s"", 'not', 'have', 'aged', 'still', 'moves', '40s', 'Rose', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'when', 'hung', 'according', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'story', 'considerably', 'such', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'calling', '70s', 'while', 'also', 'present', 'where', 'again', 'attempts', 'kill', 'now', 'older', 'Mary', 'seeing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'Rose', 'two', 'separate', 'time', 'periods', 'once', 'What', 'do', 'previous', 'occupants', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Alvarez', 'Mary', 'apartment', 'have', 'do', 'story', 'alternate', 'ending', 'refurbished', 'apartment', 'ringing', 'phone', 'sense', 'reason', 'two', 'scenes', 'blood', 'finger', 'not', 'clear', 'subway', 'dream', 'scenes', 'just', 'add', 'confusion', 'Generally', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'poorly', 'developed', 'backgrounds', 'tidying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'editing', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'confusing', 'should', 'be']",The Caller

You know she is an unstable character just by the sound of her voice, which is an accomplishment. But, the movie also focuses on Mary and her divorce. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but the cheap, repetitive jump scares that accompany this part of the story are ineffective and poorly explained. Is she haunted by Rose or her ex-husband? I won't spoil the film but her husband appears multiple times and, most of the time, he is a hallucination. Also, I say the jump scares are cheap and ineffective because they're completely random and basically pointless; they may jolt you for a moment, but you'll quickly shrug them off. Basically, the phone calls were scarier than the jump scares. The ending was ok, I had mixed feelings about it. The acting was decent, and the pacing was fast.The Caller is a decent time-killer; the concept and the phone calls were scary, the jump-scares and divorce side-story were not.

Didn't the prospectus warn you that you'll probably lose all of your money? I've heard good things about the Red One cameras (4K digital resolutions and all of that for under $20K) but if seeing is believing, well then I've seen better video clips shot with an iPhone compared to the dimly lit shadow-figures found fading incoherently from one fuzzy frame to the next in this fog-filled flick. Did the DI colorist use a box of crayons for primary and secondary color corrections instead of video scopes that measure luminance and saturation and color levels? I had to adjust the brightness and contrast levels on my TV to compensate for what appeared to be one poorly lit scene after another which worked for a while until being temporarily blinded by a sudden bursting blast of bright white light (usually coming in from a background window that wasn't masked by the colorist before cranking down the luma levels enough to discourage our sun from wanting to charge royalties for having an uncredited lead role). Other reviews here and elsewhere have covered the countless plot holes (a polite way to refer to inconsistencies found within a ridiculously absurd script) so I won't even get started on those except to say that when all was said and done, I knew I had wasted my time and energy trying to make sense out of a plot that makes no sense to anyone who has stopped wearing bibs and diapers.

The actress playing Mary does a very convincing job as well as the woman doing the voice on the phone. The movie begins to fall apart, how ever, when Mary enters the food closet off the kitchen after one of the strange calls. She is upset, but we, the viewers, don't really understand why. The closet was never really shown up until this point. Later, it is revealed that suddenly, a brick wall had been built in it that was not there a few minutes before.And that sets the plot of the rest of the movie. Things will happen, characters will appear, only in the next scene to be revealed that they/it never happened or existed. The caller is doing things in the past and Mary is finding them in the present. That alone, could have made the movie very creepy, but when the plot twists and fake people are thrown in, it got muddled and confusing.++++++++Spoilers+++++I have many questions.

Entity gets creepy.  Person tries to break contact.  Entity doesn't like this and plays rough.  Person pushes back.  Entity reveals true malevolent self.  Person is backed into a corner and makes a desperate play to win it all.  We've seen this storyline a million times already (and done much better).  Adding a domineering and abusive ex-husband as a second creepy entity did nothing for the film.  Stick to the main storyline.

The plot is creative, but the logic of what might be a time warp occasionally breaks down. Or at least, making all the pieces fit requires a disproportionate amount of effort.Still, this could have been a superior supernatural thriller if the photography had been better. As it is, the DVD projects muddily onto the screen. Also, the film was shot in Puerto Rico, but doesn't take advantage of that setting. Perhaps some shots of the Island's primordial lushness could have suggested a floating time frame. But Puerto Rico is usually presented as squalid, ugly, and industrial, without being ominous. Our eyes strain to make out what's happening in the murky gloom, inside and out. What's more, the presence of the heroine and a variety of English-speaking characters is only sketchily and unconvincingly explained.
