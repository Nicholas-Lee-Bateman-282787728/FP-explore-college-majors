794762,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00018D36O,Gavin Wilson,"[16, 17]","This wonderfully comic play can be viewed at many levels:- A clash of classes (Beverley and the neighbouring couple are working class; her husband Lawrence aspires to be middle class; and Abigail's Mum is upper middle.)- A conflict of skills (Beverley as the stay-at-home, childless wife doesn't work, doesn't cook and orders poor Lawrence to do virtually everything, whereas her apparently inept neighbour comes into her own as nurse at the climax of the play.)- As an allegory on the white man's departure from Africa. At the time of the play's creation, Britain was negotiating its exit from Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia). Abigail's posh Mum doesn't know whether to leave the partygoers to it -- possibly causing havoc -- or to interfere herself, or to ask Lawrence to go round and report back.Whichever way you look at it, it's tremendous fun throughout, with a flawless performance by Alison Steadman as Beverley. There are some fantastic lines, most of them uttered by Janine Duvitski (who went on to star in ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE), such as &quot;I've got very beautiful lips&quot; (you have to see Steadman's reaction), and &quot;We're so alike&quot; (ditto).Strangely the weakest performance is by Tim Stern as Lawrence, who never totally convinces as the stressed-out, over-sensitive estate agent who thinks he's cultured because he owns a set of Shakespeare's works which he never expects to read.The accompanying featurette is all too short, but it's pretty clear that this play simply wouldn't have existed without Alison Steadman's demonic creation. Mike Leigh may have been the writer/ director, but Beverley was based on an Essex woman and a cosmetics demonstrator whom Steadman met prior to the improvisations.The DVD picture quality is a good as you could possibly expect from a BBC 1970s studio production.

794763,A10ODC971MDHV8,B00018D36O,John Farr,"[4, 4]","Based on a theater play produced for the BBC, Leigh's dark-humored situational farce examines a group of people feebly attempting to have a good time although they are all secretly miserable. As Beverly, Steadman (wife of the director) is aggressively jolly and controlling, not to mention drunk and openly flirtatious with Salthouse's simmering Tony. For every awkward moment, another drink is poured. This is an ensemble piece, and the interplay between the five actors, confined to a single living-room stage, is exquisitely handled by Leigh. Crash this ""Party"" for a harshly funny look at failed marriage and the cruelties of passive aggression.",5,Abigail's Party,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,649,"['Based', 'theater', 'play', 'produced', 'BBC', 'Leigh', 'dark-humored', 'situational', 'farce', 'group', 'people', 'feebly', 'attempting', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'are', 'secretly', 'miserable', 'Beverly', 'Steadman', 'wife', 'director', 'aggressively', 'jolly', 'controlling', 'not', 'mention', 'drunk', 'openly', 'flirtatious', 'Salthouse', 'simmering', 'Tony', 'awkward', 'moment', 'drink', 'poured', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'interplay', 'five', 'actors', 'confined', 'single', 'living-room', 'stage', 'exquisitely', 'handled', 'Leigh', 'Crash', 'Party', 'harshly', 'funny', 'look', 'failed', 'marriage', 'cruelties', 'passive', 'aggression']",N/A
794764,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B00018D36O,Julian Kennedy,"[2, 10]","Abigail's Party: 2 out of 10. This is a poorly lit (especially first half) extremely stagy TV show (basically a filmed play.) Highly regarded by some critics but at close to two hours with 5 very unpleasant people it hardly ranks as entertainment.The main character Beverly reminds one of Peg from Married with Children but with no Al to provide the counter pointing laughs she remains strangely unchallenged throughout. In fact the description of Abigail's Party as a comedy is a bit of a puzzler as this is drama writ large. A true character exercise only a stage actor could love.While insightful into the desperation of some of the middle class of England, countless movies and shows have exposed middle class foibles with better results. Even a half hour sitcom like ""Keeping Up Appearances"" covers the same ground more completely and with many more laughs.Truth be told these people would be miserable no matter what class they were in and like a trapped guest I was looking to leave Abigail's Party as soon as I could",1,Abigail's Party...

It says a lot about marriages during that era, the desire to keep up with the Joneses, rampant alcoholism, and the absurd pressure some middle aged people seemed to feel to seem young forever.  The lead character Barbara is pathetic and insufferable but fascinating to watch.

794766,A3TSPLFYU2UMW0,B00018D36O,nicjaytee,"[7, 7]","Like ""The Office"" 25 years later, ""Abigail's Party"" is such perfectly targeted, close to the truth humour that it makes you laugh out loud and cringe with embarrassment at the same time. In a setting that represents everyone's nightmare of mid 70's middle class life it sucks you into its brilliantly drawn world and then leaves you as some sort of unwelcome voyeur in the cocktail party from hell. Like most of the people there, you want to get out but you can't, and as things go from bad to worse you end up totally transfixed by the sheer awfulness of the situation you find yourself in.With characters whose lives are so desperately frustrating that real aggression lies only just below the surface, this is black comedy at its very best precisely because it's much too close to reality for comfort. You can't help but laugh but you know that you're laughing at these people and their tragically depressing lives, and by the ""sting in the tail"" ending you really wish you hadn't.

794767,AY8H2NJDWMH5V,B00018D36O,R. Lewis,"[1, 1]","Abigail's Party is widely seen as one of the greatest ever one off TV programmes by Brit viewers. A comedy drama masterpiece in natural dialogue, embarrasing situations and all-too believable characters. If you feel uncomfortable watching this and wish to be somewhere else (just like the play's character Susan ),then the brilliant Mike Leigh has done his job in showing the awfulness of 70's middle class suburban Britain - but you still have to watch all of it! This play is still loved and respected to this day in the UK, possibly due to when the BBC repeated it when rival TV channel ITV were on strike and off the air. This was back when there were only 3 channels in the UK, so an amazing 16 million people saw this ( a huge audience figure in the UK for a TV play ). I was one of those millions, and even though I was just a kid I was aware I was watching something special, even if all the play's subtleties were way over my head. I'd best describe it as a British 70's tv sitcom but directed by Harold Pinter. I suspect Ricky Gervais is a fan too, as The Office also captures all the same social awkwardness and tedium of the modern age, along with a central character just like David Brent who's an unbearable deluded idiot that you still end up sympathizing with. Especially worth seeing for Alison Steadman's powerhouse central performance as the dreadful Beverly, though the rest of the cast are perfect too.",5,The first ever cringe comedy?
