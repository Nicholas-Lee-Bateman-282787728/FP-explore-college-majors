374994,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6303448968,C. O. DeRiemer,"[17, 17]","David Somers (Trevor Howard) was a British agent who had a tough war and has been let go by his spymasters. He takes a job at a country house where he can get away from cities and people. The job is to catalogue the extensive butterfly collection belonging to Nicholas Fenton (Barry Jones). Fenton lives in the place with his sister, Jess (Sonia Dresdel), and their niece, Sophie Malraux (Jean Simmons). There also is a thuggish gameskeeper who seems to have a relationship of some sort with Sonia and who pushes himself on Sophie.As Somers works on the collection he sees that all may not be what it appears. Sophie has been described to him as nervous, highly strung, prone to imagine things. But does she? Then the gameskeeper is killed with Sophie's knife and she's accused of the murder. David doesn't believe she did it, and resolves to use his skills as a former agent to take Sophie away and out of the country. The police go after them...and so does the killer. After a chase through the Lake Country, the killer is confronted on the rooftops of Newcastle by Somers, the devious plot against Sophie is uncovered, and David and Sophie, obviously in love, embrace.This is a first-class romantic chase mystery which any person fond of Hitchcock's movies in the Thirties, especially The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps, should greatly enjoy. Trevor Howard in his prime was a first-class leading man...intelligent, skeptical and prepared to do violence. Jean Simmons when she made this movie was only 22. She does a marvelous job, and appears so vulnerable you start rooting for her the moment she comes on the screen.Unfortunately, the movie is available on VHS only and the film transfer, while acceptable, is not the best. Still, this is a movie worth having.

374995,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6303448968,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[8, 8]","This is an interesting film about England, though it is a thriller and its main objective is to describe a crime and to follow the investigation. But the main part of the film is a chase of the police after two escapees, one of them being the suspected  killer . This chase makes us discover England, a rather old period of it, under a very interesting light. We have a close vision of  Liverpool harbour, of the railway station, of the Lake District, etc. It also shows how a man from the secret services has connections in all quarters of the city and is able to get about everything he wants. It also indicates how the police is unable to cope with an ex-secret-serviceman whereas a man from the secret service can get him rather fast. This escapee knows it and he plans it so that he is just one leap ahead, just enough to escape and bring the real criminal to the trap he lays out for him. It is amazing to discover how many people in England help this man because of his reputation we imagine is positive and because he escapes the police, and thus must be right and has to be helped and protected. This kind of reaction is rather rare in England where the police is very well respected. It is thus necessary to mention it because this  solidarity  is quite uncommon. Apart from that the thriller itself is very well made and the acting is quite good, for a little film of that type. This is also very English, at least in a time when they had a good independent cinema industry : even a little film had good actors, which was and still is far from being the case in the USA.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,The Lake District is a beautiful place indeed,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1602,"['interesting', 'film', 'England', 'thriller', 'main', 'objective', 'describe', 'crime', 'follow', 'investigation', 'main', 'part', 'film', 'chase', 'police', 'two', 'escapees', 'one', 'being', 'suspected', 'killer', 'chase', 'discover', 'England', 'rather', 'old', 'period', 'very', 'interesting', 'light', 'have', 'close', 'vision', 'Liverpool', 'harbour', 'railway', 'station', 'Lake', 'District', 'etc', 'also', 'how', 'man', 'secret', 'services', 'connections', 'quarters', 'city', 'able', 'get', 'everything', 'also', 'how', 'police', 'unable', 'cope', 'ex-secret-serviceman', 'whereas', 'man', 'secret', 'service', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'fast', 'escapee', 'so', 'just', 'one', 'leap', 'ahead', 'just', 'enough', 'escape', 'bring', 'real', 'criminal', 'trap', 'out', 'amazing', 'discover', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'England', 'help', 'man', 'reputation', 'imagine', 'positive', 'police', 'thus', 'must', 'be', 'right', 'be', 'helped', 'protected', 'kind', 'reaction', 'rather', 'rare', 'England', 'where', 'police', 'very', 'well', 'respected', 'thus', 'necessary', 'mention', 'solidarity', 'quite', 'uncommon', 'Apart', 'thriller', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'little', 'film', 'type', 'also', 'very', 'English', 'least', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'good', 'independent', 'cinema', 'industry', 'even', 'little', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'actors', 'was', 'still', 'far', 'being', 'case', 'USA.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",The Clouded Yellow VHS
374996,AQE41QO3NEUMW,6303448968,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[0, 0]","This is Hitchcock material, a seemingly low-keyed domestic situation in a country house where an out-of-work spy (Howard) takes a temp job cataloguing a butterfly collection. Under the somewhat strained surface we discover all manner of tensions involving an emotionally disturbed niece (Simmons) and a local cad who appears carrying dead rabbits and is a heartthrob of the lady of the house. A murder sets the plot in motion, and when suspicion turns toward the presumably unstable Simmons, Howard whisks her away to London and points north - or more accurately north by northwest. Eventually the couple is crossing the Lake Country with Scotland Yard in hot pursuit. There's a breathtaking sequence in the shipyards of Liverpool as the actual murderer joins the chase.Hitchcock would have squeezed more eerie suspense out of the domestic scene and more shades of psychological complexity from the leads. Howard hardly breaks a sweat, and there's never any ambiguity about his interest in the girl or the ""mistake"" he made previous to the first reel that got him thrown out of intelligence work. Meanwhile, there's hardly any doubt that the girl could be potentially murderous. The moody night scenes while the two are on the run make the most of black and white photography, and for Anglophiles, the glimpses of post-war Britain are interesting, but at best the film is a minor classic. For another portrayal by Simmons as a piano-playing psycho who gets involved with a guy who tries to rescue her, see ""Angel Face.""",3,Wants Hitchcock's touch . . .,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,1519,"['Hitchcock', 'material', 'seemingly', 'low-keyed', 'domestic', 'situation', 'country', 'house', 'where', 'out-of-work', 'spy', 'Howard', 'temp', 'job', 'cataloguing', 'butterfly', 'collection', 'somewhat', 'strained', 'surface', 'discover', 'manner', 'tensions', 'involving', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'niece', 'Simmons', 'local', 'cad', 'who', 'carrying', 'dead', 'rabbits', 'heartthrob', 'lady', 'house', 'murder', 'plot', 'motion', 'when', 'suspicion', 'presumably', 'unstable', 'Simmons', 'Howard', 'away', 'London', 'points', 'north', 'more', 'accurately', 'north', 'northwest', 'Eventually', 'couple', 'crossing', 'Lake', 'Country', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'breathtaking', 'sequence', 'shipyards', 'Liverpool', 'actual', 'murderer', 'chase.Hitchcock', 'would', 'have', 'squeezed', 'more', 'eerie', 'suspense', 'domestic', 'scene', 'more', 'shades', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'leads', 'Howard', 'hardly', 'sweat', 'never', 'ambiguity', 'interest', 'girl', 'mistake', 'made', 'previous', 'first', 'reel', 'got', 'thrown', 'intelligence', 'work', 'Meanwhile', 'hardly', 'doubt', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'potentially', 'murderous', 'moody', 'night', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'run', 'make', 'most', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'Anglophiles', 'glimpses', 'post-war', 'Britain', 'are', 'interesting', 'best', 'film', 'minor', 'classic', 'portrayal', 'Simmons', 'piano-playing', 'psycho', 'who', 'involved', 'guy', 'who', 'rescue', 'see', 'Angel', 'Face']",The Clouded Yellow VHS

I found it mildly interesting as I might find a museum piece or a bit of social history: Britain in the age when rationing was still in force.  And of course, it's always of interest to see stalwarts of the British post war movie industry doing their thing but there are so much better films to watch than this.  It represents something of a decline for Howard when set against masterpieces like Carol Reed's The Third man or David Lean's Brief Encounter and neither does it stand comparison with Hitchcock's early British thrillers with which it's been bracketed.As a nostalgia piece it's okay but great cinema it aint!",2,Routine 'thriller!',1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,728,"['guess', 'fifties', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'exciting', 'respect', ""n't"", 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'found', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'might', 'find', 'museum', 'piece', 'bit', 'social', 'history', 'Britain', 'age', 'when', 'rationing', 'was', 'still', 'force', 'course', 'always', 'interest', 'see', 'stalwarts', 'British', 'post', 'war', 'movie', 'industry', 'doing', 'thing', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'watch', 'something', 'decline', 'Howard', 'when', 'set', 'masterpieces', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'Third', 'man', 'David', 'Lean', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'neither', 'stand', 'comparison', 'Hitchcock', 'early', 'British', 'thrillers', 'been', 'nostalgia', 'piece', 'okay', 'great', 'cinema']",The Clouded Yellow VHS

There, he falls in love with a strange girl (Jean Simmons). When the girl is accused of murdering a gamekeeper (Maxwell Reed), the ex-agent and the girl go on the run with the police and secret service in full pursuit. The term Hitchcockian is overused and often applied to almost any routine thriller. In this particular case however, the appellation is justified. Directed by Ralph Thomas from an original screenplay by Janet Green (Ford's 7 WOMEN), this is a well crafted thriller in the style of THE 39 STEPS with a marvelous red herring in the plot to point you in the wrong direction. The score is by Benjamin Frankel (NIGHT OF THE IGUANA). With Kenneth More, Barry Jones, Sonia Dresdel, Geoffrey Keen, Marianne Stone and Eric Pohlmann.The Eureka DVD via Great Britain is, for the most part, a decent transfer.
