1512340,A3KA2MOVBHFWVR,B0067EKYS6,Adam,"[3, 6]","Tackling a classical novel by turning it into a blockbuster is always going to be tough. Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is stunning and sensational, but can't live up to Fitzgerald's original prose. In my opinion, though, it comes about as close as it can get.The tale of Nick Carroway's induction both into decadent society and into the irrepressible, insane hopes of Jay Gatsy is told through a narrative framing device unique to this 2013 version of the story: Nick is a recovering alcoholic in the future, and tells the entire story to his psychiatrist, who urges him to write it down as a novel that just happens to sound exactly like the celebrated source material. This is clearly a way for the film to get away with a ton of narration. The film even explicitly shows the typed words on screen occasionally.This whole thing is a bit questionable, as a film that adapts a book is supposed to stand by itself as a film, with as little narration as possible, and certainly without the actual words showing up on screen. However, the film is also admitting that the book is better at sounding good, so I can't really blame it for admitting the truth.Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Carey Mulligan all tend to love this type of film: cool, slick, and cultured. They all act well, and fit their characters aptly. The film stands out in a couple ways. First, the CGI is thick and strong, giving the film a more surreal quality, and one that keeps it interesting. Chris Godfrey, the VFX supervisor, has posted a clip on Vimeo that points out just how much the CGI influenced the final product: [...]It definitely establishes the excess and cheer of the 20s, though maybe not as subtly as the original text. The second stand-out element is the soundtrack. It uses modern artists -- Lana del Rey and Jay-Z, for instance -- to evoke the mood of the film, rather than using time-period-suitable musical choices. It's definitely a polarizing choice, as I've heard from people who loved it and hated it, but no one who didn't notice and form an opinion on it.I like it: the soundtrack carries the same themes of hedonism and unrequited longing that are essential to the story, but uses them through fresh musical eyes, removing the feel of age and vintage that an older soundtrack would force on the audience. It's not the same as Fitzgerald imagined it, but that's because we could attain that mood after the decade has passed. I suppose the most accurate path to that mood would be to read the book, though. So if you enjoy this film, go check it out from your local library.",5,"A flashy, fun version of a tough story to film",1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,2573,"['Tackling', 'classical', 'novel', 'turning', 'blockbuster', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'tough', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'stunning', 'sensational', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Fitzgerald', 'original', 'prose', 'opinion', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get.The', 'tale', 'Nick', 'Carroway', 'induction', 'decadent', 'society', 'irrepressible', 'insane', 'hopes', 'Jay', 'Gatsy', 'told', 'narrative', 'framing', 'device', 'unique', '2013', 'version', 'story', 'Nick', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'future', 'entire', 'story', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'write', 'down', 'novel', 'just', 'sound', 'exactly', 'celebrated', 'source', 'material', 'clearly', 'way', 'film', 'get', 'away', 'ton', 'narration', 'film', 'even', 'explicitly', 'typed', 'words', 'screen', 'occasionally.This', 'whole', 'thing', 'bit', 'questionable', 'film', 'book', 'supposed', 'stand', 'film', 'as', 'little', 'narration', 'possible', 'certainly', 'actual', 'words', 'showing', 'up', 'screen', 'However', 'film', 'also', 'admitting', 'book', 'better', 'sounding', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'admitting', 'truth.Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'tend', 'love', 'type', 'film', 'cool', 'slick', 'cultured', 'act', 'well', 'fit', 'characters', 'aptly', 'film', 'out', 'couple', 'ways', 'First', 'CGI', 'thick', 'strong', 'giving', 'film', 'more', 'surreal', 'quality', 'one', 'interesting', 'Chris', 'Godfrey', 'VFX', 'supervisor', 'posted', 'clip', 'Vimeo', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'CGI', 'influenced', 'final', 'product', '[', 'definitely', 'excess', 'cheer', '20s', 'though', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'subtly', 'original', 'text', 'second', 'stand-out', 'element', 'soundtrack', 'modern', 'artists', 'Lana', 'del', 'Rey', 'Jay-Z', 'instance', 'evoke', 'mood', 'film', 'rather', 'using', 'time-period-suitable', 'musical', 'choices', 'definitely', 'polarizing', 'choice', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'hated', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'form', 'opinion', 'it.I', 'soundtrack', 'same', 'themes', 'hedonism', 'unrequited', 'longing', 'are', 'essential', 'story', 'fresh', 'musical', 'eyes', 'removing', 'feel', 'age', 'vintage', 'older', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'force', 'audience', 'not', 'same', 'Fitzgerald', 'imagined', 'could', 'attain', 'mood', 'decade', 'passed', 'suppose', 'most', 'accurate', 'path', 'mood', 'would', 'be', 'read', 'book', 'though', 'So', 'enjoy', 'film', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'local', 'library']",The Great Gatsby 2013

1512352,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0067EKYS6,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 8]","`The Great Gatsby' was one of those films I really, truly wanted to love.  While not on the same level of anticipation as last years `Les Miserables', `The Great Gatsby' was extremely high on my list of films with the most potential to wow me this year.  I'm a huge fan of the novel.  Fitzgerald's most recognized work is an outstanding piece of literature, and having read it last year for the first time, it was one of those rare instances where all the hype surrounding a book represented it well.  I was blown away.  Having seen the 1974 film version years ago, I had this lingering air of disappointment resting in the back of my mind.  Coppola's Redford/Farrow helmed film was a boring mess and never really captured the magnificence or even poignancy of Fitzgerald's prose, which is shocking to be honest (you'd think that director and that cast would be aces).Baz Luhrmann is never boring.When news broke initially that Baz was going to be adapting this novel, I was nervous.  I love Luhrmann's style more than most and so I had no qualms with that aspect, but the fact that at the time all I had going on was the 1974 version (which bored me to tears) and the casting (Maguire, really?) has me thinking this was a bad idea.  Then I read the novel and became more intrigued by the prospect of Luhrmann doing for Gatsby what he did for Romeo.I was hooked.While the rest of the world cringed at every new development regarding this project (the stills, the trippy party scenes, the Jay-Z centered soundtrack, the casting of Carey Mulligan, the visual expansiveness) I was in hog-heaven; wet with anticipation.  I love the bold visual quality to Luhrmann's body of work.  No, I've never seen `Australia', but I have seen the rest of his films, and I personally consider `Romeo + Juliet' a masterpiece and consider `Moulin Rouge' close to one.  His sense of style and trashy elegance is profound and unmistakably authentic to his own vision.  He has undeniable showmanship, and while his films can become chaotic and almost trippy, he reigns in those formulas to create something inspired and endearing.  Sure, it doesn't seem like the obvious fit for Fitzgerald and yet that is what I loved so much about this project `in the making'.  It was so out of left field.  It didn't make sense, and because of that I was expecting absolute, unbridled G-R-E-A-T-N-E-S-S.I kind of got M-A-D-N-E-S-S instead.I don't want this to be a total bashing of the film, because I did not hate this, but unlike some film experiences, this did not rest better on me the more I thought about it.  The flaws here are too large to ignore, and while some flawed films make the most of their flaws over time (even those obnoxious close ups in `Les Miserables' can be argued as intimate after subsequent viewings), the more I think about `The Great Gatsby' the more uneasy I am over the overall product.  Still, there are certain aspects that deserve our attention (most notably the technical aspects and Joel Edgerton).I'll talk about those first.The film is lushly draped and a whole lot of fun to watch, from a purely visual standpoint.  Okay, the use of CGI was atrocious and made me really, really angry, but I'm talking about the clothes and sets right now.  The garments for each character were beautifully tailored and expertly crafted for each individual personality.  The use of angelic pastels for Daisy or gruff structure for Tom or silky smooth polish for Gatsby were all magnificently accurate.  The rooms, the showman's quality to each piece was jaw dropping in many respects.The acting, for the most part, was really well done.  Carey Mulligan, despite initial concerns, was a wonderful Daisy.  She captured her free spirit trapped by her upper crust lifestyle and her imbedded selfishness that refused to allow her to completely follow her heart.  She had this breathy, almost adolescent take on Daisy's overall `act', but she managed to flesh out those final moments with her eyes to excruciating detail.  Newcomer Elizabeth Debicki was sensationally good as Jordon Baker.  I had high hopes for this particular performance because Lois Chiles delivers my favorite performance in Coppola's film and so I love what `can' be done with this character.  Debicki did all that and then some!  She handled her alluring tension, her unashamed material point of view and her dripping sensuality while capturing the era, the vibe and the bridled chaos of the city.  For me though, Joel Edgerton takes top honors.  Not only does he hold his accent marvelously (poor DiCaprio goes in and out too much) but he also etches out every layer of Tom's emotional complexity.  When reading the novel I was enamored with how layered this man was, and he instantly became one of my favorite literary villains.  Edgerton gets it so right here.  He captures Tom's sexual presence as well as his gruff exterior, his selfish tendencies and his control issues.  The panic in his eyes when he sees his world slipping is compelling, and the tension he brings to his neck when he faces Gatsby's rage is fantastic.  That laugh, that all knowing chuckle (that shakes in its attempt to mask his fears) is flawless, and his manipulative talk is authentic to a T.DiCaprio is effective here, but the script doesn't help him much (I agree with those who say a drinking game on the utterances of `Old Sport' would result in alcohol poisoning) and Tobey Maguire is a mess.  His narration is awful (I hate his voice) and he really suffers at trying to bring some authenticity to his role.  It's a poorly executed performance, and I personally wish a younger and more talented actor had been cast.  The biggest disappointment for me was Isla Fisher.  I had such high hopes for this performance because I personally like her a lot and this character has so much meat, but instead she is relegated to a caricature who appears in one outlandish party scene and then, well, the car.But that brings me to one of my biggest qualms with the film as a whole; Luhrmann.  I never thought that this would be my issue, mainly because I championed him taking a bold approach, but his boldness feels so half-baked here.  I told my wife as we left the theater that I wished he had taken it all the way or not bothered to take it there at all.  He had so many visual ideas, but he left them half-developed.  The first thirty minutes or so of the film is a chaotic exploitation of modern ideas infiltrating times past and then he almost gives up on that amalgam altogether and tries to give things a more respectable air.  It creates a disjointed atmosphere that doesn't hold up.  The sad part is that both divisions are flawed in their execution as well, and so you can't even say that one half is better than the other.  The chaotic scenes lack the proper editing to make them feel exciting.  The party scenes drag on too long and become repetitive and feel high-school trashy, not visionary trashy.  I'm someone who considers Luhrmann an auteur and so I expected more from him.  The drier parts of the film, while never boring, feel like they were ripped from a completely different film done by a different actor.  They almost have an amateurish quality to them.  Luhrmann's grasp of the material itself just feels so rudimentary, so surface.He never digs deep enough, yet is contented with exploiting the obvious.Now, while I applaud the lavish sets and costumes, the use of CGI was an embarrassment.  I understand that he was trying to create layers, and maybe in a 3D world this has better effect (I saw this in 2D), but I feel that any 3D film better work in 2D, and this one just felt like it was trying too hard.  The CGI was distracting, especially in the creation of landscapes (the shots of the car driving into the grimy district were horribly cartoonish) and the obnoxious car rides and complete insistence on giving us everything gave me a headache.  While I find Luhrmann's use of music in all of his films to be exciting and inspired, there were moments here that felt a tad beneath him in execution.  It felt like he was a new director trying really, really hard to be relevant and ultimately coming off as a poser of sorts.But that Lana Del Rey song is heaven!So there you have it.  I'm in the middle here.  I'll see this again, and I can't say I'd not recommend it.  It has a lot to offer, but at the end of the day I feel as though this is lesser Luhrmann and ultimately feels like a step backwards for the director.  He doesn't mesh his directorial approaches well and delivers to us a beautifully draped, awkwardly paced and ultimately fragmented take on a stunning literary piece.",3,Not as great as I wanted it to

1512364,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B0067EKYS6,Anthony L.,"[29, 41]","The Great Gatsby, and indeed any film by directorBaz Luhrmann, is a love-it or hate-it experience. He took Shakespeare's revered tale of Romeo and Juliet, updated it to present day Miami, added six-shooters, explosions, and neon lights, but kept the source material's vibrant heart. ButRomeo + Juliet, like Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge worked. Like The Great Gatsby, they worked because they had colour, vibrant energy, an excellent cast, and Baz's typical spirit and OTT action ingrained in them.They're not perfect.The Great Gatsbyby F. Scott Fitzgerald is not just the possible holder of the mythical title ""Great American Novel"", but one of the finest works of fiction period. A haunting, caustic look at wealth, money, decadence, love, and the American Dream, The Great Gatsby, in it's 50,000 words, manages to be both vividly written, hauntingly affecting, and timelessly relevant. Go on and read it. Your English teacher was right.But how does it translate to film? Not seamlessly. I still have NO idea why it was released in 3D. This decision seems ultimately misguided; how many novels written in the Twenties are going to be released in the Third Dimension? The Catcher in the Rye? The Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z and will.i.am black rap may seem questionable to purists, and certainly jarred a large portion of the audience I watched the film with. And do we really need CGI sets and zooming shoots and kinetic driving scenes in a film about excess in the Jazz Age? One of my big gripes with the film is with the (otherwise) emotional scene in the garden between Daisy and Gatsby. We should be swept up in their tale of doomed love, and in the phenomenal acting, but whatisthat? GREEN SCREEN. Obvious, fake GREEN screen in a scene in the garden. Cheap, or was it part of Baz Luhrmann's effect?Endless debate can be sparked on these topics. The real issue for me is harder to pin down. The film...the performances...seemed so...HOLLOW. Like it was all colour and light and splendour on the outside, but inside it was empty and hollow and lifeless. Carrie Mulligan in particular felt so empty-headed and vapid.Or was this all intentional? Was Mulligan's performance intended to represent that selfsame attribute of Daisy; empty-headed, filled with faux-girlish innocence that revealed a sad, tortured girl inside? Did the emptiness of The Great Gatsby represent the hollowness of the American Dream that Nick Carraway finds so evident? Does the vapidity of the characters Gatsby and Tom and Daisy reflect the vapidity and fickleness that our narrator, Nick Carraway uncovers? I don't rightly know...But the movie wasn't terrible. The Great Gatsby has a lot of things going for it.The first half of the film has almost palpable energy. The Jazz Age was a terrific time to be alive, and Luhrmann shows us the wondrous new land of New York according to the relatively innocent Nick Carraway; cheap booze, flappers, the Charleston, riotous parties, confetti, fireworks, Jazz, big cars, grand castles, mysterious people, and lots and lots of money. In short, this is decadence and excess to the full.A pity then, that it seems to lose this vigour in the second half. Again, maybe this is intentional and it's all me. The tonal shift is abrupt - from happy to sad - but the film works on mostly thanks to it's talented cast.Leonardo DiCapriohas come far from his Titanic/Romeo + Juliet days; no longer is he the pretty boy and teenage heart-throb. This is an incredibly versatile, charismatic, talented, and potentially brilliant actor at the top of his game. Reading the book, it is almost impossible to imagine how Gatsby could be realized onscreen, so dashing and larger-than-life was he. But DiCaprio makes it happen. He is suave, charismatic, sophisticated, sympathetic, mysterious, and charming. He is also a twisted, heartbroken, often deluded and complex soul. His multi-faceted performance is another star in his crown, which includes Blood Diamond, The Departed, Django Unchained, and hopefully many more to come. We're sorry for underestimating you, Leo.Tobey Maguireis a most underrated actor, and I was sorry that I haven't seen more of him. His Nick Carraway was spot. on! Maguire captures the wide-eyed sensibility, innocence, and strong moral compass and decency of the character; not in a showy way, but in a sincere performance, becoming the focus of the audience's sympathies - Nick, who at times seems the most sane man in New York.Carrie Mulliganis a rising and incredibly talented young star. Right from the get-go, her Daisy Fay is a standout performance. She captures perfectly the Daisy from Fitzgerald's book; a sincere smile, girlish innocence, and ""a voice like money"". Her character is not always likeable, but her portrayal is subtle and should please purists of the book. I had doubts aboutJoel Edgertonas the odious Tom, but his performance was suitably animated and repelling as the boisterous and brash Tom Buchanan.Jason Clarke,Isla Fisher, and newcomer Elizabeth Debicki give standout performances in the supporting casts, whose characters are  given new life in the hands of talented thespians....I give an abnormal amount of praise to Luhrmann's talented cast, because that is what impressed me most with the film. I liked the colour that assaulted the senses, the energy almost pulsing through the films veins, the colorful and diverse score (Lana del Rey's Young and Beautiful is particularly haunting), and the subtly brilliant performances from the cast.The Great Gatsby left me feeling torn however. The enormous amounts of CGI and crane shots, coupled with the unnecessary 3D and the rap make this into a love-it or hate-it experience. I fall somewhere in between. I liked the movie. The Great Gatsby is like Tom Buchanan's riotous party early on in the film; new, original, colourful, exciting, but also hollow, misguided, and something that many people may want to stay away from.My rating? Four Eyes of T.J. Eckleburg out of five.P.S. Don't take my word for it! See it for yourself, then come back and write a comment on how you liked it. If this review was helpful to you,  give it a like!P.P.S The original, and still the best.

In fact, the movie cleared up a few things for me that were not clear when I read the book. The mansions and cars were pretty to look at. The acting was good at times.Cons: The CG effects were visually jarring. The graphics did  not look real and did not convey a sense of the era to me. All of the scenes with the cars driving looked fake to me, from the speed they were driving to the way they weaved in and out of traffic. I think the least realistic scenes may have been when the cars drove over the bridge.The director used the optometrist billboard as a backdrop for way too many scenes. In one scene it was used behind the girl getting hit by the car and because of the perspective angle it looked like she was flying fifty feet in the air. Another scene panned over the billboard across the water. Wait, wasn't the billboard next to road, or was it in front of the lake?The music was terrible. The party scenes were blaring hip hop to convey what was supposed to be a roaring 20's party. It was so out of character it was off-putting.At times I didn't think the acting was particularly good.

As the movie unfolded, I began guessing that those who put it together must have intensely studied the 1949, 1974 and 2000 versions of the same story and guided the 2013 result toward an evolved version that omitted the shortfalls that critics and reviewers assigned to the past three versions, then added strengths coming from advances in movie making often wasted on violence for the sake of violence.

Gatsby must find a way to get Daisy back, because if he doesn't, his bags of money, and all-night jazz parties won't matter. And neither will his life....Director Baz Luhrmann shot most of ""Gatsby"" in his native Australia; dazzling special effects, rock music, and plain-old magic remind you of Luhrmann's excellent ""Moulin Rouge(2001)"" and the very good ""Australia(2008)"". Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a strong, romantic  Gatsby; he does say ""old sport"" too much. And if you're a little tired, or not paying attention, you might just think you're watching the last Gatsby, Robert Redford. An old, sad love story in a mind-bending modern new format is actually very fine. Very fine. ""Gatsby picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He did not know that his dream was already behind him. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter---tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....And one fine morning---So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"".",4,The Green Door....,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,1864,"['Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'third', 'film', 'version', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', '1925', 'immortal', 'novel', 'Faithful', 'book', 'mostly', 'remake', 'David', 'Merrick', 'excellent', '1974', 'movie', 'Great', 'Gatsby', '1920', 'love', 'story', 'CG', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'well', 'Very', 'well', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'failed', '1920', 'bond', 'salesman', 'Nick', 'sanitarium', 'treat', 'anxiety', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'doctor', 'Nick', 'write', 'Write', 'stories', 'Nick', 'typewriter', 'pound', 'novel', 'Nick', 'friend', 'mysterious', 'handsome', 'millionaire', 'who', 'wore', 'pink', 'suits', 'sometimes', 'stared', 'down', 'Nick', 'mansion', 'windows', 'mostly', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'looked', 'sound', 'West', 'Egg', 'beautiful', 'home', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'one-time', 'lover', 'Gatsby', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'Daisy', 'back', ""n't"", 'bags', 'money', 'all-night', 'jazz', 'parties', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'will', 'life', '.Director', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'shot', 'most', 'Gatsby', 'native', 'Australia', 'dazzling', 'special', 'effects', 'rock', 'music', 'plain-old', 'magic', 'remind', 'Luhrmann', 'excellent', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', '2001', 'very', 'good', 'Australia', '2008', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'strong', 'romantic', 'Gatsby', 'say', 'old', 'sport', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'little', 'tired', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'might', 'just', 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'last', 'Gatsby', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'old', 'sad', 'love', 'story', 'mind-bending', 'modern', 'new', 'format', 'actually', 'very', 'fine', 'Very', 'fine', 'Gatsby', 'picked', 'out', 'green', 'light', 'end', 'Daisy', 'dock', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'dream', 'was', 'already', 'Gatsby', 'believed', 'green', 'light', 'orgastic', 'future', 'year', 'year', 'recedes', 'eluded', 'then', 'matter', '-tomorrow', 'will', 'run', 'faster', 'stretch', 'out', 'arms', 'farther', '.And', 'one', 'fine', 'morning', 'beat', 'boats', 'current', 'borne', 'back', 'ceaselessly', 'past']",The Great Gatsby 2013

I didn't want to like it because I felt that Robert Redford's 1979 version made Gatsby the vision you would expect a gazillionaire to be.

1512401,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B0067EKYS6,Brian Driver,"[4, 6]","I used to teach English 11, andThe Great Gatsbyhas always been one of my favorite books. I've taught it so many times I know many of the lines by heart. And I rented this film with some trepidation: I do not normally consider myself a Bas Luhrmann fan, and certainly wondered about his taking the reins of this sensitive, romantic movie considering the overblownMoulin Rouge, and the also overly dramatic (but more enjoyable)AustraliaandStrictly Ballroom.But as I was soon to find out, Baz Luhrman was EXACTLY the right person for this job. I thought THE GREAT GATSBY was the best treatment I've ever seen, and that includes the TV one so often overlooked. His sense of cinematic zing and dramatic exaggeration was perfect here, and I not only really enjoyed this movie, but felt he really captured much of what previous versions had failed to grasp.First off, his 1920s New York is an amazing confection, a blend of reality and the hype that caught the Jazz Age and the heyday of the pre-Depression stock market beautifully. It was more than a time machine of sorts...it was one that captured a mashup of music, wealth and style that portrayed the wild, chaotic frenzy of the pre-Crash era. It was a time of fast music, women, and cars, of bright colors and new hair and clothing styles that shocked THEIR older generation like our 60s did some four decades later. Luhrmann - a man who works well with music at the core of his films - did a great job here. (The movie won two Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design.)A really big plus this time around was the acting: while I liked Robert Redford in the earlier movie (as I have in almost everything he's in), he has always had a staid, stilted way about him in roles like this one; he carries himself like an Actor's Studio actor, saying lines ""just so,"" but not naturally. Sure, he's gorgeous, and his celebrity seemed right at the time for Gatsby, but it is under Leonardo DiCaprio's adept hand that it really becomes possible to see how perfect HE is for this role. DiCaprio is able to portray so many aspects of Gatsby perfectly: the romantic, the heroic, the vulnerable, the gangster...and they all blend seamlessly in his portrayal.But what is particularly notable is what an improvement Carey Mulligan is over Mia Farrow, who I thought more than anything else sank the 1974 movie like a lead minnow. In Mulligan's hands, Daisy is more the woman Fitzgerald invented: a woman who chose convenience over romance, a woman tired of loving a bully whose countless dalliances have made her ""cynical,"" to use her word for it, and a woman who is dearly WANTS to love yet is painfully unaware that true love might come at some price. And, more than anything else, Mulligan is a woman that a man might give up his future for, whereas Farrow's Daisy made me want to drive nails through my ears: she gave such a shrill performance I could hear dogs wailing.Additionally, the crucial part of Tom Buchanan is handled extremely well by Joel Edgerton, who has enough physical presence to be able to portray him as a hulking menace of a man...a brute. In the earlier movie he was so capably played by Bruce Dern that he masked the fact that he was so physically wrong for the part.But, to return to Luhrmann, yes, he took certain liberties...some have complained about the framing device he used of having Nick Carraway's narration be a tale told in a sanitarium. But this is one liberty that paid off well...the conceit works perfectly as a confession, of a sort, given that this is really a morality play. It is after all a tale told by a man (played well by Tobey Maguire) who is trying his best to come to terms which a remarkable summer that has changed him forever, but this idea of having him tell his story to a doctor - one who indeed urges him to give in to his literary side - and this gives it just the right angle for clever turns of phrases and verbal wordplay.Not everything is golden: some of Luhrmann's attempts come off schlocky: when Jordan Baker tells her story of Gatsby the man appears in front of an obvious green screen, though the effect does come off like a scene from an old, dated movie. And given Nick's narrator status, how are we made aware of events he clearly did not see, like a man being taken outside a gate and pummeled?But overall, Luhrmann's film is a triumph. His cinematography is outstanding: time and again the shots are timeless, postcards sent from a forgotten era, colored by a splendor that is more than a time or place...it was an evocation, a beckoning, a dream. It is a film peopled by ""careless"" people - as Nick tells us -- whose money allowed them to obey their every capricious whim - people whose station afforded them a lifestyle above morality, above having to pay for the things that others yearned for but could never afford.And most of all, it is a story about Gatsby, whose gift for boundless romance is too perfect to be sullied by this cruel world, a world he took part in so that he could touch the heart of a woman too corrupted by it to be his equal. And Luhrmann lets that shine through here, a concept captured so well in print that it's taken almost a century to capture it again, this time on film. THE GREAT GATSBY is a great turn by a director (and co-screenwriter) who has just grown by leaps and bounds in my estimation.",5,The first film Gatsby that really gets it right,1398384000,"04 25,

1512402,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0067EKYS6,Brian Maitland,"[1, 2]","The DVD gets an extra star because there is an entire extra DVD of extras! The stuff on there is all pretty good but you also realize how much Baz Luhrmann has lost the plot when you hear him talk about the movie. Basically, the guy is in dire need of someone (such as a good editor) to reign him in. The background on how he melded modern music with the music of the Jazz Age is interesting until you realize here's a guy from Australia (where bands he should know being about the right age to have come of musical age post-New Wave such as the Hoodoo Gurus, Crystal Set, Celibate Rifles, Porcelain Bus came from) has far too lamestream tastes as beyond The XX, the stuff he thinks is cutting edge is basically for the hipster college radio crew at best and the Jay-Z types at worst.That out of the way, I almost fast-forwarded the entire movie as it fell into two big traps--voiceover narration (the lazy person's way to tell a story onscreen) and had Tobey Maguire on far too long before Leonardo DiCaprio showed up and the thing finally came to life. (In the extras, check out the PBS doc and the still of F. Scott Fitzgerald in side portrait and Tobey looks like a dead ringer from the side).The colors in this movie are an assault on the eyes and only after reading it was released in 3-D did I figure out why all the fast zooms across bays or down roads were going on. Now it makes sense--it was for 3-D effect.Then in the extras you learn it was all pretty much shot on green screen. It does shows in a very odd unnatural setting especially to the party scenes in the Gatsby mansion. Everything just looks that much off.Then the B-team has been rolled out in the bit parts. We get a B-list Michelle Williams in Carey Mulligan, an B version of Amy Adams in Isla Fisher and a younger Kristin Scott Thomas B version in Elizabeth Debicki. Have a look on imdb at their pics. I swear they are all doppelgangers for those A-list actresses. OK, Debicki is a bit of a stretch but go with me on that.It's an entertaining movie but once the car accident happens I grew incredibly bored and started fast-forwarding as it just seemed to lose any momentum. Look, The Great Gatsby has been done to death onscreen and off-, did we really need another version? Plus Baz Luhrmann? Seriously? He is a musical dance guy. Last I looked The Great Gatsby is a novel not a musical play (yes, Broadway has had its claws in it as such and well, sorry, not a fan of the stage or musicals in any form).Honestly, I'd like to challenge Baz to do a movie involving no music or dance. Let's see him show off his directing chops because he falls back on this way too much.Having said all this and stated that it is entertaining for much of it, I will say that without DiCaprio this thing would have been a farce. He's the only thing in it worth watching.

It's flashy and definitely different, but I believe it tells Fitzgerald's story well in this time without really modernizing it. The acting was phenomenal, the scenes and costumes superb; the whole movie was just great.

It's funny, I expected this movie to be a lot more fantastical than it was. Usually there is lots of extra silliness in a Luhrmann film(close-ups, sound effects), but this one was toned down. It was more fitting for the novel I guess. A bit disappointing, but still okay.The reason the movie ranked higher than the book for me is two main reason. First, there was none of that Nick Carraway dithering on bits. Second, When I can see people talking I know who is talking and I don't have to re-read the same chapter ten times to figure out who's talking. Both of those things made me like this movie a lot more.This seems like an easy book to film adaptation to be able to follow the book. I mean, it only takes a couple of hours to read the book anyways. For the most part the film followed the book nicely. There were a few things that were done differently and some were okay while others I didn't like. When Nick shows up to Gatsby's first party there is a strange guy pulling Jordan away from him the whole time. It seemed to set up a connection between Nick and Jordan that didn't happen again in the film. It was a bit strange but okay.One thing that drove me a little crazy was the ""Old Sport"" thing. In the film it sounded like ""Old Spore"". Why? Why was DiCaprio pronouncing it like that. It's probably the way that it's supposed to be pronounced, but there is a ""t"" in there!

1512414,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0067EKYS6,C. B Collins Jr.,"[7, 11]","This is a terrible interpretation of the famous novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. If I could give it zero stars I certainly would. Baz Luhrmann, the director, has remained true to the basic story and plot of the novel, but his selection of actors, the performances they deliver, and the tacky eye-slime that he has provided undermine the entire production.Because the sets and party scenes have received so much attention, I think it best to point out that they are too slick, too silly, and too shiny. Did every flapper in 1922 dance the Charleston as if they were a professional Broadway dancer? I think not. In the real world bad dancers mix with good dancers on any real world dance floor, but not here. Instead we have perfect dancers acting outrageously while not missing a step in scenes that scream artificiality. Every polished floor or car, every drape or staircase or sofa is overdone. Gatsby wished to achieve what the wealthy had attained as part of his quest for Daisy, so why would he have fallen for such glaringly overdone hotel lobby d&eacute;cor?In all fairness, Leonardo DiCaprio does a fair job of playing Gatsby, but unfortunately he is compared to Robert Redford's interpretation which is much more subtle and nuanced. Robert Redford play Gatsby as a tragic character who has pursued an illusion thinking that he has pursued his dream and in the final swimming pool scene the tragedy of expectations unmet is evident. DiCaprio is more surface and less substance in his performance so that in the final swimming pool scene the viewer thinks that another floating pool adornment has popped.Luhrmann misses the point as to what The Great Gatsby is really all about while he follows the basic story or plot line. He misses the sadness and burden of unrealized dreams.  It is also about classism which Luhrmann never captures. Joel Edgerton does a passable job playing Tom Buchanan, but his performance does not hold a candle to Bruce Dern's excellent performance in an earlier version of Gatsby. The wealthy can use their power for insulation, for insurance against harm, for keeping reality away, and most importantly, for getting their way. Dern captures this aspect of wealthy in a way that Edgerton misses.Tobey Maguire is an awkward Nick Carraway and his performance is almost silly in comparison to the more natural performance of Sam Waterston in an earlier version of Gatsby. Maquire plays Carraway as a wide-eyed intrusive, almost adolescent, intrusive observer whereas Waterston plays Carraway with more intelligence, natural grace, more worldly reflection and experience. Maguire plays Carraway like a newly hatched chicken, staring at the drama around him, never relaxing, never fitting in with any social ease. Waterston plays a young man but he has the background and intelligence to put the drama that is unfolding before his eyes in perspective. Isla Fisher does a passing job playing Myrtle Wilson but her performance does not compare to the outstanding job done by Karen Black in the previous version. Black dripped desire and vulnerability whereas Fisher was over dressed and doll-like, a piece on a chess board and not a real person in a real tragedy. But the worst performance of all would have to be Carey Mulligan playing Daisy Buchanan. Mulligan is unfortunately compared to Mia Farrow and comes up very short. Mulligan never captures the real vulnerability, the underlying fear, the neurosis just under the surface that Farrow captures in Daisy. Daisy is a crushable flower, she is not strong, she make poor choices, she wants to be directed and told what to do and Farrow captures this essence whereas Mulligan plays Daisy as a pretty ordinary girl who happens to be rich, happens to have selected the wrong husband, and now is in a fix as she falls for her old boyfriend.F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in a world of struggle, hardship, and competition before he was introduced to the world of fame, glamour, and wealth. He knew that the rich play by different rules, they win, they take it all, they leave nothing, they are cunning, they use you up and throw you away. Tom Buchanan is the personification of this process yet it underlies the personal tragedy of the story. Poor people die and rich people go on cruises. Fitzgerald has this as a structural theme in his novel but Luhrmann completely misses this point.Are Redford, Farrow, Dern, Black and Waterston that much more accomplished as actors than DiCaprio, Mulligan, Edgerton, Maguire, and Fisher? Maybe so but the fault in this failed interpretation lies at the feet of an insensitive director, Luhrmann.",1,"This version is terrible, watch the Redford and Farrow version instead",1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,4602,"['terrible', 'interpretation', 'famous', 'novel', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'could', 'give', 'zero', 'stars', 'certainly', 'would', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'director', 'remained', 'true', 'basic', 'story', 'plot', 'novel', 'selection', 'actors', 'performances', 'deliver', 'tacky', 'eye-slime', 'provided', 'undermine', 'entire', 'production.Because', 'sets', 'party', 'scenes', 'have', 'received', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'think', 'best', 'point', 'out', 'are', 'too', 'slick', 'too', 'silly', 'too', 'shiny', 'Did', 'flapper', '1922', 'dance', 'Charleston', 'were', 'professional', 'Broadway', 'dancer', 'think', 'not', 'real', 'world', 'bad', 'dancers', 'mix', 'good', 'dancers', 'real', 'world', 'dance', 'floor', 'not', 'here', 'Instead', 'have', 'perfect', 'dancers', 'acting', 'outrageously', 'not', 'missing', 'step', 'scenes', 'scream', 'artificiality', 'polished', 'floor', 'car', 'drape', 'staircase', 'sofa', 'overdone', 'Gatsby', 'wished', 'achieve', 'what', 'wealthy', 'had', 'attained', 'part', 'quest', 'Daisy', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'such', 'glaringly', 'overdone', 'hotel', 'lobby', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'fairness', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'fair', 'job', 'playing', 'Gatsby', 'unfortunately', 'compared', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'interpretation', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'play', 'Gatsby', 'tragic', 'character', 'who', 'pursued', 'illusion', 'thinking', 'pursued', 'dream', 'final', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scene', 'tragedy', 'expectations', 'unmet', 'evident', 'DiCaprio', 'more', 'surface', 'less', 'substance', 'performance', 'so', 'final', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scene', 'viewer', 'floating', 'pool', 'adornment', 'popped.Luhrmann', 'point', 'what', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'really', 'basic', 'story', 'plot', 'line', 'sadness', 'burden', 'unrealized', 'dreams', 'also', 'classism', 'Luhrmann', 'never', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'passable', 'job', 'playing', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'performance', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'excellent', 'performance', 'earlier', 'version', 'Gatsby', 'wealthy', 'can', 'use', 'power', 'insulation', 'insurance', 'harm', 'keeping', 'reality', 'away', 'most', 'importantly', 'getting', 'way', 'Dern', 'aspect', 'wealthy', 'way', 'Edgerton', 'misses.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'awkward', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'performance', 'almost', 'silly', 'comparison', 'more', 'natural', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'earlier', 'version', 'Gatsby', 'Maquire', 'Carraway', 'wide-eyed', 'intrusive', 'almost', 'adolescent', 'intrusive', 'observer', 'Waterston', 'Carraway', 'more', 'intelligence', 'natural', 'grace', 'more', 'worldly', 'reflection', 'experience', 'Maguire', 'Carraway', 'newly', 'hatched', 'chicken', 'staring', 'drama', 'never', 'relaxing', 'never', 'fitting', 'social', 'ease', 'Waterston', 'young', 'man', 'background', 'intelligence', 'put', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'eyes', 'perspective', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'passing', 'job', 'playing', 'Myrtle', 'Wilson', 'performance', 'not', 'compare', 'outstanding', 'job', 'done', 'Karen', 'Black', 'previous', 'version', 'Black', 'dripped', 'desire', 'vulnerability', 'whereas', 'Fisher', 'was', 'dressed', 'doll-like', 'piece', 'chess', 'board', 'not', 'real', 'person', 'real', 'tragedy', 'worst', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'playing', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'Mulligan', 'unfortunately', 'compared', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'up', 'very', 'short', 'Mulligan', 'never', 'real', 'vulnerability', 'underlying', 'fear', 'neurosis', 'just', 'surface', 'Farrow', 'Daisy', 'Daisy', 'crushable', 'flower', 'not', 'strong', 'make', 'poor', 'choices', 'be', 'directed', 'told', 'what', 'do', 'Farrow', 'captures', 'essence', 'whereas', 'Mulligan', 'Daisy', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'rich', 'have', 'selected', 'wrong', 'husband', 'now', 'fix', 'old', 'boyfriend.F', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'lived', 'world', 'struggle', 'hardship', 'competition', 'was', 'introduced', 'world', 'fame', 'glamour', 'wealth', 'knew', 'rich', 'play', 'different', 'rules', 'win', 'take', 'leave', 'nothing', 'are', 'cunning', 'use', 'throw', 'away', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'personification', 'process', 'yet', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'story', 'Poor', 'people', 'die', 'rich', 'people', 'go', 'cruises', 'Fitzgerald', 'structural', 'theme', 'novel', 'Luhrmann', 'completely', 'point.Are', 'Redford', 'Farrow', 'Dern', 'Black', 'Waterston', 'much', 'more', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'DiCaprio', 'Mulligan', 'Edgerton', 'Maguire', 'Fisher', 'Maybe', 'so', 'fault', 'failed', 'interpretation', 'feet', 'insensitive', 'director', 'Luhrmann']",The Great Gatsby 2013

1512421,A3KZLC8UFCQ8NU,B0067EKYS6,cherryblueberry,"[6, 9]","I actually started this book and gave up on it, because it was just too ""wordy"" and therefore a bit boring. (Why do some of these books become ""classics""?  I just don't know).  Anyway, I realize the book was written in the ""style"" of the times, and ""keep it pithy"" was not their motto.  So I decided to try the movie, just out  of curiosity.  And besides, I like Leonardo!Well!  I was sort of mezmorized, sort of shocked, and sort of turned off a little (too much rap - more on that later).  One thing I WASN'T, was bored! This movie never drags - not once.  Although it may appear a bit frantic and disjointed, it's actually very easy to follow since a lot of it is narrated by the main character (played by Toby Macquire).In the movie, which is set in 1922, a frustrated writer goes to live in NY, and becomes a bonds trader.  He happens to live right next door to Jay Gatsby, a mysterious guy (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who dwells in a huge mansion and throws lavish parties every weekend.  There is cheating, there is a compelling love story, and there is (obviously) loads of sex, although they never actually ""show"" anything....while Toby MacQuire's character is sort of an ""observer"" of it all.  Eventually, he becomes friends with this mysterious Gatsby, and learns all his secrets.And, there is also....rap?  Rap in the 20's?  I remember thinking...whhhaaaaat????  This doesn't belong here!  I think the movie would have been much better if they had adhered to musical pieces from that time-frame...there are plenty of rioutous jazzy tunes to choose from, I'm sure.  It was the roaring 20's, after all.  The rap music was just weird...it didn't fit...and it sort of takes you out of the movie.  Why not stick to music of the times?  Why are we just catering to teens and people in their early 20's all the time?  Why not just do what's right for the movie?  Anyway, that was really my main problem with the movie, although I just convinced myself to ""go with it.""Also, I wish there had been more character development.  Maybe the main character could have told us a little more about his feelings - even if that wasn't in the original story, they could have added it in.Other than these problems, I did enjoy the movie for what it's worth....this version of The Great Gatsby is unique, interesting, and ""larger than life.""  Plus,like I said, it is definitely NOT boring!  There is a loose plot, so be patien, even if the movie seems a bit ""plotless"" at first.This movie is worth seeing, whether you've read the book or not.  I am glad we bought it, because I probably will watch it again.

1512425,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0067EKYS6,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","I was fully prepared to see another movie where Hollywood's cash of directors spent their entire wad of creativity on special effects and over-the-topness, and they certainly did. After all, this is a movie based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;, a story of decadence, excess and circumstance. Yet, Director Baz Luhrman (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet) delivered an equal amount of substance and character with his beautiful painting.Luhrman delivered the largeness and decadence that the movie deserved, but also delivered upon the small world that Gatsby has embedded himself in. Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a character of great mystery. He has huge decadent parties, yet nobody truly knows the man. While Luhrman's cameras sweep and swoop through Gatsby's lavish party of dance and drink, we feel the moment like it should and at the same time, we feel Gatsby's emptiness when he stands alone against the backdrop of his amazing mansion. Luhrman's atmosphere, at times, was allowed to do the talking and the great actors chewed up the rest of it.The cinematography of &#34;Gatsby&#34; is absolutely brilliant and the 3D that goes with it is vital. You have to feel that depth and largeness to truly feel the world that surrounds Gatsby. It is proof that 3D doesn't have to be in your face to be effective. The depth of it gives you the feeling of being there and it is absolutely beautiful. The ocean water that separates Gatsby from the mansions across the way, the deep shots of New York City in its early stages and the exploding confetti and dance during the party scenes are all so perfectly done but at the same time chaotic and consuming; drawing you into the world.I didn't think I would be saying this, but Luhrman's film is near perfect. It is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen. What really puts it over the top though is the quality of the actors involved. Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke and Isla Fischer were all perfect. Watching DiCaprio bring Gatsby to life makes me wonder how this guy has gone without an Oscar so far. He has become something great, if he was ever anything less.&#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is what going to the movies is all about. It brought the beautiful words of F. Scott Fitzgerald to life in its own unique and beautiful way. It is pure escapism. I can honestly say I was riveted from beginning to end. Earlier I stated that the film was `near perfect' and I have to say, there were a few instances where my mind left the roaring 20's. Twice the movie soundtrack, produced by Jay-Z, was horribly too 21st century. Instead of using music from the era, they used two rap songs that shook me from the dream that I had fallen into and reminded me that this was a 21st century movie made by 21st century actors and directors. Fortunately, those moments were fleeting and the escapism dream continued. Honestly though, that is the only blemish I spotted in a mostly flawless film.This is also a 3D movie masterpiece and if you have the means to watch this in 3D; do it.

Since this is text, allow me to be very obvious with the emphasis...this is a review of **Baz Luhrmann's** Gatsby. If you are expecting a movie that is true to the book, you WILL be disappointed. Mr Luhrmann has taken license with this movie that may irritate some, and I have already seen many reviews to that effect. Are these reviews wrong? Absolutely not!! People are free to dislike a movie as much as they are to love it! I have enjoyed reading the criticisms, perhaps more so than I did when reading several un-reasoned gushes that have appeared in various publications. Now, on to the review. A small preface: this will not be a blow-by-blow account of the movie, there are many synopses you can read for that. This is my (hopefully) reasoned analysis of what makes this a good movie...for me. I hope that this review will encourage some to see what might become a favorite for them, and for those who didn't enjoy the movie, I hope this presents a balanced view of its merits without the usual ""omg I love this movieee!!!"".Note: I will be purchasing the DVD as soon as it becomes available and will update my review to comment on quality and content of said format!There are several factors that have led me to this positive review. The first, and perhaps most important, is that despite having read and enjoyed Fitzgerald's book several times, I cannot say that it is a classic that I have a lot of attachment to. Allow me to explain: I am particularly fond of Arthur Miller's tragedies. I have read them, fallen in love with them, and even wrote my AP English final essay on Miller's tragic heroes. If a director took a lot of license with an interpretation of Miller's works, I may take issue. With TGG however, I do not have this close bond. I enjoy the story, I enjoy Fitzgerald's fantastic writing, but without that emotional connection I think I was more free to enjoy the movie in its own right. If The Great Gatsby was one of your favorites, and you do not believe that it should be changed, this probably won't be a movie you will appreciate. You would be entitled to this, but for the sake of argument (and to understand my review), this is an important point.The second factor that led me to enjoy this movie is that I have an appreciation for Luhrmann's overal style. Now, this is highly personal, and many do not enjoy his carnival-type use of colors, movement and sound. As another reviewer mentioned (and hit the nail on the head), it is almost cartoonish. As with Baz' Romeo & Juliet, as well as with Moulin Rouge, his direction is almost parody-like, often putting ideals over character portrayals. If 'muted' and 'understated' are words you enjoy in connection with a film, this probably won't be the movie for you. To give a more tangible example; if your definition of cinematographical magic is more in line with the work of Roberto Benigni's 'La Vita &eacute; Bella', you may find Luhrmann's brand of magic too brash. My wife came with me to see this movie for date night - she found that the movie was at times ""too much"" to handle in terms of audio and visual stimulation. I can absolutely see how this would be true for some.The third and final overall factor, was the acting of the two male leads. I went to this movie with some trepidation - though I absolutely enjoy Di Caprio's acting abilities, I have to admit that I usually do not enjoy Maguire's performances. I cannot really explain why, I simply have found no connection with him as an actor over the years. I am pleased to say that this movie changed this for me. My personal opinion is that Leonardo Di Caprio nailed Gatsby. Richard Brody of The New Yorker disagrees (in a very well-written review easily found via Google), but I think that Di Caprio's performance embodies Fitzgerald's own description of Gatsby, that is """"an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd."" At first I was annoyed by the two teenagers sitting in front of us, chortling every time ""old sport"" was said, but then I realized that they had inadvertently UNDERSTOOD - Gatsby is living a lie, keeping up appearances, and is doing so in a manner that is bordering on absurd. Initially presented as being almost mythical in social stature, Di Caprio does a great job at portraying a ""nobody"" watching his lie fall apart around him. As I mentioned, I was a little worried about Maguire, but he gave me a new understanding of the short-lived naivet&eacute; inherent in Carraway's character, and for that I am grateful. In real life, Maguire seems to have a perennial ""green"" way about him - he's 37 and yet has a youthfulness (not immaturity) that only helped convince me when playing Carraway.Now, on to what I didn't like about the movie. Keeping in line with Luhrmann's modus operandi, popular music features prominently in this adaptation. While not inherently a bad thing, I feel as though it was almost done a little *too* enthusiastically this time around. In Moulin Rouge, Baz shook up the industry by reinterpreting classics, a bold move that was applauded by some and despised by others. This time around I felt as though he was almost pandering to younger viewers by incorporating a lot of pop music. Perhaps I'm being unfair, but I don't feel as though such a classic tale with timeless attraction needs help to be relevant for today's viewers. The second thing that was a little irksome was the performance of Joel Edgerton and Carey Mulligan as Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Despite acting the parts relatively well, I felt as though they lacked the multi-dimensional layers of character that their screen-mates achieved. In very simplistic terms, their portrayal was too clean and single-faceted.Overall, was the movie perfect? Definitely not. Were there some areas that were ""overkill""? Absolutely. That said, I have to be honest and say that I really enjoyed the movie as a whole. I appreciated the visual representation of the dichotomy between rich and poor, between black and white. I enjoyed the strong historical context presented, without which the book itself does not make sense. The dialogue was clever in its own right, often funny and rarely boring. Again, if you are not expecting an interpretation of the book, you most likely be disappointed, but if you go into this expecting one artist (Luhrmann) interpreting another's art (Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby) I think you might be pleasantly surprised. Despite maintaining strong allusions to the symbolism and emotional ""messiness"" found in the book, I personally feel as though the ""repeating the past"" theme was only briefly touched on and not given the weight that I found it to have in the book. Usually I am not surprised when story lines are given preferential treatment over bigger-picture philosophical ideas on screen, but I have to say that I expected more from Luhrmann who usually tackles these head on. Though open discussion of sociology/philosophy was slightly lacking, I think the film did a great job at presenting the ideas of extravagance, deceit and love for further internal reflection, allowing each viewer to come to their own conclusions.One final note: I did not see this movie in 3D, nor do I intend on doing so. There are some movies (like Toy Story 3) that make good use of 3D as a ""fun factor"", but I feel as though a classic such as The Great Gatsby does not need it, and I suspect it was done because 3D movies are ""in"" right now...I'm not saying you must rush out and see this movie tonight, but I think it has enough entertainment and substance to be worth a few hours of your time.",4,"Baz

1512432,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B0067EKYS6,CinemaMinor,"[9, 14]","The 1974 film adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" starring Mia Farrow and Robert Redford shines in comparison to this Baz Luhrmann interpretation.  That's not to say that Carey Mulligan and Leonardo DiCaprio as former flames Daisy and Gatsby (respectively) didn't do a very good job.  Tobey Maguire as Daisy's cousin, Nick (also the film's narrator) did especially excellent work attempting to add depth to a very shallow production. But overall, this movie is more spectacle than substance.  Seemingly taking for granted that everyone is familiar with the story of a ""self-made"" man trying to recapture the past and steal the woman he lost years ago away from her ""old money"" husband and lifestyle on Long Island, NY -- relationships and characters are not developed at all.  Instead, the movie focuses on frenetic visuals and relies on Nick's voice over to provide the narrative.I streamed the movie in HD and it is quite lush and beautiful; however, it is also obvious that it was shot to be viewed in 3-D and images frequently seemed to be coming at me from the TV.  In addition, the camera has a very limited atttention span for most of the movie, jumping from image to image, scene to scene at a frenzied pace.  This works kind of okay during high-energy party scenes (of which there are too many) or when cars are racing down the road, but the roller-coaster-ride-like editing significantly detracts from any actual story telling (of which there is too little).  The juxtaposition of Fitzgerald's ripe and serious words with over-the-top scenery, staging and cinematography makes the whole thing seem farcical.  Fitzgerald sometimes worked as a Hollywood screenwriter, but he meant for ""The Great Gatsby"" to be his great American novel; ultimatey, the pages of a book may just be the medium for which his story is best-suited.There are glimpses of the story's heart in the movie.  The best scene is when Gatsby reveals his relationship with Daisy to her husband in front of Daisy, Nick, and their friend, Jordan (played very entertainingly by Elizabeth Debicki). The camera finally takes a back seat and the actors are allowed to meaningfully interact with each other.  And again, Tobey Maguire is quite adept at conveying his point of view in every scene he's in, even if he has no lines and is being upstaged by grandiose sets or the 21st century soundtrack, which is so out of place.If you're familiar with the novel (and if you're not you may feel lost watching this movie), you'll notice that this screenplay takes quite a few liberties.  It is ironic that the movie ends with Nick reciting the last words of the book verbatim, which convey what the story is supposed to be about: the elusive American dream that we continue to believe in long after the possibility of realizing it has faded.  Fitzgerald made it clear that Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy is a metaphor for this. The problem is, the two hours plus of the movie that precede those final words need to support that, and they don't.  Instead, they convey that the 1920's were actually roaring.  Yes, the ambience of the movie does a good job of portraying the opulance and ""anything goes"" mentality of the Jazz Age.  But that ambience consumes everything, including any social/moral commentary because it's hard to take seriously anything that's so over-the-top.  Personally, this period in American history boasts my favorite architecture and fashion, but too much is too much!  The movie also would have been better served by keeping references to bootlegging and criminal activity as subdued as they were in the book; Gatsby comes off too much like a gangster here, making Nick's elevation of him odd.It would have been interesting, given that the themes of the story carry through to today, if Baz Luhrmann had updated the time period and not just the score, and explored what a 21st Century Gatsby would look like.  But the creativity in this Gatsby lies in the choice of upstaging the story with spectacle; if you choose to watch it, do so for that or you'll be disappointed.  I might have enjoyed it better if I'd seen it in a theatre.",2,More spectacle than substance,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,4109,"['1974', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'starring', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'comparison', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'interpretation', 'not', 'say', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'former', 'flames', 'Daisy', 'Gatsby', 'respectively', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Daisy', 'cousin', 'Nick', 'also', 'film', 'narrator', 'did', 'especially', 'excellent', 'work', 'attempting', 'add', 'depth', 'very', 'shallow', 'production', 'overall', 'movie', 'more', 'spectacle', 'substance', 'Seemingly', 'taking', 'granted', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'story', 'self-made', 'man', 'trying', 'recapture', 'past', 'steal', 'woman', 'lost', 'years', 'ago', 'away', 'old', 'money', 'husband', 'lifestyle', 'Long', 'Island', 'NY', 'relationships', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'Instead', 'movie', 'frenetic', 'visuals', 'relies', 'Nick', 'voice', 'provide', 'narrative.I', 'streamed', 'movie', 'HD', 'quite', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'however', 'also', 'obvious', 'was', 'shot', 'be', 'viewed', '3-D', 'images', 'frequently', 'seemed', 'be', 'coming', 'TV', 'addition', 'camera', 'very', 'limited', 'atttention', 'span', 'most', 'movie', 'jumping', 'image', 'image', 'scene', 'scene', 'frenzied', 'pace', 'kind', 'okay', 'high-energy', 'party', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'when', 'cars', 'are', 'racing', 'down', 'road', 'roller-coaster-ride-like', 'editing', 'significantly', 'actual', 'story', 'telling', 'too', 'little', 'juxtaposition', 'Fitzgerald', 'ripe', 'serious', 'words', 'over-the-top', 'scenery', 'staging', 'cinematography', 'whole', 'thing', 'seem', 'farcical', 'Fitzgerald', 'sometimes', 'worked', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'meant', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'be', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'pages', 'book', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'medium', 'story', 'best-suited.There', 'are', 'glimpses', 'story', 'heart', 'movie', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'Gatsby', 'relationship', 'Daisy', 'husband', 'front', 'Daisy', 'Nick', 'friend', 'Jordan', 'played', 'very', 'entertainingly', 'Elizabeth', 'Debicki', 'camera', 'finally', 'back', 'seat', 'actors', 'are', 'allowed', 'meaningfully', 'interact', 'other', 'again', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'quite', 'adept', 'conveying', 'point', 'view', 'scene', 'even', 'lines', 'being', 'upstaged', 'grandiose', 'sets', '21st', 'century', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'place.If', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'novel', ""'re"", 'not', 'may', 'feel', 'lost', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'few', 'liberties', 'ironic', 'movie', 'Nick', 'reciting', 'last', 'words', 'book', 'verbatim', 'convey', 'what', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'elusive', 'American', 'dream', 'continue', 'believe', 'long', 'possibility', 'realizing', 'faded', 'Fitzgerald', 'made', 'clear', 'Gatsby', 'pursuit', 'Daisy', 'metaphor', 'problem', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'precede', 'final', 'words', 'need', 'support', 'do', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'convey', '1920', 'were', 'actually', 'roaring', 'Yes', 'ambience', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'opulance', 'anything', 'mentality', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'ambience', 'consumes', 'everything', 'including', 'social/moral', 'commentary', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'anything', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'Personally', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'boasts', 'favorite', 'architecture', 'fashion', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'keeping', 'references', 'bootlegging', 'criminal', 'activity', 'as', 'subdued', 'were', 'book', 'Gatsby', 'off', 'too', 'much', 'gangster', 'here', 'making', 'Nick', 'elevation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'given', 'themes', 'story', 'carry', 'today', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'had', 'updated', 'time', 'period', 'not', 'just', 'score', 'explored', 'what', '21st', 'Century', 'Gatsby', 'would', 'look', 'creativity', 'Gatsby', 'choice', 'upstaging', 'story', 'spectacle', 'choose', 'watch', 'do', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'might', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'better', ""'d"", 'seen', 'theatre']",The Great Gatsby 2013
1512433,ACJVGDN8G386P,B0067EKYS6,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 2]","If there is one glaring problem of this otherwise very good adaption of Fitzgerald's most famous novel, the post-production music soundtrack editors are the guilty party. For about the first half of the film, the party scenes which provide the backdrop to this story of the Lost Generation and moneyed inequity during 1920's New York is inundated with super sounds of the 21st century, replete with Rap and Hip-Pop. It's as if the filmmakers were afraid that using music from the era, called the Roaring 20's and the Jazz Age for obvious reasons, wouldn't be &#34;intense&#34; enough for modern audiences.The music from this era, which saw the rise of Jazz from its beginnings in New Orleans and into white culture, is some of the most intense party music ever written and recorded. Instead the filmmakers balked and settled on music which would have never existed in the post World War I era. Duke Ellington, Paul Whiteman, Fletcher Henderson and the immortal Louis Armstrong could bellow on acoustic instruments probably with bigger and more robust sounds than any generic hip-pop musician of today. The sounds accompanying the popping of champagne bottles will be forever fused together. Fitzgerald even wrote a book called &#34;Tales of the Jazz Age&#34; not &#34;Tales of the Hip-Pop Age&#34;.That being said, aside from the questionable music choices, the film is a reasonably good adaption of a story which is nearly un-filmable but has become the 20th-century American novel by which all others are judged. The stand out is without question Leonardo DiCaprio who almost single-handedly saves the entire project. In fact it may be the best DiCaprio performance to date, possibly worthy of an acting nomination. The rest of the cast is strong as well particularly Tobey Maguire as the straight man Nick Carraway.The movie begins almost like a music video with lots of quick cuts and slow-mo's to the rap and hip-pop which doesn't fit very well with the era it is trying to portray. However, about a third way through, the acting begins to hit its stride and the silly pop music finally starts to wain. Although the story references the crazy parties of the era, it's not about the parties per se, but about the strange love triangle between Daisy Buchanan and her two loves, Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan.Jay Gatsby is the &#34;new money&#34; on the block who holds lavish parties where all the elites of New York come to West Egg to douse themselves with champagne (currently illegal, but what the hell), splash around in swimming pools and throw tinsel in the air for reasons not completely explained except possibly to see if it sticks on the many statues on Gatsby's estate. In this film, Gatby's house rings of an Italian manor house a la the Renaissance which might make a member of the Medicis take notice. The narrator is Nick Carraway, living in a humbler house near Gatsby's servants' entrance, who watches but does not participate actively in the events which follow. The Eyes of Dr Eckleburg, like the eyes of God, are there on a poster in the Valley of Ashes, the industrial and working class area between New York City and the suburbs of East and West Egg. The story concerns how &#34;Nouveau Riche&#34; Gatsby plans to court his former lover, Daisy Buchanan from the clutches of the Old Money, Tom Buchanan, who is probably worth the equivalent of about 9 Windsors.Despite a number of reservations, such as the music soundtrack, the strange book ends with Carraway telling his story to a psychiatrist at some kind of half-way house (in the book he is disappointed but not mentally disturbed), and the character of Jordan significantly reduced, the adaption is reasonably good. And the performance by DiCaprio as the anxious ladder-climber who wants desperately to fit into the world of elite money, is outstanding. DiCaprio finds the delicate balance between friendliness, phoniness, and ultimate anxiety which is what makes Gatsby one of the quintessential tragic heroes of American literature. His may be the best portrayal of Gatsby ever on screen thus far. Carey Mulligan also makes a fine Daisy, who is not a bad person but only rather flighty and longing for love and fun.

Aussie director Baz Luhrmann was an awesome choice to head this project. He captures the spectacle of the novel and its age better than any other I can imagine.  It&#8217;s reminiscent of his earlier works &#8220;Romeo + Juliet&#8221; and &#8220;Moulin Rouge!&#8221;  The best aspect of the film is the cinematography: the sets, fashion, jewelry, etc. are executed to perfection.The cast is excellent; DiCaprio owns this role as much as any he&#8217;s played.  Tobey Maguire is great as well; he&#8217;s as effective as Sam Waterston was in the 1974 version. I&#8217;ve always thought he owned that role. Robert Redford was good in that version. He&#8217;s not the actor that DiCaprio is. But he certainly looked the part. Carey Mulligan surprised me how well she played Daisy Buchanan, although after seeing her performance in &#8220;An Education,&#8221; I knew she was destined for greatness.Summing up what I liked and what I didn&#8217;t is almost as simple as the film&#8217;s emphasis on style over substance. That emphasis encompasses the whole jazz age, so that the film portrays that should come as no surprise. Everyone and everything as seen through the eyes of Nick, the narrator, is completely superficial. As an indictment of the near-universal values of the era, this film really works. I did not like much of the soundtrack. It was distracting and anachronistic, just a device to relate the jazz age material to the hip hop generation. Luhrmann&#8217;s Gatsby is certainly visually stunning and undeniably entertaining, but I think the &#8220;update&#8221; detracts from the real power of the story.One final note: The DVD&#8217;s special features are excellent. They answer the &#8220;why&#8221; about many aspects of the production.

1512438,AFUHVCBFHXB89,B0067EKYS6,Colonel D,"[11, 12]","Perhaps because I grew up on Long Island Sound in Connecticut, and F. Scott Fitzgerald penned his literary masterpiece, &#8220;The Great Gatsby&#8221; in my home town, it is my favorite work of American literature.  I thought the 1970&#8217;s movie version of the film was OK but felt Mia Farrow was miscast as Daisy.  From the reviews of the 2013 adaption I knew it was largely a flop but wanted to see for myself what a contemporary director might turn out.From the get-go with it&#8217;s anachronistic hip-hop musical score by Jay Z, Baz Luhrmann, proceeds to lay waste to this classic story.  I should have known from seeing the stomach churning trailers for &#8220;Moulin Rouge&#8221; that this would be more of the same.  Garish, over the top, over produced, and under edited Lurhrmann&#8217;s Gatsby is clearly aimed at a nation of people who won&#8217;t read anything longer than 140 characters, and never read the book.  Fitzgerald&#8217;s book relies on expert mastery of the language and is full of subtle imagery and intelligent dialog; you&#8217;ll get none of that here but snippets.  The vehicle of using poorly cast Toby Maguire&#8217;s character Nick reliving the tragic events by way of a therapeutic journal writing exercise at an alcohol rehab clinic is tiresome.CGI for a film such as this should be unnecessary but for whatever reason it&#8217;s used extensively and to poor effect.  The wardrobe budget would feed a third world country for a year.  Gatsby&#8217;s walking stick and oversized pinky ring are creations of this film, he was a bootlegger, but not a pimp.  His car in the novel is described as being a &#8220;cream yellow with a green leather interior&#8221;, not this screaming yellow nightmare that he drives like he stole it.  Every scene is a study in excess and overly choreographed.Casting is everything after the screenplay and no one fits their role well in Luhrmann&#8217;s interpretation.  Leonardo DiCaprio looks uncomfortable in this part, maybe because he lacks the background to play such a rags-to-riches fellow who is full of hope and haunted by his past?  All I know is that using the affectation &#8220;old sport&#8221; every other line doesn&#8217;t make him Gatsby.  JG certainly says that phrase in the book but not to the extent Leo does and it wears thin very quickly.I never heard of Carey Mulligan and while at least in terms of appearance she&#8217;s an improvement on Mia Farrow.  Here is a character who is supposed to be so compelling that she drives our protagonist to expend vast sums of money and make grand gestures all with the aim of winning her favor and winding back the clock to when they were first together.  Off hand I can&#8217;t think of an actress who could convey that beauty and desirability but it&#8217;s not Ms. Mulligan.Joel Edgerton didn&#8217;t seem physically big enough for the role of the brutish Tom Buchanan (DiCaprio&#8217;s an inch taller according ti IMDB).  Jordan Baker&#8217;s part in the story was watered down and forgettable while Isla Fischer does a decent job with what little she gets to do as Myrtle Wilson, Tom&#8217;s mistress.Fans of the novel will mostly be irritated at the details that are wrong.  For example they go through the trouble of pointing out Wolfscheim&#8217;s tie pin which is made from a human molar, but it&#8217;s actually his cufflinks- why change this?  Bottom line, purists who cherish F. Scott Fitzgerald&#8217;s work should avoid Lurhmann&#8217;s tedious flick.",1,Gatsby rendered not so great,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,3493,"['Perhaps', 'grew', 'up', 'Long', 'Island', 'Sound', 'Connecticut', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'penned', 'literary', 'masterpiece', '8220', 'Great', 'Gatsby', '8221', 'home', 'town', 'favorite', 'work', 'American', 'literature', 'thought', '1970', '8217', 's', 'movie', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'OK', 'felt', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'was', 'miscast', 'Daisy', 'reviews', '2013', 'adaption', 'knew', 'was', 'largely', 'flop', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'contemporary', 'director', 'might', 'turn', 'out.From', 'get-go', '8217', 's', 'anachronistic', 'hip-hop', 'musical', 'score', 'Jay', 'Z', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'proceeds', 'lay', 'waste', 'classic', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'seeing', 'stomach', 'churning', 'trailers', '8220', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', '8221', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'Garish', 'top', 'produced', 'edited', 'Lurhrmann', '8217', 'Gatsby', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'nation', 'people', 'who', 'won', '8217', 'read', 'anything', 'longer', '140', 'characters', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 'book', 'relies', 'expert', 'mastery', 'language', 'full', 'subtle', 'imagery', 'intelligent', 'dialog', '8217', 'get', 'none', 'here', 'snippets', 'vehicle', 'using', 'poorly', 'cast', 'Toby', 'Maguire', '8217', 's', 'character', 'Nick', 'reliving', 'tragic', 'events', 'way', 'therapeutic', 'journal', 'writing', 'exercise', 'alcohol', 'rehab', 'clinic', 'tiresome.CGI', 'film', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'reason', '8217', 's', 'used', 'extensively', 'poor', 'effect', 'wardrobe', 'budget', 'would', 'feed', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'year', 'Gatsby', '8217', 'walking', 'stick', 'oversized', 'pinky', 'ring', 'are', 'creations', 'film', 'was', 'bootlegger', 'not', 'pimp', 'car', 'novel', 'described', 'being', '8220', 'cream', 'yellow', 'green', 'leather', 'interior', '8221', 'not', 'screaming', 'yellow', 'nightmare', 'stole', 'scene', 'study', 'excess', 'overly', 'choreographed.Casting', 'everything', 'screenplay', 'one', 'role', 'well', 'Luhrmann', '8217', 's', 'interpretation', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'uncomfortable', 'part', 'maybe', 'background', 'play', 'such', 'rags-to-riches', 'fellow', 'who', 'full', 'hope', 'haunted', 'past', 'know', 'using', 'affectation', '8220', 'old', 'sport', '8221', 'other', 'line', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'make', 'Gatsby', 'JG', 'certainly', 'phrase', 'book', 'not', 'extent', 'Leo', 'thin', 'very', 'quickly.I', 'never', 'heard', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'least', 'terms', 'appearance', '8217', 'improvement', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Here', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'compelling', 'protagonist', 'expend', 'vast', 'sums', 'money', 'make', 'grand', 'gestures', 'aim', 'winning', 'favor', 'winding', 'back', 'clock', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'together', 'hand', 'can', '8217', 'think', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'convey', 'beauty', 'desirability', '8217', 'not', 'Ms.', 'Mulligan.Joel', 'Edgerton', 'didn', '8217', 'seem', 'physically', 'big', 'enough', 'role', 'brutish', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'DiCaprio', '8217', 'inch', 'taller', 'according', 'ti', 'IMDB', 'Jordan', 'Baker', '8217', 's', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'watered', 'down', 'forgettable', 'Isla', 'Fischer', 'decent', 'job', 'what', 'little', 'do', 'Myrtle', 'Wilson', 'Tom', '8217', 's', 'mistress.Fans', 'novel', 'will', 'mostly', 'be', 'irritated', 'details', 'are', 'wrong', 'example', 'go', 'trouble', 'pointing', 'out', 'Wolfscheim', '8217', 'tie', 'pin', 'made', 'human', 'molar', '8217', 'actually', 'cufflinks-', 'why', 'change', 'Bottom', 'line', 'purists', 'who', 'cherish', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 's', 'work', 'should', 'avoid', 'Lurhmann', '8217', 'tedious', 'flick']",The Great Gatsby 2013

Ad...","[0, 3]","......and always has been, rather lackluster.I have, oddly, yet to meet anyone who read and liked the book.Friends and family of mine, have spoken about this movie in conjunction with the disappointment they felt after having to read it for English Class in H.S.Back in the day, for many of us stuck reading THE GREAT GATSBY by school requirement, we all wondered how F Scott Fitzgerald could  write a book with such a simple plot and one that contained no real moral to it, or at least some striking revelation about people/life, and still manage to win this very ordinary book much hype and acclaim.If he had written this book today, I think he would not have been published.There really is nothing outstanding about the story.In any case, for some reason, his book stood out to those who read it, and he got published.Eventually the book took off like wildfire.BACK TO THE MOVIE:  Dicaprio, who I do like a lot as an actor, is miscast here, in my humble opinion.I kept waiting for him to comfortably slip into character, but something is amiss and I kept seeing Leonardo Dicaprio dressed up in  Roaring 20's attire and not some figure named Jay Gatsby.His constant use of the phrasing,"" Old Chap"" is beyond annoying and seems unbelievable, coming from his mouth.Tobey Maguire ends up really being the best and most interesting character in the movie.I also feel he stole the movie from everyone as Nick Carraway- the one who narrates the story in the book.The spotlight shines on the incredible wealth of the times and people depicted here, and it glows specifically on this particular place on the coast of the Long Island Sound.While given a bogus name in the story, Fitzgerald was referring in general, to the location of Nassau County's North Shore of Long Island- which is still deemed THE GOLD COAST even today, as it does have many breathtaking old mansions that still exist.The cinematography is fantastic and I felt it was worth renting it just to see how this movie was filmed.The music is current music- which throws the film off kilter a bit.Why this artistic license was taken, I am unsure.You see the art deco decor and the timely fashions of the 20's, but throwing in modern music left me- and others- a bit puzzled.But, I will say, that when you see the party scenes and hear today's music, the director definitely managed to pull it off.  This might have been done to appeal to the younger generation of viewers.I am sure some of the  older segment of viewers will think the director should have stayed with a truer approach to that  era's music.There are some minor additions to the story-mainly the beginning and ending, that were not in the book. However, they do not affect the integrity of the original story.All the actors did a great job with the role they were given, but Dicaprio just can't seem to pull off the role of a mature, mystery man of money.It is not that he wasn't trying. I just don't think this role was meant for him.With now 3 versions of THE GREAT GATSBY on film( ALAN LADD- ROBERT REDFORD & NOW LEONARDO DICAPRIO), I don't think we will see another version anytime soon.I saw the coming attractions for this movie and I thought maybe, with a great all star cast and the very enticing visuals, it might- MIGHT- change my mind about the book.Unfortunately, no.Even awesome cinematography cannot save a basic story.This movies definitely pads it out with looks, but in the end you are still left with the book you read in High School.I will say, when it comes to the first opening scene of a party in progress, you are wonderfully bombarded by incredible imagery- and you DO soak it all in!VISUALLY GORGEOUS IS WHAT THE MOVIE IS AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SAVES IT FROM BEING A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.",3,See it for the stunning visuals because the story is.....,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,3737,"['always', 'been', 'rather', 'lackluster.I', 'have', 'oddly', 'yet', 'meet', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'liked', 'book.Friends', 'family', 'mine', 'have', 'spoken', 'movie', 'conjunction', 'disappointment', 'felt', 'having', 'read', 'English', 'Class', 'H.S.Back', 'day', 'many', 'stuck', 'reading', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'school', 'requirement', 'wondered', 'how', 'F', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'could', 'write', 'book', 'simple', 'plot', 'one', 'contained', 'real', 'moral', 'least', 'striking', 'revelation', 'people/life', 'still', 'manage', 'win', 'very', 'ordinary', 'book', 'much', 'hype', 'acclaim.If', 'had', 'written', 'book', 'today', 'think', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'published.There', 'really', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'story.In', 'case', 'reason', 'book', 'stood', 'out', 'who', 'read', 'got', 'published.Eventually', 'book', 'took', 'off', 'like', 'wildfire.BACK', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'Dicaprio', 'who', 'do', 'lot', 'actor', 'miscast', 'here', 'humble', 'opinion.I', 'kept', 'waiting', 'comfortably', 'slip', 'character', 'something', 'amiss', 'kept', 'seeing', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'dressed', 'up', 'Roaring', '20', 'attire', 'not', 'figure', 'named', 'Jay', 'Gatsby.His', 'constant', 'use', 'phrasing', 'Old', 'Chap', 'annoying', 'unbelievable', 'coming', 'mouth.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'up', 'really', 'being', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'movie.I', 'also', 'feel', 'stole', 'movie', 'everyone', 'Nick', 'Carraway-', 'one', 'who', 'story', 'book.The', 'spotlight', 'shines', 'incredible', 'wealth', 'times', 'people', 'depicted', 'here', 'specifically', 'particular', 'place', 'coast', 'Long', 'Island', 'Sound.While', 'given', 'bogus', 'name', 'story', 'Fitzgerald', 'was', 'referring', 'general', 'location', 'Nassau', 'County', 'North', 'Shore', 'Long', 'Island-', 'still', 'deemed', 'THE', 'GOLD', 'COAST', 'even', 'today', 'have', 'many', 'breathtaking', 'old', 'mansions', 'still', 'exist.The', 'cinematography', 'fantastic', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'renting', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed.The', 'music', 'current', 'music-', 'film', 'off', 'kilter', 'bit.Why', 'artistic', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'am', 'unsure.You', 'see', 'art', 'deco', 'decor', 'timely', 'fashions', '20', 'throwing', 'modern', 'music', 'left', 'me-', 'others-', 'bit', 'puzzled.But', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'see', 'party', 'scenes', 'hear', 'today', 'music', 'director', 'definitely', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'appeal', 'younger', 'generation', 'viewers.I', 'am', 'sure', 'older', 'segment', 'viewers', 'will', 'think', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'truer', 'approach', 'era', 'are', 'minor', 'additions', 'story-mainly', 'beginning', 'ending', 'were', 'not', 'book', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'affect', 'integrity', 'original', 'story.All', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'were', 'given', 'Dicaprio', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'mature', 'mystery', 'man', 'money.It', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'role', 'was', 'meant', 'him.With', 'now', '3', 'versions', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'film', 'ALAN', 'LADD-', 'ROBERT', 'REDFORD', 'NOW', 'LEONARDO', 'DICAPRIO', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'see', 'version', 'anytime', 'soon.I', 'saw', 'coming', 'attractions', 'movie', 'thought', 'maybe', 'great', 'star', 'cast', 'very', 'enticing', 'visuals', 'might-', 'MIGHT-', 'change', 'mind', 'book.Unfortunately', 'no.Even', 'awesome', 'cinematography', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'basic', 'story.This', 'movies', 'definitely', 'pads', 'out', 'looks', 'end', 'are', 'still', 'left', 'book', 'read', 'High', 'School.I', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'first', 'opening', 'scene', 'party', 'progress', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'bombarded', 'incredible', 'imagery-', 'DO', 'soak', 'VISUALLY', 'GORGEOUS', 'WHAT', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'AND', 'MAYBE', 'THAT', 'WHAT', 'SAVES', 'IT', 'FROM', 'BEING', 'A', 'TOTAL', 'DISAPPOINTMENT']",The Great Gatsby 2013

And I really hate the use of modern rap music in The Great Gatsby which is defined by jazz in the novel and the decade it was written.  Still, the actual music soundtrack (not the stupid songs which will actually age this film faster than anything else) is quite haunting and, for the most part, the film is a straight telling of Fitzgerald's masterpiece.  Wonderful performances and great recreation of the time period (although I could have done without a lot the CGI work - particularly of Gatsby's mansion).  The 1970s version, which is stiffly directed, also had a great cast (though neither film manages to get Daisy right) and wonderfully recreated 1920s New York without any special effects.  Still, other than Carey Mulligan's Daisy (and Amitabh Bachchan who has as much in common with Meyer Wolfsheim as I have with Indira Gandhi), the other characters could have stepped right out of the novel.  I just wish Luhrmann would not have given in to his baser instincts and include modern pop music in the film.

I kept asking myself, why? He sure didn't care that the music and the dancing was as inauthentic as it could be, having absolutely nothing to do with the music of the 20s or the way people danced in the 20s. Why not have a 60"" HDTV hanging on the wall playing music videos?Why was it so important to Mr. Luhrmann for the sets and costumes to be authentic to the early 20th Century, when the soundtrack and choreography were doing everything possible to take the viewer out of that era, slapping the 21st Century into one's face at every turn?I felt like I was watching 'Moulin Rouge II'. Don't get me wrong, I loved 'Moulin Rouge'. The modern music worked in that film because it was a musical. A musical, by the sheer fact that people break out in song, is fantasy. But this film is not a musical, making the soundtrack (obviously heard by the characters in the party scenes), and the dancing especially jarring.When you're dealing with a straight period drama, one based on a classic no less, I want to get lost in the PERIOD. This is impossible when the authenticity is ripped away by modern hip hop and dance music, with the early 20th Century characters doing some lame, stylized, 21st Century Charleston! Not only is it awkward and ugly, but it ruins any emotion that the time period evokes in the viewer. The only thing that could have made 'The Great Gatsby' any less authentic would have been if Gatsby had started freestylin'!Please, don't let Mr. Luhrmann set his sights on a remake of 'Gone With the Wind'.

1512444,A3GU5PNTT7DRIY,B0067EKYS6,C.R. Hurst,"[0, 0]","Having heard the negative buzz about the Great Gatsby during its theatrical release, I was more than a little hesitant to rent the film via Amazon's instant stream. However my curiosity got the better of me and my husband and I watched it last weekend. My reaction to Gatsby is mixed, but it did disappoint me as I expected it would. Unfortunately the film often destroys the spirit of the novel, and it is only the strong performances of the cast and the occasional sensitivity to the details of the book that make The Great Gatsby watchable at all.I should explain that I have always been a fan of Fitzgerald's classic about the doomed love affair between Daisy, a rich society girl, and Jay Gatsby, a poor working boy turned bootlegger, who tries to turn back time and regain her love years later. I also love the narration of the book by Nick Carraway who becomes Gatsby's friend and learns to admire his, as the book describes it, ""extraordinary gift for hope"". The delicate mix of romantic yearning and Jazz Age sophistication at odds with the crass materialism of the age has always made The Great Gatsby in my mind a nearly perfect novel. Clearly my standards would be high for the new adaptation of the story.My initial reaction to the opening scenes of the film was disbelief. The Jazz Age is depicted as a hip-hop extravaganza. One early scene at Jay Gatsby's palatial home shows dancers grinding to rap music (with an occasional strain of Gershwin for good measure) with all the subtlety of dogs in heat. Granted the 1920s were a decadent time, but please, show 1925 decadence, not its 21st century equivalent! Gatsby's parties, as described in the book, are sexy, seductive affairs ""where men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars."" Here the parties can only be described as fraternity rushes with all their expected charm. What was the director thinking? Baz Luhrmann, the director of 2001 Moulin Rouge, is known for his robust and highly visual style, but what may have worked with that film does not work in Gatsby. In fact, I could hardly watch the sequence. In addition, in scenes where main characters are introduced, the film's style is also grating. Nick Carraway, the narrator of Gatsby's story, is established as a morbidly alcoholic man. How do we know? Because those very words are part of his doctor's diagnosis which the audience gets to see IN BOLD SCRIPT on the screen. This intrusive technique of words, many of Fitzgerald's own, being typed across the screen as Nick writes Gatsby's story, is unfortunately relied upon throughout the film--and robs those words of their spoken poignancy. The other main characters, Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby, do not fare much better in their introductions. Their characters jump as swiftly and as garishly from the screen as Jacks sprung from their boxes. Now by this time I am almost ready to turn off the movie, but I do not, and to my surprise it finally begins to develop the characters and story I love.I attribute much of this almost-too-late success to strong acting and casting. Leonardo's DiCaprio is perfectly cast as Gatsby (far superior casting to the earlier version with the milquetoast Robert Redford). DiCaprio has the working class edge needed for the part and is a good enough actor to express the nuances of a man whose toughness hides a romantic vision. Carey Mulligan's Daisy is a sweet blend of spunky flapper and little girl lost. We know why Daisy inspires such devotion from Jay. Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan is as brutish and as calculating as he is in the book. The only disappointment is Tobey Maguire who, despite his solid performance, seems a little too old to be playing the innocent young Nick jaded by the Jazz Age. I recall one scene in particular where the principal characters try to escape the heat by fleeing to a hotel in Manhattan, and where Tom finally confronts Jay and Daisy about their affair. The drama and tenseness of such a situation is finely played by the ensemble. I also enjoyed the film's deft touch with some of the book's symbols and telling details: Gatsby's pink suit, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, the giant billboard eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, and even the owl-eyed man in the library, who is astonished that Gatsby's books are real, all make an appearance in the film.Nevertheless, despite some of the good points in The Great Gatsby, it is not the film adaption that fans of the novel will like. And so we beat on--hoping someday Hollywood will get it right and make a film worthy of Fitzgerald's classic.",3,And So We Beat On,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,4609,"['Having', 'heard', 'negative', 'buzz', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'hesitant', 'rent', 'film', 'Amazon', 'instant', 'stream', 'However', 'curiosity', 'got', 'better', 'husband', 'watched', 'last', 'weekend', 'reaction', 'Gatsby', 'mixed', 'did', 'disappoint', 'expected', 'would', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'often', 'spirit', 'novel', 'only', 'strong', 'performances', 'cast', 'occasional', 'sensitivity', 'details', 'book', 'make', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'watchable', 'all.I', 'should', 'explain', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Fitzgerald', 'classic', 'doomed', 'love', 'affair', 'Daisy', 'rich', 'society', 'girl', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'poor', 'working', 'boy', 'turned', 'bootlegger', 'who', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'regain', 'love', 'years', 'later', 'also', 'love', 'narration', 'book', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'who', 'Gatsby', 'friend', 'admire', 'book', 'extraordinary', 'gift', 'hope', 'delicate', 'mix', 'romantic', 'yearning', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'sophistication', 'odds', 'crass', 'materialism', 'age', 'always', 'made', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'mind', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'novel', 'Clearly', 'standards', 'would', 'be', 'high', 'new', 'adaptation', 'story.My', 'initial', 'reaction', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'disbelief', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'depicted', 'hip-hop', 'extravaganza', 'One', 'early', 'scene', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'palatial', 'home', 'shows', 'dancers', 'grinding', 'rap', 'music', 'occasional', 'strain', 'Gershwin', 'good', 'measure', 'subtlety', 'dogs', 'heat', 'Granted', '1920s', 'were', 'decadent', 'time', 'please', 'show', '1925', 'decadence', 'not', '21st', 'century', 'equivalent', 'Gatsby', 'parties', 'described', 'book', 'are', 'sexy', 'seductive', 'affairs', 'where', 'men', 'girls', 'came', 'went', 'moths', 'whisperings', 'champagne', 'stars', 'Here', 'parties', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'fraternity', 'rushes', 'expected', 'charm', 'What', 'was', 'director', 'thinking', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'director', '2001', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'known', 'robust', 'highly', 'visual', 'style', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'film', 'not', 'work', 'Gatsby', 'fact', 'could', 'hardly', 'watch', 'sequence', 'addition', 'scenes', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'film', 'style', 'also', 'grating', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'narrator', 'Gatsby', 'story', 'established', 'morbidly', 'alcoholic', 'man', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'very', 'words', 'are', 'part', 'doctor', 'diagnosis', 'audience', 'see', 'IN', 'BOLD', 'SCRIPT', 'screen', 'intrusive', 'technique', 'words', 'many', 'Fitzgerald', 'own', 'being', 'typed', 'screen', 'Nick', 'Gatsby', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'relied', 'film', 'robs', 'words', 'spoken', 'poignancy', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'do', 'not', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'introductions', 'characters', 'jump', 'swiftly', 'garishly', 'screen', 'Jacks', 'sprung', 'boxes', 'Now', 'time', 'am', 'almost', 'ready', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'surprise', 'finally', 'develop', 'characters', 'story', 'love.I', 'attribute', 'much', 'almost-too-late', 'success', 'strong', 'acting', 'casting', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Gatsby', 'far', 'superior', 'casting', 'earlier', 'version', 'milquetoast', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'DiCaprio', 'working', 'class', 'edge', 'needed', 'part', 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'express', 'nuances', 'man', 'toughness', 'romantic', 'vision', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Daisy', 'sweet', 'blend', 'spunky', 'flapper', 'little', 'girl', 'lost', 'know', 'why', 'Daisy', 'such', 'devotion', 'Jay', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'brutish', 'as', 'calculating', 'book', 'only', 'disappointment', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'solid', 'performance', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'innocent', 'young', 'Nick', 'jaded', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'recall', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'principal', 'characters', 'try', 'escape', 'heat', 'fleeing', 'hotel', 'Manhattan', 'where', 'Tom', 'finally', 'Jay', 'Daisy', 'affair', 'drama', 'tenseness', 'such', 'situation', 'finely', 'played', 'ensemble', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'deft', 'touch', 'book', 'symbols', 'telling', 'details', 'Gatsby', 'pink', 'suit', 'green', 'light', 'end', 'Daisy', 'dock', 'giant', 'billboard', 'eyes', 'Dr.', 'T.J.', 'Eckleburg', 'even', 'owl-eyed', 'man', 'library', 'who', 'astonished', 'Gatsby', 'books', 'are', 'real', 'make', 'appearance', 'film.Nevertheless', 'good', 'points', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'not', 'film', 'adaption', 'fans', 'novel', 'will', 'like', 'so', 'beat', 'hoping', 'someday', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'get', 'right', 'make', 'film', 'worthy', 'Fitzgerald', 'classic']",The Great Gatsby 2013

Gatsby, as DECaprio plays him, is enigmatic but finally deep at the surface only, and his is America.Visually stunning with music that propells the action into the depths of the 20s and at the same time takes us into the present which is passing away as quickly as a glass of champagne, as quickly as fortunes will disappear at the end of the 20s. Already, as the film opens, Gatsby is obsolete.Leonardo DiCaprio once more gives a stellar performance. He is that kind of actor who is a genuine artist with his timing, gestures, facial expressions, intonations of voice,those quick steps,sharp-eyed glances, and surprise and shock that everything must end, for him apocalyptically.The rest of the cast is flawless, especially Daisy ( Elizabeth Debicki) and Tobey McGuire. McGuire very subtley suggests the sexual ambiguity that he posseses along with Gatsby's own mysterious attachment to him, never defined, never acknowleged, but there, a sensuality that is absolutely brillaint the way it comes across.Daisy is at first all shine and glitter and very little substance, but then she suddenly exudes charm and guilesness and purpose. Her ""death"" will be one by 1000 cuts at the hands of her thug of a husband. It is all very well done..one magnificent scene after another.Those who are bored with films like this usually go to computer-driven action films about the earth ending or about the iron-clad heros beating up everyone they encounter all done with tricks..but the bad acting! These people who are not into serious cinema cannot be paid attention to in any venue they may choose to criticize a film, for they are finally without a knowlege of the art of film. Leave them to their own devices.Buy this film and rejoice!",5,Great film!!!!!,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,2174,"['version', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'depth', 'Gatsby', 'character', 'many', 'moods', 'shifts', 'make', 'what', 'is..basically', 'kind', 'charlatan', 'person', 'who', 'American', 'Dream', 'come', 'true', 'Daisy', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'true', 'ultimately', 'relegated', 'discard', 'pile', 'Gatsby', 'must', 'atone', 'things', 'person', 'did', 'very', 'messy', 'part', 'one-dimensional', 'life', 'escape', 'turn', 'Gatsby', 'DECaprio', 'enigmatic', 'finally', 'deep', 'surface', 'only', 'America.Visually', 'stunning', 'music', 'action', 'depths', '20s', 'same', 'time', 'present', 'passing', 'away', 'as', 'quickly', 'glass', 'champagne', 'as', 'quickly', 'fortunes', 'will', 'disappear', 'end', '20s', 'Already', 'film', 'Gatsby', 'obsolete.Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'once', 'more', 'stellar', 'performance', 'kind', 'actor', 'who', 'genuine', 'artist', 'timing', 'gestures', 'facial', 'expressions', 'intonations', 'voice', 'quick', 'steps', 'sharp-eyed', 'glances', 'surprise', 'shock', 'everything', 'must', 'end', 'apocalyptically.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'flawless', 'especially', 'Daisy', 'Elizabeth', 'Debicki', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'McGuire', 'very', 'subtley', 'sexual', 'ambiguity', 'Gatsby', 'own', 'mysterious', 'attachment', 'never', 'defined', 'never', 'acknowleged', 'there', 'sensuality', 'absolutely', 'brillaint', 'way', 'across.Daisy', 'first', 'shine', 'glitter', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'then', 'suddenly', 'charm', 'guilesness', 'purpose', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'one', '1000', 'cuts', 'hands', 'thug', 'husband', 'very', 'well', 'done..one', 'magnificent', 'scene', 'another.Those', 'who', 'are', 'bored', 'films', 'usually', 'go', 'computer-driven', 'action', 'films', 'earth', 'ending', 'iron-clad', 'heros', 'beating', 'up', 'everyone', 'encounter', 'done', 'tricks..but', 'bad', 'acting', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'serious', 'cinema', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'paid', 'attention', 'venue', 'may', 'choose', 'criticize', 'film', 'are', 'finally', 'knowlege', 'art', 'film', 'Leave', 'own', 'devices.Buy', 'film', 'rejoice']",The Great Gatsby 2013

Now its unfair to compare this film to ""Citizen Kane"", agruably one of the finest films ever made, but it is essentially the same theme. Gatsby, is also Kane, in his own way, from the humblest of circumstances, destroyed by wealth (as the script of ""Kane"" reads (sic): ""You know, if I hadn't have had wealth, then I might have been a really great man"".Indeed, Kane's wealth and power will not get him back to ""Rosebud"", or in Gatsby's case, ""Daisy"". However, does Dicaprio really have the swagger of Orson Welles? Does he exhibit the similar defiant charm? I think he is a great actor with terrific presence, maybe one of the best actors of a generation. Think of him in ""The Departed"". But, in this role, Leo sadly falls short, really flailing about as to whether the character should display arrogant charm or a devoted and sad sensitivity. And, Mulligan as ""Daisy"" is a disaster. She is a lovely ""dishrag"", completely devoid of any of the characteristics that would inspire such devotion and enduring love in Gatsby. I really want her to drink a few expressos. Finally, the entire opening sequence of parties, meant to set the stage for a ""Jazz Age"" is completely coarse, glaring, and ""in your face"" to the point where you want to turn the movie off. Perhaps, this is, the producers thought, the only kind of ""bling"" that would lure a modern, jaded crowd to the viewing of one of the greatest classics of literature, written both sparely, with the plainest kind of sincerity, and a vision of horror and tragedy engendered by a driven search for wealth that is, really, only a search for self. This is a small novel, but filled with great meaning and powerful images/symbols. If only someone could make a version that was also simple, small, and seriously engaging, show-casing the great depth of its characters.

The problem is that when you go to the movies most people, like myself, wants to escape and not be reminded of their failed relationships!

In the real world there are way too many people like Daisy and her husband!To all the critics who tore this film apart: shame on you! This is an extremely well done movie. You critics don't hesitate shilling for Iron Man, practically comparing it to Shakespeare, but a story with a great screenplay,acting, cinematography and music you trash.

1512452,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B0067EKYS6,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[3, 6]","Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is an eye-popping, over-the-top, hyperkinetic, loud, heavy-handed circus, opera, and kitchen sink drama. Luhrmann takes F. Scott Fitzgerald's quiet, brief, cerebral novel and forces it through a kaleidoscope, crashing and scattering images in a peacock-colored, geometric Busby Berkeley dance routine. The amazing thing is, it works. The heart and soul of Fitzgerald's novel are there onscreen, and honored. Underneath the literal glitter - that sticks to characters' faces and shoulders in multicolored patterns - this is a genuinely serious film about big themes. It entertained me, it moved me, and I cared.I am very sensitive to color and there were scenes in Luhrmann's ""Gatsby"" when I was overwhelmed by chromatic sensation. There is a hotel room orgy. The women wear vivid, finger-in-your-eye obvious eye shadow that contrasts with their vivid, obtrusive colored jewelry that clashes with their crazily colored dresses which throb in contrast with the hideous, red, patterned wallpaper which I am sure is the wallpaper in the hell that bad interior decorators go to. In another scene, purple, blue, and gold metallic streamers cascade downward on a dancer in a buttercup-yellow, ostrich feather tutu.And it all moves so fast. That ostrich feather tutu is onscreen for seconds. The camera just keeps moving on to the next visual sensation. The costumes, the cars, the special effects, Bollywood film icon Amitabh Bachchan as Jewish gangster, Meyer Wolfsheim!!!: this movie's fabulosity budget must have been a zillion dollars.Luhrmann lays everything on with a trowel. Long after the audience has realized that certain characters are users whose wealth protects them from the consequences of their evil deeds, Luhrmann tells the audience that, not just by speaking those words from Fitzgerald's book, but by writing the words out on the screen. Luhrmann shows, he tells, he beats you over the head. Only twice, though, did I feel he'd gone too far. Once when an obviously fake shooting star crossed the screen not once but I think three times, and when a character, struck by a car, is shown hurtling through space not once but twice. Once really was enough in both cases - one shooting star, one hurtling corpse.There is a scene in this movie that took my breath away. After all that jazz, and color and movement, the movie just ... stops. It stops in a hotel room. If you've seen the film, you know exactly which scene I'm talking about. There are no special effects in this scene, no fireworks, no presto changeo. It's just a group of people sitting around talking. And suddenly you feel as if you are on Broadway watching a Tony-winning production of Eugene O'Neill. That scene make my guts churn; it broke my heart. Is Luhrmann showing off here? Saying, See, I could hook you in with fabulousness, and now I will move you with nothing more magical than words and real feelings.The cast is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio totally owns Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio manages to be human amidst all the glitz. He conveys Gatsby's power and his vulnerability. His voice is perfect; he sounds like someone trying to sound like a Kennedy. Joel Edgerton inhabits Tom Buchanan's brutality and snobbery. Isla Fisher is solid trash. Carey Mulligan brings Daisy to charming, pathetic, despicable life. Tobey Maguire is appropriately observant, lost, tempted, and jaded as Nick. Gorgeous Elizabeth Debicki channels Kirsten Scott Thomas. Richard Carter conveys quiet menace as a character whose job it is to announce, ""Chicago is calling."" If you can make that line scary, you are very talented.The soundtrack mixes genuine jazz age music with rap-influenced music, and it works, too.",4,The Great Gatsby Forced through a Kaleidoscope -- And It Works!,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,3701,"['Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'eye-popping', 'over-the-top', 'hyperkinetic', 'loud', 'heavy-handed', 'circus', 'opera', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'drama', 'Luhrmann', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'quiet', 'brief', 'cerebral', 'novel', 'forces', 'kaleidoscope', 'crashing', 'scattering', 'images', 'peacock-colored', 'geometric', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'dance', 'routine', 'amazing', 'thing', 'heart', 'soul', 'Fitzgerald', 'novel', 'are', 'there', 'onscreen', 'honored', 'literal', 'glitter', 'characters', 'shoulders', 'multicolored', 'patterns', 'genuinely', 'serious', 'film', 'big', 'themes', 'entertained', 'moved', 'cared.I', 'am', 'very', 'sensitive', 'color', 'were', 'scenes', 'Luhrmann', 'Gatsby', 'when', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'chromatic', 'sensation', 'hotel', 'room', 'orgy', 'women', 'wear', 'vivid', 'finger-in-your-eye', 'obvious', 'eye', 'shadow', 'vivid', 'obtrusive', 'colored', 'jewelry', 'clashes', 'crazily', 'colored', 'dresses', 'throb', 'contrast', 'hideous', 'red', 'patterned', 'am', 'sure', 'wallpaper', 'hell', 'bad', 'interior', 'decorators', 'go', 'scene', 'purple', 'blue', 'gold', 'metallic', 'streamers', 'cascade', 'downward', 'dancer', 'buttercup-yellow', 'ostrich', 'feather', 'tutu.And', 'moves', 'so', 'fast', 'feather', 'tutu', 'onscreen', 'seconds', 'camera', 'just', 'moving', 'next', 'visual', 'sensation', 'costumes', 'cars', 'special', 'effects', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'icon', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'Jewish', 'gangster', 'Meyer', 'Wolfsheim', 'movie', 'fabulosity', 'budget', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'zillion', 'dollars.Luhrmann', 'everything', 'trowel', 'Long', 'audience', 'realized', 'certain', 'characters', 'are', 'users', 'wealth', 'consequences', 'evil', 'deeds', 'Luhrmann', 'audience', 'not', 'just', 'speaking', 'words', 'Fitzgerald', 'book', 'writing', 'words', 'out', 'screen', 'Luhrmann', 'head', 'Only', 'twice', 'did', 'feel', ""'d"", 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'Once', 'when', 'obviously', 'fake', 'shooting', 'star', 'crossed', 'screen', 'not', 'once', 'think', 'three', 'times', 'when', 'character', 'struck', 'car', 'shown', 'hurtling', 'space', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'Once', 'really', 'was', 'enough', 'cases', 'one', 'shooting', 'star', 'one', 'hurtling', 'corpse.There', 'scene', 'movie', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'jazz', 'color', 'movement', 'movie', 'just', 'hotel', 'room', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'exactly', 'scene', ""'m"", 'talking', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'scene', 'fireworks', 'presto', 'changeo', 'just', 'group', 'people', 'sitting', 'talking', 'suddenly', 'feel', 'are', 'Broadway', 'watching', 'Tony-winning', 'production', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'scene', 'make', 'guts', 'churn', 'broke', 'heart', 'Luhrmann', 'showing', 'off', 'here', 'Saying', 'See', 'could', 'hook', 'fabulousness', 'now', 'will', 'move', 'nothing', 'more', 'magical', 'words', 'real', 'feelings.The', 'cast', 'perfect', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'totally', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'DiCaprio', 'be', 'human', 'glitz', 'conveys', 'Gatsby', 'power', 'vulnerability', 'voice', 'perfect', 'someone', 'trying', 'sound', 'Kennedy', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'brutality', 'snobbery', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'solid', 'trash', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Daisy', 'charming', 'pathetic', 'despicable', 'life', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'appropriately', 'observant', 'lost', 'tempted', 'jaded', 'Nick', 'Gorgeous', 'Elizabeth', 'Debicki', 'channels', 'Kirsten', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Richard', 'Carter', 'conveys', 'quiet', 'menace', 'character', 'job', 'announce', 'Chicago', 'calling', 'can', 'make', 'line', 'scary', 'are', 'very', 'talented.The', 'soundtrack', 'mixes', 'genuine', 'jazz', 'age', 'music', 'rap-influenced', 'music', 'too']",The Great Gatsby 2013

1512461,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0067EKYS6,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","Baz Luhrman directed this 2013 version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus in the garish and grandiose style in which he directed 2001's ""Moulin Rouge"",  complete with zippy camera shots pushing us into facial close-ups,  or zooming up and down,  panning to give viewers just a glimpse of certain dramatic details, and a modernized and synthesized score, incongruous with the Jazz Age that it depicts, but presumably done to attract a younger audience, (Even many of the songs from the 1920s were not written at the time in which the story takes place), a few hazy  black and white shots to artificially age the otherwise sharp cinematography to make the view look more in sync with the period when photography was only black and white,and a saddened and chastened narrator typing a story about an ill-fated central figure whom he mourns deeply.An element not featured in Fitzgerald's original story is the narrator, Nick Carraway( a boyish, amiable and folksy Tobey Maguire, still sounding like an adolescent with a crack in his voice) being confined to one Perkins Sanitarium where he is recovering from alcohol addiction, where Dr. Perkins(Jack Thompson, discreetly worked into the piece) in the winter of 1929.Carraway notes how the fashionable set drank to keep up with the times, and contributed nothing new, reminding any student of history of how that scenario repeated itself via drug use in the 1960s.Carraway recounts his Midwestern upbringing, his time at Yale, and his aspirations of being a writer before becoming a bonds salesman on Wall Street, renting a small cottage  for $80 a month in between the illustrious mansions of West Egg, across from the courtesy bay of East Egg where the old moneyed families live, including his cousin Daisy Fay Buchanan( a sharp eyed, very pretty, and indeed fay-like Carey Mulligan, slightly more assertive  and less breathy than Mia Farrow was in the part four decades earlier), who lives with her husband Tom( a strapping Joel Edgerton), whom Nick knew at Yale, and daughter, Pammy(Emily Foreman, Tiger Leacy Wyvill, Charlize Skinner), in an accurately  recreated  red brick Georgian-style mansion. The spired, castle like mansion where most of the drama will unfold, is also in accordance with the book's description.Tom, a polo player leads Nick into the house where he has a playful and lighthearted moment with his college buddy before reuniting him with Daisy as she lies on a couch in an open and aired room, with curtains blowing in the summer breeze. Her companion, Jordan Baker(Elizabeth Debeicki)also lies on the couch, and is introduced to Nick amid Daisy's promise to fling them together.Their dinnertime is rafe with repartee, gossip, and conversations that make Nick uncomfortable.A Mr. Gatsby is mentioned as Nick's neighbor, temporarily drawing Daisy's attention. Jordan reveals to Nick that Tom is having an  extramarital fling, and Daisy reveals her personal unhappiness and feelings about her daughter's future.Soon after, Tom takes Nick on what he initially claims will be a luncheon at the Yale Club,but it turns out to be a jaunt into the  seedy underbelly of  his life---the Valley of Ashes where they stop at a gas station run by George Wilson( Jason Clarke, who appeared with Joel Edgerton in ""Zero Dark Thirty""), where Nick is introduced to Tom's mistress, Wilson's wife, Myrtle(a trashily voluptuous Isla Fisher) to whom Tom slips some money so she can travel to meet him in town.When the two hook up,Tom buys Myrtle a dog  for the NYC apartment where they carry on their affair, an uncomfortable Nick tries to leave, but is blocked by Myrtle's  sister Catherine(Adelaide Clemens) and a Mr. and Mrs. McKee(Eden Falk and Kate Mulvaney). Catherine chats with Nick about the illicit couple's inability to stand their respective spouses, and offers him some pills.Unlike the 1974 version, we see Nick get drunk,and view himself as both an insider and outsider to what is going on in his life.He finds himself on his front porch the next day, with no idea how he got there, and a feeling that his mysterious, wealthy , party-throwing neighbor is watching him.Nick soon receives an invitation to attend a wild party next door, and is the only guest to actually have received such an invitation.Dressed nicely enough but sans a tuxedo, the young broker joins the festivities and is reunited with Jordan as he tries to find his host.The incongruous modern music under the auspices of Beethoven's alleged dubious descendant, Klipspringer(Brendan Maclean) galvanizes the party, and the colors and atmosphere are more intense than in the 1974 version. Maguire's Nick Carraway busts some modern dance moves on the dais above the pool, but he also gives a broader narration of the story.One Teddy Barton(Gus Murray) keeps trying to divert Jordan's attention away from the penniless Nick, reminding him that ""Rich girls don't marry poor boys.""After chatting with a servant, and an elderly gentleman in the mansion's library called ""Owl Eyes""( Max Cullum), Nick is no farther along  in locating his host than before.Soon he's back outside as Klipspringer begins a ""Jazz History of the World"" playing George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue""(two years prematurely, given its 1924 debut), and someone addresses  him as ""Old Sport"" while asking if he had known him during the war. Nick acknowledges his  time in the service, explains that he hasn't met the host, repeats rumors others have said about the host, and... Lo and behold the mystery is solved!Standing before Nick is his handsome young host, Jay Gatsby, handing him a glass of champagne, played by  a still impishly cherubic-faced Leonardo(Will someone please give him an Oscar already?) DiCaprio.A striking difference between the newer cast and the cast of 40 years ago is  how young the newer cast seems although they're approximately same age as the previous cast was.The male leads in Coppola's  version looked like  men aged by war. But here, youth is flaming and blossoming.The two-decades-old friendship of DiCaprio and Maguire, who first worked together in 1993's ""This Boy's Life"" comes across in this film, and while they both sound as though they could pass for teenagers--DiCaprio's full, slightly weathering visage looking as round and as sweet as a sugar cookie-- the film's warm lighting makes the sun appear to beam on their camaraderie.Zipping through New York in a fated yellow car not long afterwards, Jay takes Nick to a speakeasy where he introduces him to  his associate,gambler Meyer Wolfsheim(Amitabh Bachchan), who fixed the 1919 World Series. Jay leaves the encounter mysteriously when Tom shows up, and a befuddled Nick soon runs into Jordan, who tells him of Jay's desire to have him invite Daisy to tea, revealing their previous history together. A reluctant Nick agrees.Jay hires florists and caterers to prepare Nick's cottage for the encounter, which occurs at long last with much awkwardness and poignancy.After the three spend time on the bay together, Jay escorts the cousins over to his house after tea to give them a tour. At one point, Daisy weeps at Gatsby's wealth, acquired too late for him to marry her. But she reviews his scrapbook of mementos of her, which he kept from the time her family entertained him and his Army camp buddies in Louisville during the war.We learn of a young James Gatz'( Tasman Palazzo, Callan MacAuliffe) early life and his life-altering mentor, Dan Cody(Steve Bisley). One of the films' most delightful moments  is in watching the cousins do the Charleston to the sounds of Jay's Wurlitzer as Klipspringer plays, to the amusement of their host, Dicaprio flashing that beautiful white-toothed smile of his...Soon Jay takes over the dance as the affair begins. After one more party, attended by the Buchanans, the lights of Gatsby's pleasure palace slowly go out, and only servants affiliated with Wolfsheim are kept on to discreetly make way for his mistress.There is a brief scene of adulterous lovers together in bed-Jay's full, well-tanned muscular physique dominating that of his pale and fay paramour, and of her sleeping peacefully on his shoulder by heaving masculine breasts with hair like golden fleece...Nick and Jordan are present at a lunch at the Buchanan's where Jay's and Daisy's affair becomes apparent.Things come to a head  at the Plaza Hotel, where the previously preoccupied Nick gradually remembers his own 30th birthday.Jay and Daisy leave, with a fateful collision of mistresses that alters the course of events. The shattering of a pearl necklace is symbolic in so many ways.A line from the musical ""Camelot"" comes to mind: ""In the dying candle's gleam came the sundown of a dream.""Flaming youth will burn out.In lieu of a grieving father's involvement,and a final confrontation with Tom, we end with a disillusioned Nick taking responsibility for a tragedy's aftermath, and writing an unforgettable cautionary tale, cathartic for a man who has kept too many secrets for too long--a tale whose message transcends the Jazz Age and which will bode well for all time!",5,Conceptualized and

It looks good, the party scenes and the set design are every bit as audacious as you'd expect from a work that lampooned the gross excessiveness of the roaring 20s.2nd The acting is pretty good and they had the right castNow the bad1) I cant stand an historical piece that uses modern music. WHY IS JAY-Z on the soundtrack and why do I hear his annoying hip hop rhymes throughout the movie? It just takes you out the story completely. The 1920s had a soundtrack and hip hop and rap was not part of it. And for that matter neither was techno music which is also featured throughout the movie and during the party scenes. You wouldn't make a civil war movie and have Britney Spears singing Opps I Did it Again during one of the battle scenes, then why have Jay-Z playing when they walk into a speakeasy2) They miss a lot of the character story and the symbolic meaning of the book as embodied in the characters. What they did to Daisey is a shame, she isn't just a person she represents something each person is metaphor and when you change how certain characters acted and reacted to the storyline then you lose the metaphor they were supposed to representIn short, this movie was a butchering of a classic.

1512470,A1K8QP2M2DVAA4,B0067EKYS6,Dillon Lee,"[2, 3]","Saw The Great Gatsby and find myself profoundly affected by it. It's been 18 years since I've read Gatsby and while its themes of ""the American dream,"" excess, classism, and societal conventions are intact in Baz Luhrmann's adaptation, it also left with a great emptiness. It is as if I've watched a beautiful watercolor being painted before my eyes. At times vibrant, frenetic and bombastic, often slowing to perfect the intricacies.

Yet something tells me watching a Baz Luhrmann film is akin to drinking absinthe; I became a fan of this creative director ever since I was floored by his amazingly bizarreMoulin Rouge.  And his latest offering, a provocative version of Fitzgerald's classic THE GREAT GATSBY, evokes the same sensations:  vivid, brightly colored images; anachronistic music; wild party shots almost to excess; haunting sights transposing to another scene; eerie animation; and acute attention to detail.  Luhrmann weaves all of these mind-altering components like an enchanted sorcerer, making his THE GREAT GATSBY one entertaining experience.We're all familiar with the fatalistic, tragic story.  And the cast does an admirable job bringing Fitzgerald's characters to life; Tobey Maguire lends credibility to Nick Carraway's initial naivete, giving way to anguish and despair; Leonardo DiCaprio keeps getting better and better, and here he doesn't disappoint as the ever-optimistic Gatsby, forever pursing that green orgiastic light; and Carey Mulligan is a pseudo weak link as pampered, indecisive Daisy Buchanan.  Of the remaining cast, I especially enjoyed Joel Edgerton as the philandering jock Tom Buchanan, and the scrumptious Isla Fisher as Tom's mistreated mistress Myrtle Wilson.  But again, the real star of this ensemble is Luhrmann; he brings his version of THE GREAT GATSBY to pyrotechnic life like a master craftsman.  So as far as the absinthe, I'll pass.

In the first half-hour I have to admit that I thought it wasrather over-blown and operatic; the screen was filled with color andlight; many scenes, although brilliantly staged and expertly filmed,seemed rather irrelevant to the purpose of the story; while the music -an anachronistic combination of Twenties standards and contemporaryrock - jarred on my ears. As the action unfolds, however, so the filmradically improves as Luhrmann becomes far more interested in hischaracters. As Nick Carraway, Tobey Maguire assumes a pivotal role inthe action; he is the first person we see on screen as he recalls whathappened to his psychiatrist. At once appalled yet attracted to JayGatsby's way of life, Nick comes to understand what lies behind it:Gatsby's perpetual desire for recognition in New York high society.Carey Mulligan comes across as rather colorless as Daisy Buchanan;however, in terms of Lurhmann's interpretation, this seems entirelycoherent. Gatsby is prepared to go to any lengths to recreate his love-affair with Daisy; Lurhmann shows that Daisy is not really worth it. AsFitzgerald says in the source-text, she is ""careless"" as well asindifferent. Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan is quite simply brilliant;someone accustomed to a privileged way of life, who possesses little orno understanding of anyone around him. He believes he can pick up andthrow away people at will, just like material things. LeonardoDiCaprio's Gatsby bears a striking facial resemblance to the youngOrson Welles. At once confident yet suspicious, his eyes dart aroundfrom person to person, as if unable to trust anyone. His finalconfrontation with Tom in the hotel room is quite stunning - especiallywhen Gatsby loses his civilized veneer and reveals his true nature. Atthe film's end we are left feeling terribly sad: Gatsby might have beena fraud, but as Nick says, he embodies the kind of perpetual hope thatseems quite at odds with the material world around him.",4,Surprisingly Good Adaptation of the Fitzgerald Classic,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,2096,"['Having', 'heard', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'reviews', 'word-of-mouth', 'approached', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'version', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'mixedfeelings', 'first', 'half-hour', 'have', 'admit', 'thought', 'wasrather', 'over-blown', 'operatic', 'screen', 'was', 'filled', 'color', 'andlight', 'many', 'scenes', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'expertly', 'filmed', 'seemed', 'rather', 'irrelevant', 'purpose', 'story', 'music', '-an', 'anachronistic', 'combination', 'Twenties', 'standards', 'contemporaryrock', 'jarred', 'ears', 'action', 'unfolds', 'however', 'filmradically', 'Luhrmann', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'hischaracters', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'pivotal', 'role', 'inthe', 'action', 'first', 'person', 'see', 'screen', 'whathappened', 'psychiatrist', 'once', 'appalled', 'yet', 'attracted', 'JayGatsby', 'way', 'life', 'Nick', 'understand', 'what', 'Gatsby', 'perpetual', 'desire', 'recognition', 'New', 'York', 'high', 'society.Carey', 'Mulligan', 'across', 'rather', 'colorless', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'however', 'terms', 'Lurhmann', 'interpretation', 'entirelycoherent', 'Gatsby', 'prepared', 'go', 'lengths', 'recreate', 'love-affair', 'Daisy', 'Lurhmann', 'Daisy', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'AsFitzgerald', 'source-text', 'careless', 'well', 'asindifferent', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Tom', 'Buchanan', 'quite', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'someone', 'accustomed', 'privileged', 'way', 'life', 'who', 'little', 'orno', 'understanding', 'anyone', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'andthrow', 'away', 'people', 'will', 'just', 'material', 'things', 'LeonardoDiCaprio', 'Gatsby', 'striking', 'facial', 'resemblance', 'youngOrson', 'Welles', 'once', 'confident', 'yet', 'suspicious', 'eyes', 'dart', 'person', 'person', 'unable', 'trust', 'anyone', 'finalconfrontation', 'Tom', 'hotel', 'room', 'quite', 'stunning', 'especiallywhen', 'Gatsby', 'civilized', 'veneer', 'reveals', 'true', 'nature', 'Atthe', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'terribly', 'sad', 'Gatsby', 'might', 'have', 'beena', 'fraud', 'Nick', 'kind', 'perpetual', 'hope', 'quite', 'odds', 'material', 'world']",The Great Gatsby 2013

This film did well in making a visualization of the wildness and sensuality of Gatsby's parties. DiCaprio was well cast as Gatsby and capably portrayed the desperation of Gatsby in his lifelong quest to obtain Daisy.  Tobey Maguire did a good job as Nick, giving us the story as he claims that he feels he ""watches from both within and without"" of the group around him.Carey Milligan was possibly the second best portrayal of Daisy that I've seen (behind Mira Sorvino).  While Milligan did a better job of portraying Daisy's unhappiness with her own marriage, Sorvino did a better job throughout of portraying Daisy as the self-centered person that she is, happy with her life until Gatsby re-appears and challenges what she has.The one real complaint that I had with the movie was the music.  It was, especially during the party scenes, very anachronistic. Modern hip-hop songs playing was completely out of place in the 1920s jazz-age.  This largely faded in the second half of the film once Gatsby ceased having his parties and began spending every moment with Daisy.Overall, the film did a very good job of telling the story from the novel and stuck very close to the Fitzgerald's work.4/5",4,A Very Strong Interpretation,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1418,"['only', 'concern', 'going', 'movie', 'was', 'memory', 'what', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'did', 'Romeo', 'Juliet.Overall', 'fears', 'were', 'quelled', 'seeing', 'movie..Luhrmann', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'tone', 'novel', 'film', 'did', 'well', 'making', 'visualization', 'wildness', 'sensuality', 'Gatsby', 'parties', 'DiCaprio', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'Gatsby', 'capably', 'portrayed', 'desperation', 'Gatsby', 'lifelong', 'quest', 'obtain', 'Daisy', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Nick', 'giving', 'story', 'watches', 'group', 'him.Carey', 'Milligan', 'was', 'possibly', 'second', 'best', 'portrayal', 'Daisy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Milligan', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'Daisy', 'unhappiness', 'own', 'marriage', 'Sorvino', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'Daisy', 'self-centered', 'person', 'happy', 'life', 'Gatsby', 're-appears', 'what', 'has.The', 'one', 'real', 'complaint', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'especially', 'party', 'scenes', 'very', 'anachronistic', 'Modern', 'hip-hop', 'songs', 'playing', 'was', 'completely', 'place', '1920s', 'jazz-age', 'largely', 'faded', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'once', 'Gatsby', 'ceased', 'having', 'parties', 'began', 'spending', 'moment', 'Daisy.Overall', 'film', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'novel', 'stuck', 'very', 'close', 'Fitzgerald', 'work.4/5']",The Great Gatsby 2013

With this latest adaptation, by director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!), I was curious to see how Luhrmann's unique style would translate to this classic story. I entered the theater with a fair amount of trepidation, especially after the largely mixed reviews that I'd read. To my surprise, however, I really enjoyed this adaptation.There were a couple of major alterations to the novel's original story, namely Nick's background and the events that take place after his time with Gatsby, but the film was mostly faithful to the novel. Many of the reviews argued against the director's style over substance approach, but I completely disagree with these claims. While there are moments of dazzling camera acrobatics and 3D effects, there are also many moments of quiet introspection. DiCaprio's Gatsby is probably the most sincere portrayal of this character that will ever appear on film. His interactions with both Maguire's Nick and Mulligan's Daisy seemed genuine, and I could really feel the soul of the man behind the facade he had made for himself.This unique interpretation will, no doubt, garner a variety of reactions amongst the faithful readers and casual moviegoers.

So, by that standard, this lives up to expectations.  It has the grandness, the glitter, the music, the costumes.  Visually, it's a stunning movie.  Possibly that's why this movie fails in some respects.  The actors simply can't live up to the grand scale of the rest of the movie.  Dicaprio does make a fine Gatsby.  He gets the desperation and the ruthlessness perfectly.  And his good looks, while not a match for Redford, make him all the more irresistible.  Carey Mulligan looks the part of Daisy but can't quite pull off the careless little rich girl.  For one thing, she seems much too young and she doesn't have the hardness that Daisy must ultimately possess.  And, honestly, there just didn't seem to be any chemistry between the two stars.  The attraction seemed more superficial than obsessive and overpowering.  The biggest miss, character wise, was Tobey Maquire as Nick Carraway.  It just felt like he was reading someone else's story rather than telling his own.  The beginning of the movie felt completely awkward with his character, almost embarrassingly so.

1512505,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0067EKYS6,FNDNreview,"[3, 8]","Since its original publication in April 1925, The Great Gatsby has received the adaptation treatment several times over its near 90 year history - including in film, television, and theater.  F. Scott Fitzgerald's American masterpiece is regarded as one of the greatest stories in literature, so it's not at all surprising that this story has been tackled so many times.  However, there has yet to be one version (outside of the novel) that has been able to do the story complete justice - and that is largely due to the complexity of the story.  The plot and character details within the novel are beautifully written, and haven't exactly translated well to any other medium up to this point.  Now, here we are in 2013 and the same two men that made Romeo and Juliet hip again, Baz Luhrmann and Leonardo DiCaprio, are back together once more, adapting the tale of Mr. Gatsby in The Great Gatsby.Directed by Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge!), The Great Gatsby stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, the mysteriously rich neighbor of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire).  Constantly throwing elaborate extravaganzas, Jay Gatsby asks the assistance of his neighbor to reunite him with his old flame, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) - Nick's cousin.  Despite the fact that Daisy is now a married woman, Gatsby sets out to reestablish his relationship with the woman he loved and lost, prior to joining the fight in World War I.  Joel Edgerton, Isla Fischer, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki also star in supporting roles.If you've seen the commercials for The Great Gatsby (and the odds say you probably have), you'll most likely have noticed that even though the film still takes place in the American 1920s, the story has been modernly modified with hip-hop music to go along with the glitz and glamour of the &uuml;ber rich New York lifestyle.  Despite the modern additions to this classic story, the fans of the novel can be rest assured that the substance of the story is still intact.  The plot still surrounds the love entanglement of Gatsby and Daisy, all the while still featuring the same important themes (repeating the past and social/class standing) and symbolism (most notably the green light and the watching eyes billboard) of the novel - only with a ton of choreographed dancing and bass pumping Jay-Z music.  Honestly, the music is difficult to deal with in the beginning, but once the film's plot shifts into high gear, the music only adds to the experience and enjoyment...and depending on your music tolerance, you'll either learn to love it, or simply hate it all together.Like the novel and the majority of films, The Great Gatsby features a three part stanza, the first of which centers on Toby Maguire's character, Nick Carraway, and his infatuation with the life of his next door neighbor, Jay Gatsby.  Upon meeting, Carraway and Gatsby's friendship instantly blossoms to the point that Gatsby asks Carraway for help reintroducing him to his cousin and former lover.  The second part of the stanza features the love affair and growing tensions surrounding the consequences of Gatsby trying to make Daisy leave her husband - who has been nothing other than unfaithful to his wife.  In the final portion of the film, Daisy's decision in regards to whom she wants to be with (Gatsby or her husband), along with the car accident and murder, carry you through to the credits.The acting in the film is certainly nothing Oscar-worthy, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby Maguire dominating the majority of the scenes.  These two do a good enough job interacting with one another, DiCaprio always sprouting confidence while Maguire watches in admiration.  DiCaprio gives everything that you'd expect from him at this point in his career, working hard at being the heartthrob.  Maguire, on the other hand, is just along for the ride as a moderately enjoyable moderator, always two steps behind Gatsby, never giving in to the propositions of wealth offered to him.  The damsels of the film, Carey Mulligan, Elizabeth Debicki, and Isla Fisher, each play the part they were cast to play, but none of them are ever really able to emotionally connect with the meaningful substance of their characters.  In the end, the cast could have been better, but each member is able to pull their weight just enough to get the film across the finish line.Overall, the modern adaptation of The Great Gatsby reeks with the same over exaggerated flare that made Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet so popular with teens and young adults.  No, The Great Gatsby will not be for everyone (catering to a younger generation), but it will most certainly bring this classic tale to a new generation and back into the spotlight where it belongs.  At the same time, the film sacrifices plot and character development in order to add dancing, drop more confetti, and submit to the Hollywood style of entertainment.  Still, the scenery is beautiful (even though fake at times), and the heart of the story remains in the right place.  In the end, The Great Gatsby is an alluring plot that will draw you in with its glamorous ambition and leaving you clapping your hands with a final approval and endorsement.Overall Film Grade:

1512522,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0067EKYS6,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","From the encyclopedia the facts are here: `The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.' Pretty well said and for those many of us who have read the novel that straightforward description serves Fitzgerald's story well.Enter Baz Luhrmann who adapted Fitzgerald's novel with his constant co-writer Craig Pearce (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet, Strictly Ballroom) and director this Rose Parade Float version of Gatsby and the emphasis is different from the book - and that really is OK; it is a visualization of the raucous flamboyance of the Roarin' 20s pushed to extremes and decorated with Luhrmann's fetish for across time music themes and songs. The story remains intact for the most part as narrated by faux writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and the epitome of the American Dream Jay Gatsby is pasted on Leonardo DiCaprio while the vapid Daisy is well underplayed by Carey Mulligan. The spectacle settles down for moments offering some fine cameos by Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, spectacularly beautiful and talented Elizabeth Debicki in the small but significant role as Jordan Baker, Isla Fisher as the doomed Myrtle Wilson, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband George Wilson, and Callan McAuliffe as the teenage Jay Gatsby plus a `cast of thousands'. It places rich man poor man and the opportunities for role reversal at a new level and Luhrmann and company make that happen. Yes, it is overdone and over the top as is Luhrmann's style, and no, I wouldn't watch it again, but as entertainment on the grand scale it is not bad!

Not nearly as well acted as the 1970's original, but in terms of energy, this &#34;Gatsby&#34; makes the Redford version seem comatose.  It's also a &#34;Gatsby&#34; for our age.  I thought the modern music would drive me nuts, but in fact it acts as a bridge between our era and the 'Twenties.  We may have some wild parties, but a bunch of kids in hoodies just isn't quite as decadent as kids in tuxes and gowns.  And illegal booze is quite a bit different than illegal speed, or ecstasy.On the other hand, where it counts, in the acting, a Madonna video has more depth.  Toby McGuire is practically invisible, a wide-eyed shadow.  Carey Mulligan never seems to change her expression.  And DiCaprio...  When he doesn't say anything he's at his most convincing.  When he talks he sounds like someone faking his dialect, badly.  And when he gets nervous he reminds me of Hitler---the clumsy way he wipes his hand over his hair to push it into place.  Like everyone else, I found Elizabeth Debicki by far the most compelling character to watch, although I must say, when they first go into NYC, to the aparment Tom keeps for his mistress, that set, and the women in it are all quite a picture to behold---the use of green on one actress and red, green and yellow on Myrtle both suggests colorized film and black and old fruit crate label art.When Fitzgerald wrote &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;, WWI was a sharp wound in the collective consciousness.  Today it's locked up deep within our collective amnesia, like the grave of a supposed hero that always presents embarrassing truths each time someone opens the casket.  You don't need to understand the impact of WWI to enjoy the book or either movie, but it certainly helps.  It wasn't just illegal booze and short skirts that made the twenties, but the escape from the horror of an utterly unnecessary war we never should have entered, where corporations profited to epic excess, and where not only were there no good guys, but the ending was so unsatisfying, everyone knew another war was imminent, just as they knew the prosperity couldn't last forever.  That's why this movie is such a &#34;Gatsby&#34; for our age.  With 9/11 still too close behind us to forget, and too many questions we're afraid to answer, we know we're on the edge of an abyss;  wealth abounds, and if you can't see it in the flesh, it permeates our media.  This can't last, something bad is going to happen, and yet we don't know what to do, so we keep on shopping, keep on partying.No, &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; of 2013 is not the best version of the book, but then again, either was the 1973 version.  They're both flawed, neither can quite deliver the book to the silver screen, but for me, the energy and visuals of this one make it far more watchable than the 1970's snooze fest;  the other one had more developed characters and this one has the better look.

I am well aware of the dangers of making films from classic novels; however, some directors pull it off. (I'm thinking now of ""The Dead,"" ""The Remains of the Day"" and ""The Day of the Locust,"" to name three.)  Mr. Luhrmann's efforts--  sadly--  do not capture the essence of the novel while standing on its own as a successful work of art. I am amazed that the director of ""Strictly Ballroom,"" one of my favorite movies, is responsible in large part for this disaster.Where to begin? The three main characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio (Gatsby), Tobey Maguire (Nick Carraway) and Carey Mulligan (Daisy) are hopelessly miscast. (That doesn't leave much to save the movie.)  To be asked to believe that Gatsby would pine for five years for the character played by Mulligan is simply absurd. Maguire, on the other hand, may be the most miscast. He, in a word, plays himself. At times,  furthermore, I thought the director was trying to produce an epic with all those crowd and party scenes a la ""Doctor Zhivago."" And the scenes shot around the service station look like a war zone. What on earth was that all about I ask. And did fashionable men from this period wear skinny-legged suits? Does anyone remember the wardrobe from the 1970's version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow? At least that movie got that much right.I kept hoping this interminable film (over two hours long) would get better. It did not. Maybe (I thought) the appearance of Gatsby's father would add a tad of pathos to this runny West Egg, but he did not show. (Since surely every high school graduate in this country has been required to read the novel, I do not believe I am offering much of a ""spoiler,"" as they say.)I kept looking for something to like about this movie as I checked  my watch often. The opening and closing credits are rather good, and occasional lines from Fitzgerald's novel reminded me of the reason it has become a classic, not enough, however, to justify spending money and, more importantly, two and a half hours of my precious life watching this Titanic.

1512535,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0067EKYS6,Hikari,"[2, 3]","Against all expectations, I actually ended up liking this movie. It's infused with the unmistakable Baz Luhrmann imprint: this director imagines the most over-the-top scenarios possible and then goes 30% more over-the-top. Here, he outdoes himself. It's &#34;Moulin Rouge!&#34; meets &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; . . on acid. Scott Fitzgerald, chronicler of the Jazz Age (one might say the inventor of it, at least, the name), no stranger to excess and debauchery, would find Baz's rendition of Gatsby's house parties too dazzling to look upon.I totally understand where Baz was coming from with this production: he wanted to capture for a 21st century audience the absolute extravagance, wild fiscal post-war optimism and cutting-edge pop culture explosion in music, dance, materialism, media, and social mores--all marinated liberally in alcohol--that earmarked the Jazz Age. A more sedate and faithful hewing to 1920s period would not have achieved that, since 20 and 30-somethings going to movies today associate the 1920s with, not their grandparents' generation, but their great-grandparents' or even their great-great-parents'. But for those who were young in the 1920s, those were dangerous, exhilarating, completely 'modern' times. So Baz transposes motifs from today's youth culture on Gatsby's world to convey the modernity, the sexual freedom, the licentiousness and the lawlessness of that time for those of us who are reduced to reading about it in books. Had MTV been around in 1925, it surely would have been broadcasting from one of Gatsby's parties on Long Island . . and Jay-Z would have been DJ. One has to make peace with this idea in order to enjoy Baz's version.Our quartet of leads all do impressive work. I was initially dubious about Leo DiCaprio in the part of Gatsby, but I think he nails the quintessential paradox of Jay Gatsby: Handsome and self-assured on the surface; underneath a roiling sea of self-doubt, social insecurity, longing and rage. When this Jay Gatsby lets the unruffled faade slip and shows his internal darkness, the onlookers have no difficulty believing that he could have killed a man, easily. Leo has developed a manly heft and gravitas as an actor that would not have been thought possible in his &#34;Titanic&#34; heartthrob days, when he was a callow and skinny 23-year-old who looked younger. His Gatsby is quite excellent, though slightly marred by an odd, self-conscious accent that I suppose is meant to be 'posh Atlantic'. He would have done better to use his own. When Gatsby calls people 'old sport' (often), it sounds particularly labored. &#34;Old sport&#34; sounded much more natural coming from Redford.Tobey Maguire is alternately appealing and annoying as our narrator, Nick Carroway. Nick is definitely a more challenging role than Maguire's best known 'Peter Parker/Spiderman' schtick. He captures well enough the 'outsider looking in' essence of Nick, but it's hard to accept him at the grownups' table sometimes. In comparison to DiCaprio or Joel Edgerton as Tom (a noteworthy performance from him, capturing the tricky mix of brutality and masculine charisma in Daisy's husband), Maguire seems like a 12-year-old boy who's wandered into his great-great-granddaddy's closet by mistake. Baz frames the novel as Nick's recollections to his psychiatrist in the sanitarium where he's been sent to dry out.This movie was shot entirely in Sydney, Australia, and most of the dizzy panoramic views of Fitzgerald's New York City and its environs are entirely computer-generated. It visually stuns, and I mean one feels quite literally assaulted from all the visual and aural stimuli . . but there is an essentially hollow feeling, too. Of course, Fitzgerald's New York no longer exists . . but it still feels like a cheat. Even Nick's charming little cottage in West Egg, my favorite set of the film is actually 3 or 4 locations cobbled together. A legendary rainy season delayed filming for months in the outside locations meant to represent Long Island's bucolic summer beaches and tree-lined estates.",4,Jazz Babies Meet Hip-Hop With Surprising Results,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,4067,"['expectations', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'movie', 'infused', 'unmistakable', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'imprint', 'director', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'scenarios', 'possible', 'then', '30', '%', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'Here', '34', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', '34', 'meets', '34', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', '34', 'acid', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'chronicler', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'inventor', 'least', 'name', 'stranger', 'excess', 'debauchery', 'would', 'find', 'Baz', 'rendition', 'Gatsby', 'house', 'parties', 'too', 'dazzling', 'look', 'upon.I', 'totally', 'understand', 'where', 'Baz', 'was', 'coming', 'production', 'wanted', 'capture', '21st', 'century', 'audience', 'absolute', 'extravagance', 'wild', 'fiscal', 'post-war', 'optimism', 'cutting-edge', 'pop', 'culture', 'explosion', 'music', 'dance', 'materialism', 'media', 'social', 'mores', 'marinated', 'liberally', 'alcohol', 'earmarked', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'A', 'more', 'sedate', 'faithful', 'hewing', '1920s', 'period', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'achieved', '20', '30-somethings', 'going', 'movies', 'today', 'associate', '1920s', 'not', 'grandparents', 'generation', 'great-grandparents', 'even', 'great-great-parents', 'who', 'were', 'young', '1920s', 'were', 'dangerous', 'exhilarating', 'completely', ""'modern"", 'times', 'So', 'Baz', 'transposes', 'motifs', 'today', 'youth', 'culture', 'Gatsby', 'world', 'convey', 'modernity', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'licentiousness', 'lawlessness', 'time', 'who', 'are', 'reduced', 'reading', 'books', 'Had', 'MTV', 'been', '1925', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'broadcasting', 'one', 'Gatsby', 'parties', 'Long', 'Island', 'Jay-Z', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'DJ', 'One', 'make', 'peace', 'idea', 'order', 'enjoy', 'Baz', 'version.Our', 'quartet', 'leads', 'do', 'impressive', 'work', 'was', 'initially', 'dubious', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'part', 'Gatsby', 'think', 'quintessential', 'paradox', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'Handsome', 'self-assured', 'surface', 'roiling', 'sea', 'self-doubt', 'social', 'insecurity', 'longing', 'rage', 'When', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'unruffled', 'faade', 'slip', 'internal', 'darkness', 'onlookers', 'have', 'difficulty', 'believing', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'man', 'easily', 'Leo', 'developed', 'manly', 'heft', 'gravitas', 'actor', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'thought', 'possible', '34', 'Titanic', '34', 'heartthrob', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'callow', 'skinny', '23-year-old', 'who', 'looked', 'younger', 'Gatsby', 'quite', 'excellent', 'though', 'slightly', 'marred', 'odd', 'self-conscious', 'accent', 'suppose', 'meant', 'be', ""'posh"", 'Atlantic', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'use', 'own', 'When', 'Gatsby', 'people', 'sport', 'often', 'particularly', 'labored', '34', 'Old', 'sport', '34', 'sounded', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'coming', 'Redford.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'alternately', 'appealing', 'annoying', 'narrator', 'Nick', 'Carroway', 'Nick', 'definitely', 'more', 'challenging', 'role', 'Maguire', 'best', 'known', ""'Peter"", 'Parker/Spiderman', 'schtick', 'well', 'enough', ""'outsider"", 'looking', 'essence', 'Nick', 'hard', 'accept', 'grownups', 'table', 'sometimes', 'comparison', 'DiCaprio', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Tom', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'capturing', 'tricky', 'mix', 'brutality', 'masculine', 'charisma', 'Daisy', 'husband', 'Maguire', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'wandered', 'great-great-granddaddy', 'closet', 'mistake', 'Baz', 'novel', 'Nick', 'recollections', 'psychiatrist', 'sanitarium', 'where', 'been', 'sent', 'dry', 'out.This', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Sydney', 'Australia', 'most', 'dizzy', 'panoramic', 'views', 'Fitzgerald', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'environs', 'are', 'entirely', 'computer-generated', 'visually', 'mean', 'one', 'quite', 'literally', 'assaulted', 'visual', 'aural', 'stimuli', 'essentially', 'hollow', 'feeling', 'too', 'course', 'Fitzgerald', 'New', 'York', 'no', 'longer', 'still', 'cheat', 'Even', 'Nick', 'charming', 'little', 'cottage', 'West', 'Egg', 'favorite', 'set', 'film', 'actually', '3', '4', 'locations', 'cobbled', 'together', 'legendary', 'rainy', 'season', 'delayed', 'filming', 'months', 'outside', 'locations', 'meant', 'represent', 'Long', 'Island', 'bucolic', 'summer', 'beaches', 'tree-lined', 'estates']",The Great Gatsby 2013

Also, as a fan of the book, there was a particular dialogue that made the book and the original movie that was critically altered in this film, ""rich girls don't marry poor boys"" (Daisy to Gatsby in the book and in the 1974 film). In the new film this line was muttered by an insignificant character to Carroway in reference to his crush on Ms. Jordan Baker. Also, the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy is a bit skewed.

Lawrence tells us in Women in Love. In the same way we are dealing with love in the upper class of the very rich  before the First World War and then after before the big crisis of 1929. I will not compare the two here but the two films also came out in the same period, the early 1970s after the 1968 political and generational crisis. They both carry the denunciation of the upper class.We are telling the story from an outside point of view but yet close to the protagonists. The story teller, Mr. Nick Carraway, is a neighbor of Mr. Jay Gatsby and a bond seller in Wall Street, New York. Nothing to do with present time golden boys, the traders in Brokerage firms. Well-off but definitely not rich and anyway with no rich parents. Yet he is the cousin of another woman who is from an extremely rich family, married to an extremely rich man. Gatsby is the black sheep in the neighborhood.He is from an extremely poor family. He managed to get an Oxford education after 1918 because he became an officer and was heavily decorated during the war and he then took advantage of veterans&#8217; privileges. He had also the chance to fall in the hands of a certain Meyer Wolfsheim who introduced him to business, though we are never told what that business really is. We can imagine, due to the speed with which he became rich (less than eight years) that it had to be in some financial speculation in the 1920s. That period is clearly identified with the paraphernalia of the time and with the music, including the dancing, including the famous song Charleston. Note that Jay might not be a real first name, but an initial and that the name Gatsby is not the real name of the man who was the son of  a certain Mr. Gatz we see at the end. Note too that the name Wolfsheim is of course meaningful and the main principle of this man is &#8220;we can be a friend of a man when he is alive, but not when he is dead.&#8221;At the end of WWI, Jay Gatsby, alias Major Gatz, fell in love with Daisy, a rich girl. But he was a poor man. She fell in love with him on a short-lived whim and he fell in love with her forever. But a rich girl does not marry a poor boy, as she says so well. So he disappears to build a fortune and she got married to a rich boy and became Mrs. Daisy Buchanan.  She had promised to wait but rich girls never wait.When he is finally rich he manages to get close to her and then to be introduced to her by her cousin, Nick Carraway, and before he had tried to attract her attention by having enormous garden parties every week end in that summer of 1926 or 1927. She eventually falls in the trap.The rest is to be discovered in the film, or the book.The morality, bad word, the immorality of this film is that in spite of the American Dream, rich people attract and mix with rich people and poor people can only eventually be accepted when they are rich. The second lesson is that rich people with a rich pedigree can always manage to get through any crime or accident or whatever particularly by pointing at another of their class but that does not have the rich pedigree they have. This immorality can even be worse: rich men can have as many poor mistresses they will furnish with some luxury as much, and as many, as they want or can afford. But a rich woman is not supposed to have any affair with a rich man of any sort, and she will not condescend to have an affair with a poor man. It would not be in anyway anything but a short and exciting sexual episode that would be doomed even before it starts, and like the praying mantis she would destroy the poor lover after using it.In other words a woman is the property of her husband but in no way the husband is the property of his wife, and social inequality is absolute in the USA, just like in Great Britain, in the 1920s just the way Henry James described it in his novels more than thirty years before. Nothing has changed.The narrator is able to express this immorality and that is the only moral element in this film, and novel. Morality is on the side here of the upper middle class, and a lower stratum in that upper middle class. That means there may be some hope for such a society that is doomed because the rich do not care for their neighbors in all the meanings of this word. They only care for their money and the gossips that can be aired around them about them.This older film shows these elements with great care but at the same time it is obvious Jay Gatsby is not natural as a rich man. He is not able to play the game properly: he is awkward, he is shy, he is inconsiderate in his presents and in his lavish help he may give to someone who is trying to make him realize one of his intentions or desires. One hundred white roses are not even enough in such a situation and he very well may send one thousand. The dialogue is good too in the fact that Jay Gatsby is the only one who has a linguistic idiosyncratic tick and he calls every man &#8220;old sport&#8221; and such an Oxfordian tic shows in him a rather recent integration in the class of the super rich: he cuts a role, a character, a behavior and sticks to it: he believes in a way the tuxedo makes the money aristocrat. And he is wrong: the money aristocrat is in the careless and nonchalant way he wears the tuxedo and that cannot be imitated.All together a beautiful but cruel film on the egocentric selfishness of the super rich born super rich.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,"The book is stiff, the film remains icy",1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,5561,"['GREAT', 'GATSBY', '8211', '1974To', 'really', 'understand', 'film',

His cottage is next door to Gatsby's mansion, so they become friends. By the way, Daisy is his cousin.* Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Rango"") is Myrtle, Tom Buchanan's lover. She lives over a service station on the road to New York City.* Jason Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lawless"") is George Wilson, the guy we come to pity.

But then I'm just one lone voice, shouting from the distance.  When it comes down to it, this retelling of ""The Great Gatsby"", will most likely be a hit (for all the wrong reasons).I'm an opinionated old coot (born in 1955), who grew up listening to old movies, old music and reading old books.  I love Jazz, adore Gershwin, and other music from the 20's.  So I guess I've always been a little off key and out of step with so called popular entertainment.  That said, trash is trash regardless of when or how it's created.  Luhrmann's lurid retelling of ""The Great Gatsby"" fails miserably on so many levels it reduced me to tears.The soundtrack and music are jarringly uncomfortable and not even remotely close to the type of music popular during the 20s, let alone described within the pages of Fitzgerald's Gatsby.  It's almost as if Luhrmann believes Jazz is too archaic for modern (translation: younger) viewers to enjoy let alone comprehend.Technically stunning, with astonishing attention to detail, I'm saddened beyond words for what this movie could have been.  Gorgeous visual elements created by combining  20s achiaval film and graphics along with state of the art CGI and newly created film ::: all thrown together in a never ending frenetic 3D display.  Exhausting to watch, confusing to follow and boring in ways difficult to describe.  Simply too much excess, too much noise, too much bad behavior, too much vulgarity and too much of everything else.The visual effects out shine almost everything real in this movie.  The movie is filled with so much visual imagry, movement, music and noise as to obscure the actors.  For me, much of the movie's substance was lost in the cacophony.  In a way I felt as if I were watching a movie that had been filmed from a speeding car ::: everything's a bright vivid confusing and noisy blur.I found Luhrmann's schizophrenogenic version of ""The Great Gatsby"" difficult to watch and oddly depressing for ALL the wrong reasons.  But don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and then decide.The CastJay Gatsby: Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Gatsby.  I would have loved to see him act in a less manic movie.Nick Carraway: Tobey Maguire (an actor I admire greatly) comes across like a wide eyed nebbish totally out of his depth.  But then that could be how Luhrmann wanted him to act.Tom Buchanan: Joel Edgerton comes across as boorish, vulgar and lascivious in the extreme.

Romeo & Juliet, Australia, and Moulin Rouge were for me mildly entertaining and moderately successful, but while I have been able to appreciate his vision, I have always felt there was something that does not quite gel. Until now.Before seeing this film, I always thought Gatsby was unworkable as a movie adaptation. The 1974 Jack Clayton effort felt stiff and insincere. Even screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola practically disowned it. I vaguely suspected this was not the fault of the director or actors, but that perhaps Gatsby was simply untranslatable to film. I was wrong.Fortunately, Baz Luhrmann has finally found his calling. His attention to detail coupled with his absolute rejection of subtlety works for Gatsby. He manages to retain the symbolism, pushing image after image in the faces of the viewers. This is especially noticeable by those who have viewed this in 3D.His brazen approach is matched with an incredible attention to detail. For example, the ""man in the cool shirt"" is shown several times early on in the film on the New York billboard. Also, Nick Carroway is clearly portrayed as Fitzgerald himself who was negatively impacted by the East-coast lifestyle of the 1920s.Direction aside, the soundtrack to this film is incredible! It would have been easy to use only period music, but instead the film includes music by newer artists who use 1920s elements. Rather than watching and thinking, ""This is a period piece,"" the music along with the in-your-face direction and production invite the audience to feel the excitement of the 1920s. It is just plain fun!In conclusion, this is an adaptation that finally does the novel justice.

Over four decades later, ""Lolita"" was re-made, starring Jeremy Irons and faithful to the novel -- and it was almost impossible to watch.  Movies too loyal to the original novels are hard to watch in general, but the truth of the matter is that neither ""Lolita"" and ""The Great Gatsy"" were very good novels to begin with.""The Great Gatsy"" is a novel that everyone had to endure in high school, as high school teachers love it for its bloated metaphors, vast imagery, and empty symbolism.  The main character is Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who dreamed himself a fantastical life to pursue the woman of his dreams, but the real protagonist is Nick Carraway who straddles West Egg and East Egg, old money and new money, and finds himself disgusted and disillusioned by both, but strangely drawn to Gatsby.This new film adaptation of the novel is both carelessly unfaithful and zealously loyal to the novel.  On one hand, the movie is too extravagant, so great is the exaggeration of America's Jazz Age that the movie feels campy.  On the other hand, the movie follows the main plot of the novel, which is neither interesting nor clever.That said, both Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan offer excellent performances, and are each in their own distinctive way charismatic on the screen.  Unfortunately, the real disappointment is Leonardo DiCaprio, who has recently played a string of larger than life characters -- Howard Hughes and Jay Edgar Hoover, for example -- but in being asked to play the greatest larger than life character of them all he offers a meek and understated performance.The film's main failing is that there's no chemistry at all between DiCaprio and Mulligan, and we're left wondering why the two are attracted to each other in the first place.  Mulligan is listless and lazy, stupid and careless -- and we just don't understand how someone so devoid of charm and personality can enter into DiCaprio's heart until it consumes his being.  It's endearing that a man who is constantly re-inventing himself and living in a castle in the sky could be so utterly devoted to a mundane woman so that he's left sweaty and speechless in front of her -- but it's just not believable.The movie is like Gatsby himself -- unsure of himself, sweating and grasping for that ephemeral green light that may or may not exist across the harbor.",3,"Visually Stunning and Gorgeous, but too Earnest and Grasping",1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,2479,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'interpretation', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'Lolita', 'strayed', 'so', 'far', 'original', 'Nabokov', 'immediately', 'disowned', 'four', 'decades', 'later', 'Lolita', 'was', 're-made', 'starring', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'faithful', 'novel', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'watch', 'Movies', 'too', 'loyal', 'original', 'novels', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'general', 'truth', 'matter', 'Lolita', 'Great', 'Gatsy', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'novels', 'begin', 'Great', 'Gatsy', 'novel', 'everyone', 'had', 'endure', 'high', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'teachers', 'love', 'bloated', 'metaphors', 'vast', 'imagery', 'empty', 'symbolism', 'main', 'character', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'self-made', 'millionaire', 'who', 'dreamed', 'fantastical', 'life', 'pursue', 'woman', 'dreams', 'real', 'protagonist', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'who', 'West', 'Egg', 'East', 'Egg', 'old', 'money', 'new', 'money', 'disgusted', 'disillusioned', 'strangely', 'drawn', 'Gatsby.This', 'new', 'film', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'carelessly', 'unfaithful', 'zealously', 'loyal', 'novel', 'one', 'hand', 'movie', 'too', 'extravagant', 'so', 'great', 'exaggeration', 'America', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'movie', 'campy', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'main', 'plot', 'novel', 'interesting', 'clever.That', 'said', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'offer', 'excellent', 'performances', 'are', 'own', 'distinctive', 'way', 'charismatic', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'real', 'disappointment', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'recently', 'played', 'string', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Jay', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'example', 'being', 'asked', 'play', 'greatest', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'meek', 'understated', 'performance.The', 'film', 'main', 'failing', 'chemistry', 'DiCaprio', 'Mulligan', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'two', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'first', 'place', 'Mulligan', 'listless', 'lazy', 'stupid', 'careless', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'someone', 'so', 'devoid', 'charm', 'personality', 'can', 'enter', 'DiCaprio', 'heart', 'being', 'endearing', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 're-inventing', 'living', 'castle', 'sky', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'utterly', 'devoted', 'mundane', 'woman', 'so', 'left', 'sweaty', 'speechless', 'front', 'just', 'not', 'believable.The', 'movie', 'Gatsby', 'unsure', 'sweating', 'grasping', 'ephemeral', 'green', 'light', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'exist', 'harbor']",The Great Gatsby 2013

Although that earlier movie was very good, I was never a big fan as I thought that it lacked a certain flair. So, my loathing for this modern version is based solely on its lack of merit. It is a cartoon that frequently can be mistaken for a spoof.I knew beforehand that the soundtrack was mainly composed of rap and hip hop. As disappointing as that is for me (who loves the music of the 1920s and usually deplores ahistorical touches in period pieces), even that wasn't a deal breaker, as such music could accurately convey the bacchanalian frenzy of the 1920s to a modern audience. However, the choice of music was a portent. The entire movie was completely dumbed down for the benefit of an audience of modern American simpletons. Everything, and I mean everything, had to be spelled out and explicitly explained. Nuance, implication, subtlety and respect for the audience are non-existent here, and probably for good reason, as American audiences under 50 years old neither understand nor desire to watch anything more complex than good looking people having sex. When the movie showed a woman from the early 1920s_explaining_who Kaiser Wilhelm_was_(""you know- the evil German king""), I was determined to throw the DVD right in the garbage.As if the superstructure of the movie (the script and plot) wasn't bad enough, the actors were deficient as well. DiCaprio was appropriately elegant and handsome, but seemed to be concentrating too hard on maintaining his strange accent to do any heartfelt acting. The actress who played Daisy is not the type of woman to inspire the type of devotion that she was supposed to have enflamed in Gatsby; she looked like a 12 year old hobbit. And Tobey McGuire's Nick Carraway is just too unbelievably goofy looking and sounding to take seriously. That anyone would want to associate with this clownish jester is just not credible. The only really good performance came from Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan who is convincingly brutish and dominating, the type of man who would both repel and attract Daisy.There are just too many elements that deserve censure. What they all amount to in the end is a failure of a movie that insults its source material and any intelligent audience.",1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Completely dumbed down.

But do not let that fool you.  It is not slow or boring in ANY way.  The movie starts out extremely odd.  VERY flashy.  Full of bright lights, fun music and odd people.  The only way I can describe it is this, imagine a Disney movie set in the 30s.  It is that way for a reason though.  They are trying to show you the way Gatsby lives.  After about 40 or so minutes, it gets more settled down and begins to resemble a normal movie.  Though you almost wish it would continue being the way it was.  A man who wishes to be a writer, ends up working in stocks.  He lives next door to a man named Gatsby.  They end up talking and the man gets drawn into the amazing, bright, rich, fabulous world that is the life of Gatsby.  Gatsby holds many mysteries.  There are a lot of rumors about him and how he got all of his money.  Over time the man will become friends with and learn many things about Gatsby.  He finds out that there is really only one and one thing only Gatsby really wants.  It is what he has created his entire image for.  What may come as a surprise though, is that this thing that is wanted by Gatsby, may not want or may not know what she wants.  In the end, if you really think about what you have seen, it is his expectations of this person wanting the same thing as him and the fact that he made a friend that may lead to his demise.I hope that is not confusing.  I can say a few things extra.  I am 28 and have really began to appreciate movies.  All the work and time that goes into them.  That being said, this movie is one of the most brilliantly stunning movies that I have or will ever see.  It is so bright and flashy.  Everything looks so authentic.  As I said, the beginning of the movie is very over the top.  If you do not think you will like it, wait about 40 minutes.  It begins to transform from one art form into another.  You learn the story of the man who is Gatsby.  You learn of the thing he truly wants in life.  You being to see his own true sadness and really want him to succeed.  It really is his live for one and friendship of another that leads to his biggest problem.  I do not want to say what happens.  Watch the movie.  When it is done, think about all the events that made the man go to the place he did.  Realize what made the things become that which they were and you will understand what I am talking about.  If not, please email me and I will tell you what I mean.  Such an amazing movie.  One that I will truly be proud to own.The reason I gave this is four is this.  The movie is about 2 hours and 20 minutes long.  At a point, you feel like everything has happened.  You wonder what else they can do.  You kind of feel it is a bit drug on.  That will go away.

Also, neither Leonardo DiCaprio nor Tobey Maguire are favorites of mine.  So I was pleasantly surprised to be totally intrigued, entertained, and even touched by the film and its story of two deeply flawed characters and their tragic tale.  I found DiCaprio (Gatsby) and Maguire (Gatsby's friend Nick) to be quite satisfying in their roles as was Joel Edgerton (Daisy's husband Tom) who was new to me.  I was already sold on Carey Mulligan (Daisy) from her role in Drive.

There are many words I can use to describe The Great Gatsby and none of them are positive. It took less than four minutes for this film to turn me off and inform me, ""Yup, everything you feared is true. You wanna walk out now and save yourself the time?"" To be completely honest I should have because The Great Gatsby felt like two and a half hours of torture. They took everything this film could, and should, have been and tossed it out the window. Instead of attempting to make a film that would go down in history as a classic, they went the easy route and set their sights on the teenage audience. Not only is this film disrespectful to F. Scott Fitzgerald, but it does a great disservice to the source material.I should note that I was never particularly fond of The Great Gatsby to begin with. I thought the story itself was enjoyable enough, but Fitzgerald's writing style was very... odd. Plus, I always felt that the novel just wasn't good from a literary standpoint. However, I thought that, if done right, it would make for a great piece of film. Which was why I was so excited when this movie was first announced. My excitement was only enhanced when I found out that you had DiCaprio playing Gatsby and Maguire playing Nick, what could go wrong? Apparently a lot could go wrong because somewhere along the line someone suggested ""let's modernize it"" and the end result was disastrous.For those unfamiliar with the story you have man named Nick Carraway, the narrator, who lives next door to a very wealthy man by the name of Jay Gatsby. Now Gatsby is sort of an enigma. No one really knows who he is or where he came from so, of course, people start making up rumors about him. Gatsby frequently throws huge, extravagant parties at his mansion. No one ever receives an invitation and only a handful of people actually know what he looks like. We later learn that all of this is done in the hopes that Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), a woman from his past and Nick's cousin, would show up one day. The problem is that Daisy is a married woman now, but it's obvious that there's still that connection between the two of them. He loves her and she loves him, but she also loves her husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton). In the end what you're given is a story filled with secrets, death, and the consequences of one man's love for a woman.The one and only thing this movie does well is the fact that they basically took the book page by page and transferred it into a film. Majority of the time film adaptions leave stuff out or they change big events, but they did a very good job at sticking to the source material. I only noticed a few minor differences with the first being that the story is told by Nick to a therapist. I don't remember that being part of the novel, but I think this was done just to give the story some sort of context. Then they had Gatsby overuse the phrase ""Old sport"". It was a common phrase of his, but he didn't say it in almost every single sentence. It got a little annoying after a while. Oh, and it seemed as if they downplayed Jordan Baker's (Elizabeth Debicki) role. She just didn't feel as important as she did in the book. Keep in mind that none of these were major gripes, just observations. As we were leaving the theater I overheard a woman say ""They were really accurate with the story."" Which is absolutely true. It's almost insane how accurate they were with everything, but accuracy doesn't mean a damn thing if everything else in the movie is done wrong and, unfortunately, everything else is very wrong.As odd as it sounds the person I blame the most is Jay-Z. From the moment it was announced that he was chosen to ""compose"" the film's soundtrack I knew it was doomed. Having Jay-Z in charge of a movie's soundtrack just screams ""modernization"" and I was right. My biggest issue with The Great Gatsby is the music that fills the scenes. Answer me this: why in the hell would you have a bunch of modern music in a movie set in the 1920's? It's almost hilarious how big this man's ego is. Not only did he screw up the soundtrack by not including music from that time period, but he put four of his own songs in the film. Not one, not two, four. Why? WHY?!? From a music standpoint the Hip Hop we know today (rhyming over beats) didn't get created until the 70's. So why would you do that? What purpose did it serve other than to boost your own ego? Oh, and trust me, it's not just music that's played over the scenes for the viewers to hear. The music is actually in the scenes. During one of Gatsby's parties when Nick and Jordan are in the library and they meet the man who looks like an owl, you can hear the bass thumping from outside the room like they're at a high school party. I wanted to scream and chuck my drink at the screen. All this film needed was someone to compose a powerful score. That's it. It didn't need all that flair and it definitely didn't need music from artists that weren't even thought of yet.Unfortunately Jay-Z isn't the only thing wrong with this film. Almost everything that had to do with the technical side of film making is beyond terrible. During the parts where Nick was narrating what's going on you see words flying across the screen because he's typing this story on a type writer. Not only is this effect overdone in the film industry, it takes the viewer out of the experience because it's overdone in the film itself. There's a section towards the end of the movie where the screen is literally filled with letters and words. It reached a point where it stopped serving an artistic purpose and they were doing it just to do it. Then the amount of green screen they used was almost hilarious. Almost every single piece of scenery is fake. What's worse is that the scenes that use the green screen aren't even believable because they don't look real. Just like the letters flying across the screen, the green screen is overdone as well. The only thing the green screen accomplished was making it difficult for the viewer to appreciate the physical sets that were used because by that point it's hard to care. Once again all this does is take the viewer out of the experience.The film excels when it acts as a film and nothing more. When there's actors doing a scene, reciting the script, and making the novel come alive. A great example would be when Gatsby first brings Daisy to his house. When he's showing her around and DeCaprio, Maguire, and Mulligan are just acting. It's a wonderful thing to watch because it's what it needs to be. It's simple and it's engaging. There's a fine line between making the scenes grand and explosive and making them over the top and annoying. I truly believe that Baz Luhrmann doesn't comprehend the difference. There's just so much wrong with this film's execution that it almost hurt me to watch it.It may have been a bit of an exaggeration when I said the only thing good about the film was the fact that they stuck to the source material. That isn't entirely true. The cast in here was, surprisingly, great. I never pictured DiCaprio as Gatsby or Debicki as Jordan, but it would be wrong to deny that they both gave great performances. DiCaprio is DiCaprio so you can't really go wrong with him and Maguire gave a solid performance as Nick. Nothing spectacular, but he served his purpose. Out of everyone involved I think Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton were the best choices for their respective roles. They're how I envisioned the characters while reading the novel and they both delivered fantastic performances.Overall Score: 5/10 - It's almost depressing how much of a disappointment this was. The film's final 30 minutes are what I expected the entire movie to feel like; powerful and moving, but that's not what I was given. Any enjoyment that can been found in The Great Gatsby is buried beneath the god awful music and the overdone special effects. Baz Luhrmann was perhaps too ambitious in what he set out to do here and the film is ultimately ruined because of it. There's no doubt in my mind that there's going to be a young audience who finds this fascinating, but for those with a more developed mind this is nothing more than a movie that will soon be forgotten. A faint memory of what could have been. I can't say I will ever watch this again so see this at your own risk.",3,5/10 - A disastrous disappointment,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,8402,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed',

Thomason ""Movie Family""","[0, 0]","Bowling for Movies Score: 124.781 of 300 (which kind of stinks, we wanted to love this movie)What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]The Great Gatsby - We own the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet Combo PackMovie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):Nick Carraway, a somewhat reserved bond salesman in the rip-roaring 20's has an appointment with destiny when he accepts the invite of his `married to a blue blood' cousin, Daisy Buchanan and her husband (and Nick's college friend) Tom.  After Tom introduces Nick to his mistress (a strumpet and gas station owner's wife) and a multitude of slumming it friends, Nick begins to spiral into the decadent life which culminates in an invite from his next door neighbor - the very mysterious Jay Gatsby.  Very long story short (in a Bowling for Movies lightning round) Gatsby = new money; Buchanan = old money; Daisy = married for the money; Nick = go-between for Gatsby and Daisy (who apparently fell in love prior to the War to End All Wars but she couldn't wait for him); Mysterious Letter = Still Mysterious - and I watched the whole film.  Much drama and tragedy ensues.  Note to self: no swimming at Gatsby's house.You ever see an ad for some really good food... you couldn't help it, the T.G.I.Friday's rib platter just looked so good on the T.V.  You find yourself thinking about those delicious looking ribs all day until you finally just can't contain yourself any longer and you head on down to the nearest strip mall, pull in, and nearly run to the door - your mouth salivating painfully.  You sit down, it's noisy in here... real noisy but hey, those ribs will make it all worthwhile.  You exchange loud words with the waitress who can't seem to get your order straight (because she can't hear you any better than you can hear her) and you hope for the best.  Hey, at least you ordered the cheesy sticks appetizers, you know, to get the evening headed in the right direction.  While you wait (they still haven't brought the drinks yet) you realize two things at the same time... the sun is shining RIGHT IN YOUR eye off a Ford Taurus in the parking lot and you've stuck your pant leg to a wad of gum someone ""thoughtfully"" left under the table.  You look at your watch as you watch the sun move down the sky and 20, 30, 40 minutes go by... still no cheesy sticks, but hey, at least you got your Coke (but what is that aftertaste???  Did they give you a Diet Coke?)  Your waitress seems to have an uncanny ability to NEVER look your way every time she walks by and even your, ""Excuse me, Miss??!!??"" was ignored but it's so loud in here she probably couldn't have heard you even if you were right next to her.  40 minutes turns into an hour and you look at the `fun and wacky' farm implements, kitchen tools, old pictures, and other visual candy they have tacked up on the wall one more time... maybe you missed some interesting tidbit between the old license plates and the picture of dogs playing poker.... Nope, guess not.  Finally the waitress flies by and drops a plate of disappointment in front of you - still no cheesy sticks - and you get a good look at your dinner.  Are those ribs?  Why is the sauce that off color orange and dried on the plate.  The fries are soggy and instead of cooked to a golden brown remind you more of a jaundice victim.  A McRib sandwich at McDonald's tastes better but at least you paid a premium to get it.  Yup, that's what watching The Great Gatsby was like this afternoon.Ok, let me be honest - I couldn't tell if I liked the movie or not after we watched this and neither could Mrs. Movie Dude or Little Miss Movie Dude.  Visually striking but cartoonish... musically extravagant and Hip Hop sore thumb... story about hope that had none... it was a movie of paradoxes.  Stylistically it was 100% Baz Lurrmann but in a very pedestrian, been there done that way - nearly feels like Moulin Rouge rebooted.  Admittedly, we are not really big on tragic stories but even still... this one just felt like it was missing something.  It left us feeling like microwaved and set under a heat lamp rib platter at T.G.I. Friday's.What I loved:* The costumes and other period visuals were decadent... rich silks, art-deco everything, sumptuous over the top parties... everything was beautiful to behold.* This movie was cast fantastically - Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton and Elizabeth Debicki were clearly the right team to bring the story to the screen - better direction and story development would have brought out their talent more vibrantly* The third dimension - wowza, the 3D was wonderfully rendered; no ghosting or double images and also very artfully used - we are not the ""needs to poke me in the eye to be called good 3D"" people but rather we look for 3D to help draw us into the story, GREAT 3D makes you feel immersedWhat I did NOT like:* Jay-Z failed miserably in pulling together a modern version of the jazz culture represented in the original novel - there is absolutely NO PARALELL between Hip Hop and authentic Jazz, the former not qualifying in many people's minds as music (it being rhythmic speaking set to borrowed sounds) and the latter attaining true art stature - the result was the soundtrack equivalent of a loud belch during a melodic opera - rude, crude, and NOT appreciated; to see anachronism done right, watch the Baz Lurhman prequel to this, better known as Moulin Rouge* While I am nearly positive that the visually stunning first half of the movie dropping suddenly to a nearly dreary last half of the movie was done on purpose, the contrast in styles from beginning to end was clumsily done - almost like the art department changed hands mid-way thru and the new team had a different vision of what the flick should look likeHey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

The atmosphere of the movie is like that of a party you've always wanted to go to but never been invited. Visually it's stunning in almost every single shot (largely due to green screen and other digital effects).

So we (like everyone else in the theater) are subjected to the trailers that begin each feature.The trailers for Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby looked awful, frenetic and shallow. Plus, we saw them month after month after month after month. We got sick of them. And we started to wonder why the trailers were being shown (seemingly) 6-9 months before the movie was released. That had to be a bad sign.Fresh out of even half-way decent movies to watch, we thought we'd give The Great Gatsby a try. But not at the first-run theaters. We waited until it appeared at the local cheap theater.In fact, ""we"" didn't wait for it at all. I went to see it by myself while my wife out of town on business. I didn't want to waste another $3.99 on a ticket for her.The movie blew me away. It was compelling, emotional, creative, and seemingly very in tune with the spirit of Fitzgerald's book. The ending moved me greatly. I left the theater stunned.When my wife returned from her business trip, the first thing we did was go see The Great Gatsby.She was as moved as I was.We left (me, after seeing it a second time) vowing to buy the Blu-ray the day it comes out.I doubt we'll ever be big DiCaprio fans. He's just not that good of an actor. But Carey Mulligan is always a treat, and the rest of the cast was decent, too. Even Tobey McGuire, another actor we don't particularly care for.Yet, all of them together work. The whole movie works. The Luhrmann style captured the craziness of the era without going overboard into a too-busy, too-loud movie.This version of The Great Gatsby beats the 1974 movie starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. By a long shot. Compared to this version, the Redford/Farrow film looks even more lame. And it was pretty darn lame.My advice is this: Give it a try. Go see it at a second-run theater. Or buy the movie when it's released. It's a very good film, far more compelling and accessible than Luhrmann usually is, and quite a good yarn.As for me, I'll buy this Blu-ray version the day its released...and watch it a third time.

1512600,A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B0067EKYS6,JWink,"[1, 1]","""Gatsby"" is a movie about would-be writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan  (Joel Edgerton). It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits.Gatsby is based on the classic American novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I remember this being required reading in high school back in the day as an example of a great novel.  Although I didn't really appreciate the novel for what it was back then, I realize now that this was a great telling of the times in the 20's.The director does a good job at recreating the era of the 1920s, but also gives it a modern edge and a flair that could only be captured in the world of film.  Some people are critizing the modern music choices in the film as opposed to the music of the era, but that didn't bother me and I thought gave it a good backdrop for the excesses of the time that reflect some of the excesses of the modern era.Gatsby is beautifully made and shows the glitz and glam of the era.Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job with the character and I feel at times doesn't get enough credit for playing character roles.  In fact, all the main characters do admirable jobs in bringing their characters to life.The 2013 Gatsby is not the 1925 version of the Great Gatsby, and it simply can't be but that doesn't necessarily a bad thing.

The splendor of Gatsby's mansion is recreated exquisitely, and the ""valley of ashes"" doesn't disappoint in its ghastly wasteland.Second, Luhrmann doesn't depart from the story too much, though I think there was a lot more discourse between Gatsby and Daisy than I remember reading in the book.  He may have changed some of the dialogue, but he does stay unflinchingly true to the spirit of the book and its morals, which I think is vastly more important.Third, the casting was perfect, and probably the most telling detail about Luhrmann's good judgment in making this film- DeCaprio is the embodiment of Gatsby--the smile, the charm, the mannerisms are all what one reading the book would expect him to be like.  Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was also a great pick -- he has the 'outsider' qualities required for the role of the narrator.  Debicki as Jordan Baker was also very well-cast; she had the aloof coolness and the slightly-bored gaze I pictured when I read the novel.  Daisy, by far, was the most crucial casting in my opinion, because if played too obnoxiously and over-the-top, the whole story falls flat.  However, Carey Mulligan makes her flighty and airy but also lets her show real emotion.  In a way, though her character does horrible things in the movie, you can't help but feel that she isn't completely devoid of thought/emotion.  And of course, her husband Tom, makes the antagonist as a macho-man whose emotions occasionally seep through to the surface.Honestly, with all the good things this movie had going for it, the anachronistic music surprisingly didn't bother me one bit.  It was also clever how jazz motifs were mixed in with hip-hop and rap beats, somehow making the sound swirl into an unidentifiable, chaotic experience.Overall, this was a phenomenal adaptation and definitely a must for any Gatsby fan.",5,Chilling depiction of the excess of the 20's,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,2096,"['fan', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'DeCaprio', 'undeniably', 'Gatsby', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'for.First', 'set', 'Much', 'attention', 'paid', 'small', 'important', 'details', 'such', 'glowing', 'green', 'light', 'dock', 'faded', 'oculist', 'sign', 'splendor', 'Gatsby', 'mansion', 'recreated', 'exquisitely', 'valley', 'ashes', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'ghastly', 'wasteland.Second', 'Luhrmann', ""n't"", 'depart', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'discourse', 'Gatsby', 'Daisy', 'remember', 'reading', 'book', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'dialogue', 'stay', 'unflinchingly', 'true', 'spirit', 'book', 'morals', 'think', 'vastly', 'more', 'important.Third', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'probably', 'most', 'telling', 'detail', 'Luhrmann', 'good', 'judgment', 'making', 'film-', 'DeCaprio', 'embodiment', 'Gatsby', 'smile', 'charm', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'what', 'one', 'reading', 'book', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'pick', ""'outsider"", 'qualities', 'required', 'role', 'narrator', 'Debicki', 'Jordan', 'Baker', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well-cast', 'had', 'aloof', 'coolness', 'slightly-bored', 'gaze', 'pictured', 'when', 'read', 'novel', 'Daisy', 'far', 'was', 'most', 'crucial', 'casting', 'opinion', 'played', 'too', 'obnoxiously', 'over-the-top', 'whole', 'story', 'flat', 'However', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'flighty', 'airy', 'also', 'show', 'real', 'emotion', 'way', 'character', 'horrible', 'things', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', ""n't"", 'completely', 'devoid', 'thought/emotion', 'course', 'husband', 'Tom', 'antagonist', 'macho-man', 'emotions', 'occasionally', 'seep', 'surface.Honestly', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'had', 'going', 'anachronistic', 'music', 'surprisingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one', 'bit', 'was', 'also', 'clever', 'how', 'jazz', 'motifs', 'were', 'mixed', 'hip-hop', 'rap', 'beats', 'somehow', 'making', 'sound', 'swirl', 'unidentifiable', 'chaotic', 'experience.Overall', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'adaptation', 'definitely', 'must', 'Gatsby', 'fan']",The Great Gatsby 2013

If you are not familiar with the story, it is basically a love story, with sinister dealings and deceit interwoven.  There is also the concept of how the filthy rich just play with people,to achieve their own desires, without even a second thought.  It is also a sad story, in that respect, as you will see when you watch it.The movie begins at Perkins Sanitarium, where Nick Carraway is talking to his doctor about Gatsby (DiCaprio) as he watches the fluffy white snow twirl in the air.  The doctor suggests that Nick (Toby McQuire) write about Gatsby, to get it out and make himself feel better.  Nick is obviously distraught about losing his friend, and some other realizations he has had.Flash back to the summer of 1922.  The stock market is soaring up and liquor is flowing. Nick rents a small house on Long Island in the middle of the filthy rich, where he can have a peaceful vacation.

The first hour of this film made me want to scratch my eyes out, it makes no sense, has no consistency, is historically inaccurate to the point of bringing tears my eyes and is just abolutely retardedly ridiculous.  Poorly made is an understatement, this film will stand for all time as a testament to the fact that a big budget, big stars and outrageous CG effects do not mean the movie is good.Other than the fact that the first half of the movie (unlike the book) made absolutely no sense, seemed to completely lack any purpose and was nearly sickening in it's constant camera-angle changing motion spinning toward making as much noise and pretty colors as possible without advancing any kind of plot... it was freaking BORING and completely uninteresting.  The only reason I even made it through more than 30 minutes of this tripe is because my wife refuses to not watch a movie she's paid for, no matter how awful.Now, at about half-way through the film, after this absolutely ridiculous excuse for a ""party"" at Gatsby's (see below), the film slowly becomes tolerable.  As if they suddenly changed directors the film starts to turn away form flashy, noisy ""look at how cool looking my new movie is"" (which it isn't) toward an actual character and circumstance driven story.  Too late though, because by the time it really gets interesting it's pretty much over, and to be honest I was more than ready for it to be.Why it sucks more than anything else:  Historical piece, base upon classic literature, with absolutely NO historical accuracy or base of reference.

However, the party scenes at Gatsby's house were especially well-done, and the viewer could really experience the hedonism going on there! (It's probably worth watching the movie just for those scenes). Leonardo does a very nice job as Jay Gatsby, and I felt he was faithful to the character portrayed in the novel by Fitzgerald. Carrie Mulligan did a stellar job as well with the pivotal character of Daisy. Yet, one of the aspects of the film that annoyed me the most was the music.

1512619,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0067EKYS6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[0, 0]","No one can ever accuse Australian auteur Baz Luhrmann of playing it safe! Subtlety and restraint are not qualities that the director embraces. In fact, his motto appears to be ""the bigger, the better."" His previous pictures (both good and bad) are chaotic, frantic, excessive and over-the-top in every way imaginable. I don't necessarily mean that as an insult. I enjoyed both ""Strictly Ballroom"" (a lot) and the anachronistic ""Romeo + Juliet."" But it was ""Moulin Rouge"" that really stole my heart. I appreciate this musical mash-up so much because it simply shouldn't work. It's too much, everything about it. Yet for all its ADD attitude, it's a dazzlingly original piece of work with real heart and passion. It was my favorite film of 2001, while his follow-up ""Australia"" was my biggest disappointment of 2008. Expectations were high when Luhrmann announced a re-imagining of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby."" The prior film interpretation, with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, was a lavish production that never fully connected with me on an emotional level. It was faithful enough, to be sure, it just lacked a bit of life.Well LIFE (with a capital LIFE) is something that Luhrmann's version doesn't lack. For literary purists, this spectacle may not resemble Fitzgerald's classic in anything but basic plotting. In many ways, this is NOT Fitzgerald's ""Gatsby."" Instead, this is unquestionably Luhrmann's creation. And for that, you will likely love the movie or hate it. While I didn't think it was a perfect film, I ended up embracing it and loving it. If nothing else, it is not like any other project you'll see in movie theaters in 2013. In this day of homogenized sequels and cookie cutter copies, this experience explodes from the screen as a true original. The use of fantastic 3-D filming, the opulence in set and costume design, the visual trickery of the special effects, the massive cast (the party scenes alone seem populated by thousands) and the effectively anachronistic soundtrack all create a distinctly unique impression. The sheer magnitude of the production is almost overwhelming! To keep up with it all, you might just feel exhausted after watching ""The Great Gatsby.""The story, as I mentioned, stays largely intact from the source material. Recounted from the modest perspective of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), an unlikely tale of friendship, mystery and tragic love unfolds at a frantic pace. While it is dizzying to begin with, just settle in and things calm down as the movie progresses. This is a common element to Luhrmann endeavors, it takes a while for the manic energy to subside. Taking a small cabin next to the palatial Gatsby estate, Carraway has a strong curiosity about the enigmatic Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). When he gets a personal invitation to a gala, it seems that the great man reciprocates this interest with his new neighbor. Carraway is seduced into a new world of luxury and excess. His wealthy cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) lives across the bay with her volatile husband (Joel Edgerton) and Gatsby seems especially fascinated by her as well. Is he just using Nick to connect with Daisy? What exactly does he want?As much as anything, this iteration of ""The Great Gatsby"" plays up the mystery elements of the story. The secrets of the past are slow to surface, but they are powerful and vivid when they do. When played for drama and even tragedy, the movie does strike an strong emotional chord. The tone, however, throughout is somewhat scatttershot. An early meeting between Gatsby and Daisy, for example, is played as awkward comedy and feels decidedly less than real. But I still loved the movie. DiCaprio is especially strong as Gatsby. Maguire is also good, if a little old to be so wide-eyed and innocent. But for me, the star of the production is the production itself. Absolutely spellbinding from a visual perspective, I won't soon forget this ""Gatsby!"" I'd recommend the 3-D version as this was intended to be seen in that format (it wasn't converted after the fact to cash in like most other movies). Maybe not for everyone, Luhrmann took a classic American novel and developed one of 2013's most unique films.

This is how the story goes: Would-be writer Nick Carraway leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy, and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without of the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles.The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (great as Jay Gatsby), Tobey Maguire (as Nick Carraway), Carey Mulligan (as Daisy Buchanan), Joel Edgerton (as Tom Buchanan), Isla Fisher (as Myrtle Wilson) & Jason Clarke (as George Wilson) is great. The directing by Baz Luhrmann (who also produced and co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The screenplay (based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald) by Luhrmann & Craig Pearce is great.The music by Craig Armstrong is great. The cinematography by Simon Duggan is great. The film editing by Jason Ballantine, Jonathan Redmond & Matt Villa is great. The casting by Ronna Kress & Nikki Barrett is great. The production & costume design by Catherine Martin (who also produced) is great. The art direction by Damien Drew, Ian Gracie & Michael Turner is great. The set decoration by Beverley Dunn, set dressings by Ciaran Jordan & Sam Lukins is great. The special effects supervised by Dan Oliver & coordinated by Jasmin Lyford is great. The visual effects supervised by Mark Breakspear, Andy Brown, Tony Cole, Jon Cowley, Lindy DeQuattro, Julian Dimsey, Chris Godfrey & Lesley Robson-Foster, coordinated by Ann-Marie Blommaert, Michelle Cornwall, Zachary Mallett, Barry St. John, Katrina Taylor & Pip Wright is great. The stunts coordinated by Glenn Ruehland & Ashley Fairfield is great.This is a great, well-crafted, well-made and great-looking film that is entertaining and well-done. This is a great film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another great performance as Jay Gatsby, a character that is well-suited for him. Baz Luhrmann directs another great film that is an interesting pick of a movie to do. This was a long awaited and anticipated reunion of DiCaprio and Luhrmann, working together after nearly 17 years since ""Romeo & Juliet"". This is also an interesting and long-awaited / anticipated pairing of close childhood friends DiCaprio & Maguire. This is one of the best-looking films of the year and of the summer season, thus far.

Sometimes things are best left alone.  Director Baz Luhrmann unwisely plays up a romantic angle.  This miscalculation dooms what could have been a stylish update of a popular book.  What's the real story?  Gatsby is a man who believes that he can buy the American Dream (and pretty much anything else he desires).  Instead of this picture taking the time to get know its central figure and depict his inevitable fall, the script puts a `Romeo and Juliet'-type spin on his story.  This misses the whole point of the novel.  Also, Daisy isn't supposed to be a likable character, but this fact didn't stop the producers from trying to make her so.  What all this boils down to is one should never adapt a story if they intend to dramatically change the characters motivations.

It seems no penny was spared to bring an ""over the top"" non stop fiesta to life.  All bit actors did splendidly.Tobey Maguire did a wonderful job too. I felt he was almost as good in this as he was in ""Cider House Rules"".His character was not as fully developed by the screenwriter, but his acting was brilliant.Having seen this version, I now want to re-watch the older Gatsby film again.  I know that each will stand on its merits.  Each was created using the technology and talents of the artists and visionaries of their time.  (I often hate ""remakes"" but this is one that was worth doing.)  The message burns strongly  and the visual impact in certain ways has more power than even Avatar did with the 3-D effects.  That is because in Avatar everything is fantasy, whereas this is more true to life.I am not the kind of person who generally watches a movie again and again.  This will be an exception.I am really glad we purchased the 3-D version and can easily do that whenever we feel the need.One of the reasons people go to the movies is to escape their own lives.The Great Gatsby, and I mean THIS particular Leonardo DiCaprio version is that perfect getaway.Pass the Champagne!",5,"Once I surrendered to the 3-D Style and let it have its way with me, I loved it.",1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,2785,"['Background', 'Have', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'Saw', 'Redford', 'version', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'blur', 'beautiful', 'blur.At', 'first', 'found', '3D', 'effects', 'bit', 'contrived', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'so', '.but', 'finally', 'just', 'let', 'lush', 'evocative', 'imagery', 'draw', 'beautiful', 'wave', 'hot', 'Mexican', 'beach', 'began', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'holding', 'back', 'due', 'unusual', 'style.Perhaps', 'only', '3D', 'could', 'do', 'story', 'proud', 'suspect', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'would', 'love', 'version', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'director', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'pull', 'off', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', '3D', '.and', 'watch', 'Shakespeare', 'react', 'interpretation', 'Oops', 'found', 'out', 'director', 'did', 'do', 'version', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '3D', 'Somehow', 'doubt', 'suspect', ""'d"", 'say', 'Yummy', 'Truly', 'brilliant', 'delicious', 'decadent', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'Ever', 'saw', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'when', 'child', 'star', 'have', 'found', 'captivating.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'won', 'Oscar', 'am', 'totally', 'clueless', 'why', 'other', 'stars', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'vote', 'feel', 'simply', 'reeks', 'talent', '.The', 'fight', 'scene', 'hot', 'hotel', 'room', 'was', 'as', 'real', 'had', 'happened', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'Thundering', 'face', 'ripped', 'core', 'soul.I', 'thought', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'played', 'Daisy', 'was', 'good', 'do', 'prefer', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'better', 'earlier', 'version.Still', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'believable', 'role.Artistically', 'sets', 'costumes', 'cars', 'cityscapes', 'houses', 'were', 'spectacular', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'penny', 'was', 'spared', 'bring', 'top', 'non', 'stop', 'fiesta', 'life', 'bit', 'actors', 'did', 'splendidly.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'too', 'felt', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', '.His', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'screenwriter', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliant.Having', 'seen', 'version', 'now', 'want', 're-watch', 'older', 'Gatsby', 'film', 'again', 'know', 'will', 'stand', 'merits', 'was', 'created', 'using', 'technology', 'talents', 'artists', 'visionaries', 'time', 'often', 'hate', 'remakes', 'one', 'was', 'worth', 'doing', 'message', 'strongly', 'visual', 'impact', 'certain', 'ways', 'more', 'power', 'even', 'Avatar', 'did', '3-D', 'effects', 'because', 'Avatar', 'everything', 'fantasy', 'more', 'true', 'life.I', 'am', 'not', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'generally', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'exception.I', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'purchased', '3-D', 'version', 'can', 'easily', 'do', 'whenever', 'feel', 'need.One', 'reasons', 'people', 'go', 'movies', 'escape', 'own', 'lives.The', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'mean', 'THIS', 'particular', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'version', 'perfect', 'getaway.Pass', 'Champagne']",The Great Gatsby 2013

Scott Fitzgerald's world of money, parties and power in a new screen adaption of his classic novel. The screenplay was written and adapted by Baz himself and long time writing partner Craig Pierce (Strictly Ballroom, Moulin Rouge!), but the flow and ebb of this film lacks the romance and majesty of the original novel. This film is beautiful to look at because of the wonderful cinematography by Simon Duggan (I, Robot, The Mummy 3) and has an enchanting score by Craig Armstrong (Kiss of the Dragon, Love Actually), that is when you are not listening to hip-hop, but it just rides a slow wave of visual after visual after visual. Not substance. No meat. And, a very small heart.On the upside, Leonardo DiCaprio (Inception, Titanic) does an amazing job at playing Gatsby. He's got the swagger, the look and the innate ability to capture your attention on the big screen.  His looks and eyes celebrate all that is his characters money, power and parties all held at his lavishly decked out home along the shore. Leonardo knows how to create a character and live it well.Equally as intriguing and taking the audience point of view is Tobey McGuire (Spider-Man, Pleasantville) playing Nick Carraway, Gatsby's new neighbor and writer of the tale that unfolds. Tobey and Leonardo have some good on screen chemistry together as well. Tobey makes an honest effort to make us as an audience believe in the wonder that is Gatsby.As with all films, there are many plot complications that specifically revolve around Carey Mulligan (Drive, Pride & Prejudice) as Daisy Buchanan, the girl who lives big and dreams even bigger. Joel Edgerton (King Arthur, The Thing-2011) is Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband who also has a thing or two going on, on the side himself. The chemistry and passion of these four actors is palatable when they are together, however the rest of the film falls short of the mystery and magic that was always ""The Great Gatsby"".Long drawn out shots, beautifully executed and visually stunning, but too long and in some cases too pointless. It was also obviously shot for the 3D cinema because it's apparent certain camera angles, movement and positioning were designed to poke at you as you watch the film. It just didn't work, even for the 3D.A modern touch for this new generation was the added hip-hop, modernized style of pop culture music added to the soundtrack. It just didn't feel right. It didn't compliment the images, in fact, it was annoyingly noticeable. Oh well, a good set of strings and horns would have done the film much better.Overall it cannot hold a candle to the original film in terms of character development, action, glamour and pizazz, and except for the strong performances of the four I mentioned, this film reminds me of a cable TV movie rather than a big screen epic as the original text and film were.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[8, 13]","Previously Baz Luhrmann directed a version of Romeo and Juliet also starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and the visually spectacular Moulin Rouge. The Great Gatsby opened to a much higher than expected $51 million weekend.I was highly impressed with Baz Luhrman's direction. We don't see Gatsby for a while. We know him by how others react to him before we meet him, and DiCaprio does an amazing job of bestowing his own charisma on the character to create a certain aura of mystery. We get the sense that Gatsby is not quite on the level, yet he is a caring and considerate neighbor almost to a fault, old sport.Nick Carroway the narrator, and everyone's confidante, puts us firmly in the passenger seat to this adventure and lives next door to Gatsby's huge mansion where he throws lavish parties. Nobody knows how or where he got his money. As the movie progresses we learn why. Seemingly inconsequential events lead to unpredictable places.Essentially, it's a story about lavishly wealthy people, who sometimes lead careless, amoral and irresponsible lives.In the hands of Luhrmann for me at least this is a visually masterful movie, with some amazing shots. We have people dancing and swigging champagne in an open top car on the bridge into the city, and then the camera magically zooms away as the film speeds up. Was this shot from a helicopter flying at bridge level? There is a certain magical flow about how the movie unfolds visually, and moves between different visual images. I particularly liked how Gatsby in the flower scene imposes his greater reality on his neighbor's humble house, and how the woods add almost a surreal fairy tale element.It's almost as if Gatsby is godlike and creates the universe that surrounds him. Everything except free will. Gatsby has a moment of friction with Daisy, and at his party a glass breaks.Gatsby's place is like a Disneyland for adults. Set in the 1920s the movie boasts a fusion of musical sounds introducing a textured range of styles all the way to the current era, including some jazz and hiphop. I particularly loved a piece played on a giant Wurlitzer, and the scope of the movie is huge.We have beautiful cars including a yellow Duesenberg, plush almost ridiculously ostentatious Long Island mansions, impeccable costumes, and a wild unrestrained feeling. We have the rich and poor hobnobbing. We have parties. I sensed rather than knew this was a Luhrmann movie because it was somewhat visually reminiscent of the style of Moulin Rouge. This was not a bad thing. In fact, I wished that the musical aspect was played up at times, with more music or seeing a theater or performance of some kind within the scenes rather the performance being a backdrop to what was happening onscreen.And the character of Gatsby reveals first through a legend, based on image and respectability and being accepted by other rich people. Then we have the real story which for me was more impressive, and really encompasses the American dream. Perhaps that is why the story is so popular.Gatsby is special, and destined for greatness. He always knew this, and when he meets a certain someone it motivates him to achieve that greatness. But he did not seek this greatness only for himself. If there is shadiness involved, there is also a certain purity of heart, which sometimes skirts the edges of narcissism, and personal hubris. For nothing will dissuade him from his true purpose, and he wants an equally unbridled love in return. Does that sound unreasonable?I loved this movie. It's a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood formula. Usually one has to wait to year end for this type of quality entertainment so it's great to see such a movie in summer.After watching this I viewed the 1974 Gatsby starring Robert Redford, Mia Farrow, Sam Waterson and Lois Chiles.The screenplay was written by Francis Ford Coppola. I found myself wishing that Coppola also directed that movie as it was somewhat slow in pacing, and the outstanding cinematography, a hallmark of Coppola's movies would have given it added visual splendor. I certainly recommend it for a viewing if only to compare and contrast. I loved some of the music and party scenes.It's clear that Luhrmann did use the 1974 movie as a template yet elevates this story and delivers a version that is superior in almost every respect, and the visuals especially were a feast for the senses. Some of the story elements are far clearer especially the denouement. Most importantly even though Gatsby was not perfect, Gatsby was great. And I feel privileged to have watched it. Apparently it got mixed reviews from critics. I say never mind the critics. Check it out for yourself.It looks better than the real twenties. I think most people will enjoy it and I hope this was helpful.",5,Rich people are like us.

1512659,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B0067EKYS6,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[60, 85]","CGI is becoming the ruin of serious films. Its over-use is leading to films that ever more cartoonish with overblown designs, garish colors and visuals that are notable for their utter excess. This film, in my opinion, takes things to a whole new level of ugly. Its a visually loud film with no real sense of style to speak of. Like most CGI, its so poorly done that it screams obvious fake at least to me. The film has all the visual style of Joel Schumaker's 1997 ""Batman and Robin"" and that is not a complement. Some have complained about the music not being appropriate. I'm not sure about that. If anything, they didn't go far enough with the music. Only a disco soundtrack straight out of the 1970s would have been appropriate.Worse yet is the script which isn't very respectful of the novel. They invented a new framing sequence which was completely unnecessary. They seemed desperate to make Daisy Buchanan a good and likeable character which she should not be. What I liked the least was the removal of Gatsby's father from the story. The father showing up to the funeral is, in my opinion, one of the great moments in the entire book.Many of the other key moments in the story are simply overwhelmed by the visuals and noise. The meeting in the city with Meyer Wolfshiem falls flat as a scene because there is so much ""junk"" going on for the sake of going on in the background. They keep going back to a trumpet player on a fire escape for no particular reason.As far as casting, Leonardo DiCaprio works out as the main character far better than I would have expected. He captures the essense of being a fake very well. Joel Edgerton doesn't work as Tom Buchanan at all. They needed someone who could do a credible WASPy rich hypocrite and that is just not him. Elizabeth Debicki is good, but her character is not given much of anything to do. Amitabh Bachchan was a misfire in that someone seems to have told him to play the part as a vampire. The faults of ""Daisy"" are faults in the construction of the script. Tobey Maguire does a reasonable job, but nothing special.In some sense, many of the flaws of the film are really simply expressions of Baz Luhrmann's style. But where Moulin Rouge seemed in step with excess of the times when it was released, Gatsby seems completely out of touch.In terms of the music, Luhrmann's comments sort of speak for themselves:""The question for me in approaching Gatsby was how to elicit from our audience the same level of excitement and pop cultural immediacy toward the world that Fitzgerald did for his audience? And in our age, the energy of jazz is caught in the energy of hip-hop.""The problem of course is that where they went for that excitement, energy and pop cultural immediacy to a couple people who no longer have ANY of those things: Jay Z and Beyonce. They found ""pop culture immediacy"" in established acts like Fergie, U2, Bryan Ferry and Amy Winehouse among others. The idea of using high-energy modern music was not a bad one, but they didn't carry it through. They went for celebrity names and a style of music that was low energy.People who like the overblown style of Baz Luhrmann and who are not very familar with the novel might enjoy this.

1512673,A3KO4IGP2ALW63,B0067EKYS6,Mea,"[4, 7]","First, I'd like to say that I do like this film, and have seen it several times. It's very entertaining, and certainly colorful, with fine performances and wonderful sets, but it just isn't a great film, and I can't give it more than three stars. I'm not sure this version of ""Gatsby"" would be recognized by its original creator. After the first 15 minutes or so I began to wonder if Fitzgerald's story had been rewritten by a graphic-novelist. The film seems cartoonish, somehow, and I couldn't quite believe in Gatsby or Daisy; they just seem too round-faced and, (despite DiCaprio's wrinkles), young.Who on earth would ever imagine Gatsby as DiCaprio? There's absolutely nothing mysterious about him. His performance was identical to all of his performances; I don't think he's capable of being anyone but Leo. His accent is bizarre, definitely not Midwestern, or New York, or Oxford. Exactly what was he shooting for? Carey Mulligan may be cute, but it's very hard for me to picture anyone, even DiCaprio, investing so much effort towards winning her heart. They both look about 15 years old, they'll probably still look like teenagers when they're 60. And what's up with casting Spiderman as Gatsby's minion? Unfair, I admit, McQuire's a decent actor, but the Spidey image is not easily shed.As for the soundtrack, there are so many problems with it that I don't even know where to start, but the first thing that comes to mind is the Rap music. Others may disagree, but when I watch a movie set in the 1920s, with costumes that are vaguely reminiscent of the era, and the word ""jazz"" is flung around from time to time, I don't want to hear anything that sounds like Rap.  There's virtually no jazz, although there are some songs that sound like they might be popular music from that era; lyrical songs, of course. All those lyrics are very distracting. Songs with lyrics are used to accompany strongly emotional scenes, something that's generally not done in movies aimed at an adult audience. The soundtrack doesn't support the story, instead, it seems to be jumping up and down screaming for attention.Come to think of it, each element of the film, the music, the costumes, the sets, the clever dialogue, tries too hard to be noticed.

1512676,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B0067EKYS6,Michael A. Newman,"[1, 2]","Note: my review is of the regular version of the film as I did not see it in 3D.  I have had to read The Great Gatsby in both high school and college so it was a story that was burned into my subconcious.  Additionally, I had seen the original with Robert Redford and Kathryn Lee Scott (those are the two actors I remember) when it first came out.  This film is far superior to the original as it is a lot more fun.  The director did take a lot of liberties with the film having some modern songs put in but the director did an amazing job where you can feel the energy of Gatsby's parties and the visual effects just seemed to transport the viewer back to the 1920's.This version of the film does follow the book story very closely, in fact, Toby McGuire as Nick narrates a lot of the film, quoting directly from the book.  DeCaprio is excellent as Gatsby however, my only beef with him is that he looks a little bit too young (remembering Redford in the original appearing to be a little bit more mature looking) to have served in the military and then waited the five years building up a fortune and hoping to woo Daisy from her husband.The shots of New York City are stunning, even better than what I remembered from King Kong.  The one thing that the director kept showing and I wasn't sure of were some guys working with shovels in what I am assuming is Queens.  Queens is depicted as just a bunch of junkyards and also serves as the stopoff point where Daisy's husband goes for gas and to meet his mistress.  It is not clear how he gets away with seeing her without her husband knowing though.Nick narrates the story while he seems to be treated in a sanitarium.  Even watching the movie it is not clear why he eventually ends up there.  Don't remember if this was specifically explained in the book.  Nick seems to be the ""nice"" guy that everybody likes and he acts as the go-between between everybody especially between his cousing Daisy and Gatsby.I am not a big fan of 3D but I would like to see this film again in 3D just for the excellent visual effects.",4,Excellent Adaptation of Fitzgerald's Classic!,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2067,"['Note', 'review', 'regular', 'version', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', '3D', 'have', 'had', 'read', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'burned', 'subconcious', 'Additionally', 'had', 'seen', 'original', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Kathryn', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'are', 'two', 'actors', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'original', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'director', 'did', 'take', 'lot', 'liberties', 'film', 'having', 'modern', 'songs', 'put', 'director', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'where', 'can', 'feel', 'energy', 'Gatsby', 'parties', 'visual', 'effects', 'just', 'seemed', 'transport', 'viewer', 'back', ""1920's.This"", 'version', 'film', 'follow', 'book', 'story', 'very', 'closely', 'fact', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'Nick', 'lot', 'film', 'quoting', 'directly', 'book', 'DeCaprio', 'excellent', 'Gatsby', 'however', 'only', 'beef', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'young', 'remembering', 'Redford', 'original', 'appearing', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'mature', 'looking', 'have', 'served', 'military', 'then', 'waited', 'five', 'years', 'building', 'up', 'fortune', 'hoping', 'woo', 'Daisy', 'husband.The', 'shots', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'stunning', 'even', 'better', 'what', 'remembered', 'King', 'Kong', 'one', 'thing', 'director', 'kept', 'showing', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'were', 'guys', 'working', 'shovels', 'what', 'am', 'assuming', 'Queens', 'Queens', 'depicted', 'just', 'bunch', 'junkyards', 'also', 'stopoff', 'point', 'where', 'Daisy', 'husband', 'gas', 'meet', 'mistress', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'away', 'seeing', 'husband', 'knowing', 'though.Nick', 'narrates', 'story', 'be', 'treated', 'sanitarium', 'Even', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'eventually', 'up', 'there', 'Do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'specifically', 'explained', 'book', 'Nick', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'everybody', 'likes', 'go-between', 'everybody', 'especially', 'cousing', 'Daisy', 'Gatsby.I', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', '3D', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'again', '3D', 'just', 'excellent', 'visual', 'effects']",The Great Gatsby 2013

On the one hand we have an original Baz Luhrmann creation.  It has all the flim and flam of his earlier works and my feeling is it worked much better in those.  It fitted brilliantly into the seedy theatre of Moulin Rogue and added fresh stye to the substance of the Bard in Romeo and Juliet but here it left me cold.  It was a forced and obvious intrusion.  It was a pink sequined jacket on a penguin.  So isn't that a disaster?  Doesn't that ruin the whole production?In a word?  No.  You see, it's all rather bullet proof.  The human drama between the four main players, the strong, clever and earnest performances from its cast, the wonderful language of Fitzgerald, the message, are all there, all intact and no amount of fizz and razzle dazzle can undo the good work.  There may be attempts to batter the driving heart of the production but they all bounce harmlessly away.I didn't care that the music was incongruous or I could pick out certain visual licks from Luhrmann's earlier work.  I didn't care that there were small changes from the book or that it was told in flashback.  It's not the over-stuffed party that holds your attention, it's the quiet man passing through it.  Luhrmann made a brilliant call; he filled his movie with people who understood their characters and the story better than he did and, in that, he orchestrated a triumph.  I loved the book when I was first 'subjected' to it in highschool English class.  I loved Fitzgerald's way with words and I loved Nick and Jay and it's all here.  Everything I loved about the book is here so what do I care if there are clumsy highlighter marks and notes in the margins?

It felt exactly like ""Moulin Rouge"" except with a different storyline squished between the scenes of Nick Carraway writing/telling the story.The movie was narrated by Nick Carraway, just as the novel was told in his perspective, however, in this movie version, Nick has gone mad and is using the experience of writing the story as a means of dealing with his internal struggles.  If you have seenMoulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), this premise will sound familiar, because it is exactly the same.In fact, the entire movie felt exactly the same as Moulin Rouge. The style was exactly the same which leads me to believe Baz is a One Trick Pony.  I felt that sort of style worked for a story like Moulin Rouge, but it didn't work as well in this version of The Great Gatsby.  There were even points where I felt Baz tried making this story comical and goofy.  It isn't a funny story, nor should it be.I didn't like how this movie spoonfed information to the audience.  There is no tension, no nothing.  For example, in this movie, Gatsby tells Nick towards the end that he really didn't come from money, that actually his parents were poor.  If I remember correctly, Nick actually doesn't know that until after Gatsby died and Gatsby's father comes to the mansion and is the lone guest at the funeral.I also didn't like that this movie seemed to try really hard to make Daisy a likable character.  Daisy shouldn't be a likable character.  She's a snooty-patoony rich girl who cares nothing about anyone other than herself and the things that she has.Furthermore, they made Nick's character weak by turning him into a drunk/crazy person in the loony bin.

1512688,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0067EKYS6,M. Oleson,"[10, 14]","For what I believe is the 6th attempt to put F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby on the screen, director Baz Luhrmann's adaption brings the novel to life in a novel way. Many will love the razz pizzazz of Baz-Jazz and hate the 1920's soap opera-like scenes. Others will appreciate the reverent tone of Fitzgerald's novel, especially the words narrated by the writer's surrogate, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and hate the loud, gaudy yet contemporary party scenes. For me the film is balanced pretty well.Jay Gatsby (terrific Leonardo DiCaprio) is a self-made millionaire, living in semi-seclusion in a huge mansion directly across the bay from Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) in New York's Long Island. While Gatsby is most often alone, he deals with his mysterious businesses by phone. He also throws elaborate parties almost every night. Hundreds of guests come in all their colorful finery and party all night long with bootlegged booze endlessly on tap. Gatsby's next door neighbor is Nick who is renting an old caretaker's cottage. Nick is also a cousin to Daisy.After Nick and Gatsby become acquainted, a meeting is set-up between Gatsby and an unsuspecting Daisy. Five years earlier Gatsby, then an officer about to go to war, met Daisy at her parents Louisville home. They fell in love but the war kept them apart long enough for Daisy to marry Tom, the heir to an industrial fortune. As they say, old money. Tom, a brutish chauvinist is romancing Myrtle (Isla Fisher) on the side. Myrtle is the wife of George (Jason Clarke), the owner of a broken down gas station between Long Island and the city.In the big party scenes, Luhrmann reminds of his ""Moulin Rouge"" with many shots down from the ceiling, spinning cameras and twirling dancers. ""Gatsby"" has one of the best soundtracks of the year, coordinated by executive producer, Jay-Z. The filmmakers do a great job mixing some older music, mostly Gershwin classics, with modern rock and hip-hop. It all works.The film falls a bit short of perfection however. And by short I mean long. That is, the film runs nearly 2  hours. This might have been OK if it meant longer or more musical opportunities. Instead, the last act crawls along until the obvious conclusion. Unlike Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 underwhelming version, DiCaprio and Mulligan have a real connection giving their characters a believable portrayal of love lost, found and lost again. I suspect Fitzgerald would have liked this version.(BLU RAY UPDATE 12/30/13)I thought the movie seen for the first time was worthy of 4/5 stars, primarily for the production values.  I watched it again, this time on a Blu ray disc that comes in a couple different packages.  I've added 1/2 a star.  Before I get into the Blu ray qualities, allow a supplement to my original review.The film received mixed reviews at best, some scathing.  While I will admit to Lurhmann devotion to Fitzgerald's novel is shallow, I don't think he was trying to make a dramatic commentary of the illusion of the American Dream.  He was trying to entertain with big sets, big color, big music and an overall big production.  While not a musical in the traditional sense, Lurhmann and his music producers (Craig Armstrong and Shawn ""Jay Z"" Carter) manage to create a stew that portends the era with vintage and modern music beautifully mixed.  You will hear shadings of Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" throughout the film.  The movie opens with Jay Z's 100$ Bill and closes with Armstrong's ""The Green Light"" with properly layered modern songs in between.  The music adds a richness to the film, from intimate moments to the wild parties.Lurhmann does effectively maintain the love triangle created by Fitzgerald and incorporates his dialog, sometimes with the words floating above the screen (effective in 3D).  My favorites include Nick, after meeting Jordan (Daisy's pro golfer best friend), recollecting ""She frightened me but I enjoyed looking at her."" And Jordan telling Nick about how Daisy met Gatsby in Louisville, ""The way he looked at her was the way all girls want to be looked at.""I loved the art deco sets, The Jazz Age (Fitzgerald coined term) feel, the exotic clothes and the overall amplification of the time.As for the Blu ray version.  It is as exotic and spectacular as the film.  Properly transferred in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, it looks great.  In an over-the-top production like this the color must pop and it does.  The film is purposely bright and the lighting often provides overly sharp images, especially skin tones.  This should be expected.  The blacks are inky dark.  If you look closely at some of the scenes with night skies, you might see a speck or too but no big deal.  Overall I thought the video was sharp with excellent delineation.Likewise the audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Other than wishing it was 7.1, I have no complaints.  Again with the music a major contributor to the movie, it has to resonate.  And it does.  Surrounds are active most of the time, especially in the party sequences.  The subs will get a workout as the Duisenberg's big engine roars.  And some of the more lively songs produce plenty of thump.

It's very true to the book, and makes explicit certain things (like how Gatsby made his money) more explicit. The movie also added nice foreshadowing, like when Gatsby throws his empty champagne glass in the pool where he himself eventually dies. The casting is spectacular.

You will, almost certainly, be knocked out by its fantastic sets, its clever plot and its superb love story because as a stand-alone experience, free of any preconceptions, it's an exciting, gripping and deeply moving movie.For the less fortunate - those who have expectations of what a screen version of this novel should be - things are much more difficult. For, while this is fundamentally the same story that Fitzgerald wrote it's not what he wrote - key parts of it have been missed out, much of what's been kept in has been exaggerated, and quite a lot of it simply isn't in the book. It's not The Great Gatsby as you want or hoped it would be and much gnashing of teeth will almost certainly follow as you witness scene after scene being twisted or, worse still, added-in for dramatic effect.In rock music terms what it is is a big production ""cover version"" and, in the end, that's how it should be judged because it's quite clear right from the opening scenes - a sequence that isn't mentioned or referred to anywhere in the book - that Baz Luhrmann has no intention of producing a faithful interpretation of it. What he wants to do is to take Fitzgerald's quite brilliant story and use it as the basis for a fast & furious cinematic ""work-out"" - a huge spectacle, full of CGI graphics, vast sets, swathes of exciting, technically complex audio-visual virtuosity and, on the way, a great deal of genuine drama.It is in fact The Great Gatsby on steroids - a pumped-up and distorted version of the original - and the really annoying thing for aficionados of this 20th Century classic is that it works, at times quite brilliantly, because like all good cover versions the essence of the original has been retained and then extended out into something that's exhilaratingly different.

1512706,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B0067EKYS6,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[0, 1]","To date there have been a number of movie adaptations of Gatsby, the 1974 version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, being my favourite; so when I heard Gatsby was about to get the Baz Luhrmann treatment, I wasn't quite sure what to think. See, like the decidedly mixed reviews on this film, I share similar feelings about Luhrmann's movies in general. While I adored his modernised interpretation of Romeo + Juliet, I could barely make it through Moulin Rouge. Seeing Gatsby was a gamble for me because while there's no doublt Luhrmann has a monopoly on contemporary flare and visual excess, he also has a tendency to skim the surface, missing much of the underlying detail. So what was the end result?His Gatsby fell somewhere in between the two.It's hard to know where to start because my thoughts on this movie are all over the place. Though I did enjoy the theatrical experience in a visual sense, emotionally it was incredibly unfulfilling. Not exactly what you expect or want from an adaptation of one of the most hailed novels, like, ever. So yeah. But honestly, was I surprised by this? Not really. It ended up being exactly what I thought it might be: visually striking but lacking in depth and character. It all boils down to way too much focus placed on the aesthetic parts and not enough on the ""meat and potatoes"" of the film. Sure, there are brief sparks of something special, but overall, it lacked a lot of the heart and soul that comes from the original source material.Luhrmann's Gatsby is imposing, in-your-face and brash which works both for and against it. This forwardness has a tendency to highlight the obvious making it lack the subtlety that makes earlier versions of the movie so much more effective. For instance, you're beaten in the face with the symbolism of the green light so much so that it feels like you're being insulted. Look Baz, the green light is important, I know, but we're not all that dense, okay? There's something to be said for leaving an air of mystery, of which this movie did none of. However, that being said, I do think he excels in creating striking cinematography which keeps you riveted to the screen. He makes you not want to look away because his world stands out from all the rest. The opulence of this movie matches the excess of the Roaring 20's to near perfection and it sets the stage well while enhancing the mood. I also really liked Luhrmann's use of contemporary music when contrasted against the vintage-inspired glitz and glamour. I know this isn't something that will please everyone, but it worked for me. It's Luhrmann's trademark and he does it well.That being said, good visuals aren't enough to carry a movie. I think my biggest issue was the lack of personality. Don't get me wrong, the setting had plenty of it but where it mattered, it had little to none. There was very little natural chemistry between Leo DiCaprio's Gatsby and Carey Mulligan's Daisy. They were solid individually, but not when they were together. I mean, this is the key relationship in the movie and it didn't feel real. And if I'm being real here, I wasn't vibing on Leo's take of Gatsby at all. He was too disingenuous and self-serving for my liking. If you ask me, Robert Redford pretty much has the monopoly on the multi-faceted character. He was self conscious and refined in all the right places. Leo's angry, angsty Gatsby was fitting only in bits and pieces. What I did enjoy, though, was Mulligan's Daisy. She brings a stronger, more defiant side to Daisy's otherwise flighty, dainty damsel-in-distress act. It's a refreshing twist on the character, for sure.Another thing I noticed (and not in a good way) was how the story was told. More often than not, Nick Carraway's (Tobey Maguire) narrative was mistimed and misplaced, frequently jarring me out of the story. It made every second of the 2hr 23min running time seem that much longer. So that on top of the characters not feeling true to the characters in the book, it was hard to foster a connection to anyone of them --- and in a story that ends so tragically, you want to, no, need to be moved. I, on the other hand, couldn't care less. Baz Luhrmann's Gatsby, unfortunately, was a swing and a miss It's not that the movie is terrible, it's actually pretty enjoyable if you can take it at face value. It's got jazz in all the right places, if you know what I mean. I just happen to like prior versions better, that's all.And on a side note: I still think Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Romeo + Juliet was the pinnacle of his directing career so he's definitely got that going for him because that movie is AMAZING.Food for Thought: While Baz Luhrmann's signature flare worked in tandem with the rich excessiveness of the decade, his version of The Great Gatsby missed the mark in just about every other way. There were strong performances by each of the characters individually but when together, they lacked chemistry. I found caring more about the way the film looked than I did any of its characters which defeats the purpose of translating such a deep and meaningful story to the screen. This movie is all about face value in a world where there's so much more beneath the surface.",3,Luhrmann's signature flare misses the mark in Gatsby!,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,5208,"['date',

I have watched the trailer for the silent film, plowed through the Alan Ladd version and endured the made for television film. This is by far the best adaptation of the novel. While it does take a few liberties (Nick in a sanitarium...), it captures the spirit and beauty of the novel.

Having been brought up on video games, comic books and throwaway MP3s, they seem to be completely incapable of understanding the subtleties of art, literature, and music.  Hollywood's latest attempt at a film version of ""The Great Gatsby"" is sadly just another example.After about 30 minutes of Roaring 20s hype--scenes filled with loud period music absurdly mixed with modern hip-hop, exaggerated dance routines, bizarre costumes, comical art deco sets, and ridiculous computer graphics, all carried along on a tidal wave of alcohol--the movie finally settles down to the business of telling a story.If you make it through those opening scenes without being blinded, rendered deaf, or deeply insulted by the infantilism of the performance, you might extract some entertainment and enlightenment from the rest of the movie.  That probably depends on how familiar you are with F. Scott Fitzgerald's work, and how much you desire to see whether the movie succeeds in bringing his story to life on the screen.The acting is competent, but the characters are flat, especially the female characters.  Cinematically, the viewer gets the impression that the director has watched ""Citizen Kane"" too many times, and the screenwriter has aided and abetted this addiction by having Gatsby gasp ""Daisy"" in his dying moments, rather than whispering ""Rosebud.""_____________________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

How sad that things have not changed even in today's world.  We live for power climbing to the top of society and for what?  To be unhappy in a marriage of no true love, but a duty to their wealthy parents, and ancestors.  While the man cheats with other women, while is model wife does her duties to put on a show for the rest of society, as the perfect wife and mother.This is a must have movie to add to my collection of great movies.  I now will have all three by the end of this month and worth every penny each and everyone of them.Leonardo Dicaprio was and is a perfect Gatsby and as an actor is a young Orsen Wells, as actors go and beyond anyone's expectations he will accomplish much, as he is very careful what he chooses to act in, and does a superior job in each and everyone of the movies I have ever seen him in.  Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, also chooses his roles carefully and will go far, as he has in so many movies I have, also seen him in, was perfect for the rold of Nick Carraway the cousin of Daisy Buchanan played by Carey Mulligan was almost as good as Mia Farrow in the second movie of The Great Gatsby.Directed by Baz Luhrmann, Writing credits (WGA)Baz Luhrmann (screenplay) & Craig Pearce  (screenplay), with F.

Baz Luhrman makes a Graphic Novel out of a movie.  His energetic CGI infused style works in some cases but not in all. In my opinion, it didn't work for Gatsby.  The hot, hazy, at times, sultry summer was depicted as a sharp, clear constant party wherein the characters were lost.  Perhaps it's the clarity of CGI and High Def that turned me off.  But the casting didn't seem to fit as well.  I think Leonardo DiCaprio is a terrific actor and I love most of his films.  But this one...not so much.  He looked and sounded very uncomfortable when ending his sentences with the signature words ""old sport"".  I cringed with each utterance.  The words didn't seem natural for him.  I'm not a fan of Tobey Macguire and don't understand Hollywoods fascination with him.  I didn't even like him in Spiderman. But again, just my opinion.  The rest of the cast, as far as I'm concerned, were forgettable.  The 1974 Robert Redford film, while not the best of movies, was much better than this one.  Except for Bruce Dern, the cast fit easily into the 20's era. Finally, some movie remakes should not be made.

I'd been warned of the excesses of Luhrman so I wasn't shocked.  I was happy that Carey Mulligan at least looked good and I liked Tobey Maguire.  Mostly, it was the performance of DiCaprio that made it worth watching. I have to say that I think he's up there with Redford for charm.

Overall, I was unimpressed with this film version, and in certain moments, I was actually angry with it.  It seemed to me that the screenwriter felt superior to F. Scott Fitzgerald to the point that he felt he had to not only present the story but also explain it.  It felt very &#34;dumbed down&#34; to me.  Since I've read the book a good number of times, I could immediately recognize when a line of narration came directly from the book and when it was added material whose purpose was to manipulate the audience to see the story only in one particular way -- the way the screenwriter sees it.  I felt that the movie took us places that Fitzgerald never intended us to go, especially in its depiction of Nick Caraway as having been severely damaged from his acquaintance with Gatsby.  According to the movie, Nick is now a horrible, bitter alcoholic, in need of constant psychiatric therapy.  Seriously, if this were the case, how could Nick look back at his friend as the &#34;great&#34; Gatsby?Allow me to say one good thing about this movie.  It did have a beautiful look to it.  Visually, it depicted the world of Gatsby to be an airbrushed version of life.  I feel the &#34;look&#34; was consistent with the imagery of the book.Now, having said that, I didn't like the &#34;sound&#34; of the movie.  The Great Gatsby is the defining novel of &#34;The Jazz Age&#34;.  Why, then, was it necessary to supply the movie with music by the Black-Eyed-Peas?  Their music isn't bad, and I can see how it might have been &#34;inspired&#34; by jazz, but it just seemed out of sync with the story.  It was a distraction to me.I don't fault the actors at all.  Each was well-chosen for his or her respective role and skilled at the craft of acting.  I just despised the way the book's wording had been tampered with and that the director had a skewed interpretation of the original story.F. Scott Fitzgerald was a great writer.

1512747,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B0067EKYS6,Richard Masloski,"[9, 13]","It must be awfully tough, restrictive and artistically unsatisfying for actors nowadays to give performances when they spend most of their time in front of blue-screens and not in actual, real, tangible locations.  Maybe that is why none of the actors in this take on the classic novel seem convincing whatsoever. Every performance seems as unreal and phony as the CGI settings that surround it. Another terrible thing is the style over substance approach of this movie. For example, when Gatsby and Nick are driving into the city there is much important dialog being spoken - but it is all but lost to the winds as the ADHD-afflicted camera/computer dart about the car and the road, showing us every view and angle imaginable, yet in doing so scene-stealing the stuff of the only real things in this sequence - and that is the actors, whose words are subjugated to the style. And, sadly, this is par for the course for most all of the movie.The argument could be made that the world of Gatsby is, indeed, a superficial, phony, unreal world - and that this essential vapidness is what is being captured via the mind-deadening overuse of the movie-killing Monster that is CGI.  But this is a razor's edge.  In the case of this film, there are nicks and cuts galore that threaten the heart of the story, the reality of the romance below the glitz and glamor. Too many scenes are simply run over roughshod, the same way Wilson's wife gets the deadly bump from the yellow Rolls. And then there is the odious soap opera-ish musical underscore to the whole thing that tries too hard to make us feel what the visuals and dialog may fail to make us feel.  It creeps into every scene, further enhancing the phoniness of the entire affair. As to the use of hip hop, the question is why?  I understand the argument that contemporary music is used to make modern audiences feel more relevant to the moment of a period film, but then why not update fashions as well?  Cars, too?  Heck, why not just uproot the whole story and plant it in a 21st century setting?  The point is - where does it end?  And why NOT utilize the jazz music from the actual era being depicted?  The popular music then was a helluva lot better than the music of today! One reason for the choice in music may have been to be...controversial.  Controversy gets people talking - and in this world anymore there is nothing worse than not being talked about!When will money-mad movie makers and their too obliging, too accepting audiences reach a long overdue saturation point and realize that more often than not less is more - and that just because a thing can be technologically done doesn't therefore mean it should be.  When will a tree be a tree again?  A sky...a sky?  When will so many highly purchased actors truly act again - and not simply falsely react and become as unreal as the things around them that aren't really there?  When will movies be more than the grandiose computer games so many of them now are?

1512752,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0067EKYS6,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","I have not read the novel THE GREAT GATSBY, nor have I seen other film versions.  To be honest, the little I knew about it didn't grab my attention enough to seek it out.  But when the most recent version was released, I thought it was time to broaden my horizons just a little.  I'll admit, seeing a film version is not a good substitute for reading the original...but there you go.  I haven't read it.  After seeing the film, it's more likely that I might read it, because I felt a number of questions were left unanswered by the film.  (I'll bet the book does the same, but somehow, it's easier to fill in blanks for oneself with a book.)Anyway, I came into the film with few expectations about the plot.  Essentially, you've got a narrator (Tobey Maguire as Nick) who moves into a small house next to the glittering party palace that belongs to the legendary and little-known Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio).  Nick gets to know Gatsby a little bit, and the two become fairly constant companions.  Nick is enlisted to help achieve Jay's goal of winning back the heart of the girl he has loved for years, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan).  He was once romantically involved with her, but war and money separated them.  Now Jay has money and he wants to spend it on his love.  Unfortunately, she's married to the reprehensible Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and thus Daisy and Jay's road to togetherness does not run smooth.  Not at all.I don't know what all F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying to say about the times he lived in with his novel, but Baz Luhrmann's glitzy, noisy extravaganza seems to be commenting on wealth.  Yes, there's the idea that money can't buy happiness.  Or that we're destroying ourselves in a relentless pursuit of wealth.  I'd say the film also implies that we've become a society that has a self-imposed class system...where the ""poor boy"" can't get the ""rich girl"" unless he's got the money.  And in America, if one properly applies oneself, the poor boy can become rich enough for the girl to ""love"" him.  Yet love is now a possession, not a feeling.  Tom Buchanan doesn't really ""love"" Daisy in the romantic way we think of love...but he sure feels he owns her.  Jay may love Daisy, but he can only manifest this by showering her with ""stuff""...and Daisy seems delighted and moved by the material goods.This is a fairly long movie, which is normally just fine with me if the movie is good.  But these people are so unlikeable that I grew tired of spending time with them.  It's tough to root for Jay & Daisy when so much of their passion is materially motivated.  This is perhaps an accurate and even scathing commentary to make on the nature of love in a deeply materialistic world...but it certainly makes it hard to get behind our central couple.  And Luhrmann spends much of his film exposing the viewer to the most shimmering and over-the-top parties and wealth consumption...it's admirable from a design standpoint, but it becomes almost numbing.  (We saw it in 3D...this was not really needed for this film.  The 3D was well done, but it didn't enhance the story for me.)Luhrmann also made the choice to collaborate with modern artists on the music and songs.  This was, in my opinion, a mistake.  Many of the songs selected were true classics of the period.  They are quite lively and exciting on their own.  Yet when a clearly hip-hop or rock influenced number comes on, it's very jarring.  This isn't A KNIGHT'S TALE, where part of the conceit is having rock music in a medieval story.  Luhrmann wants to have things both ways:  a detailed period piece, but modern sensibilities.  It is distracting.  No doubt it helped album sales...but it ticked me off as a filmgoer.The best parts of the film are in the performances.  DiCaprio is pretty terrific as Jay, and while it's tough to actually LIKE this guy, DiCaprio fills his character with many shadings and secrets.  Gatsby is a bit of an enigma (and we don't know his entire story until late in the game), but DiCaprio makes him a compelling even charismatic presence.  Certainly the film demands a top-notch Gatsby, or there'd be no hope for it.  DiCaprio delivers once again, and makes the film worth seeing.  This is a 2.5 star film that I'm moving up to 3.5 stars just for this performance.  And I will further round it up to 4 stars (it's still 3.5 really but I can't pick that) because of Joel Edgerton.  His Tom Buchanan is a monster at times, but when he goes toe-to-toe with DiCaprio, he actually manages to win grudging respect from the audience.  He sees right through their romance and calls it for what it is.Carey Mulligan is a charming actress, but Daisy isn't a very fleshed out character.  In this case, I'd say the script betrays her a bit.  I still like her a lot, but THE GREAT GATSBY does nothing to move her down the road to real stardom.  And the role of Nick is problematic.  He's our narrator and guide, and unlike others, I didn't mind the idea of literally having some narration to help set the stage.  But Maguire gives a wan performance.  He's got a hang-dog look already, but he accompanies his appearance of being a milquetoast with a performance to match.  Nick is a fairly passive character, the man on the sidelines observing it all.  Yet he's onscreen so much that we need him to be more dynamic.  Maguire was simply a poor casting choice from the start.All-in-all, I'm glad I saw the film.  It has some moments of great visual spark.  It's an interesting story, and features a couple of top-notch performances.  But it is a bit too in love with itself, and Luhrmann's tendencies towards excess (I truly did not like MOULIN ROUGE) allows the film to run long enough that we become actively annoyed at these unlikeable characters.  It's unlikely I would ever see it again...but I do recommend that teen & adult audiences at least give it a look see (sans 3D).",4,"3.5 stars, rounded to 4, because despite faults, DiCaprio is

1512763,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0067EKYS6,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Attempting to adapt a literary classic like F. Scott Fitzgerald's &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; to the screen is always a tricky proposition. Just ask the makers of the 1974 version who got their rear ends handed to them for their efforts - by both critics and audiences alike. The risk, of course, is that devotees of the work will balk at any attempt to expand or modernize it beyond what is contained on the printed page. After all, great works of literature exist primarily in the individual's imagination, and the way one reader envisions a particular scene or character is likely NOT how another reader - or filmmaker - sees them. The result is that literary adaptations all too often turn into stuffy affairs, with movie makers taking the safest possible approach to the material in an attempt not to offend anyone while still trying to make the piece work in an entirely different medium.All of this is prelude to saying that when it comes to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of &#34;The Great Gatsby,&#34; regardless of how one feels about the final product, one has to at least admire the chutzpah of the effort. (His trumped-up modernized version of &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; similarly divided audiences in the 1990s).A high school English class staple if ever there was one, the highly prescient &#34;Gatsby,&#34; published in 1925, is often considered to be THE archetypal novel of the Roaring '20s, focused on the party-like decadence, conspicuous consumption and spiritual emptiness of a decade sandwiched between a Great War on one end and a Great Depression on the other. At the center of the piece stands Jay Gatsby himself, the self-made millionaire who achieves the American Dream through a combination of dreamy-eyed determination and corrupt opportunism (with much of his wealth gleaned through bootlegging and gangsterism). Yet, for all the wealth and material possessions he's managed to accrue for himself, Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio) can never find true happiness until he re-connects with the girl of his dreams, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), an alluring Southern-belle he fell in love with while still a penniless officer in the army. In the five years since their last encounter, Daisy, who is willing to go a certain distance with a fantasy romance until the going gets too tough for her, has gone on to marry the brutish womanizer Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby, in that same period, has bought a mansion across the bay from Daisy's house, hoping against hope that she will one day wander into one of his parties and that they will be able to rekindle their love as if nothing had happened in the interim. It is to this end that he befriends his next door neighbor, Nick Carraway Tobey Maguire), a nave bondsman from the Midwest, who's moved to New York to make his fortune on Wall Street and who also happens to be Daisy's cousin. It is Nick who narrates the tale (in this version from a sanitarium after suffering a mental breakdown from the trauma of the events he's witnessed), claiming to be an objective observer of what's going on around him, but in reality casting moral judgments on the people he encounters all along the way.It's easy to understand why the filmmaker was drawn to the material in the first place. With its wild parties and overall air of carefree abandon, the era practically screams out for the Baz Luhrmann treatment. But does the novel? I'm not so sure. The problem is that &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is about so much more than just unrestrained partying, and the director (along with his co-writer Craig Rearce) often seems oblivious to that fact. Luhrmann typically drenches his film in all sorts of visual razzmatazz, but the result is that the movie is so over-stylized that the characters are all too often reduced to caricatures and the whole thing to the level of a cartoon. The parties themselves become out-of-control orgies as seen through the lens of Simon Duggan's hurdy-gurdy, hyper-kinetic camera. Meanwhile most of Fitzgerald's nuance and subtlety are wiped away in the phantasmagoria. A case in point is the first appearance of Gatsby in the story. In the novel he literally sneaks up on Nick - and us - as just another anonymous and inconspicuous party guest who engages Nick in conversation. In the movie, his entrance is greeted with a literal display of pyrotechnics. The stylization extends to the d&eacute;cor as well, which often reflects &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; more than 1920s Long Island. Nick looks like he lives in an enchanted forest attached to Gatsby's mansion, which has more turrets than Blahousie Castle and manicured grounds that would put the Palace of Versaille to shame.Viewed another way, however, Luhrmann's approach seems to make a certain amount of sense. The grandiose, over-the-top theatricality, and stiff, yet, at the same time, over-emotive acting are aptly reflective of the silent movies of that era. It's hard to actually evaluate the performances since the actors have clearly been instructed to ham it up as much as possible (especially Edgerton). At times, they come across as little kids engaged in dress-up and playacting. But in the context of this particular film, is that necessarily a bad thing? (I will say that Robert Redford cut a more impressive figure as Gatsby than Di Caprio does here).And there's one other thing that can be added to the movie's win column: its overall manic energy, which seems a direct attempt to avoid at all costs replicating the mistakes of the heavy, inert 1974 version.Luhrmann knows that he is treading on sacred ground here and he clearly doesn't care. He's going to give us &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; as HE envisions it and to hell with the rest of us. In this age of artistic timidity and over-cautious commercial calculation, that attitude turns out to be both admirable and refreshing when you come to think of it.",3,A Decidedly Mixed

In this film Gatsby plays a much larger role and lacks all of the mystery that surrounds him in the book.  Tom plays a much smaller role and is much less of a cad while Wilson and Myrtle seem like an after thought. The connections between Tom, Myrtle, and Wilson are just hinted at.  Admittedly this film goes out its way to address and answer some of the questions about Gatsby's past that are hinted at in the book.  Daisy plays a much larger role here than in the book which makes the movie entertaining but really is only hinted at in the book. Perhaps the worst deviation from the book is the very end where the car isn't being driven by Tom but is driven by Daisy. I failed to see the need to do this other than to reach an ending which was very different from the book, other than death of Gatsby.  Still I liked the movie and DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire did a good job.I hated the sound track which pandered to contemporary music tastes but seemed out of place in the movie.

1512777,A34TF7RV7SWECN,B0067EKYS6,samspennell,"[0, 1]","I want to handle this review delicately and accurately, because I think there is a lot to say about this movie, good and bad. I don't know if I'm the only one who picked up on this or felt this way, but I thought the first 1/3 of this move was approaching brilliant. The stylized cuts and fast paced story and movement were kind of brilliant. If it could have maintained that kind of power and verve, this movie would have been as good as, or better than Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece, ""Romeo + Juliet."" The first 1/3 could have been even better, but it was still pretty great.However, I believe, due to the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the fact that Luhrmann sort of ran out of vigor, the last 2/3 seemed really pretty slow and like it was just trudging along. Luhrmann was handed a pretty bland 2/3 of a story by Fitzgerald, but he also didn't rise to the occasion, and make it powerful either. I don't think it's a plot spioler to say that the whole last 2/3 of this movie is waiting to see Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) just work up the nerve to tell a girl that he loves her. Kind of slow, no? The girl is played by Carey Mulligan, and she is beautiful, and has a great face for the role, but there isn't much there, character wise. Another thing is that I personally don't really think that the book ""The Great Gatsby"" was really a masterpiece. I've read it, and I actually thought it was pretty paint by numbers and the dialogue and characters were kind of cardboard cutouts. So the movie slows to a crawl waiting for Gatsby to tell the girl that he loves her, and then the ending is crammed with a bunch of completely improbable events. The story and movie are so crammed with fake situations and characters that you don't really feel much for them. It is such a shame because the beginning was so interesting, and if the whole movie could have maintained and capitalized on the mystery and intrigue that is built in the first 1/3 of the story, it could have actually been pretty spectacular. However, the book itself doesn't really tell the awesomest, most coherent story, and Luhrmann would have had to go pretty far off the page to tell a better story. I don't know what it was, but I didn't really care when we got to the climax of the story.DiCaprio (who I usually don't really like in roles like this) surprised me by doing a fair job. However, he really needs to drop that ever so slight New York (I guess) accent that he tries to do in so many of his movies. It doesn't sound subtle and believable, like I think he is shooting for, it just sounds like he made a half hearted effort to do a New York accent and gave up. He talks in his normal voice, and then every 16th word or so, he throws on a half New York accent. Yikes! It drives me crazy. However, in many scenes, he really showed some tension on his face, like his character was really trying to set things right, and that was nice. He didn't seem exactly like the brushed and polished mysterious figure that you'd want him to be, but overall he did a good job. He also didn't 100% nail the ""old sport""s like you'd love it if he did, but he did good overall character work, and he was ok. I will, however, scream if he gets an Oscar for this role, and you know that somewhere out there, between Hollywood, London, and Australia, there was a better man who could have played the role of Gatsby.Overall, this movie dropped the ball on the mystery and intrigue, but a huge chunk of that was Fitzgerald's fault, and the first 1/3 I thought was actually pretty awesome.

Also not a fan of the voice over, filmmaker seemed to be telling me the story, not showing me. Acting was fine, sets were great. Even if story is about the illusion of love, that people can sometimes fall in love with the idea of love and not the real person, writer should've created a better illusion in Daisy.Gatsby seems an idiot, pining after some woman who'd willingly stay with an awful husband for the grand lifestyle he could provide.  This is my assessment of Daisy before Gatsby's reappearance. If the writer wanted to soften that opinion he should've introduced her as a loving (though glamorous) mother, then we could've given her an out for staying with her oafish husband for her child's sake. Later, she willingly allows another person take responsibility for a crime she commits. Not appealing. Nothing to her but a pretty face, nice figure and youth, all of which change over time.Instead of calling the story The Great Gatsby should've been called The Great Nitwit. Like young people everywhere Gatsby fell in love with beauty, and became blinded by his own love of another person, no crime in that. The problem is when he returns, older and presumably with some experience on him, he still insists on seeing Daisy the way he wants to see her, and not as she is. Basically, he failed to vet her character, to kick the tires so to speak. This mistake is excusable in a young person, but really problematic in a 35 to 40 year old mature man, apparently willing to risk his freedom for someone who doesn't deserve the sacrifice. In fact, if a person asks another or allows another to make such a sacrifice that should be a red flag right there.The audience needed to be seduced by Daisy, as apparently Gatsby is. The writer absolutely needed to attach us to her, so we'd be duped, just as Gatsby is duped but really Gatsby dupes himself. The story is an example of self delusion so I don't understand ""The Great"" part of the title (maybe another viewer can enlighten me). Since we're presented with nothing but Daisy's outer beauty, no way did I find her impressive or noteworthy in any way, and because Gatsby does everything out of his love for her, no way could I attach to him: a fully mature man who makes foolish, overly romantic/dramatic gestures out of blind love, or worse, stupidity and/or hubris.Gatsby is after all pursuing another man's wife, and they have a child, so he's breaking up a family.  By making the husband awful, the writer tries to soften what Gatsby is trying to do, but basically Gatsby wants what he wants and is willing to bust up a marriage to get it. The audience is shown that it wasn't much of a marriage, but apparently it was enough for Daisy, who showed no signs of leaving before Gatsby's appearance. Given his age and life experience, Gatsby should've known to leave all that mess alone.  He was far past 21, and yet refused to see reality (I hate when a writer presents a dumb character; a story can't recover from a dumb hero), and the filmmakers make Daisy seem more a lump of coal than a multi-faceted diamond, so it wasn't communicated why life without her wouldn't be worth living.This story needed to present Daisy as the essence of feminine appeal, in beauty and character, to explain and justify Gatsby's choices: she powers him, he moves the story. A weak Daisy provides no engine. Stars need to better assess screenplays not only for their own part but for the parts of the other characters who motivate them. A star's character does not operate in a vacuum, and is part of a whole, the most important part, but still just a part. Stars must look at the whole and question how all parts fit together. If not, you get stories like this: a hero who looks dumb for throwing it all away for an unworthy woman. A smart star would've looked at the Daisy character and insisted she be better developed to make her more appealing to the audience, not to compete with the hero, but so that when the hero makes the ultimate sacrifice (give up his freedom for her), the audience understands why he'd do such a thing. As written, we have an unappealing dumb hero, and nobody wants a dumb hero/heroine. We need better script assessment, and someone with enough clout to insist changes be made to a script when lesser characters aren't written strongly enough to carry their weight. What's a sign of a superior screenstory? When all characters bring added value. The main mistake here was underwriting Daisy.",2,an underwritten Daisy provides no engine...(SPOILERS),1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,4674,"['Did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Main', 'problem', 'was', 'way', 'Daisy', 'was', 'written', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'why', 'man', 'would', 'worship', 'pretty', 'writer', 'needed', 'give', 'more', 'umph', 'opinion', 'Also', 'not', 'fan', 'voice', 'filmmaker', 'seemed', 'be', 'telling', 'story', 'not', 'showing', 'Acting', 'was', 'fine', 'sets', 'were', 'great', 'Even', 'story', 'illusion', 'love', 'people', 'can', 'sometimes', 'fall', 'love', 'idea', 'love', 'not', 'real', 'person', 'writer', 'should', ""'ve"", 'created', 'better', 'illusion', 'Daisy.Gatsby', 'idiot', 'pining', 'woman', 'who', 'willingly', 'stay', 'awful', 'husband', 'grand', 'lifestyle', 'could', 'provide', 'assessment', 'Daisy', 'Gatsby', 'reappearance', 'writer', 'wanted', 'soften', 'opinion', 'should', ""'ve"", 'introduced', 'loving', 'glamorous', 'mother', 'then', 'could', ""'ve"", 'given', 'out', 'staying', 'oafish', 'husband', 'child', 'sake', 'Later', 'willingly', 'person', 'take', 'responsibility', 'crime', 'Not', 'appealing', 'Nothing', 'pretty', 'face', 'nice', 'figure', 'youth', 'change', 'time.Instead', 'calling', 'story', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'called', 'Great', 'Nitwit', 'young', 'people', 'everywhere', 'Gatsby', 'fell', 'love', 'beauty', 'became', 'blinded', 'own', 'love', 'person', 'crime', 'problem', 'when', 'older', 'presumably', 'experience', 'still', 'seeing', 'Daisy', 'way', 'see', 'not', 'Basically', 'failed', 'vet', 'character', 'kick', 'tires', 'so', 'speak', 'mistake', 'excusable', 'young', 'person', 'really', 'problematic', '35', '40', 'year', 'old', 'mature', 'man', 'apparently', 'willing', 'risk', 'freedom', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'sacrifice', 'fact', 'person', 'make', 'such', 'sacrifice', 'should', 'be', 'red', 'flag', 'right', 'there.The', 'audience', 'needed', 'be', 'seduced', 'Daisy', 'apparently', 'Gatsby', 'writer', 'absolutely', 'needed', 'attach', ""'d"", 'be', 'duped', 'just', 'Gatsby', 'duped', 'really', 'Gatsby', 'story', 'example', 'self', 'delusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Great', 'part', 'title', 'maybe', 'viewer', 'can', 'enlighten', ""'re"", 'presented', 'nothing', 'Daisy', 'outer', 'beauty', 'way', 'did', 'find', 'impressive', 'noteworthy', 'way', 'Gatsby', 'everything', 'love', 'way', 'could', 'attach', 'fully', 'mature', 'man', 'who', 'foolish', 'overly', 'romantic/dramatic', 'gestures', 'blind', 'love', 'worse', 'stupidity', 'and/or', 'hubris.Gatsby', 'pursuing', 'man', 'wife', 'have', 'child', 'breaking', 'up', 'family', 'making', 'husband', 'awful', 'writer', 'soften', 'what', 'Gatsby', 'trying', 'do', 'basically', 'Gatsby', 'what', 'willing', 'bust', 'up', 'marriage', 'get', 'audience', 'shown', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'marriage', 'apparently', 'was', 'enough', 'Daisy', 'who', 'showed', 'signs', 'leaving', 'Gatsby', 'appearance', 'Given', 'age', 'life', 'experience', 'Gatsby', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'leave', 'mess', 'alone', 'was', 'far', 'past', '21', 'yet', 'refused', 'see', 'reality', 'hate', 'when', 'writer', 'dumb', 'character', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recover', 'dumb', 'hero', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'Daisy', 'seem', 'more', 'lump', 'coal', 'multi-faceted', 'diamond', 'was', ""n't"", 'communicated', 'why', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'worth', 'living.This', 'story', 'needed', 'present', 'Daisy', 'essence', 'feminine', 'appeal', 'beauty', 'character', 'explain', 'justify', 'Gatsby', 'choices', 'story', 'weak', 'Daisy', 'engine', 'Stars', 'need', 'better', 'assess', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'part', 'parts', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'motivate', 'star', 'character', 'not', 'operate', 'vacuum', 'part', 'whole', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'still', 'just', 'part', 'Stars', 'must', 'look', 'whole', 'question', 'how', 'parts', 'fit', 'together', 'not', 'get', 'stories', 'hero', 'who', 'dumb', 'throwing', 'away', 'unworthy', 'woman', 'smart', 'star', 'would', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'Daisy', 'character', 'insisted', 'be', 'better', 'developed', 'make', 'more', 'appealing', 'audience', 'not', 'compete', 'hero', 'so', 'when', 'hero', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'give', 'up', 'freedom', 'audience', 'why', ""'d"", 'do', 'thing', 'written', 'have', 'unappealing', 'dumb', 'hero', 'nobody', 'dumb', 'hero/heroine', 'need', 'better', 'script', 'assessment', 'someone', 'enough', 'clout', 'insist', 'changes', 'be', 'made', 'script', 'when', 'lesser', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'written', 'strongly', 'enough', 'carry', 'weight', 'What', 'sign', 'superior', 'screenstory', 'When', 'characters', 'bring', 'added', 'value', 'main', 'mistake', 'here', 'was', 'underwriting', 'Daisy']",The Great Gatsby 2013

Joel Edgerton and Isla Fisher did good jobs in capturing the torrid but scandalous romance between Tom Buchanan and Myrtle Wilson. However, I admit that my three favorite character portrayals in the movie were that of Jay Gatsby (played in an extraordinary way by Leonardo Dicaprio), Daisy Buchanan (sensual and brilliant portrayal), and Nick Carraway (outstanding performance by Tobey Maguire). I personally feel that Dicaprio really became one with the Jay Gatsby character and brought the Gatsby persona to life. It was both touching and tragic to see how far he went for his love of Daisy Buchanan. You then have the character of Daisy Buchanan who is mutually in love with Jay Gatsby, and is conflicted on what to do. Last, but not least, there is the heartfelt depiction of Nick Carraway as one with a strong conscience and sees mainly the best in Jay Gatsby. However, his natural concern for Gatsby towards the end of the film was portrayed in an extreme light.

1512798,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B0067EKYS6,Steven Johnson,"[1, 2]","Like the tragic characters and stories that light up the screen and wrench up our hearts, The Great Gatsby 2013 film adaptation is almost more devastating for how great it could have been. Baz Luhrmann's film is a very, very good one. But it is not great.The performances are excellent. Reviews have been somewhat mixed on Leonardo DiCaprio, but I think he gives us a perfect Gatsby, who pairs beautifully with the always-exceptional Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, rounded out by the superb Tobey Maguire, in one of his first noteworthy roles in years.Luhrmann has achieved something few film adaptations of classic literature have; he has taken a work, the F. Scott Fitzergerald novel, which is of course rich with symbolism and meaning, and maintained all these complex themes that your high school English teacher beat into you, without feeling remotely forced or condescending. He allows the audience to reach their own conclusions, both about the characters (particularly Gatsby and Daisy, whom polarize audiences in both their novel and film representations) as well as the iconic symbolism (THE GREEN LIGHT, T.J. Eckleberg).This is where The Great Gatsby succeeds the most; when taking the source material at its most shallow surface, the story could be represented just as carelessly and giddy as the characters pretend to be. Yet, behind every line and every action, there is an air of tragedy, and Luhrmann knows how to bring that out to great effect.Luhrmann also does what he usually does best, through the noticeably anachronistic soundtrack. The setting may look like the 1920s, but it sure doesn't sound like it, with an urban soundscape rich with beats by Jay-Z and a haunting love theme by Lana Del Rey.While Luhrmann employs many of his old tricks, they do not feel as over-the-top or cinematically overwhelming as they could be taken in other films. I love Moulin Rouge with all my heart, but the fast editing and goofy humor could understandably turn some audiences off; The Great Gatsby feels so much more grown-up, as a Luhrmann film free of the cartoonish qualities that may have dampered his prior works.Where the film disappoints though is through its pacing, especially towards the end; the scenes, while visually stunning and often emotionally compelling through the stellar performances and soundtrack, but so much of film's motion is through mood, not action, which weighed me down by the end of this 2 1/2 hour epic. There are also some odd choices with visual effects, which you will likely know when you see them (re: the film's narrative structure).These slight disappointments make me hesitant in my review of this film; much of it, particularly the scene when Gatsby and Nick Carroway make their deal, and the montage of Gatsby and Daisy reunited, are excellent and still stick with me long after leaving the theater. These kinds of moments are Baz Luhrmann at his best, and I wish The Great Gatsby, for all the time and effort put into it, was as sharp as these glorious scenes in the middle were.It is still a very good movie and I recommend seeing on the big screen in gorgeous, colorful 3D. I will likely be revisiting The Great Gatsby and am anxious to see how my opinion develops as my relationship with this film continues through repeat viewings. But for now, I can only go so high as four stars.",4,"Overall pretty good, but with some great moments",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,3342,"['tragic', 'characters', 'stories', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'wrench', 'up', 'hearts', 'Great', 'Gatsby', '2013', 'film', 'adaptation', 'almost', 'more', 'devastating', 'how', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'great.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Reviews', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'mixed', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'think', 'perfect', 'Gatsby', 'who', 'beautifully', 'always-exceptional', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Daisy', 'Buchanan', 'rounded', 'out', 'superb', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'one', 'first', 'noteworthy', 'roles', 'years.Luhrmann', 'achieved', 'something', 'few', 'film', 'adaptations', 'classic', 'literature', 'have', 'taken', 'work', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzergerald', 'novel', 'course', 'rich', 'symbolism', 'meaning', 'maintained', 'complex', 'themes', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'beat', 'feeling', 'remotely', 'forced', 'condescending', 'audience', 'reach', 'own', 'conclusions', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Gatsby', 'Daisy', 'whom', 'polarize', 'audiences', 'novel', 'film', 'representations', 'as', 'well', 'iconic', 'symbolism', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'LIGHT', 'T.J.', 'Eckleberg', '.This', 'where', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'most', 'when', 'taking', 'source', 'material', 'most', 'shallow', 'surface', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'represented', 'just', 'carelessly', 'giddy', 'characters', 'pretend', 'be', 'line', 'action', 'air', 'tragedy', 'Luhrmann', 'how', 'bring', 'great', 'effect.Luhrmann', 'also', 'what', 'usually', 'best', 'noticeably', 'anachronistic', 'soundtrack', 'setting', 'may', 'look', '1920s', 'sure', ""n't"", 'sound', 'urban', 'soundscape', 'rich', 'beats', 'Jay-Z', 'haunting', 'love', 'theme', 'Lana', 'Del', 'Rey.While', 'Luhrmann', 'many', 'old', 'tricks', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'over-the-top', 'cinematically', 'overwhelming', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'other', 'films', 'love', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'heart', 'fast', 'editing', 'goofy', 'humor', 'could', 'understandably', 'turn', 'audiences', 'off', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'grown-up', 'Luhrmann', 'film', 'free', 'cartoonish', 'qualities', 'may', 'have', 'dampered', 'prior', 'works.Where', 'film', 'disappoints', 'pacing', 'especially', 'end', 'scenes', 'visually', 'stunning', 'often', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'stellar', 'performances', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'motion', 'mood', 'not', 'action', 'weighed', 'down', 'end', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'epic', 'are', 'also', 'odd', 'choices', 'visual', 'effects', 'will', 'likely', 'know', 'when', 'see', 're', 'film', 'narrative', 'structure', '.These', 'slight', 'disappointments', 'make', 'hesitant', 'review', 'film', 'much', 'particularly', 'scene', 'when', 'Gatsby', 'Nick', 'Carroway', 'make', 'deal', 'montage', 'Gatsby', 'Daisy', 'reunited', 'are', 'excellent', 'still', 'stick', 'long', 'leaving', 'theater', 'kinds', 'moments', 'are', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'best', 'wish', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'time', 'effort', 'put', 'was', 'as', 'sharp', 'glorious', 'scenes', 'middle', 'were.It', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'gorgeous', 'colorful', '3D', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'revisiting', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'am', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'opinion', 'relationship', 'film', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'now', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'high', 'four', 'stars']",The Great Gatsby 2013

He actually has chemistry with Carey Mulligan, which he and Kate Winslet did not have together. As he plays Gatsby, he's anxious, energetic, sad, nervous, romantic and devoted...Robert Redford's Gatsby just seemed hyper.Carey Mulligan's Daisy is wimpy, weak and unlikeable.  Mia Farrow's Daisy was flighty, flaky, shallow and unlikeable.Tobey Maguire...is just Tobey Maguire.  When speaking to his doctor, he seems to weirdly emphasize every single word.  His characterization of Nick is not realistic.The first half of the movie, I did not care for the rap music, the scenes jumping around, or the way everyone spoke as quickly as they could (making the closed captioning go faster too). I also did not like all the crazy, careening, fast driving around..but maybe they were trying to make a point how careless these people were.The second half was more the story of Daisy and Jay...Jay's desire for Daisy's love and his love (or infatuation) for her. Daisy just seemed to go along with him...not having much gumption to make up her mind either way.  It seemed strange that she would refuse to lie about ever loving her husband (which made her husband feel triumphant), but she refused to say that she did not love him now.Did Jay only want Daisy because of what she represented to him? Success and that she came from a good family? Did he only love what he thought that she was, not seeing her true nature?

which stood up in its own right,for creating a parallel universe of the Gatsby phenomemon.The excess of the parties was a little too excessive,in that everything seemed too rehearsed,too razz-a-ma-tazz,too many fireworks,too much glitter and confetti,it all looked like it was going to go up in smoke or evaporate.It treated everything like it was pushing success,materialism,designer goods,conspicuous consumption,at the expense of the hollowness andfailure,the disillusionment and disenchantment of Gatsby's dream.It's OK in 2D,by the way.Lurhmann uses a clever framing device as the film opens with Nick Carraway (McGuire),recounting episodes from his life in rehab,unwinding to a psychiatrist in detox from alcohol.This forms the basis of his writing of the novel The Great Gatsby.He is both inside and outside everything like Fitzgerald looking in to worlds that exclude him.This is a useful technique to have the narrator tell the story.But it makes the mistake somewhere in an early party of saying he'd been drunk just twice in his life!What Lurhmann does well is recreate the area of East Egg and West Egg, and the stretch of water in between Gatsby's mansion and Daisy's and Tom's Buchanan.The drive from New York through the marvellous Ash Heaps near the Wilson's garage, is superbly realized,with help from a camera moving skywards out into the water.The fast cars are very fast with beautiful coach work.Best of all DiCaprio pulled off the greatest of the 3 filmed Gatsby's.He hints at the great dream that's driven him to create his mansion and all his wealth as well as the dark side.Cary Mulligan too suggests very well the unobtainable rich girl,but also the shallowness and inability to take responsibility after the crash or even to choose Gatsby after all.The minor characters,the Wilson's,Jordan Baker,Dan Cody not drawn so well.Joel Edgerton plays Tom Buchanan as if to the manner born,with nastiness and aggression.Jaz-y's music is used cleverly to suggest all the influences of the Roaring Twenties as well as the bling.Lurhmann has ventriloquised New York waterways and skyscrapers from his base in Australia using special effects.This film has been hyped for so long I almost never saw it,and its been slated by the critics.But having seen previous films Romeo and Juliet(updated) and Moulin Rouge(all singing & dancing),I think he has done a version of 2013 in 1922 and he's breathed new energy and life(Ok 3D)at a time of depression in world markets into this perfect gem of a book.Whether Daisy was worthy of the intensity of

BUT, to my eternal regret, after suffering through the Buzzkill Luridman version on DVD, it hit me how grossly I had underestimated the Aussie knack for hideous kitsch. When compared to Luridman's Fantasia on a Theme by Inspired by Fitzgerald, the problematic 1974 Gatsby becomes the very model of refinement. At least the '74 version has a script by Francis Ford Coppola, who apparently did actually read the original novel.Everything we see here suggests that Luridman was much too discombobulated on a combo of pills, powders, pot or whatever to maintain the concentration to even listen to the audiobook for such a very short novel. His movie is ludicrously over the top, utterly tone deaf, and quite possibly displays either:(a.) the tackiest art direction in the entire history of Hollywood or(b.) the worst, most cluttered and absurdly excessive CGI,either (or both) of which make for rather a remarkable achievement.The casting is absurdly awful throughout, with the minor exception of Carey Mulligan, who does marginally more resemble a brain-dead Daisy Buchanan than Mia Farrow did in the '74 Robert Redford vehicle, where at least Redford had quasi-charming moments as Gatsby (and wore the Ralph Lauren wardrobe reasonably well).

1512816,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B0067EKYS6,The People's Critic,"[0, 1]","May 10th, 2013 marked the highly anticipated release of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. This film marks the fourth time F. Scott Fitzgerald's glitzy classic has seen the big-screen treatment. It seems that in an almost poetic piece of truth, filmmakers have been reaching for their own `elusive green light' in that no one has been able to cinematically capture the full power and prestige of the classic novel. It's unusual for a book to be adapted to film every 25 years or so, but that is precisely what has happened. Alan Ladd played the mysterious Jay Gatsby in 1949, Robert Redford in 1974, Toby Stephens in the deplorable A&E; TV movie in 2000, and now Leonardo Dicaprio steps into that legendary yellow car's driver's seat. Is the fourth time a charm?It's the roaring 20s in America and in the midst of America's strongest economic boom in history, Nick Caraway (Toby Maguire) puts his writing career on hold and leaves the Midwest for the magic of New York as a bond salesman. Caraway becomes fascinated with his mysterious neighbor (Gatsby) as rumors about the man and his wealth circulate all around him. Nick is drawn into Gatsby's lavish world and through him, the audience is presented Fitzgerald's cautionary fable of excess, greed, and moral decay that lies beneath the surface of social luxury.Fourth time a charm? The answer to this question is a complex one. The appeal to this film rests in the impeccable casting of Dicaprio as Gatsby and the choice of such a distinctive director in Luhrmann. Luhrmann and Dicaprio have, of course, successfully updated a classic once before with 1996's Romeo + Juliet. While The People's Critic was not that impressed with that film, it can be admired for its style and individuality. The Great Gatsby does not disappoint in terms of its style, which is no surprise given Luhrmann's reputation.The film chooses to introduce Caraway slightly differently from the novel, and in that commits its first mistake. The tone of the film is altered right from the start, and Caraway's character is strangely identified as a flawed and beaten down man; he is introduced as a man clinging to sanity. Fans of the book will also be incredibly disappointed in some glaringly missing elements from the film's final act. These changes result in a sacrifice of some major complexities within a major character's past. Nonetheless, the middle section of the film is faithful to the novel and develops very well.The cast is rounded out nicely with Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan and Joel Edgerton as her husband Tom. Isla Fisher plays Tom's mistress Myrtle and newcomer Elizabeth Debicki plays the vapid vamp, Jordan Baker. Luhrmann is guilty of rushing the pace a bit too much when it comes to developing these characters, but this is likely because he knows the story swings on the hinge of Gatsby and Caraway's relationship. Unfortunately the pacing does affect the film's effectiveness. This and some astonishingly poor editing reduces the film's overall impact. Consequently, Maguire effectively sets up awe and majesty for the appearance of Dicaprio, although the anticipated reveal of his character is not quite as satisfying as it should be.The Great Gatsby is a story of mood. A successful adaptation must transcend regurgitation of plotpoints and allow the viewer to feel and experience the raw nature of desire and time's fleeting nature. It is here that Luhrmann does succeed. The major victory for this film is in its capturing of the essence of the novel, the time, and the message. Bold choices from contemporary music, effective use of slow motion, and inventive camera placement make the movie exciting and at times, well...Great. I do, however, question the decision for executive producer Jay-Z to use four songs by himself or Beyonce in a film that so urgently attacks bravado, audacity, and arrogance. The Great Gatsby is the best adaptation of Fitzgerald's material, and Dicaprio adds another iconic role to his ever impressive career. While the film is not perfect and will certainly provide some disappointments for fans of the book, the film does stand on its own as a determined, flashy, show-piece of entertainment.

Sweeney,"[2, 2]","I've also seen the 1949 version of this movie (thought not the 1926 or 1974 versions) and all I remember of it is the last scene, which guarantees an unhappy ending. Since I was a child, I was terribly disappointed and thought the whole thing unfair. As an adult, seeing this version, I now understand the whole thing. In spite of Nick Carroway's declaration that Jay Gatsby is the &#34;most optimisitic person&#34; he's ever known, Gatsby appears surprisingly naive for someone who's been through a war and is now in league with the criminal element. As a man in love with a woman who in the end proves too cowardly to openly declare her own love, he appears more enamoured with the memory of that woman  than the real thing.  In other words, Jay Gatsby is a tragedy just waiting to happen...and when it does, it's not even of his own making.  The characters are ones now almost stock and caricatures...the woman he loved and lost and hopes to love again...her profligate husband, a playboy sportsman no longer able to indulge in his favored game thus reverting to drink and women, the wife's best friend who isn't much of one in the end...and the onlooker/confident who arrives almost an innocent himself and is slowly drawn into their world, to document and comment on the events as they unfold.Spectacle is the watchword here...from the Bauhaus-decorated introduction to the lavish tsunami of sound, color, and artistic  camera shots and angles. The story itself is diminished into something which could've been told in just a few scenes if the epic grandeur of all that cinematography were taken away. The scenes themselves take on a surreal quality with symbolism blatant throughout, and the characters themselves become almost an allegory, the Flaming Youth, the gangster with a heart still in part uncorrupted, the youthful love which didn't die but isn't really as he remembers it.

You either loved or hated it for its visual extravaganza, and now he has turned F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel into a film (and in 3D). While the film's lavish period costume (with a support from Prada and Miu Miu) captures the spirit of the jazz age, the script needs a lot of improvement.I don't summarize the story here. I only report that the new film adaptation begins with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a sanatorium, writing down his past experiences as therapy. It is great to see veteran actor Jack Thompson as his doctor, but the unnecessary frame narrative device only slows down the film, removing us further from the titular hero we really want to meet.After the visually dazzling party scene, we finally meet Jay Gatsby. Leonardo DiCaprio is effective as a man of colossal vitality, showing off his wealth for one purpose only. The film finally gets interesting as Jay Gatsby is reunited with Nick's second cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan), Gatsby's dream girl, now married to rich and pompous Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton).Among the melodramatic contrivances and one-dimensional characters, DiCaprio's charismatic Gatsby stands out, and his friendship with Nick Carraway is one of the most credible aspects of the film.

1512830,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0067EKYS6,Turfseer,"[0, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Most of the critical reviews of Baz Luhrmann's new take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, 'The Great Gatsby', focus on its over the top production values. Here are a few samples of the type of criticism I am referring to: ""a near-constant bombardment of visual over stimulation,"" ""mostly a cacophony of style, excess and noise that makes you want to turn it all down a notch,"" ""anachronistic convergence of hip-hop and swing,"" ""all look and no feel,"" ""hyper-active cacophony rather than enthralling entertainment,"" ""baroque, overblown, megalomaniacal spectacles,"" (with Luhrmann) ""less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste.""Aside from the hip-hop and unnecessary use of 3-D, Luhrmann's penchant for overindulgence didn't really bother me. In fact, one of the titles Fitzgerald came up with before settling on 'Gatsby', was ""Trimalchio in West Egg""--referencing the obnoxious, ancient Roman 'noveau riche' businessman in Petronius' 'Satyricon', known for his wild orgy-like feasts. I'm not sure at all whether Fitzgerald would have actually objected to all those over-the-top, gaudy spectacles, Luhrmann proffers up here in his take on the 1920s 'jazz age'.Getting back to the critical reviews, only Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times actually has the temerity to suggest that Fitzgerald's source material is no masterpiece: ""Though it is gorgeously written and often cited as one of the great American novels, Fitzgerald's ""Gatsby"" is in fact very much a slender reed, a tragedy in a minor key."" I would go further and argue that Fitzgerald's main character is not fleshed out at all and woefully unconvincing. Hence, no matter how Luhrmann 'jazzes' up 'Gatsby' (whether successful or not), Fitzgerald's source material will leave any film director handicapped from the get-go, in attempting to successfully adapt the novel from page to screen.The Gatsby slow-moving introduction appears intentional, as the mystery behind the elusive tycoon, is built up. Again, the gaudy production values (the costumes, the old cars, the set designs) are enough to keep one settled, until the story really begins to pick up. One notes that Nick Carraway, an ordinary 'Joe', plays the part of the protagonist's only true ally. Carraway, the film's narrator, appears to be a stand in for Fitzgerald himself.Perhaps the best scene in the film is when Gatsby is introduced to Carraway, his social inferior, and then takes him on a tour of 'his world' the next day, setting out in his Yellow Duesenberg (let's not be too upset that this is a 1929 Duesenberg, and the scene takes place in 1922!). Gatsby of course has an ulterior motive: he hopes that Carraway, will help him reunite with his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan, who happens to be Carraway's cousin!The problem with all this is Gatsby's character. Can you really believe any of it? It's obvious that Fitzgerald, through Carraway, creates an idealized picture of a ruthless gangster, who just happens to go goo-goo eyes over a woman he fell for, five years earlier, before his 'trial by fire', as a confirmed bootlegger . You would think a gangster like Gatsby would have modeled himself on a realistic character like Tony Soprano, who never had any compunctions about going from one woman to another, disposing of them at his whim, in rapid succession. But no, Gatsby is such a noble, mushy guy, that he pines for Daisy (a complete airhead who we learn nothing about) and will even take the heat, when Daisy is on the hook for vehicular manslaughter (at film's end).Another convenient strategy is for Fitzgerald (again through Carraway's perspective), to ignore Gatsby's dark side by failing to show us any of Gatsby's malevolent behaviors in the bootlegger's world, which allowed him to accumulate all his money, and rise to the top. What's more, Tom Buchannan, the antagonist we must compare to the 'noble' Gatsby, is a flat-out cartoon racist who is constantly mouthing pronouncements about how the white race continually faces annihilation by 'darker peoples.'Fitzgerald wants us to feel bad about Gatsby when Carraway informs us that no one who attended his extravagant parties, shows up for his funeral. Why in fact should we feel sorry for Gatsby? If in fact, he resembled a fleshed out, real person, then I could have easily felt some sympathy. But the truth of the matter is that Gatsby exists only in F. Scott Fitzgerald's imagination. There is no attempt to create a real-life person here and isn't that what 'art' should be about?For those who say 'Gatsby' is purely a fable, I say a good fable should reflect 'reality'. Despite being a master of descriptive phraseology, Fitzgerald's characters are the stuff of cheap melodrama: a 'softy' sociopath with a heart of gold. Don't feel sorry for Gatsby as Nick Carraway does at film's end--and don't put him on pedestal. Break out some of your old Soprano DVDs--if you want a true portrait, of a REAL gangster!",2,Gaudy production values can't save Luhrmann's latest due to Fitzgerald's weak source

1512842,A2Q31IVRP9MYQX,B0067EKYS6,"William L. Isley, Jr.","[3, 3]","The short answer is, &#8220;Go ahead, but read the book!&#8221;  However, the short answer is deceptively  simplistic.  The reality is that even when Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#8217;s most famous novel, Hollywood&#8217;s third, is at its worse it may be due to his desire to be faithful to the written work.For example the two most egregious errors of the movie are the musical score and the presentation of the parties at Gatsby&#8217;s mansion.  The modern hip-hop music of Jay-Z and Beyonc&eacute; is wholly inappropriate, not to mention woefully anachronistic, and the party scenes are way overdone.  It may be that Luhrmann thought that an historically accurate rendition of Roaring Twenties&#8217; bacchanalia and music would fail to capture for our contemporary jaded society Fitzgerald&#8217;s portrayal of Jazz Age decadence.Two other shortcomings may be due to the same desire for fidelity to Fitzgerald&#8217;s story.  The acting (Leonardo diCaprio plays Gatsby and Tobey Maguire is Nick Carraway, the narrator and Gatsby&#8217;s neighbor) seems lifeless, and the computerized scenes (And, no, I did not waste my time and money on the 3-D version!) are ridiculous.  Nevertheless, they may be an attempt to portray respectively the detachment of the main characters from their surroundings or even from reality and the pervasive force of their illusions.Fortunately, the movie in the main follows Fitzgerald&#8217;s story line.  Even more importantly, it preserves the novel&#8217;s reflective, at times philosophical, narration by Nick.  It does so by the happy technique of having Nick recovering in an asylum by writing the story of Gatsby.  Although this framework is not part of the novel, it does allow us to hear Fitzgerald&#8217;s very words, even that hauntingly despairing romantic anti-romantic passage with which he so famously concludes his great novel.The Great Gatsby is a poignant critique by an American of American society.  It is much more than an expos&eacute; of the shallowness of Roaring Twenties frivolity and rebelliousness, a lifestyle that Fitzgerald not only knew about but also lived in many ways.  It is a commentary on the differences between the East and Midwest.  It also displays the futility of the frenetic forces of American progressivism to combat the deep countercurrents of the past.At its deepest and most universal The Great Gatsby is a cautionary tale concerning the destructive illusions created by living a dream.  Gatsby had a dream of being a member of the elite wealthy of American society.  Daisy and his love for her were an essential part of that dream.  He created a false persona to conform to his dream.  In the end he could neither escape his real past nor recapture a seemingly ideal moment from it and his dream consumed him.Fitzgerald&#8217;s writing is richly textured and poetic, something that no movie can ever capture.  It is also a bleak and hopeless vision of human life in which &#8220;we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&#8220;Fitzgerald&#8217;s masterpiece deserves a careful reading, yes, even a meditative one.  It reminds us that such an attempt at self-creation as Gatsby&#8217;s repeats the fundamental human desire to be like God and the disastrous consequences of self-deifying hubris described in Genesis 3 and 4.  It should lead us to examine our hearts in order to see whether we have fallen prey to this human tendency to live in a self-created dream world that we strive to make a reality.  But I speak as a Christian who believes in the possibility of change, of a turning around and going against the current, a painful turning around called repentance.  This repentance is not a human possibility.  It is only possible because of the One who entered the current of history from the outside and can redeem us from this present evil age, bearing us against the current to the new age created by God.So, go ahead and see the movie, if you want to, but please, please read the book.",3,Should You See the Movie?,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,4041,"['short', 'answer', '8220', 'Go', 'ahead', 'read', 'book', '8221', 'However', 'short', 'answer', 'deceptively', 'simplistic', 'reality', 'even', 'when', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', '8217', 's', 'adaptation', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 'most', 'famous', 'novel', 'Hollywood', '8217', 's', 'third', 'worse', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'desire', 'be', 'faithful', 'written', 'work.For', 'example', 'two', 'most', 'egregious', 'errors', 'movie', 'are', 'musical', 'score', 'presentation', 'parties', 'Gatsby', '8217', 's', 'mansion', 'modern', 'hip-hop', 'music', 'Jay-Z', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'wholly', 'inappropriate', 'not', 'mention', 'woefully', 'anachronistic', 'party', 'scenes', 'are', 'way', 'overdone', 'may', 'be', 'Luhrmann', 'thought', 'historically', 'accurate', 'rendition', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', '8217', 'bacchanalia', 'music', 'would', 'fail', 'capture', 'contemporary', 'jaded', 'society', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 'portrayal', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'other', 'shortcomings', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'same', 'desire', 'fidelity', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 's', 'story', 'acting', 'Leonardo', 'diCaprio', 'Gatsby', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'narrator', 'Gatsby', '8217', 'neighbor', 'lifeless', 'computerized', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'money', '3-D', 'version', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'Nevertheless', 'may', 'be', 'attempt', 'portray', 'respectively', 'detachment', 'main', 'characters', 'surroundings', 'even', 'reality', 'pervasive', 'force', 'illusions.Fortunately', 'movie', 'main', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 'story', 'line', 'Even', 'more', 'importantly', 'novel', '8217', 'reflective', 'times', 'philosophical', 'narration', 'Nick', 'so', 'happy', 'technique', 'having', 'Nick', 'recovering', 'asylum', 'writing', 'story', 'Gatsby', 'framework', 'not', 'part', 'novel', 'allow', 'hear', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 'very', 'words', 'even', 'hauntingly', 'despairing', 'romantic', 'anti-romantic', 'passage', 'so', 'famously', 'great', 'novel.The', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'poignant', 'critique', 'American', 'American', 'society', 'much', 'more', 'expos', 'eacute', 'shallowness', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'frivolity', 'rebelliousness', 'lifestyle', 'Fitzgerald', 'not', 'only', 'knew', 'also', 'lived', 'many', 'ways', 'commentary', 'differences', 'East', 'Midwest', 'also', 'futility', 'frenetic', 'forces', 'American', 'progressivism', 'combat', 'deep', 'countercurrents', 'past.At', 'deepest', 'most', 'universal', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'concerning', 'destructive', 'illusions', 'created', 'living', 'dream', 'Gatsby', 'had', 'dream', 'being', 'member', 'elite', 'wealthy', 'American', 'society', 'Daisy', 'love', 'were', 'essential', 'part', 'dream', 'created', 'false', 'persona', 'conform', 'dream', 'end', 'could', 'neither', 'escape', 'real', 'past', 'recapture', 'seemingly', 'ideal', 'moment', 'dream', 'consumed', 'him.Fitzgerald', '8217', 'writing', 'richly', 'textured', 'poetic', 'something', 'movie', 'can', 'ever', 'capture', 'also', 'bleak', 'hopeless', 'vision', 'human', 'life', '8220', 'beat', 'boats', 'current', 'borne', 'back', 'ceaselessly', 'past.', '8220', 'Fitzgerald', '8217', 'masterpiece', 'careful', 'reading', 'yes', 'even', 'meditative', 'one', 'attempt', 'self-creation', 'Gatsby', '8217', 'fundamental', 'human', 'desire', 'be', 'God', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'self-deifying', 'hubris', 'described', 'Genesis', '3', '4', 'should', 'lead', 'examine', 'hearts', 'order', 'see', 'have', 'fallen', 'prey', 'human', 'tendency', 'live', 'self-created', 'dream', 'world', 'strive', 'make', 'reality', 'speak', 'Christian', 'who', 'possibility', 'change', 'turning', 'around', 'going', 'current', 'painful', 'turning', 'around', 'called', 'repentance', 'repentance', 'not', 'human', 'possibility', 'only', 'possible', 'One', 'who', 'entered', 'current', 'history', 'outside', 'can', 'redeem', 'present', 'evil', 'age', 'bearing', 'current', 'new', 'age', 'created', 'God.So', 'go', 'ahead', 'see', 'movie', 'want', 'please', 'please', 'read', 'book']",The Great Gatsby 2013

For all its visual panache it is at heart a psychological spiral into the mind of a man. Obsessed. Transfixed. Driven. Alone. Utterly alone.The distortion of money looms over it all. Vast amounts and none at all. Motivations abused. The screenplay is joyfully literary in its use of language. Perhaps too much is told rather than shown but the descriptions, the adjectives are to be savored.The 3D side of the effect suffers from being a letterbox widescreen aspect ratio (black bar top and bottom) even on my 100"" projection screen. It is on a par with Hugo 3D but nowhere near Avatar. It is, after all, a domestic story even if the domestic settings are large mansions upon a river bank.Perhaps its greatest accolade is that I'm looking forward to seeing it again.

Well, if you like a leisurely paced mystery that turns tragic, yes.  If you enjoyed the book, it follows the novel well.So what's to complain about here?  First, the music.  Often it is so distracting and off-putting and inaccurate that I almost gave up on the movie.  Is this an F. Scott Fitzgerald adaptation or a commercial for Jay-Z and Beyonce?  At one point the soundtrack is a slower version of Crazy in Love.  What the heck?  Other points in the film sound like two songs played at once over one another.  Then there is the rap.  Rap?  Really?  In a novel set in 1922?  The Roaring 20's had some cool and appropriate music.  Why ruin the film with such an inaccuracy?Second, a little distracting is the color.  Often the scenes are so over-saturated in various colors that it feels like you are watching one of Willy Wonka's wildest dreams.  Or an explosion at a jellybean factory.  Just overdone.  Why?Other than these flaws, the movie is a faithful presentation of Fitzgerald's book.  The tragedy of Gatsby's love for a woman who is not worth the dirt on his loafers is still poignant.  The statement this story makes about the vapid and cruel and wasteful existences of the rich is still appropriate.  Following Gatsby via NIck is still heart-wrenching and interesting.And the ending is quite sad, but quite well-done.  Kudos to DiCaprio and Maguire.
