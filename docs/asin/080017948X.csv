He doesn't want to be where he is at all and doesn't like the people he is with. This single day becomes a prison for him from which there is no escape. He trys everything including suicide but everyday begins the same with him waking up in bed in a Bed and Breakfast to the same awful Sonny and Cher song ""I Got You Babe"" on the radio. Perhaps he is dead and in hell. Eventually after who knows how many repeats of this of this seeming glitch in spacetime he comes to accept his fate. He seizes the day, learns new skills, undergoes a personality change, and becomes the most totally engaged, positive and plugged in person to a point that is beyond belief superhuman. All this effort centers around hooking up with a lovely lady who he traveled into town with (What else but romantic love with change a western man trapped in a Hollywood plot). She of course remembers not a single thing each new day (I wonder what twisted notions could have gone through his mind). He in the end wins her heart and finding love with her is what ultimately frees him and he finally is allowed to begin a new day, the day after Groundhog Day. But now he loves the town and wants to stay there forever. He has changed and found true happiness and the very same place and people that were his personal hell are now his heaven. In the real world time stops for no man and you don't get countless repeats to get it right but who doesn't feel like they've had their share of Groundhog Days--just in the sense of being trapped having to deal with the same stuff day after day after day?? That's why the movie strikes a cord. And he self-improves, becomes a super friendly overachiever and gets the babe and Tony Robinson couldn't have outdone this fable.GROUNDHOG DAY is a unique movie, well written and directed, well cast, and Bill Murray gave a pitch perfect performance. The only way to avoid real life Groundhog Days is to live a lot more even while not having a lot of time; but don't worry about perfection or think it is romantic love that will save you..... that's TOO Hollywood.",5,Timeless Classic,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,2356,"['So', 'weatherman', 'who', 'way', 'wind', 'blows', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'interested', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'rodent', 'doing', 'predicting', 'must', 'conform', 'embrace', 'reality', 'single', 'dreaded', 'day', 'only', 'escape', 'very', 'start', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'where', ""n't"", 'like', 'people', 'single', 'day', 'prison', 'escape', 'trys', 'everything', 'including', 'suicide', 'everyday', 'same', 'waking', 'up', 'bed', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'same', 'awful', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'song', 'Got', 'Babe', 'radio', 'Perhaps', 'dead', 'hell', 'Eventually', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'repeats', 'seeming', 'glitch', 'spacetime', 'accept', 'fate', 'day', 'new', 'skills', 'personality', 'change', 'most', 'totally', 'engaged', 'positive', 'plugged', 'person', 'point', 'belief', 'superhuman', 'effort', 'around', 'hooking', 'up', 'lovely', 'lady', 'who', 'traveled', 'town', 'What', 'else', 'romantic', 'love', 'change', 'western', 'man', 'trapped', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'course', 'remembers', 'not', 'single', 'thing', 'new', 'day', 'wonder', 'what', 'twisted', 'notions', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'mind', 'end', 'heart', 'finding', 'love', 'what', 'ultimately', 'finally', 'allowed', 'begin', 'new', 'day', 'day', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'now', 'town', 'stay', 'there', 'forever', 'changed', 'found', 'true', 'happiness', 'very', 'same', 'place', 'people', 'were', 'personal', 'hell', 'are', 'now', 'heaven', 'real', 'world', 'time', 'stops', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'countless', 'repeats', 'get', 'right', 'who', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'had', 'share', 'Groundhog', 'Days', 'just', 'sense', 'being', 'trapped', 'having', 'deal', 'same', 'stuff', 'day', 'day', 'day', 'why', 'movie', 'cord', 'super', 'friendly', 'overachiever', 'babe', 'Tony', 'Robinson', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'outdone', 'fable.GROUNDHOG', 'DAY', 'unique', 'movie', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'well', 'cast', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'gave', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'performance', 'only', 'way', 'avoid', 'real', 'life', 'Groundhog', 'Days', 'live', 'lot', 'more', 'even', 'not', 'having', 'lot', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'perfection', 'think', 'romantic', 'love', 'will', 'save', '..', 'TOO', 'Hollywood']",N/A

In it, Bill Murray plays a misanthropic weatherman who gets stuck in a time loop, and keeps on waking up every morning in Punxatawney Pennsylvania on February 2nd.  He is funny, but still basically a jerk (a funny jerk) for about the first half of the movie.  Eventually, it seems to start to sink in that he is in this little town for keeps, and he may as well appreciate what it has to offer, and what he might have to offer it.  Gradually, he starts to actually value life for the first time ever.  He learns to play a mean jazz piano; ice sculpting; auto mechanics; basic medical skills, etc. etc. etc.  He ends up &quot;getting the girl&quot; in the end, but that isn't exactly the point, I don't think.  First he has to learn to see what is beautiful or valuable in the world around him, as well as inside himself, and to act upon that understanding, before he is even seen as a human being by the people around him.

165688,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,080017948X,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[5, 22]","This film has been shown in Eastern Philosophy classes to put reincarnation in simple context.  Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience.  Nevertheless the pros outweigh the cons, one being a great vehicle for Bill Murray's improvisation.There is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world?  The only possible solution to this, considering noone else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory.  So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see.  So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world.  So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more.So how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd?  The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him.  In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives.  So what could account for Phil?  Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours.  The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish.  The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory.Now, I like the dialogue and find it funny, but one must admit some of it is strictly cheap laughs.  But as far as any overall ""moral message"" it gets lost in oversentimentality especially at the end.  The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use TRICKS to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell).  The first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizesthe TRICKS as to impress her beyond belief.  Remember that close to to last night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last ""perfect"" day.  On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so.  So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want.If the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a classic.  As it is it's a very good comedy...but it could have been so much more.",2,Good in spite of cheap laughs and oversentimentality,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2779,"['film', 'been', 'shown', 'Eastern', 'Philosophy', 'put', 'reincarnation', 'simple', 'context', 'more', 'profound', 'implications', 'scenario', 'were', 'unfortunately', 'scrapped', 'play', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'pros', 'outweigh', 'cons', 'one', 'being', 'great', 'vehicle', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'improvisation.There', 'least', 'one', 'implication', 'scenario', 'overlooked', 'almost', 'everyone', 'namely', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'same', 'day', 'then', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'only', 'possible', 'solution', 'considering', 'noone', 'else', 'living', 'know', 'many', 'worlds', 'theory', 'So', 'new', 'twist', 'day', 'new', 'scenario', 'course', 'played', 'out', 'universe', 'film', 'Phil', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'So', 'when', 'Phil', 'suicide', 'really', 'DOES', 'die', 'alternate', 'world', 'what', 'happening', 'obviously', 'MEMORIES', 'reliving', 'same', 'day', 'different', 'scenarios', 'keep', 'building', 'up', 'more', 'more.So', 'how', 'do', 'memories', 'get', 'transmuted', 'back', '6AM', 'February', '2nd', 'original', 'script', 'explained', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'casting', 'spell', 'reincarnation', 'theory', 'what', ""n't"", 'consciousness', 'memory', 'anecdotes', 'exist', 'who', 'recall', 'past', 'lives', 'what', 'could', 'account', 'Phil', 'Somehow', 'spell', 'would', 'have', 'stop', 'death', 'memory', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'remembering', 'future', '24', 'hours', 'remembers', 'OTHER', 'future', '24', 'hours', 'writer', 'estimated', '10', 'years', 'worth', 'original', 'script', 'called', '10,000', 'years', 'Feb.', '2s', 'can', 'imagine', 'would', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'hellish', 'fact', 'Phil', 'out', 'day', 'same', 'physically', 'only', 'thing', 'caught', 'time', 'loop', 'memory.Now', 'like', 'dialogue', 'find', 'funny', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'strictly', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'as', 'far', 'overall', 'moral', 'message', 'lost', 'oversentimentality', 'especially', 'end', 'message', 'suppose', 'be', 'must', 'keep', 'repeating', 'things', 'get', 'right', 'problem', 'way', 'Phil', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'YES', 'use', 'TRICKS', 'get', 'what', 'Rita', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'first', 'night', 'home', 'wise', 'last', 'so', 'utilizesthe', 'TRICKS', 'impress', 'belief', 'Remember', 'close', 'last', 'night', 'truth', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'NOT', 'last', 'perfect', 'day', 'day', 'basically', 'impressing', 'WITHOUT', 'telling', 'reason', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'actually', 'film', 'moral', 'reads', 'become', 'master', 'deceit', 'get', 'what', 'want.If', 'film', 'took', 'more', 'profound', 'path', 'instead', 'playing', 'mainstream', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more']",N/A

Harold Ramis's writing and directing skill. The cast of characters. The generous performances of Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot. And the amazing performance by Bill Murray. Decades from now this movie will be a classic for good reason. It's an original, intelligent, funny, and uplifting film.If that doesn't sell you, then buy this DVD because it has the extras. Harold Ramis provides much insight into the film by way of his audio commentary and his ""A Different Day"" interview.

165704,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,080017948X,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I happen to find Bill Murray utterly hysterical, when he's in the right movie.  If he is not in the right film I find him excruciating.  While I can't say that `Groundhog Day' is a completely realized concept (there was so much more that could have been done here) I can honestly say that Murray's transformation as Phil Connors is a completely realized performance.  He is quite possibly at his very best here (his `Lost in Translation' stint is still his finest work to date) and evokes enough human feeling to make Phil a very real, a very relatable and in the end a very honest portrait of the average American male.The film focuses on Phil, a weatherman for a Pittsburgh news station who has to travel to Punxatawney to cover Groundhog Day, when Punxatawney Phil comes out to see his shadow.  Phil is a cynical mess who loathes his life and his stagnant attitude towards those around him makes him somewhat of a bother.  No one wants him around and he doesn't really want anyone else around either.  When Phil, his producer Rita and their cameraman Larry find themselves trapped in Punxatawney during a blizzard it seems as though their trip couldn't get any worse, but for Phil it was just about to hit the fan.  Phil wakes up the next morning to find out that it is yesterday, Groundhog Day, yet again.Talk about Deja vu.What's worse is that the next morning it happens again; and again and again.  So what would you do if you could relive the same day over and over without any consequences or repercussions.  Phil at first begins to use it for his own selfish gain (learning about pretty women so as to seduce them) which only leads to his own self hatred and thus moves him to attempt unsuccessful suicides; but when Phil finally realizes that this could all serve to make him a better more fulfilled person things start to change and the cynical mess he used to be begins to strip itself away to reveal a kinder more human side to him.Really, `Groundhog Day' is about taking advantage of the chances we have for self improvement.  There are two types of selfishness; the malicious and self-congratulating kind that only leads to hurt feelings and loneliness; and then there is the kind that leads to self betterment and awareness.  Phil learns to differentiate between the two, becoming selfish for his own good; learning to love himself and thus become a better more fulfilled human being.Murray is phenomenal here, and he needs to be since he is in every scene practically and this he carries this entire film.  His comedic timing is priceless, but it is the warmth he brings to his character; the tragic realism he gives Phil that makes his so much more relatable.  I wish they had cast someone other than Andie MacDowell though.  I find her dreadfully boring most times, and here she fails to really make Rita someone we would fall in love with.  She pretty much plays the same character she did in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' except we see much more of her here, which strips away the mystery that surrounded her equally boring yet much more intriguing character in `Four Weddings' and leaves us with a dreadfully uninteresting creation.I do wish that this film had taken a different direction as far as genre is concerned, because it has all the makings for an intelligent adult character study, along the lines of say `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or even Murray's own `Lost in Translation'; but instead, targeting a younger audience, the film winds up feeling like a standard comedy a lot of the time, which takes away from the promise of the premise.  It isn't a bad film AT ALL, but there is potential here for a much deeper and much more meaningful film.  Regardless, it is still a film to see, and Murray gives an Oscar worthy performance as the man we all may end up being if we don't learn now how to find fulfillment.",4,Murray carries this film all the way to the finish line...,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,3855,"['happen', 'find', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'utterly', 'hysterical', 'when', 'right', 'movie', 'not', 'right', 'film', 'find', 'excruciating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'completely', 'realized', 'concept', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'here', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Murray', 'transformation', 'Phil', 'Connors', 'completely', 'realized', 'performance', 'quite', 'possibly', 'very', 'best', 'here', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'stint', 'still', 'finest', 'work', 'date', 'enough', 'human', 'feeling', 'make', 'Phil', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'relatable', 'end', 'very', 'honest', 'portrait', 'average', 'American', 'male.The', 'film', 'Phil', 'weatherman', 'Pittsburgh', 'news', 'station', 'who', 'travel', 'Punxatawney', 'cover', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'when', 'Punxatawney', 'Phil', 'out', 'see', 'shadow', 'Phil', 'cynical', 'mess', 'who', 'life', 'stagnant', 'attitude', 'towards', 'somewhat', 'bother', 'one', 'around', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'anyone', 'else', 'When', 'Phil', 'producer', 'Rita', 'cameraman', 'Larry', 'find', 'trapped', 'Punxatawney', 'blizzard', 'trip', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'Phil', 'was', 'just', 'hit', 'fan', 'Phil', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'find', 'out', 'yesterday', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'yet', 'again.Talk', 'Deja', 'vu.What', 'worse', 'next', 'morning', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'could', 'relive', 'same', 'day', 'consequences', 'repercussions', 'Phil', 'first', 'begins', 'use', 'own', 'selfish', 'gain', 'learning', 'pretty', 'women', 'so', 'seduce', 'only', 'own', 'self', 'hatred', 'thus', 'attempt', 'unsuccessful', 'suicides', 'when', 'Phil', 'finally', 'could', 'serve', 'make', 'better', 'more', 'fulfilled', 'person', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'cynical', 'mess', 'used', 'be', 'begins', 'strip', 'away', 'reveal', 'kinder', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'him.Really', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'taking', 'advantage', 'chances', 'have', 'self', 'improvement', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'selfishness', 'malicious', 'self-congratulating', 'kind', 'only', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'loneliness', 'then', 'kind', 'self', 'betterment', 'awareness', 'Phil', 'differentiate', 'two', 'becoming', 'selfish', 'own', 'good', 'learning', 'love', 'thus', 'become', 'better', 'more', 'fulfilled', 'human', 'being.Murray', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'be', 'scene', 'practically', 'entire', 'film', 'comedic', 'timing', 'priceless', 'warmth', 'character', 'tragic', 'realism', 'Phil', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'relatable', 'wish', 'had', 'cast', 'someone', 'other', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'find', 'dreadfully', 'boring', 'most', 'times', 'here', 'really', 'make', 'Rita', 'someone', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'character', 'did', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'away', 'mystery', 'surrounded', 'equally', 'boring', 'yet', 'much', 'more', 'intriguing', 'character', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'dreadfully', 'uninteresting', 'creation.I', 'do', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'taken', 'different', 'direction', 'as', 'far', 'genre', 'concerned', 'makings', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'character', 'study', 'lines', 'say', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'even', 'Murray', 'own', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'instead', 'targeting', 'younger', 'audience', 'film', 'up', 'feeling', 'standard', 'comedy', 'lot', 'time', 'away', 'promise', 'premise', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'AT', 'ALL', 'potential', 'here', 'much', 'deeper', 'much', 'more', 'meaningful', 'film', 'Regardless', 'still', 'film', 'see', 'Murray', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'man', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'now', 'how', 'find', 'fulfillment']",N/A

It stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a weatherman with Channel 9 Pittsburgh, and Andie MacDowell, who plays Rita his new producer.It starts off on February 1st, with them plus the cameraman travelling to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania &quot;The home of the Groundhog&quot; for the Annual Groundhog day celebrations, which is the next day, 2nd Feb. The Groundhog, its believed, is supposed to predict the end of winter by seeing or not seeing his shadow. The groundhog looks like a beaver by the way and rather cute.He absolutely hates going to Punxsutawney to cover this festival and he makes his feelings about this pretty clear, he actually says to the guest house owner that his chances of departure today are 100% because there is no way he wants to spend a minute more than he has to in this backwater, as he calls it.On there way out of town, after filming the Groundhog being lifted out of the ground. They get caught in a blizzard and have to turn back, much to Phil's reluctance. So he has to stay another night in the place that he has become to loathe.Then his bedside alarm goes off at the same time as the previous day and much to Phil's annoyance he thinks that the radio station are playing yesterday's tape until he looks out the window and sees no traces of snow whatsoever.He is stuck in a time warp!Anyway I won't go into too much detail as I don't want to spoil this film for those of you that haven't been fortunate to watch it. The main part of the film concentrates on Phil Connors reliving Groundhog Day over and over again.At first he is bored by this and doesn't understand what is happening then he decides that his life is definitely not worth living any more and tries to commit suicide, he also tries to manipulate people and he pretends to know this woman that he takes a fancy too. He also watches when security guards turn there back on some money and pinches it right from under there noses. He even gets arrested after driving on the railroad track drunk. All these things don't have any effect on Phil Connors as he wakes up the same every morning.He even tries to go out with Rita, his producer and doesn't succeed at first. She thinks he is crazy and playing tricks on her.

The film has its own place in pop culture and is always included in a discussion of great comedy films. Groundhog Day, featuring Bill Murray in his prime, is about Phil Connors, a cocky arrogant weatherman, that travels to watch the yearly ritual of the groundhog, his shadow, and the coming of spring. Phil brings along his photographer, Larry (Chris Elliot), and his producer Rita (Andie McDowell). They are both subject to Phil's selfish actions throughout the day.Then, Phil wakes up to the same music as the day before. He soon realizes everything is the same. He is reliving Groundhog Day again. By now, even if you've never seen the movie, you know what the plot is. Yet, you are in for a great surprise. Phil relives Groundhog Day hundreds of times, and each time, Rita, Larry and the townspeople are living the day as if it is their first.Phil goes through several stages, from cynical amusement at the prospects of living the day over, to using his knowledge to take advantage of strangers, to total despair at the prospects of stuck in the endless loop of time. Eventually, Phil changes in a heartwarming way and the movie ends happily.This kind of movie would never be made today. Its pace is slow and deliberate, yet full of laughs.

Why? Because you knew how it's gonna end (obviously, it's a romantic comedy), but you didn't know WHEN! and believe me, you don't want it to end...Worth noticing is also the fact that movie sparks genuine feelings for the characters (even sporadic ones), otherwise absent from other Harold Ramis/Ivan Reitman/Bill Murray/Dan Aykroyd movies. The quartet (working together or not) mostly have interesting ideas how to amuse people and make them laugh, but they often fail to make us care for the characters involved.For those of you from other planets, the plot involves a conceited weatherman (Murray) stuck in time on the worst day of his life. So he has to live the day again and again (see the title) until... Well, you know. Not even death can stop his misery.

Boy, did I want to like this Collectors' Edition DVD, but sadly, I must announce that it's a let-down.  I'm talking about this edition, not the film itself, which other reviewers have adequately discussed.One thing you should be warned about: the extra features that come with this DVD, such as the documentary, ""The Weight of Time,"" and the ""director's running commentary"" option ... blow.The documentary was filmed just last year (2001), and many of the characters and crew don't seem to remember much about the movie, except in general terms. Bill Murray himself doesn't deign to make an appearance, even though it is frequently alleged that this film represents the best work of his now-defunct career. And this is NOT the ""Making of Groundhog Day"" documentary that ran on HBO when that network released the film; I have no idea where to get that well-made and amusing documentary, but be warned that THIS is not it.You weren't missing anything from the anamorphic thing. The anamorphic was not 1.35:1, but only 1.85:1, meaning that if you've been watching this on a normal TV and VCR combination, you haven't been missing much. It's not the revelatory experience some DVD's are.Another thing that annoyed me to no end:  many of the scenes that were not included in the final cut of the movie do not find their way onto this Collectors' Edition DVD as deleted scenes.  Why not?  Their existence is certain:  you can hear Harold Ramis mention several of them on his commentary track.  Among the scenes I would have liked to see:  Bill Murray trashing his room (instead of merely breaking the pencil in half), and him presiding over a Fellini-esque bacchanal of freaks and cripples in his room at Mrs. Lancaster's!  For uber-fans of the film, it is immensely disappointing that these scenes were not included, since it is difficult to see how we will ever get to see them now.As for Ramis's commentary, it is lazy and uninteresting. There are a few moments when he shares information that you otherwise wouldn't have known (unless you've seen that HBO documentary), but for the most part his monologue is characterized by simply telling us what's going to happen, explaining what's fully obvious, echoing the lines of the characters, or simply leaving us with long periods of silence.I expect nothing but non-stop talking when directors do their commentaries. And friend and I were watching this, and we both FORGOT that we were watching it with the director's commentary. ""Talk, screwball!"" we both shouted. One shouldn't be able to get into the movie with this option on, but here his comments were either so sparse or perfunctory that we found ourselves able to.My rating for the movie itself couldn't be higher.

165738,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,080017948X,Carl Malmstrom,"[29, 32]","""Groundhog Day"" is a movie that's aged really well in the past nine years, and I think will be looked back on as a classic comedy in a few decades.  Using a relatively simple plot device (Bill Murray's arrogant, pesudocosmpolitan character living the same day over and over in a small Midwestern town), Harold Ramis created a silly, sweet, touching romantic comedy that is endlessly rewatchable.That said, though, I would've expected a great deal more from a 'Special Edition' of such a well-loved movie.  The main differences between this release and the original DVD release of a few years ago are the addition of a commentary track by Harold Ramis and a half-hour or so behind-the-scenes documentary.  The menus are also now animated and there are a few filmographies and trailers for other movies added, but these hardly help with the ""Special Edition"" status the disc is given.  The commentary track gives some interesting info on the movie, but Ramis spends a lot of time talking about the background actors and eventually wears a bit thin on the anecdotes.  If they could have gotten Bill Murray or Chris Elliott (or even Stephen Tobolowsky) to do the commentary track with him, it would've covered over a lot of the silences and helped with the narrative style, which Ramis keeps very light.  Nonetheless, Ramis's fondness for the movie comes out quite cleary, and he's still fun to listen to.  The documentary falls a bit flat in that in covers much of the same ground as the commentary track.  Save the few behind-the-scenes photos and outtakes, there's little there that Ramis doesn't discuss in his commentary.

Middleton,"[11, 12]","Bill Murray's, (since his tenure on SNL) acting career has moved from good to the astounding, a great stand-up in his own right, the actor has pushed his own boundaries, and in the early days, taking on projects way beyond his talent, i.e., The Razors Edge, however, as the years move on, the man continues to entertain us with his particular style of humour.Most of his eighties films, Stripes, Ghostbusters, et al, are truly funny films, even after twenty years since their initial release, they continue, no matter how many times you've seen them, bring out at least a chuckle. All are hilarious, but Groundhog Day (1993) stands out because it touches on themes that matter: love, kindness, selfishness, selflessness; a sense of community and, for the most part, the value of living in the moment, that is, the life long mission of improving self and those around us.In the end, though, it is about reaching one's full potential, examining one self, and living an authentic life.Taking this even further, at the risk of sounding too sentimental, Groundhog Day is a Romantic comedy with a twist.The story is about a cynical Phil Connors, a weather man who has seen it all before, arrogant, self absorbed and a little nasty. After his first day in Puxatawny, he awakes to a Nietzschean nightmare, the notion of eternal occurrence, where our existence is a circle, repeating the same situations, meeting the same people, experiencing similar events forever until finally, perhaps, the merry-go-round stops and you're allowed to get off.But how do we stop the merry-go-round, the endless same life lessons, hitting us in the face, over and over again?Well, really, according to Groundhog Day, the solution is authenticity and love.It is only when Phil realizes who he actually is, following Plato's suggestion, ""Know thy Self"", and pursues his true aspirations and the one he truly loves, that the merry-go-round-stops, and life becomes truly worth living.Groundhog Day is my favourite Murray film because the script, story and direction was created for him and he rose to the occasion, making this film one of the greatest Romantic comedies in the last twenty years.",5,Murray's Best Film of the Nineties,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,2166,"['Bill', 'Murray', 'tenure', 'SNL', 'acting', 'career', 'moved', 'good', 'astounding', 'great', 'stand-up', 'own', 'right', 'actor', 'pushed', 'own', 'boundaries', 'early', 'days', 'taking', 'projects', 'way', 'talent', 'i.e.', 'Razors', 'Edge', 'however', 'years', 'move', 'man', 'entertain', 'particular', 'style', 'humour.Most', 'eighties', 'films', 'Stripes', 'Ghostbusters', 'et', 'al', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'films', 'even', 'twenty', 'years', 'initial', 'release', 'continue', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bring', 'out', 'least', 'chuckle', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Groundhog', 'Day', '1993', 'out', 'themes', 'matter', 'love', 'kindness', 'selfishness', 'selflessness', 'sense', 'community', 'most', 'part', 'value', 'living', 'moment', 'life', 'long', 'mission', 'improving', 'self', 'us.In', 'end', 'reaching', 'one', 'full', 'potential', 'examining', 'one', 'self', 'living', 'authentic', 'life.Taking', 'even', 'further', 'risk', 'sounding', 'too', 'sentimental', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Romantic', 'comedy', 'twist.The', 'story', 'cynical', 'Phil', 'Connors', 'weather', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'arrogant', 'self', 'absorbed', 'little', 'nasty', 'first', 'day', 'Puxatawny', 'Nietzschean', 'nightmare', 'notion', 'eternal', 'occurrence', 'where', 'existence', 'circle', 'repeating', 'same', 'situations', 'meeting', 'same', 'people', 'experiencing', 'similar', 'events', 'forever', 'finally', 'perhaps', 'merry-go-round', 'stops', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'get', 'off.But', 'how', 'do', 'stop', 'merry-go-round', 'endless', 'same', 'life', 'lessons', 'hitting', 'face', 'over', 'again', 'Well', 'really', 'according', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'solution', 'authenticity', 'love.It', 'only', 'when', 'Phil', 'who', 'actually', 'following', 'Plato', 'suggestion', 'Know', 'Self', 'true', 'aspirations', 'one', 'loves', 'merry-go-round-stops', 'life', 'becomes', 'truly', 'worth', 'living.Groundhog', 'Day', 'favourite', 'Murray', 'film', 'script', 'story', 'direction', 'was', 'created', 'rose', 'occasion', 'making', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'Romantic', 'comedies', 'last', 'twenty', 'years']",N/A

A friend finally convinced me that they were the bank guards.The movie is too long, but maybe that is the point.I like to find the moment that makes the unbelievable believable and I think it is when Phil is hit on the head with a shovel.

However, I didn't think that much of it; until I realized later that it stayed with me in a way unusual for most broad comedies.The plot is simple: a Pittsburgh weatherman reports on the appearance of ""Punxstaney Phil"" on Groundhog Day and gets stuck in the day. Really stuck-as in he keeps living the day over and over again. He wakes up to the same bad music (Sonny and Cher), runs into the same annoying high school friend, meets up with his perky, lovely producer and cynical cameraman (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot), and sees the groundhog come out again and again. For the others, the day is new and fresh each time. For our hero, it is same old, same old. Eventually, he begins to realize he can ""work"" with the situation (e.g., freak people out by knowing what will happen, do outrageous things with no consequence).Bill Murray's deadpan, slightly improvisational style works beautifully in this role. Andie MacDowell isn't asked to do much more than be sweet and beautiful-and that's not too hard for her.The DVD added so much to my appreciation of the movie. The director Harold Ramis has a most insightful track over the film. I was very interested to learn that the movie had Zen overtones (one man lives 10,000 days) as well as modeling its structure on the five stages of grief. Whoa.I would recommend this movie to individuals who enjoy the big, broad comedies from the 80's and 90's (e.g., Ghostbusters, Stripes).

Phil Connors is an egotistic, sarcastic prima donna weatherman for Pittsburgh station WPBH who's sent with producer Rita and cameraman Larry to cover the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney.  There's no love lost between the trio, as Rita and Chris don't care too much for their conceited colleague.  And yep, it's six more weeks of winter according to Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog. Unfortunately, a blizzard that he did not foretell in his own forecast makes chances for departure back to Pittsburgh 0%.  The next day, at 6:00 AM, it's no... not 3 February, but Groundhog Day once again!  Connors becomes stuck in a weird timewarp where everyday is Groundhog Day.  Nothing can happen to him, and every day starts anew for the folksy people of Punxsutawney, but he remembers everything else that happened the day before.The rest of the movie is variations on a theme--how Phil spends the day trying to figure out his predicament and how he interracts with certain people on different Groundhog Days.  There's Ned Ryerson, a nerdy former classmate who tries to sell Phil life insurance, a hefty fellow lodger Connors encounters as he leaves his room, and an elderly bum on a street corner, which later turns out to be one of the most poignant scenes.  Surprisingly, repeated segments don't detract from the movie.The main point of this comedy is that the attitude we emanate is what makes one attractive or endearing to people.  It also states that the choices we make affects everyone else for better or worse, and how to be the best we can be so others respond in a positive way or how simple kind words can make a person's day.  Connors exudes nothing but a bad attitude from the beginning.  He makes chauvinistic remarks to Rita, and in one of his broadcasts, refers to his namesake as an overgrown squirrel.Rita is the catalyst here.  Phil's attracted to her and tries whatever he can to score with her, by finding out her favourite drink, what she studied before her journalistic career, but it's when he actually comes to her for help after she's touched by his truly beautiful weather report that he realizes how nice a person that he turns over a new leaf.  He learns detachment and emanating a positive aura that makes others attracted to him instead of trying to focus on a single person.This is one of Bill Murray's best movies, as his character goes from obnoxious jerk to someone who emanates so much positive energy that he's the most popular guy around.  Andie McDowell shines as Rita, with those crinkly eyes and sweet smile making her even more endearing than in Four Weddings And A Funeral.  And director Harold Ramis, Murray's costar in Stripes and the two Ghostbusters movies, has a brief scene as the local neurologist.  Chris Elliott (Larry) has the funniest word in the movie when MacDowell asks him why Murray would kidnap a groundhog.

165776,A2OVUDBRWGX0LL,080017948X,David,"[6, 7]","First of all, let me say that I've never been a big fan of Bill Murray.  While he can be funny at times, his humor seems to be rather pretentious and unsophisticated.I rented this movie one night on a lark.  To say that I was pleasantly suprised would be an understatement.  Finally, there exists a film in which Murray culls some of his comedic excesses for the purpose of making a movie that can appeal to moviegoers of all ages.The plot employs a device similar to the one in &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; or even &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot;  Playing a small-city TV newscaster forever in search of a bigger and better broadcasting gig, the obnoxious, shallow, and self-absorbed Murray is sent to cover Groundhog Day in Puxatawny, Pennsylvania.  Murray is then inexplicably forced to relive the day over and over again.  At first, Murray lives in denial at his circumstances, but his shallowness quickly adapts to the situation as he tries to take advantage of his guilded cage.  He uses the carryover of knowledge and experiences gained from his reliving of Groundhog Day to rob an armored car, seduce a woman by learning all about her and then pretending to be an old forgotten friend in a 'later' Groundhog Day, and behave increasingly like an uncouthe idiot during his repeated broadcasts of Puxatawny Phil's (the name of the groundhog) appearance.  He knows that regardless of whatever offense he commits, he will emerge unscathed because the day will simply end and be repeated.However, even someone as shallow as Murray's character begins to learn that his 'victories' are fleeting and ultimately unfulfilling.  This emptiness drives him to the point of madness and he eventually tries to kill himself (several times).  He actually succeeds each time, but reawakens in the same hotel bed every morning to the tune of the same Sonny and Cher song, &quot;I've Got You, Babe,&quot; on the radio.Finally, Murray realizes that perhaps he would be better off putting the time to better use.  He learns to play the piano (going from beginner to an accomplished player in who knows how many Groundhog Days), reads books on philosophy, takes up ice sculpting, and actually tries to get to know and help the people in the small town around him without the intent of taking advantage of them.Only then is he finally released from his prison.Murray's transformation from scoundrel to all-around good guy is done very well, and there are some genuinely moving moments in the movie--such as when, despite his repeated best efforts, he fails to save the life of a homeless elderly man that he knows is destined to die.  It is in these scenes that Murray shows he does have the ability to handle an acting role that requires him to be sincere and serious in a convincing manner.The supporting cast is excellent, including Andie McDowell and Chris Elliot--both of whom don't know what to make of Murray's sudden conversion (which, from their perspective, occurs in only one day).Highly recommended.

This is saying a lot, since typically I watch a movie and within days I've forgotten most of what was in the movie. For me, this is Murray's defining movie, funny and humorous, and yet poignant with an important message (one that is shown rather than preached).Murray plays the part of a cynical, arrogant Pittsburgh television reporter who is given the assignment of reporting from Punxsutawney, PA on Groundhog Day. He is accompanied by his technician (played by Andie MacDowell), who, as a caring, feeling woman is Murray's opposite. Because he does everything so wrong the first time around, he is consigned to relive Groundhog Day until he gets it right. The movie then takes us through several reincarnations of the day, during which many of the external events are the same, but in which Murray's character gradually changes in his reaction to the events and encounters of the day. Finally, the arrogance and cynicism stripped away, Murray goes through a Groundhog Day when he finally gets it right. The next morning, when his alarm sounds at the bed and breakfast where he has been saying, and he looks out the window, he realizes that it is no longer Groundhog Day. He also knows that he is a changed person.This is a great movie not only because Murray is at his best as an actor, but also because of Andie MacDowell's performance. She too does a stellar job of someone who abhors Murray's cynicism but who also sees the good in him and is willing to go with him through several relivings of the day until he gets it right. The chemistry between them is excellent. The touching scene of the two of them in the bedroom of the B&B; on the night of the last Groundhog Day go-round is especially touching and poignant.",5,Murray at his best,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1821,"['have', 'watched', 'several', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'movies', 'only', 'one', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'saying', 'lot', 'typically', 'watch', 'movie', 'days', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'most', 'what', 'was', 'movie', 'Murray', 'defining', 'movie', 'funny', 'humorous', 'yet', 'poignant', 'important', 'message', 'one', 'shown', 'rather', 'preached', '.Murray', 'part', 'cynical', 'arrogant', 'Pittsburgh', 'television', 'reporter', 'who', 'given', 'assignment', 'reporting', 'Punxsutawney', 'PA', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'accompanied', 'technician', 'played', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'who', 'caring', 'feeling', 'woman', 'Murray', 'opposite', 'everything', 'so', 'wrong', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'consigned', 'relive', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'right', 'movie', 'then', 'several', 'reincarnations', 'day', 'many', 'external', 'events', 'are', 'same', 'Murray', 'character', 'gradually', 'reaction', 'events', 'encounters', 'day', 'Finally', 'arrogance', 'cynicism', 'stripped', 'away', 'Murray', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'when', 'finally', 'right', 'next', 'morning', 'when', 'alarm', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'where', 'been', 'saying', 'out', 'window', 'no', 'longer', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'also', 'changed', 'person.This', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Murray', 'best', 'actor', 'also', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'performance', 'too', 'stellar', 'job', 'someone', 'who', 'Murray', 'cynicism', 'who', 'also', 'good', 'willing', 'go', 'several', 'relivings', 'day', 'right', 'chemistry', 'excellent', 'touching', 'scene', 'two', 'bedroom', 'B', 'B', 'night', 'last', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'go-round', 'especially', 'touching', 'poignant']",N/A

Spike Lee's  MO' BETTER BLUES and Bridges and Williams in THE FISHER KING- and of  course, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE- are three others.

He is a weatherman based in Pittsburgh, whose sarcasm, egotism, and cynicism repel most of the people he meets.  He is on assignment for the fourth year in a row, covering another Phil--Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who every year, on February 2, prognosticates how long winter will last.  Along with Connors are his producer, Rita, played by the lovely Andie MacDowell, and his long-suffering and much abused cameraman, Larry, played hilariously by Chris Elliott.Phil hates the groundhog, whom he calls a rat, he hates the people of Punxsutawney, whom he considers little more than boring hicks, and he hates people who are warm and sensitive.  Phil is counting the seconds until he can leave this miserable town and get back to the big city.  Little does he know that a quirky act of fate will doom him to relive February 2nd, over and over and over again, until he gets it right.Bill Murray is comic perfection as the cranky and impatient Phil, a person who could not stop and smell the roses if his life depended on it.  Thanks to a brilliant screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis, who also directed, Murray has ample opportunity to show off his impeccable timing and priceless facial expressions.  Whether he is greeting his unctuous landlady at his bed and breakfast, trying to fend off a pushy old classmate, or smoothly convincing a gullible woman that he loves her, Murray nails this self-absorbed and misanthropic character.The look of epiphany on Phil's face when he realizes that he can do whatever he wants with no repercussions is unforgettable.  Since he is doomed to live the same day over and over again, he can hit on women endlessly, spend money like water, and eat as many cholesterol-laden desserts as his heart desires.  Soon, however, the novelty wears off, and Phil begins to realize that the same-old, same-old is no longer bearable.  To move his life past Groundhog Day, he will have to change inside, where it counts.If you want to laugh until you cry, see &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; a film that is destined to become a comedy classic.",5,Comic perfection.,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,2109,"['Phil', 'Connors', 'real', 'piece', 'work', 'weatherman', 'based', 'Pittsburgh', 'sarcasm', 'egotism', 'cynicism', 'repel', 'most', 'people', 'assignment', 'fourth', 'year', 'row', 'covering', 'Phil', 'Punxsutawney', 'Phil', 'groundhog', 'who', 'year', 'February', '2', 'how', 'long', 'winter', 'will', 'last', 'Connors', 'are', 'producer', 'Rita', 'played', 'lovely', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'long-suffering', 'much', 'abused', 'cameraman', 'Larry', 'played', 'hilariously', 'Chris', 'Elliott.Phil', 'groundhog', 'whom', 'rat', 'people', 'Punxsutawney', 'whom', 'little', 'more', 'boring', 'hicks', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'warm', 'sensitive', 'Phil', 'counting', 'seconds', 'can', 'leave', 'miserable', 'town', 'get', 'back', 'big', 'city', 'Little', 'know', 'quirky', 'act', 'fate', 'will', 'doom', 'relive', 'February', '2nd', 'over', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'right.Bill', 'Murray', 'comic', 'perfection', 'cranky', 'impatient', 'Phil', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'smell', 'roses', 'life', 'depended', 'Thanks', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'Danny', 'Rubin', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Murray', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'show', 'off', 'impeccable', 'timing', 'priceless', 'facial', 'expressions', 'greeting', 'unctuous', 'landlady', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'trying', 'fend', 'off', 'pushy', 'old', 'classmate', 'smoothly', 'convincing', 'gullible', 'woman', 'Murray', 'self-absorbed', 'character.The', 'look', 'epiphany', 'Phil', 'face', 'when', 'can', 'do', 'whatever', 'repercussions', 'unforgettable', 'doomed', 'live', 'same', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'can', 'hit', 'women', 'endlessly', 'spend', 'money', 'water', 'eat', 'many', 'cholesterol-laden', 'desserts', 'heart', 'Soon', 'however', 'novelty', 'Phil', 'realize', 'same-old', 'same-old', 'longer', 'bearable', 'move', 'life', 'past', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'will', 'have', 'change', 'inside', 'where', 'want', 'laugh', 'cry', 'see', 'quot', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'quot', 'film', 'destined', 'become', 'comedy', 'classic']",N/A

165798,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,080017948X,Endless Kitchen,"[0, 0]","Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a selfish and cynical weatherman sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for a fluff piece about Groundhog Day. He is boorish, as always, to his pretty producer Rita (Andie MacDowell), cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and all the local people he meets. When an unexpected snowstorm hits, something very strange happens. Everyone is acting as if February 3rd is Groundhog Day. As it turns out, Phil is living the same day over and over again.Groundhog Day is an celluloid example of a grand idea with magnificent execution. This film manages to capture real life cynicism and, its frequent companion and twin, hope with charm and elan. Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy with actual entertainment, romance and comedy as well as a covertly profound and sagacious reflection on life. It all begins with the clever premise. It is not the first time warp story nor heartwarming piece of magical realism. Still, taking an obscure semi-holiday and tying it in with a man facing an inexplicable purgatory in a pleasant, if banal, little town is a fascinating premise and this is just the starting point for the script. The protagonist, Phil Connors has the bright, pop-culture infused snark of the typical  Bill Murray character but he is a rather malevolent jerk. Once he finds himself in this bizarre predicament, there are some well-planned and very clever situational humor as he becomes semi-immortal. Murray's performance in Groundhog Day is fantastic. He combines physical humor with the tragedy and comedy this story requires. In recent years, Murray has deservedly received more credit and acclaim as a thespian with films like Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers and Moonrise Kingdom, but I would assert that this was his cinematic bravura. Bill Murray as Phil Connors is reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin.Stephen Tobolowsky is great as a gadfly insurance salesman who frequently bumps into Phil as he follows the same pattern every single day. MacDowell is charming as the idealistic, playfully demure woman Phil pines for. Phil can learn about her and try to condition himself as a perfect match with each passing/repeated day. This provides for a funny scene where he learns her favorite drink, then the next day what she toasts to and why, and so on.

However, when Phil wakes up the next morning, at 6:00, the day has restarted itself.  The snow never fell.  They never left.  It never made it to tomorrow.  What ensues is a hilarious string of events where he attempts to buck himself out of today and into tomorrow.Bill Murray plays a great sarcastic role, while Andie MacDowell plays her part over and over again with those key minor changes to Phil's behavior with a convincing ease.

It's time travel back to the same day.  It's all done very humorously.  Yet as you peel away the layers, and look deeper there is a profound message to be discovered.Have you ever felt stuck in your life, and no matter what you do, it does not seem to make any difference. You get frustrated, desperate, even depressed.  Then you make a decision to solve the problem no matter what.  This movie is a metaphor for self improvement.  Phil's journey is our journey.So, we see the journey this character takes from cynical, sarcastic and negative, and self absorbed, and not likable.  Then he is presented with the same situations over and over and is forced to adapt, or be forever stuck.Some of the lessons here include: you create your own experiences, so when you change your perceptions you change your reality, the transforming power of true love, all change comes from within.  When you change your view of the world from being cynical selfish, and exploitive to truly loving and compassionate, the world responds to that change, and so do people.The character does play with the day on a surface level at first, and eventually improves how the day goes, although he has certain aspects under control, other issues such as how to seduce the Andie McDowell character remain elusive, because his motives are transparent.

Of Course, he has also kidnapped a groundhog, but that was just a phase.  In the end, he masters his reality, and is ready to move on.You will think about it for a long time afterwards.

165813,A2BPDFR58H9575,080017948X,Galina,"[4, 4]","In Harold Ramis's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude.I love this movie - not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away - they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing?Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing.4.5/5",4,"When the gods wish to punish us...,",1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,1242,"['Harold', 'Ramis', 'Groundhog', 'Day', '1993', 'intriguing', 'comedy', 'repeating', 'past', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Phil', 'Connors', 'arrogantly', 'self-centered', 'cynical', 'TV', 'weatherman', 'sent', 'fifth', 'time', 'small', 'town', 'Punxsutawney', 'PA', 'cover', 'Groundhog', 'ceremony', 'held', 'February', '2nd', 'time', 'warp', 'up', 'repeating', 'same', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'forced', 'look', 'distance', 'examine', 'attitude.I', 'love', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'original', 'clever', 'funniest', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'think', 'serious', 'questions', 'instance', 'when', 'Gods', 'want', 'punish', 'mean', 'arrogant', 'SOB', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'sanity', 'away', 'will', 'make', 'whole', 'world', 'mad', 'let', 'deal', 'situation', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'have', 'eternity', 'hands', 'curse', 'blessing', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'not', 'reuse', 'tired', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'humor', 'situations', 'characters', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Phil', 'Connors', 'movie', 'talent', 'comedian', 'fullest', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'role', 'Murray', 'ever', 'played', 'character', 'gone', 'transformation', 'eyes', 'was', 'very', 'convincing.4.5/5']",N/A

165818,A969VLBBX8LQ7,080017948X,George McAdams,"[5, 8]","If ever there was a movie designed for DVD, it's ""Groundhog Day.""  By repeating scenes, pausing the picture, even comparing portions of the movie to other parts, you get a sense that the movie is put together wonderfully.  Unfortunately, the additional features of this ""Special Edition"" do little to enhance the enjoyment of the movie.  The documentary, shot last year, is too little too late.  A ""making of"" PR movie from HBO or E! would have been more enjoyable.  The comments from director Harold Ramis fail to educate.  If you don't have the movie already, buy this one; however, if you already have the basic DVD that came out in 1997, save your money.This review is an update to a previous review of this movie that follows:While most viewers try to catch the number of times the scenes repeat themselves, this modern (within the last ten years) movie contains one of the classic scenes that can actually enrich ones life.In ""Groundhog Day,"" weatherman Phil Conners, played by actor Bill Murray, is locked in a time warp in which he seems destined to relive Groundhog Day, February 2nd, over and over again. The classic scene occurs after midnight, but before the bewitching hour of 6:00 A.M. when the day begins repeating itself, on a day when Phil has succeeded in convincing Rita, his producer, played by Annie MacDowell, that he is truly reliving this one day, again and again. As they lay platonically in bed, with Rita falling asleep, he begins to tell her what he should have told her the first time that he saw her, instead of being so self-absorbed that he couldn't see what she really was like (""I think what I wanted to say was I think you are the kindest, sweetest, prettiest person I've ever met in my life. The first time I saw you, something happened to me that I never told you, but I wanted to hold you as hard as I could. I don't deserve someone like you, but if I ever could, I'm sure I would love you for the rest of my life"").He awakes the next morning, without Rita by his side, but with a a new persona. Perhaps this change is because he was spurred on by Rita who told him the evening before, ""Maybe it's not a curse (referring to his reliving this day over and over), it's just how you look at it."" Suddenly, forgotten are the days when Phil used his endless life to temp fate by living his life through the seven deadly sins, as he finds the joy of living each day to its fullest, learning to expand his purpose in life through helping others. Finally, he lives a Groundhog Day in which he becomes something of a local hero to many in the community, and Rita, realizing his inner beauty, buys his services at the bachelor charity auction. That night, they platonically fall asleep, again, with the true realization of each other's stellar inner qualities, and instead of waking-up on February 2nd, it's February 3rd. Together they begin to plan a life together with the realization that there is something more after today.Phil's final characterization of life can be depicted in the words he uses to describe the Groundhog Festival near the end of the movie. ""When Checkov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and beraf of hope, but we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. But, standing here among the people of Punxsutawney, and basking here in the warmth of their hearts, I couldn't imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter.""",4,"Good Movie...""Special Edition"" needs Something ""SPECIAL""",1015632000,"03 9, 2002",2002,3412,"['ever', 'was', 'movie', 'designed', 'DVD', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'repeating', 'scenes', 'pausing', 'picture', 'even', 'comparing', 'portions', 'movie', 'other', 'parts', 'get', 'sense', 'movie', 'put', 'together', 'wonderfully', 'Unfortunately', 'additional', 'features', 'Special', 'Edition', 'do', 'little', 'enhance', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'documentary', 'shot', 'last', 'year', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'making', 'PR', 'movie', 'HBO', 'E', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'comments', 'director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'fail', 'educate', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'already', 'buy', 'one', 'however', 'already', 'have', 'basic', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'save', 'money.This', 'review', 'update', 'previous', 'review', 'movie', 'most', 'viewers', 'try', 'catch', 'number', 'times', 'scenes', 'repeat', 'modern', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'movie', 'one', 'classic', 'scenes', 'can', 'actually', 'enrich', 'ones', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'weatherman', 'Phil', 'Conners', 'played', 'actor', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'locked', 'time', 'warp', 'destined', 'relive', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'February', '2nd', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'classic', 'scene', 'midnight', 'bewitching', 'hour', '6:00', 'A.M.', 'when', 'day', 'repeating', 'day', 'when', 'Phil', 'succeeded', 'convincing', 'Rita', 'producer', 'played', 'Annie', 'MacDowell', 'truly', 'reliving', 'one', 'day', 'again', 'again', 'lay', 'platonically', 'bed', 'Rita', 'falling', 'asleep', 'tell', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'instead', 'being', 'so', 'self-absorbed', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'think', 'what', 'wanted', 'say', 'was', 'think', 'are', 'kindest', 'sweetest', 'prettiest', 'person', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'met', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'something', 'happened', 'never', 'told', 'wanted', 'hold', 'as', 'hard', 'could', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'someone', 'ever', 'could', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'love', 'rest', 'life', 'next', 'morning', 'Rita', 'side', 'new', 'persona', 'Perhaps', 'change', 'was', 'spurred', 'Rita', 'who', 'told', 'evening', 'Maybe', 'not', 'curse', 'referring', 'reliving', 'day', 'just', 'how', 'look', 'Suddenly', 'forgotten', 'are', 'days', 'when', 'Phil', 'used', 'endless', 'life', 'temp', 'fate', 'living', 'life', 'seven', 'deadly', 'sins', 'joy', 'living', 'day', 'fullest', 'learning', 'expand', 'purpose', 'life', 'helping', 'others', 'Finally', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'something', 'local', 'hero', 'many', 'community', 'Rita', 'realizing', 'inner', 'beauty', 'services', 'bachelor', 'charity', 'auction', 'night', 'platonically', 'fall', 'asleep', 'again', 'true', 'realization', 'other', 'stellar', 'inner', 'qualities', 'instead', 'waking-up', 'February', '2nd', 'February', '3rd', 'Together', 'begin', 'plan', 'life', 'together', 'realization', 'something', 'more', 'today.Phil', 'final', 'characterization', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'depicted', 'words', 'describe', 'Groundhog', 'Festival', 'end', 'movie', 'When', 'Checkov', 'saw', 'long', 'winter', 'saw', 'winter', 'bleak', 'dark', 'beraf', 'hope', 'know', 'winter', 'just', 'step', 'cycle', 'life', 'standing', 'here', 'people', 'Punxsutawney', 'basking', 'here', 'warmth', 'hearts', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'better', 'fate', 'long', 'lustrous', 'winter']",N/A

165822,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,080017948X,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[3, 15]","In 1993 , director Harold Ramis genius of dark comedies like ''Analyze This'' casted Bill Murray as Phil Connors in this dark but mostly enjoyable movie named GroundHog Day.Bill Murray plays Phil Connors a weatherman, who covers everything from weather to Ground Day. Phil isn't happy with his life, in fact he realizes that he is repeating the same routine over and over again. From work in the morning,totalking to the annoying Ned Ryanser( Stephen Tobolowsky), while listening to Sonny and Cher in the morning to covering the stupid GroundHog Day, Phil is repeating the same day over and over again. Of course the irony here as done by the plot, is that he is the only that knows it. It's like an episode the ''Twilight Zone'' (which I reviewed too on other sites). Eventually Phil has a mental breakdown in which he plans to do whatever he wants. He comes completely unglued when realizing how wasted his life had become, and thus wants to change it.I use the term breakdown because well Phil isn't exactly a nice guy, he's arrogant and obnoxious. We hardly sympathize with this guy, much less that he is miserable. However, the point the movie makes is the guy realizes he has been wasting his lifeaway and wants to change it, although Phil's change doesn't go ahead smoothly.He drives reckless around the train tracks, gets arrested, steals a bagfull of money from a couple of dumb cops, charms his way into sleeping with a beautiful young girl and yet finds out that he still isn't happy. Until he puts the moves on Rita (Andy McDowell), his producer. McDowell is the few actresses that I know that has limited acting potential but her beautiful presence can convey some emotions making her sympathetic.However, in order to get close to Rita, Phil has to get info on her likes and dislikes from her friends. This angle in the movie, really made me a little sick, because even we are suppose to sympathize with Phil, he hasn't really changed all that much. Rita, eventually finds out Phil's motives and slaps him in the face, and telling him to get lost. Phil though in order to impress her and to change himself, starts doing bizarre, yet unreal things that get him attention and he does start to become nicer.This is where the movie gets ridiculous, because even though this is a comedy, I found the rest of the movie to be predictable, superficial, yet enjoyablePhil becomes a gifted ice sculpter (who knows where he learned this) as one scene, where his cutting a sculpture of an ice angel is shown.

Harold Ramis has an inflated opinion of his talents (just watch his cameo in this movie to see what I mean -- the man apparently phantasizes himself as another Alfred Hitchock).  Yet, in spite of it all, this movie earned 5 stars (and more, if such a rating were available) from me.  Why?  Frankly, I honestly don't know.Part of its appeal has to do with how it treads on the very edge of cloying, yet somehow always steps back about 5 seconds BEFORE you say, &quot;Ohmigod, they're not going to do THAT, are they?&quot;  And they never do!  Beyond that, though, there is an underlying truth to this movie that transcends any rational analysis.  If you're not a Hindu/Buddhist before you see it, well, maybe you shouldn't see it.  Religious implications aside, I'm put in mind of an old joke about a great American soprano making her debut at La Scala.  After singing the crucial aria, she was bombarded with deafening pleas of, &quot;encore ... encore.&quot;  So she dutifully reprised her aria.  Again the crys of &quot;encore&quot; arose, and again she gave the audience what it demanded.  However, after the 4th encore, she stumbled to the footlights and hoarsely protested, &quot;ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I've sung this aria five times now!&quot;  Whereupon a small Italian man arose and shouted, &quot;si, and you gonna KEEP a-singin' it until you get it a-righta!&quot;Well, the bottom line here is that, in spite of themselves, these guys managed to get it &quot;a-righta&quot;.

When they started showing such brief moments from each day, and you knew that each day was pretty much identical up until that point (mostly when he was trying to win Andie McDowell's character over and was only managing to learn one new fact about her per day before he messed up and would get slapped), that was when we started to lose track of just how much time was passing. Man I started to feel so bad for him! And he couldn't even go home! What awful luck that this would happen on a day that he was out of town.But then I started to think... what if this happened when you were stuck at home, perhaps with a dead-end job (fast-food maybe), instead of an entire day's worth of free time to make the most of your life? You can't accomplish much when you're stuck behind a counter all day long. On the other hand, with no consequences (how many times did he come back to life?), you could just blow off the day's work to fulfill your life's desires. Hopefully, you do not work too many minimum-wage days in a row without pay (because no one else realizes they are repeating) before this occurs to you.I love a movie that makes me think and analyze life. This rarely happens in comedies. If it does, the movie is intended to be a comedy and falls flat. This movie had quite a few laughs. It definitely had its depressing moments.

165838,AUKLLB4J4YHNA,080017948X,Jason!,"[3, 9]","Groundhog Day......comedy or philosophy flick?  I guess its subjective to the audience. People will enjoy it for different reasons.  It is nonetheless a classic.Brief overview:  Bill Murray plays a weather man who for unknown reasons lives the same day over and over again in Punxutawney Pennsylvania.  The day is February 2nd, groundhog's day.  Each night he lays down to sleep, or dies, and is reborn anew, again on February 2nd.First off I'd like to point out that this film sits on a foundation of lies and has affected many people's lives in a terrible way:  It wasn't filmed in Punxutawney at all.  The director and producers felt that Woodstock Illinois was more ""idealic"" and choose to do principal photography there.....this eventually led to envy and resentment on the part of the real life citizens of Punxutawney.  Over half the population of Punxutawney actually invaded the town and homes of Woodstock to enjoy what, after viewing the film, clearly was a more idealic town.  As murderous doppelgangers, they adopted the lives of the Woodstock folk and still live there today.  It was a sad turn of events unpredicted by the film's creators.  If only they had thought of the consequences hundreds of lives would have been saved.With that out of the way.....I think the natural course of the film's premise is going to take you through a very pure human emtional progression.  The original screenplay was lightly based on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' Five Stages of Grief which are: 1-shock/denial;  2-anger, rage, resentment;  3-bargaining;  4-depression;  leading to 5-ultimate acceptance.  I find it most interesting to see that this progression leads Murray's character to the realization of the benefits of acting with morals.  This provides a great example that people do not need external threats of eternal damnation or rewards of heaven to act with good natured morals and to treat others with altruistic compassion.  At stage 4, Phil (Bill Murray) acts violently out of his depression of being trapped.  He kills himself in many ways.  He robs banks.  He goes joy-riding on railroad tracks.  Then when he finally accepts his fate, he knows when and where to be to help everybody in town that has a mishapt.  He catches a boy who falls from a tree, replaces a flat tire for some old ladies....and so on.Perhaps it is to be seen as a kind of divine working of the universe that it is only after this stage of acceptance when the repeating day ends and Phil finally gets to see February 3rd.

That is never explained, not even on the director's commentary.  Its kinda like they just decided to do something odd without purpose.- Every religious fanatic thinks this movie is based on their particular faith.  Go figure!

165839,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,080017948X,Jay Young,"[3, 3]","This film is one of my favorites. It has a genuinely original plot, a superb cast, a non-cliched script, and great humor. This movie works on several levels. On the surface, it is a light-hearted comedy, and stands up extremely well to the best comedies ever made. However, it has much deeper meanings as well. (Warning- Spoilers to follow. If you have not seen the movie, I suggest that you stop reading and experience it for yourself.)When Phil first gets stuck in the existential glitch, after some confusion, he takes advantage of it by eating obscene amounts of junkfood, getting into legal trouble, picking up women, and general self-indulgence, knowing that the next day, everyone will have forgotten about the day's events. Phil grows weary of it eventually, and tries to get Rita, Phil's producer, to love him. However, he goes about love by trying to bend the world around him to fit his needs, and it does not work, as Rita rejects him several times. Phil realizes the utter futility of his approach to life, and kills himself, several times, only to wake up to February 2nd, Groundhog Day.When Phil finally convinces Rita of the truth of his experience, that is his turning point. Rita tells Phil that it could be a tremendous curse or a blessing, depending on how he looks at it. He spends the day(s) helping others and improving his life. Phil is not delivered from his crisis until he lives the day exactly the way he needs to. Rita finally falls in love with Phil, it is through Phil's qualities which are now genuinely his, and not an artificial part of his experience.We never find out exactly how Phil got stuck in the same day, or why. And that is one of the best things about the movie. Any attempt at a detailed answer would almost certainly leave more questions than answers, and would distract from the themes of the film.In short, this is a highly recommended film, and one of the few that I can watch again and again and never get tired of. *****",5,Underrated Classic,1044489600,"02 6, 2003",2003,1972,"['film', 'one', 'favorites', 'genuinely', 'original', 'plot', 'superb', 'cast', 'non-cliched', 'script', 'great', 'humor', 'movie', 'several', 'levels', 'surface', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'best', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', 'However', 'much', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'well', 'Warning-', 'Spoilers', 'follow', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'suggest', 'stop', 'reading', 'experience', 'When', 'Phil', 'first', 'stuck', 'existential', 'glitch', 'confusion', 'advantage', 'eating', 'obscene', 'amounts', 'junkfood', 'getting', 'legal', 'trouble', 'picking', 'up', 'women', 'general', 'self-indulgence', 'knowing', 'next', 'day', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'forgotten', 'day', 'events', 'Phil', 'weary', 'eventually', 'tries', 'get', 'Rita', 'Phil', 'producer', 'love', 'However', 'love', 'trying', 'bend', 'world', 'fit', 'needs', 'not', 'work', 'Rita', 'several', 'times', 'Phil', 'utter', 'futility', 'approach', 'life', 'several', 'times', 'only', 'wake', 'up', 'February', '2nd', 'Groundhog', 'Day.When', 'Phil', 'finally', 'Rita', 'truth', 'experience', 'turning', 'point', 'Rita', 'Phil', 'could', 'be', 'tremendous', 'curse', 'blessing', 'depending', 'how', 'day', 'helping', 'others', 'improving', 'life', 'Phil', 'not', 'delivered', 'crisis', 'day', 'exactly', 'way', 'Rita', 'finally', 'love', 'Phil', 'Phil', 'qualities', 'are', 'now', 'genuinely', 'not', 'artificial', 'part', 'experience.We', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'how', 'Phil', 'got', 'stuck', 'same', 'day', 'why', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'attempt', 'detailed', 'answer', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'leave', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'would', 'distract', 'themes', 'film.In', 'short', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'never', 'get', 'tired', '*****']",N/A

But ""Groundhog Day"" was a great Bill Murray film - with a moral even!Murray plays a weatherman Phil Connors on a local Pennsylvania TV station who is assigned to do an on-the-scene standup. To his dismay, it is at unveiling of Punxatony Phil - the groundhog who predicts whether spring is imminent or 6 weeks away. Phil is a narcissistic twit, who feels the assignment is beneath him. But his snarkiness is put on hold when he gets the hots for on-location producer Rita (Andy McDowell). Andy is a very nice lady who sees right through Murray. No chance the two of them will end up together.A blizzard forces an overnight stay. But when Phil wakes up, he discovers that it is still February 2! It takes Phil several cycles to really believe that he is reliving precisely the same day. AT which time he does what every egomaniac would do: he tries to takes advantage of this situation. He scores with attractive women (after learning their likes and dislikes in previous lives), and otherwise tries to enrich himself. But Rita, his real quarry, is nowhere near his net.Telling more would ruin the film. Suffice it to say that Phil gets tired of his repetitive victories, and undergoes a Scroogelike metamorphosis. Kudos to writer/producer Harold Ramis for sneaking this cute morality take onto our radar. And for making it real. Which of us, when realizing, in a dream, that we are dreaming, does not try to use that knowledge for self-gratification of self-improvement? Ramis has taken that common experience and run it to it logical conclusion.

I think it may be his best.Bill Murray is a weather reporter in Philadelphia. He is also a male chauvinist, a prima donna and real jerk in general.  He does not want to go to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day celebration and during his report even says something to the effect that `this is one time where cameras can't truly capture the effect of a big rat predicting the weather'.  He is sarcastic and contemptuous of everyone and everything. All he wants to do is go back to Philadelphia but a blizzard he predicted would not hit DID hit and he is stuck in Punxsutawney. He is also stuck in GroundHog Day.  Every day following is February 2nd and he wakes in his bed with the alarm clock a playing Sonny &amp; Cher  tune.I have heard it said that this is the consummate film on reincarnation.  Maybe it is. He can't make it stop and he has no choice but to settle in and learn what gives life its value regardless of where one is or what is going on - although that is not his first or even second choice.

It isn't the concept that falls short; on the contrary, the plot is entertainingly original. Self-centred reporter Phil Connors aims to leave Pennsylvanian backwater Punxsutawney as soon as possible after completing a story on the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but his plans are thwarted when he wakes the following morning and discovers that it's Groundhog Day again. . . . . . . . . . and again. . . . . . . . . . Initially he sees this turn of events as akin to a nightmare, but soon realises that if there's no tomorrow, there are no hangovers and no consequences. . . . . . . . . .A storyline like this is very amusing per se, and there are some deft touches - such as Phil's audacious money-van heist, which succeeds simply because after innumerable Groundhog Days in succession, he knows Punxsutawney's routines so well. Due to the inherent comedy, Bill Murray's wisecracking attempts as Phil are unnecessary, they don't fit well with his character, and frankly someone making a face like a groundhog isn't that funny the first time, let alone meriting repetition.Although this is a comedy there are some genuinely thought-provoking issues raised - Phil learns (and through him we realise) that spontaneity can never be choreographed, and an impulsive moment's beauty lies in the fact that it 'just happens'. The film's biggest downfall is its predictability. Despite the various entertaining shenanigans en route, we just know that in the end Phil will have learned some Valuable Lessons and become a Nice Guy.Overall though, Groundhog Day is a likeable movie, and would leave the viewer with a much greater sense of satisfaction had it - instead of showing the happy couple running hand-in-hand through the freshly fallen snow - used a less trite finale.",3,"""What if there is no tomorrow?

But in this fantasy, our hero does just that.  He keeps living the same day over again, trying different things each time, learning from his mistakes, and getting more and more talented.  It's a great concept for a movie, and it is a great comedy.One minor change I would have made in the movie is this: I would have had some indicator so the audience would know just how many times our hero had gone through the day.  Early in the movie, that number might read 1, then 2, then 3.  But later, it might be a hilariously large number.Now, is there a profound concept behind all this?  Um, I don't think so.  If I had to live through thousands of similar days, would I try to get better at music or art?  Maybe!  And sooner or later, I might start phoning up all sorts of scientists, find out what theoretical problems they were working on, and, eventually, solve them.  After that, I'd be phoning those scientists to tell them the answers to their problems, on the spot.  I'd also be finding a way to do all sorts of computer searches each day, systematically looking for needle-in-haystack kinds of solutions to problems.  Eventually, I'd find some interesting stuff.  And it would be easy to prepare an absolutely unbelievable chess opening book (although one would have to memorize it).  Oh, there is plenty even one person could accomplish, given enough time.

But what if you had to live the same day over again, and again, and again, and again...?Phil Connors goes through this strange cycle of life in &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; an undeniably strong comedy that features a great script and cast. It's like a Frank Capra story with sarcasm. And it works perfectly.Bill Murray plays Connors with all the air of a frustrated cynical everyman who is fed up with his job and life. Phil is a weatherman for a local news station, and every year he goes to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for the Punxsutawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out on February 2nd. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. It happens every year, and this year should be no exception.Keyword: Should.Because this year isn't like most years. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Punxsutawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day.Again.Waking up to the same Sonny and Cher song as the morning before, Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same, just as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday--again. Well, technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale &quot;A Christmas Story,&quot; which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called &quot;Scrooged.&quot;But regardless, Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, &quot;I'm-smarter-than-you&quot; face. He considers himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Another thing that is great about &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck; never have bought a Ferrari, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash--it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (Although my conscience would still get in the way.)There was a little comedy a few years ago that starred John Candy. The movie was named, &quot;Delirious,&quot; and it was about a soap opera writer who bumped his head and woke up trapped inside his own written world. And everything he would write on his typewriter came true.I was reminded of that film while watching &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; which is undeniably a stronger comedy. While the movie &quot;Delirous&quot; was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control everything, and he didn't do them. I think that's where &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature.In other words, I love watching characters on-screen giving in to the same human weaknesses that we all exhibit.And that's exactly what Phil does in &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; And that is why, among other reasons, it is one of my favorite films.",5,One of the funniest--and most

A TV news weatherman (Bill Murray) goes to Punxatawnee, PA to cover Groundhog Day.  The next day he wakes up and it is Groundhog Day again.  No one remembers that this day has already passed and so he is forced to live it again.  And the next day he wakes up and... it's Groundhog Day again.  And again... and again... and again... and, well, you get the idea.  Watching Murray's character go through this bizarre situation and the effect it has on him is absolutely riveting.  I love that no attempt to explain this time-loop is ever made, it's enough for the viewer to know that it is happening and we don't need to get bogged down in some geeky sci fi explanation.Bill Murray has a tendency to be a little too smug and over-the-top in his movie performances but he is at the top of his game here.  His timing is perfect and the role harnesses his smug and biting humor but this is tempered as the story progresses and Murray captures the nuances perfectly.  The rest of the cast similarly rises to the level of the unusually intelligent script.  For my money, this is probably the single best movie in the ""romantic comedy"" genre.  It is unique and perfectly executed.

He is head over heals for MacDowell from the start, but as an arrogant weatherman, he seems to just tick her off from the start as well.Imagine waking up every morning and it is the same day over and over again?  Well, Murray has this happen to him.  Every time he does his day becomes one disaster after another until he finally gives in and figures out he can use each day to improve himself and his life a little at a time.The message here is clear.  We all have a life that is made up of the same day everyday, what we choose to do with that day is really up to us.  Do we want to improve our lot in life or just go along with being ourselves in a boring unfulfilled endless life that is a cycle of recurring themes?This movie shows anyone, even though it is a comedy, that each day we have a choice to make the day what it can be.  Murray plays Phil Connors, on Ground Hog Day when the ground hog's name is also Phil...go figure. Connors is as arrogant as they come and he just keeps trying so hard to impress people.He goes from egotisical and self serving to seeing himself to get the girl of his dreams, Rita.  It would be nice to know how many days of Ground Hog Days he spent there.  You can see him go from this to a renaissance man who really cares about people, loves life and takes each day and uses it to improve himself.Rita, although the same person and not being influenced or affected by being in Ground Hog day, comes to really like Phil.  This movie makes us laugh at ourselves and our humanity.  And by the end of the movie, he shows that he can have a positive effect on everyone he comes in contact with.So when you hear the song, &quot;I've Got You Babe,&quot; and the announcers saying, &quot;It's Ground Hog Day.....&quot; remember to use the day to its fullest.",5,Renaissance Man Extraordinaire - Carpe Diem,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,1879,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'messages', 'great', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'head', 'heals', 'MacDowell', 'start', 'arrogant', 'weatherman', 'just', 'tick', 'off', 'start', 'well.Imagine', 'waking', 'up', 'morning', 'same', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'Well', 'Murray', 'happen', 'time', 'day', 'one', 'disaster', 'finally', 'figures', 'can', 'use', 'day', 'improve', 'life', 'little', 'time.The', 'message', 'here', 'clear', 'have', 'life', 'made', 'same', 'day', 'everyday', 'what', 'choose', 'do', 'day', 'really', 'up', 'Do', 'want', 'improve', 'lot', 'life', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'being', 'boring', 'unfulfilled', 'endless', 'life', 'cycle', 'recurring', 'themes', 'movie', 'anyone', 'even', 'comedy', 'day', 'have', 'choice', 'make', 'day', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'Murray', 'Phil', 'Connors', 'Ground', 'Hog', 'Day', 'when', 'ground', 'hog', 'name', 'also', 'Phil', 'go', 'figure', 'Connors', 'as', 'arrogant', 'come', 'just', 'keeps', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'impress', 'people.He', 'egotisical', 'self', 'serving', 'seeing', 'get', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Rita', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'days', 'Ground', 'Hog', 'Days', 'spent', 'there', 'can', 'see', 'go', 'renaissance', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'people', 'life', 'day', 'improve', 'himself.Rita', 'same', 'person', 'not', 'being', 'influenced', 'affected', 'being', 'Ground', 'Hog', 'day', 'really', 'like', 'Phil', 'movie', 'laugh', 'ourselves', 'humanity', 'end', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'positive', 'effect', 'everyone', 'contact', 'with.So', 'when', 'hear', 'song', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Babe', 'quot', 'announcers', 'saying', 'quot', 'Ground', 'Hog', 'Day', '..', 'quot', 'remember', 'use', 'day', 'fullest']",N/A

It is a film that is so entertaining and endearing that you just may want to make it an annual habit of watching it to celebrate February 2rd.The plot centers around the character of Phil Connors (Bill Murray), the selfish ego-driven weatherman, who suddenly finds himself stuck in a time-warp.  Sent to Punxsutawney to cover their festive  annual Groundhog's Day event, the ever-cynical Connors, believing this event is beneath his immense talents, only has scorn for the event, the town, the people of Punxsutawney, and even his co-workers Rita and Larry (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot).  Connors is so wrapped up in himself that he has little regard for the feelings of others.  His only wish is to exit the town once the event is filmed and aired.  Fate then enters the picture when a blizzard traps Connors in Punxsutawney, and when he awakens the ""next"" morning, he finds himself reliving the events of the previous day.  Bewildered, he tries to escape his strange fate only to find that no matter what he does, he still awakens on Groundhog Day. Reliving the day over and over again, he begins to realize that the time-warp might work to his advantage, and he attempts to become the perfect man for Rita, whom he is secretly in love with.  Rita is not easily swayed by Connors feigned charms however, and each attempt by Connors is eventually met with a slap of rebuttal.Forced to relive the day endlessly, Connors finally begins to realize his own callousness, shallowness, and selfishness, and begins to actually care about the people around him.

165891,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,080017948X,Larry Benjamin,"[2, 2]","One definition of great art is that it suggests more than just the mere story. On the surface, this film is about a man who, forced to repeat the same day over and over, eventually cycles through trying to gain an unfair advantage, to despair, and finally, uses his apparently godlike knowledge to help his less enlightened fellows. In the original story, the Bill Murray character must repeat February 2 for ten thousand years, a length of time suggestive of the Vedic cycles and the ice ages. That's over three and a half million days; would it take that many? Evidently, for some, it would.The simplest lesson is that every day is a new day. We can choose to start over, to make any change - we are limited only by our imaginations and our inability to break old habits.The deeper meaning of the film parallels reincarnation - Murray awakens to a new life every morning, even when he has &#34;died&#34; the previous day, usually by his own hand. The difference is that unlike typical reincarnation, he remembers everything, which allows him to learn from his previous &#34;lives.&#34; But if it takes him that long to achieve enlightenment when he's allowed to retain knowledge of every day that has gone before, what hope to the rest of us have, whose memories are wiped so clean with each successive rebirth, that even the possibility of reincarnation itself is subject to doubt?Imagine that after your death, you are not reborn in the future, but return to your original birth - the same parents, the same childhood, the same mistakes and missed opportunities to make better choices. But you cannot remember the ten thousand times you have already endured this, at least, not clearly. But once in a while, you have the unmistakeable feeling that you have experienced something already, and other times, maybe not even that, just a quiet voice hinting that you may want to try something different this time. To offer comfort instead of condemnation, to forbear violence, to show mercy.This is not the voice of God or the pangs of conscience. This is your own voice from your past lives, that already knows what is going to happen, and is trying to get you to do better this time, for a change.",5,The mercy of resurrection,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,2198,"['One', 'definition', 'great', 'art', 'more', 'just', 'mere', 'story', 'surface', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'repeat', 'same', 'day', 'eventually', 'trying', 'gain', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'despair', 'finally', 'apparently', 'godlike', 'knowledge', 'help', 'less', 'enlightened', 'fellows', 'original', 'story', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'must', 'repeat', 'February', '2', 'ten', 'thousand', 'years', 'length', 'time', 'suggestive', 'Vedic', 'cycles', 'ice', 'ages', 'over', 'three', 'half', 'million', 'days', 'would', 'take', 'many', 'Evidently', 'simplest', 'lesson', 'day', 'new', 'day', 'can', 'choose', 'start', 'make', 'change', 'are', 'limited', 'only', 'imaginations', 'inability', 'break', 'old', 'habits.The', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'film', 'parallels', 'reincarnation', 'Murray', 'new', 'life', 'morning', 'even', 'when', '34', 'died', '34', 'previous', 'day', 'usually', 'own', 'hand', 'difference', 'typical', 'reincarnation', 'everything', 'learn', 'previous', '34', '34', 'long', 'achieve', 'enlightenment', 'when', 'allowed', 'retain', 'knowledge', 'day', 'gone', 'before', 'what', 'hope', 'rest', 'have', 'memories', 'are', 'wiped', 'so', 'clean', 'successive', 'rebirth', 'even', 'possibility', 'reincarnation', 'subject', 'doubt', 'Imagine', 'death', 'are', 'not', 'reborn', 'future', 'return', 'original', 'birth', 'same', 'parents', 'same', 'childhood', 'same', 'mistakes', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'make', 'better', 'choices', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'ten', 'thousand', 'times', 'have', 'already', 'endured', 'least', 'not', 'clearly', 'once', 'while', 'have', 'unmistakeable', 'feeling', 'have', 'experienced', 'something', 'already', 'other', 'times', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'just', 'quiet', 'voice', 'hinting', 'may', 'want', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'time', 'offer', 'comfort', 'instead', 'condemnation', 'forbear', 'violence', 'show', 'mercy.This', 'not', 'voice', 'God', 'pangs', 'conscience', 'own', 'voice', 'past', 'lives', 'already', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'trying', 'get', 'do', 'better', 'time', 'change']",N/A

A man is forced to relive the same twenty four hours, over, and over, and over again, ad infinitum.Bill Murray is that man. An obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman, he is in Punxutawney, Pennsylvania to cover its Groundhog Day celebration, along with his beautiful and altruistic TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell, and his patient, long suffering cameraman, played by Chris Elliot. Murray, playing an uncaring, unfeeling wretch of a guy, is, for some inexplicable reason, forced to relive the same twenty four hours in Punxutawney over and over again. Why? Who knows and who cares? What follows next are some of the funniest moments in film.At first, Murray is confused. No one else, however, seems to be. As Murray continues to relive the same day, confusion turns to anger. Ultimately, that anger turns to mischieviousness and indulgence. After all, what would one do, if there were no consequences to one's actions?This premise provides for quite a few, very funny scenes. This puckish foray quickly denigrates into profound despair, as Murray realizes that he seems destined to relive the same day forever. Frequent, subsequent suicide attempts fail to stop the clock, and Murray rethinks his position. He concentrates , finally, on becoming the best man that he can be, with the lovely Andie MacDowell as his romantic interest.Murray's transition from smarm to charm provides for many hilarious scenes that will leave the viewer howling with laughter. The ultimate impact of his transition from Neanderthal man to Renaissance man is, needless to say, a positive one. This redemption will ultimately prove to be be Murray's salvation.Murray provides droll, comedic delivery, and he is perfect in this role. Andie MacDowell is the perfect straight man and comedic foil. Together they make this movie one that the viewer will want to see again and again.",4,A FUNNY FANTASY FILM...,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,1996,"['doubt', 'one', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'best', 'films', 'fantasy', 'comedy', 'flick', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'simple', 'man', 'forced', 'relive', 'same', 'twenty', 'four', 'hours', 'over', 'again', 'ad', 'infinitum.Bill', 'Murray', 'man', 'obnoxious', 'Pittsburgh', 'weatherman', 'Punxutawney', 'Pennsylvania', 'cover', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'celebration', 'beautiful', 'altruistic', 'TV', 'producer', 'played', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'patient', 'long', 'suffering', 'cameraman', 'played', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'Murray', 'playing', 'uncaring', 'unfeeling', 'wretch', 'guy', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'forced', 'relive', 'same', 'twenty', 'four', 'hours', 'Punxutawney', 'over', 'again', 'Why', 'Who', 'who', 'What', 'next', 'are', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film.At', 'first', 'Murray', 'confused', 'one', 'else', 'however', 'be', 'Murray', 'relive', 'same', 'day', 'confusion', 'turns', 'anger', 'Ultimately', 'anger', 'mischieviousness', 'indulgence', 'what', 'would', 'one', 'do', 'were', 'consequences', 'one', 'actions', 'premise', 'quite', 'few', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'puckish', 'foray', 'quickly', 'profound', 'despair', 'Murray', 'destined', 'relive', 'same', 'day', 'forever', 'Frequent', 'subsequent', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'fail', 'stop', 'clock', 'Murray', 'position', 'finally', 'becoming', 'best', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'lovely', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'romantic', 'interest.Murray', 'transition', 'smarm', 'charm', 'many', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'howling', 'laughter', 'ultimate', 'impact', 'transition', 'Neanderthal', 'man', 'Renaissance', 'man', 'needless', 'say', 'positive', 'one', 'redemption', 'will', 'ultimately', 'prove', 'be', 'be', 'Murray', 'salvation.Murray', 'droll', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'perfect', 'role', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'perfect', 'straight', 'man', 'comedic', 'foil', 'Together', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'viewer', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again']",N/A

We just saw it in 2005, 13 years after its original release. And that says a lot about how timeless it is: how much it can work regardless of the time you watch it.The bottom line of the movie is fairly basic, when you first think of it: Bill Murray, who plays the role of a news weatherman from Pittsburg, is off to cover Groundhog Day once more, an event he's had more of than he can stomach. After the day is over, every day from then on, starts to repeat the exact same Groundhog Day, over and over. This gives him time to look deep inside himself after numerous failed attempts of ""escaping"" the time loop, and perfect things from saying the right things to everyone (including his new producer, played by beautiful Andie Macdowell) to becoming an accomplished ice sculptor and piano player, and even attempting to save the lives of those doomed to have an accident and/or die that day.His evolution as a person and the way he begins to see things in a different light as new Groundhog Days keep coming at him once and again is enlightening. At the end, it's more than just a feel-food romantic comedy. It poses some interesting and significant questions for us to ponder: What would you do, if you could live a day over and over indefinitely? What would you make of it?

Phil displays a charm and wit on camera that evaporates the moment the red light goes off; he is bitter, appallingly self-centered, and treats his co-workers with contempt, especially his producer Rita played by the charming Andie MacDowell and cameraman Larry played by Chris Elliot. On February 2, 1992, Phil, Rita, and Larry are sent on an assignment that Phil especially loathes: the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, PA, where the citizens await the appearance of Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who will supposedly determine the length of winter by his ability to see his own shadow. Phil is eager to beat a hasty retreat, but when a freak snowstorm strands him in Punxsutawney, he wakes up the next morning with the strangest sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu: he seems to be living the same day over again. The next morning it happens again, and then again. Soon, no matter what he does, he's stuck in February 2, 1992; nothing her tries gets him out of the loop. But the more Phil relives the same day, the more he's forced to look at other people's lives, and something unusual happens: he begins to care about others.

The beginning, for me, does get kinda boring. Some people might think this kinda film might run out of steam and inspiration, but it's full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity.This is one of Bill Murray's best movies ever, he is at his cynical best in this, and totally tops anything like Scrooge or Ghostbusters. I love the way he tries to change for the better, and still manages to get slapped in the face by Andie McDowell loads!What gets so tedious about this movie, is how many days are actually shown, and how he manages to find out everything about everyone. Obviously, it couldn't actually show everything that happened, otherwise we'd all still be watching the movie, but he is said to go through February 2nd, 34 times. There were many more days implied, for example how he knew everyone so well in the diner, but only 34 days were actually shown. It's never actually explained in the movie (maybe in the commentary, I never watch those), why Phil actually came to be reliving February 2nd over and over again, and why that particular day. Particularly since he'd done the broadcast from Punxsutawney for three or four years, I always wonder why that particular year. Early drafts of the script explained the cause of Phil's weird experience: a disaffected ex-lover called Stephanie cast a spell on him to teach him a lesson.In one scene, Phil throws himself from the bell tower of a high building. This building is actually an opera house in Woodstock, Illinois. Local legend has it that a young girl once committed suicide by throwing herself from the same bell tower. Her ghost is supposed to haunt the opera house.The good thing about Bill Murray is that he is so quotable most of the time, and there's some great sarcastic comments in this! You'd probably have to watch the movie to understand them, but here are some of his best lines:""You wanna throw up here, or you wanna throw up in the car?""""Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today.""""Excuse me, where is everyone going?""""To Gobbler's Knob. It's Groundhog Day.""""It's still just once a year, right?""""I'm betting he's going to swerve first.""""I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster and drank pina coladas. At sunset we made love like sea otters. *That* was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over and over...""""My years are not advancing as fast as you might think.""""You want a prediction about the weather, you're asking the wrong Phil. I'll give you a winter prediction: It's gonna be cold, it's gonna be grey, and it's gonna last you for the rest of your life.""""Can I have another one of these with some booze in it?""""Yeah, three cheeseburgers, two large fries, two chocolate shakes and a large coke.""""Morons. Your bus is leaving.""""This is one time where television really fails to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel predicting the weather.""Anyone who's ever felt their life is just nothing, or you do the same thing every day, needs to take a break from their routine and watch this.

Every year he gets stuck having to go to Punxsutawney, Pensylvania to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. Going with him this year is his sexy and cheerful producer Rita ( Andie McDowell), and his smart-mouthed, yet somewhat nerdy camera man Larry ( Chris Elliot). Phil wants to get out of town as soon as possible, but is snowed in when an unexpected blizzard hits. But things are about to get even worse. Phil wakes up the next morning to discover that it's Groundhog Day all over again. He is forced to live the same day over and over. But the more Phil is forced to repeat it, the more he comes to care about the town and those around him. But life really starts to get complicated when he finds himself falling for Rita.""Groundhog Day"" is one of the funniest and most original films ever made. Bill Murray has made a lot of outstanding films. But in my opinion, ""Groundhog Day"" is his best one. The repeating day is amazingly done. All of the actors do an extremely good job making each day look the same. The laughs that this film brings are non-stop. I even found myself rewinding scenes for a second and third viewing at times. Bill Murray is amazing as Phil Connors. Watching him play both roles is great. The first being the one who hates everybody and only cares about himself. Watching him try to kill himself over and over will make you laugh extremely hard. The other is the one that adjusts to live in Punksatawney and learns to care about those around him. No matter what he does, he will make you laugh. Andie McDowell is great as Rita. Her sweet and caring nature works well against Murray's negative attitude. The chemistry between her and Murray is amazing. One of the best romance stories I have ever seen. However, my favorite character was Stephen Tobolowsky's Ned Rierson. Every different time Ned and Phil meet, provides for the funniest scenes in the film. ""Ned, I'd love to stay here and talk with you. But I'm not going to."" Chris Elliot and the rest of the town are also all outstanding.No matter how many times you see this film, you will never find it boring, repetitive, or less funny.

Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[14, 19]","Okay, I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me past the opening line of this review : Groundhog Day is perhaps the most underappreciatedmovie of the 90s and one of the best comedies since Hollywood's Golden Age, a film Frank Capra would have been proud of making.  Did Ilose you?  Rolling on the ground laughing?  Does the very concept of Bill Murray and Harold Ramis making one of the great films of all timestrike you as too absurd for words?  Well, hold on, and try this : forget everything you know about the movie and just listen to a briefdescription :A monstrously self-centered TV personality is sent to small town America to cover a hokey holiday.  He's accompanied by atoo-innocent-to-be-believed, but button-cute, producer and a smart-alecky camera man.  Trapped by a snow storm, which he had erroneouslypredicted would miss the region, our egomaniac is forced to spend the night in town and, when he awakes, finds to his horror that he's relivingthe same day over again. And reliving, and reliving, and reliving....  At first, he takes some enjoyment in the seeming prescience this provideshim and he takes great liberties once he realizes that he will never have to face the consequences for any action he takes, because tomorrownever comes.  Though his producer is quite obviously repelled by his self-centered nature, he eventually discovers that he can worm his wayinto her affections by dating her over and over again and discovering her likes and dislikes, since she, of course, remembers nothing of theprior dates.  Yet, even with all this effort, he is unable to win her, because he remains, fundamentally, obnoxious.  Forced to confront his ownunpleasantness and unlovability and the essential emptiness of his life, the man, aware now that he hates himself, tries to commit suicide, invarious and sundry ways, but always awakens to greet the dawning of the new/old day.  And so now, at last, his efforts turn toself-improvement, rather than to self-aggrandizement, and to helping others rather than to satisfying his own urges.  His dilemma forces him tomove beyond himself and to serve others.  Where he once avoided the people of the town like the plague, he is now become an integral part oftheir community, and where he once saw the producer as merely an object of his lust, he now proves himself worthy of her love.  The nextmorning, time resumes its regular progression and he resumes his life, a better man.  Honestly, doesn't that sound like a Capra flick, starringJimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur?In fact, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis have made enough dogs, separately and together, to warrant your healthy skepticism, but Murray'sperformance here is generally under control and Ramis seldom stoops to gags and pratfalls.  There's a big upside to the nasty edge that Murrayalways carries with him; we're prone to forgetting just how dark Jimmy Stewart's screen persona often tended to be, from explosive andsuicidal, like George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life, to voyeuristic and manipulative, in Rear Window, to domineering and obsessive, inVertigo. Andie MacDowell, on the other hand, is a tad too vacuous to counterbalance Murray effectively, but that's a tolerable flaw since it'svery much Murray's movie.Still not convinced?  Here's my last try : how many recent films, nevermind comedies, actually have a story arc where the main character,instead of going through some process of healing his inner child, or whatever, improves himself by becoming a better member of society?What's the last comedy you saw that both made you laugh and made you think?  (Heck, how many do either?)  If you think about it, this movieruns counter to two of the worst trends in modern culture, the appalling focus on the self, and the annoying tendency to dumb art down so thatit can be marketed across societal and national borders without losing anything in the translation.  Make a movie for the purposes of selling itto teens and to China and you're going to have to go with scatology instead of metaphysics.  Thus, it's increasingly rare to find a movie thatrequires that your synapses actually be firing, much less one that causes them to fire more quickly.NBC has done something quite savvy and socially useful in recent years; they've turned It's a Wonderful Life into a Christmas-time event.Sure it was great when local PBS stations played it incessantly and we all learned the script by heart, but there's something more appealingabout turning it into a shared viewing experience for the nation, one that hundreds of thousands of homes are tuned into at the same time.We've so few rituals left that bind us together as a community that perhaps one of the best services the television networks can provide is toestablish a few holiday traditions, revolving around movies, or other specials, that they'd show yearly.  Besides Wonderful Life and TNT'sChristmas Story marathon and ABC's showing of The Ten Commandments around Passover, someone could show Gettysburg on the 4th ofJuly; PBS could re-air Eyes on the Prize around Martin Luther King, Jr. Day; show Young Abraham Lincoln on President's Day; etc., etc.,etc.....

Wouldn't it be nice to have a midwinter feast that actually came in the middle of winter?  Try Groundhog Day.Groundhog Day is really an outgrowth of a medieval midwinter feast called Candlemas (as well as a host of pre-Christian traditions from Ireland and other European regions).  So if you feel like you need one more holiday to get you through until spring, consider celebrating Groundhog Day.  If you don't know about Groundhog Day, this movie is a good primer on how it is celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania every year.  And, yes it has a sort of moral lesson, which is embedded with enough humor and charm to go down sweetly.Bill Murray plays ""Phil,"" an obnoxious big-city weatherman sent with his attractive, but distant producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for Groundhog's Day.The plot really starts when Phil wakes up the next day to discover that it is Groundhog Day all over again.  Incredulously, he relives the same events he went through the day before, then falls into bed exhausted and confused.The next day is Groundhog Day again - the same day Phil just lived through.  And so is the next day. Phil catches on and begins acting out his frustrations and using people, knowing he'll have no consequences. But, eventually, boredom and Phil's failure to make any headway with Rita convince him that ""all is vanity.""Finally, two factors change Phil's attitudes toward life, toward other people, and even toward his strange situation.First, Phil learns compassion through an old vagrant who dies in the street late at night, moving Phil to try to save him the next day and the next.But the deepest change comes as Phil falls into real love for Rita.  Though Rita awakes every day disliking the Phil she knew yesterday, Phil realizes a little more every day just what Rita could mean to him. If only he deserved her, that is.Phil has already pretended to change.  But when Phil realizes he really needs to change, he does.  He learns to play piano. He reads good books.  He even starts becoming kind to other people.  By the movie's end, compassion and love have motivated Phil to become the person that he should have been all along.  Apparently, all he needed was a little encouragement and an apparently infinite number of tries to get it right.Too bad we don't get the same number of ""redos"" in life. Or do we?Couldn't every day be a bit of a ""redo"" if we wanted it to be?This movie is worth watching once a year.  I HOPE the anniversary version is worth the extra investment, but as it's not out as I type this review, I don't really know. I do know that it's easy to see why the deleted scenes on the ""Special Edition"" didn't make it into the movie.Happy Groundhog Day.

This is another favorite movie of mine that I can watch over &amp; over &amp; enjoy a good laugh.  Phil Connors is a self-centered character, &amp; you find plenty of reasons to not like him.  His day just repeats itself...over...&amp; over, which I thought was an interesting movie concept.  It's as if a higher power intentionally put this spell on him to try &amp; make him a better person, cuz that was the only way it would  happen.  Rita, his sweet, unselfish co-worker, is totally unlike him, &amp; he's quickly drawn to her.It's hilarious watching him rehearse different things every day, trying to find out every little thing about Rita that he can.  How we wish we could repeat some things in life...school, job interviews &amp; jobs, meeting the opposite sex, etc.!!  You also start feeling sorry for him when he starts feeling dispair, &amp; desperately wants a break from his curse.  &quot;This is pitiful....a 1000 people freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat.&quot;  He even attempts suicide, but he's still stuck!!  After this point, the movie starts focusing more on his feelings for Rita, &amp; how he's determined to win her by bettering himself,He becomes inspired to play piano after hearing Mozart,  remembering Rita mentioning that her dream guy has to play an instrument.  Learning such an instrument from scratch requires so much patience &amp; practice over a long period time.  But we have to also constantly remember that trying to do anything well, whether it's self-help or just perfecting skills, requires regular &amp; daily practice.  Being a musician myself, I would definitely use that opportunity to do such things!!  Just one of many examples that makes you wonder what would you do, &amp; what would people you know do in his place?I tried doing the same thing another reviewer mentioned, trying to count the # of actual days he's stuck in, but it's hard!! You become so wrapped up in it, you don't wanna even worry about it.  The end left me believing that though we wish we had all the time in the world, we have to do best with the time we have (oh, they do mention that on Lord of the Rings, don't they?).  We also have to realize we don't have endless chances to get things right.  It reminded me of a Christmas Carol, how the character changes at the end.

No one can deny that Bill Murray's minor role (I dare to call it a cameo), in Space Jam was well worth it.  But here, in a film about a holiday so many of us don't actually stop and take notice of, Bill Murray shines and we can't help stopping to take notice.  While I do wonder what exactly caused the time loop that Mr. Murray's abnoxious weatherman character was stuck in, it doesn't keep me up at night.  The film does suggest that if you are rude, abnoxious, self-centered, and self-serving, then you'll be stuck in such a time loop until you better yourself.  If that were the case, I'd have been stuck in multiple such time loops in my life...but alas, I've learned my lessons in other, more boring, more conventional ways.  I wasn't blown away by Andie MacDowell's performance, but that could be in part due to the fact that I just don't know her.  Eventually, a certain chemistry came about between her and Mr. Murray and I did find myself rooting for them as opposed to feeling that anything between was forced.  Personally, I'd have liked to see that chemistry between them from the beginning, even when there was no hint of anything between them (hey, there can be chemistry between people who are supposed to dislike one another...it's the magic of the movies.)  But again, the film was good and I'm living with this minor hiccup.  I did like Chris Elliott as Larry, the cameraman (no last name is ever given to the poor guy) and I found it amusing when there was a hint of him possibly entering a relationship with a woman whom Bill Murray's character, Phil Conners, had shamelessly seduced during his time loop.  Overall, this was a great film with an interesting premise and I recommend it for multiple viewings...have fun with the irony of that statement if you like.

Phil becomes stuck in the same day, Groundhog Day, reliving it over and over  again. This incredibly humorous story is also touching and full of moral  values, as well as one of the best movies for character development to  date.The main reason Phil begins his inner spring cleaning is because  of Rita (played by Andie McDowell), Phil's beautiful, down to earth  producer. Of coarse, by reliving the same day, Phil figures out the  qualities of Rita's ideal man, and through trial and error tries to  manipulate her into believing that Phil is him. However, Rita sees through  this shallow trick, even with Phil's best performance. After going through  many different fazes, like how many ways he can kill himself, Phil realizes  that his ticket to personal and romantic success is to make the best of  this very unique opportunity  and fix his faults. This chain of events  leads to a very humorous and romantic ending.The path Phil takes toward  character development will make you laugh more than any other Bill Murry  film.

165949,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,080017948X,Priscilla Stafford,"[10, 11]","Bill Murray plays self-centered and sarcastic TV weatherman Phil Connors in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. Giving everyone contemptuous and snide remarks, it's no wonder that both his TV producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) find him completely dislikable. On an assignment, Phil along with his crew is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to report on the annual celebration of Groundhog Day. Phil of course can't wait to get out of the town but 'disaster' strikes when a blizzard comes in fast and hard, making it impossible for Phil to leave the town of Punxsutawney. Strangely enough, Phil wakes up the next morning, finding out it 'isn't' the next morning, he has again woken up on February 2nd, 1992! Day after day, he must live through the same Groundhog Day! Will he ever be able to break out of the time loop or is he destined to live the same day over and over? Phil desperately wants to go back to his normal life. And more than anything, he wants to be the kind of man Rita would fall in love with, just as he becomes to fall in love with her....By reading the summary on &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, those who have never watched this movie are probably thinking 'what a strange movie this sounds like.' But I assure you, I myself was very surprised how good the plot was and how every actor and actress was perfect in their parts.The most notable acting done in the movie was by Bill Murray. I have always liked Bill Murray, he has a sense of timing, giving off jokes at the perfect moment. He is just sooo funny! And he is not only a great comedian, he also gets to show off some of his serious and romantic side in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. As he continued to live the same day again and again, you can't help but get attached to his character and even begin to like him, especially as he begins to change. The supporting actors Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot do a good job in their roles, too, but Bill Murray certainly steals the whole movie.I must also acknowledge the superb screenwriting job done by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis (Ramis is also the Director and Producer of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;). The plot is actually very 'smart', creating a very interesting perspective. The movie is a bit repetitive at times (of course it is, that's the whole point!) and feels a bit bogged down, but the story always picks up. The ending was so nice I couldn't help but want to jump up and down and shout hurray! A truly triumphant ending!I highly recommend this movie for those who like incredible acting with plenty of drama, humor, and romance in the plot. The movie is rated PG because of some innuendo, crude humor, and adult themes. Not for younger kids to watch since they might find the story a bit hard to follow and a bit dull. Great for teens and adults. Another movie I highly recommend is &quot;The Truman Show&quot; starring Jim Carrey. An incredible movie, the PG-rated film is similar to &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; in that the movie centers on the life of Carrey's character whose life is stuck an interesting perspective.Some bits of interesting trivia on &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;:*Murray was bitten by the groundhog twice during the filming of this movie.**Murray and Ramis have both been Honorary Grand Marshals for the Groundhog Day celebrations in Punxsatawney, PA.**The movie was not filmed in Punxsutawney, but actually in Woodstock, Illinois. There is a small plaque that reads &quot;Bill Murray stepped here&quot; on the curb where Murray continually steps into a puddle.**In one of the early scenes of Phil at the piano teacher's house, when he is fumblingly playing Rachmaninoff's &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme by Paginini&quot;, is actually Bill Murray playing.

Back in those days, I couldn't understand why nothing was going the way I  thought it should, no matter how hard I tried to bend and twist my will and  that of others to fit my plan. Ah, the ego - it is a marvelous  misconception.Our hero, Phil Connor (Bill Murray), has enough ego to  choke - well, certainly to choke any interest the lovely Andie MacDowell  might have in him when they end up trapped in a small town in the middle of  a blizzard, on GroundHog Day.For her, it's a one day event. Heck, for  everyone but Phil, it's a one day event.  But Phil - well, Phil wakes up  again and again to the sound of &quot;I've Got You Babe&quot; - same day,  same people and the only way things change is when Phil's behavior changes.Unfortunately for Phil, but fortunately for those of us watching this  movie, it takes him several wake-up calls before he gets it.  I've tried  figuring out how many years these repeated days add up to - but I can't and  it doesn't really matter.Some of us learn slowly, and when we are in  the midst of 'getting it', this movie is a comfort.

That is the fertile scenario that Bill Murray finds himself in when he wakes up repeatedly on Groundhog Day.  The first part of the movie sets the stage as we see Bill as a big-shot big-city weatherman trying to score with the young, attractive assistant producer.  They go to Puxsatawny, PA to cover the annual groundhog event along with their whimsical cameraman.  Things don't go well in his quest for seduction and he is shocked to discover that when he wakes up tommorrow it's yesterday.  There is a great deal of humor that comes from all of this as everybody does everything they did that day except our bewildered weatherman.  In time he discovers some advantages in this merry-go-round.  For example, he arranges to start taking piano lessons.  By the time it's all over, he has become quite the maestro though he has yet to reach tommorrow.  However, his repeated attempts to seduce the assistant producer keep coming up short.  He starts learning some important lessons about himself and others in this repetative day he's stuck in.  Though he improves so much as a person he is still stuck on what's best for him.  The moment he finally does something that's truly selfless, the next day arrives.I really enjoyed this movie and it is one of those movies that improves with each viewing.  I considered rating it higher but, apart from Bill Murray, the acting wasn't quite that spectacular.

165958,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,080017948X,R. A Rubin,"[16, 17]","Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theatre. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring.  Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century.  Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus.  That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.I read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis.  Ramis is a Chicago born Jew with no religious training.  He is a Hollywood director, actor, and comedy scriptwriter.  He is presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil, the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station.  Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest non-secular religious experience in American Cinema.  The fact that Rabbi's, Ministers, and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.There are so many classic comedy bits, lines to remember, and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning.  Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again.  Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior.  Every man is trapped by his wiring.  Then, sometimes, maybe because of a catastrophic event, a religious insight, or an intelligent evaluation, there is an epiphany.  We can't be sure how the application of intelligence, talent, or luck can establish great work, but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog.",5,Groundhog Is Jesus,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,2252,"['Groundhog', 'Day', 'was', 'Harold', 'Ramis-Danny', 'Green', 'script', 'Ramis', 'ingeniously', 'freezing', 'Woodstock', 'IL', '1993', 'release', 'film', 'critics', 'time', 'noted', 'cute', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'particular', 'accomplishment', 'Everyone', 'know', 'who', 'seen', 'included', 'liked', 'smiled', 'way', 'theatre', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'American', 'calendar', 'film', 'often', 'played', 'day', 'mid-winter', 'where', 'colder', 'climates', 'are', 'dreaming', 'Spring', 'Today', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'considered', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'Films', 'late', '20th', 'Century', 'Danny', 'Rubin', 'created', 'concept', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'co-writer', 'Animal', 'House', 'Caddyshack', 'broke', 'away', 'previous', 'gross-comedy', 'productions', 'direct', 'Opus', 'Maximus', 'how', 'Jonah', 'Goldberg', 'National', 'Review', 'described', 'February', '2005', 'issue', 'Conservative', 'magazine.I', 'read', '2003', 'New', 'Yorker', 'piece', 'Ramis', 'Ramis', 'Chicago', 'born', 'Jew', 'religious', 'training', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'actor', 'comedy', 'scriptwriter', 'presently', 'studying', 'Buddhism', 'second', 'wife', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Danny', 'Rubin', 'other', 'version', 'script', 'had', 'Andi', 'MacDowell', 'also', 'reliving', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Murray', 'Phil', 'slimy', 'weatherman', 'Pittsburgh', 'TV', 'station', 'Ramis', 'made', 'necessary', 'changes', 'rest', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'non-secular', 'religious', 'experience', 'American', 'Cinema', 'fact', 'Rabbi', 'Ministers', 'Priests', 'are', 'showing', 'film', 'parishioners', 'world', 'testament', 'film', 'masterful', 'Aristotelian', 'philosophy', 'redemption', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'comedy', 'bits', 'lines', 'remember', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'short', 'review', 'often', 'overlooked', 'theme', 'rescue', 'learning', 'Adults', 'are', 'cursed', 'make', 'same', 'mistakes', 'over', 'again', 'Every', 'Freudian', 'shrink', 'heard', 'patient', 'repetition', 'behavior', 'man', 'trapped', 'wiring', 'Then', 'sometimes', 'maybe', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'religious', 'insight', 'intelligent', 'evaluation', 'epiphany', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'how', 'application', 'intelligence', 'talent', 'luck', 'can', 'establish', 'great', 'work', 'must', 'appreciate', 'when', 'see', 'be', 'Groundhog']",N/A

""Goundhog Day"". Murray (as TV Weatherman Phil Connors) is easily the movie's lone Hollywood star, as the rest of the cast are much lesser known in the field. Andie MacDowell was probably better known for her career in modeling in 1993, than as an actress... she does a simply wonderful job as ""Rita"" the TV Producer. Chris Elliot does a fine job in a less annoying role than he's used to as ""Larry"" the cameraman (he's come a long way since being ""The Man Under The Stairs"" on David Letterman). The other actor to really make an impression is the man with the recognizable face, but what's his name (Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned ""Bing!"" Ryerson). Oh, and Scooter the groundhog. As for the story, Bill Murray is stuck in the same cold day (which happens to be Groundhog Day) in Punxsutawney, PA covering the now famous festivities. He keeps reliving the same day, over and over again. Everyday he sees the same things. Everyday he meets the same people... the man in the hallway early in the morning, Doris the waitress, the town mayor, etc. He decides to make the best of the situation and do whatever he wants... only because he knows he'll wake up the next day and it will be the same day all over again. As he grows tired of reliving the same day over and over, Connors shifts his focus to Rita. First, trying to impress her. Then, trying to really care for her. When he finally does break thru to her, the spell is broken and the next day appears. I rank some of Bill Murray's movies as classic... i.e. ""Caddyshack"", ""Stripes"", ""Scrooged"", ""What About Bob"", etc... but I put ""Groundhog Day"" at the top of the list.

The concept of the film, reliving the same day again and again, is a solid one and the filmmakers make the most of it. Director/writer Harold Ramis and co-writer Danny Rubin take the story of a curmudgeonly weather forecaster trapped perpetually in the same day from a cleverly set up beginning to a fitting terminus. They intertwine the repetitions of the eternal day with the vicissitudes of our reluctant subject and produce a work that is both smart and filled with jeu d' esprit. Add the comic genius of Bill Murray and the strong support of Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot and you have a notable comedy.Of course I must admit that the very idea of reliving a day is a reoccurring fantasy of mine, as I'm sure it is with many. The old wish, `if I could just go back and redo that' is in essence I guess a way to deal with regret and reconsideration of moments passed. That is why films such as this and `Family Man' and `Disney's The Kid' have such an appeal. The difference between those films and this one is that I could not find any room for improvement here.

Here's my input on the bonus stuff:What's good:&quot;The weight of time&quot; documentary - What makes this documentary somewhat unique, is that it allows the screenwriter some screen time to convey what his vision of the movie would have been. It's a gutsy move that Ramis allowed this on his film, since the original concept of Groundhog Day was far darker than the final product. It's an interesting watch, although it would have been nicer if Bill Murray made an appearance in the documentary.Director's commentary: Ramis' approach is to tell small anecdotes about minor characters, how people were cast, how the scenes were filmed, etc. It's interesting and entertaining in its own right. He doesn't just drone on and on like many directors do. I think his acting and comedy background helps make him be more interesting, personable, and accessable for viewers to listen to.What's lousy:I'm probably alone on this, but the animated menus are annoying, silly, and slow. You have to wait for the animation to get going before you're allowed to make your choice. It'd be forgivable if there were any easter eggs hidden, but I know of none.

Phil believes he is omniscient and can predict the future: no snow today.Phil realizes he cannot escape from waking each morning to Feb 2. So he decides to use his 24 hours to realize his fantasies of power, controlling others completely: learning everything about women in order to seduce, robbing a bank, costuming as Clint Eastwood to attend the movies.Eventually continual self pleasure bores.If all the year were playing holidays,To sport would be as tedious as to work. ShakespearePhil becomes disgusted with the trivial, what he thought was desirable, then despondent when the one woman he truly cares for rejects him. Multiple attempts at suicide fail as he wakes again each morning to Feb 2.Acquiescing to his immortal reality, he opts to improve himself by learning piano. And Phil decides to try to make his 24 hour world better in some way by helping others out of their dilemmas, expressing empathy for a hopeful engaged couple, an elderly man's illness, poverty, misfortune. Phil's repeated, unsuccessful attempts to rescue a homeless man from death seals Phil's acceptance of his incapacity to control anything or anyone (Departures) Masahiro Motoki Oscar winner.Phil resignedly accepts February 2 as his sole existence, humbly letting go of control and internalizing gratitude for the eternal Feb 2 he is given. Ironically his shift in attitude releases him to wake on Feb 3.InMemoirs of a Geisha (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)Ziyi Zhang, Ken Watanabe the Chairman cautions ""happiness is not something we have a right to expect in this life, if it occurs it is a sudden gift"" as Phil discovers.The compassion of director Ramus enriches Groundhog Day, like the bookBroken for You, understanding that we must experience spiritual brokenness (wu wei nonstriving) before we can align with reality, find common ground for existence, accept our imperfect humanity and understand we survive solely by depending on one another.Groundhog day is thoughtful likeThe Story of Uswith Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, realizing the choices we make dictate the lives we lead, and we can either honor others and ourselves for whatever brief moment we share on earth, or we may suffer redoing our choices until we get it rightMarried People: Staying Together in the Age of Divorce,A Couple's Guide to Communication.Groundhog Day is much like the process of psychotherapy, things always get much worse (we keep doing what we were doing which only gets us where we were before) before the option of making things better appears (taking a risk with candid self reflection, less object oriented materialistic buying instead more compassion and anonymous generosity).Also seeDhamma Brothersdocumentary maximum security prison 10day course in Vipasssana meditation, with 10year follow-up of outcomes.

That's the question facing Phil Connors (Bill Murray, Ghostbusters) who surely gives one of the performances of his career as the cynical, grouchy weatherman of a TV network in this superb comedy.Phil is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania to cover the Groundhog Day festivities, but ends up being trapped in the town when a freak blizzard strikes and he is unable to go home. Things get even weirder when he wakes up the next day, and finds it is Groundhog Day, again.And again... and again....It is a great credit to director Harold Ramis and the screenwriters that this film is consistently hilarious and fresh, despite having essentially just 1 joke in it. It really had me laughing out loud in places because of the supremely witty script and some of the escapades in the film, and there's something so funny about the way Phil is first puzzled it is the same day again, then bewildered or angry, then discovers he can change his persona each time he lives through Groundhog Day to suit his needs - even if manipulating his day to win the heart of cheerful producer Rita (Andie McDowell) is not quite so easy...Andie's performance in the film is very good and her romance with Bill Murray's character is sweetly believable, the pair have nice chemistry between them.Poor Phil has to resort to desperate measures to make it become the next day which can be very funny indeed, and even though his character is cynical and has an arrogant, even cruel, streak in the beginning you feel sorry for him as the film goes on which, again, I feel is a sign of excellent writing. We are at one with Phil, seeing the film through his eyes - we want him to succeed and end up with Rita.I loved the ""repeated"" scenes in the film, showing how his reaction changes (perhaps ironically because they are something you know is going to happen), like the smashing of the clock radio playing I Got You, Babe. That scene never fails to make me laugh.I think the film even poses interesting questions beneath the gags - how would you live your life if you had free reign to what you wanted, with no consequences? Would you be happy?Through his experiences, Phil gradually changes his outlook, becoming a more compassionate, nicer person and tries his best to help the people around him instead of just thinking of himself. A simple moral message perhaps, but told so well, and paced perfectly that allows for touching scenes and nice character development. The film isn't preachy, but the fact it has this lesson, which you kind of follow along with Phil, makes for a deeper experience.I think the message of the film (in order to find happiness, Bill Murray has to change, be a nicer person and like himself) spiritual and meaningful - this surprised me because I'm not religious.It's certainly one of my favourite films, one of the best comedies ever - and a modern American classic that I love.",5,One of the best comedies ever made!,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,3085,"['Where', 'everybody', 'going', 'Gobbler', 'Knob', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'still', 'just', 'once', 'year', ""n't"", 'What', 'would', 'do', 'found', 'had', 'live', 'same', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'question', 'facing', 'Phil', 'Connors', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Ghostbusters', 'who', 'surely', 'one', 'performances', 'career', 'cynical', 'grouchy', 'weatherman', 'TV', 'network', 'superb', 'comedy.Phil', 'sent', 'small', 'town', 'Punxsutawney', 'Pennsylvania', 'cover', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'festivities', 'up', 'being', 'trapped', 'town', 'when', 'freak', 'blizzard', 'strikes', 'unable', 'go', 'home', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'weirder', 'when', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'again.And', 'again', 'again', '.It', 'great', 'credit', 'director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'screenwriters', 'film', 'consistently', 'hilarious', 'fresh', 'having', 'essentially', 'just', '1', 'joke', 'really', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'places', 'supremely', 'witty', 'script', 'escapades', 'film', 'something', 'so', 'funny', 'way', 'Phil', 'first', 'puzzled', 'same', 'day', 'again', 'then', 'bewildered', 'angry', 'then', 'can', 'change', 'persona', 'time', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'suit', 'needs', 'even', 'manipulating', 'day', 'win', 'heart', 'cheerful', 'producer', 'Rita', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'easy', 'Andie', 'performance', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'romance', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'sweetly', 'believable', 'pair', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'them.Poor', 'Phil', 'resort', 'desperate', 'measures', 'make', 'become', 'next', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'indeed', 'even', 'character', 'cynical', 'arrogant', 'even', 'cruel', 'streak', 'beginning', 'feel', 'sorry', 'film', 'again', 'feel', 'sign', 'excellent', 'writing', 'are', 'one', 'Phil', 'seeing', 'film', 'eyes', 'want', 'succeed', 'end', 'up', 'Rita.I', 'loved', 'repeated', 'scenes', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'reaction', 'changes', 'perhaps', 'ironically', 'are', 'something', 'know', 'going', 'happen', 'smashing', 'clock', 'radio', 'playing', 'Got', 'Babe', 'scene', 'never', 'make', 'laugh.I', 'think', 'film', 'even', 'interesting', 'questions', 'gags', 'how', 'would', 'live', 'life', 'had', 'free', 'reign', 'what', 'wanted', 'consequences', 'Would', 'be', 'happy', 'experiences', 'Phil', 'gradually', 'outlook', 'becoming', 'more', 'compassionate', 'person', 'best', 'help', 'people', 'instead', 'just', 'thinking', 'simple', 'moral', 'message', 'perhaps', 'told', 'so', 'well', 'paced', 'perfectly', 'touching', 'scenes', 'nice', 'character', 'development', 'film', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'fact', 'lesson', 'kind', 'follow', 'Phil', 'deeper', 'experience.I', 'think', 'message', 'film', 'order', 'find', 'happiness', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'change', 'be', 'nicer', 'person', 'spiritual', 'meaningful', 'surprised', ""'m"", 'not', 'religious.It', 'certainly', 'one', 'favourite', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'ever', 'modern', 'American', 'classic', 'love']",N/A

165995,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,080017948X,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[122, 128]","I might be making a bold claim saying this is the best Bill Murray film of them all. Many people would call me on that with films that showcase his sophomoric hijinks like Stripes or Ghostbusters. Some may look at his more slightly more refined character works like What About Bob? and Scrooged as their hits. To me Groundhog Day tops them all. This is because not only do you have Bill Murray doing a perfect performance, but also because the content itself (and the writing behind it) takes this movie to the next level.Groundhog Day is a morality piece done in the vein of a classic Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode. I kind of ""what if...?"" sort of tale that puts a generally successful and selfish man (played by Murray) into a hopeless situation of never being able to escape a single day in a small town. On the surface the story it looks like a situation comedy with Murray's character living the same Groundhog Day over and over. However the further you go into the movie you get some true and believable character development. The fact Bill pulls it off convincingly as well as with his classic entertaining wit is what makes the movie shine.Don't think of the movie as just some lesson to learn and take with you. While it does have that they don't preach it to you. You figure the lessons out along with Phil (Murray), and that makes for a rather deep experience. The movie at its core is a comedy, and it's such a good comedy it's rating among the top comedies of all time by various film associations. It's not just a comedy either as it also has a healthy dose of romance in it. So much romance that it can pass off as a ""chick flick"" for those who are into that. So I guess you can say Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy/Twilight-Zonesque/morality play.The other actors do great as well, including co-star Andie MacDowell, supporting actors Chris Elliot (as the cameraman), Brian Doyle-Murray (mayor of the city) Stephen Tobolowsky (old high school associate) and others. The movie was directed by Murray's cohort in Ghostbusters and Stripes Harold Ramis, which makes me wonder if the role was made for Bill. Production itself is very solid. You won't find it winning awards for costumes, sets or special effects. At the same time you won't find any production values detracting from the story; they only serve to enhance it.This 15th Anniversary Edition will be digitally remastered (overseen by Ramis himself) and will include a host of special features including:- Commentary by director Harold Ramis (not sure if it's a new commentary or if it will be the same commentary from the last Special Edition DVD)- The Study of Groundhogs: A Real Life Look at Marmots- A Different Day: An Interview with Harold Ramis- Making of Documentary- Weight of Time documentary- Newly discovered deleted scenesThe Weight of Time documentary was in the Special Edition DVD, but aside from that and the commentary this DVD has all new special features.

166001,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,080017948X,Steve,"[3, 3]","I have seen most of Bill Murray's films and I generally love most of them. With all of those great films, I consider Groundhog Day his best and it is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. Bill Murray is at his greatest in this movie because herein he channels all of his talent into the role of Phil the jaded and bitter weather man from a Pittsburgh tv station.The story is a simple one of redemption and changing the path one's life is on and Murray takes this relatively simple and perhaps predictable plot line and delivers a charming and engaging performance that is never maudlin, never exaggerated and never phony. As the repetition of the day continues, Murray's Phil transforms from frightened non-believer, to scheming opportunist, to crazed suicidal maniac, and finally to a man who finally understands why this bizarre circumstance is happening to him. The movie is never heavy-handed or preachy. It is subtle, introspective, and genuine. This is a perfect vehicle for both the earlier Stripes version of Bill Murray as well as the latter day one that did so well in Lost in Translation. This gem is truly one of those eternal movies that can be watched for generations to come as you do with the really great ones. Like the crazed reality of Phil's situation, Groundhog Day can be experienced over and over and over again and always satisfy.Groundhog Day is a movie that touches your soul as well as your funny bone, and makes you feel alive and inspired. How many movies do that and are this heartwarming and fun?As for special features, I buy dvds because I want to see the movie, not because I want to watch a bunch of interviews, play games with my dvd remote control, or listen to commentaries. If they are there and they are worthwhile, so much the better, but if they are not, I still am glad I own the movie and the lack of special features would never alter my decision to buy a movie. Groundhog Day is worth owning in whatever format you can find it.

There is only one joke in the film and it repeats itself over and over.  Knowing this, you might think that this film just wouldn't work.  After all who wants to see the same joke over and over for an hour and a half?  Yet, ""Groundhog Day"" does work and it works admirably.  Both Ramis and star Bill Murray have figured out that it's not the joke itself that will make the film work - it is how the joke is delivered.Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman less than enthused with the assignment given him -  heading out to Punxsutawney, Pa. to see if groundhog Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow.  Connors couldn't care less if the nation will have six more weeks of winter and his disdain for the whole event is palatable.  Like a good soldier, Connors nevertheless wakes up and does the remote broadcast.  He goes to bed that night glad to be finished with his task.  However, he awakens the next day and discovers it is Groundhog Day again.  He shrugs this off as some kind of bad dream until he realizes the same thing happens the next morning . . . and the next morning . . . and the next morning.Murray is horrified in the early going as tries to escape the hellish time warp he finds himself in.  Then when it might seem that there is no way out, Murray starts to accept his situation . . . and then completely takes advantage of it with hilarious results.  Amidst the chaos he causes, Conners makes sure to set aside time to woo the local women but finds that he truly longs for his news producer Rita (Andie MacDowell).  As the days keep repeating one after another, Connors decides to use his foreknowledge to make himself a better person in order to win her heart.""Groundhog Day"" never bothers to provide an explanation to its events but that actually helps matters as it enhances the fairy tale-like quality of the film.  The film plays more like a romantic morality tale than a ""Twilight Zone"" episode and is all the better for it.  It is a story of the heart rather than a story of the mind.  Watching Murray perform his role seamlessly is a pleasant reminder of how good he was in ""Stripes"" all those years ago and is proof that he is still a talented comedian and actor.  MacDowell is also charming in her role and Chris Elliott is solid in his supporting part.  Yet, it's Murray who makes the film work and ""Groundhog Day"" is one of those shining cinematic examples of the right actor being cast in the right film.",4,"Well, what if there is no tomorrow?

It should just be a quick, though unpleasant job and then he is on his way to bigger things.He has no idea what he is in for.The idea of the time loop has been used on many occasions since this movie, but few (if any) have done it as well. In fact, I venture to say that this movie jump started the genre. For even if it was not the first (I am not sure of that point) it was certainly one of the best.Watching Bill Murray's frustration with the townspeople at the beginning was cute, but it does not really pick up until Bill begins to realize that he is living in a world without consequences ... and the depression that follows as he realizes what that means.Bill's journey is fantastic. And it holds up to repeated viewings. I enjoy not only the situational humor, but the way that Bill's character comes to love the town and its inhabitants.It is a fun movie. It is a funny movie.Parents, no nudity. Some profanity. Not excessive by my tastes but yours may vary.

It should be up there with the classics like &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; -- except that people don't normally think of settling down to watch movies on February 2nd!The set up is wonderfully original.  A day, repeated over and over, and not even a nice day, not even a special day, but February 2nd, in a small town in Pennsylvania, in a place our weatherman hates.  And our weatherman fights against it in every which way he can -- trying to amuse himself with stealing money, riding on railroad tracks, using his knowledge to sleep with women (heck, he only has one day in which he can woo them), theorizing that he has to kill the groundhog in order to end his repetitious hell, and finally trying to kill himself, over and over, out of despair.  Finally he learns to accept it, uses his time wisely, and then starts truly giving to people, becomes a real member of the town which he originally hated.The idea could have gotten old, though, if the acting or the directing had been less than perfect, but it is not; it is wonderful instead, with nuance after nuance.  Even when it feels forced, as if Bill Murray is acting, it works, because our weatherman would have felt as if he were acting as he repeated the day over and over.  One of the sweetest moments comes near the end as Murray says: &quot;I said stay and you stayed?  I can't even make a collie stay.&quot;Most of all, it makes you think, with dalogue like: &quot;I'm a God.  I'm not THE God.

Often I feel that we are in a pattern, a cycle that appears to repeat over and over.  During this discussion, I remembered the film Groundhog Day.  This movie describers the life of many people who have little variety in their life.Groundhog day tell the story of an egotistical but  bored TV weatherman (Bill Murray)  who is assigned to cover the annual celebration in  Punxsutawney , Pennsylvania.  Phil Connors (Bill Murray) begins as a difficult character, he is rude, self centered and arrogant.  He does not wish to be in Punxsutawney, doesn't think covering a ""big rat's"" prediction of the weather is worthy of a professional like himself.  He has a negative attitude and shows it.Phil awakens day two to discover that it is Groundhog day again.  At first he does not believe and rejects the day and its activities.  It keeps happening and Phil becomes a bit unglued - each day he tries a new approach to his new reality.Eventually he accepts his new reality and lives with it.  His journey to acceptance is a fun trip.  Bill Murray is hilarious as he rejects reality, and slowly tests himself and his environment.  He even tries various suicide methods, always seems to die from the attempt, but awaking at the start of Groundhog day.  His eventually solution is almost redeeming and out of his old self's character.I recommend this film.
