855236,A3REUILBAGPS06,B00061I294,Freth,"[23, 25]","Snipes plays an ex spec ops officer trying to cope with the loss of one of his men (who happens to have been his best friend).  They were captured and Snipes was forced to make the ultimate decision - either let his friend die by being burned alive, or give him the order to step off a stool and hang himself.  Snipes was forced to give the order to step forward and has never forgiven himself since.His love interest, his friend's sister, doesn't know the circumstances behind her brother's death, but insists that Snipes visit a focus group to try and deal with the loss.  Snipes tries, but he ends up calling her and asking her to meet him at a diner so he can finally tell her what really happened to her brother.Snipes shows up at the restaurant early and is mistaken for another man.  CIA operatives shoot him up with an experimental hallucinogenic drug that kills the victim in 6 hours, but makes them highly succeptible to suggestion.As it turns out the CIA made a big mistake and Snipes escapes from the facility.  The rest is a cat/mouse chase and a race to find the antidote before it's too late.By today's standards this is a tame movie, but if you're a fan of Wesley Snipes you'll enjoy this film.  It's low budget, but it's a lot better than other offerings I've seen.  It's popcorn entertainment, but don't expect any big fights or a lot of action---something they could've elaborated on a bit.

855237,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00061I294,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","UNSTOPPABLE is a disappointing exercise of how trying to cover a routine story with a lot of camera and time-lapse gimmicks simply cannot save a poor script. Though represented as a low budget film, the special effects crew seems to have blown the budget on the usual incendiary, explosive, blowing-up-fuel-truck-on bridge, burning clothing gimmicks that are by now tired at best.Wesley Snipes tries to save this tale of a war veteran at odds with his conscience over duties performed while on duty who accidentally becomes involved in a caper involving bad guys and injectable drugs so evil that they threaten to be give the owner of the drug complete control over everyone's mind. Mistaken identity, good guy with guilt becoming a transient bad guy under drug influence under chase by the drug lords, CIA, FBI, and police (who just happen to be on Snipes' side for reasons less dramatic) - all of these are thrown into the blender and out comes soup.The supporting cast has some familiar faces - Jacquelyn Obradores (NYPD Blues), Vincent Riotta ('Under the Tuscan Sun', 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin'), Adewale Akinnuoye-Abaje (remember Adebisi in 'OZ'?) and given the pedestrian script, these and others give good performances. The problems (and there are many) include out-of-focus camera work to make us 'feel' the effect of the drug injected into Snipes' character and the imagined vs real footage that intermingles at a maddening rate to clutter the progress of the action.A film for those who love Wesley Snipes and for those who can buy into yet another mindless action flick.

I like him, but it is true that he might be heading for the straight-to-video land where many action film stars are gone, and never come back.Snipes plays an ex-special agent Dean Cage who was in Bosnia, where his last mission went terribly wrong.  He managed to come back alive, but is feeling guilty of the past, and his relations with his girlfriend (and a local cop) Amy (Jacoueline Obradors, 'Six Days, Seven Nights') are far from smooth.  Sounds familiar?  It is, and you have to wait a while for the actions to start.They start when Cage is mistaken for another man at a diner.  Some corrupt guys in suits (and hiding in Baltimore City ambulance ... don't ask me why), misidentifying the target, inject some substance into Cage's body -- making him dizzy and half-unconscious.  (Oh, and the film is set in Baltimore, and you see a diner with a big crab, but it was in fact shot in Bulgaria.)Actions (all standard ones, like shoot-outs and explosions) are not bad, but all the scenes are shot at night, so you might dislike the continuing murky darkness.  But the filmmakers seem to have spent most of the budget in showing the so-so actions, for the other parts seem badly neglected, when they should have been more careful about them.  The strange, flashy cameraworks only reduce the tension, and in one scene, to express the nasty effects of the injected material, we are to share POV of the ex-agent Cage -- that means, we see the scenes quickly swtching between a hospital office and a military prison one after the other,  That is surely unusual, trying to give us the sense of hullcination.  But it's only irritating.Director David Carson ('Star Trek: Generations' -- odd number entry!) throws in these gimmicks, but they cannot completely hide the familiar touch of the underdeveloped B film, or the sense of 'We have seen it before,' especially the last 20 minutes.  The baddies played by Stuart Wilson and Kim Coates are just ordinary -- a bad guy in charge of the whole situation, and another bad guy who does dirty business.  And as to Wesley Snipes, there is nothing that would remind us of the charisma of the vimpire slayer.I still remember Wesley Snipes in Spike Lee films, and the entertaining 'Passanger 57' and 'Drop Zone.'  And I didn't hate 'Demolition Man.'  But watching him in 'Unstoppable' makes me think that he might (just, might for now, OK?) on the way to be the next Seagal.
