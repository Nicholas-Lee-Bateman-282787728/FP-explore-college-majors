Selleck is Jon Aldrich,a Chicago stockbroker with a wife and two young children. Jon has parents(Anne Jackson and the late Don Ameche) in a Florida nursing home who are residentially taken into the Aldrich household by Jon. Jon's dad suffers from Alzheimer's and constantly craves McDonald's food. The dad once owned and operated a shoe store which was later taken over and sold by Jon. The sale occured as a result of the neighborhood change. The dad also follows Jon almost everywhere Jon goes and the dad is unknowingly wandering around town despite the dangerous situations. Jon's divorced sister Arlene(Christine Ebersole) has two obnoxious pre-teen sons who of course,behave obnoxiously when they and their mother show up at the Aldriches' home. Arlene becomes romantically involved with one of the Aldriches' neighbors(the late Robert Pastorelli). One funny scene was where Jon injured one of his testicles in an accident. It is surgically removed,which led to Jon exclaiming in his hospital bed,""I only have one nut!"". A very funny family film! Ameche died at age 85 in 1993 and Pastorelli,late of the CBS sitcom ""Murphy Brown"", committed suicide last year. Selleck,without a moustache is also seen in 1997's IN & OUT and the 2000 TV movie RUNNING MATES.",5,A funny family film!,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1391,"['Oh', 'goodness', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'longtime', 'moustache', 'missing', 'what', 'hell', 'looked', 'handsome', 'did', 'Selleck', 'Jon', 'Aldrich', 'Chicago', 'stockbroker', 'wife', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'Jon', 'parents', 'Anne', 'Jackson', 'late', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'Florida', 'nursing', 'home', 'who', 'are', 'residentially', 'taken', 'Aldrich', 'household', 'Jon', 'Jon', 'dad', 'suffers', 'Alzheimer', 'constantly', 'McDonald', 'food', 'dad', 'once', 'owned', 'operated', 'shoe', 'store', 'was', 'later', 'taken', 'over', 'sold', 'Jon', 'sale', 'occured', 'result', 'neighborhood', 'change', 'dad', 'also', 'Jon', 'almost', 'everywhere', 'Jon', 'dad', 'unknowingly', 'wandering', 'around', 'town', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'Jon', 'divorced', 'sister', 'Arlene', 'Christine', 'Ebersole', 'two', 'obnoxious', 'pre-teen', 'sons', 'who', 'course', 'behave', 'obnoxiously', 'when', 'mother', 'show', 'up', 'Aldriches', 'home', 'Arlene', 'romantically', 'involved', 'one', 'Aldriches', 'neighbors', 'late', 'Robert', 'Pastorelli', 'One', 'funny', 'scene', 'was', 'where', 'Jon', 'injured', 'one', 'testicles', 'accident', 'surgically', 'removed', 'led', 'Jon', 'exclaiming', 'hospital', 'bed', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'nut', 'very', 'funny', 'family', 'film', 'Ameche', 'died', 'age', '85', '1993', 'Pastorelli', 'late', 'CBS', 'sitcom', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'committed', 'suicide', 'last', 'year', 'Selleck', 'moustache', 'also', 'seen', '1997', 'IN', 'OUT', '2000', 'TV', 'movie', 'RUNNING', 'MATES']",N/A
