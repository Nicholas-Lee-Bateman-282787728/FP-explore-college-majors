703727,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B000067R6E,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[16, 19]","My under 5 year olds LOVE this movie. They find it spell binding and on rainy days they like this or just about any of the Barbie movies to go on. As an adult I find it one of the less entertaining Barbie movies, but it has some really good points to it.It is one of the first of the Barbie movies and is set in the 'fantasy' world of the sevententh century, a time of magic and dragons. It is very very loosely based around the story of Rapunzel although the only real reference to Rapunzel is that she lives in a tower, has long hair and has a Rapunzel style dream sequence.It is very fairy tale beginning - beautiful girl forced to do chores for a step-mother character - (who is ably voiced by Angelica Houston). I really like the animal sidekicks here - Penelope the dragon and Hobie the Hare who are her friends and allies in all things.Rapunzel lives in isolation, working for Gottel, her stepmother, until one day by accident she discovers that not only are her parents not dead, but she can escape from the castle - which she does - ending up in a  nearby village. There she meets a Prince and finds out that the prince and his father the king have been in constant battle with the neighbouring kingdom. She asks the simple question why - but it is answerable. Gottel finds out where she has been and imprisons her in a tower - but through goodness and friendship Rapunzel prevails.What I really liked about this movie is the importance of friendship and love - which wins through in the end. This values honesty and good values in all things, including believing in yourself and your children, and being able to admit when you are wrong.What I really like best is that Rapunzel wins through in the end - she saves herself, with some help from her friends, but she is the prime mover in her own fate and I think that is so nice.There are some genuinely funny moments and I love some of the animation - the bit where Rapnuzel's dress is changed by Magic is brilliant, and then watching it from outside the tower is a really stunning scene.Overall I would have rated this movie as a 3- 3.5 simply because I find it repetitive and boring - the dancing barbie movies I enjoy much more like swan lake and Princess and the Pauper (which I love). However my Children adore this, and this movie is written for them - so 5 stars it is - we have had it about a year and the novelty hasn't worn off yet.",5,My kids love this movie - I think it is really for under 6 year olds,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,2401,"['5', 'year', 'olds', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'find', 'spell', 'binding', 'rainy', 'days', 'like', 'just', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'go', 'adult', 'find', 'one', 'less', 'entertaining', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'really', 'good', 'points', 'it.It', 'one', 'first', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'set', ""'fantasy"", 'world', 'sevententh', 'century', 'time', 'magic', 'dragons', 'very', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'story', 'Rapunzel', 'only', 'real', 'reference', 'Rapunzel', 'tower', 'long', 'hair', 'Rapunzel', 'style', 'dream', 'sequence.It', 'very', 'fairy', 'tale', 'beginning', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'forced', 'do', 'chores', 'step-mother', 'character', 'who', 'ably', 'voiced', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'really', 'animal', 'sidekicks', 'here', 'Penelope', 'dragon', 'Hobie', 'Hare', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'allies', 'things.Rapunzel', 'isolation', 'working', 'Gottel', 'stepmother', 'one', 'day', 'accident', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'parents', 'not', 'dead', 'can', 'escape', 'castle', 'ending', 'up', 'nearby', 'village', 'Prince', 'out', 'prince', 'father', 'king', 'have', 'been', 'constant', 'battle', 'neighbouring', 'kingdom', 'simple', 'question', 'why', 'answerable', 'Gottel', 'out', 'where', 'been', 'imprisons', 'tower', 'goodness', 'friendship', 'Rapunzel', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'importance', 'friendship', 'love', 'end', 'honesty', 'good', 'values', 'things', 'including', 'believing', 'children', 'being', 'able', 'admit', 'when', 'are', 'wrong.What', 'really', 'best', 'Rapunzel', 'end', 'help', 'friends', 'prime', 'mover', 'own', 'fate', 'think', 'so', 'nice.There', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'love', 'animation', 'bit', 'where', 'Rapnuzel', 'dress', 'changed', 'Magic', 'brilliant', 'then', 'watching', 'tower', 'really', 'stunning', 'scene.Overall', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', '3-', '3.5', 'simply', 'find', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'dancing', 'barbie', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'much', 'more', 'swan', 'lake', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'love', 'However', 'Children', 'adore', 'movie', 'written', 'so', '5', 'stars', 'have', 'had', 'year', 'novelty', ""n't"", 'worn', 'off', 'yet']",N/A

At first I didn't pay much attention to it, but my husband and I just finished watching it with her and I realize now what a well-made and entertaining movie it is.A story-within-a-story, with Barbie narrating to her little sister, Kelly, about a young, honest girl named Rapunzel.  Rapunzel is essentially a prisoner to Gogol, who has ""cared"" for her since she was a baby.  However, one day, fate has a hand in allowing Rapunzel to realize that Gogol lied about Rapunzel's parents being dead.  She explores the village outside the castle walls where she has been imprisoned and discovers, literally, that there is a whole world of love waiting for her.I feel it teaches a good message,too, that of forgiveness.  Despite all Gogol's cruelty, Rapunzel forgives her.  Also, the two neighboring, feuding villages forgive each other when they realize they have been mistaken about an incident in the past.  Only Gogol, who refuses to accept the magnaminous forgiveness and continues in her lies, ultimately becomes a victim of her own black magic.I think girls, particularly, between 4-8 will enjoy this story, but my husband and I also found some parts very amusing as well.

Purple-colored dragons fly naturally through the air. When Rapunzel touches her magic paintbrush to a canvas, live scenes appear magically and vividly. When Gothel the witch uses her evil powers, a tornado of destructive activity makes this obvious.Rapunzel had been kidnapped, and her father, a king, mistakenly blamed another king for it. This led to a long spell of enmity between the two kings, one of whom was named King Wilhelm. No one suspected that it was the witch Gothel who had kidnapped Rapunzel long ago.Gothel treats Rapunzel like a slave, making her do one chore after another. Gothel makes Rapunzel feel that the witch has done her a big favor by raising her. Rapunzel loves to paint, but Gothel disparages her for this, accusing her of wasting her time. At one point, Gothel uses her magic powers to rip Rapunzel's paintings to shreds.Rapunzel discovers a magic paintbrush. It makes scenes happen the moment that she thinks of them and touches the canvas. She uses her magic paintbrush to leave the castle, and she meets Prince Stefan. He develops an immediate liking for her. At one point, when wanting a beautiful dress to wear to the ball, she imagines the dress, touches the magic paintbrush to the canvas, and not only sees the dress but also can wear it.In time, Gothel learns that Rapunzel has a suitor, and is furious about it. As in other fairy tales, the protagonist wants to go to a ball. Prince Stefan, the son of the king falsely accused of having kidnapped Rapunzel, goes there to meet Rapunzel. He encounters Gothel instead. She uses her powers to sting him. Meanwhile, Rapunzel is trapped in a castle tower, forever held in bondage by Gothel's spell. However, there is a way to break the spell, as it does not work on those who are free from dishonesty. Will Rapunzel be able to break the spell and to meet Prince Stefan at the ball? Will the kings learn who actually had kidnapped Rapunzel long ago? Will wicked witch Gothel become trapped as a result of her own dishonesty?

The writers employed cleverness and ingenuity to construct an entertaining and believable story ... while remaining faithful to the spirit and intent of the original.In this version, Rapunzel is held prisoner by the evil sorceress Gothel.  Forced to labor at chores and other work ... and kept from knowing the truth about either her real family or even the world outside the &#34;magic walls&#34; ...  Rapunzel is, for all intents and purposes, a slave to Gothel.  Then Rapunzel accidentally discovers a secret passage that leads to a nearby kingdom where she meets the handsome (and goodhearted) Prince Stefan ... and it is love at first sight ... for both of them.  When Gothel learns of this she is furious.  Still, Rapunzel and Stefan meet again and then arrange to meet a third time at the Prince's castle ... for a masked ball!  And it is at this masked ball that things really start jumping.First, Gothel learns of the ball, locks Rapunzel up in a tower, and goes to the ball disguised as her ... with the intent of killing Stefan.  Next, a rival kingdom decides, at that moment, to invade Prince Stefan's kingdom, and they burst into the ballroom right in the middle of the celebration.  Barbie ... I mean Rapunzel ... manages to escape from the tower, and she arrives at the ball just in time to save the day.  Happy ending.Just about every aspect of &#34;Barbie as Rapunzel&#34; is pretty nice.  Angelica Huston is excellent as the evil Gothel.  Kelly Sheridan is perfect as Barbie/Rapunzel.  Prince Stefan is very well done by Mark Hildreth.  And David Kaye is superb as Hugo the dragon.Just one small itsy bitsy complaint:  They (the movie's producers) dumb down the guys and sass up the girls.  I think this is a mistake.  No no.  They leave Barbie alone ... thankfully.  She is perfect.  But Penelope (Rapunzel's friend, the little dragon) for example, is made to be impolite (always to guys) and too afraid when confronted with a challenge (to garner undue sympathy).  Why couldn't they simply have given her a good solid character?  I know the answer:  Patronize your target audience.Anyway, &#34;Barbie as Rapunzel&#34; is a good solid 83 minutes of entertainment.

Still, it's a good story, nicely captured in computer-aided animation.The villains are often the highlights of these Barbie films, and Anjelica Huston's performance here is right in step with that tradition.  Her ""anguish"" scene has spurred much imitation in our family (in a good way).  She isn't quite up to the level of Martin Short's immortal Preminger in Princess/Pauper, but who is?The dragons are particularly well animated, and there's a fine subplot involving father/daughter relationships, conveyed through the dragons.

With the help of her friends, Hobie the rabbit, and Penelope the dragon (whose father is Hugo, guardian of the castle), she finds her way to the outside world and meets Prince Stefan in a palace garden.When Gothel learns of her misdeed, Rapunzel is trapped in a tower with no hope of escape.  Her silver hairbrush is touched by magic and becomes a paintbrush that forms paintings that can take one anywhere so of course, Rapuzel goes back to the garden in the hopes of finding Prince Stefan.  He invites her to a masked ball and while dressing in the tower, she is found out by Gothel.What happens from there is, believe it or not, a story of love, betrayal, and redemption.  I enjoyed it just as much as my 3-year old!  There were just a couple of scenes where she was frightened by Gothel (one in particular during the dream sequence where the Prince asks Rapunzel to let down her hair and a giant Gothel captures her in her hand).All in all, this is another awesome Barbie DVD and like I said in my Barbie Nutcracker (also very worth watching)review, I hope there are many more Barbie movies to come!",5,Beautiful animation of a classic fairy tale.,1033430400,"10 1, 2002",2002,1390,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'again', 'Now', 'enchanting', 'Barbie', 'Nutcracker', 'have', 'Barbie', 'Rapunzel', 'former', 'movie', 'computer', 'animated', 'glory', 'movie', 'Rapunzel', 'kept', 'captive', 'witch', 'Gothel', 'castle', 'magical', 'wall', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'past', 'help', 'friends', 'Hobie', 'rabbit', 'Penelope', 'dragon', 'father', 'Hugo', 'guardian', 'castle', 'way', 'outside', 'world', 'meets', 'Prince', 'Stefan', 'palace', 'garden.When', 'Gothel', 'misdeed', 'Rapunzel', 'trapped', 'tower', 'hope', 'escape', 'silver', 'hairbrush', 'touched', 'magic', 'paintbrush', 'paintings', 'can', 'take', 'one', 'anywhere', 'so', 'course', 'Rapuzel', 'back', 'garden', 'hopes', 'finding', 'Prince', 'Stefan', 'masked', 'ball', 'dressing', 'tower', 'found', 'out', 'Gothel.What', 'believe', 'not', 'story', 'love', 'betrayal', 'redemption', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', '3-year', 'old', 'were', 'just', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'frightened', 'Gothel', 'one', 'particular', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'Prince', 'Rapunzel', 'let', 'down', 'hair', 'giant', 'Gothel', 'hand', '.All', 'awesome', 'Barbie', 'DVD', 'said', 'Barbie', 'Nutcracker', 'also', 'very', 'worth', 'watching', 'review', 'hope', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'come']",N/A

Everything has a class to it and a finesse that is rarely seen even in the big studio features nowadays.If you have a little girl, I highly recommend this movie.
