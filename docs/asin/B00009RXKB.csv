757474,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B00009RXKB,A Customer,"[3, 5]","Based on a short story by Henry James, about an expatriate American living in Europe. Daisy Miller, her mother, and her little brother. All incurable chatterboxes. Their ""liberated behavior,"" according to the cover, ""scandalize the Victorian high society of 1878."" Ooooo-kay...Actually, the short story was quite probably very good. The wit, the banter, the skewering of stuffy European aristocracy. In the tradition of Jane Austen, William Makepeace Thackeray and Oscar Wilde, and I'm too lazy to see who did it first.The movie is an accurate portrayal of the story, and a costumed period film that, according to the interview with Peter Bogdanovich, was ahead of its time that way. I believe him. I also think that such a story is damn hard to remain faithful to, and I'm impressed with the effort. Bogdanovich is himself an American of European upbringing, which helped him do the story justice.I have one complaint. Daisy Miller was refreshingly honest and innocent. Fair enough. But I think Cybil Shepherd played it a bit too 20th century America and not enough 19th century America. I'd call her annoying. But it doesn't hurt the film as much as you might think it would.Her costar, Barry Brown in the role of Frederick Winterborne, was flawless. In the film, he didn't know if he was American or European, and he never figured out Daisy. The tension between those two was done well. In real life, Brown read obits between takes and wound up killing himself. Sheez.Bogdanovich brought most of his other cast members from THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, which I bashed mercilessly in an earlier issue of this rag. They did a damn fine job here, though, and I was glad to see it.The boy was played by Jerry McMurtry, son of Larry McMurtry, author of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Guess what? I love this evil child, and I never say that about child actors. Keep an eye on this dude.(Oops! 1974 movie.

757475,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00009RXKB,Byron Kolln,"[7, 8]","Peter Bogdanovich's screen version of the classic Henry James novella DAISY MILLER, originally panned and dismissed by most film critics upon it's original release in 1974, has now thankfully started to receive the recognition and praise that it justly deserves.  No doubt this new DVD release will be welcomed by fans and embraced by newcomers alike as they enter Daisy's magical world.Cybill Shepherd stars as an upper-class American girl on holiday in Europe circa. 1876, who falls in love with expatriate Winterbourne (Barry Brown) a cold and detached man who does not (or cannot) register or return her feelings of admiration and love. Daisy's free-spirited lifestyle clashes with the social sensibilities of the era as she exposes her family to scandal and disgrace.  Some fine support from Cloris Leachman, Eileen Brennan, Mildred Natwick, Duilio Del Prete; and lavish location footage from Switzerland and Italy add immeasurably to the story.At the time of the original release, much of the critical poison was aimed unfairly at Cybill Shepherd (Bogdanovich's partner and protege at the time), who was actually perfect casting for the title role.  If one goes back to the Henry James story and then revisits the movie, the similarities are innumerable.  Shepherd personifies James' heroine to a tee and gives a mesmerising performance.Paramount's DVD includes a new interview with director Peter Bogdanovich, as well as an audio commentary with him.",5,"""She was the most innocent""",1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1457,"['Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'screen', 'version', 'classic', 'Henry', 'James', 'novella', 'DAISY', 'MILLER', 'originally', 'panned', 'dismissed', 'most', 'film', 'critics', 'original', 'release', '1974', 'now', 'thankfully', 'started', 'receive', 'recognition', 'praise', 'justly', 'doubt', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'be', 'welcomed', 'fans', 'embraced', 'newcomers', 'alike', 'enter', 'Daisy', 'magical', 'world.Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'upper-class', 'American', 'girl', 'holiday', 'Europe', 'circa', '1876', 'who', 'love', 'expatriate', 'Winterbourne', 'Barry', 'Brown', 'cold', 'detached', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'register', 'return', 'feelings', 'admiration', 'love', 'Daisy', 'free-spirited', 'lifestyle', 'clashes', 'social', 'sensibilities', 'era', 'family', 'scandal', 'disgrace', 'fine', 'support', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'Duilio', 'Del', 'Prete', 'lavish', 'location', 'footage', 'Switzerland', 'Italy', 'add', 'immeasurably', 'story.At', 'time', 'original', 'release', 'much', 'critical', 'poison', 'was', 'aimed', 'unfairly', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'Bogdanovich', 'partner', 'protege', 'time', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'perfect', 'casting', 'title', 'role', 'one', 'back', 'Henry', 'James', 'story', 'then', 'movie', 'similarities', 'are', 'innumerable', 'Shepherd', 'James', 'heroine', 'tee', 'mesmerising', 'performance.Paramount', 'DVD', 'new', 'interview', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'commentary']",N/A
757476,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00009RXKB,David Baldwin,"[6, 8]","I came to this film not as a fan of costume drama but to examine all aspects of director Peter Bogdanovich's repertoire.  I'm convinced that Bogdanovich was at least 15 or 20 years ahead of his time before this genre became vogue among cineastes. This filmization of Henry James' novella would make a terrific trifecta with Martin Scorsese's ""The Age of Innocence"" and another adaptation of James, ""The Wings of the Dove"".  I'm more than convinced that Bogdanovich's relationship with his star, Cybill Shepherd, soured critics and audiences into giving this film a fair shot.  This is unfortunate because Shepherd is more than terrific as Daisy, perfectly capturing the impulsiveness and innocence of a young girl whose apparent actions flaunt the conventions of ""proper society"".  Barry Brown as Winterbourne perfectly captures the stodginess of his character but does by no means deliver a stiff performance.  The supporting cast(Cloris Leachman, Eileen Brennan, Mildred Natwick, James McMurtry) are impeccable.  If ever a film deserves to be re-evaluated ""Daisy Miller"" is it.

757477,A1N83RWL4634UN,B00009RXKB,"Dragon Irish ""Canny Celt""","[3, 5]","This film is remarkable. It is not James, however close to the original plot it may dance. I don't believe with others that this film is a masterpiece. Bogdanovich overlays Henry James with Oscar Wilde. It doesn't work perfectly, but it gives you a variation on a theme, especially intriguing with James. (A well-known author once averred to me that the success of television's The Golden Bowl came from the director putting the sex James had so meticulously avoided back in the story.) Daisy doesn't have the sonority of James. Yet, it is its own James, a cut at James. The filmmaker makes his own oeuvre.-Excellent cinematography. The director has used the camera - as he did in The Last Picture Show, but totally changed here - to present scenes that flow with the story and imprint themselves on the mind. The silent scene in which Frederick is seen through the lace curtain of the door window receiving the news, the barely heard 'morto,' held a moment longer than usual is sheer art.The acting all takes the same tone of rapid speech, almost patter, and the quality is superb, quite musical. It is not the kind of thing Americans would like. They don't understand anything that is not street-real or living-room postured. -Marvelous performances by Mildred Natwick, Cloris Leachman, and Eileen Brennan. Cybill Shepherd is remarkable. I never suspected she had that much talent. Barry Brown achieves the persona the director wanted, though he lacks the internal solidity - not maturity - of a Jamesian young man. Only at the end do you sense his awareness of his own and his society's corruption. He doesn't quite seem to earn his consciousness of it. But it still fits within Bogdanovich's framework.I applaud any director of an American film willing to try a different brush, a new stroke, without the idiocy of affectation. Thus, I find it a four, and throw in a one for bravery. (I've done that before somewhere.) It is a film to be watched again, however flawed, just for the characterizations, and of course, if you are a lover of women, for the four beauties present, especially Cybill Shepherd. There are few presentations of the beauty of the American girl, at least the American girl in times past without the potty mouth and exposed belly, as rare as this. Her brazenness and innocence are balanced to a fault.I just surfed up the acerbic reviews and biographies concerning this film, e.g. IMDB, and sense as in the past, almost every year viewing the Academy Awards - though not all - that Hollywood suffers most from what Bogdanovich is accused of - playing in its own appetites. I have led a long life and watched many interesting films die of American arrogance, gossip, prejudice, and nastiness. So be it. One of the lessons of my life has been how much good to excellent art has been flushed down the toilet of indifference of the times. Let me say that, if you leave your prejudices at the door, this film is well worth watching. And again to repeat - forgive me! - if you love women, you will see a range of beauty in the women in this film (most of them older) that is remarkable.Finally, Peter Bogdanovich's career is not unlike a parody of his mentor's, Orson Welles. Cut down in his genius prime, Welles became a personality, but never made a great film after Citizen Kane. Bogdanovich got caught in love - and who can blame him? - and opprobrium early enough to send him reeling into worse and worse mistakes, until any value he had as a director was lost. But it was not - pace critics and pundits - Daisy Miller that really did him in.",5,Another 4 Plus 1 for Courage,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,3566,"['film', 'remarkable', 'not', 'James', 'however', 'close', 'original', 'plot', 'may', 'dance', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'others', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'Bogdanovich', 'Henry', 'James', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', ""n't"", 'work', 'perfectly', 'variation', 'theme', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'James', 'well-known', 'author', 'once', 'averred', 'success', 'television', 'Golden', 'Bowl', 'came', 'director', 'putting', 'sex', 'James', 'had', 'so', 'meticulously', 'avoided', 'back', 'story', 'Daisy', ""n't"", 'have', 'sonority', 'James', 'own', 'James', 'cut', 'James', 'filmmaker', 'own', 'oeuvre.-Excellent', 'cinematography', 'director', 'used', 'camera', 'did', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'totally', 'changed', 'here', 'present', 'scenes', 'flow', 'story', 'imprint', 'mind', 'silent', 'scene', 'Frederick', 'seen', 'lace', 'curtain', 'door', 'window', 'receiving', 'news', 'barely', 'heard', ""'morto"", 'held', 'moment', 'longer', 'usual', 'sheer', 'acting', 'same', 'tone', 'rapid', 'speech', 'almost', 'patter', 'quality', 'superb', 'quite', 'musical', 'not', 'kind', 'thing', 'Americans', 'would', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anything', 'not', 'street-real', 'living-room', 'postured', '-Marvelous', 'performances', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'remarkable', 'never', 'suspected', 'had', 'much', 'talent', 'Barry', 'Brown', 'persona', 'director', 'wanted', 'internal', 'solidity', 'not', 'maturity', 'Jamesian', 'young', 'man', 'Only', 'end', 'do', 'sense', 'awareness', 'own', 'society', 'corruption', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'earn', 'consciousness', 'still', 'Bogdanovich', 'framework.I', 'director', 'American', 'film', 'willing', 'try', 'different', 'brush', 'new', 'stroke', 'idiocy', 'affectation', 'Thus', 'find', 'four', 'throw', 'one', 'bravery', ""'ve"", 'done', 'somewhere', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'however', 'flawed', 'just', 'characterizations', 'course', 'are', 'lover', 'women', 'four', 'beauties', 'present', 'especially', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'are', 'few', 'presentations', 'beauty', 'American', 'girl', 'least', 'American', 'girl', 'times', 'potty', 'mouth', 'exposed', 'belly', 'as', 'rare', 'brazenness', 'innocence', 'are', 'balanced', 'fault.I', 'just', 'surfed', 'up', 'acerbic', 'reviews', 'biographies', 'concerning', 'film', 'e.g', 'IMDB', 'sense', 'past', 'almost', 'year', 'viewing', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'suffers', 'most', 'what', 'Bogdanovich', 'accused', 'playing', 'own', 'appetites', 'have', 'led', 'long', 'life', 'watched', 'many', 'interesting', 'films', 'die', 'American', 'arrogance', 'gossip', 'prejudice', 'nastiness', 'So', 'be', 'One', 'lessons', 'life', 'been', 'how', 'much', 'good', 'excellent', 'art', 'been', 'flushed', 'down', 'toilet', 'indifference', 'times', 'Let', 'say', 'leave', 'prejudices', 'door', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'repeat', 'forgive', 'love', 'women', 'will', 'see', 'range', 'beauty', 'women', 'film', 'most', 'older', 'remarkable.Finally', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'career', 'not', 'parody', 'mentor', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Cut', 'down', 'genius', 'prime', 'Welles', 'became', 'personality', 'never', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Bogdanovich', 'got', 'caught', 'love', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'opprobrium', 'early', 'enough', 'send', 'reeling', 'worse', 'worse', 'mistakes', 'value', 'had', 'director', 'was', 'lost', 'was', 'not', 'pace', 'critics', 'pundits', 'Daisy', 'Miller', 'really', 'did']",N/A

After a six-year gap, I returned to the movie recently, and understood once more just what an intriguing piece of work it.  Cybill Shepherd might not be everyone's idea of Daisy; but her breathy delivery and obtrusive presence in many of the shots sums up Daisy's potentially destructive threat to the complacent European world around her. Director Bogdanovich makes the movie as an homage to his then-current girlfriend; while trying to idealize her, he realizes as the action unfolds that she is becoming too big for the film. He thus has to try and imprison her; this he does through group shots in which Cybill/ Daisy is quite literally hemmed in by the male characters.  The fact she is killed off at the end apparently vindicates the strength of the European world (and the male director's power), but Cybill/ Daisy's memory lives on, a tribute to her strength of character.",5,A Movie That Benefits from Repeated Viewings,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,962,"['wrote', 'DAISY', 'MILLER', 'book', 'ADAPTING', 'HENRY', 'JAMES', 'THE', 'SCREEN', '2006', 'six-year', 'gap', 'returned', 'movie', 'recently', 'understood', 'once', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'intriguing', 'piece', 'work', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'idea', 'Daisy', 'breathy', 'delivery', 'obtrusive', 'presence', 'many', 'shots', 'sums', 'up', 'Daisy', 'potentially', 'destructive', 'threat', 'complacent', 'European', 'world', 'Director', 'Bogdanovich', 'movie', 'homage', 'then-current', 'girlfriend', 'trying', 'idealize', 'action', 'becoming', 'too', 'big', 'film', 'thus', 'try', 'imprison', 'group', 'shots', 'Cybill/', 'Daisy', 'quite', 'literally', 'hemmed', 'male', 'characters', 'fact', 'killed', 'off', 'end', 'apparently', 'strength', 'European', 'world', 'male', 'director', 'power', 'Cybill/', 'Daisy', 'memory', 'tribute', 'strength', 'character']",N/A

757480,A26KIF01GEUXBT,B00009RXKB,Kyle Pratt,"[6, 9]","It seems people either love this film or hate it.  I stand, somewhat in the middle.  The movie is an adaptation of Henry James' 1878 novella of the same name.  James had a great idea for his novella.  The plot sets Daisy Miller, an unconventional young American against the norms of Victorian era society.  Is she an innocent free spirit or a woman on the road to social ruin and scandal--or both?The movie was filmed in the beautiful locations James mentions in the story.  The director, Peter Bogdanovich, did an excellent job in setting the scenes.  The cinematography is excellent.  Cybill Shepherd is lovely and the acting is generally superior.The problem with this film is that, as the movie progressed, I began to wonder what Frederick Winterbourne, the point of view character in the novella, saw in Daisy.  Why would he continue to pursue Daisy as she sent him mixed signals and flirted with every young man who crossed her path?  Henry James wrote Daisy as a not particularly bright girl but, in the movie, Cybill Shepherd plays her as an airhead chatterbox.For fans of period movies this is one you will want to see but will probably not often watch.Kyle Pratt",4,A Good Film but Not a Masterpiece,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,1172,"['people', 'either', 'love', 'film', 'hate', 'stand', 'somewhat', 'middle', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Henry', 'James', '1878', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'James', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'novella', 'plot', 'Daisy', 'Miller', 'unconventional', 'young', 'American', 'norms', 'Victorian', 'era', 'society', 'innocent', 'free', 'spirit', 'woman', 'road', 'social', 'ruin', 'scandal', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'James', 'mentions', 'story', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'setting', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'lovely', 'acting', 'generally', 'superior.The', 'problem', 'film', 'that', 'movie', 'progressed', 'began', 'wonder', 'what', 'Frederick', 'Winterbourne', 'point', 'view', 'character', 'novella', 'saw', 'Daisy', 'Why', 'would', 'continue', 'pursue', 'Daisy', 'sent', 'mixed', 'signals', 'flirted', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'crossed', 'path', 'Henry', 'James', 'wrote', 'Daisy', 'not', 'particularly', 'bright', 'girl', 'movie', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'airhead', 'chatterbox.For', 'fans', 'period', 'movies', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'often', 'watch.Kyle', 'Pratt']",N/A
757481,A2KN89AD9G1NNX,B00009RXKB,"Mark D Burgh ""Music, Writing, Art, Film, Hist...","[52, 54]","Peter Bogdanovich chose to make an historical costume film in 1973 against all commerical and critical trends, yet looking at his earlier films, Last Picture Show, What's Up Doc, and Paper Moon, it's not hard to say that all he did direct were historical films--even What's Up Doc has it's roots in the 1930's. Henry James portrait of the quintessential American girl of 1876 struck many as anachronistic, and further allowed the animus arising from Bogdanovich's and Shephard's personal lives cloud their judgement about this film.I think they are all wrong. Cybil Shephard does a remarkable job as Daisy Miller, capturing every maddening nuance that James wrote in his novel. Her performance is shaded, funny, and moving, especially among the group of talented actors surrounding her on this film.  In fact, there is no performer who is miscast or does poorly in the film.A large part of the reason this film works so well is that Bogdanovich and Frederic Raphael stuck closley to James' original text, adding little and fleshing out only in a few key scenes. The use of the actual places James set the story also add the force of the work.I like this film better than the Ivory-Merchant versions of Henry James -The Bostonians - The Europeans - mainly because, unlike Bogdanovich - they seem to have little joy in the actual shooting of a film, whereas Bogdanovich's shot choice and blocking stem from his love of cinema and his knowledge of the art.Daisy Miller is a lost film which anyone interested in the art should watch. Reading the James novel before viewing this helps, but this film captures the book so well, reading the James may not be as necessary as for other adaptations.  The director's commentary is not to be missed either; Bodganovitch is wry, fatalistic, proud, and erudite all at once.  One theme that runs constant betweent the film and commentary is how many of the people involved in the film died young, which is funny in a deeply cosmic way.When I teach Daisy Miller, I will show this film.",5,Underrated Masterpiece -  James Captured.,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,2019,"['Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'chose', 'make', 'historical', 'costume', 'film', '1973', 'commerical', 'critical', 'trends', 'yet', 'looking', 'earlier', 'films', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'What', 'Up', 'Doc', 'Paper', 'Moon', 'not', 'hard', 'say', 'did', 'direct', 'were', 'historical', 'films', 'even', 'What', 'Up', 'Doc', 'roots', '1930', 'Henry', 'James', 'portrait', 'quintessential', 'American', 'girl', '1876', 'struck', 'many', 'anachronistic', 'further', 'allowed', 'animus', 'arising', 'Bogdanovich', 'Shephard', 'personal', 'lives', 'cloud', 'judgement', 'film.I', 'think', 'are', 'wrong', 'Cybil', 'Shephard', 'remarkable', 'job', 'Daisy', 'Miller', 'capturing', 'maddening', 'nuance', 'James', 'wrote', 'novel', 'performance', 'shaded', 'funny', 'moving', 'especially', 'group', 'talented', 'actors', 'surrounding', 'film', 'fact', 'performer', 'who', 'miscast', 'poorly', 'film.A', 'large', 'part', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'Bogdanovich', 'Frederic', 'Raphael', 'stuck', 'closley', 'James', 'original', 'text', 'adding', 'little', 'fleshing', 'out', 'only', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'use', 'actual', 'places', 'James', 'set', 'story', 'also', 'add', 'force', 'work.I', 'film', 'better', 'Ivory-Merchant', 'versions', 'Henry', 'James', '-The', 'Bostonians', 'Europeans', 'mainly', 'Bogdanovich', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'joy', 'actual', 'shooting', 'film', 'Bogdanovich', 'shot', 'choice', 'blocking', 'stem', 'love', 'cinema', 'knowledge', 'art.Daisy', 'Miller', 'lost', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'art', 'should', 'watch', 'Reading', 'James', 'novel', 'viewing', 'helps', 'film', 'book', 'so', 'well', 'reading', 'James', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'necessary', 'other', 'adaptations', 'director', 'commentary', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Bodganovitch', 'wry', 'fatalistic', 'proud', 'erudite', 'once', 'One', 'theme', 'constant', 'betweent', 'film', 'commentary', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'died', 'young', 'funny', 'deeply', 'cosmic', 'way.When', 'teach', 'Daisy', 'Miller', 'will', 'show', 'film']",N/A

Though faithful to its source, ""Daisy Miller"" has an old-fashioned Hollywood feel, showing the influence of Howard Hawks and Orson Welles.As the hapless Daisy, Cybil Shepherd delivers her dialogue in a snappy style reminiscent of classic screwball comedy.  Barry Brown, Eileen Brennan, Cloris Leachman and especially Mildred Natwick shine in supporting roles.  Since the story deals with Americans abroad, you won't hear many British accents in the cast.  Their absence may prove disconcerting to some viewers.Extras are few but choice.

757485,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00009RXKB,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Every so often a film commits suicide before your very eyes. You've heard the rumors of course, but when you see it start you don't quite believe it - after all, the film looks beautiful, the opening sequence is quietly wonderful and, if the leading man is a little stiff and mannered, a lot of that can be put down to the rigors and regulations of polite century in 19th century Europe. And then Cybill Shepard strides across the screen with all the poise of a bartender about to break up a fight in a Deadwood saloon and your heart starts to sink. Then she opens her mouth and you can feel the noose tightening around the film's neck. And as she continues it's not long before it's kicked away the stool and is swinging gasping for breath, choking horribly for the remaining 80 minutes... Daisy Miller may well be a character who is out of her place in old moneyed society, but even Henry James never intended her to be this out of place: if Shepherd were wearing a cheerleader's outfit, jumping on a trampoline and singing ""Yay Mickey/You're so fine/You're so fine you blow my mind"" she couldn't be more wrong as she effortlessly mangles her long stretches of dialogue with an ingenuous lack of awareness of just how horribly bad her performance is.Admittedly it's hard to think of just who could have played the part in 1974 - a young Katherine Hepburn could have done it in her sleep, but she was far from young then - but even if there had been an obvious candidate they wouldn't have stood a chance thanks to Peter Bogdanovich's famous career-destroying infatuation with Shepherd that completely blinds him to how much damage she does to what is already a very slight and all too fragile piece. The framing is often exquisite, but it's almost like watching Da Vinci slap a Groucho moustache and glasses on the Mona Lisa. Rather than a beguiling siren whose unguarded charm blinds the jaded hero to her true nature as he walks a mental tightrope between what he wishes her to be and what society thinks she is, we get an irritating nag who won't shut up for a second as she races through her lines and who would make any halfway sane human being run for the hills as fast as their feet will carry them without a second thought.On one level it's easy to see why this could have worked - a story about Americans playing at being Europeans and of failing to understand not just the rules of acceptable behavior but also the true nature of other people can be seen as mirroring Bogdanovich's situation as he plays Visconti with his new girlfriend. But the script at times feels more like a transcription than an adaptation, never gaining an inner life that could perhaps have mitigated its lack of a soul. Barry Brown's one note performance doesn't help matters. The lack of real connection between the leads could be forgiven if we could at least see through Winterborn's eyes and share his dilemma, but we're kept at arm's length. Only Mildred Natwick and a superb cast against type Eileen Brennan really shine, although Cloris Leachman's interpretation of Mrs Miller as Gracie Allen has a bizarre fascination. A cold film made with a passion its director never communicates to an audience, this was a career killer in 1974 and it feels no better today.Bogdanovich still believes in the film, although his commentary and introduction on this DVD often seem to highlight how little he understood his material or what he was really capturing on film.",2,More career suicide note than movie,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,3452,"['so', 'often', 'film', 'commits', 'suicide', 'very', 'eyes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'rumors', 'course', 'when', 'see', 'start', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', 'film', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'sequence', 'quietly', 'wonderful', 'leading', 'man', 'little', 'stiff', 'mannered', 'lot', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'rigors', 'regulations', 'polite', 'century', '19th', 'century', 'Europe', 'then', 'Cybill', 'Shepard', 'screen', 'poise', 'bartender', 'break', 'up', 'fight', 'Deadwood', 'saloon', 'heart', 'sink', 'Then', 'mouth', 'can', 'feel', 'noose', 'tightening', 'film', 'neck', 'not', 'long', 'kicked', 'away', 'stool', 'swinging', 'gasping', 'breath', 'choking', 'horribly', 'remaining', '80', 'minutes', 'Daisy', 'Miller', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'character', 'who', 'place', 'old', 'moneyed', 'society', 'even', 'Henry', 'James', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'place', 'Shepherd', 'were', 'wearing', 'cheerleader', 'outfit', 'jumping', 'trampoline', 'singing', 'Yay', 'Mickey/You', ""'re"", 'so', 'fine/You', ""'re"", 'so', 'fine', 'blow', 'mind', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'wrong', 'effortlessly', 'long', 'stretches', 'dialogue', 'ingenuous', 'lack', 'awareness', 'just', 'how', 'horribly', 'bad', 'performance', 'hard', 'think', 'just', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part', '1974', 'young', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'sleep', 'was', 'far', 'young', 'then', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'obvious', 'candidate', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'stood', 'chance', 'thanks', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'famous', 'career-destroying', 'infatuation', 'Shepherd', 'completely', 'how', 'much', 'damage', 'what', 'already', 'very', 'slight', 'too', 'fragile', 'piece', 'framing', 'often', 'exquisite', 'almost', 'watching', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'slap', 'Groucho', 'moustache', 'glasses', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Rather', 'beguiling', 'siren', 'unguarded', 'charm', 'jaded', 'hero', 'true', 'nature', 'mental', 'tightrope', 'what', 'be', 'what', 'society', 'get', 'irritating', 'nag', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up', 'second', 'lines', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'halfway', 'sane', 'human', 'being', 'run', 'hills', 'fast', 'feet', 'will', 'carry', 'second', 'thought.On', 'one', 'level', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'story', 'Americans', 'playing', 'being', 'Europeans', 'failing', 'understand', 'not', 'just', 'rules', 'acceptable', 'behavior', 'also', 'true', 'nature', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'mirroring', 'Bogdanovich', 'situation', 'Visconti', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'script', 'times', 'feels', 'more', 'transcription', 'adaptation', 'never', 'gaining', 'inner', 'life', 'could', 'perhaps', 'have', 'mitigated', 'lack', 'soul', 'Barry', 'Brown', 'one', 'note', 'performance', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'lack', 'real', 'connection', 'leads', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'could', 'least', 'see', 'Winterborn', 'eyes', 'share', 'dilemma', ""'re"", 'kept', 'arm', 'length', 'Only', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'superb', 'cast', 'type', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'really', 'shine', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'interpretation', 'Mrs', 'Miller', 'Gracie', 'Allen', 'bizarre', 'fascination', 'cold', 'film', 'made', 'passion', 'director', 'never', 'audience', 'was', 'career', 'killer', '1974', 'better', 'today.Bogdanovich', 'still', 'film', 'commentary', 'introduction', 'DVD', 'often', 'seem', 'highlight', 'how', 'little', 'understood', 'material', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'capturing', 'film']",N/A
