It is amazing that somebody made a movie where President Grant and Sitting Bull were going to sit down together between the two armies and discuss peace, but that Custer screwed the whole thing up on purpose by disobeying orders and attacking the indians while Grant was waiting to be taken to the meeting place.  It is certainly sympathetic to the indians, and a bit ahead of its time in 1954 in this respect.  Sitting Bull chides one of his braves not to scalp Custer because we do not scalp brave men who died in battle.

By today's standards, the story is stiff, dated, and with hefty doses of propaganda and stereotyping.  The acting is not memorable.  Nevertheless, the presentation had some merits as the scenery in the original film was quite good and some of the staging was interesting.  Despite such flaws, this reviewer, who grew up in the Black Hills and was living on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation when the film was made, was looking forward to having the DVD.But discussing the merits of the film is superfluous, because the DVD presentation is so abominable:  Sound is harsh.  Picture color fidelity is nil:  Greens appear as oranges; other color distortions are rampant across the spectrum of colors and across any given screen image.  Aside from the color, to say that the image is grainy would be a gross understatement:  As a friend remarked, viewing a regular film with 9 out of 10 pixels being nonfunctional on the HDTV would probably produce a similar result.  Though the film was originally done in Cinemascope, it is impossible to avoid some form of distortion on an HDTV 16x9 screen:  Either one must be satisfied with a picture area reminiscent of the size of a postage stamp in the middle of the screen, or else there is distortion in ALL OTHER MODES including ZOOM mode.  Playing the DVD on an older system seems to fill out the 4x3 TV image, though at what cost this reviewer is unable to say, there obviously being major lost of picture area.  But such matters are irrelevant because  regardless of what system one tries to use, the cumulative DVD flaws are so bad that this reviewer, in disgust, simply could no longer watch it.  It is amazing that such a piece of crap would be marketed.",1,What an abomination!,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,1809,"['What', 'pity', 'reviewer', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'originally', 'screened', 'movie', 'theatres', 'circa', '1954', 'today', 'standards', 'story', 'stiff', 'dated', 'hefty', 'doses', 'propaganda', 'stereotyping', 'acting', 'not', 'memorable', 'Nevertheless', 'presentation', 'had', 'merits', 'scenery', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'staging', 'was', 'interesting', 'such', 'flaws', 'reviewer', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Black', 'Hills', 'was', 'living', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'Indian', 'Reservation', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'having', 'DVD.But', 'discussing', 'merits', 'film', 'superfluous', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'so', 'abominable', 'Sound', 'harsh', 'Picture', 'color', 'fidelity', 'nil', 'Greens', 'appear', 'oranges', 'other', 'color', 'distortions', 'are', 'rampant', 'spectrum', 'colors', 'given', 'screen', 'image', 'Aside', 'color', 'say', 'image', 'grainy', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'understatement', 'friend', 'remarked', 'viewing', 'regular', 'film', '9', '10', 'pixels', 'being', 'nonfunctional', 'HDTV', 'would', 'probably', 'produce', 'similar', 'result', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'done', 'Cinemascope', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'form', 'distortion', 'HDTV', '16x9', 'screen', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'satisfied', 'picture', 'area', 'reminiscent', 'size', 'postage', 'stamp', 'middle', 'screen', 'else', 'distortion', 'ALL', 'OTHER', 'MODES', 'including', 'ZOOM', 'mode', 'Playing', 'DVD', 'older', 'system', 'fill', 'out', '4x3', 'TV', 'image', 'though', 'what', 'cost', 'reviewer', 'unable', 'say', 'obviously', 'being', 'major', 'lost', 'picture', 'area', 'such', 'matters', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'regardless', 'what', 'system', 'one', 'use', 'cumulative', 'DVD', 'flaws', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'reviewer', 'disgust', 'simply', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'watch', 'amazing', 'piece', 'crap', 'would', 'be', 'marketed']",N/A

There had been and would be worse movies, super-cheap independent productions and exploitation films by second tier studios, but it is unlikely that a top studio like United Artists has ever been associated with something quite this God-awful.""Sitting Bull"" was intended as a historical epic (or at least a modest budget example of one), another in a fast growing line of movies dealing with the Battle of Little Big Horn or Custer's Last Stand. What is amazing about Hollywood is their continued unwillingness to tell the straight story about the engagement, as the true events of this military action have generated a sustained interest for over 130 years. Like the James gang's raid on Northfield, Minnesota, the true story is far more interesting that any of the embellished movie versions. If Hollywood is going to distort the events then they should change the names and call it by its correct name, fiction.I've seen most of these Hollywood efforts and ""Sitting Bull"" is pretty much in a class by itself in the distortion department. Curiously, it appears that a fair amount of historical research went into the production as recognizable names are bandied about throughout the movie but rarely are they linked to the individual's real actions. A relatively obscure officer like Miles Keogh, who was killed with Custer, is a character in the film but his rank is incorrect and he not present at the climatic battle.Earlier comments point out the most absurd of the movie's inaccuracies and distortions. It is certainly sympathetic to the Indians as Hollywood was actually remarkably quick to adopt this attitude. But even here there are distortions as the film specifically shows the Chief ordering that brave dead troopers not be desecrated. In fact the Indians stripped the bodies and went into mutilation frenzy at the conclusion of the fighting.Dramatically the film is flat with Dale Robertson wooden as the lead actor (too bad they didn't use Cliff Robertson instead). Mary Murphy (""The Wild Ones"") is his love interest and Douglas Kennedy is Custer.Indian sympathizer Major Bob Parrish (Robertson) sacrifices his Army career and his romance because of his Indian sympathies. He stands in the way of greedy prospectors who want the Indian Territory opened up so they can search for gold. This was actually Custer's position but in the film Custer is portrayed as a rabid Indian hater.Murphy's relationship with Robertson is unintentionally hilarious and devoid of  basic logic. So if you are forced to watch this thing, you can at least look forward to their scenes for some much needed (if unintentional) comic relief.""Sitting Bull"" doesn't limit its social conscience factor to the red man, Parrish finds time to free a runaway black slave Sam (Joel Fluellen) from prison. It turns out that Sam has lived with the Sioux and he takes Parrish to their camp for a peace conference. The mad dog Custer messes up his efforts by disobeying President Grant and attacking the Indians at Little Big Horn. Of course nothing like this actually happened. Nor did Custer find himself standing up in the middle of a flat piece of prairie as the Indians rode around and around his command like it was a wagon train in an early Hollywood western. How do you say pathetic in Sioux?Than again, what do I know?
