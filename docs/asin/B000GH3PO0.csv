1004306,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000GH3PO0,Caleb Williams,"[5, 5]","Steve Coogan, along with Sacha Baron Cohen are pure examples of how good British comedy is. Alan Partridge, is held in the minds of many as one of the greatest comedy characters in British Comedy history. The character itself is a failing TV presenter jumping to any radio or TV programme that will have him. I'm Alan Partridge depicts the fall and rise of Alan Partridge as he struggles against adversity to get back his career. The obstacles in his way just happen to be the controller of BBC television Tony Hayers. Alan Partridge is a boring an monotonous character who is filled with all the inner hate and loneliness we would come to expect from someone with this failing career. Everyone he comes  across he fails to leave a good impression, citing his usual bigotry leaves the people who ended his career with justification as to why they did so.Series 1 focuses on the stage in Alan's life just after he has been divorced by his wife, Carol; distanced himself from his children and is forced to live in the Linton Travel Tavern. The only ounce of a career Alan can claim to have is his radio show ""Up with the Partridge"" on the fictional ""Radio Norwich."" This isn't much as it's only on air in the dead time of 4:30am to 7:00am.Episode 1: Room With An Alan: Alan and his P.A. Lynn view a show home in which Alan manages to confuse and bore the Estate Agent. Convinced he's destined to get a second series of ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" he makes an offer. Next he has a meeting with BBC Head of Programmes Tony Hayers who will tell Alan of his future with the BBC. Alan must impress Tony with his ideas or be destined to failure. This particular stressful moment gave birth to the classic quote ""Smell my cheese""Episode 2: Alan Attraction: Without a second series of his programme, Alan is forced to fire the staff of his production company ""Peartree Productions."" Panicking when asked if they had a second series, Alan says yes so as they plan a party Alan makes a move on his secretary Jill. The surprising thing is that he actually gets lucky for once.Episode 3: Watership Alan: Alan makes a disparaging comment about farmers, which enrages the farmers union and gets Alan into a lot of trouble. He's also approached to make a corporate video for a small boating holiday company in which he accepts and invents a drinking combination known as the lady boy.Episode 4: Basic Alan: Linton is going through some major refurbishments, making Alan the only guest. In order to pass the time and cure his boredom, Alan embarks on dismantling his trouser press, walking along the dual-carriageway to the nearest petrol station to buy windscreen washer fluid, amongst other things.Episode 5: To Kill A Mocking Alan: Alan hosts a show at the Linton entitled ""An Afternoon With Alan Partridge"" which is intended to impress two Irish TV executives. The afternoon is also attended by Alan's self-confessed biggest fan, Jed Maxwell. He turns out to be a complete psychopath who wants to keep Alan all to himself.Episode 6: Towering Alan: The man who cancelled Alan's BBC career, Tony Hayers has died leaving Alan in a delightful mood. It gets even better for Alan when Chris Feather takes over Tony's job because Chris is a fan of Alan's and wants him back on the air.For a series with only 6 episodes, it set in stone a great comedic character and was placed in the history books as a classic sitcom. It was placed in the books along with such great classic sitcoms like Fawlty Towers. To people who aren't familiar with the character, I would strongly recommend you buy this DVD. I promise this will make you laugh more than you have in your entire life.",5,A Shining Light Of British Comedy,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,3650,"['Steve', 'Coogan', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'are', 'pure', 'examples', 'how', 'good', 'British', 'comedy', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'held', 'minds', 'many', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'characters', 'British', 'Comedy', 'history', 'character', 'failing', 'TV', 'presenter', 'jumping', 'radio', 'TV', 'programme', 'will', 'have', ""'m"", 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'fall', 'rise', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'adversity', 'get', 'back', 'career', 'obstacles', 'way', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'controller', 'BBC', 'television', 'Tony', 'Hayers', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'boring', 'monotonous', 'character', 'who', 'filled', 'inner', 'hate', 'loneliness', 'would', 'come', 'expect', 'someone', 'failing', 'career', 'Everyone', 'leave', 'good', 'impression', 'citing', 'usual', 'bigotry', 'people', 'who', 'ended', 'career', 'justification', 'why', 'did', 'so.Series', '1', 'focuses', 'stage', 'Alan', 'life', 'just', 'been', 'divorced', 'wife', 'Carol', 'distanced', 'children', 'forced', 'live', 'Linton', 'Travel', 'Tavern', 'only', 'ounce', 'career', 'Alan', 'can', 'claim', 'have', 'radio', 'show', 'Partridge', 'fictional', 'Radio', 'Norwich', ""n't"", 'much', 'only', 'air', 'dead', 'time', '4:30am', '7:00am.Episode', '1', 'Room', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'P.A', 'Lynn', 'view', 'show', 'home', 'Alan', 'confuse', 'bore', 'Estate', 'Agent', 'Convinced', 'destined', 'get', 'second', 'series', 'Knowing', 'Me', 'Knowing', 'offer', 'meeting', 'BBC', 'Head', 'Programmes', 'Tony', 'Hayers', 'who', 'will', 'tell', 'Alan', 'future', 'BBC', 'Alan', 'must', 'impress', 'Tony', 'ideas', 'be', 'destined', 'failure', 'particular', 'stressful', 'moment', 'gave', 'birth', 'classic', 'quote', 'Smell', 'cheese', '2', 'Alan', 'Attraction', 'second', 'series', 'programme', 'Alan', 'forced', 'fire', 'staff', 'production', 'company', 'Peartree', 'Productions', 'Panicking', 'when', 'asked', 'had', 'second', 'series', 'Alan', 'yes', 'so', 'plan', 'party', 'Alan', 'move', 'secretary', 'Jill', 'surprising', 'thing', 'actually', 'lucky', 'once.Episode', '3', 'Watership', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'disparaging', 'comment', 'farmers', 'farmers', 'union', 'Alan', 'lot', 'trouble', 'also', 'approached', 'make', 'corporate', 'video', 'small', 'boating', 'holiday', 'company', 'drinking', 'combination', 'known', 'lady', 'boy.Episode', '4', 'Basic', 'Alan', 'Linton', 'going', 'major', 'refurbishments', 'making', 'Alan', 'only', 'guest', 'order', 'pass', 'time', 'cure', 'boredom', 'Alan', 'dismantling', 'trouser', 'press', 'walking', 'dual-carriageway', 'nearest', 'petrol', 'station', 'buy', 'windscreen', 'washer', 'fluid', 'other', 'things.Episode', '5', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mocking', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'show', 'Linton', 'entitled', 'Afternoon', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'intended', 'impress', 'two', 'Irish', 'TV', 'executives', 'afternoon', 'also', 'attended', 'Alan', 'self-confessed', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Jed', 'Maxwell', 'out', 'be', 'complete', 'psychopath', 'who', 'keep', 'Alan', 'himself.Episode', '6', 'Towering', 'Alan', 'man', 'who', 'cancelled', 'Alan', 'BBC', 'career', 'Tony', 'Hayers', 'died', 'leaving', 'Alan', 'delightful', 'mood', 'even', 'better', 'Alan', 'when', 'Chris', 'Feather', 'Tony', 'job', 'Chris', 'fan', 'Alan', 'back', 'air.For', 'series', 'only', '6', 'episodes', 'set', 'stone', 'great', 'comedic', 'character', 'was', 'placed', 'history', 'books', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'was', 'placed', 'books', 'such', 'great', 'classic', 'sitcoms', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'character', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'DVD', 'promise', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'have', 'entire', 'life']",N/A

1004308,AP5SRWM7PKOBJ,B000GH3PO0,Galactic Melt,"[20, 20]","I am glad to finally see a legit release of this series here in America. I've nearly worn my bootlegs out!The Alan Partridge character which Steve Coogan portrays is nothing short of brilliant. Snobby, arrogant, close-minded and cheesy are just a few words which describe Alan's personality. Alan is one of these self-important larger than life individuals who feels he is invincible and his arrogance lands him in hot water quite a bit through this series.This series, titled ""I'm Alan Partridge"", takes place a few years after the previous series titled ""Knowing Me Knowing You."" While KMKY was purely Alan's talk show on the BBC, ""I'm Alan Partridge"" follows Alan in his daily life with a type of ""fly on the wall"" perspective. We see him haggling with TV execs, killing time at the Linton Travel Tavern, dressing up as a zombie, fantasizing about lap dancing for Tony Hayers and much more while managing to bewilder and insult almost everyone he comes in contact with.The writing in this series is pure comical genius. Most of the comedy is dialogue driven as we see Alan interact with his assistant Lynn, various workers at the Linton Travel Tavern (including the brilliant Michael who shows up on the next Alan Partridge series) and many more. The character development of this series is one reason why it remains so popular. Also, Alan has quite a few memorable quips in this series (you'll be quoting them in no time) and you'll never look at lap dancing the same way again! This series landed Steve Coogan several awards including a ""Best Comedy"" BAFTA award.Although I am an American I have always appreciated the British style of comedy. The biting humor of ""I'm Alan Partridge"" stands in a league of its own and takes its rightful place among legendary BBC comedies like ""Are You Being Served"", ""Chef!"", ""My Hero"" and ""The Thin Blue Line.""

Each episode is a masterpiece in its own right and whilst its difficult to pick a favourite episode I can pick out my favourite moment..Alan phones down to the Motel reception, and the camera pans back so we can see him sitting on the bed.""Oh Hello Susan umm slight problem I was a bit bored err so I dismantled my Corby Trouser Press... I err I can't put it back together again... um will that show up on my bill? Right thanks"". Alan has all our human failings in him (in this case extreme boredom) and we get to observe them all in cringe worthy (but very funny) detail.There are many many other great moments: Alan interviewing the Farmers representative (brilliantly played by Chris Morris). The sequence in the car park where Alan is sitting in the car with Lynn and doesn't have anything to say. This leads me neatly on to the extras...These are marvellous; firstly the commentaries are essential listening, informative, funny and of course you may find out whats in Alan's draw! The outtakes and cuts are very good and the extended version of the car scene with Lynn is well worth seeing.
