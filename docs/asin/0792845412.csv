Sandra's live show that this is based on was released on audio cassette many years ago (1988?), and is a very vivid listening experience--you feel like you are there.  This movie, however, leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied.  I saw it when it first came out at the theater, and while we all had a grand time, showing it to friends afterwards, I became aware that this presentation is a bit too dry for most, and watching it alone, it isn't nearly as funny.  However, it's still a decent flick, but you would be better advised to get either The King of Comedy or I'm Still Here, Dammit! for your Bernhard fixes.",3,The live audio release was better....,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,671,"['just', 'across', 'little', 'too', 'staged', 'Sandra', 'live', 'show', 'based', 'was', 'released', 'audio', 'cassette', 'many', 'years', 'ago', '1988', 'very', 'vivid', 'listening', 'experience', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'movie', 'however', 'feeling', 'little', 'unsatisfied', 'saw', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theater', 'had', 'grand', 'time', 'showing', 'friends', 'afterwards', 'became', 'aware', 'presentation', 'bit', 'too', 'dry', 'most', 'watching', 'alone', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'However', 'still', 'decent', 'flick', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'advised', 'get', 'either', 'King', 'Comedy', ""'m"", 'Still', 'Here', 'Dammit', 'Bernhard', 'fixes']",N/A

The wild musical interludes, broken up by deadpan monologues, and hilariously backhanded commentary by her fictionized former agent and an old &quot;friend&quot;, will never be forgotten by any viewer, whether fan or not.In this earlier incarnation, Sandra was the foremost artist of emotional abjection.  A character who encounters rejection and misunderstanding everywhere, yet one whom the viewer soon identifies as easily the most intelligent person in the room.  It is neither her religion nor her sexuality which marginalize her, but the particular pitch of her wit and her kaleidescopic view of cultural phenomena.Sandra's scatter-shot talents range from singing to dancing to acting to writing, but, as this film demonstrates, the sum of her brilliance is greater than any one (though also brilliant!) part.Sandra is a national treasure who might just change and even save your life.  She is tragi-comedy incarnate.

If you watched it in 1990 when it came out then you'd probably think it was funny (like I did) but after buying it in 2006 and watching it again - I could barely sit through it!
