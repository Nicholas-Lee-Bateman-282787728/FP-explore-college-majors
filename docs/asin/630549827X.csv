It deals with characters whose way of life has been and continues to be, about crime. Peter Greene plays the lead and as always gives a superb performance.(He has also been in The Usual Suspects, The Mask, and Clean Shaven)It's very surprising this didn't launch Director Nick Gomez's career into the fast lane. The perspective of each individual character is so raw and believable, that it feels like you could have known these characters in your own life. It is easy to empathize with the characters and get wrapped up in the film due to the ingenious/realistic dialogue. Kudos! to all the actors in the film and the Director.

466986,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,630549827X,Linda Linguvic,"[6, 6]","I was interested in this low-budget 1992 film because it starred Edie Falco of ""The Sopranos"" before she got famous, and because the setting was an Italian American neighborhood in Brooklyn. The characters are all ""wanna be"" gangsters who think they are tough guys. There are two couples in the story and Edie Falco is a hard-working young married woman who argues a lot with her husband even though you can tell that the two of them are in love.  They are friends with another couple who fight and break up all the time. The boyfriend is physically abusive and and Edie Falco does a lot of consoling her friend.  All of them hang out in bars and the men are involved in petty crime, including a lot of shoplifting.  Into this mix comes another friend who is on parole from jail.  He is definitely a bad guy and is trying to sell guns, much to Edie Falco's displeasure.  Everyone talks and argues all the time.  It was a bunch of losers living on the edge and playing with fire.  Naturally, one of them gets shot.I know this wasn't a great film.  In fact it probably wouldn't even get on the playing field for any kind of award.  But it moved fast, the characters were interesting and quirky, and I really got into the grittiness of it all.  I liked their youth and vim and vinegar even though it was obvious that they were all losers. And, unlike ""The Sopranos"", nobody ever makes any real money and they are always poor.Frankly, I loved this film and give it a high rating.  I found it interesting and very very real even though I know it is not for everyone.",5,A bunch of losers living on the edge and playing with fire.

Peter Greene, late of playing ""Zed"" in ""Pulp Fiction"" plays the best friend of character actor Adam Trese (a familiar face on the original ""Law and Order"")who is heading for trouble by carrying a concealed gun in a ""weapons free"" mob-run area of Brooklyn, New York.The film follows their quick descent as they compound their troubles with horrendous decisions and fatal consequences.The film is also the source of the phrase ""mucka ferguson"", itself a euphemism for a certain swear-word combo, popularised by the eponymous band that adopted it for their own.It has taken a VERY long time to see this on dvd when other garbage films have seen release on dvd for a decade.
