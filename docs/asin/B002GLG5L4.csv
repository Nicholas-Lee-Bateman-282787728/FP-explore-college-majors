The young group of friends end up in a big nightmare as they are taken by a big scary looking hillbilly and now must figure out how to stay alive or get away, neither will be easy. The main two victims of the human trafficking are brother and sister Nick (Christian Walker) and Erin (Jeanette Comans) so they must stick together to make it if they can. They are treated like wild horses that must be broken and even worse. The movie takes some nice twist and gets pretty gory so hang in there. All in all I like this movie and thinks it is worth a look so if you like this type of torture horror on a budget give it a viewing.",3,How did I get into this nightmare ?,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,696,"['Here', 'go', 'torture', 'porn', 'were', 'one', 'getting', 'off', 'easy', 'young', 'group', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'big', 'nightmare', 'are', 'taken', 'big', 'scary', 'looking', 'hillbilly', 'now', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stay', 'alive', 'get', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'main', 'two', 'victims', 'human', 'trafficking', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'Nick', 'Christian', 'Walker', 'Erin', 'Jeanette', 'Comans', 'must', 'stick', 'together', 'make', 'can', 'are', 'treated', 'wild', 'horses', 'must', 'be', 'broken', 'even', 'worse', 'movie', 'nice', 'twist', 'pretty', 'gory', 'so', 'hang', 'there', 'like', 'movie', 'look', 'so', 'like', 'type', 'torture', 'horror', 'budget', 'give', 'viewing']",N/A

E Jackson,"[3, 5]","I'm a bit taken aback at all the negative reviews for Live Animals- I was completely disgusted and shocked at the numerous twisted ways the teenagers were being tortured inside of a barn while basically being treated like animals.Man, there's so many sick things about this film that really made me go ""GEEZ LOUISE!""Here, let me name some-One of the teenagers had been kept inside the barn for such a long time that she completely lost her mind and had gone crazy, so she spent her time singing songs to herself all day, and just acting fruity in the head.  She'd been trapped in a small dark room for such a long time, and the results are that her mind had been fried completely.  Isn't that a scary thought?  Being trapped somewhere until you begin to go crazy?  And there's no way out?  So you have to spend your entire 24-hour day acting like it's perfectly normal to be trapped inside a barn?  I like how the writers put this little bit of realism in the film.The farmers themselves are REALLY vicious killers.  Okay, so the old man definitely doesn't fit the ""vicious killer"" type, but that's actually a nice quality- you'd never expect him to be the way he is.  He's completely heartless when it comes to how he treats the locked up teens.All the farmer wants to do is sell these teenagers to people overseas so he can make some money, and that's why they're trapped inside a barn- waiting for their owner to show up so he can pick and choose his next victim.  He ALSO treats the teens like animals!  This is honestly really disturbing to me on a personal level.  Just imagine being in the same predicament.  You're trapped and there's nothing you can do to escape, and when you're finally freed from your room, you have to deal with yet another psychotic, emotionless, unpredictably evil person.Whenever the teenagers step out of line, guess what happens?  They are tortured on the spot.  Without spoiling a whole lot, one teenager gets his tongue ripped out while his trapped friends are forced to watch the whole thing.There's a certain disturbing level of horror that I believe goes TOO far however- it's how the teens are seriously not treated any better than a regular farm animal.  It's disgusting.Expect a lot of blood and violence such as shootings, stabbings, and smacking with heavy objects.  Truly a terrifying film to me.Oh, and expect a REALLY shocking ending.",5,REALLY gross and twisted,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,2381,"[""'m"", 'bit', 'taken', 'aback', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Live', 'Animals-', 'was', 'completely', 'disgusted', 'shocked', 'numerous', 'twisted', 'ways', 'teenagers', 'were', 'being', 'tortured', 'barn', 'basically', 'being', 'treated', 'animals.Man', 'so', 'many', 'sick', 'things', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'go', 'GEEZ', 'LOUISE', 'Here', 'let', 'name', 'some-One', 'teenagers', 'had', 'been', 'kept', 'barn', 'long', 'time', 'completely', 'lost', 'mind', 'had', 'gone', 'crazy', 'spent', 'time', 'singing', 'songs', 'herself', 'day', 'just', 'acting', 'fruity', 'head', ""'d"", 'been', 'trapped', 'small', 'dark', 'room', 'such', 'long', 'time', 'results', 'are', 'mind', 'had', 'been', 'fried', 'completely', ""n't"", 'scary', 'thought', 'Being', 'trapped', 'somewhere', 'begin', 'go', 'crazy', 'way', 'out', 'So', 'have', 'spend', 'entire', '24-hour', 'day', 'acting', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'be', 'trapped', 'barn', 'how', 'writers', 'put', 'little', 'bit', 'realism', 'film.The', 'farmers', 'are', 'REALLY', 'vicious', 'killers', 'Okay', 'old', 'man', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'fit', 'vicious', 'killer', 'type', 'actually', 'nice', 'quality-', ""'d"", 'never', 'expect', 'be', 'way', 'completely', 'heartless', 'when', 'how', 'locked', 'up', 'farmer', 'do', 'sell', 'teenagers', 'people', 'overseas', 'can', 'make', 'money', 'why', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'barn-', 'waiting', 'owner', 'show', 'up', 'so', 'can', 'pick', 'choose', 'next', 'victim', 'ALSO', 'teens', 'animals', 'honestly', 'really', 'disturbing', 'personal', 'level', 'Just', 'imagine', 'being', 'same', 'predicament', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'escape', 'when', ""'re"", 'finally', 'freed', 'room', 'have', 'deal', 'yet', 'psychotic', 'emotionless', 'unpredictably', 'evil', 'teenagers', 'step', 'line', 'guess', 'what', 'are', 'tortured', 'spot', 'spoiling', 'whole', 'lot', 'one', 'teenager', 'tongue', 'ripped', 'out', 'trapped', 'friends', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'whole', 'certain', 'disturbing', 'level', 'horror', 'believe', 'TOO', 'far', 'how', 'teens', 'are', 'seriously', 'not', 'treated', 'better', 'regular', 'farm', 'animal', 'disgusting.Expect', 'lot', 'blood', 'violence', 'such', 'shootings', 'stabbings', 'smacking', 'heavy', 'objects', 'Truly', 'terrifying', 'film', 'me.Oh', 'expect', 'REALLY', 'shocking', 'ending']",N/A

The film capitalizes on the success its ""Torture Porn"" predecessors (most notably HOSTEL and WOLF CREEK), but relies entirely on gratuitous violence, gore, and nudity to justify its existence in the absence of character development or originality. The buying and selling of human trade comes sickeningly close to Eli Roth's earlier imagining, modified only slightly by the fact that the captives are treated like animals rather than people. Despite the low budget, Jeremy Benson does employ a decent use of color filters to heighten the aesthetics and mood, while exhibiting a strong sense of stylism adapted from the film's obvious influences. Though the acting remains passable considering the scale, the biggest failing is that the audience is never given the opportunity to bond with the characters, which leaves the emotional response void in each of their deaths. As a veritable low-budget remake of the HOSTEL ""Torture Porn"" model, it will appeal to some hard-gore fan bases, but it does not escape its own amateur production and derivative plot line.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Live Animals,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1263,"['LIVE', 'ANIMALS', 'group', 'friends', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'tortured', 'pair', 'twisted', 'horse', 'breeders', 'looking', 'turn', 'quick', 'buck', 'new', 'breed', 'livestock', 'film', 'success', 'Torture', 'Porn', 'predecessors', 'most', 'notably', 'HOSTEL', 'WOLF', 'CREEK', 'entirely', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'gore', 'nudity', 'justify', 'existence', 'absence', 'character', 'development', 'originality', 'buying', 'selling', 'human', 'trade', 'sickeningly', 'close', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'earlier', 'imagining', 'modified', 'only', 'slightly', 'fact', 'captives', 'are', 'treated', 'animals', 'rather', 'people', 'low', 'budget', 'Jeremy', 'Benson', 'employ', 'decent', 'use', 'color', 'filters', 'heighten', 'aesthetics', 'mood', 'exhibiting', 'strong', 'sense', 'stylism', 'adapted', 'film', 'obvious', 'influences', 'acting', 'passable', 'considering', 'scale', 'biggest', 'failing', 'audience', 'never', 'given', 'opportunity', 'bond', 'characters', 'emotional', 'response', 'void', 'deaths', 'veritable', 'low-budget', 'remake', 'HOSTEL', 'Torture', 'Porn', 'model', 'will', 'appeal', 'hard-gore', 'fan', 'bases', 'not', 'escape', 'own', 'amateur', 'production', 'derivative', 'plot', 'line.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

Based on the premise and the package, I got exactly what I expected: an impossibly further low-rent attempt at capturing that same magic woven by modern horror cinema...ahem...powerhouses such as Saw and Hostel.  What I got was a micro-budget trash-fest, complete with hapless actors and a slipshod script.  I got a gaggle of characters I couldn't have cared less about, no plot to be found, and one of the worst examples of prosthetic make-up I've ever seen, that being a character boasting a crescent-shaped scar on his face, which looks more like a smeared mess of melted Snickers bars.I find these movies offensive.  I find them offensive because they are unoriginal.  I find them offensive because it really showcases that young filmmakers are not concerned with trying to scare the audience anymore, instead finding themselves content to throw as many breasts and buckets of blood at you as they can in a (mercifully) short 90 minute-or-so runtime.

That these filmmakers and their equally abysmal screenwriters don't mind depriving their narrative of a discernible point of interest, an end-goal, characters to care about or root for, and feel justified in calling their happy little nothing a story by throwing in a ""gotcha"" twist toward the end--even if you saw it coming a mile away because, and let's face it, that's what everybody else is doing, and that means it has to be an effective tool in the storytelling process, yeah?And even if I were that guy, that fella who is first in line at the cinema for the opening of the twelfth Saw sequel, drenching my popcorn in red Karo syrup and gasping orgasmically at the sight of paper-thin characters miraculously made full and packed with meat and bone if only for the purposes of it being spilled on some warehouse's floor, I would still be offended by this film.  Because it does what no movie that has nothing going for it other than that promise that its content will shock and revile you by way of sheer brutality should do.  It is simply boring and useless.  And by that amazingly low standard of trying to be the red-headed stepchild of something that is unabashedly unimportant and totally reliant on gross-out moments, this film cannot be seen as anything less than an utter and complete failure.",1,"Bland, ineffective horror",1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,2549,"['friend', 'mine', 'rented', 'sheer', 'giggles', 'watched', 'lark', 'Based', 'premise', 'package', 'got', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'impossibly', 'further', 'low-rent', 'attempt', 'capturing', 'same', 'magic', 'woven', 'modern', 'horror', 'cinema', 'ahem', 'powerhouses', 'such', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'micro-budget', 'trash-fest', 'complete', 'hapless', 'actors', 'slipshod', 'script', 'got', 'gaggle', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'plot', 'be', 'found', 'one', 'worst', 'examples', 'prosthetic', 'make-up', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'being', 'character', 'boasting', 'crescent-shaped', 'scar', 'face', 'more', 'smeared', 'mess', 'melted', 'Snickers', 'bars.I', 'find', 'movies', 'offensive', 'find', 'offensive', 'are', 'unoriginal', 'find', 'offensive', 'really', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'not', 'concerned', 'trying', 'scare', 'audience', 'anymore', 'instead', 'finding', 'content', 'throw', 'many', 'breasts', 'buckets', 'blood', 'can', 'mercifully', 'short', '90', 'minute-or-so', 'runtime', 'so', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'not', 'striving', 'grasp', 'brass', 'ring', 'create', 'something', 'instead', 'happy', 'grab', 'last', 'week', 'leftovers', 'regurgitate', 'television', 'poorly-shot', 'mess', 'filmmakers', 'equally', 'abysmal', 'screenwriters', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'depriving', 'narrative', 'discernible', 'point', 'interest', 'end-goal', 'characters', 'care', 'root', 'feel', 'justified', 'calling', 'happy', 'little', 'nothing', 'story', 'throwing', 'gotcha', 'twist', 'end', 'even', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'let', 'face', 'what', 'everybody', 'else', 'doing', 'be', 'effective', 'tool', 'storytelling', 'process', 'yeah', 'even', 'were', 'guy', 'fella', 'who', 'first', 'line', 'cinema', 'opening', 'twelfth', 'Saw', 'sequel', 'drenching', 'popcorn', 'red', 'Karo', 'syrup', 'gasping', 'orgasmically', 'sight', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'miraculously', 'made', 'full', 'packed', 'meat', 'bone', 'only', 'purposes', 'being', 'spilled', 'warehouse', 'floor', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'offended', 'film', 'what', 'movie', 'nothing', 'going', 'other', 'promise', 'content', 'will', 'shock', 'revile', 'way', 'sheer', 'brutality', 'should', 'do', 'simply', 'boring', 'useless', 'amazingly', 'low', 'standard', 'trying', 'be', 'red-headed', 'stepchild', 'something', 'unabashedly', 'unimportant', 'totally', 'reliant', 'gross-out', 'moments', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'anything', 'less', 'utter', 'complete', 'failure']",N/A

It requires something of a strong stomach, and you have to be used to low-budget horror films to really sit through it. But neither of those things make it bad by default. Where it really lost me was in its almost aggressive lack of doing anything original with a subgenre that's already tired; in fact, you've seen the Big Twist(TM) in a couple of other ""torture porn"" films. Which raises the question: why on earth would you bother sitting through this one?Plot: a bunch of young-and-beautifuls are abducted from a party by a white slaver. They have to try and survive/avoid becoming crazy or mindless.Yep, that's it. You've seen it before, usually done better (Hostel, Turistas, et al.). The only ""original"" aspect to be found here is the white-slavery bugaboo that's been used to scare kids and travelers for generations without there being any documented evidence of same since, roughly, American colonial times.

I must say I actually drug my ass out of bed to the computer to write this review.  I bought this as part of a 4 pack of movies for $5 bucks & I'd probably say I would maybe have agreed to watch this piece of crap for oh, say, $50 bucks.  If somebody would give me $50 bucks, I would say I'd waste my time with this dreck.  As it stands, I paid $1.25 for this thing.  Not only is the money a total waste...the hour & change I wasted on this utter garbage is time I'll never retrieve.  I'll grant you, making a film with zero budget is a tedious task that you do for the love of it.  But this film has no redeeming qualities.  Even the end kill of the stupid bad ass is a cop out.  Instead of making a cheap bladder head of the creep to saw to ribbons, they cut away to some cheap jack blood spraying around.  Man oh, man do I wish I had never opened this DVD since now I'm stuck with it.  There is no going back.  I am actually pissed off beyond belief that I wasted time & money on this thing.  If my review makes you long to see how bad it is...please for the love of all humanity...avoid it like the plague.
