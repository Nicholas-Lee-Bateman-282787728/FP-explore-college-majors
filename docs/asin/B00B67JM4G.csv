Filmed in Wales, the movie depicts a family trapped in their home while ""crazies"" roam the countryside. Senseless dialogue and whipped up moments that ache for the next monotonously gory scene. The lure is the title that many fans of the genre won't be able to resist. The film had a few scenes going for it that made you think it might not be a waste after all for a low budget indie. Turns out those few well shot moments were all the film could muster up. If young directors are going to take on a classic in remembrance, do they have to go so far as to use the complete original title?

It wouldn't be so bad if you did this film as an homage and stated it as such...but, to do otherwise is just tasteless. I even wonder if the director ever even viewed the original at all.

1622456,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00B67JM4G,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[8, 10]","""Night Of The Living Dead: Resurrection""Elements of George Romero's original 1968 ""Night Of The Living Dead"" are transposed into the English countryside and the modern-day world of smart phones and satellite TV, none of which comes in useful once the world ends. Overall, in the zombie-saturated, blood-soaked media landscape of today, this grim, low-budget film has modest offerings to add, dwelling on personal and social depravity... Perhaps the most terrifying is its portrayal of the vicious, nihilistic hooligans, British youth who are more mindless and violent than the zombies that surround them, more interested in filming the mayhem on their cell phones than in any viable survival strategy. It's a timely reflection of contemporary culture which may resonate on both sides of the Pond, but it's pretty depressing. Still, this isn't the greatest horror movie ever, and it rehashes many tropes we've seen before. Hardcore zombie devotees might want to check this out, though general audiences can probably skip it. Slow-moving, gory and unusually bleak, even for the zombie genre.

The dead are coming back to life and eating the living and the youth of rural Britannia are out in the dark, torturing and killing survivors???!!! The untamed, violent youth were annoying!

The eleventh entry adds nothing to the zombie mythology but is technically considered a remake of NotLD. Principal photography was completed in 12 days and manages to look and feel that way. It did break-even but only because it had a micro-budget ($20,000!!). It might not be a bad idea to take a few years off before releasing another NotLD movie.
