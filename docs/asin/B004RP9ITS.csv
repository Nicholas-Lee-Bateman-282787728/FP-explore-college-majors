1426839,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B004RP9ITS,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","""The Fab 5"" is one of the better documentaries to come out of the increasingly excellent ESPN Films pipeline.  It wasn't part of the stellar ""30 for 30"" series.  But it's clear that that initiative raised the bar - both in terms of quality of the productions and in who they're attracting to make films.  And, it's getting interesting guys like Jalen Rose to think, hey, maybe I've got a good project in me.Indeed, he did.  Not only did Rose produce this film, he also has large chunks of screen time recalling the events.  Anyone who's seen him on ESPN knows what a revelation he is as a commentator.  He's not Sir Charles (is anyone?), but he's got his own unique style that can't be taught.  It's that personality that bursts through again in ""The Fab 5.""  The other guys - Juwan Howard, Ray Jackson, and Jimmy King - provide their insights, too.  It's easy to see why the country fell hard for The Fab 5: these are very likable guys.What's missing, of course, is Chris Webber.  That's a shame.  He should have participated.  I'm sure he was concerned about how he would be portrayed for his role in the Ed Martin scandal (he was convicted of criminal contempt for lying about his relationship with Martin).  In those situations, my feeling is you're better participating and telling your story, rather than letting someone else tell the story for you.And tell it, Rose does.  He offers a spirited, emotional defense of Martin, noting ""Big Ed's"" well-known generosity towards high school stars.  In that context, he expresses his disgust at Webber's disavowals.  It's the film's most powerful passage...and the most relevatory one in terms of the relationship between the two.  Don't expect them as co-hosts any time soon.My other favorite part of the film: hearing how much The Fab 5 meant to today's stars.  If you're of the LeBron James era - he was born in 1984 - The Fab 5 heyday (1991 - 1993) is seared into your consciousness and forms a large part of your basketball DNA.  To hear it from this guys is really great.",5,The Fab 5 continues ESPN Films' strong run - it's a really great project from Jalen Rose,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,2026,"['Fab', '5', 'one', 'better', 'documentaries', 'come', 'increasingly', 'excellent', 'ESPN', 'Films', 'pipeline', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'stellar', '30', '30', 'series', 'clear', 'initiative', 'raised', 'bar', 'terms', 'quality', 'productions', 'who', ""'re"", 'attracting', 'make', 'films', 'getting', 'interesting', 'guys', 'Jalen', 'Rose', 'think', 'hey', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'got', 'good', 'project', 'me.Indeed', 'did', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Rose', 'produce', 'film', 'also', 'large', 'chunks', 'screen', 'time', 'recalling', 'events', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'ESPN', 'what', 'revelation', 'commentator', 'not', 'Sir', 'Charles', 'anyone', 'got', 'own', 'unique', 'style', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taught', 'personality', 'through', 'again', 'Fab', '5', 'other', 'guys', 'Juwan', 'Howard', 'Ray', 'Jackson', 'Jimmy', 'King', 'provide', 'insights', 'too', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'country', 'fell', 'hard', 'Fab', '5', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'guys.What', 'missing', 'course', 'Chris', 'Webber', 'shame', 'should', 'have', 'participated', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'concerned', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'portrayed', 'role', 'Ed', 'Martin', 'scandal', 'was', 'convicted', 'criminal', 'contempt', 'lying', 'relationship', 'Martin', 'situations', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'better', 'participating', 'telling', 'story', 'rather', 'letting', 'someone', 'else', 'tell', 'story', 'you.And', 'tell', 'Rose', 'spirited', 'emotional', 'defense', 'Martin', 'noting', 'Big', 'Ed', 'well-known', 'generosity', 'towards', 'high', 'school', 'stars', 'context', 'disgust', 'Webber', 'disavowals', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'passage', 'most', 'relevatory', 'one', 'terms', 'relationship', 'two', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'co-hosts', 'time', 'other', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'hearing', 'how', 'much', 'Fab', '5', 'meant', 'today', 'stars', ""'re"", 'LeBron', 'James', 'era', 'was', 'born', '1984', 'Fab', '5', 'heyday', '1991', '1993', 'seared', 'consciousness', 'large', 'part', 'basketball', 'DNA', 'hear', 'guys', 'really', 'great']",N/A

1426841,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B004RP9ITS,Austin Somlo,"[2, 7]","I have to tell you the truth: I don't remember the Fab Five all that much even though I saw the National Championship game where Chris Webber called the infamous time-out. Since then, the Fab Five had disappeared. As Bobby Knight (3-1, and now nonexistent as the games were forfeited, against the Fab Five) stated, they were one of the most overrated teams in the history (never won a Big Ten title), and now, they never existed since their records had been wiped out clean due to the scandals surrounding the team in terms of money exchanges. A lot of the documentary felt like an excuse for the Fab Five minus the most guilty party to condone their actions. Well, they cheated, plain and simple. And no...they weren't that good. I saw that Duke team with Laettner, Hurley, and Hill to demolish the Fab Five in the National Championship game the year prior to the North Carolina game, and it wasn't even that much of a game for Duke. And no...the Fab Five wasn't even that good. Probably the worst aspect of the documentary was how the Fab Five minus the most guilty party trash talked Duke using one word names, never beating them once (didn't matter anymore since the games had resulted in forfeits). The players of the Fab Five had absolutely no right to call the black players who played for Duke as Uncle Toms. The backward racism was the most ruinous aspect of the documentary. That's exactly how I remembered the Fab Five players: arrogant, self-absorbed, overrated, and absolutely spoiled. Again, they weren't that good. Duke had beaten them all of the three times they played each other. And look at how they sobbed and trashed their way to the locker room after each national championship loss. You have to admit that the documentary was largely one sided: no perspectives from anyone else who went against the Fab Five. They probably couldn't handle the criticism like how they did back then. All in all, the Fab Five never existed, and they remained forever the shame of University of Michigan Wolverines sport history as the school refused to acknowledge the squad. And the former Duke Blue Devils can laugh about that fact today. Instead, the time should have been spent in making a documentary about one of the greatest games ever played in the history of NCAA basketball: the 1992 East Regional Final between Duke and Kentucky.

Little ""D.Writer""","[0, 0]","Since I grew up watching ""The Fab Five"" I coudln't wait for the premiere of this documentary and I must say it was well worth the wait. I would have to say the highlight of this film for me was Jalen Rose, he was always my favorite of the group and this documentary proved to me why. He is in your face and made some comments that I knew would create controversy; but I think that is why he is well-liked he comes off brutally honest and is hilarious in doing so. I really enjoyed how the documentary was directed and the musical score. I would say this is a classic that I am glad to add to my collection.The Fab Five are legendary, love or hate them that is something critics will never be able to take from them. As Jalen points out in the film (not verbatum)- Can you name who won the National Championship 3 years ago? Five years ago? Can you name the starting five of the UNC team that beat them in 1993? Or the Duke starting five in 1992? The answer is simple, No.The downside (but it doesn't really take that much away from the documentary for me) is the absence of Chris Webber. It would have been really nice to have his input but having the other four members input still made it feel authentic to me.

1426846,A2G265ELKPQJQZ,B004RP9ITS,Renee,"[0, 0]","I finally got around to watching this on ESPN after hearing so much about it.  Wow.  It's been several hours and I'm still replaying scenes from this documentary in my head.  I was in my early twenties when these young men forced change on an establishment that wanted to keep the status quo.  They were so dynamic to watch  back then and hearing them speak today, it is obvious that they learned much during that time.  This documentary shows the other side to the brash, trash-talking youngsters of the past.  They came across as grounded adults in these interviews.Particularly impressive was Jalen Rose.  His honesty when admitting his past feelings towards Duke and Grant Hill was beyond refreshing.  I read Grant Hills response before I saw the documentary.  Now that I've seen the documentary, it sheds a totally different light on Rose's comments.  He was simply explaining how he felt at the age of 18 or 19.  He even explains why he felt that way, admitting jealousy was a factor.  I loved this scene for its mixture of honesty and humility.  Whether you agree with him or not, they were HIS feelings and he spoke them, knowing it would not be well received by some.This was very well done. The people that spoke appeared to speak from the heart, rather than sensoring themselves for the camera. Truth is what I treasure most in a documentary.

1426847,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B004RP9ITS,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 4]","Michigan's infamous ""Fab 5"" - Jalen Rose, Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson - may be the greatest recruiting class of all time.  They are surely the most notorious and fascinating.  ""The Fab 5,"" produced largely by Jalen Rose, gives these talented hoopsters the opportunity to tell their own story.This documentary - splendidly made and entertaining as hell - is as controversial as the basketball players themselves.  Love them or hate them, the defining aspect of the Fab 5 is that for all their hype and talent, they never won anything.  They shocked the basketball world in their freshman year by heading to the national title game starting 5 freshmen, where they got creamed by a juggernaut Duke team.  They followed this up by returning to the national title game as sophomores, only to lose to a juggernaut North Carolina team (full disclosure - I graduated from UNC in 1993, so the infamous ""time out"" game was during my senior year in Chapel Hill and remains one of the great events of my life).  They were the talk of college basketball for two years, but suffer from that nagging fact.All they have left is the talk.  And so they do.  Jalen Rose even goes so far at one point as to say, ""We were bigger than the score of the game.""  Unfortunately, Rose doesn't realize that nobody is bigger than the score of the game.  It's that kind of mindless self-regard that makes the Fab 5 such an endless topic of discussion.But when Rose, King, Howard and Jackson talk, they tell one hell of a story.  From their high school days through to the NCAA sanctions, these guys lived one hell of a ride.  They also had the good fortune to play in a golden era of college basketball - the concept of one-and-done had not yet arrived.  Indeed, a few short years later Chris Webber likely wouldn't have gone to college in the first place (unless he wanted to) - he had the skills as a high school senior to go straight to the NBA and play well.  But when the Fab 5 played, college basketball was as deep and talented as it ever had been.The other maddening thing about this documentary is Chris Webber's absence.  Webber may be the most tortured successful hoop star ever - in part because he was so great and failed, and in part because Webber had a tremendous appreciation of the moment.  He was always aware he was a star, and showboated appropriately.  But Webber was also well aware of the curse of the flamboyant talker - you had better back it up.  So while Webber backed it up with sterling stats and an amazing highlight reel, he never backed it up with what mattered most - a championship.  Webber carries two great shames - one is his mind-boggling flameout at the end of the 1993 title game, and the other is his well-earned sanction by the NCAA.  Still tortured by these demons, Webber refused to take part in the documentary, which is kind of like doing a documentary about Apple Computer without Steve Jobs offering his perspective.""The Fab 5"" remains a strong documentary, but it's all from the perspective of these guys - Jalen paid to get his story told.  While these guys do some slick stuff (they take credit for originating certain things, like baggy shorts, when they really popularized stuff that other folks were doing) by talking, the fascinating thing is that they think they can talk themselves into championship status.  You can't do that - that's one of the great things about sports - titles must be earned.Rose points out, ""Nobody remembers who played on the Carolina team that beat us.""  You're wrong, Jalen - George Lynch, Brian Reese, Donald Williams, Eric Montross, Derrick Phelps, Kevin Salvadori, and Scott Cherry beat you, and they have the championship ring to prove it.  (Jalen will have to console himself with the gazillions he made in the NBA - I'm sure he's doing just fine.)",4,The Fab 5 (minus one) speak about their greatness - and they have a lot to say,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,3835,"['Michigan', 'infamous', 'Fab', '5', 'Jalen', 'Rose', 'Chris', 'Webber', 'Juwan', 'Howard', 'Jimmy', 'King', 'Ray', 'Jackson', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'recruiting', 'class', 'time', 'are', 'surely', 'most', 'notorious', 'fascinating', 'Fab', '5', 'produced', 'largely', 'Jalen', 'Rose', 'talented', 'hoopsters', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'own', 'story.This', 'documentary', 'splendidly', 'made', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'as', 'controversial', 'basketball', 'players', 'Love', 'hate', 'defining', 'aspect', 'Fab', '5', 'hype', 'talent', 'never', 'won', 'anything', 'shocked', 'basketball', 'world', 'freshman', 'year', 'heading', 'national', 'title', 'game', 'starting', '5', 'freshmen', 'where', 'got', 'creamed', 'juggernaut', 'Duke', 'team', 'followed', 'up', 'returning', 'national', 'title', 'game', 'sophomores', 'only', 'lose', 'juggernaut', 'North', 'Carolina', 'team', 'full', 'disclosure', 'graduated', 'UNC', '1993', 'infamous', 'time', 'out', 'game', 'was', 'senior', 'year', 'Chapel', 'Hill', 'one', 'great', 'events', 'life', 'were', 'talk', 'college', 'basketball', 'two', 'years', 'suffer', 'nagging', 'fact.All', 'have', 'left', 'talk', 'so', 'do', 'Jalen', 'Rose', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'point', 'say', 'were', 'bigger', 'score', 'game', 'Unfortunately', 'Rose', ""n't"", 'realize', 'nobody', 'bigger', 'score', 'game', 'kind', 'mindless', 'self-regard', 'Fab', '5', 'endless', 'topic', 'discussion.But', 'when', 'Rose', 'King', 'Howard', 'Jackson', 'talk', 'tell', 'one', 'hell', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'NCAA', 'sanctions', 'guys', 'lived', 'one', 'hell', 'ride', 'also', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'play', 'golden', 'era', 'college', 'basketball', 'concept', 'one-and-done', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'arrived', 'Indeed', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'later', 'Chris', 'Webber', 'likely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'college', 'first', 'place', 'wanted', 'had', 'skills', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'go', 'straight', 'NBA', 'play', 'well', 'when', 'Fab', '5', 'played', 'college', 'basketball', 'was', 'deep', 'talented', 'ever', 'had', 'been.The', 'other', 'maddening', 'thing', 'documentary', 'Chris', 'Webber', 'absence', 'Webber', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'tortured', 'successful', 'hoop', 'star', 'ever', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'failed', 'part', 'Webber', 'had', 'tremendous', 'appreciation', 'moment', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'was', 'star', 'showboated', 'appropriately', 'Webber', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'aware', 'curse', 'flamboyant', 'talker', 'had', 'better', 'back', 'up', 'So', 'Webber', 'backed', 'up', 'sterling', 'stats', 'amazing', 'highlight', 'reel', 'never', 'backed', 'up', 'what', 'mattered', 'most', 'championship', 'Webber', 'two', 'great', 'shames', 'one', 'mind-boggling', 'flameout', 'end', '1993', 'title', 'game', 'other', 'well-earned', 'sanction', 'NCAA', 'Still', 'tortured', 'demons', 'Webber', 'refused', 'take', 'part', 'documentary', 'kind', 'doing', 'documentary', 'Apple', 'Computer', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'offering', 'perspective', 'Fab', '5', 'strong', 'documentary', 'perspective', 'guys', 'Jalen', 'paid', 'get', 'story', 'told', 'guys', 'do', 'slick', 'stuff', 'take', 'credit', 'originating', 'certain', 'things', 'baggy', 'shorts', 'when', 'really', 'popularized', 'stuff', 'other', 'folks', 'were', 'doing', 'talking', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'think', 'can', 'talk', 'championship', 'status', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'sports', 'titles', 'must', 'be', 'earned.Rose', 'points', 'out', 'Nobody', 'remembers', 'who', 'played', 'Carolina', 'team', 'beat', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'Jalen', 'George', 'Lynch', 'Brian', 'Reese', 'Donald', 'Williams', 'Eric', 'Montross', 'Derrick', 'Phelps', 'Kevin', 'Salvadori', 'Scott', 'Cherry', 'beat', 'have', 'championship', 'ring', 'prove', 'Jalen', 'will', 'have', 'console', 'gazillions', 'made', 'NBA', ""'m"", 'sure', 'doing', 'just', 'fine']",N/A
