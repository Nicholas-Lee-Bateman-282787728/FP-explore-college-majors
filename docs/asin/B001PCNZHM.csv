1226930,AYGPA53O2MAZV,B001PCNZHM,Guy G. Gordon,"[45, 47]","Hurray! I've been a huge fan of this series for a number of years (it also airs under alternate names like Air Crash Investigations in various countries). This is the first ""season"" of the series, which currently has 6 seasons of episodes, with something like 60 or so episodes. This is one of my all-time favorite documentary series featuring nice analytical and engaging storytelling and excellent production quality (typically far better than the average documentary). While later episodes would feature somewhat more advanced production quality, this first batch is still excellently produced.Later episodes of the series aired in HD, but I don't ever recall seeing these earlier episodes in HD. An extra bonus for this set is that it's in anamorphic widescreen. Having only seen these early ones in their 4x3 aspect ratio, it was nice to see them in their full 16x9 aspect ration.To the folks at Koch and National Geographic, PLEASE continue releasing this series. I'll absolutely purchase them all. And heck, it'd be extra cool to get the ones produced for it released in high def.UPDATE: These episodes on the DVD's are definitely extended from the aired versions I've got previous recordings of. The couple episodes I compared had some 6+ more minutes on this DVD version (interview clips with family & survivors less important to the narrative seem to be a favorite for cuts). Each episode clocks in at 52 minutes, give or take a few seconds.",5,Looking forward to further releases...,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,1451,"['Hurray', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'number', 'years', 'also', 'alternate', 'names', 'Air', 'Crash', 'Investigations', 'various', 'countries', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'currently', '6', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'something', '60', 'so', 'episodes', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'documentary', 'series', 'featuring', 'nice', 'analytical', 'engaging', 'storytelling', 'excellent', 'production', 'quality', 'typically', 'far', 'better', 'average', 'documentary', 'later', 'episodes', 'would', 'feature', 'somewhat', 'more', 'advanced', 'production', 'quality', 'first', 'batch', 'still', 'excellently', 'produced.Later', 'episodes', 'series', 'aired', 'HD', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'recall', 'seeing', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'HD', 'extra', 'bonus', 'set', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Having', 'only', 'seen', 'early', 'ones', '4x3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'full', '16x9', 'aspect', 'ration.To', 'folks', 'Koch', 'National', 'Geographic', 'PLEASE', 'continue', 'releasing', 'series', ""'ll"", 'absolutely', 'purchase', 'heck', ""'d"", 'be', 'extra', 'cool', 'get', 'ones', 'produced', 'released', 'high', 'def.UPDATE', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'definitely', 'extended', 'aired', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'got', 'previous', 'recordings', 'couple', 'compared', 'had', '6+', 'more', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'version', 'interview', 'clips', 'family', 'survivors', 'less', 'important', 'narrative', 'seem', 'be', 'favorite', 'cuts', 'episode', 'clocks', '52', 'minutes', 'give', 'take', 'few', 'seconds']",Mayday: Air Disasters

1226932,ACV1LQOTQGJD6,B001PCNZHM,"Jerry A. Dahlback ""Ravenhorse""","[12, 12]",I have watched the National Geographic series about Air Disasters for sometime now and it is done in a superb manner. This DVD set depicts well documented and very accurate information about these disasters as well as reports of post-air disaster information and how there were settlements by Airline Companies relative to what had occured. The series is done so well that you actually feel a part of the flights because of so much detail and how it is presented. I really don't find these accidents interesting except for the NTSB facts and the accuracy of how they were presented.  It was as much of a learning experience for me as well as an unbelieveable way to stay completely glued to to watching a documentary. It is fascinating to watch.,5,Mayday Air Disasters,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,745,"['have', 'watched', 'National', 'Geographic', 'series', 'Air', 'Disasters', 'sometime', 'now', 'done', 'superb', 'manner', 'DVD', 'set', 'depicts', 'well', 'documented', 'very', 'accurate', 'information', 'disasters', 'as', 'well', 'reports', 'post-air', 'disaster', 'information', 'how', 'were', 'settlements', 'Airline', 'Companies', 'relative', 'what', 'had', 'occured', 'series', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'actually', 'feel', 'part', 'flights', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'how', 'presented', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'accidents', 'interesting', 'NTSB', 'facts', 'accuracy', 'how', 'were', 'presented', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'learning', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'unbelieveable', 'way', 'stay', 'completely', 'glued', 'watching', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'watch']",Mayday: Air Disasters

1226934,ASR84M1GD9X89,B001PCNZHM,Kimberly Murphy-Smith,"[3, 4]","Mayday, a.k.a. Air Emergency or Air Craft Emergency, is a simply amazing and fascinating series that recreates some of the most maddening and disastrous airplane crashes and incidents in history. My personal favorite on this 6-episode set is ""Racing The Storm"", showing how pilot decisions plus bad weather plus changing conditions equals a ghastly crash that could have been avoided if even ONE of the links in the chain had been skipped. (For those unfamiliar: The ultimate cause of the crash was the cockpit crew forgetting to arm the plane's wing spoilers--flaps that ""spoil"" the airflow over the wings and transfer weight to the landing gear--thus dooming their already-dicey landing on a wet runway during a thunderstorm with wind shear.) The last 30 minutes of the flight, where everything changes from calm to chaotic, is recreated from the CVR and FDR and brilliantly re-enacted.My one gripe is that the DVDs themselves seem to be fairly cheaply made--my first set scratched up with just a handful of transfers in and out of my laptop's DVD player. It's a testimony to how good the series is that I'm willing to buy a new set just to get these episodes again.",4,"Amazing, fascinating",1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1168,"['Mayday', 'a.k.a', 'Air', 'Emergency', 'Air', 'Craft', 'Emergency', 'simply', 'amazing', 'fascinating', 'series', 'most', 'maddening', 'disastrous', 'airplane', 'crashes', 'incidents', 'history', 'personal', 'favorite', '6-episode', 'set', 'Racing', 'Storm', 'showing', 'how', 'pilot', 'decisions', 'bad', 'weather', 'changing', 'conditions', 'equals', 'ghastly', 'crash', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'even', 'ONE', 'links', 'chain', 'had', 'been', 'skipped', 'unfamiliar', 'ultimate', 'cause', 'crash', 'was', 'cockpit', 'crew', 'forgetting', 'arm', 'plane', 'wing', 'spoilers', 'spoil', 'airflow', 'wings', 'transfer', 'weight', 'landing', 'gear', 'thus', 'dooming', 'already-dicey', 'landing', 'wet', 'runway', 'thunderstorm', 'wind', 'shear', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'flight', 'where', 'everything', 'changes', 'calm', 'chaotic', 'recreated', 'CVR', 'FDR', 'brilliantly', 're-enacted.My', 'one', 'gripe', 'DVDs', 'seem', 'be', 'fairly', 'cheaply', 'made', 'first', 'set', 'scratched', 'up', 'just', 'handful', 'transfers', 'laptop', 'DVD', 'player', 'testimony', 'how', 'good', 'series', ""'m"", 'willing', 'buy', 'new', 'set', 'just', 'get', 'episodes', 'again']",Mayday: Air Disasters
