Season seven begins with the second half of the season six cliff-hanger &#34;Adrift.&#34;  Mac's engagement to Brumby comes to an abrupt end and that's just the first part of this excellent season.  Each of the actor's has settled into their roles and are all believable.  The military part of the show is true to life.  The uniforms and medals are correct and the military courtesies are also portrayed well.  This has always been one of my favorite series as are its spinoffs (NCIS and NCIS: LA). If you like courtroom and military drama then this is a must haves.  It certainly is for me.  One can watch these episodes over and over and never grow tired of them.  I definitely give this two thumbs up.,5,Love This Series,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,747,"['now', 'have', 'entire', 'ten', 'seasons', 'JAG', 'Season', 'seven', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'six', 'cliff-hanger', '34', 'Adrift.', '34', 'Mac', 'engagement', 'Brumby', 'abrupt', 'end', 'just', 'first', 'part', 'excellent', 'season', 'actor', 'settled', 'roles', 'are', 'believable', 'military', 'part', 'show', 'true', 'life', 'uniforms', 'medals', 'are', 'correct', 'military', 'courtesies', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'well', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'series', 'are', 'spinoffs', 'NCIS', 'NCIS', 'LA', 'like', 'courtroom', 'military', 'drama', 'then', 'must', 'haves', 'certainly', 'One', 'can', 'watch', 'episodes', 'never', 'grow', 'tired', 'definitely', 'give', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up']",JAG: Judge Advocate General- Season 7

Unfortunately because of my work I have missed a lot of episodes. I have 1 to 5 series but I wish they would release all of them so I can have them all- in one package. I think it is the best put together drama- the cast is excellent and they all seem to be perfect for their roles, all attuned to each other. Altho my main hero is David Elliott, everyone is integral to the quality of each episode, superbly written and acted. I have not seen a more handsome and well put together man in years.

It was a good tribute to our service men and women and showed them as normal human beings doing a difficult job that put their life on the line.  It also had its humorous moments in addition to the drama.  I have all 7 seasons released so far and love watching the shows again.
