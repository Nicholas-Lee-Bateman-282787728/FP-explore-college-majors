1624245,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00BBGZA9S,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Come on, every guy, and maybe every gal too, wants to be the first, the number one at doing something. Come on as well that every guy, and every gal, from hunger who was not born with a silver spoon in his or her mouth, and maybe a few of those too, wants to make a big-time money score. Those two ideas, those two worthy ideas, are what drive the mid-1950s film noir under review, Five Against The House. And just for one minute the two ideas come together as a certain nefarious scheme almost makes the nut. But of course those of us who have been down the noir road before know in our bones that the scheme cannot possibly work in a cinematic world where &#8220;crime does not pay.&#8221;Here is the skinny. Four college guys, law students, including two ex-Korean War buddies, Al (played by Guy Madison) and Brick who had saved Al&#8217;s life over there (played by Brian Keith), shades of Tennessee Williams&#8217; Brick in Cat On A Hot-Tin Roof, just back from the rigors of ranch life in California where one of the guys&#8217; father has a ranch stopped off at Harold&#8217;s Club in Reno on the way back to the greater rigors of college life. While there a career criminal type tried to rob the joint and got the slammer for his efforts. The lesson they learn from that event and from the mouth of the arresting officer is that no way in hell can anybody pull off that kind of caper in Reno casino land.This where the two ideas, being first and being rich, merge with one of the guys devising a master plan to commit the perfect crime by grabbing a million cool ones from Harold&#8217;s with no gun play and no traces left. He doesn&#8217;t care about the dough since he comes from dough, just being first. Brick though, Brick from hunger, and Brick who took quite a beating over in Korea and had spent time at a VA hospital for what we would now call PTSD had riches idea, easy street ideas. And so the plan unfolds, with another roommate thrown in to help.Problem was that the scheme needs four guys to work. That is where Al, who is head over heels over a townie and torch singer at a local night club, Kaye (played by Kim Novak with lip-synched singing), came in. Brick by hook or by crook brought Al in under false pretenses (and later to insure Al&#8217;s participation dragged Kaye in too). The caper naturally went off according to plan, Brick&#8217;s plan which involved actually keeping the dough and using some rough play with a gun if necessary. Of course no way that war-shattered, from hunger, and psychologically-scarred Brick was going to be able to keep the dough after he was confronted by Al who talked him into surrendering to the on-rushing police. Like I said crime does not pay in these noirs and here is example 256 for you.P.S. the story line of a bunch of college students, law students to boot, would have been more believable if just for one minute any of these four comrades actually looked at a book but maybe I am just being picky. I won&#8217;t even mention that as law students they all should have known crime does not pay and avoided the caper. Maybe I am just being picky again.",4,Out In The Be-Bop 1950s Noir Night,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,3123,"['Come', 'guy', 'maybe', 'gal', 'too', 'be', 'first', 'number', 'one', 'doing', 'something', 'Come', 'as', 'well', 'guy', 'gal', 'hunger', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'born', 'silver', 'spoon', 'mouth', 'maybe', 'few', 'too', 'make', 'big-time', 'money', 'score', 'two', 'ideas', 'two', 'worthy', 'ideas', 'are', 'what', 'mid-1950s', 'film', 'noir', 'review', 'Five', 'House', 'just', 'one', 'minute', 'two', 'ideas', 'come', 'together', 'certain', 'nefarious', 'scheme', 'almost', 'nut', 'course', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'down', 'noir', 'road', 'know', 'bones', 'scheme', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'work', 'cinematic', 'world', 'where', '8220', 'crime', 'not', 'pay.', '8221', 'Here', 'skinny', 'Four', 'college', 'guys', 'law', 'students', 'including', 'two', 'ex-Korean', 'War', 'buddies', 'Al', 'played', 'Guy', 'Madison', 'Brick', 'who', 'had', 'saved', 'Al', '8217', 's', 'life', 'there', 'played', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'shades', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', '8217', 'Brick', 'Cat', 'A', 'Hot-Tin', 'Roof', 'just', 'back', 'rigors', 'ranch', 'life', 'California', 'where', 'one', 'guys', '8217', 'ranch', 'stopped', 'off', 'Harold', '8217', 's', 'Club', 'Reno', 'way', 'back', 'greater', 'rigors', 'college', 'life', 'career', 'criminal', 'type', 'tried', 'rob', 'joint', 'got', 'slammer', 'efforts', 'lesson', 'learn', 'event', 'mouth', 'arresting', 'officer', 'way', 'hell', 'can', 'anybody', 'pull', 'off', 'kind', 'caper', 'Reno', 'casino', 'land.This', 'where', 'two', 'ideas', 'being', 'first', 'being', 'rich', 'merge', 'one', 'guys', 'devising', 'master', 'plan', 'commit', 'perfect', 'crime', 'grabbing', 'million', 'cool', 'ones', 'Harold', '8217', 's', 'gun', 'play', 'traces', 'left', '8217', 'care', 'dough', 'dough', 'just', 'being', 'first', 'Brick', 'Brick', 'hunger', 'Brick', 'who', 'took', 'quite', 'beating', 'over', 'Korea', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'VA', 'hospital', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'call', 'PTSD', 'had', 'riches', 'idea', 'easy', 'street', 'ideas', 'so', 'plan', 'roommate', 'thrown', 'help.Problem', 'was', 'scheme', 'four', 'guys', 'work', 'where', 'Al', 'who', 'head', 'heels', 'townie', 'torch', 'singer', 'local', 'night', 'club', 'Kaye', 'played', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'lip-synched', 'singing', 'came', 'Brick', 'hook', 'crook', 'brought', 'Al', 'false', 'pretenses', 'later', 'insure', 'Al', '8217', 'participation', 'dragged', 'Kaye', 'too', 'caper', 'naturally', 'went', 'according', 'plan', 'Brick', '8217', 's', 'plan', 'involved', 'actually', 'keeping', 'dough', 'using', 'rough', 'play', 'gun', 'necessary', 'course', 'way', 'war-shattered', 'hunger', 'psychologically-scarred', 'Brick', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'dough', 'was', 'confronted', 'Al', 'who', 'talked', 'surrendering', 'on-rushing', 'police', 'said', 'crime', 'not', 'pay', 'noirs', 'here', 'example', '256', 'you.P.S', 'story', 'line', 'bunch', 'college', 'students', 'law', 'students', 'boot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'just', 'one', 'minute', 'four', 'comrades', 'actually', 'looked', 'book', 'maybe', 'am', 'just', 'being', 'picky', 'won', '8217', 'even', 'mention', 'law', 'students', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'crime', 'not', 'pay', 'avoided', 'caper', 'Maybe', 'am', 'just', 'being', 'picky', 'again']",5 Against the House

However, I can appreciate the time in which these movies were made, and am intrigued by all aspects of these movies - the actors, the sets, the production, and - of course, the sexy Ms. Novak!

1624247,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B00BBGZA9S,Doug Erlandson,"[2, 2]","I first saw ""Five Against the House"" on late-night TV in the early 1960s. While it's not a great movie, it's worth watching for several reasons.First, it features Brian Keith and Kim Novak, both of whom went on to have great acting careers. Their performance in this movie demonstrates their potential.Second, the first part of the movie, much of which is set on a Midwestern campus, is a humorous and somewhat accurate portrayal of college life in the 1950s (well before the days of the Animal House mentality). The treatment that the four upperclassmen housemates accord to the freshman fellow they've enlisted as their lackey is classic (although it's never quite explained why this fellow continues to willingly subject himself to their abuse).Third, the plot they concoct to rob Harold's Club in Reno is actually ingenious. Of course, we all know it's not going to work because something will go wrong (which it does). But in the meantime we're kept in suspense, and given that these are five college kids trying to stick it to the establishment, we're going to root for them to succeed.Finally, Brian Keith's performance of a Korean War vet with severe psychological problems (he's spent time in a mental institution prior to enrolling in college) is outstanding, realistic, and compelling.It's a movie worth watching on an evening when you're tired, don't want to have to think too much, but want to be entertained.",4,"Not great, but it has some good actors.",1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1422,"['first', 'saw', 'Five', 'House', 'late-night', 'TV', 'early', '1960s', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'several', 'reasons.First', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'whom', 'went', 'have', 'great', 'acting', 'careers', 'performance', 'movie', 'potential.Second', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'much', 'set', 'Midwestern', 'campus', 'humorous', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'college', 'life', '1950s', 'well', 'days', 'Animal', 'House', 'mentality', 'treatment', 'four', 'upperclassmen', 'accord', 'freshman', 'fellow', ""'ve"", 'enlisted', 'lackey', 'classic', 'never', 'quite', 'explained', 'why', 'fellow', 'willingly', 'subject', 'abuse', '.Third', 'plot', 'concoct', 'rob', 'Harold', 'Club', 'Reno', 'actually', 'ingenious', 'course', 'know', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'something', 'will', 'go', 'wrong', 'meantime', ""'re"", 'kept', 'suspense', 'given', 'are', 'five', 'college', 'kids', 'trying', 'stick', 'establishment', ""'re"", 'going', 'root', 'succeed.Finally', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'performance', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'severe', 'psychological', 'problems', 'spent', 'time', 'mental', 'institution', 'prior', 'enrolling', 'college', 'outstanding', 'realistic', 'compelling.It', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'evening', 'when', ""'re"", 'tired', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'want', 'be', 'entertained']",5 Against the House

1624249,A18F8WL8CASPVN,B00BBGZA9S,"Ron4Sure ""Ron M.""","[1, 1]","A very uneven film, with the plot all over the map, until about three-quarters of the way through, when it decides to be a heist-caper movie.  In the opening, it's about four college guys and Kim Novak, the girlfriend of one of them.  There's a lot of zippy, somewhat sophomoric, smart aleck dialogue, at times cute, but not relevant to the through-line of the story.  The characters and the intentions of the plot are out of focus.  One of the four guys is Brian Keith, evidently a war buddy of one of the others, and he apparently has been released from a mental hospital.  He has a nasty temper and a short fuse.  Anyway, the college chums go on a gambling jaunt to a Las Vegas casino, during which an attempted robbery takes place.  They return to campus, and a good stretch of the film devotes itself to the romance between Kim Novak and one of the college guys.  She's hesitant to commit to marriage, and so there is much back and forth, until finally she agrees to get married.  It is at this point that the other college buddies, unbeknown to the one who is about to get married, concoct a scheme to rob the same Las Vegas casino they had earlier visited.  This involves a trailer that they use to transport a duplicate casino pushcart in.  When the about-to-marry guy realizes he's been sucked into a dangerous scheme, he balks, and the Brian Keith character essentially seizes control of the situation with a gun and strongarms the others into following through with the robbery.",3,Story arc extremely uneven,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,1489,"['very', 'uneven', 'film', 'plot', 'map', 'three-quarters', 'way', 'when', 'be', 'heist-caper', 'movie', 'opening', 'four', 'college', 'guys', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'lot', 'zippy', 'somewhat', 'sophomoric', 'smart', 'aleck', 'dialogue', 'times', 'cute', 'not', 'relevant', 'through-line', 'story', 'characters', 'intentions', 'plot', 'are', 'focus', 'One', 'four', 'guys', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'evidently', 'war', 'buddy', 'one', 'others', 'apparently', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'nasty', 'temper', 'short', 'fuse', 'Anyway', 'college', 'chums', 'go', 'gambling', 'jaunt', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'casino', 'attempted', 'robbery', 'place', 'return', 'campus', 'good', 'stretch', 'film', 'romance', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'one', 'college', 'guys', 'hesitant', 'commit', 'marriage', 'so', 'much', 'back', 'forth', 'finally', 'get', 'married', 'point', 'other', 'college', 'buddies', 'unbeknown', 'one', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'concoct', 'scheme', 'rob', 'same', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'casino', 'had', 'earlier', 'visited', 'trailer', 'use', 'transport', 'duplicate', 'casino', 'pushcart', 'When', 'about-to-marry', 'guy', 'been', 'sucked', 'dangerous', 'scheme', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'character', 'essentially', 'control', 'situation', 'gun', 'others', 'following', 'robbery']",5 Against the House
