It gives the impression of being written in a different language and then translated by non-native speaker isn't English. It's trying to be a romantic comedy but has puritanical, semi-rauncy sex scenes, foul language, weird obsession with a helicopter rental that the producers decided must be shown as much as possible, tacky sets that are supposed to be elegant and last but not lease the great Elliot Gould being terrible underutilized.

The guy seemed like he didn't have common sense with the actions he did cheating on his wife just for his work.  However, by the last part of the movie it ended up continuing to be funny and a twist that was slightly predictable but important and good message.
