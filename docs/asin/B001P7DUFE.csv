1225914,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B001P7DUFE,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[0, 0]","I first saw/ purchased this DVD a couple years back - but this superb 'American Experience' documentary sheds more than a bit of 'light' on one of the most brilliant (but also enigmatic & intensely complex/contradictory) scientists in American history = J. Robert Oppenheimer (Director of the 'Manhattan Project' during WWII).  Prior to seeing this documentary, I had already read the highly acclaimed, award winning biography called ""American Prometheus"" (by Kai Bird, and Martin Sherwin).  And as informative and insightful (and also surprisingly enjoyable) as the biography was to read - I found this 'American Experience' documentary to be the perfect enhancement/ companion piece to that fine book!  This documentary also brought Oppenheimer 'to Life' thru actor David Strathairn's* incredible (and almost uncanny) portrayal. I think Oppenheimer's story is a truly fascinating one, not only due to the ground-breaking, and unprecedented scientific achievement (of harnessing atomic energy, and in effect, ending any possibility of the continuation of WWII ) - but also the resultant introduction of the many moral 'dilemmas' to be faced by those who had the knowledge & ability to wield such devastating power.  And even Oppenheimer's incredibly brilliant mind was, in many ways, unable to fully reconcile, or clearly solve the most perplexing calculation/ ultimate riddle of how to adequately control, and wisely utilize such a potentially destructive force (and of course, there was no way to put the genie back in the bottle).  Thankfully, we all made it beyond the most tenuous/ uncertain of times (moving safely past the fall of the Berlin Wall, and end to the Cold War).  But definite traces of those original worries/ dilemmas, and potential threats, unfortunately still linger into the present day - ensuring the relevancy of this exceptionally fine documentary.*interesting note:  David Strathairn already portrayed Oppenheimer much earlier, in the excellent historical drama (originally broadcast on CBS, in 1989), called 'Day One' also primarily about the 'Manhattan Project'",5,Absolutely Riveting Documentary on America's most Intriguing & Enigmatic scientific Mind!,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2091,"['first', 'saw/', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'superb', ""'American"", 'Experience', 'documentary', 'sheds', 'more', 'bit', ""'light"", 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'also', 'enigmatic', 'intensely', 'complex/contradictory', 'scientists', 'American', 'history', '=', 'J.', 'Robert', 'Oppenheimer', 'Director', ""'Manhattan"", 'Project', 'WWII', 'Prior', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'had', 'already', 'read', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'award', 'winning', 'biography', 'called', 'American', 'Prometheus', 'Kai', 'Bird', 'Martin', 'Sherwin', 'informative', 'insightful', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'biography', 'was', 'read', 'found', ""'American"", 'Experience', 'documentary', 'be', 'perfect', 'enhancement/', 'companion', 'piece', 'fine', 'book', 'documentary', 'also', 'brought', 'Oppenheimer', ""'to"", 'Life', 'thru', 'actor', 'David', ""Strathairn's*"", 'incredible', 'almost', 'uncanny', 'portrayal', 'think', 'Oppenheimer', 'story', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'due', 'ground-breaking', 'unprecedented', 'scientific', 'achievement', 'harnessing', 'atomic', 'energy', 'effect', 'ending', 'possibility', 'continuation', 'WWII', 'also', 'resultant', 'introduction', 'many', 'moral', ""'dilemmas"", 'be', 'faced', 'who', 'had', 'knowledge', 'ability', 'wield', 'such', 'devastating', 'power', 'even', 'Oppenheimer', 'incredibly', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'unable', 'fully', 'reconcile', 'clearly', 'solve', 'most', 'perplexing', 'calculation/', 'ultimate', 'riddle', 'how', 'adequately', 'control', 'wisely', 'utilize', 'such', 'potentially', 'destructive', 'force', 'course', 'was', 'way', 'put', 'genie', 'back', 'bottle', 'Thankfully', 'made', 'most', 'tenuous/', 'uncertain', 'times', 'moving', 'safely', 'fall', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'definite', 'traces', 'original', 'worries/', 'dilemmas', 'potential', 'threats', 'unfortunately', 'still', 'linger', 'present', 'day', 'ensuring', 'relevancy', 'exceptionally', 'fine', 'documentary', '*interesting', 'note', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'already', 'portrayed', 'Oppenheimer', 'much', 'earlier', 'excellent', 'historical', 'drama', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'CBS', '1989', 'called', ""'Day"", 'One', 'also', 'primarily', ""'Manhattan"", 'Project']",American Experience: The Trials of J.

Several good books have recently been published on Oppenheimer that tell the ""rest of the story"", but this is by far the best video I have seen that does likewise. Strathairn, a fine, in my opinion underrated, actor, portrayed Oppenheimer in an earlier film, ""Day One"" and returns here to write what is almost the final chapter in this man's life.

1225919,A2V92F5R7MLCVI,B001P7DUFE,wogan,"[7, 8]","David Strathaim is the perfect actor to play the beleaguered Robert Oppenheimer, even resembling him physically. I wish they had included the poignant episode where walking in the desert after the explosion of the first atomic bomb; a turtle crosses his way. He picks it up to bring home to his daughter. After a while he stops, turns around and goes back and places it again precisely where he took it with a remark that he has already done enough damage to the world. This, for me has always summed up his conflict - building the bomb and as the film is careful to point out in several instances helping and advising how to drop the bomb to create the most destruction.What and where the hearings occurred that took his clearance away and seemed to destroy him emotionally are described and recreated. Using transcripts of the trials Oppenheimer's problems with the communist witch hunt are shown. Using real pictures of Oppenheimer and then the recreations of him by David Strathaim we see the exquisite details of his mind and how it worked. What really comes out is Oppenheimer`s naivety in how his connections with communist party members would affect him.It is interesting and I wish they could have  made clearer why General Groves chose him over much incredulity to head the Manhattan Project.As with so many films of this genera the `talking heads' can be distracting and or boring. I have especially found that students in school have an marked dislike to this use of someone looking at the camera explaining their experiences. I have to admit they could give these interviewees their bit of  `fame' and then use their narration over pictures and films rather than sitting and watching someone talking to the camera.However, as with most DVD's of the American Experience series the subject is well covered with great accuracy and a high interest factor to those who wish to learn more about history.There are director's comment in the extras, explaining who Oppenheimer was and what happened to him.
