It almost makes sense that he died underheard, underpaid, censored and young.The good news is that most of the things he railed against way back in the early 90s -- the war in Iraq, President Bush, awful pop music, closed-mindedness against drugs, corporate co-opting, advertising and smoking -- are all still pretty fresh topics.This DVD includes his 1991 performance at Chicago's Old Vic Theatre (which was made as an HBO ""One Night Stand""), his 1991 gig at the Montreal International Comedy Festival, his 1991 ""Revelations"" show at the Dominion Theatre in England and the documentary about his career, ""It's Just a Ride,"" which aired in chopped-up form on Comedy Central years ago.It's a great collection of material that is frightening, harrowing, intense and always, always incredibly funny.

The crowd was full of people whom I recognised from music gigs around town and they gave him the kind of reception normally reserved for the gods of the rock pantheon (which he helped by coming out to Purple Haze and closing with Tomorrow Never Knows). I guess I was the perfect age at the perfect time to be receptive to his message and delivery - I too was angry at lying governments and hookwinking ad execs, and full of rock and roll spirit. I raved about him to everyone and bought all the CDs. He captured the early 90s perfectly - I was crushed when he died and to my mind there hasn't been anyone like him since. But watching this DVD all these years later, I realise that his schtick was not specific to our times. In some way everything he said was timeless- trust your own judgement,make informed choices, get out and see the world with your own eyes -he could have been a sophist fer chrissake!

855116,A1VDA6GS3N714H,B0004Z33FK,"Guy Denutte ""A concerned citizen""","[3, 3]","Lenny Bruce paved the way so that George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Bill Maher, Lewis Black, etc. could talk the way they talk on stage, using ""the seven words you can never say on television"", that are, incidentally, the same ""seven words you can never use in an amazon review"".But Bill Hicks is the comedian using those very words in the most intelligent way, breaking up many other social taboos at the same time.  What is even more remarkable is that he did so at a very young age.  He was the first to openly talk on masturbation on stage.  He was the first - and I think still the only one - to say ""I love pornography"" on stage.  His stand on drugs is also brilliant : ""It is not a very popular truth.  You don't hear it very often... I don't do drugs... anymore...  Done drugs before.  Had a good time on drugs and have absolutely nothing whatsoever against them.""  And gays in the military : ""Anyone... dumb enough... to be in the military... should be allowed in.""He is also unequaled in his interacting with the audience.  ""I can talk for every man in the room... tonight... and I will...""  Or when he laughs with the round of applause he got from the smokers and ""the energy they put out at will"", then lights up a cigarette, and begins picking on the non-smokers.But what makes him really great was his political understanding of how the country really works.  He said that in the US, ""there is only one party, the BUSINESS PARTY"".  Hicks has this great bit on what happens when a new president is elected.  After the ceremony, the new president is taken to a small room, where 12 of the top CEO's are awaiting, and is shown, from an angle nobody has ever seen before, footage of the Kennedy assassination...  ""Any questions, Mr. President ?""Therefore, I think, should he still be alive, he would be joking on 9/11.  9/11 makes great stand-up material.  Think of it.  The collapse of the twin towers occurred in 10 seconds, following the path of the GREATEST RESISTANCE.  Ten seconds, that is free-fall speed.  That is physically impossible, unless... we use explosives...  Al Qaeda couldn't do it.  They tried it in 1993.  It didn't work out too good for them.  The building didn't move a millimeter.  So WE DID IT.  Because ""WE ARE THE EVIL EMPIRE"".  (This is an exact quote.)And you also have the hole in the Pentagon too small for a Boeing to fit in.  The Arab pilots performing complicated maneuvers with Boeings in a perfect way, although... they couldn't even fly a Cessna...  Worse : they were not even aboard, as we soon would find out, with 6 of them still working and living happily in Saudi Arabia and Morocco.Also GMO's make great stand up.  When testing the ""eternal life"" tomato, rats needed to be force-fed.  They knew why.  Seven of forty animals died within two weeks.  Consequently... the tomato was... approved....  by the FDA...  for human consumption...  Huh ?  But some firms are aware of the dangers.  Ben & Jerry's literally ""oppose recombinant BGH"".  That is what the package of their ice-cream says.  This made Monsanto blame them to be using ""marketing tricks"" to sell more ice-cream.  Ben Cohen's - co founder of Ben & Jerry's -reaction was : ""Of course, it is in our self-interest.  We want to keep our customers alive !  They eat more ice-cream when they are alive !""  This reaction of Ben Cohen is exactly what Hicks said in his bit on Judas Priest, after two of their fans died.Following his mum, Bill was a preacher.  He went along with that.  He said he was ""spreading the truth"".Bertold Brecht once said that dark ages are characterized by the fact that the truth has to be argued.  We live in such ages.  People believe all the lies governments and big business are spreading through the mass media.  Will the next Bill Hicks please stand up ?

855117,A153MVFR0FTI6O,B0004Z33FK,John Nelson,"[3, 7]","Bill ends one of the concerts on this disc with his thought of how if we the world, put our weapons down, it would be possible to feed and clothe everyone on the planet and give us all the chance to explore outerspace together in peace in harmony.  Far fetched to be sure, but isn't it a beautiful vision for a world we can dream for?  Shortly before this he tells the audience that the good die young yet demons live on.  Could Hick's death not too much later cement that theory?  I don't love everything Hicks says and he was hardly a saint, but I do belive that the man had a vision that was devoted to the betterment of mankind and unlike many today could back up his claims that could honestly make even a staunch non beliver scratch his head and wonder.This DVD collects Bill's offical TV recordings and unfortunatley a lot of the same material gets covered on all three shows.  Even worse, is if you have heard the CD's, ALOT of it's the same.  Bill is reported to have tape recorded a lot of his shows, at the very least audio recorded.  Wouldn't that have been more fun and interesting not to mention new for those of us who don't have our hands on the oodles of Hick's bootleg stuff outthere?  A fourth show has many comedians talk about their love of Hicks, and how they influenced them.  Ironically enough Jay Leno is here and has some nice words to say.  Makes me wonder when this was before or after hearing the ""Jay Leno with an Uzi"" bit from RANT IN E MINOR, a bit which I nearly busted ribs hearing the first time.Alas, no great improvments to the video quality in terms of remastering or anything, in fact one of the tracks notes that you can skip over scenes that are less then watchable quality.It is because of this and the lack of fresh material that I cannot give the disc a 5 star review. The disc was still worthwhile however for the new material not on CD's and the documentary thats on here as well as seeing Hicks perform which is a plus.  I will close but before I do I will stop and wonder what Hicks would have to say about events going on today and since his death in 94.  Lets go over a few of them.  Flight 800, the Clinton Lewinski affair, The movie Showgirls (quick capsule review anyone?)

Though I only got to see him onstage for one week's worth of shows in 1987, his body of work thankfully became more commercially available over the next decade.Hicks is one of the rare comics with a point of view that both skewers and embraces Mankind.  He loved his country and his fellow man, and that gave him license to stab and poke at their flaws.  He championed THOUGHT as the means to combat Mediocrity and the Sheep Mentality.This DVD is a sufficient look into his mastery of his craft and his unflinching control over his audience.  Sometimes his control of the audience was mixed with disdain towards them, too.  But it was closer to ""tough love"" than animosity or condescension.Not everyone will recognize Bill's brilliance and not everyone will ""get"" the humor.

855132,AK61LQI92GTCH,B0004Z33FK,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[9, 12]","Three taped comedy concerts and one documentary on his life (""Just a Ride"") make for an awful lot of Bill Hicks for the uninitiated.  The concerts are ""One Night Stand,"" ""Revelations,"" and ""Relentless,"" and, when Hick's at his best, they're apt descriptions of his effect.  The targets include the religious right, Republicans, and, by his standards, various and sundry other moral hypocrites.  The style is aggression bordering on passion.  Hicks has his loyal fans - Goat Children - but I was like an agnostic at a revival meeting.  Rather than salvation through laughter I found Hicks more thought provoking that rib tickling.  At least the first time through.The big problem is that there's a lot of repeat material in all three concerts.  Hicks, who died in 1994, recorded all three in the early nineties, and I guess some repetition can be expected and forgiven.  It gets a little leaden when you watch them back to back to back, though.The second problem concerns the documentary.  Unforgivably they tell you when Hicks died but not the cause of death (pancreatic cancer.)  As you've probably read in the product description the documentary includes Brett Butler, Jay Leno, and David Letterman, among others.  The second sin committed by the documentary is allowing David Letterman to express his personal regret about the Hicks's last appearance on his late night show, which was censored, without explaining why or what material was cut. If a `net search is correct it had to do with something Hicks said that offended pro-lifers. In all, a pleasantly amusing three hours, lots of repeats, and not enough to send me shopping for Bill Hicks concert cds anytime soon.",3,Echoes,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,1674,"['Three', 'taped', 'comedy', 'concerts', 'one', 'documentary', 'life', 'Just', 'Ride', 'make', 'awful', 'lot', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'uninitiated', 'concerts', 'are', 'One', 'Night', 'Stand', 'Revelations', 'Relentless', 'when', 'Hick', 'best', ""'re"", 'apt', 'descriptions', 'effect', 'targets', 'include', 'religious', 'right', 'Republicans', 'standards', 'various', 'sundry', 'other', 'moral', 'hypocrites', 'style', 'aggression', 'bordering', 'passion', 'Hicks', 'loyal', 'fans', 'Goat', 'Children', 'was', 'agnostic', 'revival', 'meeting', 'Rather', 'salvation', 'laughter', 'found', 'Hicks', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'rib', 'tickling', 'least', 'first', 'time', 'through.The', 'big', 'problem', 'lot', 'repeat', 'material', 'three', 'concerts', 'Hicks', 'who', 'died', '1994', 'recorded', 'three', 'early', 'nineties', 'guess', 'repetition', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'forgiven', 'little', 'leaden', 'when', 'watch', 'back', 'back', 'back', 'though.The', 'second', 'problem', 'documentary', 'Unforgivably', 'tell', 'when', 'Hicks', 'died', 'not', 'cause', 'death', 'pancreatic', 'cancer', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'read', 'product', 'description', 'documentary', 'Brett', 'Butler', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'David', 'Letterman', 'others', 'second', 'sin', 'committed', 'documentary', 'allowing', 'David', 'Letterman', 'express', 'personal', 'regret', 'Hicks', 'last', 'appearance', 'late', 'night', 'show', 'was', 'censored', 'explaining', 'why', 'what', 'material', 'was', 'cut', 'net', 'search', 'correct', 'had', 'do', 'something', 'Hicks', 'said', 'offended', 'pro-lifers', 'pleasantly', 'amusing', 'three', 'hours', 'lots', 'repeats', 'not', 'enough', 'send', 'shopping', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'concert', 'cds', 'anytime', 'soon']","Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian"

Hicks was a great social commentator who could draw laughter out of a crowd, but almost as importantly, he made people think. The problem that Hicks has with new audiences and even American audiences during his ""hey day"" was that he was talking about subjects that just didn't get  brought into the mainstream. You didn't make jokes about American exceptionalism, the media, abortion, religion, suicide, and the Gulf War at that time. It was not good for one's career. On those issues, we were simply supposed to think the way we were told. That's probably why Hicks didn't take off with American audiences until now. England got him. They understood him more than just ""joke"" comic. He took his audience on a journey into his mind and with that helped them to explore the way they saw the world. English audiences allowed him to take on subjects that the American media didn't think the American people could handle.If you are not prone to want to think about what a comic was saying within the context of their time, then skip this. It's not for people who think Larry The Cable Guy is a hoot. The subject matter and the time in which Hicks was bringing that to the public is simply better than that. Not that there is anything wrong with laughing at Sinbad, Cable Guy, or any of those guys, but you just have to check your brain at the door. When watching this, put yourself in the mindset that it's 1990 or so. Or, watch 2 or 3 other comics doing sets at this time and then watch Hicks. He was ahead of his time and it's a shame it's taken 20 years for people to catch on, because now there is nothing new from Hicks to draw from.If you love stand up and its history, or are a big fan of Hicks, you should buy this DVD. It's a reminder that we don't have to accept dumb downed, mediocrity from those who want us to stay in line, thinking the same way, acting the same way and perceiving life in the same way. Hicks saw things through his own mind and encouraged others to do the same.",4,"Hicks was genius, but this DVD isn't for everyone.",1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2072,"['only', 'hesitate', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'material', 'lap', 'DVD', 'Hicks', 'was', 'great', 'social', 'commentator', 'who', 'could', 'draw', 'laughter', 'crowd', 'almost', 'importantly', 'made', 'people', 'think', 'problem', 'Hicks', 'new', 'audiences', 'even', 'American', 'audiences', 'hey', 'day', 'was', 'was', 'talking', 'subjects', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'brought', 'mainstream', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'jokes', 'American', 'exceptionalism', 'media', 'abortion', 'religion', 'suicide', 'Gulf', 'War', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'career', 'issues', 'were', 'simply', 'supposed', 'think', 'way', 'were', 'told', 'probably', 'why', 'Hicks', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'American', 'audiences', 'now', 'England', 'got', 'understood', 'more', 'just', 'joke', 'comic', 'took', 'audience', 'journey', 'mind', 'helped', 'explore', 'way', 'saw', 'world', 'English', 'audiences', 'allowed', 'take', 'subjects', 'American', 'media', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'American', 'people', 'could', 'handle.If', 'are', 'not', 'prone', 'want', 'think', 'what', 'comic', 'was', 'saying', 'context', 'time', 'then', 'skip', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'hoot', 'subject', 'matter', 'time', 'Hicks', 'was', 'bringing', 'public', 'simply', 'better', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'laughing', 'Sinbad', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'guys', 'just', 'have', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'When', 'watching', 'put', 'mindset', '1990', 'so', 'watch', '2', '3', 'other', 'comics', 'doing', 'sets', 'time', 'then', 'watch', 'Hicks', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'shame', 'taken', '20', 'years', 'people', 'catch', 'now', 'nothing', 'new', 'Hicks', 'draw', 'from.If', 'love', 'stand', 'up', 'history', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'Hicks', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD', 'reminder', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'accept', 'dumb', 'downed', 'mediocrity', 'who', 'want', 'stay', 'line', 'thinking', 'same', 'way', 'acting', 'same', 'way', 'perceiving', 'life', 'same', 'way', 'Hicks', 'saw', 'things', 'own', 'mind', 'encouraged', 'others', 'do', 'same']","Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian"
855134,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0004Z33FK,Wheelchair Assassin,"[7, 10]","I must admit, when I watched Bill Hicks Live: Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian a few months ago (my first exposure to his material), I wasn't all that impressed.  There were certainly parts that made me laugh, but for whatever reason his act just seemed a little too odd, a little too unhinged, a little too disjointed for me.  But a funny thing happened in the ensuing few weeks: I started thinking more and more about his statements at random moments, at work, at home, in the car, wherever.  I'd hear about some laughable clownishness emanating from Washington or some such place and be reminded of some particularly apt remark Hicks had made on a related subject.  I started quoting from the three specials on this disc to friends and family, and always getting a laugh out of them.  Somehow, Hicks's act just got into my head and stayed there, and it hasn't left since.For those Americans tired of being squeezed by the ominous forces of political correctness on one side and growing neo-puritanism on the other, Hicks's comedy may not provide too many solutions, but it will almost certainly provide some laughs.  Delivering his rants in a deliriously profane and sardonic matter, Hicks wielded the dual weapons of reason and common sense to prove that the pen is truly mightier than the sword, at least when it comes to exposing the numerous foibles of humanity.  Hicks touched on subjects ranging from drugs to the government to religion to war and well beyond, but whatever he was talking about at a given moment Hicks managed to cut through the sloganeering that so often passes for debate in this day and age and expose the absurdity of the moral pretensions and false pieties that so often cloud our thinking.  Special attention is devoted to those who, always in the name of our best interests, seek to control and manipulate us every chance they get: smoking fascists, anti-pornography crusaders, drug warriors, and various other menaces to freedom and logic.Ignorance, prejudice, and just plain stupidity all get put under a microscope in these three specials as Hicks mocks deeply held beliefs of all stripes and slays sacred cows with abandon.  In one especially telling sequence, Hicks launches into a vitriolic assault on Christianity, then recounts being confronted after a show down South by three self-identified Christians who took issue with his atheistic beliefs.  Hicks's response?  ""Oh yeah?  Then forgive me.""  Perhaps at no other point does Hicks do a better job of highlighting hypocrisy and narrowmindedness, and he pulls it off in just two brief sentences.  It's just too bad Hicks met his untimely end in 1994 at the age of 32; I'm sure he'd have had a field day with the current climate in this country.  At any rate, all thinking people should give this DVD a look.",4,"Come back Bill, we could use you right now",1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,2810,"['must', 'admit', 'when', 'watched', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'Live', 'Satirist', 'Social', 'Critic', 'Stand-Up', 'Comedian', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'first', 'exposure', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'were', 'certainly', 'parts', 'made', 'laugh', 'reason', 'act', 'just', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'odd', 'little', 'too', 'unhinged', 'little', 'too', 'disjointed', 'funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'ensuing', 'few', 'weeks', 'started', 'thinking', 'more', 'more', 'statements', 'random', 'moments', 'work', 'home', 'car', 'wherever', ""'d"", 'hear', 'laughable', 'clownishness', 'emanating', 'Washington', 'such', 'place', 'be', 'reminded', 'particularly', 'apt', 'remark', 'Hicks', 'had', 'made', 'related', 'subject', 'started', 'quoting', 'three', 'specials', 'disc', 'friends', 'family', 'always', 'getting', 'laugh', 'Somehow', 'Hicks', 'act', 'just', 'got', 'head', 'stayed', 'there', ""n't"", 'left', 'since.For', 'Americans', 'tired', 'being', 'squeezed', 'ominous', 'forces', 'political', 'correctness', 'one', 'side', 'growing', 'neo-puritanism', 'other', 'Hicks', 'comedy', 'may', 'not', 'provide', 'too', 'many', 'solutions', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'provide', 'laughs', 'Delivering', 'rants', 'deliriously', 'profane', 'sardonic', 'matter', 'Hicks', 'wielded', 'dual', 'weapons', 'reason', 'common', 'sense', 'prove', 'pen', 'truly', 'mightier', 'sword', 'least', 'when', 'exposing', 'numerous', 'foibles', 'humanity', 'Hicks', 'touched', 'subjects', 'ranging', 'drugs', 'government', 'religion', 'war', 'well', 'whatever', 'was', 'talking', 'about', 'given', 'moment', 'Hicks', 'managed', 'cut', 'sloganeering', 'so', 'often', 'debate', 'day', 'age', 'expose', 'absurdity', 'moral', 'pretensions', 'false', 'pieties', 'so', 'often', 'cloud', 'thinking', 'Special', 'attention', 'devoted', 'who', 'always', 'name', 'best', 'interests', 'seek', 'control', 'manipulate', 'chance', 'get', 'smoking', 'fascists', 'anti-pornography', 'crusaders', 'drug', 'warriors', 'various', 'other', 'menaces', 'freedom', 'logic.Ignorance', 'prejudice', 'just', 'plain', 'stupidity', 'get', 'put', 'microscope', 'three', 'specials', 'Hicks', 'mocks', 'deeply', 'held', 'beliefs', 'stripes', 'slays', 'sacred', 'cows', 'abandon', 'one', 'especially', 'telling', 'sequence', 'Hicks', 'vitriolic', 'assault', 'Christianity', 'then', 'being', 'confronted', 'show', 'down', 'South', 'three', 'self-identified', 'Christians', 'who', 'took', 'issue', 'atheistic', 'beliefs', 'Hicks', 'response', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Then', 'forgive', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'point', 'Hicks', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'highlighting', 'hypocrisy', 'narrowmindedness', 'off', 'just', 'two', 'brief', 'sentences', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'Hicks', 'met', 'untimely', 'end', '1994', 'age', '32', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'current', 'climate', 'country', 'rate', 'thinking', 'people', 'should', 'give', 'DVD', 'look']","Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian"
