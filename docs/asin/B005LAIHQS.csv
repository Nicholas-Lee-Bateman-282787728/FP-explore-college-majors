1471904,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B005LAIHQS,A. Gavin,"[0, 0]","I picked this up because of the time travel angle, but it turned out to be a pretty fun film. It's not high art, and in fact it doesn't have anything new to say about time travel, or anything else either. It's also a ridiculous romp. A clear guilty pleasure.We begin with a good villain: Borris the Animal. He's plenty zany and has one arm and a face hugger that lives in his remaining hand. He also has it out for Tommy Lee Jones, who locked him up 40 years earlier. When he breaks out of his lunar prison, he wants nothing more than to travel back in time and kill our taciturn hero. Which he does. Will Smith then has to head back himself and put things to right.Josh Brolin plays ""young Agent K"" (Jones). The resemblance is uncanny, in looks, in voice, in mannerism. Jones himself isn't even in the film for more than a few minutes. There isn't any time travel paradox here. There's just hunt down the villain and try to kill him. But the film luxuriates in campy 1969 visual gags. Costumes, Andy Wharhol, the Apollo 11 launch, and so on. It's like Madmen without the drama. The rocket launch really is pretty cool.MIB puts its money on screen. There isn't a normal shot in the whole film. Aliens abound. Not exactly realistic. The tech difference over 40 years is handled in the same over-simplified manner as in X-men first class. Everything is the same, except it was bigger then, with 60s styling. Guns: bigger. Memory eraser: bigger. Aliens, definitely bigger (and slimier).Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire`s Arnold Rothstein) plays a very amusing four dimensional being. Defiantly found him groovy.

As it turns out, an extraterrestrial menace has broken free from a prison on the moon, gone back in time and terminated K's life back in the `60s. In order to save the galaxy and his partner, J heads back in time and meets with a younger K (Josh Brolin, brilliantly mimicking Jones' mannerisms and delivery) in order to stop the vile Boris the Terrible (Jemaine Clement).The first two ""Men in Black"" films got by due to the chemistry between the stars, although I found both pictures to be hollow, one-joke pictures that relied too heavily on special effects. Despite a great deal of trouble behind the scenes with this third installment (production had to be shut down for several weeks while the script was reworked), ""Men in Black 3"" relies more strongly on its characters and what turns out to be a poignant story line as opposed to a neverending succession of wacky aliens and make-up FX. The film does have - as cliched as it sounds - a lot more heart than its predecessors, with Smith seeming more engaged, Brolin giving a lively performance, and Michael Stuhlbarg chipping in a particularly noteworthy role as a benign, Mork-like alien who spends his life perpetually analyzing possible future outcomes.Director Barry Sonnenfeld helms the material without as much of a frenetic hand this time around - something that might disappoint viewers expecting a larger and louder sequel, but a decision that makes for a more satisfying and developed dramatic experience than its predecessors.Sony's Blu-Ray offerings include a good looking 2D presentation of the film (1080p AVC encoded transfer, DTS MA audio) as well as a fairly effective 3D rendering with decent depth-of-field effects. Extras include an Ultraviolet copy, DVD, and fairly light supplements taking viewers behind the scenes with roughly an hour of content on the 2D BD and a couple of brief extras exclusive to the 3D BD (including a very short look at the conversion process).",4,A Pleasant Surprise,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,2234,"['Having', 'not', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Men', 'Black', 'terrible', '2002', 'sequel', 'belated', 'third', 'entry', 'series', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Here', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Agent', 'J', 'world', 'being', 'altered', 'wiping', 'out', 'entire', 'existence', 'Agent', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'out', 'extraterrestrial', 'menace', 'broken', 'free', 'prison', 'moon', 'gone', 'back', 'time', 'terminated', 'K', 'life', 'back', '60s', 'order', 'save', 'galaxy', 'partner', 'J', 'back', 'time', 'meets', 'younger', 'K', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'brilliantly', 'mimicking', 'Jones', 'mannerisms', 'delivery', 'order', 'stop', 'vile', 'Boris', 'Terrible', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', '.The', 'first', 'two', 'Men', 'Black', 'films', 'got', 'due', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'found', 'pictures', 'be', 'hollow', 'one-joke', 'pictures', 'relied', 'too', 'heavily', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'deal', 'trouble', 'scenes', 'third', 'installment', 'production', 'had', 'be', 'shut', 'down', 'several', 'weeks', 'script', 'was', 'reworked', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'relies', 'more', 'strongly', 'characters', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'poignant', 'story', 'line', 'opposed', 'neverending', 'succession', 'wacky', 'aliens', 'make-up', 'FX', 'film', 'have', 'as', 'cliched', 'lot', 'more', 'heart', 'predecessors', 'Smith', 'seeming', 'more', 'engaged', 'Brolin', 'giving', 'lively', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'chipping', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'role', 'benign', 'Mork-like', 'alien', 'who', 'life', 'perpetually', 'analyzing', 'possible', 'future', 'outcomes.Director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'helms', 'material', 'as', 'much', 'frenetic', 'hand', 'time', 'something', 'might', 'disappoint', 'viewers', 'expecting', 'larger', 'louder', 'sequel', 'decision', 'more', 'satisfying', 'developed', 'dramatic', 'experience', 'predecessors.Sony', 'Blu-Ray', 'offerings', 'include', 'good', 'looking', '2D', 'presentation', 'film', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'transfer', 'DTS', 'MA', 'audio', 'as', 'well', 'fairly', 'effective', '3D', 'rendering', 'decent', 'depth-of-field', 'effects', 'Extras', 'include', 'Ultraviolet', 'copy', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'light', 'supplements', 'taking', 'viewers', 'scenes', 'roughly', 'hour', 'content', '2D', 'BD', 'couple', 'brief', 'extras', 'exclusive', '3D', 'BD', 'including', 'very', 'short', 'look', 'conversion', 'process']",Men in Black 3

But that's the point of course, and that's what makes this film charming, something that was lacking in the second in the series.I have been a fan of Will Smith's for quite a while, and I believe that he's in his element in very serious roles - I actually liked ""Seven Pounds"" more than most - but he's even more in his element when he's just goofing off.  And goofing off is what he does here, while still keeping some semblance of sanity.  Tommy Lee Jones is always really good of course, but dare I say it?  He's getting a little too old I think to play some of these parts.  But the good thing is:  Mr. Jones knows it himself and seems to even embrace it.  Hey, we're all getting older, after all, and he's just doing it with more class than most of us.And this is part of the reason, I believe, for some of the plot devices in this film.  I don't believe that I'm giving anything away when I say that Josh Brolin plays a younger version of Mr. Jones, and Mr. Brolin plays that part pitch perfect.  I thought that he was very good in ""W"" but he was really, really good in ""No Country for Old Men.""  Well, he keeps up that tradition here with his mimicry of Mr. Jones.  I got quite a few laughs out of his performance, and I believe that you will as well.When it comes to thematic concerns - which aren't the reason for this film's existence, of course - it seems like the writer and director are trying to argue that it is quite possible that an infinite number of universes do exist.  Also, under some circumstances, it may be possible to ""fudge"" the current universe and coerce the outcome that you want, as long as you're willing to make some sacrifices.  It is nice when a movie does seem to have a good theme, as it helps hold the movie together for the audience.Yes, MIB is completely silly.

One of the immensely successful ones, both critically and by the public, is ""Men in Black."" And, just when we thought that the second installment was the last one, that there was no way that a third one could be done, comes the delightful ""Men in Black 3,"" a hugely entertaining, intelligent sequel, as good as its predecessors.The movie starts when a gorgeous woman goes to jail to deliver a birthday cake to Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), an extremely violent criminal, who happens to be jailed under maximum security, at a prison built on the moon.  Little did the guards know what was inside the cake: the key for Animal's escape. Once out, Boris returns to Earth for his revenge. He immediately goes to a store and buys a time-travel machine. He desperately wants to go back in time to kill the man who took his arm, this man being Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Boris succeeds, and in addition to trying to kill Agent K, the future of the planet is at risk. Agent K tells Agent J (Will Smith) that the biggest mistake he ever made was not killing Boris those days. Instead, by returning to the past, Boris was going to kill Agent K, changing this way the course of history. However, Agent J won't allow this, so he also travels to the past, to 1969, so that he can save his friend's life. Once there, he finds Agent K when he was only 26 yrs old, this time played by Josh Brolin. In addition, they will receive invaluable help from Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg).As in the previous ""Men in Black,"" the new one is also leaded with funny, extraterrestrial entities, mostly in a Chinese restaurant. Particularly hilarious was the scene in 1969, when Agent J meets Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) - also an agent --, who at one time requests Agent K's help, by yelling, ""K, I can't tell women from men!"" The Blu-ray & DVD editions also include making-of documentary, gal reel, music video by Pitbull, alien games, and more.

1472026,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIHQS,Chris Kennison,"[1, 1]","It has been fifteen years since ""Men in Black"" surprised audiences with its uniqueness and quirkiness. There were effects that you swore were from Tim Burton and a storyline that we had never seen before. The original is still a must watch kind of movie and probably will always be. Many critics have already said that ""Men in Black 3"" is better or equal to the original and some have said just the opposite. Personally, I find this one of my most difficult reviews because they are both right and both wrong.K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) have been partners for a long time and still don't know much about each other. That seems to be the overriding theme to the movie as K's past comes back to haunt him in a big way. Boris the Animals (Jermaine Clement) has been imprisoned on the moon since an event that occurred on July 18th, 1969 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Anyone who knows American history knows what happened on that date and at that location. It's an event that K has never discussed with J and it's up to the audience to decipher why.""Men in Black 3"" may have the scariest villain of the three movies. His alien traits may be too much for some youngsters. Although he is also, hands down, the most effective villain of the three movies. You feel his dangerousness and you understand why K does as well. Because Boris is such a dangerous and fearful villain, he also changes the mood of the film. That, to me, is the biggest thing to note about ""MIB3"". It is a different movie from the other two. ""MIB3"" has a more emotional feel to it. It is less chaotic and less happy-go-lucky. The humor is there, don't get me wrong, it is just less.  The movie may be less fun for some viewers, but that isn't to say that what is in its place is bad.J is forced to go back in time at one point during the movie and when he does so, he finds K at the age of 29, this time played by, not Tommy Lee Jones, but Josh Brolin. This is probably one of the most amazing aspects of the film, and it involved no CG or computer f/x.  It involved Brolin doing an impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones. Apparently, the impersonation began during the filming of ""No Country for Old Men"" and was perfected before filming ""MIB3"". It is the greatest illusion of the film. Brolin nearly backed out of the movie because he didn't think it was good enough, but the final result is outstanding.""MIB3"" is a good movie but the herky-jerky looseness of the first two films is lost and replaced with a more moody film. The emotional connection between the two agents is explored and it makes for, not worse, but a different film in the series. It has been a good summer for movies so far, possibly one of the best ever, and Spiderman, Batman, Snow White and Prometheus have yet to arrive.",4,"DIFFERENT THAN 1 & 2, but not a deal breaker",1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,2764,"['been', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Men', 'Black', 'surprised', 'audiences', 'uniqueness', 'quirkiness', 'were', 'effects', 'swore', 'were', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'storyline', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'original', 'still', 'must', 'watch', 'kind', 'movie', 'probably', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Many', 'critics', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'better', 'equal', 'original', 'have', 'said', 'just', 'opposite', 'Personally', 'find', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'reviews', 'are', 'right', 'wrong.K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'have', 'been', 'partners', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'other', 'be', 'overriding', 'theme', 'movie', 'K', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'big', 'way', 'Animals', 'Jermaine', 'Clement', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'moon', 'event', 'occurred', 'July', '18th', '1969', 'Cape', 'Canaveral', 'Florida', 'Anyone', 'who', 'American', 'history', 'what', 'happened', 'date', 'location', 'event', 'K', 'never', 'discussed', 'J', 'up', 'audience', 'decipher', 'why', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'may', 'have', 'scariest', 'villain', 'three', 'movies', 'alien', 'traits', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'youngsters', 'also', 'down', 'most', 'effective', 'villain', 'three', 'movies', 'feel', 'dangerousness', 'understand', 'why', 'K', 'as', 'well', 'Boris', 'such', 'dangerous', 'fearful', 'villain', 'also', 'mood', 'film', 'biggest', 'thing', 'note', 'MIB3', 'different', 'movie', 'other', 'two', 'MIB3', 'more', 'emotional', 'feel', 'less', 'chaotic', 'less', 'happy-go-lucky', 'humor', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'just', 'less', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'fun', 'viewers', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'place', 'bad.J', 'forced', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'when', 'so', 'K', 'age', '29', 'time', 'played', 'not', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'aspects', 'film', 'involved', 'CG', 'computer', 'f/x', 'involved', 'Brolin', 'doing', 'impersonation', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Apparently', 'impersonation', 'began', 'filming', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'was', 'perfected', 'filming', 'MIB3', 'greatest', 'illusion', 'film', 'Brolin', 'nearly', 'backed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'final', 'result', 'outstanding', 'MIB3', 'good', 'movie', 'herky-jerky', 'looseness', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'lost', 'replaced', 'more', 'moody', 'film', 'emotional', 'connection', 'two', 'agents', 'explored', 'not', 'worse', 'different', 'film', 'series', 'been', 'good', 'summer', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Snow', 'White', 'Prometheus', 'have', 'yet', 'arrive']",Men in Black 3

1472053,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIHQS,C. Sawin,"[17, 28]","The humor in Men in Black 3 feels really forced early on. Maybe it's outdated or maybe this concept has run its course, but everything fell flat with the entire theater in the first thirty minutes or so. The special effects looked off at times, too. They progressively got better, but looked kind of sketchy during the prison break sequence. If the budget for a film is $215 million, a green screen effect shouldn't be so noticeable or knock you out of the adventure because of its lackluster quality.Everything starts looking up once J takes the time jump, which is odd since it involves his character going down. Suddenly, the supporting cast becomes extremely memorable (Will Arnett as J's new partner, Emma Thompson as Agent O, Bill Hader as Andy Warhol) and the writing gets much tighter. What helps quite a bit is Josh Brolin's incredible Tommy Lee Jones impression. It's subtle yet spot-on. The drawl is there, the facial expressions (or lack thereof), and pronunciations. You can tell that Brolin put a lot of time perfecting his craft.The second half of the movie is the half they were writing on the spot. These were the lines that were being written moments before the actors said them on camera. The odd thing is this is the stronger half of the movie. Michael Stuhlbarg's Griffin character is one of the shining moments of the film. Griffin is able to see every future that could possibly happen (along with the past), but is never quite sure which future is actually going to occur until moments before it happens. His personality along with his enthusiasm has him steal the show at every turn.Rick Baker is the other highlight. He created so many aliens and creatures for this movie. Once the sequel gets going, it's visually very appealing and Rick Baker is one of the essential reasons for that. These aliens are just a wide variety of bizarre, vibrant, and hideously fascinating. Baker more than outdid himself.Despite a rough and rocky start, ""Men In Black 3"" is still decent. It's mostly due to the likes of Josh Brolin and Michael Stuhlbarg's fantastic performances along with Rick Baker's exceptionally creative creature designs, but the ending packs an emotional punch. ""Men in Black 3"" feels like the type of sequel that isn't completely necessary and doesn't really offer anything new, but is still a nice addition for fans of a beloved franchise.",3,Worth seeing for Brolin and Stuhlbarg alone.,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2372,"['humor', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'feels', 'really', 'forced', 'early', 'Maybe', 'outdated', 'maybe', 'concept', 'run', 'course', 'everything', 'fell', 'flat', 'entire', 'theater', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'special', 'effects', 'looked', 'off', 'times', 'too', 'progressively', 'got', 'better', 'looked', 'kind', 'sketchy', 'prison', 'break', 'sequence', 'budget', 'film', '215', 'million', 'green', 'screen', 'effect', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'noticeable', 'knock', 'adventure', 'lackluster', 'quality.Everything', 'starts', 'looking', 'up', 'once', 'J', 'time', 'jump', 'odd', 'character', 'going', 'down', 'Suddenly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'extremely', 'memorable', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'J', 'new', 'partner', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Agent', 'O', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'writing', 'much', 'tighter', 'What', 'quite', 'bit', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'incredible', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'impression', 'subtle', 'yet', 'spot-on', 'drawl', 'there', 'facial', 'expressions', 'lack', 'thereof', 'pronunciations', 'can', 'tell', 'Brolin', 'put', 'lot', 'time', 'perfecting', 'craft.The', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'half', 'were', 'writing', 'spot', 'were', 'lines', 'were', 'being', 'written', 'moments', 'actors', 'said', 'camera', 'odd', 'thing', 'stronger', 'half', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'Griffin', 'character', 'one', 'shining', 'moments', 'film', 'Griffin', 'able', 'see', 'future', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen', 'past', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'future', 'actually', 'going', 'occur', 'moments', 'personality', 'enthusiasm', 'steal', 'show', 'turn.Rick', 'Baker', 'other', 'highlight', 'created', 'so', 'many', 'aliens', 'creatures', 'movie', 'sequel', 'going', 'visually', 'very', 'appealing', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'one', 'essential', 'reasons', 'aliens', 'are', 'just', 'wide', 'variety', 'bizarre', 'vibrant', 'hideously', 'fascinating', 'Baker', 'more', 'outdid', 'himself.Despite', 'rough', 'rocky', 'start', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'still', 'decent', 'mostly', 'due', 'likes', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'exceptionally', 'creative', 'creature', 'designs', 'ending', 'packs', 'emotional', 'punch', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'feels', 'type', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'completely', 'necessary', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'still', 'nice', 'addition', 'fans', 'beloved', 'franchise']",Men in Black 3

MEN IN BLACK II proved that not even the genius combination of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones could save a film.  And of course there were Smith's more dramatic turns, which failed to wholly entertain (even if he had proved himself a good actor).The question you should be asking by this point in the Will Smith timeline is this: is MIB3 entertaining?  You can throw aside ""good"" automatically; if you come into this film with too high expectations, you will simply be setting yourself up for disappointment.  But can this film still entertain?Well, about as good as any film involving senseless time travel can.  Agent K disappears; for some reason, J is the only one who remembers him.  So J travels into the past, where he encounters a younger J (Josh Brolin), and the pair team up to stop a time-hopping assassin (Boris the Animal) who managed to escape from a prison on the moon.So...well, there you have it.  Smith is still in good form; he seems a little tired (and Jones seems a LOT tired), but you can't really blame them by now.  As Boris, Jamaine Clement brings some delicious overacting.  The character is poorly scripted--his dialogue is painful--but Clement clearly relishes the role.  The real ace in the hole is Josh Brolin, as the younger K: Brolin gives a dead-on impersonation of Jones, and yet manages to add his own stamp on the film.Director Barry Sonnefeld and writer Etan Cohen still know how to have a good, effects-laden time.  Is MIB3 as good as the first?  Of course not.  But it's probably better than the second, and certainly offers up a good romp for anyone who likes their action with a little humor and a dollop of zaniness.

Amith (kndy),"[2, 4]","Back in 1997, filmmaker Barry Sonnefeld (""Get Shorty"", ""Wild Wild West"", ""Pushing Daisies"", ""The Addams Family"") would directed the sci-fi film ""Men in Black"".Based on the comic book series by Lowell Cunningham, originally published by Marvel Comics, the film which was budgeted at $90 million, would become a great success earning over $589 million.The sequel ""Men in Black II"", despite poor reviews from film critics, which was budgeted at $140 million, would go on to earn $441 million in the box office and become a commercial success.And a decade later, Sonnefeld would return to direct the third film in the movie series and feature a screenplay written by Etan Cohen (""Tropic Thunder"", ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"").  And reprising their roles as Agent J (Will Smith, ""Independence Day"", ""I, robot"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"") and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones, ""No Country for Old Men"", ""The Fugitive"").The film would receive fantastic reviews from film critics and budgeted at $215 million, ""Men in Black 3&#8243; would earn over $624 million in the box office.And now ""Men in Black 3&#8243; is available on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and on DVD.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Men in Black 3&#8243; is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and in English, French, and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English - Audio Descriptive Track.  For those wanting the best picture and audio quality, I highly recommend going for the Blu-ray release of ""Men in Black 3&#8243;.  Also, it's important to note that there is also a Blu-ray 3D version of the film that will be available on release day.As for the DVD, picture quality is good as expected on DVD.  Many outdoor scenes are vibrant and colorful, skin tones are natural, black levels are very good.  And for the most part, I was quite amazed of how things looked when it came to balancing the sci-fi visual effects and also the monster/alien beings.  As for audio, good use of surround channels and LFE, but I would imagine with the lossless track on Blu-ray would sound much more immersive.  Still, for a DVD release, ""Men in Black 3&#8243; looks and sounds great on DVD!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Men in Black 3&#8243; comes with the following special features:Partners in Time: The Making of MIB 3 - (26:24) Featuring interviews with the cast and crew about their experience working on ""Men in Black 3&#8243;.Gag-Reel - (3:54) Bloopers from ""Men in Black 3&#8243;.""Back in Time"" Music Video  - (3:34)Note: The Blu-ray release of ""Men in Black 3&#8243; has more special features than the DVD release.EXTRAS:""Men in Black 3&#8243; comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the film to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:The best ""Men in Black"" film!I have to admit that after ""Men in Black 2&#8243;, which left me incredibly disappointed, I didn't know if I wanted to watch this film.  And even actor Will Smith had reservations of working with filmmaker Barry Sonnefeld again, but Sonnefeld was persistent that he had something special with the third film.And while on paper, the whole time-travel storyline may seem too banal for audiences, the way it was handled and its big surprise at the end of the film, made me a believer and a fan of the ""Men in Black"" series once again.""Men in Black 3&#8243; works, thanks to the ongoing chemistry of these unlikely partners, Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) but despite how dry Agent K is and quiet around his curious partner, the two have made a great duo in taking on these high level alien cases.But when it comes to his private and personal life, it's one thing that Agent K doesn't want to get into.  And being the curious partner, Agent J wants to know why his partner acts the way he does.  And it peaks his interest even more when he meets a younger Agent K (Josh Brolin).  The performance by Josh Brolin was fantastic!  His performance made you feel like he is Agent K, but much looser and is able to communicate much more.  And makes J wonder, what happened in 1969 that changed Agent K's life forever?And while the film is pretty much a cat and mouse game of trying to prevent Agent K's death and trying to save the world, the visual effects were well-done, the balance of both sci-fi elements, the costume design and the vehicles found in order to make 1969 look believable and its storyline was effective and it helps to have veteran talent involved in the film and knowing how to deliver with their overall performance.The film looks incredible and while I am reviewing the DVD edition, while the DVD looks very good and sounds very good, there is no doubt in my mind that a film like this would look even more incredible on Blu-ray and also sound much better via lossless.  Also, the Blu-ray release has more special features than this DVD release as well.  So, I really recommend going for the Blu-ray release of ""Men in Black 3&#8243; or the 3D version if you have the hardware capable of watching films in 3D.Overall, ""Men in Black 3&#8243; was a surprise.  Not only was it an awesome film but it literally made me forget how bad the second film was.  ""Men in Black 3&#8243; featured great performances, great visual effects, costume design and more of everything.  But most importantly, it's the story that captivates you.  Especially with an ending that you never saw coming... I really enjoyed this film a lot!""Men in Black 3&#8243; is the best film in the trilogy!

I saw it with my 15 year old daughter and my husband, all of us with different tastes in movies and all of us in love with this film. We all loved the first two, with differing favorites, but this one is quite unique.I am not the kind that reviews a plot, you can find that on [...], I think a review should be the writer's opinion of what they saw, not a synopsis.The first MIB was a new, unique type of film, with original characters and excellent chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones...who'da thunk it?It was a huge success for many reasons and therefore made a lot of money, so they made MIBII. This movie was good as well, more of the same, for those of us who didn't get enough of the first film.So frankly, when MIBIII was announced I was a bit Leary, thinking ""how can they do this again without it being stale""? Well let me tell you they not only gave us the duo we love, but even better versions of them and of the franchise (Both young and old ""K"", young ""K"" being an almost miraculous performance by Josh Brolin). We have a plot that is worthy of the MIB series, but with a twist at the end that is breathtaking and highly emotional, something you would not expect from an MIB movie. This, to me, elevated the entire series a few notches. Another pleasant surprise was the humor, which is more prevalent, relevant, and intelligent. It felt like each actor was giving his/her best in this film, not that the others were bad, but there is very little ""camp"" in this film, yet the irreverence and humor are still there.My family, of 3 conflicting tastes, sat staring at a 17 inch computer screen for an entire movie and were enthralled, and afterwards all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time.Buy this movie, DVD, Blu-Ray, or amazon on demand, it doesn't matter but you need to own this film.

That's partially due to a crushing lack of Tommy Lee Jones, who's relegated to a mere cameo appearance, but more thoroughly to a lack of conviction and casual, happenstance tone. It's okay for a comedy to be this thoroughly jokey and loose, but the formula that worked for this franchise in the past was a tight balance of those lighter moments with sharp, dramatic action sets. MIB3 may go through those motions, but the emotional punch that its predecessor had delivered so easily is almost completely absent here. Though the vast majority of the film is set in the free love sixties, the atmosphere also remains very modern, like attending a themed costume party where the host didn't get the memo. Excepting a few very easy sight gags and the eyeball-rolling location of the film's grand climax, this just doesn't seem to make much effort to ground itself in that era. Josh Brolin works an uncanny Jones impression during these scenes, but that act falls strangely flat when the real deal himself was on-screen only moments before, and in this case there's really no substitute for the real thing.

1472135,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAIHQS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","MEN IN BLACK 3 (Dir. Barry Sonnenfeld, Writ. Etan Cohen, Prod. Steven Spielberg, 2012, 109 minutes) is one of the best movies I have seen. That's right: one of the very best. As if it weren't enough that these folks got their game on again after a miserable sequel, this is one of the finest and deepest time travel films in history. I pride myself on being a time travel aficionado, and time travel films just happen to be a corollary hobby for me.Therefore I will not spoil this beyond a basic outline, for all those who haven't seen it yet: J travels back in time (to 1969, a day before the Moon Launch) to save then-29-year-old K (a stunning as usual Josh Brolin, and by the way, this makes Tommy Lee Jones' K age 72 in the present which is stunning since Brolin is really only 21 years younger than Jones). I recall Roger Ebert said Brolin did a sort of uncanny impersonation of Jones. Brolin didn't impersonate him: he BECAME Tommy Lee Jones as a young man. Brolin is a miracle-worker, even breathing between his words like Jones does.If I may, this involves the spectacular net around earth that protects us, the replacement of Zed by Agent O as the director (an incredibly hilarious Emma Thompson), and a few bits of insane fun set in 1969. As an example, in 1969 someone refers to UFO fanatics/aliens as ""the Roswell Circuit"". This film will travel at the speed of light too, and that is always the hallmark of a spectacular film. This surpasses the original film, in my estimation.I have to say the most stunning thing about this film is the time travel component. The way K travels back in time is the most intelligent, humorous and ""realistic"" time travel concept ever devised. I will guarantee you one more thing: the ending will draw a tear. If it did that to me, I guarantee it will happen to you. It must be Etan Cohen's script.This film is stand-alone and could actually be enjoyed without enjoying the original film (why would you want to do that?) and certainly without the seeing sequel (why would anyone want to do that?) - this is going to make everyone want a third sequel. I want to see more of Emma Thompson filling the black shoes of Rip Torn.With the additional extraterrestrial talents of Lady Gaga, Tim Burton, Bill Gates, Yao Ming and David Beckham.Anachronisms/goofs (as far as I'm concerned just makes it all more fun):1. J shows his father's pocket watch, apparently always on his person. This plays a vital role in the film. However, in the original film, a persons' existence was erased after acceptance into the MIB - meaning all their things are confiscated - so J would not have had such a thing.2. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in an earlier film, Tommy Lee Jones is shown as a young civilian  man who stumbled onto an alien-human meeting either during or some time after 1969. If I am wrong and that occurred before 1969, these writers are better than I thought!3. While some people might have referred to ""Cape Canaveral"" at the time, it was actually rechristened ""Cape Kennedy"" in honor of the president in 1962, which name it kept until the early 1970s.4. There is a location where the agents meet Andy Warhol and I'm pretty certain that location was abandoned by 1969.5. Lots of flags and technology anachronisms which I will leave for you to notice - but I'll spoil one by advising you watch for the present flag of New Guinea appearing in 1969.6.

1472145,A10JDPEQ8GJ2K1,B005LAIHQS,Erik Bateson,"[9, 15]","Having just re-watched the original Men in Black mere hours before, I was really excited to see Men in Black III. Sure, some of the special effects in the original were cheesy, and some of the humor was dated (it's been a while since I've heard a joke about Dennis Rodman), but the film remained very enjoyable. I thought the new film would fall short of the original, while still improving on the abysmal Men in Black II, and for the most part, I was right.I really like Tommy Lee Jones, but he mostly looks bored and tired here. Emma Thompson cashes a paycheck here as the new Chief. She has one completely excruciating moment doing a vocal impression of an alien; it was meant to be funny, but like so many jokes in the film, it was more cringe-worthy. I saw it at the midnight screening, and laughter was very scarce. The screenplay by Etan Coen (not to be confused with Ethan Coen of the Coen Brothers) featuring uncredited work by David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson (who worked together on the unbelievably bad Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) is so aggressively mediocre, so barely passable that even the strong cast never really elevates it. If were a producer on this film, I would have demanded a rewrite. It's hard to make a strong film without a strong script, and this film proves it.Here's the good news: Will Smith is as likeable and charming as ever. There are better actors than him, but few with a more intensely likeable and charismatic on-screen presence. The real treat here, however, is Josh Brolin, playing a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. This is not an easy task: he is not just asked to play a stiff and mechanical character, he is asked to play a younger Tommy Lee Jones playing a stiff and mechanical character. It would have been very hard to be merely adequate at this role, and yet he exceeds beyond all expectations. He is in the film a great deal more than Tommy Lee Jones (Jones actually has a fairly supporting role in this film, as the time travel stuff back to the `60s makes up the bulk of the film, with Jones' few scenes bookending the film), and once the magic of seeing Agent K just as stiff in a newly liberated and psychedelic culture wears off, and once seeing the magic of John Brolin doing Tommy Lee Jones wears off, there is substance here; he delivers a very, very strong performance, the unquestionable highlight of the film.So what exactly is the film about? Boris the Animal (played by an unrecognizable Jermaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords), an intergalactic criminal, breaks out of prison with one mission and one mission only: to kill agent K (Jones) who arrested him in the late `60s (and also took away his left arm). Basically, it's all an excuse for Will Smith to go back to the `60s, have some fun time traveling experiences, save Agent K (now Brolin) from Boris, and have a really happening time. I expected the portrayal of the late `60s to be completely stale, but most of it actually works quite well. Bill Hader of Saturday Night Live has a cameo as Andy Warhol, and it's both a good impression of Warhol and a hilarious performance.But even when Men in Black III works, it never feels particularly important; there's no real reason for this film to exist. I'm not saying every film has to have some important social commentary or anything, but some version of this film has been done before and much better (cough Back to the Future cough). If you liked the first film, you'll probably enjoy this, but you can wait to rent it.",3,"Better than the second, weaker than the first",1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,3519,"['Having', 'just', 're-watched', 'original', 'Men', 'Black', 'mere', 'hours', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'Men', 'Black', 'III', 'Sure', 'special', 'effects', 'original', 'were', 'cheesy', 'humor', 'was', 'dated', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'joke', 'Dennis', 'Rodman', 'film', 'remained', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'thought', 'new', 'film', 'would', 'fall', 'short', 'original', 'still', 'improving', 'abysmal', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'right.I', 'really', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'mostly', 'bored', 'tired', 'here', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'paycheck', 'here', 'new', 'Chief', 'one', 'completely', 'excruciating', 'moment', 'doing', 'vocal', 'impression', 'alien', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'cringe-worthy', 'saw', 'midnight', 'screening', 'laughter', 'was', 'very', 'scarce', 'screenplay', 'Etan', 'Coen', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'featuring', 'uncredited', 'work', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Jeff', 'Nathanson', 'who', 'worked', 'together', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'so', 'aggressively', 'mediocre', 'so', 'barely', 'passable', 'even', 'strong', 'cast', 'never', 'really', 'were', 'producer', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'demanded', 'rewrite', 'hard', 'make', 'strong', 'film', 'strong', 'script', 'film', 'good', 'news', 'Will', 'Smith', 'likeable', 'charming', 'ever', 'are', 'better', 'actors', 'few', 'more', 'intensely', 'likeable', 'charismatic', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'real', 'treat', 'here', 'however', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'playing', 'younger', 'version', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'not', 'just', 'asked', 'play', 'stiff', 'mechanical', 'character', 'asked', 'play', 'younger', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'playing', 'stiff', 'mechanical', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'merely', 'adequate', 'role', 'yet', 'expectations', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Jones', 'actually', 'fairly', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'time', 'travel', 'stuff', 'back', '60s', 'up', 'bulk', 'film', 'Jones', 'few', 'scenes', 'bookending', 'film', 'once', 'magic', 'seeing', 'Agent', 'K', 'just', 'stiff', 'newly', 'liberated', 'psychedelic', 'culture', 'once', 'seeing', 'magic', 'John', 'Brolin', 'doing', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'off', 'substance', 'here', 'very', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'unquestionable', 'highlight', 'film.So', 'what', 'exactly', 'film', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'played', 'unrecognizable', 'Jermaine', 'Clement', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'intergalactic', 'criminal', 'prison', 'one', 'mission', 'one', 'mission', 'only', 'kill', 'agent', 'K', 'Jones', 'who', 'arrested', 'late', '60s', 'also', 'took', 'away', 'left', 'arm', 'Basically', 'excuse', 'Will', 'Smith', 'go', 'back', '60s', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'traveling', 'experiences', 'save', 'Agent', 'K', 'now', 'Brolin', 'Boris', 'have', 'really', 'happening', 'time', 'expected', 'portrayal', 'late', '60s', 'be', 'completely', 'stale', 'most', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'cameo', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'good', 'impression', 'Warhol', 'hilarious', 'performance.But', 'even', 'when', 'Men', 'Black', 'III', 'never', 'particularly', 'important', 'real', 'reason', 'film', 'exist', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'have', 'important', 'social', 'commentary', 'anything', 'version', 'film', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'cough', 'Back', 'Future', 'cough', 'liked', 'first', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'can', 'wait', 'rent']",Men in Black 3

When I began watching it, the signature, goofy presentation seemed as though it had not aged well since the long past days of the original MIB, and the time traveling plot looked as though it was a disaster of corniness waiting to happen. Fortunately, I suspended judgment, and continued watching MIB3, and I was pleasantly surprised that it became an engaging, heartfelt, fun romp through some of the weirder and wilder corners of science fiction.I particularly enjoyed the use of the moon launch as the central plot point in this movie, and I felt that this significant moment in human history was implemented brilliantly. The exploration of J and K's relationship was surprisingly moving and well done, with a performance by Josh Brolin that steals Smith's not-inconsiderable thunder at times. The two of them work together quite well, but this should come as no surprise, given their talents and professionalism. The creation of ""Boris the Animal"" was a great accomplishment for the creature team of this movie, and he stands out as a truly interesting (and a bit scary!) villain.Finally, I was pleased to see the criminally underused Will Arnett and Bill Hayder receive some face time in MIB3...

1472185,A20ENXS6R1N2L8,B005LAIHQS,Harold,"[0, 0]","A fitting sequel and end (?) to the series. The original MIB was a shock to the general system. It was unique in its humor and approach for a major film. It was both silly and intelligent, bawdy and full of heart. And then they made the sequel... which shall go unmentioned. I wouldn't have thought they could return to these characters and this world either believably nor in a way that would be interesting. I was glad to be proved wrong and I would watch it again.14 years after the last movie, we pick up J and K with a new nemesis and, of course, high stakes. But this story is highly personal without ever becoming overly sweet or maudlin. It's still a buddy cop story, but it isn't about J's learning the ropes or a simple standard fate-of-the-world scenario, it is about their lack of communication--like most long term relationships.It is a clever story with some good CGI and, despite being filmed for 3D, there isn't an over-reliance on that medium in the filming. It works perfectly fine in 2D. It isn't quite as snappy as the first movie in its humor, but it is comfortable and fun. And the retro look of the HQ and the design, in general, was really well executed.The most impressive aspect, frankly, was Brolin's performance as the younger K. You will swear they CG'd Jones to simply look younger. It is one of the more remarkable pieces of casting and performances where an actor has to become another actor's younger self. Much like Looper, it was done subtly. But honestly, it was also done much better in Brolin's case. They lucked out with both the physicality and the voice match for sure, but he is also a gifted mimic.MIB3 is a reminder that sequels can be done right if given time and commitment and when they're not just created to cash in on the fervor (can you say Iron Man 2?). Here's also hoping they know when to walk away. Smith and Jones are not replaceable and the story has really run its course in a satisfying way.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 6]","Will Smith's sun has dimmed in recent years, and it doesn't help that we haven't seen an M.I.B. film in a decade, so the buzz on the franchise has waned some. Still, I got mad love for the Men in Black and wasn't about to pass up on this third installment. And, it turns out, my faith is redeemed... but with a caveat or three. The franchise still has legs, but now you can spot them varicose veins.It's not the worst thing in the world if the script isn't finished even though the film is already shooting. CASABLANCA, for one, famously managed to steer itself straight even though the writers were still scrambling days into the final shoot. But if you've just seen MEN IN BLACK 3 and you're nursing this sense of disconnect and discontent, then, yes, do blame the screwy script. For one thing, Tommy Lee Jones, who only had several weeks to shoot his scenes in the can, probably remained clueless as to how the plot ultimately unwinds. Place his lackluster performance - and the fact that he seemed so unengaged - on that doorstep. When all's said and done, Tommy Lee Jones' minimal appearance essentially amounts to a glorified guest spot.Agent J (Smith) wakes up one morning to rewritten history and to an alarming new obsession with chocolate milk. He discovers that his partner K (Jones) had ceased to exist in the present day, that K, forty years ago, was fatally gunned down by Boris the Animal, a world conqueror who is the last of his malevolent race. To reset the timeline, J promptly time travels to 1969, and so we're treated to a terrific time jump sequence. And even though it's only peripherally relevant to what actually goes down in the the narrative, J is also trying to prevent a massive alien invasion. Although, by now, chances are that residents of the Big Apple merely roll their eyes at yet another hostile alien armada menacing their cityscape.On July 15, 1969 - the day before the historic Apollo moon launch - J meets a decades more youthful K (Josh Brolin), and by ""meets"" I, of course, mean ""is arrested by."" K doubts J's M.I.B. credentials, but then credit J's convincing gift for gab. It prevents his exposure to 1969's humongous version of the neurolizer. Off they go then on a hunt for Boris the Animal, with J stealing fascinated glances at his new/old partner. At this stage, K is 29 years old, although he still exhibits that weathered look, still craggy-faced, still laconic and impassive. ""You got some city miles on you,"" remarks J. Like you, I'm mouthing the line along with Will Smith, because I saw the trailer.General concensus suggests that MEN IN BLACK 3 does improve on the sequel but pales under comparison to the original. From there on, opinions vary. Some call MEN IN BLACK 3 a return to form. Some can't get past the flaws. Me, I lean towards favoring it more so than not, but there are issues.It's a bit of a shock to learn it's been four years since Will Smith was in a feature film. It's gratifying that he can still channel the cool Fresh Prince persona. His past four pictures had restricted him to more somber roles. But Smith still has that old magic. He simply oozes charm. But he doesn't own this movie.Josh Brolin owns this movie. His impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones' terse Texas drawl is freakin' uncanny. He captures Jones' delivery perfectly, and his demeanor. Brolin develops a more fun-loving side to K. Another character I enjoyed is Griffin the alien clairvoyant (Michael Stuhlbarg, bringing a puppy-like charm). Griffin has a knack for glimpsing multiple futures, and he has good moments in which he fusses and tries to determine which version of the future is currently  unfolding. Thankfully, the film doesn't overdo these bits.The plot and premise are tantalizing enough that it's all the more of a gut punch when bits of the movie fail to come together. There were moments in which I was bored. Emma Thompson steps in as the new M.I.B. director, Agent O, with Alice Eve playing her younger counterpart in 1969. There's a romance that is early on implied between Agents O and K, except that both Thompson and Eve end up mostly sidelined, and so that plot thread really never does get picked at. And I miss Zed. Sucks that Rip Torn was having so much legal trouble, he had to be written out of the story.The stuff I liked? I got a kick out of the ""Andy Warhol"" scene. And I thought they did a fantastic job of visualizing the 1969 setting. I liked that they didn't shy away from addressing the existing racism of that era. It's a bit of an irony that, in 1969, when those cops get their profiling on and pull J over, that J actually did just boost his ride. It's a really fun sequence. So, yeah, the scenes that they get right, they get amazingly right. Ultimately, though, the payoff isn't there. One ongoing beat has J time and again harping on what made K into such a closed off, hardened soul. This is answered in the climax, during a big reveal. But it's a reveal that comes out of left field and feels so forced. It sours the film that much more for me. And I still can't wrap my head around that stunt J pulls in Cape Canaveral while wrestling with the big bad.I still recommend MEN IN BLACK 3, strained though it is. I'm still liking the M.I.B. universe, and how strange it is and the level of imagination that goes into constructing it. Will Smith creates a nice chemistry with Brolin, and it's nice to see Smith back to being the fun-having Will Smith, instead of the morose Academy Award Will Smith. We still get those scenes in which the most fun lies in checking out the cool background details, because Sonnenfeld and his creative team reward us with those outlandish little sight gags. Clunky futuristic jet packs, sweet gyrobikes, graffiti aliens, a slightly more lighthearted K... Even after fourteen years on the job and now a Class 1 Senior Agent, J still hasn't seen it all. And neither have we. I'm banking on a third sequel. Here come the MEN IN BLACK 4.

1472204,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005LAIHQS,I'm Right,"[0, 0]","I grew up with Men in Black, the first one was pretty original and just a fun time overall before Will Smith got old and predictable, while the second one also helped me grow up with learning about bitter disappointment, so almost ten years later another Men in Black would be interesting, and while I think most people forgot about this series until the third one was announced, the time did it well to give the writers time to make another one. Well here it is, Men in Black 3, and I'd say it's as good as the first one but it doesn't have the advantage of being the first one so it doesn't feel as fresh and original as the first one, oh well.In this one a convict that Agent K put away has gotten a hold of a time machine (more of a device actually) and goes back in time to kill K before he stops the guy, and J (Will Smith) goes back to the shagadelic 60's to stop him from killing K. When I first heard about this it seemed like a ploy so Tommy Lee Jones wouldn't have to get his old cranky ass onto the movie set every day, but he's still in the movie enough for it to work and game enough to do an action scene, go Tommy. So while the plot's a pretty cool new way to show MIB the back in time thing kind of reminded me of the 2nd one where they had to take stuff from the past for the plot, this one fully devotes to the past.So what's good about MIB taking place in the past, well there's an abundance of alien jokes to make about the 60's and they hit a few good ones but not enough to make it a flat out comedy (like they did with the 2nd), the villain in the 60's had a Dustin Hoffman Easy Rider-era vibe to him, the racism card was played in perfect doses, and the Andy Warhol bit was a golden oppurtunity they hit perfectly. Other great moments were seeing the gadgets the MIB used in the 60's, especially the giant neurolizer tube got a chuckle out of me.If there was a disappointing aspect about MIB 3 though I'd say it was the action, it felt kinda forced at times and I didn't really feel any tension or anything, even when they're like 100ft in the air the tension was just gone, and in the opening at the Asian restuarant it felt like they had to show J shoot a few bad aliens, maybe as a little reminder to the audience that yes, this is in fact a MIB film. But in true MIB style they kept the action light with jokes peppered in, so really it was no big thing chicken wing.Josh Brolin was great as a young K, he brought a whole new aspect to the character, showing him a little (very little) less serious and enjoyed his job with a rat-pack vibe to him. He was entertaining enough to carry the movie but not enough to outshine Tommy Lee Jones.Probably my favorite aspect about MIB 3 though was the new villain, he was x1000 times better than 'tentacle rape woman' or whatever from the second one, and just about as creepy as the cockroach in human skin in the first one. In the opening scene (before the Asian restuarant shoot out) he breaks out of prison, all the while delivering gloriously cheesy and over the top one-liners, and his name was Boris! He was straight out of the 60's batman show, they could've had him more in the movie but that might've taken away his charm.Anyways what else is there really to say about MIB 3? It was a fun time at the movies, delivered the goods and the aliens were unique and interesting, the story was good and had a small emotional punch at the end, and it was a hell of a lot better than the 2nd one.

Will Smith (Agent J)and Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) reunite at the sparring duo trying to keep order in the world with our secret resident aliens.I haven't seen the previous MEN IN BLACK films for years but I thought MIB III lack the energy and sparkle of the first two. Tommy Lee Jones seemed tired and maybe that is why they went back in time to have Josh Brolin play a young Agent K. Of course, there was humor in having a middle-aged Josh Brolin say he was 29. Those Men in Black agents don't seem to age well.It is fun to have step back in time to 1969 with all the funky hair and costumes. Hey, who knew Andy Warhol had actually been an agent back then? Funny touch. The film seems to drag on a bit and there just isn't the enthusiasm as in the previous films. Back in 1969 we see that Agent K had a passionate desire for Agent O (Emma Thompson as adult O and Alice Eve and 1969 O) Brolin does a great job of capturing the mannerisms and speech patterns of the older Agent K but the young and older Agent O have no resemblance to each other except for a British accent.Jermaine Clement is delightful and unnerving as the evil Boris the Animal who sets the travel back into time in motion. Boris ""Don't Call me Animal"" is pure evil and he may be the one to destroy Agent K and alter the course of history.There is a very special element to MIB III that finally comes to light near the end of the movie.

1472214,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B005LAIHQS,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[6, 10]","After the disastrous MIB2, the third and hopefully final film in the franchise is more in the mold of the first but lacks the playful charm and wit and descends into weak one-liners and silliness. By throwing time travel into the film, the screenwriters could essentially stitch together a group of disparate scenes hastily scratched on the back of napkin and then excuse themselves by moving around the time line. Somebody send in a Terminator, please. Prediction: the next MIB will happen on another planet since that's the only really obvious thing they haven't done yet and Will Smith can crack some incredibly predictable jokes.Okay, the plot focuses on a bad guy that K formerly imprisoned escaping from moon-based incarceration using a cake (yeah, really) and somehow getting back to earth. Figuring the simplest way for vengeance, he decides to go back in time despite the fact that he kills people in the current time incredibly easily. There's the Chrysler building, 1960s, blah blah blah, and what seems several hours later something to do with Neil Armstrong (RIP). There's a huge sentimental twist in the ending that might have made me cry but I used up all my tears from boredom.Tommy Lee Jones genuinely looks too old for the role now and Josh Brolin is truly uncanny as the younger K, pulling off the perfect impersonation of Tommy Lee 3,4,5 or however many decades ago. That's undoubtedly the best performance of the film. Will Smith's wisecracking doesn't do much for me the third time around and Emma Thompson is frankly wasted. The franchise insists on casting pop-culture minor celebrities so we're offered up Jemaine Clement as the bad guy which is only marginally better than Johnny Knoxville from the second film.The CG is pretty awful for most part with some badly lit green-screening and cartoonish animations that completely kill any of the potential tension in the scenes.

It was not as fresh as the first or second one but I love the characters and the premise of the movie that we are living among aliens of many races.  This one is interesting as a particularly evil and mean alien escapes from a prison on the moon and his goal is to get back at Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) for imprisoning him and cutting off his arm.Agent J (Will Smith) has to go back into time to save K or the whole earth may be lost.  The movie is entertaining and Josh Brolin does an excellent job of portraying the young Agent K in the past.  He and Will Smith made the movie.  Of course the special effects and the aliens were just out of this world and it was fun to watch the interaction between Will Smith and the two actors who played the younger and older Agent K.  There were lots of funny one liners and a lot of action to keep you interested.My wife and I rated this movie a 4 star ranking.  It is well worth seeing and you will enjoy it.  It is not a five star movie as it just doesn't seem as fresh and original as the first Men In Black movie.  It is the third sequel after all and some of the items are getting repetitive.  We both enjoyed Josh Brolin playing the younger agent K and perhaps if another sequel comes out he can become a full time replacement for Tommy Lee Jones who is starting to show his age.Rent it or download it because it is worth seeing once and you will have a few good laughs.

1472264,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005LAIHQS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 3]","I did not have high hopes for Men in Black 3. The first film was a staple of my childhood, but its 2002 sequel was a major disappointment that's best forgotten. While my initial expectations were optimistic, I grew cynical when I heard that filming had commenced without a completed script. Ten years removed from the previous installment, it seemed like this film was a way of cashing in on an established brand...Like Will Smith really needs the money. Well, color me surprised. This third film in the franchise not only stands shoulder to shoulder with the first, but it boasts an entertaining and well-plotted script. Considering the troubled production, Men in Black 3 is some kind of miracle.The film opens at LunarMax Prison, a high-security facility located on the moon. Housed there is Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), the last surviving member of an extinct alien race, who escapes with the intention of going back in time to kill Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) before K is able to shoot off Boris' arm and capture him. After K learns of Boris' escape, all traces of him disappear and Boris launches a large-scale attack on Earth. With Agent J (Smith) being the only one with any recollection of K, he must time-jump back to 1969 to save him and all of humanity. J is warned to specifically avoid K and to come back to the present after he's killed the present-day Boris. Following a clue to Coney Island, J is apprehended by the young Agent K (Josh Brolin). Explaining the situation, K reluctantly believes him and the two find themselves working together to stop the present and past Boris from carrying out his plan.Time travel is a tricky subject in any medium. There are a lot of kinks that must be worked out to create a cohesive and consistent narrative. Are there plot holes in Men in Black 3? Certainly. But it's not a movie that lends itself to in-depth analysis of its plot structure. The time travel stuff is handled remarkably well (excuses can be found for many of the discrepancies) and it's so clever and paced so well that any plot holes can be easily overlooked. Etan Cohen's script has creative ideas, a great sense of humor, well-developed (although kitschy) moments of drama, and a tongue-in-cheek self-awareness. While the second film proved a good script is a necessity, the magic of this franchise and the secret to its charm and longevity are rooted in the confident direction of Barry Sonnenfeld, the chemistry between the principal actors, and the wonderfully creative designs of the aliens that populate the story.Those in charge of designing the aliens for this movie have reached deep into their well of creativity here. Whether it's the main antagonist or the background characters; there's a lot to admire here. Even better, there's more subtlety than the previous installment and the aliens here are fascinating without having to try as hard as the second film's Balchinian.While Jones doesn't have much screen time, he and Smith still have great chemistry. They're certainly an odd pairing, but it's hard not to smile during their charismatic and witty banter. Smith has his share of hilarious moments and reminds you why (even after a 3 year absence from acting) he's one of the biggest actors in the world. Josh Brolin has been earning rave reviews for his role as Young Agent K and this praise is more than deserved as does something totally unheard of. It would've been easy for the filmmakers to throw Tommy Lee Jones in some prosthetics or cast someone completely unlike him. Instead, they cast Brolin and he's extraordinary. He manages to not only look exactly how one would imagine a young Tommy Lee Jones, but he physically embodies him perfectly and he sounds exactly like him. This is one of the few times I can recall being convinced that I'm watching the younger version of a character and not just a different actor playing the younger version. Even more remarkable is that Brolin isn't just doing a really good Tommy Lee Jones impression; he actually brings depth out of the character in a way that wonderfully complements Jones' performance. Many have said you should see the movie just for Brolin's performance. I'm in the camp that will point to other reasons, but for a role that could've been a novelty act; he's truly impressive.Sonnenfeld began as a cinematographer, transitioned into directing with The Addams Family in 1991 and has been a hit-or-miss filmmaker ever since. He deserves a wealth of praise for undertaking this massive project without a script or proper preparation and delivering a worthy sequel and an entertaining summer blockbuster. It was a gamble, which makes this accomplishment all the more remarkable.I had so much fun watching Men in Black 3 that I can find very little to criticize. Boris, while much better than Lara Flynn Boyle's villain, can be annoying at times. He's a revolting, effective villain but here personal taste collides with objective criticism. It doesn't help that has some of the most ham-fisted dialogue in the film. Aside from this, Men in Black 3 is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's terrific entertainment and one of those rare moments where a sequel actually rivals the original film. More importantly, Men in Black 3 is a successful reparation for the abominable sequel ten years ago. I actually vote they remove the second film from the canon and re-title this film Men in Black 2. While it's been overshadowed a bit this summer season, Men in Black 3 is the most entertaining film I've seen this year and, if you're a fan of the series, you won't want to miss it.",5,One of the

1472270,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005LAIHQS,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Almost a decade after the last film, Men In Black 3 hit the big screen in May of this year. It was a movie I was excited about, but one that I missed when it was in theaters. Well I watched it last night and I must say this is definitely deserving of the MIB title.Because there was such a huge gap between films I was a little worried at how this entry would turn out, and as the movie started some of those worries came to life. The worst thing about M.I.B. 3 is that it starts off slow and in the middle it can get a little slow. That and the main villain Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) isn't really anything to brag about. I found his character to be pretty boring and, for me, Clement overacted the part. He tried too hard to make him feel intimidating but in the end it was just annoying.What this movie does well is have an amazing story, interesting characters, and some great acting, aside from Clement. At times the story can feel like it's going all over the place, but once you reach the end the writers did a phenomenal job at tying everything together. Which leaves us with probably the deepest story we've seen from this series. Also, it gives us a little insight on just how far K and J go back.I want to give major props to Josh Brolin who played Young Agent K. This man... just wow! He did a fantastic job at replicating Tommy Lee Jones' facial expressions, tone of voice, everything. I wasn't expecting to love his performance because from the trailers I wasn't sure how I was going to like the idea of a Young K, but they chose the perfect man for the job. Which leads me to my next comment. This isn't really a complaint as much as it is an observation, but Tommy Lee Jones looks terrible. The man is not aging well and it shows. It made me kind of sad when I was watching this because I love TLJ, but I'll get off that before this becomes depressing.Finally, Will Smith's performance was fatastic. He may make some iffy decisions regarding roles in other films, but he never fails to come through with this series. He's funny, he's interesting, he has a lot of energy, and he hasn't lost his step as J. That was one of the most important things, for me, regarding this film. I wanted Smith to still feel like J. One question though: Will, where's your song on the soundtrack? I was really looking forward to another M.I.B. song from Will, but sadly there was none.Overall Score: 8/10 - In short, this film is a joy to watch. If you're a fan of this series then I would definitely recommend watching this. If you're a fan of sci-fi films then I would recommend watching this. Lastly, if you're looking for an entertaining movie then, you guessed it, watch this. It may get a little slow at times, and the main villain can be a little boring, but in the end it's still an enjoyable experience.Last minute edit: I wanted to give credit to Michael Stuhlbarg who played Griffin in this, but I forgot. I'll just say that Michael did a fantastic job and Griffin's character was amazing. He probably wound up becoming my new favorite character in this series even though there's a good possibility we won't see him in any future films.",4,8/10 - Good,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,3202,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Almost', 'decade', 'last', 'film', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'May', 'year', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'one', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'Well', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'definitely', 'deserving', 'MIB', 'title.Because', 'was', 'such', 'huge', 'gap', 'films', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'how', 'entry', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'movie', 'started', 'worries', 'came', 'life', 'worst', 'thing', 'M.I.B', '3', 'slow', 'middle', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'slow', 'main', 'villain', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'brag', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'pretty', 'boring', 'Clement', 'overacted', 'part', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'feel', 'intimidating', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'annoying.What', 'movie', 'well', 'have', 'amazing', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'aside', 'Clement', 'times', 'story', 'can', 'feel', 'going', 'place', 'once', 'reach', 'end', 'writers', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'tying', 'everything', 'together', 'Which', 'probably', 'deepest', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'Also', 'little', 'insight', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'K', 'J', 'go', 'back.I', 'want', 'give', 'major', 'props', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'played', 'Young', 'Agent', 'K.', 'man', 'just', 'wow', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'replicating', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'facial', 'expressions', 'tone', 'voice', 'everything', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'love', 'performance', 'trailers', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'idea', 'Young', 'K', 'chose', 'perfect', 'man', 'job', 'Which', 'next', 'comment', ""n't"", 'really', 'complaint', 'as', 'much', 'observation', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'terrible', 'man', 'not', 'aging', 'well', 'made', 'kind', 'sad', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'love', 'TLJ', ""'ll"", 'get', 'off', 'depressing.Finally', 'Will', 'Smith', 'performance', 'was', 'fatastic', 'may', 'make', 'iffy', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'roles', 'other', 'films', 'never', 'come', 'series', 'funny', 'interesting', 'lot', 'energy', ""n't"", 'lost', 'step', 'J', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'regarding', 'film', 'wanted', 'Smith', 'still', 'feel', 'J', 'One', 'question', 'Will', 'where', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'M.I.B', 'song', 'Will', 'sadly', 'was', 'Score', '8/10', 'short', 'film', 'joy', 'watch', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'then', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watching', ""'re"", 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Lastly', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'then', 'guessed', 'watch', 'may', 'get', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'main', 'villain', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'boring', 'end', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'experience.Last', 'minute', 'edit', 'wanted', 'give', 'credit', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'who', 'played', 'Griffin', 'forgot', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'Michael', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Griffin', 'character', 'was', 'amazing', 'probably', 'wound', 'up', 'becoming', 'new', 'favorite', 'character', 'series', 'even', 'good', 'possibility', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'future', 'films']",Men in Black 3

He has to travel back in time to the 1960's to save a much-younger Agent K (Josh Brolin) from death at the hands of a time-traveling alien before Agent K can obtain protective, alien technology to shield the world from alien attack.This whole series is a real hoot. I've greatly enjoyed all three films, including this one. Will Smith is terrific, as always, but Tommy Lee Jones has a much smaller part in this third installment, and I did miss him as a co-star of the movie. However, Josh Brolin does a great job playing the younger version of Agent K.A particular standout in the film for me was the New Zealand comedic actor Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) who plays the villain, Boris, a motorcycle-riding alien with horrible eyes and teeth.This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy together--though it might be a bit scary for children under the age of 10 or so.",5,Highly entertaining sequel!,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1000,"['Aliens', 'are', 'bombard', 'Earth', 'extinction', 'only', 'hope', 'world', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'travel', 'back', 'time', '1960', 'save', 'much-younger', 'Agent', 'K', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'death', 'hands', 'time-traveling', 'alien', 'Agent', 'K', 'can', 'obtain', 'protective', 'alien', 'technology', 'shield', 'world', 'alien', 'attack.This', 'whole', 'series', 'real', 'hoot', ""'ve"", 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'films', 'including', 'one', 'Will', 'Smith', 'terrific', 'always', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'much', 'smaller', 'part', 'third', 'installment', 'did', 'miss', 'co-star', 'movie', 'However', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'younger', 'version', 'Agent', 'K.A', 'particular', 'standout', 'film', 'was', 'New', 'Zealand', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'who', 'villain', 'Boris', 'motorcycle-riding', 'alien', 'horrible', 'eyes', 'teeth.This', 'great', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy', 'together', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'scary', 'children', 'age', '10', 'so']",Men in Black 3

Do the actors still have chemistry and does the plot keep your eyes glued, no matter what? Needless to say, the last MIB wasn't that great, adding too much and too many new characters so I was hesitant to watch this one.In MIB3, what is pretty much a franchise re-boot, they went back to basics and kept it between K and J about their unique interaction. Smith and Jones have not lost their edge. This time 'round, it's time travel and visiting a young K and stopping an invasion...again.There's really nothing to dislike. Honestly. The plot was well written and tight. There was a surprising level of depth I really didn't expect but this franchise has always managed to have enough of it without getting mushy. No answers left unanswered. You learn a few more interesting things about the mysterious K. It had cool gadgets, a few alien ick factors and it didn't try to do too much. It's over the top enough with the ET element and it was nice to have a throwback, where the tech isn't so in your face. No part was hokey, it was tongue-in-cheek and fresh.James Brolin was the PERFECT young K. I mean, he really looks like he could have been Tommy Lee Jones' son in real life.

J has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never told him -- secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young Agent K to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind.The cast led by Will Smith (as Agent J), Tommy Lee Jones (as Agent K) & Josh Brolin (as Young Agent K) is great. The directing by Barry Sonnenfeld is great. The story & screenplay (based on Lowell Cunningham's comic book) by Etan Cohen is great.The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Bill Pope is great. The film editing by Don Zimmerman & Wayne Wahrman is great. The casting by Ellen Chenoweth is great. The production design by Bo Welch is great. The art direction by Kasra Farahani, Luke Freeborn, W. Steven Graham, Kevin Ishioka, Maya Shimoguchi & Chris Shriver is great. The set decoration by Susan Bode is great. The costume design by Mary E. Vogt is great. The make-up effects designed by Rick Baker is great. The visual effects supervised by Ken Ralston & Jay Redd and coordinated by Danielle Birch, Ann-Marie Blommaert, Rachel Faith Hanson, Nancy Heller, Chelsea Kammeyer, Eric Kimelton, Bryan Searing, Clint Spillers, Barry St. John, Claire Sun, Svetlana Tesnes & Yi Yang are great. The special effects supervised by Mark Hawker & coordinated by Jeff Brink are great. The stunts coordinated by Simon Crane, Doug Coleman, Wade Eastwood & Brian Machleit is great.This is a great sequel that was well worth the 10 years' wait on. This is much better than the last sequel and a little bit better than the original ""Men In Black"". This is a well-made and well-crafted sequel that is also a terrific summer movie, making it one of the best movies of the summer, so far.

1472319,A356RFKNIG043B,B005LAIHQS,K. Swanson,"[1, 2]","I liked the first two MIB, the first being the clear winner, so we rented this blu-ray expecting more of the same light comedy and fun goofiness. Instead we got one of the most fun time travel movies I've seen alongside a visual feast and a surprisingly emotional finish. For me at least this is by far the most interesting of the three films, lifted into the next level most of all by Stuhlbarg's oddly perfect moments.Smith and Jones are as usual vastly entertaining, and Clement is a great villain; one gets the feeling that Conchords was merely the start of what could turn out to be a truly classic career. Thompson is flawless as always but the real shock here was how Stuhlbarg took his role and added an amazing amount of depth to it, making the film even more strangely real. His smile and glittering eyes somehow make his scenes come alive in a way none of the other movies achieved.The script is both funny and very sharp, matched by Rick Baker's best space critters to date and phenomenal set design by Bo Welch. This movie really looks and feels like a mega-blockbuster should but also never feels pointlessly over the top like most popcorn sequels do. One of the highlights is seeing tons of ideas lifted from the best old sci-fi flicks; I saw echoes of Star Wars, Buck Rogers, Doctor Who, Barbarella, Blade Runner and so many other classics, all reimagined and retooled. There are some of the coolest gadgets here, and when set against the tight 1969 sets and cars and threads it all comes alive.All in all, this was the best big studio surprise I've had in a long time, and I wish I'd seen it in the theater. But it looks perfect on blu-ray, with a crisp transfer and incredible colors and black depth. There are also an hour plus of truly useful extras, in which you see that this really is all about Sonnenfeld's unique vision matched by Welch and Baker and Smith and the rest stepping up with their A-games. So this is what a big flick feels like when it all goes right!All in all, MIB 3 is a movie I'll gladly watch a few more times just to catch all the aliens and gadgets and colors and concepts, and above all the intelligent sense of fun that makes this one of the best third installments Hollywood has ever delivered.And watch out for Stuhlbarg; he sure nails his role, and if there's an Oscar for a tiny part that makes a film really click, he deserves it.",5,Unexpectedly intelligent,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,2382,"['liked', 'first', 'two', 'MIB', 'first', 'being', 'clear', 'winner', 'rented', 'blu-ray', 'expecting', 'more', 'same', 'light', 'comedy', 'fun', 'goofiness', 'Instead', 'got', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'visual', 'feast', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'finish', 'least', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'three', 'films', 'lifted', 'next', 'level', 'most', 'Stuhlbarg', 'oddly', 'perfect', 'moments.Smith', 'Jones', 'are', 'usual', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'Clement', 'great', 'villain', 'one', 'feeling', 'Conchords', 'was', 'merely', 'start', 'what', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'truly', 'classic', 'career', 'Thompson', 'flawless', 'always', 'real', 'shock', 'here', 'was', 'how', 'Stuhlbarg', 'took', 'role', 'added', 'amazing', 'amount', 'depth', 'making', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'strangely', 'real', 'smile', 'glittering', 'eyes', 'somehow', 'make', 'scenes', 'come', 'alive', 'way', 'none', 'other', 'movies', 'achieved.The', 'script', 'funny', 'very', 'sharp', 'matched', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'best', 'space', 'critters', 'date', 'phenomenal', 'set', 'design', 'Bo', 'Welch', 'movie', 'really', 'feels', 'mega-blockbuster', 'should', 'also', 'never', 'pointlessly', 'top', 'most', 'popcorn', 'sequels', 'do', 'One', 'highlights', 'seeing', 'tons', 'ideas', 'lifted', 'best', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', 'saw', 'echoes', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Barbarella', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'classics', 'reimagined', 'retooled', 'are', 'coolest', 'gadgets', 'here', 'when', 'set', 'tight', '1969', 'sets', 'cars', 'threads', 'alive.All', 'was', 'best', 'big', 'studio', 'surprise', ""'ve"", 'had', 'long', 'time', 'wish', ""'d"", 'seen', 'theater', 'perfect', 'blu-ray', 'crisp', 'transfer', 'incredible', 'colors', 'black', 'depth', 'are', 'also', 'hour', 'plus', 'truly', 'useful', 'extras', 'see', 'really', 'Sonnenfeld', 'unique', 'vision', 'matched', 'Welch', 'Baker', 'Smith', 'rest', 'stepping', 'up', 'A-games', 'what', 'big', 'flick', 'feels', 'when', 'right', 'MIB', '3', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'just', 'catch', 'aliens', 'gadgets', 'colors', 'concepts', 'intelligent', 'sense', 'fun', 'one', 'best', 'third', 'installments', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'delivered.And', 'watch', 'Stuhlbarg', 'sure', 'role', 'Oscar', 'tiny', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'click']",Men in Black 3

On the plus side, I really liked the Griffin character, and his quantum abilities to see multiple outcomes/realities at once. That made for fun cinema, and was the best part of the movie for me. However, the old characters felt stale, and because the plot involves a shift back in time (I don't want to go into too much detail so as not to spoil it), Tommy Lee Jones is not in a large chunk of it, since his younger self is played by Josh Brolin. And although Josh Brolin is good as the young Agent K, I didn't feel the chemistry between him and Will Smith was as strong as it is between Jones and Smith (and that was such a big part of the earlier movies.) I also felt the director went a little overboard with the gooey, gross special effects, and that this also took time away from the 'buddy movie' dynamic that made the first two so successful.

1472350,AX9C10JD538D9,B005LAIHQS,Liviania,"[0, 1]","Men In Black II (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray] was a disappointment.  It entertained, but it was a pale retread of the originalMen in Black (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray].  Now, after a long gap, there's another sequel, which just seems unnecessary.  But Men in Black 3 is, surprisingly, a good movie.For those who haven't heard anything about the story yet, here's the basics.  An old enemy of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) escapes lunar prison and goes back in time to kill K before he's arrested.  Agent J (Will Smith) must then go back in time to save his partner and help his partner save the world the same way he did in the original timeline.  This gives Men in Black 3 a chance to play with the dynamics of the central relationship.  Even as a junior agent, K is reluctant to leave J in control of the mission.Part of its success is brilliant casting.  When you think of a younger Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin does not come to mind.  But his Agent K is uncanny.  He's got Jones's mannerisms down pat, but there's a levity and energy to his performance that reverses the passage of time.  Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) plays Griffin, a fifth-dimensional being.  He's constantly babbling about which future he's in and the paths people might take.  This could be annoying, but Stuhlbarg (in his terrible woolen cap) sells it.  He's dorkily endearing.  Jermaine Clement, of Flight of the Conchords, is terrific as Boris the Animal.  (""It's just Boris."")  He's unrecognizable except for his deep voice, which is perfect for Boris's menacing proclamations.Emma Thompson and Alice Eve also join the cast as older and younger versions of Agent O.  Thompson does a fabulous job as always and Eve is fine in her few scenes.  But the film didn't quite earn K and O's semi-tragic never romantic relationship.  It's the problem of a series where each movie is produced without a plan for continuity.  K already had one wonderfully done failed relationship.  This one feels obligatory, like you can't have a summer blockbuster without a love interest.  O would have been fine as a fellow agent who just cared for K as a long-time colleague and friend.  (Or perhaps I'm just frustrated that at this point in the franchise all of the female good guys are love interests.)There are a couple of standout scenes.  There's a funeral for Zed, played in the first two films by Rip Torn.  Obviously Torn couldn't be in this film because of his legal troubles.  K's eulogy, paraphrased, ""He never told me anything and after decades I know nothing about his personal life,"" is perhaps the greatest compliment one man in black can give another and also hilariously brusque.  There's Agent J being hassled by cops in the past.  There's also Bill Hader's terrific cameo as Andy Warhol, unfortunately spoiled by the trailer.If you didn't like Men in Black, then I'd avoid Men in Black 3.  (Common sense, really.)  But if you did enjoy it, the new film might be a pleasant surprise.",4,Great casting leads to a surprisingly good sequel,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,2979,"['Men', 'Black', 'II', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'was', 'disappointment', 'entertained', 'was', 'pale', 'retread', 'originalMen', 'Black', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Now', 'long', 'gap', 'sequel', 'just', 'unnecessary', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anything', 'story', 'yet', 'here', 'basics', 'old', 'enemy', 'Agent', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'lunar', 'prison', 'back', 'time', 'kill', 'K', 'arrested', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'must', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'save', 'partner', 'help', 'partner', 'save', 'world', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'original', 'timeline', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'chance', 'play', 'dynamics', 'central', 'relationship', 'Even', 'junior', 'agent', 'K', 'reluctant', 'leave', 'J', 'control', 'mission.Part', 'success', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'When', 'think', 'younger', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'not', 'come', 'mind', 'Agent', 'K', 'uncanny', 'got', 'Jones', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'pat', 'levity', 'energy', 'performance', 'passage', 'time', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'Griffin', 'fifth-dimensional', 'being', 'constantly', 'babbling', 'future', 'paths', 'people', 'might', 'take', 'could', 'be', 'annoying', 'Stuhlbarg', 'terrible', 'woolen', 'cap', 'dorkily', 'endearing', 'Jermaine', 'Clement', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'terrific', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'just', 'Boris', 'unrecognizable', 'deep', 'voice', 'perfect', 'Boris', 'menacing', 'proclamations.Emma', 'Thompson', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'also', 'join', 'cast', 'older', 'younger', 'versions', 'Agent', 'O.', 'Thompson', 'fabulous', 'job', 'always', 'Eve', 'fine', 'few', 'scenes', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'earn', 'K', 'O', 'semi-tragic', 'never', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'problem', 'series', 'where', 'movie', 'produced', 'plan', 'continuity', 'K', 'already', 'had', 'one', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'failed', 'relationship', 'one', 'obligatory', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'love', 'interest', 'O', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'fellow', 'agent', 'who', 'just', 'cared', 'K', 'long-time', 'colleague', 'friend', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'just', 'frustrated', 'that', 'point', 'franchise', 'female', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'couple', 'standout', 'scenes', 'funeral', 'Zed', 'played', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Obviously', 'Torn', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'legal', 'troubles', 'K', 'eulogy', 'paraphrased', 'never', 'told', 'anything', 'decades', 'know', 'nothing', 'personal', 'life', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'compliment', 'one', 'man', 'black', 'can', 'give', 'also', 'hilariously', 'brusque', 'Agent', 'J', 'being', 'hassled', 'cops', 'past', 'also', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'terrific', 'cameo', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'unfortunately', 'spoiled', 'trailer.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Men', 'Black', 'then', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'Common', 'sense', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'new', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise']",Men in Black 3

MIB III is by the best of the three films in this franchise - why? Not because of the amazing special effects,  or the extreme use of incredible 3-D visuals thrown at you  - or - because of the incredible Rick Baker (Hellboy, X-Men: The Last Stand, Enchanted ) real creature make-up effects - it's because it mixed the best of storytelling and action/adventure with relatable characters and a sprinkle (or three) of good humor!Director Barry Sonnenfeld (Wild Wild West, Get Shorty) and writers Lowell Cunningham (Men In Black I & II)  and Etan Cohen (Madagascar 2, King of the Hill) did a very good job of bringing a characterization of obviously a sci-fi world, to real life. In emotion, they allowed the characters to grow and be flawed - and they tell why, how and even when. They did this film right and for the right reasons.The story involves the one thing that seems to mean blockbuster success at the box office - Time Travel (when they work - for example Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, The Terminator, Austin Powers: Man of Mystery!)  It's the concept of going back in time to prevent something that happened - from happening - changing the course of history. The time travel sequences are - if anything - original and stocked with amazing visual effects!Imagine Will Smith ""J"" traveling back in time to save Tommy Lee ""K"" from a murderous villain who survived but was not supposed too - while not changing an historical event in 1969 - Florida. Got it? The film tells and explains it all....creatively and humorously. Now add another amazing performance of Josh Brolin (W., No Country For Old Men) as accurately recreating every nuance of Tommy Lee as a younger version of ""K"". Will and Josh are just as amazing together as Tommy and Will.Will Smith (Hitch, Independence Day) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, Batman Forever) have an amazing chemistry together and the first two films work well in terms of their comedy styling's, but this one has a big heart and compassion and you are not left `wondering why' as so many films tends to do in this genre. Tommy's dead pan delivery and Will's `off the cuff' deliveries make for some very funny moments.Some standout performances, if for their humor alone come from, Emma Thompson (Harry Potter, Nanny ""O"" McPhee) as the linguistically gifted Chief of MIB (it is sad to see Rip Torn not in this film) and Jermaine Clement (Rio, Despicable Me) as the ever creepy and extremely visual bad guy of the film. He is intense and extremely ruthless in his performance against Tommy Lee.The effects and CG, combined with the enhanced 3-D style of photography, just add to the film. It's fun, adventurous, candy to the eye and several times may make you jump with a few surprises. (All funny and alien in nature!)One other stand out performance comes from a character who can see as many as five alternate realities at a time - visually stunning and performed imaginatively by Michael Suhlbarg (Hugo, A Serious Man). His ethereal performance adds, explains and even enhances the story to where if this all could be true...this is how it would happen. He is also part of the reason this film has more of a heart than the first two.Lastly I cannot forget to mention Danny Elfman's (Alice In Wonderland, Batman) as the returning composer of the score. If you are not tapping your feet (or humming the tune) to the thumps of the MIB signature theme as the action unfolds...time to get your ears checked!This film had everything for me; it's fun, it's funny, it's got action, it's got special effects and - more importantly - it's got a great story with a good heart in the center of all of it.  I predict it will probably do well at the box office.

1472369,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B005LAIHQS,MacJunegrand,"[1, 1]","I will be honest here.  I liked MiB II, despite the general consensus being that it's terrible.  I mean, I didn't think it was as good, fun or interesting as the first one, but I don't think it's deserving of the hate it keeps getting.That being said, I didn't have much hopes for this movie.  I kept reading about production problems, script rewritings, filming delays and such, and it did look like MiB (the first movie) was going to be the highlight of the series.After watching the movie in theaters, I'm pleased to announce that is not the case.  I'm prepared to call this movie the highlight (although marginally).  Despite all the problems it had, it's just that good.Yes, the film has a couple of problems and noticeable plot holes, and you get to notice that different scenes of the movie were written by different people.  Why 5 stars, then?  Because it's a really, really entertaining film.The special effects are great, there's no doubt about it.  While the side aliens are not as interesting as other ones in the previous films, the main ones are some of the best, both in concept and portrayal.  Main guys Smith and Jones are as good as ever, if not better.  The 60's setting is very well done (as you might know, this movie involves time travel).  One of the film's highlights, of course, is Brolin's portrayal as 69's Agent K.  His job as portraying a younger Tommy Lee Jones is, at minimum, superb.The script is more interesting too, despite suffering from so many writes and rewrites.  The story is quite engaging, and the movie is character-driven, and surprisingly emotional.  A part of the film will most likely leave you in tears, even in your second or third viewing.All in all, the good far surpasses the bad, so this is a film which deserves to be watched several times.As for the Blu Ray, the quality of the film is top notch.

But it has.Hopefully, this is a bump in the road. A flat tire and not complete engine failure, because the man is just too talented to be washed up. On the other hand, I see from IMDb that the majority of his next few projects are all sequels to films he's done in the past. That's generally a bad sign - squeezing the last bit of toothpaste out of a squashed and beaten shell. i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger.The story opens with a correct linear timeline: 14 years after MIB2, which in itself is rather telling. Anyway, a nasty alien creep has just escaped from the secret lunar prison. His goal - go back in time and prevent Agent K from deploying a global defense net around Earth. And in doing so, allowing his creepy race to ravage our planet in the future. Agent J's mission is to stop the alien, prevent Agent K's death and thereby saving the world. Yawntastic. Additionally, a touching sidestory and clich&eacute;d plot device, of J finally getting to meet his father; whom he always believed had abandoned him and his mother when he was still a young child.This film reminds me of the recent disaster known as 'Dark Shadows', where another displaced character finds himself immersed in a world he couldn't imagine. And just like that crock pile, there were lost opportunities; not taking full advantage of the fish-out-of-water theme.Boring, boring, boring. No gas, no go.If you've ever seen the recentDoctor Whoprograms (any of the new Doctors) - that - that's what this franchise so desperately needed. In all seriousness, the producers should have hired the entire Dr. Who creative team, paid them whatever they wanted, and told them to go to work.The only thing that made this movie endurable: Josh Brolin. His incredible spot-on impression of Tommy Lee Jones adding depth and energy into a character that I think has run its full and total course. Nothing left now to resurrect, in any form - ever.Had hoped that, like the fantasticMission: Impossible - Ghost Protocoland stunning rebootedStar Trek (2009), this sequel would be a sparkling new wellspring of ideas and energy, showcasing the franchise in a fresh light.Didn't happen.And just like dour Agent K - Director Barry Sonnenfield has definitely run his course; the past decade has shown that repeatedly and regrettably. If nothing else, Emma Thompson's cringe-worthy 'alien eulogy' ought to prove that beyond any shadow of a doubt.My sincere hope is that Smith finds a new... something. He's done 'cop' to death, every variation, every scenario. Sure, he does the occasional run for an Oscar (which is looking more and more unlikely every year that passes) but the bread-n-butter material is desperately needed at this point.

1472381,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B005LAIHQS,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 2]","THE PLOT: J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) encounter troubles when a dangerous alien criminal, Boris (Jemaine Clement), escapes from his moon-based prison and goes back in time to kill K before the agent can capture and imprison him. When K (and all of his influence on the world) dissolves away, only J remembers him, which sends him back in time to 1969 to save his partner.WHY YOU MIGHT LIKE IT: The formula hasn't changed much. Will Smith does a really good Will Smith impression, and most of his wisecracks are amusing. There are some standard ""fish out of water"" jokes when K goes back to the less-than-tolerant 60's, but that is far less obtrusive than it could be. The weapons, the creatures, the special effects, and the slap-happy plotting are great, chewy fun, like a B-movie with an A-movie budget. In other words, this movie walks pretty much the same lines as its predecessors, and it does so with a comforting and addictive flair.WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT: If you are a person who thinks more than he feels, you'll very quickly notice some gaping holes in the plot, most of which yawn wide open in the third act. Movies that involve time travel usually have to dance around shaky logic, but this film doesn't even bother with that. At a key moment in the plot -- the final climax -- J uses his time travel device in a way that doesn't even TRY to make sense. The screenwriters must have known this, because the scene moves too fast for any viewer to really stop and understand it. Then the story very quickly shifts into heartstrings territory, providing the audience with a conclusion that is so sweetly sad that it is nearly emotional enough to distract from the fact that it, too, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.Adding to the story's befuddlement is the addition of an alien character named Griffin. A fifth-dimensional being, Griffin is able to view and exist in multiple timelines at the same time, making him both omnipresent and omniscient. He is essentially God, if God were an effeminate voyeur with a cold. As a God-like character, Griffin acts as a double-barreled deus ex machina. He provides the story with more than a few easy outs, but the solutions he provide raise further questions that the movie is in too much of a hurry to bother answering.It's all in good silly fun, most people will tell you, and they're right. It's quite enjoyable if you're willing to suspend your disbelief a little longer than you might normally, even for a movie about time travelling aliens. Fastidious viewers will find a lot here to rant about, but the kid in you might find enough reason to shrug off the flaws and just enjoy the ride.",4,Brainwave Not Required,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2661,"['PLOT', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'encounter', 'troubles', 'when', 'dangerous', 'alien', 'criminal', 'Boris', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'moon-based', 'prison', 'back', 'time', 'kill', 'K', 'agent', 'can', 'capture', 'imprison', 'When', 'K', 'influence', 'world', 'away', 'only', 'J', 'remembers', 'back', 'time', '1969', 'save', 'partner.WHY', 'YOU', 'MIGHT', 'IT', 'formula', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'Will', 'Smith', 'really', 'good', 'Will', 'Smith', 'impression', 'most', 'wisecracks', 'are', 'amusing', 'are', 'standard', 'fish', 'water', 'jokes', 'when', 'K', 'back', 'less-than-tolerant', '60', 'far', 'less', 'obtrusive', 'could', 'be', 'weapons', 'creatures', 'special', 'effects', 'slap-happy', 'plotting', 'are', 'great', 'chewy', 'fun', 'B-movie', 'A-movie', 'budget', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'lines', 'predecessors', 'so', 'comforting', 'addictive', 'flair.WHY', 'YOU', 'MIGHT', 'NOT', 'IT', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'more', ""'ll"", 'very', 'quickly', 'notice', 'gaping', 'holes', 'plot', 'most', 'yawn', 'wide', 'open', 'third', 'act', 'Movies', 'involve', 'time', 'travel', 'usually', 'have', 'dance', 'around', 'shaky', 'logic', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'key', 'moment', 'plot', 'final', 'climax', 'J', 'time', 'travel', 'device', 'way', ""n't"", 'even', 'TRY', 'make', 'sense', 'screenwriters', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'scene', 'too', 'fast', 'viewer', 'really', 'stop', 'understand', 'Then', 'story', 'very', 'quickly', 'shifts', 'heartstrings', 'territory', 'providing', 'audience', 'conclusion', 'so', 'sweetly', 'sad', 'nearly', 'emotional', 'enough', 'distract', 'fact', 'too', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'whatsoever.Adding', 'story', 'befuddlement', 'addition', 'alien', 'character', 'named', 'Griffin', 'fifth-dimensional', 'being', 'Griffin', 'able', 'view', 'exist', 'multiple', 'timelines', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'omnipresent', 'omniscient', 'essentially', 'God', 'God', 'were', 'effeminate', 'voyeur', 'cold', 'God-like', 'character', 'Griffin', 'double-barreled', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'story', 'more', 'few', 'easy', 'outs', 'solutions', 'provide', 'raise', 'further', 'questions', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'hurry', 'bother', 'answering.It', 'good', 'silly', 'fun', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'tell', ""'re"", 'right', 'quite', 'enjoyable', ""'re"", 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'little', 'longer', 'might', 'normally', 'even', 'movie', 'time', 'travelling', 'aliens', 'Fastidious', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'here', 'rant', 'kid', 'might', 'find', 'enough', 'reason', 'shrug', 'off', 'flaws', 'just', 'enjoy', 'ride']",Men in Black 3

1472386,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIHQS,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","With so many remakes and sequels being made these days it's nice to have some being made that are actually well done. More often than not these types of films are rushed into production and rarely come close to being as original or fun as the first films. Such is not the case with MEN IN BLACK 3.Believe it or not it's been 10 years since the last film in this series. Agents K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) are still cleaning up alien disasters on Earth and saving mankind even though mankind has no clue that it's going on. The head of their organization, Zed, has passed away and the memorial for him is less than, well, memorable. J still can't get K to open up. And then a crisis happens.At the prison facility on the moon, the worst scum of outer space has broken loose. Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped. Captured and put in this prison as well as having his arm shot off by K 40 years ago, Boris wants nothing more than revenge. His plan is to escape, get back to Earth and go back in time to make sure K never gets past their original meeting.All of this happens with the exception of J remembering K like nothing has changed. When he goes to work, no one there understands why he thinks K is his partner since K was killed 40 years earlier. That is until he talks to O (Emma Thompson). She realizes that time has been altered. When an attack on Earth by Boris and the rest of the group from his planet begins, J must go back in time to make sure that he doesn't have the chance to alter things thus saving not only the world by K as well.The first thing that makes this work so well is the story. It's not a rehash of past films and gives us something new to consider. It also allows the closeness between the two partners be developed a little more. While K displays nothing, deep down you catch glimpses of his fondness for J.The second thing that makes this movie click is the performance by Josh Brolin as the young K. Not only does his appearance almost uncannily like that of Jones, he has his mannerisms and speech patterns down to a T. At times you might find yourself thinking that this is indeed a young Tommy Lee Jones and wonder how they were actually able to go back in time to get him for this part. But the fact is it's just that great of a performance by Brolin.Both Jones and Smith play their roles like there's been no time between the last film and this one. Jones continues to offer the most deadpan of stoic faces and Smith has the sarcastic quick wit of Agent J down like it's his normal way of behaving.Once again the special effects are fantastic and will have you pausing the DVD to get a better glimpse of each and every alien. Some seem to look familiar and others new, but each one is original and helps to create a realistic look for the encounters they have with the agents.More than anything this movie offers you a lot of fun. It's not as serious as the topic might sound even though any invasion of Earth by another life form from space would be quite serious. The laughs come easily and the drama that underlies the whole story, J's closeness and attachment to K, make it a complete story. If you want entertainment when renting, or buying, this week then you won't go wrong with this one.",4,MEN IN BLACK ARE BACK!,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,3254,"['so', 'many', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'being', 'made', 'days', 'nice', 'have', 'being', 'made', 'are', 'actually', 'well', 'done', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'types', 'films', 'are', 'rushed', 'production', 'rarely', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'original', 'fun', 'first', 'films', 'Such', 'not', 'case', 'MEN', 'IN', 'BLACK', '3.Believe', 'not', 'been', '10', 'years', 'last', 'film', 'series', 'Agents', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'are', 'still', 'cleaning', 'up', 'alien', 'disasters', 'Earth', 'saving', 'mankind', 'even', 'mankind', 'clue', 'going', 'head', 'organization', 'Zed', 'passed', 'away', 'memorial', 'less', 'well', 'memorable', 'J', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'K', 'open', 'up', 'then', 'crisis', 'happens.At', 'prison', 'facility', 'moon', 'worst', 'scum', 'outer', 'space', 'broken', 'loose', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'escaped', 'Captured', 'put', 'prison', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'arm', 'shot', 'K', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'Boris', 'nothing', 'more', 'revenge', 'plan', 'escape', 'get', 'back', 'Earth', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'K', 'never', 'past', 'original', 'meeting.All', 'exception', 'J', 'remembering', 'K', 'nothing', 'changed', 'When', 'work', 'one', 'there', 'why', 'K', 'partner', 'K', 'was', 'killed', '40', 'years', 'earlier', 'O', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'time', 'been', 'altered', 'When', 'attack', 'Earth', 'Boris', 'rest', 'group', 'planet', 'J', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'alter', 'things', 'thus', 'saving', 'not', 'only', 'world', 'K', 'well.The', 'first', 'thing', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'story', 'not', 'rehash', 'past', 'films', 'something', 'new', 'consider', 'also', 'closeness', 'two', 'partners', 'be', 'developed', 'little', 'more', 'K', 'displays', 'nothing', 'deep', 'catch', 'glimpses', 'fondness', 'J.The', 'second', 'thing', 'movie', 'click', 'performance', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'young', 'K.', 'Not', 'only', 'appearance', 'almost', 'uncannily', 'Jones', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'patterns', 'down', 'T.', 'times', 'might', 'find', 'thinking', 'indeed', 'young', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'wonder', 'how', 'were', 'actually', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'get', 'part', 'fact', 'just', 'great', 'performance', 'Brolin.Both', 'Jones', 'Smith', 'play', 'roles', 'been', 'time', 'last', 'film', 'one', 'Jones', 'offer', 'most', 'deadpan', 'stoic', 'Smith', 'sarcastic', 'quick', 'wit', 'Agent', 'J', 'normal', 'way', 'behaving.Once', 'again', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'will', 'have', 'pausing', 'DVD', 'get', 'better', 'glimpse', 'alien', 'seem', 'look', 'familiar', 'others', 'new', 'one', 'original', 'create', 'realistic', 'look', 'encounters', 'have', 'agents.More', 'anything', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'not', 'as', 'serious', 'topic', 'might', 'sound', 'even', 'invasion', 'Earth', 'life', 'form', 'space', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'serious', 'laughs', 'come', 'easily', 'drama', 'whole', 'story', 'J', 'closeness', 'attachment', 'K', 'make', 'complete', 'story', 'want', 'entertainment', 'when', 'renting', 'buying', 'week', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'one']",Men in Black 3

The general feel of the whole movie didn't feel all that fresh, and it repeated a lot of the same old jokes from the first two. I guess you could argue they are more of a calling card or what not, but I felt like I'd heard them before, especially since now they have been repeated in a re-write 3 times. Will Smith as J didn't seem to be as fun this time around, and K well, he is always the same, except now he has a new guy playing his younger self. As you can tell by the trailer, the plot is about an alien who escapes prison. This alien had his arm shot off by K back in the 60's, so he when he escapes he travels back in time to change history. J wakes up to find K is dead and has been since the 60's. So, without the need of thinking why he even still remembers K, he travels back in time to stop the evil alien from changing history.A few other things bugged me in the movie, not just the repeat of the same old jokes, but the lack of introducing memorable characters. There isn't even the talking pug in this one, just a poster of him and a reference to what he is up to in the 60's... I dunno why they would not bring him back, but continue to include those annoying little worm aliens. It didn't feel like it was a fun joyride with a clever ending this time... in the last two movies, it was like, the action built on top of the action and kept rising to a final climax... but this one, euhh, it just goes and barely picks up any steam.I didn't even really laugh much during the film, and when I did, it was a small chuckle, not a burst out laugh. It feels now like the original MIB made new grounds for comedy and the special effects where exciting, but now, it seems like common place and the original feel of excitement has become formula over everything else.I'm not saying it's a bad movie tho, it does explain a few things you may have wondered and ties in a few things... but still, it does remain to keep alot of questions open, so I expect they will be back for MIB4.",3,"Decent, but the weakest of the 3 films.",1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2204,"['MIB', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'loved', 'who', 'loved', 'such', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'Ghostbusters', 'etc..', 'now', '3rd', 'installment', 'along', 'nowhere', 'seeing', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'general', 'feel', 'whole', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fresh', 'repeated', 'lot', 'same', 'old', 'jokes', 'first', 'two', 'guess', 'could', 'argue', 'are', 'more', 'calling', 'card', 'what', 'not', 'felt', ""'d"", 'heard', 'especially', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'repeated', 're-write', '3', 'times', 'Will', 'Smith', 'J', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'fun', 'time', 'K', 'well', 'always', 'same', 'now', 'new', 'guy', 'playing', 'younger', 'self', 'can', 'tell', 'trailer', 'plot', 'alien', 'who', 'prison', 'alien', 'had', 'arm', 'shot', 'K', 'back', '60', 'so', 'when', 'back', 'time', 'change', 'history', 'J', 'up', 'find', 'K', 'dead', 'been', '60', 'So', 'need', 'thinking', 'why', 'even', 'still', 'K', 'back', 'time', 'stop', 'evil', 'alien', 'changing', 'history.A', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'bugged', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'repeat', 'same', 'old', 'jokes', 'lack', 'introducing', 'memorable', 'characters', ""n't"", 'even', 'talking', 'pug', 'one', 'just', 'poster', 'reference', 'what', 'up', '60', 'dunno', 'why', 'would', 'not', 'bring', 'back', 'continue', 'include', 'annoying', 'little', 'worm', 'aliens', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'fun', 'joyride', 'clever', 'ending', 'time', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'action', 'built', 'top', 'action', 'kept', 'rising', 'final', 'climax', 'one', 'euhh', 'just', 'barely', 'up', 'steam.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'laugh', 'much', 'film', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'small', 'chuckle', 'not', 'burst', 'out', 'laugh', 'now', 'original', 'MIB', 'made', 'new', 'grounds', 'comedy', 'special', 'effects', 'where', 'exciting', 'now', 'common', 'place', 'original', 'feel', 'excitement', 'become', 'formula', 'everything', 'else.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'movie', 'tho', 'explain', 'few', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'wondered', 'ties', 'few', 'things', 'still', 'remain', 'keep', 'alot', 'questions', 'open', 'so', 'expect', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'MIB4']",Men in Black 3

1472429,A3G4MPMSA9T3HK,B005LAIHQS,M. Mierendorf,"[1, 1]","When Men in Black came out in 1997, I was thirteen. Will Smith was a huge box office star (and he arguably still is), and his rap career was about to explode thanks to his album, Big Willie Style (1997). When I first saw Men in Black, I was a huge fan. I was impressed with the creative story and willingness to accept the absurdity of dealing with aliens. It was refreshing, funny, and entertaining. Then, in 2002, the less enjoyable sequel came out. It was still a box office success but not as widely regarded or enjoyed as the original.Fast forward to 2012. Men in Black 3 seems like a logical film to finish a trilogy, but it also doesn't seem necessary. The teenager in me was more than excited to see MIB3, but my expectations weren't that high. However, as soon as the movie ended, I walked out of the theater incredibly impressed.Men in Black 3 takes place fourteen years after the original. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and  Agent J (Will Smith) are still partners. K is still old, cranky, and by the book. J is still the fun, sarcastic, ambitious, and unpredictable agent. The relationship between K and J worked fifteen years ago, and it still does. In fact, their relationship is the crux of the whole film.The film begins with an elaborate prison break from Lunar Max, the super-high security prison for alien criminals on the moon. Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) is regarded as the most dangerous prisoner there and, of course, is the first to escape. Boris has a magical little creature that lives in his hand and shoots an unlimited number of bone spikes, thus providing him with plenty of ammunition. He is hell-bent on escaping the Moon in order to have revenge on K for shooting his arm off forty years ago and putting him in prison.It's a simple enough plot and a wonderfully absurd reason for Boris' evil motivations. Boris escapes back to Earth and seeks out the ability to travel back in time to kill K before he shoots his arm off. This is where the film really hits its stride. In a touching scene, K attempts to talk to an angry J about some universal secrets he hasn't shared yet. J is furious that these secrets still exist after being partners with K for fourteen years. After J discontinues their conversation, K awaits a fight with Boris. But the fight never comes, and K literarily vanishes on the screen.With Boris successfully killing K in the past, J must go back to 1969 (when K dies) to save him and the world. Back in 1969, young K (Josh Brolin) is a fun loving, young, hotshot agent. Brolin masterfully captures the character of K but still adds his personal touches. He isn't as cranky, and there are moments of true emotion. J's ongoing joke is always, ""What happened to you?"" Because of the sophistication of the relationship between the young K and J, the film offers more than just popcorn- and explosion-fodder entertainment. It actually creates something more important: a character-based film with people you actually care about.Without going into details, the climax of the movie is exciting, thrilling, and heartbreaking. The consequences redefine the entire trilogy for the characters. In fact the climax of Men in Black 3 makes the first film even better and will only improve it with repeated viewings of the trilogy.From a geek perspective, Men in Black 3 is also one of the single best examples of the depiction of time travel in recent films. The cause and effect consequences of meddling with time are all apparent, thought out, and used perfectly in various parts of the film. It's an almost realistic take on time travel. There are no apparent time paradoxes created, and it's not a plot that is challenging to ponder within its various timelines.Director Barry Sonnenfeld has been hit or miss in his career (mostly hit), but he nails it here. His vision for color and character contrast is his masterstroke, and this is one of his best achievements yet as a director.Men In Black 3 is by far the best of the trilogy and a wonderful way to end the series (hopefully, but unlikely). Yes, it's a great popcorn, summer blockbuster, but thanks to a creative, funny, and entertaining screenplay, it has the makings of a film to be much appreciated long after its theatrical release.",4,"Like a Fine Wine, the MIB Get Better with Age",1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,4237,"['When', 'Men', 'Black', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'was', 'thirteen', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'star', 'arguably', 'still', 'rap', 'career', 'was', 'explode', 'thanks', 'album', 'Big', 'Willie', 'Style', '1997', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Men', 'Black', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'was', 'impressed', 'creative', 'story', 'willingness', 'accept', 'absurdity', 'dealing', 'aliens', 'was', 'refreshing', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Then', '2002', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'sequel', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'still', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'not', 'widely', 'regarded', 'enjoyed', 'original.Fast', 'forward', '2012', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'logical', 'film', 'finish', 'trilogy', 'also', ""n't"", 'seem', 'necessary', 'teenager', 'was', 'more', 'excited', 'see', 'MIB3', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'high', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'ended', 'walked', 'theater', 'incredibly', 'impressed.Men', 'Black', '3', 'place', 'fourteen', 'years', 'original', 'Agent', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'are', 'still', 'partners', 'K', 'still', 'old', 'cranky', 'book', 'J', 'still', 'fun', 'sarcastic', 'ambitious', 'unpredictable', 'agent', 'relationship', 'K', 'J', 'worked', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'fact', 'relationship', 'crux', 'whole', 'film.The', 'film', 'elaborate', 'prison', 'break', 'Lunar', 'Max', 'super-high', 'security', 'prison', 'alien', 'criminals', 'moon', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'regarded', 'most', 'dangerous', 'prisoner', 'course', 'first', 'escape', 'Boris', 'magical', 'little', 'creature', 'hand', 'shoots', 'unlimited', 'number', 'bone', 'spikes', 'thus', 'providing', 'plenty', 'ammunition', 'hell-bent', 'escaping', 'Moon', 'order', 'have', 'revenge', 'K', 'shooting', 'arm', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'putting', 'prison.It', 'simple', 'enough', 'plot', 'wonderfully', 'absurd', 'reason', 'Boris', 'evil', 'motivations', 'Boris', 'back', 'Earth', 'out', 'ability', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'kill', 'K', 'shoots', 'arm', 'off', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'stride', 'touching', 'scene', 'K', 'talk', 'angry', 'J', 'universal', 'secrets', ""n't"", 'shared', 'yet', 'J', 'furious', 'secrets', 'still', 'exist', 'being', 'partners', 'K', 'fourteen', 'years', 'J', 'conversation', 'K', 'fight', 'Boris', 'fight', 'never', 'K', 'literarily', 'screen.With', 'Boris', 'successfully', 'killing', 'K', 'past', 'J', 'must', 'go', 'back', '1969', 'when', 'K', 'save', 'world', 'Back', '1969', 'young', 'K', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'fun', 'loving', 'young', 'hotshot', 'agent', 'Brolin', 'masterfully', 'character', 'K', 'still', 'personal', 'touches', ""n't"", 'cranky', 'are', 'moments', 'true', 'emotion', 'J', 'ongoing', 'joke', 'always', 'What', 'happened', 'sophistication', 'relationship', 'young', 'K', 'J', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'popcorn-', 'explosion-fodder', 'entertainment', 'actually', 'something', 'more', 'important', 'character-based', 'film', 'people', 'actually', 'care', 'going', 'details', 'climax', 'movie', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'heartbreaking', 'consequences', 'redefine', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'characters', 'fact', 'climax', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'will', 'only', 'improve', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'trilogy.From', 'geek', 'perspective', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'also', 'one', 'single', 'best', 'examples', 'depiction', 'time', 'travel', 'recent', 'films', 'cause', 'effect', 'consequences', 'meddling', 'time', 'are', 'apparent', 'thought', 'out', 'used', 'perfectly', 'various', 'parts', 'film', 'almost', 'realistic', 'take', 'time', 'travel', 'are', 'apparent', 'time', 'paradoxes', 'created', 'not', 'plot', 'challenging', 'ponder', 'various', 'timelines.Director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'career', 'mostly', 'hit', 'here', 'vision', 'color', 'character', 'contrast', 'masterstroke', 'one', 'best', 'achievements', 'yet', 'director.Men', 'Black', '3', 'far', 'best', 'trilogy', 'wonderful', 'way', 'end', 'series', 'hopefully', 'unlikely', 'Yes', 'great', 'popcorn', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'thanks', 'creative', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'screenplay', 'makings', 'film', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated', 'long', 'theatrical', 'release']",Men in Black 3

Still keeping order with an assortment of space creatures inhabiting Earth, but one invader known as Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) is so evil he has been sequestered in a special prison on the Moon.  Put there 40 years earlier by K, he manages to escape thanks to a special cake brought to him by his ""girlfriend,"" a delicious Nicole Scherzinger.Once on the loose he discovers a way to go back in time to 1969 where K managed to stop Boris and his plan to destroy Earth with more of his species enroute.  J makes the leap back as well in order to kill Boris (""I'm no animal"") before the future is changed.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld returns at the helm and manages to infuse the film with goodly amounts of humor (did you know all models are aliens?), CGI wizardry and a lump-in-your-throat ending.Bringing in Josh Brolin as young agent K is a brilliant addition.  His spot-on characterization of Jones's voice and mannerisms is remarkable.  There is a hint of romance between young K and young Agent O (Alice Eve) that never gets played out.  Too bad.  In the current time frame, O is now the boss, played by Emma Thompson who has a great speech as the film opens.

If anything, the gap since the last one and subsequent lowering of expectations has helped this one by de-linking it somewhat from the first two.  And that's probably a good thing, since while still a hoot to watch, this certainly has some unfavorable differences from its predecessors.  Primarily, Tommy Lee Jones is missed.  Even in his 5 minutes or so of screen time as K, he doesn't seem exactly `present'.  This is compensated by having Josh Brolin do the best Tommy Lee Jones impression imaginable.. so perhaps I should take a quick moment to explain..This is a time travel story.  Present day, K is dropping hints about great secrets left to be discovered.  K however is wiped out of existence, by an old nemesis escaping from prison, going back in time, and making sure most of K's career never happened.  It's up to J to go back to the 60's and put things right, to save his partner, and almost incidentally, the planet.  So Brolin is the younger K, and really does an outstanding job.  The other missing element however, is the edge - the first two had some genuinely black humor which somehow seems softened round the edges in this one.  Is the director Barry Sonnenfeld getting mellower with age?  I'd like to think so, rather than the alternative, that the writers just got lazier.Those are minor quibbles, only happening because the first two (or at least the first) are much beloved.. but this really does work more than some of the critics would have you believe.  If the time traveling element starts to get a little wrapped up in itself near the end, its ok, because at 106 minutes the pace is fast enough you don't really pause to notice or think about it.  And the heart is provided this time by the new character Griffin, who is certainly likeable in his role as a being who is aware of multiple timelines.  The 60's continues to be a gold mine of humour for cinema.. interacting with characters both real and fictional from the 60's adds a new element that could probably have been mined for more laughs, but gets it just right by not over-egging the pudding.  The `bad guy' Boris the Animal (""It's just Boris!"") fills a required role without being either as menacing or as involving as his predecessors, but does the job.All told - a welcome addition to the MIB series, and even if TLJ is missed, the other elements make this still a solid worthwhile watch.",4,Never too late for some more MIB,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,2556,"['been', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'last', 'MIB', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'sitting', 'home', 'thinking', 'must', 'have', 'one..', 'yet', 'here', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'anything', 'gap', 'last', 'one', 'subsequent', 'lowering', 'expectations', 'helped', 'one', 'de-linking', 'somewhat', 'first', 'two', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'still', 'hoot', 'watch', 'certainly', 'unfavorable', 'differences', 'predecessors', 'Primarily', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'missed', 'Even', '5', 'minutes', 'so', 'screen', 'time', 'K', ""n't"", 'seem', 'exactly', 'present', 'compensated', 'having', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'do', 'best', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'impression', 'imaginable..', 'perhaps', 'should', 'take', 'quick', 'moment', 'explain..This', 'time', 'travel', 'story', 'Present', 'day', 'K', 'dropping', 'hints', 'great', 'secrets', 'left', 'be', 'discovered', 'K', 'however', 'wiped', 'existence', 'old', 'nemesis', 'escaping', 'prison', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'making', 'sure', 'most', 'K', 'career', 'never', 'happened', 'up', 'J', 'go', 'back', '60', 'put', 'things', 'right', 'save', 'partner', 'almost', 'incidentally', 'planet', 'So', 'Brolin', 'younger', 'K', 'really', 'outstanding', 'job', 'other', 'missing', 'element', 'however', 'edge', 'first', 'two', 'had', 'genuinely', 'black', 'humor', 'somehow', 'softened', 'edges', 'one', 'director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'getting', 'mellower', 'age', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'so', 'rather', 'alternative', 'writers', 'just', 'got', 'lazier.Those', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'only', 'happening', 'first', 'two', 'least', 'first', 'are', 'much', 'beloved..', 'really', 'work', 'more', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'time', 'traveling', 'element', 'get', 'little', 'wrapped', 'up', 'end', 'ok', '106', 'minutes', 'pace', 'fast', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'pause', 'notice', 'think', 'heart', 'provided', 'time', 'new', 'character', 'Griffin', 'who', 'certainly', 'likeable', 'role', 'being', 'who', 'aware', 'multiple', 'timelines', '60', 'be', 'gold', 'mine', 'humour', 'cinema..', 'interacting', 'characters', 'real', 'fictional', '60', 'new', 'element', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'mined', 'more', 'laughs', 'just', 'right', 'not', 'over-egging', 'pudding', 'bad', 'guy', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'just', 'Boris', 'required', 'role', 'being', 'menacing', 'as', 'involving', 'predecessors', 'job.All', 'told', 'welcome', 'addition', 'MIB', 'series', 'even', 'TLJ', 'missed', 'other', 'elements', 'make', 'still', 'solid', 'worthwhile', 'watch']",Men in Black 3

Theater in my home where it open closed years ago.I really enjoyed the first film.  Original, funny with good action/adventure.Then we get to the second film.  I was disappointed .  Director Barry Sonnenfeld  basically just used Will doing this part he can do in his sleep-the smart mouth.  Tommy wasted in the role since it took long enough to bring K back into the film.Now, we get to this film.What a major disappointment.  After film 2 I was NOT looking forward to this & after seeing it.  Just a BIG disappointment..  The chemistry between Tommy & Will in the first film was gone.

NOT ORIGINAL  A salute to Austin Powers I guess.Emma Thompson was wasted here-saw here in only part of the film replacing Rip Torn.  They could have done so much more with the character.I will not spoil end of film here.  BUT, I guessed the end a mile before we got to it.  Then, it hit a wall & did not give follow up to the story line with K & O.The main villain-a loud mouth & killer darts from another alien?

Excuse me, they also stole from Return of the Jedi?A bad job all the way around.  2012 the year Tommy had-this was a hit BUT the least successful of the films, Hope Springs & then Lincoln.Oh, one of thing the film makers/company did.  We know DVD's & blu rays are normally released on Tuesdays right?

In truth, ""Men in Black 3"" was a very necessary film.  It boosted the series by helping to remove the bad taste of the incoherent, and utterly irrelevant, ""Men In Black 2"".While ""MIB 3"" does bring back Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Agents J and K, respectively, there are some notable changes.  Zed (Rip Torn) has passed away prior to this film and he is replaced by Agent O (Emma Thompson), who has a complicated history with Agent K.  When the story sends Agent J back in time, the younger versions of O and K are placed by Alice Eve and Josh Brolin (who does a perfect imitation of what you would think a young Agent K would be like).The main story deals with the very lethal alien, Boris the Animal (he says, ""It's just Boris!"") being sprung from a Supermax prison on the surface of the moon, after more than 40 years of incarceration.  He locates some underground technology that allows him to travel back in time, prior to his capture, and kill the young Agent K, setting the stage for his species, the Boglodites, the invade and destroy Earth decades later.The change in the timeline has everyone not remembering who Agent K is other than the much older agents (like O).  Yet, somehow, J was immune to the timeline change and his goal is to back in time, save K, defeat Boris and save the Earth.  Just your typical day at MIB.The problem with the second film was that it was riding on the coattails of the first and using familiarity with the characters and environment as a substitute for an actual plot.  I felt that way when I saw it in 2002 and subsequent viewings on cable since then have not changed my opinion.  ""MIB 3"" brought a more coherent plot, with better villains and side characters.  The end result was a much-needed shot of adrenaline that led to tremendous box office returns and a guarantee of ""MIB 4"".",4,"Revives the franchise after the horribly dull ""MIB 2""",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,1955,"['When', 'third', 'Men', 'Black', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'second', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'shrugged', 'asked', 'why', 'truth', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'was', 'very', 'necessary', 'film', 'boosted', 'series', 'helping', 'remove', 'bad', 'taste', 'incoherent', 'utterly', 'irrelevant', 'Men', 'Black', '2', 'MIB', '3', 'bring', 'back', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Agents', 'J', 'K', 'respectively', 'are', 'notable', 'changes', 'Zed', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'passed', 'away', 'prior', 'film', 'replaced', 'Agent', 'O', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'complicated', 'history', 'Agent', 'K.', 'When', 'story', 'Agent', 'J', 'back', 'time', 'younger', 'versions', 'O', 'K', 'are', 'placed', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'perfect', 'imitation', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'young', 'Agent', 'K', 'would', 'be', '.The', 'main', 'story', 'deals', 'very', 'lethal', 'alien', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'just', 'Boris', 'being', 'sprung', 'Supermax', 'prison', 'surface', 'moon', 'more', '40', 'years', 'incarceration', 'underground', 'technology', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'prior', 'capture', 'kill', 'young', 'Agent', 'K', 'setting', 'stage', 'species', 'Boglodites', 'invade', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'later.The', 'change', 'timeline', 'everyone', 'not', 'remembering', 'who', 'Agent', 'K', 'other', 'much', 'older', 'agents', 'O', 'somehow', 'J', 'was', 'immune', 'timeline', 'change', 'goal', 'back', 'time', 'save', 'K', 'defeat', 'Boris', 'save', 'Earth', 'Just', 'typical', 'day', 'MIB.The', 'problem', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'riding', 'coattails', 'first', 'using', 'familiarity', 'characters', 'environment', 'substitute', 'actual', 'plot', 'felt', 'way', 'when', 'saw', '2002', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'cable', 'then', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'opinion', 'MIB', '3', 'brought', 'more', 'coherent', 'plot', 'better', 'villains', 'side', 'characters', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'much-needed', 'shot', 'adrenaline', 'led', 'tremendous', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'guarantee', 'MIB', '4']",Men in Black 3

Fast forward 15 years and the chemistry is still sorta there, although any sort of freshness from the writing or basic story has long gone stale.  The first quarter of this newest movie isn't very good - bad jokes, a disinterested Jones (Tommy Lee just there for the check it seems), and a lost looking Smith don't make for cinematic gold.Things do pick up a bit when Josh Brolin (as a younger Tommy Lee) finally arrives on the scene as Smith travels back in time.  These two have more of the chemistry you remember Smith and Jones having in the original.  Brolin's just great as Jones - at times, it's was hard to tell if it was Tommy Lee doing ADR, or just a great impersonation by Brolin (it's all Brolin).Nothing very original about the script and almost every opportunity for some jokes about the racism of the '60's are just passed up.  The only set of jokes based on the fact that Smith is a black super cop from the future are the most obvious kind (he gets pulled over in a stolen car).  Too bad, because with Smith, there could have been some very good BLAZING SADDLES moments - none of which are allowed to happen.As it is, it's kinda cute when they go back to the late 1960's (although the time period actually feels more 1950's), and we get to see Bill Hader as Andy Warhol.  There's a surprising amount of sentimentality near the end of this film - as though Barry Sonnenfeld knows this is the last ride on this particular spaceship - and it proves to be this film's saving grace in what is otherwise a very bland and corporate flick.It's fun enough to check out for MIB fans.BOTTOM LINE:  3 Brolin rules outta 5",3,Brolin rules in this decent 3 try,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,1994,"['Well', 'most', 'MIB', 'clan', 'back', 'together', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'must', 'have', 'lots', 'money', 'wanted', 'too', 'much', '3rd', 'installment', 'now', '15', 'yr-oldish', 'franchise.The', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'goofy', 'hell', 'had', 'lot', 'charm', 'most', 'came', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'chemistry', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'then', 'relatively', 'new', 'big', 'screen', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Fast', 'forward', '15', 'years', 'chemistry', 'still', 'sorta', 'there', 'sort', 'freshness', 'writing', 'basic', 'story', 'long', 'gone', 'stale', 'first', 'quarter', 'newest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'bad', 'jokes', 'disinterested', 'Jones', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'just', 'there', 'check', 'lost', 'looking', 'Smith', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'cinematic', 'gold.Things', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'younger', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'finally', 'scene', 'Smith', 'back', 'time', 'two', 'have', 'more', 'chemistry', 'remember', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'having', 'original', 'Brolin', 'just', 'great', 'Jones', 'times', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'was', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'doing', 'ADR', 'just', 'great', 'impersonation', 'Brolin', 'Brolin', '.Nothing', 'very', 'original', 'script', 'almost', 'opportunity', 'jokes', 'racism', ""'60"", 'are', 'just', 'passed', 'up', 'only', 'set', 'jokes', 'based', 'fact', 'Smith', 'black', 'super', 'cop', 'future', 'are', 'most', 'obvious', 'kind', 'pulled', 'over', 'stolen', 'car', 'Too', 'bad', 'Smith', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'BLAZING', 'SADDLES', 'moments', 'none', 'are', 'allowed', 'happen.As', 'kinda', 'cute', 'when', 'go', 'back', 'late', '1960', 'time', 'period', 'actually', 'more', '1950', 'get', 'see', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'surprising', 'amount', 'sentimentality', 'end', 'film', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'last', 'ride', 'particular', 'spaceship', 'be', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'what', 'otherwise', 'very', 'bland', 'corporate', 'flick.It', 'fun', 'enough', 'check', 'out', 'MIB', 'fans.BOTTOM', 'LINE', '3', 'Brolin', 'rules', 'outta', '5']",Men in Black 3

But when you line the three Men In Black films up next to one another, Men In Black III has certainly surpassed Men in Black II.  While it is not as good as the original, this film can definetly hold its own.  Of course, the highlight of the film was Mr. Josh Brolin, who not only had to step into the enormously large shoes temporarily vacated by Mr. Tommy Lee Jones, but he had to keep his performance as a younger Agent Kay consistent with Mr. Jones's as the latter appeared as the character's older self at the beginning and ending of the film.  Of course, Mr. Brolin did this flawlessly and came off as the perfect younger Tommy Lee Jones while giving the character some perfect qualities we haven't seen before.  Will Smith was back in his own, comfortible shoes, playing Agent Jay and my only complaint there is that we could have done without his rantings during the various neuralizing sessions.  Men in Black and Men in Black II always did those better.  If there was a joke in these new ones, I missed it.  The only one that worked is the one where Jay trickes the 1960s NYPD officers into neuralyzing themselves...that worked perfectly.  I wish I could have seen Rick Torn as Agent Zed again as he too was a classic character, as were Frank the Pug, Jeebs, and the Worm Guys, the last of which we only saw very briefly (too briefly).  But for all my complaining, this film was still awsome.  Jemaine Clement made an excellent villain as Boris the Animal (or ""just Boris"") and I enjoyed the plot twist of ""Andy Warhol"" being an undercover MIB agent.  Had I known the specifics of the powers possessed by Michael Stuhlbarg's character Griffin ahead of time, I would have called them far-fetched even for a Men In Black film.  However, not knowing allowed me to view all that with an unbiased prospective and that made all the difference.  Those powers worked in this plot and Mr. Stuhlbarg was very enjoyable to watch as a being burdened by his ""gift"" and who choices to instead of moarning the loss of his homeworld, help prevent Earth from suffering the same fate.  Also, his nervous ticks and related behavior were amusing at the proper moments.  Overall, any MIB fan should get their hands on this installment and hope for more of this quality in the future.

Smith is put into a giant neural neutralizer and just as he is to get his mind totally erased,Smith finally fesses up.They must both travel to Cape Canaveral in less than six hours and defeat both the older and younger versions of the Bodlidyte.Smith takes on and defeats the present day Boglidydte while Brolin takes on and defeats the 1969 version.Just before lift off Brolin attaches a device called the Arcnet onto the conning tower of the rocket,which will activate a huge shield over the Earth,protecting it from future invasions.Smith,before returning to his proper time,learns a huge secret about his own life and how it relates to Jones.This film just moves constantly,never getting bogged down in too much extraneous side plots.Brolin is nothing short of fantastic as he nailed his part as a younger Tommy Lee Jones.And the end revelation of Smith's real background really takes you by surprise when you first see it,which brings Smith and Tommy Lee's characters into clearer perspective.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There is commentary,a featurette and a gag reel.In conclusion,a wild ride of a film that brings back the original duet of Smith and Jones and adds an even better third element in Brolin.I think it is the best of the franchise so far and look forward to a return of these three characters sometimes in the future.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,The best MIB yet!,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2607,"['Men', 'Black', 'Three', 'released', 'May/12', 'stars', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Agent', 'J', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Agent', 'K', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Young', 'Agent', 'K', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Agent', 'O', 'head', 'MIB', 'bureau', 'many', 'others.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'best', 'franchise', 'yet', 'biggest', 'revelation', 'young', 'Brolin', 'who', 'channels', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'tee.The', 'story', 'last', 'remaining', 'member', 'race', 'killing', 'species', 'Boglidytes', 'who', 'imprisoned', 'moon', 'escaping', 'cell', 'looking', 'revenge.He', 'only', 'one', 'good', 'arm', 'original', 'captor', 'Jones', 'took', 'off', 'apprehending', 'back', '1969', 'launch', 'Apollo', '11.He', 'plans', 'return', '1969', 'kill', 'younger', 'Jones.As', 'Jones', 'sits', 'apartment', 'armed', 'waiting', 'Boglidyte', 'attack', 'suddenly', 'vanishes.The', 'next', 'day', 'Smith', 'up', 'work', 'find', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'drastically.Jones', 'not', 'there', 'fact', 'apparently', 'died', '1969.Smith', 'obtains', 'time', 'travel', 'device', 'alien', 'travels', 'back', '1969', 'order', 'save', 'partner.He', 'up', '1969', 'Coney', 'Island', 'just', 'about', 'get', 'man', 'when', 'arrested', 'Brolin', 'younger', 'Jones', '.Smith', 'telling', 'sorts', 'lies', 'who', 'why', 'there', 'Smith', 'put', 'giant', 'neural', 'neutralizer', 'just', 'get', 'mind', 'totally', 'erased', 'Smith', 'finally', 'up.They', 'must', 'travel', 'Cape', 'Canaveral', 'less', 'six', 'hours', 'defeat', 'older', 'younger', 'versions', 'Bodlidyte.Smith', 'defeats', 'present', 'day', 'Boglidydte', 'Brolin', 'defeats', '1969', 'version.Just', 'lift', 'Brolin', 'device', 'called', 'Arcnet', 'conning', 'tower', 'rocket', 'will', 'activate', 'huge', 'shield', 'Earth', 'protecting', 'future', 'invasions.Smith', 'returning', 'proper', 'time', 'huge', 'secret', 'own', 'life', 'how', 'Jones.This', 'film', 'just', 'constantly', 'never', 'getting', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'extraneous', 'side', 'plots.Brolin', 'nothing', 'short', 'fantastic', 'nailed', 'part', 'younger', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones.And', 'end', 'revelation', 'Smith', 'real', 'background', 'really', 'surprise', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'Smith', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'characters', 'clearer', 'perspective.Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'w/s', 'a/r', '1:85:1', 'clear', 'commentary', 'featurette', 'gag', 'reel.In', 'conclusion', 'wild', 'ride', 'film', 'back', 'original', 'duet', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'even', 'better', 'third', 'element', 'Brolin.I', 'think', 'best', 'franchise', 'so', 'far', 'look', 'forward', 'return', 'three', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'future.4-4', '1/2', 'stars']",Men in Black 3

However, I did something this Memorial Day weekend that I haven't done in over 20 years: I went to the theater twice in 2 days (with my kids) to seeThe Avengersand Men in Black III. And neither of the movies let me down; both were excellent.While The Avengers is getting high marks from the critics, I am very surprised by the so-so reviews that MiB III is getting. I'm glad that I went to the theater, because the abundance of ""just average"" reviews might have even deterred me from putting MiB III in my rental queue. I'm here to say don't be deterred.MiB III was almost as good asthe originalMiB (and the original MiB was classic), and MiB III was better thanMiB II...wayyyy better. The best part for young audiences that may not have seen the predecessors from 15 years and 10 years ago respectively, is that MiB III stands alone as a great movie....There's no need to have had to have seen either of the first two in order to fully enjoy MiB III. Although it does help mainly to see how effectively awesome Josh Brolin is at capturing the essence of Agent K that we all know as Tommy Lee Jones; and I suppose that it also helps to establish the dynamic of the bond between Agent K and Agent J (Will Smith).So MiB III is a fun blast from the past...or should I say blast into the past. In 1969 Agent K maims, arrests and has bad guy Boris the Animal thrown into an intergalactic maximum security prison...on the moon. But 43 years apparently gave Boris a long enough time to figure out how to escape. But escaping is not all that's on Boris' mind; he jumps back in time to 1969 to change history and murder Agent K. So when he succeeds it's up to Agent J (Will Smith) to jump back a little further in time to stop Boris.As I mentioned earlier, Josh Brolin really makes you believe that you're seeing a young Tommy Lee Jones, or should I say young Agent K. The personality differences and dialogue between Brolin and Smith are amusing to watch, and some of Smith's scenes with and without Brolin are out-and-out hilarious.Comedy Writer Etan Cohen (not to be confused with popular Writer/Director Ethan Coen) teams up with MiB veteran Director Barry Sonnenfeld to deliver a movie that's funny, witty and fun for the whole family. At a run time of just over 90 minutes I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.So do indeed get out to see Men in Black III; at minimum get it into your viewing queue. For me, it will be preordered, viewed again on Blu Ray, and sit in my collection next to MiB I & II.",5,Galaxy Defenders,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,2625,"['get', 'out', 'theater', 'see', 'movie', 'once', 'year', ""'m"", 'now', 'slave', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'home', 'entertainment', 'era', 'However', 'did', 'something', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'weekend', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', '20', 'years', 'went', 'theater', 'twice', '2', 'days', 'kids', 'seeThe', 'Avengersand', 'Men', 'Black', 'III', 'movies', 'let', 'down', 'were', 'Avengers', 'getting', 'high', 'marks', 'critics', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'so-so', 'reviews', 'MiB', 'III', 'getting', ""'m"", 'glad', 'went', 'theater', 'abundance', 'just', 'average', 'reviews', 'might', 'have', 'even', 'deterred', 'putting', 'MiB', 'III', 'rental', 'queue', ""'m"", 'here', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deterred.MiB', 'III', 'was', 'almost', 'good', 'asthe', 'originalMiB', 'original', 'MiB', 'was', 'classic', 'MiB', 'III', 'was', 'better', 'thanMiB', 'II', 'wayyyy', 'better', 'best', 'part', 'young', 'audiences', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'predecessors', '15', 'years', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'respectively', 'MiB', 'III', 'alone', 'great', 'movie', 'need', 'have', 'had', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'order', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'MiB', 'III', 'help', 'mainly', 'see', 'how', 'effectively', 'awesome', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'capturing', 'essence', 'Agent', 'K', 'know', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'suppose', 'also', 'establish', 'dynamic', 'bond', 'Agent', 'K', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', '.So', 'MiB', 'III', 'fun', 'blast', 'past', 'should', 'say', 'blast', 'past', '1969', 'Agent', 'K', 'maims', 'arrests', 'bad', 'guy', 'Boris', 'Animal', 'thrown', 'intergalactic', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'moon', '43', 'years', 'apparently', 'gave', 'Boris', 'long', 'enough', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'escape', 'escaping', 'not', 'Boris', 'mind', 'back', 'time', '1969', 'change', 'history', 'murder', 'Agent', 'K.', 'So', 'when', 'up', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'jump', 'back', 'little', 'further', 'time', 'stop', 'Boris.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'really', 'believe', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'young', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'should', 'say', 'young', 'Agent', 'K.', 'personality', 'differences', 'dialogue', 'Brolin', 'Smith', 'are', 'amusing', 'watch', 'Smith', 'scenes', 'Brolin', 'are', 'out-and-out', 'hilarious.Comedy', 'Writer', 'Etan', 'Cohen', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'popular', 'Writer/Director', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'up', 'MiB', 'veteran', 'Director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'deliver', 'movie', 'funny', 'witty', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'run', 'time', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'start', 'finish.So', 'do', 'indeed', 'get', 'out', 'see', 'Men', 'Black', 'III', 'minimum', 'get', 'viewing', 'queue', 'will', 'be', 'preordered', 'viewed', 'again', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'sit', 'collection', 'MiB', 'II']",Men in Black 3

Mcmahon ""deal hunter""","[1, 1]","You know, the only way this could have been better is if Michael Jackson were still alive and costarred in this movie as Agent M. But since that's not possible, I guess this is still a pretty cool movie. I gave it 5 stars because they've saved the galaxy from the bugs in the last one, and hell, if I saved a galaxy from a race of giant cockroaches, I'd perhaps want 5 stars too, even if the stars are being applied to a newer movie without a galaxy that needs saving from the race of giant bugs.Let's take a second to mention Prime and Amazon's streaming. I'm an Apple/ iOS guy, and most of my electronics are Apple. I'm also a Prime member and enjoy streaming my Prime subscription on my iPad, my Mac Book Pro, even occasionally my iPhone as well as through my game consoles and Apple TV onto my HDTVs. Amazon makes the process very very simple. You just download the app and use it to store your downloaded movies or to stream free, rented or purchased movies. Because I can use Amazon movies, shows, all video on my iPad, I'm happy to check between Amazon and Apple when I'm interested in purchasing or renting a movie. I like the ability to check between different streaming apps and get the best deal offered.The other little perk which has been popping up on Amazon Prime a lot is the free credit for slow shipping perk. Amazon sometime offers Prime customers who choose it a credit to be applied to video or tv streaming purchases and downloads. For example, I purchased quite a few things during Christmas. I no longer worry about buying my Amazon stuff in one &#34;shopping trip&#34;  since I have Prime. So I may place 12 orders over the course of a couple of weeks. On the orders that would be eligible for 2 day free shipping with Prime, I've been offered a credit if I choose the standard 4 or more days shipping. You know, the one that historically they've always said would be almost 2 weeks but arrives in like 3 days usually. That one. On stuff I wasn't worried about getting quickly I would do it. I racked up $6 in a couple of weeks and used those credits to buy a movie about some aliens that hang out on the Earth with The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Loretta Lynn's husband.

It's based on a comic book, Jones and Smith (or should that be Smith and Jones?) are excellent and excellent together, and the first two movies were just so much fun. Say what you want about the second; it was still a lot of fun, and I like it. So do my kids. Well, MiB3 did not disappoint.Smith and Jones were just as excellent as they always are, but it was Josh Brolin that really stole the show. He was amazing! He was as much Agent K as Tommy Lee Jones was. I mean, my kids thought it was some kind CGI magic and didn't realize that it was some other actor playing the character until we told them. That's some amazing stuff right there, and the movie is worth seeing just for his performance. Facial expressions, voice, everything.It was nice to see Emma Thompson in the movie, also, although I was disappointed by the lack of Rip Torn as Zed. Of course, there was also Will Arnett in a small but hilarious role. He's great in those kind of walk on parts. And there was Bill Hader who is also just SO funny, and just the fact that he was playing Andy Warhol was a laugh all by itself.On top of the great acting, the story was well done. The time travel stuff was handled well, and that's always an issue with any movie with time travel. And there was an emotional aspect to this one that was really lacking in the other two, and that was fabulous. It actually, literally, brought tears to my eyes, and, when a movie can bring tears to my eyes, well, that's saying something for the movie.If you haven't seen Men in Black 3, you should definitely take the time to do it.

1472612,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B005LAIHQS,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[99, 119]","After the apocalypse of Independence Day and the epics of Star Wars and Star Trek, the sci-fi field was ripe for a spoof. Men in Black was the DEFINITIVE spoof of the sci-fi genre when it came out, an entertaining balance of light-hearted drama, action, and wacky comedy. The sequel...wasn't quite on the same level of film-making, lacking a smart script, and showing just what happens when Sonnenfeld gets carried away with drenching his stars in colored goo. And now act three rolls out and we have...""I promised the secrets of the universe, nothing more.""After the insanity of the previous two Men in Black movies, everything moves in a different direction this time around...fourth dimensionally. When I heard that this movie would be all about time travel, and when I heard that the script was generated in a huge rush so that they could get the movie out on time, I expected the worst. I was VERY pleasantly surprised this time around. The basic plot revolves around an evil alien who sets out for vengeance on K using time travel to erase him, so that he simultaneously kills his nemesis and sets in motion the destruction of Earth in the present. A simple premise, but the execution of said premise SHINES.""Here, take this, and all you have to do is jump.""From the get-go this movie has fun with all the old and new sci-fi tropes. J has to time jump by literally jumping off a building (Girl Who Leapt Through Time anyone?) in a great super-cartoony CGI sequence that I'm SURE would have been awesome to see in 3D. When he actually gets to 1969 there's everything from a GIANT neutralizer that doesn't quite look safe, to new gadgets that result in some awesome action sequences (unicycle speeders and rocket packs). And naturally all the typical 1960's stereotypes are toyed and joked with, but in most cases this is very well done, while at the same time giving us subtle clues into the nature of K and his relationships through a new perspective.""I am getting too old for this. I can only imagine how YOU feel.""It cannot be overstated how PERFECT Josh Brolin is as young K. He manages to be super-serious in that Jack Webb style while simultaneous displaying the same chemistry with Will Smith's agent K. He delivers his lines with perfect comic timing, and gives his character a lot of heart. Will Smith might be sleep-walking through the role, but he's got some GREAT lines this time around, and it's obvious he's having a great time with the role. The rest of the cast likewise does a great job with their roles, and keeps things light-hearted and fun (with only a few dead gags here and there).""Do you know what is the most destructive power in the universe?"" ""Sugar?""This movie is big, bright, and beautiful. It was clearly designed to be viewed in IMAX 3D and it shows. Everything is just so vivid and well-framed, and crystal clear. It really makes a nice change from the very darkly lit and darkly framed films that have been popular the past few years. And as my wife commented to me right after the movie finished, most movies are SUPPOSED to be fun, light, and leave you feeling good when you exit the theater. They are supposed to ENTERTAIN you (at least that's the lesson I got from Sullivan's Travels, your mileage may vary). There's room for every kind of movie, but this kind does what movies were meant to do in the first place. MIBIII is FUN, and it has a lot of heart. The end of the movie really and truly surprised me. The climax of the time travel plot results in a plot revelation that was not only NOT stupid, but actually was heart-warming (giving you a HUGE character development twist on K that I never saw coming). That's just plain good film making. Not to mention awesome little surprises that are purely the result of good writing (an accidental time jump turning the tables on a one-sided fight) and excellent direction.""You got some city miles on you.""Some people might start watching this movie feeling like I did, that the franchise was really looking like it was running out of gas. I was thrilled to find that MIBIII is now my favorite film the series. It's a great comedy with wonderful comic timing, a great adventure with lots of great action sequences, and its got more character, charm, and heart than anything else in the series yet. I will definitely buy it when it comes out on Blu-Ray and would recommend any fans of the series do the same.",5,"""That's not the lie you told me when you recruited me!

Best of all Men in Black 3 (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) revealed Agent K to be a real stand up guy.  This will have to be one of my shortest reviews because; I simply do not want to give away any of the plot in the movie since I enjoyed it so much I won't spoil it for others.  I will say the picture and sound quality of the blue ray was excellent.  As we all know just because; the format is blue ray does not mean the video transfer is always first rate.  In this case the video transfer resulted in a crisp clear transfer where the colors were alive and vibrant.  I watched the movie on a 55 inch screen at 240 MHz refresh rate and the movie was just awesome.  The acting was awesome.  The dialogue was snappy.

Almost all trilogies seem to follow this format, but Men In Black has always played by a different set of rules and as it turns out, the third film was far and away the best of the trilogy. In this installment of MIB, the notorious Boris The Animals escapes from his prison on the Moon. This is significant, because putting Boris away is what made Agent K's career and cost Boris an arm. Boris, determined to change things, goes back in the past to kill K. Once he does, everything descends into chaos and the Earth is at risk, so Agent J, goes back in time to stop him. Once in 1969, J enters into a strange new world where he sees that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Josh Brolin plays the younger K and is absolutely terrific, it was amazing and hysterical how he captures and mimics every single one of Tommy Lee Jones mannerisms to a tee. Will Smith is his usual self, with his quick one liners and terrific actions scenes, he hasn't missed a beat, even all these years later. For as good as the acting in this film was, the story is even better. Watching this film it's hard to believe the story is based on a comic book, because the writing really was tremendous. They took a step back and show what MIB and it's agents were like 40 years ago, at the very beginning and it was really interesting to see. Men In Black 3 is far and away the best of the trilogy and one of Will Smith's best films in years.

To set the course of time back into the original, Agent J also time-travels back to 1969, to prevent the criminal alien from murdering K. It's a pretty typical storyline, but still acceptable.In ""Men in Black 3"" you don't see Tommy Lee Jones (second-billed) very much. Josh Brolin plays the younger (and more emotional) version of Agent K, and his portrayal of the character is spot-on. Jemaine Clement as Boris effectively manages to balance between a deadly enemy and silly villain. But sorry, no talking pug this time.The story of ""Men in Black 3"" takes mostly in 1969, which means jokes often rely on cultural references from the time. Some of them work, like the one about Andy Warhol and his famous soup can, but most of them are not particularly great. What is worse is the thin story that is not very interesting, except the final 20 minutes, where we are finally reminded that the film was about time-travelling.It took five years for them to make a sequel to ""Men in Black."" Then it took ten years to make another sequel. Will Smith looks old, and so does Tommy Lee Jones. It's inevitable, as the first one was made about 15 years ago. I know the magic of the original is gone forever. ""Men in Black 3"" is amusing, but I still don't know why this has to be made after 15 years.",3,"Fine Acting, A Few Nice Jokes, and Weak Storyline (Except the Last Act)",1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,1430,"['Animal', 'vengeful', 'alien', 'grudge', 'Agent', 'K', 'prison', 'moon', 'back', 'time', 'kill', 'young', 'Agent', 'K.', 'set', 'course', 'time', 'back', 'original', 'Agent', 'J', 'also', 'back', '1969', 'prevent', 'criminal', 'alien', 'murdering', 'K.', 'pretty', 'typical', 'storyline', 'still', 'acceptable.In', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'second-billed', 'very', 'much', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'younger', 'more', 'emotional', 'version', 'Agent', 'K', 'portrayal', 'character', 'spot-on', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'Boris', 'effectively', 'balance', 'deadly', 'enemy', 'silly', 'villain', 'sorry', 'talking', 'pug', 'time.The', 'story', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'mostly', '1969', 'jokes', 'often', 'rely', 'cultural', 'references', 'time', 'work', 'one', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'famous', 'soup', 'can', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'What', 'worse', 'thin', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'where', 'are', 'finally', 'reminded', 'film', 'was', 'time-travelling.It', 'took', 'five', 'years', 'make', 'sequel', 'Men', 'Black', 'Then', 'took', 'ten', 'years', 'make', 'sequel', 'Will', 'Smith', 'old', 'so', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'inevitable', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'made', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'know', 'magic', 'original', 'gone', 'forever', 'Men', 'Black', '3', 'amusing', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'be', 'made', '15', 'years']",Men in Black 3
1472677,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B005LAIHQS,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[1, 2]","Is the third of a series a sequel or a threequel? And does a threequel have to be bad, especially if the sequel disappointed?In this time line and reality (you have to see MIB III to get the joke I just made), MIB III is definitely a hit and does not disappoint. It exceeded all my expectations and that's my favorite reality of all. (again, you have to see MIB III to get my joke). We need some history to understand why.My History with MIB:I was captivated by the original Men In Black. The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jone as K and Will Smith as J was remarkable, and the story line was tremendous fun. Here was a sci-fi adventure with lots of fancy looking gadgets, insanely complex aliens, a nasty yet hysterical villain, a ton of comedy and a happy ending -- proving that a sci-fi movie doesn't have to be all doom and gloom, horror, gore, and filled with pessimistic technobabble about the hopelessness of the future, or endless wars with evil slimy aliens intent on destroying humanity, with the humans only winning at a tremendous cost.  Here, humanity was the good guys and we won. It was brilliant.I wasn't so excited by the sequel, MIB II. The chemistry between Jones and Smith was still there, the aliens were there, as were the fancy gadgets and sets, but it just didn't quite come off for me. It seemed, well, tired. The ending wasn't so happy, and though there were jokes a plenty, it had a much darker mood than the original. It was the lightness of the original that made it for me. The sequel seemed too forced and was just not that great.Happily, along comes the threequel, MIB III, and it has it all again. In some ways, it's the best of the lot.Why I enjoyed it so much:Will Smith is again brilliant as J. He had kept in-character throughout the series and delivers his lines spot on. The jokes are fast and furious, and his expressions and body language are wonderful to watch. He makes the character fun.Tommy Lee Jones reprises his role as K, and like Smith is very consistent. He's also a delight, and as sour as K ever was, but in this film, we find out why. He's not on screen that much, but when he is, he's great. Now he has some serious competition!A few ""newcomers"" appear who are definitely worth mentioning.Emma Thompson as O, the new leader after Z has passed on (we don't know why he died) is excellent as a leader of the MIB. She's always just plain fun to watch. Her character is quick, and just a bit silly.Josh Brolin appears as the younger K (yes, this film is all about time travel and paradoxes, it can make your head spin) and carries the role off by making it his own. To be honest, I didn't know the full cast when I started watching and was partly convinced that Brolin was actually Pierce Brosnan (they look a little alike and some of Brolin's mannerisms reminded me of him). Brolin's K is a much more approachable agent of the MIB, just as funny and wise as Jone's K, but in a more human way. He's also just plain fun to watch. It looks like he's enjoying the part he plays.Michael Stuhlbarg almost steals the show as Griffin, the friendly alien who can see all possible futures and works with K and J to stop the villain and save the day (and the Earth from invasion). He is so animated, his eyes are so bright and his facial expressions are so open... he's an easy candidate for my favorite alien. Great actor.While it's easy to like the ""good guys"", they won't stand out much as characters unless they are up against a read baddie. And this MIB has a villain even more amazing than the original MIB I (remember the cockroach guy, hysterical but also menacing)?Hats off to Jemaine Clement as Boris, The Animal (actually a sort of hybrid of several alien animals in one body). He's really scary and dangerous, bent on destruction - not a complex villain with angst, he just wants to change history so his race can invade and eat the Earth - and he's pretty much unstoppable.So here we have a great cast (there are others to mention, I didn't see any performance I didn't like). Do we have a great story?The Story:I can't put in any spoilers here, it would not be fair. Suffice it to say that while the story uses a number of tried and true sci-fi cliche's, it does it with a freshness that is brilliant. They put in just the right twists on the tried and true, spin it in a different direction that it kept me on my toes while watching the film, guessing, but never correctly, what was going on or what would happen next. The script and writing on this movie is top notch.There are jokes a plenty as one would expect, and they come fast and furious. I had to rewind and watch several segments repeatedly to savor them all.A few things about the story really stand out. They manage to get suspense not only because of the plot twists, but also from some extremely uncomfortable (for me anyway) visual effects.If you get an adrenalin rush from very high places without a net, you'll love some of the scenes in this movie. How they filmed it has me wondering! This makes not only are some of the alien bits ""edge of your seat"" stuff, but also some of the action sequences -- just what you'd want in an action adventure. And they don't look faked, at least, not to me! Using height to excite the audience is nothing new, but this movie does it with more of a roller coaster effect.The script is also very strong on heart.As one character says to J (I paraphrase here) ""You must really love the guy to go through this for him"". And that's what we get a lot of in this movie - heart. J is devoted to K as his partner. He's got his back and will do anything for him. More than that, the younger K is open to J's devotion and accepts it without curmudgeon (as we expect from the older K). But he also is a hero and must do what he must do, in spite of the risks. He can't let J's devotion stop him from fulfilling his destiny. The relationship is very touching.Griffin, the alien, brings a sense of wisdom to all the adventure. He delivers some very wonderful lines, memorable and touching.There is nothing particularly shocking in the film, just great suspense and action, plenty of surprises and the greatest surprise comes at the end of the movie.The writers set us up for one ""reality"", but what plays out is something completely different, totally unexpected, and so amazingly well done that it ties up the entire K-J relationship together in a single, poignant scene. Everything makes sense, but it comes at a surprising cost for the characters, and our emotions.Sets and Scenery:MIB III delivers here as well, with some oddities.The set for the MIB HQ in our present day has been upgraded. Unfortunately, the HQ now looks like it was designed by APPLE engineers. Everything is white, silver and glass with very little color anywhere. Yes, this contrasts with the ""black"" of Men In Black, but I would have enjoyed the HQ being less ""Applish"". Apple is a great company, but why does it have to be imitated in so many sci-fi movies (i.e. Star Trek, the alternate Enterprise bridge)?Nevertheless there are a few sight gags in the sets. For example, look closely at O's office. I don't want to give the joke away, but most of the time, we see it in parts, an edge here, an interior shot there, bits and pieces of it. However, when J leaves it to start on his rescue of K, the camera backs off enough that we see the entire office and its shape. That shape will look very familiar. Hint: This is a movie about aliens in more ways than one!The MIB HQ in the past (1969) is a great homage to architect Frank Lloyd Wright. To get that, you have to look at images of the interior layout of the Johnson Wax building that Wright designed.That's an interesting view, but there is a huge joke in the HQ as well. To get it, you have to have seen MIB I and remember where the cockroach's escape spaceship comes from. In a very quick pan of the MIB HQ of 1969, you'll see it again as the camera makes a pan across the room.Conclusion:MIB III is an unexpected delight. It has everything I want in a lighthearted and entertaining sci-fi movie. The acting is brilliant, the writing and sets... well, let's just say I thought the whole thing was brilliant. Entertaining, engrossing, kept me guessing, and it has just the right touch of heart to make it a ""I'm really glad I saw it."" movie.And a note about Amazon.I watched this on Amazon Instant Video as a 24 hour rental based on a Christmas gift certificate I received.Once again, Amazon comes through with an easy purchase. I simply found the movie, applied my gift certificate code, and was even able to download MIB III temporarily to my PC (so it would play more smoothly.)I was even able to watch some of it as it was downloading (on my computer this caused a bit of jerkiness, which is to be expected, my computer is an older model). Picture quality was excellent and it played very well once fully downloaded.So hats off toe Amazon for their process in being able to ""rent a movie"".And hats off to MIB III for being a great $3.99 rental.Money well spent.

1472678,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B005LAIHQS,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","The original MEN IN BLACK was memorable because it was a quirky sci-fi movie that had just the right balance of comedy and action. MEN IN BLACK 2 followed in that same vein, but the film wasn't as strong and felt more like a retread. MEN IN BLACK 2 was released in 2002 and a decade later (due to script issues, scheduling conflicts, and budget problems), the boys are back in MEN IN BLACK 3 and while the film isn't as funny as the original, it's a far superior film to MEN IN BLACK 2.The film begins on the lunar prison base, a maximum security facility that was specifically designed to hold Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement who seems to be channeling Tim Curry), the last member of a species of creatures that's sole purpose was destroying and devouring other civilizations. Boris has been in prison for forty years and what he really wants is to travel back through time and kill the man responsible for his imprisonment and the loss of his arm: Agent K. Through some stealth planning, Boris escapes.Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) still work for the top-secret organization that protects the Earth from intergalactic threats. Events during the past few days convince K that Boris is out to kill him. While that's true, K is mistaken on just when Boris plans to commit his crime. After fighting Boris, K & J have an argument of sorts. The next morning, J awakens and discovers that all signs of K have been erased. He soon learns that K was killed forty years earlier. J has to travel back through time to 1969 and prevent the younger K (Josh Brolin) from being killed.There will be some who will be disappointed by MEN IN BLACK 3 because though there are plenty of jokes and lots of humor, the film isn't as funny as the original film. However, what makes the movie a better film that MEN IN BLACK 2 is the characterization and a script full of pathos, not to mention plenty of action.MEN IN BLACK 3 focuses on the relationship between K & J. The chemistry between the characters is the main reason that MEN IN BLACK was so successful; the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was a great casting move. That chemistry remains and is just as strong between Smith and Josh Brolin. However, MEN IN BLACK 3 examines why that chemistry works. Though it sacrifices some of the comedy, I enjoyed the overall emotional tone of the movie. The MEN IN BLACK movies have always been fun, but MEN IN BLACK 3 provides the series with a heart and stable emotional core.Besides Smith and Jones who are excellent as usual, Josh Brolin should be commended for his fine work as a younger Agent K. Brolin is a great actor. I've been impressed with him time and time again since first seeing him in THE GOONIES. His resemblance to Tommy Lee Jones is uncanny. Also notable in the movie is the portrayal of Michael Stuhlbarg as the last of another alien species who is capable of existing in multiple dimensions of space and time at the same time.MEN IN BLACK 3 isn't as funny or action-packed as MEN IN BLACK, but it is a far superior movie than MEN IN BLACK 2.

1472699,A2ZFHK015YXP6U,B005LAIHQS,Wild1138,"[2, 4]","Let's be honest, the first Men in Black was FANTASTIC! It was something new, unique, funny, and had some action. Positive reviews and a strong box office later, it was pretty obvious it would get a sequal. Unfortunately, everything that I loved about the first Men in Black was pretty much ruined in the second.Moving on, 10 or so years later we get, surprisingly, a third entry in the series. As long as this one was better than the second, I would be fine. And fortunately, this was a BIG improvement!So, MIB3 starts off with a MIB ""alien prison"" on the moon, and one of the prisoners, a crime lord named Borris the animal, escapes seeking revenge against agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) who is the man that took Borris down. Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and K are dealing with normal ""MIB"" matters on earth, however, Borris breaks into another facility, and uses a special ""time travel"" device and goes back in time to 1969 and kills the young agent K (Josh Brolin). This erases our modern agent K from existance, and the world has completely changed. An alien invasion is now spreading across earth, and the world is pretty much facing an apocalypse. Agent J, however, is the only person who seems to remember the existance of old ""Tommy Lee"" agent K. So, Agent J then gets a hold of the ""time travel"" device and goes bak to 1969 as well, to stop Borris the animal from killing the young K (if anyone thinks that was confusing, don't worry, you should follow it pretty well while watching the movie, just don't think about it too hard.)The POSITIVES:-None of the scripts in these movies have been that spectacular, and this one is pretty much on par with the first two.-The special effects and action never dissapoint! This one easily has the best action of the trilogy (and a VERY entertaining climax!).-The sets and costumes are fantastic. The most interesting parts (for me) was the middle, where a large part of the film takes place in 1969, and the setup in this time period is really entertaining to watch.-The acting is great, each player does their part well, especially our three leading men.-Alot of people have complained about the ending plot twist, saying it is ""illogical"" or ""unnecessary"", but come on, it's MIB we are talking about here. It was still emotional, and well done. And you shouldn't bother scratching your head over this, considering how confusing the time travel aspect of the the plot is.-A specific actor, to note, is Josh Brolin as Young agent K. He gives an AMAZING performance as K, and gives an oscar worthy impersination of a young Tommy Lee.The NEGATIVES:-When it comes to the time travel element, there are too many things that you are forced to question, and really should have been explained better. Specifically, after old agent K is wiped from existance, they never really tell you WHY agent J remembers agent K's existance while everyone else does not. They do briefly explain how, but they don't give you a full explanation, and it would have been nice if they took an extra 5 minutes to help explain this stuff to the audience. Another thing to add: If old K is wiped from existance, then how is agent J even an agent at all? In the original MIB, old K personally recruits J. There is a scene at the end of the movie where you might get an idea at how J still ends up becoming an agent, but it still isn't quite enough. Point is, the movie needed an extra 5 minutes of dialogue to help explain the time travel element, so you aren't left scratching your head.-The comedy. Specifically, the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are too many skits that just don't work. Quite frankly, there are 1 or 2 scenes where I was questioning walking out of the theater or not. Sure, the scenes with Will Smith and Tommy Lee are great (they continue to work great together) but it's nothing we havn't seen before. After the first 20 minutes or so, the humor started to get funny, and although there are still a few later parts that fall flat, they don't last long and the movie moves on pretty quickly.-The music isn't very good at all. The majority of the film was OK, but the theme at the beginning was TERRIBLE! What was even more dissapointing was the fact that I LOVED the music in the trailers, but I was NOT pleasently surprised when I found out none of the trailer music is actually used in the movie. And I was shocked when I found out Danny Elfman did the music. I love most of his work, but he seriously droped the ball with this movie.-Agent J. If there is one good thing to say about MIB2, it's agent J's character. Sure, he was still that same kid, BUT, he had definately matured greatly. In MIB3, however, Will Smith is still trying to be that same goofy kid from the first movie. In this he is over 40, so it just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want him to be a mature strict K, but I just wanted to see his character developed more. However, we do get a great emotinal scene with J in the end, which worked really well for the character, so that was cool. And im NOT saying anything bad about Will Smith (who gives a great performance as always) I just didn't like how he was written in the first two thirds of the film.Overall, MIB3 is a fun ride. Sure, it's not NEARLY as good as the original MIB (which was an instant classic), BUT, this is a GREAT improvement over MIB2, and overall, is still a good movie. If you liked the original MIB, you should have fun with this, just don't expect TOO much from it.

And while Will Smith doesn't drive me nuts like some actors do (coughTomCruisecoughSethRogencough), I don't go out of my way to see every film he's in. Still, Tommy Lee Jones is always fun in anything he does, so...I was surprised that the film exceeded my expectations. A cranky alien escapes prison on the Moon, heads to Earth, and goes back in time to kill Agent K and make it possible for his race to invade the planet in the current day. Agent J follows him back, meeting the younger version of his partner, played by Josh Brolin.Jones' role in this film is more or less an extended cameo, while Smith is somewhat a fish out of water in the earlier time frame. The film starts off a bit slow, a story by numbers perhaps, which quickly changes once Agent J goes back in time. The story picks up pace, and Brolin as the young Agent K is uncanny in the role, playing the character as grumpy as Jones, but still giving new nuances to the character. Brolin was a mostly obscure actor for years, but in recent years is rightfully getting attention as his potential as an actor is being put to good use. The story ties into the moon launch mission, which provides for some unexpected laughs, and the CGI mostly works well.And oddly enough, a supporting character, an alien who can see potential outcomes of most any situation, provides some of the most poignant and funny moments of the film.If you were disappointed in the second film, give this one a try.",4,Better Than Expected,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,1589,"['missed', 'one', 'theatres', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'wondered', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'Will', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'drive', 'nuts', 'actors', 'do', 'coughTomCruisecoughSethRogencough', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'way', 'see', 'film', 'Still', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'always', 'fun', 'anything', 'was', 'surprised', 'film', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'cranky', 'alien', 'escapes', 'prison', 'Moon', 'Earth', 'back', 'time', 'kill', 'Agent', 'K', 'make', 'possible', 'race', 'invade', 'planet', 'current', 'day', 'Agent', 'J', 'back', 'meeting', 'younger', 'version', 'partner', 'played', 'Josh', 'Brolin.Jones', 'role', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'extended', 'cameo', 'Smith', 'somewhat', 'fish', 'water', 'earlier', 'time', 'frame', 'film', 'bit', 'slow', 'story', 'numbers', 'perhaps', 'quickly', 'once', 'Agent', 'J', 'back', 'time', 'story', 'up', 'pace', 'Brolin', 'young', 'Agent', 'K', 'uncanny', 'role', 'playing', 'character', 'as', 'grumpy', 'Jones', 'still', 'giving', 'new', 'nuances', 'character', 'Brolin', 'was', 'mostly', 'obscure', 'actor', 'years', 'recent', 'years', 'rightfully', 'getting', 'attention', 'potential', 'actor', 'being', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'story', 'ties', 'moon', 'launch', 'mission', 'unexpected', 'laughs', 'CGI', 'mostly', 'well.And', 'oddly', 'enough', 'supporting', 'character', 'alien', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'potential', 'outcomes', 'most', 'situation', 'most', 'poignant', 'funny', 'moments', 'film.If', 'were', 'disappointed', 'second', 'film', 'give', 'one', 'try']",Men in Black 3

MIB 2 followed fairly predictably. It worked, but sequel-slump had set in. So, in deference to the memory of MIB 1, I saw this - but didn't get my hopes up too far.As a result, the humor and especially the warmth of this one took me pleasantly by surprise. Given the time-travel theme, it's both a sequel to the others and a prequel. (Josh Broslin, by the way, does a flawless job as the 1960s K.) Saying more would say too much, so let's leave the plot description there - suffice it to say that it's a lot more touching that I had any reason to expect, and a lot more explanatory.Additional characters worked well this time. Emma Thompson's ""Agent O"" character echoed Dame Dench's ""M"" from the recent Bond flicks, but that throat-scraping introduction set a whole different mood. And, speaking as life-long nerd, Griffin just charmed me. Maybe not one for the ages, this is still a great restart of the franchise, but also very watchable in itself.

1472717,AP3B615GM191G,B005LAIHQS,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 3]","The first two ""Men In Black"" movies were successful because of a simple Hollywood ""formula"": fun.  By combining goofy aliens, cool gadgets, great acting, funny sight gags, wise-cracking humor, and enough of a plot to actually make you care about all that is transpiring, those movies were so genre-diverse that one almost can't help but find something to like.  After a ten year break from the action, however, there was no guarantee that the lightning could be caught in the bottle once again for MIB3.  Luckily, this film not only proves itself worthy, but actually clocks in as the best installment in the series to date.For a basic plot summary, MIB3 sees a rogue alien escape from captivity and, through time-travel, wreak havoc on the MIB organization by causing Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) to no longer exist.  As such, Agent J (Will Smith) must travel back to 1969 in order to set things straight, along the way meeting up with the younger K (Josh Brolin).Like its predecessors, this movie is just pure fun, through and through.  The time spent watching it will fly by (no boredom here!) as every scene contains some interesting nugget, whether comically, emotionally, or just plain exciting.  Essentially, MIB3 is the perfect balance between ""summer popcorn flick"" & ""film series you truly care about"".  While humor, action, and adventure are present throughout the film, the ending of the movie even takes an emotionally-charged tone that will likely have you completely stunned and perhaps even pulling out a tissue or two.Of course, the acting within this film is probably what truly makes it a great experience, though.  Will Smith slips effortlessly into his old ""black suit"" role, while Brolin is spot-on as the young K.  Jones is, well, pretty much the same old Jones, but with an added character twist that really does help explain his character's gruff exterior.Simply put, MIB3 vaults this trilogy into serious consideration when considering the ""greatest trilogies of all time"" debate.  It is pure fun, but with enough emotion to make you care about the characters.

Boris the alien gets creepier as the movie goes along. Kudos to the CGI people for incorporating the eewww factor. Josh Brolin gives a stellar performance as K the Younger.
