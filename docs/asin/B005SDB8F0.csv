1502111,ATYTXN352VQ8F,B005SDB8F0,chainlink,"[1, 1]","Years ago in Sunday school I would often hear, as one of those folk-theodicies that crop up all the time in Sunday schools, that suffering can be seen to have a divine purpose if it is correctly contextualized. It is actually a refiner's fire, purifying those lucky enough to have God apply it to them, since by its application God melts out of us the dross of egotism and the illusions of power and control that we, in our ignorance and feeblenes tend to cultivate in the absence of pain, and teaches us empathy, since it is self-evident that all sufferers are brothers, whatever else divides them.Thinking about it later, I decided that this scenario overlooked other possibilities. Those who have suffered could learn bitterness intead of compassion, I thought, becoming in the process more, not less self-absorbed. Or they might come to feel, even without actual bitterness, that since they had suffered and survived (or not, in which case nothing at all is learned), others would no doubt have the same experience: suffering really doesn't matter much in the long run--especially that of somebody else.""Rapt"" brought these old reflections back to mind--the result was that the film came, toward the end, to seem comfortably familiar to me, despite the fact that I had been wondering during most of its length just what was on its mind, as it were. It isn't, as has been pointed out, really a thriller, despite the fact that it's about a brutal crime. It isn't a police procedural, despite the fact that much time is spent on the police response to it.None of the emotional responses that we've been prepared by the genres of ""crime film"" to feel are called upon here--I wondered for awhile if the kidnap victim was to be seen as one of those powerless trapped-by-fate types familiar from film noir, despite his having millions. But no: our guy isn't just ground up in the gears of things. ""Rapt"" ends up being in effect a character study, showing how suffering and the complete loss of control affects one accustomed to power. It seems to me a) quite plausible for the reasons I outlined above, and b) maybe a little bit infected by a propaganda motive in a political moment in which we of the ""99%"" are feeling a little self-righteous.",5,The French do genre films very well--but don't expect this to be one of them.,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2241,"['Years', 'ago', 'Sunday', 'school', 'would', 'often', 'hear', 'one', 'folk-theodicies', 'crop', 'time', 'Sunday', 'schools', 'suffering', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'have', 'divine', 'purpose', 'correctly', 'contextualized', 'actually', 'refiner', 'fire', 'purifying', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'God', 'apply', 'application', 'God', 'dross', 'egotism', 'illusions', 'power', 'control', 'ignorance', 'feeblenes', 'tend', 'cultivate', 'absence', 'pain', 'teaches', 'empathy', 'self-evident', 'sufferers', 'are', 'brothers', 'else', 'them.Thinking', 'later', 'decided', 'scenario', 'overlooked', 'other', 'possibilities', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'could', 'learn', 'bitterness', 'intead', 'compassion', 'thought', 'becoming', 'process', 'more', 'not', 'less', 'self-absorbed', 'might', 'come', 'feel', 'even', 'actual', 'bitterness', 'had', 'suffered', 'survived', 'not', 'case', 'nothing', 'learned', 'others', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'have', 'same', 'experience', 'suffering', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'long', 'run', 'especially', 'somebody', 'else', 'Rapt', 'brought', 'old', 'reflections', 'back', 'mind', 'result', 'was', 'film', 'came', 'end', 'seem', 'comfortably', 'familiar', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'wondering', 'most', 'length', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'mind', 'were', ""n't"", 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'really', 'thriller', 'fact', 'brutal', 'crime', ""n't"", 'police', 'procedural', 'fact', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'police', 'response', 'it.None', 'emotional', 'responses', ""'ve"", 'been', 'prepared', 'genres', 'crime', 'film', 'feel', 'are', 'called', 'here', 'wondered', 'awhile', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'was', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'powerless', 'trapped-by-fate', 'types', 'familiar', 'film', 'noir', 'having', 'millions', 'guy', ""n't"", 'just', 'ground', 'up', 'gears', 'things', 'Rapt', 'up', 'being', 'effect', 'character', 'study', 'showing', 'how', 'suffering', 'complete', 'loss', 'control', 'one', 'accustomed', 'power', 'quite', 'plausible', 'reasons', 'outlined', 'b', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'infected', 'propaganda', 'motive', 'political', 'moment', '99', '%', 'are', 'feeling', 'little', 'self-righteous']",Rapt
1502112,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005SDB8F0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","A stunning thriller from filmmaker Lucas Belvaux that will leave you shocked and surprise of how things develop from beginning to end.""Rapt"" is a 2009 film written by Lucas Belvaux, who is best known for ""La riason du plus faible"" (2006) and ""The Trilogy"" films (""On the Run"", ""An Amazing Couple"" and ""After the Life"") of 2002.  Inspired by the real life kidnapping of Baron &Eacute;douard-Jean Empain, a French-Belgian industrialist and CEO of the Schneider Group.The winner of two Cesar Awards for Best Director and Best Film, ""Rapt"" would star Yvan Attal (""Rush Hour 3', ""My Wife is an Actress"", ""The Interpreter""), Anne Consigny (""A Christmas Tale"", ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"", ""Mesrine: Public Enemy #1') and Andre Marcon (""The Page Turner"", ""Les Destinees"").VIDEO:""Rapt"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  For those who are familiar with Kino Lorber's Blu-ray release, this is not a company that does a lot of fixing up of the original print.  They present a film in High Definition without too much interference when it comes to fixing any deficiencies, and if the quality is not up to their standard, they will not release it.The good news is that ""Rapt"" is one of the films released on Blu-ray form Kino Lorber that is not that old.  The picture quality is full of clarity, colors are warm and a little soft.  Black levels are nice and deep but it's not a vibrant film full of colors, if anything, the softness and muted colors tend to compliment this style of film.As for the cinematography, Pierre Milon (""The Trilogy"", ""The Class"", ""Time Out"") has done a great job in capturing emotion with the close-ups of Stanislas, his wife and others.  While not a beautiful film, he does manage to capture a wide-range of emotions.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Rapt"" is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film and center/front-channel driven.  Rarely is the film taken to an area with crowds, it's primarily in a room with two individuals speaking and thus, no external ambiance or anything that really utilizes the surround channels.Dialogue is crisp and clear.  The music by composer Riccardo Del Fra is also beautiful but outside of dialogue and music, there weren't a lot of action sequences or anything that utilizes the surround channels, although there were some scenes that involved the detectives that could have utilized ambiance or the surround channels, but the film is a straightforward front and center channel film.With that being said, the lossless soundtrack is appropriate for this film.Optional English subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES""Rapt"" comes with the following special features:Trailers - Kino Lorber trailers.Stills - Featuring stills from ""Rapt"".EXTRAS:""Rapt"" comes with a slipcase cover.JUDGMENT CALL:Have you watched many kidnapping films?  Well, the good news is that ""Rapt"" is unlike those other films thanks to the clever writing of Lucas Belvaux.When it comes to kidnapping films, there is always a banality of police trying to negotiate a release, a headstrong officer and his partner trying to save the kidnapped victim, the kidnappers receiving their due by getting killed by the hero, while the hero saves the day.  In other words,  kidnapping stories that we have seen over and over again.This is not the case for ""Rapt"".Inspired by the real life story of Baron &Eacute;douard-Jean Empain, the wealthy industrialist who was held captive for two months and even had his little finger amputated, that is probably the only similarity the real life kidnapping case has with this film.In ""Rapt"", audiences are see the story play out in the beginning for the wealthy industrialist Stanslas Graff.  We know that police are going to do all they can to help, we know the family is going to be worried and as for his company, they would fork over enough money they can to get him freed.  But why make the same kidnapping story over and over again.  Writer Lucas Belvaux takes a different route with ""Rapt"" by what if the person kidnapped was not a good guy afterall?Here is a man who seemed like he has it all.  A successful company, a beautiful loving wife and children.  But yet, we find out that he is gambler who is in debt, he has had many many mistresses and as his family who thinks they are well-off, well...maybe they aren't at all.  Did he care for his family?  Did he care about his business?  Or was this man all about himself and living off the success of others and having this facade of having this great life?We watch as Stanislas Graff is being held captive, the kidnappers thinking they scored big time by kidnapping this wealthy industrialist but as the weeks go on, they realize that his family and his company are not willing to pay his ransom.  For Stanislas, in his mind, how is is that no one is going to save him?  While in the public sentiment, those who were supportive and felt bad for him, have now looked at him as another wealthy individual who has abused his power with his wealth and betrayed not only his family but also his company.Performance by actor Yvan Attal is fantastic.  May it be a distressed man during the kidnapping or seeing the arrogant, yet egotistical wealthy man.  He does a remarkable job of playing the part of Stanislas Graff.  As well as the other characters including Francoise Fabian as his emotional wife.As for the Blu-ray release, I was hoping for audio commentary or special features, but we are given a stills gallery.  As for the picture quality, as mentioned, colors are warm, soft and a bit muted at times and by no means, is this film supposed to be vibrant or cheery.  It's a dark thriller and the picture and audio quality is appropriate for this film.""Rapt"" is a slow-paced film and for those expecting the traditional happy ending of kidnapping films, ""Rapt"" ends with a scene that leaves the viewer to interpret the final ending.  Has Stanislas Graff changed for the good or the bad?Overall, ""Rapt"" is a stunning thriller from filmmaker Lucas Belvaux that will leave you shocked and surprised of how things develop from beginning to end.  This is not a film about a man who changes his life after being kidnapped, don't expect the Hollywood happy ending.  ""Rapt"" is a film about a man who had it all and how far he has fallen.Recommended.",4,"""Rapt"" is a stunning thriller from filmmaker Lucas Belvaux that will leave you shocked and

1502113,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005SDB8F0,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","RAPT is more an experience than a film.  It is based on the true story of the 1978 kidnapping of French industrialist Edouard-Jean Empain, a millionaire playboy who is abducted and held for ransom for 60 days.  Though it is a very fine thriller of the kidnapping/ransom genre this film is far more than that. It is an exploration of the lives of men of wealth who allow their moneyed status to be able to  buy anything, behave in any way they wish, and trample lives of family and friends in the process.  Is it a pretty picture to follow? No, certainly not, but it is a revealing fact that a crime of kidnapping can be secondary to a life of greed and consumption of power and money that feeds into lives such as the main character of this film and the governmental agencies to respond differently to these moneyed moguls.Stanislaff Graff (Yvan Attal, in a mesmerizing role) is the wealthy industrialist married to the beautiful and wise Franoise (Anne Consigny), and also has a lover. He is kidnapped brutally from his limousine on the eve of his visit to China as part of the entourage of the French president. The kidnappers treat Graff cruelly, keeping him blindfolded and tied in a tiny tent in a dungeon of a basement: they demand a fifty million euro ransom. As an acct of proving their serious plot, they cut off one of his fingers. What follows is a terrifying sparring match between kidnappers, police and the board of the company of which Graff is the director. The main question for the board: is a human life worth more than fifty million euros? Will they be able to get that amount of money together in time anyway? While they decide this he degenerates physically and mentally in imprisonment. After sixty days Graff is released to a world now cognizant of his secret life of gambling and escapades and secret apartments that the press dredges up, revelations that are especially painful for his wife. Paying his ransom won't bury his secrets.This film was written and directed by Lucas Belvaux who presents his story with more emphasis on subterfuge and the psychological aspects of the affair that may make the film seem slow moving (125 minutes) but at film's end we realize that the true crime is not so much that of the kidnap/ransom but the abuse of power and money when so many in the world are suffering from homelessness and hunger and foreclosures etc. The drama is significantly heightened by the work of cinematographer Pierre Milon and the moody musical score by Riccardo Del Fra. This is a demanding film but an important one, and the acting of everyone in the large cast is on the highest level - especially the stunning performances by Yvan Attal and Anne Consigny.

We have a wealthy businessman, husband/father that is kidnapped for a sum that appears out of reach for his family and his employer, possible co-guarantor. As it turns out he's a bit of a self-serving, gambling, mistress supporting, SOB dog of a person so even though your sympathies lie with him though out most of the movie - doubts creep in.Spoiler and super-spoiler (read after watching):Right, so as you've seen he's let free by the captors because the ransom is not coming; he's told that he will have to pay the unimaginable sum upon receiving a forthcoming encoded message or his family dies. As we know, he's not too welcomed by family and business associates and those relationships appear to be becoming more distant. He does, however, display exorbitant attention upon his ""faithful"", non-judgemental dog. In the final scene, after receiving his encoded ransom message, he takes his dog and unlit cigar into the den, sits down and looks pensively upward as he ponders what happens if he doesn't pay.

Some of it gets repetitive, and the ending is intentionally telegraphed (why?) and notvery satisfying or thought provoking.  Also, in attempting to deal with so many themes, ideas and story threads(cops, the business people, lawyers, the family, the kidnap victim, the kidnappers, etc) there isn't much of achance to really dig beneath the surface of all these very intriguing characters and ideas.

1502117,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B005SDB8F0,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","Written and directed by Lucas Belvaux, ""Rapt"" is an unusual kidnapping drama -thoughtful, original, and unpredictable. Although it is imbued with tension, this is not a thriller but a drama of one man's fear, of tables turned, of loss of control. Stanislas Graff (Yvan Attal) is a Parisian businessman, born into wealth, president of the company that bears his father's name. He has a pretty, resigned wife, Franoise (Anne Consigny), and a string of mistresses. He lives in luxury, takes exotic vacations, engages in forbidden recreations, which include high-stakes gambling. Leaving his office one day, Stan is kidnapped. He is held, terrified, by men who demand 50 million euros for his return. But Stan has squandered much of his fortune, and his family cannot raise more than 20 million. Franoise wants to pay, but the police inspector (Michel Vota) on the case won't let her.I hope that the French authorities do not actually deal with kidnappings this way. The police in the film care more about catching the kidnappers than getting the victim back alive. They repeatedly endanger Stan's life. This creates tension between the police and the family, including Stan's blunt and elegant mother (Franoise Fabian), the family's loyal lawyer Mr. Walser (Alex Descas), and the company's vice president and Stan's temporary replacement Mr. Peyrac (Andr&eacute; Marcon). Meanwhile, the tabloid press has latched onto the story, and they are digging dirt, further compromising Stan's safety. There are multiple dynamics at play -between the kidnappers and their victim, the family and the police, and the relationship between Stan and wife Franoise that plays out indirectly, through intermediaries, over which neither person has any control.This is smart writing. But ""Rapt"" doesn't stop there. Some may think the dialogue between Stan and his captor too allegorical, but it is in the aftermath of the crime that the strongest themes emerge. The structure is unpredictable, the ideas are provocative, and Yvan Attal is terrific. So is Franoise Fabian in her small but riveting role as his concerned, straight-talking mother. The dramatic arc is unlike any other kidnapping film. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had not seen this movie before in countless other guises. The DVD (Lorber 2011) lacks any meaningful bonus features, unfortunately. There is a gallery of 21 production stills and 5 theatrical trailers, including one for ""Rapt"".

Which makes it all the more depressing that it never got to any of them. Which is not to say that what we got is not a watchable, if bog-standard, thriller, but it occurred to me more than once while I was watching it that had Belvaux, who also wrote the script, gotten together with Simon Hynd, who adapted (relatively well) Stona Fitch's novel Senseless for the screen, the two of them could have come up with the perfect abduction thriller. Alas, it was not to be.The plot: Stanislas Graff (The Interpreter's Yvan Attal), a high-powered businessman who has the French president's ear, is kidnapped and held for a 50 million euro ransom. But things start going wrong from the outset. The kidnappers seem to be working from false information, Stanislas' company's board of directors would rather negotiate terms than actually pay the money, and the longer Stansilas remains in captivity, the more of a field day the press is having with digging up the unsavory details of his provate life, to the point where the kidnappers start wondering: is this guy worth a plugged nickel, much less 50 million euros?The obvious first thing here is to give kudos to Belvaux for playing it straight; I can't imagine how much temptation there must have been to turn this into a farce, or at least a Reservoir Dogs or A Touch of Larceny-style satire. (And this movie reminded me of the latter more than once, I have to say.) On the other hand, he didn't give us enough character development, especially with the lead kidnapper, to turn this into the kind of talk-piece Belvaux seemed to be aiming for. That's why I started thinking about the flaws in Senseless, which I watched less than a month before seeing this, and by the time the movie was over I'd started seeing them as complementary pieces; those things Senseless did wrong, for the most part, Rapt got right, and vice versa, so putting the two together would have worked very well indeed. But neither is a bad film on its own; Rapt is very ambitious, though it often doesn't seem so. And where its characters are well-drawn, you can see flashes of the movie this should have been; they make it worth your while. ** ",3,...in Plastic.,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,2264,"['Rapt', 'Lucas', 'Belvaux', '2009', 'loved', 'mean', 'really', 'really', 'loved', 'places', 'Rapt', 'was', 'going', 'more', 'depressing', 'never', 'got', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'got', 'not', 'watchable', 'bog-standard', 'thriller', 'occurred', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'watching', 'had', 'Belvaux', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'gotten', 'together', 'Simon', 'Hynd', 'who', 'adapted', 'relatively', 'well', 'Stona', 'Fitch', 'novel', 'Senseless', 'screen', 'two', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'perfect', 'abduction', 'thriller', 'Alas', 'was', 'not', 'be.The', 'plot', 'Stanislas', 'Graff', 'Interpreter', 'Yvan', 'Attal', 'high-powered', 'businessman', 'who', 'French', 'president', 'ear', 'kidnapped', 'held', '50', 'million', 'euro', 'ransom', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'outset', 'kidnappers', 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'false', 'information', 'Stanislas', 'company', 'board', 'directors', 'would', 'rather', 'negotiate', 'terms', 'actually', 'pay', 'money', 'longer', 'Stansilas', 'captivity', 'more', 'field', 'day', 'press', 'having', 'digging', 'up', 'unsavory', 'details', 'provate', 'life', 'point', 'where', 'kidnappers', 'start', 'wondering', 'guy', 'plugged', 'nickel', 'much', 'less', '50', 'million', 'euros', 'obvious', 'first', 'thing', 'here', 'give', 'kudos', 'Belvaux', 'playing', 'straight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'temptation', 'there', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'turn', 'farce', 'least', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'A', 'Touch', 'Larceny-style', 'satire', 'movie', 'reminded', 'latter', 'more', 'once', 'have', 'say', 'other', 'hand', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'lead', 'kidnapper', 'turn', 'kind', 'talk-piece', 'Belvaux', 'seemed', 'be', 'aiming', 'why', 'started', 'thinking', 'flaws', 'Senseless', 'watched', 'less', 'month', 'seeing', 'time', 'movie', 'was', ""'d"", 'started', 'seeing', 'complementary', 'pieces', 'things', 'Senseless', 'did', 'wrong', 'most', 'part', 'Rapt', 'got', 'right', 'vice', 'versa', 'so', 'putting', 'two', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'bad', 'film', 'own', 'Rapt', 'very', 'ambitious', 'often', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'well-drawn', 'can', 'see', 'flashes', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'while', '**']",Rapt

That said, in my opinion a movie this good won't be ruined by ""spoilers,"" because it is not primarily about ""what happens next,"" but rather about the characters who inhabit it and how an extreme situation brings out who they are.The ""normal"" life of Stanislas Graff (Yvan Attal) is revealed to us in such a quick succession of fragments, we don't have much of a chance to judge him as a person: luncheon meeting of his company's Board (Graff is the Chairman), quick exit to visit his mistress, home in the embrace of wife and daughters, losing 50K Euro at cards, heading off on a foreign delegation, and then kidnapped.Minus the first few minutes, he spends about 1 1/2 hours of the movie blindfolded, only to be let up briefly for feeding and torture. It made me wonder why they were wasting such a great actor as Attal in a part where he was almost mute and his face was mostly hidden.For that 90 minutes (and arguably beyond), the center of the film is Anne Consigny, memorable from a few other parts, but never better than here as Graff's wife, Franoise. She immediately agrees to pay the ransom, but is opposed by the company which her husband heads. There is a power struggle within the company. There is a turf struggle between Franoise, the cops and Graff's company. Without the well-written-and-acted part of Franoise, this would be the stuff of a boilerplate thriller.Not since the prime of Sandrine Bonnaire have I seen an actress as riveting as Anne Consigny. The usual ""wife fretting at home"" part is dispensed with. Franoise learns just how badly her husband's lifestyle has damaged their personal finances. She has to confront the sight of the unmade bed in the apartment she learns her husband has kept a secret for 15 years. She endures the shrugging attitude toward playboy husbands as it is voiced by her mother-in-law (Franoise Fabien).Then, through means I'll leave you to discover for yourself, Stanislas makes it home. He (but not the viewer) is surprised at the lack of concern shown to him on his return. He watches his home life, his work life and his reputation unravel. We get a fuller picture of what a complete douche he is. Then, he slumps into a chair. The End. It's an ending not quite as enigmatic as that of CACHE, but close enough. Like that (or any Haneke film), there are many questions unanswered at the end. We never know who engineered the kidnapping. And we are spared the probably deadly results of Stanislas's final gesture of resignation.(4.5 stars. I dinged the movie half-a-star for a terrible score that did nothing but call attention to itself. No music at all would have been better, and luckily there are fairly long stretches without intrusive music cues.)",4,"If You're Like This Guy, Take Out Some K&R Insurance",1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2757,"['NOTE', 'customer', 'review', 'spoilers', 'said', 'opinion', 'movie', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'ruined', 'spoilers', 'not', 'primarily', 'what', 'next', 'rather', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabit', 'how', 'extreme', 'situation', 'out', 'who', 'are.The', 'normal', 'life', 'Stanislas', 'Graff', 'Yvan', 'Attal', 'revealed', 'quick', 'succession', 'fragments', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chance', 'judge', 'person', 'luncheon', 'meeting', 'company', 'Board', 'Graff', 'Chairman', 'quick', 'exit', 'visit', 'mistress', 'home', 'embrace', 'wife', 'daughters', 'losing', '50K', 'Euro', 'cards', 'heading', 'off', 'foreign', 'delegation', 'then', 'kidnapped.Minus', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'movie', 'blindfolded', 'only', 'be', 'let', 'up', 'briefly', 'feeding', 'torture', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'wasting', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'Attal', 'part', 'where', 'was', 'almost', 'mute', 'face', 'was', 'mostly', 'hidden.For', '90', 'minutes', 'arguably', 'center', 'film', 'Anne', 'Consigny', 'memorable', 'few', 'other', 'parts', 'never', 'better', 'here', 'Graff', 'wife', 'Franoise', 'immediately', 'pay', 'ransom', 'opposed', 'company', 'husband', 'heads', 'power', 'struggle', 'company', 'turf', 'struggle', 'Franoise', 'cops', 'Graff', 'company', 'well-written-and-acted', 'part', 'Franoise', 'would', 'be', 'stuff', 'boilerplate', 'thriller.Not', 'prime', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'have', 'seen', 'actress', 'as', 'riveting', 'Anne', 'Consigny', 'usual', 'wife', 'fretting', 'home', 'part', 'dispensed', 'Franoise', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'husband', 'lifestyle', 'damaged', 'personal', 'finances', 'confront', 'sight', 'unmade', 'bed', 'apartment', 'husband', 'kept', 'secret', '15', 'years', 'shrugging', 'attitude', 'playboy', 'husbands', 'voiced', 'mother-in-law', 'Franoise', 'Fabien', '.Then', 'means', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'discover', 'Stanislas', 'home', 'not', 'viewer', 'surprised', 'lack', 'concern', 'shown', 'return', 'home', 'life', 'work', 'life', 'reputation', 'unravel', 'get', 'fuller', 'picture', 'what', 'complete', 'douche', 'Then', 'chair', 'End', 'ending', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'enigmatic', 'CACHE', 'close', 'enough', 'Haneke', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'end', 'never', 'know', 'who', 'engineered', 'kidnapping', 'are', 'spared', 'probably', 'deadly', 'results', 'Stanislas', 'final', 'gesture', 'resignation', '4.5', 'stars', 'dinged', 'movie', 'half-a-star', 'terrible', 'score', 'did', 'nothing', 'call', 'attention', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'luckily', 'are', 'fairly', 'long', 'stretches', 'intrusive', 'music', 'cues']",Rapt

It is a slow paced drama, that does not have a payoff at the end.First, you have absolutely no sympathy for the guy that is kidnapped.  He's a jerk from start to finish.  There is no character arc where he turns the tables on his kidnappers, and becomes a real man.  He is pathetic.  An example:  The kidnappers return him to his wife and daughters, and the first person he wants to see is his dog.Second, through a random chit-chat with one of the kidnappers he reveals that he has hunted big game, and very adept with pistols.  This point is never followed up on in the film.  You expect him to grab a gun and kill the bad guys, or hunt them down after he is released. No, he returns to his weenie ways.Third, have the French police never heard of forensics?  Ransom notes are opened without gloves and the paper is not tested for finger prints, or the glue seal for DNA, nor do they seem to have street cameras on the person who delivered the note.  Also, this kidnapping (owing to this guy's connection with the French President) would be considered a terrorist act (until proven otherwise) and French Intelligence would have taken over the case.  In the film it is the Paris Police that do all of the botched investigating.  One botched example:  The ransom is to be delivered to a resort beach.  On the beach are at least a dozen (obvious) undercover Paris police.  Of course, the kidnappers see this and cancel the pick up.I stayed with the film to the very end, hoping it would get better.
