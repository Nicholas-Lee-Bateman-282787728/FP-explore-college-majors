With many obstacles in his way, Alex has a mission that he works to see through. An inspiring movie on the importance of &#34;not giving up&#34; on the important stuff. I watched and wondered how could he keep handling all the different foster families and different rules. He went from mom to stranger repeatedly. With some wise advice along the way, he finds avenues we all have but often forget are available to us all. Movie was AWESOME for me!",5,Family is more than just a word - it is a reason to belong to a bigger picture,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,521,"['Sometimes', 'life', 'important', 'people', 'make', 'good', 'promise', 'many', 'obstacles', 'way', 'Alex', 'mission', 'see', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'importance', '34', 'not', 'giving', 'up', '34', 'important', 'stuff', 'watched', 'wondered', 'how', 'could', 'keep', 'handling', 'different', 'foster', 'families', 'different', 'rules', 'went', 'mom', 'stranger', 'repeatedly', 'wise', 'advice', 'way', 'have', 'often', 'forget', 'are', 'available', 'Movie', 'was', 'AWESOME']",Finding a Family

While it is sad that the boy has to take dramatic steps in the beginning of the presentation, everything turns out all right for him later.  If you love movies about how one person's life is changed for the better by meeting another individual like I do, you should definitely purchase this item.  It is such a gift to be able to watch this presentation without having commercials interrupt the story.  Hope you enjoy this movie!",5,"Josh Harms ""Finding A Family"" review",1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,458,"['absolutely', 'love', 'DVD', 'sad', 'boy', 'take', 'dramatic', 'steps', 'beginning', 'presentation', 'everything', 'out', 'all', 'right', 'later', 'love', 'movies', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'life', 'changed', 'better', 'meeting', 'individual', 'do', 'should', 'definitely', 'purchase', 'item', 'such', 'gift', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'presentation', 'having', 'commercials', 'interrupt', 'story', 'Hope', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Finding a Family

Easley ""Opa""","[5, 5]",".Finding a Family is a true story about the hardships and perseverance in overcoming the turbulent home life of a young boy and his sick mother.An ambitions single mother  Ileana Chivescu (Kim Delaney) works hard to make a life for herself and her child Alex.  Through hard work she supports him, earns a PhD, and then gets a job as a professor.When he is ten she is injured in an automobile accident and is seriously hurt.  Ileana  develops bipolar disorder from brain injuries.  She reacts to her medicine and suffers severe effects that eventually cost her job, home, and the custody of her son.Alex (Jared Abrahamson) lives in and out of foster care, while his mother is in and out of hospitals.  Despite hardship Alex concentrates on his school work where he excels and dreams of attending Harvard University.Kim Delaney is effective as Ileana, convincing both as a strong, determined and loving mother and as a delusional, out of control  fanatic.  Jared Abrahamson is consistent as the driven student and troubled son.  The story is told well.I recommend Finding a Family for those who enjoy Hallmark films.  The movie is mostly sad as Alex struggles to survive.  This is an inspiring story.",4,Fragile Family,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,1198,"['.Finding', 'Family', 'true', 'story', 'hardships', 'perseverance', 'overcoming', 'turbulent', 'home', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'sick', 'mother.An', 'ambitions', 'single', 'mother', 'Ileana', 'Chivescu', 'Kim', 'Delaney', 'hard', 'make', 'life', 'herself', 'child', 'Alex', 'Through', 'hard', 'work', 'PhD', 'then', 'job', 'professor.When', 'ten', 'injured', 'automobile', 'accident', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'Ileana', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'brain', 'injuries', 'medicine', 'suffers', 'severe', 'effects', 'eventually', 'cost', 'job', 'home', 'custody', 'son.Alex', 'Jared', 'Abrahamson', 'foster', 'care', 'mother', 'hospitals', 'hardship', 'Alex', 'school', 'work', 'where', 'dreams', 'attending', 'Harvard', 'University.Kim', 'Delaney', 'effective', 'Ileana', 'convincing', 'strong', 'determined', 'loving', 'mother', 'delusional', 'control', 'fanatic', 'Jared', 'Abrahamson', 'consistent', 'driven', 'student', 'troubled', 'son', 'story', 'told', 'well.I', 'recommend', 'Finding', 'Family', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Hallmark', 'films', 'movie', 'mostly', 'sad', 'Alex', 'survive', 'inspiring', 'story']",Finding a Family
