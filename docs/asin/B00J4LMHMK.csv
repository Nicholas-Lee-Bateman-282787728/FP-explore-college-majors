1695443,A37HDQCJWVG9MN,B00J4LMHMK,David Ortiz,"[1, 3]","Not sure how to critique this since the movie's direction and subject really did appeal to me but I felt it should have been made during the 80s instead of now. Before watching it I had assumed it was going to be a low budget B movie you might find on the sci-fi channel or Netflix but surprisingly it was a little bit better than that. However it's not perfect and I can understand if someone doesn't like it or felt it was just a one-timer.Movies it resembles:Ghost in the Shell (1995), Terminator 3 (2003), Universal Soldier (1992), Robocop (2014), Battlestar Galactica (2004), i-Robot (2004)What it needed:Ending - Endings are important because it gives you the last impression so it can hurt the film if not done correctly. The ending was wrapped up pretty quickly and after little to no important dialogue and looking off into the sunset the credits begin to roll. So you're like, that's it?Budget - It needed a bigger budget. The reason for this is because some of the scenes, backgrounds, and locations are not that interesting. They could expanded their creativity by putting more thought and artistic work into these things. The robot is wonderful to look at but you mostly see modern rooms, lab hallways, and typical settings.Camera - You can always tell a quality of the film by the type of camera they used. They could have used a higher budgeted movie camera that you expect for cinema released films. It looks like a movie made for television or sci-fi channel. There are a lot of dark rooms and shadows instead of brightly lit rooms for details. Some dark scenes were I guess necessary to hide the machine's naked body.Characters & Acting - There are no big names or unforgettable faces except one and that is the actress for The Machine. The others character's moods and personalities are not likable, therefore you don't care if anyone gets killed off. The Acting is not terrible but not great. The Machine is more machine like and less &#34;some pretty actress trying to be machine&#34; than I expected. She did a somewhat satisfying job in creating a robot's personality.Action - in an action movie about a fighting machine you would expect a lot battle scenes and high suspense moments but there are not very many and they are pretty short. I wanted more of that but whatever.Story - A computer programmer who I forget his name is trying to create advanced artificial intelligence. He hires a woman (Ava) who has successfully done so. But the corrupt, (I think it was the british government?) or weapon research facility they work for want to use the robot to infiltrate enemy territories and assassinate key members in the war. We never see that happen because the robot has a conscience to save her programmer (who is trying to save his daughter) and put an end to the corruption. Overall it was just okay because it could have used some more work. I can't recommend it since it lacks in the areas mentioned above but if you're into science fiction, ai robot movies, and bored I recommend giving it a try.

Yet her heart is pure and she trusts the male lead implicitly even though ever time he dumps her to rush to his ailing daughter more death games happen in his absence.

1695453,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00J4LMHMK,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 1]","Any fan of science fiction worth his or her salt will tell you that the sci-fi stories that work best are those that are grounded in decidedly human tales.  For example, DISTRICT 9 works as well as it does because it takes the story of your average bureaucrat just trying to do his job who (tragically) finds his humanity exactly as he&#8217;s losing it.  Likewise, the exceptional BLADE RUNNER is as much about the human experience as it is the artificial, putting a character who doesn&#8217;t even know what he is at the center of a controversy involving lifeforms both real and manufactured.In the last few years &#8211; with the emergence of small but smart sci-fi films like UPSTREAM COLOR and VANISHING WAVES &#8211; I think it&#8217;s grown harder and harder to get noticed by critics; but thank goodness for THE MACHINE.  While I didn&#8217;t find it as revelatory as others in the biz, it&#8217;s still one of those flicks that&#8217;s worth your time and investment.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Deep into a second Cold War, Britain&#8217;s Ministry of Defense wants a game-changing weapon.  Lead scientist Vincent McCarthy (Toby Stephens) has developed a cybernetic super-soldier dubbed &#8216;The Machine.&#8217;  When a programming bug causes the prototype to run amok, McCarthy takes his obsessive efforts underground.  Soon he has perfected the ideal marriage of human and machine in his ultimate creation, a beautiful and dangerous being (Caity Lotz) that may be the key to ending the war, but a sentience stirring inside the machine puts everyone&#8217;s plans in jeopardy.&#8221;THE MACHINE is one of those rare films that is probably received better the less you know about it.  That&#8217;s a bit of a rough statement I realize, but not even the product packaging does the plot justice here as there are many, many other layers at work in the narrative that aren&#8217;t touched on, the most important of which is McCarthy&#8217;s personal struggle.  Like James Franco&#8217;s character in RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, McCarthy is a scientist who&#8217;s committed to his work in hopes that his discoveries will allow him to find a cure for his ailing daughter; were this struggle entirely missing from the film, then THE MACHINE would probably be as heartless, bloodless, and soulless as the next cinematic attempt to tinker in the areas of Artificial Intelligence.  Because this decidedly human struggle remains front-and-center in McCarthy&#8217;s motivations, this dark and curious story loses some of its formulaic elements and remains relevant.That said, writer/director Caradog James kinda/sorta taps into scenes and influences of other films a bit more often here than he should have.  For example, the setting of the military lab feels like the Liberty Station set from John Carpenter&#8217;s ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, though with much less effective lighting.  The base&#8217;s interiors are so poorly lit that they try to evoke the look and visual palate of Ridley Scott&#8217;s BLADE RUNNER.  And the film&#8217;s score also tries to hit creative beats of both of those features along with a slew of low-budget horror films of the 80&#8217;s.  While it&#8217;s great to have &#8216;influences,&#8217; there&#8217;s no need to have them so overpowering that they block the importance of your own ideas, and I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what THE MACHINE would&#8217;ve looked look if more creative choices were made entirely on their own merits and not to evoke someone else&#8217;s.Likewise, there are elements of the story that tap a vein kinda/sort already amply explored by Syfy&#8217;s pretty stellar BATTLESTAR GALACTICA redux, as well as its CAPRICA spin-off.  The real shame in that is that James&#8217; ideas here were strong enough to carry the day on their own.  While the ending came off a bit too formulaic for my tastes, it was still awfully hard to turn away from this inspired look at the near-future wherein our greatest enemy may very well be the souls we manufacture to do our own bidding.Also, I&#8217;d be remiss in my duties if I failed to mention that THE MACHINE has found certain acclaim from the film community.  It won the &#8216;Best Film&#8217;, &#8216;Best Costume Design&#8217;, and &#8216;Best Original Score&#8217; trophies at the 2013 BAFTA Awards in Wales.  Furthermore, the film won the Raindance Award while actress Caity Lotz had to settle for only a nomination as the &#8216;Most Promising Newcomer&#8217; at the 2013 British Independent Film Awards.  And it also garnered some prestigious attention from the 2013 Raindance Film Festival, the 2013 Sitges-Catalonian International Film Festival, and the 2013 Toronto After Dark Film Festival.  Bravo!THE MACHINE (2013) is produced by Red and black Films and a host of other contributors.  DVD distribution is being handled by XLRator Media.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly shot film from start-to-finish, but I thought writer/director Caradog James overused his affinity for dark spaces more than he needed to.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then you may be disappointed: there&#8217;s only an &#8220;Inside the Machine&#8221; feature and the theatrical trailer to look forward to; I honestly expected more.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I&#8217;m sure I probably didn&#8217;t like this one as much as most will &#8211; that sometimes happens with me and science fiction films, which I hold in an unusually high regard &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should pass up checking out THE MACHINE.  My problems with it largely had to do with creative, artistic choices that I felt were derivative, meaning that the picture would&#8217;ve been served better by incorporating a freshness across the board instead of reminding me of so many other uses of the same ideas and themes.  It&#8217;s definitely worth a look, though be prepared to study it through too many layers of murky cinematography.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at XLRator Media provided me with a DVD copy of THE MACHINE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion

Add in a generous mix of evil government characters doing evilly, governmentally things and it's the sort of rehashed crap that even TV shows wouldn't dare try out these days.There's some artsy cinematography that tries to disguise that it was clearly shot in a parking lot but the production standards really don't hold up. The lighting is bad and the 80s synth soundtrack is dreadful (Vangelis it ain't).

The basic plot in this film surrounds a computer scientist is developing AI while working at a somewhat creepy appearing military installation run by the British government during a vague conflict with China. The ostensible goal of the project is to find ways to aid brain injured soldiers. The doctor is aware of potentially more sinister aspirations of the government but ignores this because he believes his work is the only way to save his daughter who is dying from a degenerative brain disease, ( Rett's syndrome). Eventually he succeeds in developing a fully functioning android that apparently is self aware. Like most sci-fi androids the machine is faster, stronger and much harder to injure than a flesh and blood human. The plot thickens as the governments plans for the &#34;Machine&#34; run up against the scientists plans and the &#34;machines&#34; own proto-humanity. The movie gets points for effectively spooky atmospherics, and conceptually interesting ( if not particularly novel) plot. Like most science fiction movies looses points for almost complete lack of connection with anything like real science. That is the movie throws out terms like quantum computing, etc.. and without any real appreciation of what that means. Although this is a sin of most sci-fi flicks there are exceptions who do a better job of avoiding this, think Robert Wises adaptation of Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain.

1695490,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00J4LMHMK,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[8, 11]","Very few movies try to help us envision how machines or cybernetic organisms become sentient beings, though there are plenty that show how things go wrong afterward. Because the nuts and bolts of this process are not that interesting to many just looking for action, you see a lot of mixed reviews on this movie. I myself almost turned the movie off during the first five minutes, but I am so glad I stuck with it. It still has action if you wait for it. Let me make the case for why else you should give this movie a chance.This evolution or bestowal of consciousness is where modest budget THE MACHINE excels in my opinion. Of course you still have to suspend belief a little. Here we have wounded soldiers from a near future war being used as guinea pigs for interface with cybernetic implants or replacement parts of the body, including areas of the brain. That's just a springboard as they begin to create the cybernetic organism from scratch.  Ethical issues are also tackled as broken solders are used and discarded.Vincent is a driven artificial intelligence engineer obsessed with his work because of his dying daughter. He wishes to succeed in the mapping of his daughter's consciousness and transfer her to another being he will create. In his quest, he is forced to make a deal with the devil, so to speak, as he works with a powerful entity from the Ministry of Defense (MOD) in exchange for funding. The MOD has a specific interest in developing an ultimate warrior. Vincent hires a young prodigy in the AI field (played by Caity Lotz) who has just made a breakthrough in creating a computer with true artificial intelligence. Vincent begins combining his assistant's work with his own in mapping human consciousness and cybernetic organisms. He maps his assistant's brain and body as the first test case and is secretly mapping his daughter for later. They soon ""give birth"" of a type to a sentient cybernetic organism with both the physical features and some intellect of his assistant. This being has also been programmed with suppressed martial skills from the military that Vincent is not aware of. This new being is her own individual despite having the female scientist's brain map transferred to her mind. Caity Lotz plays both characters and really shows her depth as she gives life to the new being showing child like vulnerability, the awkwardness of the machine, and the hardness of the weapon. She is completely believable and charming as the witty and intelligent scientist at the same time. She is so stunning and her dance background and amazing physique are employed to humanize the machine as she discovers art and beauty in the form of music and dance. That sounds cheesy, but I can tell you she had my attention. Vincent happens upon her as she is dancing without ever being taught or prompted. She simply feels the music and creates of her own desire. It's a beautiful scene and there's some chemistry going on.  The machine's true applications become more apparent and conflicts develop between Vincent and the MOD. You know things have to go wrong and that's where the action comes in. Can this machine feel affection or instinctively know right from wrong?You will see other reviews specifically mention Blade Runner as a connection or inspiration. In truth, it's mainly the music that is sometimes reminiscent of that movie. This production is really not like Blade Runner. However, if someone said - write a prequel to show how a Blade Runner type world could eventually happen - this is a plausible genesis. Just don't expect this movie to resemble that one much in any way. The CGI use and special effects are very modestly applied. When they are, it's subtle but very cool in my opinion. I really liked the way they made her skin slightly luminesce or glow when the machine is processing information or changing a mood. It was just beautiful and clever while maintaining the feeling we are still dealing with a machine.3/4ths of this movie is spent showing the development of the new being. If you are interested in the process and willing to wait for the action, it will be a very rewarding experience. For those not interested in dragging out the how or why, it may not hold your interest. I suggest getting through the first 15-30 min before passing judgment.",4,MACHINE'S EVOLUTION TO SENTIENT BEING - Hard theme well executed - Why some may not enjoy it,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,4305,"['Very', 'few', 'movies', 'try', 'help', 'envision', 'how', 'machines', 'cybernetic', 'organisms', 'become', 'sentient', 'beings', 'are', 'plenty', 'show', 'how', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'afterward', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'process', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'many', 'just', 'looking', 'action', 'see', 'lot', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'movie', 'almost', 'turned', 'movie', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'stuck', 'still', 'action', 'wait', 'Let', 'make', 'case', 'why', 'else', 'should', 'give', 'movie', 'chance.This', 'evolution', 'bestowal', 'consciousness', 'where', 'modest', 'budget', 'THE', 'MACHINE', 'excels', 'opinion', 'course', 'still', 'have', 'suspend', 'belief', 'little', 'Here', 'have', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'near', 'future', 'war', 'being', 'used', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'interface', 'cybernetic', 'implants', 'replacement', 'parts', 'body', 'including', 'areas', 'brain', 'just', 'springboard', 'begin', 'create', 'cybernetic', 'organism', 'scratch', 'Ethical', 'issues', 'are', 'also', 'tackled', 'broken', 'solders', 'are', 'used', 'discarded.Vincent', 'driven', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'engineer', 'obsessed', 'work', 'dying', 'daughter', 'succeed', 'mapping', 'daughter', 'consciousness', 'transfer', 'being', 'will', 'create', 'quest', 'forced', 'make', 'deal', 'devil', 'so', 'speak', 'powerful', 'entity', 'Ministry', 'Defense', 'MOD', 'exchange', 'funding', 'MOD', 'specific', 'interest', 'developing', 'ultimate', 'warrior', 'Vincent', 'young', 'prodigy', 'AI', 'field', 'played', 'Caity', 'Lotz', 'who', 'just', 'made', 'breakthrough', 'creating', 'computer', 'true', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'Vincent', 'combining', 'assistant', 'work', 'own', 'mapping', 'human', 'consciousness', 'cybernetic', 'organisms', 'assistant', 'brain', 'body', 'first', 'test', 'case', 'secretly', 'mapping', 'daughter', 'later', 'soon', 'give', 'birth', 'type', 'sentient', 'cybernetic', 'organism', 'physical', 'features', 'intellect', 'assistant', 'being', 'also', 'been', 'programmed', 'suppressed', 'martial', 'skills', 'military', 'Vincent', 'not', 'aware', 'new', 'being', 'own', 'individual', 'having', 'female', 'scientist', 'brain', 'map', 'transferred', 'mind', 'Caity', 'Lotz', 'characters', 'really', 'depth', 'life', 'new', 'being', 'showing', 'child', 'vulnerability', 'awkwardness', 'machine', 'hardness', 'weapon', 'completely', 'believable', 'charming', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'scientist', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'stunning', 'dance', 'background', 'amazing', 'physique', 'are', 'employed', 'humanize', 'machine', 'art', 'beauty', 'form', 'music', 'dance', 'cheesy', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'attention', 'Vincent', 'upon', 'dancing', 'ever', 'being', 'taught', 'prompted', 'simply', 'feels', 'music', 'creates', 'own', 'desire', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'chemistry', 'going', 'machine', 'true', 'applications', 'become', 'more', 'apparent', 'conflicts', 'develop', 'Vincent', 'MOD', 'know', 'things', 'have', 'go', 'wrong', 'where', 'action', 'Can', 'machine', 'feel', 'affection', 'instinctively', 'know', 'right', 'wrong', 'will', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'specifically', 'mention', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'connection', 'inspiration', 'truth', 'mainly', 'music', 'sometimes', 'reminiscent', 'movie', 'production', 'really', 'not', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'However', 'someone', 'said', 'write', 'prequel', 'show', 'how', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'type', 'world', 'could', 'eventually', 'happen', 'plausible', 'genesis', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'resemble', 'one', 'much', 'way', 'CGI', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'modestly', 'applied', 'When', 'are', 'subtle', 'very', 'cool', 'opinion', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'made', 'skin', 'slightly', 'glow', 'when', 'machine', 'processing', 'information', 'changing', 'mood', 'was', 'just', 'beautiful', 'clever', 'maintaining', 'feeling', 'are', 'still', 'dealing', 'machine.3/4ths', 'movie', 'spent', 'showing', 'development', 'new', 'being', 'are', 'interested', 'process', 'willing', 'wait', 'action', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'not', 'interested', 'dragging', 'out', 'how', 'why', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'interest', 'suggest', 'getting', 'first', '15-30', 'min', 'passing', 'judgment']",N/A

Normally a bad musical score I'd just ignore, but this one truly detracted from the movie- The head guy who leads the labs quickly shows his cards as being a nasty guy.

1695503,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00J4LMHMK,Robert Hayes,"[2, 3]","THE MACHINE is competently made, occasionally deep but slightly underwhelming sci-fi film. The story is about a government employee who works with robotics. His daughter is sick, and he hopes to find a cure for her through his work. Shortly after taking on a new assistant, Ava, she is killed and he puts her consciousness into a machine that has her likeness. One thing I did like about the movie was that it took its time with character development and raised those interesting questions that many other sci-films only flirt with: the question of whether AI can ever be considered &#34;alive&#34;, what it means to be human, etc. Character motivations were also explored to a degree, which helped to flesh out the material despite the short running time. The only fault I can find with it is that there wasn't enough payoff in terms of action or suspense. The movie was definitely building up to something (which I won't spoil), but the way in which it was resolved was kind of messy and could have been handled in a better way. Still, I did enjoy it. The soundtrack is also worth mentioning. There were elements of it that reminded me of BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.

This one I recommend.The Machine has the typical ""can science go to far theme"". There is also a dash of military.What I love about it is the lead, Caity Lotz. She's on fire! I normally don't like many modern actresses because their parts are so flat. Not with Caity. She actually plays two roles and she's believable in either. The roles are well constructed so kudos to the scriptwriter!The special effects are beautiful. Yes, there is nudity, but it's tastefully done. Please note I'm writing this in the same paragraph as special effects. The creation of the Machine is unique. Kudos again to the technical director and the special effects team.The locations for this film are simple. But that simplicity does not take away from the story. The actors bring you into it.This film reminds me somewhat of the Terminator, but I cannot say it'll be exactly the same. While both have action, the Machine has much more drama and depth.The only reason it's 4.5 stars and not 5 is because I was not able to understand Cyborg speech. It wasn't automatically subtitled.

This is one of the best science fiction films that I have seen lately. The premise mines the endlessly fascinating subject of artificial intelligence, and does so with nuance, even considering the fairly quick pace of the story. Very tight construction overall.The main thing that I would say is that The Machine is exceptionally well directed. It is a work of both technical skill and artistic instinct. This is not the sort of cheap sci-fi that you may be wondering if it is, if you are anything like me. It may not be a huge, behemoth of a film, but it incorporates some very cool, perfectly utilized visual effects, and the shot composition is fantastic. Perfect visual choices for the material. The writing and acting are solid, and in the case of the lead actress of course, notably good.There are certainly traces of Blade Runner, A.I., Her and other films, but this one stands on its own just fine. It is serious, thoughtful science fiction. Not perfect, but critiquing the occasional scientific implausibility is really missing the point, here. This is not a documentary, but rather a fictional drama. That being said, it is in my opinion and impeccably well-made film and one of the best examples of recent film-making in this genre.

And the robots chattering in private amongst themselves while hapless humans struggle through their lives.  You know it won't end well for any of the humans.  But there was one real problem that was never explained and would have made a nicer ending.  In the opening scenes  it appears our protagonist scientist dies.

Kind of a Terminator meets Robocop meets the darkness in Alien  ...but not as big budget as those movies and definitely not as layered as those movies. The female actress in The Machine was really good in machine mode and all the actors did pretty well....but that is all that should be given notice. ok...the graphics were semi-decent too. But I wish it was worth my $3.99 rental fee. It is not a movie you would wonder about. Not a complexly layered movie. Just kind of superficial in its delivery. The dialogue is decent...more real....which keeps to the act of being human vs. being machine. Just wish it had more to give. If it was the beginning of a book series or something...maybe then it would stand a chance...but who knows. ...but I don't need another Resident Evil either.,1,had potential.,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,887,"['ok', '.this', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', '.just', 'always', 'fell', 'shy', 'direction', 'Kind', 'Terminator', 'meets', 'Robocop', 'darkness', 'Alien', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'layered', 'movies', 'female', 'actress', 'Machine', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'machine', 'mode', 'actors', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', '.but', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'notice', 'ok', 'graphics', 'were', 'semi-decent', 'too', 'wish', 'was', 'worth', '3.99', 'rental', 'fee', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'wonder', 'Not', 'complexly', 'layered', 'movie', 'Just', 'kind', 'superficial', 'delivery', 'dialogue', 'decent', 'more', 'real', '.which', 'keeps', 'act', 'being', 'human', 'vs.', 'being', 'machine', 'Just', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'give', 'was', 'beginning', 'book', 'series', 'something', 'maybe', 'then', 'would', 'stand', 'chance', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'either']",N/A

This movie is a plausible scenario. Pay close attention, every scene is important.The quality of the acting is unremarkable.
