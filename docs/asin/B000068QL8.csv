705131,AMUTYOX234D90,B000068QL8,Bill,"[14, 32]","I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.The worst part was how scriptwriter Murray Smith got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does.",2,Extremely unthrilling,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,1475,"['was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'obvious', 'borrowing', 'central', 'premise', 'Fugitive', 'was', 'lack', 'suspense', 'surprises', 'got', 'expected', 'thrill', 'ride', 'movie', 'never', 'materialized', 'long', '3-hour', '20-minute', 'DVD.Obviously', 'script', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'here', 'terms', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'total', 'flop', 'None', 'clues', 'amount', 'much', 'can', 'see', 'supposed', 'plot', 'mile', 'away', 'villains', 'are', 'easy', 'spot.The', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'how', 'scriptwriter', 'Murray', 'Smith', 'got', 'protagonist', 'scrapes', 'much', 'old-time', 'serial', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'water', 'surrounded', 'seemingly', 'escape', 'Then', 'fade', 'out', 'Fade', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'back', 'apartment', 'How', 'managed', 'escape', 'never', 'shown', 'explained', 'What', 'assume', 'was', 'lack', 'much', 'budget', 'evident', 'other', 'odd', 'choices', 'one', 'scene', 'skyscraper', 'said', 'be', 'burning', 'ground', 'instead', 'seeing', 'part', ""'re"", 'told', 'sound', 'effect', 'sirens', 'background', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'always', 'liability', 'creativity', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here.What', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'bearable', 'interesting', 'main', 'performance', 'not', 'forthcoming', 'Bean', 'range', 'subtlety', 'interesting', 'bits', 'supporting', 'actors', 'particular', 'Nitin', 'Ganatra', 'Pakistani', 'cab', 'service', 'operator', 'scenes', 'crackle', 'little', 'else', 'movie']",Extremely Dangerous

If I have one small complaint it was the accents and colloquilisms are so thick at time I had a little trouble understanding it. I actually would have liked the option for subtitles, unfortunatly for the hearing impaired as well this is not an option. This is a bare bones DVD. It is a long movie and a little editing may have trimmed the runtime but I was never disappointed in the acting or story. Fans of Sean Bean should definitely catch it.

705133,A3RBIL77ES85WQ,B000068QL8,Jrobby,"[57, 59]","This movie was a very enjoyable surprise. I bought it mainly because I adore Sean Bean and I had heard that this role was actually written for him. I was expecting to see another formulaic thriller (albeit with great scenery), but instead I was treated to an entertaining and intelligent four-hour film. As I said in the title, I consider it the thinking man's Fugitive - same general idea but with so much more depth. I'm ashamed to admit that while I'm on my third or fourth viewing I still don't completely understand all the British accents and some of the finer plot points, but that's okay. This is one movie I plan to watch many, many times. Extremely Dangerous is one of a severe minority of movies that treats the viewer like they have a brain in their heads (gasp!). It doesn't describe everything in minute detail. What a refreshing change from all the summer blockbusters that repeatedly beat you over the head with plot. This movie also is heavy on the characterization. No one-dimensional characters need apply! Neil Byrne, the protagonist, is especially appealing for his multiple layers. This is a man who can do some pretty ruthless things but he still manages to walk that fine line between good guy and villain. I liked the way the characters related to each other in realistic, and often funny and touching ways, without ever striking a false note. Overall, I gave Extremely Dangerous five stars because the writing and story were just superb. Sean Bean does his usual excellent job, not that I would expect anything less. He is entertaining and believable as a man so conflicted and tormented by forces he has no control over. This movie should be required viewing for everyone who calls themselves fans of Sean Bean in particular, or just fans of well-made thrillers in general.

I have watched it several times and enjoyed it each time.  Mr. Bean gives a great performance, the movie clips right along. The acting in roles large and small are excellent, especially the Pakistani taxi dispatcher.  I have advised others to buy this movie and they have enjoyed it too.  The story line is excellent and yes, it reminds one of The Fugitive, but only on the surface.  I would prefer a tish more resolution in the ending, but I can't overly quibble about it.
