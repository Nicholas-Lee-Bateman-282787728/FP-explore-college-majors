929057,A1CR8KTHI9S9I5,B000AMZJRW,Beatrix Potter,"[15, 16]","In all candor, I purchased this dvd because I am so intrigued by Roy Dupuis in the La Femme Nikita series. I had read about his popularity and status in Canada; when I heard about this new release and the critical acclaim it received, curiosity overwhelmed me.  This is not a conventional, traditional plot driven movie.  I don't say that by way of criticism but rather to inform.  One has to pay close attention to keep track of what is going on and even then it's purposefully confusing, much like ""Memento.""  At the end of the movie I had any number of unanswered questions. That's not always a bad thing--that a movie causes you to think and wonder is sometimes the hallmark of a good film.  I enjoyed Dupuis' performance. If you get the chance, I recommend this movie.  Just don't expect the expected or you will be disappointed.",4,"Surreal - a la ""Memento""",1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,834,"['candor', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'am', 'so', 'intrigued', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'series', 'had', 'read', 'popularity', 'status', 'Canada', 'when', 'heard', 'new', 'release', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'received', 'curiosity', 'overwhelmed', 'not', 'conventional', 'traditional', 'plot', 'driven', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'way', 'criticism', 'rather', 'inform', 'One', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'going', 'even', 'then', 'purposefully', 'confusing', 'much', 'Memento', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'number', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'not', 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'think', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'hallmark', 'good', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'Dupuis', 'performance', 'get', 'chance', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'expected', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",Memoires affectives / Looking for Alexander (Original French Version with English Subtitles)

929059,A1WI6S60M5AS87,B000AMZJRW,"J. Lopez ""Jen_1013""","[0, 0]","I'll admit it. I only bought it because Roy Dupuis was the principle actor. I knew next to nothing about this movie. I will say that the ending makes you think.Basically, Roy plays a man who awoke from a coma with no memory of who he is or anyone else in his life. The movie is about that journey and discovering what is true and isn't. What I really ruminated on after the movie was this question: Having recovered his memory, does Alexander set about putting things right in his life with those around him or does recovering his memory affect him in such a way that things return back to status quo? It's an interesting question - what are we but the sum of our memories? It's an amazing story that took several viewings to fully grasp the concepts.For those Dupuis fans who want an English dubbed movie, this isn't it. But it was a treat hearing him speak his native tongue. I wish more American audiences were exposed to his work. Roy's performance here is evocative of his performance in the ""La Femme Nikita"" episode called 'Not Was,' in which Michael lost his memory. As then, here Roy changes his voice, mannerisms, body language, all to convey an uncertainty inherent in him as he has no memory. A blank slate. This role really expanded his range and I love it. It's now a favorite of mine.",5,Underrated and understated magnificence,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,1299,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'only', 'bought', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'was', 'principle', 'actor', 'knew', 'next', 'nothing', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'think.Basically', 'Roy', 'man', 'who', 'awoke', 'coma', 'memory', 'who', 'anyone', 'else', 'life', 'movie', 'journey', 'discovering', 'what', 'true', ""n't"", 'What', 'really', 'ruminated', 'movie', 'was', 'question', 'Having', 'recovered', 'memory', 'Alexander', 'set', 'putting', 'things', 'right', 'life', 'recovering', 'memory', 'affect', 'way', 'things', 'return', 'back', 'status', 'quo', 'interesting', 'question', 'what', 'are', 'sum', 'memories', 'amazing', 'story', 'took', 'several', 'viewings', 'fully', 'grasp', 'concepts.For', 'Dupuis', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'English', 'dubbed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'was', 'treat', 'hearing', 'speak', 'native', 'tongue', 'wish', 'more', 'American', 'audiences', 'were', 'exposed', 'work', 'Roy', 'performance', 'here', 'evocative', 'performance', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'episode', 'called', ""'Not"", 'Was', 'Michael', 'lost', 'memory', 'then', 'here', 'Roy', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'body', 'language', 'convey', 'uncertainty', 'inherent', 'memory', 'blank', 'slate', 'role', 'really', 'expanded', 'range', 'love', 'now', 'favorite', 'mine']",Memoires affectives / Looking for Alexander (Original French Version with English Subtitles)
