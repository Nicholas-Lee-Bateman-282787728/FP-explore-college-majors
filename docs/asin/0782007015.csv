The setting is all wrong, despite a feeble attempt to bolster the atmosphere with insert shots from the first movie. I read somewhere that the director never bothered to watch the first two films.

40477,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,0782007015,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[1, 2]","First things first. If you're looking for anything great (and by that I mean that it's along the lines of the first Hellraiser movie) or remotely scary, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a good natured and overly silly movie, this is your girl.Where the previous movie in the series tried a little more for laughs and moved out of Hull House, this movie goes back to the basics of the first film. The good part of this is that this is what people want from the series, but the downfall of this is that the movie is a little overly familiar at times since there's a lot borrowed from the first film. (Even some stock footage of demonic Angela coming down the hallway!) This is all sort of par for the course since fans coming back for a third dose of demons will already be fully aware of the law of direct to video sequels as well as the cheesiness of the series. And yes, there is nudity and all that is implied with nudity in a horror film, so if you're not willing to have gratuitous shots of topless girls and two people getting it on, then you'll want to skip this.Now as far as the DVD itself goes, it's fairly bare bones. There's a French language track (half of the DVD sleeve is in French), but not much else. There's no subtitles, if you're someone who is a little hard of hearing. I'm glad to have found this on DVD and I understand that this entry in the series is sort of undernoticed, but I would've liked to have subtitles for those times when I don't want to have my TV blaring. (I can't always hear so well.)Overall, this was a fun film.

But it does have a standard plastic CD case and very clean artwork, a menu, and English or French language options. The film itself doesn't look so bad. It doesn't look as if it were transfered from a video cassette, it's actually slightly cleaner than that. It does have a sort of ""digital"" feel to it, as if it were perhaps cleaned up with a computer program so it wouldn't look like a bad transfer.

After realizing it had been closed for six years I ordered two softshells. While sitting in taco bell wondering what my next move would be it struck me like a bolt of lightning.

I watched this on Halloween with a few friends and it was a serviceable movie. We made fun of a few things (the production budget needed to be at least two times higher to really pull off some of the rather ambitious effects), but we all had a good time. The scene with the cop questioning the convenience store clerk about the missing money is hilarious...""pick a card""...Anyway, I haven't seen part one or part two, but buy Night Of The Demons 3 if you are a fan of low-budget horror, or a fan of You Can't Do That On Television.

The sequel to it lacked some punch, and seemed more geared towards sex than anything to do with demons. The third film, NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 3, lacks the power of the first film and the slight mix of humor, sex, and scares of the second film. While by no means a failure, NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 3 isn't as strong a flick, so you're going to be left disappointed but at the same time entertained. The same theme occurs here as a group of teens ends up in a house they should have never gone to in the first place, and after a shoot out at a convenience store, they hide out in this house and they're not only being pursued by law enforcement, but they're also being pursued by demons. The hijinks in this movie aren't as scary, and you're more apt to laugh than shriek. This movie definitely has some good moments in it, and Amelia Kinkade is still charming as Angela (she was better in the first and second).

There was also quite a bit of poorly realized CGI, although the practical effects weren't bad. The film's humor was badly written, definitely not as great as the first two films.There was a cool scene where one of the character's arms becomes a snake and turns against them, so I give it credit for that moment.Overall, genre fans will find bits and pieces to get a kick out of while watching it once, but replay value is going to be disappointingly low compared to the first two films.",2,cheapo sequel,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,1233,"['Night', 'Demons', '3', 'might', 'expect', 'severe', 'drop', 'quality', 'production', 'budget', 'everything', 'else', 'including', 'enjoyment', 'level.The', 'story', 'group', 'kids', 'again', 'course', 'time', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'run', 'law', 'shootout', 'convenience', 'store', 'Frantic', 'leaking', 'gasoline', 'stop', 'van', 'Hull', 'House', 'night', 'only', 'worse', 'there.Before', 'adjusted', 'how', 'bonkers', 'both', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'direction', 'were', 'was', 'really', 'loving', 'how', 'laughably', 'bad', 'was', 'had', 'grin', 'face', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'figuring', 'would', 'have', 'sort', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'flick', 'hands', 'once', 'mayhem', 'mayhem', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'imaginative', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'poorly', 'realized', 'CGI', 'practical', 'effects', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'humor', 'was', 'badly', 'written', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'two', 'films.There', 'was', 'cool', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'character', 'arms', 'snake', 'turns', 'so', 'give', 'credit', 'moment.Overall', 'genre', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'bits', 'pieces', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'once', 'replay', 'value', 'going', 'be', 'disappointingly', 'low', 'compared', 'first', 'two', 'films']",N/A

As soon as I got it I opened it up and watched it....I must say I was not all that thrilled with the 3rd movie. First off the movie takes place in a completely different house then the first two movies. The lay out of the house was all wrong. The house wasn't scary or creepy in any way what so ever. The house looked to clean and to new to be abandoned for 20+ years.SPOILER ALERT....The story starts off with a bunch of wannabe thugs driving around looking for chicks. They finally pick up two females, then the road leads them to a quickie mart. Out of no where a quick stop at the quickie mart turns to an all out battle with two police officers. It was very random. Now because the kids think they killed a cop ( But didn't, he had a vest on )they head to the infamous Hull House to hide out. While at this house, they meet Angela and of course she picks them off one by one. Until there is only two left standing. ( I don't want to  spoil to much of the movie ). If you are anything like me, you would rather watch the movie for yourself then listen to someone else's review.I will say that I was extremely happy to see the same woman that played Angela ( Amelia Kinkade )in one and two in this one. The movie was a classic cheesy rated B horror movie. Nothing more, nothing less. If you seen the first two then you might as well see this one to finish it up. I am happy that I now have all three and I will bring them out come Halloween and get a great scare and a laugh.As for the price it was well worth it for a brand new copy of the movie ( especially since it is hard to find ) I paid $ 8.00. It was packaged well and shipped fast. Overall I got what I paid for and I have no complaints.

While kicking it up and having a good time, they go from trying to pass a fake ID to accidentally ""robbing"" a store. After this goes horrible wrong, they run and end up - at Hull House.I picked up the DVD not too long ago and watched it after watching the VHS edition. Talk about a big difference. not adjusting tracking is the best. So, if you have to have it or love it, replace it with this while it is around.If you have not watched these, Night of the Demons 3 is the worst of the three by far. It not only loses a lot of the effects that made the first two get, it doesn't even use the same home. In fact, the house looks like some place just outside of suburbia. added to that are things that bother me a bit, like the fact that Angela is somewhat nice, that kissing passes the demons into people but sex does not, and what ever happened to the theme of seven people getting infected before the end of Halloween?Granted, it is good to see Amelia Kinkade play Angela one more time. Even the choice of song for her to do a dance to in a sequel 9 years removed from the original makes me happy she was in it. Any flaws I would blame more on whoever wrote this than her. Also notable is Kris Holden-Reid, known for later roles like The Tutors, The Lost Girl, K-19, and droves of other films. He is the ""bad"" teen in the group and i love reviewing those early acting experiences.All said, this is not just a sequel but a 3rd installation so i do not know what a person really expects.
