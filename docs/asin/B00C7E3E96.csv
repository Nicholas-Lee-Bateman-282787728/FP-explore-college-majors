Both are broad comedies, possibly the two broadest comedies in Jackie's career (which is saying something).  Both were also made outside of Jackie's usual Hong Kong crew, and both display different aspects of his talents not shown in the movies he directed himself.  But otherwise these are two very different pictures.""Battle Creek Brawl' was Jackie's first attempt at an American crossover, hot on the heels of the cameos in the 'Cannonball Run' movies.  The same producer and director who worked with Bruce Lee made this, and expectations were high.  But the people behind the camera understood Jackie's talents and charm better than the general public of the time, it seems, and focused on comedy action instead of an intense martial arts.  Think of ""Every Which Way But Loose' style comedy, but with some Jackie Chan style mayhem sprinkled in.  Personally, I love the movie, which is painted in very broad strokes.  It is great to see Jackie challenged by gigantic men who look straight out of 1960's professional wrestling, complete with the tights and walrus mustaches.  Not to mention the roller derby!Broad stroked is also a way to describe 'City Hunter', a production where Jackie stepped in at the last minute as the lead.  It is based on a Japanese manga, and the mood of the movie is one long cartoon.  Every action is exaggerated, and in a way Jackie is perfect for the part, although I am personally glad he only went this far once in his career.  Still, it is great to see him over-the-top in his reaction shots.  And the fight at the end where fighters turn into video game characters is very very funny.  The movie is juvenile, and has more sexual innuendo and gun play that the norm for a JC film.  Still, with a couple of beers to help things flow along, the movie is pretty entertaining.In summation, neither film are essential viewing because both represent very different sides of Jackie's talents.  But both are funny, if very different, films, with tons of action.  They also have pretty good production values and look great on Blu-ray.  There are also a couple of neat extras, such as current interviews with the producer and co-star of 'Battle Creek Brawl', and some period interviews in Chinese for 'City Hunter'.  I enjoyed the hell out of both these films, and in a way they are strangely but well matched.",4,Jackie Chan At His Goofiest!,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,2468,"['twin', 'movies', 'contained', 'here', ""'Battle"", 'Creek', 'Brawl', ""'City"", 'Hunter', 'are', 'well', 'matched', 'even', 'are', 'decade', 'apart', 'are', 'broad', 'comedies', 'possibly', 'two', 'broadest', 'comedies', 'Jackie', 'career', 'saying', 'something', 'were', 'also', 'made', 'Jackie', 'usual', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'crew', 'display', 'different', 'aspects', 'talents', 'not', 'shown', 'movies', 'directed', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'pictures', 'Battle', 'Creek', 'Brawl', 'was', 'Jackie', 'first', 'attempt', 'American', 'crossover', 'hot', 'heels', 'cameos', ""'Cannonball"", 'Run', 'movies', 'same', 'producer', 'director', 'who', 'worked', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'made', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'people', 'camera', 'understood', 'Jackie', 'talents', 'charm', 'better', 'general', 'public', 'time', 'focused', 'comedy', 'action', 'instead', 'intense', 'martial', 'arts', 'Think', 'Every', 'Which', 'Way', 'Loose', 'style', 'comedy', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'style', 'mayhem', 'sprinkled', 'Personally', 'love', 'movie', 'painted', 'very', 'broad', 'strokes', 'great', 'see', 'Jackie', 'challenged', 'gigantic', 'men', 'who', 'look', 'straight', '1960', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'complete', 'tights', 'walrus', 'mustaches', 'Not', 'mention', 'roller', 'derby', 'Broad', 'stroked', 'also', 'way', 'describe', ""'City"", 'Hunter', 'production', 'where', 'Jackie', 'stepped', 'last', 'minute', 'lead', 'based', 'Japanese', 'manga', 'mood', 'movie', 'one', 'long', 'cartoon', 'action', 'exaggerated', 'way', 'Jackie', 'perfect', 'part', 'am', 'personally', 'glad', 'only', 'went', 'far', 'once', 'career', 'Still', 'great', 'see', 'over-the-top', 'reaction', 'shots', 'fight', 'end', 'where', 'fighters', 'turn', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'juvenile', 'more', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'gun', 'play', 'norm', 'JC', 'film', 'Still', 'couple', 'beers', 'help', 'things', 'flow', 'along', 'movie', 'pretty', 'entertaining.In', 'summation', 'film', 'are', 'essential', 'viewing', 'represent', 'very', 'different', 'sides', 'Jackie', 'talents', 'are', 'funny', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'tons', 'action', 'also', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'look', 'great', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'neat', 'extras', 'such', 'current', 'interviews', 'producer', 'co-star', ""'Battle"", 'Creek', 'Brawl', 'period', 'interviews', 'Chinese', ""'City"", 'Hunter', 'enjoyed', 'hell', 'films', 'way', 'are', 'strangely', 'well', 'matched']",Jackie Chan: Battle Creek Brawl / City Hunter

1643954,A1QG8GVTRVGW19,B00C7E3E96,Joe the Anime Fan,"[0, 0]","Battle Creek Brawl... isn't a very good movie, not to me anyways, and not by Jackie Chan standards.  Which is strange, because it has a lot of the telltale signs of the sort of Jackie Chan movie I'd enjoy --- lots of action sequences, humor, etc.  But I think what hurts it is the humor is sometimes a little too silly in an unfunny way, and the action sequences aren't terribly clever or well choreographed (from the director's commentary it seems the American production team had a completely different approach to the action scenes --- in Hong Kong they might spend days or weeks to get one fight scene to look right, but in America they did a couple of takes and that was it).  The story was kind of ho-hum, and felt like it dragged out in parts.  It's not a forgettable film, but it wasn't very enjoyable either.City Hunter on the other hand!  It has the Street Fighter parody scene, where Jackie cosplays as various Street Fighters, and even a drag version of Chun Li!  That alone brings the strength of the package up by a whole lot.  As for the movie itself well, it's very silly, bordering on cartoonish at times, but in a way that's actually charming and fun to watch.  That might be a turn off for some people, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's a very campy movie, originally based on a Japanese manga, and I thought it was pretty good, not one of Jackie's best films, but not one of his worst either.Overall it's good DVD to have I think if just for City Hunter, and Battle Creek Brawl is at least interesting to see one of Jackie's early American works.",4,"City Hunter's pretty good, Battle Creek Brawl is so-so",1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,1577,"['Battle', 'Creek', 'Brawl', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'anyways', 'not', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'standards', 'Which', 'strange', 'lot', 'telltale', 'signs', 'sort', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'lots', 'action', 'sequences', 'humor', 'etc', 'think', 'what', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'silly', 'unfunny', 'way', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'clever', 'well', 'choreographed', 'director', 'commentary', 'American', 'production', 'team', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'approach', 'action', 'scenes', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'might', 'spend', 'days', 'weeks', 'get', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'look', 'right', 'America', 'did', 'couple', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'kind', 'ho-hum', 'felt', 'dragged', 'out', 'parts', 'not', 'forgettable', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'enjoyable', 'either.City', 'Hunter', 'other', 'hand', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'parody', 'scene', 'where', 'Jackie', 'various', 'Street', 'Fighters', 'even', 'drag', 'version', 'Chun', 'Li', 'alone', 'strength', 'package', 'up', 'whole', 'lot', 'movie', 'well', 'very', 'silly', 'bordering', 'cartoonish', 'times', 'way', 'actually', 'charming', 'fun', 'watch', 'might', 'be', 'turn', 'off', 'people', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'very', 'campy', 'movie', 'originally', 'based', 'Japanese', 'manga', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'one', 'Jackie', 'best', 'films', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'either.Overall', 'good', 'DVD', 'have', 'think', 'just', 'City', 'Hunter', 'Battle', 'Creek', 'Brawl', 'least', 'interesting', 'see', 'one', 'Jackie', 'early', 'American', 'works']",Jackie Chan: Battle Creek Brawl / City Hunter
