Henry wakes up to go to work, then he's at the hospital the next morning.  The time frame is distorted, making the fact that the movie is only about a 24-hour segment virtually unknown.&quot;The Paper: A behind-the-lines look at work, marriage and other forms of combat.&quot;&quot;The Paper&quot; is about Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton), the metro editor at the New York Sun.  His wife Martha (Marisa Tomei) is eight and a half months pregnant with their child.  She also worked at the Sun before she went on maternity leave. Bernie White (Robert Duvall) is the editor of the Sun, who wants to reconnect with his daughter after receiving some bad news.  Alicia Clark (Glenn Close) is the managing editor, who has lost touch with journalisic integrity since she was promoted. Mike McDougal (Randy Quaid) is a columnist, who claims that the parking commissioner is out to kill him.The movie begins with two white business men being murdered and their car spray painted with racial slurs.  Two young African-American boys are seen, but run after a woman screams thinking they did it.  The Sun's rival paper has it as a cover story while the Sun runs a story about the parking commissioner.Henry has an interview with the Sentinel, but steals their lead story.  The job was his, but he tells them he has to think about it, and to talk to his wife first.In the midst of following the information he got from the Sentinel, the boys from the crime scene are arrested.  Henry and McDougal get a cop to comment that they aren't guilty because there isn't any evidence.When Henry and McDougal get back to the Sun office to write up the story and get it in tomorrow's issue, the presses start.  Henry and Alicia fight to stop the presses, he stops them, but she fires him and the presses start again.After McDougal's car gets towed, he and Alicia go out for drinks. She wants to know what Henry meant when he told her that she'd become everything she used to hate.  McDougal explained that she never would run anything that she knew wasn't true.As Alicia calls to stop the presses, the parking commissioner is in the same bar and starts a fight with McDougal, yelling that he is going to kill him.  When they talk the parking commissioner (Jason Alexander) into not kills McDougal, he fires at the wall.  Alicia is on the other side of the wall and gets shot.Henry goes home to find cop cars and an ambulance in front of his apartment building. He asks the doorman what happened and he said the paramedics went up to his apartment. Martha is hemorraging and the baby is in trouble.Alicia declines to sign the consent form for surgery until she can use the phone. She calls to stop the press and runs Henry and McDougal's story that clears the two young ment. Martha has an emergency C-section. She and the baby boy are fine. Bernie goes to his daughter's house and sees that she is married with a baby.",4,I don't live in the world.

Yes, I saw ONE movie eight times in the movie theater, but the thing is I never got sick of it. I'm already a bit biased given Michael Keaton is my all time favorite actor, but I love this movie for so many more reasons. The acting by Michael, Marisa Tomei, Robert Duval, Randy Quaid and Glen Glose is just exceptional, and Ron Howards directing is on the mark as always.There are also some good cameos by the late William Kunstler and Jason Robards. There's also a hillarious cameo by Bob Costas which I won't give away, you've just gotta see it:)Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) has a grueling job as an editor at The New York Sun (my guess being it's supposed to be a ficitional verison of The New York Post judging by such front page headlines as &quot;No Parking Except For Me&quot; and &quot;Gotcha&quot;) that usually keeps him from his wife nine months pregnant wife Martha (Marisa Tomei) 24/7, so she's pressuring him to get a cushier job at The New York Sentinal (fictional version of The New York Times based on their mantra of &quot;We Cover The World.&quot;) Henry of course doesn't want to be out of the action that makes him down Cokes and Tums all day, and finds himself subconsciously sabatoging the interview in the pursuit of finding out the truth behind a grizzly murder and exonerate the two boys arrested for the murder whom he knows in his gut are innocent. The movie takes place during these twenty four hours; from battling with bosses, to fights, to shootings to a father trying to make ammends with his daughter he neglected; this movie shows a day in the life of five people as they try to find the truth behind the murder and the truth about their lifes.

And, of course, the absolute passion so many journalists have for the field despite it all.The climax of the film is the only moment it goes off the rails, in terms of realism. Printing presses kill and maim people, and the ability to stop the press dead is not restricted to one person with a key. By the time such a person could be located and the key obtained, an accident victim would be dead and the paper would be liable.But other than that rather slapsticky moment, ""The Paper"" is a fantastically accurate film, although it's wryly amusing in 2011 to see a newspaper on the verge of bankruptcy without anyone ever cursing the Internet as a contributing cause.Recommended for students, practitioners and fans of journalism in all its rumpled glory.",4,Solid and accurate newspaper movie,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1357,"[""'ve"", 'worked', 'professional', 'journalist', '1992', 'film', 'flaws', 'only', 'one', 'case', 'flaw', 'related', 'depiction', 'journalism', 'movie', 'Paper', 'absolutely', 'men', 'women', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'tabloid', 'accurately', 'fairly', 'warts', 'commitment', 'getting', 'first', 'seemingly', 'cavalier', 'attitude', 'bad', 'news', 'coverage', 'area', 'destructive', 'nature', 'job', 'relationships', 'low', 'pay', 'long', 'hours', 'adversarial', 'relationship', 'many', 'public', 'officials', 'middling-at-best', 'respect', 'public', 'course', 'absolute', 'passion', 'so', 'many', 'journalists', 'have', 'field', 'climax', 'film', 'only', 'moment', 'rails', 'terms', 'realism', 'Printing', 'presses', 'kill', 'maim', 'people', 'ability', 'stop', 'press', 'dead', 'not', 'restricted', 'one', 'person', 'key', 'time', 'such', 'person', 'could', 'be', 'located', 'key', 'obtained', 'accident', 'victim', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'paper', 'would', 'be', 'liable.But', 'other', 'rather', 'slapsticky', 'moment', 'Paper', 'fantastically', 'accurate', 'film', 'wryly', 'amusing', '2011', 'see', 'newspaper', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'anyone', 'ever', 'cursing', 'Internet', 'contributing', 'cause.Recommended', 'students', 'practitioners', 'fans', 'journalism', 'rumpled', 'glory']",N/A

Done much like the old TV series ""St Elsewhere"", with the cutting back and forth between characters, that has become so popular today.  In 1994 it was more cutting edge. ""City of Hope"" was also in this style, although with much more substance. A lot gets packed into 24 hours in the life of these people.  I particularly enjoyed Randy Quaid's character here.  Many of the others seemed to be playing types, rather than real people, but for this kind of script, with no pretensions of meaning, that's OK.  It was action-packed, never a dull moment.  I did thing Spalding Grey not good, as I think he has been in everything I've seen him in, which is odd, as his stage show was nothing short of fabulous.  A great talent will be missed.  Perhaps the film medium was just not suited to him.  There was also a continuity break in the scene where Marisa Tomai is having a drink with some guy.

47461,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0783219571,Cubist,"[14, 20]","Ron Howard isn't the most dynamic of directors -- his style is pretty vanilla and he hasn't picked the greatest projects in the world (i.e. Ransom) but he was right on the money with The Paper. While he tends to cram a little too much into one day -- nobody has that exciting a day -- you have to give him a bit of artistic license -- it is a movie after all.Michael Keaton is well-cast as the big city paper editor with too much on his plate. He can do the manic side of his character (see, well, any movie he's ever done) and he's also up for the serious stuff too. Obviously, he must enjoy playing a journalist as he did a great job as one in Live From Baghdad as well.The cast is what makes this film work so well. Aside from Keaton, the other real stand-out is Randy Quaid as a fellow reporter and friend. For years now, Quaid as been typecast in dumb guy roles. It so refreshing to see him actually play an intelligent, street savvy reporter in this film. He gets all the great lines and steals all the scenes he's in. The film really kicks into gear when he and Keaton team-up to blow the lid off of a high profile story. I'd love to see these guys do another film together.While the film does get a tad on the preachy, idealistic side, it still is a very entertaining look at working on a major newspaper in New York City. It's a shame that the DVD is such a letdown. No extras and pan and scanned. Ugh. However, Opie seems to be revisiting his films on DVD with new special editions (i.e. Splash, Ransom).

This tabloid-styled commuter paper is just large enough to need to be seriously professional, while also being just small enough for that serious professionalism to be virtually impossible to accomplish.Unless you are a journalist for the type of 'paper of record' which the film satirizes in the form of the stuffy, rival &quot;Sentinal&quot; (clearly modelled on the NY Times), &quot;The Paper&quot; will yield much of its humour from its high realism.&quot;The Paper&quot; covers a single day in the implosively pressurized life of a reporter (Michael Keaton) who also happens to adore his job.  The dynamism generated by the wise-guy supporting cast (which includes Randy Quaid, Roma Mafia, and Robert Duvall) makes it easy to understand why journalism is not a profession so much as an addiction.  What would make a saner and more timid employee flee for the hills, produces a soaring high to the seasoned journalist.  As Keaton's wife (Marisa Tomei), hugely pregnant and stuck on leave, exclaims after a gunshot is suddenly fired in a news office: &quot;God I love this place&quot;.Virtually every line spoken in the newspaper office is beautifully snide and worth catching, so keep the remote control close at hand.The genuinely crazed encounters between Keaton and Glenn Close, playing a penny-pinching, ethically-challenged manager whose need to respect a deadline collides with Keaton's eleventh-hour attempt to produce an accurate and ennobling story, contribute strongly to an overall comedic masterpiece.Though the journalistically-inclined will get a special kick from &quot;The Paper&quot;, its appeal should be nearly universal, such is delerious wit of its dialogue and the thrill of its frenetic pacing.",5,An hilarious look at workings of a semi-reputable paper,971740800,"10 17, 2000",2000,1893,"['quot', 'Paper', 'quot', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', '1990s', 'providing', 'extraordinarily', 'realistic', 'view', 'behind-the-scenes', 'dys', 'function', 'newspaper', 'office', 'tabloid-styled', 'commuter', 'paper', 'just', 'large', 'enough', 'need', 'be', 'seriously', 'professional', 'also', 'being', 'just', 'small', 'enough', 'serious', 'professionalism', 'be', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'accomplish.Unless', 'are', 'journalist', 'type', ""'paper"", 'record', 'film', 'form', 'stuffy', 'rival', 'quot', 'Sentinal', 'quot', 'clearly', 'modelled', 'NY', 'Times', 'quot', 'Paper', 'quot', 'will', 'yield', 'much', 'humour', 'high', 'realism.', 'quot', 'Paper', 'quot', 'single', 'day', 'implosively', 'pressurized', 'life', 'reporter', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'who', 'also', 'adore', 'job', 'dynamism', 'generated', 'wise-guy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Roma', 'Mafia', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'journalism', 'not', 'profession', 'so', 'much', 'addiction', 'What', 'would', 'make', 'saner', 'more', 'timid', 'employee', 'flee', 'hills', 'soaring', 'high', 'seasoned', 'journalist', 'Keaton', 'wife', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'hugely', 'pregnant', 'stuck', 'leave', 'gunshot', 'suddenly', 'fired', 'news', 'office', 'quot', 'God', 'love', 'place', 'quot', '.Virtually', 'line', 'spoken', 'newspaper', 'office', 'beautifully', 'snide', 'worth', 'catching', 'so', 'keep', 'remote', 'control', 'close', 'hand.The', 'genuinely', 'crazed', 'encounters', 'Keaton', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'playing', 'penny-pinching', 'ethically-challenged', 'manager', 'need', 'respect', 'deadline', 'Keaton', 'eleventh-hour', 'attempt', 'produce', 'accurate', 'ennobling', 'story', 'contribute', 'strongly', 'overall', 'comedic', 'journalistically-inclined', 'will', 'get', 'special', 'kick', 'quot', 'Paper', 'quot', 'appeal', 'should', 'be', 'nearly', 'universal', 'such', 'delerious', 'wit', 'dialogue', 'thrill', 'frenetic', 'pacing']",N/A

It shows with some realism the hectic life journalism leads to. To be a journalist is to have a completely crazy life in which family, friends, regularity are dreams you cannot in any way respect or just entertain. That kind of atmosphere has already been shown and used in other films. But this film insists on the social, moral and human responsibility that a journalist must live for and with : never tell something that is not true if you know it is not true, in one word you must never lie. You might be wrong, misinformed or many other things but what you publish you must believe - and even know - it is the truth. Then to pair this fight for journalistic ethics to the birth of one's own son or child, is a marvellous idea. For a journalist it is the most important and most exhilarating fact in life to be told his or her article is the truth, especially if it enables two young black teenagers to be freed and exonerated from a false accusation. This kind of film should be shown to all our young people for them to learn that what is important in life is not money, nor what they believe in or think, but only what is true, and that a man must be absolutely free to tell the truth, all the truth, nothing but the truth.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne",4,Never let a good story get in the way of the truth!,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,1395,"['probably', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'good', 'film', 'realism', 'hectic', 'life', 'journalism', 'be', 'journalist', 'have', 'completely', 'crazy', 'life', 'family', 'friends', 'regularity', 'are', 'can', 'not', 'way', 'respect', 'just', 'entertain', 'kind', 'atmosphere', 'already', 'been', 'shown', 'used', 'other', 'films', 'film', 'social', 'moral', 'human', 'responsibility', 'journalist', 'must', 'live', 'never', 'tell', 'something', 'not', 'true', 'know', 'not', 'true', 'one', 'word', 'must', 'never', 'lie', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', 'misinformed', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'what', 'publish', 'must', 'believe', 'even', 'know', 'truth', 'Then', 'pair', 'fight', 'journalistic', 'ethics', 'birth', 'one', 'own', 'son', 'child', 'marvellous', 'idea', 'journalist', 'most', 'important', 'most', 'exhilarating', 'fact', 'life', 'be', 'told', 'article', 'truth', 'especially', 'two', 'young', 'black', 'teenagers', 'be', 'freed', 'exonerated', 'false', 'accusation', 'kind', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'young', 'people', 'learn', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'not', 'money', 'what', 'believe', 'think', 'only', 'what', 'true', 'man', 'must', 'be', 'absolutely', 'free', 'tell', 'truth', 'truth', 'nothing', 'truth.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Panth', 'eacute', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

The cast is first-rate and the individual performances good, at times excellent (Close, Duvall, Tomei); the main theme of the story is interesting, as are the sub-plots; Ron Howard's direction is of the high quality audiences would expect; and the settings are authentically New York, appropriate for a ""newspaper"" flick.  So, why doesn't it all work any better than it does?One reason is that the individual scenes have greater dramatic impact than the complete film does. At times, the scenes appear to have been taken from different films and pasted together into this one.Robert Duvall's attempts to reestablish contact with his estranged daughter - an angry woman if ever there was one - are both touching and unsettling.  The restaurant scene with Michael Keaton and Marisa Tomei presents a detailed, albeit quick, portrait of their complex relationship, although Keaton's out-of-body experience seemed out-of-keeping with the overall tone of the film.  The newspaper editorial staff meeting provides opportunity for several of the supporting characters to distinguish themselves.  Tomei's solo screen time is excellent and the Keaton/Close knock-down, drag-out fight on the catwalk by the presses is genuinely frightening.But, the drama in these scenes does not carry over to the film as a whole.  Since each of these story elements receives almost equal attention, the main thread of the story - whether or not the paper will effect the fate of the accused man - does not take center stage.  With the film's focus shifted to the struggles among the people who think they hold the accused's fate in their hands, the audience does not have an opportunity to empathize with the accused himself.In the theatre, this lack of empathy can make the whole venture fall flat.  Fortunately, with the DVD format, one can re-watch his favorite scenes without investing time repeating the entire film.

47483,A22WUL3S5Q7OGC,0783219571,"""rukahsatc""","[2, 2]","This wasn't a bad film, in my view, 3 stars is still ok, just shows it is a slightly above average film.  As stated in other reviews, the cast was just about top notch and contains many popular names, along with Keaton playing the main role.  It's a day in the life of a New York City newspaper (not the major one however), and shows the challanges and decisions papers must face each day, and for that it creates interest and suspense for the viewer because it is done in an often times comical way.However, perhaps my problem with this is that there are no redeeming qualities that put this film &quot;over the edge&quot;.  It's entertaining and worth watching, but, don't expect it to change your life or anything.  I should point out however, the brilliant performance by often overlooked, Marisa Tomei, she shines in this film and actually makes the relationship between her and Keaton actually seem believable, when otherwise it wouldn't.  For her performance, it puts it just over average and deserves 3 stars.On a side note, perhaps I am just overlooking this film because of the age gap between me and the movie, many of the members of the cast are stars from a different generation and it is hard for me to relate, as a 21 year old, to some of them.

It takes you into the life of print journalism and gets you involved into the everyday life of news writers and the stress they encounter on a day-to-day basis.  Leading the way is Michael Keaton as the hot-shot news writer who's contemplating changing companies to further his status and make the extra buck.  He's supported by a great cast of veteran actors who each have a distinct personality that you'll either love or hate.  Now that's acting!  The great thing about this movie is that it's set in real time like show's like 24 and whatnot.
