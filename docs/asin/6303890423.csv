387220,A2US19GW0001Q2,6303890423,Cynthia Middleton,"[0, 0]","Let me first start by saying I haven't seen all of Julia Roberts movies; but on advice I watched this one on a movie channel several years ago and found it extremely believable. I personally know people like those depicted in this feature, especially the character of Aunt Rea played beautifully by Anne Shropshire (The Green Card, Tootsie, The First Wives Club and As the World Turns).Adultery and the poisoning of one's philandering husband, isn't comical; but both take place within the span of the movie, and the characters are so understandably human one has to give them a pass.There are several story lines, first Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid, Rowlands and Duvall, owners of a prominent riding stable, and Duvall and Muse Watson, trainer of a Jumper, something for everyone.Kyra Sedgwick is the sister every woman would love to have; Brett Cullen (Houston native and childhood friend of Dennis Quaid) serves as the respectable, almost lover of Julia's as he refuses to take advantage of her apparent inebriation. Gena Rowlands and Robert Duvall bring just as much cunning and hilarity as do Roberts and Quaid.In my opinion one of the best and most truthful scenes takes place @ the party following the competition held @ their horse farm; Julia and Dennis dance to ""I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)"" and you see the ice beginning to thaw between them which sets the scene for the healing of their relationship.Not one of her more prominent movies; but I think one of her best, I highly recommend it.A Post Script: There is profanity; and a few key scenes may prove too mature for some younger audiences. I would suggest anyone purchasing this that has young children to watch it first, before the family sits down for movie night, but in all honesty I wouldn't categorize this as family friendly.",5,A True Southern Feel Good Movie,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,1816,"['Let', 'first', 'start', 'saying', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'movies', 'advice', 'watched', 'one', 'movie', 'channel', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'extremely', 'believable', 'personally', 'know', 'people', 'depicted', 'feature', 'especially', 'character', 'Aunt', 'Rea', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Anne', 'Shropshire', 'Green', 'Card', 'Tootsie', 'First', 'Club', 'World', 'Turns', '.Adultery', 'poisoning', 'one', 'philandering', 'husband', ""n't"", 'comical', 'take', 'place', 'span', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'understandably', 'human', 'one', 'give', 'pass.There', 'are', 'several', 'story', 'lines', 'first', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Rowlands', 'Duvall', 'owners', 'prominent', 'riding', 'stable', 'Duvall', 'Muse', 'Watson', 'trainer', 'Jumper', 'something', 'everyone.Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'sister', 'woman', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'Brett', 'Cullen', 'Houston', 'native', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'respectable', 'almost', 'lover', 'Julia', 'take', 'advantage', 'apparent', 'inebriation', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'bring', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'cunning', 'hilarity', 'do', 'Roberts', 'Quaid.In', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'truthful', 'scenes', 'place', '@', 'party', 'following', 'competition', 'held', '@', 'horse', 'farm', 'Julia', 'Dennis', 'dance', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Help', 'Myself', 'Sugar', 'Pie', 'Honey', 'Bunch', 'see', 'ice', 'beginning', 'thaw', 'scene', 'healing', 'relationship.Not', 'one', 'more', 'prominent', 'movies', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.A', 'Post', 'Script', 'profanity', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'may', 'prove', 'too', 'mature', 'younger', 'audiences', 'would', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'purchasing', 'young', 'children', 'watch', 'first', 'family', 'down', 'movie', 'night', 'honesty', 'would', ""n't"", 'categorize', 'family', 'friendly']",Something to Talk About VHS

387226,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303890423,Dennis Littrell,"[17, 19]","Director Lasse Hallstrom attempts to combine two venerable Hollywood genres and several subplots in this nonetheless agreeable morality tale about the bad effect adultery can have on your marriage.  Part women's POV romantic comedy and part Dixie family dynamics saga, this is a generational story about what it takes to make a marriage work.  It's a little scattered and loose fitting and underdeveloped in parts, but there's enough warmth and bright comedy to make up for the defects, and the cast is fun to watch.The script by Callie Khouri is familiar but clever with some good human observations and some nice twists.  I notice that Khouri also wrote Thelma and Louise (1991), which may explain why, in this flick, it is the men who learn (and need) most of the hard lessons.  Robert Duvall plays the still feisty patriarch, Wlyly King, who really needs to learn to loosen the reigns a little, while Dennis Quaid, who plays Grace's adulterous husband, needs to appreciate what he's got and to stop catting around.  Kyra Sedgwick as Grace's sister helps him by kneeing him right where it hurts the most, and Grace, accidentally on purpose, nearly poisons him.  (All part of his well-deserved and to be continued penance.)  Sedgwick sparkles while being careful not to upstage ""America's Darling"" too often while Gena Rowlands as the mother is steady and sure.Julia Roberts has become a great star and a great actress, and she is one of my favorites, but there is no question that she felt not entirely comfortable in this part.  From the details of the script you can see that she is supposed to be a somewhat ditzy and naively outspoken woman, a southern belle with spunk, a mind of her own, and a desire to be something more than her father's daughter or her husband's wife.  Julia got most of it right except for the ditzy part.  She either wouldn't bend (maybe her agency advised against looking too weird) or Hallstrom didn't insist because Julia played this like Bogart always played Bogart, just like herself.  You can see that the character of Grace Bichon is a bit out in left field because she leaves her daughter places or forgets to take her as she drives off in the morning.  And then there was that outrageous confrontation at the woman's club where she stands up and demands to know how many other women have been sleeping with her husband.  Something to talk about indeed!But Julia stays Julia, and so the character is never developed as written.  Nonetheless Julia Roberts is always wonderful, and although there is not here the effortless and nearly flawless style she was then developing, a style that culminated in her Oscar winning performance in Erin Brockovich, there is the undeniable down to earth charm and warmth that has made her so beloved by audiences that she can command something like twenty million dollars per.Robert Duvall obviously had a lot of fun with his part, but I wonder if he realizes how much he looks like a bantam rooster in those riding tights!--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",3,Familiar but pleasing nonetheless,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,3094,"['Director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'attempts', 'combine', 'two', 'venerable', 'Hollywood', 'genres', 'several', 'subplots', 'nonetheless', 'agreeable', 'morality', 'tale', 'bad', 'effect', 'adultery', 'can', 'have', 'marriage', 'Part', 'women', 'POV', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'part', 'Dixie', 'family', 'dynamics', 'saga', 'generational', 'story', 'what', 'make', 'marriage', 'work', 'little', 'scattered', 'loose', 'fitting', 'underdeveloped', 'parts', 'enough', 'warmth', 'bright', 'comedy', 'make', 'up', 'defects', 'cast', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'script', 'Callie', 'Khouri', 'familiar', 'clever', 'good', 'human', 'observations', 'nice', 'twists', 'notice', 'Khouri', 'also', 'wrote', 'Thelma', 'Louise', '1991', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'flick', 'men', 'who', 'learn', 'need', 'most', 'hard', 'lessons', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'still', 'feisty', 'patriarch', 'Wlyly', 'King', 'who', 'really', 'learn', 'loosen', 'reigns', 'little', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'Grace', 'adulterous', 'husband', 'appreciate', 'what', 'got', 'stop', 'catting', 'around', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Grace', 'sister', 'kneeing', 'right', 'where', 'most', 'Grace', 'accidentally', 'purpose', 'nearly', 'poisons', 'part', 'well-deserved', 'be', 'continued', 'penance', 'Sedgwick', 'sparkles', 'being', 'careful', 'not', 'upstage', 'America', 'Darling', 'too', 'often', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'mother', 'steady', 'sure.Julia', 'Roberts', 'become', 'great', 'star', 'great', 'actress', 'one', 'favorites', 'question', 'felt', 'not', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'part', 'details', 'script', 'can', 'see', 'supposed', 'be', 'somewhat', 'ditzy', 'naively', 'outspoken', 'woman', 'southern', 'belle', 'spunk', 'mind', 'own', 'desire', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'father', 'daughter', 'husband', 'wife', 'Julia', 'got', 'most', 'right', 'ditzy', 'part', 'would', ""n't"", 'bend', 'maybe', 'agency', 'advised', 'looking', 'too', 'weird', 'Hallstrom', 'did', ""n't"", 'insist', 'Julia', 'played', 'like', 'Bogart', 'always', 'played', 'Bogart', 'just', 'can', 'see', 'character', 'Grace', 'Bichon', 'bit', 'out', 'left', 'field', 'daughter', 'places', 'forgets', 'take', 'off', 'morning', 'then', 'was', 'outrageous', 'confrontation', 'woman', 'club', 'where', 'up', 'demands', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'women', 'have', 'been', 'sleeping', 'husband', 'Something', 'talk', 'indeed', 'Julia', 'Julia', 'so', 'character', 'never', 'developed', 'written', 'Nonetheless', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'always', 'wonderful', 'not', 'here', 'effortless', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'style', 'was', 'then', 'developing', 'style', 'culminated', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'undeniable', 'down', 'earth', 'charm', 'warmth', 'made', 'so', 'beloved', 'audiences', 'can', 'command', 'something', 'twenty', 'million', 'dollars', 'per.Robert', 'Duvall', 'obviously', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'part', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'bantam', 'rooster', 'riding', 'tights', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",Something to Talk About VHS

This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives!  Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and  Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles.One of the most entertaining aspects of this entertaining film is the confrontation between 'old manners' and new reality - with some heady lessons for all of us to observe and allow chuckles.

It's a funny story about a woman who finds out her husband is cheating on her and let's everyone in her circle of so called friends know she knows all about their affairs and those of their husbands and does it quite publically.  Dennis Quaid as her husband does a good job in the role of the unfaithful  husband and shows his comedy side well.  Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands as her parents have issues of their own but both believe Grace ( Julia) should stay with her husband.  Kyra Sedgwick plays Grace's sister and does so with gusto.

Andersen ""redheaded booklover""","[5, 7]","If you love this movie or think the pairing of Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid (I really do like both of them) sounds like a great movie, you should stop reading right now..okay, you were warned.The movie appears to be set in the 1990's but the way the characters act, you'd think it was maybe the late 50s or early 60s.  But the language is definitely 1990s language (and foul). One example of the weird era is a meeting the main character attends, where the women are arguing whether to have their name listed as (for example) Mrs Schmoe Herschovitz as opposed to Juanita Herschovitz in a cookbook. One woman argues people wouldn't know who she was if her first name was listed as the recope writer. All I could think of was ""What? in the 1990s?"" And spare me the ""Southern Belle"" bit - I know some ""Southern Belles"" and truly, ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned""...Julia Roberts plays Grace an emotionally cold woman who stews over her dream of being a large animal vet going sour after becoming pregnant and getting married. It's not quite clear who stopped her from finisheing vet school, perhaps pregnant women weren't allowed in college at that time. Didn't they have birth control at that time? She marries Dennis Quaid, whose college nickname was ""Hound Dog"" apparently because he likes the ladies.Because Grace doesn't finish her last year at vet school, she is forced to work at her father's horse ranch, which he runs as a dictatorship. Somewhere along the way, Grace sees her husband kissing another woman in public.  She also catches him at a bar with the woman as well as his friends. She leaves & goes back to her parents.Her father advises her to make nice because apparently in that era, whenever it was, men were expected to fool around on their wives and wives were supposed to accept it.  He has a buisness deal with the son-in-law's family and he wants everything to go smoothly.Grace stirs up a tiny bit of trouble, based on what she finds out from her ""friends"" (that have had sex with Grace's husband) and following the advice of the ""crazy aunt"". But there's no real payoff. Of course, it's Grace's fault that hubby cheated - she was cold and distant. Why she is distant is never discussed. And besides, hubby states it really wasn't that much fun to fool around on his wife.  _right_ I guess he just forced himself to do it because - well, that's never answered, either.There's more stuff that goes on, but I kept wondering why. Of course, one amazing dance on the dance makes them fall back in love with each other again. Grace goes back to finish vet school. Hubby stops messing around on her.  Everything is hunky dory....Besides the lack of sympathetic characters, the huge lips on the stars seem to get in the way of the acting. All my husband could do is notice the lips. All I could think of what a waste of time this movie was. I wanted to smack almost everybody and tell them to grow up.So as you can tell, I'm going to end this review with a ""do not watch"" recommendation.

I suggest skipping it unless you really love Julia Roberts, horses or marriages that almost fail but don't.  It's not worth seeing for Quaid or Duval.  The younger Robert Duval is my favorite male actor (To Kill A Mocking Bird, The Great Santini, Apocalypse Now), but nowadays he seems to have lost his dramatic power.  (And  Dennis Quaid's hair seems to be auditioning for a role as a winter quilt.)Robert Duval plays the owner of a ranch operation somewhere in the south, where he raises and trains show horses.  Julia Roberts plays his daughter.  She works for dad, managing the stables.  Dennis Quaid plays her husband.  Julia discovers that her husband has been cheating on her.  In the course of being furious and ashamed, she discovers that he has slept with a number of women in town, all of whom she knows.At the office, Julia discusses her problems over the phone with a friend but uses a speakerphone and is overheard.  He husband has a consultation over lunch at a restaurant, with the meanest divorce lawyer in town.  The whole town is talking.  Dennis Quaid apologizes to Julia, very insincerely.  Julia's friends convince her to put up with it, forgive and take him back.  Spontaneously, in the end, without any catharsis or precipitation, husband and wife dance together to the song, ""Let's Give Them Something To Talk About.""  This is what passes fro reconciliation.  Presumably everyone lives happily ever after.  It was all just too easy.",3,"Moves Along But It's a Little Light, a Little Bland",1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,1515,"['along', 'little', 'light', 'little', 'bland', 'suggest', 'skipping', 'really', 'love', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'almost', 'fail', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Quaid', 'Duval', 'younger', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'favorite', 'male', 'actor', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mocking', 'Bird', 'Great', 'Santini', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'nowadays', 'have', 'lost', 'dramatic', 'power', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'hair', 'be', 'auditioning', 'role', 'winter', 'quilt', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'owner', 'ranch', 'operation', 'somewhere', 'south', 'where', 'show', 'horses', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'daughter', 'dad', 'managing', 'stables', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'husband', 'Julia', 'husband', 'been', 'cheating', 'course', 'being', 'furious', 'ashamed', 'slept', 'number', 'women', 'town', 'whom', 'knows.At', 'office', 'Julia', 'problems', 'phone', 'friend', 'speakerphone', 'overheard', 'husband', 'consultation', 'lunch', 'restaurant', 'meanest', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'town', 'whole', 'town', 'talking', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Julia', 'very', 'insincerely', 'Julia', 'friends', 'convince', 'put', 'up', 'forgive', 'take', 'back', 'Spontaneously', 'end', 'catharsis', 'precipitation', 'husband', 'wife', 'dance', 'together', 'song', 'Let', 'Give', 'Them', 'Something', 'Talk', 'what', 'fro', 'reconciliation', 'Presumably', 'everyone', 'happily', 'ever', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'easy']",Something to Talk About VHS
