Sure enough, two years later, audiences were treated to a second outing with the ""Wolf Pack,"" namely Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug. If you've heard or read anything about the movie, you know that the typical summary offered is ""It's pretty much the same as the first one, except that it takes place in Thailand."" This time around, it's Stu who's getting married, so the gang travels back to his fiancee's homeland for the festivities, and again, it's Alan who inadvertently brings about another forgotten night of mayhem that the fellas must piece together the day after. What the first movie had going for it -- namely, the element of surprise and a sense of joyful mayhem -- is largely missing from this sequel, which sports raunchier jokes and a much darker tone.

1402828,AUJFO0J9A2HGE,B004EPZ06G,Alcee Arobin,"[1, 1]","I should state from the get-go that I was not the biggest fan of the first film.  I thought it was reasonably funny, but never understood the mass appeal.  Or rather, I did (I was in college when the first film came out), but it still didn't impress me all that much.  That said, when I checked the Amazon reviews a few weeks ago, I thought that surely people were exaggerating their criticisms of Part II.  Most of the complaints seemed to be about the unoriginality of the script.  And, yes, it follows the original premise almost completely:  Ed Helms sings a song about halfway through, and it ends with incriminating photos discovered on a phone.  Oh, those crazy cell phone pics.But none of that bothers me.  It's a franchise about hangovers - the options aren't so numerous.  The real problem is that the film is just lame.  Really lame.  The performances feel completely telegraphed, so I think even the actors might have agreed.  Nobody is looking for Shakespearean depth in a flick with a cigarette smoking monkey, but signs that they're actually interested in their lines wouldn't hurt.In short: the attempts at outlandish humor result more often in eye rolls than laughs.  It's all so tired, and there is a complete lack of new ideas.  The movie is at its most pathetic when the writers finally just have one of the characters get shot.  Sure, why not?  That's funny, right?!  The first film made a gazillion dollars, and now all involved have decided to ride this cash cow for all it's worth.  Part III is due out in 2013, and I'm sure it will pull in the big bucks, too.  (Aside: is it any surprise that America's favorite sitcoms are the Chuck Lorre dreck on CBS?)I give it two stars for the soundtrack and Mike Tyson, who deserved better material.

Just to add a little much needed support to the now-thin concept the director throws in a monkey who goes everywhere with these immature duds. This might work in a circus or with an organ grinder, but in a movie we get tired of the monkey after two minutes.

Once again the wolf pack (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galafranakas) find themselves hung-over after a wild night of partying (this time in Thailand) and working to figure out what happened. I could spend more time discussing the plot, but if you've seen the first film, then you've seen this one. The jokes are essentially the same, but the laughs are few and far between. The movie does seem to be striving to be cruder than the first, but it falls flat in that respect as well. Even the cast doesn't seem to be having as much fun this time around.If you saw the first movie, skip this one since it is merely a faded copy of the much funnier original.

1402876,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPZ06G,C. Sawin,"[6, 13]","Most people seem to really enjoy The Hangover. It wouldn't be the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time if they didn't, right? The movie also has a fairly solid reputation, as well; certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes along with above average scores just about everywhere else you look. With that said, it's better as a standalone film. Pushing another Hangover film onto the masses would water down and lessen the impact of what made the first film entertaining. The Hangover Part II proves just that and illustrates what a film made solely for money and nothing more really is.I felt like I missed out for not seeing the original film in theaters. Due to how often I laughed out loud during its duration, it certainly seemed to warrant a theatrical viewing. With the sequel's release upon us, it seemed like an easy solution. But promotion for the sequel made me feel weary. Trailers pretty much let everybody know that audiences would be sitting through the exact same film again. As it turns out, it is. The Hangover Part II is probably about 90% the same film as The Hangover.A few things are changed in comparison to the first film: there's a drug dealing monkey instead of a tiger, Stu gets a tattoo instead of losing a tooth, Alan loses his hair instead of his pants, they're in Thailand instead of Vegas, Jamie Chung replaces Heather Graham (different characters, but still), and a new character is missing instead of one of ""The Wolfpack."" Everything else plays out nearly identically to the first film other than them checking the roof first; searching all over the city, outrageous antics, Stu's realization that the person they were looking for was right under their nose the entire time, Mike Tyson having a small cameo, right down to the ending leading to pictures in the credits. It's difficult to consider these spoilers when this is technically a film you've already seen. There are a few surprises in there, but not enough to make this sequel feel worthwhile.Ken Jeong's Mr. Chow gets a bigger role this time around and he's just as much a blessing as he is poison to the sequel. He has a few pretty classic one-liners, but is really annoying overall. So right after he mutters something amusing, he usually ruins it immediately afterward by either taking the joke too far or just saying something lame. He's a perfect example of too much of a good thing.Part of me wishes that The Hangover Part II would've combined The Human Centipede just to see something different. Phil, Alan, and Stu waking up as part of The Human Centipede without any recollection of how they got there sounds way more interesting than what we received. At least it'd be something different and not a complete rehash.The Hangover Part II does offer a handful of laughs, but suffers because it's the illegitimate twin brother of the original film. Its redundancy renders it an unnecessary experience even for the most die-hard Hangover fan. You'd probably be better off just watching the first one at home again and saving yourself $10. Part II may also set the record for most male genitalia shown in a wide released R-rated film or at least gives the record a run for its money. Men's junk and its overuse was all that was being discussed as people exited the theater.At the end of the day, The Hangover Part II is a mostly pointless sequel that's excessive, repetitive, and manages to tarnish what good it had going for it the first time around. If the small references to the first film weren't in there, it could probably pass as a remake. While it does offer some laughs and is bound to kill at the box office, it doesn't seem worth the trouble since it's basically the same journey with the addition of a bucket load of shafts and testicles and a cigarette smoking monkey.",2,A repetitious rehash of the original film,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,3777,"['Most', 'people', 'seem', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Hangover', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'highest', 'grossing', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'right', 'movie', 'also', 'fairly', 'solid', 'reputation', 'well', 'certified', 'fresh', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'above', 'average', 'scores', 'just', 'everywhere', 'else', 'look', 'said', 'better', 'standalone', 'film', 'Pushing', 'Hangover', 'film', 'masses', 'would', 'water', 'down', 'lessen', 'impact', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'entertaining', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'just', 'what', 'film', 'made', 'solely', 'money', 'nothing', 'more', 'really', 'is.I', 'felt', 'missed', 'out', 'not', 'seeing', 'original', 'film', 'theaters', 'Due', 'how', 'often', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'duration', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'warrant', 'theatrical', 'viewing', 'sequel', 'release', 'seemed', 'easy', 'solution', 'promotion', 'sequel', 'made', 'feel', 'weary', 'Trailers', 'pretty', 'much', 'let', 'everybody', 'know', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'sitting', 'exact', 'same', 'film', 'again', 'out', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'probably', 'about', '90', '%', 'same', 'film', 'Hangover.A', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'changed', 'comparison', 'first', 'film', 'drug', 'dealing', 'monkey', 'instead', 'tiger', 'Stu', 'tattoo', 'instead', 'losing', 'tooth', 'Alan', 'hair', 'instead', 'pants', ""'re"", 'Thailand', 'instead', 'Vegas', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'different', 'characters', 'still', 'new', 'character', 'missing', 'instead', 'one', 'Wolfpack', 'Everything', 'else', 'out', 'nearly', 'identically', 'first', 'film', 'other', 'checking', 'roof', 'first', 'searching', 'city', 'outrageous', 'antics', 'Stu', 'realization', 'person', 'were', 'looking', 'was', 'right', 'nose', 'entire', 'time', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'having', 'small', 'cameo', 'right', 'down', 'ending', 'leading', 'pictures', 'credits', 'difficult', 'consider', 'spoilers', 'when', 'technically', 'film', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'there', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'sequel', 'feel', 'Jeong', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'bigger', 'role', 'time', 'around', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'blessing', 'poison', 'sequel', 'few', 'pretty', 'classic', 'one-liners', 'really', 'annoying', 'overall', 'So', 'right', 'something', 'amusing', 'usually', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'taking', 'joke', 'too', 'far', 'just', 'saying', 'something', 'lame', 'perfect', 'example', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing.Part', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'would', ""'ve"", 'combined', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'just', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'Phil', 'Alan', 'Stu', 'waking', 'up', 'part', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'recollection', 'how', 'got', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'what', 'received', 'least', ""'d"", 'be', 'something', 'different', 'not', 'complete', 'rehash.The', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'offer', 'handful', 'laughs', 'suffers', 'illegitimate', 'twin', 'brother', 'original', 'film', 'redundancy', 'renders', 'unnecessary', 'experience', 'even', 'most', 'die-hard', 'Hangover', 'fan', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'watching', 'first', 'one', 'home', 'again', 'saving', '10', 'Part', 'II', 'may', 'also', 'set', 'record', 'most', 'male', 'genitalia', 'shown', 'wide', 'released', 'R-rated', 'film', 'least', 'record', 'run', 'money', 'Men', 'junk', 'overuse', 'was', 'was', 'being', 'discussed', 'people', 'exited', 'theater.At', 'end', 'day', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'mostly', 'pointless', 'sequel', 'excessive', 'repetitive', 'tarnish', 'what', 'good', 'had', 'going', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'small', 'references', 'first', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'could', 'probably', 'pass', 'remake', 'offer', 'laughs', 'bound', 'kill', 'box', 'office', ""n't"", 'seem', 'trouble', 'basically', 'same', 'journey', 'addition', 'bucket', 'load', 'shafts', 'testicles', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'monkey']",N/A

Yet it was a hit, because it had a quality that so many comedies today lack: it was funny.  Director Todd Phillips and company were unafraid to ""go there,"" to push buttons and risk offending people, all in the name of comedy.HANGOVER PART II is pretty much the same, except this time the guys are in Bangkok, and there's a drug-dealing monkey.  Even Mr. Chow is back, although his character really isn't important (Ken Jeong provides quite a bit of humor, but we're always painfully aware he was brought back to satisfy fans).  Paul Giamatti has a nice bit, as does Nick Cassavetes (in a role originally intended for Mel Gibson, then Liam Neeson; it would have been nice to see either actor in the roll, but Cassavetes is good).  The leads are as solid as they were in the first film; their elevated star status hasn't diminished their ability to deliver quality performances.It seems like I'm harping on the film; and in many ways, this harping is justified. HANGOVER broke new comedic ground; it wasn't revolutionary, but it was unique among modern comedy films.  HANGOVER PART II doesn't do this; it is a retreading of the first film, from the basic plot point (to be expected) to some of the more minor details (which makes things much too predictable in spots).  There are some memorable bits (a stripper surprise, which pushes the envelope, and Giamatti's ever-reliable presence), but ultimately HANGOVER PART II melds with the first film, becoming the weaker second act.

You can download a physical copy of movies on to your iOS device and it will playback without an Internet connection, but my beef with WB, the owners of Flixster BTW (surprise surprise) is that the copy has such a low bit rate that it makes it pretty much unwatchable except on an iPhone.  Now I am not saying that the usual digital copies were spectacular, but at least they were DVD quality.  The iTunes copies usually supplied are on average 1.5 to 2gb files. But the UV copies they give to playback on an iOS device clock in at a pathetic sub 500mb in size.  Some people rip thier own copy (nothing I would do) wink wink.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","I readily admit I was curious to watch this sequel of the hilariously successful original; I wanted to see if the filmmakers could come up with some original material to make the guys' second black out believable.  Alas, THE HANGOVER PART II is a retread--and often a tired retread--only here the raunch is vigorously ratcheted up.  From missing digits to drug overdose to transgendered shenanigans to Mike Tyson tweaking supreme annoyance with ease, this sequel definitely bends the envelope, and does have some laugh-out-loud moments, but if you've seen (and enjoyed) the original offering you can rest assured there is really no new ground covered in the sequel.The original foursome (Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis) return as Phil, Doug, Stu, and Alan; and this time Stu is wedding an Asian/American girl (Jamie Chung) in her native Thailand.  Stu wants no part of a bachelor party, yet upon arrival to the Orient he consents to the guys having one beer on the beach--and naturally the guys (sans Doug, who we discover leaves the get-together early and returns to the hotel, but adding Stu's future brother-in-law Teddy, played by Mason Lee) wake up the next morning in a rundown hotel in Bangkok with no memory of the night before, and missing young Teddy.  Of course, this sequel wouldn't be complete without the antics of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), who once again makes his appearance in all his natural glory.  Thus the manhunt for Teddy commences, as Stu, Phil, and Alan slowly piece together the events of a very busy evening, augmented by a faux ransom fronted by an undercover cop (Paul Giamatti), and, as before, just as the wedding appears doomed Stu solves the mystery, Teddy is found, there's a mad scramble to get back in time for the wedding, with (another)dramatic entrance.  And as if this sequel hasn't borrowed from its predecessor enough, Stu once again gets to ping another person, only this time it's his future father-in-law (Nirut Sirichanya).  Again, there are very funny moments to THE HANGOVER PART II, and all the antics are delivered as vigorously as before, but a retread is a retread is a retread.

I loved it so much and thought it was so outstanding that I went back three other times. When it was available on DVD I was sure to purchase it.This movie is the sequel to The Hangover. It is about 4 friends who have what was supposed to be a small and quiet bachelor party which turns into a night to remember. The guys wake up the morning after and are completely oblivious to what happened the previous night. They begin to back track while trying to hide what's happened from the groom to be's fianc&eacute;e. They encounter many situations from angry monks to singing professional boxers.This film was so spectacular because each friend was easy to relate to in some way. Each of their personalities and curiosity made for an eventful film.The dialog of this film is very intriguing. In some scenes they say the most random things while using very intelligent vocabulary and it somehow works together making the viewers laugh nonstop.Along with the hilarious dialog, there was never a dull moment. Something is always unexpectedly making you chuckle. There is always a situation needing to be solved.Although this was an excellent movie, it could have been better if the Main Character from the following movie, Doug, was involved more in the events.This movie was crude, rude, and just fantastic is so many ways.

I am familiar with the general principle that sequels are rarely as good as the original film, but this...this...this movie is unbelievably abysmal. About an hour into it, my wife asked me ""Is this supposed to be funny?"" The story is horrible, the acting is phoned in, and the ""plot"" is banal. Where the first movie had so many laugh out loud moments, Part II just limped along like a dog that had been run over by a car but survived. I cannot fathom the thought process of the executives who signed off on this, or the test audiences who found it anything less than painful to watch.I can honestly tell you I did not laugh once. Where the original was humorous, this sequel is just plain painful. The plot consists of Stu's impending nuptials in Thailand, a night that none of the friends can remember, a missing teenage boy, and one or two subplots that don't really ever come to fruition.

1402909,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B004EPZ06G,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[2, 7]","A good sequel better than the first. The first movie while funny seemed to stop short of pushing the envelope of what could be shown on the screen.  There are no such problems with the sequel.Todd Phillips reuses the same recipe of hi-jinks and hilarity but pushes it to the next level in The Hangover Part II. This time the laughs and scenarios are a lot more raunchier and bizarre than the first movie.It's true that setup and certain parts are copied of the original, but to call this a carbon copy of the first would be a misstatement.The location is different, newer characters are introduced, the characters seem more in tune with themselves than the first movie when they were going through the motions of what was going on. Here they don't seem as shocked by the circumstances surrounding their wild night of debauchery (for example Alan's bald head doesn't seem to phase him, Phil chucking at Stu's Mike Tyson tattoo, and Mr. Chow's sudden friendship with the Wolfpac namely Alan). If anything there seems to be a certain admiring among the guys over what they have done (except for Stu).They did try to provide a bit more of a back story as well. In the first movie, Stu was a miserable wreck with his relationship, gets married in Vegas (though he has on recollection of what happened) and eventually separates from that girl as well. Here they tried to introduce Stu as happier man when he's about to get married to his Asian bride despite the fact that her father disapproves of their whole union.The interactions even with some of the objects and animals for example carry in a bit more time and usage. Like the Tiger in the first movie was merely just there as a small side note to the Wolfpac's inebriated rampage over Vegas. In this sequel, the hilarious drug dealing monkey in Bangkok serves a bit more purpose and actually practically steals the movie during a couple of over the top scenes.Regardless then of whether of you dispute if this is more or the same, the end point of this discussion should be whether this is a great comedy or not. The simple answer to that is DUH yes!!!!!It has all the elements of a good comedy, it's a good buddy movie, and it never manages to be boring.

It's Stu's turn to get married (Didn't he marry a hooker in the original film?) Jamie Chung plays his lovely Thai-American bride Lauren. Her parents are planning a beautiful wedding in Thailand. Stu invites his best buddies Phil and Doug to join him but this time the bachelor party will be dinner at IHOP. No more shenanigans for Stu. He has a conservative future father-in-law to impress. After what happened in Las Vegas, Alan is out of the picture until Stu is convinced to invite him along. Is Thailand ready for this gang?Alan promises to behave but an impromptu bonfire party for the guys at the beach goes wrong--very wrong. The guys are joined by Lauren's teeange brother teddy. Of course, the next thing we know, Stu, Phi and Alan wake up in a strange Bangkok hotel with no idea of what happened. They've lost Teddy but gained a monkey and somehow the mysterious Mr. Chow is with them. There is one more item of note in the room but I won't spoil the surprise.The humor quickly turns dark and even more raunchy and vulgar as the guys try to figure out what happened last night and desperately try to find Teddy who may be ""lost to Bangkok"" which must mean he'll never be seen again. The guys's fill in bits and pieces of their lost memories and end up with a Buddhist monk, a facial tattoo, a destroyed bar...should I go on?I felt bad for Thailand that such a silly movie was filmed in their lovely country. Although the wedding is taking place at a beautiful seaside area, the guys end up in a seedy and ugly part of Bangkok. I found several things distasteful about this film. The monkey is shown smoking and ""works"" for criminals. The item found in the hotel room that I have not mentioned specifically is such a major issue and it is taken lightly. It's bad news for that item to be there. Stu has unprotected sex with a Thai prostitute and there is no mention of consequences except that he ""cheated"" on his future wife and obviously has a thing for prostitutes. Be prepared for an extra surprise in that part of the story.Ken Jeong returns as Mr. Chow, a rather embarrassing character and a not very politically correct protrayal of an Asian character. Chow is something out of a bad comic book. Just looking and listening to him makes you want to cringe. Bradley Cooper is back as the pretty boy of the group. Justin Bartha has a smaller roll in this film as Doug.HANGOVER II could have made better use of the beautiful Thai scenery. The raunch could have been toned down. Alan is so much trouble yet he gets to come along and chaos ensures.

The characters are all back in Part II, but they should of gone elsewhere for a better movie script.

He kept being a total pain in the you know where, the way he kept staring at people, & the way he treated Teddy in the film, was ridiculous. How can this actor, play a moronic character that is so mean, rude, & just plain stupid? Onto the movie itself. It lost all of the first one's funny bone, 10-15 mins into it. I wanted to press the stop button on my Blu-Ray Remote, after the scene where Alan throws the neck comforter, or whatever it was, away at the Airport. The scene when they go to the Thailand Strip Bar, was disgusting. The whole film, had humour in it, that was never really funny.

How do you top The Hangover, you do it by setting it in a more interesting location. Thailand is just that and to anyone who has never traveled there, you should at least once in your life. Part II showcases the country beautifully, from the many islands to Bangkok, one of the great cities of the world.

(whose ""equipment"" we have the displeasure of actually seeing) We find out in graphic detail that while the thankfully unseen act itself involved a ""happy ending"" for both participants, as it turns out, Helms' character, a heterosexual, was on the receiving end of this act, if you know what I mean. There is no humor in this revelation whatsoever but Helms' character sings about the event later on in the movie as though it were something he thought to be amusing enough to actually joke around about.

1402944,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004EPZ06G,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 4]","When The Hangover was released in 2009 and became a box-office sensation and a cultural phenomenon, it also made a sequel an inevitability. When official word came that one had been greenlit, I, like many others, wondered how it could be made without repeating the same formula. Without that formula, it's not really a sequel so much as a new film with the same characters. Apparently, director Todd Phillips had the same thought and returns with what, at face value, looks like the laziest sequel in years. Following the exact same template as the first, The Hangover Part II is less of a sequel and more of a remake. Change the location from Vegas to Thailand, switch Doug out for Stu's brother-in-law, change the jokes, and you're left with a sequel that essentially follows it's predecessor note-for-note. After all, Hollywood is notorious for putting no effort into a sequel when it has a built-in audience and is a sure-fire hit. I admit that I had reservations going in, but as I settled in to watch the film I found that what I mistook for laziness was actually logic; ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Whether you find this logical or not, this was Todd Phillips' logic while making this film and, defying all logic, it actually works.The film reunites Doug (Justin Bartha), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Stu (Ed Helms) as they prepare to travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding to fiancee Lauren (Jamie Chung). Due to what happened in Vegas, they all agree to not invite Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and only change their minds out of guilt when he discovers their plan. Once in Thailand, the four decide to have a small bonfire by the beach along with Lauren's 16-year-old brother Teddy (Mason Lee). Phil, Stu, and Alan awake the next morning in a Bangkok hotel room and find themselves in a remarkably familiar situation. This time, however, Doug is safe (having left the bonfire early) and it is Teddy who is missing.If you've seen the first film, you can fill in the rest from here. Every plot point is basically the same, just tweaked ever-so-slightly. Remember baby Carlos and the tiger from the first film? Well now there's a monkey and a Buddhist monk. The main cast is all here, but there's plenty of familiar faces too, with Ken Jeong and Jeffrey Tambor reprising their roles as Mr. Chow and Sid Garner, respectively. Even Bryan Callen who played Eddie (the owner of the wedding chapel) appears, albeit in a different role. New faces include Paul Giamatti and Nick Cassavetes (who replaced Liam Neeson, after the actor was unable to re-shoot his cameo).Making a sequel to The Hangover could not have been an easy task. Not only was it a box office hit, but many of the film's jokes and bits of dialogue have become a part of the cultural vernacular. With a movie that has become so ingrained into moviegoer's collective consciousness, how can a sequel expect to achieve the same effect? Rather than trying to force this sequel into the same realm, Phillips and his cast rely on one of the most important factors of the original's success: the chemistry between the three principal actors. Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis slip back into their roles effortlessly and manage to capture the magic that made the last film such a joy to watch. Although the three have vastly different comedic styles, they somehow blend together and bounce off of each other perfectly. Sure the element of surprise is missing and the sequel is a little darker in tone, but all the essential ingredients are here, along with the added bonus of the beautiful scenery of Thailand (admittedly juxtaposed with some of the grittier areas of Bangkok).The humor of both films is raunchy and irreverent, built on stupid rather than sophisticated humor. Even so, there is intelligence behind the irreverence which makes these films appeal to such a wide audience. However, Part II does seem more crude and much raunchier than it's predecessor with many jokes and shots pertaining to male anatomy. There is nothing here that is likely to offend fans of the original, although Phillips seems to be testing the limits of the MPAA's 'R' rating. The bottom-line is that the main cast retains their chemistry together and the new players, particularly Giamatti, are funny enough to keep the film from being bogged down and becoming a pointless retread of earlier material. The film does take some cheap jabs at Asian stereotypes, but this is unlikely to offend the intended audience as Asian stereotypes are hardly a new thing for this series (Mr. Chow was, after all, in the first film).Critics have come down hard on the film, but, as of this writing, audiences seem satisfied (the film currently holds a 7.2 on IMDB). It's easy to see why critics have shown dismay for it, but none of them seem convinced that it's a bad film, simply one they were already subjected to a couple years ago. This movie is critic-proof; it's not for film critics and film scholars, but for people who enjoyed the first movie. Is The Hangover Part II better than it's predecessor? Probably not, as this one lacks the fresh, new, and surprising quality of the first. There was a certain spark that the filmmakers could not hope to replicate due to the familiarity of the first movie. With that in mind, I can't imagine you not liking this film if you enjoyed the original, as they are two parts of the same entity; the jokes are different, but everything else is the same. I saw the film in a theatre with roughly 30 people who reacted with the same riotous laughter that I heard people react to the first film with. I don't know how Todd Phillips successfully made an effective, funny movie by remaking his own work...But he did. While it's unlikely to achieve the iconic status of it's predecessor, The Hangover Part II is a worthy companion piece to a comedy that many people already consider a classic.GRADE: B",4,"Todd Phillips says ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

For whatever reason (better wine?) I actually enjoyed this one a little more, I think because of the Thailand setting. Personally I could use a little more Bradley Cooper and less Zach Galifianakis, but that may just be me:-) In this one, Ed Helms is getting married in Thailand - his wife's family is from there - at a lovely beachside resort. Although not planning to party, through a mysterious set of circumstances (which we later learn of) a beachside beer turns into a complete blackout night, with Helms/Cooper/Galifiankis's characters waking up in Bangkok in a dreadful state, and missing the bride's 15-year old brother (whose finger appears to be in an ice bucket next to him.) So sets the stage for the movie. They set out to find him, and get back to the resort in time for the wedding, and in the process start to remember and retrace the events of the night before.Plenty of funny moments ensue - dark humor of course.

The laughs were gut busters, but the lulls in between were interminable and often horrifyingly dull - like the first twenty minutes of the film. How can you spend wholly 1/5th of your movie in the set-up? That was the first sign that this wasn't going to be a repeat performance of their amazing first effort.Although the formula was the same, there's a dank undercurrent, a pitifulness that's built up as we watch these muckers go about one twisted situation after another.The script replaced hilarity with shock, humor with the bizarre. Lost from the first film was the genuine sense of discovery. Also lost - a great deal of emotional sincerity - as we no longer feel like one of the gang and more like detached observers to their antics.The hysterical comic lunacy of the first film is replaced by plain lunacy with comical asides. This gives ""II"" a grungy edge and less a comedic one. Certainly not a formula for repeat success.Again, the one element that had me scratching my head was the overall atmosphere of the film; many of the scenes seem gritty and unpolished. Not sure what Director Todd Phillips was attempting? I honestly expected a half-naked Martin Sheen to walk out of the hotel getting ready to face Colonel Kurtz in the jungle. And maybe that wouldn't have been such a bad idea, because the Mike Tyson cameo really lacked oomph this time around.And speaking of cameos and a Sheen - how did they miss getting Charlie to appear? C'mon! That should have been a gimme; a massive lost opportunity for this production, which needed every trick in the book to work. You can't tell me a free trip and fully funded Yum-Yum City excursion wouldn't have interested his Warlockness.Honestly? I get the sense this was an extended party for the production crew, staff and actors - and they just happened to do a movie on the side.Definitely suffers from the sophomore jinx.

1402970,AE9IH4LOALC7M,B004EPZ06G,Matthew Allard,"[9, 14]","""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". That seems to have been the mentality of director Todd Phillips on set. The sequel for the surprise 2009 smash hit ""The Hangover"" was inevitable. How Phillips would tackle such a sequel, wasn't quite as clear. ""The Hangover Part II"" uses the same formula that brought the first film such success. The EXACT same formula. Here's the opening: It's wedding day, the bride is anxious, and an exasperated, beleaguered Bradley Cooper sputters from his cell phone: ""We did it again"". OOPS! This movie suffers from the ""Sex and the City 2"" conundrum, in which the screenwriters basically say, ""Let's make the same exact movie.... somewhere else"".Part II takes place in Bangkok, as opposed to Las Vegas. Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married there, and he wants no issues, nothing that could even possibly recreate the horrifying events from the first ""Hangover"". All he wants is a ""bachelor brunch"" at ihop, but is eventually coerced into having just one beer down at the beach with the guys. Cue the timelapse, cut to the morning after, then to the emptying of the pockets, then to the ensuing hijinks. The biggest problem with ""The Hangover Part II"" is its inherent predictability. By following the same cookie-cutter formula, we as the audience aren't shocked by anything, no matter how much they try to raise the stakes (and they try constantly).Everything is bigger, if not necessarily better, in ""The Hangover Part II"". Someone gets shot at one point, kidnappings and gun shootings are commonplace, drug deals, monkeys, transvestites, riots in the streets. They even have Stu strumming a guitar, singing a song about their absurd misfortunes, much like in the first Hangover! The first Hangover's charm was the insane but legitimate spontaneity of it all. We genuinely cared about what happened, how it happened, and where their friend Doug was. In this one, it's just distracting, and frankly embarrassing watching them go through the motions of the first film in a new city, as Ed Helms tries to contort his facial reactions in new, unique ways.It probably sounds like I hate this movie, but that's not the case. I found myself laughing throughout, so it's definitely an effective film; the guy next to me certainly thought it was ""way better"" than the first one. ""The Hangover Part II"" will probably be very successful in the box office, but it will have no lasting imprint like the first one. Unfortunately, the project was doomed from the start; by following the same formula, they were setting themselves up for failure. I know I keep harping on the same point, but it's one that defines the whole movie. I truly would have liked to have seen these characters in a different scenario, but not the same scenario somewhere else! That's just absurd!

Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[0, 0]","This review may include some spoilers....Maybe I just needed a good laugh, or maybe I just accepted Hangover II for what it was... entertainment. I wasn't expecting any Oscar performances; I simply wanted mindless, stomach splitting humor which is what I got. The Hangover II proved for several hours of good fun. I personally thought this one was just as funny as the first. I mean what could be more hilarious as Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Mike Tyson singing. Anyway, Stu is planning on marrying Lauren (the love of his life). Initially he invites all of his friends, with the exception of Alan, to come join him in Thailand for the upcoming nuptials. But succumbing to pressure from Phil and Doug, Stu finally invites Alan to join them, which would prove to be the first in a series of steps that lead to quite the adventure.Once they arrive in Thailand, Stu has to deal with Lauren's father (who hates him and takes every opportunity to demean his future son-in-law); Alan's jealousy of Lauren's kid brother Teddy (a genius and Stanford Med Student); and Phil's attempts to plan a bachelor party. After all he remembers Las Vegas and doesn't want anything like that to happen again. As luck would have it, Phil, Stu and Alan wake up in Bangkok with (again) no memory of the events from the night before. The only things they know for sure is that (1) Stu now has a large tattoo on his face (that strongly resembles the one Mike Tyson sports); (2) they now are responsible for a monkey (who smokes and does other hilarious things); (3) Teddy, Lauren's little brother is now missing and all they have left of him is a finger with his class ring; (4) they are a long way from where they should be and must get Stu and Teddy back in time for the wedding; (5) Alan is bald; (6) Mr. Chow is still involved in some questionable things; (6) there is a monk, who has taken a vow of silence who witnessed the events from the previous night; and (7) they are in a great deal of trouble. It would seem that the Las Vegas events are tame compared to what they are don't remember experiencing in Bangok.I honestly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to those looking for some mindless humor.",4,"I think I would quit drinking, or at least I would stop hanging out with the same guys who keep getting me in trouble!",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,2186,"['review', 'may', 'include', 'spoilers', '.Maybe', 'just', 'needed', 'good', 'laugh', 'maybe', 'just', 'accepted', 'Hangover', 'II', 'what', 'was', 'entertainment', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Oscar', 'performances', 'simply', 'wanted', 'mindless', 'stomach', 'splitting', 'humor', 'what', 'got', 'Hangover', 'II', 'proved', 'several', 'hours', 'good', 'fun', 'personally', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'mean', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'hilarious', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'singing', 'Anyway', 'Stu', 'planning', 'marrying', 'Lauren', 'love', 'life', 'Initially', 'friends', 'exception', 'Alan', 'come', 'join', 'Thailand', 'upcoming', 'nuptials', 'succumbing', 'pressure', 'Phil', 'Doug', 'Stu', 'finally', 'Alan', 'join', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'first', 'series', 'steps', 'lead', 'quite', 'adventure.Once', 'arrive', 'Thailand', 'Stu', 'deal', 'Lauren', 'father', 'who', 'opportunity', 'demean', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'Alan', 'jealousy', 'Lauren', 'kid', 'brother', 'Teddy', 'genius', 'Stanford', 'Med', 'Student', 'Phil', 'attempts', 'plan', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Las', 'Vegas', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'happen', 'again', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Phil', 'Stu', 'Alan', 'wake', 'up', 'Bangkok', 'again', 'memory', 'events', 'night', 'only', 'things', 'know', 'sure', '1', 'Stu', 'now', 'large', 'tattoo', 'face', 'strongly', 'one', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'sports', '2', 'now', 'are', 'responsible', 'monkey', 'who', 'other', 'hilarious', 'things', '3', 'Teddy', 'Lauren', 'little', 'brother', 'now', 'missing', 'have', 'left', 'finger', 'class', 'ring', '4', 'are', 'long', 'way', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'get', 'Stu', 'Teddy', 'back', 'time', 'wedding', '5', 'Alan', 'bald', '6', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'still', 'involved', 'questionable', 'things', '6', 'monk', 'who', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'who', 'witnessed', 'events', 'previous', 'night', '7', 'are', 'great', 'deal', 'trouble', 'would', 'seem', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'events', 'are', 'tame', 'compared', 'what', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'experiencing', 'Bangok.I', 'honestly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'looking', 'mindless', 'humor']",N/A

Though he's hated by Lauren's father's (Nirut Sirijanya), Stu is adored by her brother Teddy (Mason Lee), so he includes him in their partying plans in Bangkok (much to Alan's chagrin.)  Well, once again the boys party to hard, and once again they lose another member of the party (though it's not Doug this time, as he spends most of the movie hanging out at the resort being the boring married guy.)  The difference is that Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) is now responsible for some of the trouble the boys are involved in and a chain-smoking monkey has engaged them on their travels.  The group goes through a bunch of ridiculous scenarios in an attempt to retrace their steps and to explain what occurred the night before and to find their missing comrade.  Will they get back to the wedding unscathed and intact?  Will Stu earn the respect of Lauren's father?  Will Alan ever grow up or will he always be a man-child?While the first Hangover was laugh-out-loud funny, this one wasn't nearly as humorous.  However, the action sequences were far more intense than what you saw in the first film, so if you were watching this as you were any type of action movie, then it could have been very enjoyable.  However, the ending of the film killed any redeeming factor that the movie leading up to it would have offered.  When Stu told off his previous fiancee, it was one of the moments where everyone in the theater stood up and cheered him on.  Now when he stands up to Lauren's father at the end, the nonsense that comes out of his mouth (and the father's subsequent reaction) is actually less believable than everything else that occurred leading up to it (and believe me, their misadventures in this film were certainly more ridiculous than the first film.)  Part of a movie is wanting to see it again, not to kill 90 minutes of buildup with a weak climax during the last 10 minutes of the film.  I think I read somewhere that Todd Richards is going to hold off on a Hangover 3 movie and frankly, that's probably a solid plan if they want to inject the franchise with some fresh ideas.If you were a massive fan of the first film, you can check this out for continuity purposes.

1403001,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B004EPZ06G,pastapadre,"[0, 0]","The idea of a sequel to the 2009 film The Hangover was a welcome one after having caught audiences off-guard with its hilarious situations in Las Vegas while raking in the cash to become the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all-time. The characters were likable on their own and had great chemistry together so the thought of following them further absolutely made sense.In the lead-up to The Hangover: Part II however there was concern regarding the appearance that the plot would be a carbon copy of the original. Unfortunately that was largely realized, and despite a number of big laughs the movie feels uninspired and all too familiar.The setting has changed to Thailand but the scenarios are largely the same. A bachelor party spins out of control and the guys wake up not remembering a thing about the night and realizing someone is missing. From there it is a race around the city as they try to put the pieces together. Substitute monkey for baby for easy reactionary laughs and so on.The majority of the developments parallel what took place in the first film to a frustrating degree. Being unable to overlook that it made each and every reveal feel forced. Surprises really didn't feel as though they were surprises and ultimately they all led to predictable conclusions. Even the new locale didn't really add much to the story but to provide the backdrop as they raced around without largely inhibiting their efforts.If just one unexpected thing took place it's that I came away having really enjoyed Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow despite not having cared for the character in the first movie. All the other actors were playing their roles identical to the first except for Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who was quite mean-spirited early on and that felt somewhat out of place and distracting.As much as its familiarity hampered its potential The Hangover II was still full of laughs and I can't overlook that entirely. The main problem is that these characters just can't shock me anymore regardless of what they get themselves into. In fact by the end I started to dread the prospect of them in a third film attempting to top the first two. The photos during the credits sequence though were genuinely funny yet again and almost made the whole thing worthwhile on their own. When the credit sequence is the highlight that isn't a sign of a good film however.You pretty much know what you're going to get with The Hangover II, an enjoyable but unoriginal follow-up, and for such a popular comedy that may be just enough to entice audiences and satisfy the masses who don't necessarily care for anything more.",2,Gets some laughs but too similar to the first,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,2610,"['idea', 'sequel', '2009', 'film', 'Hangover', 'was', 'welcome', 'one', 'having', 'caught', 'audiences', 'off-guard', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'raking', 'cash', 'become', 'highest', 'grossing', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'all-time', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'own', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'thought', 'following', 'further', 'absolutely', 'made', 'sense.In', 'lead-up', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'however', 'there', 'was', 'concern', 'regarding', 'appearance', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'carbon', 'copy', 'original', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'largely', 'realized', 'number', 'big', 'laughs', 'movie', 'feels', 'uninspired', 'too', 'familiar.The', 'setting', 'changed', 'Thailand', 'scenarios', 'are', 'largely', 'same', 'A', 'bachelor', 'party', 'control', 'guys', 'wake', 'up', 'not', 'remembering', 'thing', 'night', 'realizing', 'someone', 'missing', 'race', 'city', 'try', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'Substitute', 'monkey', 'baby', 'easy', 'reactionary', 'laughs', 'so', 'on.The', 'majority', 'developments', 'parallel', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'first', 'film', 'frustrating', 'degree', 'Being', 'unable', 'overlook', 'made', 'reveal', 'feel', 'forced', 'Surprises', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'surprises', 'ultimately', 'led', 'predictable', 'conclusions', 'Even', 'new', 'locale', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'story', 'provide', 'backdrop', 'raced', 'largely', 'inhibiting', 'efforts.If', 'just', 'one', 'unexpected', 'thing', 'took', 'place', 'came', 'away', 'having', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'not', 'having', 'cared', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'playing', 'roles', 'identical', 'first', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'mean-spirited', 'early', 'felt', 'place', 'distracting.As', 'much', 'familiarity', 'hampered', 'potential', 'Hangover', 'II', 'was', 'still', 'full', 'laughs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'entirely', 'main', 'problem', 'characters', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shock', 'anymore', 'regardless', 'what', 'get', 'fact', 'end', 'started', 'dread', 'prospect', 'third', 'film', 'attempting', 'top', 'first', 'two', 'photos', 'credits', 'sequence', 'were', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'yet', 'again', 'almost', 'made', 'whole', 'thing', 'worthwhile', 'own', 'When', 'credit', 'sequence', 'highlight', ""n't"", 'sign', 'good', 'film', 'however.You', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'Hangover', 'II', 'enjoyable', 'unoriginal', 'follow-up', 'such', 'popular', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'enough', 'entice', 'audiences', 'satisfy', 'masses', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'care', 'anything', 'more']",N/A

1403017,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004EPZ06G,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[6, 12]","This month, two hotly anticipated sequels were released- Pirates 4 and Hangover 2. For me, this should have been an awesome movie month. Well, OK, Bridesmaids and Thor were awesome movies- however the thing is, these aren't sequels, they're original concepts (OK, well not really original- I'm talking original as in ""The start of something"").OK, now Pirates wasn't a bad movie, it had its share of entertaining scenes, but felt undercooked for the most part, and sadly, Hangover 2 suffers from exactly the same problem... except Pirates 4 was unfortunately much better.Now, I LOVED The Hangover. I remeber when it came out back in 2009 and I loved it so much, I saw it twice. Every viewing was just as entertaining as the first. When I heard a Hangover 2 was being made, I was excited. I figured the first movie was good enough to have a solid sequel, and Todd Phillips knew what he was doing was good. So I patiently anticipated this movie, and when it got released, I was one of the first people in line.Unfortunately, this is no sequel. It is essentially a remake of the first movie. Why is that a problem? Because the first movie was way funnier.The plot is essentially exatly the same... except this time it's set in Thailand. This time, Stu is getting married to a beautiful Thai woman,and Allan is not invited- he has even been rendered Catatonic for that reason. Yet after a bit of convincing, Allan is suddenly invited along, and alredy having problems with the chosen best man- Teddy, Stu's wife-to-be's brother. After a rather disconcerting celebratory dinner at the resort, the gang, with teddy, go down to the resort's beach and have a few drinks... and then the first movie happens... again.I'm sure I don't need to tell you the rest, because I'm assuming you have seen the first movie already, and if you have, you've seen this movie too.The problem with Hangover 2 is that it's just plain not original AT ALL. While it did have a few belly laughs, in particular a scene involving Stu discovering he had sex with a transvestite stripper, they felt forced, and I had felt like I saw it already two years ago. Plenty of people I know, my girlfriend and manager at work included, asked ""Why didn't you like it? It's exactly the same as the first."" The latter sentence is exactly why I was disappointed- I felt that with this being a sequel, they could have introduced something new. Sadly this wasn't the case- everything came from the first movie, and by the end of the movie, I just wanted it to be over. Because I saw it two years ago already, but much funnier. In my opinion, only one movie got away with being a carbon copy of its predecessor- Escape from LA.That being said, maybe if you haven't seen the first movie, you will love this. But if you have, well, hoo boy, prepare yourself for a mega disappointment. They practically REMADE the first movie, all the way down to Stu singing a song about the crap they're in and then some. If you must see it, rent it on blu-ray- it is not worth the $15.75 UltraAVX price I paid to see it.OVERALL: 4/10PROS:-Some great laughs-The cast is great-They did the ""Photo during the end credits"" thing againCONS:-A remake, not a sequel-Way too familiar-Familiarity even drives the film to the maddening point of predictability-None of the jokes seem natural at all- forced at best, really.",2,Hungover from the Hangover,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,3345,"['month', 'two', 'hotly', 'anticipated', 'sequels', 'were', 'released-', 'Pirates', '4', 'Hangover', '2', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'movie', 'month', 'Well', 'OK', 'Bridesmaids', 'Thor', 'were', 'awesome', 'movies-', 'however', 'thing', 'are', ""n't"", 'sequels', ""'re"", 'original', 'concepts', 'OK', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'original-', ""'m"", 'talking', 'original', 'start', 'something', '.OK', 'now', 'Pirates', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'share', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'felt', 'undercooked', 'most', 'part', 'sadly', 'Hangover', '2', 'suffers', 'exactly', 'same', 'problem', 'Pirates', '4', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'much', 'better.Now', 'LOVED', 'Hangover', 'remeber', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'back', '2009', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'saw', 'twice', 'Every', 'viewing', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'first', 'When', 'heard', 'Hangover', '2', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'was', 'excited', 'figured', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'have', 'solid', 'sequel', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'good', 'patiently', 'anticipated', 'movie', 'when', 'got', 'released', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'people', 'line.Unfortunately', 'sequel', 'essentially', 'remake', 'first', 'movie', 'Why', 'problem', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'funnier.The', 'plot', 'essentially', 'exatly', 'same', 'time', 'set', 'Thailand', 'time', 'Stu', 'getting', 'married', 'beautiful', 'Thai', 'woman', 'Allan', 'not', 'invited-', 'even', 'been', 'rendered', 'Catatonic', 'reason', 'bit', 'convincing', 'Allan', 'suddenly', 'invited', 'alredy', 'having', 'problems', 'chosen', 'best', 'man-', 'Teddy', 'Stu', 'wife-to-be', 'brother', 'rather', 'disconcerting', 'celebratory', 'dinner', 'resort', 'gang', 'teddy', 'go', 'down', 'resort', 'beach', 'have', 'few', 'drinks', 'then', 'first', 'movie', 'happens', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'rest', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'already', 'have', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'too.The', 'problem', 'Hangover', '2', 'just', 'plain', 'not', 'original', 'AT', 'ALL', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'belly', 'particular', 'scene', 'involving', 'Stu', 'discovering', 'had', 'sex', 'transvestite', 'stripper', 'felt', 'forced', 'had', 'felt', 'saw', 'already', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Plenty', 'people', 'know', 'girlfriend', 'manager', 'work', 'included', 'asked', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'same', 'first', 'latter', 'sentence', 'exactly', 'why', 'was', 'disappointed-', 'felt', 'being', 'sequel', 'could', 'have', 'introduced', 'something', 'new', 'Sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'case-', 'everything', 'came', 'first', 'movie', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'over', 'saw', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'already', 'much', 'funnier', 'opinion', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'got', 'away', 'being', 'carbon', 'copy', 'predecessor-', 'Escape', 'LA.That', 'being', 'said', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'have', 'well', 'hoo', 'boy', 'prepare', 'mega', 'disappointment', 'practically', 'REMADE', 'first', 'movie', 'way', 'Stu', 'singing', 'song', 'crap', ""'re"", 'then', 'must', 'see', 'rent', 'blu-ray-', 'not', 'worth', '15.75', 'UltraAVX', 'price', 'paid', 'see', 'it.OVERALL', '4/10PROS', '-Some', 'great', 'laughs-The', 'cast', 'great-They', 'did', 'Photo', 'end', 'credits', 'thing', 'againCONS', '-A', 'remake', 'not', 'sequel-Way', 'too', 'familiar-Familiarity', 'even', 'film', 'maddening', 'point', 'predictability-None', 'jokes', 'seem', 'natural', 'all-', 'forced', 'best', 'really']",N/A

The second installment of the Hangover, is so bad it can't even be classified as a comedy, and I mean that sincerely.  This movie could be a second rate action movie, but to classify it as a comedy is false advertising.The boys are back, Bradley Cooper(Phil), Ed Helms(Stu), Doug(Justin Bartha) and last, and with the worse acting gig in the history of acting, Alan(Zach Galifianakis), but the all the good scriptwriters seem to have taken a vacation.I found Alan to be so repulsive as to be unbelievable, and the fact that Phil, Stu trust him again, is beyond the pale.  Of course they get in trouble again by way of Alan, or there wouldn't be a movie, but maybe that's the point, there shouldn't have been another movie, or maybe it should have been from the ladies point of view this time, anything other than what happened in this movie.In the first movie, Alan's pranks were charming, in this second movie, he is so out there, that all I could think is that he should be put in a mental institution for the criminally insane.  Zach's character is so toxic, that it was all I could do to watch him on the screen.  Didn't he read the script?  Isn't part of being talented, being able to imagine how your character will turn out?

What????Then there's the ending, Stu's finance's father hates him, as well the man should.  Stu is the coward he's accused of being, and when he finally stands up to his future father-in-law, the man accepts him, as if being and a** makes a person more noble.  Why Stu's fiance even considered dating him in the first place, is unbelievable to the extreme.Save your money, and the valuable time you'll never get back by watching something other than this 'made-for-money' sequel of a truly funny movie.I wish I would have downloaded a photo of Bradley Cooper and just stared at it for 2 hours instead . . .",2,what happened????,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,2318,"[""'m"", 'assuming', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Hangover', 'II', 'watched', 'first', 'Hangover', 'movie', 'found', 'hilarious', 'second', 'installment', 'Hangover', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'classified', 'comedy', 'mean', 'sincerely', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'second', 'rate', 'action', 'movie', 'classify', 'comedy', 'false', 'advertising.The', 'boys', 'are', 'back', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Phil', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Stu', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'last', 'worse', 'acting', 'gig', 'history', 'acting', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'good', 'scriptwriters', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'vacation.I', 'found', 'Alan', 'be', 'so', 'repulsive', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'fact', 'Phil', 'Stu', 'trust', 'again', 'pale', 'course', 'get', 'trouble', 'again', 'way', 'Alan', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'maybe', 'point', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ladies', 'point', 'view', 'time', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'happened', 'movie.In', 'first', 'movie', 'Alan', 'pranks', 'were', 'charming', 'second', 'movie', 'so', 'out', 'there', 'could', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'mental', 'institution', 'criminally', 'insane', 'Zach', 'character', 'so', 'toxic', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'watch', 'screen', 'Did', ""n't"", 'read', 'script', ""n't"", 'part', 'being', 'talented', 'being', 'able', 'imagine', 'how', 'character', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'man', 'movie', 'again.', '-spoiler', 'alert', '-The', 'addition', 'Stu', 'finance', 'brilliant', 'little', 'brother', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'touch', 'had', 'lose', 'finger', 'allowed', 'brilliant', 'musician', 'aspiring', 'surgeon', 'bond', ""'wolf"", 'pack', 'idiots', 'allowing', 'smile', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'What', 'Then', 'ending', 'Stu', 'finance', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'should', 'Stu', 'coward', 'accused', 'being', 'when', 'finally', 'up', 'future', 'father-in-law', 'man', 'being', 'a**', 'person', 'more', 'noble', 'Why', 'Stu', 'fiance', 'even', 'considered', 'dating', 'first', 'place', 'unbelievable', 'extreme.Save', 'money', 'valuable', 'time', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'back', 'watching', 'something', 'other', ""'made-for-money"", 'sequel', 'truly', 'funny', 'movie.I', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'downloaded', 'photo', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'just', 'stared', '2', 'hours', 'instead']",N/A

But I would be lying.

To that end, the  screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin and director Todd Phillips is filled with wheezy plot mechanics, overwrought action sequences, mind-numbing slapstick, and jokes that fall consistently flat.The buddies are once again played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis and a much under-used Justin Bartha (who may have been the only one career-conscious and savvy enough to ask to be left out of most of the proceedings), while Paul Giamatti and Ken Jeong - who is much funnier on TV's ""Community"" - have been added to the cast.By any standard but the most crassly commercial - the movie garnered an impressive quarter of a billion dollars in domestic box office receipts - ""The Hangover - Part2"" is a colossal bomb.",1,dreadful rehash of the original,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1494,"['barely', 'laugh', 'be', 'had', 'Hangover', 'Part', '2', 'dreadful', 'sequel', 'original', 'box', 'office', 'smash', '2009.This', 'time', 'boys', 'do', 'mean', 'boys', 'are', 'trapped', 'Thailand', 'where', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'celebrate', 'Stu', 'nuptials', 'where', 'immediately', 'fall', 'series', 'misadventures', 'riotous', 'night', 'bachelor', 'party', 'celebration', 'Bangkok', 'been', 'mysteriously', 'erased', 'collective', 'memory.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'most', 'big-budget', 'studio', 'comedies', 'days', 'tone', 'performances', 'are', 'pitched', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'audience', 'up', 'feeling', 'rather', 'entertained', 'long', 'closing', 'come', 'rolling', 'end', 'screenplay', 'Scot', 'Armstrong', 'Craig', 'Mazin', 'director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'filled', 'wheezy', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'overwrought', 'action', 'sequences', 'mind-numbing', 'slapstick', 'jokes', 'fall', 'consistently', 'flat.The', 'buddies', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'played', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Zack', 'Galifianakis', 'much', 'under-used', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'one', 'career-conscious', 'savvy', 'enough', 'ask', 'be', 'left', 'most', 'proceedings', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'who', 'much', 'funnier', 'TV', 'Community', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'cast.By', 'standard', 'most', 'crassly', 'commercial', 'movie', 'garnered', 'impressive', 'quarter', 'billion', 'dollars', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'Hangover', 'Part2', 'colossal', 'bomb']",N/A

Despite the top-notch work of the ensemble cast, Zach Galifianakis stole the show more completely than any actor since we walked away from ""High Fidelity"" raving about Jack Black.Even before the release of ""The Hangover,"" which made a bazillion dollars at the box office, a sequel was in the works. The great news is that almost the entire gang is back from Vegas and now heads to Bangkok in the sequel, ""The Hangover Part II."" Doug (Justin Bartha) is comfortably married and Stu (Ed Helms) is taking the plunge with Lauren (Jamie Chung), whose family still lives in Thailand. Stu wants nothing more than a quiet wedding, and he wisely spends his bachelor party at brunch. Unfortunately, Stu brings Alan (Galifianakis) along for the wedding, against his better instincts. With Alan in tow, one should expect accidental mayhem to follow, and it does.In spades.Once again the boys find themselves awakening with blinding hangovers, blank memories, and a missing friend. Once again, they spend the movie resurrecting what went on the night before, and each discovered secret is more deranged than the one before. Dead bodies. Severed fingers. Toking monkeys. Enraged Buddhist monks. The list goes on and on, and the laughs do indeed pile up.And yet, one cannot escape the fact that the entire movie is a slightly less funny retread of the original. From the narrative structure (both films start with a phone call to a distressed significant other) to the craziness to the jokes, we've heard this song before. Despite the great comic performances -- Galifianakis alone is worth the rental fee -- and clever use of the Bangkok reputation for depravity, the latest ""Hangover"" is as original and inspiring as its title.Here's hoping that the upcoming ""Hangover Part III"" takes the boys on an entirely new journey to the wild side.Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.",3,"Funny retread of the original, this time in Bangkok",1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,2013,"['Todd', 'Phillips', '2009', 'comic', 'masterpiece', 'Hangover', 'resurrected', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'brilliantly', 'demented', 'lost', 'weekend', 'Vegas', 'top-notch', 'work', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'stole', 'show', 'more', 'completely', 'actor', 'walked', 'away', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'raving', 'Jack', 'Black.Even', 'release', 'Hangover', 'made', 'bazillion', 'dollars', 'box', 'office', 'sequel', 'was', 'works', 'great', 'news', 'almost', 'entire', 'gang', 'back', 'Vegas', 'now', 'Bangkok', 'sequel', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'comfortably', 'married', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'taking', 'plunge', 'Lauren', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'family', 'still', 'Thailand', 'Stu', 'nothing', 'more', 'quiet', 'wedding', 'wisely', 'bachelor', 'party', 'brunch', 'Unfortunately', 'Stu', 'Alan', 'Galifianakis', 'wedding', 'better', 'instincts', 'Alan', 'tow', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 'accidental', 'mayhem', 'follow', 'spades.Once', 'again', 'boys', 'find', 'awakening', 'blinding', 'hangovers', 'blank', 'memories', 'missing', 'friend', 'Once', 'again', 'spend', 'movie', 'resurrecting', 'went', 'night', 'discovered', 'secret', 'more', 'deranged', 'one', 'before', 'Dead', 'bodies', 'Severed', 'fingers', 'Toking', 'monkeys', 'Enraged', 'Buddhist', 'monks', 'list', 'laughs', 'do', 'indeed', 'pile', 'up.And', 'yet', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'fact', 'entire', 'movie', 'slightly', 'less', 'funny', 'retread', 'original', 'narrative', 'structure', 'films', 'start', 'phone', 'call', 'distressed', 'significant', 'other', 'craziness', 'jokes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'song', 'before', 'great', 'comic', 'performances', 'Galifianakis', 'alone', 'rental', 'fee', 'clever', 'use', 'Bangkok', 'reputation', 'depravity', 'latest', 'Hangover', 'original', 'inspiring', 'hoping', 'upcoming', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'boys', 'entirely', 'new', 'journey', 'wild', 'side.Review', 'originally', 'published', 'MyDVDInsider.com']",N/A

It's hard to believe that you can take the cast from the original Hangover, one of the funniest movies of all time, place them in a similar scenario and produce a movie so awful that fully one-half of all viewers give it a ONE STAR rating.WARNING: ADULT SUBJECT MATTER....I place the majority of the blame on a thoroughly lousy ""plot"" and dialog that contains numerous wince-inducing, downright revolting scenes which are completely devoid of any real humor. For example: One of the main characters is the drunken (but willing) recipient of anal sex by a female impersonator and then, to make matters even worse, we are treated to several shots of the offending ""equipment"" and a graphic discussion of the exchange of fluids that occurred. Are there really people in the world who consider this to be hysterically funny? There weren't any around when I saw the movie, unless groans of disgust and asking for refunds are a new type of laughter.Such humorless sensory shocks are delivered repeatedly, until you are almost (mercifully) numb, and then, just when you thought your suffering might be over, Mike Tyson shows up to deliver the single worst, most off-key, god-awful rap performance in the history of recorded sound. If this movie were shown in a prison, it would be considered cruel and unusual punishment. Instead, it is foisted on the public by a group of people who HAD to realize just how awful it was, and yet released it anyway....for money.As my other reviews will indicate, I am no prude and love a good gross-out if it is hysterically funny, but disgusting, juvenile dialog and behavior without any redeeming humor are simply disgusting....and definitely not worth your time and money.

1403062,AMF52GSX309V0,B004EPZ06G,Tony S.,"[0, 0]","It's already been two years?  Holy wow, I can't believe how time flies!  In 2009, The Hangover became the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time.  Rightfully so.  With a blend of unique characters, a funny premise, and shock value to boot; it was a homerun.  It catapulted Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis to stardom.  And it proved director Todd Phillips was a someone with longevity in this business.The first movie followed the three main characters as they tried to find their lost friend after a night they couldn't remember.  The movie took place in Las Vegas and the city was a great backdrop to the story being told.  This time around, the &#34;Wolfpack&#34; finds themselves in a similar situation, only this time, they've lost a friend in Bangkok, Thailand.  Oh no... The Hangover II.What I liked about the film:The Wolfpack (including the monkey)This is an obvious one.  Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis have an unbelievable chemistry together.  The three actors feed and play off of each other so well, they're totally believable in their roles.Galifianakis steals most of the scenes again, as he did in the first film.  Helms plays the paranoid panic attack very well.  And the contrast to Helms is Bradley Cooper, who never seems to get phased by anything.  Ken Jeong and Paul Giamatti round out some great supporting characters as well.  And don't forget about the much talked about monkey.  Baby Carlos has NOTHING on the cigarette smoking, drug dealing monkey in the sequel.  It was cleverly worked into the film and actually served a purpose in the plot.  Great!The settingVegas was a great place to setup the last film.  It just made sense for the guys to wake up in their hotel room, not remembering much.  This time, they pushed the envelope.  Thailand is so visually busy, the movie will need a second viewing to catch everything.  Tying in Jeong's character into the setting was great.  Watching the movie, you got a real sense of how difficult it was for the cast and crew to work in such busy conditions.  I've read interviews with director, Phillips, where he says it was his most difficult shoot to date.The one-liners, memorableI hate when I go to a movie and leave not recalling a thing.  That wasn't the case with this film.  My wife and I left the theater repeating one-liner after the other.  I am well aware of all the criticisms of the film being identical to the first (I'll get to that in a minute), but the movie is very memorable and will hold up against a lot of other comedies out there.What I didn't like about the film:Sub-plotI find myself disliking a lot of film sub-plots.  It's because it feels like the movie wouldn't have suffered if they took it out completely.  Without giving anything away, the sub-plot involves Jeong and Giamatti's characters.  The writers used it as a device to take the main characters from one place to the next, but once the sub-plot is revealed in full, there's no pay off.  I didn't like it and wished they would have written it out of the movie.The Verdict:Loved it, KNOWING what I was walking intoI think people just wanted to hate the film.  &#34;It's exactly like the first one.&#34;  &#34;They couldn't have thought of anything better?&#34;  Interesting how you weren't criticizing the movie while laughing so hard I couldn't hear the dialogue.  Look, the first trailer showed us all that it was going to have the EXACT same format as the first film.  So I knew what I was getting myself into and was very content with it.  To me, it was fresh and funny in ways the first one wasn't; and it was enough to satisfy my hunger for another grown-up comedy after Bridesmaids.

It's bad, really bad except for two brief inspired sequences that the rest of the film hangs off of like a poorly cut suit.The Blu-ray looks positively stunning with colors that pop, nice, sharp detail and depth but no matter how well you dress up a pig, it's still a pig or, in this case, a turd.Audio also sounds great with a nice 5.1 lossless audio mix has plenty of kick for a comedy and puts you right in the middle of the action.We get an ""unauthorized"" documentary by a ""budding"" filmmaker to uncover what REALLY went on during the shooting of the movie. It's funnier than most of the movie. Seriously.We also get featurettes on the director's style, shooting on location in Thailand, the monkey, ""Action Mash-Up"" which pointlessly compiles some of the action scenes from the movie, a very unfunny gag reel and a DVD with a copy of the movie (let's not even discuss what appears to be the reviled Ultraviolet ""digital copy"").

Is there anyway I can get my two hours back?A summary of the plot follows (it'll save you two hours trust me on this).The plot is roughly the same as the first film except this time Stu (Ed Helms)is getting married (what happened to his first wife the stripper? We're never told). Stu has invited his friends Doug (Justin Bartha completely wasted here) and Phil (Bradley Cooper)his foul mouthed teacher buddy. Stu ends up inviting Alan (Zach Galifianakis)when he's pressured by Doug to his nuptials in Thailand. To insure that nothing goes wrong Stu has just one beer with his buddies but, of course, everything goes wrong. Stu, Alan and Phil wake up in a dive in Bangkok where they discover they've partied with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong)and lost Stu's brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee).",1,I felt like I had a hangover after watching this film--a really BAD one (almost as bad as this film).,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2786,"['Wish', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'couple', 'Alan', 'roofies', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'movie.Most', 'sequels', 'are', 'really', 'excuse', 'remake', 'first', 'film', 'less', 'originality', 'hopes', 'capturing', 'much', 'same', 'audience', 'are', 'exceptions', 'course', 'rule', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'Aliens', 'Spider-Man', 'II', 'are', 'popular', 'movies', 'where', 'sequel', 'measured', 'up', 'outdid', 'first', 'film', 'sparked', 'sequel', 'good', 'exceptional', '10', 'more', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'Hangover', 'II', 'latter', 'category', 'bad', 'really', 'bad', 'two', 'brief', 'inspired', 'sequences', 'rest', 'film', 'poorly', 'cut', 'suit.The', 'Blu-ray', 'positively', 'stunning', 'colors', 'pop', 'nice', 'sharp', 'detail', 'depth', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'dress', 'up', 'pig', 'still', 'pig', 'case', 'turd.Audio', 'also', 'great', 'nice', '5.1', 'lossless', 'audio', 'mix', 'plenty', 'kick', 'comedy', 'right', 'middle', 'action.We', 'get', 'unauthorized', 'documentary', 'budding', 'filmmaker', 'uncover', 'what', 'REALLY', 'went', 'shooting', 'movie', 'funnier', 'most', 'movie', 'Seriously.We', 'also', 'get', 'featurettes', 'director', 'style', 'shooting', 'location', 'Thailand', 'monkey', 'Action', 'Mash-Up', 'pointlessly', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'very', 'unfunny', 'gag', 'reel', 'DVD', 'copy', 'movie', 'let', 'not', 'even', 'discuss', 'what', 'be', 'reviled', 'Ultraviolet', 'digital', 'copy', 'most', 'folks', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Ultraviolet', 'copy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'paint', 'dry', 'fumes', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'everything', 'WRONG', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'right', 'exception', 'two', 'amusing', 'brief', 'sequences', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'again', 'least', 'Thailand', 'duplicating', 'same', 'plot', 'first', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'suggesting', 'watching', 'only', 'free', 'anyway', 'can', 'get', 'two', 'hours', 'back', 'summary', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'save', 'two', 'hours', 'trust', '.The', 'plot', 'roughly', 'same', 'first', 'film', 'time', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'getting', 'married', 'what', 'happened', 'first', 'wife', 'stripper', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'Stu', 'invited', 'friends', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'completely', 'wasted', 'here', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'teacher', 'buddy', 'Stu', 'up', 'inviting', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'when', 'pressured', 'Doug', 'nuptials', 'Thailand', 'insure', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Stu', 'just', 'one', 'beer', 'buddies', 'course', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Stu', 'Alan', 'Phil', 'wake', 'up', 'dive', 'Bangkok', 'where', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'partied', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'lost', 'Stu', 'brother-in-law', 'Teddy', 'Mason', 'Lee']",N/A
