There were some awesome songs in both the English and the Japanese version.  I definitely reccomend buying this DVD.,4,Pretty good DVD,1006387200,"11 22, 2001",2001,271,"['was', 'much', 'action', 'beginning', 'rest', 'DVD', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'Z', 'Fighters', 'worrying', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'defeat', 'androids', 'were', 'awesome', 'songs', 'English', 'Japanese', 'version', 'definitely', 'reccomend', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A
551697,A1G8UJKR1HFWAB,B00004U3VR,Bennett Russell,"[2, 3]","This tape is what I truly like about Dragonball! It is so cool! It gets  into the attitude of the Androids even. You even begin to see what is going  on while Goku is sick. This is one of the tapes with good animation. I  think that at times when a tape is completely filled with attacking and  fighting then they don't center on quality, but when there is not as much  movement then you can spend time on great detail. Another funny part is  that the big bad Android 16 is supposedly really scary looking but he is  playing with the birds! You get to see when Android 18 kisses Krillin for  some reason. (why would she kiss him with that voice? ) Anyways... this  tape is definitley for the Dragonball/Anime fan. If you are too anxious to  wait for those New Episodes on Cartoon Network or you just want the Uncut  version then get this! I highly recommend it. I wish they would cut out  that long advertisement for the DBZ toys and the DBZ web site. I guess not  everything is perfect! :)",5,Incredible Anime!,969235200,"09 18, 2000",2000,990,"['tape', 'what', 'truly', 'Dragonball', 'so', 'cool', 'attitude', 'Androids', 'even', 'even', 'begin', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'Goku', 'sick', 'one', 'tapes', 'good', 'animation', 'think', 'times', 'when', 'tape', 'completely', 'filled', 'attacking', 'fighting', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'center', 'quality', 'when', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'movement', 'then', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'great', 'detail', 'funny', 'part', 'big', 'bad', 'Android', '16', 'supposedly', 'really', 'scary', 'looking', 'playing', 'birds', 'get', 'see', 'when', 'Android', '18', 'kisses', 'Krillin', 'reason', 'why', 'would', 'kiss', 'voice', 'Anyways', 'tape', 'definitley', 'Dragonball/Anime', 'fan', 'are', 'too', 'anxious', 'wait', 'New', 'Episodes', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'just', 'want', 'Uncut', 'version', 'then', 'get', 'highly', 'recommend', 'wish', 'would', 'cut', 'out', 'long', 'advertisement', 'DBZ', 'toys', 'DBZ', 'web', 'site', 'guess', 'not', 'everything', 'perfect']",N/A

551701,A239C7RR4W0E15,B00004U3VR,Steve Cataldo,"[5, 5]","There is currently no word to explain the, sweetness, of this video.  Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin, Tien, and Yamcha(at times) have the  hard task of rewritting the past, and keeping themselves alive.  Sadly for  them, Goku is still incapacitated with the heart virus, and offers no help.  Infact, Goku at times holds them back because they have to worry about his  safety!  The Androids have been programed to fight and destroy Goku, but  these renegade androids do as they will.  Goku is still their main  priority, but they decide to have a little fun with the Z Warriors first.  No Match for the Androids is an understatement.  The Z Warriors were  completly outclassed and outmatched in every possible way. Though, the  Super Saiyan Vegeta still thinks he can beat them, Android 17 and 18 will  attempt to prove him wrong.  In Last Effort, the Androids have  left(not retreated), but left the Z Warriors wallowing in pain. Krillin was  spared for the moment,so he was able to Senzu the needing fighters.  Vegeta, outraged that he as a Super Saiyan wasn't strong enough, flew away  in a tantrum to an unknown location.  While the remaining people talk  strategy, Piccolo grows weary and annoyed.  He yells, and flies off to go  to Kami's tower.  His intentions are unknown.  Closing In, the  Android take their time on wheels to Goku's house.  An unlucky bunch of  highway gang members try to take them on. Unbeknownst to them, they are in  for &quot;the ride&quot; of their lives.  Meanwhile, Piccolo gives Kami  something to think about as he finally makes his intentions clear as to why  he flew away to Kami's lookout.  Kami, unsure as of what to say, decides to  let things play out and see what happens.  Unwelcomed Discovery.  That sums up whats in this episode.  Someone has radios in to Bulma about  finding a spaceship that has the word CAPSULE on it.  Bulma is intrigued.  She gets a picture of the spaceship, and recognizes it.  The Z-Warriors  pick up Goku and are bringing him to Master Roshi's to keep him safe from  the Androids.  While they're flying, Bulma sends Trunks a picture of the  spaceship, and much to his surprise, he recognizes it too. But, thats  impossible, how can that spaceship be what it is, if Trunks has his with  him?",5,Rewriting the past is harder then it seems.,968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,2262,"['currently', 'word', 'explain', 'sweetness', 'video', 'Vegeta', 'Gohan', 'Piccolo', 'Krillin', 'Tien', 'Yamcha', 'times', 'have', 'hard', 'task', 'rewritting', 'past', 'keeping', 'alive', 'Sadly', 'Goku', 'still', 'incapacitated', 'heart', 'virus', 'help', 'Infact', 'Goku', 'times', 'back', 'have', 'worry', 'safety', 'Androids', 'have', 'been', 'programed', 'fight', 'destroy', 'Goku', 'renegade', 'androids', 'do', 'will', 'Goku', 'still', 'main', 'priority', 'decide', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'Z', 'Warriors', 'first', 'No', 'Match', 'Androids', 'understatement', 'Z', 'Warriors', 'were', 'completly', 'outclassed', 'outmatched', 'possible', 'way', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'Vegeta', 'still', 'can', 'beat', 'Android', '17', '18', 'will', 'attempt', 'prove', 'wrong', 'Last', 'Effort', 'Androids', 'have', 'left', 'not', 'retreated', 'left', 'Z', 'Warriors', 'wallowing', 'pain', 'Krillin', 'was', 'spared', 'moment', 'was', 'able', 'Senzu', 'needing', 'fighters', 'Vegeta', 'outraged', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'flew', 'away', 'tantrum', 'unknown', 'location', 'remaining', 'people', 'talk', 'strategy', 'Piccolo', 'weary', 'annoyed', 'flies', 'go', 'Kami', 'tower', 'intentions', 'are', 'unknown', 'Closing', 'Android', 'take', 'time', 'wheels', 'Goku', 'house', 'unlucky', 'bunch', 'highway', 'gang', 'members', 'try', 'take', 'Unbeknownst', 'are', 'quot', 'ride', 'quot', 'lives', 'Meanwhile', 'Piccolo', 'Kami', 'something', 'think', 'finally', 'intentions', 'clear', 'why', 'flew', 'away', 'Kami', 'lookout', 'Kami', 'unsure', 'what', 'say', 'decides', 'let', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'Unwelcomed', 'Discovery', 'sums', 'up', 'whats', 'episode', 'Someone', 'radios', 'Bulma', 'finding', 'spaceship', 'word', 'CAPSULE', 'Bulma', 'intrigued', 'picture', 'spaceship', 'Z-Warriors', 'pick', 'up', 'Goku', 'are', 'bringing', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'keep', 'safe', 'Androids', ""'re"", 'flying', 'Bulma', 'picture', 'spaceship', 'much', 'surprise', 'too', 'thats', 'impossible', 'how', 'can', 'spaceship', 'be', 'what', 'Trunks']",N/A
