1406777,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004GEFAII,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","It was known as the largest investigation in Austria's post-war history.  In the late '80s, over 450 police officers trying to capture the most elusive criminal in the country, Austrian marathon runner Johann Kastenberger.  A man known for robbing banks while wearing a Ronald Regan mask and was known as ""Shotgun Ronnie"", also a man wanted for murder.Austrian author Martin Prinz would write the novel ""Der R&auml;uber"" loosely based on the true-life story which would later receive a film adaptation courtesy of director/screenwriter Benjamin Heisenberg (""Sleeper"", ""At the Lake"").  The film was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.The film would star actor Andreas Lust (""Revanche"", ""Fast Forward"", ""Munich"") and actress Franziska Weisz (""Hotel"", ""Dog Days"").VIDEO:""The Robber"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  The transfer looks absolutely wonderful as it features the beautiful cinematography of Reinhold Vorschneider.  While overall picture quality is more towards the ""cooler"" side in terms of colors, the overall image looks good with some indoor scenes having higher levels of noise.  But for those most part, there is wonderful amount of detail, you can see the detail of clothing and surfaces of objects.If I did have a negative about the video, it was not more of the video but the fact that some scenes are extremely dark.  From the lovemaking scenes between Johann and Erika, for several minutes, you can barely make out certain images but I suppose that Reinhold Vorschneider wanted to capture natural colors and natural environments which I do understand.But sticking with Kino's rule of non-modifications to their Blu-ray release, the overall picture quality for ""The Robber"" is very good!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Der R&auml;uber"" is presented in German DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and the lossless soundtrack is primarily dialogue, but there are some scenes such as Johann stealing a car and we are greeted with various styles of music.  The film also presents quite a bit of ambient noise, may it be during scenes with crowds at the marathon to the sounds of the police (cars or copters) that are chasing after him.But overall, lossless audio is good for this film.  Nothing too immersive but works perfectly for this film.Optional English subtitles are presented.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Robber"" comes with Kino Lorber trailers and stills for the film.EXTRAS:""The Robber"" comes with a slipcase cover.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Robber"" is a loosely-based film on the actual events that took place in Austria back in the mid-to-late '80s.There are obvious differences from the film and the actual true-to-life story as the real Johann probably was involved in multiple murders and of course, the final events depicted in the film.  But if there is one thing to say about this film, director Benjamin Heisenberg's goal was to create film without following Hollywood banality and providing a reason of  why this man has become a robber.Is he stealing because his family is in financially in trouble, money for lifestyle reasons, stealing because he wanted to help the poor or someone in the family or is it one man's way of creating excitement in his life?  There is typically a reason given of why one would risk their life and that would help the viewer understand why they commit these criminal acts.For ""The Robber"", one can psychoanalyze the situation and probably think that his robberies is his entertainment, his excitement, his version of instant pleasure.  He's not a man that goes out and spends the money on whatever he wants.  He just robs banks, stashes the money and doesn't indulge in it.  In fact, he's probably a man that is fixated on the risk of being caught and being able to runaway from it.And that is possibly the intention of Johann Rettenberg.  He is a man who has run away from things.  Possibly an altruistic individual.  His life, danger...he keeps on running, he keeps pushing himself to be in this top condition and surely enough, he beats marathon records but when there is no marathon, what does a man who enjoys running do?  While the obvious answer is train...train and train, perhaps he needs a little more excitement in his life and thus robbing banks and the danger associated with it, is what fuels him?And just to read the story of the real life Johann, it's hard to fathom how a wanted man was captured but escapes and is able to elude authorities.  It's what makes ""The Robber"" have such a unique scene never seen in a movie, a man's escape and he keeps running away from authorities, literally.  There is not much focused on the actual drama that surrounds this character, we just watch and see how long he can elude authorities and how.As for the Blu-ray release, ""The Robber"" looks great on Blu-ray and the lossless soundtrack is quite adequate for this film, as it is front and center-channel driven for its dialogue and ambiance.  Unfortunately, there are no special features aside from trailers and stills, but I was hoping to hear an audio commentary track or see a featurette on the making of the film.Implausible as the real-life story may seem, many of these events indeed happened. I felt that director Benjamin Heisenberg made the right decision to end it the way he did, rather than follow the go out with a bang storyline (which happened to the real-life Johann).Overall, ""The Robber"" is an intriguing heist action film.  Granted, it's not heavy in the drama department, nor did I find it ebullient.  The film will not give  you any answers of why Johann does what he does, but still, ""The Robber"" was exciting and different nonetheless.  The cinematography by Reihold Vorschneider and the planning for the various scenes were well done and I definitely was hooked.",4,"An exciting heist, action  film based on the real life story of

1406778,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B004GEFAII,Doctor.Generosity,"[1, 2]","A spare, minimalist Austrian film (in German, with English subtitles), skillfully rendered. We first see the subject as a thin man in his thirties, in prison for robbery. At the same time he is a dedicated long distance runner, so much so he has convinced the authorities to place a training treadmill in his cell. But for unclear reasons he is deeply angry, committed to his path of defiance no matter the cost. When released from prison, he unhesitatingly reverts to criminality, in a series of daring daylight bank robberies. Simultaneously he trains for and wins some significant marathons. His diamond hard way of life is humanized only by the relationship he forms with a woman; of course this becomes his downfall. The script has its origin in the real life story of one Johann Kastenberger, but has been appropriately fictionalized to work as a film.A straightforward dramatic development, in the form of a Greek tragedy, with the action narrowing down until only one possible outcome remains. The opaque psychology of the criminal mind is portrayed without being discussed as such; here is someone focussed enough to be able to succeed in a normal life if he would choose. But he will not choose. ""What I do,"" he tells his woman friend, ""has no relation to what you call life.""That is as much as we are told about his thinking. Indeed there are sparse words in the movie. Instead the story is told in cinematography, as it should be in film art of high order, with simplicity, in a near documentary style. The shots are natural, not flashy, with nothing extra, yet the director manages to create more tension in one straightforward chase through the Austrian countryside than a dozen tricked out James Bond spectacles. A clean, elegant work of art. I was impressed with director Heisenberg, whose disciplined cinematic style may have something to do with his descent from two generations of scientists. I look forward to further work from him.",5,Superb film art,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,1952,"['spare', 'minimalist', 'Austrian', 'film', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'skillfully', 'rendered', 'first', 'see', 'subject', 'thin', 'man', 'thirties', 'prison', 'robbery', 'same', 'time', 'dedicated', 'long', 'distance', 'runner', 'so', 'much', 'convinced', 'authorities', 'place', 'training', 'treadmill', 'cell', 'unclear', 'reasons', 'deeply', 'angry', 'committed', 'path', 'defiance', 'matter', 'cost', 'When', 'released', 'prison', 'unhesitatingly', 'criminality', 'series', 'daring', 'daylight', 'bank', 'robberies', 'Simultaneously', 'significant', 'marathons', 'diamond', 'hard', 'way', 'life', 'humanized', 'only', 'relationship', 'woman', 'course', 'downfall', 'script', 'origin', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'one', 'Johann', 'Kastenberger', 'been', 'appropriately', 'fictionalized', 'work', 'film.A', 'straightforward', 'dramatic', 'development', 'form', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'action', 'narrowing', 'down', 'only', 'one', 'possible', 'outcome', 'opaque', 'psychology', 'criminal', 'mind', 'portrayed', 'being', 'discussed', 'such', 'here', 'someone', 'focussed', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'succeed', 'normal', 'life', 'would', 'choose', 'will', 'not', 'choose', 'What', 'do', 'woman', 'friend', 'relation', 'what', 'call', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'told', 'thinking', 'Indeed', 'are', 'sparse', 'words', 'movie', 'Instead', 'story', 'told', 'cinematography', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'art', 'high', 'order', 'simplicity', 'near', 'documentary', 'style', 'shots', 'are', 'natural', 'not', 'flashy', 'nothing', 'extra', 'director', 'create', 'more', 'tension', 'one', 'straightforward', 'chase', 'Austrian', 'countryside', 'dozen', 'tricked', 'out', 'James', 'Bond', 'spectacles', 'clean', 'elegant', 'work', 'art', 'was', 'impressed', 'director', 'Heisenberg', 'disciplined', 'cinematic', 'style', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'descent', 'two', 'generations', 'scientists', 'look', 'forward', 'further', 'work']",N/A

In fact the 'why' of what is driving Andreas in his life is never explored or revealed in this film. He's gifted athletically; his Parole Agent & others bend over backwards to help him; and yet he seems to be a complete, unfeeling, 'zombie' hurtling towards self destruction.

He promptly (as in: the next day upon his release) goes back to robbing banks in and around Vienna. While he was in prison, he trained for long-distance running, and soon we see him running marathons in Vienna (where he promtply sets a national record) and elsewhere Austria. Johann meets social worker and one-time family friend Erika (""You're all grown up"", he remarks), and she gives him a room to stay at her place. Of course they strike up a relationship, even though Johann remains the ultimate loner, living from robbery to marathon, as if his adrenaline drives him to that. Eventually Erika finds out Johann is robbing banks, and the police gets on him too. To tell you more would be to ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.Several comments: first, Andreas Lust brings a terrific performance as the loner Johann, with steely nerves and determination. Second, there are a number of great cat-and-mouse sequences (not all of them chase scenes) between Johann and the police as they track him down, just riveting. Third, this movie was released on DVD in the US last year and the DVD box notes that ""this movie is already slated for a Hollywood remake"". I haven't heard anything about that yet, but if Hollywood does remake it, I can only hope that they will keep the same grim yet riveting tone of this Austrian movie (I somehow doubt it).In all, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.
