1006216,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000GRU09I,Bobby Underwood,"[89, 91]","For five wonderful seasons, ""Hart to Hart"" was about the most fun you could have in an hour without getting into any trouble. Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers were simply perfect as the rich couple with nothing to do but solve murders. They were Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, living the fun life we all wished we had. The chemistry between Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner was natural and you could always tell, especially with Wagner, that they were having a ball.Sidney Sheldon created the characters but it was really a stroke of genius to cast Wagner and Powers. Wagner took his cool Alexander Munday persona from ""It Takes a Thief"" and just made him richer and happier, with a lovely companion he got to keep. Stefanie Powers always had a certain something but had never really found the right part, until Hart to Hart. Jennifer Hart came so naturally that you couldn't help thinking she wasn't really acting at all. Come to think of it, the same could be said of Robert Wagner's seemingly effortless turn as Jonathan Hart.This was heaven for light mystery fans. There was always plenty of fun banter between Jonathan and ""Mrs. H"" and enough humorous situations mixed in with the latest week's adventure to keep everyone tickled pink. Not to be undervalued as the reason the show was such a big hit, was Lionel Stander's role as their butler, Max. Max was much more like family than hired help, and in the show's opening every week, you knew right away Max was an important part of the proceedings. After introducing the self-made millionaire, Jonathan, and his other boss, Mrs. H, Max always stated that he had trouble taking care of them, because their hobby was murder!Not to be forgotten, of course, was their lovable dog, Freeway, who sometimes forgot who was the owner and who was the pet. The stories were frivilous fun, as this wasn't real danger, just TV danger, and we always new our favorite husband and wife would solve the mystery and uncork some champagne at the end.Fans of the show were delighted when the first season of this fun show finally got a DVD release and are once again made happy by the release of season two. A lot happened in the second season as the show just kept getting better. Jonathan had amnesia after an accident and forgot a murder in one episode. In another, Jennifer was kidnapped. Max's ex-wife showed up and caused tons of trouble. And Jennifer was stalked by a mummy when a not so ancient body was found in an Egyptian sarcophagus! ""Hart to Hart"" was delightful escapist fare. Mark Snow's ""Hart to Hart"" theme at the opening of the show was light and breezy, and fans looked forward to hearing it every week. Snow would finally become famous for his moody theme for ""The X-Files.""The episodes for season two are as follows: Murder, Murder On The Wall, What Murder?, This Lady is Murder, Murder is Man's Best Friend, 'Tis the Season To Be Murdered, Murder Wrap, Murder In Paradise, Ex-Wives Can Be Murder, Murder is a Drag, Hart-Shaped Murder, Slow Boat to Murder, Murder in the Saddle, Homemade Murder, Solid Gold Murder, Getting Aweigh with Murder, The Murder of Jonathan Hart, The Latest In High Fashion Murder, Operation Murder, Murder Takes A Bow, Blue Chip MurderThe domestic and mystery adventures of the self-made man, Jonathan, and his ex-journalist wife, Jennifer, made for a charming and breezy hour of pleasure. The adventures of the spohisticated couple, who it turned out were just like us, only rich, was a great way to unwind at the end of a long day, and still is. Every TV mystery fan will want to pick this one up. So pop the cork from the champagne in the limo, call ahead to make sure the private jet is waiting, and jot off to TV land, where rich and attractive couples delight us by solving murders while living the life of leisure for a second season.

Unfortunately, Sony has no plans to release seasons 3-5. Nevertheless, you will never regret buying this series.

I love mysteries and what I love more is the concept of two people who love each other, do not have affairs, have money and love to solve mysteries! What could be better.  The relationship between them and Max (who is more like a father figure) and of, course, Freeway, makes you feel that life can offer you the best of everything.  The TV shows of today, especially the reality shows, must be the concept of someone who has the mind if a two year old. They are absolutely the pits.  That is why most of us who love mysteries are just soaking up the DVD's of yesteryear (Simon & Simon, Charlie Chan, Murder She Wrote, Michael Shayne movies, etc.) I think it is a sad commentary on our society that shows that were made over 25 years ago are better than the shows of today, especially with all the special effects technology that has come into being. We do not want to see chainsaw massacres and blood. We want to see mysteries and enjoy our detectives solving them.  In any event, I hope that Season Three comes out very soon.

Back then, it looked sleek, chic, exciting, everything you could ask for from a tv show...just like Charlie's Angels... or Vega$... I remember them all...Almost 30 years later, it looks so dated... so different from today's fast paced, violent, end-twisting, loud, in-your-face TV.STILL we love it. The stories are so simple... and Wagner and Powers had so much charm... so much style.Let me add that today I guess I still secretly dream about having a 1978 Mercedes-Benz yellow wagon with that big telephone (laughs). It used to be so super cool!!!Wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 year-old kid just being introduced to late 70's television - the jokes, the kitchens, the hairdos, the telephones, VCRs, big cars, disco...Oh, and I loved Mark Snow's theme. I recognized it instantly...And Max's introduction to Mr. and Mrs. H... whose hobby is murder!!!Do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class' during the late 70's? Watch Hart to Hart. Everything was great. Everything was ideal!What a great show!Thanks for the memory.PS... someday, someone will write a History of american society through the 20th century's TV shows' point of view.

You'll feel like you've been travelling in high style and on your trip... you fall in love.  The romance of the Harts is captivating.  The mysteries are campy, amusing & on occasion heart-pounding.  As they start up their Bentley, come along for a ride of intrigue or jump into their jet for a flight of fancy.  Either way, chasing criminals has never been so elegant.If possible, season two (1980/81) is bigger & better.  Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) is even more beautiful and so are her clothes (thank you designer Nolan Miller).  Jonathan (Robert Wagner) has that devil-may-care twinkle in his eyes times two.  And the double entendres and banter are funny and saucy.  Jonathan to Jennifer as she rescues him from a gun-wielding gold thief:  ""Darling, did I ever compliment you on your perfect timing?""  Jennifer:  ""Yes, but not in public.""Great scenery abounds as they travel to Manhattan, Hawaii, Colorado & a Bahamian cruise.  They also celebrate with Christmas & Valentine's episodes.  Some standouts:  ""'Tis the Season to be Murdered,"" ""Murder in the Saddle"" and ""What Murder?"" where Wagner shows great acting skills as Jonathan gets amnesia, and we get some backstory on the characters.  Chase scenes ruled season one, and there are still some of those, but costumes rule season two.  Watch for:  Santa, an elf, Rhett, Scarlett, Stefanie playing Jennifer's lookalike and an image of Max in drag that I'll never get out of my head.Too cute for costumes, Freeway, their dog, is a scene-stealer.  I laughed out loud when a man drops dead on a cruise, and Freeway irreverently stands his front paws on him. Other funny scenes include a black-tie affair in a grungy gym for a bodybuilding pose-off, complete with ""Macho Man"" blaring in the background.  The campy moments only add to the fun of a show that often is tongue-in-cheek.For more fun, watch for these guest spots:  Jerry Stiller, Shari Belafonte, Anthony Newley, John Gavin, Amy Madigan, Jane Withers and others.I highly recommend season two; I also highly recommend they release seasons 3-5.  It's a pleasure to bask in the Harts' glow.  At the end of each show, Jonathan & Jennifer will leave you with a quip, a kiss or a romantic moment...and you will be left with a smile.",5,King and Queen of Harts,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,2303,"['Hart', 'Hart', 'glitters', 'screen', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'travelling', 'high', 'style', 'trip', 'fall', 'love', 'romance', 'Harts', 'captivating', 'mysteries', 'are', 'campy', 'amusing', 'occasion', 'heart-pounding', 'start', 'up', 'Bentley', 'come', 'ride', 'intrigue', 'jump', 'jet', 'flight', 'fancy', 'way', 'chasing', 'criminals', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'elegant.If', 'possible', 'season', 'two', '1980/81', 'bigger', 'better', 'Jennifer', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'so', 'are', 'clothes', 'thank', 'designer', 'Nolan', 'Miller', 'Jonathan', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'devil-may-care', 'twinkle', 'eyes', 'times', 'two', 'double', 'entendres', 'banter', 'are', 'funny', 'saucy', 'Jonathan', 'Jennifer', 'gun-wielding', 'gold', 'thief', 'Darling', 'did', 'ever', 'compliment', 'perfect', 'timing', 'Jennifer', 'Yes', 'not', 'public', 'Great', 'scenery', 'travel', 'Manhattan', 'Hawaii', 'Colorado', 'Bahamian', 'cruise', 'also', 'celebrate', 'Christmas', 'Valentine', 'episodes', 'standouts', 'Season', 'be', 'Murdered', 'Murder', 'Saddle', 'What', 'Murder', 'where', 'Wagner', 'great', 'acting', 'skills', 'Jonathan', 'amnesia', 'get', 'backstory', 'characters', 'Chase', 'scenes', 'ruled', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'still', 'costumes', 'rule', 'season', 'two', 'Watch', 'Santa', 'elf', 'Rhett', 'Scarlett', 'Stefanie', 'playing', 'Jennifer', 'lookalike', 'image', 'Max', 'drag', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'head.Too', 'cute', 'costumes', 'Freeway', 'dog', 'scene-stealer', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'man', 'dead', 'cruise', 'Freeway', 'irreverently', 'front', 'paws', 'Other', 'funny', 'scenes', 'include', 'black-tie', 'affair', 'grungy', 'gym', 'bodybuilding', 'pose-off', 'complete', 'Macho', 'Man', 'blaring', 'background', 'campy', 'only', 'add', 'fun', 'show', 'often', 'tongue-in-cheek.For', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'guest', 'spots', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'Shari', 'Belafonte', 'Anthony', 'Newley', 'John', 'Gavin', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Jane', 'Withers', 'others.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season', 'two', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'release', 'seasons', '3-5', 'pleasure', 'bask', 'Harts', 'glow', 'end', 'show', 'Jonathan', 'Jennifer', 'will', 'leave', 'quip', 'kiss', 'romantic', 'moment', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'smile']",Hart to Hart - The Complete Second Season
