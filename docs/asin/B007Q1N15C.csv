Lee Remick is his Physchiatrist and Lino Ventura as the dectective. This is a very solid movie with good performances and a script that pulls you in.

I thought at first that someone should do a modern remake of it, and then I thought better.  Only Richard Burton could have created such a complex character; a man that both scares you and intriques you at the same time. All the actors were first rate and the direction was both tight and well-paced.A fine example of what I would call ""quiet terror"".  The kind of terror that lurks just outside of normal life, but is ready to breach the veil and come into our world and make us remember that we do not know everything and that we are not totally in control.Well worth the viewing.",5,Not soon forgotten,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,645,"['movie', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'have', 'watched', 'thought', 'first', 'someone', 'should', 'do', 'modern', 'remake', 'then', 'thought', 'better', 'Only', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'complex', 'character', 'man', 'scares', 'intriques', 'same', 'time', 'actors', 'were', 'first', 'rate', 'direction', 'was', 'tight', 'well-paced.A', 'fine', 'example', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'quiet', 'terror', 'kind', 'terror', 'just', 'outside', 'normal', 'life', 'ready', 'breach', 'veil', 'come', 'world', 'make', 'remember', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'everything', 'are', 'not', 'totally', 'control.Well', 'viewing']",N/A

""Mr. Z.""","[0, 0]","You take actors like a per-usual, very intense Richard Burton, the very talented, very beautiful, very capable Lee Remick (yes, I'm clearly a fan) add Lino Ventura, and a very unusual, well-written story and what you get is one heck of a movie that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go for one nanosecond.  Watching Burton's mania and totally self-absorbed character seemingly murder dozens if not hundreds of unsuspecting people time and time again is bound to chill you right down to your spinal column.  Ms. Remick plays a head-doctor who starts out thinking the man's is just off his 'nut', and refuses to believe that his claims of the 'power' of mass-destruction aren't just in his mind.  It's only after she 'witnesses', from a distance and news bulletins that people are dropping like flies with increased frequency, and it's only when these 'accidents' are not so easily explained, that she begins to think there might be more to the man's 'story' after all.  Then things get really ugly as....Just don't get the VHS tape with the picture of electricity charges shooting out of each of Burton's eyes, in opposite directions.  I bought this tape, only to find out, to my horror that the movie was recorded at the SLP, 6-hour speed, which is just about the worst thing you can do with ANY movie.  Burton and Remick's work deserves far better treatment than this mess.  As they say over and over....
