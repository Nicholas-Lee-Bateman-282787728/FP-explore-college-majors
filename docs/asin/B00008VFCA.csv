I don't care what you `My Name Is Earl' fans have to say about it, this film forever killed Jason Lee for me.  It made me hate him.  To be fair, I remember nothing about this film.  It was that bad.  The plot is forgettable and predictable and full of clich&eacute;s.  I love Julia Stiles.  Yes, she has absolutely no career at the moment, but she deserved one.  She had such fire and spunk and undeniable charm.  I seriously was in love with her at one point.  I would welcome her back to cinema with open arms.  She is the only favorable memory of have of this film (that, and Selma Blair's backside, which is always favorable).  The gags are ridiculous and the whole premise is just begging to be picked apart and crucified.

None of the characters are very multi-dimensional and were it not for the language and a few parts of the subject matter, you would think you are viewing a television sitcom.Much of the humor is obvious and sometimes the movie strains for credibility, but it was overall an entertaining film.  There are some parts in it that show comedic genius, while others resort to the humor of fourth grade school children.As a fan of Earl Nightingale, I was pleased to see a part of his famous work, &quot;The Strangest Secret&quot; in this movie.  What was never made clear is why the character was listening to Seattle's &quot;Dr. Earl&quot; in the first place, or how it affected him.

I mean the way they portrayed men was just TERRIBLE! The movie made it seem as if it's &quot;ok&quot; to cheat because it's &quot;The Hunt.&quot; It was so ridiculous.All the lies and betrayal were NOT funny! How can some guy trying to lie to his soon-to-be bride about waking up with some woman in his bed be comical? Ladies this film is demeaning! All you good men out there with morals, this is demeaning!I found NOTHING funny about this movie. I kept thinking that since it was just so ridiculous that at the end Julia Stiles' character wouldn't go for the character of Jason Lee because of all the craziness and lies that went on.The only good thing was that Selma Blair's character found some &quot;good&quot; guy at the end of the movie but he obviously wasn't a great guy to everyone because it was his brother's ex fiance he had been in love with all this time!I love funny movies but I found it ridiculous to think that a female cousin would lie to another female cousin about something as serious as marriage. This movie made marriage look like a joke instead of a loving lifelong commitment.I gave it a 1 because it makes people look like nothing but selfish liars! I love Selma Blair and Julia Stiles' movies but this one was just a waste! I can't wait to see these two talented young women do a film worthwhile again.

747660,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B00008VFCA,Charity Bishop,"[1, 1]","The film is far from perfect, but kind of enjoyable on a purely shallow level. It's a fun experience seeing two popular actresses interact, while the humor is actually funny -- a rarity in comedies these days. A Guy Thing is more sarcasm than anything else, but while remaining predictable, manages to pack in a few decent moments along the way.It's only a week until the wedding, and life around mild-mannered Paul (Jason Lee) is hectic. His future in-laws are wealthy and snobbish. His own parents are humiliating and funny. His fiance Karen (Selma Blair) is just about too good to be true. And then something happens that sends his world spinning out of orbit. He wakes up one morning with a Tiki dancer in his bed. One too many drinks at his bachelor party has brought Becky (Julia Stiles) into his life. Believing he has cheated on Karen with her, he desperately attempts to conceal this major blunder from the curiosity of family and friends, hoping he'll never run into the fun loving blonde again. But she just keeps appearing in his life ... taking tickets at a local parking lot, stocking shelves at the nearby store ...And then comes the major whammy, the discovery that she is Karen's cousin. Believing this won't completely get out of hand, Paul is certain he can handle it -- and then come the photographs. They're in the hands of Becky's psychotic ex-boyfriend, who is happiest when beating ""not-so-innocent"" bystanders into a pulp. Becky is like no one he has ever met, willing to face life with high expectations and squeeze every last drop of excitement out of it. She's everything that Karen isn't, a fact that slowly begins to seep into him as the wedding days draw ever-nearer. Mostly predictable in the sense that we can see the conclusion a mile away, A Guy Thing does suffer from being a little crude, but there was something likable about it. Becky and Karen are as different as they can possibly be, but each are so eccentric and likable that you cannot help being torn between wanting to see Becky wind up with Paul, and hoping that Karen doesn't get hurt along the way.There are some instances of innuendo. Paul enjoys dancing with his male instructor, a fact that gets on Karen's nerves. Becky is undressed (implied) when she wakes up in his bed, but in actuality the two didn't have sex (he passed out before it went that far). To her credit, Becky did not realize he was the groom, and freaks out when she finds out. Unable to find her underwear, she is forced to leave it behind, creating further problems when Paul attempts to hide it. Naturally, Karen finds it later, leading to a series of lies in an attempt to cover the incident up. An old woman, determined to have alcohol at a family dinner, forces the cook to oblige by squeezing his privates. Paul contracts a mild sexual ailment from a dirty toilet seat, leading him to discreetly scratch his privates at a business meeting. He is later humiliated when sales clerks yell back and forth about the medication he wishes to buy for it. The ""pictures"" are never shown, and presumably not that risqu, but a minister opposes the fact that his son found them in a dumpster. Guests are unknowingly fed marijuana-laced gravy at a dinner party, leading to general chaos. Paul also fakes diarrhea to get out of coming downstairs, squeezing shampoo into the toilet to make a decent sound effect. The s-word is used a number of times, along with a couple unfortunate abuses of Jesus' name.On the positive side, no one is very hurt by the endless escapades, a dirty cop is put away, an emphasis on ultimately being honest is made after endless deceptions, and the minister urges Paul to be honest about his feelings at the wedding. It's not a movie that is going to make it onto my must-buy list, but it was funnier than expected and had more than a few good moments.

747662,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00008VFCA,David M. Lovin,"[1, 1]","This is yet another by the numbers effort from Hollywood.  Why is it that every ""romantic comedy"" we see these days involves the same elements over and over?  How familiar does this sound?  Boy is engaged to girl.  Boy meets new girl.  Boy gets involved with new girl and tries to keep it from fiancee.  Boy gets to know new girl and finds out she is not too bad.  In the end, boy must choose which girl to be with.Ho hum.  Five minutes in, I knew what the ending would be.  Along the way, there is the requisite number of sight gags and sex jokes, like having to stash someone's underwear somewhere in the apartment where the fiancee would not find it.  Do you think it will get found?  Please.  How about a priest living across the hall who happens to show up to look disapprovingly whenever something lurid is happening?  (that's pretty often)  By the way, no points for guessing that he will magically be the priest chosen to be at the ""big"" wedding scene at the end.The only redeeming quality about the movie is the cast, particularly Julia Stiles as Becky(new girl) and Selma Blair as Karen(fiancee)  The twist here is that they are cousins, so it's all in the family.  Stiles is fun to watch and seems to really carry every scene she is in.  Blair, who is often cast as a real beast in her movies, could have seemed more sympathetic than the script allows her to be  Maybe that's so Jason Lee's choice will be easier in the end.All in all, nothing special at all.  You've seen it a thousand times before and you'll see it again.

747663,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00008VFCA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Sure, we have seen it before in film.  Man or woman is preparing to get married but somehow before they get married, they meet someone that they connect with.And sure, these films are part of the banality of romantic comedies but if done well and if it does its job in entertaining the masses, then it has done its job.In 2003, ""A Guy Thing"" was released in theaters and personally, I was intrigued because its leading man was usual funny guy Jason Lee (who at the time was known for his appearance on Kevin Smith films ""Chasing Amy"", ""Mallrats"", ""Dogma"") and the two female actresses were Selma Blair (""Cruel Intentions"", ""Legally Blonde"", ""Hellboy"", ""Zoe"") and Julia Stiles (""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""Save the Last Dance"", ""The Bourne Identity"").Also, it would be the first romantic comedy from new director Chris Koch who directed ""Snow Day"" (who is now known for directing the TV series ""My Name is Earl"", ""Scrubs, ""Cougar Town"" and ""Traffic Light"").So, I figured it was a first for these talents and the filmmaker and coming into the film with possibly low expectations, I actually came out of the theater enjoying the film, knowing I had a good number of laughs throughout and for the most part, being entertained.VIDEO:""A Guy Thing"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  As part of the catalog titles being released on Blu-ray by Twentieth Century Fox and MGM, picture quality for ""A Guy Thing"" tends to look good most of the time.  There is a good amount of grain, black levels are nice and deep and skin tones are natural.But I did detect white speckles showing up from time-to-time and also banding and possibly low-artifacting during scenes with certain lighting.  Granted, by no means is this going to affect anyone's viewing of the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""A Guy Thing"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Dolby Surround and French 5.1 DTS.  Lossless audio was actually pretty good for this film.  Typically for romantic comedies, they are dialogue and music driven but because this film has crowd scenes, even various action-related scenes, the surround channel is used quite a bit.  So, there is good use of the ambiance through the surround channels more than most romantic comedies that I have come across on Blu-ray.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""A Guy Thing"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Chris Koch, Jason Lee, Julia Stiles, Selma Blair and Thomas Lennon.  A crazy audio commentary worth listening to!Inside a Guy Thing - (18:38) A featurette about how the director was selected, updates of the script by the writers and what deviated from the original script, how talents were cast and more.Bachelor Party Confidential - (9:14) A featurette about what is a bachelor party.Groovy Gravy Making the Scene in a Guy Thing - (5:25) The making of the gravy/party scene and how storyboards came into play.Deleted Scenes - (17:02) Featuring eight deleted scenes with an introduction to each deleted scene by Director Chris Koch.Alternate Endings - (8:14) A total of three alternate endings with an introduction by Director Chris Koch.Gag Reel - (11:49) ""A Guy Thing"" gag reel.Theatrical Trailer - (2:21) The original theatrical trailer for ""A Guy Thing"".JUDGMENT CALL:Having watched actor Jason Lee in the Kevin Smith films as well as other projects he has worked on, you pretty much have this idea in your head of what kind of films he likes to take part in and what kind of comedy.For the most part, you know that the role is going to be crazy and because he is the leading man for this romantic comedy, prior to watching this film, I couldn't picture it but I had to see it for myself.  Especially to see how his leading ladies and their characters would be around him.And sure enough, ""A Guy Thing"" has plenty of hilarious moments that made me laugh throughout the film.  I was expecting more of a kitschy storyline with the overused cliche of man is getting married, meets woman that he connects with and chooses her over his fiance.  It's been overdone before and fortunately for ""A Guy Thing"", the way things play out, especially at the end is quite different.Jason Lee definitely gives a pretty solid performance of playing Paul Coleman.  From fart and diarrhea jokes, scratching his balls when he has crabs to a lot of other crazy situations in the film, he can definitely play the character with efficacy.Selma Blair on the other hand was quite interesting as the straight-laced fiance.  Very different, more reserved and proper than Paul (makes you wonder how these two ever clicked).  But you add in the very different Beck Jackon played by Julia Stiles and Becky brings the more adventurous side out of Paul.At the time this film came out, I was quite pleased by the acting by each of these talent because for Jason Lee, although he had appeared in ""Almost Famous"" and ""Vanilla Sky"", his role in ""A Guy Thing"" actually fits his style of performance.  Quirky comedy and he does it well.For Selma Blair, this was a pretty good role to showcase her as actress since 1999's ""Cruel Intentions"" and suffice to say, since ""A Guy Thing"", she went on to have bigger roles in films such as the ""Hellboy"" films and television roles.  In reality, she is quite quirky and has a pretty good humorous (and fashionable) side to her, so to see her as the straight-laced girlfriend was quite interesting.  And also, she is able to play the role quite well.A scene where she discovers Becky's underwear and goes to question Paul of why he has girl's underwear in his apartment was hilarious!  But most of all, how the writers were able to come up with a resolution for it, was very clever and well-thought up.  And definitely gave credence to the film's titled ""A Guy Thing"".And Julia Stiles, similar to Blair, her hit film that she appeared in was the 1999 teen comedy ""10 Things I Hate About You"", followed up by ""Save the Last Dance"".  And after ""A Guy Thing"", she has since managed to star in several hit films such as the ""Bourne"" trilogy and also TV projects such as ""Dexter"".Her role as Becky was quite vibrant because you sense a dangerous and naive side to her.  Almost in a Bohemian kind of way, she walks her own path, even if that means having a different job every week.  But her character is essential in changing Paul and seeing life in different way.Both female talents look absolutely wonderful in the film and all three talents give a pretty solid comedic performance and needless to say, everything comes together.As for the Blu-ray release, it's a catalog title release but the good news is that it comes with a good number of special features.  The audio commentary was a blast to listen to and the special features actually does a great job in explaining how storyboards and screenplay rewrites were imperative for the film and for certain scenes.  Also, to see how much different things would have been if the director chose any of the alternate endings.And as for picture quality, it's good but it's definitely not pristine.  And as for the lossless audio, as mentioned, I was pretty happy to see that the surround channel was used for the film as most romantic comedies tend to focus on the front and center channels and are usually dialogue and music driven.Overall, if you are looking for a romantic comedy in a ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle"", Nora Efron type of film, ""A Guy Thing"" may not be for you.  But if you want a popcorn romantic comedy where you can just laugh and be amused by the jokes and craziness that takes place in the film, then I can easily recommend ""A Guy Thing"".It's obvious that this is a romantic comedy that was tailored for the guys.  From the fart and diarrhea jokes, to a guy furiously trying to scratch his balls at a meeting in the conference room during business, especially of how it was done on film is hilarious!  Especially when Katie discovers the used underwear and Paul tries to tell her that he bought it for her.  Just to see the reaction on Selma Blair's face is priceless!  It's just a fun film that I was probably expecting the worse but by the end of the film, I enjoyed it!  And watching it again years later, I still laugh at the same jokes and found it to be enjoyable today.  It's a funny and entertaining film!A great date movie and hilarious romantic comedy that even the guys will definitely appreciate.  ""A Guy Thing"" is worth watching!",4,"Blu-ray: To this day, ""A Guy Thing"" continues to make me laugh.

747664,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00008VFCA,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[1, 1]","""A Guy Thing"" is more of a formula than a story. It increases more on the rules of romantic comedy, and it decreases on originality. It stars Jason Lee, Julia Stiles, and Selma Blair. None of the actors I had a problem with, but the storyline could have had alot of work done to it. The movie could have been much better if it ignored the standard features of a romantic comedy. If this movie dared to be original, it would have been so much better. The movie did have some funny moments, and good characters, but I have seen this kind of movie before, and I want to see it done better. The movie could be described by the movie's tagline. ""Boy Meets Girl, Boy Meets Girl's Cousin."" It's pretty obvious what the movie is about, and how the movie is going to end.The movie is about Paul. Paul is an ad salesmen who is getting ready to be married in one week to Karen. He works for her father, Ken, and he is ready for his bachlor party which is being thrown by his brother Pete, and his friend Jim. The entertainment for the party are hula girls, and among them is Becky. Paul gives his groom hat to Jim, and the next mourning he finds himself in bed with Becky, because she doesn't know that he is the groom to be. Paul doesn't remember what happened between the two, rushes Becky out, and then finds Karen coming in seconds later. This begins a seris of lies that start by Jim telling him never to tell Karen what happened between him and Becky. The problem really starts at a dinner party with Paul's parents, Karen's parents, her Aunt Budge, and Karen's cousin who happens to be Becky. Paul has to have Becky assure him that she will never tell anybody anything about what may or may not have happened between them, but the situations gets complicated when Becky's crazy cop ex-boyfriend and gets jealous of him. As Paul's wedding day comes closer and closer, he tries to cover up everything that he lied about, so that this whole thing could end.""A Guy Thing"" is a pretty good movie, but has the ability to make it be better. It follows the three rules for a romantic comedy.1)The main characters best friend needs to be the dumbest person in the cast.2)There always has to be one character that knows everything that is going on.3)The main character's othr half is always clueless until the end.Those three things are in every romantic comedy including ""A Guy Thing."" It is alright for movies to be different. I enjoyed the movie and it was a great way to spead an hour and a half. It was funny, smart, it was well acted, and it had some original material, but other than that it was  the same old thing.

747667,A3K1LK6DJCVPUK,B00008VFCA,K. Palmer,"[2, 3]","I rented ""A Guy Thing"" because it was the first movie where the talented Jason Lee was the lead character. I've been a fan of Lee's through his work in Kevin Smith's films (""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy"" being the standout roles) as well as his convincing turn as the lead singer of the rock band that was the focus of the movie ""Almost Famous"".But ""A Guy Thing"" is a miserable vehicle for Lee to showcase his acting chops. Five minutes into watching the movie, I made two predictions to my wife as to how the movie would end and added one more about 10 minutes later. All came true. It is a totally predictable movie and when you think Lee's character is in trouble, a ridiculous plot twist saves the day for him (it happens more than once). Lee is also miscast as a clean-cut straight-edges guy in this movie; he's more convincing as a guy with a rough edge about him, like he was in the movies mentioned previously.Not helping the situation is that Lee is cast with two of the most overrated actesses of the day, Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. Selma Blair basically recreates her role as the stuffy girl in ""Legally Blonde"" here and there is no chemistry between her character and Lee's. Julia Stiles' character is not one who you would root for as she is fairly brooding throughout and annoying when she isn't brooding. You don't root for either one here.The supporting cast includes depressing appearances by two memorable 1980's actresses, Diana Scarwid (the daughter in ""Mommie Dearest"") and Julie Haggerty (of the ""Airplane"" movies). I liked both of these women in their primes and although they both have aged gracefully, it seemed pretty obvious that they are now in a position in their careers where they will take any job they can get.Th[...]!",1,A Public Service Announcement - Don't Waste Your Time!,1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,1752,"['rented', 'A', 'Guy', 'Thing', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'talented', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'was', 'lead', 'character', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Lee', 'work', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', 'Mallrats', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'being', 'standout', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'convincing', 'turn', 'lead', 'singer', 'rock', 'band', 'was', 'focus', 'movie', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'A', 'Guy', 'Thing', 'miserable', 'vehicle', 'Lee', 'showcase', 'acting', 'chops', 'Five', 'minutes', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'two', 'predictions', 'wife', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'added', 'one', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'later', 'came', 'true', 'totally', 'predictable', 'movie', 'when', 'think', 'Lee', 'character', 'trouble', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'twist', 'day', 'more', 'once', 'Lee', 'also', 'miscast', 'clean-cut', 'straight-edges', 'guy', 'movie', 'more', 'convincing', 'guy', 'rough', 'edge', 'was', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'previously.Not', 'helping', 'situation', 'Lee', 'cast', 'two', 'most', 'overrated', 'actesses', 'day', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'basically', 'role', 'stuffy', 'girl', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'here', 'chemistry', 'character', 'Lee', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'character', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'root', 'fairly', 'brooding', 'annoying', 'when', ""n't"", 'brooding', 'do', ""n't"", 'root', 'one', 'here.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'depressing', 'appearances', 'two', 'memorable', '1980', 'actresses', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'daughter', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'Julie', 'Haggerty', 'Airplane', 'movies', 'liked', 'women', 'primes', 'have', 'aged', 'gracefully', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'are', 'now', 'position', 'careers', 'where', 'will', 'take', 'job', 'can', 'get.Th', '[', ']']",N/A
747668,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00008VFCA,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 4]","Life is ludicrous from time to time.  &quot;A Guy Thing&quot; is equally silly &amp; absurd.  It's mind numbing but funny.  A moment I particularly like is when Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) is beaten up by Ray and thrown into a dumpster.  His fiancee Karen (Selma Blair) happens along.  Of course, being a guy trying to salvage some pride, he fabricates a story that he was brave despite being mugged.  So when the police show up, his description of the perpetrator gets more &amp; more bizarre.  &quot;What was his race?&quot; the officer asks.  Lee looks puzzled.  &quot;Was he black or white?&quot;  &quot;A little of both.&quot;  &quot;And he had red hair, in dreadlocks, with a gold tooth, and a tattoo of barbed wire around his neck.&quot;  Paul of course thinks that no one will match that description only to wind up at a line-up where Hansberry played by Victor Varnado stands there, part black, part white, red hair, dreadlocks, with a gold tooth &amp; a tattoo of barbed wire around his neck.  &quot;Oh, it's not him!&quot; Lee yells.  It's stupid; but it's hilarious.Director Chris Koch previously directed &quot;Snow Day&quot; with Jean Smart &amp; Chevy Chase.  He does a good job of keeping the pace moving from one intensely ridiculous occurrence to the next.  Julia Stiles shines.  She is so funny, sweet and sincere.  The fact that Jason Lee is 10 years older than she doesn't dull the romance.  Mr. Barbra Streisand, otherwise known as James Brolin, does a great job as Karen's macho dad.  Selma Blair who was great in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; and &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; does a good job as his fiancee.I also like the wonderful moments given to the supporting players.  Diana Scarwid who was nominated for an Oscar in 1980 for playing with John Savage in &quot;Inside Moves&quot; and was Faye Dunaway's abused daughter in the Joan Crawford biopic &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; looks elegant as the mother of the bride.  Julie Haggerty who was so funny in the &quot;Airplane&quot; movies is the other mom.  Her film hubby here is the grossly unmannered Buck played by David Koechner who can currently be seen in &quot;My Boss' Daughter.&quot;  Thomas Lennon from &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; is wonderful as the starry-eyed brother who eventually walks away with Karen.  Canadian actress Jackie Burroughs who was in &quot;Willard&quot; is hilarious as Irish Aunt Budgie who will stop at nothing to sneak a glass of wine.  Lochlyn Munro from &quot;Dead On Campus,&quot; &quot;Duets,&quot; and &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; plays the boneheaded ex-boyfriend of Julia Stiles.  Even a couple of walk-ons are extremely memorable.  Keith Dallas is the Spend Mart clerk who covers on the phone for a complete stranger about a pair of used underwear supposedly purchased from their underwear bins by saying, &quot;It's those college kids who keep playing pranks by coming here and sticking dirty underwear in our underwear bins.&quot;  He hangs up &amp; explains, &quot;It's a guy thing.&quot;  Zahf Paroo is delightful as the perky Ahmed who is joyfully exuberant while Lee &amp; Lennon get fitted for their tuxes.The DVD offers some good bonus scenes, one in particular where Karen wants to have sex with Jason the night before their wedding.  Jason unfortunately can't because he's wearing a police wire trying to catch the dirty cop Ray.  It didn't fit in the movie, but is more hilarity.  The comments on bachelor parties are funny with Lennon relating a 4-day bachelor party in Amsterdam he attended.  Cast members then comment on his wild story.Yes, &quot;A Guy Thing&quot; is utterly silly &amp; ultimately forgettable.  I've rented it twice, not recalling I'd already seen it.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 6]","Sometimes I get stuck into watching this type of movie because my daughter rents these things and forces me to watch them.  She loved this movie and thought it was funny, stupid, but funny.  I had to give you the teen daughter perspective before I gave you mine.I admit this movie is silly, unnecessary, and throwaway.  I still laughed in a lot of places.  I also groaned in a few places too.  Example:  When Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) found Becky's (Julia Stiles) panties when his fiance was on the way over, he searched all over the apartment for a place to hide them, ultimately hiding them in the toilet.  You knew what was going to happen, and what did happen.  Also, there was a running joke about pictures of Becky and Paul, which we never got to see, being found by a minister's son, who also happened to live in the same apartment building.  The son kept finding the pictures and the minister kept bringing them back.  *sigh*.The tale is a bit hackneyed as well.  Girl and guy are prepared to be married, seemingly the perfect couple.  Guy meets another girl, girl meets another guy, everyone wonders what's wrong with this picture; guess how it all turns out?  SURPRISE!!!  NOT!!!In spite of a re-tread plot, and in spite of the groans, there were places that this movie was creative and humorous; not many, but enough that I felt that watching the movie wasn't a complete waste of time.  I felt a bit guilty watching this movie because I knew the premise had been done (and done, and done), and many of the jokes were weak, and yet, I like the movie.  I think that one thing that really saved this movie was Julia Stiles.  She really is not centrally involved in all the happenings, occasionally appearing aloof, and she manages to escape this movie leaving everyone watching with a positive impression.  Julia saves this movie from being a waste of time.  I look for Julia to get better parts and bigger roles in the future.I won't go so far out on the limb as to give this movie any more than 3 stars (and perhaps a low three at that).  Watch the movie for the interaction of everyone with Julia Stiles, and accept the groans as payment for watching those interactions.",3,"Extremely Light, Predictable Comedy; Julia Stiles Shines",1054339200,"05 31, 2003",2003,2180,"['Sometimes', 'get', 'stuck', 'watching', 'type', 'movie', 'daughter', 'things', 'forces', 'watch', 'loved', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'stupid', 'funny', 'had', 'give', 'teen', 'daughter', 'perspective', 'gave', 'mine.I', 'admit', 'movie', 'silly', 'unnecessary', 'throwaway', 'still', 'laughed', 'lot', 'places', 'also', 'groaned', 'few', 'places', 'too', 'Example', 'When', 'Paul', 'Coleman', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'found', 'Becky', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'panties', 'when', 'fiance', 'was', 'way', 'searched', 'apartment', 'place', 'hide', 'ultimately', 'hiding', 'toilet', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'did', 'happen', 'Also', 'was', 'running', 'joke', 'pictures', 'Becky', 'Paul', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'being', 'found', 'minister', 'son', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'live', 'same', 'apartment', 'building', 'son', 'kept', 'finding', 'pictures', 'minister', 'kept', 'bringing', 'back', '*sigh*.The', 'tale', 'bit', 'hackneyed', 'well', 'Girl', 'guy', 'are', 'prepared', 'be', 'married', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'couple', 'Guy', 'girl', 'girl', 'meets', 'guy', 'everyone', 'what', 'wrong', 'picture', 'how', 'out', 'SURPRISE', 'NOT', 'spite', 're-tread', 'plot', 'spite', 'groans', 'were', 'places', 'movie', 'was', 'creative', 'humorous', 'not', 'many', 'felt', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'felt', 'bit', 'guilty', 'watching', 'movie', 'knew', 'premise', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'done', 'done', 'many', 'jokes', 'were', 'weak', 'yet', 'like', 'movie', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'saved', 'movie', 'was', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'really', 'not', 'centrally', 'involved', 'happenings', 'occasionally', 'appearing', 'aloof', 'escape', 'movie', 'leaving', 'everyone', 'watching', 'positive', 'impression', 'Julia', 'movie', 'being', 'waste', 'time', 'look', 'Julia', 'get', 'better', 'parts', 'bigger', 'roles', 'future.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'out', 'limb', 'give', 'movie', 'more', '3', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'low', 'three', 'Watch', 'movie', 'interaction', 'everyone', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'groans', 'payment', 'watching', 'interactions']",N/A

But all the laughs fall rather flat I'm afraid. You're predicting what's going to happen to poor old Paul before it even happens!Jason Lee and Julia Stiles both played their parts well, although it seemed like they were struggling to hold the film up by themselves. Selma Blair was just wrong for her part. Courtney Cox Arquette could have done it much better, as basically, all Selma was doing was playing Monica from Friends. Controlling, annoyingly tidy, very organised, all those kind of things. You know what I mean if you're a fan of Friends. Most of her scenes seemed awkward and dumb, and don't show off any of Selma that we know and love. She's grown up, and is unrecognisable as the gawky girl she was in Cruel Intentions, but she still carries some of that gawkiness around with her in her acting.The extras and the fact that Paul starts to &quot;forsee&quot; what COULD happen if he tells the truth are the good things about this movie. The forseeing happens intermittantly, not so much that it starts to bug you, but appears without warning, and you think it's happening - but it's not. The extras are hilarious. Especially the interviews with the cast.

Hind ""daria_m""","[0, 1]","If you're a Jason Lee fan (like me), you can appreciate it when he flashes a big smile, gives you a thumbs-up, or suddenly raises his voice when he's angry.  His expressions are funny.  You'll see a lot of mugging and a few good jokes in this: your average romantic comedy.Jason Lee plays Paul, a man who is about to get married and continue a career at his father-in-law's corporation.  After his bachelor party, he winds up in bed with a Tiki dancer from the bar.  He believes he slept with her and tries to hide it from his uptight fiancee Karen (Selma Blair).  He finds out later that the Tiki girl is actually Karen's cousin Becky (Julia Stiles).  While Paul tries to keep their night together a secret, even though no sex took place, he finds himself in a series of slapstick situations.  Some enlist gross-out humor and innuendo (and we've seen this done better before).  The main problem with these gags is that you can always see them coming.  You're not given hints, you're flat-out TOLD what is going to happen.  It takes the surprise out of what could have been some funny moments.  The only really funny, unexpected giggle happens during a scene featuring Paul and his ballroom dance instructor.I really didn't like the overall message of the movie.  Do guys really have this understanding that it's okay to cheat because they are ""hunters?""  Would a father-in-law really say ""It happens"" if he found out that the man engaged to his daughter had cheated on her?Bad messages and predictability aside, this movie is kind of a typical, no-brain-needed escape flick.  It's not to be taken too seriously, and it was probably better suited for rental rather than a trip to the cinema.  I've seen better performances out of Jason Lee (Chasing Amy), Julia Stiles (Ten Things I Hate About You), and Selma Blair (Legally Blonde).  You can always rent the movie and judge for yourself.  There are no twists at the end or anything, so if you find that you really don't like it about halfway through, just turn it off and take it back.",2,"Sometimes funny, but very predictable",1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,2035,"[""'re"", 'Jason', 'Lee', 'fan', 'can', 'appreciate', 'when', 'big', 'smile', 'thumbs-up', 'suddenly', 'voice', 'when', 'angry', 'expressions', 'are', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lot', 'mugging', 'few', 'good', 'jokes', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedy.Jason', 'Lee', 'Paul', 'man', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'continue', 'career', 'father-in-law', 'corporation', 'bachelor', 'party', 'up', 'bed', 'Tiki', 'dancer', 'bar', 'slept', 'tries', 'hide', 'uptight', 'fiancee', 'Karen', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'out', 'later', 'Tiki', 'girl', 'actually', 'Karen', 'cousin', 'Becky', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Paul', 'keep', 'night', 'together', 'secret', 'even', 'sex', 'took', 'place', 'series', 'slapstick', 'situations', 'enlist', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'innuendo', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'main', 'problem', 'gags', 'can', 'always', 'see', 'coming', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'hints', ""'re"", 'flat-out', 'TOLD', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'surprise', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'moments', 'only', 'really', 'funny', 'unexpected', 'giggle', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Paul', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'instructor.I', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'overall', 'message', 'movie', 'Do', 'guys', 'really', 'have', 'understanding', 'okay', 'cheat', 'are', 'hunters', 'father-in-law', 'really', 'say', 'found', 'out', 'man', 'engaged', 'daughter', 'had', 'cheated', 'Bad', 'messages', 'predictability', 'aside', 'movie', 'kind', 'typical', 'no-brain-needed', 'escape', 'flick', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'was', 'probably', 'better', 'suited', 'rental', 'rather', 'trip', 'cinema', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'performances', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Ten', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'can', 'always', 'rent', 'movie', 'judge', 'are', 'twists', 'end', 'anything', 'so', 'find', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'halfway', 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'take', 'back']",N/A

He wakes up the next morning with the stripper he met at the bar in his bed.  Imagine Paul's shock when he learns the stripper is his fiance's cousin.  Things get quite awkward for Paul and he tries to cover his tracks only to find himself getting deeper and deeper into trouble.THE COOL THINGS:Watching the awkward situations Paul gets himself into reminded me oddly enough of Ben Stiller's ""Meet the Parents.""  Both movies have similar comedy and similar situations.  There's a good reason for this as both movies have the same writer and as it turns out, this was written as the sequel to ""Meet the Parents.""  Like in ""Meet the Parents"" Paul goes from outrageous situation to outrageous situation because he has problems telling the truth.  Overall he's a nice guy who has same bad things happen to him.BEST SCENES:1. Crab medicine2. Running from Becky and Karen at the dinner party3. The Rehearsal Dinner ""Hash""4. Wedding Band screw-upTHE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:Quite easily this is one of the best collections of DVD extras you'll come across.  Here's what you get:1. Audio commentary track with the director and main actors/actresses.  Fun listen.2. ""Inside A Guy Thing"" - 18 minute featurette where the cast and crew talk about the movie.3. ""Bachelor Party Confidential"" - 8 minute featurette where the guys talk about the social meaning of the bachelor party.  Deep stuff.4. ""Groovy Gravy"" - 5 minute featurette where the cast and crew talk about the hilarious improvisation done during the rehearsal dinner scene.5. 7 deleted scenes with director introductory commentary.  Some good stuff was left out.6. 3 alternate endings with director introductory commentary.7. ""Fun Fact"" audio commentary track.  Interesting stuff.8. ""Gag Reel with commentary"" - 12 minute blooper highlights from the film.9. ""Are We Made for Each Other"" Interactive Quiz.  Fun, but potentially dangerous, game to play with your loved one.10. Photo Galleries11. Theatrical trailer12. Trailers for other filmsTHE VERDICT:Overall, the movie's just fun for a watch and this stacked DVD makes it a great purchase if your inclined to do so.  Like ""Meet the Parents"" the comedy is just hilarious.  The love story behind the film is somewhat predictable but the joy is in getting to the end.  The stacked DVD extras are a blast to get through.  Overall, if you're into romantic comedies that feature more comedy than romance you'll love this film.  This is perfect for an evening/weekend rental or if you're inclined, a fine addition to your DVD collection.GRADES:The Movie:  4 starsThe Extras:  5 starsTotal:  4.5 starsHighly Recommended",5,Comedy of Errors,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,2820,"['Guy', 'Thing', 'successfully', 'few', 'changes', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula.THE', 'STORY', 'Paul', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'custom', 'night', 'out', 'boys', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'stripper', 'met', 'bar', 'bed', 'Imagine', 'Paul', 'shock', 'when', 'stripper', 'fiance', 'cousin', 'Things', 'get', 'quite', 'awkward', 'Paul', 'cover', 'tracks', 'only', 'find', 'getting', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'trouble.THE', 'COOL', 'THINGS', 'Watching', 'awkward', 'situations', 'Paul', 'reminded', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'movies', 'have', 'similar', 'comedy', 'similar', 'situations', 'good', 'reason', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'writer', 'out', 'was', 'written', 'sequel', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Paul', 'outrageous', 'situation', 'outrageous', 'situation', 'problems', 'telling', 'truth', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'same', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'him.BEST', 'SCENES:1', 'Crab', 'medicine2', 'Running', 'Becky', 'Karen', 'dinner', 'party3', 'Rehearsal', 'Dinner', 'Hash', '4', 'Wedding', 'Band', 'screw-upTHE', 'DVD', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Quite', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'collections', 'DVD', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'come', 'Here', 'what', 'get:1', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'main', 'actors/actresses', 'Fun', 'listen.2', 'Guy', 'Thing', '18', 'minute', 'featurette', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'talk', 'movie.3', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'Confidential', '8', 'minute', 'featurette', 'where', 'guys', 'talk', 'social', 'meaning', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Deep', 'stuff.4', 'Groovy', 'Gravy', '5', 'minute', 'featurette', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'talk', 'hilarious', 'improvisation', 'done', 'rehearsal', 'dinner', 'scene.5', '7', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'introductory', 'commentary', 'good', 'stuff', 'was', 'left', 'out.6', '3', 'alternate', 'endings', 'director', 'introductory', 'commentary.7', 'Fun', 'Fact', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Interesting', 'stuff.8', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'commentary', '12', 'minute', 'blooper', 'highlights', 'film.9', 'Made', 'Other', 'Interactive', 'Quiz', 'Fun', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'game', 'play', 'loved', 'one.10', 'Photo', 'Galleries11', 'Theatrical', 'trailer12', 'Trailers', 'other', 'filmsTHE', 'VERDICT', 'Overall', 'movie', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'stacked', 'DVD', 'great', 'purchase', 'inclined', 'do', 'so', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'comedy', 'just', 'hilarious', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'joy', 'getting', 'end', 'stacked', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'blast', 'get', 'Overall', ""'re"", 'romantic', 'comedies', 'feature', 'more', 'comedy', 'romance', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', 'perfect', 'evening/weekend', 'rental', ""'re"", 'inclined', 'fine', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection.GRADES', 'Movie', '4', 'starsThe', 'Extras', '5', 'starsTotal', '4.5', 'starsHighly', 'Recommended']",N/A

Beside him somehow Julia Stiles (in dancer's costume) is asleep, and he is going to marry Selma Blair in a week.  So, what would he do?This is so predictable that you might miss the old, trashy, sex comedy ""Bachelor Party"" back in 1984 (starring very young Tom Hanks).  Actually, ""A Guy Thing"" is not that noisy; it is a romantic comedy, but it forgets to show its romantic side.  The good thing is, Jason Lee is quite a likable fellow, amiable and charming, and so is Julia Stiles.  At least she is better than that dismally self-indulgent ""Hamlet"" remake, and clearly the filmmakers know that she is the most precious thing in this film.  OK.But ""A Guy Thing"" often looks like a casuality of the trend these days -- I mean, 'gags' first, then actors' chemisty last -- the film staggers from one set-piece to another, with extremely low score.  These pieces are not funny (to me, of course), but more irritating thing about the film is it does not convince us that Lee and Stiles (or Blair for that matter) could be in love with each other.  They do not talk like real man and woman.Most annoying is the desperate attempt to use ""ex-love-turns-up-unexpectedly"" device.  And if that ex-love turns out a mean-spirited cop, what can I say?  It only spoils the feel-good nature of the film (and I simply refuse to believe that sweet Julia Stiles was, even for a moment, in love with such a bully).  And to make matters worse, the film throws in another familiar device of 'radio' to frame a guy ... hey, but, is this supposed to be a romantic comedy?It is a kind of miracle that Julia Stiles remains lovely and sweet all through the film.  No one would blame her not doing her job ... whatever it may be.  If you're a fan of her, see it.

From here it only gets more and more predictable, the dancer is part of the fianc&eacute;'s family, the parents of the couple are opposites (one rich, the other poor), crazy friends fall about complicating things and it all gets very confusing if it hadn't ever been done before.  The movie is filled with lewd jokes that are grosser than they are funny, like crotch-itching, dirty underwear and a spell with the runs. There are just too many other movies that work and are held together by the same concepts with better stars and better writing.Julia Stiles plays the dancer and I was disappointed in her comedic ability, she is such a good serious actress I could never figure out why she chose this role. The doomed groom is played by Jason Lee who falls far short of the great leading man category. Selma Blair works as the worried fianc&eacute; but her role is really boring. A few others add a bit of whimsy to the cast but nothing significant.I would recommend spending your time and money on ""Meet the Parents"" or ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" if you are looking for really funny wedding films. Otherwise this will do if you have no imagination and expect less than the best from romantic comedies, it certainly isn't this girl's thing!",2,A Predictable Thing,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,1617,"['movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'few', 'hours', 'spare', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'over', 'catch', 'it.The', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'only', 'partially', 'best', 'bachelor', 'party', 'would-be-groom', 'waking', 'up', 'next', 'hula', 'dancer', 'same', 'time', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'coming', 'over', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'here', 'only', 'more', 'more', 'predictable', 'dancer', 'part', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'family', 'parents', 'couple', 'are', 'opposites', 'one', 'rich', 'other', 'poor', 'crazy', 'friends', 'fall', 'complicating', 'things', 'very', 'confusing', 'had', ""n't"", 'ever', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'movie', 'filled', 'lewd', 'jokes', 'are', 'grosser', 'are', 'funny', 'crotch-itching', 'dirty', 'underwear', 'spell', 'runs', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'work', 'are', 'held', 'together', 'same', 'concepts', 'better', 'stars', 'better', 'writing.Julia', 'Stiles', 'dancer', 'was', 'disappointed', 'comedic', 'ability', 'such', 'good', 'serious', 'actress', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'chose', 'role', 'doomed', 'groom', 'played', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'who', 'far', 'short', 'great', 'leading', 'man', 'category', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'worried', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'role', 'really', 'boring', 'few', 'others', 'add', 'bit', 'whimsy', 'cast', 'nothing', 'significant.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'spending', 'time', 'money', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'are', 'looking', 'really', 'funny', 'wedding', 'films', 'Otherwise', 'will', 'do', 'have', 'imagination', 'expect', 'less', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'girl', 'thing']",N/A
