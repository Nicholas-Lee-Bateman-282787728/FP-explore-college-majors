1310406,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B002ZG994U,amerdale876,"[7, 9]","To many, ""The A-Team"" is just another in a long line of movies-made-from-TV-shows. But to me - and to those that grew up with the original like I did - this is a movie that you would hope to kick butt just as much as the TV show did. There were plenty of movies based on hit TV shows that failed miserably:Miami Vice (Unrated Director's Edition) [Blu-ray],S.W.A.T. [Blu-ray],Bewitched (Special Edition),The Dukes of Hazzard (Unrated Widescreen Edition),Lost in Space [Blu-ray],The Mod Squad, andThe Avengers. Needless to say, I was nervous when I heard of 20th Century Fox's plans to remake the 1983 NBC hit show. Then, fortunately, I saw the movie trailer and all of my worries subsided as I saw the stellar cast of Liam Neeson (who is awesome in pretty much anything he does), Bradley Cooper, Sharlto Copley, Patrick Wilson, and Jessica Biel. I was worried about Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson  who didn't have any real acting experience before this film and is mostly known for his title as Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Light-Heavyweight Champion. However, upon Jackson's first 15 minutes on screen, my fears all disappeared. I was also a little worried about Copley's casting as ""Mad"" Murdock (that character being my favorite from the show), but he -- like Jackson -- took on the role and made it his own. He correctly captured all the genius, maddening humor that Dwight Schultz brought to the original.The first thing you should accept upon going into this film is that this is a fun, slam-bang action film. It's not to be taken too seriously but it's also not merely some silly popcorn flick that the studio put together merely for money and marketing. There's plenty of action and laughs but the story, acting and pacing are all up to par as well. I remember watching the television show when it originally aired and loved the setup of these rogue heroes helping a client in need every week (a popular formula that is most currently showcased in USA network's ""Burn Notice""). Unlike most action shows of its day - and action shows on TV today - ""The A-Team,"" with all of its bullets and explosions, had an extremely low death toll (only five people died during the entire run of the series and none of the deaths were caused by the A-Team themselves). The show's brilliant plot twists, action sequences, and customized weapons (take that, ""MacGyver""!) kept all of us diehard fans coming back for five seasons. And those same elements, which are plentiful in this update, charge our enthusiasm to see the film.As I previously stated, Liam Neeson rocks in pretty much anything - any genre, any movie! He does not disappoint in this. His cigar-chomping, ""love-it-when-a-plan-comes-together"" leader Hannibal Smith does complete justice to original portrayer George Peppard. And there's no better actor I could think of today to portray Face than Bradley Cooper. Most know him as a comedic actor with prominent roles in ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Hangover."" But most don't know that he first appeared as a serious co-starring role in the J.J. Abrams/Jennifer Garner hit ABC series ""Alias."" So the man is multi-faceted; even though he's hilarious and I enjoy and look forward to seeing him in more comedic roles, I also hope to see him in more serious roles in the near future.If you haven't seen, or are not familiar with, the original TV show, you should know that it follows closely to the original series albeit with a few modernized plot points for making the film as contemporary as possible. Yes, this film is directed more toward guys but, ladies, if your boyfriend/husband/male friend talks you into viewing this film, don't roll your eyes just yet. Like I said, the story is enjoyable and Jessica Biel's presence is more female action star rather than just a sex symbol for show. Patrick Wilson's Agent Lynch is fun and deadly, which Jason Patric tried to capture as Max inThe Losers [Blu-ray] -- a graphic novel-turned-movie that follows closely to The A-Team's premise -- but did not succeed. Director Joe Carnahan, who directed one of my favorite action flicks of all time,Smokin' Aces [Blu-ray], does an excellent job with both the direction and screenplay. The film runs at about two hours and yet I left the movie satisfied. I felt like I could've watched at least another hour. And the way the film ends (with a super cameo from Mad Men's Jon Hamm), I yearn for a sequel. Although, even if there isn't one, I won't be too disappointed as the film stands strongly by itself. Even though it's still early, I'll say that, so far, ""The A-Team"" is the best action film of the summer!",5,I love it when a plot comes together!!!!,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,4602,"['many', 'A-Team', 'just', 'long', 'line', 'movies-made-from-TV-shows', 'grew', 'up', 'original', 'did', 'movie', 'would', 'hope', 'kick', 'butt', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'TV', 'show', 'did', 'were', 'plenty', 'movies', 'based', 'hit', 'TV', 'shows', 'failed', 'miserably', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'S.W.A.T', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Bewitched', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Lost', 'Space', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'andThe', 'Avengers', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'nervous', 'when', 'heard', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'plans', 'remake', '1983', 'NBC', 'hit', 'show', 'Then', 'fortunately', 'saw', 'movie', 'trailer', 'worries', 'subsided', 'saw', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'awesome', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'was', 'worried', 'Quinton', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'acting', 'experience', 'film', 'mostly', 'known', 'title', 'Ultimate', 'Fighting', 'Championship', 'UFC', 'Light-Heavyweight', 'Champion', 'However', 'Jackson', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'screen', 'fears', 'disappeared', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'worried', 'Copley', 'casting', 'Mad', 'Murdock', 'character', 'being', 'favorite', 'show', 'Jackson', 'took', 'role', 'made', 'own', 'correctly', 'captured', 'genius', 'maddening', 'humor', 'Dwight', 'Schultz', 'brought', 'original.The', 'first', 'thing', 'should', 'accept', 'going', 'film', 'fun', 'slam-bang', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'also', 'not', 'merely', 'silly', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'studio', 'put', 'together', 'merely', 'money', 'marketing', 'plenty', 'action', 'laughs', 'story', 'acting', 'pacing', 'are', 'up', 'par', 'as', 'well', 'remember', 'watching', 'television', 'show', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'loved', 'setup', 'rogue', 'heroes', 'helping', 'client', 'need', 'week', 'popular', 'formula', 'most', 'currently', 'showcased', 'USA', 'network', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'most', 'action', 'shows', 'day', 'action', 'shows', 'TV', 'today', 'A-Team', 'bullets', 'explosions', 'had', 'extremely', 'low', 'death', 'toll', 'only', 'five', 'people', 'died', 'entire', 'run', 'series', 'none', 'deaths', 'were', 'caused', 'A-Team', 'show', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'twists', 'action', 'sequences', 'customized', 'weapons', 'take', 'MacGyver', 'kept', 'diehard', 'fans', 'coming', 'back', 'five', 'seasons', 'same', 'elements', 'are', 'plentiful', 'update', 'charge', 'enthusiasm', 'see', 'film.As', 'previously', 'stated', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'rocks', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'genre', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint', 'cigar-chomping', 'love-it-when-a-plan-comes-together', 'leader', 'Hannibal', 'Smith', 'complete', 'justice', 'original', 'portrayer', 'George', 'Peppard', 'better', 'actor', 'could', 'think', 'today', 'portray', 'Face', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Most', 'know', 'comedic', 'actor', 'prominent', 'roles', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Hangover', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'appeared', 'serious', 'co-starring', 'role', 'J.J.', 'Abrams/Jennifer', 'Garner', 'hit', 'ABC', 'series', 'Alias', 'man', 'multi-faceted', 'even', 'hilarious', 'enjoy', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'comedic', 'roles', 'also', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'near', 'future.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'original', 'TV', 'show', 'should', 'know', 'closely', 'original', 'series', 'few', 'modernized', 'plot', 'points', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'contemporary', 'possible', 'Yes', 'film', 'directed', 'more', 'guys', 'ladies', 'boyfriend/husband/male', 'friend', 'talks', 'viewing', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'roll', 'eyes', 'just', 'yet', 'said', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'presence', 'more', 'female', 'action', 'star', 'rather', 'just', 'sex', 'symbol', 'show', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Agent', 'Lynch', 'fun', 'deadly', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'tried', 'capture', 'Max', 'inThe', 'Losers', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'graphic', 'novel-turned-movie', 'closely', 'A-Team', 'premise', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'who', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', 'action', 'flicks', 'time', 'Smokin', 'Aces', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'excellent', 'job', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'yet', 'left', 'movie', 'satisfied', 'felt', 'could', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'least', 'hour', 'way', 'film', 'super', 'cameo', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'yearn', 'sequel', 'even', ""n't"", 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'film', 'strongly', 'Even', 'still', 'early', ""'ll"", 'say', 'so', 'far', 'A-Team', 'best', 'action', 'film', 'summer']",N/A

The A-Team is based on the 80's TV show of the same name. It is about a crack commando unit who were charged for a crime they didn't commit, and are now being chased by the government. While in hiding, they take on jobs by people who need their help. That's the main intro to the TV show. The movie is how The A-Team got together, and the reason why they go into hiding. Now, some differences have been made. Since this isn't the 80's, this is a much bigger spectacle of a show than the original. Instead of being Vietnam vets, they were in Iraq.Liam Neeson plays John ""Hannibal"" Smith, the cigar smoking leader of The A-Team. Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson plays B.A Baracus, the guy with a bad attitude. Bradley Cooper plays Templeton ""Face'man'"" Peck, the smooth talking ladies man. And Sharlto Copley plays H.M Murdock, the insane pilot. They all play their roles perfectly.This is a fun popcorn flick, and just a great film. There are some crazy impossible scenes, like firing the falling tank, (You'll understand when you see it) but if you just turn off your brain, and whether you're a fan of the original show or not this is a terrific film in my opinion.

I enjoyed that segment of the movie, and applaud the creators for setting up the rest of the movie with that story.Viewing tip: We watched this with the sub-titles on, and that turned out to work well.

Any plan, no matter how bizarre or improbable, would come together in the end.  Rather than try to make a ""serious"" A-Team movie, the producers went the Charlie's Angels way and owned the improbability.  As a result, this movie works, and it's fun.  I give the director and the writers a lot of credit - while the script doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense, and the plot gets confused at times, ""A-Team"" manages to juggle a lot of convoluted spy/heist stuff without getting the viewer lost as to what's going on.  The actors were good choices to play the classic characters, Liam Neeson in particular.  It was fun to see Gerald McRaney, the king of 80s TV, back on screen.Part of the comedy had to do with those printing plates dating from the 70s.  Oh no - unnamed bad guys were going to print a billion or two dollars of ""unbacked US currency"" with them!  Given that the Federal Reserve does that on a daily basis, the viewer may end up cheering for the monetary restraint of the eventual possessor of the plates and/or hoping he or she might replace Bernanke.  Plus, hasn't the $100 bill changed a little since 1975?The movie bogs down in places, and a movie like the ""A-Team"" can't afford that.  It needs to keep up the energy so you don't think about it too much.  At 2 hours, this movie could have easily shaved off about 20 minutes and been a lot more effective.This is at least worth a rent, especially if you liked the original show as a kid.

1310434,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG994U,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 17]","There is some semblance of a story in ""The A-Team."" I seem to recall the team members being framed for a crime they didn't commit, a plot to recapture counterfeit treasury plates, a lot of double crossing, Bradley Cooper trying to rekindle a relationship with Jessica Biel, and scene after scene of escaping and jumping and falling and exploding and running and flying, most of them aided by heavy computer graphics and a very unsteady camera. That's about it. Is this enough to sustain a nearly two hour film? I left the theater feeling as if I had seen a series of images flashing before my eyes, but not as if I had actually been told anything. Strange how you can be shown so much yet find that absolutely nothing is happening. Perhaps I should take comfort in that even nothing can look good on the big screen.Am I at a disadvantage for not having seen a single episode of the show on which the film is based? This may be a case of me simply not getting it. In my defense, the show premiered five months before I was born and ended six months after my third birthday. Yes, yes, there are always reruns and DVD releases, but too much time has passed, and quite frankly, I no longer have any interest. If I'm to judge ""The A-Team,"" I only have the film adaptation to go on. So if any of you feel I'm ill-prepared to review it, feel free to stop reading and find a review written by a long time fan who understands the material. I for one feel that a movie should in some way appeal to all audiences and not merely fans of its source material. By alienating a sizeable audience, the only thing a filmmaker has achieved is creating an in-joke.""The A-Team"" is an aggressive, meandering, nonsensical flight of fancy so pumped up on testosterone that it practically oozes off the screen. We have a lot of cool things to look at - fireballs, shattering panes of glass, guys getting punched, cars getting smashed, tanks falling from the sky - but we're given very little think about other than the blur of imagery we've just witnessed. Maybe if the film had paused long enough to tell a real story, all this could be forgiven. Alas, director/co-writer Joe Carnahan just keeps on shoving cinematic chaos in our faces, reserving the slower, quieter moments for puzzling character analyses and astonishingly shallow dialogue. What are we to make of B.A. Baracus' claim that he no longer has it in him to kill anyone? Given how silly everything leading up to that moment is, are we really supposed to take that seriously?I do have to hand it to the actors, though - they all seem to be having a lot of fun. And given the screenplay's shortcomings, they give reasonably decent performances. Liam Neeson is likeably gruff as the cigar-smoking Col. Hannibal Smith, Bradley Cooper is delightfully arrogant as the womanizing Faceman Peck, Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson is amusing as the imposing (and aerophobic) B.A. Baracus, and Sharlto Copley is memorable as the certifiably insane Howling Mad Murdock. I wasn't too impressed with Jessica Biel, however, as Capt. Charisa Sosa, who apparently is Peck's ex-girlfriend; it's not that the performance was bad, but the character certainly was unnecessary. It didn't help that her role in the ever-twisting scheme to reclaim the stolen money plates becomes more and more difficult to define.And then there's Patrick Wilson as Col. Lynch, a man so sniveling and cocky he should hated just on general principles. He too wants to get his hands on the money plates. So does the equally loathsome Pike (Brian Bloom), who I think had something to do with the A-Team being wrongly accused and may be trying to sell the plates through an Arab backer. In order to get back at these two, the A-Team must concoct a number of elaborate escape attempts. The most interesting involved Murdock, committed to an insane asylum in Germany; he has the patients put on 3-D glasses and watch a projected film (which one I dare not reveal), and wouldn't you know it, an actual tank bursts through the wall just as a tank in the film comes directly at the camera. At this point, I found myself wondering why the filmmakers didn't bother releasing this film in 3-D, since that seems to be the trend nowadays.There are probably legions of fans out there that will watch this film and scrutinize every detail, specifically in how faithful it is to the TV series. If you happen to be a part of it, and if you think I'm a killjoy who doesn't know what he's talking about, please note that I admitted this right at the start. If you're a fan, chances are you will enjoy ""The A-Team."" If you're like me and you grew up on other TV shows, you may find yourself at a loss to account for what's going on and why. This is a loud, goofy, visually assaultive action extravaganza, one that makes no real attempt at a plot other than going from one inane stunt to the next. ""I love it when a plan comes together,"" says Hannibal near the beginning of the film. I love it when a plan comes together, too.

1310442,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002ZG994U,DanD,"[6, 16]","THE A-TEAM is one of those movies that is meant to be popcorn entertainment: nothing fancy, nothing of high quality, just a good way to kill a couple hours.  It features a few hard-hitters (Liam Neeson, Patrick Wilson, Scott Cooper, Sharlto Copley), all of whom are slumming it (and apparently having fun).  It features a lucrative, by-the-numbers plot; a very pro-violence message (a pacifist snaps a man's neck, and we're supposed to cheer); a lot of explosions and bullets and one-liners.  It's an action movie.Then why the two stars?  Because this film features one of the single worst directing jobs I've ever seen.  This is surprising, as the film comes from Joe Carnahan, who gave us the action gem SMOKIN' ACES.  But Carnahan doesn't seem to know what he's doing here.  There are random cut-scenes and close-ups; the film almost feels like a music video in spots, the directing is so awkward and uneven.  The script is terrible, even by action movie standards; the first twenty minutes of the movie are back story (how the team got together); and the next twenty are spent setting up the overall plot of the film.  That's 40 minutes where nothing much happens.  Even by so-bad-it's-good standards, THE A-TEAM lacks almost anything worthwhile.Then why two stars at all?  Because of the performances.  Some are terrible--""Rampage"" Jackson should quit--but some are surprisingly good.  Patrick Wilson makes perhaps the best smarmy CIA operative I've seen; his performance belongs in a much better movie.  Liam Neeson is the epitome of cool here; his opening scene is fantastic, the drool-on-your-chin kind of awesomeness we rarely get anymore.  Bradley Cooper and Sharlto Copley are hilarious and charming (well, Cooper; Copley is a bit dangerous, in a good way).  These actors all have good chemistry together (again, Jackson is the exception), and deserve a better script and better directing.  THE A-TEAM almost isn't worth your while.  Yet, you're probably going to see it, because if you're honestly curious about it, then you're already preparing yourself.  Just don't set the bar too high.  If nothing else, revel in Wilson's performance, and remember Neeson's opening seen.  Come to think of it, those two things are worth at least the price of a rental.  Which is a shame, because the rest of the film borders on a waste of time.",2,A few good performances in an otherwise forgettable film.,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,2343,"['A-TEAM', 'one', 'movies', 'meant', 'be', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'nothing', 'high', 'quality', 'just', 'good', 'way', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours', 'few', 'hard-hitters', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'whom', 'are', 'slumming', 'apparently', 'having', 'fun', 'lucrative', 'by-the-numbers', 'plot', 'very', 'pro-violence', 'message', 'pacifist', 'man', 'neck', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'cheer', 'lot', 'explosions', 'bullets', 'one-liners', 'action', 'movie.Then', 'why', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'one', 'single', 'worst', 'directing', 'jobs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'surprising', 'film', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'who', 'gave', 'action', 'gem', 'SMOKIN', 'ACES', 'Carnahan', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'here', 'are', 'random', 'cut-scenes', 'close-ups', 'film', 'almost', 'feels', 'music', 'video', 'spots', 'directing', 'so', 'awkward', 'uneven', 'script', 'terrible', 'even', 'action', 'movie', 'standards', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'back', 'story', 'how', 'team', 'got', 'together', 'next', 'twenty', 'are', 'spent', 'setting', 'up', 'overall', 'plot', 'film', '40', 'minutes', 'where', 'nothing', 'much', 'Even', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'standards', 'A-TEAM', 'almost', 'anything', 'worthwhile.Then', 'why', 'two', 'stars', 'performances', 'are', 'terrible', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'should', 'quit', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'perhaps', 'best', 'smarmy', 'CIA', 'operative', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'performance', 'belongs', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'epitome', 'cool', 'here', 'opening', 'scene', 'fantastic', 'drool-on-your-chin', 'kind', 'awesomeness', 'rarely', 'get', 'anymore', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'are', 'hilarious', 'charming', 'well', 'Cooper', 'Copley', 'bit', 'dangerous', 'good', 'way', 'actors', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'again', 'Jackson', 'exception', 'deserve', 'better', 'script', 'better', 'directing', 'A-TEAM', 'almost', ""n't"", 'worth', 'while', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'see', ""'re"", 'honestly', 'curious', 'then', ""'re"", 'already', 'preparing', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'bar', 'too', 'high', 'nothing', 'else', 'revel', 'Wilson', 'performance', 'remember', 'Neeson', 'opening', 'seen', 'Come', 'think', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'worth', 'least', 'price', 'rental', 'Which', 'shame', 'rest', 'film', 'borders', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

They break out of military prison to prove their innocence. Meanwhile Face's old flame Sosa (who lost rank as a result of the incident) is charged with finding them and the still missing plates. A CIA spook named Lynch is also involved, simultaneously helping and hindering both sides for his own purposes.The plotline wasn't bad in concept, but I would have liked to have been guessing about the nature of the bad guys more. Almost as soon as the CIA agents entered the scene, they are cast as the foe to outwit. A few things were changed around in prevalent themes. This new version is considerably more gritty than what I remember and there's a lot more violence.The story focuses on planning to a certain extent but it gets sidelined a little into the obligatory romance between Face and Sosa. For the most part the changes weren't all that bad, although I do think that the movie would have been better through the middle if the romantic subplot was cut out. Sosa wanting to find the actual bad guys would have been perfectly fine, but no, any woman in an action flick must also be an object of desire, regardless of what other roles she might carry. *sigh*I need to get something out of the way before I continue too much further. I'm sorry, but however good he may or may not be in the octagon (I don't watch MMA) Quinton Jackson does not approach the level of sheer awesomeness that Mr. T did. This should not be taken as a slight against Mr. Jackson, but merely a note that when the original has an internet meme right up there with Chuck Norris's, you are going to fall short. It was still a decent job with BA's mini character journey from badass to being unable to kill to protector-warrior. I did feel that it was under explored and under utilized (especially when compared with BA's fear of flying).Liam Neeson tends to do well in just about every role I have ever seen him in and I wasn't disappointed, although I did find myself facepalming at some of the narrative decisions. Bradley Cooper also did a decent job, although I felt that some of his jokes seemed somewhat forced, although that seemed more a product of the writing as opposed to the delivery. Also, his near constant womanizing seemed rather at odds with the pseudo-romantic subplot with Sosa. The flipflop could have worked better, were he not introduced wearing a bathrobe, getting smacked around by a corrupt Mexican policemen and making remarks about the poor Mexican lady (also wearing a bathrobe) in the same scene.Then there was Sharlto Copley as Murdock. Whoever came up with that idea deserves a payraise and a cookie. I'm sure he was written as a lunatic. What I got was crazy awesome. Every time he showed up, I ended up laughing and really enjoying the chaos of the scene. which I might have otherwise been irritated at or bored by. Both of the psychiatric ward escapes were unique and undeniably funny (one involved 3D glasses). There was a scene involving mixed up fake passports that goes from tense to unexpectedly all right and then to funny. Whenever he had an active part to play in the scene, he made it work for me. I'd even go so far to say that if he wasn't in the movie, I probably would have enjoyed it far less than I did.If one is looking for a fun, funny, action type movie, I can recommend The A-Team as a good choice.",4,"Wherin the phrase ""I pity da fool"" is not uttered (but let's not hold that against it)",1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,4151,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'A-Team', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'loved', 'show', 'was', 'fun', 'action', 'candy', 'characters', 'were', 'unique', 'memorable', 'problems', 'were', 'solved', 'cleverness', 'planning', 'had', 'Mr.', 'T', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'anyone', 'want', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'big', 'screen', 'year', 'knew', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'knew', 'major', 'moviemakers', 'were', 'resorting', 'remakes', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'were', 'going', 'ramp', 'up', 'violence', 'nothing', 'quite', 'like', 'explosions', 'just', 'look', 'horrid', 'Transformers', 'movies', 'was', 'hopeful', 'actors', 'could', 'do', 'justice', 'characters', 'such', 'prepared', 'state', 'mind', 'went', 'see', 'film.The', 'team', 'accused', 'stealing', 'counterfeit', 'US', 'dollar', 'printing', 'plates', 'resulting', 'death', 'general', 'Iraq', 'War', 'break', 'military', 'prison', 'prove', 'innocence', 'Meanwhile', 'Face', 'old', 'flame', 'Sosa', 'who', 'lost', 'rank', 'result', 'incident', 'charged', 'finding', 'still', 'missing', 'plates', 'CIA', 'spook', 'named', 'Lynch', 'also', 'involved', 'simultaneously', 'helping', 'hindering', 'sides', 'own', 'purposes.The', 'plotline', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'concept', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'been', 'guessing', 'nature', 'bad', 'guys', 'more', 'Almost', 'as', 'soon', 'CIA', 'agents', 'entered', 'scene', 'are', 'cast', 'foe', 'outwit', 'few', 'things', 'were', 'changed', 'prevalent', 'themes', 'new', 'version', 'considerably', 'more', 'gritty', 'what', 'remember', 'lot', 'more', 'violence.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'planning', 'certain', 'extent', 'sidelined', 'little', 'obligatory', 'romance', 'Face', 'Sosa', 'most', 'part', 'changes', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'middle', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'Sosa', 'wanting', 'find', 'actual', 'bad', 'guys', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'woman', 'action', 'flick', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'object', 'desire', 'regardless', 'what', 'other', 'might', 'carry', '*sigh*I', 'need', 'get', 'something', 'way', 'continue', 'too', 'much', 'further', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'however', 'good', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'octagon', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'MMA', 'Quinton', 'Jackson', 'not', 'approach', 'level', 'sheer', 'awesomeness', 'Mr.', 'T', 'did', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'slight', 'Mr.', 'Jackson', 'merely', 'note', 'when', 'original', 'internet', 'meme', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'are', 'going', 'fall', 'short', 'was', 'still', 'decent', 'job', 'BA', 'mini', 'character', 'journey', 'badass', 'being', 'unable', 'kill', 'protector-warrior', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'explored', 'utilized', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'BA', 'fear', 'flying', '.Liam', 'Neeson', 'do', 'well', 'just', 'role', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'did', 'find', 'facepalming', 'narrative', 'decisions', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'also', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'felt', 'jokes', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'seemed', 'more', 'product', 'writing', 'opposed', 'delivery', 'Also', 'near', 'constant', 'womanizing', 'seemed', 'rather', 'odds', 'pseudo-romantic', 'subplot', 'Sosa', 'flipflop', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'were', 'not', 'introduced', 'wearing', 'bathrobe', 'getting', 'smacked', 'corrupt', 'Mexican', 'policemen', 'making', 'remarks', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'lady', 'also', 'wearing', 'bathrobe', 'same', 'scene.Then', 'was', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'Murdock', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'payraise', 'cookie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'written', 'lunatic', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'crazy', 'awesome', 'time', 'showed', 'up', 'ended', 'up', 'laughing', 'really', 'enjoying', 'chaos', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'irritated', 'bored', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'escapes', 'were', 'unique', 'undeniably', 'funny', 'one', 'involved', '3D', 'glasses', 'was', 'scene', 'involving', 'mixed', 'up', 'fake', 'passports', 'tense', 'unexpectedly', 'right', 'then', 'funny', 'Whenever', 'had', 'active', 'part', 'play', 'scene', 'made', 'work', ""'d"", 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'far', 'less', 'did.If', 'one', 'looking', 'fun', 'funny', 'action', 'type', 'movie', 'can', 'recommend', 'A-Team', 'good', 'choice']",N/A

I recognize the theme song and know that Mr. T was in it, but that's as far as my knowledge goes.So I came into the movie adaptation of ""The A-Team"" with no preconceptions -- and ended up with a hilariously ridiculous, over-the-top action movie that glories in just how wild and absurd it can be. However, the second half gets bogged down in ""serious"" downer drama, and a rather incoherent subplot about a treacherous CIA agent.As the story opens, Colonel Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) and his friend ""Faceman"" Peck (Bradley Cooper) are on a covert mission to take down the thuggish General Tuco. However, things go dramatically wrong when Peck gets too cuddly with Tuco's wife, and Smith ends up enlisting mohawked BA Baracus (Quinton Jackson) and insane daredevil-pilot Murdock (Sharlto Copley) to help him take down Tuco.Okay, team assembled. On to the REAL plot.Eight years later, the team is in Iraq as American forces prepare to pull out. But the team is sent on a covert mission by General Morrison (Gerald McRaney) -- retrieve US treasury plates from Saddam loyalists. The mission goes perfectly... until the team gets back, when Morrison is killed and the treacherous Brock Pike (Brian Bloom) steals the plates. With no proof of the mission's legitimacy, the A-Team is dishonorably discharged, separated and sentenced to years in prison.Six months later, a CIA agent called Lynch (Patrick Wilson) offers Hannibal reinstatement and clean records if they track down Pike and the plates, and helps Hannibal escape (courtesy of a drugged cigar). Hannibal manages to break the rest of his team out of their various prisons, pursued by Face's ex-girlfriend Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel). But it doesn't take long for the team to realize that they're being betrayed all over again...Let's be frank: ""The A-Team"" is not a good movie. From an objective cinematic standpoint, it's actually pretty awful. But it falls into that rare category of ""bad movie"" that is enjoyable when you turn off your brain and just laugh at the overblown action scenes, ridiculous antics) and scenarios that are so absurd that you just can't help but enjoy them (the entire flying-tank scene, which is pure insane cheez).And therein lies the movie's charm, because it knows that it's stupid and ridiculous. And it enjoys every single chance to be stupid and ridiculous -- Hannibal escaping a cremation oven, or the team blasting through the wall of a mental hospital. It's more a comedy than an action movie (""Excuse me, which way to Berlin?"").However, the movie tends to start fraying when it tries to be serious. The second half derails itself when the team starts getting all angsty and tortured over the betrayals they've suffered, and the whole subplot about the Treasury macguffins just feels pointless. And the more like a serious action thriller it tries to get, the more incoherent and confusing it becomes.The cast is pretty good here -- Liam Neeson plays Hannibal with cigar-chomping gusto, though able to be serious and intense when necessary. Quinton Jackson gives a thoroughly endearing performance as the bombastic BA, although his vow of not-killing feels strangely shoehorned in; Bradley Cooper is quite charming when he isn't floundering in a poorly-written romance with the prissy Jessica Biel. And no, the romance leads to nothing.But the real scene stealer is Sharlto Copley. This guy is gutsplittingly funny, and all too plausible as a possibly insane weirdo who takes every chance to be... a possibly insane weirdo (""You should see these bullets in 3D! It's like we're actually getting shot at!"").""The A-Team"" is a confusing, bombastic mess of a movie -- and when it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's also a lot of guilty-pleasure fun.

1310459,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B002ZG994U,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[3, 7]","I'll admit it, I was never a big fan of the original show. If I remember correctly, they made the point of never killing anybody, so they were forced to live by the merits of crazy plans, and the baddie-of-the-week. Needless to say, unless you were a fan of it as a kid, you don't really have fond memories of the show, and you wouldn't think it'd make a good film, however, under the direction of Joe Carnahan, the concept is taken to its logical extreme, and along the way, awesomeness is given.First off, the casting. Liam Neeson is a myth unto himself now, and the movie plays off of this perfectly. He's a crazy leader, kicking butt, taking names, and making plans. Plus, he just radiates awesomeness. Bradley Cooper is the handsome leading-man type, and that's his character. Granted, by the end of the film he does learn to become a planner, but he's mostly there to look good and crack wise, and I'm fine with that because Cooper does it well. Then there's Rampage Jackson. Since he probably had the hardest role in filling the shoes of a legend, he does pretty well with it. His acting skills are a bit iffy, but he's completely serviceable, he's good for the butt of a joke, and he can kick butt pretty well also. Finally, there's Sharlto Copley, who you may know from District 9. That happened to be his first ever movie role, and he played a largely dramatic part. In his 2nd movie role, he's there for the crazy and the funny. How do I know this? When spinning chopper blades, he sings ""You spin me right round baby, like a record baby, right round."" That's funny and crazy right? Of course it is! The only problem I had with his character though is his accent. Sometimes he sounds like his native South African, sometimes he sounds Southern. But hey, I still love him. Finally, there's Patrick Wilson as a slimy CIA agent. I had not really seen the guy in anything before this movie, but he is such a good actor, and he seems to be having a lot of fun in relishing the ridiculous role. Trust me, there's a scene with Patrick Wilson in an SUV that's just so brilliant on his part.Next up, plot. This aspect is beside the point mostly, but it's still pretty decent in its own right. You'll have a hard time keeping up with its various ""twists and turns,"" but you'll get the gist of what's happening, and that's what's really important, since it just serves to take you from setpiece to setpiece. Also, this plot does have holes, so don't be surprised if you get Swiss Cheese instead of Cheddar.Finally, the action. This is really the whole point of the movie, and on this aspect, it really delivers. It's original, it's engaging, it's fun, and it's awesome. Among the highlights? The classic scene of the A-Team ""flying"" a tank, and a cargo ship blowing to smithereens, and it's CGI cargo reigning down. I mean, when the whole point of your movie is to get to the action, you have to deliver, and this movie does just that, and then some.Overall, Stuff blows up. Comedic lines are given. The characters are great. The movie is consistently entertaining. What more do you need? It's like the most recent revival of Star Trek in a way. A tired series is given new life with a great cast that adds their own personality to classic characters, action to be had & a plot to accommodate it all.

Of course you know I had tog o see it and own it when it was released on DVD and Blu Ray. So here we are and I am finally going to review it, something I should have done a while back. Still better late than never I always say, or is that some one else's saying, anyway.This not you're A-Team you may remember from the TV show, no not at all, could be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Me personally I loved this new version and found it to be nothing more than just pure fun. It also didn't hurt that one of my favorite MMA fighters Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson is in this movie as BA. Any way regardless of all that this is a very fun flick that is meant just to be that, fun. So turn the brain off and enjoy what is on the screen.The story follows a group of men that come together in one hilarious moment after the next and form a new group in the US military. They tackle the missions that no one else can and do it in the most outrageous yet ingenious ways ever. You know, they take on the jobs no one else can or wants to, I love it. Any way they are sent out onto another one of these missions and are successful of course, but there triumphant return is spoiled by the murder of their commanding officer. With no record of him sending them on this mission and the military thinking they killed him they are sent to live out the rest of their days in prison. So after they escape prison, with a little help from a not so trustworthy guy they plan on clearing their names.The film is just straight up fun, nothing more nothing less, if you try to turn on the brain you may disappointed. Everything in this movie goes bang and everything is pure dumb fun. I knew this going in luckily so I had a great time watching it. Not to mention that mixed martial artist Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson plays BA, love it. He is a very funny guy in real life and it shows here, you can tell had fun doing this. Liam Neeson is brilliant in this and plays his character up, as does Bradley Cooper who is just his plain old self, which is a good thing here. Sharlto Copley is a show stealer as Murdock, way to funny, brilliant job. Patrick Wilson, and Brian Bloom are equally as good here as two of the villains in this film, great jobs on both parts.It is obvious that I enjoyed this film but I must say that you have to go in knowing what you are getting. If you do I think you will have a good time as well, writer/director Joe Carnahan along with fellow writers Skip Woods and even Brian Bloom himself did a great job making this just pointless fun. I do recommend this film if you are looking for a good, dumb, fun flick for a weekend afternoon or something.",4,JUST PLAIN FUN,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,2831,"['A', 'TEAMWhen', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'one', 'favorite', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'artists', 'Quinton', ""'Rampage"", 'Jackson', 'would', 'star', 'course', 'know', 'had', 'tog', 'o', 'see', 'own', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'am', 'finally', 'going', 'review', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'while', 'back', 'Still', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'always', 'say', 'one', 'else', 'saying', 'anyway.This', 'not', ""'re"", 'A-Team', 'may', 'remember', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'Me', 'personally', 'loved', 'new', 'version', 'found', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'pure', 'fun', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'one', 'favorite', 'MMA', 'fighters', 'Quinton', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'BA', 'way', 'regardless', 'very', 'fun', 'flick', 'meant', 'just', 'be', 'fun', 'So', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'what', 'screen.The', 'story', 'group', 'men', 'come', 'together', 'one', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'next', 'form', 'new', 'group', 'US', 'military', 'tackle', 'missions', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'do', 'most', 'outrageous', 'yet', 'ingenious', 'ways', 'ever', 'know', 'take', 'jobs', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'love', 'way', 'are', 'sent', 'out', 'one', 'missions', 'are', 'successful', 'course', 'there', 'triumphant', 'return', 'spoiled', 'murder', 'commanding', 'officer', 'record', 'sending', 'mission', 'military', 'thinking', 'killed', 'are', 'sent', 'live', 'out', 'rest', 'days', 'prison', 'So', 'escape', 'prison', 'little', 'help', 'not', 'so', 'trustworthy', 'guy', 'plan', 'clearing', 'names.The', 'film', 'just', 'straight', 'up', 'fun', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'try', 'turn', 'brain', 'may', 'disappointed', 'Everything', 'movie', 'bang', 'everything', 'pure', 'dumb', 'fun', 'knew', 'going', 'luckily', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'Not', 'mention', 'mixed', 'martial', 'artist', 'Quinton', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'BA', 'love', 'very', 'funny', 'guy', 'real', 'life', 'here', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'fun', 'doing', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'brilliant', 'character', 'up', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'self', 'good', 'thing', 'here', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'show', 'stealer', 'Murdock', 'way', 'funny', 'brilliant', 'job', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Brian', 'Bloom', 'are', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'here', 'two', 'villains', 'film', 'great', 'jobs', 'parts.It', 'obvious', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'have', 'go', 'knowing', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'well', 'writer/director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'fellow', 'writers', 'Skip', 'Woods', 'even', 'Brian', 'Bloom', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'just', 'pointless', 'fun', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'dumb', 'fun', 'flick', 'weekend', 'afternoon', 'something']",N/A

1310466,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG994U,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","THE A-TEAM succeeded as a television series by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell because it knew how to mix gore and comedy.  The same is true for the movie version written by Director Joe Carnahan with Brian Bloom and Skip Woods - dipping in to the original series a bit.  It is a fast moving kicker of an evening's entertainment, not a challenge to the brain but fun all the same.This A-Team has been out of action for a while but regroup to do the impossible - enter Bagdad and capture the counterfeit plates for 100-dollar bills before the 'enemy' makes a mint of fake money.  From the get-go this bizarre group of Special Forces soldiers seem to make things up as they go - the 'plan' being the ideal process but one that basically eludes them - or does it?  This particular cinematic A-Team is composed of the leader Col. Hannibal Smith (a gray haired but fast thinking Liam Neeson), the lady-killer stud Face (a very buff Bradley Cooper), hard-nosed mohawked Baracus (Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson) and the ever so loony Murdock (the new and very promising Sharlto Copley).  Put these guys in helicopters, in tanks, in every imaginable disastrous situation and they manage to come out just fine and making hilarious jokes of the whole thing. Part of the pleasure of this otherwise forgettable film is the obvious fun the cast members are having.  The special effects are better than usual, the supporting cast boasts such actors as Jessica Biel, Gerald McRaney, Patrick Wilson, Yul Vazquez, Henry Czerny, and Jon Hamm - some in roles that pass so fast that they almost go unnoticed.  Alan Silvestri provides the musical score that is as entertaining on its own as the film itself and the Director of Photography Mauro Fiore is the one that give us the impossible effects a near tenable reality.This is a film to rent or buy for an evening of escapism.

""If you have a problem, if no one else can help...and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... the A-Team."" This is a perfectly suitable, updated big screen adaptation of the television adventure show. No, these aren't the actors that I grew up watching, and Dirk Benedict was one of my childhood heroes, having played ""Face"" and ""Starbuck"" - and George Peppard and Mr. T were hugely iconic. But this new cast doesn't embarrass itself, even if it doesn't quite supplant the original actors. I pity the fool who tries to replace Mr. T.Ixnay on the Vietnam War-ay; this quartet of elite Army Rangers is firmly entrenched in contemporary times, and you can guess what sexy war in which they made their hay. The movie opens in Mexico as it unveils the A-Team's origin (and how B.A. got his fear of flying). After glossing over this Alpha unit's following eighty successful missions over the span of eight years, the movie arrives at the meat of the plot. It involves the heist of U.S. currency plates and a calculated frame job which lands the team behind bars. It turns out, you really can't trust private contractors. Or the CIA. No, really.Except that men of action can sit on their hands for only so long, doing bupkis. Six months in stir is more than long enough for Colonel Hannibal Smith to hatch and implement a jailbreak. He springs his cohorts (quite easily), and off they go, seeking bloody retribution, the mastermind, the mad dog pilot, the pretty, pretty con man... and the pacifist. Because after six months of incarceration, Corporal Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus has grown out his mohawk and embraced non-violence. And that's not the only swerve.Liam Neeson as Col. Hannibal Smith is an interesting choice, and while he doesn't dethrone George Peppard's original interpretation, he lends plenty of gravitas. It's hard to front on a good actor like Neeson. Meanwhile, Lt. ""Faceman"" Peck, confirmed bachelor and carouser supreme, harbors serious hankerings for the very fine Lieutenant Sosa, an old flame who keeps walking in and out of his life. And since she's played by Jessica Biel, you can understand his hang-up. This romantic thread provides the film's one stab at narrative depth, and it still plays sorta frivolous. But it's undeniable that Biel and Bradley Cooper set up sparks.When is overkill a good thing? When it's the A-Team in a motion picture, is when. Fans of the television show will flock to this. Casual viewers may wonder what the fuss is about. But let's not lie to ourselves now, we didn't come to watch this film to sip tea and behave all artsy fartzy. It's not Jane Austen's THE A-TEAM. We expect rough and rugged humor and the swagger and these four boisterous personalities interacting with each other. And we expect the audacious cartoon violence as only the A-Team can deliver it. And we get what we expect. It doesn't get loopier than when ""Mad Dog"" Murdoch ends up flying a friggin' tank! And, for the nostalgics, there's even a fleeting cameo of Dirk Benedict, the original Faceman. So, no, you won't stumble over any rich plot development. Instead, you have to push that ""Suspension of Disbelief"" button. This button is located right next to the switch labeled ""Now Inject Introspective Scene In Film"" (this switch doesn't work).For the trivia-heads: Real life MMA fighter Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson, who plays B.A. Baracus, lost some street cred when he got his bu++ beat in his very next octagon match following this film.The DVD's bonus features: The option to watch the film in either the Theatrical Release (01:58:40 minutes) or the Extended Version (02:13:26 minutes); Audio Commentary by director Joe Carnahan (but only on the theatrical version); an A-TEAM theme mash-up montage (00:01:35); and the theatrical trailer.",4,"""They are the best, and they specialize in the ridiculous.""",1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,3866,"['Here', 'really', 'truncated', 'Movies', 'Review', '2010', 'First', 'came', 'THE', 'LOSERS', 'then', 'came', 'real', 'thing', 'have', 'problem', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'help', 'can', 'find', 'maybe', 'can', 'hire', 'A-Team', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'updated', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'television', 'adventure', 'show', 'No', 'are', ""n't"", 'actors', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'was', 'one', 'childhood', 'heroes', 'having', 'played', 'Face', 'Starbuck', 'George', 'Peppard', 'Mr.', 'T', 'were', 'hugely', 'iconic', 'new', 'cast', ""n't"", 'embarrass', 'even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'supplant', 'original', 'actors', 'pity', 'fool', 'who', 'replace', 'Mr.', 'T.Ixnay', 'Vietnam', 'War-ay', 'quartet', 'elite', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'contemporary', 'times', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'sexy', 'war', 'made', 'hay', 'movie', 'Mexico', 'A-Team', 'origin', 'how', 'B.A', 'got', 'fear', 'flying', 'glossing', 'Alpha', 'unit', 'following', 'eighty', 'successful', 'missions', 'span', 'eight', 'years', 'movie', 'meat', 'plot', 'heist', 'U.S.', 'currency', 'plates', 'calculated', 'frame', 'job', 'team', 'bars', 'out', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'private', 'contractors', 'CIA', 'No', 'really.Except', 'men', 'action', 'can', 'sit', 'hands', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'doing', 'bupkis', 'Six', 'months', 'stir', 'more', 'long', 'enough', 'Colonel', 'Hannibal', 'Smith', 'hatch', 'implement', 'jailbreak', 'cohorts', 'quite', 'easily', 'go', 'seeking', 'bloody', 'retribution', 'mastermind', 'mad', 'dog', 'pilot', 'pretty', 'pretty', 'con', 'man', 'pacifist', 'six', 'months', 'incarceration', 'Corporal', 'Bosco', 'B.A', 'Baracus', 'grown', 'out', 'mohawk', 'embraced', 'non-violence', 'not', 'only', 'swerve.Liam', 'Neeson', 'Col.', 'Hannibal', 'Smith', 'interesting', 'choice', ""n't"", 'dethrone', 'George', 'Peppard', 'original', 'interpretation', 'plenty', 'gravitas', 'hard', 'front', 'good', 'actor', 'Neeson', 'Meanwhile', 'Lt.', 'Faceman', 'Peck', 'confirmed', 'bachelor', 'carouser', 'supreme', 'harbors', 'serious', 'hankerings', 'very', 'fine', 'Lieutenant', 'Sosa', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'walking', 'life', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'can', 'understand', 'hang-up', 'romantic', 'thread', 'film', 'one', 'stab', 'narrative', 'depth', 'still', 'sorta', 'frivolous', 'undeniable', 'Biel', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'set', 'up', 'sparks.When', 'good', 'thing', 'When', 'A-Team', 'motion', 'picture', 'when', 'Fans', 'television', 'show', 'will', 'flock', 'Casual', 'viewers', 'may', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'let', 'not', 'lie', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'watch', 'film', 'sip', 'tea', 'behave', 'artsy', 'fartzy', 'not', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'A-TEAM', 'expect', 'rough', 'rugged', 'humor', 'swagger', 'four', 'boisterous', 'personalities', 'interacting', 'other', 'expect', 'audacious', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'only', 'A-Team', 'can', 'deliver', 'get', 'what', 'expect', ""n't"", 'get', 'loopier', 'when', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Murdoch', 'up', 'flying', 'friggin', 'tank', 'nostalgics', 'even', 'fleeting', 'cameo', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'original', 'Faceman', 'So', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stumble', 'over', 'rich', 'plot', 'development', 'Instead', 'have', 'push', 'Suspension', 'Disbelief', 'button', 'button', 'located', 'right', 'next', 'switch', 'labeled', 'Now', 'Inject', 'Introspective', 'Scene', 'Film', 'switch', ""n't"", 'work', '.For', 'trivia-heads', 'Real', 'life', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'Quinton', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'who', 'B.A', 'Baracus', 'lost', 'street', 'cred', 'when', 'got', 'bu++', 'beat', 'very', 'next', 'octagon', 'match', 'following', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'option', 'watch', 'film', 'Theatrical', 'Release', '01:58:40', 'minutes', 'Extended', 'Version', '02:13:26', 'minutes', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'only', 'theatrical', 'version', 'A-TEAM', 'theme', 'mash-up', 'montage', '00:01:35', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

In the reboot, Liam Neeson (Hannibal), Bradley Cooper (Face), Sharlto Copley (Murdock) and Rampage Jackson (BA) star in the lead roles, and the story deals with the team trying to clear their names.The movie is fantastic, it truly is. The direction is great because the film, with all the impossible stunts and over-the-top action, doesn't take itself completely seriously, but when it does it sends chills down your spine. The sad thing about the film though, is that the extended cut that was released on disc was better than the theatrical cut, having an expanded script that let us see the serious side of Murdock and Face, as well as the friendship between the team being stretched to its limits in this desperate time. The acting was just great, with everyone becoming their characters nicely, even Jessica Biel's supporting role as an old flame of Face's. The musical score by Alan Silversti was fitting and bombastic, the visual effects were good but nothing award-wining, and the movie sets up a sequel perfectly. And it is there the flaw of the film resides, as (because of the stupidity of the general public) the film failed at the box office, and therefore a sequel will not happen, unless someone gets on Kickstarter to have the public help fund a sequel. And hopefully someone does within the year.The A-Team is a hysterical, fun and wild action movie that has laughs throughout and a story that shows true friendship can never be broken.4.5/5 Stars",5,"A Fun, Over-the-Top Action Thriller With A Heart",1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,1624,"['A-Team', '2010', 'reboot', '80', 'TV', 'show', 'group', 'American', 'soldiers', 'dishonorably', 'discharged', 'being', 'framed', 'death', 'General', 'reboot', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Hannibal', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Face', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'Murdock', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'BA', 'star', 'lead', 'roles', 'story', 'deals', 'team', 'trying', 'clear', 'names.The', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'truly', 'direction', 'great', 'film', 'impossible', 'stunts', 'over-the-top', 'action', ""n't"", 'take', 'completely', 'seriously', 'when', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'sad', 'thing', 'film', 'extended', 'cut', 'was', 'released', 'disc', 'was', 'better', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'having', 'expanded', 'script', 'let', 'see', 'serious', 'side', 'Murdock', 'Face', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'team', 'being', 'stretched', 'limits', 'desperate', 'time', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'everyone', 'becoming', 'characters', 'nicely', 'even', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'supporting', 'role', 'old', 'flame', 'Face', 'musical', 'score', 'Alan', 'Silversti', 'was', 'fitting', 'bombastic', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'nothing', 'award-wining', 'movie', 'up', 'sequel', 'perfectly', 'there', 'flaw', 'film', 'resides', 'stupidity', 'general', 'public', 'film', 'failed', 'box', 'office', 'therefore', 'sequel', 'will', 'not', 'happen', 'someone', 'Kickstarter', 'have', 'public', 'help', 'fund', 'sequel', 'hopefully', 'someone', 'year.The', 'A-Team', 'hysterical', 'fun', 'wild', 'action', 'movie', 'laughs', 'story', 'true', 'friendship', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'broken.4.5/5', 'Stars']",N/A

After finally deciding to give it a chance, I felt like a fool in search of pity for being so ignorant.  Simply put, it's AWESOME.Liam Neeson is an impeccable replacement for George Peppard (slight edge to Peppard) as Hannibal Smith, with the same charismatic leadership ability and unwaivering confidence that a plan will come together.  Bradley Cooper is an improvement over Dirk Benedict, creating a Face that is not just good with the ladies, but also capable of carrying an action movie.  The reincarnation of B.A. Baracus is undoubtedly better, as Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson provides more size, strength, and, dare I say it, acting ability than Mr. T.  Obviously, Jackson loses the gold chain contest.  Last but not least is Murdock, played by Sharlto Copley.  There is no doubt whatsoever that he dominates time on screen, and Dwight Schulz, who has all but become an afterthought.  The amazing part about all this is not only are the actors/characters adequate replacements of the originals, but their storylines also get expanded upon and further explained.  The one major flaw to this film is Jessica Biel's character.  As a Captain who gets demoted to Lieutenant, no matter what agency or military she's in, her character is given far too much leeway and power; it's a flaw that a former member of the military can't possibly overlook without it lessening the movie's plot somewhat.After the foursome is introduced, flash-forward eight years to when they become engaged in a convoluted scheme battling the CIA, a Blackwater facsimile, and mysterious foreigners over some $100 U.S. currency engraving plates, the theft for which the A-Team has been framed.  From there it is nothing but explosions, guns, chases, airplanes, tanks, fights, and everything you expect in an action movie.  The camera work is overall above average, but there is a bit of shaky-cam during some of the action scenes.Highly recommended for a great, reminiscent time.Jason Elin",5,"If you liked the original A-Team, you will LOVE this one",1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,2127,"['Given', 'Hollywood', 'taken', 'raping', 'fondest', 'childhood', 'memories', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'was', 'definitely', 'hesitant', 'when', 'heard', 'A-Team', 'remake', 'finally', 'deciding', 'give', 'chance', 'felt', 'fool', 'search', 'pity', 'being', 'so', 'ignorant', 'Simply', 'put', 'AWESOME.Liam', 'Neeson', 'impeccable', 'replacement', 'George', 'Peppard', 'slight', 'edge', 'Peppard', 'Hannibal', 'Smith', 'same', 'charismatic', 'leadership', 'ability', 'unwaivering', 'confidence', 'plan', 'will', 'come', 'together', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'improvement', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'creating', 'Face', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'ladies', 'also', 'capable', 'carrying', 'action', 'movie', 'reincarnation', 'B.A', 'Baracus', 'undoubtedly', 'better', 'Quinton', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'more', 'size', 'strength', 'dare', 'say', 'acting', 'ability', 'Mr.', 'T.', 'Obviously', 'Jackson', 'gold', 'chain', 'contest', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Murdock', 'played', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'doubt', 'whatsoever', 'time', 'screen', 'Dwight', 'Schulz', 'who', 'become', 'afterthought', 'amazing', 'part', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'actors/characters', 'adequate', 'replacements', 'originals', 'storylines', 'also', 'get', 'expanded', 'upon', 'further', 'explained', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'character', 'Captain', 'who', 'demoted', 'Lieutenant', 'matter', 'what', 'agency', 'military', 'character', 'given', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'leeway', 'power', 'flaw', 'former', 'member', 'military', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'overlook', 'lessening', 'movie', 'plot', 'somewhat.After', 'foursome', 'introduced', 'flash-forward', 'eight', 'years', 'when', 'become', 'engaged', 'convoluted', 'scheme', 'battling', 'CIA', 'Blackwater', 'facsimile', 'mysterious', 'foreigners', '100', 'U.S.', 'currency', 'engraving', 'plates', 'theft', 'A-Team', 'been', 'framed', 'nothing', 'explosions', 'guns', 'chases', 'airplanes', 'tanks', 'fights', 'everything', 'expect', 'action', 'movie', 'camera', 'work', 'overall', 'above', 'average', 'bit', 'shaky-cam', 'action', 'scenes.Highly', 'recommended', 'great', 'reminiscent', 'time.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

1310491,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B002ZG994U,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","In Hollywood, when you graduate an 80s TV Show into a major motion picture, comparisons will be made.  I did this in another interview that I posted for The Dukes of Hazzard movie, it's inevitable.  How faithful were they to the spirit of the show?  Did they eliminate the bad and keep the good?  In many cases, some TV shows from the 80s had a great premise but were dragged down by the perils of minimal TV budgets, short sighted producers and censorship.  When they get 110 million and a competent creation crew behind them, their true colors can really come through.  Such is the case with The A-Team.I must say, I'm extremely saddened to hear that the movie didn't do well enough in the theater or even on home video to warrant a sequel.  I think the casting of the four actors was brilliant and the story line aspired to the best aspects of the TV show.  The A Team is a blast to watch.  These four gentlemen have charisma and chemistry beyond belief and they really reflect a brotherhood far beyond the stale and 2 dimensional characters created by their TV counterparts.  That's not to say the actors in the show were bad, George Peppard alone gave the show an aire of respectability.  Dwight Schultz was always in perfect manic form and Dirk Benedict was most likely born for the role of Face.  However, the weekly grind of making a show where automatic weapons are fired and cars jump several feet without hurting anyone becomes monotonous after some time.Liam Neeson is undoubtedly one of the most charismatic actors of our time.  No one brings his brand of leadership quality to the screen like he does.  So who better to play the cigar chomping Colonial `Hannibal' Smith then him?  No one.  It's so easy to believe that everyone who meets this man feels like they would help him do anything.  That if he asked them to do something, they would do it, no questions asked.  Bradley Cooper is a perfect choice as well for Lt. Templeton `Faceman' Peck, the pretty boy, smooth talking `get-anything-if-you-need-it' operator.  Sharlto Copley...who is this guy?  I'd never heard of him but I have to say, he nailed the role as Murdoch.  He brings just the right amount of wackiness mixed with competence to convince us to trust him, despite his `verge-of-insanity' characteristics.  Then there's Quinton `Rampage' Jackson playing Bosco `BA' Baracus.  Again, another guy I'd never heard of.  I'm not familiar with the players in the MMA world but this guy really has something.  He played BA with multiple levels of anger and sometimes emotion in just the right places.  I was impressed with Quiton and I thought he filled the shoes of Mr. T and then some.  The best part is the script allows us to believe these guys are a true working team that plays to each others strengths and helps balance their weaknesses.  They're not perfect, but they are smart, competent and with the guidance of their leader, Hannibal, capable of doing almost anything.The movie chooses to focus on how the four came together and their subsequent story that is the premise of the TV show; being convicted of a crime they didn't commit.  The movie starts with a series of events that bring the four together and solidifies BA's fear of flying, for anyone who thought it was strange that BA (a former Army Ranger) would have a fear of flying, this explains it very well.  It then jumps forward eight years with the four involved in the middle east conflict after running eighty successful missions and ready to be discharged.  Of course, this is where it gets dicey.  During a last minute mission designed to avoid political upheaval and bloodshed by a security/paramilitary contractor group, things go very bad.  The four are arrested and tried under military tribunal, stripped of ranks and sent to separate incarceration facilities.  Six months later they escape with the help of a twisted CIA agent (played by Patrick Wilson) and the chase in on to clear their names.  Jessica Beil plays the DOD officer assigned to track them down and stop them.  Being a former flame of Face, her character goes in full tilt but later starts to lean toward their cause.  Both Wilson and Beil play their parts well as a split of their TV counterparts, Col Lynch and Col Decker.  Oddly Wilson's character calls himself Lynch when he meets with Hannibal.Joe Carnahan is the director behind this gem and I have to say, after watching Smoking Aces, I wasn't convinced he could pull this off.  Not that Smoking Aces is a bad movie, but it had it's unbalances and it overdone characters to the point where it was almost cartoonish.  But he most certainly did pull this one off.  His direction and attention to character interaction as well putting in just the right amount of humor mixed with the more serious tone of the movie makes for a very entertaining picture.  It takes the best aspects of the TV Show and works it all together very well.  Sure there are a few `Hollywood' moments but they are easily overlooked in the course of the movie.  Again I state that it's a shame  a sequel won't be made due to lack of revenue but maybe if enough people read this review and trust my impressions, they'll give it a try.  If anything, it's a fun movie and at least worth a look.For Blu Ray fans, the Blu Ray of this movie looks awesome and sounds just as good.",4,A+ for The A Team,1315440000,"09 8,

That isn't exactly the show since the A-Team just wanted to clear their names, they never killed anyone. Even when a truck went flying off a cliff in the show the bad guys would get out and just dust themselves off.The movie is a big non-stop action mess, but it's so silly that it's entertaining. What makes it better than a big mess like Transformers 2 though, is that it's great fun if you've seen the show. I mean Transformers 3 might as well be called the Adventures of Sam Witwicky. Here the characters from the show are at least alive again and so are some of their antics that we grew up with and loved. So in another words, the A-Team aren't side characters for a horny teen who's in love with a hot girl in tight clothes.When there's not brainless action, Sharlto Copley does get to have some fun being a nut, playing Howling Mad Murdock. While he has chemistry with Rampage Jackson, who plays B.A. They argue as much as they do in the show, but until Murdock cooks for B.A to calm him down. I don't think anything calmed down B.A in the show, but I found that humorous as well.While Bradley Cooper's Face, is more of a nut than Dirk Benedict's though. Dirk's Face hated to be punched in the face because it was his meal ticket, here Cooper even begs a guy to hit him. Cooper still has moments where his Face gets to flirt with woman though to get what he wants.Hannibal Smith isn't really done justice though. Liam Neeson hams it up as best as he can with big cigars and a sadistic smile, but no one could replace the late great George Peppard. Peppard brought so much energy to the show, that it's hard to believe that he died only 6 or 7 years after it was canceled. I did at least laugh in the film when Hannibal needed a disguise to walk through an airport.... he went as Liam Neeson lol. Well not literally, but he had the usual Liam Neeson look in that scene and in the scene that followed, he was back to Hannibals gray hair. So it's little things like that I found funny.When I heard Patrick Wilson was playing Lynch, I expected the serious Colonel from the show that was always in pursuit of the A-Team. But here, one of the silliest things is that a lot of guys have the name Lynch. So even though Wilson's Lynch is practically Michael Bay and likes blowing stuff up, doesn't mean he's supposed to be the Lynch from the show. But anyway, now that is cleared up, Patrick Wilson is surprisingly a lot of fun and livens up the brainless action scenes with funny one-liners, like ""damn, that reminds me of playing Call of Duty"".",4,"Not Exactly the show, but fun neverless",1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,2680,"['When', 'group', 'war', 'veterans', 'are', 'framed', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'are', 'clear', 'names', 'revenge', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'show', 'A-Team', 'just', 'wanted', 'clear', 'names', 'never', 'killed', 'anyone', 'Even', 'when', 'truck', 'went', 'flying', 'off', 'cliff', 'show', 'bad', 'guys', 'would', 'get', 'out', 'just', 'dust', 'off.The', 'movie', 'big', 'non-stop', 'action', 'mess', 'so', 'silly', 'entertaining', 'What', 'better', 'big', 'mess', 'Transformers', '2', 'great', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'mean', 'Transformers', '3', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'called', 'Adventures', 'Sam', 'Witwicky', 'Here', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'least', 'alive', 'again', 'so', 'are', 'antics', 'grew', 'up', 'loved', 'So', 'words', 'A-Team', 'are', ""n't"", 'side', 'characters', 'horny', 'teen', 'who', 'love', 'hot', 'girl', 'tight', 'clothes.When', 'not', 'brainless', 'action', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'get', 'have', 'fun', 'being', 'nut', 'playing', 'Howling', 'Mad', 'Murdock', 'chemistry', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'who', 'B.A', 'argue', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'show', 'Murdock', 'cooks', 'B.A', 'calm', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'calmed', 'down', 'B.A', 'show', 'found', 'that', 'humorous', 'well.While', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Face', 'more', 'nut', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'though', 'Dirk', 'Face', 'hated', 'be', 'punched', 'face', 'was', 'meal', 'ticket', 'here', 'Cooper', 'even', 'guy', 'hit', 'Cooper', 'still', 'moments', 'where', 'Face', 'flirt', 'woman', 'get', 'what', 'wants.Hannibal', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'really', 'done', 'justice', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'hams', 'up', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'big', 'cigars', 'sadistic', 'smile', 'one', 'could', 'replace', 'late', 'great', 'George', 'Peppard', 'Peppard', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'show', 'hard', 'believe', 'died', 'only', '6', '7', 'years', 'was', 'canceled', 'did', 'least', 'laugh', 'film', 'when', 'Hannibal', 'needed', 'disguise', 'walk', 'airport', 'went', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'lol', 'Well', 'not', 'literally', 'had', 'usual', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'look', 'scene', 'scene', 'followed', 'was', 'back', 'Hannibals', 'gray', 'hair', 'little', 'things', 'found', 'funny.When', 'heard', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'was', 'playing', 'Lynch', 'expected', 'serious', 'Colonel', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'pursuit', 'A-Team', 'here', 'one', 'silliest', 'things', 'lot', 'guys', 'have', 'name', 'Lynch', 'So', 'even', 'Wilson', 'Lynch', 'practically', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'blowing', 'stuff', 'up', ""n't"", 'mean', 'supposed', 'be', 'Lynch', 'show', 'anyway', 'now', 'cleared', 'up', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'surprisingly', 'lot', 'fun', 'up', 'brainless', 'action', 'scenes', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'damn', 'playing', 'Call', 'Duty']",N/A

A group of four elite troops who specialize in the most difficult missions are double crossed.  But who and how deep does the double cross run?  As someone who grew up watching the A-Team on TV I was over all very satisfied with the story and I really enjoyed the actors portraying the four main characters, all did a great job.  The bad guys were fairy one-dimensional as expected. My problem with the movie centers on one glaring and really annoying character, that of Sosa played by Jessica Biel.  She was good in Blade Trinity and can do an action move so it wasn't necessarily her acting but the character she played.  Sosa was ridiculously slow witted and annoying.  She just ""knows"" the A-Team is guilty the entire movie until the last ten minutes when she suddenly wises up?

Hollywood remakes always give that sense of 'oh no, how are they gonna screw that one up?' I'm happy to say this time they did good.  They took the old formula, fed it an adrenaline and steroid cocktail and turned it loose.At the beginning the boys aren't together yet- Hannibal and Face are a two-man Army Intelligence team.  Hannibal encounters BA en route to securing Murdock's piloting services - after liberating him from the Army Psych Ward, of course- in order to rescue his protege, and a friendship is born.The plot centers upon a CIA-sponsored op to recover stolen money plates and about a billion in fake cash from Iraqi racketeers during the final days of the war.  There's some animosity with some Blackwater-style mercs led by a man called Pike, who objects to Hannibal taking what he sees as their assignment.  After a successful mission, the plates are stolen and their contact murdered, leaving the fellas to face a court-martial.  Their CIA contact wants them to finish the job, the group wants payback, and the movie gets rolling.All the actors did well in their roles- especially for BA (Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson of the UFC) and Murdock (Sharlto Copley from District 9).  You got the feeling those two just crunched through the boxed sets one weekend and showed up on set the next day.  Bradley Cooper as Face looked like he completed a Charles Atlas course; he's come up since his time on 'Alias'. Liam Neeson was a little less cocky than George Peppard.  Jessica Biel's ice princess role as Face's ex-girlfriend managed not to detract from anything.  Even Brian Bloom was good for some laughs along the way.The best thing is that the movie doesn't try too hard- its pure entertainment.  Product placements, silliness, witticisms, catch phrases, over-the-top action- its all good.  Toss in a couple of decent plot twists- yes, I said that- and a few touches of character arc and you got a winner!  Despite a few stunts that did stretch my limits, it's all part of the fun.  I even liked the 'flying the tank' scene... don't ask; just go see it and sit back with a tub of popcorn.

Being the product of a time in television when the term ""cheese"" was still limited to a dairy product, there's a rare dilemma that director Carnahan was left with:  How much cheese is too much cheese in this day and age?  It's a legitimate inquiry in the face of a fan base that would likely want loyalty to the source material, above all else.Here lies the search for an equilibrium that most directors have the benefit of ignoring for the majority of their career; you'll see people working with extremities, certainly, but nobody has the gull to ask for the best of both worlds when the budget and the namesake are on the line.  Here, both are susceptible to permanent damage if the right balance ISN'T found.Fortunately, Carnahan gets it right, and with no credence to his track list as a director.  It's a welcome surprise.  Your disbelief is politely asked to be suspended, and that may irk some who have settled into the standards of contemporary cinema, but the charm will win you over.  For those that know better than to walk in with any concept of accuracy in physics and life probabilities, you'll be much more satisfied.But the important factor to understand, here, is that it has enough to appeal to each party, and that's something to be proud of.  The wit only goes on to act as bonus filler for a movie that already knows its place and itself.  That's not to say that the intelligent script shouldn't be lauded, because it certainly should.  Everyone participates in a real bite that every summer movie strives to have, and it goes a long way towards tricking us into thinking that every dynamic plan that Alpha concocts is smarter than it actually is.Moves to make a friendly cast were pivotal in keeping all of this broad-range appeal in check, and this is where the producers hit a home run.  Although veteran Neeson seems like a slightly too obvious choice for Hannibal, the rest of the cast joins in to encompass something of a peculiar mob of tier 2 actors that intrigue at face-value.  It really comes together on the screen, with Cooper, Jackson, and Copley making names for themselves almost immediately.  Jackson definitely had the most to prove, here, and I can only hope that this performance will be enough to write off ""Rampage"" from his acting resume'.However, the show stealer award belongs to Wilson, who's sardonic, insidious humor in conjunction with his role as the overconfident, screwy CIA agent makes him the perfect antagonist to build off of.It all forms to make the A-Team hard to deny, for it is genuine.  There are no tricks or flair associated with this movie, and its honesty should be appreciated.  Humility is easy to underrate, but make no mistake, it's difficult to come by in blockbusters as of late.",3,The A - Team,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2873,"['Listen', 'A-Team', 'smart', 'not', 'damn', 'thing', 'ya', ""'ll"", 'can', 'do', 'about', 'it.Well', 'when', 'be', 'anyway', 'Being', 'product', 'time', 'television', 'when', 'term', 'cheese', 'was', 'still', 'limited', 'dairy', 'product', 'rare', 'dilemma', 'director', 'Carnahan', 'was', 'left', 'How', 'much', 'cheese', 'too', 'much', 'cheese', 'day', 'age', 'legitimate', 'inquiry', 'face', 'fan', 'base', 'would', 'likely', 'want', 'loyalty', 'source', 'material', 'else.Here', 'search', 'equilibrium', 'most', 'directors', 'have', 'benefit', 'ignoring', 'majority', 'career', ""'ll"", 'see', 'people', 'working', 'extremities', 'certainly', 'nobody', 'gull', 'ask', 'best', 'worlds', 'when', 'budget', 'namesake', 'are', 'line', 'Here', 'are', 'susceptible', 'permanent', 'damage', 'right', 'balance', ""N'T"", 'found.Fortunately', 'Carnahan', 'right', 'credence', 'track', 'list', 'director', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'disbelief', 'politely', 'asked', 'be', 'suspended', 'may', 'irk', 'who', 'have', 'settled', 'standards', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'charm', 'will', 'win', 'over', 'know', 'better', 'walk', 'concept', 'accuracy', 'physics', 'life', 'probabilities', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'more', 'satisfied.But', 'important', 'factor', 'understand', 'here', 'enough', 'appeal', 'party', 'something', 'be', 'proud', 'wit', 'only', 'act', 'bonus', 'filler', 'movie', 'already', 'place', 'not', 'say', 'intelligent', 'script', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'lauded', 'certainly', 'should', 'Everyone', 'real', 'bite', 'summer', 'movie', 'strives', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'tricking', 'thinking', 'dynamic', 'plan', 'Alpha', 'smarter', 'actually', 'make', 'friendly', 'cast', 'were', 'pivotal', 'keeping', 'broad-range', 'appeal', 'check', 'where', 'producers', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'veteran', 'Neeson', 'slightly', 'too', 'obvious', 'choice', 'Hannibal', 'rest', 'cast', 'encompass', 'something', 'peculiar', 'mob', '2', 'actors', 'intrigue', 'face-value', 'really', 'together', 'screen', 'Cooper', 'Jackson', 'Copley', 'making', 'names', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Jackson', 'definitely', 'had', 'most', 'prove', 'here', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'write', 'off', 'Rampage', 'acting', ""resume'.However"", 'show', 'award', 'belongs', 'Wilson', 'who', 'sardonic', 'insidious', 'humor', 'conjunction', 'role', 'overconfident', 'screwy', 'CIA', 'agent', 'perfect', 'antagonist', 'build', 'off', 'of.It', 'forms', 'make', 'A-Team', 'hard', 'deny', 'genuine', 'are', 'tricks', 'flair', 'associated', 'movie', 'honesty', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'Humility', 'easy', 'underrate', 'make', 'mistake', 'difficult', 'come', 'blockbusters', 'late']",N/A

1310508,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B002ZG994U,Kathy W,"[87, 102]","The movie begins in Mexico, where Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson taking the part of George Peppard) is about to get a bullet in the head for bribing (obviously) the wrong cop.  B.A. Baracus (Quinton Jackson taking the part of Mr. T., complete with ""PITY"" and ""FOOL"" on his knuckles) is down the road a piece, fighting a bunch of dirtbags over his van.  Face (Bradley Cooper, taking the place of Dirk Benedict) is still the ladies' man.  As a matter of fact, he is wedged into several truck tires while some woman's husband is beating him in the face for boinking his wife.  Hannibal and BA arrive just in time to save Face from becoming toast.  Crazy-as-a-bed-bug Murdock is discovered in a hospital while they are getting BA stitched up.  All 4 guys are former Rangers so they bond big time.Murdock is still an unmatched pilot.  BA still has to be medicated to fly.  Hannibal still chomps a cigar.  And Face is still Face.  Right after they cross the border back into the USA, they get involved in trying to acquire some $100 counterfeit plates, being moved by Saddam loyalists from Bagdad, and, oh yeah, over $1 billion in cold phony bills.Much of this 2010 movie is filmed in beautiful Vancouver, Canada.  It's about 2 hours of action and comedy.  Steven Cannell is involved in the production, as with the popular series from the ""old"" days.  They kept the integrity of the oh-so-popular series with lots of action and lots of comedy.  There are tons of neat stunts, although some may be pretty close to impossible.  But what the heck--that's what makes a movie like this fun!  We have chopper and airplane stunt flying, action on a container ship, and the strategizing of perfectly timed plans, among other adventures the boys have.I absolutely loved the movie and will most definitely watch it again.  FYI, I do NOT remember any ""F"" type language, which is rare today--just lots of action and blow-em-up stuff.I LOVE IT when a movie comes together!Immediately after the credits, you will see a short cameo appearance of the former Face, Dirk Benedict.

I mean, I grew up with the series, had over the years bought all the boxsets, screamed & yelled to high heaven when that complete boxset was announced & released! Such is life! Anyway, with one of the original cast members not with us anymore, one only wondered if any of the surviving members would make some sort of contribution, albeit cameo roles!This film does not fail to entertain & given the benefit of two versions of the movie, what more can anyone ask for! There was the right amounts of action, thrills, comedy & yes, an appearance by the director also!To summarise the plot, though there is very little more I can say, the members come together in Mexico & become a well-tuned team, serve together for eight years & were about to leave Iran at the end of their tour of duty. Sounds simple enough, but, with the possiblity of ""sticking it"" to Saddam, they accept one last mission to get the money that he printed, the plates used & return them to the U.S.But nothing that simple ever goes right, their commanding officer is apparently killed, the A-Team is wrongfully accused, tried & convicted for the crime. Six months elapse & the C.I.A. agent instrumental in the fiasco prior to their incarceration, makes an offer to ""spring"" them & right the wrongs against them. That's when the mayhem insues!This movie was quite memorable in many ways & more so, as this was the last that Stephen J. Cannell produced prior to his passing. From the making of featurette, it looked that he greatly approved all the goings on & looked particularly happy at the time.Nonetheless, the series was great fun during which no one gets killed, though by the near end of the series, there were a few deaths & so does this movie.Great fun to kill a couple of hours, get it!",5,Don't compare the tv series with this!,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,2073,"['Simply', 'put', 'year', 'had', 'few', 'team', 'movies', 'refer', 'Losers', 'A-Team', 'Expendables', 'down', 'just', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'serious', 'awhile', 'diversion', 'had', 'reservations', 'originally', 'when', 'heard', 'first', 'set', 'news', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'A-team', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'mean', 'grew', 'up', 'series', 'had', 'years', 'bought', 'boxsets', 'screamed', 'yelled', 'high', 'heaven', 'when', 'complete', 'boxset', 'was', 'announced', 'released', 'Such', 'life', 'Anyway', 'one', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'not', 'anymore', 'one', 'only', 'wondered', 'surviving', 'members', 'would', 'make', 'sort', 'contribution', 'cameo', 'roles', 'film', 'not', 'fail', 'entertain', 'given', 'benefit', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'anyone', 'ask', 'was', 'right', 'amounts', 'action', 'thrills', 'comedy', 'yes', 'appearance', 'director', 'also', 'summarise', 'plot', 'very', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'members', 'come', 'together', 'Mexico', 'become', 'well-tuned', 'team', 'serve', 'together', 'eight', 'years', 'were', 'leave', 'Iran', 'end', 'tour', 'duty', 'simple', 'enough', 'possiblity', 'sticking', 'Saddam', 'accept', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'get', 'money', 'printed', 'plates', 'used', 'return', 'U.S.But', 'nothing', 'simple', 'ever', 'right', 'commanding', 'officer', 'apparently', 'killed', 'A-Team', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'tried', 'convicted', 'crime', 'Six', 'months', 'elapse', 'C.I.A', 'agent', 'instrumental', 'fiasco', 'prior', 'incarceration', 'offer', 'spring', 'right', 'wrongs', 'when', 'mayhem', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'memorable', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'last', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'produced', 'prior', 'passing', 'making', 'featurette', 'looked', 'greatly', 'approved', 'goings', 'looked', 'particularly', 'happy', 'time.Nonetheless', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'one', 'killed', 'near', 'end', 'series', 'were', 'few', 'deaths', 'so', 'movie.Great', 'fun', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours', 'get']",N/A

The TV show was done with tongue in cheek and a broad sense of humor.  I loved watching the crazy things they welded together to defeat the bad guys.  They were Team MacGyver.  There were fist fights and gun play but no one ever got hurt.  I never saw a TV bad guy killed.  It was just a big cartoon for adults.  But then Hollywood got involved and things went to hell.I was really looking forward to seeing the movie.  I couldn't wait to see my old friends on the big screen.  The trailers began to show up and I watch everyone several times.  Something about them didn't seem right, but I was still going to see the movie.  Well it came out and I was first in line and I saw it on the big screen and in stadium seats with the speakers blaring.  I sat there thorough out the movie with my mouth open and ear drums shaking.There were bombs, planes, helicopters, flying tanks,  Kissing!,  blood,  bodies??  And I was sad.  The old time A-Team was not there.  I agree that these actors were better, but they weren't right for this movie.  The child like fun was gone.  The laid backed sly jokes were gone.  Mr. T was a larger than life stero typed character but he had personality, the B.A on the screen was flat and ...... well I didn't care about him as person.  Face in the movie and Mad Dog came close to the charm of the old group but they too lack that personal warmth that made you like them as people.  Hannibal is the one character  that has to set the tone of the show or movie.  Peppard's smile was what set the tone in the TV A-Team and Neeson never got it right.The whole movie seemed over blown, over the top, trying too hard to go somewhere.  For the first time I felt I was beaten over the head by a movie.  I felt that the movie ws hitting me in the facd and saying,""Like me! Like me!""I think Hollywood did it to themselves with this movie because a few weeks before the LOSERS came out and it was the same basic idea with one tenth of the budget.  And do you know what[see my review of the LOSERS] it is a better movie by a landslide.The LOSERS didn't make money and the A-TEAM made money, but in my mind and heart the A-TEAM is the real LOSER!",2,You can't improve on campiness!,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,2215,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'campiness', 'word', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'done', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'broad', 'sense', 'humor', 'loved', 'watching', 'crazy', 'things', 'welded', 'together', 'defeat', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'Team', 'MacGyver', 'were', 'fist', 'fights', 'gun', 'play', 'one', 'ever', 'got', 'hurt', 'never', 'saw', 'TV', 'bad', 'guy', 'killed', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'cartoon', 'adults', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'involved', 'things', 'went', 'hell.I', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'old', 'friends', 'big', 'screen', 'trailers', 'began', 'show', 'up', 'watch', 'everyone', 'several', 'times', 'Something', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'first', 'line', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'stadium', 'seats', 'speakers', 'blaring', 'sat', 'movie', 'mouth', 'open', 'ear', 'drums', 'shaking.There', 'were', 'bombs', 'planes', 'helicopters', 'flying', 'tanks', 'Kissing', 'blood', 'bodies', 'was', 'sad', 'old', 'time', 'A-Team', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'agree', 'actors', 'were', 'better', 'were', ""n't"", 'right', 'movie', 'child', 'fun', 'was', 'gone', 'laid', 'backed', 'sly', 'jokes', 'were', 'gone', 'Mr.', 'T', 'was', 'larger', 'life', 'stero', 'typed', 'character', 'had', 'personality', 'B.A', 'screen', 'was', 'flat', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'person', 'Face', 'movie', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'came', 'close', 'charm', 'old', 'group', 'too', 'lack', 'personal', 'warmth', 'made', 'like', 'people', 'Hannibal', 'one', 'character', 'set', 'tone', 'show', 'movie', 'Peppard', 'smile', 'was', 'what', 'set', 'tone', 'TV', 'A-Team', 'Neeson', 'never', 'got', 'whole', 'movie', 'seemed', 'blown', 'top', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'go', 'somewhere', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'beaten', 'head', 'movie', 'felt', 'movie', 'ws', 'hitting', 'facd', 'saying', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'movie', 'few', 'weeks', 'LOSERS', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'same', 'basic', 'idea', 'one', 'tenth', 'budget', 'do', 'know', 'what', '[', 'see', 'review', 'LOSERS', ']', 'better', 'movie', 'landslide.The', 'LOSERS', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'money', 'A-TEAM', 'made', 'money', 'mind', 'heart', 'A-TEAM', 'real', 'LOSER']",N/A

I had agreed to bring my younger son to the movies that particular Saturday, and while this was the obvious choice for him (I-want-to-grow-up-and-fight-the-Daleks), and I don't imagine where he got that from, I truly didn't know what I was expecting. There have been so many wolves in sheep's clothing in the last few years, from unprocessed propaganda of the worst sort (Hurt Locker) to the weird and wonderful - far too many to mention - I kind of imagined this movie that we were about to see as being the equivalent of an hour or more of Newt Gingrich bawling and howling at the viewer through a megaphone to the tune of ""home of the free"".Or something.No, I was quite incorrect. This movie is EXCELLENT, in literally every way - a very clever and well crafted tale. Pure popcorn wonderment, the sort of thing that will provoke dads everywhere to whisper to their kids ""I remember DOING THIS stuff when you were, you know, too young to bring along"". The screen play works well, meaning by that the ideas weld well together visually, and you can really feel your way through it.Not to mean that it is exactly easy on the eye. I mean, some of the action is fairly extreme and it hurts to imagine it happening; but this is also a tribute to the excellent camerawork, more than that I can't say because I have never done outdoor stuff on what is obviously a huge scale, and they do it so well here.Special effects? I should say so. I really hold to the idea that the real special effects occur when you sense the gross injustice and the sheer boiling rage that lies just below the skin of these characters, but again, it works well, and the accompanying huge-things-flying-about bits are about on par; but you would have a good film without any of it.It's sad to now think that I never saw the original A-team TV series at all, but I reckon after this I will do so.By the way, what is this about the A-team appearing WITHIN the A-team? Watch and you will know what I mean. By the way, that particular little scene got a massive cheer from the rather excitable audience I went to see this with; that audience gradually morphed from a conventional mixture of Dads and kids to something like a crowd of drunken football fan rabble as the movie progressed, so you can imagine what the whole thing was like and how great it was to be there.What was it then?

This is remake/refresh of the TV series of the same name, focusing on a group of specially trained ops who are betrayed and need to clear their name. There are some lines and phrases that are nods to the TV series. The humor was surprisingly good in this picture. There's lots of action and some interesting twists though a few were easily predictable if that turns you off. Overall, I'd say this was a fun film though purists of the TV series may be disappointed. Jessica Biel has a supporting role. A comic book and IPhone app came off of this picture. This film received mixed reviews from critics and the original cast. More importantly, it cost $110M to make but the box office only yielded a bit over $177M.

I didn't enjoy the series too much, but I did enjoy this movie.  Its not often you see an action/adventure movie that at least tries to have a plot, but this one did.Starting in Mexico, we are introduced to John ""Hannibal"" Smith (Liam Neeson) who is being held hostage by police officers and we see just how resourceful he is.  He escapes and with the help of B.A. Baracus (Quinton Jackson) set out to free another member of his team Templeton ""Face"" Peck who is also being held by the corrupt Mexicans.  Along the way, they enlist the help of the slightly crazy H.M. Murdock (Sharlto Copley), an expert pilot.  Together, they outsmart the bad guys and go on to become a successful special ops team with the American Army.Not all goes as planned though.  When sent on a mission to recover some treasury plates, things go horribly awry and the team is wrongfully convicted when a general is murdered and the plates go missing.  They have to escape from jail and seek out the plates in order to restore their good names.  They have a lot of opposition however.  Despite being backed by CIA Agent Lynch (Patrick Wilson) they are pursued by the military and Face's former lover Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), and private security leader Brock Pike (Brian Bloom).  With a lot of adventure, explosion, and action, the team has to succeed as there is no plan B.I have to say, just knowing from popular culture about BA when played by Mr. T, Jackson just doesn't measure up to his character despite good acting.  Its a hard role to fill and they just didn't develop his character correctly.  The rest, from the little I know, did an ok job and I especially liked Face as a character.  He was just a bit more entertaining than the rest.  The bad guys weren't particularly menacing despite their guns and bombs.  Jessica Biel did so so in her role and I think they could have really expanded on her part and gave more depth to her character.This movie had some great action scenes.  While they were largely unbelievable from a logical standpoint (how they survived some of that stuff especially) it made for good entertainment and kept you at the edge of your seat.  There were of course lots of pretty explosions which always add to an action movie and quite a bit of gun fighting.  This could potentially be a violent movie for younger kids.The music in this was ok.  Nothing really stood out to me.  I do know that they used some of the original music tracks from the series.If you're looking for action this movie probably has enough.  Aside from some weak character development it was a pretty decent movie.  Grab some popcorn and enjoy!Review by M.

It was a guilty pleasure at best, but it was a little too corny for my taste. This upgrade to the big screen version does what any good upgrade ought to, it makes something OK much better. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and for the most part I think the casting was exceptional.....for the most part..yeah well, I think Jessica Biel is super hot and I can look at her endlessly, but she is miscast in a pivotal role in this film. Once again Hollywood must throw some contrived love story into a film that needs it like it needs realistic action sequences.Jessica isn't a bad actress(and she is gorgeous!), but she just can't carry the weight of her role in this film. Fortunately there is enough going on with over the top action and comedy to spare to distract from this glaring flaw. With a more appropriate type in the role, this film might have made it to 5 stars as a great escape action/comedy film. It is certainly worth seeing and I may just pick this up when the price is right. The DVD has a slick transfer and I would imagine the Blu Ray looks fantastic!Some of my Ammie buddies have expressed how much they liked the TV show. I really don't mean to trash the TV series, but by 1983, I was 21 years old and had already been playing in rock bands for 6 years. The A-Team was just a little after my time.

Transforming the series into a big-budget action fest finds our four heroes Hannibal (Liam Neeson), Face (Bradley Cooper), B.A. (UFC fighter Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson), and Murdock (District 9's Sharlto Copley) as soldiers who are double-crossed and set-up in Iraq.  Months later, they are re-united after some daring prison breaks, and put in the direction of those who left them disgraced.  For what The A-Team is, it isn't bad.  There are ample amounts of ridiculous action scenes, and the dialogue and interplay between the guys is what really makes the film worthwhile.  Other than that though, there isn't really much here to recommend.  Not to mention the fact that even the theatrical cut of the film feels like it's running way too long, and keeping track of the whole thing may prove more difficult than one may first guess.  Jessica Biel is on board as the ample eye-candy in the form of Face's ex-flame, while Watchmen's Patrick Wilson is here as a smarmy CIA spook.

Few made it to the big screen, and many thought the A-team would never get a full Hollywood production.  But it did, and it came out very well.  Featuring the same characters as the original show, though updated to take place in the decade of Operation Iraqi Freedom, this movie is full of plot twists, character twists, gunfights, fistfights, ludicrous dialog, ridiculous action scenes, and all of the familiar hallmarks of the TV series, except overblown in every way possible.  The casting was spot on for all the members of the team, along with all the villains of the movie.  Clocking in at just around two hours in length, the movie has several climatic action scenes, hence moving the story along at a brisk pace.  Who are the villains in the movie?  Well, they are a combination of all the villains of the TV serial; drug lords, rogue military brass, the CIA, private military contractors, etc...  Overall, a great movie worth multiple viewings.

We used to herald the mindless summer blockbuster back when the explosions were fire and not CG, when Bruce Willis was all you needed to make a movie great, and an excellent plot was something you only expected to find in dramas filled with stuffy British accents. Yes, the majority of film has always sucked but we didn't care because we weren't paying $12.50 to see what's being shuffled down our throats today. As indie film has taken over the mutliplexs, the only escape we have to someplace fun is through stuff with Shia Lebouf in it. Disgrace, I tell you! But not all is lost. We have people like Joe Carnahan who still know how to make a night at the movies a blast.Now, the critics panned this movie because it's short on plot and way too loud. Dude, it's based on The A-Team. The A-Team was a show about fast and violent missions with Mr. T preferring not to fly and Hannibal loving when a plan comes together. You didn't watch The A-Team for MASH, you watched it because it was cool. And that's exactly what this movie is. Cool. It's a thrill ride from the very beginning to the very end and not a lot of movies can deliver on that promise. Some twists are predictable and you're satisfied when you see it coming. Some are not and you're satisfied because you're surprised. I don't want to spoil anything about the story but the basic plot is all you really need. This movie is a video game in that you first get the reason to want to shoot things and then all you want to know next is where to get the ammo. It's loud and shaky, as is the trend with today's action movies, but not obnoxious like that other ""we were framed and now we're super mad about it.

But if Joe Carnahan  was actually going to deliver on a big screen adaptation of this iconic 80's series, he could have at least had the decency to get key elements right.First, they needed to have yes, been set back in time as Vietnam veterans. It probably seems weird and even inconsequential to some other people who also viewed the film. But when this series premiered, America was just beginning to recognize that the military does create psychological problems for soldiers/veterans, which the TV screenplay deftly capitalized on.The movie does not work portraying them as being involved with current wars--the 'edge' to the franchise characters gets lost. Ditto for being part of an elite team/government insiders.They are good guys, but they are also still supposed to be 'kooky' and not the everyday average type, from their having been in the military. They go underground and as a result of being framed and that resultant kookiness, start their own covert organization essentially the whole plot of the series. They are not supposed to be in tandem with the government!An entirely different movie should have been drawn up if people could not have been bothered to follow the original plotline when they were trying to execute a 'tribute'.I get the whole concept of using different actors, yes the originals--even Mr. T, were graying. But keeping the plotline is important. Otherwise call the movie something else entirely new and different.And then they are the type of kooks who do not go around killing people. The A-Team of the 80's was front loaded with more cheese than the Kraft factory. But somehow amidst all of the explosions and other plans, people never died. It was a live action GI Joe cartoon for the entire family to just sitback and enjoy.Not here in the movie. Body counts get racked up. Rather than already showing the ATeam already set up and going out on a mission, the scripting took considerable liberties. We did not need this--nor want it. It was unnecessary to the plotline.Another problem is the presence of sexual activity. This adds in another noticeable element which definitely was not in the original TV series. And even though I and other kids who grew up with Mr. T and the gang are now adults, this ruins our fun. It's like discovering that Santa Claus was really your parents all along. A part of our childhood is gone.There certainly are current films where such elements would be appropriate, but the A-Team was not one of them.",1,I Hate It When My Childhood Is Sabatoged,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2533,"['A-Team', 'was', ""n't"", 'shakespearian', 'theater', 'begin', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'deliver', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'iconic', '80', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'had', 'decency', 'get', 'key', 'elements', 'right.First', 'needed', 'have', 'yes', 'been', 'set', 'back', 'time', 'Vietnam', 'veterans', 'probably', 'weird', 'even', 'inconsequential', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'also', 'viewed', 'film', 'when', 'series', 'premiered', 'America', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'recognize', 'military', 'create', 'psychological', 'problems', 'soldiers/veterans', 'TV', 'screenplay', 'deftly', 'capitalized', 'on.The', 'movie', 'not', 'work', 'portraying', 'being', 'involved', 'current', 'wars', ""'edge"", 'franchise', 'characters', 'lost', 'Ditto', 'being', 'part', 'elite', 'team/government', 'insiders.They', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'also', 'still', 'supposed', 'be', ""'kooky"", 'not', 'everyday', 'average', 'type', 'having', 'been', 'military', 'go', 'underground', 'result', 'being', 'framed', 'resultant', 'kookiness', 'start', 'own', 'covert', 'organization', 'essentially', 'whole', 'plot', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'tandem', 'government', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'up', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'bothered', 'follow', 'original', 'plotline', 'when', 'were', 'trying', 'execute', ""'tribute'.I"", 'get', 'whole', 'concept', 'using', 'different', 'actors', 'originals', 'even', 'Mr.', 'T', 'were', 'graying', 'keeping', 'plotline', 'important', 'Otherwise', 'call', 'movie', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'new', 'different.And', 'then', 'are', 'type', 'kooks', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'killing', 'people', 'A-Team', '80', 'was', 'front', 'loaded', 'more', 'cheese', 'Kraft', 'factory', 'somehow', 'explosions', 'other', 'plans', 'people', 'never', 'died', 'was', 'live', 'action', 'GI', 'Joe', 'cartoon', 'entire', 'family', 'just', 'sitback', 'enjoy.Not', 'here', 'movie', 'Body', 'get', 'racked', 'up', 'Rather', 'already', 'showing', 'ATeam', 'already', 'set', 'up', 'going', 'out', 'mission', 'scripting', 'took', 'considerable', 'liberties', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'want', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'plotline.Another', 'problem', 'presence', 'sexual', 'activity', 'noticeable', 'element', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'even', 'other', 'kids', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Mr.', 'T', 'gang', 'are', 'now', 'adults', 'fun', 'discovering', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'was', 'really', 'parents', 'along', 'part', 'childhood', 'gone.There', 'certainly', 'are', 'current', 'films', 'where', 'such', 'elements', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'A-Team', 'was', 'not', 'one']",N/A

Their latest mission backfires and counterfeit money plates are stolen by a rival mercenary team. Hannibal and his ""A-Team"" are framed and sent to prison. But high security prisons, mercenaries, and traitors are no match for this team that specializes in the crazy and impossible.The A-Team, based on the legendary 80's television show are played by Liam Neeson (Hannibal), Bradley Cooper (Face), Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson (B.A.), and Sharlto Copley (Murdock). Neeson plays every role to perfection, and this is no exception. Hannibal is the man who always has a plan, brilliant and a bit crazy. Speaking of crazy, Murdock is certifiably insane, but an ace pilot and the team's constant comic relief. Copley does a wonderful job of acting like he should be committed. Cooper is Faceman aka Templeton Peck - the pretty boy, master of disguise and master of manipulation. There's a bit of craziness to him as well, but we get to see a deeper side of him when his former love (played by Jessica Biel) is on their trail. And Jackson gets to play the iconic character of B.A. Baracus - the tough as nails former Airborne Army Ranger who becomes afraid of flying.With over-the-top action, incredible stunts, and impossible situations, The A-Team is much like the original series - if the original series were allowed to actually shoot people. All of the fun-loving spirit, adventure, and comedy from before with a re-vamp of fantastic characters and a fun (if somewhat predictable) story.

At the start of the film each of the four characters play a flat role: brains, brawn, ladies man, and the crazy one. The moment that the plan fails to come together and gets blown up (literally) in their faces the real humanity and more complex characterization is revealed. Some of that added characterization made little sense, for example, prison making Baracus ""soft"" and his hissy fit over his smashed up car along with needing to be drugged to get on a plane with Murdock. The plane thing kept reminding me of Cameron Diaz in Knight and Day and if you can compare the toughness between Quintin Rampage Jackson and Cameron Diaz then there is something very wrong going on.Smith (Neeson), Murdock (Copley), and Sosa (Biel) were my favorites but all the other actors did an amazing job. There was a bit of a tradeoff between plausible and impossible action scenes but it all made for exciting viewing and didn't lack in the explosion department.

Most of the action in this film is pure fantasy, but the explosions, stunts, one liners and execution more than makes up for this.Following the gulf war the A-Team have to recover some stolen money minting plates and clear their name after they are framed for a murder and the original theft of said plates.  You see how they track down their enemy and how they are double crossed and betrayed by those they have had to trust.  Pretty much your standard action film fare.Liam Neeson has the most ridiculous accent going, but if you can not let this annoy you too much you should be ok.  Bradley Cooper is a credible Face and manages to be reminiscent of the TV series character whilst bringing his own style to the role.  This also applies to Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson who plays BA Baracus.  The gold jewellery is missing, but the same attitude is there.  My favourite has to be Murdoch who manages to come out with some hilarious lines and stops the film from taking itself too seriously.  His impression of Mel Gibson in Braveheart had me howling!This film also offers plenty of their trademark DIY adaptations and gadgets, as well as a brief appearance from the black and red GMC.This is a perfectly enjoyable action film and as long as you don't compare it to the original TV series, or take the stunts or credibility of the action too seriously, you can enjoy this for it's duration.

1310585,A2LDBZRI5GQ4N,B002ZG994U,Tech Guy,"[0, 0]","It is worth checking out if you are a fan of the T.V. show. There are some things that were changed from the original T.V. show to make it modern; in the original T.V. show, they were Vietnam vets charged with a crime that they didn't commit, they broke out of a military prison and lived in the underground world to help ordinary people with problems that no one could help them with.In the movie ""The A-Team"", it kind of follows the T.V. show except that instead of being Vietnam vets, they are Desert Storm 2 vets (Iraq Vets), and in Iraq they work undercover to get $100 Billion dollars worth of Treasury plates so that American money could not be counterfeited; it turns out that the American government gave them to the Shah of Iran and after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, they went missing and now they believe that the insurgents would counterfeit the money to pay off people to join the raging insurgency, and now they think that they know where they are, and now it is the A-Team's job to get them back.Once they get them back, they are set-up by a shady group of people; the leader is a guy who tells them that he works for the CIA, but it turns out that once the job is done and they are framed, he goes in hiding. No one can find him. The A-Team is disbanded and they are charged with murder of a superior officer and all four of them are sent to different super-maximum military prisons and all four of them are each given life sentences (Murdoch is sent to a mental hospital for the criminally insane).Eventually, they all escape and get back together to find out who framed them, and now it is off to find the real culprit of the crime, and to find out who the mysterious man was who ""working"" for the CIA.Now, what makes this movie is not just the action, it is the characters. B.A. Baracus, Face, Hannibal, and Murdoch. B.A. Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson) does a pretty good job of playing B.A.; the attitude and everything; including his fear of flying and having to be knocked out before the flight begins, but no one can top Mr. T. He (Mr. T) did the character SO WELL in the original T.V. series he was pretty much remembered as B.A.Face (Bradley Cooper) really pulled out the stops as Face. He is charming, a womanizer, and basically everything that Face was in the original T.V. series and more. He flirts with just about every woman and usually get's his way all the time.Murdoch (Sharlto Copley) wow, this guy (like Mr. Cooper) really pulled out ALL the stops for Murdoch. For people that remember Murdoch from the T.V. show remember how CRAZY the character was and some of the CRAZY stuff he did on the show, he does it in this movie also; from flying a helicopter BEYOND the limits of not only physics, but also logic while keeping a ""calm"" attitude about it. Also, Murdoch is known for portraying people (living mostly) and pretends to know what he is doing; in this movie, he actually portrays a doctor trying to stitch up B.A. Baracus after he got shot....classic Murdoch.Hannibal (Liam Neeson) Again, I felt that Liam did a really good job doing Hannibal; from the cigar-smoking to just about everything that people remember him from the T.V. show, Liam does it pretty much dead on and even some lines from the original T.V. show ""I love it when a plan comes together"".Aside from the really cool action scenes, the excellent acting from all four of the A-Team guys, if you are a fan of the T.V. series, it is worth buying, or if you never watched or were too young to remember the T.V. show, it is worth a rental without having seen the T.V. show (if you haven't seen the T.V. show, I would watch the pilot episode and a couple of more after that, than watch the movie...again, this is just to find out about the characters, it's not mandatory, but it helps).Happy Shopping!",5,If You Are A Fan Of The Original T.V Show...,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,3818,"['worth', 'checking', 'out', 'are', 'fan', 'T.V', 'show', 'are', 'things', 'were', 'changed', 'original', 'T.V', 'show', 'make', 'modern', 'original', 'T.V', 'show', 'were', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'charged', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'broke', 'military', 'prison', 'lived', 'underground', 'world', 'help', 'ordinary', 'people', 'problems', 'one', 'could', 'help', 'with.In', 'movie', 'A-Team', 'kind', 'T.V', 'show', 'instead', 'being', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'are', 'Desert', 'Storm', '2', 'vets', 'Iraq', 'Vets', 'Iraq', 'work', 'undercover', 'get', '100', 'Billion', 'dollars', 'worth', 'Treasury', 'plates', 'so', 'American', 'money', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'counterfeited', 'out', 'American', 'government', 'gave', 'Shah', 'Iran', '1979', 'Islamic', 'Revolution', 'Iran', 'went', 'missing', 'now', 'believe', 'insurgents', 'would', 'counterfeit', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'people', 'join', 'raging', 'insurgency', 'now', 'think', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'A-Team', 'job', 'get', 'back.Once', 'get', 'back', 'are', 'set-up', 'shady', 'group', 'people', 'leader', 'guy', 'who', 'CIA', 'out', 'once', 'job', 'done', 'are', 'framed', 'hiding', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'A-Team', 'disbanded', 'are', 'charged', 'murder', 'superior', 'officer', 'four', 'are', 'sent', 'different', 'super-maximum', 'military', 'prisons', 'four', 'are', 'given', 'life', 'sentences', 'Murdoch', 'sent', 'mental', 'hospital', 'criminally', 'insane', '.Eventually', 'escape', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'framed', 'now', 'find', 'real', 'culprit', 'crime', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'mysterious', 'man', 'was', 'who', 'working', 'CIA.Now', 'what', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'action', 'characters', 'B.A', 'Baracus', 'Face', 'Hannibal', 'Murdoch', 'B.A', 'Baracus', 'Quinton', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'B.A', 'attitude', 'everything', 'including', 'fear', 'flying', 'having', 'be', 'knocked', 'out', 'flight', 'one', 'can', 'top', 'Mr.', 'T.', 'Mr.', 'T', 'did', 'character', 'SO', 'WELL', 'original', 'T.V', 'series', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'remembered', 'B.A.Face', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'really', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'Face', 'charming', 'womanizer', 'basically', 'everything', 'Face', 'was', 'original', 'T.V', 'series', 'more', 'just', 'woman', 'usually', 'get', 'way', 'time.Murdoch', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'wow', 'guy', 'Mr.', 'Cooper', 'really', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'Murdoch', 'people', 'remember', 'Murdoch', 'T.V', 'show', 'remember', 'how', 'CRAZY', 'character', 'was', 'CRAZY', 'stuff', 'did', 'show', 'movie', 'also', 'flying', 'helicopter', 'limits', 'not', 'only', 'physics', 'also', 'logic', 'keeping', 'calm', 'attitude', 'Also', 'Murdoch', 'known', 'portraying', 'people', 'living', 'mostly', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'movie', 'actually', 'doctor', 'trying', 'stitch', 'up', 'B.A', 'Baracus', 'got', 'shot', '.classic', 'Murdoch.Hannibal', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Again', 'felt', 'Liam', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'doing', 'Hannibal', 'cigar-smoking', 'just', 'everything', 'people', 'remember', 'T.V', 'show', 'Liam', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'even', 'lines', 'original', 'T.V', 'show', 'love', 'when', 'plan', 'together', '.Aside', 'really', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'acting', 'four', 'A-Team', 'guys', 'are', 'fan', 'T.V', 'series', 'worth', 'buying', 'never', 'watched', 'were', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'T.V', 'show', 'rental', 'having', 'seen', 'T.V', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'T.V', 'show', 'would', 'watch', 'pilot', 'episode', 'couple', 'more', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'characters', 'not', 'mandatory', '.Happy', 'Shopping']",N/A

Do not compare this movie to the original show, but then you say""The cast, in my opinion, is dead on and makes every character portray the original cast from the TV show. There are some great catch phrases in the movie that make it fun. There is a lot of CGI in the movie but it is done quite well and makes the action sequences feel as if they were pretty darned close to real. ""So you compared them to the original right out of the box. Oh course people are going to compare them to the original. Most of the characters were good matches, but NOT Mr. T. The action scenes while heavy on the blowing things up, were beyond fake. And then the commentary during the action was just as bad. I will only give one example:when the team gets their plane shot down and they jump into the tank. Face says it is stuffy boss I am going to open a window. He opens the hatch of the tank and starts firing at predator drones. Then because they are falling to earth and going to die, they start to fire the main gun to get to a lake. Okay, while yes this does move the tank, Hannibal said it was 16 miles away! Then the poor acting continues, so the military base can see they are firing the main gun and say are they trying to shot the drone with the main gun? Then the woman says No they are trying to fly the tank. Not to mention their helicopter scene that avoids two missiles.ARE YOU SERIOUS!I completely agree with the other reviewer who said this movie is not based on any form of reality.

We follow the A Team as they promptly escape, so the Team goes out to clear their name and find out who really took the Plates and set them up as the fall guys, throw in Jessica Beal as Face's former old flame who is after them and CIA guy Lynch, some wild action sequences, comedy, nostalgia (light on the nostalgia which was good, there were a few good odes to the TV show but for the most part filmmakers and actors kept the spirit TV show in the movie) Ok so some action scenes were they plausible? Probably not, But watching Faceman firing a .50 Cal machine gun mounted on a Tank free falling some 20,000 feet at a Drone Predator is pretty damn kick ass! This is the A Team!! Which makes it fun!The whole cast was great, of course growing up my favorite was Murdoch, I think it's a given everyone loved Murdoch and Sharlto Copely (District 9) did a wonderful job as the crazy man and Rampage Jackson as BA, good job for a guy who never acted, I am sure he picked Liam's Brain for some tips, Cooper with those damn good looks any guy would want as Faceman had the perfect charm, ladies man, and can kick ass, then Liam as the stoic, the brains, leader Hannibal who doesn't like Liam, all around great acting from this group I left the theater thoroughly happy with a smile on my face, will pick this up when it is released.",5,"If you have a problem and if no one else can help if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A Team!",1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,2485,"['was', 'one', 'highlights', 'Summer', 'movies', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', '2010', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Hannibal', 'Smith', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Faceman', 'Quinton', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'BA', 'Baracus', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'Howling', 'Mad', 'Murdoch.The', 'movie', 'one', 'longest', ""prologue's/"", 'Intro', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'had', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'watching', 'see', 'how', 'Team', 'put', 'together', 'Mexico', 'nice', 'action', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'then', 'que', 'iconic', 'theme', 'music', 'gave', 'goosebumps', 'felt', 'kid', 'again', 'watching', 'TV', 'show', 'fast', 'forward', '8', 'years', 'later', 'team', 'become', 'well', 'oiled', 'seasoned', 'crack', 'commando', 'unit', 'are', 'Iraq', 'where', 'A', 'Team', 'together', 'doing', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'given', 'CIA', 'Man', 'John', 'Lynch', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'retrieve', 'counterfeit', 'U.S', 'Treasury', 'Iraqi', 'Insurgents', 'have', 'are', 'moving', 'heavily', 'armored', 'convoy', 'get', 'pretty', 'cool', 'action', 'sequence', 'Team', 'plates', 'then', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'accused', 'stealing', 'plates', 'are', 'then', 'sentenced', 'separately', 'going', 'different', 'Maximum', 'Security', 'Prison', 'follow', 'A', 'Team', 'promptly', 'escape', 'Team', 'out', 'clear', 'name', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'took', 'Plates', 'set', 'up', 'fall', 'guys', 'throw', 'Jessica', 'Beal', 'Face', 'former', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'CIA', 'guy', 'Lynch', 'wild', 'action', 'sequences', 'comedy', 'nostalgia', 'light', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'odes', 'TV', 'show', 'most', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'kept', 'spirit', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'Ok', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'plausible', 'Probably', 'not', 'watching', 'Faceman', 'firing', '.50', 'Cal', 'machine', 'gun', 'mounted', 'Tank', 'free', 'falling', '20,000', 'feet', 'Drone', 'Predator', 'pretty', 'damn', 'kick', 'ass', 'A', 'Team', 'Which', 'fun', 'whole', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'course', 'growing', 'up', 'favorite', 'was', 'Murdoch', 'think', 'given', 'everyone', 'loved', 'Murdoch', 'Sharlto', 'Copely', 'District', '9', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'crazy', 'man', 'Rampage', 'Jackson', 'BA', 'good', 'job', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'acted', 'am', 'sure', 'picked', 'Liam', 'Brain', 'tips', 'Cooper', 'damn', 'good', 'looks', 'guy', 'would', 'want', 'Faceman', 'had', 'perfect', 'charm', 'man', 'can', 'kick', 'ass', 'then', 'Liam', 'stoic', 'brains', 'leader', 'Hannibal', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'Liam', 'around', 'great', 'acting', 'group', 'left', 'theater', 'thoroughly', 'happy', 'smile', 'face', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'when', 'released']",N/A

Now on to my review.----------------------------------------***Brief Review***This film is definitely action packed and delivers some laughs.  But, are the characters as loveable as the ones from the tv series?  No.Story wise this is pretty simple, just like the tv series.  Soldiers framed for a crime they didn't commit, (Check), breaking out and try to prove their innocence, with guns, (Check).The biggest flaw (and strength) however is the action.  I mean come on, flying a tank?  I love outrageous action as much as the next guy, but leave a little believeably in there.Is this own-worthy?  Only if your a die-hard 'A-Team' fan.  Otherwise I would just wait for it to come on the channel 'FX'.Will there be sequel?  No.  I far as I know there is no plans for any sequel.  This appears to be a one shot deal.  Also I don't see all the actors coming back for a sequel anyway.  Also I think it was a box office flop, so to speak.If you are still interested.  Check the bargain bin at Wal-Mart or FYE, you may find this title for 5 bucks.  But pay no more for it.Hope this helps.

The A-Team forms in Mexico where their vacation activities include getting tied up, being beaten in the face, and loving it. After the team is formed and Mexico ravaged, we flash 8 years to the future where they are in Iraq. There are some missing counterfeit printing plates that the US government wants. The CIA, Black Forest (Black Water), the regular army, and the A-Team all go after the same plates (actually all it would have taken was one predator drone) and they are in competition with each other to get the plates as opposed to working together.The A-Team recovers the plates, however in a mishap they are stolen and the A-Team all go to jail. Later, the CIA wanting to recover the plates aids the A-Team in escaping from prison. Working as fugitives, our Team goes after the plates having to battle various factions.The movie is action filled. The dialouge is crisp and fun.

Those of you who are also hardcore A-team fans know there's been a lot of rumors through the years.When this one came out, I was not eager to watch it. In fact, it took me all the way up until September 2012 to watch it and the reason was because of course I wanted original actors (or as many as there could be) and I really didn't have much confidence in these actors. I was immediately reassured when I saw Stephen J. Cannell's (RIP) name in the opening credits as a co-writer.I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The cast was spot on except for one, and that was Hanibal's character. I know Liam Neeson is a great actor but he just didn't make a good Hanibal. Hanibal is a more calm, laid back and collected cat. He's almost effortless when he's working. I just didn't see that here.The others were great. Especially B.A.s character. Although what's up with all this ""Bosco"" stuff. His name is B.A. Not Bosco! And where's the gold?I have long wondered how they would do an A-Team movie. I mean... just an episode takes up nearly an hour and that's only one case. It'd be pretty boring if it was just one case handled in the movie but it wasn't. It was wall to wall action from start to finish. It was very suspenseful and exciting. It wasn't the same original story as the original A-team but heck, it's been 30 years, I'll cut them some slack on swapping out wars.This was a very good movie and I'd love a sequel.Just one little fun fact... wait until the very end of the credits for a nice little surprise that original A-Team fans will really like.

A big, broad, messy love letter of a movie to the TV show ""The A-Team"" may be a narrative mess but it is entertaining and it's just like watching a tank crash...a car crash. Directed and co-written by Joe Carnahan (""Narc"", ""Smokin' Aces""), ""The A-Team"" works primarily because of the charm of the cast and the non-stop action.When Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson)and his group of U.S. Special Forces Airborne Rangers -""Face"" (Bradley Cooper), ""B.A."" (Quinton Jackson) and Murdock (Sharlto Copley of ""District 9"")are framed for stealing conterfeit plates in Iraq all four are court martialed and thrown into prison. The four find an unlikely ally in a rogue CIA agent named Lynch (Patrick Wilson)who helps them break out of prison to locate the plates and the man who stole them--Pike (Brian Bloom). The A-Team has to stay ahead of Face's former girlfriend Lt. Sosa (Jessica Biel)who with her team are hot on the trial of the team but suspects that they are innocent. The team must figure out where Pike is and the plates in order to exonerate themselves. Watch for an entertaining cameo from Jon Ham (""Madmen"") at the conclusion of the film and the marvelous character actor Henry Czerny (""Mission: Impossible"") who needs to be utilized better by Hollywood as he's a terrific character actor.The main flaw with the film is that the writers and director have to set up the entire premise AND break them out, resolve who framed them and keep it moving/entertaining the entire two hours. It's a daunting task and I'd never accuse someone of trying to stuff too much plot into a movie but with this much action it's very very difficult to try and set up action set pieces, develop characters and resolve a convoluted plot in one movie. If there had been a guarantee of a sequel they might have been able to carry their search for who set them up for other films and allowed a bit more breathing room for the plot.The Blu-ray for ""The A-Team"" looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer and plenty of extras that include ""Inside the Action"" The Devil is in The Details"" a commentary featuring the director who discloses everything from the fact that the scene involving the military city was built in a bit where they were in the process of building a Walmart to the use of CGI to remove moths from a scene that were circling around the bright lights. Periodically the audio commentary becomes a PIP with the director appearing along with animatics and/or behind-the-scenes footage.We also get a visual effects reel with before and after images and commentary. Deleted scenes are included as well as a gag reel for the film. There are some other featurettes that are included as well.""The A-Team"" is a big, messy, explosive and entertaining flick even if the narrative sometimes gets lost in all the action. The big pay off at the end of the film works quite well. Although ""The A-Team"" may not have done well at the box office due to negative reviews, the film is bound to do well on home video with enough curious fans renting or buying the flick.

I just checked out the new A-Team movie today, and I must say I was impressed...The acting was great, and the voices from the movie characters sounded like the old tv show character voices from the past...as well as the characters playing very similar roles to the roles they played in the old tv show(meaning they didn't stray too much, if any from the old tv show persona's).  The story line was well done... Kind of a prequel to the old tv show... a lot of movies are going that way these days...The movie had plenty of action...a few things a little far-fetched, but remember this is the A-team were talking about... if you have ever seen the old tv show, you will understand...The movie also had some funny parts... face was great, even though he was more on the serious side at times, then the former face(dirk benedict)  who was in the old tv show...Murdock was goofy, but that is exactly how murdock should be...Hannibal was perfect!B.A. was pretty good too... though didn't have the same intensity as Mr. T...Overall, I would say the movie was a success and will be popular... I'm guessing there will be a 2nd installment to the movie or maybe even a modern day tv show...I just hope they don't wait 2 or more years to make another movie, like a lot of film companies do...Go & see the movie, you will be entertained whether you saw the old show or not...Thanks...",5,new A-Team movie a hit!!!,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,1398,"['Okay', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'just', 'checked', 'out', 'new', 'A-Team', 'movie', 'today', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'voices', 'movie', 'characters', 'sounded', 'old', 'tv', 'show', 'character', 'voices', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'playing', 'very', 'similar', 'roles', 'roles', 'played', 'old', 'tv', 'show', 'meaning', 'did', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'much', 'old', 'tv', 'show', 'persona', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'Kind', 'prequel', 'old', 'tv', 'show', 'lot', 'movies', 'are', 'going', 'way', 'days', 'movie', 'had', 'plenty', 'action', 'few', 'things', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'remember', 'A-team', 'were', 'talking', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'old', 'tv', 'show', 'will', 'understand', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'funny', 'parts', 'face', 'was', 'great', 'even', 'was', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'times', 'then', 'former', 'face', 'dirk', 'benedict', 'who', 'was', 'old', 'tv', 'show', 'Murdock', 'was', 'goofy', 'exactly', 'how', 'murdock', 'should', 'be', 'Hannibal', 'was', 'perfect', 'B.A', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'intensity', 'Mr', 'T', 'Overall', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'success', 'will', 'be', 'popular', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'will', 'be', '2nd', 'installment', 'movie', 'maybe', 'even', 'modern', 'day', 'tv', 'show', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', '2', 'more', 'years', 'make', 'movie', 'lot', 'film', 'companies', 'do', 'Go', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'saw', 'old', 'show', 'not', 'Thanks']",N/A

The screenplay by Director Joe Carnahan, Brian Bloom who also plays the main villain and Skip Woods enhances the television characters to the point where you wish you were part of their team. Courage, honor and loyalty are part of their personalities and the superb walk through the park acting by the four characters make this film an absolute joy to watch.  You can even forgive the overdone CGI eye candy because the action and intrigue jell perfectly. I never saw it theatrically so I am going by the unrated extended cut included on this DVD and let me tell you, there is not a wasted moment.  The writers also give the cliched female character played excellently by Jessica Biel some substance and Alan Silvestri peppers the Main theme from the original series throughout the music score.
