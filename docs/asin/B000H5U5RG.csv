With insight and sensitivity, Greene conveys the inner compulsions and emotional turbulence of his character with dead-on authenticity. Kerrigan's innovative use of sound--radio transmissions and white noise--and tight control over the reality of Peter's delusions (are they ours or his?) keeps the question of his guilt suspended until the very end.

1009759,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000H5U5RG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 4]","Few movies I've seen recently have left me in the same state of shock and awe that Clean, Shaven has. That's not to say it's a masterpiece of cinema or one of my favorite films or even that it's worthy of 5 stars. But it is a fascinating character study that is very effective and unsettling. I first heard of the film via The Criterion Collection website. I didn't read too much into it, but what I did hear was intriguing enough for me to want to see it. One big factor was reviewers who compared it to two of my favorite movies Spider and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. This film and those two have similarities, but I found those films more entertaining, more effective, and creepier than this one. This movie does, however, have moments where it will flawlessly mess with your head. Peter Greene (an actor that's probably best recognized as Zed from Pulp Fiction) plays Peter Winter, a man with Schizophrenia. Instead of presenting us with a straightforward narrative, writer/director/producer Lodge Kerrigan takes a different route. By the end of the film, we're not sure what's real and what exists only in the mind of the main character. To say the film has a plot would be inaccurate, although elements of it combine to form a sort-of plot. The movie begins by establishing its mood and form of storytelling. Strange disconnected sounds play on the soundtrack, while Peter freaks out in the corner of a cell. In the next scene, we see what directions this movie is going to take. Peter sits in his car, when a young girl appears in front of it. He gets out of the car and on the soundtrack what appears to be him beating her and the sounds of her screaming. Whether this actually occurs, or not, is never made clear. In the next scene, Peter (while driving) begins inexplicably taping newspaper to the windows of the car and putting tape over the rearview mirror. The basic plot is that Peter is looking for his daughter Nicole. Her mother is dead and she was left to be raised by her grandma, who gave her up for adoption. Meanwhile, a detective is looking for the murderer of a young girl. He's fascinated with the case, since the young girl was found lying a field in a dress that has no evidence of blood or anything else on it. The movie will not appeal to many viewers. It moves at a slow snail-pace in many scenes, which will cause the average viewer to turn it off. I kept thinking that if Vincent Gallo had an inspiration for the way The Brown Bunny was made, he probably used this film. Although, I need to add that, most viewers will find this movie more endurable than that one. One of the things that amazed me a lot about this movie was Peter Greene. I've seen him in Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and The Mask but the man is, overall, an obsolete actor. Here he proves that he's very talented and has a lot of range. I'm surprised this film didn't lead him to more fruitful roles. I see a lot of movies and few of them, even the great ones, I want to watch again right away. This film was a movie I wanted to see again as soon as it was over. Not because I found it very entertaining, but because I don't think I was prepared for all the things it serves to you. This is definitely a movie people should check out.GRADE: B+",4,Unforgettable,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,3256,"['Few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'have', 'left', 'same', 'state', 'shock', 'awe', 'Clean', 'Shaven', 'not', 'say', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'even', 'worthy', '5', 'stars', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'very', 'effective', 'unsettling', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'website', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'did', 'hear', 'was', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'want', 'see', 'One', 'big', 'factor', 'was', 'reviewers', 'who', 'compared', 'two', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Spider', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'film', 'two', 'have', 'similarities', 'found', 'films', 'more', 'entertaining', 'more', 'effective', 'creepier', 'one', 'movie', 'however', 'have', 'moments', 'where', 'will', 'flawlessly', 'mess', 'head', 'Peter', 'Greene', 'actor', 'probably', 'best', 'recognized', 'Zed', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Peter', 'Winter', 'man', 'Schizophrenia', 'Instead', 'presenting', 'straightforward', 'narrative', 'writer/director/producer', 'Lodge', 'Kerrigan', 'different', 'route', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'only', 'mind', 'main', 'character', 'say', 'film', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'elements', 'form', 'sort-of', 'plot', 'movie', 'establishing', 'mood', 'form', 'storytelling', 'Strange', 'disconnected', 'sounds', 'play', 'soundtrack', 'Peter', 'out', 'corner', 'cell', 'next', 'scene', 'see', 'what', 'movie', 'going', 'take', 'Peter', 'car', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'front', 'car', 'soundtrack', 'what', 'be', 'beating', 'sounds', 'screaming', 'actually', 'not', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'next', 'scene', 'Peter', 'driving', 'inexplicably', 'taping', 'newspaper', 'windows', 'car', 'putting', 'tape', 'rearview', 'mirror', 'basic', 'plot', 'Peter', 'looking', 'daughter', 'Nicole', 'mother', 'dead', 'was', 'left', 'be', 'raised', 'grandma', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'Meanwhile', 'detective', 'looking', 'murderer', 'young', 'girl', 'fascinated', 'case', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'found', 'lying', 'field', 'dress', 'evidence', 'blood', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'many', 'viewers', 'slow', 'snail-pace', 'many', 'scenes', 'will', 'cause', 'average', 'viewer', 'turn', 'off', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'had', 'inspiration', 'way', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'was', 'made', 'probably', 'used', 'film', 'need', 'add', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'more', 'endurable', 'one', 'One', 'things', 'amazed', 'lot', 'movie', 'was', 'Peter', 'Greene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Mask', 'man', 'overall', 'obsolete', 'actor', 'Here', 'very', 'talented', 'lot', 'range', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'lead', 'more', 'fruitful', 'roles', 'see', 'lot', 'movies', 'few', 'even', 'great', 'ones', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'right', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'over', 'Not', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'prepared', 'things', 'definitely', 'movie', 'people', 'should', 'check', 'out.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
1009760,A3SIRH8JWGYU80,B000H5U5RG,Kevin W. Koehler,"[3, 3]","""I Can Help Make the Dream That Obsesses You Come True Quickly."" So reads a newspaper advertisement, spread across a schizophrenic man's car window. Every glass surface on the vehicle, including rear and side-view mirrors, is covered in crumpled paper torn from a tabloid supermarket rag. Peter (Peter Greene, known to most as Zed from Pulp Fiction) doesn't like to see his own reflection. He drives along in his cocoon, insulated with monster babies, aliens, Elvis, and Playboy Playmates on killing sprees. Perhaps paper reflects better than glass.Peter has other idiosyncrasies, to put it mildly. His morning coffee is poured into three cups, with great effort made to ensure equal levels of milk and sugar. He carries with him a torn photograph of a baby girl, probably his own (a plot device revisited in director Lodge Kerrigan's later picture, Keane), but we have to be careful with our assumptions. He also believes there to be a transistor under one of his fingernails, placed there during a scarring mental hospital sojourn. There's a corresponding receiver in his scalp - his attempts to remove these items are some of the more unsettling things you'll see put to film. Whether he succeeds or not is a matter a perspective, much like the rest of Clean, Shaven. It works well enough for him, so judge not lest ye be judged.Peter's senses, like our own, are unreliable, colored by preconceptions and social forces. What we experience is not objective - Clean, Shaven demonstrates this, not simply by submerging us in Peter's warped, subjective point of view, but with reminders that our own point of view (specifically in regards to Peter) is warped as well. Guilt and innocence, as much as these concepts exist, are not so easily determined. Neither are ""crazy"" and ""sane"" (indeed, Clean, Shaven is most effective when we're forced to reexamine our own preconceived notions about mental illness). Life is often a collection of random images and sounds, white noise that can overwhelm us if we let it. Our ability to hear, and process what is heard, is based as much on what we tune out as what we tune in. Peter can't tune things out and for that he is ""sick."" We who are ""healthy"" are better at this, but I wonder how much better.Clean, Shaven has a plot, barely (running time is a fleeting 80 minutes), centering on two parallel quests: Peter's search for someone who may or may not be his daughter and a police detective searching for Peter in connection with a murdered girl. The two men share some overt similarities - obsession with procedure and minutiae, the corporeal, proneness to violent outbursts. Kerrigan is a smart director, so this kind of narrative/character congruity (cop and criminal are of one mind), lazy clich&eacute; in the hands of another, is at least tolerably subtle here. I imagine it's simply a nod to genre, or even an indictment of audience expectations. Perhaps it's filmmaker immaturity (it is his first picture, after all), but I'm willing to give Kerrigan the benefit of the doubt.That's my own prejudice, but at least I'm honest about it.Interesting footnote: In 2005, John Waters was asked to curate a series of films, with introduction and commentary, for ""America's premier gay television network"" Here! TV. John Waters Presents Movies That Will Corrupt You ran thirteen pictures, all with positive gay themes, the two notable exceptions being Irreversible (whose homophobic content frankly makes it a surprising selection to me) and Clean, Shaven.",4,perhaps paper reflects better than glass,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,3497,"['Can', 'Help', 'Make', 'Dream', 'Come', 'True', 'Quickly', 'So', 'newspaper', 'advertisement', 'spread', 'schizophrenic', 'man', 'car', 'window', 'Every', 'glass', 'surface', 'vehicle', 'including', 'rear', 'side-view', 'mirrors', 'covered', 'crumpled', 'paper', 'torn', 'tabloid', 'supermarket', 'rag', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'Greene', 'known', 'most', 'Zed', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'own', 'reflection', 'along', 'cocoon', 'insulated', 'monster', 'babies', 'aliens', 'Elvis', 'Playboy', 'Playmates', 'killing', 'sprees', 'Perhaps', 'paper', 'better', 'glass.Peter', 'other', 'idiosyncrasies', 'put', 'mildly', 'morning', 'coffee', 'poured', 'three', 'cups', 'great', 'effort', 'made', 'ensure', 'equal', 'levels', 'milk', 'sugar', 'torn', 'photograph', 'baby', 'girl', 'probably', 'own', 'plot', 'device', 'revisited', 'director', 'Lodge', 'Kerrigan', 'later', 'picture', 'Keane', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'assumptions', 'also', 'be', 'transistor', 'one', 'fingernails', 'placed', 'scarring', 'mental', 'hospital', 'sojourn', 'corresponding', 'receiver', 'scalp', 'attempts', 'remove', 'items', 'are', 'more', 'unsettling', 'things', ""'ll"", 'see', 'put', 'film', 'not', 'matter', 'perspective', 'much', 'rest', 'Clean', 'Shaven', 'well', 'enough', 'so', 'judge', 'not', 'lest', 'ye', 'be', 'judged.Peter', 'senses', 'own', 'are', 'unreliable', 'colored', 'preconceptions', 'social', 'forces', 'What', 'experience', 'not', 'objective', 'Clean', 'Shaven', 'not', 'simply', 'submerging', 'Peter', 'warped', 'subjective', 'point', 'view', 'reminders', 'own', 'point', 'view', 'specifically', 'regards', 'Peter', 'warped', 'as', 'well', 'Guilt', 'innocence', 'as', 'much', 'concepts', 'exist', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'determined', 'are', 'crazy', 'sane', 'indeed', 'Clean', 'Shaven', 'most', 'effective', 'when', ""'re"", 'forced', 'reexamine', 'own', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'mental', 'illness', 'Life', 'often', 'collection', 'random', 'images', 'sounds', 'white', 'noise', 'can', 'overwhelm', 'let', 'ability', 'hear', 'process', 'what', 'heard', 'based', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'tune', 'out', 'what', 'tune', 'Peter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tune', 'things', 'out', 'sick', 'who', 'are', 'healthy', 'are', 'better', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'better.Clean', 'Shaven', 'plot', 'barely', 'running', 'time', 'fleeting', '80', 'minutes', 'centering', 'two', 'parallel', 'quests', 'Peter', 'search', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'daughter', 'police', 'detective', 'searching', 'Peter', 'connection', 'murdered', 'girl', 'two', 'men', 'share', 'overt', 'similarities', 'obsession', 'procedure', 'minutiae', 'corporeal', 'proneness', 'violent', 'outbursts', 'Kerrigan', 'smart', 'director', 'so', 'kind', 'narrative/character', 'congruity', 'cop', 'criminal', 'are', 'one', 'mind', 'lazy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'hands', 'least', 'tolerably', 'subtle', 'here', 'imagine', 'simply', 'nod', 'genre', 'even', 'indictment', 'audience', 'expectations', 'Perhaps', 'filmmaker', 'immaturity', 'first', 'picture', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'Kerrigan', 'benefit', 'doubt.That', 'own', 'prejudice', 'least', ""'m"", 'honest', 'it.Interesting', 'footnote', '2005', 'John', 'Waters', 'was', 'asked', 'curate', 'series', 'films', 'introduction', 'commentary', 'America', 'premier', 'gay', 'television', 'network', 'Here', 'TV', 'John', 'Waters', 'Presents', 'Movies', 'Will', 'Corrupt', 'ran', 'thirteen', 'pictures', 'positive', 'gay', 'themes', 'two', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'being', 'Irreversible', 'homophobic', 'content', 'frankly', 'surprising', 'selection', 'Clean', 'Shaven']",N/A
1009761,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000H5U5RG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","Mental illness, and specifically schizophrenia, in film has always posed a challenging dilemma.  Representing the disease accurately may not always be easy from a filmic, and thus primarily visual, standpoint since so much of it is an internalized issue.  How do you convey that inner turmoil without being cliche' or oversimplifying an extremely complex topic?  ""Clean, Shaven,"" especially for such a low budget picture, does an excellent job getting to the heart of the matter.  Lodge Kerrigan's small film employs great technical prowess to put you into the unsettling mindset of its lead character, played by Peter Greene.The story is very simple.  Greene, recently released from an institution but hardly well, makes a trip to find his daughter.  Having left her with his mother, she has since been put with a woman who has adopted her.  To establish the mood of the piece, the first 20 minutes are played completely silently by Greene.  Instead, the soundtrack is filled with discordant noise (including a recurrent radio tuner) and a cacophony of jumbled voices that provide a little backstory.  This ambient noise is supplemented by a unique visual style.  The dramatic action, or narrative, is interspersed with unusual close-ups of mundane objects with occasional flashes of violence.  It sets the mood perfectly, and the style becomes the major success of the film.  Greene, who has a genuinely creepy appeal, is great in the lead.  Registering much of his performance with facial expression, it is a powerful study of someone falling apart--yet still seeking peace.My one reservation about ""Clean, Shaven"" comes from the detective character who is following Greene throughout the film.  We never know much about him--specifically why he's tracking Greene or how he made a connection that Greene was an individual that he wished to follow.  He shows up, somewhat conveniently, to interview various people who have come in contact with the subject and even (somewhat randomly) begins a relationship with the adoptive mother of Greene's daughter.  It's all very ambiguous--but perhaps that's its intent.  The film has such a dreamlike, almost surreal quality, its goal is never to provide a conventional narrative.  Still, I lacked some understanding that would have made me appreciate the film more.Certainly not for every audience, ""Clean, Shaven"" provides a fascinating filmic view of schizophrenia.  Many people will not find this an entertaining diversion.  However, if the topic interests you--this film has a lot of artistic merit, visual and audio interest, and a terrific lead performance.

We follow Peter (played by Peter Greene), a man with some kind of schizophrenia and parts of the film is how he sees the world. We are given very few explanations and the plot contains some interesting ambiguities. Clean, shaven is more about the audiovisual than about narrative and/or social criticism. Through the film we hear voices like an untuned radio, sometimes in the scene and sometimes it is inside Peter's head. Clean, shaven also contains a few quite nasty strong scenes (a corpse in close up, Peter trying to cut of his nail etc) that sensitive viewers should be prepared for. Even though the film is set in strange and ugly milieus like desolate industrial areas and shabby mansions it also contains a kind of beauty or at least it's own special aesthetics. Also, the actors are excellent, especially Peter Greene who manages to look really tormented throughout the movie.The Criterion edition also contains some extras like commentary and a video essay.

In the film he attempts to locate his daughter who was adopted. He goes to the adoption agency who will not give him information. Meanwhile a policeman is searching for a killer on then loose. The film goes into the life of the schizophrenic man in detail and his auditory hallucinations  are depicted in the film.There are several disturbing scenes of bodily mutilation including one where he removes his entire fingernail with a knive believing there is a radio transmitter under it. The scene is very graphic and squeamish people will definately want to look away.The DVD has some good special features including a theatrical trailer, audio commentary by Steven Soderbergh interviewing director, Lodge Kerrigan. Also included is a documentary on the film and the film's soundtrack playable on the DVD or downloadable as MP3'sI am unsure how accurately the film depicts schizophrenia but as I did not see anything in the credits about the film having a psychiatric or psychological consultant, I doubt the filmmakers could be accurate.

The mood is similar to ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" but thats where similarity ends. The problem with this film is I had recently replaced a worn out copy of ""Scared Straight"", a prison documentary with death row inmates talking with high school kids who were all petty criminals themselves. The inmates threaten and verbally abuse the kids to scare them straight so as not to land up in prison. The dialogue is offensive and its a great piece of work. The director of ""Clean,  Shaven"" must have thought so too; he has incorporated almost all the abusive dialogue lifted straight from the film as his character's audio hallucinations! I thought some of the background ambient voices and phrases sounded mighty familiar and got SS out to compare. It really hurt my original criticism of ""Clean, Shaven"". Had he come up with his own offensive and intimidating banter it would have made this a more durable piece of work. Still, disturbing and worth seeing.

The effect is disturbing but we begin to sympathize with the man as he searches for his little daughter. There is a whodunnit plot attached to the film, but the chief achievement of the film was to put us inside the mind of a sick, horribly isolated and profoundly suffering mind of Peter Winter.Lodge Kerrigan and Peter Greene have created something great here.
