Then, you have the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe (Ginger), an all-grown-up Dorothy from the 'Wizard of Oz,' (Mary Ann, who can't wait to go home to Kansas), and two caricatures of wealth (the Howells) and science (the Professor). Despite all this, 'Gilligan's Island' is very entertaining and a rare TV satire. Yes, I said, satire. The latter elements, however, came from the visitors, including a Soviet cosmonaut (The Cold War and the Space Race), The Mosquitoes (Beatlemania), the off-course surfer dude (The California scene with its surfing and bodybuilding) to name just a few. I must say that this no-brainer series has me envying that we did not have these DVD's when I was in college, (a wonderful antidote to the mental exhaustion of exams).

788223,A257UC0ST4FFAY,B0000WN1WW,"80sLady ""PRG""","[2, 2]","After I had acquired the last season of ""Gilligan's Island"", I sat down for three days and watched everything Gilligan.Spoken like a true underdog, I sympathized with Gilligan's antics.  Although sweet and well-meaning, Gilligan can't seem to get his act together, especially when it comes to being rescued.  Whether he's just botched up one of the Professor's experiments or frightened one of the potential rescuers away, it's a wonder after all of this and the Skipper's brow-beating why Gilligan hadn't resigned himself to the other side of the island.  Ever optimistic, Gilligan is like the happy boy at Christmastime whose spirit cannot break easily.Gilliagn's faithful confidante is his old buddy, the Skipper, who is like a father, and is a mentor and a friend to him.  There is nothing that Gilligan wouldn't do for his Skipper.  Picture the eccentric million/billionaires, Thurston and Lovey Howell, as the King and Queen of England, scoffing at the thought of doing menial labor yet reluctantly pitching in to lend a helping hand and provide comic relief.  Ever wonder what a famous actress would end up like in a deserted island?  Apparently, like one of the bunch.  In the first season, Ginger dresses more shabbier than Mary Ann, than gradually begins to acquire a bigger and better wardrobe.  How DID the girls manage to find all of the materials to make all of their clothes?  Weren't the members all going on a three hour tour?  In any case, no one can deny the chemistry between Ginger and the Profesor or the never-to-be budding romance between Mary Ann and Gilligan.  Speaking of the Professor, he was so knowledgeable as to figure out how to stop a volcano from erupting and how to make a florescent dye out of materials found on the island, yet he was never effectively able to conjure up an experiment or product to get them off of the island.  As the series progresses, it appeared that it was the Professor's intentions to actually stay on the island.  What a blow that discovery would have been for the rest of the Minnow passengers and crew.Although only a three hour tour, this series went on for three years (another twelve years were off-camera). And for fifteen years, these characters learned to laugh, love and live with each other like a real family.

788241,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B0000WN1WW,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","This show could have easily been forgotten but now it's impossible because of the great cast this show had. Gilligan (Bob Denver) and the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.) were terrific at slap stick comedy. And then there are the sophisticated millionaires Thurston Howell the third (Jim Backus) and his wife ""Lovey"", (Natalie Schafer) and there also is the movie star Ginger. (Tina Louise) And for some strange reason Russell Johnson (the Professor) and Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) aren't credited in the first season but they have just as big a role as any other character. So as you can see there's something for everyone in this show, and the cast all did an extraordinary job at making their characters so beloved.If you don't know the plot of this show I don't know where you've been because this has been one of the most re-run shows of all time, so even though I was born in 1995 I watched many episodes. It's a shame this show only lasted three seasons and it didn't get canceled because it wasn't popular, it was very successful but for some crazy reason it was cancelled for re-runs of Gunsmoke.  But fortunately we now have the entire first season on DVD for us to enjoy from now on. When I watch Gilligan's Island I think for some stupid reason they will get off the island even though I knew they wouldn't (oops! I spoiled the show, I'm so sorry) so it just never got tiresome watching them almost get back to society only for their hopes and dreams to be dashed by Gilligan's blunders. I also love this show for the cheesy inventions created by the Professor, like the shell phone (I don't remember which season this episode is from) and not just inventions, they always have everything they need, an endless amount of clothes, makeup, and an endless amount of guest stars.  : )I don't recall any episodes being edited and the bonus features are decent, so there is good incentive to buy this set. Also included with this set is the series pilot. The theme song is way different than the one we all grew up with but it's enjoyable to listen to for one episode. And the pilot also has a commentary with the creator of Gilligan's Island Sherwood Schwartz, he makes interesting commentaries and I would recommend listening to them. There also is a short feature about how the series was created. Oh, two other small bonus features are a Gilligan's Island survival guide and tropical tidbits. (On-screen factoids)Now I know everybody's got their own favorite episode, but I'd like to chime in and tell you mine. I love both of the episodes when Hans Conried guest stars as Wrongway Feldman. ""President Gilligan"" is another great episode. The Skipper and Mr. Howell both want to be in charge of the island, so they decide to have an election and by the title of the episode, I think you know who gets elected. There are just so many outlandish plots, so it's hard to choose which ones my favorite, and it's pretty hard to watch just one episode at a time, but those are just some of my favorite episodes.

I've had some of theColumbia house vhs released in the 90's but they didn't have many ofmy favorite episodes and the quality was wearing out. I just got thisat best buy and I was shocked at the asking price but I noticed theyonly had one left and dvd's are being phased out. I paid 59.00 butnow I see it was a bad deal. If I bought here paid for shipping wouldbe about the same but now I get to watch today and tonight! I'm alreadythrough 10 episodes and they are just so much funnier after all thecrap on tv today!

Maybe that explains why I only scored 97.3% on my LSATS and consistently only score in the neighbourhood of 170 on intelligence tests. Maybe that's why I don't appreciate the sublime comedies of The Bard which usually center around women fooling their husbands into thinking they are male strangers simply by wearing false mustaches.  Maybe that is why I prefer watching a lighthearted comedy like Gilligan's Island which deftly satirizes such things as greed and egotism and envy, etc. over insulting other people on the internet or reading some dreary novel about existential ennui any day.For those reasons, I am personally quite thankful that Gilligan's Island is now being collected on DVD to provide entertainment to my woefully inadequate intelligence (We philistines in Canada also have an unfortunate need for fun. C'est la vie.)

This set used to hover around the hundred dollar mark, so when I saw it for such a low price I snatched it up. The funny thing was, I saw all three season sets at Target for $9.99 each and snatched them up prior to finding the lower price boxed set here at Amazon. I returned the season sets because I wanted the Complete Series Box. The funny thing is, Season Three does not come in the ""fat"" DVD case like the retail version I picked up at Target, and like the other 2 seasons enclosed in the box set. Season 3 comes in a standard size DVD case with a multiple disc insert to hold all five discs. It just seems strange that the manufacturer would have a different version of Season 3 for retail than for the box set, when the other two seasons seems to be the same ones that I returned to Target.The only explanation I could figure out for the revised Season 3 packaging is that the manufacturer is using the boxes designed for the original release of this title which had double sided discs originally packaged in cardboard type boxes that pulled out from the slip case to hold the discs. Possibly, the current configuration of the two ""fat"" cases and the single standard case fit in the same specs without redesigning the original case. Seasons One & Two both have six discs each, while Season Three only has five, so it is only logical that the last season would need less room.The quality of the video is great, and the audio is up to par with TV shows from this era. It's great to see Gilligan again, since I don't see the show in syndication anymore. Also the unaired pilot was cool with different characters and a different song was cool to see.

788279,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0000WN1WW,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 8]","The charter boat S.S. Minnow, out of Honolulu, Hawaii, was on a sightseeing tour when it was caught in a storm & shipwrecked on an uncharted South Pacific island. Numerous questions abounded for nitpickers who found the show's simplicity annoying- chief among them were: If the cruise was only supposed to be for 3 hours, how & why did the passengers pack so much? Well, obviously they did not. Each episode, in a way, is a self-contained vignette, not necessarily related to the others, although some are. Producer Sherwood Schwartz has tried to cast his show as a sort of tv version of the Grimm Bros. fairy tales- with each show teaching a lesson. Others believe GI is akin to the Genesis myth- yet farcical rather than dramatic. GI shows a group of castaways exiled from the paradise of modern America, filled with fast food, modern appliances, & entertainments galore. Marooning replaces exile but instead of finding themselves lost from history they end up severed from their modernity. In truest Biblical fashion they long for Salvation- not of their souls, but of their corpi. & like mankind, eternally doomed by Adam & Eve's sin, the castaways are doomed by Gilligan's stupidity, & their own ethics for not offing him. In a way Gilligan & Co. are living cartoons- occasionally over-the-top Tex Avery toons, but more often the Nietszchean hell of the Roadrunner & Wile E. Coyote. Despite the failures, the castaways always survive- not unlike the numerous personae of Buster Keaton, or more aptly Charlie Chaplin's Tramp. Most often it's Gilligan's failings that doom the castaways. But others' failures abound: the Skipper's need to be in control, Mr. Howell's need to manipulate, Mrs. Howell's need for routine over pragmatism, the Professor's Rube Goldbergian devices, Ginger's need for attention & approval, & Mary Ann's nave-t&eacute;.So, the query is- if the characters are so dumb & predictable, why are they so beloved? Because they are archetypes, not stereotypes- despite the absurd plots. Even when treated to the stand-bys of doppelg&auml;ngers or `certain' doom, the viewer knows the episode will end just where it began- not waiting for Godot, but salvation. Still, the characterizations are so strong, that by the 3rd or 4th episode we know how every character is going to react to a certain premise. This would kill most shows- witness the dull meanderings of the 1980s mega-hit, The Cosby Show. But, being set with such a wacky initial premise allowed each episode to go off on increasingly absurd branches without viewer backlash against the characters. This allowed producer SS to moralize without being preachy- unlike, say Bill Cosby's show. This absurdism also allowed SS to have a retinue of occasional stock actors to play many parts- the most notable recurring actor being Vito Scotti- who made a handful of outrageous appearances as different characters. In a way, GI's fantastical plots allowed a lot of subtextual social commentary to go on without being heavyhanded. In this way, GI resembled another all-time tv classic- The Twilight Zone. On TTZ writer & producer Rod Serling could slip in political messages under the guise of an extraterrestrial storyline, that he could never slip by the network censors were he overtly writing about McCarthyism or racism. Similarly, GI could tackle greed, vanity, materialism, & relationships by using far out scenarios to comment on more prosaic dealings with such things. This is why viewers were drawn into the show in its network run, & have never let it go since. Despite the absurd silliness we all know versions of the 7 castaways in our own lives. This made them REAL, despite their often caricaturized state. Add in the fact that the castaways never really learn their lessons, & the parallels to reality could become depressingly obvious, were they not so hilarious. Never before nor since has tv been so existential, & simple, at the same time. The show was about total illogic, yet it made perfect sense, especially the more its slapstick & absurdism pushed the pedal to the metal.",5,Absurdism lives,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,4070,"['charter', 'boat', 'S.S.', 'Minnow', 'Honolulu', 'Hawaii', 'was', 'sightseeing', 'tour', 'when', 'was', 'caught', 'storm', 'shipwrecked', 'uncharted', 'South', 'Pacific', 'island', 'Numerous', 'questions', 'abounded', 'nitpickers', 'who', 'found', 'show', 'simplicity', 'annoying-', 'chief', 'were', 'cruise', 'was', 'only', 'supposed', 'be', '3', 'hours', 'how', 'why', 'did', 'passengers', 'pack', 'so', 'much', 'Well', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'episode', 'way', 'self-contained', 'vignette', 'not', 'necessarily', 'related', 'others', 'are', 'Producer', 'Sherwood', 'Schwartz', 'tried', 'cast', 'show', 'sort', 'tv', 'version', 'Grimm', 'Bros.', 'fairy', 'tales-', 'show', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'Others', 'believe', 'GI', 'akin', 'Genesis', 'myth-', 'yet', 'farcical', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'GI', 'group', 'castaways', 'exiled', 'paradise', 'modern', 'America', 'filled', 'fast', 'food', 'modern', 'appliances', 'entertainments', 'galore', 'Marooning', 'replaces', 'exile', 'instead', 'finding', 'lost', 'history', 'end', 'up', 'severed', 'modernity', 'truest', 'Biblical', 'fashion', 'long', 'Salvation-', 'not', 'souls', 'corpi', 'mankind', 'eternally', 'doomed', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'sin', 'castaways', 'are', 'doomed', 'Gilligan', 'stupidity', 'own', 'ethics', 'not', 'offing', 'way', 'Gilligan', 'Co.', 'are', 'living', 'cartoons-', 'occasionally', 'over-the-top', 'Tex', 'Avery', 'toons', 'more', 'often', 'Nietszchean', 'hell', 'Roadrunner', 'Wile', 'E.', 'Coyote', 'failures', 'castaways', 'always', 'survive-', 'not', 'numerous', 'personae', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'more', 'aptly', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Tramp', 'Most', 'often', 'Gilligan', 'failings', 'doom', 'castaways', 'others', 'failures', 'Skipper', 'need', 'be', 'control', 'Mr.', 'Howell', 'need', 'manipulate', 'Mrs.', 'Howell', 'need', 'routine', 'pragmatism', 'Professor', 'Rube', 'Goldbergian', 'devices', 'Ginger', 'need', 'attention', 'approval', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'nave-t', 'eacute', 'query', 'is-', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'dumb', 'predictable', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'beloved', 'are', 'archetypes', 'not', 'stereotypes-', 'absurd', 'plots', 'Even', 'when', 'treated', 'stand-bys', 'doppelg', 'auml', 'ngers', 'certain', 'doom', 'viewer', 'episode', 'will', 'end', 'just', 'where', 'not', 'waiting', 'Godot', 'salvation', 'Still', 'characterizations', 'are', 'so', 'strong', '3rd', '4th', 'episode', 'know', 'how', 'character', 'going', 'react', 'certain', 'premise', 'would', 'kill', 'most', 'shows-', 'witness', 'dull', 'meanderings', '1980s', 'mega-hit', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'being', 'set', 'such', 'wacky', 'initial', 'premise', 'allowed', 'episode', 'go', 'off', 'increasingly', 'absurd', 'branches', 'viewer', 'backlash', 'characters', 'allowed', 'producer', 'SS', 'moralize', 'being', 'preachy-', 'say', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'show', 'absurdism', 'also', 'allowed', 'SS', 'have', 'retinue', 'occasional', 'stock', 'actors', 'play', 'many', 'parts-', 'most', 'notable', 'recurring', 'actor', 'being', 'Vito', 'Scotti-', 'who', 'made', 'handful', 'outrageous', 'appearances', 'different', 'characters', 'way', 'GI', 'fantastical', 'plots', 'allowed', 'lot', 'subtextual', 'social', 'commentary', 'go', 'being', 'heavyhanded', 'way', 'GI', 'resembled', 'all-time', 'tv', 'classic-', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'TTZ', 'writer', 'producer', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'could', 'slip', 'political', 'messages', 'guise', 'extraterrestrial', 'storyline', 'could', 'never', 'slip', 'network', 'censors', 'were', 'overtly', 'writing', 'McCarthyism', 'racism', 'Similarly', 'GI', 'could', 'tackle', 'greed', 'vanity', 'materialism', 'relationships', 'using', 'far', 'out', 'scenarios', 'comment', 'more', 'prosaic', 'dealings', 'such', 'things', 'why', 'viewers', 'were', 'drawn', 'show', 'network', 'run', 'have', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'absurd', 'silliness', 'know', 'versions', '7', 'castaways', 'own', 'lives', 'made', 'REAL', 'often', 'caricaturized', 'state', 'Add', 'fact', 'castaways', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'lessons', 'parallels', 'reality', 'could', 'become', 'depressingly', 'obvious', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'hilarious', 'Never', 'tv', 'been', 'so', 'existential', 'simple', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'total', 'illogic', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'especially', 'more', 'slapstick', 'absurdism', 'pushed', 'pedal', 'metal']",N/A

Here is what I found in my late 2013 shipment:- All disks are present and accounted for. Nothing missing and no duplicates. Phew.- The set used to have two-sided disks, which caused problems for some people. I got all one-sided disks, which are less likely to have flaws/reliability problems. That's an improvement. However, the studio(?) never redid the DVD menus, so each menu says that there's more material on the other side of the disk. LOL, no. Don't insert your one-sided disks upside-down!- The disks are in the flip-style plastic cases, one season per case, and the three cases are in turn housed in a single cardboard plastic box.Those flip-style boxes are pretty crummy at the best of times... even when there is no damage to them at all, it's not uncommon to find all the disks off their spindles when you open a brand new box. When my set arrived, however, there was a dent on one corner of the cardboard box, and the plastic cases were in terrible shape. One was completely broken and unusable.

788317,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B0000WN1WW,Hazen B Markoe,"[1, 1]","In 1963, the CBS television network first aired GILLIGAN&#65533;S ISLAND, a slapstick sitcom with an unusual premise. Set in a desert island with a group of castaways, this comedy turned off many of the TV critics, who savaged the show by calling it sophomoric and idiotic.  Even the network wasn&#65533;t all that thrilled with the show, having refused it three times before agreeing to air it.  To the surprise of many, the show actually became a hit, winning its time-slot every year it was on, despite being moved to a different time and day each year.  Eventually, the show was cancelled after its 3rd season to make room for another season of CBS favorite GUNSMOKE. Despite all the adversity, GILLIGAN&#65533;S ISLAND would go on to become a huge hit in syndication, where it still runs on many TV stations today......almost 40 years after it first aired.This DVD set collects the first season with all the classic black and white episodes. (The other seasons were in color.)  Bob Denver, who previously was the beatnik Maynard G. Krebs in the Dobie Gillis shows, is charming as the accident-prone Gilligan.  Alan Hale, Jr. matches him as the put-upon Skipper.  Jim Backus definitely has his share of laughs as filthy rich Thurston Howell, III, while Dawn Wells and Tina Louise provide nice contrast as the wholesome Mary Ann and sexy starlet Ginger. Natalie Shaffer and Russell Johnson provide solid support as Howell&#65533;s wife and the brainy Professor, respectively.The DVD transfer is very sharp and the special features are somewhat interesting, including the original pilot with a different Professor and Ginger, and a completely different character instead of Mary Ann, as well as commentary by series creator/producer Sherwood Schwartz.  The episode &#65533;Two on a Raft&#65533; has pop-up comments that cover some of the history surrounding the show&#65533;s creation and run.

Page ""movie fan""","[5, 5]","i'm a father of two young boys and my wife and i control what we let our boys watch on tv. most of the shows today are just not kid friendly and we don't let them watch,so we use dvds of some of our beloved old shows to let them watch. on friday nights we have ""movie and popcorn night"" at our house and they pick the shows we watch,and this is one they love.i can remember getting home from school and watching this everyday,must have seen each one 60 times i guess,so i thought i'd show them to my boys. well they are in love with the show and even play it when they go outside.if you don't know the plot by now(have you been lost on an island your whole life) i'm just going to say that 7 people who were on a ""three hour tour"" are marroned on an island and looking to get off. anyway it's silly and never tries to be anything other than fun,and it does so very well. people always attack it as dumd and worthless, but if it weren't good then why is it that after it went off first run episodes it has run everyday somewhere in the world ! i have heard that it runs 16 times a day still everyday somewhere. it never won any awards but everyone can quote the number 2 ranked theme song of all times at least part if not all of it.how many quote""great shows "" can claim that.the glue here is the late and very much unsung actor bob denver as gilligan. he's always messing up and not very smart, but his heart is in the right place and he tries, so you love him even when he messes up. alan hale jr. as the skipper is just as good in a role that could be just a mean man who gets mad at gilligan and stands over him, but hale is so loveable and so silly himself that you see that these two guys really do have a father son kind of relasionship that the skipper never comes off as mean,a very fine line that makes the show so good. jim backus as mr. howell is just right with his i'm better than this airs ,but never so much that he becomes someone to hate you grow to love him and natalie schafer as mrs. howell and once again that takes great acting to walk that fine line. tina louise as ginger is very good also.my first crush as a child dawn wells is mary ann the farm girl who at least in the first season looks to be a possiable love intrest for gilligan, and she shines  in a role that could have been lost among the rest of the cast. russell johnson is the professor, who could build a a-bomb from to coconuts but couldn't fix a 2"" hole in a boat, and he gives the show it's answer to the problem of the week in fine comedy tone.sherwoods schwarts, the person who created the show, gave us a nice message also about how they got along together and worked for the common good instead of only looking out for themselves. so silly and very slap stick in presention, but a nice little message tucked in there also.so 5 satrs for the show that will never die,and a show i'm proud to show my kids and can leave the room for a second and don't have to worry about bad words,vilonce,or over the top sex being seen by my kids because it's kid friendly. that my boys sit with me and laugh and we talk about things while we do makes this one to add

The seven deadly sins are personified as the castaways deserted on an island (purgatory). Here's a lowdown for those not familiar with the show....1. Pride - The Professor (Russel Johnson) is the smartest man alive. He made a working satellite out of bamboo once. His pride was his downfall. No matter how smart he was and proud of his acheivments, he never went anywhere.2. Greed - The Millionaire (Jim Buckus) was the greediest man on the planet. He took millions of dollars and an expansive wardrobe with him on a three hour tour. But for all his money, he couldn't buy the island.3. Envy - Mary-Ann (Dawn Wells) wanted to be Ginger so badly. One episode she gets knocked on the head and thinks she IS Ginger. Little farm girl could never be more than what she was.4. Lust - Ginger Grant (Tina Louise) The Hollywood movie star was the walking, talking sin of lust itself. She was enough to make any mortal man fall to his knees with desire.5. Gluttony - The Skipper (Alan Hale) Not only was he a fat dude to begin with, but he couldn't help but wof down every coconut and banana creme pie he could get his hands on.6. SLoth - Mrs. Howell had no use or purpose. Rarely was she involved in the plot. She probably spent most of her time sleeping in the hut she shared with Thirston.7. Wrath - Gilligan (Bob Denver) The angriest man to ever walk the planet. His rage was disguised as stupidity as his bumbling kept everyone on the island. He wanted them there, because he was evil. His hatred for mankind can best be remembered in the episode when they actually DID get off the island and ended up switching personalities in the lab of a mad scientist.Enjoy.",5,The Seven Deadly Sins finally released on DVD!,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,1753,"['Thank', 'dark', 'pits', 'Hell', 'finally', 'releasing', 'favorite', 'time', 'show', 'GILLIGAN', 'ISLAND', 'seven', 'deadly', 'sins', 'are', 'personified', 'castaways', 'deserted', 'island', 'purgatory', 'Here', 'lowdown', 'not', 'familiar', 'show', '.1', 'Pride', 'Professor', 'Russel', 'Johnson', 'smartest', 'man', 'alive', 'made', 'working', 'satellite', 'bamboo', 'once', 'pride', 'was', 'downfall', 'matter', 'how', 'smart', 'was', 'proud', 'acheivments', 'never', 'went', 'anywhere.2', 'Greed', 'Millionaire', 'Jim', 'Buckus', 'was', 'greediest', 'man', 'planet', 'took', 'millions', 'dollars', 'expansive', 'wardrobe', 'three', 'hour', 'tour', 'money', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'island.3', 'Envy', 'Mary-Ann', 'Dawn', 'Wells', 'wanted', 'be', 'Ginger', 'so', 'badly', 'One', 'episode', 'knocked', 'head', 'IS', 'Ginger', 'Little', 'farm', 'girl', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'was.4', 'Lust', 'Ginger', 'Grant', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'star', 'was', 'walking', 'talking', 'sin', 'lust', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'mortal', 'man', 'fall', 'knees', 'desire.5', 'Gluttony', 'Skipper', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'fat', 'dude', 'begin', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wof', 'down', 'coconut', 'banana', 'creme', 'pie', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'on.6', 'SLoth', 'Mrs.', 'Howell', 'had', 'use', 'purpose', 'Rarely', 'was', 'involved', 'plot', 'probably', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'sleeping', 'hut', 'shared', 'Thirston.7', 'Wrath', 'Gilligan', 'Bob', 'Denver', 'angriest', 'man', 'ever', 'walk', 'planet', 'rage', 'was', 'disguised', 'as', 'stupidity', 'bumbling', 'kept', 'everyone', 'island', 'wanted', 'there', 'was', 'evil', 'hatred', 'mankind', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'remembered', 'episode', 'when', 'actually', 'DID', 'get', 'off', 'island', 'ended', 'up', 'switching', 'personalities', 'lab', 'mad', 'scientist.Enjoy']",N/A

All roles were played to the absolute hilt; BOB DENVER (fresh off his DOBIE GILLIS stint as work-shy beatnik MAYNARD G.

Astronauts, Japanese sailors and headhunters were also commonplace in creator SHERWOOD SCHWARTZ' slapstick microcosm of society, which spawned two cartoon spinoffs, three hugely popular reunion movies, and a short-lived DENVER-led rip off series called DUSTY'S TRAIL.

788358,A2I4WF84MWIBO7,B0000WN1WW,Kai Lu,"[138, 144]","Gilligan's Island has often been an object of ridicule for both professional critics and self-annointed intellectuals alike, most of whom point out the various implausibilities in the show (i.e., the Professor is an ""idiot"" because he can cause nuclear fission using coconuts but can't build a raft, the unliklihood of the Howells taking a ""three hour tour"" on an obviously inexpensive charter boat, let alone taking along three season's worth of wardrobe and costumes with them, ad nauseum), but chances are these same critics have also seen many -- if not all -- the show's episodes, and have enjoyed at least a few guilty laughs for their trouble.One of the reasons why Gilligan's Island is such a great show (it is the most re-run show in the history of television, and that INCLUDES I Love Lucy) is precisely because it is so wacky, nonsensical, and flat-out ridiculous.In Gilligan's Island -- The Complete First Season, viewers are treated to 34 original episodes, uncut, including the rare pilot episode that contains three castmembers not included in the actual show as seen on television. The episodes are in black and white, but this doesn't detract from the fun.The complete list and brief synopsis of each episode have already been written by other reviewers so I won't waste your bandwith in repeating them, however I will say one thing: seeing these episodes brings back many fond memories for me, and I didn't even realize how much of a fan of the show I was until I watched this 3-DVD set.I remember coming home from school in eigth grade each day and seeing Gilligan's Island on TV, and that was over ten years ago. I hadn't seen an episode of Gilligan's Island in the intervening years until I bought the DVD set. It's amazing, but I -- and probably countless other people -- could actually remember everything about the episodes, and my memory comes flooding back with the viewing of each one, right down to the manner in which a character pronounces certain words, and the way the Skipper cries out ""Aeuph!"" whenever Gilligan accidently hits his captain in the breadbasket, or inadvertantly drops something on his vulnerable feet, or the way Tina Louise's mouth twitches in an oddly fascinating way when her picture is shown on the program's opening credits.Gilligan's Island is one of those shows that you can watch today and enjoy, even if you've never seen it, as long as you don't expect it to make sense or follow any logic. It's one of those show's you can LOVE if your viewing of that show is connected to fond memories of your own past -- as for me, it includes summer vacation, playing Sega Genesis, playing nerf football with my best friends Howie and Art, and watching Gilligan's Island.My friend Art has since become a lawyer, and Garth became an architect. I teach in a middle school. We all grow up, but Gilligan stays with us all along the way. It's wise to pick this set up, especially if you're a fan of the show, because it's one way you can relive and continue to live a pleasant part of your own history.",5,It's funny precisely because it's so incredibly ridiculous,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,3044,"['Gilligan', 'Island', 'often', 'been', 'object', 'ridicule', 'professional', 'critics', 'self-annointed', 'intellectuals', 'alike', 'most', 'whom', 'point', 'out', 'various', 'implausibilities', 'show', 'i.e.', 'Professor', 'idiot', 'can', 'cause', 'nuclear', 'fission', 'using', 'coconuts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'build', 'raft', 'unliklihood', 'Howells', 'taking', 'three', 'hour', 'tour', 'obviously', 'inexpensive', 'charter', 'boat', 'let', 'alone', 'taking', 'along', 'three', 'season', 'worth', 'wardrobe', 'costumes', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'chances', 'are', 'same', 'critics', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'many', 'not', 'show', 'episodes', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'least', 'few', 'guilty', 'laughs', 'trouble.One', 'reasons', 'why', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'such', 'great', 'show', 'most', 're-run', 'show', 'history', 'television', 'INCLUDES', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'precisely', 'so', 'wacky', 'nonsensical', 'flat-out', 'ridiculous.In', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'viewers', 'are', 'treated', '34', 'original', 'episodes', 'uncut', 'including', 'rare', 'pilot', 'episode', 'three', 'castmembers', 'not', 'included', 'actual', 'show', 'seen', 'television', 'episodes', 'are', 'black', 'white', ""n't"", 'detract', 'fun.The', 'complete', 'list', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'other', 'reviewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'bandwith', 'repeating', 'however', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'brings', 'back', 'many', 'fond', 'memories', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'watched', '3-DVD', 'set.I', 'remember', 'coming', 'home', 'school', 'eigth', 'grade', 'day', 'seeing', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'TV', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episode', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'intervening', 'years', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'amazing', 'probably', 'countless', 'other', 'people', 'could', 'actually', 'remember', 'everything', 'episodes', 'memory', 'flooding', 'back', 'viewing', 'one', 'right', 'down', 'manner', 'character', 'certain', 'words', 'way', 'Skipper', 'out', 'Aeuph', 'Gilligan', 'accidently', 'captain', 'breadbasket', 'inadvertantly', 'something', 'vulnerable', 'feet', 'way', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'mouth', 'twitches', 'oddly', 'fascinating', 'way', 'when', 'picture', 'shown', 'program', 'opening', 'credits.Gilligan', 'Island', 'one', 'shows', 'can', 'watch', 'today', 'enjoy', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'make', 'sense', 'follow', 'logic', 'one', 'show', 'can', 'LOVE', 'viewing', 'show', 'connected', 'fond', 'memories', 'own', 'past', 'summer', 'vacation', 'playing', 'Sega', 'Genesis', 'playing', 'nerf', 'football', 'best', 'friends', 'Howie', 'Art', 'watching', 'Gilligan', 'Island.My', 'friend', 'Art', 'become', 'lawyer', 'Garth', 'became', 'architect', 'teach', 'middle', 'school', 'grow', 'up', 'Gilligan', 'way', 'wise', 'pick', 'set', 'up', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'one', 'way', 'can', 'relive', 'continue', 'live', 'pleasant', 'part', 'own', 'history']",N/A

Everything I read says you get all 3 seasons on 9 discs. Some people said they were double sided discs. I just got mine and I was surprised to find 3 individual boxes inside a sleeve for them. I looked in each season and found all the discs are single sided and each season has a booklet in the front telling what is on each disc.The 1st season has 6 discs and it is in black and white. The special features does include the series premier with a different Professor, Ginger and Mary Ann. So as far as content these seem the same as what everyone is describing.The 2nd season also has 6 discs but I think everyone else has described the story line so I'm not going to.The 3rd season has 5 discs.So as far as packaging I am very happy and I'm glad they are single sided discs. The sleeve that holds all the seasons looks just like the one in the picture. The disc holders in each box are the ones that you flip like a book to go from one disc to the next.

The plots seem more creative and are not as strange as many of the shows in the last two seasons.

Even the guests from modern civilization that visit the island seem to fit the motif of the island better than the visitors that appear in the next two seasons. This is also the only season to contain a Christmas special. My kids really like the shows and watch them all the time.

788430,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B0000WN1WW,Phil S.,"[5, 6]","In Sherwood Schwartz's interesting commentary, we hear that the idea was to present a ""micocrosm"" of society, odd couples if you will, forced to get along or perish, on an isolated spot in the Pacific. I always thought it was what Desi Arnaz said in a TV Guide article. It was about ""a couple of sexy girls on an island"".Well, thanks, partner. That's what got me going in 1964 and got be buying this DVD-set. (Now, at age 57, it isn't ""Mary Ann or Ginger"", it's ""Mrs. Howell"". That's another story...). Dawn Wells had Daisy Dukes before Catherine Bach! Or is it that Bach had ""Mary Ann""(s). Either way, she was/is still way hot.Gotta feel a little bad about Tina Louise, who expressed early on her disatisfaction with the show. As I recall, she said in an interview at vthe time, that the show was ""like a cartoon""...not to be taken seriously. I may be wrong, but I believe she has never attended a G. I. convention.The Series pilot, with different Mary Ann(s) and Ginger(s) was actually pretty good. I don't recall who was who, but the wisecracking Secretary and her [apparent] co-worker were very telegenic...and it's tough to say, but the show could have sustained with the originals, who brought in a bit more ""realism"". The TL-Ginger was all Marilyn Monroe. The Brunette was a New Yorker in temperment..would have traveled through time alot easier than ""Ginger Grant"".Schwartz says, in effect, he created a great show with characters the equivalnet if Laurel and Hardy, Monroe, whoever. By the way, I'm surprised he didn't admit to referencing the first ""Fat and Skinny""s final movie shot in France, 1950-51, involving a bunch of folks stranded on on atoll and including a glamorous model/singer, Suzie DeLair. If Schwartz didn't have that in mind...I'll eat my derby!All episodes have a good story and some surprisingly clever dialogue. Guess I was too busy at the time, waiting for Mary Ann to climb a tree.Interesting that Ida Lupino directed some of these black and white shows, though one was perhaps the very worst of the entire series: to force the Skipper to fall asleep to have his recurring dream about a World War II incident in which he managed, heroically, to turn a radio receiver into a transmitter, the residents use Mr. Howell's sleeping pills very carelessly and we are supposed to laugh when The Skipper passes out. I'm actually surprised that bit was left in the show, considering that children were obviously a big demographic for the show.A better entry is ""Wrong Way Feldman"" with Hans Conried - his plane from the '30s is discovered by Gilligan, then the pilot shows up. Alot of wild business, resulting in ""Wrong Way"" returning home successfully. Too bad, he (characteristically) couldn't figure out his own coordinates, to send a rescue team back.A nice episode called ""President Gilligan"" has some witty satire (and again recalls ""Atoll K"" with L & H: a great scene in that crazy flick also involves an ""Election"", though Hardy is victorious).Jim Backus hd the best lines and delivered them in style; sometimes reminiscent of W. C. Fields, probably another childhood idol of Sherwood Schwartz.Despite the huge success, not all the critics were wrong. There was alot of lame material not helped by that laughtrack.

788437,AXC4OG5GQ9A58,B0000WN1WW,"R. Miller ""drifter2k""","[0, 0]","Gilligan's Island isn't shakespeare but it is, in my opinion, the best escapist TV series of all time. There are many reasons why, a few reasons being:1.) The diversity of the characters and the talents of the actors. For instance, the chemistry between Alex Hale Jr and Bob Denver alone is as strong as you will find in any series. No matter how badly Gilligan messes things up you know that Skipper would never want anything bad to happen to his 'little buddy'. All the other cast members do a great job with their roles in creating likeable people with flaws but not without love for each other.2.) Almost everyone has thought about what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island so the show represents a fantasy shared by many.3.) The way the characters solve problems and cope with each other is an example we all should learn to live by. They are all from different walks of life yet in the end all work towards a common goal: to get off the island as a group.I received the DVDs from amazon.ca today and have to say that I'm very pleased with the package. For those who are concerned about 36 episodes being crammed onto 3 discs, don't worry, the discs are double-sided. Also, the episodes are in the original glorious black and white, not the blotchy peach-faced ones shown on TV most of the time these days.The commentary by Sherwood Schwartz on the pilot episode is very interesting and the optional ""Topical Tidbits"" popups on episode one are worth a look too, as are the profiles on each of the castaways. The Gilligan's Island Survival Guide is not worth watching at all but, thankfully, it's very short. The only other negative besides this that I can think of is that there are no chapter stops, but with the high quality of the product I can live without them.As to the eternal question Mary Ann or Ginger?

788439,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0000WN1WW,Robert Badgley,"[4, 9]","I must admit I have been quite tardy in picking up my copy of this first season of Gilligans Island which has been out almost two years now.I had fond memories of this light hearted show which I hadn't seen since it went off the air many years ago.I knew it wasn't critically acclaimed at the time nor a great show but it did have its' merits and was cute.I first watched the accompanying pilot and went through its few extras which was just a small laugh-umentary,some factoids on each cast member and just one audio commentary by creater Schwartz during the pilot episode.When I finally got through the first few episodes I found my fond memories fading fast.I knew back then that this was light TV fare but I now realized just how light it was.The show had its' memorable characters and moments certainly and the cast was wonderfully picked for their parts.I can see why it has retained its' charm for many throughout the years and earned itself a small niche in TV history.But I found that the more episodes I watched the more tedious they became....sad to say.Nor does the show,in my oppinion,stand up over time or bear up over repeated watchings.The first season is high on physical comedy to be sure.Gilligan and the Skipper are the Laurel and Hardy of the island,from the overall gags,to their looks(fat and skinny)and right down to their pratfalls.The Skippers' constant camera looks and mannerisms are especially indicative of Oliver Hardy(Alan Hales' father appeared coincidentally in Laurel and Hardys' 1936 great classic 'Our Relations').Season two and into three would see less and less of the physical comedy with more emphasize on their overall situation and the professors' wild inventions but the resemblance to Laurel and Hardy never went away.One reason for Gilligans Islands' final fadeout rests I believe with its concept and it's losing its' touch with reality.In the beginning we could certainly empathize with these people and their predicament,getting caught in a storm,getting stranded then having to survive until rescued.But all good comedy is rooted in some kind of reality,there has to be some thread or connection from show/movie to the viewer that says yes I can believe that this is possible(however slight)and I can relate to these characters.As time went on the shows' believability factor simply just faded away.Even in the first season,just for example,they are visited by a surfer from Hawaii who comes and goes on a rogue Tsunami!!And the plots continued to get wackier and more full of holes than a block of swiss cheese.Then there are the professors' inventions which somehow got more intricate and sophisticated as the show wore on.By the time the show hit its' final season ,even for a comedy,it had lost any empathy or believability and became a parody of itself.It was for lack of a better word just plain silly with little or no real humour left.In conclusion if you're looking for some VERY light 60s TV fare this is for you.It is certainly not classic,timeless or great TV comedy but I must admit it does retain a certain amount of charm,the acting is good and it does have its' humourous moments.Just check your brain at the door and you'll have a good time!",3,"One busy ""deserted"" island!!",1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,3208,"['must', 'admit', 'have', 'been', 'quite',

788460,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0000WN1WW,Simon Davis,"[5, 5]","What can I really say about this classic 1960's comedy series that I believe will end up outlasting us all? Loved by successive generations of television watchers, absolutely HATED by the critics both at its premiere and ever since this show has taken on near legendary status among viewers. After 40 years of endless reruns the characters of ""Little Buddy"", Gilligan, the Skipper, Kansas farm girl Mary Ann, sultry movie star Ginger Grant, the Professor, and mega rich Thurston Howell the third and his dizzy wife ""Lovey"" Howell, have become household names that need no introduction. Love it or hate it ,(and this viewer literally grew up with the seven castaways as part of his extended family!) ""Gilligan's Island"", is without a doubt one of televisions greatest success stories despite all the odds being laid up against it becoming that. What a joy it was to find out that Warner Brothers were finally giving this legendary series the proper DVD release it deserves with all the episodes of season one properly restored, reissued in their correct and original black and white photography, unedited, and in pristine condition. This set, the first of hopefully the full three seasons of the series to be released onto DVD is a television buffs delight and is essential in the collection of anyone like myself who loves classic television from the fantastic 1960's.What is so unique about this boxed DVD set of the first season of ""Gilligan's Island"", is that it also contains among a selection of extra features the extremely rare pilot episode of the series that has three different characters on board the ill fated S.S. Minnow instead of Ginger, Mary Ann, and The Professor. This makes viewing this long lost episode most interesting as the pilot until the 1990's was never publically aired on television. This pilot episode also contains all the truly beautiful on location photography done in Hawaii where the pilot was filmed which because of the cast changes when the series got the green light was then never seen. Along with the pilot episode the set contains all 36 episodes of ""Gilligan's Island"", first season in their correct order and at their original unedited length. Of course any fan has their favourite episodes but particular favourites of mine are:Episode 5: ""Wrongway Feldman"", guest starring wonderful character actor Hans Conried as a wacky aviator.Episode 7: ""The Sound of Quacking"", where with food supplies low a duck is found on the island and a debate breaks out about whether to cook it. A dream sequence contained in this episode was actually filmed on the ""Gunsmoke"", set.Episode 8: ""Goodbye Island"", the last episode to use location shooting on a beach when the castaways try to repair the Minnow with some not so permanent glue.Episode 10: ""Waiting for Watubi"", an hilarious episode and a tour de force for Alan Hale as the skipper when he believes he is cursed by an ancient god.Episode 17: ""Little Island, Big Gun"", when a mobster hides out from the law on the island.Episode 30: ""Forget Me Not"", where the Professor tries to cure the Skipper's amnesia with some surprising results.Episode 36: ""A Nose By Any Other Name"",where after a fall Gilligan gets an swollen nose and the Professor pretends to ""operate"", on him to cheer him up about his appearance.Never could ""Gilligan's Island"", be mistaken for Shakespeare but then again it never had to be and it is the great work by the extremely talented cast that makes ""Gilligan's Island"", the TV classic it is today. The amazing chemistry and physical give and take by Alan Hale and Bob Denver as the skipper and first mate Gilligan in their scenes together is one of the great comedy highlights of the show and I still feel this duo have never received the recognition that they so richly deserve as comedy greats. Alan Hale's repeated exasperated looks directly into the camera when he gets hit on the head by a falling coconut or gets whacked in the stomach by a bamboo pole courtesy of an always well meaning Gilligan are always guaranteed to break up this viewer with laughter. Hollywood veterans Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer as Mr. and Mrs. Howell were perfect casting in their roles and were so ideal together that they seemed to ACTUALLY BE the Howells to the extent that it was hard to imagine them ever as anyone else. Tina Louise, despite her mixed feelings about the show and her participation in it, is wonderful as movie star Ginger Grant who was always ready to turn on her obvious charms in the hope of being rescued and was best remembered for always wearing evening gowns throughout the shows run. Finally ""the rest"", (as they were billed on the credits for this first season), Dawn Wells as sweet Mary Ann and Russell Johnson as the brilliant Professor also made memorable characters. Mary Ann became the most popular character during the shows original run (and a dream girl for most young boys growing up in the 1960's like myself!!) , while Russell Johnson an actor I've long admired, tackled what was in a way a quite difficult role as the ""straight man"" to all the eccentric characters around him. The Professor was always the voice of reason on the Island who also created some amazing inventions to help the castaways live in reasonable ""comfort"" on the island during their three year run. His hilarious ""explanations"", of features or occurences on the island delivered in a deadpan style with incredible scientific detail always left the rest of the castaways wondering what on earth he was actually saying and was always a great source of humour on the show and makes the professor an integral character because of his ""seriousness"".I'll always love ""Gilligan's Island"", and viewing these first season episodes in this DVD set is like revisiting old friends as the poor castaways always just missing out on a chance to be rescued usually as a result of some mishap caused by Gilligan were like family during my growing up years. Today I appreciate the series for all the great talent that went into creating these episodes which is most often underappreciated by critics. A series that is still loved 40 years after it originally went to air has something special about it and I strongly recommend ""Gilligan's Island: The Complete First Season"", DVD to all lovers of classic television.

The picture and sound are about as clean and crisp as ever and definitely better than I remember seeing on any television viewing. The first season of ""Gilligan's Island"" contains all 37 hilarious episodes filmed in glorious Black & White and they are presented as originally filmed in broadcast order. For ""Gilligan's Island"" fans this set is an absolute steal and the only way to get season one completely uncut and unedited and ready for the whole family to enjoy. The extra features and (unaired pilot) are a welcomed bonus for Gilligan's fans, but we all know that more bonus material exists and it should have been included. I hope that this set is well received by fans of the show, so we can get the remaining seasons on DVD. The only negative comment I have about this set is the use of the dreaded double sided discs instead of single sided discs. Amazon's price is the cheapest I've seen anywhere to purchase this classic series and once you have it you can enjoy ""Gilligan's island"" over and over again. Everyone knows the song.........

I just wasn't watching it. I have been a fan of this show since I was a little kid in the '70s...I would rush home from school and before I settled down to tackle my homework, I would grab a light snack and turn to WPIX in New York City at 4:30 pm to watch Gilligan's Island. How I loved that show!Recently I took the plunge and purchased this classic comedy on DVD. All 98 episodes, plus the rarely seen pilot episode are here in their entirety, with some wonderful extras included. It's interesting to note that the pilot did NOT include Tina Louise, Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells but actors Kit Smythe, John Gabriel and Nancy McCarthy, respectively. The latter three were all recast, with some character retooling, due to the fact that they were not as appealing as main players Bob Denver, Alan Hale, Jr., Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer were with test audiences...good move by Sherwood Schwartz. For what is passing these days for entertainment, this is a welcome change. Good, clean comedy that everyone in the family can enjoy and will make you laugh out loud, especially the Season 1 gems, ""Waiting For Watubi"" and ""Physical Fatness""...simply hilarious. Denver and company turned out to be one of the best and memorable ensemble casts in television history, regardless of what critics and network execs thought of this show. Its longevity and popularity proved those naysayers wrong. If you are a Gilligan fan, then this collection is absolutely a must to own.

The show offers a delightful variety of character types, played by superb comic actors, thrown into fast-paced slapstick situations. There are jokes about academic eggheads (the always-inventive but rather obtuse Professor), movie stars (Ginger, channeling Marilyn Monroe), simple farm folk (Mary Ann, the sweet girl next door), and rich people (the hilarious Mr. and Mrs. Howell). At the center of the action, mixing things up, are a modern Laurel-and-Hardy duo, the bumbling sadsack Gilligan and his longsuffering Skipper.Every episode has different complications: wild animals, hostile natives, personal conflicts, supply shortages, bad weather, visiting eccentrics, each element conspiring to prevent the castaways' escape. Guest stars include well-known character actors like Hans Conreid, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Strother Martin, Don Rickles, Phil Silvers, Larry Storch, and even a young Kurt Russell. There are also witty comments on modern life in microcosm: elections, economics, superstitions, feminism, medicine, materialism, and many others.Three seasons of this classic series as well as several bonus featurettes are packed onto nine double-sided discs for a bargain price. Ths seasons are also available separately (and depending on current Amazon prices and those of Marketplace resellers, buying them individually may be an even better value). There are 99 episodes, the first 37 in black and white, including the rarely-seen pilot; the remainder of the shows are in color. Both sound and picture are perfect, and there are subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Commentaries for several episodes are provided by creator/producer Sherwood Schwartz.Snap up this great set for hours of family entertainment!",5,"Wonderful series, excellent value",1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,1820,"['children', 'love', 'series', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'humor', 'adults', 'too', 'show', 'delightful', 'variety', 'character', 'types', 'played', 'superb', 'comic', 'actors', 'thrown', 'fast-paced', 'slapstick', 'situations', 'are', 'jokes', 'academic', 'eggheads', 'always-inventive', 'rather', 'Professor', 'movie', 'stars', 'Ginger', 'channeling', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'simple', 'farm', 'folk', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'sweet', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'rich', 'people', 'hilarious', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Howell', 'center', 'action', 'mixing', 'things', 'up', 'are', 'modern', 'Laurel-and-Hardy', 'duo', 'bumbling', 'sadsack', 'Gilligan', 'longsuffering', 'Skipper.Every', 'episode', 'different', 'complications', 'wild', 'animals', 'hostile', 'natives', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'supply', 'shortages', 'bad', 'weather', 'visiting', 'eccentrics', 'element', 'conspiring', 'prevent', 'castaways', 'escape', 'Guest', 'include', 'well-known', 'character', 'actors', 'Hans', 'Conreid', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'Larry', 'Storch', 'even', 'young', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'are', 'also', 'witty', 'comments', 'modern', 'life', 'microcosm', 'elections', 'economics', 'superstitions', 'feminism', 'medicine', 'materialism', 'many', 'others.Three', 'seasons', 'classic', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'bonus', 'featurettes', 'are', 'packed', 'nine', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'bargain', 'price', 'Ths', 'seasons', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'separately', 'depending', 'current', 'Amazon', 'prices', 'Marketplace', 'resellers', 'buying', 'individually', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'value', 'are', '99', 'episodes', 'first', '37', 'black', 'white', 'including', 'rarely-seen', 'pilot', 'remainder', 'shows', 'are', 'color', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'perfect', 'are', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Commentaries', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'provided', 'creator/producer', 'Sherwood', 'Schwartz.Snap', 'up', 'great', 'set', 'hours', 'family', 'entertainment']",N/A

While I was much too young to remember this show during its original run on the CBS network during the 60s, I was always fascinated of being able to watch reruns of this program after school in the afternoons, on the weekends, during holidays and throughout Summer vacation. Sometimes it confused me as to why a black-and-white episode would be shown one day and a color episode would be on the next day. However, there is no denying the universal appeal of this timeless program. Now, all 3 complete seasons of this show have been gathered together into this handy boxed set, containing every single episode of the entire series. The first season was aired in black-and-white, with a total of 36 episodes; seasons 2 and 3 were both in full color, for 62 more half-hours. This brings the total to 98 shows. Creator and producer Sherwood Schwartz was responsible for bringing this show to life. He was able to assemble a first-rate, top-knotch cast together to portray the 7 castaways who are stranded on an uncharted deserted island, somewhere in the South Pacific. This great cast includes Bob Denver as Gilligan, Alan Hale, Jr. as The Skipper, Jim Backus as Thurston Howell III, Natalie Schafer as Mrs. Lovey Howell, Tina Louise as Ginger Grant, Russell Johnson as The Professor and Dawn Wells as Mary Ann. Together, this group must learn how to survive, while managing to still keep alive, in spite of the many hardships that they would eventually have to face each time. Also included in this set is the original, unaired pilot episode that first introduced the world to these zany folks. In this pilot, the Professor was played by John Gabriel; with Kit Smythe as Ginger and Nancy McCarthy as Bunny. While the Professor served the same purpose in the pilot and the series, Ginger was not even a glamorous movie star the first time around; both she and Bunny were secretaries. The series eventually brought the castaways in the way that we have all come to know and appreciate, after all these years. This show ranks as one of the ten best comedies in television history. And now, with this 9-disc DVD set containing all 98 classic episodes together into one complete package, this is the perfect way to relive the great memories of a comedy classic.",5,The world's longest three-hour tour!,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,2414,"['Many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'years', 'included', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'comical', 'exploits', 'classic', 'television', 'sitcom', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'show', 'original', 'run', 'CBS', 'network', '60s', 'was', 'always', 'fascinated', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'reruns', 'program', 'school', 'afternoons', 'weekends', 'holidays', 'Summer', 'vacation', 'confused', 'why', 'black-and-white', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'one', 'day', 'color', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'day', 'However', 'denying', 'universal', 'appeal', 'timeless', 'program', 'Now', '3', 'complete', 'seasons', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'gathered', 'together', 'handy', 'boxed', 'set', 'containing', 'single', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'aired', 'black-and-white', 'total', '36', 'episodes', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'were', 'full', 'color', '62', 'more', 'half-hours', 'total', '98', 'shows', 'Creator', 'producer', 'Sherwood', 'Schwartz', 'was', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'show', 'life', 'was', 'able', 'assemble', 'first-rate', 'top-knotch', 'cast', 'together', 'portray', '7', 'castaways', 'who', 'are', 'stranded', 'uncharted', 'deserted', 'island', 'somewhere', 'South', 'Pacific', 'great', 'cast', 'Bob', 'Denver', 'Gilligan', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'Skipper', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Thurston', 'Howell', 'III', 'Natalie', 'Schafer', 'Mrs.', 'Lovey', 'Howell', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'Ginger', 'Grant', 'Russell', 'Johnson', 'Professor', 'Dawn', 'Wells', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Together', 'group', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'survive', 'managing', 'still', 'keep', 'alive', 'spite', 'many', 'hardships', 'would', 'eventually', 'have', 'face', 'time', 'Also', 'included', 'set', 'original', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'episode', 'first', 'introduced', 'world', 'zany', 'folks', 'pilot', 'Professor', 'was', 'played', 'John', 'Gabriel', 'Kit', 'Smythe', 'Ginger', 'Nancy', 'McCarthy', 'Bunny', 'Professor', 'served', 'same', 'purpose', 'pilot', 'series', 'Ginger', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'glamorous', 'movie', 'star', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Bunny', 'were', 'secretaries', 'series', 'eventually', 'brought', 'castaways', 'way', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'appreciate', 'years', 'show', 'one', 'ten', 'best', 'comedies', 'television', 'history', 'now', '9-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'containing', '98', 'classic', 'episodes', 'together', 'one', 'complete', 'package', 'perfect', 'way', 'relive', 'great', 'memories', 'comedy', 'classic']",N/A

I of course knew what I was getting, and being honest I must say some of the slap-stick is simply overkill and borders on embarrasement, but if you dig a bit deeper you'll find more than that.The casting is just superb. The chemistry is spot on. The locale is enviable. The humor is honest. The packaging is nice. The quantity is unparalled. There just isn't really much else to say. However, having been spoiled by the Bewitched ""coloring"" of Season One I might have preffered that approach. Now before you vote ""unhelpful"" realize I don't just mean any old ""hack"" color job ala Turner Broadcasting I mean ""Sony"" coloring the way Bewitched was handled, now that would have kicked this up one more star.As it stands, Gilligans Island is a great bargain and one of the better 3 hour tours around.

They sure made Gilligan more clutsy in that first episode. Glade they changed that because it would have gotten old fast. It would have been interesting to see Bob Denver play a James Bond'ish type role after seeing him type cast as the incompetent one &#34; Dobie Gilles &#34; and Giligans's Island.,4,Chance to see the ones I missed,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,411,"['was', 'great', 'chance', 'see', 'episodes', 'missed', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'even', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'sure', 'made', 'Gilligan', 'more', 'clutsy', 'first', 'episode', 'Glade', 'changed', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'old', 'fast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'Bob', 'Denver', 'play', 'James', ""Bond'ish"", 'type', 'role', 'seeing', 'type', 'cast', 'incompetent', 'one', '34', 'Dobie', 'Gilles', '34', 'Giligans', 'Island']",N/A
