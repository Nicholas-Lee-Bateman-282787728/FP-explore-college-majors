1282769,A2J9Q2DYOR81U8,B002PCKWVI,Mr. Wynn,"[0, 8]","It is obvious that this film was written by someone immature and not in tune with the larger picture.  It is a one-sided view of a son in a family who battles against tradition.  The makers of this film miss out on what COULD HAVE been a good movie:1) they need to decide whether the film is a going to be a comedy or drama.  I've seen ""dramedies"" before that were done well.  In this film, it just seemed like an after thought.2) The characters are barely 2-dimensional although you can see where the makers of the film TRY SO HARD (as an after thought) to add more dimensions to the characters.  It falls flat.3) Some of the shots go against the rules of basic film making.I saw this film several years ago at a film festival.  I sat there during the whole movie angry that this film was so bad.  The content and insensitivity to their very own audience (Asians...although the film might as well have been made by ignorant non-Asians) was appalling.I believe the director/writer/actor was in his early 20s when this movie was made.  It was quite obvious that he had a lot of growing up to do.I cannot in good conscience give this film any rating higher than one star.  I'd give it LESS if I could.",1,Horrible film....,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,1199,"['obvious', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'immature', 'not', 'tune', 'larger', 'picture', 'one-sided', 'view', 'son', 'family', 'who', 'tradition', 'makers', 'film', 'out', 'what', 'COULD', 'HAVE', 'been', 'good', 'movie:1', 'need', 'decide', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dramedies', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'film', 'just', 'seemed', 'thought.2', 'characters', 'are', 'barely', '2-dimensional', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'makers', 'film', 'TRY', 'SO', 'HARD', 'thought', 'add', 'more', 'dimensions', 'characters', 'flat.3', 'shots', 'go', 'rules', 'basic', 'film', 'making.I', 'saw', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'festival', 'sat', 'whole', 'movie', 'angry', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'content', 'insensitivity', 'very', 'own', 'audience', 'Asians', 'film', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'ignorant', 'non-Asians', 'was', 'appalling.I', 'believe', 'director/writer/actor', 'was', 'early', '20s', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'quite', 'obvious', 'had', 'lot', 'growing', 'up', 'do.I', 'can', 'not', 'good', 'conscience', 'give', 'film', 'rating', 'higher', 'one', 'star', ""'d"", 'give', 'LESS', 'could']",N/A

Fastner ""monkeyboy""","[2, 5]","I wish this was better, but as with other movies produced by Californian Vietnamese, the production values are not the best. One of the sons in this movie buys a Betacam and does not seem to have a clue how to film. He may have been doing the camera work. The best actors in this video are the mom and dad. The ""kids"" are all about ""being happy"". While there is something to that notion, the only characters that seem to be on to personal development are a friend that joins the navy (realizing he needs some direction) and a neighbor (former Viet vet) who decides he need to straighten up and fly right when his adult daughter comes to see him. They are the two Caucasians in the film. This film is about the father trying to force his kids to straighten up and prepare for life, just as he tries to do with the tree in his front yard. He finally comes to grips with the fact that his kids and trees grow up as they will. If you look past the low production standards, there is a nice story. It is funny in spots and my Vietnamese wife liked it, so there you go. BTW, when the dialogue is in Vietnamese (usually when the parents are chattering at their kids or adult ""friends"") there are subtitles, but the movie is almost entirely in English.",3,"OK movie, worth watching if it interests you.",1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,1244,"['wish', 'was', 'better', 'other', 'movies', 'produced', 'Californian', 'Vietnamese', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'One', 'sons', 'movie', 'Betacam', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'camera', 'work', 'best', 'actors', 'video', 'are', 'mom', 'dad', 'kids', 'are', 'being', 'happy', 'something', 'notion', 'only', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'personal', 'development', 'are', 'friend', 'navy', 'realizing', 'direction', 'neighbor', 'former', 'Viet', 'vet', 'who', 'need', 'straighten', 'up', 'fly', 'right', 'when', 'adult', 'daughter', 'see', 'are', 'two', 'Caucasians', 'film', 'film', 'father', 'trying', 'force', 'kids', 'straighten', 'up', 'prepare', 'life', 'just', 'do', 'tree', 'front', 'yard', 'finally', 'grips', 'fact', 'kids', 'trees', 'grow', 'up', 'will', 'look', 'low', 'production', 'standards', 'nice', 'story', 'funny', 'spots', 'Vietnamese', 'wife', 'liked', 'so', 'there', 'go', 'BTW', 'when', 'dialogue', 'Vietnamese', 'usually', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'chattering', 'kids', 'adult', 'friends', 'are', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'English']",N/A
