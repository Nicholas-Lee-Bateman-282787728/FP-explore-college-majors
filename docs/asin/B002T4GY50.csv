Incredibly thoughtful these people are so good words fail but words I must write. This is the best rock opera to date if I must call it that. It transends the color barrier, what I mean is I white but I related to so much of this I just saw some wonderful people perform their hearts out. This is a must see for anyone that has taken a breath, I guess that kinda includes everyone. Stew is incredible I don't think since Zappa has anyone put humor and life together so well and then put it to some wonderful melodies. I really love thia guy and his band.

I am a big fan of classic musicals (e.g. Rodgers and Hammerstein), and though there are some rock musicals that I love (JC Superstar, Rent), I still tend to view that segment of the genre with a bit of suspicion.  Passing Strange, however, has proved itself a classic.  The story is very personal, but with universal appeal; the music is varied in style and consistently interesting both lyrically and melodically.  The acting and singing are first rate - there are no singers who act or actors who sing, there are only singer/actors here, and great ones.

I am not your average theater-goer, however this show changed my perspective and point of view of Broadway shows.  An amazing story, amazing score, and unbelievable cast.  Rebecca Naomi Jones was phenomenal in this show, and she will be a break out star.  Daniel Breaker is also outstanding and moving with his performance.I'm not a huge fan of Spike Lee, but to his credit, he did an excellent job capturing the closing night performance of this show without getting in the way.
