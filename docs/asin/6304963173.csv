Convincing and with heart, we experience the pain of Antonio Ricci (Lamberti Maggiorani) as he becomes one of the lucky few to get a decent-paying job.  He is to put up posters throughout Rome, using a broom and adhesive.  If you've been there like I have, you notice that the city has bulletins and posters pastered all over their ancient walls.  To work he must have a bicycle.  He has one, but it is broken.  Determined he accepts, but he hasn't the money for repairs.  His wife sells their linen to pay the bicycle repair shop.  All is set and his life has a whole new outlook until a thief steals his bicycle while he's on the job.  He chases him, even hitching on a car, to no avail.  He has a friend who takes him downtown, and we see a whole market of bicycles, some of which undoubtedly have been stolen.  The vast majority of the movie focuses on him and his young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), as he goes to every corner of Rome to recover what misfortune fatefully handed to him in human form.Containing (for then) a non-Hollywood ending and sporting perceptive social commentary, 'A Bicycle Thief' comes off as a post-depression 'Grapes of Wrath' for urban Italy.  It gets us there by easily providing empathy for the characters and telling a simple, but solid story.",4,Stolen Dignity,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,1412,"['5*', 'Italy', 'classic', 'movie', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'sociology', 'story', 'come', 'together', 'one', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Italians', 'Convincing', 'heart', 'experience', 'pain', 'Antonio', 'Ricci', 'Lamberti', 'Maggiorani', 'one', 'lucky', 'few', 'get', 'decent-paying', 'job', 'put', 'up', 'posters', 'Rome', 'using', 'broom', 'adhesive', ""'ve"", 'been', 'have', 'notice', 'city', 'bulletins', 'posters', 'pastered', 'ancient', 'walls', 'work', 'must', 'have', 'bicycle', 'one', 'broken', 'Determined', ""n't"", 'money', 'repairs', 'wife', 'linen', 'pay', 'bicycle', 'repair', 'shop', 'set', 'life', 'whole', 'new', 'outlook', 'thief', 'bicycle', 'job', 'even', 'hitching', 'car', 'avail', 'friend', 'who', 'downtown', 'see', 'whole', 'market', 'bicycles', 'undoubtedly', 'have', 'been', 'stolen', 'vast', 'majority', 'movie', 'young', 'son', 'Bruno', 'Enzo', 'Staiola', 'corner', 'Rome', 'recover', 'what', 'misfortune', 'fatefully', 'handed', 'human', 'form.Containing', 'then', 'non-Hollywood', 'ending', 'sporting', 'perceptive', 'social', 'commentary', 'A', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'off', 'post-depression', ""'Grapes"", 'Wrath', 'urban', 'Italy', 'easily', 'providing', 'empathy', 'characters', 'telling', 'simple', 'solid', 'story']",The Bicycle Thief VHS
441732,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6304963173,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[15, 15]","Imagine your family's livelihood depending on a bicycle. In post-war Italy, you compete with hundreds for a job where 25% of the work force is unemployed.  The job is yours but it requires you to have a bicycle, something so simple as a bicycle and that bicycle gets stolen on the first day. This is about the journey to recover that bicycle.Neorealism - This wonderful Italian 1948 classic directed by Vittorio de Sica is an emotional depiction of degradation of the soul, loss of humanity and dignity. One of the best in cinematic history, it captures neorealism at its best.Neorealism involves the use of location settings, non-actor roles, conversational instead of literary dialogue, simple camerawork and editing.  Neorealism offers a compassionate point of view with morality.Here, we wish an innocent man, with a family to support, could find relief, satisfaction, comfort and justice. No great special effects take place, no shoot-um up bang-bang, just plain old post-war Italy depicting real life, poverty, degradation and humanity.Desperate -  Antonio, a father and husband lands a job posting movie billboards; the bicycle is stolen! Antonio frantically scours the streets and his little son Bruno tenderly tags along to recover the stolen bicycle. Now keep in mind that little Bruno is in the picture for one reason, and without him, we, the audience, would have a more callous attitude to the ending.We see signs of post-war economic hard times, like the rows and rows of bicycle parts or hundreds of bedsheets that were pawned.  The characters are non-actors in the real streets of Italy.  You may need to see it more than once to catch everything or to understand its deeper meaning.Neorealism Director Vittorio de Sica directed 34 feature films and won numerous international prizes. He was honored with four Academy Awards for ""Shoeshine"" in 1947 and ""Bicycle Thief"" in 1949 and other film awards for ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" in 1964 and ""Garden of the Finzi-Continis"" in 1971. He died in 1974.  I believe ""Bicycle Thief"" is one of the best.""The Bicycle Thief"" is emotional, prodding one to think explicitly into the actions taken.  It surfaces as one of the greates movies of all time.  The VHS 50 year-old film is gritty and at times it is difficult to read the words. See it!

And to watch the movie you wouldn't be able to know. Lamberto Maggiorani who plays Antonio does such a wonderful job you'd think he was a professional actor. Everyone has his\her favorite movie, but, for me, no movie will ever be as good as this one. I've seen hundreds and hundreds of movies (how sad it that? lol) and nothing can compare to this one. I don't know if any has ever felt this before, but did you ever watch a movie and maybe even for a split second you became so taken with the movie, you forgot it was just a movie? Well, that's what happens to me everytime I watch this movie. Maybe I sound crazy to people who are reading this review, but, no movie has every managed to hit me at that personal level. To me, and maybe I'm wrong, this movie is perfect, I don't care what anyone says, I will always think of this as a perfect movie. De Sica's directing is great, and screenplay is wonderful everything fits together to make this movie what it is. De Sica has directing many great movies like &quot;Two Women&quot;, and &quot;Umberto D.&quot; but this I feel is his masterpiece. This is a warm touching movie, that is just as powerful as it was 50 years ago, and how many movies can we say that about? Very, very few! For those who still haven't seen this movie, who have to.

441735,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304963173,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","There are very few films that leave me speechless upon their closing.  `Ladri di Biciclette' is one of those films.  The last few seconds left me utterly jaw dropped; so much so that I literally uttered the word ""wow"" and just sat there a few seconds before saying it again, this time louder.""WOW""Why, you may ask, does this film leave me with that feeling?  The answer is simple; it has that raw emotional awareness that so many films lack these days.  The story is simple yet so complex when you take into consideration the realty of the situation.  This man, Antonio Ricci, is just trying to provide for his family.  With jobs scarce he is relying on his bicycle (which he went through pains to get) in order to keep his job and put food on his family's table.  When his bicycle is stolen he and his young son walk the streets of Rome in search of the thief.  That is it, in a nutshell, but what a nutshell.  The film takes this man's struggle and makes it a part of the viewer.  We can feel the pain and turmoil that comes from acknowledging defeat.  What is so poignant here though is the fact that film remains brutally honest, never once creating a faux sense of self-righteousness.  Antonio is certainly a victim; but as the films finale proves, he is not a saint.UGH.Director Vittorio De Sica made a brave yet richly rewarding casting decision in his two leads.  Both Lamberto Maggiorani (who looks an awful lot like Daniel Day-Lewis) and Enzo Staiola were not actors.  The studio wanted Cary Grant for the lead, but De Sica decided to cast unprofessional's, which could have seemed like suicide, but in the end served as one of the films greatest selling points.  Both Maggiorani and Staiola bring such realism to their performances, realism that could not come from trained acting.  This is raw, deep, powerful and emotional connection to a situation, a situation that may have been very, very real to these two individuals.  Maggiorani carries Antonio with such defeated realism, and young Staiola is such a wonderful breath of adolescent adoration.  The way he follows his father around, consistently hopeful, is just marvelous; and his face as the final few moments are unveiled; I mean, just ""WOW"".One thing I really liked about this film is the texture.  By that I mean that the film has a very grainy, rough appeal to it.  It actually looks to me like a silent film, complete with the cracks in the film and the frequent pops (that wonderful white noise reminiscent of your parent's record player).  I love this feel because it adds realism to the film, taking you back to, not just an era in history but an era in cinema.  In fact, this is one of those rare films that could double as a silent film, for words are secondary to the actual expressions portrayed on the faces of everyone involved.Watch it with sound, but then watch it without and you'll see what I mean.`Ladri di Biciclette' (`The Bicycle Thief' or, more appropriately `Bicycle Thieves') is a marvelous film, one that will stay with you for a long time.  I am astounded by this masterpiece and highly, highly recommend it to any and everyone who is willing to watch it.  You will not be disappointed.  When that final blow comes across in the films final frames you will realize that in life happy endings are hard to come by.",5,A rarity among cinema; utter perfection...,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,3309,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'leave', 'speechless', 'closing', 'Ladri', 'di', 'Biciclette', 'one', 'films', 'last', 'few', 'seconds', 'left', 'utterly', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'so', 'much', 'literally', 'uttered', 'word', 'wow', 'just', 'sat', 'few', 'seconds', 'saying', 'again', 'time', 'louder', 'WOW', 'Why', 'may', 'ask', 'film', 'leave', 'feeling', 'answer', 'simple', 'raw', 'emotional', 'awareness', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'lack', 'days', 'story', 'simple', 'yet', 'so', 'complex', 'when', 'take', 'consideration', 'realty', 'situation', 'man', 'Antonio', 'Ricci', 'just', 'trying', 'provide', 'family', 'jobs', 'scarce', 'relying', 'bicycle', 'went', 'pains', 'get', 'order', 'keep', 'job', 'put', 'food', 'family', 'table', 'When', 'bicycle', 'stolen', 'young', 'son', 'walk', 'streets', 'Rome', 'search', 'thief', 'nutshell', 'what', 'nutshell', 'film', 'man', 'struggle', 'part', 'viewer', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'turmoil', 'acknowledging', 'defeat', 'What', 'so', 'poignant', 'here', 'fact', 'film', 'brutally', 'honest', 'never', 'once', 'creating', 'faux', 'sense', 'self-righteousness', 'Antonio', 'certainly', 'victim', 'films', 'finale', 'proves', 'not', 'saint.UGH.Director', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'made', 'brave', 'yet', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'casting', 'decision', 'two', 'leads', 'Lamberto', 'Maggiorani', 'who', 'awful', 'lot', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Enzo', 'Staiola', 'were', 'not', 'actors', 'studio', 'wanted', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'lead', 'De', 'Sica', 'decided', 'cast', 'unprofessional', 'could', 'have', 'seemed', 'suicide', 'end', 'served', 'one', 'films', 'greatest', 'selling', 'points', 'Maggiorani', 'Staiola', 'bring', 'such', 'realism', 'performances', 'realism', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'trained', 'acting', 'raw', 'deep', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'connection', 'situation', 'situation', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'two', 'individuals', 'Maggiorani', 'Antonio', 'such', 'defeated', 'realism', 'young', 'Staiola', 'such', 'wonderful', 'breath', 'adolescent', 'adoration', 'way', 'father', 'around', 'consistently', 'hopeful', 'just', 'marvelous', 'face', 'final', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'unveiled', 'mean', 'just', 'WOW', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'texture', 'mean', 'film', 'very', 'grainy', 'rough', 'appeal', 'actually', 'silent', 'film', 'complete', 'cracks', 'film', 'frequent', 'pops', 'white', 'noise', 'reminiscent', 'parent', 'record', 'player', 'love', 'feel', 'realism', 'film', 'taking', 'back', 'not', 'just', 'era', 'history', 'era', 'cinema', 'fact', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'could', 'double', 'silent', 'film', 'words', 'are', 'secondary', 'actual', 'expressions', 'portrayed', 'everyone', 'involved.Watch', 'sound', 'then', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean.', 'Ladri', 'di', 'Biciclette', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'more', 'appropriately', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'marvelous', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'am', 'astounded', 'masterpiece', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'who', 'willing', 'watch', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'When', 'final', 'blow', 'films', 'final', 'frames', 'will', 'realize', 'life', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'hard', 'come']",The Bicycle Thief VHS

I havent seen a film in a while where everything going on translates in such a meaningful way, and I give credit here to the filmmakers, but especially the acting.In many films I ve seen that are subtitled it takes me a couple of viewings to really get a strong concept of the story and the characters since much of the time is spent reading text and not concentrating fully on every little nuance.  Film being a powerful visually as it is, much of the great acting out there can be accomplished with subtlties and the great actors will have as much going on in their reactions as they do in they dialogue.  This is certainly no exception, and the acting in this film is tip top.  But, after one viewing, I had a great feeling as to what the film wanted to convey.  And thats with a brief nap in the middle of the film (one I take full responsibility for, due to a full stomache and a short night of sleep)!In sum, it is an amazingly powerful film that demonstrates the hardships and struggles of a postwar country and really makes you feel each and every hiccup in these peoples lives.

It was made in almost guerrilla-type fashion in 1947 amidst the deprivations and devastation of post World War II Italy.  Most of the people appearing in the film aren't real actors. Director Vittorio De Sica utilizes Rome's populace to fill the screen with people rushing en masse to and fro to simply make ends meet.  You get a tremendous sense of how flat on its back Italy was after its devastating and total defeat as an Axis power.So, for such a classic, why the four stars? Well, because the quality of the presentation is simply abysmal.

441749,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,6304963173,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","It took a special director to shake the Academy Awards voting panel awake and make them take notice of great foreign films.  Vittorio de Sica did this with Shoeshine, one of the early Neorealismo films (the same year Rome: Open City was released - which is actually considered the first Neorealismo film).  In 1947 the Academy awarded Shoeshine a special/honorary Oscar for best foreign film.  Two years later the Academy would again award de Sica, this time for Bicycle Thieves.One of the most important elements of this film was de Sica's decision to use only untrained actors (ironically, many went on to appear in later films).  Hence the neo-realistic style.  Other trademarks were (and probably most importantly) stories depicting the struggles of the lower class, the working classes, or the poor.  Also, de Sica shot almost exclusively on location (not using sets). There is a heavy dose of existentialism in this style as well.  So why is this film so important?Rome Open City really centered around the events taking place in Rome during World War 2.  It was set in a specific time with events that could have only taken place during that time.  Bicycle thieves on the other hand, is a story that could easily be applied to many times, many place, and many people.  The allure of this film is the honest and open look at humanity and their struggles.The film itself is solid.  The pace is moderate, but rarely does the film seem slow.  And it is really only in comparison to later films that the viewer really sees anything that could be improved upon.  Especially when comparing the film to the later Fellini and Antonioni films.  De Sica was influenced greatly by previous filmmakers (especially Chaplin), and it shows in this film with several shots.  And of course de Sica would leave a lasting impression that would influence filmmakers for decades, and even until today.Oh and if you can't tell by the title, the film is about a gang of bicycle thieves.  Antonio Ricci is worker trying to secure a job.  He does get an offer, only he must have a bicycle to perform his duties.  His wife pawns several belongings in order to pay back the pawn shop to get his bike out of hock.  During the first few days of his job, his bike is stolen.  Ricci then sets out to find his bicycle, knowing that without it he will lose his job.  In the next day we follow Ricci on his search along with his son.  Ricci seems to find the person who stole his bike, but due to circumstances, can do nothing about it.  The system breaks down for Ricci.  In the end Ricci has a moral choice with major repercussions: does he then steal someone else's bicycle thereby becoming a thief himself and causing another individual to go through the same turmoil he recently experienced?  It's an open ended experience (I won't tell you what happens), and no matter which choice he made the viewer would undoubtedly understand the long term effect here.  One person steals from another who then steals from another and so on.  Where does the cycle end?Philosophical, thought provoking, and beautifully filmed, Bicycle Thieves is a stellar film.  The Criterion re-release is amazing.  This is perhaps not a film everyone should own, but a film that all fans of 1945-1965 cinema should at least watch once.",5,"4 stars as a film, 5 stars for how this film changed cinema forever~",1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,3285,"['took', 'special', 'director', 'shake', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'voting', 'panel', 'awake', 'make', 'take', 'notice', 'great', 'foreign', 'films', 'Vittorio', 'Sica', 'did', 'Shoeshine', 'one', 'early', 'Neorealismo', 'films', 'same', 'year', 'Rome', 'Open', 'City', 'was', 'released', 'actually', 'considered', 'first', 'Neorealismo', 'film', '1947', 'Academy', 'awarded', 'Shoeshine', 'special/honorary', 'Oscar', 'best', 'foreign', 'film', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Academy', 'would', 'again', 'award', 'Sica', 'time', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves.One', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'film', 'was', 'Sica', 'decision', 'use', 'only', 'untrained', 'actors', 'ironically', 'many', 'went', 'appear', 'later', 'films', 'neo-realistic', 'style', 'Other', 'trademarks', 'were', 'probably', 'most', 'importantly', 'stories', 'depicting', 'struggles', 'lower', 'class', 'working', 'classes', 'poor', 'Also', 'de', 'Sica', 'shot', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'location', 'not', 'using', 'sets', 'heavy', 'dose', 'existentialism', 'style', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'important', 'Rome', 'Open', 'City', 'really', 'centered', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'Rome', 'World', 'War', '2', 'was', 'set', 'specific', 'time', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'taken', 'place', 'time', 'Bicycle', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'applied', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'place', 'many', 'people', 'allure', 'film', 'honest', 'open', 'look', 'humanity', 'struggles.The', 'film', 'solid', 'pace', 'moderate', 'rarely', 'film', 'seem', 'slow', 'really', 'only', 'comparison', 'later', 'films', 'viewer', 'really', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'improved', 'Especially', 'when', 'comparing', 'film', 'later', 'Fellini', 'Antonioni', 'films', 'De', 'Sica', 'was', 'influenced', 'greatly', 'previous', 'filmmakers', 'especially', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'several', 'shots', 'course', 'Sica', 'would', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'would', 'influence', 'filmmakers', 'decades', 'even', 'today.Oh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'title', 'film', 'gang', 'bicycle', 'thieves', 'Antonio', 'Ricci', 'worker', 'trying', 'secure', 'job', 'get', 'offer', 'only', 'must', 'have', 'bicycle', 'perform', 'duties', 'wife', 'pawns', 'several', 'belongings', 'order', 'pay', 'back', 'pawn', 'shop', 'get', 'bike', 'hock', 'first', 'few', 'days', 'job', 'bike', 'stolen', 'Ricci', 'then', 'out', 'find', 'bicycle', 'knowing', 'will', 'lose', 'job', 'next', 'day', 'follow', 'Ricci', 'search', 'son', 'Ricci', 'find', 'person', 'who', 'stole', 'bike', 'due', 'circumstances', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'system', 'down', 'Ricci', 'end', 'Ricci', 'moral', 'choice', 'major', 'repercussions', 'then', 'steal', 'someone', 'else', 'bicycle', 'thereby', 'becoming', 'thief', 'causing', 'individual', 'go', 'same', 'turmoil', 'recently', 'experienced', 'open', 'ended', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'matter', 'choice', 'made', 'viewer', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'understand', 'long', 'term', 'effect', 'here', 'One', 'person', 'steals', 'who', 'then', 'so', 'Where', 'cycle', 'end', 'Philosophical', 'thought', 'provoking', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'stellar', 'film', 'Criterion', 're-release', 'amazing', 'perhaps', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'own', 'film', 'fans', '1945-1965', 'cinema', 'should', 'least', 'watch', 'once']",The Bicycle Thief VHS
441750,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6304963173,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 3]","Vittorio De Sica's The Bicycle Thief (Ladri Di Biciclette), made in 1948, in black and white, is one of the all time great films, and, in its Neo-realistic cinema verit&eacute; simplicity, it shows how utterly creatively bankrupt most filmmaking these days is. And by that I mean worldwide, not just the obvious flaws of the Hollywood crap factory. Lean, spare, poetic- it tells one story, but tells it very well, and that story becomes universal, and is applicable to all people who have ever suffered, or been driven to do desperate things. Its screenplay is deceptively slight, but that does not mean it is not great. Oftentimes, it is assumed that a great screenplay must be witty like Woody Allen films, deep like Ingmar Bergman films, or characteristically complex like Robert Altman films, but great screenplays can also be the antithesis of those things. A great screenplay may be like that in Stanley Kubrick's for 2001: A Space Odyssey, full of symbolism writ large, and on the other hand, it can be like The Bicycle Thief, which is symbolic precisely because it is so intensely personal.The film is almost pitch perfect from beginning to end, yet, as often happens, something is lost in the translation of its title, Ladri Di Biciclette, which literally means Bicycle Thieves, but in America is known as The Bicycle Thief. The original title is more literally true, as both the `real' thief and Antonio, steal bikes, and it also allows for a deeper look at their differing motivations. When we see the original thief's one room apartment- with mother and two other siblings- we see that he, too, is poor, and we have to wonder if he is Antonio on the future, with just a bit more desperation. Yes, he's obviously a skilled con man, but he may have started out pure, as well. This deeper look is lost in the Americanized title, for while technically Antonio is a thief, he is truly forced into it, lest his family will be even more degraded, while the young thief is likely merely using external circumstances to justify his black soul. De Sica wisely does not opt out for that simplistic end, though, for we still have the contrast between the professional thief, and the rank amateur, Antonio.Many critics have reduced this film to De Sica's supposed refutation of a simple false dualism- that De Sica is merely trying to show good and evil are relative, but the film clearly is NOT doing that, for we know, all along, that the young professional thief would likely be a con man regardless. All of his neighbors are cheats and liars, as he has likely been accused many times before, and even his mother lies for her manifestly guilty son. De Sica recognizes that there IS good and evil, but that sometimes an act that appears evil- such as thievery, can be born of different circumstances; pure evil and greed, as in the case of the young thief, and mere desperation, as with Antonio. Ironically, many of the critics who chide viewers for their supposed biases against the young thief, show their own biases in wholly missing De Sica's actual point- which is not to show that there are differing reasons for similar acts, but that the reasons CAN be night and day, yet still be confused, and that usually, and regardless, it is the honest who are screwed either way.Even worse, are those stolid critics with a political ax to grind. Marxists somehow got it into their heads that Antonio, who is clearly shown as living in squalor, is a member of the bourgeoisie, simply because he wears a fedora, not a cap, or because his wife has clean bedsheets, thus when he gets a job, it is symbolic of governmental favoritism for an elite class, and the young bike thief, who wears a German hat, is a member of the international proletariat, although he clearly is a member of the criminal class, and in that conflation much of Marxist theology bogs down. The theft of Antonio's bike is therefore claimed as a revolutionary act, and his lying neighbors are just good workers defending a comrade. That Antonio is left bereft, at film's end, to Marxists, symbolizes a perverse justice. To point out all the ridiculous flaws in such super-simplistic ideas would waste time, but, clearly, the only reason such absurd claims were made were because the screenwriter, Cesare Zavattini, who adapted the film from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, was a member of the Italian Communist Party, at the time. Interestingly, the film has also been seen as a very Conservative film, praised by Christian groups and even William F. Buckley's The National Review, not because it delineates good and evil, as described above, but because they see it as a refutation of Marxist ideals, in that Antonio and the other laborers do not find work degrading, but a fundament of their self worth; so much so that when the young thief kyboshes Antonio's ability to gain that self respect, he loses all hope, and is reduced to dishonesty himself.Neither reductivist outlook adequately deals with the many subtleties and nuances this great film portrays, and the fact that The Bicycle Thief is shorn of Freudian psychobabble and preaching is one of its strengths. Yet, it is not pure cinema, either, as many European critics have labeled it. Although the visuals convey the milieu well, they do not get inside the characters. This is where the writing and acting ability of Maggiorani and Staiola works magic. Great art is simply not so easily reducible as political panderers want it to be, and one can be thankful for that, lest The Bicycle Thief would not be what it is, nor would we still be watching it with such easy appreciation for its simple virtues.",5,Great,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,5627,"['Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'Ladri', 'Di', 'Biciclette', 'made', '1948', 'black',

441751,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,6304963173,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[3, 5]","View this film as if you are reading a novel by Kafka and you will discover the mansions of meaning within this seemingly simple story.He loses to a thief the most valuable possession of his starving family, that possession which will assure his family of food and shelter, without which they will certainly starve and fall into the deep immorality which surrounds them. Postwar and devastated and dysfunctional Rome is but a symbol for our society today. Read it as you would Kafka's Trial.The law offers absolutely no hope, neither at the police station which can only file the report in a truly Kafkaesque scene, nor when the victim captures the thief. The Police Officer, well familiar with these situations, can only reveal the truth about the legal system, which is not good. Another police officer, perhaps on the take, perhaps concealed the true serial number of a bike frame in question.The Church as well offers no hope during a long and torturous sequence. It appears often to be one of those Protestant sects which tried to buy Irish Catholic starving waifs with soup and a song, but turns out to be infact a Catholic Church on a self righteous mission to save poor souls, never meeting them as persons and equals with feelings and minds and individual hardships. Watch this attentively and despair and repent and do better.This movie is truly the most painful and profound and inexorable film I have seen. After several years of attempt, last night I finally watched it all the way through. As in other films and stories which end so tragically we pray later for a happy if unconvincing ending. The victim of the second theft recognizes Ricci has enough trouble, and presses no charges, not out of despair for the legal system as did Ricci, but out of kindness. How much infinitely kinder it might have been for him to sell him that bicycle for half of the few hundred lira left to him family merely as a token to preserve his dignity, but how unbelievable that ending would have been, despite the cheers and tears it would unavoidably evoke. Instead we are left with the deepest despair, a father utterly humiliated, powerless and morally compromised before his worshipful and loving son. Thus are we compelled irresistably to create our own resolution. See this film. Give your bicycle to the poor, as Jesus commanded.There is no ready made Hollywood happy ending here. There is no deus-ex-machina provided for our convenience and comfort. We must examine ourselves and find peace with this tale of deep tragedy, a tale which reflects accurately the history of tragic drama, from Oedipus to King Lear to Hamlet. As Aristotle's unities it nods at a unity of time and place and action. As the epics it subtly presents the dynamics from father to son. As Ricci wanders about Rome we recall Odysseus and his son, Oedipus and his father, Hamlet and his father, the Russian novelists, DH Lawrence, James Joyce and in particular Ulysses's explicit examination of the theme of fathers and sons.Here the relationship of father and son is so subtly presented and underplayed as to appear elusive, yet it touches the profundities found most clearly in ancient Greek drama. The marvelous, modern acting makes this foundational subtext almost invisible. Long before Duvall or Brando, in the forties, watch this main star engage us with very real and subtle and underplayed acting necessary for the big screen, not for theatre but for neo-realism. With one briefly clutched jaw muscle whole volumes go unspoken but to those who have eyes and ears. This appears thus not theatre but near documental reality, placed in a devastated social landscape so simple it seems universal. Thus we feel most directly and intimately and personally the epic dynamics at work, all done so casually as to be missed by those who cannot see. I on the other hand had to try five times over some decades to be able to watch this movie all of the way through, most often pausing at the boy's mozarrella eating contest, or the church mission. It is far too intense, the waters passing unheard and unseen underground. Watch them pass, how the father grows from a casual negligence of his son to realizing too late how very much he means to him. If only the father had brought his son to work with him to watch the bibcyle rather than leaving him that day to earn tips at the gas station, rather than dragging him along too late to search for the stolen bicycle and observe his downfall and humiliation.Let's come up for air. Notice the influence this film has not only on modern actors as mentioned, but also on modern film-makers such as most famously Woody Allen. The entire Santora sequence here is parodied fully in his best filmBroadway Danny Rose, just as from another early Da Sicca film he steals the large twins at the buffet table.This is the truly greatest film ever made and the most difficult to view. The Criterion edition is the one to have, with extras, as well as their new edition ofWalker - Criterion Collection, but just for fun. Other essential films to have at home include of courseGrand Illusion - Criterion Collection,Seven Samurai - 3 Disc Remastered Edition (Criterion Collection Spine # 2),Rashomon - Criterion CollectionandThrone of Blood - Criterion Collectionand so many others. But please, if you can endure it, begin with this very simple and most profound and horrible tale of post-war tragedy and post-apocalyptic poverty. Like poetry it reads on its surface simply; like poetry it bears measureless, unknown, avoided depth in the heart of everyone who sees it with eyes wide open.",5,MAY WE REMAIN MORAL IN AN IMMORAL SOCIETY?

I am tired of any film that espouses this message.The parents, two of the film's main characters, had their entire life devolve into insane desperation, including violence against their older child, over the loss of a stinking bicycle, and yet they, within the past year, felt themselves ready to have. . .a second child?  Naturally the film makes no mention of that.  Hardly any film today would either.  It's the pink elephant in the living room.The back of the film's DVD case says that this film is distinguished by its ""emotional clarity, social righteousness, and brutal honesty.""  Well, in part it is, but only to the degree that it doesn't offend our precious conventional denial.

Its importance as a film that ushered in a new genre of art, its importance as a postwar piece...all of the notoriety that has arisen around the film is secondary to one thing: powerful storytelling.  THE BICYCLE THIEF tells a moving story about the relationship of fathers and sons, a moving story about desperation and loss, a moving story that could have been located in any time period, amidst any external conflicts.I won't elaborate much on the plot: others have done so, but the truth of the matter is that the plot is exceedingly simple.  It simply does not matter.  Instead, this movie focuses on understated character and the ways in which external forces force different characters into trying circumstances.This film will leave you feeling drained and contemplative.  It is not a ""pick me up"" kind of film.  Watch it with the right attitude and you will be moved, guaranteed.  I do have one minor complaint: the DVD transfer on this edition is not the best.  I've seen worse, admittedly, but one would think that with such a classic film they would have gone to greater lengths to preserve its quality.

Four years after WWII, the Italian people are struggling to get back on their feet. The country is in ruins from bombs and loss of lives on and off the battlefield.Antonio and Bruno both ride their bicycles to work. Unfortunately children Bruno's age had to scrape money so families like his can put food in their mouths and clothes on their back. While Antonio is plastering posters on the concrete walls, an unsuspecting passserby steals his bike. Antonio and his son are on a quest to look for the bicyle that he needs to work. Without his bicyle, he can't work, and without work, he isn't able to provide for his family.The Bicycle Thief is a sad story because people are struggling to survive the aftermath of WWII. The bike that was stolen could have been sold for parts or needed for transportation and work. The search for Antonio's bike is futile and hopeless. No one seems to know where his bicycle has gone to.

441757,A3LEJ7UEJQDQNA,6304963173,Eddy Oquendo,"[105, 114]","A classic of world cinema, &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; deals with postwar Italian circumstances with searing impact. Some of the elements may remind you of &quot;It's A Wonderful Life,&quot; but let's just say: Frank  Capra it ain't! This work is uncompromising, and, as famed playwright  Arthur Miller put it, &quot;remorseless.&quot; It's a wake-up call,  effectively arguing that good, sound minded people can be morally destroyed  by obsession and despondency; that what is of no consequence to many is  vital to some. Don't jump into buying this movie on the opinions of those  who love it; it's not for everyone's taste. Rent it first. If you're  looking for &quot;entertainment,&quot; look elsewhere. But if you value  artistically fine movies that address harsh realities, you will be bowled  over by this poignant, involving look into one man's snowballing  desperation. This film is a friend for life if you appreciate it!This  DVD version of an important film is terrible. Image Entertainment usually  makes good digital transfers, and this disc is no exception. But the cause  of my gripe isn't the transfer, it's the print used. The copy that Image  offers on this DVD is in DESPERATE need of restoration. There are all  manner of imperfections in this print -- blotches, streaks, jumps  (sometimes for several frames!), scratches, etc. This makes for a visual  and audio shadow of a great movie. As if this weren't bad enough, the  subtitles are poor. Too many words are left out in the translation, and the  subtitles sometimes come late in relation to the dialogue. On the other  side of the ledger, the English dub is excellently done (except for a brief  section late in the film, seemingly due to the print). The voices are  expertly in sync with the lip movement, and dramatic consistency is  achieved by what appear to be Italian actors.Since there are no special  features to speak of on the DVD, I'll share some facts about this film that  aren't included on the disc. David O. Selznick (producer of &quot;Gone With  The Wind&quot;) is reported to have offered backing to &quot;The Bicycle  Thief,&quot; on condition that Carey Grant play the father. The star,  Lamberto Maggiorani, was actually a steel factory worker. When he was done  with the film, he went back to work at the factory. There he became  somewhat unpopular with his co-workers, who were apparently envious of his  newfound fame and fortune. Soon thereafter, he found himself unemployed.  The little boy, played by Enzo Staiola, was discovered in a crowd watching  work on the movie.",4,Thief of hearts,959817600,"06 1, 2000",2000,2576,"['classic', 'world', 'cinema', 'quot', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'quot', 'deals', 'postwar', 'Italian', 'circumstances', 'searing', 'impact', 'elements', 'may', 'remind', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'ai', ""n't"", 'work', 'uncompromising', 'famed', 'playwright', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'put', 'quot', 'quot', 'wake-up', 'call', 'effectively', 'arguing', 'good', 'sound', 'minded', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'morally', 'destroyed', 'obsession', 'despondency', 'what', 'consequence', 'many', 'vital', 'Do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'buying', 'movie', 'opinions', 'who', 'love', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'Rent', 'first', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'quot', 'elsewhere', 'value', 'artistically', 'fine', 'movies', 'address', 'harsh', 'realities', 'will', 'be', 'bowled', 'over', 'poignant', 'involving', 'look', 'one', 'man', 'snowballing', 'desperation', 'film', 'friend', 'life', 'appreciate', 'DVD', 'version', 'important', 'film', 'terrible', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'usually', 'good', 'digital', 'transfers', 'disc', 'exception', 'cause', 'gripe', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'print', 'used', 'copy', 'offers', 'DVD', 'DESPERATE', 'need', 'restoration', 'are', 'manner', 'imperfections', 'print', 'blotches', 'streaks', 'jumps', 'sometimes', 'several', 'frames', 'scratches', 'etc', 'visual', 'audio', 'shadow', 'great', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'subtitles', 'are', 'poor', 'Too', 'many', 'words', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'translation', 'subtitles', 'sometimes', 'come', 'late', 'relation', 'dialogue', 'other', 'side', 'ledger', 'English', 'dub', 'excellently', 'done', 'brief', 'section', 'late', 'film', 'seemingly', 'due', 'print', 'voices', 'are', 'expertly', 'sync', 'lip', 'movement', 'dramatic', 'consistency', 'achieved', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'Italian', 'actors.Since', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'share', 'facts', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'included', 'disc', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'producer', 'quot', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'quot', 'reported', 'have', 'offered', 'backing', 'quot', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'quot', 'condition', 'Carey', 'Grant', 'play', 'father', 'star', 'Lamberto', 'Maggiorani', 'was', 'actually', 'steel', 'factory', 'worker', 'When', 'was', 'done', 'film', 'went', 'back', 'work', 'factory', 'became', 'somewhat', 'unpopular', 'co-workers', 'who', 'were', 'apparently', 'envious', 'newfound', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Soon', 'thereafter', 'found', 'unemployed', 'little', 'boy', 'played', 'Enzo', 'Staiola', 'was', 'discovered', 'crowd', 'watching', 'work', 'movie']",The Bicycle Thief VHS

441761,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,6304963173,Gerard D. Launay,"[2, 2]","What distinguishes a great film from a very good one?  That is just about impossible for me to define. There is cinematography, sound, script, pacing....all those things.  But for me, what distinguishes a great film from a good one is the manner in which it teaches us about ourselves. Compare the black and white photography of Henri Cartier-Bresson with digital snapshots and you will understand what I mean.I will tell you this.  In 100 years, this film will still be relevant, even fresh.  In 100 years, William Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice"" will be fresh.  Why?  Because the themes and the articulation of those themes in their various mediums are timeless.Another reason this a great film? The director uses unprofessional actors who offer deeply personal performances that are so realistic.  (The father is a real steelworker in Italy...his son is played by an ordinary boy,  I can't imagine EVER forgetting Lamberto Maggiorani's face - that is how strong his portrayal is).  Quiet heroism, desperation, parent/child bonding, fear....this is what really happens.  And now that we are in a dangerous economic recession, the major theme of the movie resurfaces again. That theme is DIGNITY.  By that I mean dignity under trial...not in a trial in a court of law, but in a trial of the pressures of facing unemployment in an uncaring, urban world.  This was a post-war film.  Italy lost.  So many citizens who belong to the country that loses a war face bitter unemployment when the war is over.  The big generals and the politicians (usually) survive. But the others have to struggle and little choices can mean life or death decisions.Most people know the general plot of the film...but that is not what makes this film great. It is all in the details.  There is a touching scene when the father Antonio Ricci learns that he has lost his bicycle, yet he takes his young son to a restaurant, and they enjoy a meal of pasta and wine together. Just beautiful.  There is another scene in the rain when the man is standing between students for the priesthood and they talk around him as if he did not exist. Just the look of the students who are weak and girlish versus the man who is rough and proletariat makes a tremendous impression. There is also the scene where Antonio's wife makes the hard decision of sacrificing the sheets upon which the family sleeps to make just enough to help her husband get his bicycle out of the pawn shop; those sheets were her dowry...and the sacrifice is real and noble.One of the themes of the film is the world of feet versus the world on wheels.  All through the film we see trams and cars and buses and bicycles, and then we see the persons who walk and walk.  It is as if those who can affordtraveling by wheels are in a different class from those traveling by foot.  This was almost a Marxist film without any propaganda - at all.So for a film that is about reality, not dreams, you can do no better than choose this masterpiece. A final word about the Criterion version.  If you want to see this film, forget the other prints, and insist on the Criterion version...because the restoration is magnificent.  This time, it really makes a difference!",5,"Question: Recommend a ""Great Film.""

Sometime before, Ricci pawned his bicycle to feed his family.  His loyal wife pawns her sheets to obtain the money to get the bike back.

His desparation to recover his bike leads him to steal another man's bicycle.  He is caught and humiliated in front of his son, Bruno.  My favorite scene is where he takes his son into a restaurant with the little money he has.  They order a meager lunch.  Sitting next to them was a wealthy family.

441763,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,6304963173,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","It's great. It's perfect. It's as perfect as a crystal formed in weightless space. It's the purest distillation of Italian neorealismo, defined as ""a style of film set amongst the poor and working class, filmed on location using nonprofessional actors, depicting the difficult economic and moral conditions of post-World War II Italy, reflecting the conditions of everyday life: poverty and desperation."" There isn't a scene or a sound extraneous in ""Ladri di Bicicletti"". It's potently emotional without being in any way sentimental. The realism is absolute; one can say, yes, that was Life in that place and that time. But it's more than a documentation of poverty in post-war Roma; it's a universal story of the balance of needs between a father and a son. It doesn't preach any social agenda or ideology. It just reveals.The Roma I knew in the mid-1960s was already a 'boom town' compared to the Roma of Vittorio de Sica's 1948 ""Ladri di Bicicletti"". In 1948, the avenues were empty of cars and the banks of the Tiber were all weeds and rubble. There must have been tourists, but they didn't cross the bridges to Trastevere. In the '60s, the same streets were jammed with Fiat 500s and plagued with Vespas rather than bicycles, and today Trastevere is as gentrified as Brooklyn Heights or Boston's South End. But I can testify that the flea market at Porta Portese, on the back side of Trastevere, was exactly the same in 1968 as it's shown in the film. There's the real 'eternal city', though I understand that the flea market only happens on Saturdays now.Lamberto Maggiorani, the father in 'Bicycle Thieves', was a factory worker with no acting experience before ""Bicycle Thieves"". Even though the film made him modestly famous, he tried to return to factory work, only to find himself as unemployed as his film character. He took to acting as a career out of necessity, and performed in 15 more films from 1948 to 1970 .

One of them....The main character, Ricci, is chasing the man who knows the thief of his bike in church, he is totally erratic chasing this man everywhere, but the second he steps into church, almost out of habit he takes of his hat.Ricci's little boy Bruno is absolutely impeccable as well. He gives just the best performance, one can't even imagine.

Made in Italy by Vittorio De Sica it is a very beautifully written and directed film with a simple but compelling story. It is also a look at post-war Italy rebuilding itself after its defeat in WW II and the economic depression the country faced after the war. The story centers on one man, Antonio, who has been out of work for some time but suddenly is offered a job. There is one hitch to him getting this job however. He needs to have a bicycle to be able to get to work. No bike, no job. Problem for Antonio is he hocked his bicycle awhile back because his family needed the money. Because he is so poor Antonio doesn't have the money to get the bicycle out of the pawn shop. With help from his wife Antonio gets together the cash needed to get back his bike and start his new job the next day. Things start out fine for him on his new job putting up movie posters going from location to location on his bicycle. Then while at one spot up on a ladder putting up a poster a man walks by and steals Antonio's bike. Antonio gives chase but there is no way he can catch up to the thief taking off on his bicycle. Desperate to get his bicycle back Antonio tries everything, from going to the police to report the theft to going to a friend for advice and how he can get his bike back. His life and family depends on Antonio getting his bicycle back. Through it all Antonio is going through every emotion from desperation to despair and everything in between. The film looks at a man slowly losing his dignity as he faces the fact he is going to lose his job thanks to someone stealing his bike. Needing to provide for his family his dignity finally sinks so low Antonio resorts to trying to become a bicycle thief himself.There is nothing fancy or contrived about this movie. It is straightforward story of a man trying to provide for his family and what happens to him as he does. One factor that makes this movie so good is the actor who plays Antonio, Lamberto Maggiorani. Maggiorani gives a brilliant performance. He gets you to care about him and become involved in his story. What makes his performance even more remarkable is that while he has a presence about him that made Maggiorani look like he was a seasoned actor ""The Bicycle Thief"" was his acting debut. Even more remarkable still was that Maggiorani wasn't even an actor but a steel factory worker who was asked to play the lead part.If you are a fan of action movies then this won't be the film for you. This is not a fun entertainment kind of movie. This is a movie that looks at and explores human feelings and emotions. It looks at the realities of life and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This is a movie where the action doesn't come from guns being shot or explosions going off or fistfights with karate kicks and punches being thrown. If you want that kind of movie go buy ""The Expendables"". The action in ""The Bicycle Thief"" comes from the spoken word. This movie grabs you by the heart and makes you care about the main character and what is going to happen to him and his family and worry for him as he grows more despondent of his situation. This is a film in its most artistic form. And while action movies like ""The Expendables"" will leave no impressions on you as soon as it is over ""The Bicycle Thief"" will linger in your mind and make you never forget it. Everyone should see this movie at least once.

441771,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,6304963173,Jay Young,"[1, 1]","De Sica's great film ""Bicycle Thieves"" still holds up over 60 years after its release. In fact, many today in this recession will identify with the anguish of the main character.The plot of ""Bicycle Thieves"" is pretty simple- an unemployed man, Antonio Ricci, in post-War Rome, Italy gets a job putting up posters over the city. To do this job, he needs a bicycle, which he has to get by pawning his linens. Unfortunately, his bicycle is stolen, and the thief gets away. So Ricci looks all over Rome to try to find it, with his loyal son Bruno helping.After World War II, Italy was in a severe economic downturn. Millions were out of work, and were lucky to have food and a home, let alone a job. Automobiles were not yet widely available except to the very well-off, so a bicycle was the main form of personal transportation for most people. Having one's bicycle stolen would seem like the end of the world to most people, especially for those who had a job that required one, and could not afford to buy another.""Bicycle Thieves"" is probably the most famous film of the Italian Neo-Realist school of the late 40s. The Neo-Realists wanted to move beyond the immediate Post-WW2 euphoria and take a hard look at life as it really was, and used specific stylistic devices to this end. These are seen in Bicycle Thieves. For instance, the film is shot on location rather than in a studio, which was an innovation at the time. In addition, the main characters are not played by big-name actors, and all of the extras were real people. Further, this is a story about real people facing real situations. Ricci is not a Proletarian prop or an airbrushed comic character- he is a 3-dimensional person who really has hopes- and the way he acts out the dashing of those hopes is devestating.",5,Ladro!,1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,1781,"['De', 'Sica', 'great', 'film', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'still', '60', 'years', 'release', 'fact', 'many', 'today', 'recession', 'will', 'identify', 'anguish', 'main', 'character.The', 'plot', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'pretty', 'simple-', 'unemployed', 'man', 'Antonio', 'Ricci', 'post-War', 'Rome', 'Italy', 'job', 'putting', 'up', 'posters', 'city', 'do', 'job', 'bicycle', 'get', 'pawning', 'linens', 'Unfortunately', 'bicycle', 'stolen', 'thief', 'away', 'So', 'Ricci', 'Rome', 'try', 'find', 'loyal', 'son', 'Bruno', 'helping.After', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Italy', 'was', 'severe', 'economic', 'downturn', 'Millions', 'were', 'work', 'were', 'lucky', 'have', 'food', 'home', 'let', 'alone', 'job', 'Automobiles', 'were', 'not', 'yet', 'widely', 'available', 'very', 'well-off', 'bicycle', 'was', 'main', 'form', 'personal', 'transportation', 'most', 'people', 'Having', 'one', 'bicycle', 'stolen', 'would', 'seem', 'end', 'world', 'most', 'people', 'especially', 'who', 'had', 'job', 'required', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'buy', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'film', 'Italian', 'Neo-Realist', 'school', 'late', '40s', 'Neo-Realists', 'wanted', 'move', 'immediate', 'Post-WW2', 'euphoria', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'life', 'really', 'was', 'used', 'specific', 'stylistic', 'devices', 'end', 'are', 'seen', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'instance', 'film', 'shot', 'location', 'rather', 'studio', 'was', 'innovation', 'time', 'addition', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'played', 'big-name', 'actors', 'extras', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'Further', 'story', 'real', 'people', 'facing', 'real', 'situations', 'Ricci', 'not', 'Proletarian', 'prop', 'airbrushed', 'comic', 'character-', '3-dimensional', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'hopes-', 'way', 'out', 'dashing', 'hopes', 'devestating']",The Bicycle Thief VHS
441772,A3N7QVBNKU5S2M,6304963173,J. Brackett,"[3, 7]","This story begs the question: what would you do to support your family?  It forces the audience consider poverty and unemployment, issues that we must confront even today. As we sympathize with Antonio, possibly attempting to justify his actions in our mind, we must then analyze the young thief who stole Antonio's bike, the cause of our frustrations from the beginning of the film, and give him the same sympathy. Perhaps he was only trying to feed his family as well. Nevertheless, that didn't give him the right to steal another's livelihood, to put Antonio's family at risk. In the same way, Antonio's desperation doesn't give him the right to potentially put another man's family at risk by stealing his bike. Owning a bike becomes the conduit through which selfish survival instincts allow man to exploit man. It also leads us to ask questions like: Does one society's need justify the misuse of another society?  De Sica presents these questions to his audience by creating characters with which one can easily identify, and whose actions can be easily interpreted. It is through our reflections and interpretations that we can then know ourselves.The most respectable aspect of De Sica's film mastery is the way in which he gives the characters of The Bicycle Thief dignity and personal values despite their disadvantaged situation.

441773,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,6304963173,J. Friday,"[7, 20]","Note: I created another review but I didn't like it. So I created this new review to express my opinion more clearly.Post-WW2 Italy, 1947. Antonio has finally found a job. It requires putting up posters. But he needs a bike to do it. After selling his bedsheets to get his bicycle out of the pawnshop, he starts his job. At his first day at work, his bicycle is stolen. Antonio is crushed. He has a wife, a baby, and a son less than 10 yrs old to support. The only thing he can do is find his bike. So he and his young son Bruno go in search of the bicycle.Note: for a brief moment, I wondered why Ricci didn't borrow money for a new bike from friends or family. A bike costs 6,000 lira. His job has him making 12,000 lira a month. He was good for the money. Still, in movies, as in real life, people hardly ever take the most logical way. That's what makes movies and life so interesting. I guess watching this movie, it depends on the perspective you watch. In Africa, India, and China, for example, people live in worse conditions. I'm sure they would look at this movie and this post-WW2 Italy is a much preferable place to live; especially considering in Africa, China, and India, many people don't have access to electricity, clean water, and unemployment rates are as high as 80% or more. I guess it depends on the perspective a viewer has when watching this film.A few weeks after watching this film, my depression began to worsen. I was working in a box-making factory from 11pm to 7am Mon-Fri and I hated it. The job was a dead end. My love life was a dead end. My friends were drifting away and I had debts up to my eyeballs. My mother tried to lift me up but I didn't pay any attention to her. A little over a year after seeing the Bicycle Thieves for the first time I saw Nights of Cabiria. That film is about a nave prostitute who never gives up hope that her true love will come one day and bring her happiness. Throughout the movie she is ridiculed, ignored by potential lovers, and treated harshly. Still, she never gives up hope and goes on smiling in face of her troubles. After watching this movie, my depression began to lessen noticeably and I remembered my mother's words, ""If no one loves you. Then you must love yourself. If you do not have the patience to love yourself then why should you expect others to have the patience to love you?""I liked Nights of Cabiria for its emotionally uplifting tone. The main character has admirable strength and fortitude. She's a prostitute, in the lowest class of society, yet she not only believes she deserves a better life, she actively seeks one. One can only wish her good luck and thank her for her inspiring attitude. After Nights of Cabiria, I don't really care for the Bicycle Thieves. It was too dreary for my taste. Unfortunately, whenever people say this, the intellectuals are quick to pounce on your opinion, ""This movie is meant to make you think. If you want a lot of explosions then watch a typical Hollywood movie with the predictable happy ending.""The assessment that Hollywood movies always have a predictable happy ending is preposterous. Just look at these films: Psycho; Citizen Kane; Dirty Harry; The Hustler; The Wild Bunch; The Godfather Trilogy; The Postman Always Rings Twice; Carrie; Von Ryan's Express; Night if the Living Dead; Seven; Goodfellas; From Here to Eternity; The Killing; Usual Suspects; Rocky; Saturday Night Fever; The Shining; Planet of the Apes; Sweet Smell of Success; The Defiant Ones; Emperor of the North; The Swimmer; 21 Grams; etc.I just named 2 dozen Hollywood movies without predictable happy endings. I could name dozens more and most film buffs could too. Yet whenever a European movie gets the label of being dull, people are quick to contrast it with mainstream Hollywood and claim Hollywood is nonsensical and predictable. I never see people use this argument when comparing movies in other countries; it's always with European movies. Honestly, the movies coming from European countries are the bleakest, most depressing, dullest, and nihilistic stuff I've ever seen. I tend to see movies from all over the world too.Detractors of the Bicycle Thieves will label it dull and depressing. The lovers of the film will say it is intellectually stimulating. However, sometimes a dull movie is just a dull movie. Hollywood movies like Sweet Smell of Success and the Hustler didn't have explosions and the typical Hollywood happy ending. Yet I found those movies intellectually stimulating as well as emotionally uplifting. Can intellectuals stop saying things like, ""if you don't like intellectually stimulating movies then you should watch movies with mindless explosions like Transformers""? That kind of elitist comment turns people off more. Can't someone like Transformers and an intellectual movie like Citizen Kane?All in all, I don't recommend this movie. I recommend Nights of Cabiria instead. After watching Cabiria, I watched the Bicycle Thieves again. I couldn't stop shouting at the screen, ""Come on, Ricci. Be a man. Your wife and son have more hope than you do. You're supposed to be the father. Be strong and let everyone know things could be all right."" I couldn't believe it. I was actually shouting while watching this dreary movie. Cabiria has a protagonist that has unbreakable strength. It isn't macho, chest-beating bravado. It is quiet dignity that smiles bravely in the face of emotionally trying obstacles. It is an intellectually, emotionally stimulating movie that had a great impact on my life. I hope you'll pick that up instead and enjoy it.",1,Watch Nights of Cabiria instead,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,5586,"['Note', 'created', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'So', 'created', 'new', 'review',

441776,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6304963173,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[9, 10]","Vittorio De Sica's highly acclaimed film ""Bicycle Thieves"" (called for years, in America,""The Bicycle Thief"") is now presented in a superb transfer by The Criterion Collection. The film was released in 1949 and won a special Academy Award (the Best Foreign Film category didn't exist yet) and has lived on in ""Great Movie"" books and Top Movies of All Time Lists. Astoundingly, due to all its accolades, is a very simple film. It was made during the times of Italian neo-realism and many of the actors in the film aren't professional actors, including the lead role of Antonio (played by Lamberto Maggiorani). The setting is Rome, where jobs are scarce and many of the people live in poverty. Antonio's luck changes for the better when he finally gets a job hanging posters of Rita Hayworth up around town. Problem is, he needs a bicycle. He tells the man who gives him the job that he has one, but the truth is; he just pawned it to get food for his wife and two children. In order to retrieve his bike, his wife sells their bedsheets, and Antonio sets off to make some money. Then, suddenly, his bicycle his stolen and his whole world comes crashing down. Unable to do his job, he notifies the police who tell him that they can do nothing about it. So, he begins walking the streets of Rome with his son trying to find it. That's pretty much it; But the movie, in all of its simplicity, is so much more poetic and important. Despite not being a professional actor, Maggiorani gives one of the most memorable performances I've ever seen. Even the boy who plays his young son is unforgettable. The movie is filled with great scenes, such as the moment where Antonio spots the man who stole his bicycle and attempts to get it back, only to have the entire neighborhood gang up on him. Then there are the final scenes, where we realize that the actual title of the film ""Bicycle Thieves"" is much more appropriate than ""The Bicycle Thief."" To say ""Bicycle Thieves"" is a masterpiece would be an understatement. Many movies can be called masterpieces, but few films really embody the wonder of cinema.This movie is important, well made on all levels, it has aged well, and it's entertaining. We know that the latter doesn't always happen in ""great movies."" Anyone who wants to begin watching films that have shaped cinema over the course of the years can start anywhere from 'Citizen Kane' to 'Breathless' to 'Jules and Jim' to 'Pulp Fiction.'

The job requires that he must bring his bicycle, which, unfortunately, he has previously pawned so that his wife can buy food. She strips the beds and hocs all of the family linens, so that they can get the bike out. And so the man is able to get a paying job and thus a tenuous toe-hold up to a better life. But his hopes are dashed when a young man steals Ricci's bike on his first day on the job. With his young son in tow, he begins a mad hunt through the streets of Rome to find the bike and its thief. Along the way, the two encounter interesting adventures, and see many  bikes and bike parts, but never a trace of Ricci's red bike.  In the end he becomes overwhelmed with temptation to become a thief himself.  I especially enjoyed the brilliant way that Vittorio De Sica employs themes of irony and circularity in this movie.This film really highlights the plight of the masses of poor people in Italy at that time, and well illustrates how impossible it seems to get out of that poverty.  I was amazed when Mrs. Ricci pawns the bedlinens, at how the pawnshop clerk climbs up many shelves piled high with similar bundles. Quite a visual image! Apparently no one has sheets on their beds anymore.I also liked how De Sica self-references ""film"" within the film. This precious job which Ricci has landed is that of a movie poster-hanger. He is outfitted with a special little cap, and carries a long ladder and a big bucket of glue, along with his rolls of posters--quite a sight all-in-all. (There is some nice subtle humor here and there).  His trainer instructs him in the importance of gluing the posters up smoothly and neatly, with no bubbles or wrinkles. In concentrating on making sure that the posters are perfect, he losses sight of his bike for a minute and it is gone.  Later, another character in the film remarks, ""I am bored with movies, so I am stuck at home.""  It was like a little self-deprecating ironical comment about film.In all, I think that ""The Bicycle Thief"" is very interesting and deserving of it's reputation as an important classic film.

441780,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,6304963173,Kerry Walters,"[2, 3]","De Sica's ""Bicycle Thieves"" (plural, in the Italian) reminds us that hope takes many forms.  In the case of Antonio Ricci and his family, hope is a bicycle.  Ricci, one of the tens of thousands of unemployed workers in the Italian depression that followed WWII, finally gets a job in Rome as a sign-hanger.  But the job requires that he have a bicycle.  Ricci's bike is stolen his first day on the job, and he and his son Bruno embark on a fruitless search for it that occupies the bulk of the movie.  They come close to it once, but the bike--a symbol of hope--remains elusive.  Finally, in desperation, Ricci himself becomes a bicycle thief--but an unsuccessful one.  The film ends with a heartbreaking shot of Ricci's face, despairing, humiliated in front of his adoring son, and hopeless because futureless.Many commentators have focused on what they see as de Sica's moral theme:  that poverty and the despair it brings erodes moral fiber.  Ricci, the victim of robbery, himself stoops to robbery.  But I think this misses the broader point.  In a capitalist society, given the intensity of competition, the imperative to climb the social and economic ladder, and the merciless disregard for people who can't ""cut it,"" everyone necessarily becomes a thief (hence the plural ""thieves"" in the title) just to survive.  But only a handful--the movers and shakers, the beautiful people who live in penthouses and are relatively unaffected by the economic crises periodically churned up by the capitalist system--are successful at it.  The rest of us are losers.  We may succeed every once in awhile, but sooner or later either another loser, or the system itself, will come along and steal our bikes/futures/hopes.How can hope survive in a predatory society built along these lines, where almost everyone is a loser and even losers are thieves too?  This, I believe, is the real tragedy de Sica is exploring in this wonderful and sobering film.  In giving us the particular tragedy of the Ricci family, he points to a wider tragedy in which all of us are players.",5,"Big fish, little fish, loser fish, thief fish",1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,2063,"['De', 'Sica', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'plural', 'Italian', 'hope', 'many', 'forms', 'case', 'Antonio', 'Ricci', 'family', 'hope', 'bicycle', 'Ricci', 'one', 'tens', 'thousands', 'unemployed', 'workers', 'Italian', 'depression', 'followed', 'WWII', 'finally', 'job', 'Rome', 'sign-hanger', 'job', 'have', 'bicycle', 'Ricci', 'bike', 'stolen', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'son', 'Bruno', 'embark', 'fruitless', 'search', 'bulk', 'movie', 'come', 'close', 'once', 'bike', 'symbol', 'hope', 'elusive', 'Finally', 'desperation', 'Ricci', 'bicycle', 'thief', 'unsuccessful', 'one', 'film', 'heartbreaking', 'shot', 'Ricci', 'face', 'despairing', 'humiliated', 'front', 'adoring', 'son', 'hopeless', 'futureless.Many', 'commentators', 'have', 'focused', 'what', 'see', 'Sica', 'moral', 'theme', 'poverty', 'despair', 'moral', 'fiber', 'Ricci', 'victim', 'robbery', 'stoops', 'robbery', 'think', 'broader', 'point', 'capitalist', 'society', 'given', 'intensity', 'competition', 'imperative', 'climb', 'social', 'economic', 'ladder', 'merciless', 'disregard', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cut', 'everyone', 'necessarily', 'thief', 'hence', 'plural', 'thieves', 'title', 'just', 'survive', 'only', 'handful', 'movers', 'shakers', 'beautiful', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'penthouses', 'are', 'relatively', 'unaffected', 'economic', 'crises', 'periodically', 'churned', 'up', 'capitalist', 'system', 'are', 'successful', 'rest', 'are', 'losers', 'may', 'succeed', 'once', 'awhile', 'sooner', 'later', 'loser', 'system', 'will', 'come', 'along', 'steal', 'bikes/futures/hopes.How', 'can', 'hope', 'survive', 'predatory', 'society', 'built', 'lines', 'where', 'almost', 'everyone', 'loser', 'even', 'losers', 'are', 'thieves', 'too', 'believe', 'real', 'tragedy', 'Sica', 'exploring', 'wonderful', 'sobering', 'film', 'giving', 'particular', 'tragedy', 'Ricci', 'family', 'wider', 'tragedy', 'are', 'players']",The Bicycle Thief VHS
441781,AH4NKNB6TYXRE,6304963173,Kevin Barrack,"[6, 23]","This wasn't what I expected. I guess I expected some surprising plot twists or deep insight into human desperation or modern society. That's what the reviews and the official trailer (contained on this disc) would have me believe. Well, there is plenty of footage of human desperation, but really nothing surprising or insightful. People don't have jobs, a bike gets stolen, and you get the impression by the end that maybe thievery isn't such a rare thing in that place. You could say that some parallels are drawn between people suffering on both sides of the law and in different situations. In an artsy way you might find that interesting. Probably the most interesting aspect of the movie is the way that emotions and body language are portrayed by the actors. It is very genuine, good acting. So, if you can just get into the raw emotions it's perhaps a little interesting, except that for the most part there is only one emotion: desperation.The main problem I have is with the plot. Okay, so it's called ""The Bicycle Thief,"" so you know that a bike gets stolen. I thought the movie would show perspectives of both the thief and the victim perhaps, or that there is more to the thief than just stealing bicycles. Well, you never get to learn much about the thief. I won't give any more away, but basically the plot goes nowhere. Nothing much happens until basically the very end and even then I found it anticlimactic. The ending is totally unresolved. Basically, I spent the whole movie feeling anxious for the main character, gritting my teeth hoping things turn out for the best, and after and hour-and-a-half all I got for my nervous hope was a screen saying ""fine."" It's not just that the ending doesn't turn out for the best, it doesn't turn out for the worst either. It just isn't satisfying and it didn't make me stand up and say ""Whoa. That was incredibly deep!""All that said, maybe the point of this film is to linger on the details of everyday life, rather than address what is ostensibly the plot.

441786,ASHBFCUZAYCS4,6304963173,"Lord Schitsdain ""The sage of rage""","[1, 1]","On the surface, this is a film about a man desperate for work to support his family that upon getting hired, needs to pawn his bedding to get his bike out of hock for his new job. It is immediately stolen, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to get it back. Seems simple enough, but through the course of the film, you are witness to the desperation and abject poverty of the times, the struggle to maintain dignity and morals, and the seedy underbelly of society who's parasitic opportunism has dire consequences for their victims. The father takes his son to a nice restaurant for a proper meal and they are scorned by the millionaires living large while much of the population is barely surviving.The director adds an additional perspective to the importance of getting the bike back when we see the Father looking for his young son and he sees boats dragging the river for a drowned body. He fears his son may be dead. Losing a bike is one thing, but losing your only child would make it pale in comparison. His son is safe, but the point has been made. The father does the math for his son regarding how much money he can earn with his new job and how much it will mean to their standard of living, which is ultimately what's at stake, not the cost of a bike. It also means the difference between him feeling like a failure, and his being able to regain his dignity and provide for his family.The father is finally faced with the decision of whether or not to steal a bike so that he won't lose his job. He knows it is wrong, but his family's survival, his self-respect and the admiration of his son are all at stake. Maybe this moral dilemma is lost on modern society where the biggest crooks aren't stealing for survival, but are already billionaires working on Wall St., and kids illegaly download billions of dollars worth of music and videos that they don't need, without conscience. A heartfelt movie about family, character, and values these days is the equivalent of casting pearls before swine. At least some people see this film as something other than Pee Wee's Big Adventure.The final scene is powerful in it's simplicity. The father, hat in hand and head hung low knows that one simple act has reduced him to the level of the miscreants, his dreams for his family are dead, and worst of all he has lost respect in the eyes of his son who witnessed it all. The overwhelming shame and regret are palpable, all without uttering a word.

Take, for example, the scenario that instead of an unknown day laborer in the role of Antonio, de Sica had gone with David Selznick's suggestion of Cary Grant (which was a condition for the film getting funded through American studios).  I have no doubt that this would have remained an interesting film, and that Grant would have done an admirable job -- but it would have been a totally different film and would have lost the fragility and vulnerability and delicacy (combined with hardness and objectivity) that make this film so precious.  We can all be grateful that De Sica chose to wait for an Italian investor who allowed him to make the film the way he and Zappatini had planned.Without giving away anything of the plot, I will say that the conclusion of the film is one of the most powerful I have seen -- and carries an emotional weight that is earned rather than manipulated, and that can be compared only to a very few films: Chaplin's City Lights and Kiarostami's Close-up are the only films that come to mind.  De Sica strikes a very delicate balance between realistic depiction of the harsh realities of life in postwar Rome, and a humanistic vison of the resourcefulness of individuals in the face of hopelessness and the enduring power of empathy, forgiveness, and love.The film looks better than ever on this new Criterion edition -- it seemed to me that a few shots were a bit washed out but I can only assume that is due to the condition of the available negatives.  Spots and dust and other imperfections seem to have been removed entirely, and the subtitles are quite good and easy to read.  The film alone would make this set an essential one, but the booklet (containing some excellent essays, including a very illuminating essay by Andre Bazin) and attached documentaries (one on neorealsm, one on screenwriter Zappatini, and one on De Sica) make this set as a whole like a master course on one of the undisputed masterpieces of cinema.",5,There's a cure for everything ... except death,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,2508,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'release', 'dvd', 'not', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'release', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'refer', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'wisely', 'retranslated', 'Italian', 'new', 'Criterion', 'release', 'one', 'few', 'perfect', 'films', 'mean', 'film', 'own', 'way', 'just', 'should', 'be', 'lacking', 'nothing', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'even', 'apparent', 'missteps', 'tend', 'contribute', 'indelibly', 'overall', 'impression', 'film', 'nothing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'damaging', 'film', 'Take', 'example', 'scenario', 'instead', 'unknown', 'day', 'laborer', 'role', 'Antonio', 'de', 'Sica', 'had', 'gone', 'David', 'Selznick', 'suggestion', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'condition', 'film', 'getting', 'funded', 'American', 'studios', 'have', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'remained', 'interesting', 'film', 'Grant', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'admirable', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'fragility', 'vulnerability', 'delicacy', 'combined', 'hardness', 'objectivity', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'precious', 'can', 'be', 'grateful', 'De', 'Sica', 'chose', 'wait', 'Italian', 'investor', 'who', 'allowed', 'make', 'film', 'way', 'Zappatini', 'had', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'plot', 'will', 'say', 'conclusion', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'have', 'seen', 'emotional', 'weight', 'earned', 'rather', 'manipulated', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'only', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'Chaplin', 'City', 'Lights', 'Kiarostami', 'Close-up', 'are', 'only', 'films', 'come', 'mind', 'De', 'Sica', 'very', 'delicate', 'balance', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'harsh', 'realities', 'life', 'postwar', 'Rome', 'humanistic', 'vison', 'resourcefulness', 'individuals', 'face', 'hopelessness', 'enduring', 'power', 'empathy', 'forgiveness', 'love.The', 'film', 'better', 'ever', 'new', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'seemed', 'few', 'shots', 'were', 'bit', 'washed', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'due', 'condition', 'available', 'negatives', 'Spots', 'dust', 'other', 'imperfections', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'entirely', 'subtitles', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'easy', 'read', 'film', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'set', 'essential', 'one', 'booklet', 'containing', 'excellent', 'essays', 'including', 'very', 'illuminating', 'essay', 'Andre', 'Bazin', 'attached', 'documentaries', 'one', 'neorealsm', 'one', 'screenwriter', 'Zappatini', 'one', 'De', 'Sica', 'make', 'set', 'whole', 'master', 'course', 'one', 'undisputed', 'masterpieces', 'cinema']",The Bicycle Thief VHS

""The Bicycle Thieves"" is a white hot moral thriller where a series of bad decisions compound on one another from bad to worse and not stopping for ninety straight minutes showing that no matter how deep you are in the hole, you can always get deeper.  No matter how much you've lost, you can always loose something else, something much more valuable, something you do not appreciate until you have lost it.  While worrying about the wrinkles in a poster, Antonio looses the bicycle which is required for his livelihood.  In his desperate search to recover his stolen bicycle, he looses his decorum, his principles, and ultimately the respect of his son; he harms his marriage and his relationship to his son, perhaps irreparably; and he almost looses his son to a pedophile, to drowning, and then to speeding cars. To say any more would spoil the movie for you.

Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[13, 17]","Widely regarded as one of the great films of all time, The Bicycle Thief is easy to avoid because even a brief recitation of the plot is so depressing.In impoverished post-War Italy, men line up every day to see if the government has any work for them to do.  Ricci is told that there's a job for him,but it requires a bicycle, so his wife has to pawn her good linen in order to redeem the previously pawned bicycle.  As Ricci and his wife depart thepawnshop a clerk climbs several stories to add the linens to an immense stack, showing that their situation is hardly unique.  Despite this ignominy,Ricci is obviously overjoyed to be able to provide for his family and to redeem himself in the eyes of his precocious son, Bruno.Ricci's job consists of hanging posters and he needs the bicycle to transport a ladder around town. ...The film is probably the archetypal example of neo-realism, which eschewed fictional adventure in favor of the dramas of every day life.  And it wasunderstood in its day, and still is by many today, to be some kind of criticism of social inequality.  The suggestion being that in a more just society,wealth would be distributed more evenly and men wouldn't be reduced to this.  Yet the movie was also chosen for National Review's list of bestconservative films, so what gives?It seems fair to say that, regardless of the filmmakers original intent, what is portrayed on screen is one of the fundamental reasons that Marxismfailed so completely : Marx assumed that men resented laboring and found it degrading, but in Ricci we see illustrated the great truth that men definethemselves in large part by their work; not only are they not alienated from their labor, they are desperate to labor.  Nor does Ricci appear to be aman who wants a handout from those who have more than him.  Ricci does not seek equality; he seeks dignity, the dignity that earning a living willgrant him, particularly in the eyes of his son.  He appears to be a man who simply wants a job, and who is destroyed when opportunity is snatchedfrom his grasp.I said at the beginning that this is a film you want to avoid because it's depressing, but nothing can prepare you for its violence.  No, not blood andguts violence, but psychic violence.  In its own humble way, this is a slasher pic, but instead of a knife-wielding maniac slashing co-eds....  The violence hear is done to the soul of a man, a man who isdestroyed as his son looks on.

I've got to say that I'm going to have to side with those who call it a classic this time around.  More specifically, I've never before seen a neorealist film I would ever have called ""gripping"" and I've not seen any neorealist film as good since ""Roma, citta operta"".Let me quickly go through some of the myths and the more popular interpretations: it is true that the movie completely revolves around a man and his son searching for the man's stolen bicycle, but it is not true at all that there's nothing else to it.  More specifically, it's about the man's relationship with his son as a main theme and an exploration of post-war Rome as subtext.  It is true that it has quite a lot of communist themes placed through-out, but honestly those themes are entirely engulfed in the much more personal, tragic aspects of the movie.  The more poignant political commentary is in the way the plot works, where people are forced to own property--a certain type of property--in order to get a job and thus get more property.  Truly you can't blame the movie for that, because it has a point.What this movie is really good at is shifting the emotions of the viewers to match those felt by the protagonist Antonio Vicci.  The movie quickly establishes the importance of the bicycle and its emotional value to Vicci.  The search itself is desperate, but it is given depth by the relationship of Antonio to Bruno, his son.  As the two of them share a love for the bike and a need to retrieve it, they also share a shifting and dynamic relationship to each other that runs from full support to quiet alienation and everything in between.  The strongest moments in the film are the ones in which their relationship seem the most damaged.  The father eventually must depend on the son to share his pain.In terms of the concept of neorealism itself, it's debatable where this movie fits.  The most clear features of it are its focus on class struggle, a taste of the melodrama, and a plot lead on by a simple, singular desire.  However, the production values are much higher than the famed ""Roma, citta aperta"", and at this point de Sica is well established as an auteur working under the awareness of a more popular and mainstream international audience.  Genre debates aside, it's a strong film that well deserves its lasting appreciation, no matter how many people find it boring or disagree with its politics.--PolarisDiB",5,"Well deserving of its ""classic"" label",1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,2667,"['movie', 'strong', 'placement', 'annals', 'deemed', 'classics', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'check', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'neorealism', 'strangely', 'enough', 'lot', 'friends', 'opinions', 'respect', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'side', 'who', 'call', 'classic', 'time', 'around', 'More', 'specifically', ""'ve"", 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'neorealist', 'film', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'called', 'gripping', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'neorealist', 'film', 'good', 'Roma', 'citta', 'operta', '.Let', 'quickly', 'go', 'myths', 'more', 'popular', 'interpretations', 'true', 'movie', 'completely', 'around', 'man', 'son', 'searching', 'man', 'stolen', 'bicycle', 'not', 'true', 'nothing', 'else', 'More', 'specifically', 'man', 'relationship', 'son', 'main', 'theme', 'exploration', 'post-war', 'Rome', 'subtext', 'true', 'quite', 'lot', 'communist', 'themes', 'placed', 'through-out', 'honestly', 'themes', 'are', 'entirely', 'engulfed', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'tragic', 'aspects', 'movie', 'more', 'poignant', 'political', 'commentary', 'way', 'plot', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'own', 'property', 'certain', 'type', 'property', 'order', 'get', 'job', 'thus', 'get', 'more', 'property', 'Truly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'movie', 'point.What', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'shifting', 'emotions', 'viewers', 'match', 'felt', 'protagonist', 'Antonio', 'Vicci', 'movie', 'quickly', 'importance', 'bicycle', 'emotional', 'value', 'Vicci', 'search', 'desperate', 'given', 'depth', 'relationship', 'Antonio', 'Bruno', 'son', 'two', 'share', 'love', 'bike', 'need', 'retrieve', 'also', 'share', 'shifting', 'dynamic', 'relationship', 'other', 'full', 'support', 'quiet', 'alienation', 'everything', 'strongest', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'ones', 'relationship', 'seem', 'most', 'damaged', 'father', 'eventually', 'must', 'depend', 'son', 'share', 'pain.In', 'terms', 'concept', 'neorealism', 'debatable', 'where', 'movie', 'most', 'clear', 'features', 'are', 'focus', 'class', 'struggle', 'taste', 'melodrama', 'plot', 'lead', 'simple', 'singular', 'desire', 'However', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'famed', 'Roma', 'citta', 'aperta', 'point', 'de', 'Sica', 'well', 'established', 'auteur', 'working', 'awareness', 'more', 'popular', 'mainstream', 'international', 'audience', 'Genre', 'aside', 'strong', 'film', 'well', 'lasting', 'appreciation', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'find', 'boring', 'disagree', 'politics.', 'PolarisDiB']",The Bicycle Thief VHS
441802,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,6304963173,Pork Chop,"[3, 3]","LADRI DI BICICLETTE (1948) is a remarkable movie, mainly for thegenerosity of the director, in showing a large spectrum of humanemotions, and human circumstances, that reaches the core of thefeeling person, who is watching the picture in the theatre.It is also a clearly ideological movie, a working man's movie, thatmay  totally bore those living off their stock market investments andannuities, or from the revenue of well run real estate operations andsmall businesses.In 1948, post-war Italy is faced with millions  of able bodied,20-ish, 30-ish young, married men who simply cannot maintainthemselves in a large city the size of Rome, without the regularincome that only a job can provide. Political action is touched upon,as we hear a party organizer underline the need for a strong publicworks program, to provide needed jobs and pride to workers, deprivedof jobs and wages.Concretely, the zero-sum game that the average man is confrontedwith, is underlined. In this film, the individual has a wife and  2kids that must be fed, the rent paid and other living expensescovered and balanced out with earned income. Realistic aspects ofworkers is underlined, as they are shown using a bus, and in manycases and in this case, a bicycle to go to work.Thus, the story underlines that people have a right to work, a rightto a job. We have an 8 year old boy accompany his father's tormentsin trying to locate the thief who ran off with his only means oftransportation, thereby tugging on the spectators' heart-strings,from start to finish. As such, this is an ideological movie.Secondly, the poverty-stricken population of post-WW2 Italy isunderlined, as authentic ghettos of grown men, turn the streets intocrowded areas from one moment to the next, whenever there's a streetdisturbance. The man's wife doesn't blink, when she decides to sellher wedding linen to raise funds to recover the property from thepawn shop, that will make a job possible. At the same time, religionbinds the poor and the wealthy together as a unified population,during the weekly mass.Third, some lighter moments are brought into the picture, as theprotagonist, remembering his predicament, and  distressful financialsituation still celebrates life, taking time out, by taking his kidto a restaurant, for a meal, normally only visited by the affluentand wealthy. The more refined table manners of those folks than hisown kid are shown, and mocked a bit. The silliness of afortune-teller or clairvoyant is also shown, perhaps to draw aparallel to those believing in trickle-down economics, that byallowing the 1% of the rich to get even richer, that somehow some ofthat money will trickle down  to the needy, working man and woman,and solve the problems of millions of starving citizens. Thephenomenon of Sunday afternoon soccer is also underlined, which ischaracteristically European.Fourth, from a visual point of view, the movie shows plenty of goodtaste, and discernment in the filming locations.

441807,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6304963173,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 7]","The Bicycle Thief (Vittorio de Sica, 1948)One of the things I adore about Italian filmmakers is that they know how to end their movies. Whether it's completely understated (Michele Soavi's Dellamorte Dell'amore) or so over-the-top that ""cheesy"" doesn't even begin to describe it (Argento's Suspiria), you know that you're going to get some sort of reward for the build-up. The Bicycle Thief is no exception to the rule; you see the ending coming from a mile away, but that doesn't make it any less of a payoff.Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) is trying to get along in post-World War II Italy, where poverty is rampant. He lands a job hanging posters, for which he needs a bicycle. The family has to sell the bedsheets to get his out of the repair shop, but that's all right, innit? After all, he's making money now. Until, that is, on the morning of his first day on the job, his bicycle is stolen by one of the city's ubiquitous bicycle thieves. For the rest of the movie, Antonio, aided by his son Bruno (The Barefoot Contessa's Enzo Staiola) and some friends, goes looking for his bicycle and/or the guy who stole it. Antonio, consumed more and more by the random injustice of the thing and his frustration at the indifference of the rest of the world to his plight, finally hits bottom, with the expected results.Antonio is, at no point in this movie, the good guy. Even when he's on top of the world, having just gotten his bicycle out of hock, he berates his wife for stopping to visit a seer (in a scene that's actually one of the film's most suspenseful, since you know his bicycle's going to get stolen, you just don't know when). He berates the seer, yes, which later becomes an integral part of his character, but his wife as well, which is an integral part of his character right then. He's never all that good to his kid. He orders his friends around like Mussolini. When he gets frustrated, he takes the kid out for grilled cheese sandwiches and the two of them proceed to get plastered (allowing Antonio-- and De Sica-- a rumination on class structure, as the daughter of a wealthy patron of the restaurant catches Bruno's eye). All of this is, in a way, morbidly funny, and yet you know you're watching a tragedy, Antonio as low-rent Lear or Titus Andronicus. And Maggiorani-- who, despite having turned in (in his big-screen debut) one of the great performances in Italian film to that point, never landed anything more than a supporting role the rest of his life-- plays Antonio as if he knows Antonio is Andronicus, but not as if Antonio knows Antonio is Andronicus. That's great stuff, right there.I've been putting off watching this for years because, honestly, I had no idea why a movie about a bicycle thief would have captured the imagination of critics and the public alike. Well, now I know, and I have to tell you, they're right. This is a fascinating study of a man's slow descent into obsession, and it's well worth your time. ****",4,Wonderful.,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,2964,"['Bicycle', 'Thief', 'Vittorio', 'de', 'Sica', '1948', 'One', 'things', 'adore', 'Italian', 'filmmakers', 'know', 'how', 'end', 'movies', 'completely', 'understated', 'Michele', 'Soavi', 'Dellamorte', ""Dell'amore"", 'so', 'over-the-top', 'cheesy', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'Argento', 'Suspiria', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'sort', 'reward', 'build-up', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'exception', 'rule', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'payoff.Antonio', 'Ricci', 'Lamberto', 'Maggiorani', 'trying', 'get', 'along', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'Italy', 'where', 'poverty', 'rampant', 'job', 'hanging', 'posters', 'bicycle', 'family', 'sell', 'bedsheets', 'get', 'out', 'repair', 'shop', 'right', 'innit', 'making', 'money', 'now', 'morning', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'bicycle', 'stolen', 'one', 'city', 'ubiquitous', 'bicycle', 'thieves', 'rest', 'movie', 'Antonio', 'aided', 'son', 'Bruno', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'Enzo', 'Staiola', 'friends', 'looking', 'bicycle', 'guy', 'who', 'stole', 'Antonio', 'consumed', 'more', 'more', 'random', 'injustice', 'thing', 'frustration', 'indifference', 'rest', 'world', 'plight', 'finally', 'bottom', 'expected', 'results.Antonio', 'point', 'movie', 'good', 'guy', 'Even', 'when', 'top', 'world', 'having', 'just', 'gotten', 'bicycle', 'hock', 'wife', 'stopping', 'visit', 'seer', 'scene', 'actually', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'know', 'bicycle', 'going', 'get', 'stolen', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'seer', 'yes', 'later', 'integral', 'part', 'character', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'integral', 'part', 'character', 'right', 'then', 'never', 'that', 'good', 'kid', 'orders', 'friends', 'Mussolini', 'When', 'frustrated', 'kid', 'out', 'grilled', 'cheese', 'sandwiches', 'two', 'proceed', 'get', 'plastered', 'allowing', 'Antonio', 'De', 'Sica', 'rumination', 'class', 'structure', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'patron', 'restaurant', 'Bruno', 'eye', 'way', 'morbidly', 'funny', 'yet', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'tragedy', 'Antonio', 'low-rent', 'Lear', 'Titus', 'Andronicus', 'Maggiorani', 'who', 'having', 'turned', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'Italian', 'film', 'point', 'never', 'landed', 'anything', 'more', 'supporting', 'role', 'rest', 'life', 'Antonio', 'Antonio', 'Andronicus', 'not', 'Antonio', 'Antonio', 'Andronicus', 'great', 'stuff', 'right', 'there.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'years', 'because', 'honestly', 'had', 'idea', 'why', 'movie', 'bicycle', 'thief', 'would', 'have', 'captured', 'imagination', 'critics', 'public', 'alike', 'Well', 'now', 'know', 'have', 'tell', ""'re"", 'right', 'fascinating', 'study', 'man', 'slow', 'descent', 'obsession', 'well', 'time', '****']",The Bicycle Thief VHS

Jobs are scarce, and he needs this one badly, but it requires that he have a bicycle. Fortunately, he has one, but it is in hock. To get the bike, he pawns some bedclothes and embarks on his job. Halfway through the day, however, a punk kid makes off with his bicycle. The rest of the film is spent desperately searching for the bicycle or any clues that might lead him to it with his son (Enzo Staiola). In true neo-realist fashion, the film does not end where one might expect with the events neatly wrapped up. Director De Sica uses long takes and deep focus to illustrate the ordinary lives of the actors who in fact are non-professionals. There are many memorable scenes, but all of them do not seem important to the central conflict, finding the bicycle. One particularly emotional one is that when the man and his son stop at a restaurant to eat. The boy watches a wealthier family as they eat. His father cannot really afford the meal they are having and is in agony over spending money he does not have, worrying about his bicycle, and trying to enjoy himself.I would recommend this film if only to hear the way the actors speak.

441812,AHWBKTWFD46UI,6304963173,Samurai Girl,"[7, 9]","The transalation of Ladri di Biceclette would properly be translated ""Bicycle Thieves"".  The title is not a niggling detail, but serves as an important plot point, and although the central action circles around a man's search for his stolen bicycle, and for the thief..there is another thief, whose life concerns us intimately.There are, in fact, many thieves-men and boys reduced to extreme poverty, without means of support, some of whom, driven by circumstances beyond their control who make the terrible decision to betray their moral codes in order to survive, some of whom have no moral codes. Morality seems a luxury in a world gone mad. (Compare this attitude to the dialogue scene of ""apres-guerre"" in Kurosawa's post-war film ""Stray Dog"").This terrible pressure to survive at any cost is illustrated so powerfully, you will feel the moral dilemma that faces the protagonist as a personal look into the mouth of hell.Vittorio de Sica films a post-war Rome and its outskirts that is seething in angry poverty. There is not enough work, and the work that exists is hard. A man's hopes are dashed, his humanity disassembled bit by bit until he is driven to a rash act in which he betrays himself and that humiliates him before his young son.Filmed with sensitivity, the images expose a Rome of the post-war moment, parts of which still look familiar today. The light, the rain, the sun, the sunset, the Tevere, the bridges, the shops and buildings,  the faces of the people crowding a tram...all of these things persist, although years have passed since the images were recorded.What is different now, is that the poverty that persists is isolated to small areas of the city and to particular populations. What is different now is that we do not ask ""what is wrong with society that such poverty exists? "" There is the assumption that the poor are lazy or defective.We may look to Vittorio de Sica's masterpiece to remind us of the disenfranchised who, through no fault of their own, are denied a meaningful place in society, and who can be driven to acts of desperation.Clearly, de Sica feels the fall of the protagonist as a tragedy. He shows us a man who, despite all his earnest desire to be a good father, a good provider, a good worker in society, fails at all his attempts, and then, takes a moral fall into the abyss. De Sica films the final decision before the fall as a moment of supreme tension, extreme indecision and desperation.What would you do, in a similar situation?

441815,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6304963173,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 4]","""The Bicycle Thief,"" a dramatic, grainy black and white Italian film released in the United States in 1949, has long been considered one of the greats, for several reasons. The strongest must be that, along with Roberto Rossellini's 1946Open City, it gives us an unvarnished look at Rome, shortly after the end of World War II that the Italians definitively lost.  The city is devastated; its people are desperate for jobs, food, and shelter.The movie was written by Cesare Zavattini, frequent collaborator of its director, Vittorio De Sica, erstwhile matin&eacute;e idol, who took his camera onto the streets of Rome, used amateur actors, and filmed in natural light.  He and Rossellini were therefore described as adherents of the ""neorealist"" school.The plot of ""The Bicycle Thief,"" as it was called in America is, of course, well-known.  Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), one of the city's throngs of long-term unemployed, finally gets a job, and a good one with the city: putting up posters.  But ownership of a bike is a prerequisite.  His wife Maria (Lianella Carell) gets his out of hock by pawning the sheets in her dowry.  On Ricci's very first day on the job, while he's hanging a poster of Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda,"" his attention wanders from the bike.  And it's gone, stolen just like that.  He and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) frantically search the city for it.  Maggiorani and Staiola, though both amateurs, turn in intense, fully inhabited performances. Staiola's, as the son Bruno, is extraordinarily expressive: his eyes can speak volumes.  Many critics will tell you that, stolen bicycle aside; the movie is most moving in its depiction of a strong father/son bond.  And many more will point out that the relationship shown here strongly influenced the Oscar-winning World War II Holocaust film,Life Is Beautiful, by Roberto Benigni.""Bicycle Thief"" is certainly realistic.  There's a scene where Bruno is trying to cross a street to join his father; he's brushed back twice by traffic.  As De Sica was filming on actual, live location, these two near accidents really happened, and were left in the picture.  Furthermore, Maggiorani had been one of the city's unemployed before filming, and he would continue to struggle for work afterwards.It's said that prospective producer David O. Selznick proposed Cary Grant for the lead, and that De Sica countered by asking for Henry Fonda.  ""Bicycle Thief"" received a Special Oscar before the Best Foreign Film Category was established.De Sica was born into poverty in a village near Rome, and grew up in always poor southern Naples.  His first job was as an office clerk, but he made his screen debut, as an actor, in his teens.  He joined a stage company in 1923, and became a theater matin&eacute;e idol; he would soon become a cinematic matin&eacute;e idol as well.  He was a compulsive gambler, and a communist (there were many of them in Italy after the War), and his politics surely influenced his work.  In 1970, shortly before the director's death, he madeThe Garden Of The Finzi Continis, about Italian Jews leading doomed lives during WWII, and its attendant Holocaust, that won another Oscar.  In 1961, he made another WWII picture,Two Women, (based on the novel of the same name by Alberto Moravia--Two Women),that won its star, Sophia Loren, a Best Actress Oscar, an extremely rare one, as given for a performance not in English.  Throughout his acting career - De Sica continued to act, to pay for his movie making --he was best known for light earthy sex comedies, and played opposite the great female Italian stars of the day, Loren, and Gina Lollobrigida.This picture was called ""The Bicycle Thieves,"" in the original Italian, as in its English release: De Sica certainly had an eye for irony. His film retains much of its power to the present day, and probably will, into the future.  Between them, ""The Bicycle Thief"" and ""Open City"" will quite likely last as long as celluloid does, giving us a closely-observed look at a great city, and its people, in defeat.",4,It Retains Its Power,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,4047,"['Bicycle', 'Thief', 'dramatic', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'Italian', 'film', 'released', 'United', 'States', '1949', 'long', 'been', 'considered', 'one', 'greats', 'several', 'reasons', 'strongest', 'must', 'be', 'Roberto', 'Rossellini', '1946Open', 'City', 'unvarnished', 'look', 'Rome', 'shortly', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Italians', 'definitively', 'lost', 'city', 'devastated', 'people', 'are', 'desperate', 'jobs', 'food', 'shelter.The', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'Cesare', 'Zavattini', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'director', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'matin', 'eacute', 'idol', 'who', 'took', 'camera', 'streets', 'Rome', 'used', 'amateur', 'actors', 'filmed', 'natural', 'light', 'Rossellini', 'were', 'therefore', 'described', 'adherents', 'neorealist', 'school.The', 'plot', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'was', 'called', 'America', 'course', 'well-known', 'Antonio', 'Ricci', 'Lamberto', 'Maggiorani', 'one', 'city', 'throngs', 'long-term', 'unemployed', 'finally', 'job', 'good', 'one', 'city', 'putting', 'up', 'posters', 'ownership', 'bike', 'prerequisite', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Lianella', 'Carell', 'out', 'hock', 'pawning', 'sheets', 'dowry', 'Ricci', 'very', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'hanging', 'poster', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Gilda', 'attention', 'wanders', 'bike', 'gone', 'stolen', 'just', 'son', 'Bruno', 'Enzo', 'Staiola', 'frantically', 'search', 'city', 'Maggiorani', 'Staiola', 'amateurs', 'turn', 'intense', 'fully', 'inhabited', 'performances', 'Staiola', 'son', 'Bruno', 'extraordinarily', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'can', 'speak', 'volumes', 'Many', 'critics', 'will', 'tell', 'stolen', 'bicycle', 'aside', 'movie', 'most', 'moving', 'depiction', 'strong', 'father/son', 'bond', 'many', 'more', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'relationship', 'shown', 'here', 'strongly', 'influenced', 'Oscar-winning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'Life', 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'certainly', 'realistic', 'scene', 'where', 'Bruno', 'trying', 'cross', 'street', 'join', 'father', 'brushed', 'back', 'twice', 'traffic', 'De', 'Sica', 'was', 'filming', 'actual', 'live', 'location', 'two', 'accidents', 'really', 'happened', 'were', 'left', 'picture', 'Furthermore', 'Maggiorani', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'city', 'unemployed', 'filming', 'would', 'continue', 'struggle', 'work', 'afterwards.It', 'said', 'prospective', 'producer', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'proposed', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'lead', 'De', 'Sica', 'countered', 'asking', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'received', 'Special', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Category', 'was', 'established.De', 'Sica', 'was', 'born', 'poverty', 'village', 'Rome', 'grew', 'up', 'always', 'poor', 'southern', 'Naples', 'first', 'job', 'was', 'office', 'clerk', 'made', 'screen', 'debut', 'actor', 'teens', 'joined', 'stage', 'company', '1923', 'became', 'theater', 'matin', 'eacute', 'idol', 'would', 'soon', 'become', 'cinematic', 'matin', 'eacute', 'idol', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'communist', 'were', 'many', 'Italy', 'War', 'politics', 'surely', 'influenced', 'work', '1970', 'shortly', 'director', 'death', 'madeThe', 'Garden', 'Finzi', 'Continis', 'about', 'Italian', 'Jews', 'leading', 'doomed', 'lives', 'WWII', 'attendant', 'Holocaust', 'won', 'Oscar', '1961', 'made', 'WWII', 'picture', 'Two', 'Women', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Alberto', 'Moravia', 'Two', 'Women', 'won', 'star', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'extremely', 'rare', 'one', 'given', 'performance', 'not', 'English', 'acting', 'career', 'De', 'Sica', 'continued', 'act', 'pay', 'movie', 'making', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'light', 'earthy', 'sex', 'comedies', 'played', 'opposite', 'great', 'female', 'Italian', 'stars', 'day', 'Loren', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida.This', 'picture', 'was', 'called', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'original', 'Italian', 'English', 'release', 'De', 'Sica', 'certainly', 'had', 'eye', 'irony', 'film', 'much', 'power', 'present', 'day', 'probably', 'will', 'future', 'Between', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'Open', 'City', 'will', 'quite', 'likely', 'last', 'as', 'long', 'celluloid', 'giving', 'closely-observed', 'look', 'great', 'city', 'people', 'defeat']",The Bicycle Thief VHS

The story is so simple and the actors aren't professionals. But I kept hearing about the film and gave it a try when I found a copy at my local library. That proved to be one of my better decisions.The story is set in post-war Rome. Jobs are scarce and people queue desperately each day for the chance to earn enough money to feed their families. Antonio Ricci (Maggiorani) accepts a job one morning, but one of the requirements is a bicycle. Although his has been pawned, he lies and says that he has one. His wife helps him pawn other items and he manages to get the bicycle back. That doesn't sound like much of an event, but it's a triumphant moment in the film.Antonio is so happy to have the job hanging posters and the joy and relief is evident on his face. We feel happy for him. The problem is, someone steals his bicycle. By this point, we are fully invested in the story and the loss feels personal. We realize how important the bicycle is to his survival. The police don't seem interested so Antonio searches the streets with his son.The film is ranked No. 85 in IMDBs Top 250 at the time or writing and not one of the films above it has fewer votes. It's a shame that it hasn't been seen by more people. I understand that it's over 60 years old, in black and white, and that the language is Italian, but the story is so pure that it's worth seeing.

This is not just an ordinary bike used for lazy afternoon leisure. This is the bike he needs to keep his job and in turn feed his family. The Bicycle Thieves is an excellent film. Once you start watching it you will not look away. The man and his clever son go on a journey through the city to find the bike. In order to discover what they truly find you will have to watch the film for yourself. The reason for this is because it is the type of film that will relate to people on individual basis. This story could have a different meaning for everyone. It is about life and experience.

Nonetheless, as an aspiring screenwriter, after I came across a 1950 NY Times article by Arthur Miller that praised the film for its simplicity, I though Ladri di Biciclette would be worth examining for the purposes of learning about simple filmmaking. How to make a great film based on a simple story with very few characters. Arthur Miller calls this one-track conflict of a film &#8220;to be very close to a lyrical masterpiece.&#8221;The plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one. This job requires a bicycle which the Man also fortuitously procures. During the the Man&#8217;s first day on the job his bicycle is stolen. The rest of the film focuses on his crusade to find the stolen bicycle and thereby remain employed.There is a real aesthetic beauty as the Man and his Son tramp the streets, the camera follows, and the city dominates. Rome is so influential that characters lives, their interactions, and their relationships are molded and shaped by her. As the man follows clues to track down his bicycle he transverses what seems like the whole city. Moving from one Roman neighborhood to another, new scenes mean new characters, and new characters mean new conflicts.There are many touching scenes between the Man and his Son, but one especially where we think the Son has been hurt. This scene reaffirms that the Man&#8217;s true priorities are first and foremost with his family, but within seconds the Man is pulled right back into the chaos of the hunt for the bicycle. Throughout the entire film injustice reigns, paired with the utter simplicity of the film&#8217;s production, Ladri di Biciclette is a truly remarkable achievement. An example of unadorned, simple cinema.The plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one.

Antonio makes a choice that is a perfect ending for the film, and than the film goes on to show the consequences of that choice in a way the kills the ending's momentum.
