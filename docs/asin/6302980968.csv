Crockett ""Domino713""","[5, 5]","This movie about a shy L.A. highschool student who ran afoul of a centuries old vampire is a laugh riot (even if it's for all the wrong reasons!).Quick Synopsis: Jim Carrey stars as a typical L.A. teenager who is growing a little restless to lose his virginity to his high school sweetheart. What he doesn't know is that a local vampire (Lauren Hutton) is struggling to find the innocent blood of a virgin, and has set her sights on him! In order to maintain her youthful appearance, she must drink the blood of a virgin (the same virgin) 3 times before midnight on Halloween. If she succeeds, her victim becomes a vampire in her service forever!""Once Bitten"" is a comedy that saw the budding young career of Jim Carrey, an actor who would eventually rise to the upper tier of Hollywood, but who was at the time just an innocent young actor in a C rate movie in the 1980's. I think part of what makes this movie so appealing was the fact that looking back on it, one could laugh their butts off at the bad writing, terrible acting, and downright hilarious 80's vibe the entire movie has. Want to see bright florescent neon lights? How about some pretty bad fashion choices? This movie will give you one heck of a blast from the past!I would describe this film as one of those deliciously guilty pleasures that you watch and enjoy even though you know it's a terrible movie by all standards. I find it incredibly fascinating to watch Jim Carrey in one of his first films, and be able to see that he truly had some raw talent back then...(very raw talent. It took another decade or so for him to hone his skills and improve). However, even in the mid-1980's he had that incredibly expressive face, and a natural talent for humorous body language. He's just a lot of fun to watch!I'm not going to lie...this movie is so bad that it's good!",4,Low Budget Laugh Riot!

Once Bitten is a lighthearted twist on the traditional vampire tale that strays away from the dark side of vampirism, and produces a cute but clever movie good for all ages.A vampire countess (Lauren Hutton) desperately needs virgin blood in order to stay young and maintain the powers and benefits of being a vampire - one of which is eternal beauty.  Lucky for her, Mark Kendall (Jim Carrey) - a somewhat goofy, gangly teenager with raging hormones - is having problems sealing the deal with his somewhat prudish girlfriend.  In fairness to her, however, he is trying to do so in the front seat of his ice cream truck.  Mark's bond with his girlfriend begins to fall apart when he meets the countess, and she begins to use her seductive powers to gain his trust and extract his blood.This guilty pleasure from the 80s is funny from beginning to end.  The musical montages and fashions from that era are hilarious.  Clevon Little as the countess' primary assistant named Sebastian is brilliant in his mannerisms.  A classic dance sequence is an early career moment in which Jim Carrey simply exudes talent, and a pretty awesome Michael Jackson impersonation.  Finishing with a cute chase through the countess' mansion, Mark is torn between his high school sweetheart and the alluring countess.",4,Twice Shy doesn't apply,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,1347,"['Pay', 'attention', 'Twilight', 'fans', 'how', 'do', 'Once', 'Bitten', 'lighthearted', 'twist', 'traditional', 'vampire', 'tale', 'away', 'dark', 'side', 'vampirism', 'cute', 'clever', 'movie', 'good', 'ages.A', 'vampire', 'countess', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'desperately', 'virgin', 'blood', 'order', 'stay', 'young', 'maintain', 'powers', 'benefits', 'being', 'vampire', 'one', 'eternal', 'beauty', 'Lucky', 'Mark', 'Kendall', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'somewhat', 'goofy', 'gangly', 'teenager', 'raging', 'hormones', 'having', 'problems', 'sealing', 'deal', 'somewhat', 'prudish', 'girlfriend', 'fairness', 'however', 'trying', 'do', 'so', 'front', 'seat', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'Mark', 'bond', 'girlfriend', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', 'countess', 'use', 'seductive', 'powers', 'gain', 'trust', 'extract', 'blood.This', 'guilty', 'pleasure', '80s', 'funny', 'beginning', 'end', 'musical', 'montages', 'fashions', 'era', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Clevon', 'Little', 'countess', 'primary', 'assistant', 'named', 'Sebastian', 'brilliant', 'mannerisms', 'classic', 'dance', 'sequence', 'early', 'career', 'moment', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'simply', 'talent', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'impersonation', 'Finishing', 'cute', 'chase', 'countess', 'mansion', 'Mark', 'torn', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'alluring', 'countess']",N/A

Not sure if it was because of the fun 80's soundtrack or the acting, but I had to buy it just trip down memeory lane once again.  Jim Carrey plays a high schooler in love with his girlfriend....but they've never done, ""The Deed"".  He's getting all frustraited, and his 2 best buds suggest that they try some down town clubs ( mind you, they are driving in an ice cream truck which does not scream, ""Hot guys for the taking"" ) for a little action.  While at one particular club, Jim's character spots a hot older woman and talks with her.  She convinces him to go along with her to her place for a fun time. So, having been denied by his girlfriend ( who really wants to make it with him, but just at the right time/circumstances ) he goes along in the limo with the sexy older woman.  Little does he know that the hot female he is with is in dire need of virgin blood ( Jim Carrey fits the bill ) she has to drink from him 3 times before the transformation can be complete--otherwise she gets all old and cryptkeeper on him.  Clevon Little is her butler/chauffer/aid and does a great job of calming down Lauren Hutton ( the hot Vamp woman after Jim Carrey ).  There's a final scene at the high school Halloween face-off dance contest, with some great 80's dancing and music, between Jim's actual girlfriend and the hot vamp chick.  It's a silly, fun, humerous tale that will make you nostalgic for the simpler 80's sound and movies.",4,Young Jim Carrey as an almost Vampire in the 80's,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,1493,"['saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'always', 'stuck', 'Not', 'sure', 'was', 'fun', '80', 'soundtrack', 'acting', 'had', 'buy', 'just', 'trip', 'down', 'memeory', 'lane', 'once', 'again', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'high', 'schooler', 'love', 'girlfriend', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'Deed', 'getting', 'frustraited', '2', 'best', 'buds', 'suggest', 'try', 'down', 'town', 'clubs', 'mind', 'are', 'driving', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'not', 'scream', 'Hot', 'guys', 'taking', 'little', 'action', 'one', 'particular', 'club', 'Jim', 'character', 'spots', 'hot', 'older', 'woman', 'talks', 'go', 'along', 'place', 'fun', 'time', 'So', 'having', 'been', 'denied', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'really', 'make', 'just', 'right', 'time/circumstances', 'along', 'limo', 'sexy', 'older', 'woman', 'Little', 'know', 'hot', 'female', 'dire', 'need', 'virgin', 'blood', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'bill', 'drink', '3', 'times', 'transformation', 'can', 'be', 'complete', 'otherwise', 'old', 'cryptkeeper', 'Clevon', 'Little', 'butler/chauffer/aid', 'great', 'job', 'calming', 'down', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'hot', 'Vamp', 'woman', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'final', 'scene', 'high', 'school', 'Halloween', 'face-off', 'dance', 'contest', 'great', '80', 'dancing', 'music', 'Jim', 'actual', 'girlfriend', 'hot', 'vamp', 'chick', 'silly', 'fun', 'humerous', 'tale', 'will', 'make', 'nostalgic', 'simpler', '80', 'sound', 'movies']",N/A

I love the premise, I wouldn't say this is a comedy per se, but it's not exactly deadly serious either, it's just a nice light-hearted romp that includes some of the essentials often found in most teen films of the 80s, comraderie between friends, horny young guys looking to release their sexual frustration, and some teen angst, but not too much of course.  Added into the mix is Laura Hutton and her vampiric legions, and you've got yourself one hell of a film.My favorite part of the film has to be the dance sequence, and the song 'Hands Off' couldn't be more appropriate.  Carrey shows that he's one hell of a dancer, the entire sequence is perhaps one of the best examples of interpretive dance I've seen in a long time (not that I've seen many examples though, hee hee) as Jim's character is torn between his highschool sweetheart Robin and the sultry older woman the Countess.It doesn't take itself too seriously, and you can tell everyone is just having a great time.
