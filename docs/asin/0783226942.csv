Whatever you think of the plot and the completely salient points it makes on the subject  of capital punishment the true joys of &quot;The Chamber&quot; are the  performances of Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackman each of which are nothing  short of astonishing. Dunaway's creation of Cayhall's daughter is as  powerful, multi-layered and profound as anything she has ever done.

57361,AY12DBB0U420B,0783226942,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Chamber"" DVD starring Chris O'donnell and Gene Hackman. Good movie. Well done. It should have had awards, if it didn't.The movie is one of those legal things involving courtrooms, lawyers, higher courts. prison sentences, appeals and even the Governor of Mississippi. It involves a case where Hackman (San Cayhall) is convicted in the killing two innocent boys by an explosion (be ready for a really startling depiction) and is sent to prison to await the death penalty. He is universally hated, both for the deaths and for his Clan support and activity. The wait and the appeals go on for sixteen years to the point that even Cayhall is exhausted and just wants to get it over.Cayhall's young grandson (Chris O'Donnell), a newly minted lawyer enters the scene in a last resort appeal attempt to somehow thwart the state-mandated murder. He makes some advances but ultimately doesn't succeed, but it provides for a lot of painful and drawn-out drama. The acting is excellent, especially for Hackman. O'Donnell, Faye Dunaway and the entire supporting cast provide sterling backup. It's a well-done movie and well directed. It's also gripping and very thought provoking and is not a particularly easy movie to watch.The filming and direction of the film was excellent. I had a little trouble with the quality of the sound here and there, but it was not overpowering. The drama was more educational than entetaining. My feelings were that it was a fair portrayal of the attitudes of the time. Well done movie.Gary Peterson",5,More Educational Than Entertaining.

57362,A31O7B59DW7OHR,0783226942,Gene Bromberg,"[20, 30]","This was one of the first movies I saw with my now-wife. She wanted to see it because she likes Chris O'Donnell, and I agreed because...well, it's one of those things you have to do when you start dating someone. Today I would  tell her, &quot;No way, no Grisham movies. Go with your sister.&quot; At  least I would think about telling her that, before I stuck my tail between  my legs and said, &quot;Coming, dear&quot;.The movie is about a young  lawyer (O'Donnell) who sets out to help his racist redneck murderer  grandfather (Gene Hackman) escape the gas chamber. O'Donnell does this out  of some sense of grandfilial duty, and I found myself thinking, wait, I'm  supposed to ROOT for this kid to get this repulsive creature off the hook?  Hackman's character planted a bomb that killed two little Jewish kids, not  the sort of crime you shrug your shoulders over and say, &quot;Que sera  sera&quot;. That's the kind of crime the dealther penalty is for.Suffice  to say there are reasons why Hackman shouldn't be executed, but I found the  whole scenario kinda flimsy. The whole movie, actually, is pretty flimsy.  O'Donnell is perhaps the blandest actor working today, and here he gives as  vacant a performance as I've ever seen. He says every line with virtually  no inflection, no modulation in his voice, as though he was mildly sedated  (lucky guy). O'Donnell's boy-next-door looks (well, boring boy-next-door)  do not make up for his robotic acting. When they make a biopic about Al  Gore, O'Donnell gets the part. No idea what my wife sees in him.Hackman  is not a boring actor, but this role leaves him few options. With long  greasy gray hair and a thicket of beard, Hackman looks like a puffy Willie  Nelson. His character is a mean, racist, nasty piece of work, and Hackman  is certainly actor enough to pull it off. But he spends too much time  yelling and screaming, and that's all wrong. One of Hackman's greatest  strenghts is projecting menace behind a smile. When Hackman is standing  next to you, that arrogant sneer on his face, whispering softly into your  ear, that's when you know you're in big trouble. Think back to &quot;No Way  Out&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, just to give two examples. But get  him screaming and waving his arms around and you've won.Even so,  O'Donnell simply cannot compete with Hackman on screen. It's like Mike  Tyson taking on Richard Simmons. Maybe Hackman's histrionics were an  attempt to make up for the vaccuum created by O'Donnell.The movie has  one redeeming feature, and that is the performance of Bo Jackson. Bo has  the small but pivotal role of the prison guard assigned to watch over  Hackman, and he's excellent. Unlike most athletes-turned-actors he doesn't  overact just to show that he CAN act. He speaks quietly without coming  across like an automaton like O'Donnell, yet has enough of a screen  presence that he easily hangs with Hackman. I'm not saying that Bo is ready  for King Lear, but he's a better actor than O'Donnell, and Chris never made  the All-Star team AND the Pro Bowl in the same year.So why hasn't Bo  been in like 30 movies since then? I got the answer awhile back when I was  listening to a sports radio show with Bo as guest. He was so releaxed and  happy it made you sick. When asked to describe a typcial day in retirement,  Jackson said that he took his kids to school in the morning, played golf  with his buddies, ate lunch with his wife, swam a bit, picked up his kids,  made dinner for everyone, and then rented a movie or played games with his  kids. As content as a man can be. He certainly doesn't feel the need to be  in boring movies with the likes of Chris O'Donnell. So in addition to  pretty much everything else, Bo Knows when to call it quits.",1,"Dreadful, I mean, really",961891200,"06 25, 2000",2000,3760,"['was', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'saw', 'now-wife', 'wanted', 'see', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'agreed', 'well', 'one', 'things', 'have', 'do', 'when', 'start', 'dating', 'someone', 'Today', 'would', 'tell', 'quot', 'way', 'Grisham', 'movies', 'Go', 'sister.', 'quot', 'least', 'would', 'think', 'telling', 'that', 'stuck', 'tail', 'legs', 'said', 'quot', 'Coming', 'dear', 'quot', '.The', 'movie', 'young', 'lawyer', ""O'Donnell"", 'who', 'out', 'help', 'racist', 'redneck', 'murderer', 'grandfather', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'escape', 'gas', 'chamber', ""O'Donnell"", 'sense', 'grandfilial', 'duty', 'found', 'thinking', 'wait', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'ROOT', 'kid', 'get', 'repulsive', 'creature', 'hook', 'Hackman', 'character', 'planted', 'bomb', 'killed', 'two', 'little', 'Jewish', 'kids', 'not', 'sort', 'crime', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'say', 'quot', 'Que', 'sera', 'sera', 'quot', 'kind', 'crime', 'dealther', 'penalty', 'for.Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'Hackman', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'executed', 'found', 'whole', 'scenario', 'kinda', 'flimsy', 'whole', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'flimsy', ""O'Donnell"", 'perhaps', 'blandest', 'actor', 'working', 'today', 'here', 'vacant', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'line', 'virtually', 'inflection', 'modulation', 'voice', 'was', 'mildly', 'sedated', 'lucky', 'guy', ""O'Donnell"", 'boy-next-door', 'looks', 'well', 'boring', 'boy-next-door', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'robotic', 'acting', 'When', 'make', 'biopic', 'Al', 'Gore', ""O'Donnell"", 'part', 'idea', 'what', 'wife', 'sees', 'him.Hackman', 'not', 'boring', 'actor', 'role', 'few', 'options', 'long', 'greasy', 'gray', 'hair', 'thicket', 'beard', 'Hackman', 'puffy', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'character', 'mean', 'racist', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'Hackman', 'certainly', 'actor', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'wrong', 'One', 'Hackman', 'greatest', 'strenghts', 'projecting', 'menace', 'smile', 'When', 'Hackman', 'standing', 'next', 'arrogant', 'sneer', 'face', 'whispering', 'softly', 'ear', 'when', 'know', ""'re"", 'big', 'trouble', 'Think', 'back', 'quot', 'Way', 'Out', 'quot', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'just', 'give', 'two', 'examples', 'get', 'screaming', 'waving', 'arms', ""'ve"", 'won.Even', 'so', ""O'Donnell"", 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'compete', 'Hackman', 'screen', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'taking', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'Maybe', 'Hackman', 'histrionics', 'were', 'attempt', 'make', 'up', 'vaccuum', 'created', ""O'Donnell.The"", 'movie', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'performance', 'Bo', 'Jackson', 'Bo', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'prison', 'guard', 'assigned', 'watch', 'Hackman', 'excellent', 'most', 'athletes-turned-actors', ""n't"", 'overact', 'just', 'show', 'CAN', 'act', 'quietly', 'coming', 'automaton', ""O'Donnell"", 'yet', 'enough', 'screen', 'presence', 'easily', 'Hackman', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Bo', 'ready', 'King', 'Lear', 'better', 'actor', ""O'Donnell"", 'Chris', 'never', 'made', 'All-Star', 'team', 'Pro', 'Bowl', 'same', 'year.So', 'why', ""n't"", 'Bo', 'been', '30', 'movies', 'then', 'got', 'answer', 'awhile', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'listening', 'sports', 'radio', 'show', 'Bo', 'guest', 'was', 'so', 'releaxed', 'happy', 'made', 'sick', 'When', 'asked', 'describe', 'typcial', 'day', 'retirement', 'Jackson', 'said', 'took', 'kids', 'school', 'morning', 'played', 'golf', 'buddies', 'ate', 'lunch', 'wife', 'swam', 'bit', 'picked', 'up', 'kids', 'made', 'dinner', 'everyone', 'then', 'rented', 'movie', 'played', 'games', 'kids', 'As', 'content', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'boring', 'movies', 'likes', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'So', 'addition', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'Bo', 'Knows', 'when', 'call']",N/A

It also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons. The governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute, and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and TV cameras. This is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign  Just for that reason it is unethical. The film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication  of his grandson. He finally realizes, as he says so well, that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson.

Hackman portrays Sam Cayhall, a man who's been on death row for sixteen years for the bombing of a lawyer's office that resulted in the death of the lawyer's two children.  Cayhall is a vile man, who has lived a life of hatred and prejudice, the result of generations of such bigoted ancestors.  Enter Chris O'Donnell as his young grandson, who is a lawyer and wants to reopen the case and spare his grandfather the gas chamber.  What ensues is a painful exploration of hatred, prejudice and a dysfunctional family.I liked the movie, in spite of its several flaws.  Hackman is phenomenal, and Chris O'Donnell does a good job as the naively innocent, but determined, young barrister.  Faye Dunaway offers wonderful support as Hackman's estranged daughter who has lived a life of secrecy and guilt.  Lela Rochon, Raymond Barry, David Marshall Grant and Robert Prosky offer fine support too.I found myself involved in the movie, and feel it didn't offer any easy answers.

57376,A3V61K0EF38GP4,0783226942,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","Okay, so this film isn't what most Grisham fans, especially those who have seen adaptions such as ""The Firm"" and ""The Rainmaker"", and the author himself were hoping for, but it wasn't all bad.  For one thing, it had Gene Hackman playing the aged condemned Klansman Sam Cayhall, a role Mr. Hackman aced.  Chris O'Donnell wasn't all bad as Adam Hall, though this film was released not far from ""Batman and Robin"" so I involuntarily find myself making an unfavorable comparison between these two of Mr. O'Donnell's roles...he has better ones in the future once people have had a chance to recover from the trauma of that Batman disaster.  Ultimately timing seems to have been against the young lad during this film.  My other beef with this picture is it's noticeable deviations from it's source material.  I consider ""The Chamber"" to be a classic Grisham work and one of my favorites in his bibliography, which is why I wanted to see this film.  I certainly have no problem with a book's film adaptions steering away a bit from it's source material (i.e. The Shawshank Redemption), but when the alterations to the plot just don't work, that's when a film suffers.  For example, this film's plot device of a secret society sanctioned by the state government (at the very least) being in league with the KKK was just an over-the-top attempt to explain racism in Mississippi during the Civil Rights era...the book's way of explaining that same issue may create some fictional events, but those are on a much smaller scale and are properly incoperated into history...therefore, the book's way works.  As for the villain, Raymond J. Barry's role of Rollie Wedge was expanded from it's source material in the hopes that Jack Nickelson would take up the role.  Unfortunetly that didn't happen.  I'm not convinced that Mr. Barry couldn't have handled the role.  Rather, I criticize the way the character was written in this adaption.  I wasn't entirely thrilled with the character in the book either as he seemed to be too slick and undetectible in there.  I think a hybrid of the book and movie versions would have made for the perfect villain for this plot.  I did like that the FBI in the film knew something about him whereas they were completely unaware that he had even been born in the book.  Perhaps he ought to have been more slick in the film but allow the FBI to know something anyway...they are pretty good.  Also, having pose as the condemned man's brother without us having met any real brother (another deviation as we met one brother in the book) lessoned the impact of suspense that that scene could have had.  But, for all the dissappointments that this film gave to Grisham loyalists like myself, the acting was still solid and the plot was just similar enough to the book that we can make the connection.  If you're a die-hard Grisham fan who must have it all, include this in your collection.  Otherwise, I'll leave it up to you.
