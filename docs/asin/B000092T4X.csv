G.I. Joe is there"".With the beginning of these simple lyrics my Saturday mornings were never the same.  I would rush to the television with my box of Frosted Flakes and pensively wait until I would see the blue of Cobra's shirts.  Excitement would build, and I would be ready for the most engaging, most entertaining, most spectacular cartoon of the 80s.  While some would follow as being ""great"" shows as well, G.I. Joe was the one that took the cake for young me.  I would sing the songs, play with my figurines, and imagine that Cobra was crawling through my backyard ready to be attacked at any moment by my band of American rebels.Ahhh, that was the life.  Years later and I dare say ""years"" later, I found this series on Amazon, and I had to immediately purchase the set.  To begin with, it came with an action figure, and my inner-child was already screaming on the floor begging my wife to buy it for me.  When I got it home, I nervously opened the box, unsure as to what other memories of my childhood may escape the vault, I prepared for a cheap version of my childhood delight.  To my surprise, it was outstanding.  This is a great buy for anyone that remembers this program as well as I did growing up.To begin, the transfer is outstanding.  The sound is beautiful and it nearly felt as if those pesky gun-lasers were firing out of my television.  It even includes (which some may find annoying) the original commercial breaks, which I only found more nostalgic.  The two five-part ""films"" represented some of my favorite moments of G.I. Joe history.  For those of you unfamiliar with the essentials of G.I. Joe, I have compiled a small list that will not only help you as you gather more about this program, but also as you buy this series.1) There is a G.I. Joe named ""Snowjob"".2) Cobra's weaponry never pierces the Joe's machines, yet only one shot from the G.I. Joes can send a Cobra vehicle into a million pieces.3) More weaponry is used in one episode than the entire Iraq conflict4) Destro's head will not rust, even in the rain.5) Cobra is one of the most brilliant terrorist organizations around.  Their knowledge of science is impeccable and should be studied more often in the college setting.  The G.I. Joes do not have such smarts, but they can surely beat up the Cobra plan in a heartbeat.6) Cobra infantry do not know how to aim.7) No laser-bullet is wasted by a G.I. Joe.8) Yes, there is a three way going on between Destro, Major Blood, and the Baroness (and later possibly Dr. Mindbender).9) Every time (without question) the G.I. Joes do something good, they have to shout ""YOOO JOE"" no matter how many good things they hear in a matter of minutes.10) I repeat, there is a G.I. Joe named ""Snowjob"" (Is anyone else laughing hysterically?)Overall, this was a beautiful series that finally got the respect that it deserved.  Thank you RINO for releasing this amazing package and for the products that you continually revitalize.  G.I. Joe was a life-altering series, and I cannot wait to get my hands on more!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"The ""Snowjob"" Theory.....",1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,3171,"['will', 'fight', 'freedom', 'whenever', 'trouble', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'there', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Great', 'American', 'Hero', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'there', 'beginning', 'simple', 'lyrics', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'were', 'never', 'same', 'would', 'rush', 'television', 'box', 'Frosted', 'Flakes', 'pensively', 'wait', 'would', 'see', 'blue', 'Cobra', 'shirts', 'Excitement', 'would', 'build', 'would', 'be', 'ready', 'most', 'engaging', 'most', 'entertaining', 'most', 'spectacular', 'cartoon', '80s', 'would', 'follow', 'being', 'great', 'shows', 'well', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'was', 'one', 'took', 'cake', 'young', 'would', 'sing', 'songs', 'play', 'figurines', 'imagine', 'Cobra', 'was', 'crawling', 'backyard', 'ready', 'be', 'attacked', 'moment', 'band', 'American', 'rebels.Ahhh', 'was', 'life', 'Years', 'later', 'dare', 'say', 'years', 'later', 'found', 'series', 'Amazon', 'had', 'immediately', 'purchase', 'set', 'begin', 'came', 'action', 'figure', 'inner-child', 'was', 'already', 'screaming', 'floor', 'begging', 'wife', 'buy', 'When', 'got', 'home', 'nervously', 'opened', 'box', 'unsure', 'what', 'other', 'memories', 'childhood', 'may', 'escape', 'vault', 'prepared', 'cheap', 'version', 'childhood', 'delight', 'surprise', 'was', 'outstanding', 'great', 'buy', 'anyone', 'program', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'growing', 'up.To', 'begin', 'transfer', 'outstanding', 'sound', 'beautiful', 'nearly', 'felt', 'pesky', 'gun-lasers', 'were', 'firing', 'television', 'even', 'may', 'find', 'annoying', 'original', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'only', 'found', 'more', 'nostalgic', 'two', 'five-part', 'films', 'represented', 'favorite', 'moments', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'history', 'unfamiliar', 'essentials', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'have', 'compiled', 'small', 'list', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'help', 'gather', 'more', 'program', 'also', 'buy', 'series.1', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'named', 'Snowjob', '.2', 'Cobra', 'weaponry', 'never', 'Joe', 'machines', 'yet', 'only', 'one', 'shot', 'G.I', 'Joes', 'can', 'send', 'Cobra', 'vehicle', 'million', 'pieces.3', 'More', 'weaponry', 'used', 'one', 'episode', 'entire', 'Iraq', 'conflict4', 'Destro', 'head', 'will', 'not', 'rust', 'even', 'rain.5', 'Cobra', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'terrorist', 'organizations', 'knowledge', 'science', 'impeccable', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'more', 'often', 'college', 'setting', 'G.I', 'Joes', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'smarts', 'can', 'surely', 'beat', 'up', 'Cobra', 'plan', 'heartbeat.6', 'Cobra', 'infantry', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'aim.7', 'laser-bullet', 'wasted', 'G.I', 'Joe.8', 'Yes', 'three', 'way', 'going', 'Destro', 'Major', 'Blood', 'Baroness', 'later', 'possibly', 'Dr.', 'Mindbender', '.9', 'Every', 'time', 'question', 'G.I', 'Joes', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'have', 'shout', 'YOOO', 'JOE', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'hear', 'matter', 'minutes.10', 'repeat', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'named', 'Snowjob', 'anyone', 'else', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'Overall', 'was', 'beautiful', 'series', 'finally', 'got', 'respect', 'deserved', 'Thank', 'RINO', 'releasing', 'amazing', 'package', 'products', 'continually', 'revitalize', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'was', 'life-altering', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'more', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

JOE TRIVIA: the first VHS miniseries was released with the series 83 duke action figure inside.this mini series brings back cool memeories when certain syndicated american cartoons were cool. before the anime explosion of course.now on to my favorite  and not-so-favorite parts of the disc set...the  enclosed booklet pertaining to  gijoe's history was very informative dispite a mistakes. I.E. Mego was not responsible for the six million dollar action figure, it was hasbro's once rival and parent company; KENNER who manufactured not only the six million dollar man toyline but star wars as well.the interviews were ok, i loved ron friedman's perspective (or retrospective) regarding the series he helped define. on the other hand, i didn't care much more for marv wolfman's interview..too many ""er's and ah's""  and LASERS IN THE NIGHT was one of the worst epidsodes of the 1985-1986 series.one thing i would have loved to have seen was the animated comic book commercials not only were they cool, but most were better executed than the regualer gijoe epidsodes. please rhino, put those awesome 20 spots in the next 2 disc installment plus add commentary from ron friedman, he had plenty to say unlike wolfman. props to the late archie goodwin of marvel comics who created the concept of joe's arch nemises COBRA.I love the opening sequences of all the joe series.

751293,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B000092T4X,Garrett Aja,"[35, 40]","When the original G.I. Joe miniseries were (finally) released on DVD in their original, uncut form in February, the Joe-watching public was promised a follow-up release with special features. That set (which you see now) has turned out to be well worth the wait.Firstly, the packaging is more deluxe than the earlier release, and includes a booklet with a layman's history or G.I. Joe in general. Additionally, there's a Snake Eyes figure-a repaint of the original (more or less), with Timber (again, sort of, as it's not the original Timber mold from the '80s), which mimics the midnight blue color scheme from the MASS Device miniseries. The only drawback is that the packaging hypes Snake Eyes as ""one of the premier characters"" released in connection with the 1983 A Real American Hero miniseries-something that is far truer about Duke, who spent 1983 as the line's primary mail-in exclusive before being released in stores and was the star of the MASS Device episodes.Second, of course, are the episodes themselves, which are the A Real American Hero and Revenge of Cobra miniseries, completely restored and remastered (and excellently so, at that). If you purchased the previous release, you know what you're getting here.The last part of this set are interviews with writers Marv Wolfman and Ron Friedman. Wolfman's interview certainly informative, emphasizing the freedom he had while working for Sunbow (and equally emphasizing that character development is why Joe succeeded, in addition to that creative freedom), and how the toy companies might benefit from allowing that freedom to return in their cartoons. He also admits freely to liking Quick Kick (whose development he was most responsible for) and Cobra Commander, which is no surprise given how much fun he had with them in ""Lasers in the Night"" (an episode Wolfman is understandably proud of). The rest of Wolfman's interview discusses his politics and the politics that allowed for the '80s success of G.I. Joe, with a few jabs at the lesser cartoons of the '70s for good measure. Friedman's interview is, simply put, a trip. His comments are often funny (like the example slamming Kevin Costner's Robin Hood movie as a violation of the spirit of a popular franchise), and certainly worth viewing. He does seem to take a bit more credit for creating the series than some would like (including taking a direct jab at the old filecards), but he does illustrate the key points in how he wrote the initial miniseries very well, and in very entertaining fashion. This interview alone is probably reason enough to buy the set if you purchased the version without special features. All in all, another excellent job by Rhino.",5,Classic G.I.
