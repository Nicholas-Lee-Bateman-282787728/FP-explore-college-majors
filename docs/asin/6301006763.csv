242246,A3KDGJX43RU5MK,6301006763,D. W. MacKenzie,"[24, 26]","Harry's War gets very little attention. This is unfortunate because it is entertaining and informative.This film brings many real facts about the IRS to light. They do have their own special courts and are prone to abusing their authority. The Congressional hearings during the mid 90's showed that this film was not far off in depicting IRS abuse.While the actual declaration of war and standoff in this movie are fictional, there are similarities between this and the Waco and Ruby Ridge standoffs. Of course, those standoffs were over different issues and involved people who attracted governmental attention for their extremist views.Harry is different. He is a regular guy who gets driven to taking extreme actions because of the heavy-handed tactics of the IRS. This war of Harry's is a bit over the top, but that's what makes a film more fun than documentaries. Harry's speech at the end reaffirms his levelheaded nature to the world, and the IRS ends up looking bad before all.As a piece of cinematography, this film is average. The acting, sets, editing, and soundtrack are all OK. One thing that makes this film special is that it dares to disparage one of the most powerful agencies in the US government. How many places in the world are there where you can get away with that? Also, this film ridicules notions of benevolent philosopher kings running government. Films like Dave and The American President focus on personalities- so long as nice caring people have power, all will be well. Harry's War avoids this kind of `Camelot' mythologization of government. One way to sum up Harry's war would be ""power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely"".",4,Truth and Fiction,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,1667,"['Harry', 'War', 'very', 'little', 'attention', 'unfortunate', 'entertaining', 'informative.This', 'film', 'many', 'real', 'facts', 'IRS', 'light', 'do', 'have', 'own', 'special', 'courts', 'are', 'prone', 'abusing', 'authority', 'Congressional', 'hearings', 'mid', '90', 'showed', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'far', 'depicting', 'IRS', 'actual', 'declaration', 'war', 'standoff', 'movie', 'are', 'fictional', 'are', 'similarities', 'Waco', 'Ruby', 'Ridge', 'standoffs', 'course', 'standoffs', 'were', 'different', 'issues', 'involved', 'people', 'who', 'attracted', 'governmental', 'attention', 'extremist', 'views.Harry', 'different', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'driven', 'taking', 'extreme', 'actions', 'heavy-handed', 'tactics', 'IRS', 'war', 'Harry', 'bit', 'top', 'what', 'film', 'more', 'fun', 'documentaries', 'Harry', 'speech', 'end', 'levelheaded', 'nature', 'world', 'IRS', 'up', 'looking', 'bad', 'all.As', 'piece', 'cinematography', 'film', 'average', 'acting', 'sets', 'editing', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'OK.', 'One', 'thing', 'film', 'special', 'disparage', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'agencies', 'US', 'government', 'How', 'many', 'places', 'world', 'are', 'there', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'Also', 'film', 'notions', 'benevolent', 'philosopher', 'kings', 'running', 'government', 'Films', 'Dave', 'American', 'President', 'focus', 'personalities-', 'so', 'long', 'nice', 'caring', 'people', 'have', 'power', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'Harry', 'War', 'kind', 'Camelot', 'mythologization', 'government', 'One', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'Harry', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely']",N/A
242247,A1M5405JH9THP9,6301006763,golgotha.gov,"[0, 0]","HARRY'S WAR (1986)directed by Kieth Merrillapprox. 1 hour 35 minutesHARRY'S WAR is an obscure comedy dealing with a very unfunny subject - taxes!  It stars Edward Hermann, who would be best known to younger viewers as Loreli's father on the TV show 'Gilmore Girls'.  I would consider it a classic.Harry Johnson is a mailman and father who is going through the process of a divorce with his wife.  One day, he receives some correspondence from an old friend named Beverly asking him to come visit.  We discover that she was a woman who took care of Harry when he was much younger and he fondly refers to her as his ""aunt"".  He is happy to see her again but learns that she hasn't been doing so well.  She operates a ""mission"" where she feeds soup to people who need it.  She has no real income and in fact gives away more than she receives, yet the IRS has been threatening her regarding complications in the tax code.  Beverly is a kind woman who sometimes interjects her strange understanding of the Cold War into everyday conversation.  For this reason, the government believes that her Mission is in fact a ""political organization"", and hence exempt from tax-free status.  Harry is concerned for his old friend, but optimistically believes that it is all a misunderstanding that will get sorted out once the two sides hear each other clearly.Harry decides to stay and help his friend run her business and things seem to be getting better until he goes to the hardware store and discovers that his checks have been bouncing.  It turns out that his bank account has been seized by the IRS.  When Harry tries to consult the Internal Revenue Service, he is given the ""run around"" and eventually thrown into tax court.  The stress from all this literally kills his elderly friend Beverly.  This is the straw that breaks the camel's back and Harry comes to realize that the IRS is at odds with his understanding of the U.S. constitution.  Things get ugly when the IRS seizes his property, prompting him to declare war against the tax goons.  The situation escalates into a standoff situation with Harry making impassioned speeches about his predicament.Reading the above, it may not sound like it would be possible to make a comedy with this sort of storyline.  And while the humor is a little dated, I think that the real purpose of this movie is to educate.  When I first saw this movie I don't think that I noticed how much information was written into the dialogue.  Having recently rewatched it, I would definitely recommend it to a friend who hasn't really thought about the particulars of the IRS.  If a criticism of the movie can be made, it is that the bad guys in the movie are totally one dimensional.  I guess you could counter this by saying that there are real-life horror stories dealing with the IRS that make the agents here look like saints!  Another striking thing about watching this in 2008 is that there are very very few movies that have been made since HARRY'S WAR that take such a stand and deliver such a message in such a simple way.  I love documentaries, and yes I've seen and reviewed Aaron Russo's movie, but I feel like the general public is only predisposed to watch documentaries that they believe they will agree with.  I would love to see a dramatic movie, whether it is a comedy or action movie or whatever, that deals with these issues.
