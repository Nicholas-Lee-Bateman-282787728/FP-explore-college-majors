Very sad at times like when they take the dog from the girl and her family but, a very happy ending when the cop decides to return the dog to the family and move on.

Once you get passed the aging Luke Perry (who looked like he would rather be doing anything else than working on this movie), you had to deal with obviously &#34;first time&#34; actors with no talent.
