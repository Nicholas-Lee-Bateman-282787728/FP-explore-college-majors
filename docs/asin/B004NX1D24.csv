This story is kinda far fetched but is a cute love story with a nice ending. June Allyson's part is well done and heartfelt. Watching this story you had to also fall for June Allyson she played a touching part. Also has a real surprise ending.

Like nowadays when one watches indie movies, one can really see why Hollywood movies are so good and make it.  Well, this movie comes across as an ""almost but not quite"" in my humble opinion.  It is from the Warner Brothers Archive Collection, which is definitely hit or miss.  And I think this one is a ""miss"".  But suffice it to say, that the movie centers around a young man who works at a hotel and is trying to save up enough money to buy a radio.  His girlfriend as portrayed by June Allyson is an invalid and he reads her fairy tales. The princes is portrayed by Hedy Lamarr who and the young lad by Robert Walker.  Many of the elements are present for it to be a good movie, but it just doesn't seem to quite make it.  Maybe I'll try again sometime with this one and see if I change my mind, but for now I can't give it a very high rating.",2,Missing the spark.,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,940,"['movie', 'have', 'sweet', 'plot', 'somehow', 'come', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'nowadays', 'when', 'one', 'indie', 'movies', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'make', 'Well', 'movie', 'across', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'definitely', 'hit', 'miss', 'think', 'one', 'miss', 'say', 'movie', 'centers', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'hotel', 'trying', 'save', 'up', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'radio', 'girlfriend', 'portrayed', 'June', 'Allyson', 'invalid', 'fairy', 'tales', 'princes', 'portrayed', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'who', 'young', 'lad', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'Many', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'make', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'try', 'again', 'sometime', 'one', 'see', 'change', 'mind', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'high', 'rating']",N/A

Here you end up with bronze.  The story is more of a reverse Cinderella with the main characters finding out what is really in their hearts.  Rags Raglund is probably the best part of the film as the dim-witted, heart of gold buddy to Walker.  The love interest for Lamarr is badly miscast and would have benefitted from a bigger star, but I suppose it would have trimmed the attention from Walker's bellboy.  If you go in expecting a light romantic comedy you will probably enjoy the movie.

1422533,A11CYNCILLSRZ8,B004NX1D24,Robert L. Anderson,"[0, 0]","I saw this wonderful movie when I was in grammer school and it is one of my favorite childhood films. Not being very happy at home and not doing very well in school, movies like this transported me into a Never Neverland of happiness. I thought that Hedy Lamarr was the most beautiful woman I'de ever seen. And I still think she was the most beautiful woman in motion pictures or anywhere else.  And Robert Walker was a cute 'everyman/boy' type. I don't think anyone could not like Robert Walker. What was there not to like? I'm sure he was MGM's Golden Boy for awhile. Too bad his life ended so tragically. And as for June Allyson-well this was one of her first early films for MGM. MGM knew how to groom their stars. There's a lot to be said for the 'studio system'. I loved the studio system of having their own lot of Movie Stars.I think that many stars today don't really 'make it' is because they don't have the strong support of their own studio to help them.  Now their just known as ACTORS. You don't hear the words MOVIE STAR like you did years ago when I was a kid.And so what if this film was a modern day fairy tale!  And there'no great Academy Award winning actors in the movie! Back in the day we didn't neccisarily go to the movies to see a great film or a great performance.We went to the movies to be entertained, by a western, detective drama, comedy, a musical or a cartoon.

Now she wants to follow her heart, but he is not so quick to take her back. Meanwhile, she employs a bellboy named Jimmy (Robert Walker) to be her personal assistant. He is taken by her beauty and falls in love with her.The real reason to watch this movie though is not for the primary story, but for the secondary characters. June Allyson plays an invalid who is in love with Jimmy and Rags Ragland plays Jimmy's friend who has eyes for June. These two are absolutely wonderful. June is very beautiful and she's heartbreaking at times. Her ability to cry on cue is put to good use. This is an interesting part for her; when she was a young girl, a tree fell on her and almost made her an invalid. It must have been odd to play out what might have been. Rags is alternately funny and heartbreaking, and this role shows what an underrated character actor he was.3 1/2 stars.
