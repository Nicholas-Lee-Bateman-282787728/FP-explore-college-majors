347275,AGTWRSKJ0WEQT,6302946549,David J. Kucharski,"[105, 108]","When STOLEN HOURS was released in 1963, the movie garnered little attention. It starred an actress, Susan Hayward, who was  considered &quot;past her prime&quot; (it had been five years since Hayward won her Oscar for I WANT TO LIVE, which was really her final movie to get outstanding critical notices). STOLEN HOURS was filmed in England, a place where (in the early 1960s at least) only &quot;has-beens&quot; from Hollywood went to make movies. Plus, the film was a remake--the original version was DARK VICTORY, one of Bette Davis' best-loved and -remembered films.This lack of attention to STOLEN HOURS is a true shame. For the film is a mature, thoughtful and touching romantic drama about a woman re-evaluating her life in the face of terminal illness.The overall tone of STOLEN HOURS is quiet and restrained. (Some may thus feel that it suffers in comparison to the more emotionally charged DARK VICTORY.) The script is literate and serious, but with a sprinkling of gentle humor.There are many virtues to the film. The color photography is outstanding, particularly the views of the beautiful coastal village toward the end of the film. Mort Lindsay's musical score is lovely and has some of the romantic sweep of classic Hollywood film scores. And the supporting performances are well done.But this film truly belongs to Susan Hayward. Toward the end of her career, Hayward--like many more mature actors--tended to give performances that were broad and over-the-top (I would include her performance in I WANT TO LIVE). But here, she is remarkably controlled. She has many quiet moments that are among the finest acting scenes of her career. She seemed to truly understand the character she was playing, and responded with a performance that was Oscar-worthy (if anyone at the time had bothered to pay attention to the film).A sad postscript: Like the character she portrays here, Hayward herself also died of a brain tumor. That fact makes viewing this film a bittersweet experience for her fans.All in all, I recommend STOLEN HOURS as a touching romantic drama, and as a reminder of the fine acting talent of Susan Hayward.",4,An underappreciated Hayward drama,971136000,"10 10, 2000",2000,2134,"['When', 'STOLEN', 'HOURS', 'was', 'released', '1963', 'movie', 'garnered', 'little', 'attention', 'starred', 'actress', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'who', 'was', 'considered', 'quot', 'prime', 'quot', 'had', 'been', 'five', 'years', 'Hayward', 'won', 'Oscar', 'WANT', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'was', 'really', 'final', 'movie', 'get', 'outstanding', 'critical', 'notices', 'STOLEN', 'HOURS', 'was', 'filmed', 'England', 'place', 'where', 'early', '1960s', 'least', 'only', 'quot', 'has-beens', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'went', 'make', 'movies', 'film', 'was', 'remake', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'DARK', 'VICTORY', 'one', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'best-loved', '-remembered', 'films.This', 'lack', 'attention', 'STOLEN', 'HOURS', 'true', 'shame', 'film', 'mature', 'thoughtful', 'touching', 'romantic', 'drama', 'woman', 're-evaluating', 'life', 'face', 'terminal', 'illness.The', 'overall', 'tone', 'STOLEN', 'HOURS', 'quiet', 'restrained', 'may', 'thus', 'feel', 'comparison', 'more', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'DARK', 'VICTORY', 'script', 'literate', 'serious', 'sprinkling', 'gentle', 'are', 'many', 'virtues', 'film', 'color', 'photography', 'outstanding', 'particularly', 'views', 'beautiful', 'coastal', 'village', 'end', 'film', 'Mort', 'Lindsay', 'musical', 'score', 'lovely', 'romantic', 'sweep', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'scores', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'well', 'done.But', 'film', 'truly', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Toward', 'end', 'career', 'Hayward', 'many', 'more', 'mature', 'actors', 'tended', 'give', 'performances', 'were', 'broad', 'over-the-top', 'would', 'include', 'performance', 'WANT', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'here', 'remarkably', 'controlled', 'many', 'quiet', 'moments', 'are', 'finest', 'acting', 'scenes', 'career', 'seemed', 'truly', 'understand', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'responded', 'performance', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'anyone', 'time', 'had', 'bothered', 'pay', 'attention', 'film', 'sad', 'postscript', 'character', 'here', 'Hayward', 'also', 'died', 'brain', 'tumor', 'fact', 'viewing', 'film', 'bittersweet', 'experience', 'fans.All', 'recommend', 'STOLEN', 'HOURS', 'touching', 'romantic', 'drama', 'reminder', 'fine', 'acting', 'talent', 'Susan', 'Hayward']",N/A
347276,A39CTP1QW1JH06,6302946549,Donato,"[0, 0]","Susan Hayward could always be counted on to put the soap in the soap opera-like films she often did and to serve up everything with a generous portion of ham.  That they don't make actresses like Hayward any longer is both a blessing and a disappointment. (Sadly, however, as acting styles have changed over the decades, the ""disappointment"" part is missing the camp value inherent in the overly-dramatic and stylized performers from a certain era of film.) Watching Hayward in WHERE LOVE HAS GONE, for example, playing Bette Davis's daughter (Hayward was only 9 years younger than Davis!) is a pure delight for probably all the wrong reasons.  STOLEN HOURS, then, is a 1963 remake of DARK VICTORY, a Davis film from 1939. It's melodramatic plot is nothing to write home about but just to see Hayward in one of her later films is reason enough to buy this title. SPOILER ALERT:  Our rich, spoiled, fast-living party girl doesn't survive her illness by the end of the film, despite finding what would appear to be true love, and the rather abrupt death scene is soap opera gold. I know there are people who truly love the pre-Marlon Brando style of acting and to whom criticizing the likes of Davis, de Havilland, Crawford, Hayward, Turner, et al, is sacrilegious.  I can't help it that I find these overly-dramatic performers enjoyable for, again, most of the wrong reasons.

That film has very much going for it, but so does this one. I  saw this film before I saw Dark Victory, although I knew of it,  so, for me,  there were no comparison issues that needed to be made.  The script has been updated to the 1960's and moved to England. Neither of those things hurts the picture in the least.  The scenery is frankly much better than in the original, which  made almost entirely on the Warner Bros. sound stages.  Performances are very good in this version as well; Hayward is a bit more restrained than Davis was,  which works fine. She is also very beautiful.  Michael Craig is a good leading man; I have to say I slightly prefer him to George Brent.  Craig seems more,  to me at least, more believable as a doctor, as well as a bit more able to hold his own against a strong woman like Hayward.  I also like Diane Baker's brief performance , and Edward Judd towers over Ronald Reagan in the other man role!
