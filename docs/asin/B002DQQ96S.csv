1263949,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B002DQQ96S,calvinnme,"[7, 12]","This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R with no extras. There are also no chapter stops. You may only go forwards and backwards in 10 minute increments.According  to the Wikipedia, ""I Was a Communist for the FBI"" was the name of a series of articles written by Matt Cvetic that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post. The stories were later turned into a best-selling book, an American espionage thriller radio series,  and also this motion picture. Mr. Cvetic's articles were the true story of his undercover life, but the radio show and this film were largely fictionalized for dramatic effect. Matt Cvetic was actually an undercover agent for the FBI posing as a Communist for nine years. It is true that he alienated his family and friends as a result of them believing that he was actually a Communist, and even wound up divorced as a result of his assignment, although the divorce is not mentioned in the film. It is not true that the Communists posed as big a threat to the U.S. from within as is shown in the motion picture. The film itself is quite interesting and a pretty good thriller in its own right. It will keep you guessing as to whether or not Cvetic's true identity will be revealed before he is finished collecting information.You just have to forget about the stretching of the truth that goes on here and enjoy this film for what it is  - a window into a particularly paranoid time in America with a good pace to it. A film that is equivalent to it and made about the same time is the better known ""Big Jim McLain"" starring John Wayne. It too has many wild stereotypes, but the action is good and you just have to remember when and why it was made. If you do that, you should thoroughly enjoy both films.The audio and video were both excellent. There were hardly any scratches in the video, and the sound was very clear and undistorted. Considering its interesting subject matter and good condition it's too bad Warner didn't release this as a pressed DVD with some kind of commentary.",4,A window into another time,1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,2014,"['Warner', 'Archive', 'product', 'DVD-R', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'no', 'chapter', 'stops', 'may', 'only', 'go', 'forwards', 'backwards', '10', 'minute', 'increments.According', 'Wikipedia', 'Was', 'Communist', 'FBI', 'was', 'name', 'series', 'articles', 'written', 'Matt', 'Cvetic', 'appeared', 'Saturday', 'Evening', 'Post', 'stories', 'were', 'later', 'turned', 'best-selling', 'book', 'American', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'radio', 'series', 'also', 'motion', 'picture', 'Mr.', 'Cvetic', 'articles', 'were', 'true', 'story', 'undercover', 'life', 'radio', 'show', 'film', 'were', 'largely', 'fictionalized', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'Matt', 'Cvetic', 'was', 'actually', 'undercover', 'agent', 'FBI', 'posing', 'Communist', 'nine', 'years', 'true', 'alienated', 'family', 'friends', 'result', 'believing', 'was', 'actually', 'Communist', 'even', 'wound', 'up', 'divorced', 'result', 'assignment', 'divorce', 'not', 'mentioned', 'film', 'not', 'true', 'Communists', 'posed', 'as', 'big', 'threat', 'U.S.', 'shown', 'motion', 'picture', 'film', 'quite', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'good', 'thriller', 'own', 'right', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'not', 'Cvetic', 'true', 'identity', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'finished', 'collecting', 'information.You', 'just', 'have', 'forget', 'stretching', 'truth', 'here', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', 'window', 'particularly', 'paranoid', 'time', 'America', 'good', 'pace', 'A', 'film', 'equivalent', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'better', 'known', 'Big', 'Jim', 'McLain', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'too', 'many', 'wild', 'stereotypes', 'action', 'good', 'just', 'have', 'remember', 'when', 'why', 'was', 'made', 'do', 'should', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'films.The', 'audio', 'video', 'were', 'excellent', 'were', 'hardly', 'scratches', 'video', 'sound', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'undistorted', 'Considering', 'interesting', 'subject', 'matter', 'good', 'condition', 'too', 'bad', 'Warner', 'did', ""n't"", 'release', 'pressed', 'DVD', 'kind', 'commentary']",I Was a Communist for the FBI

1263951,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B002DQQ96S,The Mysterious Traveler,"[11, 18]","Long suppressed. Never released on VHS. It is amazing this managed to finally slip past the liberal censors. A solid brutal--especially for the time---noir espionage thriller based on true events---everything from the Gerhard Eisler case to the Communist riots outside Warners brothers studios to the Harlem race riots is referenced in some way. The film manages to touch upon Communist operations in this country from the 30s to the early 50s using the Cvetic case as the ""everyman"" character.The film is very much Warner's side B to the earlier CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY which was, in turn, based on genuine cases of Nazi operations before America's entry into the Second World War. Poor Cvetic in real life was harassed and persecuted by the American Left and his life was destroyed. This film concludes before that with the successful prosecution of the Eleven members of the Communist Party for the violation of the Smith Act on the eve of the Communist invasion of South Korea.  The film nails cold the vicious Communist mindset and also shows that we really did not need the Soviet Archives to be opened in the 90s to confirm what many already knew was going on at the time.The acting, direction, lighting and especially the script are top notch. An extremely enjoyable film and a true lost classic. Obviously not for liberals who should probably rewatch REDS or THE WAY WE WERE as they will only be upset.  All others are strongly urged to learn the history that they do not want you to know.  Another brilliant film on this subject THE WOMAN ON PIER 13 based on the Harry Bridges case has just escaped the censors as well and should be seen. All hail Warners! Now where is THE RED MENACE, THE STEEL FIST,TRIAL, RED SNOW, WALK EAST ON BEACON and the other great film of this genre THE IRON CURTAIN with Dana Andrews?  Where is the 50s TV classic I LED THREE LIVES??If these films are supposedly so silly, why do libs quake in fear that people will see them? Strike a blow for freedom. Buy this now.

1263952,A2U974OZOVRT7A,B002DQQ96S,Tom Without Pity,"[19, 19]","This is a review for I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. (1951) directed by Gordon Douglas.  I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. is the story of Pittsburgh steel worker and union official Matt Cvetic, played by Frank Lovejoy,  who joined the Communist Party U.S.A. as an undercover agent  at the government's request.  When his communist membership became well known Cvetic lost his friends and was shunned by his family, including his teen- aged son.Eventually he meets his son's high school teacher and becomes involved with her even though she, too, is a party member.  Despite his actual political convictions Cvetic continues recruiting and otherwise working for the communist party until the day comes when he is slated to testify against the Pittsburgh party officialsand after nine years underground he is allowed to reveal himself to everyone he knows.The only place I have seen I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I.called a film noir  is a book titled ""Death On The Cheap: The Lost B Movies Of Film Noir""by Arthur Lyons and even there it is just listed, not really discussed.However, I believe that a noir case can be made for this film  by pointing out that the protagonist, Matt Cvetic, after nine years undercover is scorned by just about everyone he knows but still stays in Pittsburgh and takes all the hatred and sheer dislike and distrust apparently turning the other cheek most every time.  Just because he has a greater purpose, to expose the party when, and only when,  our government gives him the order. If that isn't a hellish existence, almost losing himself in the abyss of hatred and paranoia,and fighting himself to suppress his true feelings just about every day,  I don't know what is.So I would rate I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. as a film noir, although certainly not the  kind of film we usually think of when noir is mentioned.Over all I think I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. is a well made, fast paced movie with believable performances by everyone on screen.  Just as it was released the undeclared Korean War heated up and it was an actual(sort of) wartime film, depicting our enemies as spies and sabatours, which happened to be  true.In any event, I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE F.B.I. is a window into the past of sixty years ago and unfortunately, we're facing some of the same situations these days as well.Four Stars.",4,Undercover On The Homefront,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,2347,"['review', 'WAS', 'COMMUNIST', 'THE', 'F.B.I', '1951', 'directed', 'Gordon', 'Douglas', 'WAS', 'A', 'COMMUNIST', 'THE', 'F.B.I', 'story', 'Pittsburgh', 'steel', 'worker', 'union', 'official', 'Matt', 'Cvetic', 'played', 'Frank', 'Lovejoy', 'who', 'joined', 'Communist', 'Party', 'U.S.A.', 'undercover', 'agent', 'government', 'request', 'When', 'communist', 'membership', 'became', 'well', 'known', 'Cvetic', 'lost', 'friends', 'was', 'shunned', 'family', 'including', 'teen-', 'aged', 'son.Eventually', 'son', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'involved', 'even', 'too', 'party', 'member', 'actual', 'political', 'convictions', 'Cvetic', 'recruiting', 'otherwise', 'working', 'communist', 'party', 'day', 'when', 'slated', 'testify', 'Pittsburgh', 'party', 'officialsand', 'nine', 'years', 'allowed', 'reveal', 'everyone', 'only', 'place', 'have', 'seen', 'WAS', 'COMMUNIST', 'THE', 'F.B.I.called', 'film', 'noir', 'book', 'titled', 'Death', 'Cheap', 'Lost', 'B', 'Movies', 'Film', 'Noir', 'Arthur', 'Lyons', 'even', 'just', 'listed', 'not', 'really', 'discussed.However', 'believe', 'noir', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'pointing', 'out', 'protagonist', 'Matt', 'Cvetic', 'nine', 'years', 'undercover', 'scorned', 'just', 'everyone', 'still', 'Pittsburgh', 'hatred', 'sheer', 'dislike', 'distrust', 'apparently', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', 'most', 'time', 'Just', 'greater', 'purpose', 'expose', 'party', 'when', 'only', 'when', 'government', 'order', ""n't"", 'hellish', 'existence', 'almost', 'losing', 'abyss', 'hatred', 'paranoia', 'fighting', 'suppress', 'true', 'feelings', 'just', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'is.So', 'would', 'rate', 'WAS', 'COMMUNIST', 'THE', 'F.B.I', 'film', 'noir', 'certainly', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'usually', 'think', 'when', 'noir', 'think', 'WAS', 'COMMUNIST', 'THE', 'F.B.I', 'well', 'made', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'believable', 'performances', 'everyone', 'screen', 'Just', 'was', 'released', 'undeclared', 'Korean', 'War', 'heated', 'up', 'was', 'actual', 'sort', 'wartime', 'film', 'depicting', 'enemies', 'spies', 'sabatours', 'happened', 'be', 'true.In', 'event', 'WAS', 'COMMUNIST', 'THE', 'F.B.I', 'window', 'past', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'unfortunately', ""'re"", 'facing', 'same', 'situations', 'days', 'well.Four', 'Stars']",I Was a Communist for the FBI
