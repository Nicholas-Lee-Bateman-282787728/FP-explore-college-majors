1147141,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0014IC31G,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","This is the 2007 version of Stephen Sondheim's 1970 musical COMPANY (specifically COMPANY: A MUSICAL COMEDY) starring Raul Esparza, who has since taken up residence as the new A.D.A. on TV's LAW AND ORDER: SVU.  Here he plays the central character, 35-year-old unmarried Bobby, friend and pet to five separate married couples.  The wives want to get him married off, the husbands warn against it, Bobby chases away several prospects and tries to settle on one, all the while wondering whether marriage is worth it.This version has all the Sondheim songs that have grown into classics over the years, including ""Another Hundred People,"" ""Barcelona,"" ""Sorry-Grateful"" and of course the ever-fierce ""Ladies Who Lunch.""  Other than Esparza, the cast members are not well-known names.  We are told that this is the version that played for a year on Broadway and this TV edition was originally presented on the long-running ""American Masters"" series for Public TV.Most people are bound to ask: Which is better, this version or the 2011 version with Neil Patrick Harris?  Well, this version proceeded flawlessly enough, but it did not have quite the ""oomph"" of the Neil Patrick Harris version, possibly because it lacks the celebrity power. It also runs close to fifteen minutes shorter than the 2011 version, suggesting that some of the more New York-specific dialog was eliminated.  (The cast members in this version wear stylish but black costumes, suggesting present-day action, while the 2011 version used period end-of-Sixties getup and no attempt to update the material.)  Here, the action is restricted to a tiny square floor of a stage that would draw apologies as a disco dance floor or the setting for dinner theater.  A peculiarity is that there is no orchestra; the cast play the minimal number of instruments necessary right there on the tiny stage, and as you may expect, the music is often pretty awful.  Sometimes, so awful it seems meant as a joke, or perhaps there was no other way to take it.  This version was directed and edited flawlessly, and Esparza is by far the strongest thing in it.  Of the two versions neither is perfect, and even though I would give a slight edge to the 2011 (NPH) version because it is not ashamed to play it as a period piece, the DVD for this version includes a lengthy Australian interview with composer Stephen Sondheim, which must be considered a plus.Company (Stephen Sondheim).",4,"""Bobby.....Bobby.....Bobby Baby.....Bobby Bubbe.....Robert Darling.....""",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,2427,"['2007', 'version', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', '1970', 'musical', 'COMPANY', 'specifically', 'COMPANY', 'MUSICAL', 'COMEDY', 'starring', 'Raul', 'Esparza', 'who', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'new', 'A.D.A', 'TV', 'LAW', 'ORDER', 'SVU', 'Here', 'central', 'character', '35-year-old', 'unmarried', 'Bobby', 'friend', 'pet', 'five', 'separate', 'married', 'couples', 'wives', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'off', 'husbands', 'warn', 'Bobby', 'away', 'several', 'prospects', 'tries', 'settle', 'one', 'wondering', 'marriage', 'it.This', 'version', 'Sondheim', 'songs', 'have', 'grown', 'classics', 'years', 'including', 'Hundred', 'People', 'Barcelona', 'Sorry-Grateful', 'course', 'ever-fierce', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'Other', 'Esparza', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'not', 'well-known', 'names', 'are', 'told', 'version', 'played', 'year', 'Broadway', 'TV', 'edition', 'was', 'originally', 'presented', 'long-running', 'American', 'Masters', 'series', 'Public', 'TV.Most', 'people', 'are', 'bound', 'ask', 'Which', 'better', 'version', '2011', 'version', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Well', 'version', 'proceeded', 'flawlessly', 'enough', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'quite', 'oomph', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'version', 'possibly', 'celebrity', 'power', 'also', 'close', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'shorter', '2011', 'version', 'suggesting', 'more', 'New', 'York-specific', 'dialog', 'was', 'eliminated', 'cast', 'members', 'version', 'wear', 'stylish', 'black', 'costumes', 'suggesting', 'present-day', 'action', '2011', 'version', 'used', 'period', 'end-of-Sixties', 'getup', 'attempt', 'update', 'material', 'Here', 'action', 'restricted', 'tiny', 'square', 'floor', 'stage', 'would', 'draw', 'apologies', 'disco', 'dance', 'floor', 'setting', 'dinner', 'theater', 'peculiarity', 'orchestra', 'cast', 'play', 'minimal', 'number', 'instruments', 'necessary', 'right', 'tiny', 'stage', 'may', 'expect', 'music', 'often', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Sometimes', 'so', 'awful', 'meant', 'joke', 'perhaps', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'take', 'version', 'was', 'directed', 'edited', 'flawlessly', 'Esparza', 'far', 'strongest', 'thing', 'two', 'versions', 'perfect', 'even', 'would', 'give', 'slight', 'edge', '2011', 'NPH', 'version', 'not', 'ashamed', 'play', 'period', 'piece', 'DVD', 'version', 'lengthy', 'Australian', 'interview', 'composer', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'plus.Company', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim']",N/A

I was very fortunate to have seen the enthralling2006 productionat the Ethel Barrymore Theater last season, and I'm thrilled it has been captured for posterity on DVD as part of PBS's ""Great Performances"" series. There is something supremely ironic about how a 37-year old show, already revived twice, can feel fresher than most Broadway musicals written today. However, when the music reflects Sondheim at his most accomplished with performers so adept, it becomes a moot point, even though several of the songs here have been inescapable at karaoke bars for years from the lips of overly zealous musical theater aficionados.Staged like a minimalist cabaret act, John Doyle's joyous revival uses the same technique he used in his 2005 production of Sondheim'sSweeney Todd, specifically he has the actors play their own musical instruments, a daring move which actually helps underline the characters' feelings. The story is blessedly simple as it revolves around perennial bachelor Bobby, as he turns 35 and observes his circle of upscale Manhattanite friends, five married couples at different stages in various vignettes that make him reconsider what he wants out of life. Juggling three girlfriends, Bobby is a likeable but elliptical figure with commitment issues, and the story really follows his journey toward self-acceptance. There is an element of contrivance to the structure, but what I thought would be a severely dated libretto by George Furth continues to resonate with wit and insight.For a canon as legendary and often erratic as his, Sondheim's sophisticated music and lyrics never seemed as accessible and hummable as they do here. So much of the show rides on the crucial casting of Bobby, and Ra&uacute;l Esparza is terrifically bold and poignant in managing the precarious balance between yearning romantic and cynical hedonist. With a beautifully expressive singing voice coupled with a common-guy demeanor, he captures the character's arc with an escalating emotional intensity from the measured romanticism of ""Someone Is Waiting"" to the tender tentativeness of ""Marry Me a Little"" (with the beautiful, Sondheim-trademarked rolling piano) to the bursting climactic catharsis of ""Being Alive"".The rest of the cast accomplish wonderful moments that already come with high expectations - Heather Laws' dexterously motors her way through ""Getting Married Today"" with her character's nerve-wracking intensity intact; Elizabeth Stanley brings a likable warmth to the dim-bulb flight attendant April as she duets sweetly with Esparza on the comically post-coital ""Barcelona""; Angel Desai's saucy turn as hip Marta on ""Another Hundred People""; the poignant ""Sorry-Grateful"" performed by the comparatively less spotlighted male ensemble; and of course, there are the lacerating observations in ""The Ladies Who Lunch"", handled with fierce worldliness by Barbara Walsh as Joanne. In the intimidating shadow of Elaine Stritch, Walsh lets out repeated primal screams at the end that pierce with wounding acuity.TV director Lonny Price does a fluent job transferring the production to the small screen with minimum fuss. The 2008 DVD contains three terrific extras. First, there is a fifteen-minute interview with an articulate and thoughtful Esparza who discusses his connection with Bobby, the challenge of learning piano, and the alternating joy and pressure of working with Sondheim (for the third time). There is also a nine-minute interview with the erudite Doyle who explains how his unique use of actors as musicians went over with Sondheim. The centerpiece has to be a fascinating, 38-minute interview that Australian TV personality Jonathan Biggins conducted with Sondheim last year in Sydney's Theatre Royal. Sondheim is particularly forthcoming with humorous anecdotes about working with the likes of Leonard Bernstein, Ethel Merman, Barbra Streisand, and his mentor Oscar Hammerstein II during his long, illustrious career.  This is a wonderful DVD for any Broadway aficionado and particularly for fans of Sondheim, Esparza and Doyle.

I hope more and more will be forthcoming.  Therefore I am loath to say anything negative about any such offering.  However, I didn't particularly care for ""Company"".  Let me be clear, it is not the production itself but the source material I did not enjoy.This production is my first experience with ""Company"".  I just did not enjoy Sondheim's score or the story.  It was all pretty depressing and glum.  The point of view felt rather cynical and jaded.  I couldn't identify or recognize anything desirable in the characters or relationships.  Some of the dialogue had a very dated feel (though expected in a musical from 1970, it was not enjoyed).  It felt bound to a time and place - not one filled with wonder and excitement, but one that I am glad has been left behind.  One I have no joy in visiting.  Overall, the characters were not engaging due to their emotional detachment and the plastic veneer surrounding them.  Everything was a facade.On the positive side, Raul Esparza is a very talented singer and actor (I loved him in the recording of Jonathan Larson's ""Tick... Tick...Boom!"").  The rest of the ensemble was also generally good.  There were several humorous moments despite the general melancholy feel.  The sparse staging and the actors doubling as instrumentalists took a bit of getting used to, but it was successful enough in the end.  I will not go so far as to say it added to the production, but it was passable.  I do wonder if such technique should be used if it does not truly enhance the material, though.  Doesn't one wish to see the best staging possible?  I am not sure this is it.If you like ""Company"" or are a fan of Sondheim, I would highly recommend you check out this production.

But then, COMPANY is a show that is always divisive. For starters, the show has no ""plot"" in a conventional sense. That bothers some viewers. It also uses songs to express attitudes rather than advance the story (again, what story?) But those subtle lingering looks, the unexpected responses, the sighs, the pauses...they communicate so much about these characters, and that is beautifully captured in this video.No, it is not the COMPANY that was seen on Broadway in 1970. Given the advances it presaged, I expect that to see an archival reconstruction of the original might now look horribly dated.  Jonathan Doyle has given the show a fresh perspective by having the company of actors double as musicians. It's a stunt he tried before with SWEENEY TODD to much acclaim. Unfortunately, coming after SWEENEY critics tended to be very blaze about the whole thing. Yeah, What else can you do?But the concept actually works better with Company and is far less distracting. You do not miss the full orchestra as much here as with the more operatic SWEENEY. It makes the story more intimate and personal. The concept has a few drawbacks. Several times numbers end by segueing back into dialogue, frustrating an audience that wants to applaud but keeping the rhythm steady.The rock steady performance of Raul Esparza anchors the entire show. It's performance that earned him high praise - and a Tony nomination - and years from now people will talk about.

Moore,"[0, 0]","Lonny Price's ""Company,"" based on the 2007 Broadway production by John Doyle, is one of the greatest film versions I have ever seen of a staged musical. At the outset, I must say I was too young to see the original Harold Prince production with Dean Jones and Elaine Stritch, so I cannot compare the two. Doyle gave ""Company"" the same treatment he gave ""Sweeney Todd"" a couple of years before, with a bare stage and the performers playing musical instruments as well as acting and singing. Doyle's ""Sweeney Todd"" just didn't work for me; the bare stage and musical instruments distanced me from the story, which really needs to sweep the audience up in its bloody embrace. But ""Company,"" with its anecdotal structure and extreme dependence on the songs to put the story across, fits perfectly with Doyle's method. At its best this DVD reaches a white-hot intensity, its musical numbers uniquely mesmerizing and haunting.The songs in ""Company"" are among the greatest Stephen Sondheim ever wrote, and this production has first-rate singer-actors to put them across. Any discussion of the singing and acting has to begin and end with Raul Esparza, who is galvanizing in the main role of Bobby. Handsome and charismatic but in a slightly bedraggled way, Esparza is perfect as a man drifting passively through life, seeking connection and yet terrified of it. Esparza's singing in such classic numbers as ""Marry Me a Little"" and ""Being Alive"" is nothing short of glorious. Of course, great performances don't exist in a vacuum, and the other performers in ""Company"" are a match for Esparza, paticularly the women. I will always cherish the memory of Heather Laws' hilarious confusion in ""Getting Married Today,"" a brilliant update on the patter songs of Gilbert & Sullivan; of Barbara Walsh belting ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" as if she were trying to short out the cameras; of Angel Desai's superb version of ""Another Hundred People;"" of Desai, Kelly Jeanne Grant and Elizabeth Stanley tearing up the stage (and their saxophones) in ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy;"" of Stanley and Esparza's tender-acerbic ""Barcelona;"" and so on, and so on.The bonus section of this DVD includes fascinating interviews with Sondheim, Esparza and Doyle, making this version of ""Company"" a real bargain and a real treat for anyone who loves the musical theatre.",5,Extraordinary and energizing.,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,2334,"['Lonny', 'Price', 'Company', 'based', '2007', 'Broadway', 'production', 'John', 'Doyle', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'versions', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'staged', 'musical', 'outset', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'see', 'original', 'Harold', 'Prince', 'production', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'Doyle', 'gave', 'Company', 'same', 'treatment', 'gave', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'couple', 'years', 'bare', 'stage', 'performers', 'playing', 'musical', 'instruments', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'singing', 'Doyle', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'bare', 'stage', 'musical', 'instruments', 'distanced', 'story', 'really', 'sweep', 'audience', 'up', 'bloody', 'embrace', 'Company', 'anecdotal', 'structure', 'extreme', 'dependence', 'songs', 'put', 'story', 'perfectly', 'Doyle', 'method', 'best', 'DVD', 'white-hot', 'intensity', 'musical', 'numbers', 'uniquely', 'mesmerizing', 'haunting.The', 'songs', 'Company', 'are', 'greatest', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'ever', 'wrote', 'production', 'first-rate', 'singer-actors', 'put', 'discussion', 'singing', 'acting', 'begin', 'end', 'Raul', 'Esparza', 'who', 'galvanizing', 'main', 'role', 'Bobby', 'Handsome', 'charismatic', 'slightly', 'bedraggled', 'way', 'Esparza', 'perfect', 'man', 'drifting', 'passively', 'life', 'seeking', 'connection', 'yet', 'terrified', 'Esparza', 'singing', 'such', 'classic', 'numbers', 'Marry', 'Me', 'Little', 'Being', 'Alive', 'nothing', 'short', 'glorious', 'course', 'great', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'vacuum', 'other', 'performers', 'Company', 'are', 'match', 'Esparza', 'paticularly', 'women', 'will', 'always', 'cherish', 'memory', 'Heather', 'Laws', 'hilarious', 'confusion', 'Getting', 'Married', 'Today', 'brilliant', 'update', 'patter', 'songs', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'Barbara', 'Walsh', 'belting', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'were', 'trying', 'short', 'out', 'cameras', 'Angel', 'Desai', 'superb', 'version', 'Hundred', 'People', 'Desai', 'Kelly', 'Jeanne', 'Grant', 'Elizabeth', 'Stanley', 'tearing', 'up', 'stage', 'saxophones', 'Could', 'Drive', 'Person', 'Crazy', 'Stanley', 'Esparza', 'tender-acerbic', 'Barcelona', 'so', 'so', 'on.The', 'bonus', 'section', 'DVD', 'fascinating', 'interviews', 'Sondheim', 'Esparza', 'Doyle', 'making', 'version', 'Company', 'real', 'bargain', 'real', 'treat', 'anyone', 'who', 'musical', 'theatre']",N/A

Now that I am the age of the characters and a bit more seasoned in the ways of the world, however, I see things differnetly. This show is an emotional knock-out. Company is a gentle whirlwind of humor, desperation, hurt, love and alienation, delivered through great songs and quirky performances. The production and the material are amazing, wringing out thoughts and fears that I was not even aware were simmering below the surface.Raul Esparza has a Bob Newhart-type delivery that works well in playing Bobby, and the character is all too familiar to anyone who has been the lonely but loved buddy-brother-father confessor to an extended group of friends. The other actors are equally good.  While I don't have all of their names handy, I offer extensive applause to the women who played Amy, Marta, and JoAnn.  I also applaud Bruce Sabbath, who plays Larry with a sense of kindness and patience even though he knows he is underappreciated and mistreated by his wife.The staging and costuming evoke an upscale, Bobby Short-type piano lounge, communicating simultaneously a sense of Upper East Side glamour and urban world worriness.

It's a show that requires good acting and showcases outstanding acting. The ensemble numbers are beautiful. The Original Broadway Cast recording sounds very 1970s-ish, but the revival orchestration has updated the music to sound modern and classy. The musical has three of my favorite songs: ""Being Alive,"" ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" and ""Getting Married Today."" The show is funny and witty, but it carries a strong message, too. Marriage, in fact any kind of commitment, is a compromise. It sucks that when we choose one path, we close many others, but that's what life is about. Life is about making choices. There's nothing wrong with Bobby being a bachelor. The problem is that it's all he knows. He's never tried anything else. He's never made a choice; he's always waiting to see what other people do. Joanne's stinging number ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" reminds Bobby (and the audience) that you can sit around wasting your life pretending you're actually living it. Delusion is insidious. There are so many ways to waste time, whether it's going to fittings, taking in high art like Mahler symphonies and Pinter plays, mocking other people, surfing the internet (wait, that's not in the musical...)I loved Raul Esparza as Bobby. He played a very calm, sweet guy who gradually becomes more and more distraught about being as an outsider.  His rendition of ""Being Alive"" is amazing, beyond words.  The supporting cast is directed to be that -- ""supporting"" so if you're looking for an Elaine Strich-like ""Ladies"", get the OBC recording.  I like this choice, because it makes Bobby the focal point, as it should be.This revival is in the controversial John Doyle actor-doubling-as-musician style.  The fact that the instruments were onstage gave the musical a cabaret feel. The cabaret feel was enhanced by the simple, black costumes and mostly bare set. Marriage and relationships are an intimate topic and the intimate setting works wonderfuly. The piano was used very effectively. I liked seeing Marta sing while sitting on top of the piano. I liked watching Bobby clumsily climb on top of the piano (emphasizing that he's still a boyish voyeur). I liked how the actor stopped playing the piano and closed the keyboard case just as Barbara Walsh was finishing ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" There were some instances where the actors-playing-instruments concept didn't work, but for the most part, I enjoyed it and the great camera direction by Lonny Price made the actor movement not too distracting.",5,"A beautiful production, get it for Raul Esparza",1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,2614,"['Company', 'one', 'favorite', 'Sondheim', 'shows', 'so', 'far', 'others', 'being', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Sunday', 'Park', 'George', 'show', 'good', 'acting', 'showcases', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'numbers', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Original', 'Broadway', 'Cast', 'recording', 'sounds', 'very', '1970s-ish', 'revival', 'orchestration', 'updated', 'music', 'sound', 'modern', 'classy', 'musical', 'three', 'favorite', 'songs', 'Being', 'Alive', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'Getting', 'Married', 'Today', 'show', 'funny', 'witty', 'strong', 'message', 'too', 'Marriage', 'fact', 'kind', 'commitment', 'compromise', 'when', 'choose', 'one', 'path', 'close', 'many', 'others', 'what', 'life', 'Life', 'making', 'choices', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Bobby', 'being', 'bachelor', 'problem', 'never', 'tried', 'anything', 'else', 'never', 'made', 'choice', 'always', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'Joanne', 'stinging', 'number', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'Bobby', 'audience', 'can', 'sit', 'around', 'wasting', 'life', 'pretending', ""'re"", 'actually', 'living', 'Delusion', 'insidious', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'waste', 'time', 'going', 'fittings', 'taking', 'high', 'art', 'Mahler', 'symphonies', 'Pinter', 'plays', 'mocking', 'other', 'people', 'surfing', 'internet', 'wait', 'not', 'musical', 'loved', 'Raul', 'Esparza', 'Bobby', 'played', 'very', 'calm', 'sweet', 'guy', 'who', 'gradually', 'more', 'more', 'distraught', 'about', 'being', 'outsider', 'rendition', 'Being', 'Alive', 'amazing', 'words', 'supporting', 'cast', 'directed', 'be', 'supporting', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Elaine', 'Strich-like', 'Ladies', 'get', 'OBC', 'recording', 'choice', 'Bobby', 'focal', 'point', 'should', 'be.This', 'revival', 'controversial', 'John', 'Doyle', 'actor-doubling-as-musician', 'style', 'fact', 'instruments', 'were', 'onstage', 'gave', 'musical', 'cabaret', 'feel', 'cabaret', 'feel', 'was', 'enhanced', 'simple', 'black', 'costumes', 'mostly', 'bare', 'set', 'Marriage', 'relationships', 'are', 'intimate', 'topic', 'intimate', 'setting', 'wonderfuly', 'piano', 'was', 'used', 'very', 'effectively', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Marta', 'sing', 'sitting', 'top', 'piano', 'liked', 'watching', 'Bobby', 'clumsily', 'top', 'piano', 'emphasizing', 'still', 'boyish', 'voyeur', 'liked', 'how', 'actor', 'stopped', 'playing', 'piano', 'closed', 'keyboard', 'case', 'just', 'Barbara', 'Walsh', 'was', 'finishing', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'were', 'instances', 'where', 'actors-playing-instruments', 'concept', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'camera', 'direction', 'Lonny', 'Price', 'made', 'actor', 'movement', 'not', 'too', 'distracting']",N/A

Not only are the video and audio worthy of blu-ray and true high def - but the performances, concept and photography are first class. This is a musical that never had a wide audience due to its quirky approach, lack of a recognizable plot and sparse productions across the country. Having said this, COMPANY never received its due as the quality piece it is. This blu-ray production is perhaps the definitive COMPANY and what the original should have been. Any Broadway lover will delight in this version. The performances are first class. The musical numbers unique and delightful. The direction is well paced and methodical. If you missed it on Broadway (I didn't), you can enjoy it now in this stellar production. I find myself enjoying COMPANY more than I did in New York. The reasonable price for the disc is another appealing factor. The powers that be are missing the boat by not presenting more blu-ray Broadway musicals. The revival of SOUTH PACIFIC would be an obvious choice for a blu-ray feature. The fear that video presentations of B'way shows reduce attendance at live performances is old hat and can't be substantiated.

1147173,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B0014IC31G,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","The 2007 revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical Company, and likely the original as well, is a show peppered with painful truths and emotional heartbreak, but filled mostly with caricature. The serious subject matter is unfortunately often reduced to cartoonish images of marriage, which bog down the true heart and ambition of this musical.Company explores the lives of white upper-middle class New Yorkers and their relationship problems. The dialogue is typically blunt and up-front about this subject matter, which already sets the tone for an unrealistically ambitious musical; either Sondheim or book writer George Furth must view married people as constantly discussing their marriage, and how their lives are different relative to single people. This creates a very interesting commentary on contemporary romance, but also subverts who should be very real, three-dimensional people, into individuals who speak of themselves in the broad, sweeping strokes of marital status and love in the urban world.The excellent score, with witty lyrics and uncharacteristically catchy music (by Sondheim's standards), is broken down by clunky, unrealistic dialogue by Furth. There is a particular sequence towards the beginning, in which a playful ditty is broken up by a facepalm-worthy series of karate moves by one of the couples. The audience in the PBS recording of Company was roaring with laughter, so at least somebody liked it.Granted, this is a show about unhappy New Yorkers meant for an audience of middle-class, likely married, and probably cynical New Yorkers. Maybe I'm just the wrong demo for a musical like this, but even as a young man I recognize there is more to marriage than the caricature it is reduced to throughout most of the show.About halfway through, however, Company takes a sudden turn for the mature, with fantastic introspective songs such as ""Marry Me a Little,"" revealing the protagonist Bobby's inability both to commit and to find someone that would even have him. This, in my opinion, is the real heart of this show, of striking the balance between wanting independence and just finding somebody who's willing to have you. This sense of loneliness is what really hits home, for me at least, certainly more so than the bickering and unrelatable couples we deal with for most of the show.And maybe that's the point. Maybe Bobby starts out seeing his married friends as these cartoonish buffoons and he matures and sees that there is more to marriage than this ridiculous display (though that would be weirdly postmodern?). By the end of the show, Bobby and the quality of the script have both matured, hitting this emotionally tragic theme much stronger, such as in the excellent finale ""Being Alive.""My disappointment in Company is mostly from the fact that the show does hit these wonderful strong notes, and I wish this strength pervaded throughout the entire musical. It is certainly a very good play, but it only grazes the greatness that it could and should have achieved.",4,"Raul Esparza is great, the show is good",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,3010,"['2007', 'revival', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'Company', 'likely', 'original', 'well', 'show', 'peppered', 'painful', 'truths', 'emotional', 'heartbreak', 'filled', 'mostly', 'caricature', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'unfortunately', 'often', 'reduced', 'cartoonish', 'images', 'marriage', 'bog', 'down', 'true', 'heart', 'ambition', 'musical.Company', 'lives', 'white', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'relationship', 'problems', 'dialogue', 'typically', 'blunt', 'up-front', 'subject', 'matter', 'already', 'tone', 'unrealistically', 'ambitious', 'musical', 'Sondheim', 'book', 'writer', 'George', 'Furth', 'must', 'view', 'married', 'people', 'constantly', 'discussing', 'marriage', 'how', 'lives', 'are', 'different', 'relative', 'single', 'people', 'very', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'contemporary', 'romance', 'also', 'subverts', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'real', 'three-dimensional', 'people', 'individuals', 'who', 'speak', 'broad', 'sweeping', 'strokes', 'marital', 'status', 'love', 'urban', 'world.The', 'excellent', 'score', 'witty', 'lyrics', 'uncharacteristically', 'catchy', 'music', 'Sondheim', 'standards', 'broken', 'down', 'clunky', 'unrealistic', 'dialogue', 'Furth', 'particular', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'playful', 'ditty', 'broken', 'up', 'facepalm-worthy', 'series', 'karate', 'moves', 'one', 'couples', 'audience', 'PBS', 'recording', 'Company', 'was', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'so', 'least', 'somebody', 'liked', 'it.Granted', 'show', 'unhappy', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'meant', 'audience', 'middle-class', 'likely', 'married', 'probably', 'cynical', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'wrong', 'demo', 'musical', 'even', 'young', 'man', 'recognize', 'more', 'marriage', 'caricature', 'reduced', 'most', 'show.About', 'halfway', 'however', 'Company', 'sudden', 'turn', 'mature', 'fantastic', 'introspective', 'songs', 'such', 'Marry', 'Me', 'Little', 'revealing', 'protagonist', 'Bobby', 'inability', 'commit', 'find', 'someone', 'would', 'even', 'have', 'opinion', 'real', 'heart', 'show', 'striking', 'balance', 'wanting', 'independence', 'just', 'finding', 'somebody', 'who', 'willing', 'have', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'what', 'really', 'home', 'least', 'certainly', 'more', 'so', 'bickering', 'unrelatable', 'couples', 'deal', 'most', 'show.And', 'maybe', 'point', 'Maybe', 'Bobby', 'out', 'seeing', 'married', 'friends', 'cartoonish', 'buffoons', 'more', 'marriage', 'ridiculous', 'display', 'would', 'be', 'weirdly', 'postmodern', 'end', 'show', 'Bobby', 'quality', 'script', 'have', 'matured', 'hitting', 'emotionally', 'tragic', 'theme', 'much', 'stronger', 'such', 'excellent', 'finale', 'Being', 'Alive', 'disappointment', 'Company', 'mostly', 'fact', 'show', 'hit', 'wonderful', 'strong', 'notes', 'wish', 'strength', 'pervaded', 'entire', 'musical', 'certainly', 'very', 'good', 'play', 'only', 'greatness', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'achieved']",N/A
