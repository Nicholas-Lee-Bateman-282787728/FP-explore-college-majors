The story just falls flat and becomes a bunch of babel about pushing the human evolution up a few notches, sure, hit me up with some cool parasites doc. I want to be a super human, sounds great. Ian Patrick Williams is pretty creepy in his roll as Mason and really show me how bad old Richard Riehle is in his role as the man who may save the day. Now if your a Nora Kirkpatrick fan like I am you may have to see this flick. Nora has been in a bunch of TV shows and I think she really is the only resign to see this film. Christopher Shand is good in his roll as Justin and I look forward to seeing him in a good movie some day. But two or three good actors can not save a bad film in this case.
