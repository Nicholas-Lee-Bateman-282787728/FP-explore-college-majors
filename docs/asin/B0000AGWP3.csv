763068,A1SG5LXDO7TPY9,B0000AGWP3,John Robertson,"[27, 29]","I bought this for One of Our Aircraft Is Missing.  I had recorded this movie on VHS several years ago by chance, and it has become one of my favorite war movies, and I have long wished I could get it on DVD in the hopes of getting a better quality recording.For ""Missing"", the story centers around a British bomber crew who must bail out over occupied Netherlands and try to make their way back to Britain, with the help of various citizens and underground along the way.  I tend to like documentaries, and while this is drama, much of the footage and audio of bomber aircraft is authentic, as the movie was filmed in 1941.  This is not your typical war movie, though, somewhat also like a thriller.  It draws you in, and is cleverly written, making you wonder what will happen next.  The special effects for the time are very respectable.  I wish modern movies could incorporate some of the unusual story-telling production values used.  The transfer of the film is excellent, and has been remastered for multi-channel Dolby, and while there's only so much you can do with a period film's audio tracks, I was amazed how good it sounded over my surround-sound.  I can understand what the crew members are saying when they speak with oxygen masks attached to their faces, something the audio from my old VHS tape copy didn't allow.  The video quality is very good too.  This is not high-definition, but pictures are sharp.  There are some minor film artifacts from the original film, but it wouldn't be noticeable to most.  If you've never seen this movie and don't even care about the other two, buy the DVD just for this one movie.  Movie rating:  *****  Quality rating: ****(five stars is best possible using my ratings above.  I rate the whole DVD 5 stars just because of this one movie...my lower ratings on the other two movies shouldn't detract from this one movie which more than justified the purchase of the DVD on it's own, so geting two other movies are more like a bonus to me)""Spitfire"" tells the story of the lead designer of the venerable British fighter aircraft of the same name.  It's an interesting story, but war and history buffs are the main two audiences who'd want to watch this.  Video transfer is only average, likely limited by the original film and perhaps not surprising for an unrestored 60 year old film...somewhat blurry, with muddy audio.  Again, the history and occasional piece of footage from the time acts as a time tunnel, so if you're interested in the subject matter, it may be worth seeing at least once, but if you really want to know about the roots of the Supermarine Spitfire and can dispense with a bunch of make-believe drama, read a good history book on the subject.  Although I don't mind owning it, you can lead a happy life without ever seeing this movie.  This is no ""Dambusters"", which is a terrific example of another real-life plotline where a scientist/designer must overcome red-tape to develop and overcome hurdles on a significant invention.  I'm rating this movie with the presumption you found yourself to this review because you like war movies.  If you like musicals or Bogart or Pulp Fiction, this kind of movie is definitely not going to interest you.  If you liked Aviator, then it may interest you.  Movie Rating: **1/2  Quality Rating:  **1/2""We Dive At Dawn"" is a good war movie, but not a great war movie.  It tells the story of a submarine crew trying to sink the German battleship Brandenburg, but involves other story telling regarding their families, and some of the trial and tribulations of being at sea.  It has a somewhat lighter tone to it than some other war movies, but is quite interesting in parts.  Again, much of its value to me is seeing some authentic submarine operation from a movie filmed during the time in question.  I'm not sure if any of the actual story is based on fact, but much of the movie's drama is not convincing to a modern day viewer, although I personally don't mind this as it was typical of how movies were made at this time, and it helps one to see what it was like to be living through WWII.  If you've already seen most of the A-list war movies of the 1950's-1970's and are looking for lesser known war movies as I was, this is worth seeing.  The video quality is very good, with sharp pictures and good contrast.  Audio is very good too, though not quite as good as ""Missing"".  Movie Rating: ***  Quality Rating: ***1/2For all three movies, note they are in black and white, and there are no track marks or scene selections.  I didn't really care about this last point, but sometimes you want to review a scene.  To do so, you can only use your DVD player's fast forward/reverse keys, not track increment/decrement.  Also, there is a special feature called ""Mr Blabbermouth"" which is a curious movie reel showing interesting facts about the Axis' and Allies respective resources, and the defeatist thinking that some people had after Pearl Harbor.",5,One of these movies is no longer missing from my collection...,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,4958,"['bought', 'One', 'Aircraft', 'Is', 'Missing', 'had',
