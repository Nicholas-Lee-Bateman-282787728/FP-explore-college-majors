1217536,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B001MTYRJS,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 2]","When it comes to video game films, you're not going to find very many that are actually good. Here below are the ones I really enjoyed:1. Resident Evil films (Live-action trilogy and CGI film)2. Silent Hill3. Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children (I really want to see The Spirits Within, though)4. Tomb Raider films5. HitmanThose were the best video game films in my opinion. But Max Payne had some of the best potential to make something great and could have created an amazing action film if it had actually tried. The problem with Max Payne is that it feels lazy and didn't really feel like much of anyone actually gave a damn about the project. With the video game films I listed above, those were the films in which the makers actually cared and gave all their heart into these projects and coming with very entertaining films that either captured the spirit of the games they portrayed or (In the case of Silent Hill), they were dead-on with their source material. With a video game film, I try to not look at them as just video game films, I base my opinions on them by how much I'm entertained by them even if they don't completely follow their source material (The live-action RE trilogy was still really good and created their own identities as films and felt pretty original). Still, even when I look at Max Payne from that standpoint, it still doesn't do good even just as a film by itself. Unfortunately, Max Payne just falls flat as a film which is very disappointing.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Max Payne is a cop with a troubled past. His wife and baby were murdered (As they were in the game). But Max Payne is a man seeking revenge against the third killer who was never caught. There's a strange drug being used on the streets called Valkyr manufactured by a corporation called Aesir. The drug makes the user see demonic angels and they go crazy but the addiction is insatiable and people keep using it and keep dying because of it. Max is then accused of the murder of a woman named Natasha and a friend of his and is now on the run from the law. Then he meets up with Natasha's sister; Mona (Played Mila Kunis of Family Guy and That 70's Show fame) and he and Mona are on a mission of revenge and taking down the corporation who manufactured the drug and the drug users who use it. The script as a person will realize as they go along is a sloppy and poorly written hackneyed mess.MUSIC: The music is good as a whole, and is one of the reasons this film gets saved from the pit of suck. It's well-done and generally fits the mood.ACTING: This area is awful. The actors fell into two categories. 1. They were bored and didn't really care that they were in the film. 2. They were half-asleep through their roles (Mark Wahlberg, I'm talking to you). The dialogue is also a pretty bad mess and was also pretty boring.ACTION: After all my harsh criticisms how does this film get a 6? The action scenes are the main thing that actually save this film from sucking. Although the film doesn't really pick up steam until half way through, the action scenes are fairly well-done for the most part (Especially near the end). However,not all the action scenes were good, like the parts that used a lot of slow-motion. The worst action scene was when Max Payne is shooting backwards. This scene lasts almost 40 seconds! Forty seconds of Max Payne bending backwards to shoot! But at least this film has some good shootouts which lets this film just barely avoid sucking. I also liked the noir-esque feeling of the film that tried to feel somewhat like the cinematic masterpiece Sin City. I appreciated these parts, but they're not enough to make the film any better.OVERALL: A very cautionary rental. This film will not blow you away. This film will not amaze you. It does nothing new or very interesting. It's mostly a shallow action film that only tries to milk the Max Payne name for whatever it's worth. I would recommend Twentieth Century Fox's previous video game film; Hitman long before I'd recommend Max Payne. Hitman is far more entertaining and a far more engrossing action film. Try the other video game films I listed at the beginning of the review long before trying Max Payne. I'm not saying Max Payne is bad, it's just not that good. Rent before you buy.THE GOOD: Most of the action scenes, some nice CGI-effects and a noir-esque feeling, and the music.THE BAD: The slow-motion action scenes, the acting, and the script are an awful mess.",3,DISAPPOINTING...  6 OUT OF 10,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,4448,"['When', 'video', 'game', 'films', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'very', 'many', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'Here', 'are', 'ones', 'really', 'enjoyed:1', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'films', 'Live-action', 'trilogy', 'CGI', 'film', '2', 'Silent', 'Hill3', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'Advent', 'Children', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'though', '4', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'films5', 'HitmanThose', 'were', 'best', 'video', 'game', 'films', 'opinion', 'Max', 'Payne', 'had', 'best', 'potential', 'make', 'something', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'amazing', 'action', 'film', 'had', 'actually', 'tried', 'problem', 'Max', 'Payne', 'lazy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'much', 'anyone', 'actually', 'gave', 'damn', 'project', 'video', 'game', 'films', 'listed', 'were', 'films', 'makers', 'actually', 'cared', 'gave', 'heart', 'projects', 'coming', 'very', 'entertaining', 'films', 'captured', 'spirit', 'games', 'portrayed', 'case', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'were', 'dead-on', 'source', 'material', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'try', 'not', 'look', 'just', 'video', 'game', 'films', 'base', 'opinions', 'how', 'much', ""'m"", 'entertained', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'follow', 'source', 'material', 'live-action', 'RE', 'trilogy', 'was', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'created', 'own', 'identities', 'films', 'felt', 'pretty', 'original', 'Still', 'even', 'when', 'look', 'Max', 'Payne', 'standpoint', 'still', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'even', 'just', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Max', 'Payne', 'just', 'flat', 'film', 'very', 'disappointing.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Max', 'Payne', 'cop', 'troubled', 'past', 'wife', 'baby', 'were', 'murdered', 'were', 'game', 'Max', 'Payne', 'man', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'third', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'strange', 'drug', 'being', 'used', 'streets', 'called', 'Valkyr', 'manufactured', 'corporation', 'called', 'Aesir', 'drug', 'user', 'see', 'demonic', 'angels', 'go', 'crazy', 'addiction', 'insatiable', 'people', 'keep', 'using', 'keep', 'dying', 'Max', 'then', 'accused', 'murder', 'woman', 'named', 'Natasha', 'friend', 'now', 'run', 'law', 'Then', 'up', 'Natasha', 'sister', 'Mona', 'Played', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Family', 'Guy', '70', 'Show', 'fame', 'Mona', 'are', 'mission', 'revenge', 'taking', 'down', 'corporation', 'who', 'manufactured', 'drug', 'drug', 'users', 'who', 'use', 'script', 'person', 'will', 'realize', 'go', 'along', 'sloppy', 'poorly', 'written', 'hackneyed', 'mess.MUSIC', 'music', 'good', 'whole', 'one', 'reasons', 'film', 'saved', 'pit', 'suck', 'well-done', 'generally', 'mood.ACTING', 'area', 'awful', 'actors', 'fell', 'two', 'categories', '1', 'were', 'bored', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'were', 'film', '2', 'were', 'half-asleep', 'roles', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', ""'m"", 'talking', 'dialogue', 'also', 'pretty', 'bad', 'mess', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'boring.ACTION', 'harsh', 'criticisms', 'how', 'film', 'get', '6', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'main', 'thing', 'actually', 'save', 'film', 'sucking', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'steam', 'way', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'well-done', 'most', 'part', 'Especially', 'end', 'However', 'not', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'parts', 'used', 'lot', 'slow-motion', 'worst', 'action', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Max', 'Payne', 'shooting', 'backwards', 'scene', 'almost', '40', 'seconds', 'Forty', 'seconds', 'Max', 'Payne', 'bending', 'backwards', 'shoot', 'least', 'film', 'good', 'shootouts', 'film', 'just', 'barely', 'avoid', 'sucking', 'also', 'liked', 'noir-esque', 'feeling', 'film', 'tried', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Sin', 'City', 'appreciated', 'parts', ""'re"", 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'better.OVERALL', 'very', 'cautionary', 'rental', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'blow', 'away', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'amaze', 'nothing', 'new', 'very', 'interesting', 'mostly', 'shallow', 'action', 'film', 'only', 'milk', 'Max', 'Payne', 'name', 'whatever', 'worth', 'would', 'recommend', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'previous', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'Hitman', 'long', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Max', 'Payne', 'Hitman', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'far', 'more', 'engrossing', 'action', 'film', 'Try', 'other', 'video', 'game', 'films', 'listed', 'beginning', 'review', 'long', 'before', 'trying', 'Max', 'Payne', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Max', 'Payne', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'Rent', 'buy.THE', 'GOOD', 'Most', 'action', 'scenes', 'nice', 'CGI-effects', 'noir-esque', 'feeling', 'music.THE', 'BAD', 'slow-motion', 'action', 'scenes', 'acting', 'script', 'are', 'awful', 'mess']",N/A

However, I have a gripe, something that was bugging me throughout the movie. What NYC are these scenes being based on? I mean where in NYC is there no traffic and relative isolation. For the most part most of the scenes in this film only had the characters in the movie- WTH? Most films based in NY have the scenery right, so if you have never been to NYC most films get it right- yes its that populated, and that heavily trafficked thus the city that never sleeps. Even in the suburban areas of this city, to walk for blocks with no one else around????? This was especially ludicrous for the scenes whose background was Manhattan.

1217541,A16ZKEWQ6DLO45,B001MTYRJS,amerk,"[0, 0]","!!!WARNING: SPOILERS!!!Lately, I've grown tired of going to the theaters and shelling out 8 bucks a person to see a film that more than likely will end up in a video store a few months later that I can then watch on my big screen in the comfort of my own home. But Max Payne was different. I've played through the first game more than once, watched all the trailers, and had to see it on opening night. Needless to say, I was really surprised. The movie was well-paced, dark and gritty, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long while. I've watched it again just recently on the Special Edition and enjoyed it even more.I was on the fence for awhile on whether to give this a 4- or 5-star rating, and finally decided to settle with 4 for a couple of reasons:1. I applaud the movie in taking the direction that it did, knowing that it would not follow the game exactly, but so much had changed that I had to sit back and wonder why. Couldn't they have at leat kept some of the more supporting characters, such as the Mafia? The relationship between Max, the Mafia, and the Russian Mob is integral to the plot and partially the reason for the game's sequel.2. BB listed as the main villain. This one's a minor afterthought, although I do like how Beau Bridges has the name BB in it (did anybody other than me catch this?). At first I wasn't sure he fit the part, but as the movie progressed, and events unfolded, he started to fit in nicely. However, he always felt like a secondary villain in the movie; and technically he is, considering that Nicole Horn is pulling the strings. So why on earth would they make him the last person Max Payne had to contend with? Aside from playing the game and seeing the graphic novel feature included with the Special Edition, you would have known Nicole was corrupt but never know whether she pulled the strings on Michelle's murder or not. And the only thing revealed in the scene after the credits is that her company's profits sky-rocketed. So what? Are they going to stop her from making a buck, do they have evidence linking her to the murders, anything? No, just that her profits are up. I really think they could have wrapped up the movie by having her die at the end, like in the game, but for whatever reason chose to keep her alive.In any case, the positives far outweighted the negatives, the action was top-notch (never overdone), and the atmosphere was perfect. My only question is that when, and if, a sequel comes out will the sequel be based on the game's sequel (in which Nicole is already dead), or follow a completely different storyline, one in which Nicole is still alive?One possible suggestion is that they are planning a trilogy of some sort. The first sequel would perhaps be the second part of the first game (revealing the Mafia, the Mob, and Nicole's involvement and finally her death), and the second sequel would continue the story of the second game.",4,Top Notch Action Thriller,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,2922,"['WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'Lately', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'tired', 'going', 'theaters', 'shelling', 'out', '8', 'bucks', 'person', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'likely', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'video', 'store', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'can', 'then', 'watch', 'big', 'screen', 'comfort', 'own', 'home', 'Max', 'Payne', 'was', 'different', ""'ve"", 'played', 'first', 'game', 'more', 'once', 'watched', 'trailers', 'had', 'see', 'opening', 'night', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', 'well-paced', 'dark', 'gritty', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'while', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'again', 'just', 'recently', 'Special', 'Edition', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more.I', 'was', 'fence', 'awhile', 'give', '4-', '5-star', 'rating', 'finally', 'decided', 'settle', '4', 'couple', 'reasons:1', 'applaud', 'movie', 'taking', 'direction', 'did', 'knowing', 'would', 'not', 'follow', 'game', 'exactly', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'changed', 'had', 'sit', 'back', 'wonder', 'why', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'leat', 'kept', 'more', 'supporting', 'characters', 'such', 'Mafia', 'relationship', 'Max', 'Mafia', 'Russian', 'Mob', 'integral', 'plot', 'partially', 'reason', 'game', 'sequel.2', 'BB', 'listed', 'main', 'villain', 'one', 'minor', 'afterthought', 'do', 'how', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'name', 'BB', 'did', 'anybody', 'other', 'catch', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'part', 'movie', 'progressed', 'events', 'unfolded', 'started', 'fit', 'nicely', 'However', 'always', 'felt', 'secondary', 'villain', 'movie', 'technically', 'considering', 'Nicole', 'Horn', 'pulling', 'strings', 'So', 'why', 'earth', 'would', 'make', 'last', 'person', 'Max', 'Payne', 'had', 'contend', 'Aside', 'playing', 'game', 'seeing', 'graphic', 'novel', 'feature', 'included', 'Special', 'Edition', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'Nicole', 'was', 'corrupt', 'never', 'know', 'pulled', 'strings', 'Michelle', 'murder', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'revealed', 'scene', 'credits', 'company', 'profits', 'sky-rocketed', 'what', 'Are', 'going', 'stop', 'making', 'buck', 'do', 'have', 'evidence', 'linking', 'murders', 'anything', 'No', 'just', 'profits', 'are', 'up', 'really', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'wrapped', 'up', 'movie', 'having', 'die', 'end', 'game', 'reason', 'chose', 'keep', 'alive.In', 'case', 'positives', 'far', 'outweighted', 'negatives', 'action', 'was', 'top-notch', 'never', 'overdone', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'perfect', 'only', 'question', 'when', 'sequel', 'out', 'will', 'sequel', 'be', 'based', 'game', 'sequel', 'Nicole', 'already', 'dead', 'follow', 'completely', 'different', 'storyline', 'one', 'Nicole', 'still', 'alive', 'One', 'possible', 'suggestion', 'are', 'planning', 'trilogy', 'sort', 'first', 'sequel', 'would', 'perhaps', 'be', 'second', 'part', 'first', 'game', 'revealing', 'Mafia', 'Mob', 'Nicole', 'involvement', 'finally', 'death', 'second', 'sequel', 'would', 'continue', 'story', 'second', 'game']",N/A

Was very happy to see one awesome bullet-time effect (although a little dissapointed that there weren't more of them).  Some of these scenes are downright gorgeous (in a dark gothic manner).*Fans of the game will recognize many similar things between the game and the movie.*Photography is excellent.*Storyline is not bad.  Remains largely true to the original video game, and even bears many of the same sequences.*Music is good (although not as much rock/metal as there was in the game).The Bad Things*Some slow parts.*Some things don't seem to be fully developed.  Also, even though many things are true to the game, some things remain missing.  I found it particuarly dissapointing that the story's main villian was so strong in the game, but seems weak in the film (and they didn't even get to kill her.  Will they make a second movie?).The Questionable Things*The characters are okay, but nothing to scream about (it's particuarly dissapointing since the characters in the game were so great, emotional, and well-developed).*The movie ends with a ""what, that's it?"" kind of feeling.First of all, this resembles less of an action movie and more of a crime drama.  Some may even call it film-noir (but I don't think it captured the spirit if film noir as effectively as the game).  Secondly, as I may have said over and over, many things are just not as good as from the original game (which was incredibly awesome, both as a violent shooting game and as a respectable story).  With all this in mind, I found this film to be pretty respectable.  It is well-made and has its share of awesome scenes.  If you can forgive this movie of its flaws, it's good in its own right and would reccomend it to anybody looking for a stylish film-noir crime drama.

Sure it could of had more action but the beginning of the movie was character development. It seems like most people were expecting action on the level of ""Shoot Em Up"", but we have to understand that Max Payne's story is a little more deeper then that. Its about a man who is being tormented at the fact that the murderers of his wife and child are at large, and he will stop at nothing until he seeks his vengeance. The only criticism I give it is that the fight with Sgt Lupino was cut short by a bullet, they should have let them fight to the death. I have to say that this movie is one of the best if not the best video game adapted movie, although ""Hitman"" was right up there as well. Remember the Matrix the first hour and half was nothing but story and character development, but when the action kicked in it was incredible.

Lets face it nine out of ten times videogames do not translate into good movies. I did rent it this past weekend from Netflix though and watched it with my girlfriend who knows nothing about the games but loved the movie.Here is the story in the movie. The movie starts off a week into the future we see Max played by Mark Wahlberg floating to the bottom of the icy ocean, we hear a brief narrative by the title character and then go back a week earlier. Max works in the Cold Case unit of the police department, where he spends most of his time investigating the murder of his wife Michelle, and baby. An informant Trevor leads Max to three drug addicts in an empty train station. (just like the games the drug Valkyr plays a big part in this movie) After a botched robbery attempt Max interrogates one of them about his family's murder, after getting no results Max heads back to Trevor's apartment where there is a party going on and meets Natasha Sax. Natasha gets into a fight with her sister Mona and heads into the back area of the party where partiers are using Valkyr. Max follows Natasha to the back room where he has a brief run in with one of the main villians of the movie Jack Lupino. Here Max notices a tattoo on Natasha and wants to question her about it, he brings her back to his apartment where she tries to seduce him. Max kicks her out, and while walking the streets calling Lupino for her next fix of the drug Valkyr she starts to hallucinate(the drug Valkyr causes users to hallucinate about angels of death flying around them). The next morning Natash is found dead in the alley with Max's wallet, this causes Max to become a prime suspect in her murder, and also puts him at the top of Mona Sax's hitlist. Mona by the way is a trained assasin and shady buisness women. The rest of the movie Max has to evade the police while trying to find the killers of his family and the link to the drug Valkyr as well as to the company his wife worked for the Aesir Corporation.It's been a long time since I played the games to I can't remember the story exactly but from what I can remember they are pretty similar. In the game Max was an undercover drug enforcement agent if I remember correctly, but the setup is pretty much the same. I also would like to comment that the art direction in this movie fits the game perfectly, and really sets the dark tone of the movie. The action sequences are also shot very nicely including the signature bullet time slowmotion effect the games made famous. I must say I was surprised with this movie, I expected some crap movie that just took advantage of the name of a successful game franchise, but the movie did great on its own, like I said at the top of the review my girlfriend who knows nothing of videogames was really into it. I am going to give this movie a 3 out of 5 it's definitely worth a rental if not a buy. Also note the dvd had the option for theatrical version or directors cut, I choose directors cut so my review is based on that.",3,"Really good, for a video game adaption",1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,3102,"['Max', 'Payne', 'came', 'out', '2008', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'movies', 'even', 'am', 'fan', 'games', 'face', 'nine', 'ten', 'times', 'videogames', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'good', 'movies', 'did', 'rent', 'past', 'weekend', 'Netflix', 'watched', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'nothing', 'games', 'loved', 'movie.Here', 'story', 'movie', 'movie', 'week', 'future', 'see', 'Max', 'played', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'floating', 'bottom', 'icy', 'ocean', 'hear', 'brief', 'narrative', 'title', 'character', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'week', 'earlier', 'Max', 'Cold', 'Case', 'unit', 'police', 'department', 'where', 'most', 'time', 'investigating', 'murder', 'wife', 'Michelle', 'baby', 'informant', 'Trevor', 'Max', 'three', 'drug', 'addicts', 'empty', 'train', 'station', 'just', 'games', 'drug', 'Valkyr', 'big', 'part', 'movie', 'botched', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'Max', 'one', 'family', 'murder', 'getting', 'results', 'Max', 'back', 'Trevor', 'apartment', 'where', 'party', 'going', 'meets', 'Natasha', 'Sax', 'Natasha', 'fight', 'sister', 'Mona', 'heads', 'back', 'area', 'party', 'where', 'partiers', 'are', 'using', 'Valkyr', 'Max', 'Natasha', 'back', 'room', 'where', 'brief', 'run', 'one', 'main', 'villians', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Lupino', 'Here', 'Max', 'tattoo', 'Natasha', 'question', 'back', 'apartment', 'where', 'seduce', 'Max', 'out', 'walking', 'streets', 'calling', 'Lupino', 'next', 'fix', 'drug', 'Valkyr', 'hallucinate', 'drug', 'Valkyr', 'users', 'hallucinate', 'angels', 'death', 'flying', 'next', 'morning', 'Natash', 'found', 'dead', 'alley', 'Max', 'wallet', 'Max', 'become', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'also', 'top', 'Mona', 'Sax', 'hitlist', 'Mona', 'way', 'trained', 'assasin', 'shady', 'buisness', 'women', 'rest', 'movie', 'Max', 'evade', 'police', 'trying', 'find', 'killers', 'family', 'link', 'drug', 'Valkyr', 'as', 'well', 'company', 'wife', 'worked', 'Aesir', 'Corporation.It', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'played', 'games', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'story', 'exactly', 'what', 'can', 'remember', 'are', 'pretty', 'similar', 'game', 'Max', 'was', 'undercover', 'drug', 'enforcement', 'agent', 'remember', 'correctly', 'setup', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'also', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'art', 'direction', 'movie', 'game', 'perfectly', 'really', 'dark', 'tone', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'shot', 'very', 'nicely', 'including', 'signature', 'bullet', 'time', 'slowmotion', 'effect', 'games', 'made', 'famous', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'surprised', 'movie', 'expected', 'crap', 'movie', 'just', 'took', 'advantage', 'name', 'successful', 'game', 'franchise', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'own', 'said', 'top', 'review', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'nothing', 'videogames', 'was', 'really', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'movie', '3', '5', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental', 'not', 'buy', 'Also', 'note', 'dvd', 'had', 'option', 'theatrical', 'version', 'directors', 'cut', 'choose', 'directors', 'cut', 'so', 'review', 'based']",N/A

He put very little into his role in The Happening, perhaps because he realized that the film would be one of the worst ever made. He had a lot more to work with in Max Payne, and he performed with power and conviction.Wahlberg portrayed the title character, an NYPD detective whose life was ruined when his beloved wife and child were murdered. The case is not solved. Payne rots away, ending up in the basement, literally and figuratively, where he works cold cases. He is consumed by the death of his family and continues the investigation on his own.I enjoyed this film. It's about primal forces that drive human existence: devotion to family, hunger for revenge, the ability to endure. And all along there are powers that apparently cannot be understood and will not be controlled.The film features flying monsters (angels?) brought to life by a powerful drug produced by an evil pharmaceutical company. It seems that the effect of these monsters depends upon the nature of the drug's consumer, an interesting premise.The art deco sets, the omnipresent slo-mo snowflakes, the dark and dreary big-city streets and alleys, all create an intense feeling of combined hope and menace.",5,It's Happening Here,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,1303,"['contrast', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'performance', 'Happening', 'performance', 'Max', 'Payne', 'almost', 'startling', 'put', 'very', 'little', 'role', 'Happening', 'perhaps', 'realized', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'ever', 'made', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'Max', 'Payne', 'performed', 'power', 'conviction.Wahlberg', 'portrayed', 'title', 'character', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'life', 'was', 'ruined', 'when', 'beloved', 'wife', 'child', 'were', 'murdered', 'case', 'not', 'solved', 'Payne', 'away', 'ending', 'up', 'basement', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'where', 'cold', 'cases', 'consumed', 'death', 'family', 'investigation', 'own.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'primal', 'forces', 'drive', 'human', 'existence', 'devotion', 'family', 'hunger', 'revenge', 'ability', 'endure', 'are', 'powers', 'apparently', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'controlled.The', 'film', 'features', 'flying', 'monsters', 'angels', 'brought', 'life', 'powerful', 'drug', 'produced', 'evil', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'effect', 'monsters', 'nature', 'drug', 'consumer', 'interesting', 'premise.The', 'art', 'deco', 'sets', 'omnipresent', 'slo-mo', 'snowflakes', 'dark', 'dreary', 'big-city', 'streets', 'alleys', 'create', 'intense', 'feeling', 'combined', 'hope', 'menace']",N/A

How minor characters who haven't gotten very far in their lives (say, a down-and-out tattoo artist) always seem to know crucial historical details that the more educated investigators can't seem to figure out for themselves?  How the investigators suddenly discover evidence at the most crucial moment, despite the fact that it's been right under their nose (as they themselves are fond of saying) the entire movie?  How one man with a pistol (who never reloads) manages to survive an assault by an entire team of machine gun wielding sharpshooters?""Max Payne"" features all of these action movie cliches and more.  There's a plot in here, somewhere: a detective still trying to solve his wife's murder, stumbles upon to a case that, golly gee, just so happens to coincide with that one relatively minor case a while back.  And, thrown into the mix, are a bunch of tattooed creeps and a very attractive woman who likes to wear leather.The problem with ""Max Payne"" isn't that it's a mindless action movie with no soul whatsoever (I'm pretty sure it doesn't even have a pulse); the problem is the film takes itself way too seriously, and actually tries to be something more than it is--indeed, more than it ever could be.  Wahlberg has the brooding detective role down pat; he played it to perfection in ""The Departed;"" after his Oscar-nominated performance in that film, he seems to have resigned himself to making dull, unremarkable movies that completely waste his talent.  Amaury Nolasco is chilling and menacing enough, but he's playing a role that's been played in pretty much every other action movie ever filmed.  Mila Kunis is a talented comedic actress, and she looks great in black, but she should really stick to what she's good at; all she can do here is look menacingly at her costars and spit out lines that are far below her.  Olga Kurylenko, the latest Bond girl, should simply go back to modeling.So, to sum everything up: ""Max Payne"" could have been a great waste of time (a mindless popcorn flick with some great action and an interesting plot), but alas, it's merely a mindless romp with no real point to it.  There's nothing new, nothing really interesting.

1217561,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001MTYRJS,David J. Brown,"[1, 3]","Okay, I just saw this movie last night.  I was kind of looking forward to it.  I like Wahlberg and the film looked visually cool.  I've never played the game, never really heard of it, but due to the title I figured it was either a video game or a comic I've never heard of.  Putting on a movie based on a game is never something I'm overly-excited about, plus with the addition of the director John Moore(directed terrible remake of The Omen, Behind Enemy Lines, and the not so bad remake of Flight of the Pheonix) I started feeling less and less excited about this movie's prospects.Well, lets just say the movie isn't terrible and it's a long way from great or even good.  The trailers that I saw led me to believe this had strong supernatural or horror elements to it, one of the reasons I was intrigued to watch it.*SPOILERS*  Well, it doesn't at all.  Despite its stylized look, color scheme, or the fact that angel like creatures appear every once in a while.  They aren't really there you see, they are hullicinations of the psychotic soldiers and various others that take a blue liquid drug(they drink it of course, no needles allowed in a PG-13 movie).  I was okay with this.  It was the only unexpected twist this clunker offered.  Part of me was sad that there was no supernatural elements but another was happy to have a kink in the mundane plot.This is your basic police detective looking for revenge story. *SPOILERS*  I'm sorry to say but the whole movie is really easy to figure out about fifteen minutes in.  The only part I didn't get yet was the flying creatures, but in about 20 more minutes that becomes obvious and then there's nothing really interesting done with the concept beyond the dopey climax, where our hero is all doped up and maniacal has he shoots everyone.  This is basic connect the dots screenwriting and it's so ham-fisted that the only type of people who could possibly be entertained would be those who have never seen a film before...EVER.  And that's actually not necessarily a fact.  Once we meet Donal Logue's character you know he's dead, once you know that Wahlberg's dead wife worked for a drug company and everyone is downing viles of a blue drug, you know they were in on her death, as soon as Beau Bridges shows up as a friendly face and head of security for the drug company you know he's the main bad-guy, and so on...There's one scene which I love the most.  It's towrads the middle when our dynamic duo of Mila Kunis and Wahlberg find out that all the victims in the story are linked by an angel-wing tattoo.  They track down the spot where one victim got the tattoo and the tattoo artist not only knows the meaning of the wings, he even has books about the subject, right next to him on the counter.  It's like he read the screenplay and knew which materials he needed to have.  Lame.  Plus, can anyone tell me why the Mila Kunis character was in this thing?  She wasn't interesting and the help she provides Wahlberg could've been acheived a million different ways on his own.The acting is capable.  There's no bad performances, but there's no characters to play either.  Eveyone is just competent.  The visuals are the only memorable thing about this film.  I liked the snowy atmosphere and muted look of the film.  John Moore is a really good visualist.  He'd make a good director of photography, special effects technician or concept artist.  Unfortunately, he's the director and he is not very good at that.  He's like Michael Bay that way.  Though, Bay is getting better wtih his last two flicks having stronger material.  Maybe Moore will get better too, but four films in and we only have one decent remake...",2,Another mediocre video game based flick,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,3673,"['Okay', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'kind', 'looking', 'forward', 'like', 'Wahlberg', 'film', 'looked', 'visually', 'cool', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'game', 'never', 'really', 'heard', 'due', 'title', 'figured', 'was', 'video', 'game', 'comic', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Putting', 'movie', 'based', 'game', 'never', 'something', ""'m"", 'overly-excited', 'addition', 'director', 'John', 'Moore', 'directed', 'terrible', 'remake', 'Omen', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'remake', 'Flight', 'Pheonix', 'started', 'feeling', 'less', 'less', 'excited', 'movie', 'prospects.Well', 'just', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'long', 'way', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'trailers', 'saw', 'led', 'believe', 'had', 'strong', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'elements', 'one', 'reasons', 'was', 'intrigued', 'watch', '*SPOILERS*', 'Well', ""n't"", 'stylized', 'look', 'color', 'scheme', 'fact', 'creatures', 'appear', 'once', 'while', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'are', 'hullicinations', 'psychotic', 'soldiers', 'various', 'others', 'take', 'blue', 'liquid', 'drug', 'drink', 'course', 'needles', 'allowed', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'was', 'only', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'clunker', 'offered', 'Part', 'was', 'sad', 'was', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'was', 'happy', 'have', 'kink', 'mundane', 'plot.This', 'basic', 'police', 'detective', 'looking', 'revenge', 'story', '*SPOILERS*', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'only', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'yet', 'was', 'flying', 'creatures', 'about', '20', 'more', 'minutes', 'obvious', 'then', 'nothing', 'really', 'interesting', 'done', 'concept', 'dopey', 'climax', 'where', 'hero', 'doped', 'up', 'maniacal', 'everyone', 'basic', 'connect', 'dots', 'screenwriting', 'so', 'ham-fisted', 'only', 'type', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'entertained', 'would', 'be', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'EVER', 'actually', 'not', 'necessarily', 'fact', 'meet', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'character', 'know', 'dead', 'once', 'know', 'Wahlberg', 'dead', 'wife', 'worked', 'drug', 'company', 'everyone', 'downing', 'viles', 'blue', 'drug', 'know', 'were', 'death', 'as', 'soon', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'up', 'friendly', 'face', 'head', 'security', 'drug', 'company', 'know', 'main', 'bad-guy', 'so', 'one', 'scene', 'love', 'most', 'middle', 'when', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Wahlberg', 'find', 'out', 'victims', 'story', 'are', 'linked', 'angel-wing', 'tattoo', 'track', 'down', 'spot', 'where', 'one', 'victim', 'got', 'tattoo', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'not', 'only', 'meaning', 'wings', 'even', 'books', 'subject', 'right', 'next', 'counter', 'read', 'screenplay', 'knew', 'materials', 'needed', 'have', 'Lame', 'can', 'anyone', 'tell', 'why', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'character', 'was', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'help', 'Wahlberg', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'acheived', 'million', 'different', 'ways', 'own.The', 'acting', 'capable', 'bad', 'performances', 'characters', 'play', 'either', 'Eveyone', 'just', 'competent', 'visuals', 'are', 'only', 'memorable', 'thing', 'film', 'liked', 'snowy', 'atmosphere', 'muted', 'look', 'film', 'John', 'Moore', 'really', 'good', 'visualist', ""'d"", 'make', 'good', 'director', 'photography', 'special', 'effects', 'technician', 'concept', 'artist', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'way', 'Though', 'Bay', 'getting', 'better', 'wtih', 'last', 'two', 'flicks', 'having', 'stronger', 'material', 'Maybe', 'Moore', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'too', 'four', 'films', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'decent', 'remake']",N/A

I had read the Amazon reviews and put off for a long time not buying the blu ray.  Finally I did and I found the movie to be quite entertaining and very well made.  I thought that all of the actors did a good job in their roles.  Wahlberg is a 'movie star' not an actor and for those who have said that he gives the same performance, well he does.  But he's fun to watch and after seeing his various films for more than 10 years everyone in the audience should know what they are getting when they purchase a ticket.This is the second graphic novel that I've watched the first being 30 Days of Night and like that film reviewers still make comparisons to the books.  I always thought that was ridiculous.  Its apples and oranges.  The film is a fun ride and decent watch.  The trailer pretty much sums up what you'll get so if you like the trailer buy the disc which is in a word superb.

1217569,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001MTYRJS,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 3]","MAX PAYNEIt seems that while most movies based on a game are usually poorly received [and usually for good reason] Hollywood continues to make these movies in hopes that fans of the game will come out to see the movie. Now I am not one of those people who are against this concept as I have enjoyed most of those movies, including this one. Now this film is far from a classic and to be honest isn't great but it is good. I tend to turn the old brain off when watching any movie because I like to be entertained, but at the same time you can't like everything. This movie is one of those that you really want to be great but it just ends up as ok.The story follows Max Payne a man on a mission and that mission is finding the person who killed his wife, he already got some. Max makes his way through the city, the suburbs, and even ice filled water all in hopes of catching this guy, and to be fair he wasn't in that last place by choice. It seems that there are demons running around killing people or maybe that is just a drug, don't worry I really am not ruining anything for you. From here he moves on to one clue after another with some girl helping him along the way who at one time wanted him dead. Also he has a cop or two on his side or so it seems, once again not ruining a thing since you get all this right off the bat.The thing about this movie is it just seems underwhelming I guess is the way to explain it because you really want to like it. I enjoyed the games and I have always like Mark Wahlberg and I liked the director's work on films like ""Behind Enemy Lines"" so I really wanted to love this film. The thing is it just doesn't feel right and as far as video game adaptations go I would say this is not in the top ten. But on the positive side the film looks wonderful and the effects are great, I like that they kept the slow motion style shootouts like on the game. Also the look of the film is great because I have always liked those dark looking films with snow, don't know why but it just looks cool. Speaking of which the shot were Max kills the dude on top of the building is excellent because they actually show the snow on top of the gun, and when he follows the gun once again it just looks cool.Director John Moore just seems like he didn't get the game and didn't know how to properly translate that style to the screen, other than the slow motion stuff of course. The direction in this film seemed uneven and the film just moves along with that style. Writer Beau Thorne is also up for blame with the uneven feel because the script was obviously lacking in certain departments. The thing that really ways his script down is that you see every thing coming, does that make sense? But to be fair to both of them this is far from the worst movie ever made and is not even the worst video game movie ever. Also depending on if you like it or not there is a lot of style in this film, it looks smooth as ever.As far as the acting it is ok I guess seeing that they didn't have much to work with so maybe they could have done much better with different material. Mark Wahlberg is good as the lead as one would expect but I always thought the character would be played by a much more rough looking guy kinda like what they did with ""Punisher: War Zone"". Mila Kunis is actually pretty entertaining in this film but she is not used enough. Beau Bridges is ok in this but his character just need to be more evil if you know what I mean, even though you see it coming you would expect more from that character. Nelly Furtado makes her film debut with this film as Bridges wife, she does a good job with her small role. Speaking of musicians' rapper Ludacris is ok in this, Amaury Nolasco is good as a crime boss and Chris O'Donnell is good in this as well.This movie is not as bad as it sounds because it is entertaining enough for a rental at least. Who knows you may like this movie so I recommend every at least see the movie, either on TV or rent it or whatever. Like I said before this is not the worst movie ever just don't expect much from this film. And for all the action nuts out there this does have a decent amount of action but not as much as you would think.",3,AN OK FILM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,4195,"['MAX', 'PAYNEIt', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'game', 'are', 'usually', 'poorly', 'received', '[', 'usually', 'good', 'reason', ']', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'movies', 'hopes', 'fans', 'game', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'see', 'movie', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'concept', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'movies', 'including', 'one', 'Now', 'film', 'far', 'classic', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'great', 'good', 'tend', 'turn', 'old', 'brain', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'like', 'be', 'entertained', 'same', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'like', 'everything', 'movie', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'great', 'just', 'up', 'ok.The', 'story', 'Max', 'Payne', 'man', 'mission', 'mission', 'finding', 'person', 'who', 'killed', 'wife', 'already', 'got', 'Max', 'way', 'city', 'suburbs', 'even', 'ice', 'filled', 'water', 'hopes', 'catching', 'guy', 'be', 'fair', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', 'place', 'choice', 'are', 'demons', 'running', 'around', 'killing', 'people', 'maybe', 'just', 'drug', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'really', 'am', 'not', 'ruining', 'anything', 'here', 'one', 'clue', 'girl', 'helping', 'way', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'wanted', 'dead', 'Also', 'cop', 'two', 'side', 'so', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'ruining', 'thing', 'get', 'right', 'bat.The', 'thing', 'movie', 'just', 'underwhelming', 'guess', 'way', 'explain', 'really', 'want', 'like', 'enjoyed', 'games', 'have', 'always', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'liked', 'director', 'work', 'films', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'so', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'film', 'thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'as', 'far', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'go', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'top', 'ten', 'positive', 'side', 'film', 'wonderful', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'like', 'kept', 'slow', 'motion', 'style', 'shootouts', 'game', 'Also', 'look', 'film', 'great', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'dark', 'looking', 'films', 'snow', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'just', 'cool', 'Speaking', 'shot', 'were', 'Max', 'dude', 'top', 'building', 'excellent', 'actually', 'show', 'snow', 'top', 'gun', 'when', 'gun', 'once', 'again', 'just', 'cool.Director', 'John', 'Moore', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'properly', 'translate', 'style', 'screen', 'other', 'slow', 'motion', 'stuff', 'course', 'direction', 'film', 'seemed', 'uneven', 'film', 'just', 'moves', 'along', 'style', 'Writer', 'Beau', 'Thorne', 'also', 'up', 'blame', 'uneven', 'feel', 'script', 'was', 'obviously', 'lacking', 'certain', 'departments', 'thing', 'really', 'ways', 'script', 'down', 'see', 'thing', 'coming', 'make', 'sense', 'be', 'fair', 'far', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'even', 'worst', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'ever', 'Also', 'depending', 'like', 'not', 'lot', 'style', 'film', 'ever.As', 'far', 'acting', 'ok', 'guess', 'seeing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'so', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'different', 'material', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'good', 'lead', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'always', 'thought', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'played', 'much', 'more', 'rough', 'looking', 'guy', 'kinda', 'what', 'did', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'actually', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'used', 'enough', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'ok', 'character', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'evil', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'even', 'see', 'coming', 'would', 'expect', 'more', 'character', 'Nelly', 'Furtado', 'film', 'debut', 'film', 'Bridges', 'wife', 'good', 'job', 'small', 'role', 'Speaking', 'musicians', 'rapper', 'Ludacris', 'ok', 'Amaury', 'Nolasco', 'good', 'crime', 'boss', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'good', 'well.This', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'rental', 'least', 'Who', 'may', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'recommend', 'least', 'see', 'movie', 'either', 'TV', 'rent', 'said', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'film', 'action', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'decent', 'amount', 'action', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'think']",N/A

Wahlberg's film choices in '08 have not been what you'd call career friendly. Firstly, M. Night Shamalamadingdong screwed the pooch with THE HAPPENING, and then there's this skunker. I haven't ever played the MAX PAYNE video game, and, truth is, this cinematic adaptation is just the kind of thing which might put off potential players of the game. MAX PAYNE the movie is so @$#%! bad that I'm compelled to inject punctuation marks to emphasize how truly bad it is.Wahlberg over the years has built up a rep for good acting; dude was even recently Oscar-nominated for his role in THE DEPARTED. He's not the worse thing in MAX PAYNE, but it sure doesn't help that he sleepwalks thru his role. Mostly, he rolls with one expression, which is this frozen, sorta pained look, as if his co-actors were always breaking wind around him. Wahlberg is NYPD Detective Max Payne, currently toiling away in the lowly Cold Case Department, pretty much relegated to ""glorified file clerk"" duties. Echoing the back story of the Punisher, the Crow and others of that dark ilk, Max's wife and baby had been murdered and Max won't rest until he gets his ungodly smite on. But the trail is cold, the clues are faint. Max has withdrawn into himself and has alienated pretty much everyone around him, including his one-time cop partner, who Max thinks hasn't done enough in solving the case.Some headway is finally made when a connection is unearthed between the murder of Max's family and the recent slaying of a slinky party girl whom Max had the night before taken home. And when Max's partner is brutally whacked, Max himself becomes the primary suspect. Vaguely teaming up with Mona Sax (Mila Kunis), a Russian assassin and the vengeful sister of the slain girl, Max haunts New York's criminal underworld, tangling with fellow badges, a shady pharmaceutical corporation, and homocidal drugged-out thugsters. But what gets me is that, the whole time, Wahlberg carries that same vaguely distressed expression. What, did the film's catering make it Burrito Night every night?The SIN CITY-inspired visuals look good, no doubt, and there are even several flashy bullet time sequences. But, in a way, that cheeses me ever more, because, seems to me, if the filmmakers can pay so much attention on the special effects and the slick cinematography, why couldn't they focus just a smidgen on the story, which is always the most crucial component? As it is, MAX PAYNE dies a slow, agonizing death, the final verdict rendering it a thing of style over substance, some lipstick on a pig, moonlight on a pile of poo.All the way thru, the film persists in its bad choices. The pace is sluggish, the script is all over the place, and characters walk on and off the screen like you're supposed to already know who they are (and I guess you would if you've played the game). But, for too much time, I wasn't clear on exactly who that cat was being played by a doughy-looking Chris McDonnell (who I guess wreaked havoc on Burrito Nights). The camera several times makes it a point to briefly cut to McDonnell's nervous mug, but until his big office scene, not much detail is provided regarding this guy, leaving me vexed and musing who the hell is this doofus? And what was the deal with the old woman who happens to be CEO of that dubious pharmaceutical company? Just how deep was she into shady shenanigans? The film leaves us in the dark. It's stuff like that, which smacks of lack of attention to detail, which helps to torpedo the film.Mila Kunis simply feels out of place. Worsely, she isn't given much to do, other than occasionally spit some Russian dialogue and saunter with flair in her leathers and big, big gun. Olga Kurylenko, the latest Bond girl, shows up for a nanosecond, but then I think her agent called with some pointed career advice. Hip hop artist Ludacris shows up and tries to sink into his role and get serious about acting, except that when your character's name is Lt. J. Bravura, who're you really foolin'? Beau Bridges is also here, probably having told his little brother ""Whatever you can do, blah blah blah."" But he's got nothing on Jeff.The trailers cheated us into thinking that there actually may be an otherworldy element to this thing, in the form of creepy shadow angels skittering about. Except that they turn out to be mere side-effects of this experimental hallucinatory drug, which by the way happens to be at the crux of this whole mess. There's a dispirited, soul-numbing tone in MAX PAYNE which wore on me and put me in a bleak mood (I was this close to putting on black clothes and a beret, changing my name to Olaf, and composing poetry that neither rhymed nor made sense). For folks who relish wallowing in that sort of emotional scene, stick around until after the credits for one last scene which, O Unfathomable God, may be setting up for a possible sequel.The DVD offers two versions of the film, the theatrical version and the unrated version. If you're wondering which one to see, hint: the theatrical version is SHORTER. To be fair, the last half hour does pick up the pace as the filmmakers finally shake themselves out of their stupor and realize that, hey, this is supposed to be an action thriller. So, that's something. But, for Mark Wahlberg's sake, THE BRAZILIAN JOB can't come fast enough.Oh, and if you're gonna handcuff someone, clap them suckers on with their hands behind the back.

The supporting caste iss good. The main problems of the movie are the pacing and the plot holes. The movie is not logically consistent in its own universe. Everybody has the same hallucinations on the drug. Beau Bridges's character confesses to killing Payne's wife; however, we see the killer scamper through a bedroom window through flashbacks. I don't think Beau could ever move that fast.Some scenes in the movie are really cool. When Max takes the drug, the snowflakes turn into flaming cinders.

1217586,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001MTYRJS,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 2]","Video game film adaptations always seem to be hit-and-miss with both their quality and audience approval. For every successful entry into the genre (""Resident Evil"" or ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") there is an equally unsuccessful one to counter it (""Doom"" or ""Alone in the Dark""). Continuing on in the tradition of the less than stellar entries we have Mark Wahlberg's latest actioner, the disjointed revenge thriller ""Max Payne"" based upon the popular video game series of the same name.""Max Payne"" follows the revenge-laden path of the titular character (Mark Wahlberg), as he is embarking on a quest to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of his family. The further Max goes to solve the crime, the more twisted the answers he finds become, and what he discovers may just push him to the very brink.As a fan of the two video games centering on the character's rather violent exploits, ""Max Payne"" and ""Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne"", I was leery of how accurate the film adaptation would be to the source material. When I found out that Mark Wahlberg (""Four Brothers"") would be portraying Max, I gained a little more faith in the production, because Mark had said he wouldn't have done it if the story didn't have enough substance to sustain his interest; thus allowing myself to become cautiously optimistic about the end product. However, upon its release reviews of the film were less than stellar, not exactly a surprise given the type of film; but despite the criticism the movie went on to produce some decent box office numbers, leading one to wonder if perhaps the movie may be better than expected. Having now seen ""Max Payne"" for myself, I believe that even though it is fairly faithful to the first video game especially, the movie is such a jumbled mess that I find it hard to believe that anyone could really enjoy it.For starters, the story is obviously attempting to be a semi-complicated mystery/whodunit, yet the actual screenplay is far too simplistic to appropriately service this style of movie. The film would have been much better served by a screenplay that devoted the proper amount of time and effort into developing the mystery rather than teasing the viewer with snippets before heading off into the next overblown action sequence. Typically in mystery movies there is always a twist somewhere along the way, generally involving a character whose motives you thought you knew, but it turned out you couldn't have been more wrong about. Just as I suspected would be the case, ""Max Payne"" did its best to incorporate one such twist; however, the under-developed storyline caused the twist to be easily deduced way before it ever occurs, completely removing any kind of suspense or anticipation from the equation.Another problem with the story is the sense that many key scenes are missing from the final film, due to characters seemingly popping up out of nowhere; yet somehow aware of what all has transpired and ready for action on whoever's side they've chosen. I know that sometimes in a film the viewer is to assume certain characters have had some sort of dialogue off-screen that filled in some gaps, this is usually mentioned in passing within a scene to give the viewer a clue that this has occurred. However, in this film no such clue is given, and this assumption has to be made far too often; to the point that it quickly leads one to presume that the script, as written by first time screenwriter Beau Thorne, was so paper-thin, that no thought was ever put into actually bridging the gaps in the story or fleshing out any of the characters' relationships along the way.Action director John Moore (""Behind Enemy Lines"") brings a stylistic flair in the vein of ""Sin City"" or ""The Spirit"" to the film, utilizing a lot of neutral colors with splashes of bright reds and other colors here and there to accentuate the action. I did appreciate that John took a few moments within the film to incorporate the bullet-time effect into some of the action. Even though this effect has been massively over-used ever since ""The Matrix"" made it popular, it is a staple within the video game, so as a gamer I was glad to see its inclusion. The problem with the bullet-time effect is that when it is initially employed in the film, the context doesn't really make a whole lot of logical sense (much like the rest of the movie), and the effect while appreciated feels wasted in the end.Speaking of the director, I do feel it is only fair to dump some of the story's faults onto him as well, since he would have had some say in the final cut of the movie. Perhaps, next time he should think about elaborating on some plot points instead of glossing over them to move onto the next action scene. I will say that John and/or the editor of ""Max Payne"" was wise enough to keep the momentum of the film moving along quickly, so as to not allow the audience a whole lot of time to realize just how weak the storyline truly was, until after they've finished watching it.Mark Wahlberg was a good choice to portray the tortured soul of Max Payne. Although criticized for a lack of emotional range in the role, I felt Wahlberg played the character the exact way as he is portrayed in the video game. Plus, when a person's family is completely wiped out, I don't see that same person being all smiles too often; no, I believe he or she would probably be a pretty depressing person to be around. As a testament to Mark Wahlberg's performance, even though he is fairly one-note emotionally throughout the course of the movie (there are a few instances of happiness from Max sprinkled about), he still is able to keep the viewer entertained, despite a meager script.Supporting cast members are mostly comprised of cameo appearances within the movie, which harkens back to my complaint that characters just pop-in at random and are gone just as quickly as they appeared. A few of the cameo and/or supporting characters were played by Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges (""Crash"") as a member of Internal Affairs investigating Max, Chris O'Donnell (""Batman & Robin"") as a former co-worker of Max's late wife, and Olga Kurylenko (""007: Quantum of Solace"") as a woman who may be linked to what led to the murder of Max's family. Truthfully, the only real supporting cast members that had more than five to ten minutes of screen time were Mila Kunis (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") as an assassin that assists Max occasionally while trying to find her sister's killer, and Beau Bridges (TV's ""Stargate: Atlantis"") as a former cop and confidant of Max. Beau seems to get the lion's share of the screen time out of all the supporting characters, and he does a good job with the stock character he is given to play; but his part in the overall scheme of things is so easily deduced that he seems wasted in the role.Heavy on the violence, yet light on the story, ""Max Payne"" is one video game adaptation that knows how to bring the action of the source material to life on the big screen; but fails to deliver a story that even begins to resemble that of a good movie, let alone a decent video game. If you are a fan of the video games then you may enjoy ""Max Payne"", but my guess is that you'll wish you would have just spent the two hours playing through the story rather than simply watching it.""Max Payne"" is available in rated R and unrated editions both contain violence, language, and sexuality.",2,"Plenty of Violence, Not So Much Story...",1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,7406,"['Video',

I have never played the game but that shouldn't be the reason why it was unclear what the heck was going on. Mark Wahlberg played Max Payne so passionlessly that it ached to watch, he was flat and lifeless. I understand that in the film he went through trauma since his wife and kid were killed but did it kill his acting too? He wasn't the tough guy he was portraying, he was a zombie, not to mention the lame casting; Nelly Furtado ( short part but still) and Ludacris? Really, are there no actors left to do their craft? Mila Kunis got her twitchy eyes fixed but still looked like a pug in makeup, not to mention Olga Kurylenko who played Mona Sax's sister, literally wearing the same nightie she wore as a dress in her other movie ""Hitman"" I was appalled that she had to play the exact same character, her outfit and makeup was exact, and of course she had to act like a monkey in heat, once was enough but to see her do it twice in two movies where it was almost identical was maddening, grrrr!At first the story was intriguing, the secret that seemed to bind people and then cause them death looked cool, not to mention they all had wing tattoos on their wrists; the wing of a Valkyrie, the Norse mythological deity that took those who died a violent death to heavens....Pretty soon we get to see dark winged creatures ripping people to shreds, later we find out that perhaps its all a hallucination, well at the end I didn't know what it was and I watched the whole movie. The mystery sucks if all the ends are loose and the secret isn't so shocking, some parts were obvious and some weren't even surprising, just a poor choice of conclusion and overall I thought the movie had nothing to say, even the ending was hollow and unimpressive.

That much was entertaining at least.I didn't mind that the plot was full of holes (after all, the movie is based on a video game so I wasn't expecting anything profound there),but unfortunately, the worst thing about the movie is that Wahlberg, who is certainly a talented actor and who I like, just doesn't seem that involved in the role. His whole performance is somewhat wooden, and from his past roles he's certainly capable of better. He's also a quite competent martial artist and quite athletic, reminding me of Lawrence Olivier when he was young, who used to do all his own stunts, when he broke a lot of bones. My generation only remembers Olivier from his senior years' roles as an old man such as in ""The Jazz Singer,"" and most don't know how physical he was when he was younger.Anyway, I ramble on. I give this movie three stars for all the great action sequences, and also the cinematography is actually excellent, and in many ways quite beautiful and aesthetic in many scenes, so I want to give whoever was in charge of the camera his due.

Three deaths later, Max has no better clues with the exception of a new drug the three were taking.Going back to the snitch who gave him the info, Max meets a young woman as well as her over protective sister named Mona (Mila Kunis) who has a way with weapons. When the woman is found torn to shreds the next day, Max' old partner Alex (Donal Logue) brings him to the scene. Clues are found and the two go off in their own directions to find the link between this death and that of Max' wife and child.A phone call from Alex leads Max to an apartment where he finds Alex, dead, and the attackers on their way out. Action ensues but they escape, leaving Max with more clues and no answers. It also leaves a police department that favors the loss of Alex negatively and blames Max.At first attacked by Mona who thinks he may have killed her sister, the two join forces to find out just who is behind these deaths. Items that lead Max to an undercover test of select drugs at the pharmaceutical company that his wife worked for result in his confrontation with a group of test subjects who feel empowered by the drug. They view themselves as indestructible and have been killing all along. Now it's up to Max to take them down of die. If he survives, he must still search to find out who is responsible for the drugs to begin with.Anyone who has seen the preview for this film has seen some dynamite images. A chase scene in an office resulting in a shower of bullet riddled glass, Max sinking to the bottom of the ocean and several scary looking winged creatures that seem to attack victims left and right are wonderful to look at but offer nothing. Sure, these do offer some great things to look at, but the plot meanders and takes far too long to make sense. And what these images are is something better left as a surprise for those who haven't seen the film. Let's just say that you watch wondering if anything you are looking at is real or hallucination.Wahlberg has taken hits recently for his bland style of acting, rarely offering emotion in select films. This movie doesn't help. And sadly enough, he does have the potential to be a much bigger star. He has turned in more dynamic performances. But this isn't one of them.I went back and tried to watch this once more. It did get better with the second viewing and I might get the urge to watch it again just for the photography and images described above.

The film is a ok film noir movie and it does have elements from the video game without being like a video game ; the recent ""wanted"" is more like one than this movie. THat would be fine except they rely on the corrupt betrayer  who canbe seen from very early on. This traitor/betrayer theme has made many hollywood movies fall into a cynical trap, sure these betrayals happen but unfortunately they can't seem to make decent villians who are NOTpart of the team, force or a friend like they used to. THis ruined the Mission Impossible movies which failed to even feature a team in any of them! Just traitors and inside badies. The actors all do a decent job at their average type action noir roles,especially the underrated Beau Bridges.  This isn't a bad movie though and the drug that enslaves peopleis all too close to the reality of meth (also known of the streets as the drug on fools.)  It's worth watching on blu ray and if you are into film noir and don't care about the video game aspect.  This does feature people flying when hit by shotgun blasts which does not happen in reality however.  And that is videogamish to say the least but It doesn't do the game justice in many respects.

The trailers showed all the best parts and cut it in such a way that it looked better than it actually did in the movie. Mark Wahlberg is an actor of limited range and it really shows here. I won't just blame him because the entire cast is wasted with limited screen time or very bad dialogue. The gorgeous Mila Kunis shined in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but here she barely says or does anything. Don't even get me started on how much is lacking in the story department or why a movie based on a video game filled with action has next to none until nearly the end.This DVD version may be Unrated, but there didn't seem to be anything they couldn't have shown in the PG-13 theatrical version.

I just watch them because my fiance wants to.  That being said, I do occasionally enjoy them.  However, with Max Payne while it was very very pretty, there was no substance whatsoever to the film.  It seems like they spent an inordinate amount of time on making the film visually pleasing and then realized that they had to have some kind of story in it.Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is an antisocial cop working a quiet desk job on cold cases.  That is until he gets a lead on someone who might have been responsible for killing his wife and child.  You see, Max isn't any ordinary guy, he's a shoot'um up vigilante our for personal justice.  The new lead brings him to several people who keep dying, and all have a strange tattoo of a wing.  If this wasn't surprising enough, we (although not Max) see winged creatures flying about and hurting people.  Very supernatural.As Max tracks down the killers he comes across several suprising leads and even experiences betrayal.  With the help of a few people like his ex-partner (Donal Logue) and Mona Sax a Russian killer (Mila Kunis) he sets off to discover more information on the murders.  Lots of shooting ensues and Max becomes dead set on killing the people responsible for his wife's murder.  In doing so, he will try to bring down a whole corporation and its security as well.  The only trouble is that they're out to kill him too.Wahlberg as Max was very flat.  There was no emotion to his acting and you couldn't really feel the connection or that he was hurting because of his wife's death.  It was more that he was a robot doing a ""terminator-style"" killing of many many people.  Not to mention, that as a cop, there is no way that he would have gotten away with what he did against all odds.  Kunis as Sax was interesting.  Having only seen her in cheery roles I kind of liked her as a tough girl.  In fact, she had the most personality out of anyone in the film.  Although they weren't really characters I should talked about the ""winged-things"".  At first (having never played the video game) I thought these were part of the world and it was a supernatural world.  Was I ever wrong; the creatures while not part of the world don't have their existence explained until about half-way into the movie.  It was odd.The music was ok.  Nothing memorable.  What really stood out in this movie was the special effects.  They did a great job on the special effects and were especially clever with their use of snow and different ways of shooting the scenes.  The battle scenes were also very intricately done.  In fact, the special effects are the only reason I gave his movie two stars instead of one.Overall this movie went for flash instead of substance.  And that's sad because it could have easily had both.  It seems the makers took the easy way out and just appealed to people's like of special effects and violence but didn't consider their want of a storyline as well.  Only watch if you don't care about a plotline.Review by M.

Despite the fact that with the possible exception of the TOMB RAIDER films all video game adaptations for the big screen have been miserable failures, I thought (or maybe just hoped) that they would get it right this time and make a movie that captured the quality of the Max Payne game series. The video game Max Payne is so well done: spot on voice acting, great Film Noir atmosphere, good writing, an intriguing protagonist, the list goes on and on. What could they possibly do to ruin the movie? All they needed to do was navigate the game's storyline, use the same characters, maybe even employ the same writers, and the result would be a pretty darn good movie.To sum up the rest of this review: they failed horribly and created a move that is a sad, sad parody of the infinitely superior games.Mark Wahlberg is a pretty good actor, and I was happy when I heard he had been cast as Max. He seemed a good fit for the part, and while I expected he might not plumb the depths of Max's character, I did think that he would be believable when delivering a good beat-down or using his signature dual pistols. Unfortunately, he looks bored in the film, and it leaves me wondering if his agent signed him up before explaining just what kind of movie this was going to be. Once he read the script, he just gave up. The Wahlberg from THE DEPARTED is completely missing from this film. However, it's not really his fault this movie is a flop.The responsibility for that rests on the shoulders of the writers and the director. The dialogue is atrocious. From over bearing to just plain silly, the whole thing sounds like two thirteen-year-olds play acting. Lines like ""You have to finish this,"" are strewn throughout. Every time Max doesn't know what to do, some ominously worded phrase will send him off in another violent fit of ""finding the answers.""The plot (if you can call it that) is a strange amalgamation of the original (they kept the drug Valkre, the brutal murder of Max' family, and some of the characters) and new elements that feel pieced together.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 6]","A big-screen take on Max Payne had been in the works for some time, and now that it has finally come to fruition, we should all be wishing that it never did in the first place.  Mark Wahlberg plays the title character; a down and out cop who hasn't been the same since the deaths of his wife and child.  Could a strange drug that's hit the streets have something to do with it, as well as far ranging conspiracy involving an evil company?  You bet!  What made the Max Payne video game so good was its noir-ish undertones, graphic novel-esque presentation, and blood-pumping moments of action.  The Max Payne movie has little to none of the aforementioned, and instead settles for some atrocious acting, terrible dialogue, watered down action, a confusing story, and an overabundance of CGI-animated winged creatures that end up not amounting to much of anything to do with what's going on; and the end result is a film that bears little to no resemblance to the video game other than the uses of character names.  Wahlberg is just awful as Max Payne, which is what's probably the most disappointing.  The man can act, just watch The Departed, Invincible, or Boogie Nights, but you'd never know that it's the same guy here.  The rest of the cast, including Beau Bridges, Chris O'Donnell, Ludacris, Bond girl Olga Kurylenko, Donal Logue, The Wire's Jamie Hector, and a mis-cast Mila Kunis as Mona Sax; are either equally bad or just plain wasted in their roles.  The sad part is that this flick had potential to be one of those ever so few good video game adaptations, but alas, this is what we get.  All in all, no matter how much of a fan you may be of the video game, the Max Payne movie is not only massively disappointing, but is a just plain awful flick that isn't worthy of your time or attention.",1,Ungodly awful,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1802,"['big-screen', 'take', 'Max', 'Payne', 'had', 'been', 'works', 'time', 'now', 'finally', 'come', 'fruition', 'should', 'be', 'wishing', 'never', 'did', 'first', 'place', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'title', 'character', 'down', 'cop', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'same', 'deaths', 'wife', 'child', 'Could', 'strange', 'drug', 'streets', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'far', 'ranging', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'evil', 'company', 'bet', 'What', 'made', 'Max', 'Payne', 'video', 'game', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'noir-ish', 'undertones', 'graphic', 'novel-esque', 'presentation', 'blood-pumping', 'moments', 'action', 'Max', 'Payne', 'movie', 'little', 'none', 'aforementioned', 'instead', 'settles', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'watered', 'action', 'confusing', 'story', 'overabundance', 'CGI-animated', 'winged', 'creatures', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'amounting', 'much', 'anything', 'do', 'what', 'going', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'little', 'resemblance', 'video', 'game', 'other', 'uses', 'character', 'names', 'Wahlberg', 'just', 'awful', 'Max', 'Payne', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'disappointing', 'man', 'can', 'act', 'just', 'watch', 'Departed', 'Invincible', 'Boogie', 'Nights', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'same', 'guy', 'here', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Ludacris', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'Wire', 'Jamie', 'Hector', 'mis-cast', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Mona', 'Sax', 'are', 'equally', 'bad', 'just', 'plain', 'wasted', 'roles', 'sad', 'part', 'flick', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'one', 'ever', 'so', 'few', 'good', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'alas', 'what', 'get', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'fan', 'may', 'be', 'video', 'game', 'Max', 'Payne', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'massively', 'disappointing', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'flick', ""n't"", 'worthy', 'time', 'attention']",N/A

These range from Academy-award winning dramas such as The English Patient to horror flicks like the Resident Evil franchise to this low-performing comic-book film with a very good cast of actors and actresses.  The other backdrop is greed, or a cover-up of some nasty side effects.  Both are present in this film's plot, along with some plot twists, good dialogue, and great cinematography.  All of this is ruined however by numerous action scenes that are just plain stupid, sequences that belong more in a dumbed-down action film like Rambo than in a modern comic-book film.  For example, when Detective Payne is about to escort his star witness out of his corporate office, private security arrives with machine guns.  All hell breaks loose as the mini-army open fire.  Yet Mr. Payne escapes with nary a scratch nor a bead of sweat on his forehead.  Hmmm.  Another outlandish sequence occurs near the film's climax when Detective Payne is about to be killed by a drugged-up killer.  Well, one bullet to the chest saves our hero.  Later on, said hero doses himself with the same drugs and probably takes a dozen bullets to the torso, yet still keeps on going!  Hmmm.

It seems that the production team just scrapped a summary of the video game series and the characters and used it to form the movie. The plot is jumbled up and doesn't make sense, and when the acting is completely sub-par, it just makes things worse. Mark Wahlberg comes off as one-dimensional throughout the film, seeming like he just wanted to walk through this and get it over with. I wouldn't blame him if that's true, because I just wanted this to finally end once and for all. The action is minimal; there are more flashbacks and hallucinations. When there is action, it just mindlessly spoofs The Matrix (when Wahlberg shoots backwards at his enemy).Wahlberg himself said that he had no intention to play the games; he would have been surprised to see how different the movie is to the games.

Parrish,"[0, 0]","The trouble with these movies taken from video games is that they don't really connect with their intended audience until they kick into game mode.  In the case of this film that happens way way down the road from the opening scene, thus losing the audience two-fold in its wake.  I mean the audience who bought into Wahlberg's portrayal and actually feel for his character balk when the Matrix sfx-s kick in and the story spirals to it's gamey conclusion and the gamers have already died of boredom by the time the action shifts into high-gear.  Kudos to Mila Kunis (Jackie from That Seventies Show) who'll blow you away as a semi-villianess and Beau Bridges playing his part with his usual sense of subtlety.  Mr. Wahlberg is to be commended for playing it straight and to the point.  You actually feel his pain from time to time.  I still stand by my original assessment of him as the NEW Charles Bronson the movie everyman star from the fifties onward.  The print is pristine if darkly lit and the use of shadows is noirish.  The sound is a bit muddled and I do believe it was intentional, go figure.  But in the end the movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a real drama or a set-up for the next game.

1217623,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001MTYRJS,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","I never expected MAX PAYNE to be particularly good.  The video game was pure, first-person shoot-`em-up excitement, with the usual negligible plot, but with great locations, a cool, snowblown look and lots of things to shoot at.  So while I didn't expect great things from a movie based on such flimsy material...I at least expected some ACTION!!For much of the movie, though, PAYNE is paced like a methodical police procedural with occasional very brief bursts of action.  By the time the climactic scenes arrive, which DO have a fair amount of action, I had long since stopped caring.  I believe I had set my expectations properly:  turn off the brain, but get ready for an adrenaline rush.  What I got mostly was boredom, so when the action came...my adrenal gland was asleep.  Not that the action was anything but pedestrian at that.MAX PAYNE, the video game, is essentially the story of one cop's ruthless quest for vengeance for the death of his wife and baby.  He was a good cop whose happy life was shattered by a crime cartel so sinister and connected that no LEGAL system would ever bring those responsible to justice.  So he arms himself and essentially starts killing people left and right until he gets to those who REALLY deserve to be punished.  The settings are various dark locations throughout a very snowy city, and the game looked terrific.  It was DOOM with a smidgen of humanity.  DUKE NUKEM with more hard-boiled, angry humor.The movie gets many of the settings right, particularly the snow.  That actually looked good.  The effects, in general, were well-executed for a film with an obviously lower budget than your run-of-the-mill INDIANA JONES flick.But while in a video game it's okay to have the main character (you) killing everything in sight...how could we, in a movie, sympathize with a man so maddened by vengeance that he kills pretty much everyone he sees. We couldn't, so the filmmakers keep Max from being murderous (until the end, when the whole evil plot is revealed).  This is more ""realistic"" but also pretty dull.  Mark Wahlberg plays Max as a guy who has pretty much just stopped living.  He works the worst deskjob possible, and seems to have no personality left.  When he gets some clues, finally, about what happened to his wife, he goes into action...which seems to consist mostly of moping his way through some seedy scenery and asking half-hearted questions.  Wahlberg CAN be an engaging screen presence, but he does himself NO favors by taking on roles like this or SHOOTER.  He doesn't have the charisma to coast through a part.  He needs to be fully engaged as an actor (THE DEPARTED or THREE KINGS, for example) and he is successful.Max is joined in his quest by Mila Kunis (That `70s Show, FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL), and it's passingly amusing to see an actress mostly known for sweet spunkiness to wear leather and carry a shotgun.  It's a nothing role, but it helps her break her stereotype a little.  Olga Kurylenko turns up in another video-game inspired movie (HITMAN), but isn't in too many scenes...a good thing, her range is extremely limited!  Beau Bridges is a welcome presence, and Chris O'Donnell is NOT, in a very small role that he still manages to do less than nothing with.  Finally, the always welcome Donal Logue shows up for about 10 minutes.  I'd like to see  HIM take on a role like Max Payne.  He'd breathe some life into it!In no way is this a good movie, nor would any reasonable person expect it to be.  But it doesn't even merit a label like ""trashy fun.""  I guess I'll just have to watch SHOOT `EM UP again for that.  Or maybe I can dust off my old copy of MAX PAYNE the video game, and really have some fun!",2,I had low expectations and was STILL disappointed.,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,3690,"['never', 'expected', 'MAX', 'PAYNE', 'be', 'particularly', 'good', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'pure', 'first-person', 'shoot-', 'em-up', 'excitement', 'usual', 'negligible', 'plot', 'great', 'locations', 'cool', 'snowblown', 'look', 'lots', 'things', 'shoot', 'So', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'based', 'such', 'flimsy', 'material', 'least', 'expected', 'ACTION', 'much', 'movie', 'though', 'PAYNE', 'paced', 'methodical', 'police', 'procedural', 'occasional', 'very', 'brief', 'bursts', 'action', 'time', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'arrive', 'DO', 'have', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'had', 'long', 'stopped', 'caring', 'believe', 'had', 'set', 'expectations', 'properly', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'get', 'ready', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'What', 'got', 'mostly', 'was', 'boredom', 'so', 'when', 'action', 'came', 'adrenal', 'gland', 'was', 'asleep', 'Not', 'action', 'was', 'anything', 'pedestrian', 'that.MAX', 'PAYNE', 'video', 'game', 'essentially', 'story', 'one', 'cop', 'ruthless', 'quest', 'vengeance', 'death', 'wife', 'baby', 'was', 'good', 'cop', 'happy', 'life', 'was', 'shattered', 'crime', 'cartel', 'so', 'sinister', 'connected', 'LEGAL', 'system', 'would', 'ever', 'bring', 'responsible', 'justice', 'essentially', 'killing', 'people', 'left', 'right', 'who', 'REALLY', 'deserve', 'be', 'punished', 'settings', 'are', 'various', 'dark', 'locations', 'very', 'snowy', 'city', 'game', 'looked', 'terrific', 'was', 'DOOM', 'smidgen', 'humanity', 'DUKE', 'NUKEM', 'more', 'hard-boiled', 'angry', 'humor.The', 'movie', 'many', 'settings', 'right', 'particularly', 'snow', 'actually', 'looked', 'good', 'effects', 'general', 'were', 'well-executed', 'film', 'obviously', 'lower', 'budget', 'run-of-the-mill', 'INDIANA', 'JONES', 'flick.But', 'video', 'game', 'okay', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'killing', 'everything', 'sight', 'how', 'could', 'movie', 'sympathize', 'man', 'so', 'maddened', 'vengeance', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'could', ""n't"", 'filmmakers', 'keep', 'Max', 'being', 'murderous', 'end', 'when', 'whole', 'evil', 'plot', 'revealed', 'more', 'realistic', 'also', 'pretty', 'dull', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Max', 'guy', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'stopped', 'living', 'worst', 'deskjob', 'possible', 'have', 'personality', 'left', 'When', 'clues', 'finally', 'what', 'happened', 'wife', 'action', 'consist', 'mostly', 'moping', 'way', 'seedy', 'scenery', 'asking', 'half-hearted', 'questions', 'Wahlberg', 'CAN', 'be', 'engaging', 'screen', 'presence', 'NO', 'favors', 'taking', 'roles', 'SHOOTER', ""n't"", 'have', 'charisma', 'coast', 'part', 'be', 'fully', 'engaged', 'actor', 'THE', 'DEPARTED', 'THREE', 'KINGS', 'example', 'successful.Max', 'joined', 'quest', 'Mila', 'Kunis', '70s', 'Show', 'FORGETTING', 'SARAH', 'MARSHALL', 'passingly', 'amusing', 'see', 'actress', 'mostly', 'known', 'sweet', 'spunkiness', 'wear', 'leather', 'carry', 'shotgun', 'nothing', 'role', 'break', 'stereotype', 'little', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'up', 'video-game', 'inspired', 'movie', 'HITMAN', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'good', 'thing', 'range', 'extremely', 'limited', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'welcome', 'presence', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'NOT', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'still', 'do', 'less', 'nothing', 'Finally', 'always', 'welcome', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'up', 'about', '10', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'HIM', 'take', 'role', 'Max', 'Payne', ""'d"", 'breathe', 'life', 'way', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'reasonable', 'person', 'expect', 'be', ""n't"", 'even', 'merit', 'label', 'trashy', 'fun', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'SHOOT', 'EM', 'UP', 'again', 'maybe', 'can', 'dust', 'off', 'old', 'copy', 'MAX', 'PAYNE', 'video', 'game', 'really', 'have', 'fun']",N/A
1217624,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B001MTYRJS,Robert Badgley,"[0, 6]","The Oct/08 film Max Payne sees yet another in a long line of video game-to-movie releases.However unlike some of its' predecessors this one does not come even close to the excitement,intensity and depth of the game it is based on.The plot is as see through as cellophane and as shallow as a baby's' bath water.The film opens as Max(Mark Wahlberg)is swimming for his life in freezing water and near death.The movie back flashes to a week before and we retrace the steps which led to this moment.We find Max working in a cold case file room at a police station somewhere in NYC.He lost his wife and baby three years before in a brutal murder mystery that he has been trying to solve ever since. Following a hunch he goes to an old snitches' apartment where there is a ""party"" taking place.There he meets Natasha(Olga Kunylenko)who takes a liking to him.Her sister is Mona Sax(Mila Kunis) and she is there with her gang;Russians of whom she is the leader.Mona tries to stop her sister from carrying on but is assuaged by Natasha who leaves with Max.Max takes her back to his apartment but she leaves shortly thereafter when he spurns her advances.On the way back home she is killed.The next day Max's ex partner takes him to the crime scene and reveals his wallet was found near the body.Max explains that she stole it but circumstances don't look good.They part on bad terms but later his old partner phones him with information that might be the key to the mystery of his wifes' death.Max finds him dead at his home,where a struggle ensues and Max blacks out.He wakes up to find an old friend of his father,BB Hensley(Beau Bridges),by his bedside in the hospital.BB is now head of security of the Aesir Corporation;the same company his wife worked for.Max continues his quest and finds some of the evidence his ex partner left behind and it is the tattoos of wings that are on the murder victims which correspond to the wings logo on all Aesir documents.BB fears for Max but can do nothing to stop him.He next interrogates an Aesir employee who finally spills the beans on what happened to his late wife and baby.As he escorts him out his office the witness is killed and Max barely escapes with his life.He takes the evidence to Natasha's sister Mona.It seems the Aesir Corp.has been illegally manufacturing and selling a drug called Valkyr(val-keer)that comes in a small vile.It had been originally designed for military troops but the drugs' terrible side effects forced the company to(officially)withdraw it from production. The company has been using an ex marine,Sgt Jack Lupino,as their pusher,but he has gotten way out of control.Mona tells Max where he can find Lupino which takes him to a local club called Ragnarock.When Max finally confronts Lupino BB ""happens ""upon the scene and saves his life by killing Lupino.We next find Max and BB down by the harbour which BB intends to throw him into with viles of Valkyr on him to make it look like a drug killing.After a short struggle Max gets free but his only option is to jump into the icy cold harbour.This  is where we came in.Max barely makes it out alive and the only thing that saves him from hypothermia are the viles of Valkyr he ingests.He heads straight for the Aesir tower to get BB and ends up cornering him on the roof helio-pad.There he shoots BB dead and the movie ends as the sun comes up on another day.There are many direct and indirect references in the film to the game such as the subway station called Roscoe Street,which the film gets to a ways in.This is where the game itself pretty much starts as Max tells us(in the game)""Death was in the air at Roscoe Street"".Then there is the look of the film which matches the game quite well;the constant snow falling.The Aesir Corp.,is pronounced ""Acer"" in the game but starngely two ways in the film,""Acer"" and ""A-seer"".The final line from the film matches that of the game:""I don't know about heaven,but I believe in angels"".However many of the characters names,ethnicities and importance in plot have been changed around,sometimes more than others.The game sees Max go from one clue to the next which leads to the final battle at Aesir plaza and the taking down of the person responsible for it all;the president of the company a Ms Horne,as he blows up her helicopter as she flees.In the film Ms Horne is more of a shadowy figure who just pulls the strings with the ultimate fight going between Max and his old fathers friend BB;with the helio-pad as just a point of reference.The Russians in the game have far more of a presence but are not headed by Mona.Mona in the game is just a colleague of Max's.Throughout the film we are given the impression that the cops suspect Max himself but they never fire on him.In the game Max is pursued and shot at not only by the bad guys but the NYPD all the way through to the end.Lastly while Jim Bravura in the game is a white stereotypical NYPD cop who appears on TV newcasts and is constantly dogging the heels of Max,in the film they have turned him black and he is now just an ineffectual internal investigator played like a piece of cardboard by rapper Ludicris.The characters and action are all shallow and cartoonish such as when Max gets shot twice and both times there is no further reference to them and he just keeps going.Or when Max,for some reason,heads down an alley and ends up at the end of it walking backwards and getting a gun pointed at his head from around a corner.It is such a bone head move one wishes one had game control of him,because YOU wouldn't have made such a stupid and obvious error.By the way the person who ""surprises"" him is Mona,Nathasha's sister.While in the Aesir building Mona comes out of nowhere to appear and saves Max's life;no rhyme nor reason except to keep Max alive until the end of the picture.I'm usually terrible at figuring out who did it ahead of time but it is not far into the film and you just KNOW that BB is the one behind all the goings on;it is just too obvious.The DVD technically is presented in its original widescreen ratio of 2:35:1 and has been transferred well.Special features are limited with just director and production designer commentary with the trailers;and neither are close captioned.The DVD does include the theatrical and unrated versions but believe me there is a little difference between the two versions that would make one better over the other.I always hope that the film versions of video games will at least try and aspire to come up to a modicum of the games original intents,feel and excitement.While many have,this one doesn't.It is great to see Beau Bridges once again as one doesn't see enough of this good actor,but he got caught in a poke this time which is unfortunate.The film is just too flimsy and shallow for anyone to rise above its' mundane foundation.I would never pay full price for this DVD nor even $5 at the bargain bin at Wal-Mart,it is so poor.I would advise you to pick up the original video game(available on many platforms)and play it yourself for a much more intense,enjoyable and satisfying experience and give THIS Max Payne a pass or you will find yourself having your own Payne-ful experience!",2,A Payne-ful film-the game is FAR better!,1269129600,"03 21,

1217625,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001MTYRJS,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2Based on a popular video game of the same name, ""Max Payne"" is a film noir crime drama with a supernatural twist. Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is a cold-case detective with the NYPD who's understandably obsessed with bringing the culprits who murdered his wife and kid to justice. When Max himself becomes a prime suspect in a series of subsequent killings, he sets off on a dual-purpose crusade: first, to find the actual killer and, second, to clear his own name of all charges. The sole original element in this otherwise thoroughly hackneyed setup comes in the form of a mysterious mythological bird (surprisingly NOT a maltese falcon) that seems to be the connecting thread tying all the murders together.Thanks to imaginative art direction, cinematography and production design, the movie does achieve an impressive and distinctive art deco look - i.e., denuded colors in an abundance of darkly-lit night scenes with snow flakes fluttering unceasingly through the picture. But, on the story level, the movie feels way too derivative of previous detective dramas to generate much interest of its own.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!! SMOKING!!!!!!!!!Now moving on, this movie is otherwise, a 1 star movie. I guess Max Pyane went Hollywood and this is its horrible retelling of the first two games. What the hell did I just see?Spoiler Alert!!!Okay, the video Max Payne story is based on him having his family (wife and child) murder. They never found the killers. Max goes into this deep depression and becomes could inside. He eventually gets a lead that may help him solve his case years later. Then, he is on his way finding out who did it and finding out it was all part of a bigger crime that needs stopping. In the game, you get to use many different kinds of weapons. Also, in the game is a feature that you should use and was almost impossible to win without it is Bullet Time. This is where, Max sees everything in a slow mo fashion and he is seeing enemies moving and shooting where at him. But, you are still moving in almost real time and so you can actually still avoid bullets and damage by using this feature. Max does get hurt in the game and can't take too much damage or he will die. So, what he needs to do is take painkillers to recover from the damage and it takes awhile to recover. It's not instant heal, unless you take so many that it fill. (It's not smart playing, if you did that though.)In Max Payne 2, there is a love interest. Max Payne 2 was as awesome game, if not better than Max Payne 1. There is even Mona Sax to play in some parts of the game. She helps Max with his adventures and problems and later on they do fall in love.The game is just better in telling the story and the story actually make sense. What happened in this movie is that the writer used the main story of Max Payne 1 and some parts of Max Payne 2, but added many crazy pieces of the their to the story. Then, all those original ideas twisted the story around and made a very bad story. The story just doesn't make sense.What I saw in the movie. The beginning of the movie is much the same as in the game. But, later we find out that now the killers of Max's family while using this drug. This drug we later find out will take away a person fears, make them feel like they are stronger, and it can help heal a person too. The side effect is that they do go crazy and they become addicted to the drug. Max doesn't use too many weapons in the movie, maybe 2 or 3. In the game there were over 10 at least. Bullet Time in this movie was one screen and you can miss it easy, if you didn't know what you were seeing. It really fast! I wish they could had use it more than once.In this movie, Max doesn't like Mona and not even close to working wanting to work together. lol Mona just wants to help max because her sister died and she wants to get revenge on the people that killed her, otherwise they would never work with each other. I really thought they didn't need to have Mona in this movie and they should had just left Max Payne 2 story part out. But, since this is a Hollywood movie now, I guess they couldn't but help throw in a possible love interest. Hollywood was banking on this movie to be great and then have a second movie to show Mona and Max fall in love. That's not going to happen now. So, now we just see two people hate working with each other.Just don't buy this movie. It is a rental, if I ever saw one.",2,An extra star for the hot girl!,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,3443,"['So', 'tend', 'do', 'lot', 'usually', 'give', 'movies', 'one', 'extra', 'star', 'just', 'hot', 'girl', 'movie', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'WOW', 'SMOKING', 'Now', 'moving', 'movie', 'otherwise', '1', 'star', 'movie', 'guess', 'Max', 'Pyane', 'went', 'Hollywood', 'horrible', 'retelling', 'first', 'two', 'games', 'What', 'hell', 'did', 'just', 'see', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Okay', 'video', 'Max', 'Payne', 'story', 'based', 'having', 'family', 'wife', 'child', 'murder', 'never', 'found', 'killers', 'Max', 'deep', 'depression', 'becomes', 'could', 'inside', 'eventually', 'lead', 'may', 'help', 'solve', 'case', 'years', 'later', 'Then', 'way', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'finding', 'was', 'part', 'bigger', 'crime', 'stopping', 'game', 'get', 'use', 'many', 'different', 'kinds', 'weapons', 'Also', 'game', 'feature', 'should', 'use', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'win', 'Bullet', 'Time', 'where', 'Max', 'everything', 'slow', 'mo', 'fashion', 'seeing', 'enemies', 'moving', 'shooting', 'where', 'are', 'still', 'moving', 'almost', 'real', 'time', 'so', 'can', 'actually', 'still', 'avoid', 'bullets', 'damage', 'using', 'feature', 'Max', 'get', 'hurt', 'game', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'much', 'damage', 'will', 'die', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'take', 'painkillers', 'recover', 'damage', 'awhile', 'recover', 'not', 'instant', 'heal', 'take', 'so', 'many', 'fill', 'not', 'smart', 'playing', 'did', 'Max', 'Payne', '2', 'love', 'interest', 'Max', 'Payne', '2', 'was', 'awesome', 'game', 'not', 'better', 'Max', 'Payne', '1', 'even', 'Mona', 'Sax', 'play', 'parts', 'game', 'Max', 'adventures', 'problems', 'later', 'do', 'fall', 'love.The', 'game', 'just', 'better', 'telling', 'story', 'story', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'What', 'happened', 'movie', 'writer', 'used', 'main', 'story', 'Max', 'Payne', '1', 'parts', 'Max', 'Payne', '2', 'added', 'many', 'crazy', 'pieces', 'story', 'Then', 'original', 'ideas', 'twisted', 'story', 'made', 'very', 'bad', 'story', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.What', 'saw', 'movie', 'beginning', 'movie', 'much', 'same', 'game', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'now', 'killers', 'Max', 'family', 'using', 'drug', 'drug', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'person', 'fears', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'stronger', 'can', 'help', 'heal', 'person', 'too', 'side', 'effect', 'do', 'go', 'crazy', 'become', 'addicted', 'drug', 'Max', ""n't"", 'use', 'too', 'many', 'weapons', 'movie', 'maybe', '2', '3', 'game', 'were', '10', 'least', 'Bullet', 'Time', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'screen', 'can', 'miss', 'easy', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'seeing', 'really', 'fast', 'wish', 'could', 'had', 'use', 'more', 'once.In', 'movie', 'Max', ""n't"", 'like', 'Mona', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'working', 'wanting', 'work', 'together', 'lol', 'Mona', 'just', 'help', 'max', 'sister', 'died', 'get', 'revenge', 'people', 'killed', 'otherwise', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'other', 'really', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'Mona', 'movie', 'should', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'Max', 'Payne', '2', 'story', 'part', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'now', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'throw', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'banking', 'movie', 'be', 'great', 'then', 'have', 'second', 'movie', 'show', 'Mona', 'Max', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'now', 'So', 'now', 'just', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'hate', 'working', 'other.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'rental', 'ever', 'saw', 'one']",N/A

We watched the 'Extended Cut' and were not disappointed. They spared no change in producing this film. If you want to see the best your Blu-ray system can deliver, then look no further.  It was extraordinarily beautiful---almost 3D like.  I'm left to think of some of the snow scenes and how I felt I could reach out and capture the giant snowflakes---how I reached for a throw, suddenly feeling a chill.I thought Mark Wahlberg did a splendid job portraying Payne.  I was immediately drawn into the storyline with him seeking those responsible for the brutal murders of his wife and baby and how he was willing to die to avenge their deaths.  His grief and anger were palpable and justifiable.I've enjoyed Max Payne video games and I don't feel that they did an injustice to the gaming fans, with this production.  I could easily translate Mark Wahlberg's character and the setting, into that of the games.I did have to suspend disbelief regarding the pharmaceutical company and, 'the drug.'  This is why I took off one star.  For example, every person who takes a hallucinogenic drug will not have the same hallucinations, so I was a little baffled by the big winged creatures that appeared to be everyone's' side-effect, but they looked really cool, so I almost forgive them.Several have said they felt there were slow moments, but I have to say I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 103 minutes.

1217639,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001MTYRJS,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Just because a certain film is based on a video game doesn't mean it is a terrible film. It takes someone like Uwe Boll to make a truly horrible film like ""Alone in the Dark"" and John Moore, the director of ""Max Payne,"" whose CV includes decent action ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" is undoubtedly a much better director. To be fair, in ""Max Payne"" Moore captures the pessimistic ambience of film noir, doom-laden world of crimes and violence with nice cinematography.In fact, actions of ""Max Payne"" themselves are very good, stylish with lots of shattering glass and flying bullets, often shot in slow motion. But we have to wait for them to happen in the climax, and the wait is so long. The slow-moving story with flashbacks only drags, contentedly taking the well-trodden path of conspiracy and intrigue in crime/action film genre. I am afraid for most viewers the film's story is just boring and characters uninteresting. I haven't played the original game, but I believe it would be a much more thrilling experience playing one than watching this adaptation.Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg tries to bring depth to the cardboard character he plays, an angry NYPD police detective whose wife and child were murdered. I don't know to what part of this project he was attracted, especially when he was seen in critically acclaimed ""Departed."" Beautiful Olga Kurylenko (""Quantum of Solace"") appears, but her role is disappointingly small, and it made me very sad to see Chris O'Donnell doing an unmemorable support here.If I remember correctly, one character in the film warns rather ominously that you should ""stay away from Max Payne.""

It set up the story of course but it took a long time for this movie to take off. If you have played the game you would think this movie was going to be a non stop action-fest. It was hardly that. In some ways that was a good thing because it wasn't just a rollercoaster ride of mindless action. But knowing the Max Payne game I expected a mindless rollercoaster of action. Mark Wahlberg is just not a good actor at all. He is so one dimesional that it is like watching an actor wearing a mask with a scowel and big flaired gorilla nostrils. Up until the half way point when they started explaining some things I thought this was Max Payned trying to merge with Constantine or some kind of super natural stuff. It really was bad. When it reached that half way point and the action started and they explained some things it wasn't as bad. If I had to rate it I would give the first part a 1 or 1 1/2 and the second part maybe a 2 1/2.It is worth watching once but there are a lot better action movies and movies based on games out there.,2,A Payne To Watch,1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,1129,"['was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'first', 'part', 'really', 'was', 'slow', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'course', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'take', 'off', 'have', 'played', 'game', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'non', 'stop', 'action-fest', 'was', 'hardly', 'ways', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'mindless', 'action', 'knowing', 'Max', 'Payne', 'game', 'expected', 'mindless', 'rollercoaster', 'action', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'so', 'one', 'dimesional', 'watching', 'actor', 'wearing', 'mask', 'scowel', 'big', 'flaired', 'gorilla', 'nostrils', 'half', 'way', 'point', 'when', 'started', 'explaining', 'things', 'thought', 'was', 'Max', 'Payned', 'trying', 'merge', 'Constantine', 'kind', 'super', 'natural', 'stuff', 'really', 'was', 'bad', 'When', 'reached', 'half', 'way', 'point', 'action', 'started', 'explained', 'things', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'had', 'rate', 'would', 'give', 'first', 'part', '1', '1', '1/2', 'second', 'part', 'maybe', '2', '1/2.It', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'action', 'movies', 'movies', 'based', 'games', 'out', 'there']",N/A

1217642,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001MTYRJS,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 1]","A review of the Unrated Director's Cut:Video game to movie adaptations are almost a dime a dozen. Sure, there have been more misses than hits. I liked the movie adaptation of ""Silent Hill"", have very mixed feelings about the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, and I thought the recent ""Hitman"" adaptation was quite mediocre. So I decided to check out this latest video game adaptation of ""Max Payne""--I mean I know it's going to be mediocre, so how bad can it really be? Well, I haven't played the video game, so I cannot make a comment how faithful it is to its source material, I am rather betting that it is VERY ""loosely based"". Otherwise, I would wonder how the video game became a hit, because this film is definitely not. While comic book adaptations have achieved respect from Hollywood, it seems like video game franchises have not.A brooding detective named Max Payne (Mark Wahlberg) is working the cold case files in the hopes of finding his wife's murderer. His wife and child were killed by a trio of junkies and while he killed two of them, one is still out there. One night, he hooks up with a beautiful girl named Natasha (Olga Kurylenko) and the next day, she is found cut to many pieces. She had Max's wallet in her hand which prompted his former partner Alex (Donal Logue) to cover for him and ends up dead. Natasha's sister Mona (Mila Kunis) is a mob assassin who comes looking for Payne, and the situation gets worst as they decide to pool their resources. Max finds out that his wife's murder three years ago, may be linked to the pharmaceutical company she used to work for. There is a designer drug out in the streets that causes confidence and calmness all the more feeling invincible--this drug was meant for the use of the military to strengthen morale but dumped because of its hallucinogenic side effects. Now, Max must find a soldier named Lupino to uncover the truth--but the truth may just lead him to a family friend named BB (Beau Bridges)...The problems with the film is the fact that the screenplay by Beau Throne feels very befuddled. Nothing special really happens and the film is downright predictable. The links to Natasha's killing and Max's wife feels like a throw-away detail, a drug with military potential is used as a designer drug, a huge corporation wishing to make a profit out of a mistake, a murdered partner, betrayal by a family friend, all are overused ideas. Ok, I'll try to be nice, there are a lot of movies that follow the same formulas but the way the script is structured in this movie is just so empty and dull. The film just throws out the routine cop with a mission of vengeance with a very hollow execution as director John Moore (responsible for the abysmal Omen remake) opts for a repetitive narrative as the film goes on. There is nothing daring, exciting or dramatic in the proceedings, all it does is go through the entire motivations and Max's intentions over and over again. The film doesn't offer anything inventive and feels like the film's script has been rewritten hundreds of times.For reasons unknown, the film doesn't even develop on its remaining aces. Mila Kunis' character is so severely underused--Her promise as a supreme hot girl with a big gun goes nowhere. The film's opening act with the potential for ""Norse Valkyries"" as a soldier's guardian angel was pitched into the plot but abandoned, in favor of a lame idea of a corporate scheme to make profit out of a failed drug that uses it as idolatry. Voluptuously sexy ex-Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko has a very small role and disappears before her presence can inspire excitement from the male audience. (sorry no sex or nudity here) The film also leaves a lot of things unresolved and undeveloped, it`s predictability and clich&eacute;s do hurt the film. The images of the valkyries only end up as ""eye-candy"" as Max shoots his way to the final showdown in the midst of visions of Valhalla on Earth.The action isn't that good either. Director Moore uses an over-abundant use of slow motion in an attempt to look cool and emulate a ""matrix-like"" style. The gunfights also have that Asian inspiration as Max leaps, and avoids bullets with ease--either he's really good or these bad guys just supremely suck. The cinematography of the film is nice and emulates a moody and gloomy atmosphere (what is up with this style?). The CGI generated environment is pretty and looks cool. The camera work by Jonathan Shea is decent and the special effects weren't bad as Max rampages through the cosmic hallucinations to reach his end goal. Unfortunately, whatever the film achieved visually is overshadowed by the film's flaws that all the special effects and gorgeous set designs just couldn't save the film from becoming a lost. It does make it more acceptable but not by much.Mark Wahlberg is a decent lead, I liked him in ""The Departed"" and ""Shooter"". The man isn't the best performer but he did what he could with whatever little he has to work with. Beau Bridges makes for a ungainly antagonist-- his character is just so underwhelming and uninteresting that you wonder what the fuss was all about. Meg Griffin is also severely underused and her character is left hanging (maybe hints of a sequel?) The film does have some humble pay off amid all the bad screenplay, and it would have helped for more developed characters.I suppose the film's enjoyment would depend on just how much of a fan you are of the video game. The film is a just a decent visual feast and so below the standards of a great action flick--that it fails even more as below average video game adaptation. Director John Moore almost does turn the tables but it was just too little, too late. The film is full of unnecessary prattle and so little excitement. The film is a brainless attempt and you may want to take a nap until the eye candy effects take over in the final act. It is a supreme exercise of too much STYLE over very little substance.RENTAL [2  Stars]Note: There is nothing special about the unrated cut except for the extra bloody clouds when a bullet hits its target.Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Beautiful transfer--clean, black levels are strong and solid. The colors are intentionally muted to give it a noir-like feel. 5.1 Dolby Digital track is very clear and powerful.Extras: I didn't bother but it does look interesting, as Moore explains why he
