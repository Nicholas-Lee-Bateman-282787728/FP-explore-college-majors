It is so rare to come across a gem of a film like this.  It shows just how great movies have the potential to be, though they almost never rise to this level.  As one reviewer put it, C.R.A.Z.Y. is ""magical, mystical, sexy, funny, touching and ever so crazy.""  It is a movie you will never forget.This is not just one of the best movies of recent years, but one of the best ever made.",5,This movie immediately went into my Top 10 Favorite Movies list,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,576,"['First', 'answer', 'question', 'reviewer', 'had', 'not', 'DVD', 'English', 'subtitles', 'can', 'confirm', 'was', 'shocked', 'delighted', 'how', 'wonderful', 'C.R.A.Z.Y', 'so', 'rare', 'come', 'gem', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'movies', 'have', 'potential', 'be', 'almost', 'never', 'rise', 'level', 'one', 'reviewer', 'put', 'C.R.A.Z.Y', 'magical', 'mystical', 'sexy', 'funny', 'touching', 'ever', 'so', 'crazy', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'forget.This', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made']",C.R.A.Z.Y.

I would dearly like to see it again -- even at the exorbitant price of $45 -- but I have to refrain for the time being.  The reason:  the details don't specify whether or not this film has ENGLISH SUBTITLES, and I strongly suspect that it DOESN'T.  (It's been my experience with Quebec DVD films in the past that if they don't specifically MENTION subtitles, there ARE no subtitles.)  I've inquired about this to Amazon, but have not received the courtesy of a reply yet.  So, much as I would like to recommend that you check out this amazing character-driven film right away, I can only suggest that you hold off for the time being, until the issue is cleared up.  (Unless you SPEAK French, of course ... then go for it!)* Update: Thanks to another Amazon user, I found out that the DVD was available from an alternate source for a lot less money and definitely DID have English subtitles.  I strongly believe that it's the same version that Amazon is offering.  Why they refuse to update the details is a mystery, but you can now consider it safe to purchase if you don't speak French.",5,"I saw it, loved it, and want to buy it.

936637,A3TOWO3PUY3DGL,B000B6H0OC,-Ashi-,"[0, 0]","What a delight!  The movie is about a guy who is the fourth child of the family (the family ended up having five boys: Christian, Raymond, Antoine, Zac, Yvan.  OMGsh!  CRAZY) who was born on Christmas (good timing).  He had an idea he was different, but he didn't want to admit it.  His family didn't like it, and that subject was a taboo.  You know what that subject is....What differentiates this movie from other gay coming-of-age stories is that he wasn't out-and-proud.  That's refreshing.  Which gay person hasn't (physically and/or mentally) self-mutilated themselves until they finally could admit a fact they cannot change?Another refreshing feature of this French gay movie is good writing.  Come on, everyone.  You know it, but you don't want to admit it.  Gay themed movies is littered with gawful scripts (and acting!).  Once in a blue moon you'll come across with gems likeEdge of Seventeen,The Mudge BoyorThe Line of Beauty, but typically you get instead is some one and half hour farce.  In CRAZY, you get exceptionally well-caricatured family members.  I bet by the end of the movie you'd at least remember the stubborn military father who enjoyed singing karaoke or Raymond the do-no-good brother who was our main boy's nemesis (but also best ally).It's all about the family.

936643,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000B6H0OC,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","C.R.A.Z.Y. is a miraculous little film from Quebec written with pitch perfect dialogue by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e and Franois Boulay, on whose memories of his own experiences the story is based, directed with tremendous zest and sensitivity by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e, and with a cast of fine actors that would be impossible to duplicate. Yes, it really is that fine. The title of the film may put some people off as silly, so let it be said early on that the letters C.R.A.Z.Y. represent the first names of the sons of the Beaulieu family - and the fun, hilarious and touching story starts from there!Christmas Day is the birth of Zachary Beaulieu (impressive Marc-Andr&eacute; Grondin as a young man and &Eacute;mile Vall&eacute;e as a youth), the fourth son of Gervais Beaulieu (a brilliant Michel Ct&eacute;) and his seemingly perpetually pregnant wife Laurianne Beaulieu (Danielle Proulx, a superb actress), and at his birth he is immediately dropped on the floor, 'dies' for a few seconds, and is resuscitated, a fact which later leads his mother to consult her Tupperware friend/seer about Zachary's power from God to heal other people. The children include Raymond who is a boisterous youth and later a worthless drifter/panhandler (played by Pierre-Luc Brillant as a young man but also played as a youth by Emmanuel Raymond and Antoine Ct&eacute;-Potvin); Christian (Maxime Tremblay as a young man and Jean-Alexandre L&eacute;tourneau as a youth; Antoine (Alex Gravel as a young man and S&eacute;bastien Blouin as a youth; and Yvan (F&eacute;lix-Antoine Despatie and Gabriel Lalancette). Each brother has a particular personality, whether a bookworm, an athlete, a ne're-do-well or a dreamer and we watch the family adapt to each of the brothers' idiosyncrasies.But it is Zachary who is the focal point as he struggles with his sexual identity from childhood on through his teenage denial years while dating a girl, to his final longing for the unreachable relationship with a man as an adult. His 'powers' of healing he uses to great advantage for his family and he gradually becomes disenchanted with the omnipresent Catholic Church, a force that plays heavily in his fantasy life and dreams and fears. As the years pass from 1960 to 1971 we are allow to watch a family connect, fragment and ultimately survive, always bound to traditions of holiday and love. Gervais claims all of the good points of his boys as patterned after him, yet as he faces Zachary's possibly being gay he balks and it is only after a mesmerizing life changing experience Zachary undergoes that Zachary and Gervais finally find the mutual love they have both needed.Though the film is long (running time is over two hours) the film seems to fly past us like a comet of experience to which we all can relate. The performances are so very powerful that they sweep us away with the amount of love they exhibit: Danielle Proulx as the mother is so subtle in the little things she does for her beloved though at times wayward sons that she glows and Michel Ct&eacute; steals the screen as a father searching for understanding of his crew of crazy boys. But the revelation is Marc-Andr&eacute; Grondin's embodiment of Zachary that is nothing short of a miracle of acting. There is not a weak moment in this little masterpiece of filmmaking and one hopes that it will be released and widely publicized in the theaters in the USA as it deserves standing ovations! Highly recommended. In French (Quebecois) with English subtitles.

But, here and now, let's look a little deeper into our thinking about the three more important members of this C.R.A.Z.Y family:  there's Michel Cote's ""Dad""---he's the anchor around which ""Zac's"" life raft circles.  And Marc-Andre Grondin's ""Zac""---he's the one never so happy as when his father is accepting him.......acknowledging him.  And never forget Danielle Proulx's ""Mom""---she's every gay boy's ""dream-delight"" of a parent, the one who knows how to keep that 'different' child on an even keel.Here's a film trip downright engineered to dig up / dredge out memories of times with ""Dad"".......times in car washing driveways, times of just-you-two car rides-----""connecting times"" you'd thought....you'd hoped......but maybe not.  And for many of us, other not so happy memories perhaps raising their ugly heads-----yet even for that we've got to say:  Thank you, Director Vallee.Sudden inspiration!......did YOU catch it:  Cote's ""Dad"" and Grondin's ""Zac"" are the 2-sides of the same coin.  The two of them are more alike than any other 2 family members shown in this film.  Sadly, how many wasted years and how much heartache til they found that out and, eventually, owned up to it.  Repeating, I believe a lot of ""Dad's"" 'problem' was that he sometimes realized he was a great deal more like ""Zac"" (or vice versa) than he was comfortable with.  That's when their relationship would 'cycle down.'  Ah, poor ""Zac,"" how does one cope with that?  Took him a very long time to figure out how to do so, didn't it?Finally, one thing truly stands out for me, and that is how very difficult it has to be for an, essentially, first-time theatrical film actor to, let's face it, carry a 2+ hour movie.........this being Grondin's first ever film since reaching teenage.  And as a final thought about Marc-Andre, why not admit it:  what an amazing kid; even more, what a great 'package'.......what a gorgeous ass!  What more could Grondin want from life?PS--I'll tell you this---I'm gonna buy anything of Grondin's work that comes along.

936650,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000B6H0OC,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","The French-Canadian film ""C.R.A.Z.Y."" begins on Christmas Day 1960 with the birth of Zac Beaulieu, the fourth of what will turn out to be five sons of Gervais and Laurianne Beaulieu.  From very early on, Zac begins to see himself as somehow ""different"" from his other brothers and, indeed, from all other boys around him.  While his other siblings seem to have found their individual niches in life - one's a cool Casanova-type ladykiller, another a rough-and-tumble jock, another a book-obsessed brainiac - Zac suffers from asthma, wets his bed and would rather play with a baby carriage than the hockey game his father bought him for his birthday/Christmas present.  In fact, thanks to his sharing his birthday with Jesus, Zac's devout but highly superstitious Catholic mother has always believed her boy has some miraculous connection with the healing powers of the Savior (obscure relatives are encouraged to call the Beaulieu residence when they are suffering from some minor injury or illness).  Zac's dad, meanwhile, struggles with making sure Zac doesn't turn out to be a mollycoddled ""fairy,"" which would be not only a disgrace to the family but an embarrassing indictment of himself as a father .""C.R.A.Z.Y."" takes its title from both the first letters of each of the boys' names as well as the Patsy Cline song that is a particular favorite of their father's.  This is a brilliantly perceptive and emotionally devastating look into the heartbreaking struggle that gay youngsters have to endure growing up in a world that teaches them that there is something ""wrong"" with them if they happen to find themselves drawn to people of the same rather than the opposite gender.  The last thing Zac wants to admit to himself, let alone to anyone else, is that he is attracted to other boys.  When his father suspects that Zac may be heading in that direction, the son perceives a change in the man's attitude towards him.  The dad to whom he once felt so close suddenly seems distant and no longer accepting of his boy.  Thus, fearing rejection from the very people who mean the most to him, and with no one and nowhere else to turn to, Zac spends much of his life fruitlessly pleading with God to perform a miracle of ""change"" in him and to take away his ""affliction"" (he is so steeped in self-denial that he convinces himself that it is his asthma he is praying about and not his sexuality).  He also gets himself a girlfriend as a way of hiding the truth from himself and others, and sublimates his own anger and self-hatred by beating up another boy whom Zac suspects of being the same way.  However, through various key incidents and events in his life and the life of his family, Zac slowly comes to accept himself and to even make some inroads into the heart of his recalcitrant father.Based largely on his own experiences growing up in Montreal, director Jean-Marc Vallee has co-written (with Francois Boulay) a beautifully insightful screenplay that not only shows the fear, loneliness and self-loathing that come to dominate Zac's life, but perfectly captures the complex dynamics of life in this one family.  The father is by no means a ""bad"" man; he is a faithful provider who loves his wife and children and wants only the best for them.  The fact that he can't accept his son's possible homosexuality is an understandable by-product of the time and society in which he lives.  Like all of us, he fears that which he doesn't understand, and with no precedents - either personal or societal - to help guide him in this area, he firmly believes that he is doing the right thing in first taking Zac to a counselor to ""cure"" him, then banishing him from his home when Zac is seen in a car with another man.  Ironically, Zac's mother, despite her tendency towards mysticism and superstition, is, in many ways, the most level-headed and tethered-to-reality of all the people in the family, arguing that their boy is no less worthy of love and acceptance simply because he isn`t like all the rest.  Even though the characters fill the roles set for them by society, none of them is a clich&eacute; or stereotype but is instead a fully-rounded individual, with the good and bad traits, strengths and weaknesses that we all share as human beings.Despite its miniscule budget, the movie is ambitious in scope, spanning a period of 21 years from 1960 to 1981, capturing the flavor of the era through such defining touchstones as drug use and the music of David Bowie, Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones.  Rather than following a set formula, the script frequently veers off into unexpected paths and by-ways, making it appear less theatrical in nature and more like real life.The performances by Marc-Andre Grondin as Zac, Michael Cote as his father, and Danielle Proulx as his mother are beautiful and heartbreaking to behold.  Grondin, in particular, has an amazing talent for showing us a character whose internal impulses are constantly at war with his external actions.  Emile Vallee is also superb as Zac at a younger age.This is a beautifully realized tale of the dangers of repression and of the importance of accepting people for who and what they are.
