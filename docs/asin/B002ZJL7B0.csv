It shows how politically motivated religious racism can destroy a friendship. It's a rare jewel that shows that Arab Jews and Muslims can get along, as they have a lot in common. A passionately told story of comraderie and loyalty which compensates for any technical or pacing weaknesses.

Where Tunisia's Jewish population enjoyed privileges not allowed their Muslim neighbors under French rule, now they are persecuted, and German propaganda sows hostility between the religious groups to its own advantage. Living in this crucible of geopolitical ambitions and ethno-religious strife are two young women who are the best of friends: Nour (Olympe Borval), who is Muslim, and Myriam (Lizzie Brocher&eacute;), who is Jewish. Nour has just become engaged to Khaled (Najib Oedghiri), and Myriam warmly congratulates her friend with a touch of envy and admiration.But the War has reached Tunisia. Nour and Khaled cannot be married until he finds employment. Myriam is compelled to marry a wealthy doctor (Simon Abkarian) so that her family might avoid destitution in the face of heavy fines imposed on the Jewish community. The young women's sexual and matrimonial crises might seem like a soap opera were they not in a politically charged environment and imbued with interesting subtext. The North African theater is a neglected subject in American film and literature on World War II, as the US had limited engagement there. But the politics of religion and ethnicity in the Mahgreb, where Germany was able to exploit a century of shortsighted French policy, is a fascinating and painful one. It is brought home in Myriam and Nour's strained friendship.""The Wedding Song"" contains more nudity than one might expect from a story about traditional lifestyles in a Muslim country in the 1940s. Karin Albou takes her camera into the hammam, bedrooms, and wedding ceremonies to show us the sensuality that both confines and liberates these young women. Much desired and feared, their bodies play a large role in their fate. Albou is not implying that that's a bad thing, but that it is a fact and that the fetishizing of the female body has consequences. It's interesting to have this sensuality in a film that is otherwise about the effects of politics on ordinary lives. I like ""The Wedding Song"" as a World War II film as well, as it shows us a corner of the war we don't usually see.

It's a story about two girls, one Jewish, the other Muslim in Tunisia during the German occupation in the Second World War. The movie convincingly weaves a complex emotional narrative about these two girls, their prospective husbands, traditional North-African  attitudes to women, anti-semitism, the girls' friendship, collaboration with oppressors, German exploitation, racism, privileged disdain for the Muslim 'natives,' fascist propaganda, illiteracy among Muslim women, colonialism and much more.You might think that a movie dealing with all of this would be trying to do too much, but each scene is so carefully drawn, a few words of dialog, a glance, a gesture, that we grasp right away what is going on, a young man desperate for work, a mother fearing poverty, a husband afraid of cowardice.  At each point in the story we are given so much detail, so much honest insight into history, culture and religion.  All these intricate pieces are fitted together perfectly.When I see that Wedding Song has 10 reviews and Rambo has 327 reviews I'm baffled.  So, if there are any of you out there who are tired of watching Rambo movies and want instead to see a really good film, watch Wedding Song.",5,"Tunisia in 1942 might seem a bit irrelevent now, but it's not.

Perfect in every way.  The first thing you will notice is the colors.  You will ""feel"" the outside and the inside of these homes like never before.  You will ""feel"" you are in their world like no one else has ever portrayed it before.  I wish I knew what it was the director did to evoke such feelings in us.  Was it as simple as lighting????  I just know this is going on my list as a favorite movie of all time.  I want to immediately watch it again, but am worried I will ""ruin a good thing"" so will put a little time between watchings.Another interesting though confusing aspect of this film is that the inhabitants of this town were both Muslim and Jew.  Muslims who spoke Arabic AND  French, and Jews who understood? Arabic and spoke French.  Since I hadn't remembered the back of the DVD box telling me the setting was Tunis....(which I know little about anyway), I was so intrigued at the languages coming out of the nationalities of people.  And why were French Jews living alongside French Muslims?Surely easily answered with a little history lesson.The actors were amazing.  The French Jewish girl a gem and so stunning in beauty.  The close relationship of the two girls that lessor minds would assume was almost lesbian, while higher minds will know is just how close young girls can be in hugging and kissing on the cheek.  It takes you to a time when this was commonplace and not considered sexual.  There is a lot of nudity in the film, and as I'm sure others have pointed out, even close ups of the vaginal mound.  But if ever in the history of movie making was this NOT gratuitous nudity; this is it.  The nudity was not sexual, it was of women in the communal steam baths.  And the vaginal scenes were in showing a girl being readied for marriage by removing her pubic and arm hair (!) as the groom requested his bride to be ""oriental"" in presentation, as opposed to ""European"" (which made me laugh when I realized European meant ""hairy"").I was also transfixed by the bare feet stained blue on the bottom to mimic? shoes; open rooms to the outside; and lack of underwear.  These women live so close to nature and being natural as you can imagine.  Its as though the body is perfectly OK as it is, and you simply throw a dress over your bare skin and walk out to the street.  (what a concept)  I wondered how many centuries old was the well that they used for water.  The blue-wash of the walls was also mesmerizing.

1314340,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002ZJL7B0,Z Hayes,"[14, 15]","""The Wedding Song"" is a unique and credibly acted movie directed by Karin Albou. The setting is 1942 Tunis, and the Nazis are occupying the country. Just like the rest of Nazi-occupied territories, anti-Jewish propaganda is rampant. The native Tunisian Muslims, who have been oppressed under the French colonialists, are given leaflets that encourage their cooperation whilst persuading them that the Allies do not have their best interests at heart. There is great poverty everywhere, and the movie basically focuses on two girls - Nour (Olympe Boval) is a Muslim girl who comes from an impoverished family and Myriam (Lizzie Bochere) is a Jewish teenager who is being raised by her widowed seamstress mother. The girls have been best friends since their childhood, their houses share the same courtyard and they are both poor. However, there is one great difference - the French had carried out a policy of divide and conquer, allowing only the non-natives access to education and positions in government. As a Jew, Myriam has received an education, whereas Nour by virtue of her ethnicity and being a female, has been deprived of schooling. Myriam is free to walk wherever she pleases, unveiled but Nour, as a Muslim woman, needs to veil herself and can only go out if she is chaperoned (still practiced in many Middle Eastern countries).Despite these differences, the two girls share a very close bond, one that is threatened by the Nazi invasion and subsequent policies. Slowly, the girls find their religious differences to be a barrier that threatens their friendship. Nour's fiance Khaled (Najib Oudghiri) is poor and unemployed, and Nour's father refuses to allow their marriage because of this. Out of desperation and resentment towards the Jews, Khaled works for the Nazis as a translator and collaborates in looting Jewish property. In the meantime, Myriam finds herself being forced into an arranged marriage to a much older and wealthy doctor, Raoul (Simon Abkarian). Myriam's mother sees this as the only means for them to escape poverty. Myriam wishes to marry for love, like Nour, but finds there are no viable options for her, especially when the Nazis demand a 200 million francs payoff from the Jewish community.The movie effectively captures the complex friendship between the two girls through the ups and downs. The girls' bonds are sorely tested by circumstances and the politics of the time, yet Myriam covers for Nour when she arranges clandestine meetings with Khaled, and Nour helps Myriam when the Nazis come for the Jews. The girls' maturation is also credibly portrayed as they become more aware of the men in their lives - Nour comes to realize that though Khaled may be her great love, he has his flaws; and Myriam comes to realize much later that Raoul is not the monster she imagines him to be.The movie is also a rich source of information about the customs and rituals of womanhood - Nour and Myriam go to the hammam (a bath house for women); Myriam has to undergo the torturous process of having her pubic hair removed by wax prior to her marriage (performed by an older woman and portrayed in graphic detail); and, on her wedding night, Nour's husband is expected to present evidence that Nour is a virgin by showing the blood-stained sheet from the marital bed.There is one scene in the movie which I found to be compelling in the message it delivers about religious harmony. ""The Wedding Song"" is a thoughtful reflection upon friendship, and womanhood, and I was absolutely captivated by it.",5,Lyrical and touching portrayal of friendship that transcends religious boundaries,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,3532,"['Wedding', 'Song', 'unique', 'credibly', 'acted', 'movie', 'directed', 'Karin', 'Albou', 'setting', '1942', 'Tunis', 'Nazis', 'are', 'occupying', 'country', 'Just', 'rest', 'Nazi-occupied', 'territories', 'anti-Jewish', 'propaganda', 'rampant', 'native', 'Tunisian', 'Muslims', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'oppressed', 'French', 'colonialists', 'are', 'given', 'leaflets', 'encourage', 'cooperation', 'persuading', 'Allies', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'interests', 'heart', 'great', 'poverty', 'everywhere', 'movie', 'basically', 'two', 'girls', 'Nour', 'Olympe', 'Boval', 'Muslim', 'girl', 'who', 'impoverished', 'family', 'Myriam', 'Lizzie', 'Bochere', 'Jewish', 'teenager', 'who', 'being', 'raised', 'widowed', 'seamstress', 'mother', 'girls', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'childhood', 'houses', 'share', 'same', 'courtyard', 'are', 'poor', 'However', 'one', 'great', 'difference', 'French', 'had', 'carried', 'out', 'policy', 'divide', 'conquer', 'allowing', 'only', 'non-natives', 'access', 'education', 'positions', 'government', 'Jew', 'Myriam', 'received', 'education', 'Nour', 'virtue', 'ethnicity', 'being', 'female', 'been', 'deprived', 'schooling', 'Myriam', 'free', 'walk', 'unveiled', 'Nour', 'Muslim', 'woman', 'veil', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'out', 'chaperoned', 'still', 'practiced', 'many', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries', '.Despite', 'differences', 'two', 'girls', 'share', 'very', 'close', 'bond', 'one', 'threatened', 'Nazi', 'invasion', 'subsequent', 'policies', 'Slowly', 'girls', 'find', 'religious', 'differences', 'be', 'barrier', 'friendship', 'Nour', 'fiance', 'Khaled', 'Najib', 'Oudghiri', 'poor', 'unemployed', 'Nour', 'father', 'allow', 'marriage', 'desperation', 'resentment', 'Jews', 'Khaled', 'Nazis', 'translator', 'collaborates', 'looting', 'Jewish', 'property', 'meantime', 'Myriam', 'being', 'forced', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'much', 'older', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'Raoul', 'Simon', 'Abkarian', 'Myriam', 'mother', 'only', 'escape', 'poverty', 'Myriam', 'marry', 'love', 'Nour', 'are', 'viable', 'options', 'especially', 'when', 'Nazis', 'demand', '200', 'million', 'francs', 'payoff', 'Jewish', 'community.The', 'movie', 'effectively', 'complex', 'friendship', 'two', 'girls', 'ups', 'downs', 'girls', 'bonds', 'are', 'sorely', 'tested', 'circumstances', 'politics', 'time', 'yet', 'Myriam', 'covers', 'Nour', 'when', 'clandestine', 'meetings', 'Khaled', 'Nour', 'Myriam', 'when', 'Nazis', 'come', 'Jews', 'girls', 'maturation', 'also', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'become', 'more', 'aware', 'men', 'lives', 'Nour', 'realize', 'Khaled', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'love', 'flaws', 'Myriam', 'realize', 'much', 'later', 'Raoul', 'not', 'monster', 'be.The', 'movie', 'also', 'rich', 'source', 'information', 'customs', 'rituals', 'womanhood', 'Nour', 'Myriam', 'go', 'hammam', 'bath', 'house', 'women', 'Myriam', 'undergo', 'torturous', 'process', 'having', 'pubic', 'hair', 'removed', 'wax', 'prior', 'marriage', 'performed', 'older', 'woman', 'portrayed', 'graphic', 'detail', 'wedding', 'night', 'Nour', 'husband', 'expected', 'present', 'evidence', 'Nour', 'virgin', 'showing', 'blood-stained', 'sheet', 'marital', 'bed.There', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'compelling', 'message', 'religious', 'harmony', 'Wedding', 'Song', 'thoughtful', 'reflection', 'friendship', 'womanhood', 'was', 'absolutely', 'captivated']",N/A
