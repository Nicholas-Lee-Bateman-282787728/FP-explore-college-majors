992624,A3JABB4NAPKLC0,B000FL7CAU,33 year old lawyer,"[7, 9]","I find it odd that some posters say this is not a good season...I totally disagree. I find that the later seasons are better than the early ones for this series. In the first few seasons, the level of altercations that Larry got himself into, and the manic quality of Richard Lewis, really kind of grated on my nerves. Suzie, as well. There were just some episodes that seemed to have too much screaming all around for my nerves.This season is mellower overall, and in my opinion, as entertaining, if not more so, than the previous seasons. I would venture to say it is best season ever, although I missed season 4, so I can't actually say that. This season has all the charm and laughs and quirkiness, less of the screaming. The Jewish/Christian humor is a major theme of this season, and the episode featuring Larry's trip to an imagined heaven, and his trip to his Christian birth parents, were absolutely laugh out loud hysterical. There are some nice cameos by Dustin Hoffman and Sascha Baron Cohen (Borat), and Bea Arthur, as Larry's deceased mother. I also thought the episode where Larry pretends to be an Orthodox Jew hysterical, especially when he he keeps trying to attempt Yiddish. Now that Woody Allen seems to have lost his sense of humor, there are few comedians around who can explore these issues in a funny way.  I also enjoyed the Lesbians episode a lot. Rosie O'Donnell does a good cameo in that one. And, as people have pointed out, the sex offender with golf tips was another highlight. Larry's dad has some entertaining moments in this season also, such as in the sandwich episode and Larry's death episode. Richard Lewis needs a kidney transplant this season, and consequently is mostly portrayed in bed or ill, and thus is not nearly as manic and annoying as he was in the early seasons.My only complaint about this season, and it is a very small one, is that Wanda Sykes showed up in only one episode. She is hysterical and I would have liked to see more of her...",5,Loved it.

But I needn't have worried.I think that what may have happened is that people became overly familiar with the series' highly structured plot formula, wherein Larry ALWAYS gets his comeuppance in the end. But the beauty of the show isn't in seeing the end coming; rather, it's in its wonderful character portrayals and moments of mortification. (I found Cheryl Hines, who plays Larry's wife, to be particularly funny in her reaction shots this season.)Admittedly, episode six has Seinfeld flashback moments concerning ""bathroom contamination"" of reading material, but most of this material seems really fresh.

But any comedian willing to eat edible undies while caught on a stalled ski lift hasn't lost his touch. Larry may now take his place among Basil Fawlty and Edmund Black Adder in the all-time-funniest-yet uncuddly-sitcom-characters sweepstakes. If you like Larry, you'll like season 5. If you don't, well, you're missing out.... Highlights in this season include Kamikaze Bingo, the Ski Lift, the Smoking Jacket, and the episode involving Larry's racist dog.

992659,A3B6X5KB0W963D,B000FL7CAU,Troll Reviewer,"[1, 1]","Season five of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' is notable for being a somewhat experimental season of the show. It features significantly more religion-based humor and plots than any other season coming before it. Larry David doesn't just not back away from religion; he doesn't pull any punches. There are episodes that have storylines about Christianity, Judaism, a sex offender, and the afterlife.""The Larry David Sandwich"" is an excellent premiere, and introduces the subject of religion when the titular character believes that he was saved from drowning by God. ""The Bowtie"" is a pretty solid (although somewhat weak by 'Curb' standards) episode, and the sole episode that Wanda Sykes stars in. Next up is ""The Christ Nail,"" a fan favorite with so many funny sub-plots in it (the tooth fairy, the bra) it's impressive that they were able to cram them all in one episode. ""Kamikaze Bingo"" involves a Japanese art dealer who nearly commits suicide after being told by Larry that his father was not a real Kamikaze pilot. The fifth episode, ""Lewis Needs a Kidney,"" is an underrated classic with one of the funnier physical gags of the show: Larry being denied food by the employee of a fast food restaurant because he walked through a drive-thru instead of driving.""The Smoking Jacket"" is considered by many to be one of the weakest episodes of the show, and I would agree until I saw Larry and Jeff throw out the used mattress after the credits. On a side note, I'm pretty sure it's the only 'Curb' episode I've ever seen that had a closing tag after the credits. ""The Seder"" revolves around Larry inviting a sex offender to Seder, which results in dark comedy. I felt nervous about having laughed at Susie protecting Sammy from the sex offender when he tries to shake her hand. It's what any mother should do, but in the way it's played out here, it's also cringe humor that couldn't get much cringe-ier. ""The Ski Lift"" is another brilliant episode involving Judaism. The penultimate (""The Korean Bookie""), although not a classic episode, is a good example of an episode that does something that most classic 'Curb' episodes do: intertwine numerous plots cleverly. The season finale (""The End"") is one of the most polarizing episodes of the show to date, and several fans of the show view it as a disappointment. I don't know if it's quite that bad. There were maybe some moments that were a little overdone (all the special effects and stuff) although it also had some great cinematography and was quite funny.Overall, season five of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' is a slight improvement over season four. While certainly not as cohesive, it has a better start. It also had a more experimental (even if also occasionally a little surrealist) nature this season. However, more Wanda Sykes would have been nice, and I also wish Cheryl had been somewhat less grumpy this season. She seemed to yell and complain a little more than in the previous seasons. They've always had a nice dynamic, but Cheryl was frustrated more often. Maybe I should cut her some slack, though...she's been with him for nearly 11 years now. Not very women could be with him for that long.Best episodes: ""The Seder"" and ""The Ski Lift""Season grade: A-",5,Amazing season is a slight improvement over the fourth,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,3212,"['Season', 'five', ""'Curb"", 'Enthusiasm', 'notable', 'being', 'somewhat', 'experimental', 'season', 'show', 'significantly', 'more', 'religion-based', 'humor', 'plots', 'other', 'season', 'coming', 'Larry', 'David', ""n't"", 'just', 'not', 'back', 'away', 'religion', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'are', 'episodes', 'have', 'storylines', 'Christianity', 'Judaism', 'sex', 'offender', 'afterlife', 'Larry', 'David', 'Sandwich', 'excellent', 'premiere', 'subject', 'religion', 'when', 'titular', 'character', 'was', 'saved', 'drowning', 'God', 'Bowtie', 'pretty', 'solid', 'somewhat', 'weak', ""'Curb"", 'standards', 'episode', 'sole', 'episode', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'stars', 'Next', 'up', 'Christ', 'Nail', 'fan', 'favorite', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'sub-plots', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'bra', 'impressive', 'were', 'able', 'cram', 'one', 'episode', 'Kamikaze', 'Bingo', 'Japanese', 'art', 'dealer', 'who', 'nearly', 'commits', 'suicide', 'being', 'told', 'Larry', 'father', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'Kamikaze', 'pilot', 'fifth', 'episode', 'Lewis', 'Kidney', 'underrated', 'classic', 'one', 'funnier', 'physical', 'gags', 'show', 'Larry', 'being', 'denied', 'food', 'employee', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'walked', 'drive-thru', 'instead', 'driving', 'Smoking', 'Jacket', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'show', 'would', 'agree', 'saw', 'Larry', 'Jeff', 'throw', 'out', 'used', 'mattress', 'credits', 'side', 'note', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'only', ""'Curb"", 'episode', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'closing', 'tag', 'credits', 'Seder', 'Larry', 'inviting', 'sex', 'offender', 'Seder', 'results', 'dark', 'comedy', 'felt', 'nervous', 'having', 'laughed', 'Susie', 'protecting', 'Sammy', 'sex', 'offender', 'when', 'shake', 'hand', 'what', 'mother', 'should', 'do', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'here', 'also', 'cringe', 'humor', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'cringe-ier', 'Ski', 'Lift', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'involving', 'Judaism', 'penultimate', 'Korean', 'Bookie', 'not', 'classic', 'episode', 'good', 'example', 'episode', 'something', 'most', 'classic', ""'Curb"", 'episodes', 'do', 'intertwine', 'numerous', 'plots', 'cleverly', 'season', 'finale', 'End', 'one', 'most', 'polarizing', 'episodes', 'show', 'date', 'several', 'fans', 'show', 'view', 'disappointment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'bad', 'were', 'maybe', 'moments', 'were', 'little', 'overdone', 'special', 'effects', 'stuff', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'cinematography', 'was', 'quite', 'funny.Overall', 'season', 'five', ""'Curb"", 'Enthusiasm', 'slight', 'improvement', 'season', 'four', 'certainly', 'not', 'cohesive', 'better', 'start', 'also', 'had', 'more', 'experimental', 'even', 'also', 'occasionally', 'little', 'surrealist', 'nature', 'season', 'However', 'more', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'also', 'wish', 'Cheryl', 'had', 'been', 'somewhat', 'less', 'grumpy', 'season', 'seemed', 'yell', 'complain', 'little', 'more', 'previous', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'nice', 'dynamic', 'Cheryl', 'was', 'frustrated', 'more', 'often', 'Maybe', 'should', 'cut', 'slack', 'been', 'nearly', '11', 'years', 'now', 'Not', 'very', 'women', 'could', 'be', 'long.Best', 'episodes', 'Seder', 'Ski', 'Lift', 'Season', 'grade', 'A-']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 5
