The actor playing Julien Donkeyboy spent time with director Korine's uncle (himself a schizophrenic) and does the most impressive and convincing portrayal I've ever seen;  it truly captures the annoying, chattering innocence of a schizophrenic as well as the emotionally violent outbursts and stream of conscious Morris Code mutterings on his own psychological motives which, in real schizophrenics is so threatening and terrorizing.  Werner Herzog jokes at his directorial legacy's expense, achieving levels of hyperbole that exceed even what he accomplishes in the top notch mockumentary, ""Incident at Loch Ness"".  Korine's film was produced in accordance to the Lars von Trier penned ""Dogma95 Manifesto"",  reading it will probably help put the film in context for potential viewers.Three stars for the difficulty of the content for audiences at large, personally I would give it four for being successful in achieving it's aims and being innovative using such difficult subject matter (being that much more difficult given the confused and superficial notions on the 'disease' that's hitherto been done in film and the arts at large.)",3,"Grainy, Kaleidoescopic Film on Schizophrenia",1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,1274,"['film', 'disjointedness', 'wonderfully', 'suggestive', 'running', 'gamut', 'horrifying-', 'surreal', 'humorous', 'beautiful', 'actor', 'playing', 'Julien', 'Donkeyboy', 'spent', 'time', 'director', 'Korine', 'uncle', 'schizophrenic', 'most', 'impressive', 'convincing', 'portrayal', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'truly', 'annoying', 'chattering', 'innocence', 'schizophrenic', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally', 'violent', 'outbursts', 'stream', 'conscious', 'Morris', 'Code', 'mutterings', 'own', 'psychological', 'motives', 'real', 'schizophrenics', 'so', 'threatening', 'terrorizing', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'jokes', 'directorial', 'legacy', 'expense', 'achieving', 'levels', 'hyperbole', 'exceed', 'even', 'what', 'top', 'notch', 'mockumentary', 'Incident', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Korine', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'accordance', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'penned', 'Dogma95', 'Manifesto', 'reading', 'will', 'probably', 'help', 'put', 'film', 'context', 'potential', 'viewers.Three', 'stars', 'difficulty', 'content', 'audiences', 'large', 'personally', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'being', 'successful', 'achieving', 'aims', 'being', 'innovative', 'using', 'such', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'given', 'confused', 'superficial', 'notions', ""'disease"", 'hitherto', 'been', 'done', 'film', 'arts', 'large']",N/A

572811,ATWK744FUQXVX,B000059HA5,Crowsdreamofdeth,"[6, 17]","I don't have much to say about this film other than that it is extremely bizarre, disjointed, mostly incoherent, and surreal. At times its almost as if it was filmed in the attempt to show the world through a skitzophrenic's eyes. Werner Herzog plays this creepy, gas mask wearing lisping father who tries to pay his son ten dollars to dress up like his dead mother and dance with him. That, for me, was the highlight of the entire movie. The rest of the film is difficult to pay attention to as the camera follows Julien throughout his day as he goes to work as an aid to blind people (watch out for the blind black albino), goes ice skating,pretends an almost completely incoherent conversation between Hitler and God, wrestles with a brother that is almost pathologically obsessed with ""winning"" because of a father who constantly degrades him by treating him like a loser, and spirals further and further into madness. Although, ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" seems to be plotless during the first ten to twenty minutes of this strange film, it certainly follows a linear story, but is sowildly disjointed and interspersed with so many random camera tricks and surreal scenes that I found myself beginning to daydream throughout the duration of the movie.

It then took almost 2 years to get to home video.  I think this is an amazing film.  Like Gummo, the plot of the film is unimportant.  If you tell people what it is, they'll misunderstand it.  The way the story is told here is what is most important.  Korine is one of the few independent filmmakers out there that is truly independent, in that his films are not for the mainstream.  There is no crossover appeal in julien donkey-boy (or Gummo), and Korine is not interested in it anyway.  This film feels like a poem, or a piece of music, in which the feeling is most important, not a linear timeline.  The whole here is greater than the parts, as opposed to most films, in which there are (sometimes) great setpieces in them, but as a film they're quite often uneven and disjointed.

While compelled to take in the effects of schizophrenia on your average dysfunctional family, the video effects make ordinary scenes a torture to sit through.

572816,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000059HA5,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","Harmony Korine's ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" takes a break from the shocking vulgarity that was portrayed in the last film he wrote & directed ""Gummo""and the first film that he wrote ""Kids"". Both of those films, while Gummo still tends to turn people off, are masterpieces in the sense that they are both disturbing, true, and important. ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" gives us, basically, a tour into the mind of a schizophrenic boy named Julien. But, how do you sum up this movie with a proper synopsis? Well, first off...This movie could've taken a lot of different directions and it's clear what Korine's goal was in making the film. Having said that, I understand why the cinematography is so screwed up. I mean, this is the grainiest movie you'll ever see and while I appreciate that use of cinematography in several films, it wasn't used through the entire movie. There are times when you can barely see the characters face as a result of it. But, as I said, I know that was the point...I just wanted to mention how annoying it can be. The movie's plot is kind of ""eh."" Because, it seems that Korine wanted to tell the story in a way that Julien would see it. It won't always make sense. In the middle of the movie, Julien makes a call to what seems to be his sister Pearl (Chloe Sevigny) and confused the hell out of me. I realized Korine would probably provide closure at the end and he kind of did...But not quite. Before I give you my hack-eyed view of the plot, I will say that this movie did work on a number of levels. Korine did justice to the character, the operatic score is very good, and the performances are powerful and sometimes a little too real. But some of the most impressive parts of the movie, don't even really have to do with the movie. Seeing an armless man play drums with his feet, seeing an Albino black man freestyle, it was pretty trippy s**t. Anyways, the plot is basically this...Julien (Ewen Bremner, who is so good it's amazing he's not really like this) is a schizophrenic boy who lives with his pregnant sister Pearl, his brother Chris, and his abusive father. When the movie does take place in the house, we see Julien trying to fit in and notice that Pearl is the only one who's nice to him. His father puts down everyone in the house for one thing or another, Chris could've been erased from the movie and it would still be the same. Anyways, that's about all I can say on the plot...But, I would recommend you not buy this movie before having seen it. If you have a big appreciation for films and for filmmaking, then you should at least enjoy this movie a little bit. There are some really powerful elements to it, especially in the final scene. It's not a masterpiece and there are several things Korine could've done to make it better, but in it's own odd way ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" is a haunting portrait that doesn't try to make anything look nicer than it really is.GRADE: B-",4,JulienDonkey-Boy,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,2905,"['Harmony', 'Korine', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'break', 'shocking', 'vulgarity', 'was', 'portrayed', 'last', 'film', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Gummo', 'first', 'film', 'wrote', 'Kids', 'films', 'Gummo', 'still', 'turn', 'people', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'sense', 'are', 'disturbing', 'true', 'important', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'basically', 'tour', 'mind', 'schizophrenic', 'boy', 'named', 'Julien', 'how', 'do', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'proper', 'synopsis', 'Well', 'first', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'lot', 'different', 'directions', 'clear', 'what', 'Korine', 'goal', 'was', 'making', 'film', 'Having', 'said', 'understand', 'why', 'cinematography', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'mean', 'grainiest', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'appreciate', 'use', 'cinematography', 'several', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'can', 'barely', 'see', 'characters', 'face', 'result', 'said', 'know', 'was', 'point', 'just', 'wanted', 'mention', 'how', 'annoying', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'plot', 'kind', 'eh', 'Korine', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'way', 'Julien', 'would', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'middle', 'movie', 'Julien', 'call', 'what', 'be', 'sister', 'Pearl', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'confused', 'hell', 'realized', 'Korine', 'would', 'probably', 'provide', 'closure', 'end', 'kind', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'give', 'hack-eyed', 'view', 'plot', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'did', 'work', 'number', 'levels', 'Korine', 'did', 'justice', 'character', 'operatic', 'score', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'are', 'powerful', 'little', 'too', 'real', 'most', 'impressive', 'parts', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'have', 'do', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'armless', 'man', 'play', 'drums', 'feet', 'seeing', 'Albino', 'black', 'man', 'freestyle', 'was', 'pretty', 'trippy', 's**t.', 'Anyways', 'plot', 'basically', 'Julien', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'amazing', 'not', 'really', 'schizophrenic', 'boy', 'who', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'Pearl', 'brother', 'Chris', 'abusive', 'father', 'When', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'house', 'see', 'Julien', 'trying', 'fit', 'notice', 'Pearl', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'nice', 'father', 'down', 'everyone', 'house', 'one', 'thing', 'Chris', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'erased', 'movie', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'Anyways', 'can', 'say', 'plot', 'would', 'recommend', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'having', 'seen', 'have', 'big', 'appreciation', 'films', 'filmmaking', 'then', 'should', 'least', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'are', 'really', 'powerful', 'elements', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'Korine', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'make', 'better', 'own', 'odd', 'way', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'haunting', 'portrait', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'anything', 'look', 'really', 'B-']",N/A

As with all of Korine's movies, it's just a slice of the life of a very, very odd individual, in this case Julien (Alien vs. Predator's Ewen Bremner), a teenager with an ocean of emotional problems, the main one being schizophrenia. We follow him, along with the various other members of his family--father (Werner Herzog), brother Chris (Evan Neumann), and pregnant sister Pearl (Korine regular Chloe Sevigny)--as they go through their lives.The truly great part of this movie is the minor characters, who are often compelling (more so at times than the principals). As one of the emotionally disturbed, Julien wanders through a number of support groups, and the people he encounters there are fascinating. A number of them could have done with a bit more face time, but we end up seeing much more of the interactions between Julien and his family members, which aren't especially interesting most of the time. There are exceptions, of course, but many of the family scenes slide quickly into the tableau of crazy Julien, disappointed father, embarrassed brother, and sympathetic sister. Korine does attempt (or so I gather from the copy on the back of the DVD case) to introduce a plot with the opening scene, in which Julien kills a playmate, but nothing but the occasional reference in passing is ever made to the scene, and it never even approaches resolution.This is not to say that the family scenes are devoid of worth; a number of them are as effective as anything else in the film (Julien's long phone conversation with his dead mother is particularly good). I just with there'd been more of a balance between the family scenes and the other aspects of Julien's life. ***",3,"Not as good as Gummo-- but then, what is?",1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,1827,"['Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'Harmony', 'Korine', '1999', 'been', 'week', 'saw', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Korine', 'movies', 'just', 'slice', 'life', 'very', 'very', 'odd', 'individual', 'case', 'Julien', 'Alien', 'vs', 'Predator', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'teenager', 'ocean', 'emotional', 'problems', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'schizophrenia', 'follow', 'various', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'father', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'brother', 'Chris', 'Evan', 'Neumann', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'Pearl', 'Korine', 'regular', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'go', 'lives.The', 'truly', 'great', 'part', 'movie', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'compelling', 'more', 'so', 'times', 'principals', 'one', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'Julien', 'wanders', 'number', 'support', 'groups', 'people', 'are', 'fascinating', 'number', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'more', 'face', 'time', 'end', 'up', 'seeing', 'much', 'more', 'interactions', 'Julien', 'family', 'members', 'are', ""n't"", 'especially', 'interesting', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'exceptions', 'course', 'many', 'family', 'scenes', 'slide', 'quickly', 'tableau', 'crazy', 'Julien', 'disappointed', 'father', 'embarrassed', 'brother', 'sympathetic', 'sister', 'Korine', 'attempt', 'so', 'gather', 'copy', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'introduce', 'plot', 'opening', 'scene', 'Julien', 'playmate', 'nothing', 'occasional', 'reference', 'passing', 'ever', 'made', 'scene', 'never', 'even', 'resolution.This', 'not', 'say', 'family', 'scenes', 'are', 'devoid', 'worth', 'number', 'are', 'as', 'effective', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'Julien', 'long', 'phone', 'conversation', 'dead', 'mother', 'particularly', 'good', 'just', ""'d"", 'been', 'more', 'balance', 'family', 'scenes', 'other', 'aspects', 'Julien', 'life', '***']",N/A
572822,APDPA11IZPYLN,B000059HA5,"Sheila Chilcote-Collins ""Sheila Renee Chilcot...","[38, 42]","Flashing a giant mouthful of fake gold teeth that he received as a present, Julien (an almost indescribable Ewen Bremner, better known as &quot;Spud&quot; from Trainspotting) aimlessly and shamelessly wanders the depressing streets of his hometown of Queens in his own little schizophrenic world of make-believe, childish song, and unanswered questions.See and REALLY EXPERIENCE Julien taking a bath, all the while singing and mumbling uncoherently to himself, watch him go to work in Queens as an aide for blind students, see him put on a bra and underwear and wrestle his brother, watch his family go to church, listen and watch him talk to his dead mother on the phone, and finally, watch the breakdown of his damaged & disinegrated pysche as the unthinkable happens to Julien.The film jumps from one weird scene to the next, all in somewhat of a jumble. It is like you are inside of Julien's own schizophrenic mind as times and at others you are just a silent and invisible onlooker.Julien lives in a low to middle class & HIGHLY dysfunctional family with his pregnant, tutu wearing sister, Pearl (Chloe Sevigny), his wanna-be wrestler brother Chris (Evan Neumann), his oblivious to it all, crazy, dog loving grandmother (Joyce Korine, the director's true to life grandmother), and above all, the patriarch of the family... Chris, Julien and Pearl's sadistic, drunken, cough syrup swilling, gas-mask-wearing father(a fabulous Werner Herzog).The story of Julien is based on director Harmony Korine's (&quot;Gummo&quot; & screenwriter of &quot;Kids&quot;) own schizophrenic uncle and the location where the movie was shot is the actual house that his uncle grew up in. Thusly, &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; was made according to the tenets of Dogme 95, the largely European movement based around the &quot;Dogme Vow of Chastity,&quot; which eschews, among many other things, any kind of artificial lighting, costumes or props.The one thing, above all that I find amazing about these types of films like the Dogme 95 group is this filmaking isn't anything &quot;NEW&quot; or &quot;GROUNDBREAKING&quot;. Film makers have been doing these types of movies FOR YEARS and YEARS. The change is that now we as viewers get to see experimental & different genres of films. It's just that with LOTS money and the need for something different to be actually &quot;VIEWED&quot; in this century is what is NEW.&quot;EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN...&quot;The way that the movie is shot is what is so interesting to me. Not the story, plot or cohesiveness, of which there is very little, but the sheer &quot;way&quot; of filming this movie and others like it.Shot entirely with digital video and hidden cameras on the actor's person whilst the non-sequitur &quot;scenes&quot;; like the scene where Pearl is buying secondhand baby clothes, are ALL shot &quot;off the cuff&quot; and true to life. The other people in the scenes weren't even aware that they were being filmed at the time!Post-production, the digital video is slowed down in places and given a herky-jerky home movie/Super 8 quality to it. There are also some beautiful scenes that are given an organic quality with green and gold &quot;washes&quot; over them, such as the scene with Pearl in a field of wheat singing to herself. There are also some very dark scenes that are given a cold quality with purple and blue &quot;washes&quot; to them, like the scenes of Julien playing God and Hitler, and, of course, the tragic ending scene to it all...Is this a film for everyone? Is the story truly &quot;enjoyable&quot;? Of course not. But if you enjoy watching the odd and obscure you will like &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot;Happy Watching!",4,&quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; - Harmony Korine's Dogme 95 Film,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,3685,"['Flashing', 'giant', 'mouthful', 'fake', 'gold', 'teeth', 'received', 'present', 'Julien', 'almost', 'indescribable', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'better', 'known', 'quot', 'Spud', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'aimlessly', 'shamelessly', 'depressing', 'streets', 'hometown', 'Queens', 'own', 'little', 'schizophrenic', 'world', 'make-believe', 'childish', 'song', 'unanswered', 'questions.See', 'REALLY', 'EXPERIENCE', 'Julien', 'taking', 'bath', 'while', 'singing', 'mumbling', 'uncoherently', 'watch', 'go', 'work', 'Queens', 'aide', 'blind', 'students', 'see', 'put', 'bra', 'underwear', 'wrestle', 'brother', 'watch', 'family', 'go', 'church', 'listen', 'watch', 'talk', 'dead', 'mother', 'phone', 'finally', 'watch', 'breakdown', 'damaged', 'disinegrated', 'pysche', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'Julien.The', 'film', 'jumps', 'one', 'weird', 'scene', 'next', 'somewhat', 'jumble', 'are', 'Julien', 'own', 'schizophrenic', 'mind', 'times', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'silent', 'invisible', 'onlooker.Julien', 'lives', 'low', 'middle', 'class', 'HIGHLY', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'pregnant', 'tutu', 'wearing', 'sister', 'Pearl', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'wanna-be', 'wrestler', 'brother', 'Chris', 'Evan', 'Neumann', 'oblivious', 'crazy', 'dog', 'loving', 'grandmother', 'Joyce', 'Korine', 'director', 'true', 'life', 'grandmother', 'patriarch', 'family', 'Chris', 'Julien', 'Pearl', 'sadistic', 'drunken', 'cough', 'syrup', 'swilling', 'gas-mask-wearing', 'father', 'fabulous', 'Werner', 'Herzog', '.The', 'story', 'Julien', 'based', 'director', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'quot', 'Gummo', 'quot', 'screenwriter', 'quot', 'Kids', 'quot', 'own', 'schizophrenic', 'uncle', 'location', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'actual', 'house', 'uncle', 'grew', 'up', 'Thusly', 'quot', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'according', 'tenets', 'Dogme', '95', 'largely', 'European', 'movement', 'based', 'quot', 'Dogme', 'Vow', 'Chastity', 'quot', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'kind', 'artificial', 'lighting', 'costumes', 'props.The', 'one', 'thing', 'find', 'amazing', 'types', 'films', 'Dogme', '95', 'group', 'filmaking', ""n't"", 'anything', 'quot', 'NEW', 'quot', 'quot', 'GROUNDBREAKING', 'quot', 'Film', 'makers', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'types', 'movies', 'FOR', 'YEARS', 'YEARS', 'change', 'now', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'experimental', 'different', 'genres', 'films', 'just', 'LOTS', 'money', 'need', 'something', 'different', 'be', 'actually', 'quot', 'VIEWED', 'quot', 'century', 'what', 'NEW.', 'quot', 'EVERYTHING', 'OLD', 'IS', 'NEW', 'AGAIN', 'quot', 'way', 'movie', 'shot', 'what', 'so', 'interesting', 'Not', 'story', 'plot', 'cohesiveness', 'very', 'little', 'sheer', 'quot', 'way', 'quot', 'filming', 'movie', 'others', 'it.Shot', 'entirely', 'digital', 'video', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'actor', 'person', 'whilst', 'non-sequitur', 'quot', 'scenes', 'quot', 'scene', 'where', 'Pearl', 'buying', 'secondhand', 'baby', 'clothes', 'are', 'ALL', 'shot', 'quot', 'cuff', 'quot', 'true', 'life', 'other', 'people', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'were', 'being', 'filmed', 'time', 'Post-production', 'digital', 'video', 'slowed', 'down', 'places', 'given', 'herky-jerky', 'home', 'movie/Super', '8', 'quality', 'are', 'also', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'are', 'given', 'organic', 'quality', 'green', 'gold', 'quot', 'washes', 'quot', 'such', 'scene', 'Pearl', 'field', 'wheat', 'singing', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'given', 'cold', 'quality', 'purple', 'blue', 'quot', 'washes', 'quot', 'scenes', 'Julien', 'playing', 'God', 'Hitler', 'course', 'tragic', 'ending', 'scene', 'film', 'everyone', 'story', 'truly', 'quot', 'enjoyable', 'quot', 'course', 'not', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'odd', 'obscure', 'will', 'like', 'quot', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'quot', 'Happy', 'Watching']",N/A

Or you did know you had them, you just didn't kow they could be touched and moved by a single cinematic experience. But watching ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" had these feelings of sheer beauty in a world that ain't so beautiful at all. The brilliance of ugliness, the shinging of dead things in back alleys.Harmony Korine, a young maverick filmmaker who is more influenced by the European cinema than of his own country, paints in light and edits in lyric and movement, rather than in logic or rationally motivated choises.The character in the title is a mild mannered schizofrenic young man who lives in an even so disfunctional familiy, run by a grumpy, insulting and millitant father. The narrative isn't really a story but more of a series of domestic and outdoor scenes, that together represent the shattered view of life of the leading character.It's a shattered view of life, but not necessarely a dark one, what you might expect. Korine doesn't go for the cheap tricks when it comes to portrait  a mentally distrurbed person. Korine is a child looking curiously at the weird grown-up people around him, all doing strange and weird grown-up things. And the funny thing is that those actions of those grown-ups do more then once look very much like childish things.The movie isn't all together really about a schizofrenic young man at all; it's more a portrait of low life, and the shattering discovering that low life can also have a heart. Only at the surface it may seem like a freakshow, but underneath there is real blood flowing through real veins.And talk about real and flowing: watch the scene where the pregnant sister (Chlo&#65533; Sevegny) is cutting the hair of her father, outside in the front yard, (the father, played by European movie icon Werner Herzog): The editing is just as wicked as brilliant, with on the soundtrack an old record on which Werner Herzog talks about a talking context for birds.
