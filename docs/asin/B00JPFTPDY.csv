He goes through the grief stages of anger, confusion and desperation before reaching the stage where he can love again.

The production attempts to combine quirky humor with a heart warming tale, but falls short.

Henry leaves angry but quickly changes and tries to make everything right with his family before time runs out. Before I started this I was expecting something along the lines of Falling Down. While it was a little similar this one was different. Robin Williams did a good job in this but it isn't one of his better performances. He did however pull off the hard aspect of making a character that isn't nice to anyone but still had enough heart that you root for him.
