This led to the stars' real-life brief romance. Hal Jackson(Danson) is a truck salesman who is the father of Zora Matthews(Nia Long). Zora's mother(Goldberg) was artificially inseminated when she became pregnant with Zora. When Zora went to the sperm bank,she learned Hal was her father,which means she's half-caucasian. Supporting cast members include Jennifer Tilly,who's Hal's girlfriend and Will Smith,who was then the star of the sitcom The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air. This led to a major film career for former rapper Smith. In the final scene,at Zora's high school graduation,Hal and Zora's mother are embracing and smooching. That reminds fans of TV's The Jeffersons of the sitcom's interracial couple Tom and Helen Willis.",5,A love made in America,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,895,"['Just', 'before', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'began', '11th', 'final', 'season', 'sitcom', 'Cheers', '1992', 'teamed', 'up', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'hysterical', 'somewhat', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'led', 'stars', 'real-life', 'brief', 'romance', 'Hal', 'Jackson', 'Danson', 'truck', 'salesman', 'who', 'father', 'Zora', 'Matthews', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Zora', 'mother', 'Goldberg', 'was', 'artificially', 'inseminated', 'when', 'became', 'pregnant', 'Zora', 'When', 'Zora', 'went', 'sperm', 'bank', 'learned', 'Hal', 'was', 'father', 'half-caucasian', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'who', 'Hal', 'girlfriend', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'star', 'sitcom', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel', 'Air', 'led', 'major', 'film', 'career', 'former', 'rapper', 'Smith', 'final', 'scene', 'Zora', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'Hal', 'Zora', 'mother', 'are', 'embracing', 'smooching', 'fans', 'TV', 'Jeffersons', 'sitcom', 'interracial', 'couple', 'Tom', 'Helen', 'Willis']",N/A

Well, that lightened it up all right. in fact maybe too light.""Made in America"" presented a bizarre case in which a bright and scientifically minded young woman of 18 (Nia Lang) discovered that the blood types of her and her parents are incompatible with her deceased father being the biological parent. Upon quizzing her mother (Whoopi), she found out that the seed was donated at a fertility clinic and set about trying to find out who her real father was. Well, she apparently found out that it's a tall, very white, and flamboyant car dealer (Ted Danson). It didn't fit at all. However, they discovered that the daughter and her newly-discovered father cracked their knuckles in the same way, so that settled it. Well, the movie then dwelled on the turbulent relations between the three until they finally discovered that the whole thing was a clerical error back at the donor clinic. What a mess! But it all ended happily! It's a light, frivolous, feel-good story that made somewhat amusing watching. The acting and photography were fairly good. Boredom was only a minor problem. Relax and enjoy.

Ted Danson plays a self-absorbed, alcoholic, bed-hopping car salesman and wealthy owner of a large car dealership.  Whoopi Goldberg portrays a widowed single mom of a teenage daughter who owns an African-centric shop.Whoopi has given the impression to her daughter that her late husband was her child's father, but when she finds her father's death certificate, she knows that is impossible. Whoopi confesses that in the lonely period after her husband's death, she resorted to sperm donation.With the help of her boyfriend (hilariously played by Will Smith), she breaks into the sperm bank's computer records to find the identity of her father and lo and behold - it's Ted Danson.She's a little shocked and when she reveals her findings to her mother, her mother is horrified. When Ted Danson's character is confronted with the news, his life takes a 180. He now has responsibilities as a father, even though he was told that his sperm would only be used for research when he donated several years earlier.  He now has something to live for and finds that he can actually like himself and he finds himself loving the child he never knew. He stops bed-hopping and drinking and finds himself focusing on catching up on his daughter's life.There are some ridiculous scenes in this movie and some very cheesy, over-acted parts, but as a whole, it is an entertaining and enjoyable experience. There are a few scenes that will put a lump in your throat and others that will have you doubled-over with laughter... and in the end, you feel you're a part of this mixed-heritage family.",3,"Sweet, funny and sometimes silly",1028764800,"08 8, 2002",2002,1640,"['Definitely', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'world', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'self-absorbed', 'alcoholic', 'bed-hopping', 'car', 'salesman', 'wealthy', 'owner', 'large', 'car', 'dealership', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'widowed', 'single', 'mom', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'African-centric', 'shop.Whoopi', 'given', 'impression', 'daughter', 'late', 'husband', 'was', 'child', 'father', 'when', 'father', 'death', 'certificate', 'impossible', 'Whoopi', 'lonely', 'period', 'husband', 'death', 'resorted', 'sperm', 'donation.With', 'help', 'boyfriend', 'hilariously', 'played', 'Will', 'Smith', 'sperm', 'bank', 'computer', 'records', 'find', 'identity', 'father', 'lo', 'behold', 'Ted', 'Danson.She', 'little', 'shocked', 'when', 'findings', 'mother', 'mother', 'horrified', 'When', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'character', 'confronted', 'news', 'life', '180', 'now', 'responsibilities', 'father', 'even', 'was', 'told', 'sperm', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'research', 'when', 'donated', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'now', 'something', 'live', 'can', 'actually', 'like', 'loving', 'child', 'never', 'knew', 'bed-hopping', 'drinking', 'focusing', 'catching', 'up', 'daughter', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'movie', 'very', 'cheesy', 'over-acted', 'parts', 'whole', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'will', 'put', 'lump', 'throat', 'others', 'will', 'have', 'doubled-over', 'laughter', 'end', 'feel', ""'re"", 'part', 'mixed-heritage', 'family']",N/A
