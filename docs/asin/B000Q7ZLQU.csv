1074630,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B000Q7ZLQU,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[3, 4]","It is great to see Barbie returning to the musical format. Much of the plot of the movie might be trite, but the format is clever, and there is a great deal of appeal in these for adults and children. My 4 and 5 year old girls really enjoyed the film, and I loved the music.The basic story is that a young girl is washed up on an isolated island. She grows up with animals and learns to speak `animal' so she can communicate with them like we would with each other. The island is visited by a Prince who is rescued by Ro and then takes her back to his land (with her animal friends of course), she wants to find out where she comes from (a great song accompanies this!) However once there Prince Antonio finds that he has been betrothed to a princess from a neighbouring kingdom. Unbeknownst to them all, the mother of the Princess has a score to settle with Prince Antonio's father, King Peter, and intends to exact revenge on them all once the wedding has happened. Ro gets dressed for the royal ball, (another fabulous song!) but feels out of place there. Ro, realizing she is out of place wants to go back to her own island. Prince Antonio is forced to give her up and she gets put on a boat, but is betrayed and nearly dies when she is knocked into the water. She manages to survive by calling the dolphins. Making her way back to land she rescues everyone from the evil queen discovers what she needs to know about herself  and marries prince Antonio (of course) - the final song is just amazing.The colours of Barbie movies are incredibly bright, and this is no exception, perhaps a bit too bright, but it does set them apartThe animators of these movies are clearly developing with each movie, and the animation is in this is really very good. We see greater range of movement depicted in this than in any other movie and the characters manage to move in fairly realistic form. I like the way the camera plays at different angles making it feel much more like modern film-making (the scene when Ro is in the ballroom talking to Prince Antonio is a case in point) but also when Prince Antonio jumps off the moving carriage to rescue the girl knocked off the bridge - very smart and `die hard' action style scene - most impressive!My only real dislike in this movie is the animals - the Red panda, Saj is fine, but the Elephant (Tika) and the Monkey, Tallulah are just plain freaky. Tallulah really scared my children she looks almost human but in a totally unnatural way. Please a little more realism there!The Music is just extraordinary. These are great sing-along style songs. There are some which are incredibly witty in almost Cole Porter style - the song about getting dressed for the ball is a case in point - smart, sassy and snappy lyrics. The music for it has great harmonys and style. It might be trite at times, but it is great to sing along with and we have been using the Karaoke section to learn them (great idea thanks!)The various comments in other reviews about Tika the Elephants' nightmares. This isn't absolutely obvious, but Tika is scared of being left alone, of Ro leaving her. She expresses this when they leave the island, and again on the boat when she admits to hiding Prince Antonio's note from Ro. The ending shows that she has come to terms with this.Anyway, there are some drawbacks to the movie, holes in the plot you could drive an elephant through. On the other hand, there are things in here such as the music which take the movie up to a new level. This is overall a great movie and gets a 5 out of 5 easily from my family.",5,"magical musical, witty, funny and bright",1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,3567,"['great', 'see', 'Barbie', 'returning', 'musical', 'format', 'Much', 'plot', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'trite', 'format', 'clever', 'great', 'deal', 'appeal', 'adults', 'children', '4', '5', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'loved', 'music.The', 'basic', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'washed', 'up', 'isolated', 'island', 'up', 'animals', 'learns', 'speak', 'animal', 'can', 'communicate', 'would', 'other', 'island', 'visited', 'Prince', 'who', 'rescued', 'Ro', 'then', 'back', 'land', 'animal', 'friends', 'course', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'great', 'song', 'However', 'once', 'Prince', 'Antonio', 'been', 'betrothed', 'princess', 'neighbouring', 'kingdom', 'Unbeknownst', 'mother', 'Princess', 'score', 'settle', 'Prince', 'Antonio', 'father', 'King', 'Peter', 'exact', 'revenge', 'once', 'wedding', 'happened', 'Ro', 'dressed', 'royal', 'ball', 'fabulous', 'song', 'place', 'there', 'Ro', 'realizing', 'place', 'go', 'back', 'own', 'island', 'Prince', 'Antonio', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'put', 'boat', 'betrayed', 'nearly', 'dies', 'when', 'knocked', 'water', 'survive', 'calling', 'dolphins', 'Making', 'way', 'back', 'land', 'rescues', 'everyone', 'evil', 'queen', 'discovers', 'what', 'know', 'marries', 'prince', 'Antonio', 'course', 'final', 'song', 'just', 'amazing.The', 'colours', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'are', 'incredibly', 'bright', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'bright', 'set', 'apartThe', 'animators', 'movies', 'are', 'clearly', 'developing', 'movie', 'animation', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'see', 'greater', 'range', 'movement', 'depicted', 'other', 'movie', 'characters', 'manage', 'move', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'form', 'way', 'camera', 'different', 'angles', 'making', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'film-making', 'scene', 'when', 'Ro', 'ballroom', 'talking', 'Prince', 'Antonio', 'case', 'point', 'also', 'when', 'Prince', 'Antonio', 'moving', 'carriage', 'rescue', 'girl', 'knocked', 'off', 'bridge', 'very', 'smart', 'die', 'hard', 'action', 'style', 'scene', 'most', 'impressive', 'only', 'real', 'dislike', 'movie', 'animals', 'Red', 'panda', 'Saj', 'fine', 'Elephant', 'Tika', 'Monkey', 'Tallulah', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'freaky', 'Tallulah', 'really', 'scared', 'children', 'almost', 'human', 'totally', 'unnatural', 'way', 'Please', 'little', 'more', 'realism', 'there', 'Music', 'just', 'extraordinary', 'are', 'great', 'sing-along', 'style', 'songs', 'are', 'are', 'incredibly', 'witty', 'almost', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'style', 'song', 'getting', 'dressed', 'ball', 'case', 'point', 'smart', 'sassy', 'snappy', 'lyrics', 'music', 'great', 'harmonys', 'style', 'might', 'be', 'trite', 'times', 'great', 'sing', 'along', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'Karaoke', 'section', 'learn', 'great', 'idea', 'thanks', 'various', 'comments', 'other', 'reviews', 'Tika', 'Elephants', 'nightmares', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'obvious', 'Tika', 'scared', 'being', 'left', 'alone', 'Ro', 'leaving', 'when', 'leave', 'island', 'again', 'boat', 'when', 'hiding', 'Prince', 'Antonio', 'note', 'Ro', 'ending', 'shows', 'come', 'terms', 'this.Anyway', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'movie', 'holes', 'plot', 'could', 'drive', 'elephant', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'things', 'here', 'such', 'music', 'take', 'movie', 'up', 'new', 'level', 'overall', 'great', 'movie', '5', '5', 'easily', 'family']",Barbie as The Island Princess

I also once heard someone comment that there must be no honor among filmmakers because apparently nobody in a high-budget production cared that the movie made was terrible.  Well, I have to say, this movie is yet another shining example of the Barbie movies' integrity.They could get away with SO much--they don't NEED to put a plot or characters or even any kind of acting into this, honestly.  BUT THEY DO.  The reason I pick this movie out of the crop is that (a) it was just released, and (b) it's a great example of the integrity that is so lost among high-end studio productions these days.  Why?  Think--what movie is similar to this?  Can you think of any parallels?  Especially in the Disney array?  It's a movie with striking similarities to the Little Mermaid.BUT, instead of making the heroine a selfish brat and saving it with appealing sidekicks and great music, the characters themselves are likable (or hate-able) and they DON'T have to make the person trying to marry the prince a creepy person either.  It's so great!  The music, as in the Princess and the Pauper, is shockingly good; the animation and visuals just keep getting better and better; and the storytelling and character development are far above the par of the so-called ""best"" of Hollywood today.If you have already started collecting the Barbie movies, get this one too.  If not, start right now! Little girls and you(!) will ACTUALLY enjoy them together.  This is a worthwhile movie to see, as are the other Barbie movies.

Much like her Princess and the Pauper days we not only see Barbie dance on her island but sing!All her animal friends as always have a ton of mascara on with long eyelashes..must be that type Queen Latifa always be talking about!There is an evil gold digger mother who sings about marrying the ""oldest king she could find"" and then he died the next day leaving the kingdom to her and how she wants her daughter to forget about ""those other clowns"" and concentrate on ""boys with crowns"". She not only drugs all the animals in the kingdom using a Lunesta or Valium type drug called ""sunset herb"" but manages to also hijack a carriage and almost run over three maidens causing one of them to almost fall of a cliff!Next Barbie's elephant is very odd..she is obsessed with Barbie to the point of destroying a romantic letter the Prince left for Barbie and finally when she confesses to it she says things like ""what about us"" and ""if you married the prince then you would not love me"". The elephant even wants to follow them on their honeymoon saying ""maybe we can stowaway"". I think the elephant is a lesbian. She just acted strange throughout the whole movie like looking at herself in the waters reflection and having nightmares?Barbie looks really pretty in this movie, in Fairytopia her face looked older. I even thought her bitchy mermaid friend Nori was better looking.One thing though..she did need some lipstick in this movie..I mean the animals wore more makeup than her..Of course there is a very touching moment at the end and not to mention great songs, romance and laughs along the way.
