The youngster playing Addie avoids the fatal cuteness that afflicts many child actors, and delineates a character of both gumption and vulnerability. Who can not smile over the way she conceals a crush on a school mate by claiming all she admires about him are his new cowboy boots? Jason Robards Jr. is just as good here as he was in a ""Thousand Clowns,"" and his taciturnity does not prevent our more than once glimpsing into his broken heart.And Mildred Natwick! What a treasure she was. It is her performance you may savor most of all, a woman of love and compassion, but one firmly grounded by the limitations of this life, who has that seasoning, that sense of recollection that the years bring to the best of us, and which is known as wisdom.And a special accolade to the young actress playing the schoolteacher, who also contributes a memorable job, (and who also does the voice over during the prologue it sounds like).The production design team does excellent work here, and is to be commended on snowy mid-Western exterior locations which beautifully match the school and domestic interiors, (with hook rugs, Eastlake settees,  cabinet radios and an engraving of Millais' ""The Angelus"") which will bring back warm memories of all those who shared in that place and time.This is family entertainment in the best sense--genuinely moving without an ounce of schmaltz.",5,A gem--don't miss it.,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,2551,"['quiet', 'dignity', 'here', 'missing', 'many', 'Christmas', 'programs', 'dignity', 'bolstered', 'superb', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'mid', 'west', 'Christmas', '1946', 'time', 'America', 'self', 'sufficiency', 'time', 'when', 'body', 'politic', 'did', 'not', 'blame', 'government', 'natural', 'disasters', 'acts', 'God', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'still', 'presumably', 'were', 'able', 'save', 'six', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'limited', 'income.The', 'domestic', 'focus', 'here', '10', 'year', 'old', 'bespectacled', 'girl', 'named', 'Addie', 'who', 'widowed', 'father', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'amply', 'not', 'only', 'characteristics', 'small', 'pleasures', 'can', 'dwarf', 'expensive', 'pleasures', 'day', 'time', 'extra', 'quarter', 'movies', 'sewing', 'one', 'own', 'costume', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'baking', 'cookies', 'buying', 'gift', 'schoolteacher', 'local', 'pharmacy', 'most', 'importantly', 'erecting', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'celebrate', 'birth', 'Christ', 'child.What', 'refreshing', 'here', 'refusal', 'script', 'sugar', 'coat', 'undeniable', 'sadness', 'man', 'bereft', 'deceased', 'wife', 'pall', 'entire', 'household', 'stories', 'subtext', 'principal', 'conflict.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'youngster', 'playing', 'Addie', 'fatal', 'cuteness', 'many', 'child', 'actors', 'character', 'gumption', 'vulnerability', 'Who', 'can', 'not', 'smile', 'way', 'crush', 'school', 'mate', 'claiming', 'are', 'new', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Jr.', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'Thousand', 'Clowns', 'taciturnity', 'not', 'prevent', 'more', 'once', 'glimpsing', 'broken', 'heart.And', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'What', 'treasure', 'was', 'performance', 'may', 'savor', 'most', 'woman', 'love', 'compassion', 'one', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'limitations', 'life', 'who', 'seasoning', 'sense', 'recollection', 'years', 'bring', 'best', 'known', 'wisdom.And', 'special', 'accolade', 'young', 'actress', 'playing', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'also', 'memorable', 'job', 'who', 'also', 'voice', 'prologue', '.The', 'production', 'design', 'team', 'excellent', 'work', 'here', 'be', 'commended', 'snowy', 'mid-Western', 'exterior', 'locations', 'beautifully', 'match', 'school', 'domestic', 'interiors', 'hook', 'rugs', 'Eastlake', 'settees', 'cabinet', 'radios', 'engraving', 'Millais', 'Angelus', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'warm', 'memories', 'who', 'shared', 'place', 'time.This', 'family', 'entertainment', 'best', 'sense', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'ounce', 'schmaltz']",N/A

299022,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6302168414,Classic film buff,"[2, 2]","Along with ""The Homecoming"", this is my favorite Christmas television drama. I didn't catch it the when it debuted in December 1972, but my mother gave it a glowing review, and when it was rerun next year I make a point of watching it.  Right away, I could appreciate its worth, and it's overall excellence.  For the next few years it made an annual appearance during the holiday season, and also was so successful in the ratings that in the following three years, there was a Thanksgiving, Easter and Valentine's Day special.  While all were good, this first was the most memorable.Addie Mills (Lisa Lucus) is a ten-year-old girl who lives in the tiny, rural town of Clear River, Nebraska with her widower father James (Jason Robards) and his widowed mother (Mildred Natwick).  Addie's mother died of pneumonia a few months after Addie's birth, and James has never gotten over it.  This has colored his relationship with Addie, although he loves her, he is distant and withdrawn most of the time.  Addie gets most of her affection and nurturing from her warm hearted Grandma.  It's the Christmas season 1946, and what Addie wants most in the world  for Christmas is something her father has never allowed, their very own Christmas tree.  He uses the excuse that since they spend Christmas Day with their other relatives, a tree isn't necessary and would be a waste of money.  James is careful with his cash.  However Addie is a bright, energetic young lady who is determined to succeed this year.  She does, but it causes a family explosion from her infuriated father, that reveals the true reason why James has never allowed a Christmas tree in their home.It's beautifully executed on all levels, and touches the heart, beginning with three stellar performances.  This teledrama introduced Lisa Lucas as Addie Mills, and she delivers a flawless performance.  The bespectacled, plain-featured Addie is not the run of the mill adorable moppet.  She's independent, feisty, outspoken and intelligent.  Already she has a clearly defined career goal, to be a famous artist and travel to Paris, and has no thoughts of marriage and motherhood.  Ms. Lucas is a natural, she treads a delicate balance, Addie is extremely self confident, and can tend to be sometimes a trifle bossy and outspoken, but in Ms. Lucas nuanced portrayal, you can see the vulnerability, wistfulness and yearning for her father's love.  The best compliment I can give is that she more than holds her own with two seasoned, exceptional actors.  The dark, haunted eyes of Jason Robards as James Mills shows the private internal grief and lonliness of this morose man who so misses his wife.  To his credit, Robards is such a great actor that he can etch sharply this character who at times can be harsh and stern and yet not lose the audience sympathy.  The third outstanding performance is the marvelous character actress Mildred Natwick as Grandma Mills, who is the warm, loving, cozy grandmother anyone would be lucky to have.  She is the heart and soul of the Mills household smoothing the troubled waters of the Addie/James relationship, and helping explain and try to bring understanding of each to the other.  Ms. Natwick is simply wonderful. In smaller roles Alexa Kenin as Addie's best friend Carla Mae, and Kathryn Walker, who briefly was the second Mrs. James Taylor, as their schoolteacher Miss Thompson provide fine support.The story is touching in it's simplicity, the script by Eleanor Perry was an Emmy winner.  The drama was videotaped not filmed, and it works to the advantage, the viewer feels as if they are right there an invisible onlooker in the Mills home.  Not a lot of dollars were used in the budget, but the love and care are evident from all the participants.  The settings and costumes are true to the time and place, a small town in the American heartland in 1946, where the nascent postwar boom and prosperity hasn't hit as yet.  There is a nostalgia factor for the feeling of community that seems to be missing these days, all the people in this little town of Clear River all know one another, and care for one another.  For example, when Addie and her friends go Christmas shopping for their teacher at the local drugstore, they are short on funds for the perfect present, the pharmacist who knows them all kindly marks the item down so they can afford it.One of the main reasons I like the film is that it touches on one of the true meanings of Christmas, besides celebrating the birth of the Christ Child, it is also a celebration of family and the love we share as members of our families.  Although he has trouble expressing it, James does love Addie and it will touch and warm your heart as they come to the realization and understanding of it.The character of Addie Mills as personified by Lisa Lucas in the specials, and as written in the books they were based upon by Gail Rock is a wonderful role model for young girls.  She is her own person, not afraid to express her individuality and march to a different drummer.  She has a firm resolution to be an artist and live in the city, and though this is scoffed it by her father and others, she isn't swayed.  We find out right at the beginning in the prologue narration by the grown Addie that she is an artist and lives in the city, it's encouraging to young females that she realized her dream.There are no extras on the DVD regrettably, but I'm delighted it finally made it to DVD.  Three of the four Addie Mills specials made it to VHS, ""The House..."",""The Holiday(Thanksgiving) Treasure"", and ""The Easter Promise"", I have them all and highly recommend them all.  I'm hoping the last two will make it to DVD as well, and certainly if you liked these, by all means read Gail Rock's books upon which they were based.",5,"""...but I know we were both thinking of that

Some linger wistfully through the decades of your life, and this little movie is one of those special movies for me.  The House Without a Christmas Tree is a story about a little girl named Addie Mills, played wonderfully by child actress Lisa Lucas (WONDERFUL TO READ YOUR POST HERE, MS. LUCAS!!).  Addie lives with her grandmother and embittered father, played with heartbreaking perfection by Jason Robards.  When Addie brings home a beautiful Christmas tree against her father's wishes, it sets off a volcano of emotions within each of them, most deeply felt by her widowed dad, who so terribly misses his wife that he dreads just the thought of a celebration without her.  The characters are comfortable together, the quaint town and genuine feel of small-town love and brotherhood is enough to bring a tear to your eye when you consider how the simple pleasures of days gone by are so often missed in today's hustle and bustle of life.  First aired in 1972, this movie takes place in the late 1940's in Nebraska but will touch chords in people from all generations coast to coast.

I believe it is not considered a Christmas classic because it was shot on video rather than film, and because of this, it has the look and feel of a daytime soap. But the feelings inspired by this film, as well as the first-rate acting, especially from the 3 leads, (Lisa Lucas, jason Robards, and Mildred Natwick) are incredible, and this movie has a powerful effect on me to this day.  This is a perfect film, yet, it is never shown on TV any longer.Year after year, this program aired on CBS, especially in the 1970's.  My sister and I adored this film, and I still try to get anyone to watch it. It is nostalgic, and the set decoration, as well as the immediacy and realism of the characters are well-crafted.  I'm not sure if actor Lisa Lucas still reads reviews on Amazon.com, but she should realize what a powerful performance she gave as the young Addie Mills. There is nothing overtly sentimental in anyone's performance, and director Paul Bogart created a memorable film in the television medium format.

I have been so worried about my VHS copy deteriorating.I wish I could give this story an even higher rating than a mere five stars! It is 1946 in the small town of Clear River, Nebraska, and Addie Mills, the lively, intelligent and artistic daughter of widower James Mills, who is being raised by her grandmother because her mother died shortly after she was born, once again broaches the idea of having a Christmas tree. Her father, who has remained withdrawn and embittered in the long years since her mother's death, as always fobs her off. Then Addie wins the classroom Christmas tree and takes it home...This wonderful story was filmed and first broadcast in 1972 and shown on CBS. It was produced on videotape, which takes away a bit of the magic. However, it also makes you feel as if you are eavesdropping on this family, as if they were participants in a reality series. Lisa Lucas is splendid as the articulate Addie and Mildred Natwick is a charming grandma, but major kudos go to Jason Robards in the role of Addie's father. He could have been portrayed as a soulless tyrant but is revealed to be a desperately grieving and unhappy man instead.The ""look"" of this special contributes to its appeal; the clothing, the sets, the classroom situation all makes you feel as if you are truly back in 1946. Paramount Video needs to release the three sequels as well; THANKSGIVING TREASURE is particularly good, and the fourth story, ADDIE AND THE KING OF HEARTS, has never been released to video at all.

I hadn't seen it since its release in 1972, but I never forgot it.

Addie finally succeeds in cracking his reserve when she gives away the the Christmas tree she has won despite so desperately craving it, and which he just as desperately opposes because it, too, reminds him of Addie's mother.WARNING: This production doesn't contain rap music, politically correct platitudes, references to substance abuse, social commentary, or excretory functions, so if your idea of entertainment requires such content, look elsewhere.

It's a story of a widower living with his daughter and his mother.  His relationship with his daughter is deeply disconnected(for lack of a better word).  The father (played wonderfully by Jason Robards) lost his wife to pneumonia but he takes his loss out on his daughter.  He blames the death of his wife on the birth of Addie (the daughter).  He claims that the birth of the baby weakened her.  ""Why couldn't the baby die instead of her"" he questions.Addie tries to please her dad but keeps missing the mark.  She knows nothing of her mother because her dad doesn't speak of her and refuses to have anything in the house that reminds him of his dead wife.  Hence, his refusal to get Addie a Christmas tree.  His mother tries to make him understand that Addie needs his love, not just a roof over her head and food to eat.This little drama is well acted  and touches the heart. No doubt some folks grew up in a house that looked very much like the home set in this video.  How often have people baked Christmas cookies for others because it's all they could do?

I know it repeated randomly, but I probably only saw it several years later.  Obviously being an older child, I understood much more, and could relate to so much of what was going on.  I still remember the feeling of not being the only one.I remember the look of the way it was filmed, apparently on video.  Therefore a TV special, but it felt like it was live and really happening.  It is certainly something that should be seen as a play.  But what a thrill to have this DVD catch my eye a couple years back.  I could not believe it.  Never would I imagine this type of show be available.  I bought several copies, actually all that I could find that day, as I was sure I would never see it again.

The film has a play-like feel to it, but don't let this discourage you, because it is a truly beautiful film that is filled with poignant moments, life lessons, and performances that will warm your heart.Lisa Lucas plays ten-year-old motherless Addie Mills, who lives with her loving grandmother (Mildred Natwick) and her father, Jamie (Jason Robards) in 1946 Nebraska. Lisa craves her father's approval, but above all, craves his love and attention, and desperately yearns for a Christmas tree, something she has never had in all her years growing up. Her father Jamie is a taciturn man who is kind enough but remains distant from his daughter. When Lisa's efforts to have a Christmas tree in their home keeps getting rebuffed, the desperate girl uses her imagination and talents to realize her simple wish, with results that bring the true meaning of Christmas to light.The acting by the cast members are so real and I for one related to this film on a personal level because the role of Jamie as played by Jason Robards was so much like my own father. The life lessons portrayed in this film make it a Christmas classic that should be watched by the present generation of youngsters who seem to take so much for granted. My young daughter and I had a lively discussion at the movie's conclusion about the true spirit of Christmas, and of how important it is to be compassionate, grateful, and kind to others. Christmas is after all, not about receiving, but about giving - in love, faith, and compassionate acts. A timeless classic, I am happy to add this title to our home library collection of Christmas films.",5,A heartwarming Christmas story,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,1940,"['8.5-year-old', 'have', 'annual', 'tradition', 'started', 'was', 'about', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'watch', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'then', 'discuss', 'films', '34', 'House', 'Christmas', 'Tree', '34', 'something', 'only', 'discovered', 'year', 'considering', 'was', 'filmed', 'back', '1972', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'film', 'play-like', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'discourage', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'filled', 'poignant', 'moments', 'life', 'lessons', 'performances', 'will', 'warm', 'heart.Lisa', 'Lucas', 'ten-year-old', 'motherless', 'Addie', 'Mills', 'who', 'loving', 'grandmother', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'father', 'Jamie', 'Jason', 'Robards', '1946', 'Nebraska', 'Lisa', 'father', 'approval', 'love', 'attention', 'desperately', 'yearns', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'something', 'never', 'had', 'years', 'growing', 'up', 'father', 'Jamie', 'taciturn', 'man', 'who', 'kind', 'enough', 'distant', 'daughter', 'When', 'Lisa', 'efforts', 'have', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'home', 'keeps', 'getting', 'rebuffed', 'desperate', 'girl', 'imagination', 'talents', 'realize', 'simple', 'wish', 'results', 'bring', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'light.The', 'acting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'one', 'related', 'film', 'personal', 'level', 'role', 'Jamie', 'played', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'father', 'life', 'lessons', 'portrayed', 'film', 'make', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'present', 'generation', 'youngsters', 'who', 'seem', 'take', 'so', 'much', 'granted', 'young', 'daughter', 'had', 'lively', 'discussion', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'true', 'spirit', 'Christmas', 'how', 'important', 'be', 'compassionate', 'grateful', 'kind', 'others', 'Christmas', 'not', 'receiving', 'giving', 'love', 'faith', 'compassionate', 'acts', 'timeless', 'classic', 'am', 'happy', 'add', 'title', 'home', 'library', 'collection', 'Christmas', 'films']",N/A
