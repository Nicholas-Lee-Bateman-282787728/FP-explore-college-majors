Oh yeah, this one is eight dollars less than the other one!So, I get them and they're the typical 1.33:1, and then when I put this DVD in a computer a baffling screen comes up that says ""PLAY ALL EPISODES"" without the little selection boxes to the left, which would have changed the meaning to ""PLAY ALL"" or ""EPISODES"".  This happens in both my Dell installed DVD player and in Windows Media Player.  I seems they didn't test the menus to see that they stayed consistent between computers and consumer electronic DVD players.Now I put it in the DVD player, and find that my son has seen all the episodes except the last one, ""Whatshisname"".  We get into the second EPISODES screen and click on ""Whatshisname"" and ""Down on the Farm"" comes up.  I double check it, and it seems that there is an error on the menu screens.  You can only get to ""Whatshisname"" by beginning another episode and hitting chapter skip until you get to ""Whatshisname"".  So there's an amateur mistake that would have been caught had anyone bothered to play test the menus before running off thousands of copies.The bottom line, there's two versions of this out there, and I'd say get the other one.  Rather that reward this kind of incompetence, I'm sending this one back.",1,It's not Aspect Ratio: 1.66:1 and there's a mistake on the menus,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,1614,"['Hey', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'are', 'great', 'DVD', 'was', 'described', 'wrong', 'way', 'influenced', 'purchase', 'decision', 'then', 'found', 'amateur', 'mistake', 'menus.First', 'description', 'wide-screen', '1.66:1', 'was', 'strange', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', ""'d"", 'been', 'made', 'wide', 'screen', 'were', 'would', 'sure', 'be', 'cool', 'so', 'ordered', 'version', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'one', 'eight', 'dollars', 'less', 'other', 'one', 'So', 'get', ""'re"", 'typical', '1.33:1', 'then', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'computer', 'baffling', 'screen', 'up', 'PLAY', 'ALL', 'EPISODES', 'little', 'selection', 'boxes', 'left', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'meaning', 'PLAY', 'EPISODES', 'Dell', 'installed', 'DVD', 'player', 'Windows', 'Media', 'Player', 'did', ""n't"", 'test', 'menus', 'see', 'stayed', 'consistent', 'computers', 'consumer', 'electronic', 'DVD', 'players.Now', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'find', 'son', 'seen', 'episodes', 'last', 'one', 'Whatshisname', 'get', 'second', 'EPISODES', 'screen', 'click', 'Whatshisname', 'Down', 'Farm', 'up', 'double', 'check', 'error', 'menu', 'screens', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'Whatshisname', 'beginning', 'episode', 'hitting', 'chapter', 'skip', 'get', 'Whatshisname', 'amateur', 'mistake', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'had', 'anyone', 'bothered', 'play', 'test', 'menus', 'running', 'off', 'thousands', 'copies.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'two', 'versions', 'there', ""'d"", 'say', 'get', 'other', 'one', 'reward', 'kind', 'incompetence', ""'m"", 'sending', 'one', 'back']",N/A

Now we have a new release date from a new company and with new box art. This classic show with great morals that still apply today along with humor that continues to be funny through the years is now available on a new DVD containing the following ten episodes:Cousin BarneyPolka Dot TieThe Pilgrim BoyTen-Pin Alley (formerly Ten Little Indians, guess it was offensive)Down On The FarmThe Jickets (formerly The Gang, guess gang now sends the wrong message)HelpLouder PleaseWhat's His NameThe WatchdogsThis series is rather old now so don't expect perfect sound or picture quality, but apart from the pilot released on the Volume One DVD, which itself was in good shape considering, I have found sound and picture haven't been an issue for me on others since.I guess over time certain political correctness found them opting for name changes on episodes but the show is still the same old Davey and Goliath. I was excited to watch the four volumes already released on DVD and think fans will enjoy this one too, it's too bad they haven't released larger box set formats or more DVD volumes, I'd love to have all these episodes on DVD.I think it's great in alot of ways that TV is always evolving and I know children's shows need to adapt to the times in certain ways but I wish we still had more simplistic series like this with right and wrong and a sense of morality and religious undertones. If only they could create a new show like this to at least balance the other things children are exposed to on TV, if not in place of them.Great DVD for fans, Goliath is so lovable even for children today and is what still sells the show. Hopefully they put out more Davey and Goliath on DVD, this is a series I would love to own. 5 Stars for anyone who is a fan or who wants wholesome entertainment with great moral lessons for children.",5,I Don't Know Davey,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,1920,"['Lost', 'Episodes', 'DVD', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'released', 'several', 'times', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'Now', 'have', 'new', 'release', 'date', 'new', 'company', 'new', 'box', 'art', 'classic', 'show', 'great', 'morals', 'still', 'apply', 'today', 'humor', 'be', 'funny', 'years', 'now', 'available', 'new', 'DVD', 'containing', 'following', 'ten', 'episodes', 'Cousin', 'BarneyPolka', 'Dot', 'TieThe', 'Pilgrim', 'BoyTen-Pin', 'Alley', 'formerly', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Indians', 'guess', 'was', 'offensive', 'Down', 'FarmThe', 'Jickets', 'formerly', 'Gang', 'guess', 'gang', 'now', 'wrong', 'message', 'HelpLouder', 'PleaseWhat', 'NameThe', 'WatchdogsThis', 'series', 'rather', 'old', 'now', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'perfect', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'apart', 'pilot', 'released', 'Volume', 'One', 'DVD', 'was', 'good', 'shape', 'considering', 'have', 'found', 'sound', 'picture', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'issue', 'others', 'since.I', 'guess', 'time', 'certain', 'political', 'correctness', 'found', 'opting', 'name', 'changes', 'episodes', 'show', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'was', 'excited', 'watch', 'four', 'volumes', 'already', 'released', 'DVD', 'think', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'too', 'too', 'bad', 'have', ""n't"", 'released', 'larger', 'box', 'set', 'formats', 'more', 'DVD', 'volumes', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'episodes', 'DVD.I', 'think', 'great', 'alot', 'ways', 'TV', 'always', 'evolving', 'know', 'children', 'shows', 'need', 'adapt', 'times', 'certain', 'ways', 'wish', 'still', 'had', 'more', 'simplistic', 'series', 'right', 'wrong', 'sense', 'morality', 'religious', 'undertones', 'only', 'could', 'create', 'new', 'show', 'least', 'balance', 'other', 'things', 'children', 'are', 'exposed', 'TV', 'not', 'place', 'them.Great', 'DVD', 'fans', 'Goliath', 'so', 'lovable', 'even', 'children', 'today', 'what', 'still', 'show', 'Hopefully', 'put', 'out', 'more', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'DVD', 'series', 'would', 'love', 'own', '5', 'Stars', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'who', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'great', 'moral', 'lessons', 'children']",N/A

I, for one, thought this would NEVER see the light of day so all I can say is, IT'S ABOUT TIME!These lost episodes were pulled from the airwaves and never aired again due to what they considered was politically incorrect.  However, in this age of reality shows, I really don't see what the problem is with these episodes.  My favorites in the set are The Gang (now known as The Jickets), Polka Dot Tie, Whatshisname, Help!, The Watchdogs and Louder Please.While I did enjoy watching these rarities, I did have some issues with edits in episodes like Cousin Barney, Ten Pin Alley (if there were any since I have never seen this one), Down on the Farm (Davey's skinny dipping dive) and What's His Name (tar and feather dream sequence).Overall, I enjoyed the DVD after such a LONG wait.
