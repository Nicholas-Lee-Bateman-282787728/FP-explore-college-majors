619008,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00005JMIJ,A. Burchfield,"[1, 5]","This movie starts out with a British murder mystery writer suffering from writers block. Her editor lets her use his vacation home in France to rest up and perhaps be inspired.She makes the trip, gets some inspiration along the way, and is able to start writing. Things are going well until the editor's daughter Julie, (late teens, early 20's?) shows up unannounced. The young lady seems to be a spoiled brat, doesn't pick up after herself, usually very noisy and brings a different man home for sex seemingly every night.As time goes on the author eventually begins to be inspired by the brat's actions, even stealing her diary for material, and possibly even starts to like her a little. Murder enters into the story when Julie kills one of her men out by the swimming pool (was she goaded into it?), the author helps her hide the body.In gratitude the Julie gives the author a copy of an unpublished manuscript written by her late mother,(the editor had burned what he thought was the only copy), with instructions to use it as she wishes.The movie pretty much concludes with our author submitting the resulting manuscript and getting a rejection. She then produces a copy of the thing, already published, telling him she knew he'd reject it and took it some where else. She tells him I signed it for your daughter, give it to her, and leaves. On the way out the author meets the daughter going in. Here is where you learn that most of the movie was something like a dream sequence because Julie is Julia, not French and doesn't look at all like the French girl did.I really liked the house where most of the movie was filmed, and even the nudity, most of it Julie, was well handled. Strip away those two components and this movie really didn't have much going for it. I saw Swimming Pool on pay per view, listed as unrated, if the nudity was removed this thing would put you to sleep it's so dull.",2,"3 stars  a little generous for this one, try 2 1/2 at most",1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,1902,"['movie', 'out', 'British', 'murder', 'mystery', 'writer', 'suffering', 'writers', 'block', 'editor', 'use', 'vacation', 'home', 'France', 'rest', 'up', 'perhaps', 'be', 'inspired.She', 'trip', 'inspiration', 'way', 'able', 'start', 'writing', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'editor', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'late', 'teens', 'early', '20', 'up', 'unannounced', 'young', 'lady', 'be', 'spoiled', 'brat', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'usually', 'very', 'noisy', 'different', 'man', 'home', 'sex', 'seemingly', 'night.As', 'time', 'author', 'eventually', 'be', 'inspired', 'brat', 'actions', 'even', 'stealing', 'diary', 'material', 'possibly', 'even', 'like', 'little', 'Murder', 'enters', 'story', 'when', 'Julie', 'one', 'men', 'out', 'swimming', 'pool', 'was', 'goaded', 'author', 'hide', 'body.In', 'gratitude', 'Julie', 'author', 'copy', 'unpublished', 'manuscript', 'written', 'late', 'mother', 'editor', 'had', 'burned', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'copy', 'instructions', 'use', 'wishes.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'concludes', 'author', 'submitting', 'resulting', 'manuscript', 'getting', 'rejection', 'then', 'copy', 'thing', 'already', 'published', 'telling', 'knew', ""'d"", 'reject', 'took', 'where', 'else', 'signed', 'daughter', 'give', 'way', 'author', 'daughter', 'going', 'Here', 'where', 'learn', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'not', 'French', ""n't"", 'look', 'French', 'girl', 'did.I', 'really', 'liked', 'house', 'where', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'even', 'nudity', 'most', 'Julie', 'was', 'well', 'handled', 'Strip', 'away', 'two', 'components', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'saw', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'pay', 'view', 'listed', 'unrated', 'nudity', 'was', 'removed', 'thing', 'would', 'put', 'sleep', 'so', 'dull']",Swimming Pool
619009,A1PMDTYRAIPGXW,B00005JMIJ,Adam P Boots,"[6, 12]","I'm not exactly a fan of foreign films to start with, so this story seemed to have a strike against it to start with, but I thought, what the heck?  The ONLY saving grace for this film was that there was a plot twist at the end.  Too bad the time it took me to get to the plot twist nearly had me sleeping.  The acting was fine, the script and pacing of the story made you feel like you were moving in slow motion.  Non-linear stories don't bother me, as Tarentino movies seem to do it and not seem to have slow pacing (in fact Tarentino's non-linear storytelling seems to speed up the flick, as does Guy Ritchie's, though they're also a different style of writer than the writer of Swimming Pool).This doesn't surprise me that the movie was in the $6.99 Dvd bin, as it seemed similar to any other B-movie &quot;suspense-thriller&quot; made in any other country.  (Though I hardly found the movie either suspenseful OR thrilling)Everyone's a critic and it looks like there's a lot of people who really enjoyed this flick.  I wasn't one of them.

619010,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,B00005JMIJ,"adriana ""alisa""","[7, 10]","Swimming Pool was advertised totally wrong. Now I wasn't dissapointed, because I'm not the biggest fan of mysteries/thrillers, but those who are expecting your typical little suspense flick will be more than a little dissapointed.Swimming Pool is more of a brooding little character study; with gorgeous scenery, a minimalistic, but on point script, and expertise, subtle performances from both the actresses.However, those who are again expecting a fast paced fun flick with thrills and kills need look elsewhere.Swimming Pool is moody, and slow-moving, and meandering, and very much an artsy flick.But an artsy flick done perfectly-not in the vain of shallow wannabes like Lost In Translation.You can read the plot from numerous other reviewers, but suffice to say, there really isn't much of one. It is not much more than a look into the lives of two very different women who develop a detached but at the same time close friendship over a short period of time in a lavish French country house.This is the first film I have seen with Charlotte Rampling, and I have to say that I intend to see more. She is an expert at saying little but expressing a whole lot. Another actress would'nt have been able to give much dimension to Charlotte's role as the icy mystery writer, Sarah Morton-But Rampling manages to make Sarah come alive on scren. Props also go to Ludivine Sagnier, who holds her own exceptionally well despite being a young newcomer.Again, in most films, the ""sexpot"" is usually not more than a one dimensional object-but Ludivine Sagnier, also with great taste and subtlety is able to bring humanity and a soul to her generally cliched ""sexpot"" character. And c'mon ladies, I'm a heterosexual female and all, but you gotta admit she's got one hot body on her.Guys, even if you're bored senseless by this artful flick, she'll keep you glued, guaranteed.Swimming Pool is one of those films (at least in my opinion) which relies far more on atmosphere and characters than it does on satisfying its audience with thrils.It's very tasteful and gorgeous to look at, and I was one of the people that was satisfied with the movie because its not just an arty exercise in pretentiousness-there is actual depth of feeling here. I'm still not exactly sure as to what it was trying to say, but I won't mind coming along for a few more viewing. Recommended, but don't assume that you will like it because the critics did.And definately don't expect your run of the mill mystery. This is a film that will only appeal to certain people with certain tastes, and for Swimming Pool, I can't say who that will be. But it is definately original and well made- and its almost amazing how a director could take such a barely there plot and transform Swimming Pool into an interesting and worthwhile film with great performances and armospherics.BIG props to him.",4,interesting,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,2854,"['Swimming', 'Pool', 'was', 'advertised', 'totally', 'wrong', 'Now', 'was', ""n't"", 'dissapointed', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'mysteries/thrillers', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'typical', 'little', 'suspense', 'flick', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'dissapointed.Swimming', 'Pool', 'more', 'brooding', 'little', 'character', 'study', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'minimalistic', 'point', 'script', 'expertise', 'subtle', 'performances', 'actresses.However', 'who', 'are', 'again', 'expecting', 'fast', 'paced', 'fun', 'flick', 'thrills', 'kills', 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere.Swimming', 'Pool', 'moody', 'slow-moving', 'meandering', 'very', 'much', 'artsy', 'flick.But', 'artsy', 'flick', 'done', 'perfectly-not', 'vain', 'shallow', 'wannabes', 'Lost', 'Translation.You', 'can', 'read', 'plot', 'numerous', 'other', 'reviewers', 'suffice', 'say', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'one', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'look', 'lives', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'who', 'develop', 'detached', 'same', 'time', 'close', 'friendship', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'lavish', 'French', 'country', 'house.This', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'have', 'say', 'intend', 'see', 'more', 'expert', 'saying', 'little', 'expressing', 'whole', 'lot', 'actress', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'give', 'much', 'dimension', 'Charlotte', 'role', 'icy', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Sarah', 'Morton-But', 'Rampling', 'make', 'Sarah', 'come', 'alive', 'scren', 'Props', 'also', 'go', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'who', 'own', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'being', 'young', 'newcomer.Again', 'most', 'films', 'sexpot', 'usually', 'not', 'more', 'one', 'dimensional', 'object-but', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'also', 'great', 'taste', 'subtlety', 'able', 'bring', 'humanity', 'soul', 'generally', 'cliched', 'sexpot', 'character', ""c'mon"", 'ladies', ""'m"", 'heterosexual', 'female', 'got', 'ta', 'got', 'one', 'hot', 'body', 'her.Guys', 'even', ""'re"", 'bored', 'senseless', 'artful', 'flick', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'glued', 'guaranteed.Swimming', 'Pool', 'one', 'films', 'least', 'opinion', 'far', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'satisfying', 'audience', 'thrils.It', 'very', 'tasteful', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'was', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'arty', 'exercise', 'pretentiousness-there', 'actual', 'depth', 'feeling', 'here', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'coming', 'along', 'few', 'more', 'viewing', 'Recommended', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'will', 'like', 'critics', 'did.And', 'definately', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'run', 'mill', 'mystery', 'film', 'will', 'only', 'appeal', 'certain', 'people', 'certain', 'tastes', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'definately', 'original', 'well', 'made-', 'almost', 'amazing', 'how', 'director', 'could', 'take', 'barely', 'plot', 'transform', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'armospherics.BIG', 'props']",Swimming Pool
619011,A30O553ONO1IIP,B00005JMIJ,Ahmed Khalifa,"[7, 11]","Swimming pool is a much hyped film that is reputed to be both original and enigmatic. The truth is, the film is neither original nor enigmatic, instead it is passable and definitely not captivating. Despite starting promisingly with an assured performance by Charlotte Rampling and an indeed atmospheric mood, the film goes down hill after twenty minutes or so as director Francois Ozone indulges in long takes and lethargic pacing while keeping the non-existent mystery at bay. So fans of Rampling, indeed give it a watch, her performance is commendable, but that is the only thing that is commendable about this pretentious and meandering thriller.",2,"Disappointing, would-be psychological thriller.",1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,650,"['Swimming', 'pool', 'much', 'hyped', 'film', 'reputed', 'be', 'original', 'enigmatic', 'truth', 'film', 'original', 'enigmatic', 'instead', 'passable', 'definitely', 'not', 'captivating', 'starting', 'promisingly', 'assured', 'performance', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'indeed', 'atmospheric', 'mood', 'film', 'down', 'hill', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'director', 'Francois', 'Ozone', 'long', 'lethargic', 'pacing', 'keeping', 'non-existent', 'mystery', 'bay', 'So', 'fans', 'Rampling', 'indeed', 'give', 'watch', 'performance', 'commendable', 'only', 'thing', 'commendable', 'pretentious', 'meandering', 'thriller']",Swimming Pool
619012,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JMIJ,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","Francois Ozon's ""Swimming Pool"" had me going along with it for most of the way. I thought Ozon directed the film with confidence. You get the feeling Ozon knows he has an interesting story to tell. You seem to be in good hands. The performances are enjoyable. Charlotte Rampling after all these years still mantains a strong screen presense. She is still able to hold a movie together as the central character. And the acting done by Ludivine Sagnier is...well, it's something else. Much of my praise of the movie is due to Sagnier. Because of her ""Swimming Pool"" oozes sexuality. The camera seems to be in love with her. She just seems to glow in some scenes.""Swimming Pool"" is about Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) she is a novelist. She writes murder mysteries. And she is having trouble writing a new book. So her publisher, John (Charles Dance) suggest that she go to his estate in France. To help her clear her mind. Thinking that a change of air will do her good and provide some inspiration. So Sarah goes. Hoping for the best. To her surprise she enjoys it out there. Everything seems perfect. Lots of peace and quite. And soon she even finds herself hard at work with her novel. And then things turn upside down. It seems John forgot to tell Sarah one important detail. His daughter is going to be staying there as well. The daughter is played by Sagnier her name is Julie. These two are the female version of the odd couple. She's young wild and loud. Sarah is not lol.As the days go on Sarah soon becomes fasinated with Julie. She becomes very interested in all aspects of her private life. The men she is dating. Information about her relationship with her parents and even starts to read her diary. Now, I also don't want anyone to start to jump to conclusions and think this is going to turn into a love story between the two. It's not. And then yet again something unexpected happens. And naturally I can't say anymore.A lot of people including myself are going to feel confused by the movie. And this may cause many to say they don't like the movie. This is not fair. Just because the movie is going to make you think that's no reason not to like it. Others might say it's boring. It goes on too long. The movie is about 90-95 minutes. People who say this are just too use to watching faster moving Hollywood pictures and don't appreicate a movie that actually takes it's time to tell a story. Also, something I feel I should point out is this is NOT a foreign movie. I thought it would be, but, it's not. The movie is about 90% in english. Very little French is spoken.So is ""Swimming Pool"" worth seeing? Most audiences will enjoy it. Those who like slower moving movies will like it. People who enjoy Charlottle Rampling may like it. Fans of Ozon (""Under the Sand"") might get a kick out of it. But the ""average joe"" will hate it. I admit the movie in it's last scene confused me. And others probably will become confused also. But, all I can say is, don't be afraid to think.Bottom-line: Interesting ""different"" movie experience. Rampling gives a good performace. And Ludivine Sagnier is truly something to see. Worth while for most moviefans.",3,"Take A Plunge Into The ""Swimming Pool""",1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,3164,"['Francois', 'Ozon', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'had', 'going', 'most', 'way', 'thought', 'Ozon', 'directed', 'film', 'confidence', 'get', 'feeling', 'Ozon', 'interesting', 'story', 'tell', 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'hands', 'performances', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'years', 'still', 'strong', 'screen', 'presense', 'still', 'able', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'central', 'character', 'acting', 'done', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'well', 'something', 'else', 'Much', 'praise', 'movie', 'due', 'Sagnier', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'sexuality', 'camera', 'be', 'love', 'just', 'glow', 'scenes', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'novelist', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'having', 'trouble', 'writing', 'new', 'book', 'publisher', 'John', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'suggest', 'go', 'estate', 'France', 'help', 'clear', 'mind', 'Thinking', 'change', 'air', 'will', 'do', 'good', 'provide', 'inspiration', 'So', 'Sarah', 'Hoping', 'best', 'surprise', 'there', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'Lots', 'peace', 'quite', 'soon', 'even', 'hard', 'work', 'novel', 'then', 'things', 'turn', 'upside', 'down', 'John', 'forgot', 'tell', 'Sarah', 'one', 'important', 'detail', 'daughter', 'going', 'be', 'staying', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'played', 'Sagnier', 'name', 'Julie', 'two', 'are', 'female', 'version', 'odd', 'couple', 'young', 'wild', 'loud', 'Sarah', 'not', 'lol.As', 'days', 'go', 'Sarah', 'soon', 'becomes', 'fasinated', 'Julie', 'very', 'interested', 'aspects', 'private', 'life', 'men', 'dating', 'Information', 'relationship', 'parents', 'even', 'starts', 'read', 'diary', 'Now', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'start', 'jump', 'conclusions', 'think', 'going', 'turn', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'not', 'then', 'yet', 'again', 'something', 'unexpected', 'happens', 'naturally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore.A', 'lot', 'people', 'including', 'are', 'going', 'feel', 'confused', 'movie', 'may', 'cause', 'many', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'not', 'fair', 'Just', 'movie', 'going', 'make', 'think', 'reason', 'not', 'like', 'Others', 'might', 'say', 'boring', 'too', 'long', 'movie', '90-95', 'minutes', 'People', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'use', 'watching', 'faster', 'moving', 'Hollywood', 'pictures', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreicate', 'movie', 'actually', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'Also', 'something', 'feel', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'NOT', 'foreign', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'movie', 'about', '90', '%', 'english', 'Very', 'little', 'French', 'spoken.So', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Most', 'audiences', 'will', 'enjoy', 'who', 'like', 'slower', 'moving', 'movies', 'will', 'like', 'People', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Charlottle', 'Rampling', 'may', 'like', 'Fans', 'Ozon', 'Sand', 'might', 'get', 'kick', 'average', 'joe', 'will', 'hate', 'admit', 'movie', 'last', 'scene', 'confused', 'others', 'probably', 'will', 'become', 'confused', 'also', 'can', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'think.Bottom-line', 'Interesting', 'different', 'movie', 'experience', 'Rampling', 'good', 'performace', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'truly', 'something', 'see', 'Worth', 'most', 'moviefans']",Swimming Pool

It's not enough to offer a clever twist, when the story doesn't really make sense to begin with. No it's not that something is missing and it gets explained. It's more like trying to cook a raw fish by pouring suger on it. Interesting idea, but it still is not eatable.A middle aged authoress goes to live in her publisher's house in France in order to write her new book.

Somehow, I may have seen it already in other films, but I can't remember which ones. My theory of how it goes in Swimming Pool is simple: the author was playing out her newly penned story within herself. Otherwise, it is too implausible to make it all that simple, neat, and convenient. The other theory, albeit a weak one, is that she killed her mother and the waiter boyfriend. One notices how slow the film seems to move; I think it has a very good pacing about it: a nice deliberate build-up of the setting. Obviously, Charlotte Rampling, who plays the author, is an Ellen Burstyn clone. The catalyst of the show is Ludivine Sagnier, and the reason why for it is that she is often nude in which I think that's the extent of her acting abilities for whatever she has left.

It's not traditional. The mystery, though there, is hard to figure, even once the closing credits roll. SWIMMING POOL isn't about its mystery. Director Francois Ozon isn't really interested in making a by-the-book thriller. Instead, he uses the conventions of that genre, the things to get audiences into the cinema, to craft a surprising and fascinating psychological film about the character of repressed mystery novelist Sarah Morton, showing how she comes alive when confronted by both the beauty of the French villa where she's on holiday and her publisher's wild, sexually free daughter Julie.Charlotte Rampling, as Morton, delivers one of the great performances of her long career. She crafts Morton as a smart, sour woman with layer upon layer of emotional depth and carries the film. It took me two viewings of the film to figure out that what's most fascinating about the film isn't the mystery, it's the character of Morton and how you get to know her inner thoughts and desires, her very core. She's smart, bitter, cold and savvy. Those are her weapons.The film presents us with two ideas of who women are and how they can choose to behave. It explores both personas by allowing them to clash.Ludivine Sagnier, as the young Julie, is masterful, portraying the character as someone as cunning as Morton. However, unlike Morton, Julie has an entirely different arsenal of weapons at her disposal and uses them with equal skill. She flaunts her freedom, her youth and her sexuality to strike blows against Morton, and their fight is fascinating.Again, SWIMMING POOL is a film that's best appreciated if it's seen twice.

619029,A1VZOI54BXGA78,B00005JMIJ,Born to Read,"[9, 11]","Few films that I have seen recently have generated so much controversy or stimulated so much thought as The Swimming Pool.  Some of my friends loved it, even though they were baffled by it; others were frustrated by what they saw as a bizarre plot that didn't quite hang together.  I appreciated it on a number of different planes - its stunning visual beauty, its mesmerizing cast, and a plot that is a sort of intellectual mystery that the viewer must solve.  You will probably not have solved it until you see the end of the movie; then you will want to go back and watch it all againWithout giving too much away, let me say that at its most fascinating level this film is an allegory of the creative process.  Sarah Morton, brilliantly portrayed by Charlotte Rampling, has come to southern France to conceive and write a book that will be outside the mold of the very popular detective series she has been writing for years and with which she has become desperately weary.  As she experiences France, she writes.  Or is it the other way around?  Perhaps she's in search of characters; or are they in search of her?

619030,A3LPD7NTGFH7V4,B00005JMIJ,bowery boy,"[27, 33]","This was one of the best films I saw last year.  I'm a huge fan of Francois Ozon.  He is brilliant at creating films full of suspense and sexual tension and Swimming Pool is no exception.  I wouldn't recommend this film unless you're a fan of Ozon, French films, Charlotte Rampling or the unbelievably gorgeous and talented Ludivine Sagnier (check out her remarkably different and dynamic performances in Ozon's 8 Women or Water Drops On Burning Rocks).!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!The end makes absolute sense. You just have to pay very close attention to every detail of the film.  Sarah knew her publisher had a daughter named Julie but she NEVER met her, hence the ending.  When Sarah arrives at the cottage everything up to the point when she goes into town and sees the waiter for the first time is real.  Everything after Julie's arrival at the cottage is Sarah's novel.  None of it happened at all.  Sarah imagined what it would be like if Julie, whom she never met, unexpectedly arrived at the cottage full of youth and full blown sexuality and what would the consequences of their meeting be if they both had a thing for the waiter who briefly flirted with Sarah on her first day in town.  So at the end, when chubby braces wearing Julie walks into the office, she's not the Julie we saw throughout the entire film because that Julie and everything associated with her was a figment of Sarah's imagination.Those who didn't understand the ending or don't like intellectually challenging films hated the movie.  It definitely makes you scratch your head and say ""Huh?"" but if you really think long and hard about what you just saw you'll realize Swimming Pool is a very clever and thought provoking film.

""Swimming Pool"" is a thriller in the style of ""The Deep End,"" and more than once I was struck by similarities between the two in their respective tones and reliance on water as a recurring visual motif.  Also, both films have a middle-aged female as the protagonist who becomes involved in covering up for the actions of a child (in ""The Deep End"" a literal child, in ""Swimming Pool"" a figurative one).Also, both films are completely unpredictable.  Neither goes the direction in which the viewer thinks it's going to.  However, ""Swimming Pool"" is much more abstract, and its ending leaves you wanting to watch the whole thing over immediately with an entirely different perspective on the action.  This gimmick always makes for a memorable ending in movies that employ it, but too often it makes the rest of the movie seem somewhat pale in comparison, and this is the case here.  ""Swimming Pool"" plays tricks with your perceptions, but the finale to which the film builds seems somewhat anti-climactic when it finally comes.It's a leisurely paced film, and you'll need to have patience with it.  You'll also need to have patience with the main character, played by Charlotte Rampling.  Rampling gives a fine performance, but her character is really unlikable (intentionally so), and it's always a liability for any story that focuses almost solely on one person to make that person unlikable, or at least sympathetic.""Swimming Pool,"" though billed as an erotic thriller, is really about the creative process (I think), and I won't say anymore about that because to do so will give away the ending.

However, The Swimming Pool is a very subtle film that starts from a cold place of a stiff, chilly, isolated English writer played accordingly by Charlotte Rampling.  (Welcome back Charlotte!!!) Through a quirky, maybe contrived but still very creative and writerly storyline, it warms under a French sun and into a psychological thriller that doesn't quite make sense until the end.  Ludivine Sagnier sparkles and recharges everybody's batteries whether she is clothed or not.

The female leads both gave excellent performances: Charlotte Rampling's is noteworthy for the strength of her character portrayal, and Ludivine Sagnier, while having an easier character to portray (a hedonistic young French woman), deserves much credit for her lack of inhibitions and for several scenes (particularly her dance scene) which will please anyone with an eye for female beauty and the power it can wield.The story is, on its surface, a clash of cultures between a staid, uptight British author who only imagines nefarious doings and hedonistic pursuits, and a young free-spirited French woman whose life is mostly devoted to actually partaking in pleasures of the flesh. However, by the end, the viewer realizes that what has actually been portrayed is a depiction of the artistic process. How does an artist absorb information from the world around them, especially from a muse, and then transform that into art? To what degree is reality altered? What is fact, and what is fiction? And even more importantly, what do the alterations and choices made by the author reveal about them, as opposed to the subject of the artwork?Similar questions are posed in the 2002 film ""Adaptation"", which was my favorite of the year, and which I would still recommend as a better movie than ""Swimming Pool"". However, ""Swimming Pool"" definitely has its pleasures, and is worth seeing.

Quite often, European films (especially French) feel like they have little in the way of a plot, and they just seem to drop the ending on you out of the blue somewhere between 90 and 180 minutes into the film.I liked this film because it combined some aspects of a typical French art film with those of a more mainstream film with a result that was better than many films from either gendre. In fact, I guess I would say that mixing gendres is a good thing in general.Hollywood movies often use sex in asinine ways. The intent is to entice the viewer, but often this fails just because it's so poorly conceived. (Not everyone watching the film is a sixteen-year-old boy!) This movie didn't try to overdo it. A few well chosen scenes of ""La Divine"" Sagnier swimming in the nude or nonchalantly chatting up the other woman while topless were enough to grab my attention and re-focus it on the movie at points where it was going a little slow for my taste.I was a bit baffled by the ending, but after thinking about it overnight, I think I have a better handle on it now.

You can feel the heat of the sun over southern France.  In fact, from a purely technical standpoint, this film could be used as a cinema text book.As someone who is old enough to remember when Charlotte Rampling was widely regarded as the hottest woman in film, it is almost unsettling to see her cast as a middle aged, near spinster, ill tempered author of murder mysteries. At the invitation of her editor, Rampling's character travels to France to stay at his country home for a little R&R; with hopes that the environment might serve to recharge her creative batteries. Instead, she finds herself thrust into a situation where she must share the house with her editor's wildly attractive ( and promiscuous ) daughter, played by Ludivine Sangier.With time, Rampling's character begins to loosen up and the two women develop a more positive relationship. However this placidity is short lived, and a murder is introduced into the plot.I won't go any further in describing the story line except to say that there is a final ( and logical ) surprise in store for the viewer.This film has generated quite a bit of attention due, to a great extent, by Ms. Sangier's frequent nudity. I didn't feel that it was gratuitous, but rather helps create an emotional/ psychological climate that permeates the house. I strongly disagree with any statements that this film has anything in common with the work of Alfred Hitchcock. This film has a very leisurely pace. Perhaps too leisurely; and that's where I feel that there is a problem. Missing is the kind of fast paced cutting or  the eerie, surreal, tension found in many a Hitchcock film.It is hard to figure out to what the director ( Francois Ozon ) had in mind. There is a bit of a made for tv feel to this film. As beautiful as it is, I feel that this film could have used more of that Hitchcockian edge. I also feel that the movie is either too short or too long. The story would have benefitted from greater character development, such as more of a sense of Rampling's life in England, her history with her editor, etc. Yet, there are also scenes that are too long.I am left with "" fish or foul "" kind of ambivalence about this film. It is certainly worth owning, but it you might be left with a feeling that there was something missing.",4,Hard to nail down,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,2388,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'cinematography', 'nothing', 'less', 'perfect', 'use', 'color', 'masterful', 'can', 'feel', 'heat', 'sun', 'southern', 'France', 'fact', 'purely', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'cinema', 'text', 'book.As', 'someone', 'who', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'was', 'widely', 'regarded', 'hottest', 'woman', 'film', 'almost', 'unsettling', 'see', 'cast', 'middle', 'aged', 'spinster', 'ill', 'tempered', 'author', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'invitation', 'editor', 'Rampling', 'character', 'travels', 'France', 'stay', 'country', 'home', 'little', 'R', 'R', 'hopes', 'environment', 'might', 'serve', 'recharge', 'creative', 'batteries', 'Instead', 'thrust', 'situation', 'where', 'must', 'share', 'house', 'editor', 'wildly', 'attractive', 'promiscuous', 'daughter', 'played', 'Ludivine', 'Sangier.With', 'time', 'Rampling', 'character', 'loosen', 'up', 'two', 'women', 'develop', 'more', 'positive', 'relationship', 'However', 'placidity', 'short', 'lived', 'murder', 'introduced', 'plot.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'describing', 'story', 'line', 'say', 'final', 'logical', 'surprise', 'store', 'viewer.This', 'film', 'generated', 'quite', 'bit', 'attention', 'due', 'great', 'extent', 'Ms.', 'Sangier', 'frequent', 'nudity', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'rather', 'create', 'emotional/', 'psychological', 'climate', 'house', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'statements', 'film', 'anything', 'common', 'work', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'very', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'leisurely', 'where', 'feel', 'problem', 'Missing', 'kind', 'fast', 'paced', 'cutting', 'eerie', 'surreal', 'tension', 'found', 'many', 'Hitchcock', 'film.It', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'director', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'had', 'mind', 'bit', 'made', 'tv', 'feel', 'film', 'As', 'beautiful', 'feel', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'Hitchcockian', 'edge', 'also', 'feel', 'movie', 'either', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'greater', 'character', 'development', 'such', 'more', 'sense', 'Rampling', 'life', 'England', 'history', 'editor', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'long.I', 'am', 'left', 'fish', 'foul', 'kind', 'ambivalence', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'owning', 'might', 'be', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'something', 'missing']",Swimming Pool
619058,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00005JMIJ,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[21, 24]","Like a typical art house film, this offering from director, Franois Ozon meanders a bit, giving us a slice of the life of Sarah Morton, a successful crime fiction author as she foregoes her busy London writer's block for the needed tranquility of the South of France.  We watch Sarah perform little things with little dialogue and get the impression that she lives a routine where most of her desires are repressed by her own rigidity.  We get a glimpse of her life in London with her father and a sense that Sarah's only outlet may be some secret drinking.  We feel her yearning for something else, perhaps she feels she is destined for better things as a writer besides financial success. She settles into her new environment quickly, and just as immediately begins a new manuscript.  Happily preoccupied, her thoughts of writing something a little different are back-burnered until the advent of her publisher's daughter--Julie.Julie embodies everything that Sarah is not.  Her young vivacious, and blatantly sexy persona instantly provoke Sarah to bristling hostility---after all, her peaceful interlude has been disturbed; the routine is broken and Sarah finds that she can no longer write her usual police procedural.  Instead, she begins to explore Julie, at first visually as Julie quite candidly and literally bounces about the villa in half-naked splendor and then with her other senses, as Julie loudly proclaims her enjoyment of the sexual pleasures attained when she brings home a different man every night and replaces Sarah's bland yogurt and diet Coke with palate pleasing cheeses, foie gras and the region's best wine.  The more Sarah learns about Julie, the more mystery she uncovers and busily records in a new manuscript with the writer's typical deft enjoyment---what is the situation between Julie's father and mother?  What is the scar on Julie's abdomen?  What's this about a car accident involving Julie and her mother?  Why does she come home with a black eye?  And why does she keep replacing the crucifix above Sarah's bed?At the point in the film when Julie secretly reads the working manuscript, the two characters of Julie and Sarah seemed to me to merge into one.  They both romance a waiter from the nearby village and when Julie confesses to killing him, Sarah does not blink an eye, but rather aids her in getting rid of the body and diverting the attentions of any suspicious outsiders.  At this point the film rapidly draws to its conclusion.  The action becames improbable and strains the viewer's ability to accept it all as credibile. We feel as if we we have been drawn into a rather implausible plot and are expected to believe it. When Sarah returns to London and presents her publisher with the finished book---supposedly about his highly promiscuous murdering daughter, he doesn't even bat an eye.  When Sarah, encounters Julia, the publisher's daughter at the film's end, we discover that Julie and Julia were not at all the same person.  When the credits role, our reaction is HUH?  accompanied by a lot of head-scratching.But, what if Julie was just a character that Sarah dreamed up in her head, what if some of Julie's personality were intermingled with Sarah's own life--her own past and present relationship with her father and her mother.  What if a lifetime of repression was allowed a voice crying out from the body of a ripe teenager? Or perhaps all the unanswered questions about Julie's past and her troubled present were just plot devices, red herrings and dead-ends that all writers encounter as they work out a story.  Either way, what if that magically creative once-in-the-lifetime story suddenly took on a life of its own and allowed itself to be written down?This is all speculation, but I believe that to a degree this is what the Swimming Pool alludes to:  the creative process likened to taking a plunge in a deeper, less safe end of the pools we have all created for ourselves.Well worth watching with someone you can discuss it with later!",4,Conversation Provoking Speculation--Beware SPOILER!,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,4009,"['typical', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'offering', 'director', 'Franois', 'Ozon', 'bit', 'giving', 'slice', 'life', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'successful', 'crime', 'fiction', 'author', 'busy', 'London', 'writer', 'block', 'needed', 'tranquility', 'South', 'France', 'watch', 'Sarah', 'perform', 'little', 'things', 'little', 'dialogue', 'get', 'impression', 'routine', 'where', 'most', 'desires', 'are', 'repressed', 'own', 'rigidity', 'get', 'glimpse', 'life', 'London', 'father', 'sense', 'Sarah', 'only', 'outlet', 'may', 'be', 'secret', 'drinking', 'feel', 'yearning', 'something', 'else', 'perhaps', 'destined', 'better', 'things', 'writer', 'financial', 'success', 'new', 'environment', 'quickly', 'just', 'immediately', 'new', 'manuscript', 'Happily', 'preoccupied', 'thoughts', 'writing', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'are', 'back-burnered', 'advent', 'publisher', 'daughter', 'Julie.Julie', 'everything', 'Sarah', 'not', 'young', 'vivacious', 'blatantly', 'sexy', 'persona', 'instantly', 'provoke', 'Sarah', 'bristling', 'hostility', '-after', 'peaceful', 'interlude', 'been', 'disturbed', 'routine', 'broken', 'Sarah', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'write', 'usual', 'police', 'procedural', 'Instead', 'explore', 'Julie', 'first', 'visually', 'Julie', 'quite', 'candidly', 'literally', 'bounces', 'villa', 'half-naked', 'splendor', 'then', 'other', 'senses', 'Julie', 'loudly', 'enjoyment', 'sexual', 'pleasures', 'attained', 'when', 'home', 'different', 'man', 'night', 'Sarah', 'bland', 'yogurt', 'diet', 'Coke', 'palate', 'pleasing', 'cheeses', 'foie', 'gras', 'region', 'best', 'wine', 'more', 'Sarah', 'learns', 'Julie', 'more', 'mystery', 'uncovers', 'busily', 'records', 'new', 'manuscript', 'writer', 'typical', 'deft', 'enjoyment', 'situation', 'Julie', 'father', 'mother', 'What', 'scar', 'Julie', 'abdomen', 'What', 'car', 'accident', 'involving', 'Julie', 'mother', 'Why', 'come', 'home', 'black', 'eye', 'why', 'keep', 'replacing', 'crucifix', 'Sarah', 'bed', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'Julie', 'secretly', 'working', 'manuscript', 'two', 'characters', 'Julie', 'Sarah', 'seemed', 'merge', 'one', 'romance', 'waiter', 'nearby', 'village', 'when', 'Julie', 'killing', 'Sarah', 'not', 'blink', 'eye', 'rather', 'getting', 'rid', 'body', 'diverting', 'attentions', 'suspicious', 'outsiders', 'point', 'film', 'rapidly', 'conclusion', 'action', 'improbable', 'viewer', 'ability', 'accept', 'credibile', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'rather', 'implausible', 'plot', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'When', 'Sarah', 'London', 'publisher', 'finished', 'book', '-supposedly', 'highly', 'promiscuous', 'murdering', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'even', 'bat', 'eye', 'When', 'Sarah', 'Julia', 'publisher', 'daughter', 'film', 'end', 'discover', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'person', 'When', 'credits', 'role', 'reaction', 'HUH', 'accompanied', 'lot', 'head-scratching.But', 'what', 'Julie', 'was', 'just', 'character', 'Sarah', 'dreamed', 'up', 'head', 'what', 'Julie', 'personality', 'were', 'intermingled', 'Sarah', 'own', 'life', 'own', 'past', 'present', 'relationship', 'father', 'mother', 'What', 'lifetime', 'repression', 'was', 'allowed', 'voice', 'crying', 'out', 'body', 'ripe', 'teenager', 'perhaps', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Julie', 'past', 'troubled', 'present', 'were', 'just', 'plot', 'devices', 'red', 'herrings', 'dead-ends', 'writers', 'encounter', 'work', 'out', 'story', 'way', 'what', 'magically', 'creative', 'once-in-the-lifetime', 'story', 'suddenly', 'took', 'life', 'own', 'allowed', 'be', 'written', 'down', 'speculation', 'believe', 'degree', 'what', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'alludes', 'creative', 'process', 'likened', 'taking', 'plunge', 'deeper', 'less', 'safe', 'end', 'pools', 'have', 'created', 'ourselves.Well', 'worth', 'watching', 'someone', 'can', 'discuss', 'later']",Swimming Pool
619059,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JMIJ,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[3, 7]","Charlotte Rampling stars in this odd, atmospheric, murderous mystery, in which a snappish, menopausal middle aged British mystery writer is induced by her publisher to avail herself of the use of French country house, and try to just chill out a little.  When she gets there, though, she finds the house is also inhabited by the publisher's unacknowledged French daughter, a wild, uninhibited Gallic nymphette, who tries to make peace with her crabby new neighbor, and then just gives up and goes out clubbing every night instead.  There are a lot of aspects of this film that make it appealing -- the odd psychosexual interplay between the two women, the constant misdirection  by the filmmakers, and, above all, Rampling's tour de force performance as one of the strangest and most deeply flawed characters to hit the screen in quite some time.  The first half of the film is the most unsettling and the best, but despite an unfulfilling (and possibly illusory) resolution, this is still a pretty captivating film...

619060,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005JMIJ,D. Mok,"[3, 3]","Swimming Pool serves as a marvellous showcase for Francois Ozon's frequent actress, Ludivine Sagnier.  Whatever the film's flaws, Sagnier will etch herself into your memory -- her performance is nothing less than on the level of Vivien Leigh's immortal turn in A Streetcar Named Desire.While Charlotte Rampling delivers a fascinating level of insidiousness into the role of writer Sarah Morton, the role is somewhat underdeveloped -- or, depending on how you read the ending, could also be a deliberate, one-sided portrayal of a psychology whose other facets are reflected somewhere else in the film.  Personally I still feel more could have been done with the role both in the writing and in the performance; for the first half hour, there is practically no conflict, leaving one with the feeling that Sarah is just a prototypical &quot;repressed English old-maid writer&quot;.  Thankfully, the script opens up the character late in the film to prevent her from being a complete cliche, and this is where Rampling is allowed to strut her stuff.But Sagnier, as rebellious Julie, is the emotional core of the film.  Aside from delivering the unabashed sexuality and spunky charm this kind of role requires, Sagnier's gift shows in the heavier psychological scenes, especially when Julie is alone.  Sagnier conveys the complexities of a haunted, mysterious soul with a background of deep joy and deep hurt.  She may well have given the sexiest performance of the year, but to be able to colour this performance with the emotional truth she conjures is simply amazing.The story won't be to all tastes.  The twist ending is deliberately ambiguous; the editing is bold; and pacing-wise the film lags at two spots.  Luckily, whenever Rampling and Sagnier square off, the dramatic sparks fly, and most of the film is based on the interplay of the two actors.  There's also the matter of the explicit sexuality.  However, be patient with this film (especially with the first 40 minutes or so) and you will be rewarded with one of the finest performances of the year in a film that's unique both in its strengths and its flaws.",4,"Gutsy, ambiguous film with a fantastic performance.",1060473600,"08 10, 2003",2003,2118,"['Swimming', 'Pool', 'marvellous', 'showcase', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'frequent', 'actress', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'film', 'flaws', 'Sagnier', 'will', 'etch', 'memory', 'performance', 'nothing', 'less', 'level', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'immortal', 'turn', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire.While', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'fascinating', 'level', 'insidiousness', 'role', 'writer', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'role', 'somewhat', 'underdeveloped', 'depending', 'how', 'read', 'ending', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'deliberate', 'one-sided', 'portrayal', 'psychology', 'other', 'facets', 'are', 'reflected', 'somewhere', 'else', 'film', 'Personally', 'still', 'feel', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'role', 'writing', 'performance', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'practically', 'conflict', 'leaving', 'one', 'feeling', 'Sarah', 'just', 'prototypical', 'quot', 'repressed', 'English', 'old-maid', 'writer', 'quot', 'Thankfully', 'script', 'up', 'character', 'late', 'film', 'prevent', 'being', 'complete', 'cliche', 'where', 'Rampling', 'allowed', 'strut', 'stuff.But', 'Sagnier', 'rebellious', 'Julie', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'Aside', 'delivering', 'unabashed', 'sexuality', 'spunky', 'charm', 'kind', 'role', 'Sagnier', 'gift', 'heavier', 'psychological', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'Julie', 'alone', 'Sagnier', 'conveys', 'complexities', 'haunted', 'mysterious', 'soul', 'background', 'deep', 'joy', 'deep', 'hurt', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'given', 'sexiest', 'performance', 'year', 'be', 'able', 'colour', 'performance', 'emotional', 'truth', 'simply', 'amazing.The', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'tastes', 'twist', 'ending', 'deliberately', 'ambiguous', 'editing', 'bold', 'pacing-wise', 'film', 'lags', 'two', 'spots', 'Luckily', 'whenever', 'Rampling', 'Sagnier', 'square', 'off', 'dramatic', 'sparks', 'fly', 'most', 'film', 'based', 'interplay', 'two', 'actors', 'also', 'matter', 'explicit', 'sexuality', 'However', 'be', 'patient', 'film', 'especially', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'year', 'film', 'unique', 'strengths', 'flaws']",Swimming Pool

This merely lies out the underpinnings of what will consequently be revealed.Charlotte Rampling gives a blazing peformance and you feel cheated when she is not on screen. However, Ludivine Sagnier strolling about in striking bikinis (and occasionally nude) may take your mind off Rampling for a few moments. Ludivine's girlish, choppy, French accent discourages from what could have been a prime performance. I don't think any Hollywood actress would have been better suited in this role, however an exotic French actress who was more articulate in English may have.The cinematography and slow moving plot pace reminds one of an Eric Rohmer film, however the comparisons stop there.  In a Rohmer film, personal relationships and virtues are more deeply explored.A fun journey around a swimming pool in France, I recommend this one due to it's lush visuals and a stunning perfomance from Charlotte Rampling.NOTE: Hit the 'Menu' button on the DVD remote when the ""WARNING"" notice first comes up on screen as soon as you put the disc in.

Rampling gives us glimpses into her characters constant struggle to maintain some kind of balance to maintain what must be a tenuous grip on sanity.  She tries to keep to a strict regiment of yogurt and diet coke but when something upsets her she binges on chocolate pastries and wine like a starved animal. She gives the feeling of one not quite in control of themselves and their urges. What throws her off her diet and her writing habits is the arrival of a sexy young teen. She thinks her publisher has her given a quiet paradise to write in but then his teenage daughter turns up and Ramplings world is shaken. At first she is devastated and disappointed with the interuption in her routines but then she finds an interruption was just what was needed. She wants to create something different than she has before so she must find a new balance for herself and this girl is just the thing to purge herself of her old routines. Rampling is the star. our focus is on her psychology throughout but the young girl is played by a very talented young actress as well named Ludivine Sagnier.

Nudity and eroticism are not hard to find on film, and in that department, this movie is average at best.Fortunately, Swimming Pool is a good movie in its own right, though admittedly it's not for everyone.  It's fairly slow paced, and the beginning can fairly be described as boring, but with patience it becomes pretty rewarding, as suspense is heightened and curious events occur.  There's a deep texture that's absent most films and the ending causes a bit more thought than your typical film, though I wouldn't say that the end is that big of a surprise or even that original.  It's an idea that's been done before, in America even, but the captivating atmosphere of the movie gives it a unique stamp.

It's entirely impossible.Brilliantly written, staged, paced, and directed, Francois Ozon's SWIMMING POOL is a marvel for many more reasons than one could possibly explore here.  Sumptuous location photography plays second bill to cunningly subtle acting by both Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier, both of whom arguably deserve serious Academy Award consideration if not nomination.  Their roles are written to absolute perfection, and their work (a budding surprise from Ms. Sagnier) is nothing short of exemplary.  Perhaps the greatest impact of the film is the clever manner in which Ozon uses his two leads as bookends: they're stunningly beautiful -- one mature, one immature -- but with equal doses of character deviousness thrown aboard in ways only the watchful, patient viewer can appreciate.Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a crime novelist specializing in stories relating to her principle Inspector Dorwell.  She has toiled away successfully for years, but true inner satisfaction eludes her, sitting as out of reach as the invalid father she cares for.  At the suggestion of her editor (Charles Dance, in a role all-too-brief), a vacation to a French villa.  There, her editor's daughter Julie (Sagnier) shows up unannounced and provides her with displays of youthful indiscretions that serve inspiration for an all-new book -- one ripe with incredibly sensuous overtones and laced, to her wisened surprise, with murder most foul.And don't be fooled.  This is a story for adults, for intellects, and for movie maniacs.  Let the story unfold.  Allow the events to happen, one after the other.  The film will climax in a way that dazzles and delights, and the viewer will be rewarded with, perhaps, dozens of interpretations to what just happened.As it stands, the ""swimming pool"" stands as a powerful storytelling metaphor that gradually -- over the course of a serious of unpredictable events -- binds these two entirely different women together in a way that ... well ... to discuss much more would give away much of the impact (and surprise) of the film.

James-type writer of ""murder, sex, and violence"" novels) and Ludivine Sagnier (as Julie, Sarah's publisher's sensual French daughter).Sarah's publisher (and former lover) lets her use his house in the Luberon to recharge her batteries.  (He really just wants to get rid of her.)  Peter and Annie Mayle may be enjoying their light-hearted Year in Provence farther down the road, but Swimming Pool is more David Lynch than Jacques Tati.Sagnier is beautiful, as any young woman her age would be, but is also more in command of her character's emotions than any ten actresses who regularly play similar roles in American erotic thrillers.  The risks Sagnier takes with her face are more daring than the displays of her body by the swimming pool or while having sex with strangers.But Swimming Pool is Charlotte Rampling's movie.  It's the middle-aged writer Sarah who dismisses a mystery fan who recognizes her on the London Tube with the warning,  ""I'm not who you think I am.""  So who is she?As Sarah reacts to Julie's taunts and promiscuity while they share the house in France, we - - and Sarah - -  learn the answer.  There's a murder and a cover-up, and you wonder if you're seeing the usual noir-ish set-up of an innocent party, but Sarah herself is the real mystery.Swimming Pool is a thriller, like Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, for adults, not for an audience that wants to be sedated by the latest comic-book adventure.We watch Sarah change from a buttoned-up Englishwoman wearing grays and scarves twisted around her neck to a more European woman, wearing brighter clothes, showing more of her body, more satisfied with her own free (not just in the sexual sense) nature.  She's given her new book, entitled Swimming Pool, based on Julie's secrets and perhaps her own, to a different publisher, not to Julie's father, who doesn't even comprehend her art.  (""I don't understand what you're trying to say."")  But Sarah says her detective inspector will be back, too, as good as ever.

However, I have reconsidered watching it again, after reviewing some five pages of plausible possibilities on what exactly transpired during the 103 minutes of this film.On the surface, the movie seems pretty straight forward. A lonely, bitter, spinster, English murder mystery novelist travels to France, at her publisher's request, for some much needed rest and relaxation. Her publisher hopes this getaway will re-invigorate his client to write again. While staying at her publisher's villa in France, the author (Sarah) is joined by Julie, the publisher's daughter, who has also stopped by her father's house for some rest and relaxation. A murder is committed, and our two female characters go on to depose of the evidence. In the end, Sarah writes a new murder mystery novel titled ""Swimming Pool"" which retells the events of her French retreat, only to have it distributed by another publishing firm.The issue at hand is what's real and what's fiction. The most common belief is that at some point in the film, the movie moves from reality to a novel-in-progress being created in our author's mind; however, being played out right before the audience's eyes. Again, it's up to you (the audience) to figure out where reality stops and imagination begins. Others believe that everything is real. That our publisher is some sort of male gigolo, who has left many scorned women in his path to include our writer, and her novel is her retribution for his actions. There are even others who believe that it's the color red which is splashed throughout this film, that holds the true key to unlocking the mysteries of this film. The speculations go on and on from the absurd, ""that this is a tawdry tale of incest and debauchery""; to the more interesting, ""that Julie and Sarah are one and the same person."" Either way, it's up to the viewer to develop their own conjectures and conclusions. Which I am sure will be different from anyone else, but isn't that why you go to the movies in the first place? To provoke thought, and evoke discussion.Again, the film is not as cut-and-dry as it may first appears, and I highly recommend visiting the message board for the ""Swimming Pool"" on IMDb([...] Just to see how other interpreted the film as well. I have to admit that I am willing to give this film another shot. Maybe you should do the same. I must add that some of the subject matter in this film is VERY adult and sexual in nature. This film could very easy upset those of you who are easily offended.

There is absolutely no sex in this movie; there's a brief oral scene but it's totally bad.  And there's very little nudity of either actress -- more of the younger one, but still not much.  And hidden eroticism?  None whatsoever.This is just a terrible movie.  It tries to be smart but never develops into anything.  I can't believe I fell for the ""unrated"" claim.  I feel like the victim here.Anyway, here's the story: Sarah is a seemingly frigid English writer who goes to her publisher's France summerhome to ""work"" on her next novel.  She meets the publisher's bastard daughter Julie, whose young promiscuity fascinates the middle-aged Sarah.  Unconvincingly, Julie kills a local waiter named Franck who somehow has the hots for the much older Sarah rather than for Julie.  Even more unconvincingly, Sarah helps Julie conceal the crime.  That's that.  I thought Julie would do something to screw up Sarah because the latter had stolen Julie's diary -- Julie says in one scene that ""if someone messes me I'll mess them up back"" -- but no such a twist.  Julie gives Sarah an unfinished novel from her dead mother, Sarah publishes it under her name, and the publisher -- the adulterer and negligent father -- feels betrayed.As you can see, this is a very shallow plot, and the acting is just awful.  It definitely doesn't help that this unrated DVD has few nude scenes to generate even a little bit excitement.  This is worse than 1 star.  Don't bother.  You'll be sorely disappointed.

Rarely have we been treated to script writing, direction, acting, music scoring, and cinematography melded into such a cohesive masterwork.  Francois Ozon is a fine, brave, and very sensitive director who has the good fortune to work with the always solid Charlotte Rampling and the newcomer of incredible promise, Ludivine Sagnier.On the surface the film relates the predicament of Sarah, a writer of murder and crime novels (the very British, uptight Rampling) who is dealing with being a 50ish female without a sensuous life but with a successful writing career.  Writers' block leads to the suggestion by her publisher (whom she sees as a potential lover) that she go to his home in France for peace and quiet - a place to find the 'real woman' within the writer.Up to this point the story is fairly straight forward, but once ensconced in France (in a haven-like home in the country) Sarah begins to observe her surroundings, observe facts and people and gradually transfers those observations into a flowing book that represents resolutions for all her occult desires and needs.  Is Sagnier's Julie (daughter of the publisher who just happens to pop in to stay in the house Sarah believes is her solo retreat) real or is she a figment of Sarah's writer imagination?  And this is where many people who see the film diverge ways: are we watching an actual story or have we entered the fertile mind of a richly gifted writer, breaking out of her Apollonian state into her desparately desired Dionysian world?  The story can be taken on many levels and to push one interpretation as the sole version would be unfair.  It is such a pleasure to see a thinking person's movie in the midst of all the summer commercial noise.

All it takes is a few square yards of peaceful water in a garden, what we call a swimming pool in plain language. This swimming pool is going to attract victims like honey attracts flies and bees, or even foxes and bears. And she is not going to do all that for the only pleasure of doing it, but for the far more satisfying pleasure of turning the experience into a novel that will be discarded by her publisher who is a literary redneck and the infinitely more pleasurable experience of having this discarded novel published by a competitor. Publishers hate competitors by definition, profession and conviction. That's how real life for one who has some imagination can become the subject and the raw material that person is going to turn into a virtual reality that will feel even more real than the real reality we can find in the world and taste or see if we have sensitive eyes or a delicate tongue.

Prior to my viewing of Swimming Pool, I was a typical young American, having only been exposed to the products of the Hollywood machine.Thank God I found something different!The film starts out simple enough, as mystery writer Sarah Morton (the outstanding Charlotte Rampling) heads to her publisher's beautiful country home in France. Eager to begin writing the next installment of her Dorwell crime series, she adjusts to the warm rural atmosphere nicely, that is until her publisher's daughter, Julie, shows up unanounced.Julie, (Ludivine Sagnier) is the exact antithesis of Sarah; a young, femme fatale who has no qualms about drinking, drugging, and sleeping with a differnet man nearly every night. Her intentions and purpose remain unclear for much of the film, as the plot slowly beging to unravel and a series of unexpected twists and turns turn this sleepy picture into a thriller of the highest caliber.The performances throughout the film are top notch, with the lead actresses carrying the film with their flawless chemistry. Both Rampling and Sagnier prove they are far and away superior to many of their peers in Los Angeles, with none of the dreadful over-acting that plague so many these days.The setting and cinematography, while beautiful, also provide important clues as to the plot, as well as the over all theme of the picture.

You'll note the rampant sex and lack of responsibility the little girl had? She's the UK's view of the USA personified.

619097,A1TS8A5XM54QDB,B00005JMIJ,"J. J. Sargent ""jesteratsnetnet""","[625, 688]","This film creeps up on you and is absolutely spellbinding.  It's the simple story of an aging mass-market crime-fiction writer called Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) who rambles off to the French countryside to find relaxation and hopefully inspiration for her next-in-the-series mystery book.  While staying at her publisher's luxurious yet quaint summer retreat, she is confronted by his young daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier). Subsequently, all sorts of wild, unpredictable mischief ensues as the prim and proper Englishwoman clashes with the sexually carefree vixen, who evolves into an unexpected muse to the older woman.My pal Oscar and I have spent the summer watching a number of French films, and one thing we both have learned and agree on is that for the most part, unlike most mainstream American films, they are mostly unpredictable.  SWIMMING POOL is no different.  Just when I thought I had it figured out, a number of odd plot twists move the narrative down an unsettling and unforgiving path until a sensitive and poignant ending reveals tragic truths about life, getting old, and the whimsy of youth that can be difficult for the young to face but which in many ways are empowering to those getting on in the years.  If the film instructs anywhere, it is in the wisdom that we are only as old as we feel.Expect tantalizingly erotic moments, mostly surrounding Ms. Sagnier's natural sensuality.  There's plenty of eye-candy here, and in the viewing, one cannot help but feel strangely connected to the voyeuristic tendencies exhibited by Sarah as her dismal stoicism slowly disintegrates.  Indeed, much of the film's tension and eroticism is experienced through the characters' eyes.Ernest Hemingway said, ""I like to listen. I have learned a great deal from listening carefully. Most people never listen.""  Surely the realm of the author is also to look, and more importantly, to see, as sharply illustrated by Sarah Morton's experience.  In the end, her book may be the better for it -- to the possible chagrin of her publisher.  Thus in some way, the film has much to say about the way literature is produced (through a ""sexual"" creative act) and how authors are oft times stripped of soul, reduced to rote formula, marketed, sold and neglected in pursuit of the next best selling author down the pike.  In the film, Sarah attempts to transcend this trend through her collision with the young Julie (and in her fictional portrayal in the book she is writing).Expect to be somewhat dismayed by the ending, but give it a moment, put the pieces together and it will all make sense.  It's shear pleasure to enjoy a film these days that doesn't fill in the blanks for the audience, and this little gem is a clear winner.  The fine acting betrays the taint of sentimentality.  The sublime beauty and vivid verisimilitude of the setting and cinematography enhance the overall cinematic experience, and in more than one instance will leave the viewer breathless.Some might complain that the film seems to meander, but this is true of many French films I've seen.  This one is no different.  Rather than commit to a rigid narrative form, the film appears more like a painting, with rich textures and colors folded onto the canvas in layers.  Each scene builds on the last, every moment touches the next.  The film is an experience as much as it is a story.",5,tension and eroticism is experienced through the eyes,1060300800,"08 8, 2003",2003,3369,"['film', 'up', 'absolutely', 'spellbinding', 'simple', 'story', 'aging', 'mass-market', 'crime-fiction', 'writer', 'called', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'French', 'countryside', 'find', 'relaxation', 'hopefully', 'inspiration', 'next-in-the-series', 'mystery', 'book', 'staying', 'publisher', 'luxurious', 'yet', 'quaint', 'summer', 'retreat', 'confronted', 'young', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Subsequently', 'sorts', 'wild', 'unpredictable', 'mischief', 'ensues', 'prim', 'proper', 'Englishwoman', 'clashes', 'sexually', 'carefree', 'vixen', 'who', 'unexpected', 'muse', 'older', 'woman.My', 'pal', 'Oscar', 'have', 'spent', 'summer', 'watching', 'number', 'French', 'films', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'learned', 'agree', 'most', 'part', 'most', 'mainstream', 'American', 'films', 'are', 'mostly', 'unpredictable', 'SWIMMING', 'POOL', 'different', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'number', 'odd', 'plot', 'twists', 'move', 'narrative', 'down', 'unsettling', 'unforgiving', 'path', 'sensitive', 'poignant', 'ending', 'reveals', 'tragic', 'truths', 'life', 'getting', 'old', 'whimsy', 'youth', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'young', 'face', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'empowering', 'getting', 'years', 'film', 'instructs', 'anywhere', 'wisdom', 'are', 'only', 'as', 'old', 'feel.Expect', 'tantalizingly', 'erotic', 'moments', 'mostly', 'surrounding', 'Ms.', 'Sagnier', 'natural', 'sensuality', 'plenty', 'eye-candy', 'here', 'viewing', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'strangely', 'connected', 'voyeuristic', 'tendencies', 'exhibited', 'Sarah', 'dismal', 'stoicism', 'slowly', 'Indeed', 'much', 'film', 'tension', 'eroticism', 'experienced', 'characters', 'eyes.Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'said', 'like', 'listen', 'have', 'learned', 'great', 'deal', 'listening', 'carefully', 'Most', 'people', 'never', 'listen', 'Surely', 'realm', 'author', 'also', 'look', 'more', 'importantly', 'see', 'sharply', 'illustrated', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'experience', 'end', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'possible', 'chagrin', 'publisher', 'Thus', 'way', 'film', 'much', 'say', 'way', 'literature', 'produced', 'sexual', 'creative', 'act', 'how', 'authors', 'are', 'oft', 'times', 'stripped', 'soul', 'reduced', 'rote', 'formula', 'marketed', 'sold', 'neglected', 'pursuit', 'next', 'best', 'selling', 'author', 'pike', 'film', 'Sarah', 'transcend', 'trend', 'collision', 'young', 'Julie', 'fictional', 'portrayal', 'book', 'writing', '.Expect', 'be', 'somewhat', 'dismayed', 'ending', 'give', 'moment', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'shear', 'pleasure', 'enjoy', 'film', 'days', ""n't"", 'fill', 'blanks', 'audience', 'little', 'gem', 'clear', 'winner', 'fine', 'acting', 'taint', 'sentimentality', 'sublime', 'beauty', 'vivid', 'verisimilitude', 'setting', 'cinematography', 'enhance', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'more', 'one', 'instance', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'breathless.Some', 'might', 'complain', 'film', 'meander', 'true', 'many', 'French', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'different', 'Rather', 'commit', 'rigid', 'narrative', 'form', 'film', 'more', 'painting', 'rich', 'textures', 'colors', 'folded', 'canvas', 'layers', 'scene', 'last', 'moment', 'next', 'film', 'experience', 'as', 'much', 'story']",Swimming Pool

619104,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00005JMIJ,Just Bill,"[10, 13]","My wife and I watched Swimming Pool last night (just before watching the disturbing 21 Grams -- we were on a Focus studio film fest).This is a strange, hard-to-describe film. The story unfolds very slowly, languidly, but with a beguiling quality that keeps one hooked to the head-scratching end.Many others have reviewed the film in great, eloquent detail. I won't bother to attempt to duplicate their efforts. They know more than I do about French films and French directors.I will say this, though: I'm not totally sure if it's the story that kept us watching or the eroticism. There are plenty of breasts in this film. Lots of sex. Even full frontal nudity on occasion. We watched not sure what would happen next.In other words, the story isn't great, although it's cleverly told. It's the uninhibited erotic nature of the Lolita-like French girl (Julie) that compels one to watch, just as the English writer watches her every move.The ending confused us, although we have a theory as to what it means. SPOILER follows. Don't read unless you want to know the ending.When all was said and done, the movie seemed to take place entirely within the fertile imagination of the English author. In other words, nothing we watched actually happened. No sexpot French girl named Julie (although her publisher's daughter is named Julie). No murder. No drug- and booze-fueled parties. Nothing but a house in the south of France occupied by an imaginative author on retreat.There may be another explanation for what occured in the movie (such as it all really DID happen, but the sexually liberated sex kitten named Julie in the movie wasn't really Julie at all, but someone who arrived and pretended to be Julie, use the facilities, screw half the men in town, kill one, and then leave), but we believe our it's-all-in-the-imagination theory is more plausible.Was the movie satisfying? Somewhat. But it took a long, slow time to arrive at its ending and we're not convinced the ending was a rewarding payoff for all the time spent we spent as voyeurs during the film.Can I recommend this movie? Maybe. If you like quirky films with lots of naked breasts in them, try it. But if you're more of a Die Hard kind of person who needs a shoot-'em-up to stay interested, skip it.",3,"Sensual, erotic, confounding...very, very French",1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,2264,"['wife', 'watched', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'last', 'night', 'just', 'before', 'watching', 'disturbing', '21', 'Grams', 'were', 'Focus', 'studio', 'film', 'fest', '.This', 'strange', 'hard-to-describe', 'film', 'story', 'unfolds', 'very', 'slowly', 'languidly', 'beguiling', 'quality', 'one', 'hooked', 'head-scratching', 'end.Many', 'others', 'have', 'reviewed', 'film', 'great', 'eloquent', 'detail', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'efforts', 'know', 'more', 'do', 'French', 'films', 'French', 'directors.I', 'will', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'sure', 'story', 'kept', 'watching', 'eroticism', 'are', 'plenty', 'breasts', 'film', 'Lots', 'sex', 'Even', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'occasion', 'watched', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'other', 'words', 'story', ""n't"", 'great', 'cleverly', 'told', 'uninhibited', 'erotic', 'nature', 'Lolita-like', 'French', 'girl', 'Julie', 'one', 'watch', 'just', 'English', 'writer', 'move.The', 'ending', 'confused', 'have', 'theory', 'what', 'SPOILER', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'want', 'know', 'ending.When', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'seemed', 'take', 'place', 'entirely', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'English', 'author', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'watched', 'actually', 'happened', 'sexpot', 'French', 'girl', 'named', 'Julie', 'publisher', 'daughter', 'named', 'Julie', 'murder', 'drug-', 'booze-fueled', 'parties', 'Nothing', 'house', 'south', 'France', 'occupied', 'imaginative', 'author', 'retreat.There', 'may', 'be', 'explanation', 'what', 'occured', 'movie', 'such', 'really', 'DID', 'happen', 'sexually', 'liberated', 'sex', 'kitten', 'named', 'Julie', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'Julie', 'someone', 'who', 'arrived', 'pretended', 'be', 'Julie', 'use', 'facilities', 'screw', 'men', 'town', 'kill', 'one', 'then', 'leave', 'believe', ""it's-all-in-the-imagination"", 'theory', 'more', 'plausible.Was', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'Somewhat', 'took', 'long', 'slow', 'time', 'arrive', 'ending', ""'re"", 'not', 'convinced', 'ending', 'was', 'rewarding', 'payoff', 'time', 'spent', 'spent', 'voyeurs', 'film.Can', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'like', 'quirky', 'films', 'lots', 'naked', 'breasts', 'try', ""'re"", 'more', 'Die', 'Hard', 'kind', 'person', 'who', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'stay', 'interested', 'skip']",Swimming Pool

I guess from reading other reviews it has become somewhat infamous due to the nudity.  Putting that aside, it wasn't a bad movie.  It was puzzling though, with a disturbing ending that I still don't quite understand.  I was hoping for more explanation, but there was none!  I can't give more details without spoiling the movie for those who have not seen it.The basic story is mystery novelist Sarah Morten (played by Charlotte Rampling) is middle-aged and burned out and needs a vacation.  Her publisher, John (Charles Dance), offers the use of his house in France for her to relax at.  When she arrives, she really enjoys the house along with the solitude, until John's sexy daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) arrives and stirs things up.  Julie has loud random sex with a different man every night, sunbathes and swims in the pool nude, and basically disrupts the uptight Sarah's life.  Sarah starts to become a sort of voyeur and constantly spies on Julie, watching practically her every move.The ending of this movie is incredibly confusing and the director offers no answers.  I suppose its meant to be a puzzle for you to figure out.  Every time I come up with a plausible explanation, something in the film contradicts that and I have to start from scratch.  I've finally given up and just let it go.The first hour of the film is VERY slow.  I found myself getting bored and even fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it.  After that however, it picks up and becomes much more interesting.  The scenery is excellent - they shot the film at a very beautiful location!

Remember when Julie asks Sarah if she did a lot of smoking pot in her day, and Sarah ruefully nods, replying, ""Yes indeed, I was a part of 'swinging London' back then.""  She sure was!I don't know if that would make SWIMMING POOL make more sense, but it was quite a pleasure to watch it thinking back to GEORGY GIRL, especially the scenes where Julie is having wild uninhibited sex while Sarah puts in her earplugs--then fails to put in her earplugs--and thinking back to the similar scenes in GEORGY GIRL when Rampling had that acrobatic lovemaking sequence with Alan Bates and poor Georgy is trying to think of anything else.  There's also a scene in GEORGY GIRL where both women dance with Bates at the same time, just as there is in SWIMMING POOL when Julie seems to be trying to torment Sarah by inviting her to dance with herself and poor ole Franck.As for what happens in the movie, I have no idea!  SPOILERS AHEAD: I'm torn between thinking that the whole movie takes place in Marcel's head (like Proust)--and also agreeing with whoever dreamed up the theory that the ""plain"" Julia with the braces is actually the daughter of the topless Julie and of the disgusting John, her own father (John Huston?).  If Julie really had a child at age 13, it's possible that the girl in the publisher's office might be her daughter (without knowing it, of course).

There she encounters the other two main characters:  An old swimming pool and her publisher's sensuous French daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier).  Sarah's pastoral serenity is soon disrupted as she becomes involved in the girl's unconventional and mysterious life.I loved this movie.  It has a leisurely pace and there is little in the way of action, and yet I found it mesmerizing.  The hypnotic intimacy we experience as we watch Sarah write her new book is utterly compelling.  There is an vague feeling of unease and fear from the moment Sarah arrives in France.  While all is outwardly calm and controlled, events gradually build to a thrilling climax and beyond that, an ending that makes the viewer reevaluate the entire movie.  The excellent musical score matches the enigmatic mood of the film.Charlotte Rampling is perfect as the proper and cranky old maid who lets her hair down in a big way, once she is under the spell of the luscious Provence countryside.  Ludivine Sagnier (seen recently as the delightful Tinkerbell in Peter Pan) is well-cast as the in-your-face, amoral young stranger who changes Sarah's life.

I watched it once, didn't pay much attention to the twist ending, and didn't think about it again.Then I saw it a couple more times and paid attention to the ending. Now I find it leaves me with similar feelings and questions I had after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to wit: was it real or Memorex?For those of you too young to remember it, the final reference is the tag line from an ad for Memorex tapes. That was back when people actually used audio tape to make copies of audio recordings.Anyway, this movie -- about an English author that goes to a home in France to find her creativity and instead becomes embroiled in sex and murder -- now intrigues me more than the first few times I saw it. I still enjoy the way the plot unravels like a single thread from a ball of twine. I also enjoy the heavy sexual content and the way the camera pans -- you might says ogles -- the young woman that plays the second lead.It's that ending that continues to confound me, however. I still don't know if the content of the film itself actually happenened or whether it was merely the contents of the author's new book...and I didn't learn that until the end. The book the writer hands her boss at the end doesn't seem to verify that.For me, this movie is a mystery within a mystery that seems to get better the more times I see it. I don't often see a new film that intrigues me so, nor do I often leave a film not exactly knowing what I just saw and being unable to completely reconcile its parts, especially one with as much eye candy as ""Swimming Pool"" has to offer.",4,A mystery within a mystery,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,1664,"['Amazon', 'recommended', 'French', 'erotic', 'mystery', 'bought', 'watched', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'twist', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'saw', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'paid', 'attention', 'ending', 'Now', 'find', 'similar', 'feelings', 'questions', 'had', 'seeing', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'wit', 'was', 'real', 'Memorex', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'final', 'reference', 'tag', 'line', 'ad', 'Memorex', 'tapes', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'people', 'actually', 'used', 'audio', 'tape', 'make', 'copies', 'audio', 'recordings.Anyway', 'movie', 'English', 'author', 'home', 'France', 'find', 'creativity', 'instead', 'becomes', 'embroiled', 'sex', 'murder', 'now', 'more', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'saw', 'still', 'enjoy', 'way', 'plot', 'unravels', 'single', 'thread', 'ball', 'twine', 'also', 'enjoy', 'heavy', 'sexual', 'content', 'way', 'camera', 'might', 'ogles', 'young', 'woman', 'second', 'lead.It', 'ending', 'confound', 'however', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'content', 'film', 'actually', 'happenened', 'was', 'merely', 'contents', 'author', 'new', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'end', 'book', 'writer', 'boss', 'end', ""n't"", 'seem', 'verify', 'that.For', 'movie', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'get', 'better', 'more', 'times', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'new', 'film', 'so', 'do', 'often', 'leave', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'knowing', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'being', 'unable', 'completely', 'reconcile', 'parts', 'especially', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'eye', 'candy', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'offer']",Swimming Pool
619113,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMIJ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","I would say that ""Swimming Pool"" is more sensual than it is erotic, although ultimately the nudity in this film is secondary to the story.  Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a British writer of crime fiction who apparently find no joy in her writing, her popularity, her publisher, or any the idea that any other writer might be writing something worth reading as well.  Everyone is waiting for the next installment about her detective and she in uninspired.  So her publisher (Charles Dance) offers her the use of his villa in France as a place where she can retreat and come up with a new book.  Once there Sarah explores the house, taking notice of the leaf covered swimming pool in back, and visits the nearby village.  She also begins to write, and although we have no idea what she is writing about, Sarah seems productive and happy.Then Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), the daughter of her publisher shows up.  She is an unexpected guest, not only because Sarah assumed she would be alone, but because she did not know he had a daughter.  If anything, Sarah has been waiting for him to show up so that she can get in a little relaxation with her rest.  Instead Julie shows up and violates not only Sarah's privacy but here sense of propriety.  Julie tends walk around topless by the pool and apparently shows no sense of discrimination in bringing home men to sleep with.  We know Sarah disapproves of such practices, but this does not stop her from watching Julie, whether she is swimming in the villa's pool or making love to some strange man.  It then becomes clear that not only is Julie becoming a part of Sarah's novel, but that something is going to happen; Philippe Rombi's score for this 2003 film foreshadows this even if the plot does not arouse our suspicions.""Swimming Pool"" is usually described as being a thriller, but that strikes me as being off the mark.  It is more of a mystery, but in a subtle way, which explains why it is difficult to talk about director Franois Ozon's film without giving away too much.  This is the sort of film where you are going to have to go back and at least watch the end of the film again, if not the entire thing from start to finish, to make sure you understand what happened.  You might actually have to do it more than one before you figure things out and are satisfied with your understanding of the film.  What helped me out in untangling this film was that for most of it I kept asking what Sarah was writing.  There was clearly a connection between what was happening and what Sarah was writing, but I kept waiting for Ozon to show us what that was, which, in the end, only goes to show how much I was fooled by this film.  In this regard the film ends up being surprising rather than shocking, in keeping with the subtlety and sensuality of the film.Be aware that there are two different version of ""Swimming Pool"" available on DVD: R-rated and Unrated.  The difference between the two is that there is full frontal nudity in the unrated version and there are two key things to know about this.  First, this is by no means gratuitous nudity.  I would go so far as to say the nudity was actually character driven in this film.  Second, I heard about all the compliments Diane Keaton was paid for being so daring in ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and I have to assume that many of those people simply did not see ""Swimming Pool"" even though in terms of length and context the two scenes could hardly be more different.",4,Franois Ozon's subtle and strangely surprising mystery,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,3472,"['would', 'say', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'more', 'sensual', 'erotic', 'ultimately', 'nudity', 'film', 'secondary', 'story', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'British', 'writer', 'crime', 'fiction', 'who', 'apparently', 'find', 'joy', 'writing', 'popularity', 'publisher', 'idea', 'other', 'writer', 'might', 'be', 'writing', 'something', 'worth', 'reading', 'as', 'well', 'Everyone', 'waiting', 'next', 'installment', 'detective', 'uninspired', 'publisher', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'use', 'villa', 'France', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'retreat', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'book', 'Once', 'Sarah', 'house', 'taking', 'notice', 'leaf', 'covered', 'swimming', 'pool', 'back', 'nearby', 'village', 'also', 'write', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'writing', 'about', 'Sarah', 'productive', 'happy.Then', 'Julie', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'daughter', 'publisher', 'up', 'unexpected', 'guest', 'not', 'only', 'Sarah', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'alone', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'had', 'daughter', 'anything', 'Sarah', 'been', 'waiting', 'show', 'up', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'relaxation', 'rest', 'Instead', 'Julie', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'Sarah', 'privacy', 'here', 'sense', 'propriety', 'Julie', 'walk', 'topless', 'pool', 'apparently', 'sense', 'discrimination', 'bringing', 'home', 'men', 'sleep', 'know', 'Sarah', 'disapproves', 'such', 'practices', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', 'Julie', 'swimming', 'villa', 'pool', 'making', 'love', 'strange', 'man', 'then', 'clear', 'not', 'only', 'Julie', 'becoming', 'part', 'Sarah', 'novel', 'something', 'going', 'happen', 'Philippe', 'Rombi', 'score', '2003', 'film', 'even', 'plot', 'not', 'arouse', 'suspicions', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'usually', 'described', 'being', 'thriller', 'being', 'off', 'mark', 'more', 'mystery', 'subtle', 'way', 'why', 'difficult', 'talk', 'director', 'Franois', 'Ozon', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'sort', 'film', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'least', 'watch', 'end', 'film', 'again', 'not', 'entire', 'thing', 'start', 'finish', 'make', 'sure', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'do', 'more', 'one', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'are', 'satisfied', 'understanding', 'film', 'What', 'helped', 'out', 'untangling', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'kept', 'asking', 'what', 'Sarah', 'was', 'writing', 'was', 'clearly', 'connection', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'what', 'Sarah', 'was', 'writing', 'kept', 'waiting', 'Ozon', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'end', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'fooled', 'film', 'regard', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'surprising', 'rather', 'shocking', 'keeping', 'subtlety', 'sensuality', 'film.Be', 'aware', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'version', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'available', 'DVD', 'R-rated', 'Unrated', 'difference', 'two', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'unrated', 'version', 'are', 'two', 'key', 'things', 'know', 'First', 'means', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'nudity', 'was', 'actually', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'Second', 'heard', 'compliments', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'was', 'paid', 'being', 'so', 'daring', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'have', 'assume', 'many', 'people', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'even', 'terms', 'length', 'context', 'two', 'scenes', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'more', 'different']",Swimming Pool

On the other hand, to some extent, our experience is that of voyeurs.There are two main characters, one a girl, one a woman, each, apparently, the opposite of the other.The girl is a teenager, supple, soft, pink, luscious, curvaceous, a free spirit.The woman is mature, meager, tight, ordered and oh-so-neat, repressed.Yet it may be that the psychology of the girl matches the appearance of the woman, in that her freedom has really only one outlet, and one she may not really control: sex.While the psychology of the woman matches the appearance of the girl, in that her imagination is free and wild. (Is it her imagination? Or ours?)You have to sit through the entire movie to have these thoughts. Through the double twists.Three things in the movie struck me as outright wrong though, each a small detail.1. We see a novel's manuscript pages both on a computer and as printouts. It is single spaced, and there is no separation between paragraphs, save when a paragraph ends on a short line. I thought MS pages were double spaced with extra space or an indent to separate paragraphs. We see her editing them. Normally double-spacing facilitates markup.2. There is a dance scene. We had learned that the woman had gone through a kind of hippie period. Yet she doesn't really know how to dance.3. She and her male publisher discuss a new work of hers and their comments are on the level of (though this is not actual dialogue): ""It's your worst."" ""No it's my best."" ""Worst."" ""Best.""

A young blonde with a narrow triangular face and classic nose (when shot in profile you'll maybe think she has features that really belong on the front of a coin), she lives a messy life and upsets the orderly Rampling more than somewhat. She uncovers the swimming pool and skinnydips about among the leaves that have collected. At this point the movie comes to life for a while. Probably you'll enjoy the scenes in which Ms. Sagnier romps around in various states of undress.Eventually, there is (perhaps) a murder.

In their films, Americans LOVE to explode things, speed things up, steal a whole lot of money and kill a mess of people.  Contrast this with, among other things, this astoundingly brilliant French film by director Francois Ozon.What makes this film so amazing is the multiple layers of ambiguity and meaning that so subtlely pervade it.  Ostensibly about a successful London-based writer of crime fiction, Sarah Morton, the story takes some intriguing turns when she decides to use her publisher's house in France as a retreat to focus on her next book.  While the initial intent is to write another in her series of crime novels, what transpires is a series of events so compelling, different, and unusual that the end result is very far removed from what Sarah, John (her publisher) or even the audience expects to happen.The catalyst for this series of events is Julie who claims to be John's daughter, showing up unexpectedly, initially rattling Sarah enough to complain intensely to John in a hurried whispered message in a France-to-England phone call.  Julie is Sarah's opposite:  Sarah's mature; Julie's young.  Sarah's frustrated; Julie has plenty of sex with whomever she wants.  Sarah's clothes are long and tight; Julie's are short and loose. Sarah's hair is short and tight; Julie's is long and loose.Swimming Pool is an apt title for this film--it's symbolic of what Sarah wants that Julie has.  When you think about what this actually means, you begin to question exactly what is going on here:  is Julie really John's daughter, or is she someone else?  What does Sarah really want--to publish another crime fiction novel or to do something she has not done in a long time (or maybe not at all)?  And what exactly is that?What is the creative process after all? Does it constantly change, moving like a randy lioness from one idea to another--like lovers night after night--mating/creating, mating/creating?  After viewing this film, my friend and I had a long discussion about it and could not agree on a number of points.  This is not a film to take lightly.  It is a film you should see at least once, more likely twice, and think about.  It is a film that merits special attention for the psychological nuances that imbue every frame.Very highly recommended, and one of the best films of the year.",5,A true masterwork of French cinema,1060387200,"08 9, 2003",2003,2387,"['not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'American', 'film', 'NOT', 'subtlety', 'films', 'Americans', 'LOVE', 'explode', 'things', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'steal', 'whole', 'lot', 'money', 'kill', 'mess', 'people', 'Contrast', 'other', 'things', 'astoundingly', 'brilliant', 'French', 'film', 'director', 'Francois', 'Ozon.What', 'film', 'so', 'amazing', 'multiple', 'layers', 'ambiguity', 'meaning', 'so', 'subtlely', 'pervade', 'Ostensibly', 'successful', 'London-based', 'writer', 'crime', 'fiction', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'story', 'intriguing', 'turns', 'when', 'use', 'publisher', 'house', 'France', 'retreat', 'focus', 'next', 'book', 'initial', 'intent', 'write', 'series', 'crime', 'novels', 'what', 'series', 'events', 'so', 'compelling', 'different', 'unusual', 'end', 'result', 'very', 'far', 'removed', 'what', 'Sarah', 'John', 'publisher', 'even', 'audience', 'happen.The', 'catalyst', 'series', 'events', 'Julie', 'who', 'be', 'John', 'daughter', 'showing', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'initially', 'rattling', 'Sarah', 'enough', 'complain', 'intensely', 'John', 'hurried', 'whispered', 'message', 'France-to-England', 'phone', 'call', 'Julie', 'Sarah', 'opposite', 'Sarah', 'mature', 'Julie', 'young', 'Sarah', 'frustrated', 'Julie', 'plenty', 'sex', 'whomever', 'Sarah', 'clothes', 'are', 'long', 'tight', 'Julie', 'are', 'short', 'loose', 'Sarah', 'hair', 'short', 'tight', 'Julie', 'long', 'loose.Swimming', 'Pool', 'apt', 'title', 'film', 'symbolic', 'what', 'Sarah', 'Julie', 'When', 'think', 'what', 'actually', 'begin', 'question', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'Julie', 'really', 'John', 'daughter', 'someone', 'else', 'What', 'Sarah', 'really', 'want', 'publish', 'crime', 'fiction', 'novel', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'done', 'long', 'time', 'maybe', 'not', 'what', 'exactly', 'What', 'creative', 'process', 'constantly', 'change', 'moving', 'randy', 'lioness', 'one', 'idea', 'lovers', 'night', 'night', 'mating/creating', 'mating/creating', 'viewing', 'film', 'friend', 'had', 'long', 'discussion', 'could', 'not', 'agree', 'number', 'points', 'not', 'film', 'take', 'lightly', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'more', 'likely', 'twice', 'think', 'film', 'special', 'attention', 'psychological', 'nuances', 'imbue', 'frame.Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year']",Swimming Pool

It's offbeat and erotic and there are some scenes that will echo in my mind for a long time.  It stars Charlotte Rampling as a British mystery writer whose editor lends her his home in the south of France for a much needed vacation.  The place is beautiful and she is soon writing away on her laptop computer and enjoying the beauty of the grounds as well as the local village.  Suddenly, her peace is shattered by the appearance of the French born daughter of her editor, played by Ludivine Sagnier, who is young, beautiful and wild.  Naturally it's impossible for the writer to continue her peaceful vacation, and there is immediate conflict, especially since the young woman swims nude, walks around topless and brings home different men every night for one-night stands.  The two women are just beginning to resolve their differences however, when they suddenly have to deal with the consequences of an act of violence which turns the story into a totally different direction which made my heart beat with anxiety as I moved my chair closer to the screen in order not to miss one bit of the exciting developments.  I can understand why the ending might be confusing to some.  In my opinion though, it brought the whole film to a satisfactory conclusion.This is a really fine film.  It's totally original and steeped in mystery.  It's an excellent script without a wasted word and I loved the cinematography of the lovely French town. The roles for the two actresses were certainly challenging but they made their characters real and sympathetic and I could identify with both of them.

You may find that in this movie, but there is so much more that would be missed by shallow idiots looking for a nude scenes.  The movie follows in the footsteps of Hitchcock, but I don't think that Hitchcock was this racy.  Charlotte Rampling plays Sarah Morton, a British murder mystery novelist, who travels to her publisher's house in France for peace and quiet.  She finds exactly that until Julie, the publishers daughter, arrives, and everything is thrown into chaos.  At first, Charlotte is angered by Julie's presence, and her bringing home, and violating, every man she meets.  But soon, Sarah becomes intrigued by Julie, and starts to write furiously.  The movie continues with a very strong push and pull between the two characters, and we soon start to unravel the mystery that is Julie.  But, be prepared to be shocked at the end of this movie.  The twist is extremely good, but it needs some deliberation.  Don't turn off the movie and forget about it, because you won't be satisfied.  Try to figure it out.  There really can only be one explanation for the ending, but I'll leave it up to you to figure it out.  The wonderful thing about this movie is the extreme depth of the characters.

In a typically unsanguine way they kind-of sort-of wanna see a porno and take a liberalized date to see it in the hopes of getting sort-of lucky afterwards.  But to actually just get a porno and watch it... no.  That is too lowbrow precisely because it is too obviously interesting.  What liberal intellectual types must do is go to the local art house theater whenever something vaguely foreign is playing.

619123,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JMIJ,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[19, 22]","Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a British mystery writer at the very end of her creative rope. Hoping to recharge her creative batteries, Sarah takes off to stay at her publisher's house in rural France for a long holiday. Once there, Sarah finds that the open air and countryside agree with her, and  soon, she begins writing again. Enter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier from Ozon's 8 Women), the publisher's young daughter, who has come to stay at the house as well. While Sarah tries desperately to work, her interest in Julie's volcanic life, both sexual and personal, boils over and begins to consume her writing and sanity.Refreshingly, `Swimming Pool' is a kind of old fashioned sexually themed mystery that few attempt anymore. The film comes from the mind of Francois Ozon, famed French filmmaker, and one who has made it a point to keep his career fresh with ever changing genre explorations (`Under The Sand,' `Water Drops On Burning Rocks'). His last film was the certifiable everything-but-the-kitchen-sink musical/mystery `8 Women,' and showcased that even when the material isn't all that sturdy to support Ozon's insanity, he still can create some compelling cinema. This is his first English language film and it is definitely a refreshing change from all the lackluster summer films.`Swimming Pool' takes place in a creative dream state in which reality can be hard to distinguish from the creative process. Ozon has decided to wrap a formulaic murder plot around this theme, taking the audience on a journey in which nothing is quite what it seems. To achieve full audience attention, the picture is also peppered with liberal nudity (Sangnier's character requires it) and heated sexual situations, mixing with the other elements to form an engrossing mystery which, eventually, has no resolution. As the film progresses, Ozon gets more abstract with his ideas, at the same time dropping clues to where this is all headed. `Swimming Pool' does have moments where it's utterly intoxicating and mysterious. There are some brilliant moments of suspense that would make Hitchcock proud.Reuniting with her `Under The Sand' director, legendary actress Charlotte Rampling seems to have found her acting niche with Ozon. This is a very mannered performance, with the audience following Sarah as she metamorphoses from an uptight snob, making careful choices in food, men, and ideals, to the laid back woman she becomes with Julie, partaking in drugs, friendliness, and voyeurism. Rampling connects the dots without skipping a beat, making Ozon's eventual explanation for all these events somewhat of a let down. She's great in a film that ultimately fails her, but it's often worth the time just to see how Rampling and Ozon get themselves out of these bizarre situations.This is a wonderful thriller, recommended to those who like to think and enjoy long discussions about the film right afterward.

619125,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005JMIJ,Matthew Gladney,"[22, 27]","""Swimming Pool"" is one of those films which is done a disservice by a movie trailer, or by simply stating what its plot is about. Yes, I can tell you the gist of it, but there is so much more to the film, most notably in the way that it is presented, and in which its unusual story unfolds. It was most certainly a unique film-going experience for me.The refined Charlotte Rampling stars as Sarah Morton, a successful British mystery writer who is suffering from an extreme case of writer's block. She visits the office of her publisher, John Bosload (played with pompous reserve by Charles Dance), and he offers her his French summer home. It is in an idyllic location, secluded from the rest of the world, and yet is only a short walk from the heart of the nearest village. Sarah snaps up the offer.The French retreat proves to be just what the writer needed, and in no time Sarah is feverishly click-clacking away at her word processor. Soon, however, her tranquil setting is ruined by the arrival of Bosload's daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), and then the real fun begins. To tell you any more of the plot would be to take away from your enjoyment of the film. Watching how it all unfolds is part of the pleasure. Needless to say, the film takes some bizarre turns.The characters in ""Swimming Pool"" are their own interesting separate entities. Most of our information about Sarah Morton comes from watching her react to situations, whether they be the fresh, serene surroundings of the French home, or the rude, over-sexed goings-on of the young Julie. We are given dabs of knowledge about her past every now and then, but just enough to make us wonder about her more. Julie is an enigma, as well. She definitely lives through her body. She uses it to get her way with men, to try and bluster the taciturn Sarah, and to please her own self. She appears to be quite forthcoming about her life, but yet you suspect that there is much, much more to her than meets the eye. I even wanted to know more about Sarah's publisher, John Bosload. His life is touched upon somewhat, but just enough to make you more curious.It is true that ""Swimming Pool"" is very much about presentation. Yes, it has a plot which develops, but I was fascinated more by *how* it developed. From the film's leisurely pace whilst Sarah takes-in her French surroundings, to the erotic turn it takes once Julie arrives on the scene, to the dark and mysterious corners that it explores a little later, ""Swimming Pool"" doesn't for a moment pretend to pander to you. You are never lulled into a feeling of boredom or predictability. I would be reticent at this point if I failed to mention that this film is quite explicit with its sexuality. If this bothers you, then do not go see it. We are given full shots of Ludivine Sagnier lying nude by the pool, copulating with numerous Frenchmen, and we even see one of the Frenchmen in a state of arousal. Also, though most of the dialogue is in English, there are spots in it which are spoken in French (with English sub-titles). If you are fine with this, and can continue to enjoy the film for what it is, then I highly recommend it.As I stated at the start of this review, ""Swimming Pool"" was a unique movie-going experience. The film is part art-house flick, part soft-core exploitation, and part mystery. Kudos are in order for writer and director Francois Ozon for bringing those elements so exquisitely together.

619126,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JMIJ,Matthew Horner,"[5, 6]","""Swimming Pool"" is a complex psychological thriller for adults. It is French director Francois Ozon's first English-language movie, but it remains essential a French film. It moves at a slower pace and is more ambiguous than most American movies. The ending will delight those who like a puzzle and infuriate those who don't because it forces you to think through all that you have just seen. [Hints: The clues are there. There is only one possible answer.]Sarah Morton [Charlotte Rampling] is a successful crime novelist who is facing both a writer's block and a midlife crisis. Her publisher [Charles Dance] suggests that she relax by spending a few weeks in his home in the French countryside. She accepts his offer, and once in France, she is delighted by the charming house, its beautiful swimming pool and gardens, and the neighboring village. Almost immediately, she begins to write again. Her routine and her happiness are interrupted by the arrival of the publisher's teenage daughter, Julie [Ludivine Sagnier], who loves to party and to bring home a different man every night. At first, the two women get along like cats and dogs. Later, Julie inspires Sarah to begin a new novel unlike any she as ever written before, and Julie finds that Sarah is not nearly as repressed as she appears to be. They start to bond, but one night something improbable and ugly occurs. It is an event that changes everything. Or does it?Charlotte Rampling is one of the most admired actresses of her generation. She is not that well known for several reasons, the most important, perhaps, being that she has always preferred to be an actress rather than a star. Unlike other performers, her strength lies not in what she says [dialog] but in what she does [body language].

One only has to study Sarah's face as she watches her editor greet his daughter in his office. Her expression says it all. I think Charlotte Rampling was a knockout in this beautifully realised psychological study. So few actresses can say this much with their eyes &amp; yet still barely move a muscle. Watch closely as her English resolve slowly disappears as she produces what will undoubtedly be her greatest work.

619130,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JMIJ,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[191, 229]","Intelligent, expertly written, extremely well acted and story-lined for the adults, ""The Swimming Pool"" is Francois Ozon's first film in English. Ozon has no trouble maneuvering his way around and into a difficult, non-linear story, especially after seeing his ""Under the Sand"" and ""8 Women."" And he proves it once again here.Charlotte Rampling plays Sarah Morton, a successful English detective novelist who is experiencing a bad case of writer's block. Her publisher, John Bosload (Charles Dance) offers her his French Country home for a vacation to re-energize her writing juices. And it works as Sarah begins a new book. But then Bosloads daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) shows up with the nubile sex appeal of a young Brigitte Bardot. And basically all hell breaks loose.In her early scenes with Bosload, Rampling plays Sarah with an outward cool, yet it is obvious she is repressing a strong attraction to him. At this point Rampling is the picture of English spinsterhood: all bottled up in a buttoned to the neck cardigan and cinched up in sensible shoes. But when Julie arrives on the scene with her gorgeous, hair, eyes and body, Sarah cannot help herself it seems as she spews a ghastly amount of venom on her. For Sarah, Julie is not only a disturbance; she's an interloper, not only of her writing but also of her placid, solitary life. Julie is alive, vibrant, and outwardly sexual: all the things that Sarah isn't. It is reminiscent of those nature films in which the reigning, older Lioness must prove her superiority by clawing and humiliating the younger Lioness. Both Rampling and Sagnier go at each other in such a fury and with such conviction that you can feel the undeniable and tangible heat of all the passion, hate and jealousy emanating from their scenes together.Ozon calls upon several other films for inspiration but as Sarah becomes more interested in Julie as a subject for a book, he calls upon Bergman and specifically ""Persona""and it's story of transferred personalities and character traits.""The Swimming Pool"" is a sly, immensely enjoyable yet persuasively adult film.

I realize--as other reviewers have pointed out--that Ozon isn't so much interested in making a straight-ahead thriller as in delineating the weird psychological interplay between Sarah, a brittle, bitchy crime novelist, and Julie, a free-living younger woman. Even so, the plot twists--such as they are--seem insufficient to justify the movie, particularly since Sarah and Julie turn out to be thoroughly, irredeemably repellent. At the end, I felt cheated at having been forced to spend 100 minutes of my life with two such disgusting people. I must admit that Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier give their all to making Sarah and Julie as interesting as possible.

Burned out on writing and tired of the climate in London, she accepts an invitation from her publisher, John (Charles Dance), to spend some time relaxing at his villa in Southern France. The change of scenery gets her creative juices flowing, but shortly after Sarah has settled in, John's daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) turns up with plans to stay. At first Sarah is annoyed by Julie's daring and promiscuous lifestyle. But gradually Sarah takes an interest in the young woman and allows herself to be sucked into Sarah's emotional intrigues.There is a lot that I would love to say about this film, but the nature of &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is such that I can say very little that will not spoil the film for those who have not yet seen it. &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is an unusual and ingenious variety of mystery. I will say this much: Pay close attention. Things are not as the seem.Franois Ozon's screenplay may be the best of 2003. It's certainly the most sinuous. I'm sure that some will say -not without some justification- that it's too clever for its own good. My one reservation about &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is that it may be too subtle. Too much of the audience is left thinking that the events of the film are to be taken at face value. And the film doesn't begin to make sense if taken at face value. The audience is given enough information to figure out what has transpired. -But just enough. We do have to figure it out for ourselves. Normally, a film of this kind would explain itself a few scenes before the end. But Franois Ozon has chosen not to spell anything out for his audience. I enjoyed the puzzle. It's gratifying once it clicks and everything makes sense. But I fear &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is too esoteric for wide audience appeal. I give it an enthusiastic recommendation, though. &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is one of the most original, clever, and intriguing movies that I've seen.The DVD: Previews are unfortunately unavoidable. Bonus features include one theatrical trailer and deleted scenes. Most of the deleted scenes are entirely inconsequential, but one actually confuses matters, so I don't recommend them. Dubbing is available in French. Subtitles are available in French, Spanish, and English. I sure wish there were an interview with writer/director Franois Ozon, but no such luck.

Sure enough,she begins slowly to settle in her new surroundings,relishing a change that seems to do the trick,when her publisher's French daughter Julie, again with all the cliches and its trimmings ,moves in unexpected.Morton is at first very annoyed at this unseeming intrusion and does not take quite well to her new housemate (or villa-mate more like it). Julie is also bemused but detached from this 'old english friend of papa'.Personality clashes soon surface between the two women,one that would slowly change to curiosty with Julie's numerous explicit one night stands, and her shady and mysterious past. Curiosity will give way to invesigation, intrigue, up to support and collaboration. The change in the two women's relationship is complex,and totatlly intriguing, because on one hand the air of mystery is never lifted up to the explosive twist at the end, and because on the other despite the intended cliches of the two nationalities characters,it is about two different women with unique personalities, their apparent differences only lead to a strange bond, and the two will end up helping each other directly and indirectly in more ways than they could have ever imagined.The end which I will not spoil, will leave many questions unanswered..Who was Julie really? Why was the publisher except for the very beginning and end so elusive? what was reality and what was the figment of Morton's imagination? These will not beg for an answer..because it does not matter as much as the fact that Morton smiles at the end..a satisfying, fulfilled smile, one that is a confirmation of the beginning of a new chapter in her life, without the psychological, emotional and creative dilemmas that haunted her througout her professional and personal life.This is superb writing from Ozon,who also delighted me with his visual sensitivities, his gentle camera work, and the frames and pans he choses, poetry to the eyes.There is a lot of nudity in the film. Sagnier's body is filmed in close details from tip to toe, while Rampling all nude scene is not only a brave decision by this great actress to take,and shows the trust and understanding she has with her director, but it is filmed (and indeed all the nudity and sex scenes in the film) in such a way that instead of being tantalized, the viewer will come to believe that it is the most natural thing.I would of course advise to buy the 'unrated' version, not because of the extra flesh content, and the one particularily daring scene by the pool at night, but because somehow these scenes are an integral part of who Julie is, and the shocking value that move Sarah Morton,and this is vital to the plot.The auteur cinema is far and few in between these days, and when films and artists like Ozon present us with the fruit of their creativity, it should be a must see, a great addition to our library and a visual and as importantly a mind journey that will not forget easily.",5,"Mystery, Style and Charlotte Rampling's Smile.",1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,3939,"['love', 'Swimming', 'Pool.Though', 'have', 'admit', 'opinion', 'biased', 'several', 'reasons', 'love', 'French', 'Cinema', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'films', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'think', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'one', 'freshest', 'sexiest', 'most', 'talented', 'newcomers.You', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'movie', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'regardless', 'reviews', 'be', 'negative', 'positive', 'read', 'beforehand', 'sure', 'enough', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.After', 'huge', 'success', '8', 'Femmes', 'was', 'matter', 'time', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'made', 'obligatory', 'English', 'language', 'movie.And', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'approach', 'venture', 'collaborate', 'two', 'most', 'favourite', 'actresses', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'second', 'Ozon', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'third', '.Now', 'story', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'typical', 'English', 'crime', 'novelist', 'cliches', 'trimmings', 'publisher', 'house', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'south', 'France', 'peace', 'quite', 'sorely', 'start', 'new', 'book', 'Sure', 'enough', 'slowly', 'settle', 'new', 'surroundings', 'relishing', 'change', 'do', 'trick', 'when', 'publisher', 'French', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'again', 'cliches', 'trimmings', 'moves', 'unexpected.Morton', 'first', 'very', 'annoyed', 'unseeming', 'intrusion', 'not', 'take', 'quite', 'well', 'new', 'housemate', 'villa-mate', 'more', 'Julie', 'also', 'bemused', 'detached', ""'old"", 'english', 'friend', ""papa'.Personality"", 'clashes', 'soon', 'surface', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'would', 'slowly', 'change', 'curiosty', 'Julie', 'numerous', 'explicit', 'one', 'night', 'shady', 'mysterious', 'past', 'Curiosity', 'will', 'give', 'way', 'invesigation', 'intrigue', 'up', 'support', 'collaboration', 'change', 'two', 'women', 'relationship', 'complex', 'totatlly', 'intriguing', 'one', 'hand', 'air', 'mystery', 'never', 'lifted', 'up', 'explosive', 'twist', 'end', 'because', 'other', 'intended', 'cliches', 'two', 'nationalities', 'characters', 'two', 'different', 'women', 'unique', 'personalities', 'apparent', 'differences', 'only', 'lead', 'strange', 'bond', 'two', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'helping', 'other', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'more', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined.The', 'end', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered..Who', 'was', 'Julie', 'really', 'Why', 'was', 'publisher', 'very', 'beginning', 'end', 'so', 'elusive', 'what', 'was', 'reality', 'was', 'figment', 'Morton', 'imagination', 'will', 'not', 'beg', 'answer..because', 'not', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'Morton', 'end..a', 'satisfying', 'fulfilled', 'smile', 'one', 'confirmation', 'beginning', 'new', 'chapter', 'life', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'creative', 'dilemmas', 'haunted', 'professional', 'personal', 'life.This', 'superb', 'writing', 'Ozon', 'who', 'also', 'delighted', 'visual', 'sensitivities', 'gentle', 'camera', 'work', 'frames', 'pans', 'poetry', 'eyes.There', 'lot', 'nudity', 'film', 'Sagnier', 'body', 'filmed', 'close', 'details', 'tip', 'toe', 'Rampling', 'nude', 'scene', 'not', 'only', 'brave', 'decision', 'great', 'actress', 'take', 'trust', 'understanding', 'director', 'filmed', 'indeed', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'way', 'instead', 'being', 'tantalized', 'viewer', 'will', 'come', 'believe', 'most', 'natural', 'thing.I', 'would', 'course', 'advise', 'buy', ""'unrated"", 'version', 'not', 'extra', 'flesh', 'content', 'one', 'particularily', 'daring', 'scene', 'pool', 'night', 'somehow', 'scenes', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'who', 'Julie', 'shocking', 'value', 'move', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'vital', 'plot.The', 'auteur', 'cinema', 'far', 'few', 'days', 'when', 'films', 'artists', 'Ozon', 'present', 'fruit', 'creativity', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'see', 'great', 'addition', 'library', 'visual', 'as', 'importantly', 'mind', 'journey', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'easily']",Swimming Pool

619139,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B00005JMIJ,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[3, 4]","Where to go with this movie?  Where to go with this review?  By the end of French director Francois Ozon's ""The Swimming Pool"" (was there any doubt the name would be French) you may be asking yourself, ""where exactly did this movie go?""  It's sounds like a confusing way to start off a review, but stick with me here, I'll explain.British mystery writer Sarah Morton is a bit slow getting her latest detective series book written.  In fact Sarah Morton's life is a little slow as her staunch and staid British persona leaves her little enjoyment in life.  She is in a rut.  So her publisher lets her borrow the French villa to spend the summer months writing, eating at a French boulangerie, and generally soaking in the sun of which there seems to be a shortage of in London (go figure).  All is well and good and you will be thinking to yourself, ""geez this movie is slow...I wonder if I can make it to the end of it.""  Stick with it, the second half gets much better with the introduction of the Brit publisher's daughter (or is she?).  Confused still, stick with me.So Julie, previously aforementioned daughter, is pretty much a little hellion with the local townsfolks of the male persuasion.  She is a giving person and ends up sharing her generous spirit and ample good looks with a majority of the guys she paints the town with much to Sarah's initial chagrin.  As it turns out Sarah is a child of the London's swinging sixties scene (who would have thunk it), and is at least hip to smoking a jay and getting jiggy (dancing that is...in a truly funny scene) with the aforementioned boulangerie's waiter that we the viewer can tell she most subtly has the hots for.So Sarah eventually comes out of her shell.  Julie keeps her shirt on for a few scenes.  The French waiter (not to give away too much here) isn't, how would you say, well, in the last scenes of the movie and the previously slow and dragging movie becomes an intriguing one indeed.  Art imitates life (or does it?) as Sarah's writer's block jumps off the screen like a pair of fried frog's legs and she is inspired by Julie's persona that she writes a book.  Julie spends a good deal of time topless by the film's nom de guerre swimming pool.  The waiter kind of ends up just laying around in the yard and we the viewer are totally confused by the end when another Julie shows up in the Brit publisher's London office.  If you figure it all out, like one reviewer mentions, please post it here, because the ending, though discussion inducing, was a detractor from the overall film's effect.Good flick, worth your while, but I wouldn't say a must see.  Guys, Julie, played by Ludivine Sagnier, is certainly easy on the eyes and certainly has a thing against clothes...but as the film is French it's not about the flesh alone, it's about the deeper meaning of life, the inner psyche, and all that.  The reviewer that mentioned ""The Swimming Pool,"" reminded them of Bergman's ""Persona,"" was spot-on.  Two diametrically different females have a profound influence on one another's lives forming a weird bond and ultimately changing and morphing into changed people.  Don't think about it too much.

It provides a great vechile for the charming Charlotte Rampling, here playing a celebrated English mystery writer offered the loan of a French villa by her publisher (Charles Dance).

And like ""8 Women"" too, ""Swimming Pool"" is a film which is marvellous when considered in its entirety, but falls apart if you poke at it too much. It's best taken as an impressionistic, abstract painting - the picture becomes clearer at a distance but the details disintegrate the closer you get.I was initially very puzzled after watching the film. The acting was fantastic, the directing was fantastic, but I simply didn't understand the plot, especially the very puzzling ending which seemed somewhat remniscent of bad kiddie essays - ""Suddenly I woke up and realised that it was just a dream after all."" But the film holds better together if you disregard the bewildering plot and simply absorb the atmosphere without trying too hard to figure out the 'why's of it.The swimming pool worked perfectly as a motif symbolising the freedom of action/expression/thought, almost untamable wildness that Julie has too much of and Sarah is in dire need of. However, I do wonder if the overwhelming scenes of nudity actually contribute to the film. It's a fine line between not enough and too much: nudity of course would be essential, but there was so much blatant sexuality and nudity that it seemed more like hard-core porn at times.

619142,AITI12BBKCYG9,B00005JMIJ,"N. Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[5, 9]","""Swimming Pool"" was all right.  I do enjoy Charlotte Rampling, she is the paradigm of the frosty British schoolmarm in this film and watching her painfully short-tempered interaction with practically every other person was a bit hard.  Poor Sarah Morton (her character) is a misanthropic murder mystery maven who is seeking a rest.  She's been carrying on an affair with her publisher, who sets her up in his home in the south of France [Sarah should have read ""He's Just Not That Into You""...helLO!].  There she reposes until his turbo-hussy daughter Julie erupts on the scene, bedding stranger after stranger and pushing Sarah's already well-worn nerves to the breaking point.It's the classic age vs. youth confrontation -- at first I was irritated with Sarah's ultra-bitchy incapability to cope with any social situation with a degree of normality.  However, I considered what it might be like to be forced into cohabiting with an oversexed tramp who not only brought home repugnant bedmates but kept the house a complete pigsty in the process.

Wow...I have to wonder what happened to her over the years.  Maybe she just needed the work.I am a sucker for anything set in the South of France so I made myself sit through this pretentious wreck of film.  One reviewer used the term ""Eurotrash"" and I have to agree.  Again, I guess I'm showing my age, but I recall when a film out of France was a treasure.  There are still some good ones appearing but this is so bad that I can imagine Francois Truffaut and Louis Malle screaming from their graves.The plot starts predictably.  The archetype sexually repressed Englishperson, in this case a woman, goes to a Mediteranean county to get liberated.  Here poor sweet Charlotte, who was once so sulty and charming is now a frump who dresses all in tones of beige.  Maybe she had her ""colors"" done and was told she was an ""Autumn.""  She seizes on the opportunity to spend some time at the home of her publisher, a dastardly charming fellow whom she has the secret hots for.  She makes him promise to visit her there, but the cad doesn't quite show up.  He does, however, allow his out-of-wedlock young French daughter to show up.  This interferes with Ms. Prissy Englishwoman's plans but at the same time...as we all know....this is what she Really Wants.  The daughter who is quite voluptous and who spends most of her time topless, introduces Miss Prissy to the wonderful ways of the flesh.  Gone are the Pepsi and yogurt (argh) meals taken in front of the telly, now she's drinking the daughter's wine (and refilling the bottle with water)(more argh) and soon she's gobbling down brie and then smoking a joint and dancing up a storm with the local young waiter she's been making eyes at for a while.  Later she even gets to show her private parts, too, to the aged gardener.  (more argh...)Those are the good parts.  The really yukky parts are too gross to mention.

Like all really good ambiguous films, people are going to sit and argue about what everything really meant. I'm not even going to offer an opinion; I'm just going to tell you that you need to sit down with this film (and the cuts made are so slight and pathetic that you actually won't notice anything missing from the R-rated version unless you're a fetishist; yet another reason to scrap the MPAA) and watch it, so you, too, can join in the endless discussions.The story revolves around Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling), a solid B-list author who makes a good deal of money for her press with a series of crime novels, but wants to write something different, and as a result is suffering a nasty case of writers' bock. Her contact at the publisher, John Bosload (the wonderful Charles Dance), suggests she take some time at his vacation house in France and see if a change of view helps. Once there, she meets Bosload's nasty, obstinate daughter Julie (8 Women's Ludivine Sagnier), and the two of them immediately start a territorial feud that escalates when Julie has a one-night stand with a local waiter of whom Sarah has grown fond. (All of which sounds kind of incoherent, but it's impossible to say much of anything about the plot of this movie without soul-destroying spoilers.)Ozon took a chance here in creating one of those ambiguous psychodramas that doesn't let the viewer know what's going on until the final few frames of the movie, and even then does so in a way that almost no one gets it the first time round. This sort of thing is, in general, either a smashing success or an equally resounding failure; Swimming Pool, oddly, seems to have been a great success on the continent, while receiving a decidedly lukewarm reception in Britain, and went almost unnoticed in America (in no small part, I'm sure, because the NC-17 rating the uncut print unjustly received kept it from getting any decent advertising at all, much less a wide release). This says a lot more about the idiocy of culture mores in some countries compared to others than it does the collective intelligence of the filmgoing public in those countries, but it's tempting to explore the topic of whether one reflects the other.A lovely, intelligent little film that challenges the viewer. In other words, the kind of thing which we don't see nearly enough in America. *** ",4,Pretty and thought-provoking.,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2504,"['Swimming', 'Pool', 'Francios', 'Ozon', '2003', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'one', 'garnered', 'most', 'talk', 'really', 'good', 'ambiguous', 'films', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'sit', 'argue', 'what', 'everything', 'really', 'meant', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'offer', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'tell', 'need', 'sit', 'down', 'film', 'cuts', 'made', 'are', 'so', 'slight', 'pathetic', 'actually', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anything', 'missing', 'R-rated', 'version', ""'re"", 'fetishist', 'reason', 'scrap', 'MPAA', 'watch', 'too', 'can', 'join', 'endless', 'discussions.The', 'story', 'around', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'solid', 'B-list', 'author', 'who', 'good', 'deal', 'money', 'press', 'series', 'crime', 'novels', 'write', 'something', 'different', 'result', 'suffering', 'nasty', 'case', 'writers', 'bock', 'contact', 'publisher', 'John', 'Bosload', 'wonderful', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'take', 'time', 'vacation', 'house', 'France', 'see', 'change', 'view', 'helps', 'Once', 'there', 'Bosload', 'nasty', 'obstinate', 'daughter', 'Julie', '8', 'Women', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'two', 'immediately', 'start', 'territorial', 'feud', 'when', 'Julie', 'one-night', 'stand', 'local', 'waiter', 'whom', 'Sarah', 'grown', 'fond', 'kind', 'incoherent', 'impossible', 'say', 'much', 'anything', 'plot', 'movie', 'soul-destroying', 'spoilers', 'Ozon', 'took', 'chance', 'here', 'creating', 'one', 'ambiguous', 'psychodramas', ""n't"", 'let', 'viewer', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'final', 'few', 'frames', 'movie', 'even', 'then', 'so', 'way', 'almost', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'sort', 'thing', 'general', 'smashing', 'success', 'equally', 'resounding', 'failure', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'oddly', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'success', 'continent', 'receiving', 'decidedly', 'lukewarm', 'reception', 'Britain', 'went', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'America', 'small', 'part', ""'m"", 'sure', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'uncut', 'print', 'unjustly', 'received', 'kept', 'getting', 'decent', 'advertising', 'much', 'less', 'wide', 'release', 'lot', 'more', 'idiocy', 'culture', 'mores', 'countries', 'compared', 'others', 'collective', 'intelligence', 'filmgoing', 'public', 'countries', 'tempting', 'explore', 'topic', 'one', 'other.A', 'lovely', 'intelligent', 'little', 'film', 'viewer', 'other', 'words', 'kind', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'nearly', 'enough', 'America', '***']",Swimming Pool
619156,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005JMIJ,Robert I. Hedges,"[5, 14]","I am being generous in giving this film two stars. I saw a trailer for it, and while it looked intriguing, looks can be deceiving, much like the bulk of this would-be psychological potboiler. I think the photography work and acting deserve a minimum of two stars as both were excellent; the general storyline, however, was drivel.Many reviewers have noted how the film fundamentally makes no sense, and there are parts where I agree wholeheartedly. I don't mind thought-provoking films that leave you wondering what actually happened, but this was mostly in the shallow end from the standpoint of plot construction. It is inconceivable to me how the two female leads (Charlotte Rampling, and Ludivine Sagnier) could tolerate one another; further, it is incomprehensible why Rampling didn't merely leave France when Sagnier started making her life miserable. To believe that Rampling would actually help Sagnier conceal murder is impossible. Yes, I know that the entire character of the daughter is ambiguous by the end, but inasmuch as the character was constructed in Rampling's mind to be a murderess negates charges of cinematic intellectual superiority and holds Rampling's judgment suspect.The entire movie is filled with characters that are excruciating to watch, and the only real reason for a two star rating is that the actors do an outstanding job in their roles. I considered briefly watching the film a second time to make sure I understood all the nuances, but I just hated it too much the first time to give it a second chance. This is one film that looks positively great as a two minute theatrical trailer, but looks positively awful in the light of day as a hulking 103 minute feature.I am very open-minded to unusual, imported, and avant-garde films, but while this movie had touches of all three, I was merely relieved when it was over.",2,Here's A Puzzler: Who's The Most Loathsome Cast Member?,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1855,"['am', 'being', 'generous', 'giving', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'saw', 'trailer', 'looked', 'intriguing', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'much', 'bulk', 'would-be', 'psychological', 'potboiler', 'think', 'photography', 'work', 'acting', 'deserve', 'minimum', 'two', 'stars', 'were', 'excellent', 'general', 'storyline', 'however', 'was', 'drivel.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'how', 'film', 'fundamentally', 'sense', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'thought-provoking', 'films', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'was', 'mostly', 'shallow', 'end', 'standpoint', 'plot', 'construction', 'inconceivable', 'how', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'could', 'tolerate', 'one', 'further', 'incomprehensible', 'why', 'Rampling', 'did', ""n't"", 'merely', 'leave', 'France', 'when', 'Sagnier', 'started', 'making', 'life', 'miserable', 'believe', 'Rampling', 'would', 'actually', 'help', 'Sagnier', 'conceal', 'murder', 'impossible', 'Yes', 'know', 'entire', 'character', 'daughter', 'ambiguous', 'end', 'inasmuch', 'character', 'was', 'constructed', 'Rampling', 'mind', 'be', 'murderess', 'charges', 'cinematic', 'intellectual', 'superiority', 'Rampling', 'judgment', 'suspect.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'filled', 'characters', 'are', 'excruciating', 'watch', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'two', 'star', 'rating', 'actors', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'roles', 'considered', 'briefly', 'watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'understood', 'nuances', 'just', 'hated', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'one', 'film', 'positively', 'great', 'two', 'minute', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'positively', 'awful', 'light', 'day', 'hulking', '103', 'minute', 'feature.I', 'am', 'very', 'open-minded', 'unusual', 'imported', 'avant-garde', 'films', 'movie', 'had', 'touches', 'three', 'was', 'merely', 'relieved', 'when', 'was', 'over']",Swimming Pool

Zwick,"[9, 9]","***1/2 One of the marks of a truly great performer is the ability to appear alone on screen for long periods of time - without the aid of other actors or even dialogue - and still create a fully-rounded, easily recognizable character, using nothing more than gestures, body language and facial expressions.  Charlotte Rampling achieves just that sort of magic in ""Swimming Pool,"" an odd little psychological thriller that makes ""Adaptation"" look like a model of clarity, coherence and comprehensibility in comparison.  For the first twenty minutes or so, Rampling has the screen virtually all to herself and she definitely makes the most of the occasion.  She plays Sarah Morton, a successful author of murder mysteries who's become bored with the restraints of her genre and now feels the need to branch out and try her hand at different and more rewarding types of writing.  When her publisher offers her his villa in France as a place to get away and do some writing, Sarah jumps at the opportunity.  Unfortunately, after only a few days there, Sarah finds her peace and solitude shattered by the unexpected arrival of her publisher's nymphomaniac daughter, Julie.  Although there is initially a great deal of tension between the two women, a bizarre symbiotic relationship eventually develops, with Sarah secretly using Julie as the subject for her newest book and Julie feeding Sarah's morbid fantasies, first unconsciously, then consciously.For about two thirds of the film, writer/director Francois Ozon presents us with the classic - one might almost say stereotypical - conflict between a moralistic, sexually repressed, almost ""frigid"" British woman and a beautiful, uninhibited and sensual Continental nymphet.  But, as the story progresses, a certain personality transference begins to take place, with Sarah taking on some of the traits of the girl she professes to despise and Julie finding a way to ""help"" Sarah complete her novel.  I can't say that I completely understand the last half hour or so of the film, although I do suspect that the answer lies somewhere along the line of last year's ""Adaptation,"" which also dealt with the art of writing and the strange blending of the real and the surreal, of truth and fantasy that often accompanies the act.  Suffice it to say that you will either go with the film all the way to the end or tune out at about the 70-minute point.In addition to Rampling's amazing performance as the uptight middle-aged woman (one recalls, with a certain wistful amusement, that, in 1966's ""Georgy Girl,"" it was SHE who played the promiscuous femme fatale), the film offers us the beautiful and talented Ludivine Sagnier as Julie, a street smart kid who knows how to exploit her sex appeal for all its worth yet who occasionally displays moments of childlike tenderness and vulnerability beneath the hardened surface.You may end up scratching your head at the end of ""Swimming Pool,"" but I guarantee it will get you thinking.",3,a genuine head scratcher,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,2971,"['***1/2', 'One', 'marks', 'truly', 'great', 'performer', 'ability', 'appear', 'alone', 'screen', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'aid', 'other', 'actors', 'even', 'dialogue', 'still', 'create', 'fully-rounded', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'character', 'using', 'nothing', 'more', 'gestures', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'just', 'sort', 'magic', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'odd', 'little', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Adaptation', 'look', 'model', 'clarity', 'coherence', 'comprehensibility', 'comparison', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'Rampling', 'screen', 'virtually', 'herself', 'definitely', 'most', 'occasion', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'successful', 'author', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'who', 'become', 'bored', 'restraints', 'genre', 'now', 'need', 'branch', 'out', 'try', 'hand', 'different', 'more', 'rewarding', 'types', 'writing', 'When', 'publisher', 'villa', 'France', 'place', 'get', 'away', 'do', 'writing', 'Sarah', 'opportunity', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'there', 'Sarah', 'peace', 'solitude', 'shattered', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'publisher', 'nymphomaniac', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'initially', 'great', 'deal', 'tension', 'two', 'women', 'bizarre', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'eventually', 'Sarah', 'secretly', 'using', 'Julie', 'subject', 'newest', 'book', 'Julie', 'feeding', 'Sarah', 'morbid', 'fantasies', 'first', 'unconsciously', 'then', 'consciously.For', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'classic', 'one', 'might', 'almost', 'say', 'stereotypical', 'conflict', 'moralistic', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'almost', 'frigid', 'British', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'uninhibited', 'sensual', 'Continental', 'nymphet', 'story', 'certain', 'personality', 'transference', 'take', 'place', 'Sarah', 'taking', 'traits', 'girl', 'despise', 'Julie', 'finding', 'way', 'help', 'Sarah', 'complete', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'completely', 'understand', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'do', 'suspect', 'answer', 'somewhere', 'line', 'last', 'year', 'Adaptation', 'also', 'art', 'writing', 'strange', 'blending', 'real', 'surreal', 'truth', 'fantasy', 'often', 'act', 'Suffice', 'say', 'will', 'either', 'go', 'film', 'way', 'end', 'tune', 'out', '70-minute', 'point.In', 'addition', 'Rampling', 'amazing', 'performance', 'uptight', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'one', 'certain', 'wistful', 'amusement', '1966', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'was', 'SHE', 'who', 'played', 'promiscuous', 'femme', 'fatale', 'film', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Julie', 'street', 'smart', 'kid', 'who', 'how', 'exploit', 'sex', 'appeal', 'worth', 'yet', 'who', 'occasionally', 'moments', 'childlike', 'tenderness', 'vulnerability', 'beneath', 'hardened', 'surface.You', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'scratching', 'head', 'end', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'guarantee', 'will', 'get', 'thinking']",Swimming Pool

Although there are not many remarkable individual moments, the film is interesting and eyecatching because of real personalities of the two main characters; Sarah Morton (played by Charlotte Rampling) and Julie (played by Ludivine Sagnier).Both Sarah and Julie have unique strengths and weaknesses that are perfectly exploited along the plotline.  Sarah is a writer of a well-known detective series, sent by her editor, John, to be a guest in his French home while she finishes her next book.  To her surprise, John's daughter Julie shows up to stay at the house also.Sarah is a tightly wound, prissy Englishwoman, while Julie is a young and wildly promiscuous free spirit.  Sharing the same residence isn't easy for these two distinctively different personalities, and while there is tension and loathing, there are also certain understandings that eventually crawl out from underneath their selfish personas.Sarah and Julie become bound together by sharing an intrigue, and the twist at the end of the movie will shock you, and leave you asking a few questions as to what was real and what was not.The acting is very good; the setting is beautiful, the script tight and extremely well done in managing to create any kind of bond between two such distinctive people.  Definitely get the un-rated version, but beware the ""undercover snake"" and the unwanted buffalo shot of some untrimmed shrubbery.Although not action packed, or bloody, or infused with highly tense moments, this languid and flowing film still deserves five stars for uniqueness of plot, great performances, and an excellent twist.

It just goes to show that all you really need is a fun story and talented folks in front of and behind the camera to make a really, really good flick.In lesser hands, ""Swimming Pool"" would be pure soft-core porn.  But in the hands of Ozon and his team, most notably Charlotte Rampling as a seemingly stereotypical, ""very British"" writer of murder mysteries, the movie becomes an actual thriller.  No cheap camera stunts, no overbearing soundtrack, no chewing of scenery by any actors . . . just lean, bare filmmaking and storytelling.The plot has been summarized very well by other reviews, so I won't bother with another rehash.  Just a couple of recommendations - first, avoid all spoilers, and second, see this movie either alone or in the company of folks who can handle a heck of a lot of nudity and sex and still appreciate the movie.

Those of you that do not enjoy this type of cinema will have a bit of trouble keeping up with the story. The good news is that there comes a point in which the pace and the suspense level pick up considerably, creating a good balance overall.Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a writer of detective stories that is having trouble finding inspiration for her next novel. In an effort to start her off on the right track again, her publisher loans her a house in the French countryside, in the hope that the peace and seclusion will help her break her writer's block. The house is a beautiful place and has a large swimming pool, a feature that presents no attractiveness whatsoever to Sarah.One day, not long after Sarah establishes herself in the house, the publisher's daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), shows up at the house and decides to stay there for a while. This breaks Sarah's peace and serenity and the two women start off to a very rocky start. The personalities are clearly opposite, Julie is extroverted, likes to have fun and swim in the pool, while Sarah is very rigid and hates being around the pool. However, a little time helps them to start to know each other and accept the other person as she is, and even adopt a couple of each other's traits. Sarah even starts writing a story using Julie as a protagonist.However, after a short time of ""truce"", the peace is broken by a series of unsettling events that plunge the plot in overdrive and lead to an ending that will leave you will your mouth open and trying to understand what really happened.Overall, this is a very good movie with high level performances by the two main actresses, especially Sagnier.

But for those of us whose tastes have supposedly evolved beyond the reptillian core, there's considerably more than meets the eye here. This is a grown-up multi-textured psychological drama that keeps you thinking even as it disturbs and titillates. Charlotte Rampling as the up-tight mystery writer plagued with the housemate from hell is nothing short of amazing. She plays the spikey temperamental creative professional with her insistence on solitude and routine to absolute perfection. (I know, because I'm in the same line of work.) Eventually, when her curiosity gets the better of her and the inner detective is awakened (not to mention all that too-long repressed sexuality) it's anybody's guess where reality ends and fiction begins.

Maybe I was expecting something on the scale of ""Sex and Lucia"", or ""Talk to Her"", but I did not get it. What I did get, however, was an intelligent film about two women, seemingly worlds apart, coming together when the situation called for it the most.This movie is about an English writer who goes to France for a while, so she can escape the noise of the city and relax to work on her next book. She is the writer of crime fiction, which becomes important later on in the film. At the house, she is surprised and interrupted by the arrival of Julie, the daughter of the publisher who lent her the house. The two characters clash, as Sarah is the conservative Englishwoman, very reserved, and Julie is the relaxed, sexually liberated French girl. Cliches aside, these characters mesh well together, and the performances are strong from both women.I suppose ""Swimming Pool"" could be considered a psychological thriller, although I found that there were not too many thrills to be had. This film is definitely character driven, and to this end it is quite successful, but I'm not sure it would warrant such rave reviews. Perhaps in time I will gain more respect for this movie, with a different perspective, but after first watching it, I feel dissapointed by what I saw.

619181,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B00005JMIJ,Timothy Michael Resh,"[6, 9]","First things first.  This is defintely an art film.  Epitomizing the spirit of independent filmmaking, this is not your typical Hollywood schlock.  There is some level of eroticism, but more on the level of couched voyeurism than open sexuality, although Ludivine Sagnier's Julie prances around topless for a good bit of the film.Once the film gets going, the plot is interesting enough, but the first twenty minutes of setup are difficult to get through.  There is minimal exposition or even dialogue.  Director Ozon simply takes us through the daily routine of Charlotte Rampling's repressed and frustrated author.  The methodical, almost silent vision of her daily routine almost lulls the viewer to sleep, and more of this portion of the film could have easily been added to the ""deleted scenes"" and improved the flow of the film immensely.Still, once Rampling finally begins to open up to Sagnier, the story begins to move, and apart from lascivious and somewhat abrupt plot twists near the conclusion of the film, keeps the viewer interested in the film.  Sadly, the last few moments of the film introduce a variable which leaves the entire plot of the film open to multiple interpretations.While I'm sure this was the intention of Ozon, I prefer most of my entertainment to be more cut and dried, providing more closure.  At least other films like Donnie Darko and Mullholland Drive are consistently odd throughout.  Swimming Pool leads the viewer down the garden path, and suddenly, in the final moments of the film, causes the viewer to question his or her entire interpretation of the sequence of events.An interesting film, but one that unfortunately spends too much time treading water in the shallow end.",3,Interesting but Strange Art Film,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,1717,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'defintely', 'art', 'film', 'Epitomizing', 'spirit', 'independent', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'schlock', 'level', 'eroticism', 'more', 'level', 'couched', 'voyeurism', 'open', 'sexuality', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Julie', 'around', 'topless', 'good', 'bit', 'film.Once', 'film', 'going', 'plot', 'interesting', 'enough', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'setup', 'are', 'difficult', 'get', 'minimal', 'exposition', 'even', 'dialogue', 'Director', 'Ozon', 'simply', 'daily', 'routine', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'repressed', 'frustrated', 'author', 'methodical', 'almost', 'silent', 'vision', 'daily', 'routine', 'almost', 'viewer', 'sleep', 'more', 'portion', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'added', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'improved', 'flow', 'film', 'immensely.Still', 'once', 'Rampling', 'finally', 'open', 'up', 'Sagnier', 'story', 'move', 'apart', 'lascivious', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'plot', 'twists', 'conclusion', 'film', 'viewer', 'interested', 'film', 'Sadly', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'introduce', 'variable', 'entire', 'plot', 'film', 'open', 'multiple', 'interpretations.While', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'intention', 'Ozon', 'prefer', 'most', 'entertainment', 'be', 'more', 'cut', 'dried', 'providing', 'more', 'closure', 'least', 'other', 'films', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Mullholland', 'Drive', 'are', 'consistently', 'odd', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'viewer', 'down', 'garden', 'path', 'suddenly', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'viewer', 'question', 'entire', 'interpretation', 'sequence', 'events.An', 'interesting', 'film', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'treading', 'water', 'shallow', 'end']",Swimming Pool

There we see the real daughter. Or, if you want to torture yourself, you could take the Daughter at face value and that the plainer, non-sexy daughter is the way she is seen by her father.But does any of that make for good movie writing?

619183,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMIJ,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","Francois Ozon's 'Swimming Pool' is kind of a film that, after watching it, makes you scratch your head and ask someone sitting next to you, 'What happened anyway?' Yes, you must be very careful, especially about the last scene about which you need clear interpretation. Of course, I can offer one, but as this is a thriller (as far as its topic is concerned), you must see it for yourself first.Two great actresses shine: Charlotte Rampling (so gorgeous in Ozon's 'Under the Sand') and Ludivine Sagnier (Tinker Bell in 'Peter Pan'). Rampling is a grim, unfriendly British crime fiction writer Sarah Morton whose previous 20 years were all commercial success. She lives in rainy London, where she casually drinks at a bar. Now she is going to write yet another novel in her popular series, and her book editor (Charles Dance) offers his country house in sunny France as a suitable place for her to write again.  And he says he is coming sooner or later.In there, soaked in sunshine, Sarah refreshes her brain. The climate revives her inspiration, and she undergoes a change until suddenly Julie, daughter of the editor shows up, takes up a room, and starts to disturb the equibulium of Sarah's life.So, why is this called a thriller? Actually, it's more like a mystery surrounding the sexality of these two women. Sarah, above 50, is envious of the young girl's free life and many boyfriends while Julie finds the writer rigid and sexually repressed, and quite hates it. The rival relations lead to unexpected turn, and there you see a dead body eventually.But do you? This is a crucial point so I don't disclose much, but director Ozon cleverly (but some say pretentiously) throws in elements that can unsettle our feelings toward the two women. In short, there are something wrong with the house and its swimming pool. I don't mean occult things, but some intentional camera works that suggest the other side of the story, such as frequent reference to mirrors. (You may remember Hitchcock did the same thing one famous shocker.)Apparently 'Swimming Pool' is a thriller, but at its deeper level it suggests the relations that is never disclosed fully. For example, the strange way Charles Dance's editor answers Sarah's phone calls from France (and her reactions) implies something, perhaps the past relation bewteen them, but it is left to our imagination. This is one of the strength of the film, as is seen in Ozon's previous film, engrossing 'Under the Sand.'One more thing, and I am done.  The film includes nudity, even that of Rampling who disrobes entirely at one scene.  But the film clearly needs this, to suggest the rival relations between the two women, so if you have to choose, I recommend the uncut one.",4,Mystery Writer Meets a French Girl;Beautiful andMesmerizing,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,2720,"['Francois', 'Ozon', ""'Swimming"", 'Pool', 'kind', 'film', 'watching', 'scratch', 'head', 'ask', 'someone', 'sitting', 'next', 'happened', 'anyway', 'Yes', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'especially', 'last', 'scene', 'need', 'clear', 'interpretation', 'course', 'can', 'offer', 'one', 'thriller', 'as', 'far', 'topic', 'concerned', 'must', 'see', 'first.Two', 'great', 'actresses', 'shine', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'Ozon', 'Sand', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Tinker', 'Bell', ""'Peter"", 'Pan', 'Rampling', 'grim', 'unfriendly', 'British', 'crime', 'fiction', 'writer', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'previous', '20', 'years', 'were', 'commercial', 'success', 'rainy', 'London', 'where', 'casually', 'bar', 'Now', 'going', 'write', 'yet', 'novel', 'popular', 'series', 'book', 'editor', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'country', 'house', 'sunny', 'France', 'suitable', 'place', 'write', 'again', 'coming', 'sooner', 'later.In', 'there', 'soaked', 'sunshine', 'Sarah', 'brain', 'climate', 'inspiration', 'change', 'suddenly', 'Julie', 'daughter', 'editor', 'up', 'up', 'room', 'disturb', 'equibulium', 'Sarah', 'life.So', 'why', 'called', 'thriller', 'Actually', 'more', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'sexality', 'two', 'women', 'Sarah', '50', 'envious', 'young', 'girl', 'free', 'life', 'many', 'boyfriends', 'Julie', 'writer', 'rigid', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'quite', 'rival', 'relations', 'lead', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'there', 'see', 'dead', 'body', 'eventually.But', 'do', 'crucial', 'point', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'much', 'director', 'Ozon', 'cleverly', 'say', 'pretentiously', 'elements', 'can', 'unsettle', 'feelings', 'two', 'women', 'short', 'are', 'something', 'wrong', 'house', 'swimming', 'pool', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'occult', 'things', 'intentional', 'camera', 'suggest', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'such', 'frequent', 'reference', 'mirrors', 'may', 'remember', 'Hitchcock', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'one', 'famous', 'shocker', 'Apparently', ""'Swimming"", 'Pool', 'thriller', 'deeper', 'level', 'relations', 'never', 'disclosed', 'fully', 'example', 'strange', 'way', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'editor', 'Sarah', 'phone', 'France', 'reactions', 'implies', 'something', 'perhaps', 'past', 'relation', 'left', 'imagination', 'one', 'strength', 'film', 'seen', 'Ozon', 'previous', 'film', 'engrossing', ""'Under"", 'Sand', ""'One"", 'more', 'thing', 'am', 'done', 'film', 'nudity', 'even', 'Rampling', 'who', 'entirely', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'clearly', 'suggest', 'rival', 'relations', 'two', 'women', 'so', 'have', 'choose', 'recommend', 'uncut', 'one']",Swimming Pool

His suggestion is that she takes some time away and re-think her concepts so she is whisked away to his beautiful home in Southern France. To Sarah's surprise and disappointment her publisher never visits but his incorrigible daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) does. Sarah discovers that Julie is hiding a past that has caused her to be sexually promiscuous and irresponsible but Sarah is drawn to her youthful vigor and experimentation. Let the games begin! Sarah discovers a new avenue to pursue in her writing and Julie seeks the approval of a mother she lost. Together the women form bonds that cross a few lines and create disaster.Yet another French film has succeeded in stumping the typical American audience who it seems gets lost behind in the nudity and spectacular flaunting of the beautiful Sagnier.

I'm not at all averse to a film that requires multiple viewings to be fully understood or appreciated.  Take for example Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" or Alejandra Amenebar's ""Abre Los Ojos""; both fantastic films that get better each time you see them.  But it's nice to have SOME understanding of what you've just seen on the first viewing.  Even after a 2nd try, and noticing the attention to reflections in glass, mirrors and pool water, I was still left with a jumble of perplexing possibilities, none of them satisfying.Sara, a British novelist, retreats to the unoccupied summer home of her publisher, John, to rejuvenate her imagination in solitude.  Shortly thereafter, a young vixen claiming to be John's daughter, Julie, arrives to stay awhile as well.  Julie is an unwelcomed intrusion and the two don't get along, even though Sara seems fascinated with watching the beautiful and sexually liberated girl.The story starts out slow and deliberate, which is not a criticism.  But the pace never picks up; I never got the feeling that anything bad OR good was about to happen.  When the murder does occur, it seems silly and unmotivated.  When Sara asks Julie why she did it, Julie replies, ""I dunno...for your book."" This makes no sense regardless of whether Julie is real or imagined; John's daughter or not.I get that some of what takes place is in Sara's imagination, but that doesn't help much.  After reading reviews calling this film ""thrilling"" and promising that in the end, the mysteries would be ""fully and tantalizingly revealed"", I must disagree.  If you feel that you understand what the director was trying to say, won't you please write a review explaining it?  Just start it with a Spoiler Alert, but by all means share your insights with us dimwits who were dumbfounded as the end credits rolled.

619190,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005JMIJ,Westley,"[4, 6]","""Swimming Pool"" opens quite genteelly, as a successful English mystery writer (Sarah Morton, played by Charlotte Rampling) finds herself wanting to stretch literarily.  When she approaches her publisher (Chalres Dance), with whom she may be having an affair, he suggests rather dismissively that she needs a vacation.  He offers her the use of his country home in France.  Despite her hesitation, she decides to go and surprisingly soon feels refreshed and ready to start a new novel.  The next day, however, an unexpected complication arrives in the form of Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), Dance's sensuous French daughter.  The two women clash initially, as Sarah is annoyed by the intrusion and then shocked by the stream of men that Julie parades home for casual sex.  Gradually, the women form a wary bond, although Sarah may be more than a little jealous of the younger woman.The two starring actresses are superlative and make this movie believable and captivating; accordingly they received Cesar nominations (the French equivalent of the Oscar) for Best Actress (Rampling) and Best Supporting Actress (Sagnier).  French director Franois Ozon (Under the Sand, 8 Women) shows remarkable control of his material and sustains a steadily building sense of suspense and intrigue.  As we learn more about the characters, the movie becomes more subtle and the tension increases.  Unfortunately, the film takes a bit of a wrong-headed turn in the final third, as Sarah imagines that a murder may have occurred.  Ultimately, ""Swimming Pool"" is a solid mood piece with a disappointing final act that diminishes its impact.Extras:  The DVD features the original trailer and some deleted scenes, which mostly depict Rampling's arrival in France and her puttering around the village sight-seeing.  These scenes are rather boring and add nothing to the story.",4,Interesting Mood Piece,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,1847,"['Swimming', 'Pool', 'quite', 'genteelly', 'successful', 'English', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Sarah', 'Morton', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'wanting', 'stretch', 'literarily', 'When', 'publisher', 'Chalres', 'Dance', 'whom', 'may', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'rather', 'dismissively', 'vacation', 'use', 'country', 'home', 'France', 'hesitation', 'go', 'surprisingly', 'soon', 'feels', 'refreshed', 'ready', 'start', 'new', 'novel', 'next', 'day', 'however', 'unexpected', 'complication', 'form', 'Julie', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Dance', 'sensuous', 'French', 'daughter', 'two', 'women', 'clash', 'initially', 'Sarah', 'annoyed', 'intrusion', 'then', 'shocked', 'stream', 'men', 'Julie', 'home', 'casual', 'sex', 'Gradually', 'women', 'form', 'wary', 'bond', 'Sarah', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'jealous', 'younger', 'woman.The', 'two', 'starring', 'actresses', 'are', 'superlative', 'make', 'movie', 'believable', 'captivating', 'accordingly', 'received', 'Cesar', 'nominations', 'French', 'equivalent', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Rampling', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Sagnier', 'French', 'director', 'Franois', 'Ozon', 'Sand', '8', 'Women', 'remarkable', 'control', 'material', 'steadily', 'building', 'sense', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'movie', 'more', 'subtle', 'tension', 'increases', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'bit', 'wrong-headed', 'turn', 'final', 'third', 'Sarah', 'murder', 'may', 'have', 'occurred', 'Ultimately', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'solid', 'mood', 'piece', 'disappointing', 'final', 'act', 'impact.Extras', 'DVD', 'original', 'trailer', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'depict', 'Rampling', 'arrival', 'France', 'puttering', 'village', 'sight-seeing', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'boring', 'add', 'nothing', 'story']",Swimming Pool
619191,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B00005JMIJ,William,"[2, 4]","Swimming Pool is a french film which seems straightforward to begin with.  Charlotte Rampling is an author who heads to a quiet French villa (owned by her publisher/lover) to work on her next book.  She needs the quietness and lovely surroundings to inspire her.  However, her publisher's french daughter arrives unexpectedly and forms the basis of the movie.  Is everything so clear as it seems?  Apparently not!Swimming Pool is interesting for the simple reason that it leaves you totally puzzled.  I was still thinking about it two days later and that makes a film special in a way.  I am left thinking about a lot of the final 30 minutes, but that has become fun.  Friends who have also seen it have different interpretations.Worth seeing for a fun film that will leave you wondering about what you have seen (or have not seen).",3,Watchable,1087257600,"06 15, 2004",2004,832,"['Swimming', 'Pool', 'french', 'film', 'straightforward', 'begin', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'author', 'who', 'quiet', 'French', 'villa', 'owned', 'publisher/lover', 'work', 'next', 'book', 'quietness', 'lovely', 'surroundings', 'inspire', 'However', 'publisher', 'french', 'daughter', 'arrives', 'unexpectedly', 'basis', 'movie', 'everything', 'so', 'clear', 'Apparently', 'not', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'interesting', 'simple', 'reason', 'totally', 'puzzled', 'was', 'still', 'thinking', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'film', 'special', 'way', 'am', 'left', 'thinking', 'lot', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'become', 'fun', 'Friends', 'who', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'have', 'different', 'interpretations.Worth', 'seeing', 'fun', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'not', 'seen']",Swimming Pool

I hate doing reviews cuz I think films should speak for themselves...but here is my overall opinion without giving anything away. I wasn't expecting an ending like that to tell you the honest truth. the finale is by all means the savior of the film. The movie is very relaxing and erotic, even though, and based by other reviews, I was  waiting for something even more erotic and lotz and lotz more nudity...but I was wrong. It does contain nudity but nothing espectacular...well, I'm sorry... Ludivine Sagnier nude body is espectacular. I don't consider this film to be an actual thriller because I never felt any tension to be honest. It starts out pretty convincing and then starts to get a bit slow...very slow in some points, but there is exactly when Sagnier's character walks in and everything begins to take place... Beautifully filmed, great acting, sharp editing, good (not great) intriguing and itelligent storyline, nice soundtrack and beautiful locations and of course, Ludivine Sagnier makes this diferent film a must see!
