1034917,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000KLQULW,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[2, 6]","Did I mention all of the drama these fun white girls get into and involved in? Lauren Katherine Conrad by far is my favorite character as she was on Laguna; very , very friendly, sweet, a great friend, down to earth, fun and just so darn love-able. ^_^But you soon realize that she gets back stabbed at every other turn and her heart breaks over and over. I guess we have that in common!This drama-fest takes place in Los Angeles, California for a while...she meets Audrina there, and they become close. After a while, she is offered a job behind-the-scenes at a modeling agency. She decides to move to San Fransisco and then the drama starts soon after she meets Heidi.Heidi meets Spencer, who tries to tear the now-best-friends apart, like my cousin's girlfriend did. See the similarities? Anyway, after some odd lonely nights, Lauren finds the sexy Brody, and they end up sharing their interests, digging each other and totally hooking up. Then, another ""friend"" of Lauren's hooks up with Brody on New Years Eve. Lauren has HAD it with her, and thinks Brody isn't the problem; it's Jen who has been a friend since childhood.Drama, drama, drama, drama. But it's fun. Especially if you liked Laguna Beach and what it entailed.Cover Art: C+Inside Art: N/AStory: CCharacters: B+Dialogue: B-Comical Relief: C-Drama: A (Felt so sorry for Lauren.

I am not happy the way things turned out. It's sad, because I think they would of lived through their friendship longer than it lasted if it wasn't for Spencer, and the fame that he wanted out of it, and I think he used Heidi to get fame, and to get money. It's sad what Hollywood can do to your relationships. I think this is the only season that is pure, and not as scripted as the other seasons. I have watched all the seasons at least twice. Things come, and go in life, and sometimes you even get more than what you asked for. I have to say this I am proud that Lauren left The Hills on her own, I knew she wasn't in it for the fame like some others. I see Lauren as a great role model. Lauren has been on Seventeen Magazine four times now, that's amazing, and I am proud of her. I think everything Lauren has, she has worked hard for as shown in this first season, she could be anyone's best friend.
