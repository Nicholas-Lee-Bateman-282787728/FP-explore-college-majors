A surprise given the director is Werner Herzog. The Vietnamese or Laotians were on the whole portrayed as vicious killers &#34;anti Yankee&#34;-for no good cause, despite the opening sequence of the American strafing of Laotian countryside with huts blown apart in moody pyrotechnics. And the dialogue noting the Americans had no justifiable reason to be in Laos attacking Laotians. Dieter Dengler appeared by the end of the film to have learned nothing from incarceration, escape or seeing his friend violently killed so close to being rescued. In my view, not a classic wartime drama. Just another &#8220;good old boy doing his duty&#8221; kind of film. The ending was sick. So, a beautifully shot film, some good images (including a raft shot straight out of &#8220;Aguirre Scourge of God&#8221;) and lines of dialogue but stereotypical in the telling of the story of a side bar of the Vietnam War and trite.

First, it doesn't follow the canned formula of good overcoming bad typical in so many movies now. The direction here is for a refreshing documentary style, with little in the way of slick editing and over the top special effects. The story was the most important and intriguing part of the movie. I didn't know what to expect next. The way you think a typical Hollywood movie would follow is not what happens here. Plans don't go as intended, disasters unfold, and the good aren't always good and the bad aren't always bad.

Honestly,this phenom seems to be finally in the consistent top echelon movies and each time he astounds just as he did as a child in ""Empire of the Sun"" back in the mid 1980's.I will say right here that Bale's performance as Dieter Dengler, the shot down Navy pilot who survived torture at the hands of the Laotians in pre-Vietnam War, is nothing short of amazing.He is in every scene in this 2 hour+human wartime drama by Werner Herzog;that it extremely demanding for an actor.It is obvious the amount of starvation weight loss that he underwent to BE Dengler at his lowest as a prisoner in Laos,eating worms and rice!Bale is so in control of his character that the viewer is extremely confident that what is on the screen is Oscar worthy.This entire film hangs on the strength of Bale's sensitive rendering of Dengler.Without Bale, this film, as fascinating and riveting true story as it is,would be diminished in any other actor's hands.Not since Adrian Brody's Oscar winning role in ""The Pianist"" has a film so relied on the complete command of the material in the hands of the lead man.This is not to say that the supporting roles are not incredible,because Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn as the two Americans interred with Bale in the cruel Laos camp are truly standouts as supporting actors.""Rescue Dawn"" is not so much a War film or a film that makes statements about War (though one is left to infer),but rather an in depth look into the character and makeup of humans in extraordinarily harsh conditions.Anyone would want Dengler as portrayed by Bale as their best friend; loyal,funny,charming,optimistic,resourceful,confident,apologetic and most of all incredibly and refreshingly innocent.This film is so good all around that I find no fault with any of it.It is slow (it needs to be) and deliberate.Much of the dialog is barely above a hushed whisper.Close attention must be paid.Herzog puts his audience in the bamboo prison with the six captives.He shackles us nightly with the prisoners.Herzog allows the viewer to be a living but silent partaker in their incredible and inhumane suffering .We move through thick jungle brush while escaping our captors and we watch our friends die viciously.ACADEMY AWARD TELECAST LIVE:....and finally,Christian Bale in ""Rescue Dawn""....the envelope please...(rustle,rustle,opens envelope)...and the winner is....(pause and a hush) CHRISTIAN BALE!!!

In fact, it was out of the theaters so quickly I missed it, so I waited for the recent DVD release. I was not disappointed.Rescue Dawn tells the true story of Dieter Dengler, a Navy pilot shot down and taken prisoner in the Vietnam conflict. The movie title is a little bit misleading, since the movie does not center on a ""rescue"" so much as it does the escape and survival of the prisoners. The movie definitely centers around Dengler, and I think they were trying to give you a real sense of the isolation and confusion that came with being a prisoner of war (it's a little bit artsy).The characters (mostly fellow prisoners) and Christian Bale as Dengler were terrific. The story flowed well and I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire movie. Great scenery, great acting, great situations.

1110369,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000WMA6QO,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Christian Bale has been Oscar worthy time in and time out.  He is, without question, one of our finest working actors, so it is no surprise that the best thing about `Rescue Dawn' is Bale's harrowing performance.  As Lt. Dieter Dengler, Bale is breathtaking.  While the film itself is flawed his performance is far from it.`Rescue Dawn' centers around a young pilot who is shot down behind enemy lines and taken prisoner by the Pathet Lao.  In his newfound POW camp Dengler meets five other captives who have been in captivity for a much longer period of time.  This fact is evident in their mental state for the lack of food and lack of hope has begun to strip away their sanity.  Dengler immediately makes a connection with the only stable man in the group, Duane Martin, and the two of them start to plan an escape.As far as POW films go this film can't compare to greats like `The Deer Hunter' but it does have a lot going for it.  First of all it is visually mesmerizing.  To be honest I am reminded of the feeling I got when watching last years `The Painted Veil', that surreal overwhelming feeling of seeing something truly rich and lush, and there are many scenes, especially in the third act, that are supremely rich and lush.  The jungle is so green, so vibrant that it becomes its own character.  The acting on all fronts is great.  Much has been said of Steve Zahn's performance, and while I don't feel it was `a revelation' I do feel that it is his finest performance yet, but then again, that really isn't saying much is it?  Bale as has been mentioned time and time again is brilliant here.  If this movie had been released this month instead of mid-year he could be a serious contender for the Oscar, but sadly he will most likely be overlooked.Jeremy Davies' character adds a lot to the feel of this film for he starts off where Dengler will ultimately end up (in regards to mental instability).  I think that is truly the beauty of Bale's rich performance.  He takes on such a transformation, yet it is so controlled and gradual that it never feels forced.  You have watched him transform before your eyes at such a natural pace that it all makes sense to you.  And not only does he take on the mental transformation, but physically as well he wastes away before the camera.The direction by Werner Herzog is also very good and deserves mention.  Obviously he is very interested and connected to this heroic tale.  I think maybe that his `connection' to the subject may have blinded him slightly when concluding this picture, for those last few moments really do a number on the overall feel of the film.  In other words, I hated the ending.  It felt way too Hollywood for a film that up until that point felt nothing like the sentimental mush hand fed to the masses today.  That is a small bone to pick, I know, and the other flaws I find within the film are petty in themselves.  There are moments of sheer confusion which were slightly irritating (the POW camp scenes seem frantic at times and with everyone whispering it becomes a strain to try and follow what is actually going on) but overall it's nothing too disappointing.In the end `Rescue Dawn' was a very good film, not perfect but not every film has to be.  Bale is as great as they say he is, but what else would you expect.  I will say that I hope and pray this at least picks up a Cinematography nomination at this year's Oscars for Peter Zeitlinger does such an outstanding job in allowing the scenery to move the film that I'm tempted to say he is the best thing to happen to this movie.",4,A rich and lush depiction of one mans fight for survival...,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,3571,"['Christian', 'Bale', 'been', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'time', 'time', 'out', 'question', 'one', 'finest', 'working', 'actors', 'surprise', 'best', 'thing', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'Bale', 'harrowing', 'performance', 'Lt.', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'Bale', 'breathtaking', 'film', 'flawed', 'performance', 'far', 'it.', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'centers', 'young', 'pilot', 'who', 'shot', 'down', 'enemy', 'lines', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Pathet', 'Lao', 'newfound', 'POW', 'camp', 'Dengler', 'meets', 'five', 'other', 'captives', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'captivity', 'much', 'longer', 'period', 'time', 'fact', 'evident', 'mental', 'state', 'lack', 'food', 'lack', 'hope', 'begun', 'strip', 'away', 'sanity', 'Dengler', 'immediately', 'connection', 'only', 'stable', 'man', 'group', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'two', 'start', 'plan', 'escape.As', 'far', 'POW', 'films', 'go', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'greats', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'First', 'visually', 'mesmerizing', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'reminded', 'feeling', 'got', 'when', 'watching', 'last', 'years', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'surreal', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'seeing', 'something', 'truly', 'rich', 'lush', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'especially', 'third', 'act', 'are', 'supremely', 'rich', 'lush', 'jungle', 'so', 'green', 'so', 'vibrant', 'own', 'character', 'acting', 'fronts', 'great', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'revelation', 'do', 'feel', 'finest', 'performance', 'yet', 'then', 'again', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Bale', 'been', 'mentioned', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'brilliant', 'here', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'month', 'instead', 'mid-year', 'could', 'be', 'serious', 'contender', 'Oscar', 'sadly', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'overlooked.Jeremy', 'Davies', 'character', 'lot', 'feel', 'film', 'where', 'Dengler', 'will', 'ultimately', 'end', 'up', 'regards', 'mental', 'instability', 'think', 'truly', 'beauty', 'Bale', 'rich', 'performance', 'transformation', 'so', 'controlled', 'gradual', 'never', 'forced', 'have', 'watched', 'transform', 'eyes', 'natural', 'pace', 'sense', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'mental', 'transformation', 'physically', 'as', 'well', 'away', 'camera.The', 'direction', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'mention', 'Obviously', 'very', 'interested', 'connected', 'heroic', 'tale', 'think', 'maybe', 'connection', 'subject', 'may', 'have', 'blinded', 'slightly', 'when', 'concluding', 'picture', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'really', 'do', 'number', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'hated', 'ending', 'felt', 'way', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'up', 'point', 'felt', 'nothing', 'sentimental', 'mush', 'hand', 'fed', 'masses', 'today', 'small', 'bone', 'pick', 'know', 'other', 'flaws', 'find', 'film', 'are', 'petty', 'are', 'moments', 'sheer', 'confusion', 'were', 'slightly', 'irritating', 'POW', 'camp', 'scenes', 'seem', 'frantic', 'times', 'everyone', 'whispering', 'strain', 'try', 'follow', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'overall', 'nothing', 'too', 'end', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'Bale', 'as', 'great', 'say', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'will', 'say', 'hope', 'pray', 'least', 'picks', 'up', 'Cinematography', 'nomination', 'year', 'Oscars', 'Peter', 'Zeitlinger', 'outstanding', 'job', 'allowing', 'scenery', 'move', 'film', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'best', 'thing', 'happen', 'movie']",N/A

1110371,A2JWOACYFKJOGI,B000WMA6QO,"A watcher and thinker ""Film Fan""","[1, 2]","This is one of the best films I've seen for a while as it was very thought provoking and afterwards I wanted to know much more about the actual people the events were based around.  I found this film a highly realistic portrayal of the experiences of those unfortunate POW's in their years of captivity in the jungle, far from home, with little or no prospect of rescue, the interaction with other prisoners being the only thing that kept them alive. I felt the key characters were portrayed in a way that made the viewer feel in their position.  What a terrible reality they were suffering, trying to survive day by day, and being shackled like caged animals by cruel captors, living in their own excrement and facing death daily. I found this film made as big an impact on me as I had felt watching The Deer Hunter, and the reason being the sheer horror of the reality of these people's lives and the futility of their situation.Whilst I appreciate the family of Eugene Debruin do not feel the character was accurate, I none the less found the portrayal facinating, as THIS person (Eugene) had suffered for over two years before the film's main character appears (Dengler), and the Director does a good job in showing Eugene's suffering and his state of mind that must have been close to the truth of a person in his situation at that time, even if not the actual truth of Debruin himself. I think the character of Eugene shouldn't be taken too literally, and he represents a victim of prolonged incarceration and what is really heartbreaking is that he doesn't appear to survive at the end of the movie.  If he is shown as confused or resigned, then if not this exact character in the movie then there would have been hundreds or thousands like him, so I did not interpret the character as being necessarily accurate in precise detail, but the portrayal evokes strong emotions of the hopelessness that must have been felt.  The actor Jeremy Davies, did a truly excellent job in the role, not necessarily of the real Eugene, but of the type of long suffering, despairing and resigned POW.Steve Zahn is incredible as the doomed Duane Martin, fighting for survival, pitiful, incredibly weakened yet somehow surviving weeks on the run in the jungle only to meet the most shocking and horrendous end. By this time the viewer is numbed by the horror that his extremly weak friend witnesses. Regards this friend, and the main character, Dengler, he is portrayed ultimately as the hero not least as he is the only American who actually survives the terrible ordeal and lives to tell the tale, and so this is his story, and Christian Bale is superb in the role. You feel his ordeal every heartaching minute and the outcome is a miracle. There are no clues as to how it will all end for the characters, as they are in an impossible situation from the outset. The fact that there are any survivors at all makes it a story worth telling.Werner Herzog crafted an incredible film from Dieter Denglers story of survival, making it an historical yet painful tale, which leaves you aching with worry for those that didn't make it out and are still listed as Missing In Action to this day.  Its not a war movie and yet war creates the background to the story.  It is a movie of survival against impossible odds, and the tragic deaths of so many who died in the jungle whose final stories will never be known and who in time will be forgotten. This film helps us remember the brave attempts at survival of Dieter Dengler, Duane Martin, Eugene Debruin, their friends, and thousands of other POW's.

1110382,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000WMA6QO,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","It's been quite a few years since Werner Herzog did a major fictive film. The last couple of decades has seen an increasing veer into documentaries and more experimental cinema. However, with 2007 film, Rescue Dawn, Herzog shows that the years have not taken their all too inexorable toll on the visionary mind. While the film is not an inarguably great masterpiece along the lines of some of his classic fictive films from the 1970s, it is a terrific war film, but, more so, a terrific prison escape and action film, even as it wholly subverts many of those subgenre's worst banalities.The film is sometimes an expansion, condensation, and retelling of the same basic tale Herzog told in his classic 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs To Fly. That film chronicled the life and capture, over Laos, of a German born U.S. Navy Pilot named Dieter Dengler, who spent six months as a prisoner of war in Laos, before escaping with six other men into the jungle. Only Dengler was known to have survived. Rescue Dawn details and condenses many aspects of the earlier film, and is well acted by a stellar cast, well directed by Herzog, and brilliantly cinematographed by Peter Zeitlinger, who melds the stunning visuals of Thailand with Herzog's own classic `eye level realism' to evoke some of the same sorts of jungle imagery that made films like Aguirre: The Wrath Of God and Fitzcarraldo so impressive. On top of that is the wonderful film scoring by Klaus Bedelt, which is very minimal yet effective when employed; mixing the high and low forms of music Herzog is known for.The plot is rather simple, and greatly condenses the tale the real Dengler tells within the earlier film.... The acting, especially on Bale's part, is outstanding. In each of his roles, Bale creates characters wildly different from each other. Comic actor Steve Zahn also shines as the timid Duane Martin, and Jeremy Davies makes for an excellent counterpoint to Dengler's exuberance, whether true or not. And the film also benefits by its fast pace. Despite being 125 minutes in length, the film never has `dead air'. It moves relentlessly from scene to scene, often being cut just before a typical Hollywood moment would arise in an action film. Thus, Herzog gives the viewer their Hollywood steak while not clogging their arteries with the mindless fat.Yet, despite all its excellent points, at its heart, this film, unlike the documentary version of Dengler's life, is simply a deeper action film (a sort of leaner, meaner The Bridge On The River Kwai); it lacks the overall intellectual depth, probing, and agon that defines great art and suffuses Herzog's fictive classics from earlier in his career, even as it is a significantly better work of art than such a similarly themed and lauded film as The Deer Hunter. Rescue Dawn, however, and despite its near miss at greatness, is certainly a must see for those people who want to get a richer perspective on the Vietnam War, and deserves its place alongside Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as unique visions of that war.

1110383,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000WMA6QO,Craig Matteson,"[9, 11]","Werner Herzog is a wonderful filmmaker and everything he does is worth seeing.  This movie is a dramatization of the events recounted in his 1997 documentary ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"".  Because it is a dramatization, some of the events in the movie are conflated, and some of the characters are different than the real life people with those names.  For example, Jeremy Davies gives a wonderful performance as Eugene McBruin.  In the movie, McBruin provides threats and resistance to what Dengler is trying to do to survive.  He comes across as weak, broken by years of captivity, and unnecessarily contrary to the idea of escape.  However, his family rejects that portrayal.  This is an especially important point because there were reports of his being alive and in Laos until the 1990s.The dramatizations aside, this is a very good movie.  Dengler was a German who was a child at the end of World War II.  His hometown was on the receiving end of air attacks from the allies and a particularly low and close flight by one pilot transformed Dieter and form that moment on he needed to fly.  He emigrated to the United States and joined the military so he could fly.  As the movie portrays, he was shot down in February 1966 and eventually captured, tortured, and imprisoned in Laos.Eventually, he and his fellow inmates made a plan for escape and the latter half of the movie recounts that attempt in June 1966 and what happened afterwards.  The story is quite intense and Christian Bale does a fine job portraying Dengler.  Steve Zahn gives a very moving and emotional performance as Duane Martin, Dengler's closes friend among the prisoners.  Obviously, Dengler escaped and survived and we share the delight of his former crew when he returns to the ship.  And we share Dengler's sorrow at the loss and pain he suffered in captivity and during the difficult escape process.In real life, Dengler left the service and became a test pilot and survived four additional crashes.  He later became a pilot for TWA.  He died of Lou Gherig's disease in 2001.I give this movie a strong recommendation.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,A dramatization of a real prisoner of war story set in Laos 1966,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2139,"['Werner', 'Herzog', 'wonderful', 'filmmaker', 'everything', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'dramatization', 'events', 'recounted', '1997', 'documentary', 'Little', 'Dieter', 'Needs', 'Fly', 'dramatization', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'conflated', 'characters', 'are', 'different', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'names', 'example', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Eugene', 'McBruin', 'movie', 'McBruin', 'threats', 'resistance', 'what', 'Dengler', 'trying', 'do', 'survive', 'weak', 'broken', 'years', 'captivity', 'unnecessarily', 'contrary', 'idea', 'escape', 'However', 'family', 'portrayal', 'especially', 'important', 'point', 'were', 'reports', 'being', 'alive', 'Laos', '1990s.The', 'dramatizations', 'aside', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Dengler', 'was', 'German', 'who', 'was', 'child', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'hometown', 'was', 'receiving', 'end', 'air', 'attacks', 'allies', 'particularly', 'low', 'close', 'flight', 'one', 'pilot', 'transformed', 'Dieter', 'form', 'moment', 'needed', 'fly', 'emigrated', 'United', 'States', 'joined', 'military', 'could', 'fly', 'movie', 'portrays', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'February', '1966', 'eventually', 'captured', 'tortured', 'imprisoned', 'Laos.Eventually', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'made', 'plan', 'escape', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'attempt', 'June', '1966', 'what', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'story', 'quite', 'intense', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'Dengler', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'very', 'moving', 'emotional', 'performance', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'Dengler', 'closes', 'friend', 'prisoners', 'Obviously', 'Dengler', 'escaped', 'survived', 'share', 'delight', 'former', 'crew', 'when', 'ship', 'share', 'Dengler', 'sorrow', 'loss', 'pain', 'suffered', 'captivity', 'difficult', 'escape', 'process.In', 'real', 'life', 'Dengler', 'left', 'service', 'became', 'test', 'pilot', 'survived', 'four', 'additional', 'crashes', 'later', 'became', 'pilot', 'TWA', 'died', 'Lou', 'Gherig', 'disease', '2001.I', 'give', 'movie', 'strong', 'recommendation.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",N/A

This time around he dramatizes one of the greatest ever survivor's tales. Dengler was 18 when he left his home in Germany for the states with one mission in mind, to fly for the American military. On February 1, 1966 he took enemy fire and crash-landed his plane in Laos while on a secret mission. After surviving in the jungle on his own he was captured and tortured (hanging upside down with an ant nest around his neck, submerged in a well, dragged by an ox through a village), then taken to the Pathet Lao prison camp. There he met other POWS, then escaped after they overheard the guards say they planned to shoot them. The fellow POWS were separated after the escape, and Dengler and his buddy Duane Martin teamed up. Martin was eventually beheaded by villagers, but Dengler was rescued after improbably surviving the dense jungle.

And the odds are it's been appreciated over the last half-decade for exactly that reason by Americans knowledgeable about the Vietnam War.The movie stars Christian Bale and Steve Zahn as American warriors captured in Laos or northwestern South Vietnam in 1965, when according to the movie's pre-narrative, ""few Americans thought the Vietnam War would become an all out war.""  I must have been one of those few, because I knew President Lyndon Johnson was fully committed to America's long-dead South Vietnamese puppet Diem's refusal to honor the Geneva Accords; and I sensed that America's buildup for (if not the actuality of) the bombing of North Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, had begun.The movie's first scenes take place aboard the U.S.S. Hornet (having survived WW II with laurels), in the Gulf of Tonkin, and the most cracking-wise loudmouth among the officer-pilots is a man with the soon-to-become-notorious moniker ""Spook.""A Navy pilot, Bale is shot down by ground fire on his first bombing mission from the Hornet across South Vietnam.  At the time, America's attacks on Laos to interdict Viet Cong supply lines into South Vietnam were well-guarded CIA secrets, and kept out of America's big media; after all, Laos was a separate country bordering on South Vietnam, a member of the United Nations and presumably protected from American aggression by Article 4 of the U.N. Charter.Bale and Zahn meet soon after Bale is shot down, in captivity in Laos (the DVD's blurb says the POW camp is in northwestern South Vietnam, but Zahn says he thinks it's in Laos), and in less than a year they escape down a tributary to the Mekong River.  The escape is reminiscent of The African Queen (regarding leaches among other things), while before the escape the POW camp scenes were reminiscent of The Bridge on the River Quai (regarding POW in-fighting and the ""impenetrable forest"" being the POW camp's walls).But what impressed me most about Rescue Dawn were not its war and POW camp scenes, which occupy probably 98% of the movie's running time, but two after-Bale's-return-to-safety scenes.  There is first, Bale's hospitalization, rest, and recovery -- interrupted by his interrogation by two laughably sinister men in black suits from the CIA.  And then, this CIA interrogation is interrupted by several of Bale's shipmates, who clandestinely whisk him away from the hospital and the CIA clowns and return him to the Hornet.  Once back on his ship, Bale is honored by all hands for his extraordinary courage and escape from captivity, but more like the hero who scored a high-school football team's conference-winning points than like a Navy pilot and officer.  And at one point, the chubby master of ceremonies for Bale's shipboard reception says loudly to him: ""You MUST believe in something.""  Nailing it for 21st century moviegoers, Bale replies with his school boy's modest grin: ""I believe I could use a good steak.""And these two completely impossible scenes brought home to me just how unlike Vietnam are America's apparently unstoppable wars in 2011; how de-institutionalized is military heroism today; and how most Americans only tolerate our soldiers like they tolerate Wall Street Billionaires and the inmates of our prisons -- if they remain nameless and faceless.  Yes.  Goddamit.  And how the very little in the larger scheme of things that was positive about soldier-ing in 1965 is gone, truly gone now the way of all flesh.",3,A Distortion of History Has Its Moments,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,3552,"['Rescue', 'Dawn', 'may', 'distort', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'more', 'moments', 'do', 'not', 'odds', 'are', 'been', 'appreciated', 'last', 'half-decade', 'exactly', 'reason', 'Americans', 'knowledgeable', 'Vietnam', 'War.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'American', 'warriors', 'captured', 'Laos', 'northwestern', 'South', 'Vietnam', '1965', 'when', 'according', 'movie', 'pre-narrative', 'few', 'Americans', 'thought', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'would', 'become', 'out', 'war', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'few', 'knew', 'President', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'was', 'fully', 'committed', 'America', 'long-dead', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'puppet', 'Diem', 'refusal', 'honor', 'Geneva', 'Accords', 'sensed', 'America', 'buildup', 'not', 'actuality', 'bombing', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'Operation', 'Rolling', 'Thunder', 'had', 'begun.The', 'movie', 'first', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'U.S.S', 'Hornet', 'having', 'survived', 'WW', 'II', 'laurels', 'Gulf', 'Tonkin', 'most', 'cracking-wise', 'loudmouth', 'officer-pilots', 'man', 'soon-to-become-notorious', 'moniker', 'Spook', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'Bale', 'shot', 'down', 'ground', 'fire', 'first', 'bombing', 'mission', 'Hornet', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'time', 'America', 'attacks', 'Laos', 'interdict', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'supply', 'lines', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'were', 'well-guarded', 'CIA', 'secrets', 'kept', 'America', 'big', 'media', 'Laos', 'was', 'separate', 'country', 'bordering', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'member', 'United', 'Nations', 'presumably', 'protected', 'American', 'aggression', 'Article', '4', 'U.N.', 'Charter.Bale', 'Zahn', 'meet', 'soon', 'Bale', 'shot', 'down', 'captivity', 'Laos', 'DVD', 'blurb', 'POW', 'camp', 'northwestern', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'Zahn', 'Laos', 'less', 'year', 'escape', 'down', 'tributary', 'Mekong', 'River', 'escape', 'reminiscent', 'African', 'Queen', 'regarding', 'leaches', 'other', 'things', 'escape', 'POW', 'camp', 'scenes', 'were', 'reminiscent', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Quai', 'regarding', 'POW', 'in-fighting', 'impenetrable', 'forest', 'being', 'POW', 'camp', 'walls', '.But', 'what', 'impressed', 'most', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'were', 'not', 'war', 'POW', 'camp', 'scenes', 'probably', '98', '%', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'two', ""after-Bale's-return-to-safety"", 'scenes', 'first', 'Bale', 'hospitalization', 'rest', 'recovery', 'interrupted', 'interrogation', 'two', 'laughably', 'sinister', 'men', 'black', 'suits', 'CIA', 'then', 'CIA', 'interrogation', 'interrupted', 'several', 'Bale', 'shipmates', 'who', 'clandestinely', 'whisk', 'away', 'hospital', 'CIA', 'clowns', 'return', 'Hornet', 'Once', 'back', 'ship', 'Bale', 'honored', 'hands', 'extraordinary', 'courage', 'escape', 'captivity', 'more', 'hero', 'who', 'scored', 'high-school', 'football', 'team', 'conference-winning', 'points', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'officer', 'one', 'point', 'chubby', 'master', 'ceremonies', 'Bale', 'shipboard', 'reception', 'loudly', 'MUST', 'believe', 'something', 'Nailing', '21st', 'century', 'moviegoers', 'Bale', 'school', 'boy', 'modest', 'grin', 'believe', 'could', 'use', 'good', 'steak', 'two', 'completely', 'impossible', 'scenes', 'brought', 'home', 'just', 'how', 'Vietnam', 'are', 'America', 'apparently', 'unstoppable', 'wars', '2011', 'how', 'de-institutionalized', 'military', 'heroism', 'today', 'how', 'most', 'Americans', 'only', 'tolerate', 'soldiers', 'tolerate', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Billionaires', 'inmates', 'prisons', 'remain', 'nameless', 'faceless', 'Yes', 'Goddamit', 'how', 'very', 'little', 'larger', 'scheme', 'things', 'was', 'positive', 'soldier-ing', '1965', 'gone', 'truly', 'gone', 'now', 'way', 'flesh']",N/A
1110395,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000WMA6QO,Grady Harp,"[57, 63]","So speaks Dieter Dengler when asked for comment at the end of his journey of jungle captivity in Laos.  RESCUE DAWN is as much about the courage and fortitude of a captured soldier during wartime as it is about a true incident.  From the inherent optimism of pilot Dieter Dengler (played with commitment and finesse by Christian Bale) the story transcends biopic and offers lessons for life in general; the human spirit can be indefatigable.Writer/director Werner Herzog has expanded his 1997 documentary about Dieter Dengler and in doing so he has provided us entry into the psyches of soldiers captured by the enemy and the extraordinarily trying conditions in which they survive. The optimistic and eager Dengler is sent on a classified mission to bomb certain targets in Laos in 1965 with his fellow pilots including his best friend Spook (Toby Huss).  Denlger is shot down and captured, interrogated, tortured, and placed in a prison with fellow inmates Duane (Steve Zahn in a career changing superb performance), Gene (the emaciated and excellent Jeremy Davies), Phisit (Abhijati 'Meuk' Jusakul), and Procet (Lek Chaiyan Chunsuttiwat).  The living conditions are deplorable: the men are starved, chained together making even the possibility of caring for bodily functions negligible, and the moral is low.  Dengler changes that using his ingenuity and immediately plans for escape.  Duane aids Dengler but Gene fears the consequences of an aborted escape attempt. Yet with Dengler's expertise and cunning the escape into the jungle is planned and is essentially successful - until the other enemy (the jungle) reduces the forces to one. As Dengler is rescued he is left with the ghosts of his fellow inmates, a factor that will haunt him and alter his life after rescue.Christian Bale's performance is near perfect as are the performances by Zahn and Davies.  The film feels too long at times but that also suggests that director Herzog wants the audience to understand the mental deterioration and stagnant time cycle that cripples prisoners of war.  The atmosphere of the prison camp is presented well and if the ending of the film becomes a bit too 'Hollywood', after the 2+ hours of prison confinement that is somewhat of a relief.  RESCUE DAWN is a powerful film with some of the best acting of the year's crop and certainly deserves the attention of a wide audience.  Grady Harp, November 07",4,"'If it is full, empty it.

1110396,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B000WMA6QO,Guy De Federicis,"[5, 8]","The true story of German immigrant turned American pilot Deiter Dengler, (Christian Bale), and his subsequent capture, confinement and escape from a POW camp during The Vietnam War, echoes elements of The Great Escape, and several other escape films, while delivering its own distinct 'war is hell' eulogy in its shadowy, claustrophobic and artful camera eye which defines the hero and his fellow prisoners as a Christ figure surrounded by grungy devotees. Scenes within the confines of their jungle clearing bamboo prison cell, as the prisoners huddle together and whisper secret plans for escape, are indebted to images of famous classical Christian paintings, like an up-close and personal Da Vinci's Last Supper. With Deiter's return to freedom, in the sanitary and joyous sanctity of his home base, he is lifted horizontally above the heads of his cheering fellow soldiers while draped in white hospital convalescent clothing, looking like Jesus rising from the dead. In one scene he wrestles with a large serpant in an attempt to eat it. Director Werner Herzog's religious interpretations are like chapters that lead to a harrowing and godless scene, where an enemy in enemy land, (Deiter), screams in horror to a sky litttered with unwitting rescue helicopters. It is at once, a hope filled and hopeless scene, a picture of war itself.While following the conventions of escape films; The Deer Hunter, Midnight Express; the list goes on, Rescue Dawn is grittier and less majestic in its adventurous tone, keeping it's cinematic drive not in the panorama of heroic nature, but in the vistas of exotic beauty in the Thailand jungles where the movie was filmed, which reveal a hostile environment of flood swollen rivers, determined blood sucking slugs, and impassable jungle terrain, and the starkness of the mundane and military place of freedom where the adventure began. The movie follows the book on escape films with POW's on the verge of mental breakdown, a bowl of live worms for breakfast, discourse among escapees, emotional freedom ringing conclusion, but it does it all so artfully, you are never reminded of the other great escapes. In Deiter, played by Christian Bale, we have not a disillusioned Vietnam soldier on the verge of living a lifelong nightmare, but of the quality John Wayne boasted, but without the bravura and impossible manhood.  You can picture him barbequing in his backyard with the wife and neighbors, leading a carefree life when the war is over.The film ends without revealing the fate of Deiter's fellow prisoners which is upsetting. It also offers a lingering question which may suggest topical references to our current state of military affairs. There is a psyche-bizarre scene after a torture session where Deiter seems in compliance with his recent captors as they stand near a body of water filled with, what looked like minnow sized sharks. It is suggestive of the prisoners signing papers declaring America an evil imperialistic nation after an intense psychological torment, hence their confinement, as opposed to their demise.

However, when the movie was over, I was left with a feeling of disappointed / dissatisfaction.  After thinking about it for a while, I guess the my main problem (s) with the film is that the Christian Bale's performance was odd vs unconvincing.  I know that the pilot in real life was known for his positive attitude, but Christian Bale's performance makes him out to be a goofball... at times.  Being former Navy and in the aviation community, I know that aviators are a unique group of people, often being very ""colorful"", however I've never met or known a Naval aviator that was a goofball as portrayed via C. Bale.Then on top of that, it was disconcerting that after the pilot's escape companion was killed, there was minimal reflection on his fellow POWs after getting rescued.  The film portrayed the pilot as just being concerned with the fact that he was rescued; ie again, there pilot's character lacked any type of depth or complexity.  It just didn't ring true.3.

1110403,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000WMA6QO,Jason,"[2, 3]","Inspired by the true story of Dieter Dengler's (Christian Bale) ordeals during the Vietnam war, Rescue Dawn follows Lt. Dengler on his very first combat mission.  Prior to the primary ground battles, U.S. troops flew bombing raids missions into Laos, and it is during one such excursion in 1965 that Dengler's plane took ground-fire that caused a crash.While jungle survival videos produced by the military were supposed to keep a downed pilot safe in Dengler's situation, they did no such thing.  Woefully unprepared for the jungle, he's captured in a matter of days and soon faces months of sadistic torture at the hands of both the Laotians and the Vietnamese.  Beatings, being bound and tied to a moving oxen, and nearly drowned, he's eventually moved to a P.O.W. camp where other soldiers are being held.  It is in this prison camp that a daring rescue attempt is devised by the shared contributions of the prisoners, as Dengler and other prisoners fight through the jungles of Laos towards Thailand and eventual freedom.Convincing as Dengler, Christian Bale really sells out for this role.  Throughout the movie his physical condition noticeably worsens, his weight takes a dramatic drop, and he truly looks like he may have been tortured as a POW.Troubling, however, is what I have read since watching the movie.  Evidently, several other prisoners and their families take umbrage with the manner in which the movie portrays certain events.  Werner Herzog takes liberties with certain facts, giving credit to Dengler when others were responsible, and painting other prisoners in a negative light when, in fact, they were courageous and patriotic throughout the entire ordeal.Not knowing the contested history, this movie is a solid contribution to Hollywood's Vietnam oeuvre.  It's a tense, harrowing drama, and I'm upset that this is based in even the remotest sense on reality.

Christian Bale is the main character, Dieter Dengler, a pilot in the Navy who gets shot down and is taken to a POW camp in Laos.  Along the way, Bale's character encounters two other very gifted actors.  First is Steve Zahn, who everyone thinks of as a comedic actor.  But in Rescue Dawn, he shows tremendous dramatic depth and is is enjoyable to watch him in this role.  The other great actor is Jeremy Davies. If you're a fan of the TV show Lost, you know him as Daniel Faraday (and it takes a few minutes to get used to seeing him in another role).  Together, the performances of these fine actors make the movie worthwhile.The look of the film, especially the lush green landscape, is perfect for the blu-ray high definition format.

Always told by the heroes who lived them--fine examples like Apocalypse Now and Platoon come to mind. They are always full of courage, patriotism but told with crude reality. Rescue Dawn tells the story of a brave American soldier who became a POW during the Vietnam War. He just wanted to be a pilot, but became something greater than that. The film's great story, acting, and visuals create a sense of realism that the audience will appreciate. This is the best war movie of 2007. Also, this is Christian Bale's best performance of his career and probably a contender for best actor at the Oscars.Brief Story Intro:It is 1965. US Navy Pilot Dieter (Christian Bale) is going to a secret mission to South East Asia--Laos is his destination. As he is flying through the mountains, his plane gets shot down by the enemy. Miraculously, he survives the crash, but now he has to run away from these Asian peasants who are looking restlessly for him. Unfortunately, he gets caught. After suffering torture, he is taken to a prison camp in this hostile jungle where he meets other Americans soldiers like Duane (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies). He becomes the leader of the group by showing determination, ingenuity and courage. He doesn't want to stay long there--like many of them--so he masterminds an escape plan. They all agree, but Gene is not too sure about it--he believes that the war will end soon and they will be released. After secretly collecting simple tools, they plan their escape.Review:Based on a true story, told with intensity, but what really makes this movie shine? One of the most important aspects of Rescue Dawn is its realism. It is hard to find actors who want to go the ""extra mile"" to give life to their characters. The main actors look, in every sense, like real POWs from the Vietnam era--down to their starving bodies and personalities. They transformed themselves for this role and I praise that kind of commitment--great actors who have done the same are Charlize Theron (Monster) and Tom Hanks (Cast Away). Especially Christian Bale who plays a charismatic, next-door guy Navy pilot who just wanted to fly his plane, made fun of surviving military videos, but once he becomes a prisoner of war, he chances to a mature survivor who has to keep his sanity in order to survive his captors and the jungle--his biggest enemy of all. It is heartbreaking to see all the things our hero has to go through to be alive. He never gives up even though the odds are against him. I won't be surprised if Christian Bale gets a nomination for this extreme role.I also praise the German director Werner Herzog whose cinematography has a bit of a ""documentary"" look--especially when Dieter is taken to the village when we see his captors and regular people from the village--and also displays a sense of isolation and beauty of the South-East Asia jungle--some of the visuals are very impressive, but there is more than that. Rescue Dawn has the best soundtrack of 2007. The music goes well with every dramatic scene. The beauty of the melodies are so uplifting, that gives the ending, one of the most satisfying moments in recent memory.The Verdict:War stories are best told by the people who lived them, day by day, tear by tear. The ones who suffered unimaginable things, but their will to survive, kept them alive. Rescue Dawn tells the dramatic story of one of those heroes from the Vietnam War--All with vanguard acting and visuals. Some might complain for its running time (126 minutes) but this is a small issue because this is one of the best films of 2007.",5,Powerful War Story - A True Oscar Contender,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,3636,"['War', 'stories', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'are', 'always', 'daunting', 'Always', 'told', 'heroes', 'who', 'lived', 'fine', 'examples', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Platoon', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'always', 'full', 'courage', 'patriotism', 'told', 'crude', 'reality', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'story', 'brave', 'American', 'soldier', 'who', 'became', 'POW', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'pilot', 'became', 'something', 'greater', 'film', 'great', 'story', 'acting', 'visuals', 'create', 'sense', 'realism', 'audience', 'will', 'appreciate', 'best', 'war', 'movie', '2007', 'Also', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'probably', 'contender', 'best', 'actor', 'Oscars.Brief', 'Story', 'Intro', '1965', 'Navy', 'Pilot', 'Dieter', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'going', 'secret', 'mission', 'South', 'East', 'Asia', 'Laos', 'destination', 'flying', 'mountains', 'plane', 'shot', 'down', 'enemy', 'Miraculously', 'crash', 'now', 'run', 'away', 'Asian', 'peasants', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'restlessly', 'Unfortunately', 'caught', 'suffering', 'torture', 'taken', 'prison', 'camp', 'hostile', 'jungle', 'where', 'other', 'Americans', 'soldiers', 'Duane', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Gene', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'leader', 'group', 'showing', 'determination', 'ingenuity', 'courage', ""n't"", 'want', 'stay', 'long', 'there', 'many', 'so', 'escape', 'plan', 'agree', 'Gene', 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'war', 'will', 'end', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'secretly', 'collecting', 'simple', 'tools', 'plan', 'escape.Review', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'intensity', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'shine', 'One', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'realism', 'hard', 'find', 'actors', 'who', 'want', 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'give', 'life', 'characters', 'main', 'actors', 'look', 'sense', 'real', 'POWs', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'starving', 'bodies', 'personalities', 'transformed', 'role', 'praise', 'kind', 'commitment', 'great', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'are', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Monster', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Especially', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'charismatic', 'next-door', 'guy', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'fly', 'plane', 'made', 'fun', 'surviving', 'military', 'videos', 'once', 'prisoner', 'war', 'mature', 'survivor', 'who', 'keep', 'sanity', 'order', 'survive', 'captors', 'jungle', 'biggest', 'enemy', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'things', 'hero', 'go', 'be', 'alive', 'never', 'up', 'even', 'odds', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'nomination', 'extreme', 'role.I', 'also', 'praise', 'German', 'director', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'cinematography', 'bit', 'documentary', 'look', 'especially', 'when', 'Dieter', 'taken', 'village', 'when', 'see', 'captors', 'regular', 'people', 'village', 'also', 'sense', 'isolation', 'beauty', 'South-East', 'Asia', 'jungle', 'visuals', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'more', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'best', 'soundtrack', '2007', 'music', 'well', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'beauty', 'melodies', 'are', 'so', 'uplifting', 'ending', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'moments', 'recent', 'memory.The', 'Verdict', 'War', 'stories', 'are', 'best', 'told', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'day', 'day', 'tear', 'tear', 'ones', 'who', 'suffered', 'unimaginable', 'things', 'will', 'survive', 'kept', 'alive', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'dramatic', 'story', 'one', 'heroes', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'vanguard', 'acting', 'visuals', 'might', 'complain', 'running', 'time', '126', 'minutes', 'small', 'issue', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2007']",N/A

Never mind that it was not a popular theatrical success; this is one that will be watched and remembered for years to come. The criticism hat it offers nothing new in the genre of P.O.W. films is mistaken for one simple reason: the other films don't have Dieter Dengler as a central character. While some have read his behavior while prisoner as arrogant, I found him instead to be optimistic, even, at times, naive; for days after seeing this in the cinema, the scene that remained with me was the one when he first tries to flag down a U.S. helicopter flying over, and instead is shot at, mistaken for the enemy. Dengler, rather than sink into utter despair, shouts back, ""Hey, you idiot! You almost hit me!"" That, I think, underscores the uniqueness of his character, the irrepressibility that makes him, and Bale's masterpiece of a performance, so unforgettable. This film by the way, is only enhanced by watching the documentary ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" which should have been included in this DVD release. Kudos must also go to Klaus Bedelt, who in my opinion wrote a most poignant and appropriate soundtrack to this film. It brings a depth and dimension to the film, rather than merely hang as a supplement to it.

Even his American accent fails at times; it's not hard to hear that this is not his native dialect, which takes away a lot of the realism. All told, I was rather disappointed with this movie. I like some of Herzog's work, especially Aguirre, but something about this one just didn't move me. True story or not, it felt forced and far too film-like.I kept thinking about Papillon, and how touching that movie was, and how I just wasn't feeling much for any of these characters. It gets better as it goes, but the opening seemed very staged and fake, especially the scene where Spook is cracking wise about the training films. He wasn't very funny, but everyone kept laughing their phony laughs, and it detracted from any sense of reality. It also felt like Herzog didn't really know how to make the ship life seem authentic; he's much better directing a couple guys in the jungle than a group of people in normal life. Maybe that's because he knows this isn't really a true story.A little research reveals Herzog's dishonest and self-serving lies about Eugene Debruin's actions in the camp, and Dengler's feats in general. Herzog makes Gene look like a villain and an idiot, while those who were there say it was just the opposite; Dengler did very little of what he's given credit for here: engineering the breakout, etc. But of course this is Werner's second movie about his little hero Dengler, whom he seems to think will bring credit to all Germans if Herzog can just make up enough lies about his ""heroic"" actions. Instead, it just makes me respect Herzog less, as a director and a German (I enjoy German culture in general, so spare me the polemics). If you really love this film, do some research and see what the real story is. It ain't what we're fed here.It looks good on blu-ray, and my favorite thing about the movie was the excellent score, which heightened the proceedings immensely. But I had to agree with my girlfriend when she said, ""This just isn't that interesting.""

1110417,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B000WMA6QO,MadMacs,"[2, 2]","Am a fan of Christian Bale. His performances are often sublime, fascinating and like him or not - almost always engaging. Reconnected with the actor over the past decade or so having last seen him as a young boy in 'Empire of the Sun'. Admittedly stunned at the skilled actor he had become while screening 'The Machinist'. Just one of many excellent, even amazing, performances.However, this isn't one of them.It took me a while to verbalize what I couldn't put a finger to at the time. A recent second screening allowed me to note the issues I have with this production.Firstly, this felt and played like a television movie, with the accompanying cheesy effects, pedestrian screenplay and lazy cinematography. The sets, while undoubtedly close to authentic, filmed cheap; too many scenes looking like they were done in a climate controlled sound stage.Add to the list of mishandled opportunities: Underutilizing the natural locale; not providing us the scale of the escape. It must have seemed like an insane plan to the desperate prisoners. But because Director Werner Herzog doesn't give us the immensity of the journey, according to the maps of Laos and Thailand I scoped before writing this review, the critical moment comes off as very local; as if freedom was merely over a mountain range. The scale, so important for us to feel and understand the massive undertaking of the escape, is never properly defined, hollowing the drama considerably.Additionally, and it's something I've never seen Bale do - overact. Not in every single scene, but at times. And it's embarrassing given his immense skill set and ability. Again, one can solely lay this at the feet of Director Herzog. Unsurprisingly,his next mainstream directorial effort bombed. I'm unfamiliar with his German productions so perhaps this is reflection of a lost-in-translation situation. Historically, some European and Asian directors can't segue into US mediums. That or he's just a so-so director. I like to give him the benefit of the doubt.In fact, I think it's fair to call this Christian's weakest career performance, even though that's still generally better than most of his peers. And made more apparent given that that list includes running around as a costumed comic book character.My harshest criticism is directed at the ending of the movie - ack - trite. An insincere finish and one that I despised given how little effort went into correctly training the actors to look and move as Naval personnel. The worst? The person who played the emcee - blatantly not an actor and apparently some buffoonish relation to one of the producers. How about a steak? No, how getting a professional performer in there Herzog? Astounding horrid closure to a mishandled project. A disservice to the memories of the men whose lives this movie is based on.My only compliment is for Steven Zahn. Very high marks - one of the few performances that rang completely true. To date, the finest performance of the surprisingly versatile character actor I've screened. Sadly, his outstanding execution is utterly lost in this mediocre product.Ultimately, this movie has the basic elements to showcase an incredible journey of survival and the endurance of the human spirit - but fails to capitalize on the talent and core basic elements at hand. To see how this could have been done, I suggest screening 'The Way Back' which utilizes similar content, but producing vastly superior results. Also consider watching 'Gulag' from 1985. A stunning cable film that revealed the horrors of the communist ""justice"" system. Unfortunately, this is one of the many lost HBO movies, and therefore only available in the VHS format.I'm torn as to where the line should be drawn. And yet another case for the Amazon half-star.Call it a high three for Zahn's outstanding effort alone.Movie Note: In doing research for the real story that formed the basis of the screenplay, I was surprised to learn how much Herzog had omitted, contrived and fabricated. Gene DeBruin, the character played by actor Jeremy Davies, was at the very least slandered. And at the very worst, defamed. If you're interested in hearing the other side - search for the website dedicated to Gene's memory.

It's not the fast paced action thriller of so many fictionalized war movies, yet it offers the story of a real man told tastefully through suspense and drama.  For those looking for graphic battle gore, this isn't the movie for you.  If you can take the time to study and appreciate how a horrendous situation can impact a man's thoughts and identity, you will find a lot to learn from here.Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler, a pilot shot down at the onset of the Vietnam War in neighboring Laos.  He miraculously survives the crash and has to contend with his capture and reeducation by his communist captors.  He is eventually taken to a camp where there are other Americans.  The rest of the plot, while long, is best experienced without an outline.Bale's acting is great.  The supporting cast is equally as impressive, especially Steve Zahn as Duane and Jeremy Davies as Gene.  The lush rain-forest is also a character in this movie, and the cinematography beautifully captures one of the world's most awe-inspiring and dangerous places.The story was previously told in Werner Herzog's documentary, ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly.""Little Dieter Needs to FlyThe script is nicely written, but much of it still comes across as a documentary.  The director uses suspense and time to convey the anxiety of the situation.  That's part of the reason wider film audiences are turned off or left wanting more.I suspect that this movie would have had more visual impact in theatres.  Unfortunately, it never reached wide theatrical release in the USA.  The closest viewing most of us can have is to try to see the Blu-Ray version, which is visually stunning.Ultimately, what will a man do to survive such an ordeal?  What would you do to survive?

Moore,"[2, 3]","I was disturbed to learn, after seeing and admiring Werner Herzog's ""Rescue Dawn,"" that the surviving families of Dieter Dengler and other Vietnam-era POWs depicted in the film accuse Herzog of lying outright about these men and their histories. In particular, they say he desecrates the memory of Gene DeBruin, a far more positive, courageous  and altruistic man in real life than as portrayed by Jeremy Davies in the film. In the DVD commentary, Herzog said he wished he had known the additional information about DeBruin before he made the film; DeBruin's surviving family members, however, say Herzog ignored their multiple attempts to contact him.This news leaves me sad and uncertain what to think. Certainly Herzog's film, for the sheer quality of what's on screen, is powerful and inspiring. Herzog was so moved by Dengler's story that he filmed it twice: first as a documentary, ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" and then as ""Rescue Dawn."" The real Dengler--a Navy pilot who was the only Vietnam POW to successfully escape from the Viet Cong--had enough courage, grit, optimism and resourcefulness for a dozen Navy flyers, and Christian Bale gives the performance of his career so far as Dengler. So does Steve Zahn as Duane Martin, Dengler's fellow POW. The film is suspenseful, even harrowing--Herzog, as always, put himself, his cast and his crew through a myriad of extreme situations--and Peter Zeitlinger's photography of the Southeast Asian jungle is magnificent.

What makes it seem uncharacteristic is its complete lack of irony, its refusal to stand at a distance from its characters or from the situation as they see it. Most of Herzog's films are explorations of obsessions, both their danger and excitement -- the capacity of obsession both to reveal and transcend as well as to destroy. In their unflinching look at the passions that drive men to create and destroy, Herzog gives a kind of portrait of himself, of what he admires and what he questions.Here it is Dieter Dengler, played very well by Christian Bale (in another body altering performance), who is obsessed with flying. Of German descent, but now thoroughly Americanized, Dengler is not interested in war per se but takes advantage of the opportunity that military service provides him to become a fighter pilot. He ends up being shot down and captured, and the film explores his reaction to this captivity, and his drive to escape. Apart from a stubborn tenacity that brushes aside objections to his plan, Dieter is unambiguously presented as a hero in the tradition of classical American films. Herzog clearly admires the man, and this film (like the documentary upon which it was based - &#34;Little Dieter Needs to Fly&#34;) is a celebration of his dedication and perseverance, and reveals a side of Herzog that may be less evident in many of his other films. One feature that makes it clearly not your average war prisoner film is its unwillingness to be judgmental about the captors -- who are in a precarious situation themselves and managing only as well as they know how. Rescue Dawn is, perhaps, not a film I'll go back to again and again like Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo or Stroszek or Lessons of Darkness or Wild Blue Yonder, but it is a very well made and well acted film -- and definitely one to watch.",4,A strong portrait of a man who refuses to be grounded,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1960,"['ironic', 'not', 'unexpected', 'Herzog', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'date', 'probably', 'most', 'conventional', 'least', 'characteristic', 'film', 'What', 'seem', 'uncharacteristic', 'complete', 'lack', 'irony', 'refusal', 'stand', 'distance', 'characters', 'situation', 'see', 'Most', 'Herzog', 'films', 'are', 'explorations', 'obsessions', 'danger', 'excitement', 'capacity', 'obsession', 'reveal', 'transcend', 'as', 'well', 'destroy', 'unflinching', 'look', 'passions', 'drive', 'men', 'create', 'destroy', 'Herzog', 'kind', 'portrait', 'what', 'what', 'questions.Here', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'body', 'altering', 'performance', 'who', 'obsessed', 'flying', 'German', 'descent', 'now', 'thoroughly', 'Americanized', 'Dengler', 'not', 'interested', 'war', 'se', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'military', 'service', 'become', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'up', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'captured', 'film', 'reaction', 'captivity', 'drive', 'escape', 'Apart', 'stubborn', 'tenacity', 'aside', 'objections', 'plan', 'Dieter', 'unambiguously', 'presented', 'hero', 'tradition', 'classical', 'American', 'films', 'Herzog', 'clearly', 'man', 'film', 'documentary', 'was', 'based', '34', 'Little', 'Dieter', 'Needs', 'Fly', '34', 'celebration', 'dedication', 'perseverance', 'side', 'Herzog', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'evident', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'One', 'feature', 'clearly', 'not', 'average', 'war', 'prisoner', 'film', 'unwillingness', 'be', 'judgmental', 'captors', 'who', 'are', 'precarious', 'situation', 'managing', 'only', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'how', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'perhaps', 'not', 'film', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'Aguirre', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'Stroszek', 'Lessons', 'Darkness', 'Wild', 'Blue', 'Yonder', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'watch']",N/A

Williams ""just an avid reader""","[34, 43]","A very good movie.unlike any war, vietnam, or prisoner of war story i can remember watching or reading.it is the story of Dieter Dengler, the only US Navy pilot to escape from the Pathet Lao.The story is a contrast of opposing ways of looking at both the world and yourself.Dengler's vs. two other prisoners in the camp, one of resignation, the other one an outward optimism (rescue will come before the rainy season starts), but really another form of resignation and pessimism (because it isn't joined to action but to waiting).What i find extraordinary is not the survival of people in such awful conditions, but how a single person, sustaining what really is an absurd optimism can uplift and motivate the whole group.I think this is the message that the director wishes people to take home, optimism maybe misplaced, but without it hope flees. It is better to be an out of place foolish optimist then to resign yourself to your surroundings and give up.It is an extraordinary message and it is provided to us in the movie with forcefulness and with a subdued passion for life that really ought to rub off on each viewer as she/he looks at their lives and says ""things really aren't that bad"", ""i just need to get moving in the right direction"", ""with the right attitude-like Dengler's"".Where do people like this come from?How do they sustain their optimism in situations that destroy other people?If i can't be that person, how do i get to meet one and learn from watching them?It is a worthwhile to own movie, i can only imagine what Dengler was like in person from watching the movie, i've never personally met anyone quite like him.so i'm glad i ""met"" him in the movie.",5,howdy,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,1677,"['very', 'good', 'movie.unlike', 'war', 'vietnam', 'prisoner', 'war', 'story', 'i', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'reading.it', 'story', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'only', 'US', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'escape', 'Pathet', 'Lao.The', 'story', 'contrast', 'opposing', 'ways', 'looking', 'world', 'yourself.Dengler', 'vs.', 'two', 'other', 'prisoners', 'camp', 'one', 'resignation', 'other', 'one', 'outward', 'optimism', 'rescue', 'will', 'come', 'rainy', 'season', 'really', 'form', 'resignation', 'pessimism', ""n't"", 'joined', 'action', 'waiting', '.What', 'i', 'find', 'extraordinary', 'not', 'survival', 'people', 'such', 'awful', 'conditions', 'how', 'single', 'person', 'sustaining', 'what', 'really', 'absurd', 'optimism', 'can', 'uplift', 'motivate', 'whole', 'group.I', 'think', 'message', 'director', 'people', 'take', 'home', 'optimism', 'maybe', 'misplaced', 'hope', 'flees', 'better', 'be', 'place', 'foolish', 'optimist', 'then', 'resign', 'surroundings', 'give', 'up.It', 'extraordinary', 'message', 'provided', 'movie', 'forcefulness', 'subdued', 'passion', 'life', 'really', 'ought', 'rub', 'off', 'viewer', 'she/he', 'looks', 'lives', 'things', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'i', 'just', 'need', 'get', 'moving', 'right', 'direction', 'right', 'attitude-like', 'Dengler', '.Where', 'do', 'people', 'come', 'How', 'do', 'sustain', 'optimism', 'situations', 'other', 'people', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'person', 'how', 'do', 'i', 'get', 'meet', 'one', 'learn', 'watching', 'worthwhile', 'own', 'movie', 'i', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'Dengler', 'was', 'person', 'watching', 'movie', 'i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'personally', 'met', 'anyone', 'quite', 'him.so', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'met', 'movie']",N/A

1110445,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000WMA6QO,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 10]","***1/2In ""Rescue Dawn,"" Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler, a navy pilot who was shot down over Laos in 1966.  He spent many months in a prisoner-of-war camp not far from the Ho Chi Minh Trail, suffering torture and starvation along with the half dozen or so other men who were imprisoned with him.  A man of great determination and resourcefulness, Dengler engineered a daring escape that earned him the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.""Rescue Dawn"" was directed by Werner Herzog, the world-famous auteur of such visionary films as ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Grizzly Man.""  Given that pedigree, one is struck by just how conventional a piece of filmmaking ""Rescue Dawn"" turns out to be (Herzog made a documentary on Dengler, entitled ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"" in 1997).  Perhaps because the director found himself hemmed in by the biographical nature of the material, ""Rescue Dawn"" feels pretty much like every other prisoner-of-war film set during the Vietnam Era (and before).  The main distinction of this movie lies not in its plot details or character insights but in the fact that Bale and several of the other actors were willing to go on drastic diets and drop massive amounts of weight in order to achieve their emaciated looks.  With their ribs and spines clearly sticking out through their taut skin, the actors never allow us to doubt for a moment their total commitment either to the material or to their art.  The problem is that it becomes such a distraction to us in the audience that it may actual have the opposite effect than what was intended. We begin to worry more about the actors than about the characters, questioning whether any role is worth putting one's health and life at risk in such a manner.  In other words, rather than drawing us deeper into the story, it actually winds up pushing us away.Reservations aside, it is important to note that ""Rescue Dawn"" is still a film well worth seeing.  It is superbly acted by Bale, Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn (as two of his fellow POWs), and  features any number of disturbing, harrowing moments as we watch men, pushed to the limit of their endurance, trying to keep hope alive even after all reason for hope has vanished.  We watch in complete empathy as deprivation, confinement and emotional abuse take their toll on the characters` bodies, psyches and spirits.  The last half hour of the film, in particular, is poignant and heartbreaking as the men become increasingly desperate in their efforts to stay alive.I wish the filmmakers had provided some clue as to what happened to some of the other prisoners after they and Dengler part company late in the film.  We're happy that things eventually worked out well for Dengler, but we would like to know how the other characters we've come to care about fared as well.  I imagine that Dengler himself would have wanted it that way.",3,overly familiar but well-acted POW drama,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,2916,"['***1/2In', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'plays', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'navy', 'pilot', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'Laos', '1966', 'spent', 'many', 'months', 'prisoner-of-war', 'camp', 'not', 'far', 'Ho', 'Chi', 'Minh', 'Trail', 'suffering', 'torture', 'starvation', 'half', 'dozen', 'so', 'other', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'imprisoned', 'man', 'great', 'determination', 'resourcefulness', 'Dengler', 'engineered', 'daring', 'escape', 'earned', 'Navy', 'Cross', 'Distinguished', 'Flying', 'Cross', 'Purple', 'Heart', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'was', 'directed', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'world-famous', 'auteur', 'such', 'visionary', 'films', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'Grizzly', 'Man', 'pedigree', 'one', 'struck', 'just', 'how', 'conventional', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'out', 'be', 'Herzog', 'made', 'documentary', 'Dengler', 'entitled', 'Little', 'Dieter', 'Needs', 'Fly', '1997', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'found', 'hemmed', 'biographical', 'nature', 'material', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'prisoner-of-war', 'film', 'set', 'Vietnam', 'Era', 'main', 'distinction', 'movie', 'not', 'plot', 'details', 'character', 'insights', 'fact', 'Bale', 'several', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'willing', 'go', 'drastic', 'diets', 'drop', 'massive', 'amounts', 'weight', 'order', 'achieve', 'emaciated', 'looks', 'ribs', 'spines', 'clearly', 'sticking', 'out', 'taut', 'skin', 'actors', 'never', 'allow', 'doubt', 'moment', 'total', 'commitment', 'material', 'art', 'problem', 'such', 'distraction', 'audience', 'may', 'actual', 'have', 'opposite', 'effect', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'begin', 'worry', 'more', 'actors', 'characters', 'questioning', 'role', 'worth', 'putting', 'one', 'health', 'life', 'risk', 'such', 'manner', 'other', 'words', 'rather', 'drawing', 'deeper', 'story', 'actually', 'up', 'pushing', 'away.Reservations', 'aside', 'important', 'note', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'still', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'superbly', 'acted', 'Bale', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'two', 'fellow', 'POWs', 'number', 'disturbing', 'harrowing', 'moments', 'watch', 'men', 'pushed', 'limit', 'endurance', 'trying', 'keep', 'hope', 'alive', 'even', 'reason', 'hope', 'vanished', 'watch', 'complete', 'empathy', 'deprivation', 'confinement', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'take', 'toll', 'characters', 'bodies', 'psyches', 'spirits', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'particular', 'poignant', 'heartbreaking', 'men', 'become', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'efforts', 'stay', 'alive.I', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'provided', 'clue', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'prisoners', 'Dengler', 'part', 'company', 'late', 'film', ""'re"", 'happy', 'things', 'eventually', 'worked', 'out', 'well', 'Dengler', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'how', 'other', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'come', 'care', 'about', 'fared', 'as', 'well', 'imagine', 'Dengler', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'way']",N/A

They struggle to survive with little or no food, as Dieter hatches a long-winded plan to escape the confines of the camp. Opening with real footage of a village being bombed, Werner Herzog's feature version of his 1997 documentary 'Little Dieter Learns To Fly' does little to expand on the themes explored more thoroughly in said doc. The problem here is a lack of a focus on the part of Herzog, who allows some plot strands to unfold to a point, but then frustratingly severs them without a proper conclusion. For about an hour in the middle of Dawn's running time, everything seems to hit its stride, and it appears to be unfolding tentatively and with genuine skill - taking things up several notches from the unemotional and dull opening. Bale and Zahn in particular excel in roles that have an indisputable emotional power - and not just in the staggering weight loss. There's a real sadness in Zahn's eyes that portrays a vast sense of emotion far beyond any other role of his career, and if there's any justice in the world, the former funnyman will bag his first Oscar nomination for this stunning performance. The same, however, cannot be said of the unbelievably irritating Jeremy Davies, who incoherently mumbles his way through another role. While a partial lack of urgency in the concluding twenty minutes will leave you scratching your head, Rescue Dawn is still a captivating story of survival that is helped enormously by a predictably brilliant Bale, and a stunning turn from Zahn.",3,Worth viewing,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1742,"['Christian', 'Bale', 'plays', 'naval', 'pilot', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'German-born', 'American', 'citizen', 'who', 'shot', 'down', 'early', 'stages', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Laos', 'then', 'kept', 'prisoner', 'other', 'POWs', 'small', 'shack', 'middle', 'jungle', 'struggle', 'survive', 'little', 'food', 'Dieter', 'long-winded', 'plan', 'escape', 'confines', 'camp', 'Opening', 'real', 'footage', 'village', 'being', 'bombed', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'feature', 'version', '1997', 'documentary', 'Dieter', 'Learns', 'Fly', 'little', 'expand', 'themes', 'explored', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'said', 'doc', 'problem', 'here', 'lack', 'focus', 'part', 'Herzog', 'who', 'plot', 'strands', 'unfold', 'point', 'then', 'frustratingly', 'proper', 'conclusion', 'hour', 'middle', 'Dawn', 'running', 'time', 'everything', 'hit', 'stride', 'be', 'unfolding', 'tentatively', 'genuine', 'skill', 'taking', 'things', 'up', 'several', 'notches', 'unemotional', 'dull', 'opening', 'Bale', 'Zahn', 'particular', 'excel', 'roles', 'have', 'indisputable', 'emotional', 'power', 'not', 'just', 'staggering', 'weight', 'loss', 'real', 'sadness', 'Zahn', 'eyes', 'vast', 'sense', 'emotion', 'far', 'other', 'role', 'career', 'justice', 'world', 'former', 'funnyman', 'will', 'bag', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'stunning', 'performance', 'same', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'unbelievably', 'irritating', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'who', 'incoherently', 'way', 'role', 'partial', 'lack', 'urgency', 'concluding', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'will', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'still', 'captivating', 'story', 'survival', 'helped', 'enormously', 'predictably', 'brilliant', 'Bale', 'stunning', 'turn', 'Zahn']",N/A

I did not see this film in a theatre, but I wish I had!I first heard of Dieter Dengler from the Guidebook For Marines. His story is mentioned in the Code Of Conduct chapter, as an example of how an American fighting-man should conduct himself as a P.O.W.As a Naval aviator during the Vietnam War, he served aboard the aircraft-carrier  U.S.S. Ranger. Dengler flew an AD Skyraider, a prop-plane designed for close air-support and reconaissance. Assigned to fly a secret mission to bombard targets in Laos, Dengler was shot down, and manged to evade capture for some time.Captured by Pathet Lao guerrillas, he was brutally beaten, and eventually interned in a small P.O.W. camp with two other Americans and a small group of Thais. All of the others were personnel employed by Air America, except for Duane Martin, who was an Air Force pilot.Having no intention of staying in this prison, Dengler improvised a number of tools for an escape attempt. He eventually mobilized the others into making an ingenious escape effort. When the time came, Dengler killed the guards with their own weapons. Dengler and Martin set out together, into the jungle, toiling through dense foliage, mud, incessant rain, illness ...and afflicted by such jungle-pests as leeches and insects. Sadly, Martin was later murdered by a Lao farmer. Dengler survived for 23 days in a hostile environment, hunted by Pathet Lao soldiers, before he was eventually rescued by an Air Force helicopter crew.This movie is a fine portrayal of Dengler's impressive and relentless will to survive.I do not know where the film was shot, but some truly incredible mountain and jungle landscape is featured throughout.Sadly, Mr. Dengler is no longer with us. Afflicted with ALS, he passed away on 7 February, 2001.Mr. Dengler was born in Germany, and witnessed World War II as a child, as Allied forces invaded in 1945. Watching the exploits of Allied fighter-pilots inspired him to become a pilot. As a teenager, he was apprenticed as a machinist, and saved his money to emmigrate to America. At age 18, he sailed to the U.S., and survived on the streets for a short time, before enlisting in the Air Force in 1957, where he  served as a gunsmith.Dengler took the test for aviation late in his enlistment, and passed. However, his enlistment was soon completed, before he could enroll in the program, and he moved to California to attend college. He was accepted into the Navy cadet Program, and was soon commissioned. He originally trained as a Skyraider pilot, but was trained to fly jet-aircraft after his P.O.W. ordeal. After his time in the Navy, Dengler was employed as a test-pilot for TWA.Another point of interest regarding Mr. Dengler:While attending S.E.R.E. school, Dengler escaped the simulated P.O.W. camp THREE TIMES, ...and was the only student in his group to actually GAIN weight!",5,Tale of a brilliant survivor,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2936,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'actually', 'found', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theatre', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'theatre', 'wish', 'had', 'first', 'heard', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'Guidebook', 'Marines', 'story', 'mentioned', 'Code', 'Conduct', 'chapter', 'example', 'how', 'American', 'fighting-man', 'should', 'conduct', 'P.O.W.As', 'Naval', 'aviator', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'served', 'aircraft-carrier', 'U.S.S', 'Ranger', 'Dengler', 'flew', 'AD', 'Skyraider', 'prop-plane', 'designed', 'close', 'air-support', 'reconaissance', 'Assigned', 'fly', 'secret', 'mission', 'bombard', 'targets', 'Laos', 'Dengler', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'manged', 'evade', 'capture', 'time.Captured', 'Pathet', 'Lao', 'guerrillas', 'was', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'eventually', 'interned', 'small', 'P.O.W', 'camp', 'two', 'other', 'Americans', 'small', 'group', 'Thais', 'others', 'were', 'personnel', 'employed', 'Air', 'America', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'who', 'was', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilot.Having', 'intention', 'staying', 'prison', 'Dengler', 'improvised', 'number', 'tools', 'escape', 'attempt', 'eventually', 'mobilized', 'others', 'making', 'ingenious', 'escape', 'effort', 'When', 'time', 'came', 'Dengler', 'killed', 'guards', 'own', 'weapons', 'Dengler', 'Martin', 'set', 'out', 'together', 'jungle', 'toiling', 'dense', 'foliage', 'mud', 'incessant', 'rain', 'illness', 'afflicted', 'such', 'jungle-pests', 'leeches', 'insects', 'Sadly', 'Martin', 'was', 'later', 'murdered', 'Lao', 'farmer', 'Dengler', 'survived', '23', 'days', 'hostile', 'environment', 'hunted', 'Pathet', 'Lao', 'soldiers', 'was', 'eventually', 'rescued', 'Air', 'Force', 'helicopter', 'crew.This', 'movie', 'fine', 'portrayal', 'Dengler', 'impressive', 'relentless', 'will', 'survive.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'truly', 'incredible', 'mountain', 'jungle', 'landscape', 'featured', 'throughout.Sadly', 'Mr.', 'Dengler', 'longer', 'Afflicted', 'ALS', 'passed', 'away', '7', 'February', '2001.Mr', 'Dengler', 'was', 'born', 'Germany', 'witnessed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'child', 'Allied', 'forces', 'invaded', '1945', 'Watching', 'exploits', 'Allied', 'fighter-pilots', 'inspired', 'become', 'pilot', 'teenager', 'was', 'apprenticed', 'machinist', 'saved', 'money', 'emmigrate', 'America', 'age', '18', 'sailed', 'U.S.', 'survived', 'streets', 'short', 'time', 'enlisting', 'Air', 'Force', '1957', 'where', 'served', 'gunsmith.Dengler', 'took', 'test', 'aviation', 'late', 'enlistment', 'passed', 'However', 'enlistment', 'was', 'soon', 'completed', 'could', 'enroll', 'program', 'moved', 'California', 'attend', 'college', 'was', 'accepted', 'Navy', 'cadet', 'Program', 'was', 'soon', 'commissioned', 'originally', 'trained', 'Skyraider', 'pilot', 'was', 'trained', 'fly', 'jet-aircraft', 'P.O.W', 'ordeal', 'time', 'Navy', 'Dengler', 'was', 'employed', 'test-pilot', 'TWA.Another', 'point', 'interest', 'regarding', 'Mr.', 'Dengler', 'attending', 'S.E.R.E', 'school', 'Dengler', 'escaped', 'simulated', 'P.O.W', 'camp', 'THREE', 'TIMES', 'was', 'only', 'student', 'group', 'actually', 'GAIN', 'weight']",N/A
1110454,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000WMA6QO,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 3]","Werner Herzog, the filmmaker behind such legendary films as ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" and the documentary ""Grizzly Man"" among many others, made a documentary called ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"" almost a decade ago. The filmmaker follows Dieter Dengler, a pilot with the United States Navy during the Vietnam War, as Dengler revisits the country where he was shot down and taken prisoner and as he returns to his home country of Germany. Herzog believed the story to be so powerful that he decided to make a film about the incident.""Rescue Dawn"", directed by Herzog and starring Christian Bale as Dieter along with Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn as two of his fellow POWs, follows Dieter as he prepares for his first mission as a pilot in the late 60s. He receives instructions to fly into Laos, before the war has even begun, to bomb suspected targets. During the mission he is quickly shot down and tries to attract a rescue copter or plane. Instead, soldiers and extremely angry militia find him and take him to a POW camp, where he meets Duane (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies), two of the handful of American soldiers who are already being held captive in a small clearing in the middle of the harsh, hot jungle. Their guards aren't giving them enough food or water, they are chained up at night, and Dieter realizes he simply can't sit around waiting until they starve to death or the guards decide to shoot them because they are bored. He comes up with an escape plan and tries to convince everyone that it will work. But as they are starving and any potential escape means living in the jungle for a significant period of time, they are frightened and scared of the prospects.I understand what Christian Bale is trying to do as Dieter, but the effect is still a little strange. And the character doesn't work. When we first meet Dieter, we could be watching a sequel to ""Top Gun"", the pilots are in a briefing, ready and raring to go, ready to jump into their planes and start flying. There are no political discussions about their mission and the objective, they are American pilots and their mission is their objective. And Dieter is particularly gung ho as this is his first mission. He smiles as everyone pats him on the back because they know this is the culmination of a lifelong dream for Dieter; Dengler was actually born in Germany and immigrated to the United States and became a citizen always dreaming of becoming a pilot and flying planes. Bale uses a very slight accent to portray Dengler's origins. And throughout the film, this accent gets a little more pronounced when Bale is trying to show Dengler's frustration. I get this part of the character. What was less successful for me was Bale's portrayal of Dengler's 'enthusiasm' throughout the film. As Dengler tries to convince the rest of the POWs, he seems to smile here and there, trying to show them that his plan will work, that there isn't a lot of danger out there. Throughout, he appears to remain particularly lucid and determined, as though the lack of food, water and livable conditions has no effect on him.When you watch Bale's performance next to that of Steve Zahn and Jeremy Davies, there is just something that doesn't mesh. Granted Duane and Gene have been in captivity longer, but even when Dengler is loosing weight (Bale will soon challenge DeNiro for the title of ""Most Method Actor in Films"" if he continues to lose and gain weight for every film role) he continues to appear determined and the madness affecting his friends never seems to enter the picture for Dengler. This, combined with the faint accent, makes the character seem less real even though I am sure Bale studied footage of the real Dengler, studied his mannerisms and voice.Because there are really no politics in this film, it becomes less interesting somehow. Initially, the pilots are gung ho for the mission, despite the fact they are about to bomb many villages. And the conclusion of the film seems to indicate Dengler is ready and willing to go on another mission, as soon as he has recovered. In fact, a coda states as much at the end of the film.I have not see ""Little Dieter Needs to Fly"", but I have to think that Herzog probably captured some remorse from the former pilot. In ""Rescue Dawn"", the story ends much earlier than this and we have no evidence of this.""Rescue Dawn"" is an interesting story but it lacks the necessary punch or a great performance from Bale to fully move the viewer.",3,Familiar POW Drama Lacks Punch,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,4487,"['Werner', 'Herzog', 'filmmaker', 'such', 'legendary', 'films', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', 'documentary', 'Grizzly', 'Man', 'many', 'others', 'made', 'documentary', 'called', 'Little', 'Dieter', 'Needs', 'Fly', 'almost', 'decade', 'ago', 'filmmaker', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'pilot', 'United', 'States', 'Navy', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Dengler', 'country', 'where', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'home', 'country', 'Germany', 'Herzog', 'believed', 'story', 'be', 'so', 'powerful', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'incident', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'directed', 'Herzog', 'starring', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Dieter', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'two', 'fellow', 'POWs', 'Dieter', 'first', 'mission', 'pilot', 'late', '60s', 'instructions', 'fly', 'Laos', 'war', 'even', 'begun', 'bomb', 'suspected', 'targets', 'mission', 'quickly', 'shot', 'down', 'tries', 'attract', 'rescue', 'copter', 'plane', 'Instead', 'soldiers', 'extremely', 'angry', 'militia', 'find', 'take', 'POW', 'camp', 'where', 'Duane', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Gene', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'two', 'handful', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'small', 'clearing', 'middle', 'harsh', 'hot', 'jungle', 'guards', 'are', ""n't"", 'giving', 'enough', 'food', 'water', 'are', 'chained', 'up', 'night', 'Dieter', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'around', 'waiting', 'starve', 'death', 'guards', 'decide', 'shoot', 'are', 'bored', 'up', 'escape', 'plan', 'tries', 'convince', 'everyone', 'will', 'work', 'are', 'starving', 'potential', 'escape', 'living', 'jungle', 'significant', 'period', 'time', 'are', 'frightened', 'scared', 'prospects.I', 'understand', 'what', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'trying', 'do', 'Dieter', 'effect', 'still', 'little', 'strange', 'character', ""n't"", 'work', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Dieter', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'sequel', 'Top', 'Gun', 'pilots', 'are', 'briefing', 'ready', 'raring', 'go', 'ready', 'jump', 'planes', 'start', 'flying', 'are', 'political', 'discussions', 'mission', 'objective', 'are', 'American', 'pilots', 'mission', 'objective', 'Dieter', 'particularly', 'gung', 'ho', 'first', 'mission', 'everyone', 'back', 'know', 'culmination', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'Dieter', 'Dengler', 'was', 'actually', 'born', 'Germany', 'immigrated', 'United', 'States', 'became', 'citizen', 'always', 'dreaming', 'becoming', 'pilot', 'flying', 'planes', 'Bale', 'very', 'slight', 'accent', 'portray', 'Dengler', 'origins', 'film', 'accent', 'little', 'more', 'pronounced', 'when', 'Bale', 'trying', 'show', 'Dengler', 'frustration', 'get', 'part', 'character', 'What', 'was', 'less', 'successful', 'was', 'Bale', 'portrayal', 'Dengler', ""'enthusiasm"", 'film', 'Dengler', 'convince', 'rest', 'POWs', 'smile', 'here', 'there', 'trying', 'show', 'plan', 'will', 'work', ""n't"", 'lot', 'danger', 'there', 'Throughout', 'remain', 'particularly', 'lucid', 'determined', 'lack', 'food', 'water', 'livable', 'conditions', 'effect', 'him.When', 'watch', 'Bale', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'just', 'something', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'Granted', 'Duane', 'Gene', 'have', 'been', 'captivity', 'longer', 'even', 'when', 'Dengler', 'loosing', 'weight', 'Bale', 'will', 'soon', 'challenge', 'DeNiro', 'title', 'Most', 'Method', 'Actor', 'Films', 'lose', 'gain', 'weight', 'film', 'role', 'appear', 'determined', 'madness', 'affecting', 'friends', 'never', 'enter', 'picture', 'Dengler', 'combined', 'faint', 'accent', 'character', 'seem', 'less', 'real', 'even', 'am', 'sure', 'Bale', 'studied', 'footage', 'real', 'Dengler', 'studied', 'mannerisms', 'voice.Because', 'are', 'really', 'politics', 'film', 'less', 'interesting', 'somehow', 'Initially', 'pilots', 'are', 'gung', 'ho', 'mission', 'fact', 'are', 'bomb', 'many', 'villages', 'conclusion', 'film', 'indicate', 'Dengler', 'ready', 'willing', 'go', 'mission', 'as', 'soon', 'recovered', 'fact', 'coda', 'as', 'much', 'end', 'film.I', 'have', 'not', 'see', 'Little', 'Dieter', 'Needs', 'Fly', 'have', 'think', 'Herzog', 'probably', 'captured', 'remorse', 'former', 'pilot', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'story', 'much', 'earlier', 'have', 'evidence', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'interesting', 'story', 'necessary', 'punch', 'great', 'performance', 'Bale', 'fully', 'move', 'viewer']",N/A

Christain Bale while on a secret mission to bomb targets in Laos crash lands in that area which leads him to become a prisoner of war in the Vietnam camp. He meets a few other pow's who have turned light in the head due to their continued incarceration. We are shown christian bale and his buddies tied to stones at night so that there is no chance for escape. They are given the crappiest food to eat, usually some rice and water. Basically they are treated a little better than at a Nazi concentration camp. But I could not make out what the movie was about. Its got a bit of comedic reliefwhen the pow's chatter around when christian Bale tries to have intelligent conversation with his buddies (a bunch of loonies). He then hatches out a plan for escape. Its a pow story half the way, with a bit of comedy and then the other half is an escape story. But the problem is that I found the sublte comedy to be kind of taking away from theeriousness or the horrificness the we should feel at a pow camp. The movie was kind of being light hearted about a very serious subject. It's a tough movie to classify. At times I felt it was like a documentary with seemingly unneccessary long takes or long winded conversations which did nothing to further the tempo of the story.regards, Vikram",2,A pow escape story with a slow documentary feel to it.,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,1390,"['Applauded', 'critics', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'one', 'only', 'find', 'quite', 'plodding', 'sedate', 'affair', 'Christain', 'Bale', 'secret', 'mission', 'bomb', 'targets', 'Laos', 'crash', 'lands', 'area', 'become', 'prisoner', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'camp', 'few', 'other', 'pow', 'who', 'have', 'turned', 'light', 'head', 'due', 'continued', 'incarceration', 'are', 'shown', 'christian', 'bale', 'buddies', 'tied', 'stones', 'night', 'so', 'chance', 'escape', 'are', 'given', 'crappiest', 'food', 'eat', 'usually', 'rice', 'water', 'Basically', 'are', 'treated', 'little', 'better', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'got', 'bit', 'comedic', 'reliefwhen', 'pow', 'chatter', 'when', 'christian', 'Bale', 'tries', 'have', 'intelligent', 'conversation', 'buddies', 'bunch', 'loonies', 'then', 'out', 'plan', 'escape', 'pow', 'story', 'way', 'bit', 'comedy', 'then', 'other', 'half', 'escape', 'story', 'problem', 'found', 'sublte', 'comedy', 'be', 'kind', 'taking', 'away', 'theeriousness', 'horrificness', 'should', 'feel', 'pow', 'camp', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'being', 'light', 'hearted', 'very', 'serious', 'subject', 'tough', 'movie', 'classify', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'documentary', 'seemingly', 'unneccessary', 'long', 'long', 'winded', 'conversations', 'did', 'nothing', 'further', 'tempo', 'story.regards', 'Vikram']",N/A

But this actually works in its favor, giving it a gritty and real feel. Christian Bale continues to amaze, not only is this role wildly different from Batman, but he inhabits it so well, that you pretty much forget it is Bale or you think this must be the ""real"" Bale.The story itself is incredibly compelling. Brutal, real, sad, inspiring. All of that. The more so because it is apparently mostly true (I gather that there are some descendants of some of the secondary characters who dispute some of the movie's accuracy).The movie isn't long, but you feel like you have been through the ringer.

What I got instead was a ham-acted, goofy-themed war flick that I struggled to get through.For a basic plot summary, ""Rescue Dawn"" tells the real-life story of pilot Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale) being shot down and captured at the very beginning of the Vietnam War.The most glaring problem with this film is that the tone is completely wrong for a war flick (based on a true story or not).  Dengler is never without a goofy smile on his face, he doesn't seem to respond to emotional situations, and towards the end he seems to forget everything he had previously experienced.  Thus, there is a total lack of drama throughout the production.  I even found some of the scenes bordering on offensive considering their portrayal of the U.S. Military.It doesn't help that the usually-incredible Christian Bale is given such a barren role/script to work with.  One could easily say this is his ""worst role ever"", but I think it's only because the whole shebang is a mess and never really gets into any meaty drama or emotional material that actually requires acting.Overall, I believe that director Werner Herzog really screwed this one up.
