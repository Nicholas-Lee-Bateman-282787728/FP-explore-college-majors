846171,ADA2BMGVFI8GQ,B0002V7TYW,"kh2ff7 ""kh2ff7""","[0, 0]","As I've said in my other reviews for this show, X-Men: Evolution is not the best kids' show out there, but it's got some good qualities.  My favorite element in the series is the Kurt/Nightcrawler character; I also like the high school setting and the anime style of the drawings, as well as the different scenarios the writers come up with.This disc contains my favorite episode from this series, where Kurt works up the courage to ask a girl to the upcoming school dance, only to angst about his ""freakish"" appearance that he keeps hidden with a holographic image inducer.  Turns out that not only does Amanda genuinely like him, but she already knows about both his real looks and his teleportation ability, a situation which only gets more interesting when monsters overrun the school - just at a time when a traumatized Kurt has sworn to never use his powers again.  Although Amanda shows up again in a couple of later episodes, it would have been really cool if her and Kurt's relationship had received more attention.Anyway, this disc also contains a Beast-centric episode, the introduction of Wanda / Scarlet Witch, and the season finale, which I liked better than both the first and third finales.  Wolverine gets kidnapped, Gambit and Colossus and a couple of others show up to fight the X-Men, Pietro betrays the Brotherhood, the identities of the mutants are revealed to the general public, we finally find out what Mystique's been up to - all great stuff.  This disc is highly recommended to any fan of X-Men: Evolution.",5,Season 2 conclusion,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1533,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'show', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'not', 'best', 'kids', 'show', 'there', 'got', 'good', 'qualities', 'favorite', 'element', 'series', 'Kurt/Nightcrawler', 'character', 'also', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'anime', 'style', 'drawings', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'scenarios', 'writers', 'come', 'up', 'with.This', 'disc', 'contains', 'favorite', 'episode', 'series', 'where', 'Kurt', 'up', 'courage', 'ask', 'girl', 'upcoming', 'school', 'dance', 'only', 'angst', 'freakish', 'appearance', 'hidden', 'holographic', 'image', 'inducer', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'Amanda', 'genuinely', 'already', 'real', 'looks', 'teleportation', 'ability', 'situation', 'only', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'monsters', 'overrun', 'school', 'just', 'time', 'when', 'traumatized', 'Kurt', 'sworn', 'never', 'use', 'powers', 'again', 'Amanda', 'up', 'again', 'couple', 'later', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'cool', 'Kurt', 'relationship', 'had', 'received', 'more', 'attention.Anyway', 'disc', 'also', 'Beast-centric', 'episode', 'introduction', 'Wanda', '/', 'Scarlet', 'Witch', 'season', 'finale', 'liked', 'better', 'first', 'third', 'finales', 'Wolverine', 'kidnapped', 'Gambit', 'Colossus', 'couple', 'others', 'show', 'up', 'fight', 'X-Men', 'Pietro', 'Brotherhood', 'identities', 'mutants', 'are', 'revealed', 'general', 'public', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Mystique', 'been', 'up', 'great', 'stuff', 'disc', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'Evolution']",X-Men: Evolution - Mystique's Revenge
846172,A1F92EK0MUNOVR,B0002V7TYW,Pecos Bill,"[38, 44]","I just wanted to leave a comment saying I don't understand why they keep releasing this series like this.  It's a great show, I'd love to buy it all on DVD, but having to buy it 4 episodes at a time on individual DVD's is frustrating, especially since there is no description here of where we're at in the timeline.  What season is this DVD from?  What part of the season?  I'll have to do my own research because there's no description of it around here.I know they must be doing it like this to appeal more to the allowance money audience, but I would like to see them continue to package entire seasons as they did with season 1.  Even if it's just 4 seperate boxes with some tape around it (pretty much what that season 1 collection was...) at least that would make it easier for me as a buyer.How hard can it be to sell me something called ""X-Men Evolution: Season 2 (The Whole Thing)""?So anyway, great show, season 1 extras on the DVD were awesome, but I could really go for some season-at-a-time packaging.",4,Pre-release comment from the peanut gallery,1094688000,"09 9, 2004",2004,1013,"['just', 'wanted', 'leave', 'comment', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'keep', 'releasing', 'series', 'great', 'show', ""'d"", 'love', 'buy', 'DVD', 'having', 'buy', '4', 'episodes', 'time', 'individual', 'DVD', 'frustrating', 'especially', 'description', 'here', 'where', ""'re"", 'timeline', 'What', 'season', 'DVD', 'What', 'part', 'season', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'own', 'research', 'description', 'here.I', 'know', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'appeal', 'more', 'allowance', 'money', 'audience', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'continue', 'package', 'entire', 'seasons', 'did', 'season', '1', 'Even', 'just', '4', 'seperate', 'boxes', 'tape', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'season', '1', 'collection', 'was', 'least', 'would', 'make', 'easier', 'buyer.How', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'sell', 'something', 'called', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'Season', '2', 'Whole', 'Thing', 'So', 'anyway', 'great', 'show', 'season', '1', 'extras', 'DVD', 'were', 'awesome', 'could', 'really', 'go', 'season-at-a-time', 'packaging']",X-Men: Evolution - Mystique's Revenge

I don't think I'd ever watched it all the way through, though.Like many of the WB Kids titles, X-Men Evolution is released with just a handful (5 in this case) of episodes per DVD. Unlike most (and perhaps all) of the other WB Kids title, they're actually in sequence. Mystique's Revenge is actually Season 2, Volume 4. My understanding after watching the trailers on the DVD is that Season 1 and Season 2 have each been released in their entirity on 4 DVD's apiece.I'm a little upset that I had never caught this toon before. I honestly knew very little about it before watching this DVD. It is an excellent series. They have definitely changed things around from the comic book and even from the movie. Wolverine, Storm and Beast seem to be the resident adults, while others including Cyclops and Jean Grey have been made teenagers. As corny as that sounds, it actually seems to work out quite well, at least in these five episodes.I'm not going to go into too much detail regarding the plot of the actual episodes. Some were lighter than others, but they did an excellent job leading into the 2-part season finale. Which leads to whyI'm now irritated. I loved the cartoon, and it was to be continued.
