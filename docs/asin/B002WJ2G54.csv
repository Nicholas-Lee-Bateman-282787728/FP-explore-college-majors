1296919,AY3XPKRAMKKY7,B002WJ2G54,C. G. King,"[5, 5]","I find it fascinating to see tidbits of how things are made, organic farms, etc. This series offers several new looks at things, such as: making sparkling wine, ricotta cheese, pasta, gathering chestnuts, raising animals in a healthy way and olive oil, to name a few.  The places visited are always interesting and range from Tuscany to Napa Valley to a sustainable farm north of New York City and include fascinating bits of info about whatever the subject is.  The information isn't extensive, just a glimpse, but often a view that I've not seen elsewhere and Eric's participation is always appealing.  He's easy on the eyes and I find his accent charming.  It adds to the ambience of these episodes for me.Each segment includes some time on site seeing the highlighted 'product' on hoof or being developed, a part showing how things work in the restaurant and then in Eric's private kitchen where he creates a dish that brings things together.  He offers tips as he works and although some are basic, some I'd not seen before anywhere.  Even the basic ones when presented in Eric's unassuming style seem to stick with me better.  He is a wonderful teacher, very relaxed and patient with his lessons that range from why you mince garlic in this way for this recipe to how to check doneness of chicken if a thermometer isn't handy.  He never seems rushed and the food he creates seems satisfying and accessible--something I really want to make and actually feel I can duplicate based on his instruction.I'd seen a few of the episodes on TV but far prefer watching them at my leisure rather than on a schedule and being able to watch some repeatedly to get all the information.  I watch a lot of TV chefs and cooking shows, but this series ranks at the top of my list.  Not only is Eric a good teacher but the filming is outstanding and seems to capture the best parts of whatever activity he's engaged in.  Highly recommended.",5,Delightful and delicious,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1927,"['find', 'fascinating', 'see', 'tidbits', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'made', 'organic', 'farms', 'etc', 'series', 'several', 'new', 'looks', 'things', 'such', 'making', 'sparkling', 'wine', 'ricotta', 'cheese', 'pasta', 'gathering', 'chestnuts', 'raising', 'animals', 'healthy', 'way', 'olive', 'oil', 'name', 'few', 'places', 'visited', 'are', 'always', 'interesting', 'range', 'Tuscany', 'Napa', 'Valley', 'sustainable', 'farm', 'north', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'include', 'fascinating', 'bits', 'info', 'whatever', 'subject', 'information', ""n't"", 'extensive', 'just', 'glimpse', 'often', 'view', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'Eric', 'participation', 'always', 'appealing', 'easy', 'eyes', 'find', 'accent', 'charming', 'ambience', 'episodes', 'me.Each', 'segment', 'time', 'site', 'seeing', 'highlighted', ""'product"", 'hoof', 'being', 'developed', 'part', 'showing', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'restaurant', 'then', 'Eric', 'private', 'kitchen', 'where', 'dish', 'things', 'together', 'tips', 'are', 'basic', ""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'Even', 'basic', 'ones', 'when', 'presented', 'Eric', 'unassuming', 'style', 'seem', 'stick', 'better', 'wonderful', 'teacher', 'very', 'relaxed', 'patient', 'lessons', 'range', 'why', 'mince', 'garlic', 'way', 'recipe', 'how', 'check', 'doneness', 'chicken', 'thermometer', ""n't"", 'handy', 'never', 'rushed', 'food', 'satisfying', 'accessible', 'something', 'really', 'want', 'make', 'actually', 'feel', 'can', 'duplicate', 'based', 'instruction.I', ""'d"", 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'TV', 'far', 'prefer', 'watching', 'leisure', 'rather', 'schedule', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'get', 'information', 'watch', 'lot', 'TV', 'chefs', 'cooking', 'shows', 'series', 'top', 'list', 'Not', 'only', 'Eric', 'good', 'teacher', 'filming', 'outstanding', 'capture', 'best', 'parts', 'activity', 'engaged', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
