245402,AYGHUCNGQ0HMF,6301106490,aaron wittenberg,"[2, 3]","This is the first movie I saw Sidney Poitier in, and I have to say he did an excellent job.The main characters are Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent out to catch a serial killer, Tom Berenger as a mountain man who lives in the woods, and his girlfriend Kirstie Alley who is giving a bunch of men a guided tour through the wilderness.Some other well known actors are in the movie, but those three play the more dominant role.I won't give away any scenes to spoil it, but I will say that the movie starts out in the city and quickly heads to the wilderness where the majority of the movie takes place. It only heads back to the city at the end.This is one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen. You don't see the killer through most of the movie. Even once he is shown, there are so many other actors on screen as well that you don't know which one he is.Suffice to say, excellent movie and terrific acting! Once the movie kicks into high gear, you won't leave your seat.The killer has an unusual trademark he does to all his victims after he kills them. You will see what I mean. The ending is very good and very well thought out. Not too many criminals would do some of the things this killer does to avoid being seen or caught.If you like suspense, definitely check this out!

Warren Stantin(Sidney Poitier) is an FBI agent in pursuit of a kidnapping and murder suspect. He appoints Jonathan Knox(Tom Berenger) as his guide. Jonathan would have been arrested for obstruction of justice if he didn't follow Warren's order. ""You're under arrest."" said Warren,after Jonathan initially refused to go along with him. Jonathan replied,""Bulls--t!"". Rounding out the cast is pre-Cheers Kirstie Alley as the leader of a group on a mountain mission. Another member(Clancy Brown) is the aforementioned suspect who ends up kidnapping Alley and threatening to fatally shoot her. ""You kill her and you'll die half a second later!"",Warren tells the suspect. Warren also says,""Let her go or die! That's the only deal you're gonna make!"" The suspect is shot by Warren and falls into the open seas. Poitier's previous film credits include STIR CRAZY,which he directed only,GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER,UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT and LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

When the FBI finds out they send Sidney Poitier to negotiate for the release. Things go very wrong and the merchants wife and maid are killed. The killer tries to escape to Canada by killing a fisherman headed for a guided tour in the mountains of Vancouver, British Columbia. Poitier enlists the service of Tom Berenger to track the murderer who has now taken his girlfriend hostage. Thrilling and funny this movie is one of the best I have seen. Poitier and Berenger are great as bickering old FBI city smart agent and young headstrong mountain guide. If you like either of these actors you will probably love this movie. Any fans of Poitier will love this movie. Far more exciting than ""In the Heat of the Night"". If you enjoyed the remake of ""The Jackal"" with Sidney you will love it. Those Berneger fans should love it as well. Not as gory as ""Platoon"" or ""Sniper"" it still has some scenes that will have some closing their eyes.Many people I ask have not seen this movie, and I recommend it to them. The movie takes place mainly in Washington state. It has beautiful scenery especially near Pugent Sound. The musical score is well done, and the acting is superb. Sidney Poitier as the aging FBI agent from the city and Tom Berenger as the young rugged outdoorsmen work great together with there constant bickering. Their mutual appreciation for one another slowly grows until they admire one another. Sidney saves Tom from a bear in a way that will have you laughing. Tom saves Sidney from the cold in a way that will have you wondering about what he means about mountain men with a chuckle. Good direction from Roger Spottiswoode. Sidney was 61 at the time this was filmed and he turns in one of his better performances. Kirstie Alley as Tom's girlfriend does a great job as a kidnapped guide. The whole movie keeps you guessing for some time as to the bad guys identity. Nice performances by the guided group. Many recognizable faces that have played bad guys, now all but one are just average guys. This is by far one of my favorite Action/Adventure/Mystery movies that I watch at least twice a year. Even my wife, who doesn't normally like this type movie, finds this one entertaining. Mostly because of the comradery that develops between Poitier and Berenger.

Acting is first rate by the four main characters (the bad guy included, of course).All good things said by other reviewers apply.However, I cannot rate it 5 stars due to a couple of implausibilities, one of them a fatal flaw to the verisimilitude of the plot.Other reviewers have pointed out, for instance, that once back in the city Berenger, a civilian, could not have been allowed to participate in the chase against an armed murderer, and even Poitier would not be allowed to go around with a gun in Canada. These are valid objections, but in my view there is a much more serious criticism.*Spoilers*The bad guy is a cold blooded murderer, who only keeps Alley alive because he needs her to lead him out of the woods. Then, why --apart from the Hollywood requirement that the good and brave girl must survive-- once he reaches Vancouver, he doesn't get rid of her?

That said, the fact I watched this movie four times over a 12-year span tells you how good it is (especially if you forget who the killer is!)It's a different kind of adventure story/crime thriller in that the beginning and ending scenes are both in big cities and the long middle part is in the Northwest wilderness. There is some great mountain scenery to enjoy as we tag along with two groups: one which has the killer and his hostage (a slim Kirstie Alley!) and another with an FBI man (Sidney Poitier) and his guide (Tom Berenger), who is the hostage's boyfriend.****spoilers**** had no problems with any of this story until the last 20 minutes when both parties reached Vancouver. Then, all credibility went out the window as Berenger is allowed to be side-by-side with Poitier as the latter and the killer shoot it out in various parts of the city. It gets worse as it goes on with Poitier a dead duck a couple of times but he never dies. Only Superman could have survived what he did, but he's the ""good guy "" so he makes it in the end. A little restraint in that ending would have kept this movie just great.Still, the story offers a lot of suspense, a lot of mystery, interesting action and scenery.....in other words, a lot to like.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","SHOOT TO KILL is worth watching not only for the fun interaction between Poitier and Berenger but, for fans of Poitier, it's probably even more relevant that their man, after ten years of directing, finally returns to the front of the camera. Not too surprisingly, he's as good as ever. No one says his lines quite like Sidney Poitier.He plays veteran FBI agent Warren Statin, and the film starts out with his botching of a hostage negotiation. Statin becomes obsessed and follows the psychopath to the rugged wilds bordering Washington and Canada. Statin, a dedicated city slicker, ""convinces"" hostile woodsman John Knox to act as tracker. Knox is one of those independent hermit types who aren't too comfortable around people and would rather be left alone (one rube notes: ""Aw, John's alright, he's just different."").It's a good thing for Special Agent Statin, then, that Knox's trail guide girlfriend Sarah (a really good Kirstie Alley) is escorting a party of outdoorsmen to a fishing site and that Statin's psychopath is hiding in this bunch. Knox, desperately worried for his girl (in his stoic kind of way), aims to eschew the tenderfoot trails for the harder but more direct paths. Can the FBI guy keep up?SHOOT TO KILL effectively combines genre elements of the buddy chase flick and that of man vs. nature. The nighttime city sequences at the start of the film build the suspense and give you a feel for just how twisted the villain is. In that early segment Poitier's character, calm and cool and twenty-two years on the job, inevitably gets outsmarted and outmaneuvered. And then to really remove him from familiar territory, here come the stunning wilderness locations, and you sense just how out of sorts the big city FBI guy must feel, exposed out in the harsh borderlands, buffeted by the unforgiving climate, munching on rodent. Poitier effortlessly translates this unease on film, and often he even puts a smile on your face. The camera provides a nice, constant change of pace by smartly shifting back and forth between Statin and Knox's pursuit and the goings-on in Sarah's hiking tour.There's a breathtaking sequence which starts with Berenger precariously navigating a rope bridge, and this was a hell of a crazy stunt and easily the highlight of the film. But SHOOT TO KILL is also graced with terrific smaller moments, some of them funny and respectively involving horses and a moose and a bear. And then, of course, there's that frequently taut, occasionally amusing interplay between Poitier and Tom Berenger, their characters very dissimilar sorts. Poitier, by the way, was in his early 60s when this film was shot, but you wouldn't have known it by watching him onscreen. He looked fit and could've passed for someone in his mid-40s or early 50s. Ever elegant and righteous and in shape is Sidney Poitier, and no amount of saddle sores or cuddling with shirtless mountainmen can change that.This is a good and often overlooked outdoors thriller, and I've seen it a bunch of times now down the years. Poitier's performance carries the film which, by the way, does take an implausible turn in the last 15 minutes or so. And a small part of me can't help but wonder why there weren't more FBI guys in on this manhunt. But, then again, Sidney Poitier is a baaaaad man.",4,Sidney Poitier goes hiking,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,3293,"['SHOOT', 'TO', 'KILL', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'only', 'fun', 'interaction', 'Poitier', 'Berenger', 'fans', 'Poitier', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'man', 'ten', 'years', 'directing', 'finally', 'front', 'camera', 'Not', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'No', 'one', 'lines', 'quite', 'Sidney', 'Poitier.He', 'veteran', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Warren', 'Statin', 'film', 'out', 'botching', 'hostage', 'negotiation', 'Statin', 'obsessed', 'psychopath', 'rugged', 'wilds', 'bordering', 'Washington', 'Canada', 'Statin', 'dedicated', 'city', 'slicker', 'convinces', 'hostile', 'woodsman', 'John', 'Knox', 'act', 'tracker', 'Knox', 'one', 'independent', 'hermit', 'types', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'comfortable', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'one', 'rube', 'notes', 'Aw', 'John', 'alright', 'just', 'different', '.It', 'good', 'thing', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Statin', 'then', 'Knox', 'trail', 'guide', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'really', 'good', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'escorting', 'party', 'outdoorsmen', 'fishing', 'site', 'Statin', 'psychopath', 'hiding', 'bunch', 'Knox', 'desperately', 'worried', 'girl', 'stoic', 'kind', 'way', 'eschew', 'tenderfoot', 'harder', 'more', 'direct', 'paths', 'Can', 'FBI', 'guy', 'keep', 'up', 'SHOOT', 'TO', 'KILL', 'effectively', 'genre', 'elements', 'buddy', 'chase', 'flick', 'man', 'vs.', 'nature', 'nighttime', 'city', 'sequences', 'start', 'film', 'build', 'suspense', 'give', 'feel', 'just', 'how', 'twisted', 'villain', 'early', 'segment', 'Poitier', 'character', 'calm', 'cool', 'twenty-two', 'years', 'job', 'inevitably', 'outsmarted', 'outmaneuvered', 'then', 'really', 'remove', 'familiar', 'territory', 'here', 'come', 'stunning', 'wilderness', 'locations', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'sorts', 'big', 'city', 'FBI', 'guy', 'must', 'feel', 'exposed', 'out', 'harsh', 'borderlands', 'buffeted', 'unforgiving', 'climate', 'munching', 'rodent', 'Poitier', 'effortlessly', 'unease', 'film', 'often', 'even', 'smile', 'face', 'camera', 'nice', 'constant', 'change', 'pace', 'smartly', 'shifting', 'back', 'forth', 'Statin', 'Knox', 'pursuit', 'goings-on', 'Sarah', 'hiking', 'breathtaking', 'sequence', 'Berenger', 'precariously', 'navigating', 'rope', 'bridge', 'was', 'hell', 'crazy', 'stunt', 'easily', 'highlight', 'film', 'SHOOT', 'TO', 'KILL', 'also', 'graced', 'terrific', 'smaller', 'moments', 'funny', 'respectively', 'involving', 'horses', 'moose', 'bear', 'then', 'course', 'frequently', 'occasionally', 'amusing', 'interplay', 'Poitier', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'characters', 'very', 'dissimilar', 'sorts', 'Poitier', 'way', 'was', 'early', '60s', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'watching', 'onscreen', 'looked', 'fit', 'could', ""'ve"", 'passed', 'someone', 'mid-40s', 'early', '50s', 'Ever', 'elegant', 'righteous', 'shape', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'amount', 'saddle', 'sores', 'cuddling', 'shirtless', 'mountainmen', 'can', 'change', 'that.This', 'good', 'often', 'overlooked', 'outdoors', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bunch', 'times', 'now', 'years', 'Poitier', 'performance', 'film', 'way', 'take', 'implausible', 'turn', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'small', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'FBI', 'guys', 'manhunt', 'then', 'again', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'baaaaad', 'man']",Shoot to Kill VHS

In this movie, he played an aging, city-grown FBI agent on a trail of a wicked murderer and kidnapper played by Claney Brown who flee into the deep wilderness with his victim. Aiding him is a mountain man played by Tom Berenger who have a special interest in this case since the latest kidnapped victim happened to be his girlfriend played by Kristie Alley.The movie proves to be highly entertaining, well acted and well scripted. Interestingly, Poitier and Berenger played off each other pretty well as mutual respect grows between them as they chased after Brown and Alley. Brown proves to be quite good and I have to admit that Alley wasn't too bad either.The movie maintained a good even pace and keep the audience wondering about the possible outcome. There are several interesting and funny scenes as describes previously by another reviewer. The movie take a perception of a ""fish out of the water"" concept. I have to admit that Sideny Poitier is NOT someone I would thought would be in a movie about being in wilderness. Poiter portrayed his wilderness unease quite well. Overall, I hate to think that this movie might be considered to be ""overlook"" by Sidney Poitier fans. Berenger gave one of his better performances in a ""non-historical"" role (he's quite good in playing Longstreet and Theodore Reoosevelt in these TNT shows).The DVD of this movie is your basic stripped down verison. There's no extras to speak off althought the wide-screen 16:9 image proves to be pretty good and sounds were clear and easy to listen.

Sidney Poitier as FBI agent Warren Stantin joins Tom Berenger (Jonathan Knox) to go after fugitive who has joined a group lead by Jonathan's girlfriend Sarah Rennell played by Kirstie Alley.  The chase takes place in the forests and mountains of North America.  One of the fun parts of this is both Sarah(Kirstie) and Jonathan (Berenger) are woods, forest, mountain smart but Stantin (Poitier) is not.  Since Stantin IS the FBI agent tracking, he 'requires' Jonathan take him along on the trek to rough country.  Scenery is beautiful and the supporting cast does and excellent job for the most part.  The 'chase' follows them through the mountains, streams, forests and into canada and ultimately to 'civilization' (a city).  Plot is simple and has been done many times in various ways, Narrow Margin with Gene Hackman comes to mind, same kind of general idea with different plot.  As always both Berenger and Poitier give excellent performances.  This is a good choice for an adventure movie without a lot of subtle or in depth messages.

Berenger plays a tracker, whose girlfriend runs a trail guide business. The girlfriend (Kirstie Alley in an outdoor role!) has taken her latest group of travelers out into the woods, and Poitier believes that the killer is among them. If that's not bad enough, a deadly storm looks like it's coming on.The real fun in this movie is in the first half, where you see all of the men in Kirstie Alley's group. All of them are recognizable character actors, and most of them have played villains in other movies before. So which one of them is the killer? I guessed wrong the first time.Unfortunately, this gets revealed about halfway through, and the movie returns to the formula. However, the excellent performances and lush cinematography elevate it beyond the norm.
