I miss you, Josie'."" That's good acting. As for Linda Blair: she's always reliable and solid, but here it takes her a little while to warm up. In the admissions office near the beginning, Linda is a bit too somnambulistic(""I don't think I need to be here""), but minutes later, when she has discovered her father brought her suitcase from home, Linda gets the juices going: ""Who brought it? Why didn't you tell me he was here?"" This is a wrenching moment. In this horrible place, with ugly walls and sterile decor, Chris is being jerked this way and that--and then come to find out, her own father was just there and didn't even want to talk to her. It's a powerful movie, and should touch anyone who's had a troubled youth. The low-budget, documentary quality of the movie was deliberate(it looked this way even on it's first TV airing), and the DVD will only enhance its 'dated' look, but at the time it was a ratings bonanza and made Linda Blair one of the highest paid actresses working in telefilms.

354158,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,6303060226,Kasey G,"[1, 3]","Too tame to be an exploitation film yet too violent and adult to be an ABC Afterschool Special, ""Born Innocent"" suffers from this middle-of-the-road stance.Cherub-faced Linda Blair (the Pia Zadora of the '70s and a then-hot-commodity due to her appearance in ""The Exorcist"") plays 14-year-old chronic runaway Christine Parker who is sent to a girls' reform school after her parents sign over their rights to the courts.The film looks promising when she first arrives (a resident eggs another girl on to ""Hit her....hit her"") and we meet the requisite lesbians and teenage hookers but this film never lives up to its potential.Another problem is that Blair doesn't have the ability to carry the movie and by the second half when we meet the parents and the teacher and warden get more screen time, it's too little, too late.The transformation of Linda's character from baby-faced innocent to hardened inmate is illustrated by the contrast of her carefree image on a swing to smoking cigarettes and carving her initials into her own flesh.The downbeat ending doesn't help the film, in which the teacher (whom all the girls refer to as ""Mom"" -- she's like a cross between Betty Buckley and Sandy Duncan) blubbers as she realizes she won't be able to ""save"" Linda/Christine.This movie has a reputation and cult following, probably due to the shower room scene where poor Linda is sexually assaulted with a broom handle while a gang of girls hold her down.But overall it's really a pretty dull affair. If you want something from the same era but much more fun and entertaining, check out 1973's ""The Baby"" starring Ruth Roman.I wouldn't recommend paying the high price this out-of-print DVD commands.

354166,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,6303060226,Noirdame,"[7, 7]","Linda Blair, immediately following her triumph in ''The Exorcist'' was cast in this then controversial TV movie. Christine Parker is a young runaway from an abusive home whose parents hand her over to the state. She finds herself in a detention home, where she discovers the even harsher realities of the young girls who reside there - unloved, troubled, and angry, who have the tendency to vent all their aggression onto newcomers. She finds herself as the target of their rage on evening in the shower room, where five of her fellow inmates gang up on her and violate her with a toilet plunger handle. Considered overly graphic at the time of its original airing in 1974, the scene was cut for later airings, but has been restored on DVD. Blair's nipple can be briefly seen for a few moments and that may explain why the scene was cut in subsequent TV broadcasts. As disturbing as it is, the rape is essential to the film's plot and adds to the anguish that Chris and her peers experience. When she has the chance to go home for a brief stay, her abusive father (Richard Jaeckel, magnificent) slaps her and her mother, leading the teen to run away again, taking her right back to where she started. Kim Hunter is effective as the passive, meek mother who endures her husband's insensitivity and mistreatment. Blair went on to give some more great performances in the late 70s, such as another TV movie, ""Sarah T: Portrait Of A Teenage Alcoholic"" and the theatrical releases ""Sweet Hostage"", ""Summer Of Fear"" and ""Hell Night"". Not long after, she found herself in exploitation flick hell. She is an outstanding actress, giving her all to every project, and it would have been nice if she had found some more mainstream material. Joanna Miles as the compassionate teacher, is the voice of reason and perhaps of caring in a system that does not want to take a bigger step towards actually considering the welfare of these troubled youths. Allyn Ann McLerie, as the well-meaning but ineffectual housemother Lasko, conveys the frustration and defeatist attitude of a woman who keeps things together but can't bring herself to actually make a difference in the lives of her girls. The portrayals of the other adolescents are right on target, a diverse group who all share the same pain, so much so that they become bonded in a hardened, indifferent way.
