1590107,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B009AJB0YM,a,"[0, 0]","The film ""10 Years"" tries to be a poignant, fun look at life ten years after high school. It has a competent cast and a lot of potential, and indeed there are some moments which are amusing and charming. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have mentioned, there's not much going on beneath the surface. Despite a noble effort at realism and complexity, the players are still largely caricatures - the clueless jock, the not-so-glamorous beauty queen, the moody rock star with unrequited love.  The movie drifts along with no focus, and the scenarios feel cliched: a drunken bully harasses a group of nerds with an unwanted apology, a wife discovers a secret side to her husband from his past, a guy seeks a balance between his current girlfriend and his high school sweetheart, and an unhappily married man tries to haplessly pick up girls.  Nothing feels entirely original, and despite some decent acting, none of the characters really develop an identity of their own.The two-hour film drags in places and could probably have benefitted from some tighter pacing.  Unlike some of Anchor Bay's other films, this one really feels low budget and a bit amateurish, as if everyone involved in this production knew it was destined to be a forgettable impulse rental.  Fans of ""Parks and Recreation"" might be interested in seeing Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza in the same film, although they don't really appear together and poor Aubrey is completely wasted in a tiny, throwaway part.  Ultimately this might be an interesting rental if you are anticipating a high school reunion or just experienced one.

1590112,AM9YB0BKXFH7Z,B009AJB0YM,"B. Ackley ""jumpstudios""","[3, 5]","I thought ""10 years"" would be a funny, light slice of life comedy set at a high school reunion. Being a comedy I anticipated a film with some predictable stuff but also to have funny dialogue and comedic elements. I was wrong.""10 Years"" was a painfully uninteresting film filled with generic characters, completely cliched situations and no plot. The film has no character development and relies on stereotypes (the bully, the jock, the musician, the hot girl) to create its cast. The film starts off slow as we watch several people chatting about high school and heading out for the reunion. Main character Jake (Channing Tatum) is in love with his current girlfriend but his old flame whom he has not seen in years shows up at the reunion and stirs up old feelings. Other characters discuss the challenges of being married, working for the man and making amends for their mistakes in the past. The dialogue ranges from boring to hokey. Any insight into who the characters were or their growth since high school as people is near absent. Given the talent in this film one would think the actors might be able to elevate the material in the film above a vanity project for Channing Tatum (who also produced) but sadly they do not.I'm sure some viewers will think this is a realistic depiction of life and enjoy it. For me high school reunions are exciting only to catch up with people you haven't seen in years. We never really know any of these characters and that is where the film ultimately fails. Overall, if you are looking for a boring 2 hours where you listen to people you don't care about and missed your own high school reunion this film will do nicely. Otherwise if you are want to have a fun movie night there are plenty of other films out there to watch.",1,Makes a Real High School Reunion seem exciting,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1768,"['thought', '10', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'light', 'slice', 'life', 'comedy', 'set', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'Being', 'comedy', 'anticipated', 'film', 'predictable', 'stuff', 'also', 'have', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'comedic', 'elements', 'was', 'wrong', '10', 'Years', 'was', 'painfully', 'uninteresting', 'film', 'filled', 'generic', 'characters', 'completely', 'cliched', 'situations', 'plot', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'relies', 'stereotypes', 'bully', 'jock', 'musician', 'hot', 'girl', 'create', 'cast', 'film', 'off', 'slow', 'watch', 'several', 'people', 'chatting', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'heading', 'out', 'reunion', 'Main', 'character', 'Jake', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'love', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'old', 'flame', 'whom', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'up', 'reunion', 'up', 'old', 'feelings', 'Other', 'characters', 'discuss', 'challenges', 'being', 'married', 'working', 'man', 'making', 'amends', 'mistakes', 'past', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'hokey', 'insight', 'who', 'characters', 'were', 'growth', 'high', 'school', 'people', 'near', 'absent', 'Given', 'talent', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'actors', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'elevate', 'material', 'film', 'vanity', 'project', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'sadly', 'do', ""'m"", 'sure', 'viewers', 'will', 'think', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'life', 'enjoy', 'high', 'school', 'reunions', 'are', 'exciting', 'only', 'catch', 'up', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'characters', 'where', 'film', 'ultimately', 'Overall', 'are', 'looking', 'boring', '2', 'hours', 'where', 'listen', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'missed', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'nicely', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'want', 'have', 'fun', 'movie', 'night', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'films', 'there', 'watch']",10 Years

1590114,A2582KMXLK2P06,B009AJB0YM,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","10 Years does quite possibly the worst thing ever- it portrays a 10-year high school reunion as realistic as possible.  The problem?  Being realistic as possible in this case does NOT make for an interesting concept.  You've been to your high school reunions.  You know what they're like.  People have conversations, they walk around holding drinks in their hands, they see old girlfriends/boyfriends and recall their old crushes and first loves, they remember and reminisce about their high school days, they talk about all the changes that have occurred in their lives since high school, they mention their careers, families, everything you do when you haven't seen a group of people in a while.  Now...what happens when you try to make an ENTIRE movie around this one simple concept?  You get a plotless, plodding, boring waste of time.And that's exactly what 10 years is- a colossal waste of my time, and surely yours.  I think this should be a perfect contender for the worst movie ever.  The only parts that could even qualify as having a plot are whenever the guys stand around with their hands in their pockets and feel nervous around the girls they've always wanted in high school but were too shy or nervous then so they wait until now, believing they've built enough confidence to approach them.  Of course, everyones lives have changed since high school so the guys can't come right out and say what they *really* want to say.  That being, ""I love you and always have!""  The girls act the same way.  Shy, awkward, not really sure how to communicate with their old classmates.  But... is this really what you want to see for the first HOUR of a movie?  Not at all.The movie makes the fatal mistake of believing that this one realistic concept is enough to base an entire storyline around, despite no such storyline even existing, so rather insultingly and hilariously, the second half of the movie is when everything winds down and the drinkers are now drunks and humiliating themselves on stage by singing out of tune or passing out drunk.  Why is this insulting and hilarious?  Because by this point, the movie writers actually think the writing in the first half is solid enough that we should care how these events turn out in the second half.  The writers think these characters have already been established given the uneventful lines they were given in the first half of the movie.  So... now we're supposed to care which woman ends up with which man, and we're supposed to care about the romantic scenes we see at the end that are entirely pointless and uninteresting due to a severe lack of character development.

Some are famous, some are successful, some have regrets, and some haven't changed at all. Channing Tatum headlines the b-level all star cast, and is attending the reunion with his girlfriend, played by his real-life wife Jenna Dewan-Tatum. He's there with his girlfriend, but longs to see, Mary (Rosario Dawson), his high school sweetheart that got away.Overall this struck me as a tame, pleasant movie with a good story and quality acting. Sure, it had a little drug use, bad language, and a lot of drinking, but overall the movie had a good heart. No gross out humor, no malicious characters stealing wives or girlfriends or hurting those around them.Channing Tatum headlines but Chris Pratt (of Parks and Recreation fame) is very funny as the guy trying to apologize to all the kids he made fun of in high school. Kate Mara plays the cute, shy girl that no one noticed, or at least she thought no one ever noticed her until she meets her admirer.This is a great date night movie. Not necessarily a great movie, but one that made me happy to have seen it. It is a movie anyone can relate to if you went to high school. Because everyone grows older and everyone has regrets.

For the better part of the movie I really didn't care for it.  The saving grace was a little towards the end, when the cheesy comedy turned a little serious and became a little touching, adding more meaning to an otherwise meaningless movie.  Rosario Dawson's plot line had the most impact, and she was also the one who did the best of all the actors.

I enjoyed it, but I can't say it was fantastic. As a comedy, it wasn't that funny. As a high school reunion revenge fantasy, it was also lukewarm. As a romance, also not that scintillating. But it had a little bit of all these things and was at least as entertaining as my own high school reunion. I am only giving it 3 out of 5 stars.I like Rosario Dawson a lot. Her story arc was a bit muddled for me to follow. She liked Channing Tatum's character in high school but for some reason--try as I might I couldn't follow what that was--they drifted apart. Now they are both in other relationships but have unfinished business, even if it doesn't amount to much. Interesting back story is that Jenna Dewan-Tatum, who plays his current girl friend, is now his real-life wife. Justin Long is another actor that I like. His story is also not that great, but good to see you again. Justin. I recognized Scott Porter from The Good Wife where he was Kalinda's rival investigator Blake Calamar. He and Archie Panjabi had some super charged scenes where she came at him with a baseball bat. Much less interesting here. Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza play a cute but quirky couple on Parks and Recreation. Here they are not so cute coupled with other people. Plaza is distressed about her boyfriend's past--until she is won over by his break dancing. Pratt is now fat and married, and realizes he was a bully and a jerk in high school. He tries to make amends, but does it in a drunken and obnoxiously aggressive manner.There is one other story arc about a guy who has a hit song inspired by one of his classmates who was only vaguely aware of him. While looking for photos of her they can only find one, and as soon as she comments on her yellow shoes, you know that they are going to turn up in the lyrics to his one hit wonder. Drunken karaoke at Pretzels, the dive bar they all hung out at, provides the setting. In spite of the fact that you know it is coming from a mile away, it is still a touching moment. Oscar Isaac, as Reeves, has a background in music and went to Julliard. He does a more than credible job as the troubadour. He kept reminding me of David Krumholtz, if Krumholtz had come from Guatemala, as Oscar has.The bottom line is that 10 Years is a pleasant way to pass the time if you have nothing better to do.",3,10 Years Seems More Like 100,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,2431,"[""'m"", 'joking', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'lot', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'regardless', 'material', 'enjoyed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'fantastic', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'was', 'also', 'lukewarm', 'romance', 'also', 'not', 'scintillating', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'things', 'was', 'least', 'as', 'entertaining', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'am', 'only', 'giving', '3', '5', 'stars.I', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'lot', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'bit', 'muddled', 'follow', 'liked', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'character', 'high', 'school', 'reason', 'try', 'might', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'drifted', 'apart', 'Now', 'are', 'other', 'relationships', 'have', 'unfinished', 'business', 'even', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'Interesting', 'back', 'story', 'Jenna', 'Dewan-Tatum', 'who', 'current', 'girl', 'friend', 'now', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Justin', 'Long', 'actor', 'like', 'story', 'also', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'see', 'again', 'Justin', 'recognized', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'Good', 'Wife', 'where', 'was', 'Kalinda', 'rival', 'investigator', 'Blake', 'Calamar', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'had', 'super', 'charged', 'scenes', 'where', 'came', 'baseball', 'bat', 'Much', 'less', 'interesting', 'here', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'play', 'cute', 'quirky', 'couple', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'Here', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'cute', 'coupled', 'other', 'people', 'Plaza', 'distressed', 'boyfriend', 'past', 'won', 'over', 'break', 'dancing', 'Pratt', 'now', 'fat', 'married', 'was', 'bully', 'jerk', 'high', 'school', 'make', 'amends', 'drunken', 'obnoxiously', 'aggressive', 'manner.There', 'one', 'other', 'story', 'arc', 'guy', 'who', 'hit', 'song', 'inspired', 'one', 'classmates', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'looking', 'photos', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'one', 'as', 'soon', 'comments', 'yellow', 'shoes', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'turn', 'up', 'lyrics', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'Drunken', 'karaoke', 'Pretzels', 'dive', 'bar', 'hung', 'out', 'setting', 'spite', 'fact', 'know', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'still', 'touching', 'moment', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Reeves', 'background', 'music', 'went', 'Julliard', 'more', 'credible', 'job', 'troubadour', 'kept', 'reminding', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'Krumholtz', 'had', 'come', 'Guatemala', 'Oscar', 'has.The', 'bottom', 'line', '10', 'Years', 'pleasant', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do']",10 Years

This doesn't detract one bit from the movie as the real quality lies in the screenwriting.

1590151,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009AJB0YM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Oh, the high school reunion movie!  As a place for big surprises, you can't beat the environment of catching up with people you once knew to see if they turned out the way in which you anticipated.  In many ways, it's easy for everyone to identify with some aspect or group in the high school social scene--so the reunion comedies can oftentimes strike a nostalgic chord with viewers.  ""10 Years"" boasts an incredibly appealing cast and is, simply put, easy enough to like.  It doesn't break any new ground, there are no shocking or uncomfortable revelations, and it plays out just as you know it will.  But despite its familiarity, it still is a pleasant (if unchallenging) way to spend your time.  A slew of famous, or almost famous, faces fill the cast and the picture has a relaxing charm that just might make you wistful for your younger days.  It might not be the freshest movie you've ever seen, but it is quite enjoyable and even sweet.  And that's perfectly okay in my book.Among the stars assembled for this little picture are Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan-Tatum, Chris Pratt, Rosario Dawson, and Justin Long, but almost everyone is recognizable.  There are a number of disparate plot threads as people catch up with each other and their lives.  I particularly liked Pratt as a reformed bully intent on making amends.  As the night progresses and the liquor flows, Pratt resorts to some of his old tricks much to the chagrin of his suffering pregnant wife (a great Ari Graynor).  Another story that I enjoyed involved Oscar Isaac as a successful recording artist who reunites with an unrequited love (Kate Mara).  The movie's sweetest moment comes as he sings his hit song and its lyrics come as a pleasant surprise to Mara (always an underrated presence).  Other story lines range from amusing to cathartic.  If anything, perhaps too much build-up was given to the reconnection of former flames Tatum and Dawson.  Ostensibly the dramatic focal point of the movie (and nicely handled), I liked the more unexpected sidelines I mentioned above a bit more.In the end, ""10 Years"" succeeds because of its rather modest ambitions.  I found it charming and fun with hints of sadness, just like life.  Did it surprise me?  Not really.  But that worked to the movie's advantage in this case.  It made me remember the silliness of youth and reflect on how we're all meant to grow up from those days.  The screenplay is far subtler than some comparable pictures, and that's a good thing too.

She plays the high school hottie who comes to the ten-year high school reunion glamorously dressed, playing every bit the vamp.  But as in the Cinderella tale, when Justin Long as Marty and Max Minghella as A.J. follow her home and give her the honor of lacing her front yard tree with toilet paper, her castle is decidedly suburban and her situation unstable with two children from two different men.  The transition she has from the life of the party to the struggling woman trying to bring up her kids in her parents' old house is completely believable and riveting.  Watch ""10 Years"" for Lynn Collins.Channing Tatum has developed into a big movie star, usually likeable and charming, but not on the young actor list most likely to win an Oscar.  In this film, he plays Jake who was the high school prom king.  Channing's real-life wife Jenna Dewan-Tatum plays Jess, his girlfriend to whom he tries to find the nerve to propose.  Rosario Dawson is beautiful as Jake's high school flame.  Ron Livingston plays Dawson's husband Paul.  As the outsider, Livingston is not given much to do.  As an actor with numerous credits, I wondered why he took such a flat role.Ari Graynor also does a fine job as Sam, the wife of the class bully, Cully, played by Chris Pratt.  He's so obnoxious that one wonders what the attraction was in the first place.  But Graynor copes well with a script that has her try to convince us that she's holding the marriage together, maybe because of the children.  Her one moment where she breaks out is delightful, but then Sam backtracks to stand by her man.Oscar Isaac has a nice appearance as the sensitive guy Reeves who is a singer and has carried a torch for his high school crush who inspired a hit song, which he sings for her.""10 Years"" is entertaining, but hardly riveting.

1590175,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B009AJB0YM,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","One has to wonder how a movie like 10 YEARS gets made.  It's about a bunch of former classmates getting together for their 10 year high school reunion.  It's a mild comedy, but it is not about the comedy...there are no laugh-out-loud moments.  It's a modest drama...nothing truly earth-shattering or original happens.  Ultimately, the movie doesn't really shed any new light on the human condition.  It doesn't provide a terrific ""diversion from everyday life.""  It's just vaguely interesting as its being watched and then fades from the memory nearly as quickly.10 YEARS does have some nice performances going for it.  We get to see some fun actors playing some roles that (for the most part) are not larger than life.  They are (mostly) age appropriate.  Their dialogue is mostly well-done and believable.  It's just that nothing they are involved in feels particularly meaningful.  I'm totally okay with a movie not feeling it needs some ""larger"" meaning.  Slice-of-life is okay with me.  But 10 YEARS is just too laid back, and perhaps it has TOO many plot-lines.  We're introduced to a BUNCH of characters, and we can't get to know many of them very well.  If some of the lines had been dropped and the others developed a bit more richly, perhaps the movie could have resonated.The actor taking the most screen time is Channing Tatum.  He's returning to town with his long-time girlfriend, and they are both aware that he may run into his high school sweetheart (Rosario Dawson).  The interplay is well-done...but because the movie doesn't want to take on anything too dramatic, their reunion is flat and only occasionally interesting.  It may be realistic, but it isn't dramatic.  But we do get a chance to see Tatum taking on a smaller-than-life role for a change, and he does just fine.  He's not the next ""great actor"" of our generation, but he has shown a great ability lately to modulate his persona nicely to fit the demands of his roles, be they romantic, dramatic or comedic.  One can do a lot worse than that.  If he continues to develop, he could have a decent career.  He's no longer just a lunkhead.Chris Pratt and Ari Graynor pair up well here.  They're high school sweethearts who married and stayed in the same small town.  He has failed to grow up, except that he's developed an adult sized alcohol problem, and he proceeds to get stinking drunk, but also has the idea of apologizing to all the ""nerds"" he tormented during high school.  Graynor follows behind, trying to clean up the damage all his good intentions cause.  It's a bit over-the-top but somehow believable...aided by Pratt's full commitment to ""jerkiness"" and Graynor's growing discontent.Speaking of Pratt, his PARKS AND RECREATION cast mate Aubry Plaza shows up as the new wife of classmate Brian Geharty, who reunites with his HURT LOCKER cast mate Anthony Mackie.  Their subplot is silly and completely dispensable.  Mackie comes off the most like a complete caricature.  I think he's supposed to be funny, but the writing gives him nothing.  It's as though writer/director Jamie Linden was just lining up all the folks he could to be in his movie and then tossing roles at them, with varying degrees of success.The most ""movie-like"" plot involved Justin Long (too old and haggard looking) and Max Minghella as reunited best friends/rivals, as they attempt to impress former classmate Anna (Lynn Collins).  They each play their characters at a heightened level from the rest of the film, and while their plot progresses in a more predictable way, at least things happen, lessons are learned and their final scene together is by far the most touching moment of the film.  Which all goes to prove that down-playing a role is not always the best move.  In my mind, Collins steals the whole movie.Interesting note (at least, interesting to me).  The movie was, surprisingly, filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I live.  It takes place in a fictitious small town called Lake something-or-other.  I recognized the city...but it is not well-featured.  This is a small film and no doubt filmed here due to the nice financial credits the state gives for film production...not because it completed any aesthetic idea for the director.10 YEARS is not a bad movie, but it is completely forgettable.  If you're a HUGE fan of one of the stars, you should see it.

It is a simple concept with a recognizable cast and familiar plot devices that leaves its audience satisfied but not particularly moved.A few things are predictable and cliche, like the musician who wrote a song that everyone loves but which the girl he likes has never heard. (The song is really cliche too, a la ""Delilah"".) Also, where is everyone? It is convenient that so few people actually showed up to the reunion and that they all know each other in some capacity and are able to mingle well.Some of the cliches work though, such as the stereotyped characters. Chris Pratt is excellent as the overbearing drunk who just wants to apologize to all of the nerds he made miserable in high school. I also thought it was amusing to see the white kid who wished he was black all grown up.I reacted positively to the realism in this movie. This isn't the wild party from those high school teen movies where people you never would expect to hook up do, and the cops inevitably show up. They go to the reunion, have some laughs, share some memories, move the party to a bar, and then go back home to their families. It also provoked me to think about my own reunion coming up in a few years and who will be there.

There isn't much original in this and, unfortunately, it's full of a lot of clich&eacute;d characters. Even less believable, however, was the fact that this was only a ten year reunion and that this must've been a well-to-do high school and these must've been some really go-getter graduates. My ten year reunion was a very informal affair at a bar with about twenty of my former classmates, none of whom were mortgage brokers, stock market traders, or pop stars, nor possessing of the kind of money to fly in from all over the globe to attend a grandiose ten year reunion on the scale of an expensive wedding reception.The gangs all here yet nothing really interesting takes place.  10 Years is neither very funny nor very insightful. It's simply a bunch of near-30 year olds trying to reclaim their high school glory years and touching upon every reunion clich&eacute; you can imagine (the hidden secrets, the former lovers, the humbled most popular person, the drunken bully, the black playa, the Asian geek, the wallflower no one remembers, the Professor and Mary Ann).  There is a cast of well-to-moderately-well-known actors, but none stand out. Anthony Mackie, who did such a great job in The Adjustment Bureau, is wasted in a ridiculously tired role and Lynn Collins tries her best as the humbled hot girl, but is again let down by weak writing. I've not seen much with Channing Tatum, the star with the most screen time, but I'm not impressed with his skills as demonstrated in this tepid movie.Anytime a plot is re-treaded for the umpteenth time, one hopes that the writer/director (in this case, Jamie Linden) adds a twist or two to make it their own. 10 Years does not do that, and we're given little more than a movie that would seem targeted solely for those whose high school experiences were similarly stereotypical and unrealistic as those who attended this reunion.

What resonates most about ""10 Years"" is its authentic feel.  The characters bicker over trivial matters, they have mixed feelings about confronting their youth and people from that period, and most appear settled into their lives rather than searching aimlessly for direction.  They are older than the characters in the John Hughes' flicks of the 1980's, yet the overall film will remind you of Hughes' work.Channing Tatum, who seems to be everywhere these days, plays the guy voted most popular in high school.  Rosario Dawson plays his high school girlfriend.  The quiet guy in high school -- the one hardly anyone really noticed -- returns as a rock star with a current hit song.  Kate Mara is the former outcast.  And Lynn Collins is the party girl pursued by high school nerds-on-the-make Justin Long and Max Minghella.The movie, like an actual reunion, has a meandering quality as we observe bits and pieces of the characters' stories and catch up with their lives, just as their former classmates do.  This episodic approach has its pluses and minuses.  It enables us to learn a bit about quite a few folks, but it fails to delve any deeper than the surface to reveal what makes them tick.""10 Years"" is pleasant enough, though far from a must-see.  If you like the actors, that's reason enough to watch.  Tatum gets better with every movie and Justin Long is especially good as once-a-nerd, always-a-nerd Marty.

1590189,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B009AJB0YM,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 1]","There were several terrible things aboutAmerican Reunion (Unrated)including the fact that it brought out several bad actors who once got by on their looks out of semi-retirement to parade their wooden acting behind weirdly shaped faces. The narrative had to explain why most of the actors weren't in the third movie (and by implication pointed out why the third movie was better than the second - the three decent young actors in the series stayed. Everyone else disappeared for that one). But one of the worst and strangest parts of the movie was the way that the narrative repeatedly tried to make the audience feel nostalgia for the better than average teen sex comedy that spawned the series.Oddly enough, this movie actually delivers on that nostalgia. With dozens of actors and small story lines, the movie does great work with what little it has. Every little story line has a pay off and while that's slightly cliched, there is a decent element of friends coming together and trying to make sense of their lives. Both the narrative and the acting eschews the easy tropes where these kind of things can go. Particularly fun is Chris Pratt of Parks & Recreation playing a variation on the loveable doofus that has served him so well. In this case, he's the football player that is trying REALLY hard to apologize to the guys he mocked throughout high school. The non-commitment of the people that he's apologizing to is almost heart breaking.While many of these stories have been done before, the movie still makes them feel fresh and for that alone, it's worth a recommendation.

I'd been watching a lot of older movies and thought I'd like a change and looked at this as just that. I was really surprised at how much I liked it. This movie is a well-made and well written look at a group of friends, acquaintances and victims and victimizers from High School at their 10 year reunion and the rest of the day, before and after.While some of the characters are archetypes and others are masses of cliche's, the movie is so well written and acted that even those characters are not off-putting. Even the ex-bully who spends most of the movie drinking and trying to get all of his ex-victims to accept his non-stop apologies is both more pathetic and sympathetic than he has any right to be. His long-suffering wife makes him more than the cringe-inducing, clod he might otherwise seem. He only made me feel uncomfortable once or twice, which is not really much for such a possible movie sabateur.The most interesting characters are the couple of ex-high school sweethearts who haven't seen each other in years and the ""Rock Star"" and his unknowing inspiration. Both of these couples are at the heart of what makes this such a good movie. The two ex-sweethearts both make peace with the disappointments of their past with each other that help them realize how much their current partners are the best things in their lives.The ""Rock Star"" lets the girl he secretly had a crush on know that she was the secret to his success to a certain extent and that they are closer in ways than either of them realize.I won't give it all away, but know that anyone who has ever wondered what ever happened to that girl they had an unrequited crush on, or that boy who went to the prom without them will find the situations in this movie familiar, funny, fun and an entertaining way to spend some time in front of your TV without feeling guilty or taken advantage of.

1590192,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B009AJB0YM,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[0, 0]","There are movies that portray a slice of life. Movies that show us a certain part of one's lifetime. Such a film is director/writer Jaime Linden's ""10 Years"". It is a film built on one evening, one high school reunion that brings about the details of the who we were, where our journey brought us, and who we are now. Sometimes, people change, and sometimes situations change, but then sometimes, there are those who don't change.The film begins with Jake and his girlfriend, Jess (Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan-Tatum) arriving at a friend's house, married couple Cully and Sam (Chris Pratt and Ari Graynor). There, the two are joined by more friends in high school, Marty and AJ (Justin Long and Max Minghella), a now semi-famous musician, Reeves (Oscar Isaac) and Scott and his wife, Suki (Scott Porter and Eiko Nijo). The group drives to the venue of their high school reunion, where they meet up with old acquaintances such as high school shy girl, Elise (Kate Mara), the most popular girl in high school, Anna (Lynn Collins), the event organizer, Julie (Kelly Noonan), Jake's old flame, Mary (Rosario Dawson) and close buds Andre (Anthony Mackie) and Garrity (Brian Geraghty) with his wife (Aubrey Plaza). Things really pick up even more after the gang goes to an old hang out. Some things never do change while some things are worth looking back to, only to move forward.I do have to admit that the film has a ridiculously amount of characters. It would be easy to say that it was an effort to keep track of everything that was going on. But the screenplay knew exactly where to go, it manages to keep things close to the ground, and with the direction, it manages to emulate the actual feeling of what goes on in a gathering. Linden's careful hand in the direction avoids paying too much attention to certain key characters, albeit there are those that just stood up, and manages to keep the film's flow natural and easy to follow.It is all about reunions and the script keeps it focus on its premise. It is all about knowing what was before, appreciating what was, and trying to move on or maybe build on what was before. ""10 Years"" is a film that moves around with more subplots than what an actual core point. I found the way the script moved around its less than compelling areas to be amusing and sometimes, odd (in the case of Cully and Garrity). They were simple things that made an impact in the narrative and yet, not so much as to draw the fire away from the film's main premise of moving on. Some areas felt like `fillers' while some certainly carried more punch than the other stories.I do have to say that I found myself more immersed into the Elise-Reeves dynamic than I expected. The chemistry between Isaac and Mara just almost stole the show. It was touching, uplifting and sometimes heart-breaking. It is about getting `smart' and about trying to catch up. The Anna-AJ-Marty dynamic felt more like a filler in the beginning, but it became one of the film's best points in the screenplay. The Dawson-Tatum connection had a lot of heart, and the two were good in their roles, their last scene together also became one of the film's best highlights.""10 Years"" is a piece of life. It may appear to be non-essential at first look, but it does have a good message to bring its viewers. Yes, it is built on formula, characters that we've all seen before, but really, what part of high school reunion isn't? The film manages to charm because of its sincerity.  It is the kind of movie that definitely had its good intentions. While I cannot say that it is essential to one's collection, it is worth a watch, at least once.

I think with the rise of technology and Facebook it sort of ruins the whole surprise of how people have changed in the last ten years. Who still keeps in touch. Who got married. Whos life didn't turn out the way everyone thought it would. Okay I admit, I would LIKE to go, but I moved across the country so... you know!10 Years provided a lot of realism when it came to seeing everyone again after ten years and though it was filled with most stereotypes and such it was still relate-able. And come on, you gotta admit it's nice to see Channing and his wife Jenna in a movie together again right?! Cliche but I still enjoyed it!
