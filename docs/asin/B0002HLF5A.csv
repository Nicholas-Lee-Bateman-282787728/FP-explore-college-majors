It's a delightful comedy full of mistaken identities and clever cover stories.  Filled with compelling characters as well as quite a few laughs, this is a sure bet for family movie night.  Although the acting is sometimes quite horrible, in my opinion it only adds to the appeal.  This is a B movie that earns an A+!",5,Sweet corn,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,380,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'full', 'mistaken', 'identities', 'clever', 'cover', 'stories', 'Filled', 'compelling', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'few', 'laughs', 'sure', 'bet', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'acting', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'horrible', 'opinion', 'only', 'appeal', 'B', 'movie', 'A+']",N/A
