828933,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00029RT9E,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","Twisted starts well but gets looser when it should get tighter and increasingly improbable just when plot twists should have us wondering how we could have missed the clues.  Instead we wonder, did the writer of this screenplay paint himself into a corner so tight that he had to have workers saw off the top of his house and lower a rope to extricate him from his predicament?  In this regard Twisted is like No Way Out in which Kevin Costner was out-acted by his uniform.  Costner, if you recall, is pulled deeper and deeper into espionage and intrigue.  It's quite good, despite Costner's involvement, until the very end.  The reveal, the explanation behind every devious turn we've seen up until that point, is virtually impossible - it has the statistical likelihood of discovering an honest lawyer.The premise, and cast, of Twisted are first rate.  Ashley Judd is the protagonist.  As newly promoted Detective Jessica Shepard she combines two-fisted machismo - fetching in her black wife-beater t-shirt - and lonely vulnerability - haunted, alcoholic, and alone.  But hey, no wonder she's alone, the apes she drags home for demeaning one night stands have a habit of ending up dead, and before long she's the prime suspect in her own murder investigation.  How awkward!  Quite the pickle for the new girl on the squad, no wonder her colleagues are so tough on her.  But wait, she has a secret.  Her dad, who was also a cop, developed cheese-slipped-off-cracker syndrome and went on a killing spree before doing himself in.  She pores over newspaper clippings, or pours over them, and drinks herself into blackouts.  Is it possible she's killing her lovers during blackouts and forgetting it?  Is it possible she's inherited her father's cursed genes?It's an interesting set-up, and better movies have been made out of less.  Judd does a very good job, especially considering the improbability of the situation.  Andy Garcia, another talent, is convincing as her partner - he's understandably concerned - for her and himself.  David Strathairn, a terrific actor, doesn't get to help Jessica, or the movie, much.  As her psychiatrist he does get to mention that she might want to cut back on her drinking a bit - $160 an hour for that scary insight?!  But the loose canon in this movie is John Mills, played by Samuel Jackson.  Mills took over in loco parentis when Jessica's dad died, with emphasis on the loco.  As mastermind super cop he groomed the young Jessica.  It shows; she is the grasshopper who now outperforms the big guys and is ready to leave the temple.  But there is something about Mills that is oddly detached; he is both Jessica's staunchest defender and toughest critic.  Don't fear, all is revealed in the third act.Spoiler?  I hardly know her!  Let's just say that the denouement of this movie is so glib, facile, lazy, and unlikely that it would have been more believable if Kevin Costner and Sean Young had wandered onto the set wearing their No Way Outfits and confessed to the crimes themselves.",2,Plot Twisted,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,3025,"['Twisted', 'starts', 'well', 'looser', 'when', 'should', 'get', 'tighter', 'increasingly', 'improbable', 'just', 'when', 'plot', 'twists', 'should', 'have', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'missed', 'clues', 'Instead', 'wonder', 'did', 'writer', 'screenplay', 'paint', 'corner', 'so', 'tight', 'had', 'have', 'workers', 'saw', 'off', 'top', 'house', 'lower', 'rope', 'extricate', 'predicament', 'regard', 'Twisted', 'Way', 'Out', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'was', 'out-acted', 'uniform', 'Costner', 'recall', 'pulled', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'espionage', 'intrigue', 'quite', 'good', 'Costner', 'involvement', 'very', 'end', 'reveal', 'explanation', 'devious', 'turn', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'up', 'point', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'statistical', 'likelihood', 'discovering', 'honest', 'lawyer.The', 'premise', 'cast', 'Twisted', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'protagonist', 'newly', 'promoted', 'Detective', 'Jessica', 'Shepard', 'two-fisted', 'machismo', 'fetching', 'black', 'wife-beater', 't-shirt', 'lonely', 'vulnerability', 'haunted', 'alcoholic', 'alone', 'hey', 'wonder', 'alone', 'apes', 'home', 'demeaning', 'one', 'night', 'stands', 'have', 'habit', 'ending', 'up', 'dead', 'long', 'prime', 'suspect', 'own', 'murder', 'investigation', 'How', 'awkward', 'pickle', 'new', 'girl', 'squad', 'wonder', 'colleagues', 'are', 'so', 'tough', 'wait', 'secret', 'dad', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'cop', 'developed', 'cheese-slipped-off-cracker', 'syndrome', 'went', 'killing', 'spree', 'doing', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'pours', 'blackouts', 'possible', 'killing', 'lovers', 'blackouts', 'forgetting', 'possible', 'inherited', 'father', 'cursed', 'genes', 'interesting', 'set-up', 'better', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'less', 'Judd', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'considering', 'improbability', 'situation', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'talent', 'convincing', 'partner', 'understandably', 'concerned', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'terrific', 'actor', ""n't"", 'get', 'help', 'Jessica', 'movie', 'much', 'psychiatrist', 'get', 'mention', 'might', 'want', 'cut', 'back', 'drinking', 'bit', '160', 'hour', 'scary', 'insight', 'loose', 'canon', 'movie', 'John', 'Mills', 'played', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'Mills', 'took', 'over', 'loco', 'parentis', 'when', 'Jessica', 'dad', 'died', 'emphasis', 'loco', 'mastermind', 'super', 'cop', 'groomed', 'young', 'Jessica', 'grasshopper', 'who', 'now', 'big', 'guys', 'ready', 'leave', 'temple', 'something', 'Mills', 'oddly', 'detached', 'Jessica', 'staunchest', 'defender', 'toughest', 'critic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fear', 'revealed', 'third', 'act.Spoiler', 'hardly', 'know', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'denouement', 'movie', 'so', 'glib', 'facile', 'lazy', 'unlikely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Sean', 'Young', 'had', 'wandered', 'set', 'wearing', 'Way', 'Outfits', 'confessed', 'crimes']",Twisted

(In Taking Lives you've got a predictable plot and ending, horrid acting, a stupid story...)  Why couldn't I guess where this was going, but I could figure out every other movie I've ever seen in the first five minutes?  I don't know.  Perhaps this one is too off the wall, or perhaps because it's actually very predictable... but in too many ways simultaneously.  Perhaps it has TOO MANY cliches, too many possible obvious developments, too many paths... so many that you aren't sure which path the writers will take... and then that path appears to have several possible branches, etc.  It really kept me guessing the whole way through.  Perhaps you'd rather just passively watch a movie... or perhaps like me you're tempted to figure it out early.

828936,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00029RT9E,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[3, 5]","Highly respected director Philip Kaufman set out in `Twisted' to make a film noir thriller from an original script starring thriller victim specialist Ashley Judd with support in characteristic roles from Samuel L. Jackson and Andy Garcia. By definition, the success of a thriller is it's ability to thrill, so much of one's evaluation should be based on your visceral reaction to the movie. And, this movie did not have my viscera sending me very many messages about gut-wrenching excitement from my TV screen.Unlike two other thrillers I recently reviewed, `Out of Time' and `Taken Lives' where the mystery may not have been as well hidden as the writers hoped, there was still a lion's share of stomach wrenching excitement and anxiety being created by the plight of the lead characters in these two movies. Denzel Washington in `Out of Time' is conned into a very believable pickle and the anxiety you feel for his race to stay one step ahead of his cop colleagues is palpable. Angelina Jolie in `Taken Lives' is a highly skilled, yet highly fragile and vulnerable serial killer profiler who makes an almost fatal mistake in identifying the perp and the real perp almost does her in.All three movies are about cops in bad situations, partly of their own making. The problem with `Twisted' is that not only is the surprise ending no big surprise, the plot's red herring which wants us to believe that the Ashley Judd character, a new San Francisco homicide inspector is killing off her lovers is simply not very believable. The problem, I believe is not with Judd or Director Kaufman, it seems to be in the very script of which Kaufman and associates were so enamoured. The device of having Judd's character black out so obviously after drinking some wine at home before each murder, after having spend time in a local bar drinking more than a few shots of Jack Daniels just does not give a plausible scenario for a person to sleepwalk their way through committing a violent murder of a young, strong grown man with an 0.15% alcohol level in their blood.The bright side of the movie is that Judd pulls off her characterization of a very tough, very smart young detective with an inclination to violence against perps and meaningless one night stands with pickups at bars away from those patronized by her police colleagues. The lesser police characters are also done very well and the police psychologist played by David Straithairn is done well, even though the attempts at offering him up as a potential perp are weak and underplayed. The minor role of forensic scientist is a minor homage to the rash of CSI shows which includes a clever little reference to a reservation at `Chez Panisse', the most famous Berkeley restaurant. Unfortunately, she has a piece of business at the end of her last appearance that opens an important question that is never answered by the story.Jackson and Garcia carry out their roles with their usual skill, but I think they cannot transcend the implausibility of the plot. One is being set up as the real perp, the other is the real perp, but neither case is laid out with conviction by the story. The surprise doesn't surprise because it is not plausible.I am really having a hard time deciding if the movie works as film noir. San Francisco fogs and waterfront scenes are as good or better than New York canyons, but fog and darkness does not make noir. `Chinatown' was filmed in bright LA sunlight and is as great a film noir classic as they come. There almost seemed to be more in common with `Dirty Harry' going on here than echos of Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade.To end on a positive note, the DVD contains a full length commentary on the movie by director Kaufman, which is always my favorite special feature, as it literally doubles the entertainment value of the product. Other special features are pretty standard stuff.With commentary, this is good for an entertaining evening. Not as much thrill or suspense as other recent flicks.",3,A workmanlike thriller with little visceral punch.,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,3979,"['Highly', 'respected', 'director', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'set', 'out', 'Twisted', 'make', 'film', 'noir', 'thriller', 'original', 'script', 'starring', 'thriller', 'victim', 'specialist', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'support', 'characteristic', 'roles', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'definition', 'success', 'thriller', 'ability', 'thrill', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'evaluation', 'should', 'be', 'based', 'visceral', 'reaction', 'movie', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'viscera', 'sending', 'very', 'many', 'messages', 'gut-wrenching', 'excitement', 'TV', 'screen.Unlike', 'two', 'other', 'thrillers', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'Time', 'Taken', 'where', 'mystery', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'well', 'hidden', 'writers', 'hoped', 'was', 'still', 'lion', 'share', 'stomach', 'wrenching', 'excitement', 'anxiety', 'being', 'created', 'plight', 'lead', 'characters', 'two', 'movies', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Time', 'conned', 'very', 'believable', 'pickle', 'anxiety', 'feel', 'race', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'cop', 'colleagues', 'palpable', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Taken', 'Lives', 'highly', 'skilled', 'yet', 'highly', 'fragile', 'vulnerable', 'serial', 'killer', 'profiler', 'who', 'almost', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'identifying', 'perp', 'real', 'perp', 'almost', 'in.All', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'cops', 'bad', 'situations', 'partly', 'own', 'making', 'problem', 'Twisted', 'not', 'only', 'surprise', 'ending', 'big', 'surprise', 'plot', 'red', 'herring', 'believe', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'character', 'new', 'San', 'Francisco', 'homicide', 'inspector', 'killing', 'off', 'lovers', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'problem', 'believe', 'not', 'Judd', 'Director', 'Kaufman', 'be', 'very', 'script', 'Kaufman', 'associates', 'were', 'so', 'enamoured', 'device', 'having', 'Judd', 'character', 'black', 'so', 'obviously', 'drinking', 'wine', 'home', 'murder', 'having', 'spend', 'time', 'local', 'bar', 'drinking', 'more', 'few', 'shots', 'Jack', 'Daniels', 'just', 'not', 'give', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'person', 'sleepwalk', 'way', 'committing', 'violent', 'murder', 'young', 'strong', 'grown', 'man', '0.15', '%', 'alcohol', 'level', 'blood.The', 'bright', 'side', 'movie', 'Judd', 'characterization', 'very', 'tough', 'very', 'smart', 'young', 'detective', 'inclination', 'violence', 'perps', 'meaningless', 'one', 'night', 'pickups', 'bars', 'away', 'patronized', 'police', 'colleagues', 'lesser', 'police', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'police', 'psychologist', 'played', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'done', 'well', 'even', 'attempts', 'offering', 'up', 'potential', 'perp', 'are', 'weak', 'underplayed', 'minor', 'role', 'forensic', 'scientist', 'minor', 'homage', 'rash', 'CSI', 'shows', 'clever', 'little', 'reference', 'reservation', 'Chez', 'Panisse', 'most', 'famous', 'Berkeley', 'restaurant', 'Unfortunately', 'piece', 'business', 'end', 'last', 'appearance', 'important', 'question', 'never', 'answered', 'story.Jackson', 'Garcia', 'carry', 'out', 'roles', 'usual', 'skill', 'think', 'can', 'not', 'transcend', 'implausibility', 'plot', 'One', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'real', 'perp', 'other', 'real', 'perp', 'case', 'laid', 'out', 'conviction', 'story', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'not', 'plausible.I', 'am', 'really', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'deciding', 'movie', 'film', 'noir', 'San', 'Francisco', 'fogs', 'waterfront', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'New', 'York', 'canyons', 'fog', 'darkness', 'not', 'make', 'noir', 'Chinatown', 'was', 'filmed', 'bright', 'LA', 'sunlight', 'as', 'great', 'film', 'noir', 'classic', 'come', 'almost', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'common', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'going', 'here', 'echos', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'Sam', 'Spade.To', 'end', 'positive', 'note', 'DVD', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'movie', 'director', 'Kaufman', 'always', 'favorite', 'special', 'feature', 'literally', 'entertainment', 'value', 'product', 'Other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stuff.With', 'commentary', 'good', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'Not', 'much', 'thrill', 'suspense', 'other', 'recent', 'flicks']",Twisted

(-A sure contender for the title role in ""The Christopher Lee Story"", if they ever make it.) Though the pacing is good the film is a bit on the boring side with no real action scenes, only off-screen killings, all after-the-fact stuff. I still liked it better than other Judd thrillers of late, such as ""Kiss The Girls"" and ""Eye Of The Beholder"". Some odd elements remain unanswered though, like, why Judd's character has an elderly Asian female peeping Tom for a neighbour. Veronica (""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"") Cartwright appears unbilled as a landlady, but blink and you'll miss her. Not a bad film but unfinished somehow, and the (predictable) ending is badly executed.

Another possible title is ""It's All About the Groceries"", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  ""Kiss the Girls"" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.

SOUTH,"[44, 52]","Although I wasn't too impressed with the ""Twisted"" previews, when I saw that Philip Kaufman directed it, I fairly flew into the theater on opening day.  Is this the same Philip Kaufman who directed excellent masterpieces like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", and ""The Right Stuff""?  If it is, I fear he's been replaced by a pod person.  And what did high-grade stars like Ashley Judd, Andy Garcia, and Samuel L. Jackson think when they read this poorly thought-out script?The story, about a newly-promoted homicide cop (Judd) who has peculiar sexual habits and then discovers that, one-by-one, her gentlemen partners are getting beaten to death, does have potential, and one can imagine what someone like Hitchcock could have done with it.  But the screenplay and direction are so cliche-ridden and unbelievable, it was truly hard to not laugh all the way through it.  There was a moment, when I considered that maybe it was supposed to be a spoof.Humorous moments include Judd's Jessica character repeatedly getting polluted, passing out, and then jumping off the sofa to run immediately to the scene of a crime, without so much as brushing her teeth, but all the while looking like her usual knock-out, gorgeous self. When Jessica comes clean to her superior (Jackson) about her realtionship with the victims, does he think that maybe he should at least TRY to take her off the case, especially since all the bodies are ""signed"" with a cigarette burn, and Jessica constantly keeps a unlit cigarette with her that she never smokes but taps furiously on tables?  Then there's the repeated shots of Jessica's elderly, Oriental neighbor gawking at her through the window, that's thrown into the movie only to go nowhere.Oh, yes, there is also the rest of the San Francisco police department, played by a cast of ""actors"" who must surely have gotten their parts because they're related to one or more of the producers.  Their portrayals of police officers are the most politically incorrect and boorish charicatures you're likely ever to see on the screen.  One of the guys, who gives Judd a particularly hard time all through the film, does a turn-around at the end that only a dime-store trash novelist could dream up.  The climax and resolution is a fiesta of incredulous humor.I did give the movie two stars: One for Ashley, because she does try her best and looks great; and another star for the beautiful ""City by the Bay"" scenery.",2,"Shame on you, Philip Kaufman!!!",1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,2472,"['was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'Twisted', 'previews', 'when', 'saw', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'directed', 'fairly', 'flew', 'theater', 'opening', 'day', 'same', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'directed', 'excellent', 'masterpieces', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'fear', 'been', 'replaced', 'pod', 'person', 'what', 'did', 'high-grade', 'stars', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'think', 'when', 'read', 'poorly', 'thought-out', 'script', 'story', 'newly-promoted', 'homicide', 'cop', 'Judd', 'who', 'peculiar', 'sexual', 'habits', 'then', 'discovers', 'one-by-one', 'gentlemen', 'partners', 'are', 'getting', 'beaten', 'death', 'have', 'potential', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'what', 'someone', 'Hitchcock', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'are', 'so', 'cliche-ridden', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'truly', 'hard', 'not', 'way', 'was', 'moment', 'when', 'considered', 'maybe', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'spoof.Humorous', 'moments', 'include', 'Judd', 'Jessica', 'character', 'repeatedly', 'getting', 'polluted', 'passing', 'out', 'then', 'jumping', 'off', 'sofa', 'run', 'immediately', 'scene', 'crime', 'so', 'much', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'looking', 'usual', 'knock-out', 'gorgeous', 'self', 'When', 'Jessica', 'clean', 'superior', 'Jackson', 'realtionship', 'victims', 'think', 'maybe', 'should', 'least', 'TRY', 'take', 'off', 'case', 'especially', 'bodies', 'are', 'signed', 'cigarette', 'burn', 'Jessica', 'constantly', 'unlit', 'cigarette', 'never', 'smokes', 'furiously', 'tables', 'Then', 'repeated', 'shots', 'Jessica', 'elderly', 'Oriental', 'neighbor', 'gawking', 'window', 'thrown', 'movie', 'only', 'go', 'nowhere.Oh', 'yes', 'also', 'rest', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'department', 'played', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'must', 'surely', 'have', 'gotten', 'parts', ""'re"", 'related', 'one', 'more', 'producers', 'portrayals', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'most', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'boorish', 'charicatures', ""'re"", 'likely', 'ever', 'see', 'screen', 'One', 'guys', 'who', 'Judd', 'particularly', 'hard', 'time', 'film', 'turn-around', 'end', 'only', 'dime-store', 'trash', 'novelist', 'could', 'dream', 'up', 'climax', 'resolution', 'fiesta', 'incredulous', 'humor.I', 'did', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'One', 'Ashley', 'try', 'best', 'great', 'star', 'beautiful', 'City', 'Bay', 'scenery']",Twisted

Bernabo,"[9, 9]","Our plan was to go see &quot;Monster&quot; this afternoon but we live in the sort of place where a movie like that gets shown only at night so that they can run some kid friendly movie during the day (we have a limited number of screens up here in the Zenith City).  So we decided to go see &quot;Twisted&quot; instead because I happened to catch Samuel L. Jackson on the CBS morning show last Friday.  Jackson, who found out that he is the best selling movie actor on DVDs, said he did the script because he never saw the ending coming.  If that is true, then either they did some major changes in Sarah Thorp's script by the time the film was finished or Jackson has been making too many movies and needs a break because everybody saw this one coming.&quot;Twisted&quot; is set in San Francisco, where Jessica Shepard (Ashley Judd) has just caught a big time bad guy, been promoted to inspected, and assigned to the homicide department. She also has made a habit of picking up strange guys in bars, going to their apartments for some rough sex, and then going home and drinking wine until she passes out.  It turns out that when she was a kid her father, who was also a cop, went on a killing spree before killing her mother and then shot himself.  Jessica was raised by her dad's partner, John Mills (Jackson), who is now the police commissioner.  At her new job she has a new partner, Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), and on their first case they find a body that has been savagely beaten and washed up from the Bay.  It happens to be one of her one-night stands.  Then another body pops up, with the same tell tale brand, and it turns out she slept with this guy too.The rule with a film like this is that to play fair the murderer has to be above the title in the credits, which means we have only three suspects.  We do not see the murders so we know that it cannot be somebody we have not seen and there is only one other remote possibility in the rest of the cast.  But then I am afraid that based on the description of the film in the previous paragraph I probably gave you enough information to figure out who the identity of the killer.  If I have indeed done so I think that rather than apologizing you should thank me, because going to see an Oscar nominated film that you have already seen would be more worthwhile than spending time and money on this one.  Wait for it to come out on DVD so that you do not feel like you have been taken for such a ride.Because she took one free shot against a psycho that was trying to kill her, Shepard has to go see a department shrink (David Strathairn), who attends his sessions wearing a gun.  Of course he wants to deal with the fact that she tells everybody her parents were killed in a car accident instead of rehashing the horrible truth and she feels no pressing need to talk about the fact she keeps passing out at night and wakes up the next morning to learn about another dead body being checked off the list of her former lovers.  But then the S.F.P.D. as a whole is not too bright: when the third victim pops up with the same connection they have Shepard's partner interview her for 5 minutes.  Either (a) she is the killer or (b) the killer is someone she knows or who know here.  Either way, a detailed examination of her life and habits would be in order.For writing the cops as being stupid &quot;Twisted&quot; loses an additional star to go along with the two it loses for being so easy to figure out.  The second sin is the greater offense, especially with &quot;Twisted&quot; coming at a time where so many films have been successfully playing mind games with characters and audiences.  When you think of films like &quot;Fight Club,&quot; &quot;Memento,&quot; &quot;The Matchstick Men,&quot; and other films of that type, even if they did not succeed in completely fooling you at least they were ambitious in the attempt.  With &quot;Twisted&quot; I could not even find any good reasons not to think that it was who it obviously was, especially when the clue is just overacting..I know this is the highest rating anybody has given this review to date, but I have a long- standing policy of saving one stars for reviews of snuff films.",2,Sorry but this movie is not twisted enough to actually work,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,4203,"['plan', 'was', 'go', 'see', 'quot', 'Monster', 'quot', 'afternoon', 'live', 'sort', 'place', 'where', 'movie', 'shown', 'only', 'night', 'so', 'can', 'run', 'kid', 'friendly', 'movie', 'day', 'have', 'limited', 'number', 'screens', 'up', 'here', 'Zenith', 'City', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'quot', 'Twisted', 'quot', 'instead', 'happened', 'catch', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'CBS', 'morning', 'show', 'last', 'Friday', 'Jackson', 'who', 'found', 'out', 'best', 'selling', 'movie', 'actor', 'DVDs', 'said', 'did', 'script', 'never', 'saw', 'ending', 'coming', 'true', 'then', 'did', 'major', 'changes', 'Sarah', 'Thorp', 'script', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'finished', 'Jackson', 'been', 'making', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'break', 'everybody', 'saw', 'one', 'coming.', 'quot', 'Twisted', 'quot', 'set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'Jessica', 'Shepard', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'just', 'caught', 'big', 'time', 'bad', 'guy', 'been', 'promoted', 'inspected', 'assigned', 'homicide', 'department', 'also', 'made', 'habit', 'picking', 'up', 'strange', 'guys', 'bars', 'going', 'apartments', 'rough', 'sex', 'then', 'going', 'home', 'drinking', 'wine', 'out', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'cop', 'went', 'killing', 'spree', 'killing', 'mother', 'then', 'shot', 'Jessica', 'was', 'raised', 'dad', 'partner', 'John', 'Mills', 'Jackson', 'who', 'now', 'police', 'commissioner', 'new', 'job', 'new', 'partner', 'Mike', 'Delmarco', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'first', 'case', 'find', 'body', 'been', 'savagely', 'beaten', 'washed', 'up', 'Bay', 'be', 'one', 'one-night', 'stands', 'Then', 'body', 'up', 'same', 'tell', 'tale', 'brand', 'out', 'slept', 'guy', 'too.The', 'rule', 'film', 'play', 'murderer', 'be', 'title', 'credits', 'have', 'only', 'three', 'suspects', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'murders', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'somebody', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'remote', 'possibility', 'rest', 'cast', 'then', 'am', 'afraid', 'based', 'description', 'film', 'previous', 'paragraph', 'probably', 'gave', 'enough', 'information', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'identity', 'killer', 'have', 'indeed', 'done', 'so', 'think', 'rather', 'apologizing', 'should', 'thank', 'going', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'film', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'spending', 'time', 'money', 'one', 'Wait', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'such', 'ride.Because', 'took', 'one', 'free', 'shot', 'psycho', 'was', 'trying', 'kill', 'Shepard', 'go', 'see', 'department', 'shrink', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'who', 'sessions', 'wearing', 'gun', 'course', 'deal', 'fact', 'everybody', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'instead', 'rehashing', 'horrible', 'truth', 'pressing', 'need', 'talk', 'fact', 'passing', 'out', 'night', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'learn', 'dead', 'body', 'being', 'checked', 'off', 'list', 'former', 'lovers', 'then', 'S.F.P.D', 'whole', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'when', 'third', 'victim', 'up', 'same', 'connection', 'have', 'Shepard', 'partner', 'interview', '5', 'minutes', 'Either', 'killer', 'b', 'killer', 'someone', 'who', 'know', 'here', 'way', 'detailed', 'examination', 'life', 'habits', 'would', 'be', 'order.For', 'writing', 'cops', 'being', 'stupid', 'quot', 'Twisted', 'quot', 'additional', 'star', 'go', 'along', 'two', 'being', 'so', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'second', 'sin', 'greater', 'offense', 'especially', 'quot', 'Twisted', 'quot', 'coming', 'time', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'successfully', 'playing', 'mind', 'games', 'characters', 'audiences', 'When', 'think', 'films', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'other', 'films', 'type', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'completely', 'fooling', 'least', 'were', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'quot', 'Twisted', 'quot', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'find', 'good', 'reasons', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'who', 'obviously', 'was', 'especially', 'when', 'clue', 'just', 'overacting..I', 'know', 'highest', 'rating', 'anybody', 'given', 'review', 'date', 'have', 'long-', 'standing', 'policy', 'saving', 'one', 'stars', 'reviews', 'snuff', 'films']",Twisted

I think the reason that this movie gets so violently trashed is that Ashley Judd plays a cop who sleeps around a lot.  Cops are supposed to be respected more than that.  I suspect that is the whole reason that people slam the movie so hard.  They don't want to accept a character like that, a female cop who is promiscuous.  They find it offensive.The problem with that is that there is no profession better known for promiscuity than police.  Possible exception - flight attendants.  Police and flight attendants.  So what we have here is a double standard.  It's ok for a male cop to be promiscuous, and they have a reputation for it, but it's not ok to say so, or to have a female cop who is promiscuous.  I think a large part of the population would fit right in with the Muslims of Afghanistan.The movie itself really isn't that great.  It was obvious from the start that one of Ashley's cop friends was the killer.  It was either her ex boyfriend, her new partner, or her mentor.  But as I said, it did hold my interest, and it isn't as bad as a lot of other movies out these days.  I don't mind at all that the female cop is promiscuous.  That's her problem, and I don't condemn her for it.  I really don't care.I found the Ashley Judd fight scenes to be unbelievable.  She's pretty tough in this movie but I know I could take her, and I'm not that good.  She was utterly unconvincing as Ms. Tough Guy.  The little moves they have her doing at the start of the film look like they will only work if the opponent stands there and waits for it to happen.If they wanted to give us a realistic fight scene, with Ashley defending herself against armed rape, they would have given us a much messier scene, not a choreographed little flip and a neat little turnaround.  It would have been a struggle and a mess, like reality.  But they weren't interested in making the scene real.  They were giving us Ms. Batman.

Perhaps there are males who would be interested in the idea of being picked up by Ashley Judd for a sexual fling, but in ""Twisted"" the sex portrayed is so lacking in love, passion and respect (or self-respect) that I pity the person turned on by this movie.The other characters are fleshed out in broad strokes and basically not a single person in this movie bears any relationship to anyone I know in real life.  It's not essential that ""real"" characters inhabit the movies I watch, but they should at least be interesting.

828975,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00029RT9E,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 6]","There are just two rules when you create a thriller with a pretty lead: 1) The lead (the delectable Ashley Judd) had better show some skin. 2) Thou shalt not be boring.Twisted utterly fails on both counts.  Basically, Judd is Jessica Shepard, a messed up cop who specializes in hunting serial killers.  She's fond of bedding men she meets at late night bars, because she's self-destructive.  Only Jessica looks fabulous all the time, even when she's been on a bender (which is apparently every night).  How she maintains her good looks without stinking up the place is just another part of cinema magic.Jessica is mentored by John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson).  For a second there I thought Jackson was going to play an understated version of his usual maniacal self.  I was wrong.Things take a turn for the strange after Jessica discovers that every man she sleeps with is murdered.  And she keeps having these weird blackouts every night.  The victims wash up on the shore the next day with a single cigarette burn on their hand.  Poor Jessica is haunted by her parents' murder/suicide and wonders...since her father went on a mass-murdering spree before he killed himself, could she too have the ""serial killer gene""?Jessica is paired with Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), an Italian goomba who is alternately creepy, lecherous, and like everyone else in this ridiculous movie, wants to get into her pants.  Mike follows her around an awful lot...could HE be the killer?  Or maybe it's the ex-boyfriend cop, Jimmy Schmidt (Mark Pellegrino).  Or maybe it's...actually, I figured it out in the first ten minutes.Being something of a true crime fan, and having read a bit on the subject, this entire premise is absurd. You don't wake up one day and become a serial killer; if anyone actually got a good look at the life of a serial killer, it screams DANGER from day one.  Pretty Jessica has none of those problems in her past, except for a vague ""suppressed rage"" that manifests itself in kinky sex and kicking people in the face.  Her cherubic face shows no signs of hardship, and neither does the rest of her. Although the script wants us to believe she's a haggard cop, the camera is only too happy to zoom in on her rear end.  Not once, but twice.  And it's not a naked rear end either.So we have a gorgeous female cop who sleeps around, yet there are very few bedroom scenes.  We have a serial killer plot that is connected by red herrings (Who is that lady across the street?  Why does Jessica fiddle with a cigarette but never light it?).  On one hand, the cops are strictly by the book; they make a big deal out of the fact that Jessica kicks a serial killer in the face.  On the other hand, nobody pulls Jessica off the case when she's a prime suspect, nor watch her home when the serial killer is obviously following her around.Neither sleazy or highbrow, gritty or moralistic, Twisted is so boring, it gets bored with itself.",2,"so boring, it gets bored with itself",1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2930,"['are', 'just', 'two', 'rules', 'when', 'create', 'thriller', 'pretty', 'lead', '1', 'lead', 'delectable', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'had', 'better', 'show', 'skin', '2', 'Thou', 'shalt', 'not', 'be', 'boring.Twisted', 'utterly', 'fails', 'counts', 'Basically', 'Judd', 'Jessica', 'Shepard', 'messed', 'up', 'cop', 'who', 'hunting', 'serial', 'killers', 'fond', 'bedding', 'men', 'late', 'night', 'bars', 'self-destructive', 'Only', 'Jessica', 'fabulous', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'been', 'bender', 'apparently', 'night', 'How', 'good', 'looks', 'stinking', 'up', 'place', 'just', 'part', 'cinema', 'magic.Jessica', 'mentored', 'John', 'Mills', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'second', 'thought', 'Jackson', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'understated', 'version', 'usual', 'maniacal', 'self', 'was', 'wrong.Things', 'take', 'turn', 'strange', 'Jessica', 'discovers', 'man', 'murdered', 'having', 'weird', 'blackouts', 'night', 'victims', 'wash', 'up', 'shore', 'next', 'day', 'single', 'cigarette', 'burn', 'hand', 'Poor', 'Jessica', 'haunted', 'parents', 'murder/suicide', 'wonders', 'father', 'went', 'mass-murdering', 'spree', 'killed', 'could', 'too', 'have', 'serial', 'killer', 'gene', 'Jessica', 'paired', 'Mike', 'Delmarco', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Italian', 'goomba', 'who', 'alternately', 'creepy', 'lecherous', 'everyone', 'else', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'get', 'pants', 'Mike', 'awful', 'lot', 'could', 'HE', 'be', 'killer', 'maybe', 'ex-boyfriend', 'cop', 'Jimmy', 'Schmidt', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'actually', 'figured', 'out', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes.Being', 'something', 'true', 'crime', 'fan', 'having', 'read', 'bit', 'subject', 'entire', 'premise', 'absurd', 'do', ""n't"", 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'serial', 'killer', 'anyone', 'actually', 'got', 'good', 'look', 'life', 'serial', 'killer', 'DANGER', 'day', 'one', 'Pretty', 'Jessica', 'none', 'problems', 'past', 'vague', 'suppressed', 'rage', 'kinky', 'sex', 'kicking', 'people', 'face', 'cherubic', 'face', 'signs', 'hardship', 'neither', 'rest', 'script', 'believe', 'haggard', 'cop', 'camera', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'zoom', 'rear', 'end', 'Not', 'once', 'twice', 'not', 'naked', 'rear', 'end', 'either.So', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'female', 'cop', 'who', 'around', 'yet', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'have', 'serial', 'killer', 'plot', 'connected', 'red', 'herrings', 'Who', 'lady', 'street', 'Why', 'Jessica', 'fiddle', 'cigarette', 'never', 'light', 'one', 'hand', 'cops', 'are', 'strictly', 'book', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'fact', 'Jessica', 'serial', 'killer', 'face', 'other', 'hand', 'nobody', 'pulls', 'Jessica', 'case', 'when', 'prime', 'suspect', 'watch', 'home', 'when', 'serial', 'killer', 'obviously', 'following', 'around.Neither', 'sleazy', 'highbrow', 'gritty', 'moralistic', 'Twisted', 'so', 'boring', 'bored']",Twisted

Ashley's character is a homicide detective.  His father was a detective as well, partnered to Samuel Jackson's character but alas, he committed suicide.  Her mum was supposedly killed by her father, according to Samuel's character who is now chief to Ashley's character.  Anyhow, despite that Ashley's character is a great detective, she is a fallen angel, who has the propensity to be violent to his suspects & she torments herself by sleeping with men of violent temparement.  The movie got excited when all the men she slept with died a violent death.  It's the case of a serial killer who attempted to outwit the investigators.  Andy played Ashley's character's partner but as any Hollywood movies would have it, the suspicion would lead us to believe that he's the killer.  Hollywood has a tendency to think that audience is thick & that the twist is always predictable & somewhat daff.  In the end, the explanation given to the deaths of those characters & to tie them to the death of Ashley's character's parents is somehow vague & overly illogical.

828987,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00029RT9E,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Twisted (Philip Kaufman, 2004)In the past forty years, Philip Kaufman has directed just twelve films. One of the producers, in the DVD extras, mentions that the production company gets forty to fifty scripts a week. Why either of them decided that Sarah Thorp's (See Jane Run) script for Twisted stood out from the pack is utterly beyond me.Fifteen years ago, a movie was released called Sea of Love, starring Al Pacino as a detective investigating Ellen Barkin, a woman whose boyfriends all seem to end up dying. The big twist (well, okay, it's predictable, but you know) is that Pacino falls in love with Barkin, who is of course his main suspect, and thus his investigation takes on a whole new urgency, as suddenly he's a target. Sea of Love is a wonderful, underrated thriller that has faded into obscurity. It also, with a few minor changes, has the exact plot of Twisted. In this case, the investigating officer is Jessica Shepherd, played by Ashley Judd (and yes, I hear you thinking ""ho hum, Ashley Judd in another murder mystery-cum-thriller;"" it gets better, folks), and it's her boyfriends who keep turning up dead. The ruggedly handsome cop who falls in love with her is her partner, Mike DelMarco (Andy Garcia, previously the main thing that was brilliant about any movie he starred in; now, he's done Ocean's Eleven, this, AND Ocean's Twelve in the space of two years. Poor guy). And DelMarco here is either the killer or another victim possibility. You know he's got to be one or the other; he's not coming out of this unscathed. And that is one of the movie's biggest problems-- there's no suspense about whether something will happen to any of the characters, only what will happen. Not even when; there are not only characters who walk around with ""kill me"" written on their foreheads, but like the title character in Donnie Darko, they all have the times written on their arms as well.The other main problem with the movie was the casting of Ashley Judd. This isn't the usual ""Ashley in peril"" flick you've seen a bunch of times (and in this one, the Wise Old Black Man is Sam Jackson, not Morgan Freeman); Jessica is a complex character, strong, aggressive, alcoholic, with huge amounts of rage bubbling just underneath the surface, and to put it simply, the whole thing creates a psychotic. Think Al Pacino (again!) in Cruising. There's only one problem. Ashley Judd is not Al Pacino. Which is good in some scenes (no one ever wants to see that much of Al Pacino's flesh, at least not in 2004), but when it comes to plumbing the emotional depths of Jessica Shepherd, Ashley Judd simply doesn't have the chops. She comes off, many times, as being uncomfortable in her own skin. She just isn't crazy enough. (Putting her sister in, that might have worked.)Twisted is a watchable movie, but it could have been better had a better actrss taken the main character, and it could have been miles better had they not recycled an old plot hoping no one would remember. ** ",2,"Sea of Love revisited... and not well, either",1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,2985,"['Twisted', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', '2004', 'past', 'forty', 'years', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'directed', 'just', 'twelve', 'films', 'One', 'producers', 'DVD', 'extras', 'mentions', 'production', 'company', 'forty', 'fifty', 'scripts', 'week', 'Why', 'decided', 'Sarah', 'Thorp', 'See', 'Jane', 'Run', 'script', 'Twisted', 'stood', 'out', 'pack', 'utterly', 'me.Fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'called', 'Sea', 'Love', 'starring', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'detective', 'investigating', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'woman', 'boyfriends', 'seem', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'big', 'twist', 'well', 'predictable', 'know', 'Pacino', 'love', 'Barkin', 'who', 'course', 'main', 'suspect', 'thus', 'investigation', 'whole', 'new', 'urgency', 'suddenly', 'target', 'Sea', 'Love', 'wonderful', 'underrated', 'thriller', 'faded', 'obscurity', 'also', 'few', 'minor', 'changes', 'exact', 'plot', 'Twisted', 'case', 'investigating', 'officer', 'Jessica', 'Shepherd', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'yes', 'hear', 'thinking', 'ho', 'hum', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'murder', 'mystery-cum-thriller', 'better', 'folks', 'boyfriends', 'who', 'keep', 'turning', 'up', 'dead', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'cop', 'who', 'love', 'partner', 'Mike', 'DelMarco', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'previously', 'main', 'thing', 'was', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'starred', 'now', 'done', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'AND', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'space', 'two', 'years', 'Poor', 'guy', 'DelMarco', 'here', 'killer', 'victim', 'possibility', 'know', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'other', 'not', 'coming', 'unscathed', 'one', 'movie', 'biggest', 'problems', 'suspense', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'characters', 'only', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Not', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'walk', 'kill', 'written', 'foreheads', 'title', 'character', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'have', 'times', 'written', 'arms', 'well.The', 'other', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'casting', 'Ashley', 'Judd', ""n't"", 'usual', 'Ashley', 'peril', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bunch', 'times', 'one', 'Wise', 'Old', 'Black', 'Man', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'not', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Jessica', 'complex', 'character', 'strong', 'aggressive', 'alcoholic', 'huge', 'amounts', 'rage', 'bubbling', 'just', 'surface', 'put', 'simply', 'whole', 'thing', 'psychotic', 'Think', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'again', 'Cruising', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'not', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Which', 'good', 'scenes', 'one', 'ever', 'see', 'much', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'flesh', 'least', 'not', '2004', 'when', 'plumbing', 'emotional', 'depths', 'Jessica', 'Shepherd', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'chops', 'off', 'many', 'times', 'being', 'uncomfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'just', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'enough', 'Putting', 'sister', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'Twisted', 'watchable', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'better', 'actrss', 'taken', 'main', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'miles', 'better', 'had', 'not', 'recycled', 'old', 'plot', 'hoping', 'one', 'would', 'remember', '**']",Twisted

I was enchanted, not just by the three actors (Judd whose latest is De-Lovely; Garcia from the Godfather etc; and Juckson from Pulp Fiction, The Negotiator et al), but by the over-all concept and execution.Ignore the detractors--this is a superb story ably acted and I loved it.  We in the clandestine service are quite proud of having the very highest rate of alcoholism, adultery, divorce, and suicide (I have 18 professional suicides in my professional history).  I don't carry a badge, I do carry a Walther PPK Limited Edition (with a permit).All three of these actors are gifted, but seeing Judd in this film, in contrast to her performance and complete make-over in De-Lovely, persuades me that she is one of the greatest female actors of our time and will be offering us many more superb acts with world class male actors for years to come.This is a lovely first-rate film, and if you have lived with death and dishonor and fear including panic from time to time, this is a homecoming of sorts.

828990,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00029RT9E,Samuel McKewon,"[19, 22]","""Twisted"" is a howler, a straight-to-video script with three good actors - Ashley Judd, Samuel L. Jackson and Andy Garcia - turning in the worst performances of their career and one pedigree director - Philip Kaufman - shooting a few pretty scenes of San Francisco and then apparently calling it a day. Paramount dumped the movie in late February to catch a few wayward moviegoers suckered by the trailer; instead the studio finds itself up against Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" robbing Judd of her fan base of young, impressionable southern women. That demographic should take heed: This is no ""Kiss The Girls"" or ""Double Jeopardy."" It's not even ""High Crimes,"" a more apt title for these lost two hours.Judd, flouting about in a boy's haircut again - no actress gets more mileage out of the exact same look - plays Jessica, a San Fran homicide inspector working her first case with grizzled, creepy partner Mike (Garcia). The murders are the work of a serial killer who burns victims on the hand with a cigarette then beats them to death.The hitch? Every dead guy has had a rough, nameless one-night stand with Jessica, who gulps red wine and conveniently blacks out on the night of the murders from intoxication. The police chief (Jackson) has an interest in seeing Jessica succeed; he has raised the girl since her father, a cop himself, went on a killing spree, shot his wife, then committed suicide. Is Jessica working out her rage during the blackouts? Is it another pining for Jessica's affections? ""Twisted"" provides about nine possibilities.The screenplay, by Sarah Thorp, raises the stakes in the poker game of tin ears. A lawyer threatens to attack Jessica ""with both guns blazing!"" Another character exclaims ""they put me on the no access list!""  The killer, whom I will not reveal, seethes, ""I did this for you!"" Another murderer who has no relation to the central plot whispers, ""You're just like me!"" Jackson's character refers to himself as the ""master"" and likes to preface lines of dialogue with the word ""Test!""Basically an exercise in red herrings, Thorp supplies Jessica with a cigarette she does not smoke and Mike, who presumably makes six figures, with a dingy houseboat that might double as a murder house. There are creepy dreams, whispers in the night, voices in the wind, a box stuffed with childhood dolls and murder photos, harassing cops down at the precinct, a crazy ex-lover, an elderly Chinese neighbor in the window, numerous allusions to seals, and a shrink (David Strathairn) who prods Jessica for emotional truth and might as well be listed as ""Filler"" in the credits.Well, ""Twisted"" is just an awful motion picture, coherent but preposterous, riddled with the kind of coincidences and misunderstandings only teen comedies usually suffer. Judd, who strode confidently into the movie business with ""Ruby In Paradise"" and ""Normal Life,"" now seems perfectly content to play the same tomboy sweetheart again and again, all false trust and feisty vulnerability, wounded and bamboozled.

It doesn't help the cause that Judd is no Kim Basinger, and the intimate scenes (perhaps the only possible selling point in absence of a discernible plot) are thus about as titillating as a Yoga workout.

Judd plays a police officer who begins investigating a series of murders... all of whom are men. Samuel L. Jackson also has a role in this movie as her trusting friend. When it is discovered that every murder victom was someone that Judd had slept with, she ends up becoming a suspect in the very case she is working on to solve. This movie will keep you guessing. Is she really the killer and doesn't remember killing these men? or is there someone else who is trying to frame her? Interesting from beginning to end with a surprise ending.

They made it like a thriller; but sorry, the criminal is there, holding a huge sign 'I did it.''Twisted' is that bad, but has some interesting things in it.  It is about a new homicide detective in San Francisco Police Department Jessica Shephard, played by Ms. Judd in black leather jacket.  She has a unique character (if I may call it unique), for she not only kicks a bad guy, but pick up men at bars and have sex with them.  As if it means an intriguing reference to gender roles or something.No such luck, though.  As you see the film, the guy with whom Jessica slept one night is found dead at the back of the ballpark, where Jessica and her partner Andy Garcia start to muse about the killer.  Hum... Who did that?  Is this the beginning of another serial killer film, of which ending is way too contrived to believe?Besides Judd and Garcia, you get Samuel L. Jackson as Jessica's mentor and David Strathairn (John Sayles regular), and no prize for bad acting to any of them.  Director is Philip Kaufman, whose classic 'The Right Stuff' starts to sound very ironical in this B-thriller.The only merit comes from the moody photography of Peter Deming who captures the foggy atmosphere of the city.

Marshall,"[1, 3]","Another who-dun-it involving cops, serial killings and San Francisco with an interesting outcome surrounded by a typical cast of characters.Men are dying in San Francisco, washed up with beaten faces and cigarette burns. You would think a few good cops could figure yet another murder mystery out but this one has a few twists. A woman detective might be getting framed or is she at fault for sleeping around? An evil eyed partner acts a little too familiar with her surroundings. An unsolved mystery is covered up by a malicious police force and a surrogate father pushes a bit too hard. So who did it? Let the fog of San Francisco be your guide!Ashley Judd plays the same character she always plays, vulnerable, tough, on the verge of tears and at the center of yet another murder mystery. In this role she is offered a bit of an edge, an angry one that she tries to cover by sleeping around with men that she picks up at random at bars.....would a professional detective really be open to the danger in that? Her partner is played by Andy Garcia who just sort of blends into the scenery except for a few random moments spent on his suspicious eyes. Samuel L. Jackson is Judd's surrogate father, the man who raised her after his partner (her father) is killed on duty. With a few other male detectives making their presence on screen just to snidely comment on Judd's sexual habits the cast is complete and entirely typical. The only surprise comes at the end...as it should!If you enjoy movies that involve a mystery then this film may appeal to you. The story is fairly basic but the plot leads you into the twist at the end.
