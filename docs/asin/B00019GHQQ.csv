797013,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00019GHQQ,,"[4, 4]","In the mood for some Drag Queens and a few laughs?  Well, you're in luck--""Girls Will Be Girls"" is a nutty confection that should satisfy your craving.  Skewering many of the old-fashioned ""weepies,"" this fast and loose film layers on the jokes so that even if some fall flat--others will hit their respective targets shortly thereafter.  In the spirit of full disclosure, though, I have to admit that I was a neighbor and acquaintance of Clinton Leupp (Miss Coco Peru also featured notably in ""Trick"") for many years.  That, however, does not affect my fondness for this silly and enjoyable romp. Like a Drag Queen updating of ""Valley of the Dolls,"" but purposefully funny and campy, ""Girls"" definitely succeeds as entertainment.I don't know how significant the plot will be to those who are checking into this film, but here's a brief synopsis.  Washed-up and aging actress Evie (Jack Plotnick) and her put-upon roommate Coco (Clinton Leupp) take in a Hollywood newcomer.  Varla (Jeffery Roberson) is the daughter of Evie's former rival, but that doesn't stop the ladies from being attracted to her rent money.  Evie is happy to impart her wisdom on the young aspiring actress--that is until Varla starts to be successful in an infomercial!  Reawakening Evie's jealousy, the film becomes a battle of wills as all three ladies are harboring secrets from the past that can destroy them.  Having already referenced ""Valley,"" you can also see hints of ""All About Eve,"" ""Sunset Boulevard,"" and a number of other pictures in this satiric homage to old school Hollywood melodrama.The ""actresses"" do a great job throwing themselves into the material.  It is their commitment to the story that propels ""Girls"" past its novelty and curiosity factor into a full blown success.  Plotnick, in the film's showiest role, has a great comedic flair.  A narcissist of the highest order, I think the film's funniest moments showcase her complete lack of regard for her lifelong friend Coco.  Leupp actually surprised me, too.  Coco is perhaps the film's most complex performance, and Leupp's decision to subtly underplay the material (especially in the hysterical flashbacks) makes it that much more hysterical.  The deadpan delivery is spot-on.  I also enjoyed Ron Mathews as Evie's son Stevie who becomes infatuated with Varla's ample......uh, charms.While ""Girls Will Be Girls"" is a ribald and outrageous bit of nonsense--let's face it, we're not judging it along the same lines as ""serious minded"" or classic film.  The 4 stars I've awarded the film reflect more of the entertainment value and laugh quotient contained within this brief 80 minute film than its artistic merit.  For this film can be riotously amusing, trashy, and over-the-top fun.  It doesn't aspire to be anything else, and that's why it is so successful.  Check it out--it's particularly good with cocktails.

797021,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B00019GHQQ,Edward Aycock,"[11, 17]","First the good news: the acting, the makeup, the sets, the colors all add up to one of the most gorgeously campy looking films of all time. All three of the leads are very good.  Having only seen Jack Plotnick in non-drag roles (Ellen, The Jenny McCarthy Show on MTV, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), I have to say he was very funny and his wig was perfect, but the real honor goes to Jeffery Robeson whose Varla (his off-screen drag persona as well) is so spot-on perfect that a few times I had to remind myself that this wasn't an actual woman.  Even more amazing is seeing the male Robeson out of makeup (on the extras) as a nice-looking young guy.The bad news is that as great as this film looks and is acted (at times, it seems to bring to mind Comedy Central's &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; for the way the actors play many things straight), the film suffers from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch syndrome: it goes on too long and runs out of humor steam. An hour or 45 minutes would have been sufficient for the film's running time. The plot gets stretched and by the time Evie's &quot;speciamercial&quot; revelation occurs, I wasn't laughing anymore. The sense of glee was wearing thin, and not even the pool party flashbacks could perk the film up again. Plus, the &quot;naked&quot; Evie was pretty gross and unnecessary.All in all, a decent film with a generous portion of extras on the DVD.",3,Girls will be guys,1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,1404,"['First', 'good', 'news', 'acting', 'makeup', 'sets', 'colors', 'add', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeously', 'campy', 'looking', 'films', 'time', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Having', 'only', 'seen', 'Jack', 'Plotnick', 'non-drag', 'roles', 'Ellen', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'Show', 'MTV', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'wig', 'was', 'perfect', 'real', 'honor', 'Jeffery', 'Robeson', 'Varla', 'off-screen', 'drag', 'persona', 'well', 'so', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'few', 'times', 'had', 'remind', 'was', ""n't"", 'actual', 'woman', 'Even', 'more', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'male', 'Robeson', 'makeup', 'extras', 'nice-looking', 'young', 'guy.The', 'bad', 'news', 'as', 'great', 'film', 'acted', 'times', 'bring', 'mind', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'quot', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'quot', 'way', 'actors', 'play', 'many', 'things', 'straight', 'film', 'suffers', 'quot', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'quot', 'syndrome', 'too', 'long', 'humor', 'steam', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sufficient', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'plot', 'stretched', 'time', 'Evie', 'quot', 'speciamercial', 'quot', 'revelation', 'was', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'anymore', 'sense', 'glee', 'was', 'wearing', 'thin', 'not', 'even', 'pool', 'party', 'flashbacks', 'could', 'perk', 'film', 'up', 'again', 'quot', 'quot', 'Evie', 'was', 'pretty', 'gross', 'unnecessary.All', 'decent', 'film', 'generous', 'portion', 'extras', 'DVD']",Girls Will Be Girls

She moves in with two other actresses: Coco, trying to find her true love but haunted by dreams of Dr. Perfect; and Evie, an aging actress trying to make a comeback.  Along the way, Varla meets Stevie, the handsome son of Evie.  He falls in love with her at first sight, but wonders if his &quot;tiny&quot; problem will get in the way of their being together.  When Varla gets her big break in a commercial, jealousy rears its head as Evie remembers the shocking and disturbing events that happened between her and Varla's mother, Marla.  Is Varla here to thwart her efforts at regaining her stardom?This is a wonderfully campy and un-PC look at the Hollywood dream of making it big in the movies.  The story is a little slow in some points, but the actors more than make up for it with their delivery of the catty dialogue and their acting skills.  What also makes this a wonderful film is that all the actors are men: from Varla, Coco and Evie to Stevie, the nurse and Dr. Perfect.  Jack Plotnick (Evie), Clinton Leupp (Coco), and Jeffrey Robertson (Varla/Marla) are all phenomenal in their roles.  And Ron Mathews gives a fine, comic performance as Stevie.  The special effects are interesting, too, and quite surprising.The DVD is great, not only because of the extras (like the funny deleted scenes), but each menu has a little routine either by all four of the main leads or by them in groups of two.

797025,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00019GHQQ,James Hiller,"[2, 2]","The big reason why I rented ""Girls Will Be Girls"" from my local video store was the fact that Jack Plotnick appears in this film. I've secretly followed his career, ever since seeing him on Ellen to his brief but memorable performance in ""Gods and Monsters"". Drag shows just haven't been my cup of tea. So, this review is solely based on your level of interest in that art form.""Girls Will Be Girls"" is the story of three actresses, each played by men, who aspire, have aspired, or have expired in Hollywood. The entertainment from the movie comes not from the plot, however, but from the bitchy interchanges in between the queens as they fight and argue their way through the movie.The actors playing the queens do an excellent job with the parts they have.

797027,A34BP6PCVMX46G,B00019GHQQ,Jeff Eastwood,"[0, 0]","Evie (Jack Plotnick) is a washed-up B-movie actress who is decidedly not aging gracefully. She lives with Coco (Clinton Leupp), her more grounded friend who functions mainly as Evie's maid and abuse magnet. Into their lives walks their new roommate Varla (Jeffery Roberson), an aspiring starlet whose late mother Marla was also Evie's most hated acting rival. All of them have dreams, of course. Evie's dreams involve drinking as many martinis as she can and then having plenty of sex with anyone available. Coco still pines for the hunky abortion doctor that operated on her many years ago. Varla hopes to become the actress that her mother couldn't while dealing with the advances of Evie's gorgeous son Stevie (Ron Mathews). Of course, there are hidden motives galore, and more than one mean-spirited one-liner. Plotnick is quite humorous, dropping the most of them and the clips of Evie performing in the 60's stinker ""Asteroid"" resemble nothing less than Morgan Fairchild on qualudes. Leupp reprises the role of Coco from his scene-stealing moments in the movie ""Trick"", and he imbues the character both with a humorous sense of bad luck and an immediately sympathetic personality. Roberson is not quite as spectacular as his co-stars, but he gives the naive, trusting Varla a great heart and a hilarious scene involving opera and cheese in a can. When it's funny, it's very funny. When it's in bad taste, it's even funnier. The sets and costumes (as you would expect) are all letter perfect and there are as many sight gags as there are funny lines. Need cheering up?

I've watched it a good half-dozen times since purchasing it last year and probably will again, very soon.I recommend it to fans of one-liners and sarcasm but warn prudes against it, since some of the lines might be quite offensive to some.

Since I'm in Canada, I ended up ordering the American version (and selling my other copy) just for those.Enough said, now hit the ""Add to Shopping Card"" button!P.S.

I am embarrassed to admit that because most of the humor is very low-brow and slapstick.  The slut and alcohol jokes fly fast an furious (there is one line that you are guaranteed to repeat to your friends later), but only about half of them hit the mark, and to be honest by the end of the movie they get kind of old.  A lot of the humor is very campy - we loaned our copy to two of our lesbian friends who couldn't get into it at all.  So my verdict would be the first half is pretty funny, with parts hilarious, and parts that were good.  The second half was pretty lame, and by the end, I was pretty glad to see the end.  The hilarious parts in the first half were enough for me to want to own a copy.  My advice would be to rent this one first if you can.",3,"It was the best of movies, it was the worst of movies",1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,887,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'uneven', 'first', 'half', 'found', 'hilarious', 'literally', 'did', 'spit-take', 'living', 'room', 'one', 'scene', 'am', 'embarrassed', 'admit', 'most', 'humor', 'very', 'low-brow', 'slapstick', 'slut', 'alcohol', 'jokes', 'fly', 'fast', 'furious', 'one', 'line', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'repeat', 'friends', 'later', 'only', 'half', 'hit', 'mark', 'be', 'honest', 'end', 'movie', 'get', 'kind', 'old', 'lot', 'humor', 'very', 'campy', 'loaned', 'copy', 'two', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'verdict', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'half', 'pretty', 'funny', 'parts', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'were', 'good', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'glad', 'see', 'end', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'first', 'half', 'were', 'enough', 'want', 'own', 'copy', 'My', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'rent', 'one', 'first', 'can']",Girls Will Be Girls
