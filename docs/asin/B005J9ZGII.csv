""Cardinal Bound!!!!""","[0, 0]","This is a movie that I found on Redbox, and let me be clear that it just illustrates that with the new technology anyone can become a movie producer. This was poorly shot, poorly planned, and contained horrid acting. It looked as though some drinking buddies got crocked one night, and said ""hey lets make a cowboy movie.""

Teslovich,"[1, 3]","The first thing you notice is how sloooow time is moving as you doze off while watching a bunch of people riding or should I say walking their horses while going nowhere except to some poorly scripted dead end at the hands of some guy that just shows up and shoots them dead seemingly always about in the same spot. Even the fatal gunshot was always in the same chest spot. I guess the props people must have used the same red paint blood seeping vest over and over again. That's the whole movie.Dialogue was bizarre in that it sounded more like some one from Hollywood trying to imagine how people talked back then. Always amusing when they use some contemporary phrasing.Acting was mostly a crew with little experience or maybe a few TV spots and a few well known titles such as ""Terror at Blood Fart Lake"", ""Stiffed"", ""The Stink of Flesh"", ""Rotgut"".Directing and cinematography gave us a lot of scenery of sage brush desert.

This alleged western has a local playhouse feel to it. It really looks like a group of guys with a room full of western clothing and accouterments got bored one day and someone said...""Hey! I got an idea. Let's make a cowboy movie.""I've seen better ""western"" genre amateur films before that were OK...and some that were not. But this one takes the cake.

There is not much to say about this movie. Like most of the westerns lately it is flat, pretty boring and full of bad acting. This one is not as bad as most mainly because it is so boring and the acting is flat and emotionless there is really nothing to talk about. This one has quite possibly the worst ""duel"" gunfight scene I have ever seen it's almost worth watching just to see that. Overall, better then most of the newer westerns that have been released, but still for the hardcore western fan only.
