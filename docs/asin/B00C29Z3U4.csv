I admit I was a bit sceptical about the ability to get a good work out when there is no standing required. But this is definitely not a lazy girl's work out and you will feel sore the next day. Heck, I didn't realise how hard it would be to keep one leg raised (parallel to the floor) to do leg circles while balanced on the knee of my other leg and hand. Curse you gravity!It's not a cardio workout - but your heart will be pounding as you fight gravity. A towel or similiar to cushion your knees is a must - I am 36 and do not have knee issues but bone (with the added weight of your body) plus a hard surface is never a good combination - especially in the long run!",3,This is different!,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,763,"['workout', 'definitely', 'different', 'Ellen', 'other', 'DVDs', 'standing', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'sceptical', 'ability', 'get', 'good', 'work', 'out', 'when', 'standing', 'required', 'definitely', 'not', 'lazy', 'girl', 'work', 'out', 'will', 'feel', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'Heck', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'how', 'hard', 'would', 'be', 'keep', 'one', 'leg', 'raised', 'parallel', 'floor', 'do', 'leg', 'circles', 'balanced', 'knee', 'other', 'leg', 'hand', 'Curse', 'gravity', 'not', 'cardio', 'workout', 'heart', 'will', 'be', 'pounding', 'fight', 'gravity', 'towel', 'similiar', 'cushion', 'knees', 'must', 'am', '36', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'knee', 'issues', 'bone', 'added', 'weight', 'body', 'hard', 'surface', 'never', 'good', 'combination', 'especially', 'long', 'run']",Fusion Floor Workout

1641497,A36XEVXB5SD826,B00C29Z3U4,Suzanne,"[3, 3]","This is a really nice, end-of-the-day workout. I like being able to sit down and do lots of stretching, toning and lengthening. I don't think people realize how important flexibility and muscle toning is as you age. The yoga fusion poses are super deep muscle stretches and strengthening all at the same time. The abs/Pilates section is a great tummy toner and there are quite a bit of back, arms, and legs in there too.The only reason I took off one star is because a couple of the poses are uncomfortable, even using a yoga mat. You may want extra cushioning under your knee during the leg lifts and circles. Putting all of your weight on one knee for such a long time does begin to hurt. Easy to modify though.Love Ellen, all her videos are fantastic!",4,LOVE Ellen!,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,754,"['really', 'nice', 'end-of-the-day', 'workout', 'being', 'able', 'sit', 'down', 'do', 'lots', 'stretching', 'toning', 'lengthening', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'realize', 'how', 'important', 'flexibility', 'muscle', 'toning', 'age', 'yoga', 'fusion', 'poses', 'are', 'super', 'deep', 'muscle', 'stretches', 'strengthening', 'same', 'time', 'abs/Pilates', 'section', 'great', 'tummy', 'toner', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'back', 'arms', 'legs', 'only', 'reason', 'took', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'couple', 'poses', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'using', 'yoga', 'mat', 'may', 'want', 'extra', 'cushioning', 'knee', 'leg', 'lifts', 'circles', 'Putting', 'weight', 'one', 'knee', 'long', 'time', 'begin', 'hurt', 'Easy', 'modify', 'though.Love', 'Ellen', 'videos', 'are', 'fantastic']",Fusion Floor Workout
