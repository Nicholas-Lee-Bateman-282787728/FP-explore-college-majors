1095388,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000UNYJRC,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[3, 4]","IN THE SPIDER'S WEBAnother film in the ""Maneater"" series in fact I believe it is the second and to be honest it is actually enjoyable and not as horrible as others may say. When I first learned of this film it immediately had something going for it, and his name is Lance Henriksen. So naturally I had to not only see this but own it so of course I made it mine. Naturally it was me and my bro watching this and as expected Lance was great and the film was not so bad. I would not say this is the best in the series but it is kinda entertaining although towards the end it felt a bit long.The movie follows a group of friends who are hiking threw a jungle when one of them is bitten by a spider. Almost immediately she starts to feel the effects so the guide recommends a tribe near by. This tribe's village is home to a doctor who is an expert is spiders because the tribe worships them. Dr. Lecorpus [Lance] begins to treat the girl as soon as they bring her and his methods are a little weird. Aside from that he seems normal and the friends decide to go back to the town to get more help. Two decide to stay behind with the girl and that is were things get interesting. The Doc says there is nothing they can do but wait so they should just hang out. With that said they decide to go hiking some more and look for a temple that up until now has been legend. When they find this place they may find their doom and the good doctor may be behind it.Gary Dauberman did a pretty good job as far as the story goes because it is interesting and entertaining, he is also one of the writers of ""Blood Monkey"", another ""Maneater"" film. As for the direction that comes courtesy of Terry Winsor and he does a good enough job but I still feel like the film went a little to long but I do give them credit. Lance Henriksen as always is great as the Doctor in this at the village, he makes for a great creepy kinda villain. The young cast is surprisingly good well not all of them but for the most part they are good. The biggest surprise in this film is easily the guy that played the police officer that went in to help out the Americans. He did an excellent job on this film and they actually let him be not only a major player in this film but the hero really. He was probably my favorite in the film along with Lance. Also Lance's crazy brother is kinda weird, but it added a little something to it.I would not say that this is the best movie ever or even the best of this series but it is entertaining enough. Like I said in my last review I would recommend this to lovers of this type of film but any body may like it if they give it a chance. Lance fans will be happy with his performance I think and he helps make this a decent nature run amuck flick. Give it a chance and at least catch it on SyFy on a rerun or something.",3,ANOTHER DECENT MANEATER FLICK,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,2821,"['IN', 'THE', 'SPIDER', 'WEBAnother', 'film', 'Maneater', 'series', 'fact', 'believe', 'second', 'be', 'honest', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'as', 'horrible', 'others', 'may', 'say', 'When', 'first', 'learned', 'film', 'immediately', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'name', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'So', 'naturally', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'own', 'so', 'course', 'made', 'mine', 'Naturally', 'was', 'bro', 'watching', 'expected', 'Lance', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'best', 'series', 'kinda', 'entertaining', 'end', 'felt', 'bit', 'long.The', 'movie', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'hiking', 'threw', 'jungle', 'when', 'one', 'bitten', 'spider', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'feel', 'effects', 'guide', 'tribe', 'tribe', 'village', 'home', 'doctor', 'who', 'expert', 'spiders', 'tribe', 'worships', 'Dr.', 'Lecorpus', '[', 'Lance', ']', 'treat', 'girl', 'as', 'soon', 'bring', 'methods', 'are', 'little', 'weird', 'Aside', 'normal', 'friends', 'decide', 'go', 'back', 'town', 'get', 'more', 'help', 'Two', 'decide', 'stay', 'girl', 'were', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Doc', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'wait', 'so', 'should', 'just', 'hang', 'out', 'said', 'decide', 'go', 'hiking', 'more', 'look', 'temple', 'up', 'now', 'been', 'legend', 'When', 'find', 'place', 'may', 'find', 'doom', 'good', 'doctor', 'may', 'be', 'it.Gary', 'Dauberman', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'also', 'one', 'writers', 'Blood', 'Monkey', 'Maneater', 'film', 'direction', 'courtesy', 'Terry', 'Winsor', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'still', 'feel', 'film', 'went', 'little', 'long', 'do', 'give', 'credit', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'always', 'great', 'Doctor', 'village', 'great', 'creepy', 'kinda', 'villain', 'young', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'well', 'not', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'good', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'film', 'easily', 'guy', 'played', 'police', 'officer', 'went', 'help', 'out', 'Americans', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'actually', 'let', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'major', 'player', 'film', 'hero', 'really', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'film', 'Lance', 'Also', 'Lance', 'crazy', 'brother', 'kinda', 'weird', 'added', 'little', 'something', 'it.I', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'even', 'best', 'series', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'said', 'last', 'review', 'would', 'recommend', 'lovers', 'type', 'film', 'body', 'may', 'like', 'give', 'chance', 'Lance', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'performance', 'think', 'make', 'decent', 'nature', 'run', 'amuck', 'flick', 'Give', 'chance', 'least', 'catch', 'SyFy', 'rerun', 'something']",In the Spider's Web
1095389,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000UNYJRC,Joshua Koppel,"[6, 6]","One day I watched a film called Night Feeders and found some real talent at work.  I had a similar feeling with this film.  Lance Henriksen (the only actor whose name is used in the packaging) is a mysterious doctor living with a jungle tribe.  A jungle tour runs afoul of a spider and they go to the native village for medical help.  These natives worship spiders as gods and Lance seems to have some similar feelings.  Some of the tour stay in the village and some go back to civilization for additional help.  Eventually we find out what Lance is up to and we get a pretty good resolution.The story is not great but it has some interesting twists and traits.  Like with Night Feeders an unexpected character rises to the top.  This character is one of my current favorites from recent movies and shows that the makers were willing to try something different.  The rest of the film is not as good as Night Feeders in originality  and has a few problems.  For some reason the natives who worship the spiders also eat them.  In one scene Lance looks like he is participating, even chewing, although the effects team, or someone, let the spider be seen going right past his head instead of into his mouth.  There is no explanation as to why the natives are helping Lance and he seems to have no real power over them.  I guess they were going for a little Doctor Moreau.  But overall it is an okay film and worth it for that one special character.  Check it out.",4,Not Since Night Feeders,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1460,"['One', 'day', 'watched', 'film', 'called', 'Night', 'Feeders', 'found', 'real', 'talent', 'work', 'had', 'similar', 'feeling', 'film', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'only', 'actor', 'name', 'used', 'packaging', 'mysterious', 'doctor', 'living', 'jungle', 'tribe', 'jungle', 'tour', 'afoul', 'spider', 'go', 'native', 'village', 'medical', 'help', 'natives', 'worship', 'spiders', 'gods', 'Lance', 'have', 'similar', 'feelings', 'tour', 'stay', 'village', 'go', 'back', 'civilization', 'additional', 'help', 'Eventually', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Lance', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'resolution.The', 'story', 'not', 'great', 'interesting', 'twists', 'traits', 'Night', 'Feeders', 'unexpected', 'character', 'top', 'character', 'one', 'current', 'favorites', 'recent', 'movies', 'makers', 'were', 'willing', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Night', 'Feeders', 'originality', 'few', 'problems', 'reason', 'natives', 'who', 'worship', 'spiders', 'also', 'eat', 'one', 'scene', 'Lance', 'participating', 'even', 'chewing', 'effects', 'team', 'someone', 'let', 'spider', 'be', 'seen', 'going', 'right', 'head', 'instead', 'mouth', 'explanation', 'why', 'natives', 'are', 'helping', 'Lance', 'have', 'real', 'power', 'guess', 'were', 'going', 'little', 'Doctor', 'Moreau', 'overall', 'okay', 'film', 'worth', 'one', 'special', 'character', 'Check', 'out']",In the Spider's Web

If spiders horror movies scare you then this movie is for you. All that said. A group if hikers going through a jungle come across a part of it infested with all kind of spiders. One of the spiders bites a female. The other hikers take her to a village where they find a Dr. who treats her but he has a secret he doesn't want anyone to know about. The hikers have to fight their way out of spider infested caves and a jungle to survive the Dr.s secret. The film has a lot of real spiders but also alot of fake ones. I don't care for spiders myself and was terrified of the as a kid. I still will jump if one crawls on me but this film bored me more than scared me.

1095393,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000UNYJRC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","In the Spider's Web (Terry Winsor, 2007)I have to admit, about halfway into this movie, I was really prepared to like it. Spiders make great movie monsters, and the cast weren't entirely shabby. Then we get to endless people-being-chased-by-spiders-down-tunnels. And the stupid commenced. I mean, come on. You're in spider-infested tunnels that are thick with spiderwebs. You're carrying a torch. How hard is it to come up with the right answer? Hard enough, it seems, that it takes square-jawed hero John (Cian Barry, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Breaking Benjamin vocalist Ben Burnley) over half an hour of movie time running around in those tunnels to do the thing that I'm sure 90% of the people watching this movie would have done before they went into the tunnels in the first place.In any event, the story: John is on vacation with some friends. There's Gina (Emma Catherwood), who's completely smitten with John, and Stacy (Lisa Livingstone), who thinks it's incredibly stupid that Gina and John haven't gotten it on yet, since it's pretty obvious the feeling's mutual. Then there's Brian (Mike Rogers) and Phil (Michael Smiley). One of them's a guide, but which one of them it is seems to keep changing. I originally thought it was Phil, but then it seemed to be Brian, then... oh, you know. And there's Geraldine (Jane Perry), who seems to be a naturalist of some sort. (As you can tell by my somewhat befuddled commentary, character development was not a huge part of the script.) One night while they're in the jungle, Geraldine gets bitten by a spider, and the group are forced to find their way to the nearest village, where an American doctor, Lecorpus (Lance Henriksen), and his brother have taken up residence. Lecorpus does his thing, and while Geraldine recuperates, the group decides to do the one thing every group must do in a horror film: split up. Brilliant! (There's another main character-- actually, the best of the bunch, a local cop who provides wonderful comic relief-- but he is, unfortunately, uncredited. Whoever you were, you almost saved this movie!) Brian, Gina, and John head back to town to try and scare up some medical supplies for the doctor, while Stacy and Phil decide to go explore the ruins of an old temple, which is why the group was out in the jungle in the first place. Hint: if your friend was bitten by an oddly non-indigenous spider, and the big temple you came to explore is carved in the shape of a spider, you should probably leave. Quickly. This is, however, a horror film, and everyone in it, therefore, must be a total idiot.But, like I said, I did originally have high hopes for this. Gary Dauberman's first script actually has some real characters in it; for all they're dumb, and their roles are inconsistent, they are pretty well-drawn (especially for a Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie). Henriksen, whose previously brilliant career has been sidetracked by a string of godawful movies like this for about a decade, probably does the best acting I've seen from him since the criminally short-lived TV series Millennium. The others aren't too bad either, when the script isn't forcing them to be terminally idiotic. But, man, I just can't get past the stupid. You're surrounded by spiderwebs, and you're carrying a torch... **",2,So much wasted potential.,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,3300,"['Spider', 'Web', 'Terry', 'Winsor', '2007', 'have', 'admit', 'halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'prepared', 'like', 'Spiders', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'monsters', 'cast', 'were', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'shabby', 'Then', 'get', 'endless', 'people-being-chased-by-spiders-down-tunnels', 'stupid', 'commenced', 'mean', 'come', ""'re"", 'spider-infested', 'tunnels', 'are', 'thick', 'spiderwebs', ""'re"", 'carrying', 'torch', 'How', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'right', 'answer', 'Hard', 'enough', 'square-jawed', 'hero', 'John', 'Cian', 'Barry', 'who', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Breaking', 'Benjamin', 'vocalist', 'Ben', 'Burnley', 'hour', 'movie', 'time', 'running', 'around', 'tunnels', 'do', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', '90', '%', 'people', 'watching', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'went', 'tunnels', 'first', 'place.In', 'event', 'story', 'John', 'vacation', 'friends', 'Gina', 'Emma', 'Catherwood', 'who', 'completely', 'smitten', 'John', 'Stacy', 'Lisa', 'Livingstone', 'who', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'Gina', 'John', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'Then', 'Brian', 'Mike', 'Rogers', 'Phil', 'Michael', 'Smiley', 'One', 'guide', 'one', 'keep', 'changing', 'originally', 'thought', 'was', 'Phil', 'then', 'seemed', 'be', 'Brian', 'then', 'oh', 'know', 'Geraldine', 'Jane', 'Perry', 'who', 'be', 'naturalist', 'sort', 'can', 'tell', 'somewhat', 'befuddled', 'commentary', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'part', 'script', 'One', 'night', ""'re"", 'jungle', 'Geraldine', 'bitten', 'spider', 'group', 'are', 'forced', 'find', 'way', 'nearest', 'village', 'where', 'American', 'doctor', 'Lecorpus', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'brother', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'Lecorpus', 'thing', 'Geraldine', 'group', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'group', 'must', 'do', 'horror', 'film', 'split', 'up', 'Brilliant', 'main', 'character', 'actually', 'best', 'bunch', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'relief', 'unfortunately', 'uncredited', 'were', 'almost', 'saved', 'movie', 'Brian', 'Gina', 'John', 'head', 'back', 'town', 'try', 'scare', 'up', 'medical', 'supplies', 'doctor', 'Stacy', 'Phil', 'decide', 'go', 'explore', 'ruins', 'old', 'temple', 'why', 'group', 'was', 'out', 'jungle', 'first', 'place', 'Hint', 'friend', 'was', 'bitten', 'oddly', 'non-indigenous', 'spider', 'big', 'temple', 'came', 'explore', 'carved', 'shape', 'spider', 'should', 'probably', 'leave', 'Quickly', 'however', 'horror', 'film', 'everyone', 'therefore', 'must', 'be', 'total', 'idiot.But', 'said', 'did', 'originally', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'Gary', 'Dauberman', 'first', 'script', 'actually', 'real', 'characters', ""'re"", 'dumb', 'roles', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'are', 'pretty', 'well-drawn', 'especially', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movie', 'Henriksen', 'previously', 'brilliant', 'career', 'been', 'sidetracked', 'string', 'godawful', 'movies', 'decade', 'probably', 'best', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'criminally', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'Millennium', 'others', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'either', 'when', 'script', ""n't"", 'forcing', 'be', 'terminally', 'idiotic', 'man', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'stupid', ""'re"", 'surrounded', 'spiderwebs', ""'re"", 'carrying', 'torch', '**']",In the Spider's Web

That sentence, by the way, should give you some idea what to expect from this movie, in terms of budget, plot and... well pretty much everything else. Nonetheless, its an enjoyable movie. I mean, for $10 what do you expect, right?So take your standard plot... a group of American teens go tramping about the jungles of India. One gets bit by a spider, goes to find a village doctor, and they get wrapped up in a mysterious spider worshipping cult that steals people's organs and sells them on the black market... All that, and you've got swarms of CGI-spiders running about. Oh, and of course plastic spiders and fake spider webbing too... you know, like the type you can buy as Halloween decorations. Despite the insanity of the movie, its actually pretty fun in a cheesy way. It also stars Lance Henriksen, which only added to the appeal for me.I can only imagine the budget they must have had while filming this. Although set in India, my first guess would be that it was actually filmed in Thailand. Especially since theres only one Indian actor in the film, and the villagers look more like a bunch of people from Southeast Asia clad in loinclothes and turbans. Still, I didn't go into it looking for scientific or cultural accuracy. Its just a cheap 'animal attack of the week' type film, but a fun one at that. So keep up the good work, and look for more of the Maneaters movies, because thus far they've all been pretty good (or bad maybe).",4,Step Into My Parlor...,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1604,"['Yet', 'terrific', 'outing', 'Maneaters', 'series', 'collection', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'animals', 'going', 'amok', 'originally', 'aired', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'channel', 'sentence', 'way', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'terms', 'budget', 'plot', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'Nonetheless', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'mean', '10', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'right', 'So', 'take', 'standard', 'plot', 'group', 'American', 'teens', 'go', 'tramping', 'jungles', 'India', 'One', 'bit', 'spider', 'find', 'village', 'doctor', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'mysterious', 'spider', 'worshipping', 'cult', 'people', 'organs', 'black', 'market', ""'ve"", 'got', 'swarms', 'CGI-spiders', 'running', 'about', 'Oh', 'course', 'plastic', 'spiders', 'fake', 'spider', 'webbing', 'too', 'know', 'type', 'can', 'buy', 'Halloween', 'decorations', 'insanity', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'fun', 'cheesy', 'way', 'also', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'only', 'added', 'appeal', 'me.I', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'budget', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'filming', 'set', 'India', 'first', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Thailand', 'Especially', 'theres', 'only', 'one', 'Indian', 'actor', 'film', 'villagers', 'look', 'more', 'bunch', 'people', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'clad', 'loinclothes', 'turbans', 'Still', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'looking', 'scientific', 'cultural', 'accuracy', 'just', 'cheap', ""'animal"", 'attack', 'week', 'type', 'film', 'fun', 'one', 'So', 'keep', 'up', 'good', 'work', 'look', 'more', 'Maneaters', 'movies', 'thus', 'far', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'bad', 'maybe']",In the Spider's Web
