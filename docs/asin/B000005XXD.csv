Shirley MClaine plays Madame Sousatzka, a concert piano teacher, who takes on a 15-year-old Indian boy in London as her pupil. She drives him like a dog, but falls in love with him too, and tries to protect him from the money grubbing agents. She fails at this (inevitable, I suppose) because he need the money to help his mother. The film tries to do too much in its 126-minute length, with certain elements being carried only so far and then abandoned (Madame S.'s son Edward, her own past and failure, and the girl pop singer Julie [played by Twiggy] to name just three).

I have owned it for many years and watch it on a regular basis.I thought Shirley McClaine and the rest of the cast were absolutely perfection in their roles. Shirley Maclaine completely became Madame Souzatska, she transcended the art of acting.This story about an very eccentric (though very good hearted) piano teacher and her relationship with a teenage virtuoso (named Manek Sen) is truly a classic piece of art. There are so many levels going on at once, not only with these key characters, but the others as well.There is Manek's single mom who has sacrificed everything for her son and wants him to be able to perform and prosper as quickly as possible, while Madame Souzatska wants to let the boy mature as an artist. There is the dynamic of the elderly ""Lady Emily"", Mr. Cordle and Madame Souzatska, who have been living in the same building forever and are like a family along with the pretty young aspiring Pop singer Jenny (Twiggy) who also lives in the building.Jenny has a boyfriend who is an artist agent who becomes enamored with the young virtuoso and wants to promote his talents. At the same time Manek has developed a crush on Jenny. Both of these things go against the grain for Madame Souzatka and create a subtle tension. As I said, there's a lot of levels all interacting at the same time that create a wonderful tapestry of dynamics and emotions.I won't try to give to many details of this movie because I couldn't do it justice. All I can say is that it is a favorite of mine and I do hope that they'll put it out on DVD.

492892,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000005XXD,Craig Matteson,"[5, 6]","I appreciate this film more now than I did when it first came out and wish it were more generally available, especially on DVD.  While it certainly is a great vehicle for Shirley MacLaine, it is more than just a showcase for her.  It is a story about transitions, of being between worlds and finding one's way through being defined by others.  The ostensible point of the story is the art of playing classical piano.Madame Sousatzka (MacLaine) is an older and famous piano teacher.  She is known for her authoritarian and, well, old fashioned ways.  However, she produces students who can really play.  The problem is they tend to leave her.  Of course, one thing piano teachers (all teachers) know when a student starts with them is that the relationship will, at some point, come to an end as the student goes off on their own path.  In reality, a great teacher knows this and the very best ones teach their students to become independent and able to learn and work on their own.  However, the teaching of piano is still the older style of master - student intimacy and when a student leaves before the master is ready or if the student is rejected by the master, well, terrible hurts are unavoidable.Madame's rigidity and demanding demeanor come from her own training from her mother, who was an even greater concert artist.  The studio is dominated by a large portrait of her mother and so much of what Sousatzka does flows from her relationship with her mother.  The mother, though, was not a healthy teacher for her daughter.  During the movie we learn about a terrible source of pain and fear that still grips Madame at the present time of the movie.  It has paralyzed her for much of her life, even while Madame still idolizes and imitates her mother more than she knows.  For Sousatzka the transitions are between a past world that has a dying place in the present and the question of whether she can ever get free of her mother and her own painful memories.The student in this movie is Manek Sen (played quite well by Navin Chowdhry).  He is a brilliantly talented boy from an immigrant family.  He has his own domination problems with his own mother and then gets into a domineering student-teacher relationship with Sousatzka.  He has pressures from his mother who constantly lets her know of all her sacrifices (working and selling her jewelry) to get him his training and wants to be taken care of.  Manek doesn't like the man she has taken up with, and wants to use his gifts to provide for her (his father has died).  Since musical prodigies make good box office, he is also being pursued by an agent who wants to get him on the stage - the agent is also trying to get him to another teacher.  Manek also has terrible pressures about his own Indian culture versus the European culture he is living in and whose music he is learning to play.  Sousatzka is trying to remake him into a European so he can play the music more completely, but his mother resists the change because of her own desires to keep her boy close to her.Madame is dead set against him going to the stage to early, because of her own painful experience.  And this holding back from the stage is what causes her students to leave.  They want to play.  She wants to spare them from the pain of failing on stage without ever explaining it.Well, I don't want to share how all this comes together, but the ending of the movie does have transitions made and not everything is wrapped up neatly.  However, we know more about where everyone is going and understand why.As for the playing in the movie, it is pretty good.  The difference between the student playing of pieces and the teacher is interestingly different.  And the concert performances do make sense.  However, this is not so much a movie about classical music as using classical music to tell its real story.",5,A movie about transitions and choices that uses classical music as the vehicle,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,3849,"['appreciate', 'film', 'more', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'generally', 'available', 'especially', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'great', 'vehicle', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'more', 'just', 'showcase', 'story', 'transitions', 'being', 'worlds', 'finding', 'one', 'way', 'being', 'defined', 'others', 'ostensible', 'point', 'story', 'art', 'playing', 'classical', 'piano.Madame', 'Sousatzka', 'MacLaine', 'older', 'famous', 'piano', 'teacher', 'known', 'authoritarian', 'well', 'old', 'fashioned', 'ways', 'However', 'students', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'play', 'problem', 'tend', 'leave', 'course', 'one', 'thing', 'piano', 'teachers', 'teachers', 'know', 'when', 'student', 'relationship', 'will', 'point', 'come', 'end', 'student', 'off', 'own', 'path', 'reality', 'great', 'teacher', 'very', 'best', 'ones', 'teach', 'students', 'become', 'independent', 'able', 'learn', 'work', 'own', 'However', 'teaching', 'piano', 'still', 'older', 'style', 'master', 'student', 'intimacy', 'when', 'student', 'master', 'ready', 'student', 'rejected', 'master', 'well', 'terrible', 'hurts', 'are', 'unavoidable.Madame', 'rigidity', 'demanding', 'demeanor', 'come', 'own', 'training', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'even', 'greater', 'concert', 'artist', 'studio', 'dominated', 'large', 'portrait', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'Sousatzka', 'flows', 'relationship', 'mother', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'healthy', 'teacher', 'daughter', 'movie', 'learn', 'terrible', 'source', 'pain', 'fear', 'still', 'Madame', 'present', 'time', 'movie', 'paralyzed', 'much', 'life', 'even', 'Madame', 'still', 'mother', 'more', 'Sousatzka', 'transitions', 'are', 'past', 'world', 'dying', 'place', 'present', 'question', 'can', 'ever', 'get', 'free', 'mother', 'own', 'painful', 'memories.The', 'student', 'movie', 'Manek', 'Sen', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'Navin', 'Chowdhry', 'brilliantly', 'talented', 'boy', 'immigrant', 'family', 'own', 'domination', 'problems', 'own', 'mother', 'then', 'domineering', 'student-teacher', 'relationship', 'Sousatzka', 'pressures', 'mother', 'who', 'constantly', 'know', 'sacrifices', 'working', 'selling', 'jewelry', 'get', 'training', 'be', 'taken', 'care', 'Manek', ""n't"", 'like', 'man', 'taken', 'up', 'use', 'gifts', 'provide', 'father', 'died', 'musical', 'prodigies', 'make', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'also', 'being', 'pursued', 'agent', 'who', 'get', 'stage', 'agent', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'teacher', 'Manek', 'also', 'terrible', 'pressures', 'own', 'Indian', 'culture', 'European', 'culture', 'living', 'music', 'learning', 'play', 'Sousatzka', 'trying', 'remake', 'European', 'can', 'play', 'music', 'more', 'completely', 'mother', 'change', 'own', 'desires', 'keep', 'boy', 'close', 'her.Madame', 'dead', 'set', 'going', 'stage', 'early', 'own', 'painful', 'experience', 'holding', 'back', 'stage', 'what', 'students', 'leave', 'want', 'play', 'spare', 'pain', 'failing', 'stage', 'ever', 'explaining', 'it.Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'share', 'how', 'together', 'ending', 'movie', 'have', 'transitions', 'made', 'not', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'neatly', 'However', 'know', 'more', 'where', 'everyone', 'going', 'understand', 'why.As', 'playing', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'difference', 'student', 'playing', 'pieces', 'teacher', 'interestingly', 'different', 'concert', 'performances', 'do', 'make', 'sense', 'However', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'classical', 'music', 'using', 'classical', 'music', 'tell', 'real', 'story']",Madame Sousatzka VHS

Director John Schlesinger was probably too grim a filmmaker for such material; with the exception of a remarkable final shot of a neighborhood in transition, Schlesinger's touches are too heavy (he's hardly the filmmaker to find whimsy in any scenario).

Shirley MacLaine is extraordinary in the role of an aged concert pianist coach.  Her eccentricity, makes for such an endearing performance.  Her dedication to her craft and students.The young boy Manik, (studying to be a concert pianist with Sousatzka)  represents the new.. the young the hip. The disjunct between the characters is interesting.The music is glorious, mainly the composers: Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann.Twiggy's character as a pseudo-talented pop singer as a quirky dimension to the plot.What is funny and would never happen to a concert pianist in real life:The scene where Soutsatza flashes back to her debut performance where she completely forgets the music and storms off the stage in romantic fervor drama LOL  So high camp.  That would never happen to a concert pianist in real life. Concert pianist are so well programmed in memorization of the music that even if there was a memory lapse, they would fake it to the end or end it quickly with some logical musical cadence. Never would they just stop playing.I am just so annoyed and a bit insulted that this movie is not on dvd (with extras!!!).... It is Shirley's best work next to Sweet Charity.This movie has extraordinary heart and is a beautiful look into the lives of piano coaches. As a concert pianist and coach myself..

The western side is taken by a (Russian?) piano teacher, living in London (masterfully played by a magnificent Shirley MacLaine) and the Eastern is represented by a would-beand reticent Hindi piano student.Not only does Schlesinger tell us the story of the two and their passions and strives in life, but also gives us a whole palette of undertones in quite different social worlds.Despite its length (slightly over two hours) the movie has never a dull moment or a static conversation. Emotions are fully and honestly expressed by all involved and never for a moment, one can feel he is watching a movie here.Quite the contrary. All the characters play their parts so much to the hilt, that it ""sucks"" us in and doesn't let loose until the end credits roll.I am not an emotional person generally, and many ""tearjerkers"" only make me crack up, so academic they are, but when I watched this movie for the first time in New York City at the Carnegie Odeon Movie Theater, I must admit I came out in tears and had to make an effort not to be noticed for that.Not that it is particularly sad, quite the contrary. Despite some very dramatic moments, it is truly a wonderful comedy.No the sadness comes out from the realism contained in the lives of the characters, in which we all could find similarities.The dreams, the passions, the disappointments, the crime and punishment and finally, the absolute redemption are all very important factors in this excellent movie.The music world is only a mask to show us a much deeper view on society as such. But the film is conducted by Schlesinger (the old fox) as an orchestra conductor, directing a symphony by Beethoven.His baton is light but never loses out on a note. His conducting is comparable to the mastery of Herbert von Karajan. The only difference is that he waltzes with a camera.If you want to discover a different movie from the same-o, same-o, then this is an absolute must see.I personally laughed, cried, got concerned and was worried, was uncomfortable, then immediately relieved by pleasant surprises throughout the entire movie, but above all, it made me think about the similarities with my own world and this is probably why I learned to love this tiny masterpiece.I just own the VHS version, but would like to plea the producers of the movie (Universal was the distributor, but the movie was a Cineplex/Odeon production) and all those who are involved in DVD production to finally decide to release a pristine copy, with a decent digital sound and a crisp image.Of all the movies around, this one surely would merit an extra effort to digitalize it and therefore preserve it for posterity.I can only recommend it. This movie is for all, although some scenes may be a bit difficult to understand by younger audiences, without an adult presence. But in reality, this is a naive suggestion, since it has to be watched by the entire family on a quiet movie evening around the living room.You need some concentration though, to watch it. It is not a popcorn and beer movie. This is a movie for those who love to think.",5,5 1/2 stars for a wonderful movie from the heart...,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,3572,"['John', 'Schlesinger', 'became', 'famous', 'polemic', 'very', 'socially', 'oriented', 'director', 'Masterpiece', 'times.It', 'not', 'monumental', 'movie', 'not', 'box-office', 'smashing', 'hit.No', 'far', 'superior', 'work', 'artistry', 'worked', 'reworked', 'guts', 'heart.The', 'story', 'very', 'skillfully', 'developed', 'plot', 'twists', 'classical', 'masterpieces', 'interpreted', 'movie.Yes', 'tale', 'two', 'cultures', 'Western', 'Eastern', 'western', 'side', 'taken', 'Russian', 'piano', 'teacher', 'living', 'London', 'masterfully', 'played', 'magnificent', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Eastern', 'represented', 'would-beand', 'reticent', 'Hindi', 'piano', 'student.Not', 'only', 'Schlesinger', 'tell', 'story', 'two', 'passions', 'strives', 'life', 'also', 'whole', 'palette', 'undertones', 'quite', 'different', 'social', 'worlds.Despite', 'length', 'slightly', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'static', 'conversation', 'Emotions', 'are', 'fully', 'honestly', 'expressed', 'involved', 'never', 'moment', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'watching', 'movie', 'contrary', 'characters', 'play', 'parts', 'so', 'much', 'hilt', 'sucks', ""n't"", 'let', 'loose', 'end', 'roll.I', 'am', 'not', 'emotional', 'person', 'generally', 'many', 'tearjerkers', 'only', 'make', 'crack', 'up', 'so', 'academic', 'are', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Carnegie', 'Odeon', 'Movie', 'Theater', 'must', 'admit', 'came', 'out', 'tears', 'had', 'make', 'effort', 'not', 'be', 'noticed', 'that.Not', 'particularly', 'sad', 'contrary', 'very', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'comedy.No', 'sadness', 'out', 'realism', 'contained', 'lives', 'characters', 'could', 'find', 'similarities.The', 'dreams', 'passions', 'disappointments', 'crime', 'punishment', 'finally', 'absolute', 'redemption', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'factors', 'excellent', 'movie.The', 'music', 'world', 'only', 'mask', 'show', 'much', 'deeper', 'view', 'society', 'such', 'film', 'conducted', 'Schlesinger', 'old', 'fox', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'directing', 'symphony', 'Beethoven.His', 'baton', 'light', 'never', 'out', 'note', 'conducting', 'comparable', 'mastery', 'Herbert', 'von', 'Karajan', 'only', 'difference', 'camera.If', 'want', 'discover', 'different', 'movie', 'same-o', 'same-o', 'then', 'absolute', 'must', 'see.I', 'personally', 'laughed', 'cried', 'got', 'concerned', 'was', 'worried', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'then', 'immediately', 'relieved', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'entire', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'similarities', 'own', 'world', 'probably', 'why', 'learned', 'love', 'tiny', 'masterpiece.I', 'just', 'own', 'VHS', 'version', 'would', 'like', 'plea', 'producers', 'movie', 'Universal', 'was', 'distributor', 'movie', 'was', 'Cineplex/Odeon', 'production', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'DVD', 'production', 'finally', 'decide', 'release', 'pristine', 'copy', 'decent', 'digital', 'sound', 'crisp', 'image.Of', 'movies', 'one', 'surely', 'would', 'merit', 'extra', 'effort', 'digitalize', 'therefore', 'preserve', 'posterity.I', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'difficult', 'understand', 'younger', 'audiences', 'adult', 'presence', 'reality', 'naive', 'suggestion', 'be', 'watched', 'entire', 'family', 'quiet', 'movie', 'evening', 'living', 'room.You', 'need', 'concentration', 'watch', 'not', 'popcorn', 'beer', 'movie', 'movie', 'who', 'love', 'think']",Madame Sousatzka VHS
492901,A1QFYQCLBFCHIA,B000005XXD,"PuppyTalk ""BlackMutt""","[7, 8]","It is one beautiful movie I've ever watched.  The movie deals with so many issues: clash of western/eastern cultures, a 13-year-old boy going through the pain of growing, society problems in England -- the tenants are chased out of their apartment because someone thinks the apartment needs to be torn down, an old man being mugged by young boys, etc.  There are class issues as well.  And the boy, the piano student, is being pulled toward pre-mature success, against his teacher's will, because his single mother has lost her job and they have no other means to survive.  The clash between the mother and his teacher (played by Shirley MacLane) is pretty real and funny too.  Two women compete each other to mother him, and he is at the age he wants to be independent.  He's also attracted to a woman who lives in the same apartment as his teacher.All these issues are finely woven, and you will see the real lives of all who are involved.  Obstacles are everywhere, but regardless of what happens, the boy cannot stop from growing and he moves on.Wonderful, wonderful movie.

492902,A1GR80XMMIG5T8,B000005XXD,Redmond Geek,"[4, 15]","""Madame Sousatzka"" is the story of Manek, a sixteen year old boy with a prodigious musical talent, and the three older women who try to use him in various ways for their own gratification.First there is Mme Sousatzka herself, a grandmotherly Russian piano teacher with a failed concert career and a history of forming inappropriate relationships with her under-aged male students. Throughout the film, she is constantly primping and trying to make herself physically attractive to Manek. She also showers him with gifts of clothing, tries to control his relationships with other people (particularly women), and throws jealous tantrums when he doesn't pay enough attention to her.Then there is Manek's mother, whose principal goal is to turn Manek into a well-paid concert performer so that she can live the life she thinks she deserves. The development of his talent is simply a means to an end for her. Like Mme Sousatzka, she also exhibits jealousy when Manek tries to form relationships with other people, and she uses the same kind of baby-doll seductiveness toward him that she displays toward her boyfriends.Finally, there is Jenny, a pop-star wannabe approaching middle age, who recognizes in Manek's talent something that she will never achieve. Seeing that Manek has a crush on her, she decides to have sex with him -- primarily to drive away her own sense of failure.Many reviewers see this film as some kind of ""coming of age"" saga. It's not. It's about three older women who violate a young boy's trust by having various kinds of inappropriate relationships with him, when they ought to know better. In the long run, this is going to cause Manek to devalue himself and have trouble forming normal relationships.If you doubt this appraisal, just flip the characters' genders and see how the story sounds:* ""Monsieur Sousatzka"" is an aging (male) piano teacher who has romantic designs on a sixteen year old girl student.* The girl's father makes veiled sexual suggestions to the girl as a way of getting her to do what he wants.* Sousatzka's upstairs neighbor is a middle-aged pop singer who sees that the girl has a crush on him, and seduces her to gratify his own ego.Suddenly not such a ""coming of age"" story, is it? More like child abuse. Our culture doesn't tolerate this kind of thing when the perpetrators are men, but for the most part turns a blind eye when the perps are older women and the victims are male.This is a creepy film. Even creepier because it ends with one of Mme Sousatzka's former boy students bringing a new young man to study with her. The cycle of abuse continues with a new victim...",1,A Deeply Creepy Film about Child Abuse,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,2624,"['Madame', 'Sousatzka', 'story', 'Manek', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'prodigious', 'musical', 'talent', 'three', 'older', 'women', 'who', 'try', 'use', 'various', 'ways', 'own', 'gratification.First', 'Mme', 'Sousatzka', 'grandmotherly', 'Russian', 'piano', 'teacher', 'failed', 'concert', 'career', 'history', 'forming', 'inappropriate', 'relationships', 'under-aged', 'male', 'students', 'film', 'constantly', 'primping', 'trying', 'make', 'physically', 'attractive', 'Manek', 'also', 'gifts', 'clothing', 'control', 'relationships', 'other', 'people', 'particularly', 'women', 'jealous', 'tantrums', 'when', ""n't"", 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'her.Then', 'Manek', 'mother', 'principal', 'goal', 'turn', 'Manek', 'well-paid', 'concert', 'performer', 'can', 'live', 'life', 'development', 'talent', 'simply', 'means', 'end', 'Mme', 'Sousatzka', 'also', 'jealousy', 'when', 'Manek', 'form', 'relationships', 'other', 'people', 'same', 'kind', 'baby-doll', 'seductiveness', 'boyfriends.Finally', 'Jenny', 'pop-star', 'wannabe', 'approaching', 'middle', 'age', 'who', 'Manek', 'talent', 'something', 'will', 'never', 'achieve', 'Seeing', 'Manek', 'crush', 'have', 'sex', 'primarily', 'drive', 'away', 'own', 'sense', 'failure.Many', 'reviewers', 'see', 'film', 'kind', 'coming', 'age', 'saga', 'not', 'three', 'older', 'women', 'who', 'violate', 'young', 'boy', 'trust', 'having', 'various', 'kinds', 'inappropriate', 'relationships', 'when', 'ought', 'know', 'better', 'long', 'run', 'going', 'cause', 'Manek', 'devalue', 'have', 'trouble', 'forming', 'normal', 'relationships.If', 'doubt', 'appraisal', 'just', 'flip', 'characters', 'genders', 'see', 'how', 'story', '*', 'Monsieur', 'Sousatzka', 'aging', 'male', 'piano', 'teacher', 'who', 'romantic', 'designs', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'student', '*', 'girl', 'father', 'veiled', 'sexual', 'suggestions', 'girl', 'way', 'getting', 'do', 'what', '*', 'Sousatzka', 'upstairs', 'neighbor', 'middle-aged', 'pop', 'singer', 'who', 'girl', 'crush', 'gratify', 'own', 'ego.Suddenly', 'not', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'More', 'child', 'abuse', 'culture', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'kind', 'thing', 'when', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'men', 'most', 'part', 'blind', 'eye', 'when', 'perps', 'are', 'older', 'women', 'victims', 'are', 'male.This', 'creepy', 'film', 'Even', 'creepier', 'one', 'Mme', 'Sousatzka', 'former', 'boy', 'students', 'bringing', 'new', 'young', 'man', 'study', 'cycle', 'abuse', 'new', 'victim']",Madame Sousatzka VHS
492903,AXHCIHVT92GYF,B000005XXD,The CinemaScope Cat,"[0, 0]","A 15 year old Indian piano prodigy (Navin Chowdhry) is taken under the wing of the great piano teacher Madame Sousatzka (Shirley MacLaine). It's not long before Sousatzka clashes with the lad's mother (Shabana Azmi) who is eager for the boy to start playing concerts before the teacher thinks he's ready. It doesn't help when a promoter (Leigh Lawson) attempts to lure the young man away from his teacher and enter the commercial world. While the story (based on the novel by Bernice Rubens) isn't particularly original, the screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (HOWARDS END) provides a solid framework for MacLaine's terrific performance, one of her very best. MacLaine's Sousatzka is one of those brilliant monsters for whom Art (in this case, music) takes precedence over everything, investing her very heart and soul into the ""children"" she creates even as her heart gets broken every time. She's surrounded by a colorful company of assorted characters played by Peggy Ashcroft, Twiggy, Geoffrey Bayldon and Sam Howard. The capable direction is by John Schlesinger and while the film is far removed from his superb work in the 1960s and 1970s, it's still a solid example of good craftsmanship.The region 2 Network DVD is a decent full frame transfer.",4,A memorable performance by Shirley MacLaine,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,1252,"['15', 'year', 'old', 'Indian', 'piano', 'prodigy', 'Navin', 'Chowdhry', 'taken', 'wing', 'great', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Madame', 'Sousatzka', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Sousatzka', 'clashes', 'lad', 'mother', 'Shabana', 'Azmi', 'who', 'eager', 'boy', 'start', 'playing', 'concerts', 'teacher', 'ready', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'promoter', 'Leigh', 'Lawson', 'lure', 'young', 'man', 'away', 'teacher', 'enter', 'commercial', 'world', 'story', 'based', 'novel', 'Bernice', 'Rubens', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Ruth', 'Prawer', 'Jhabvala', 'HOWARDS', 'END', 'solid', 'framework', 'MacLaine', 'terrific', 'performance', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'MacLaine', 'Sousatzka', 'one', 'brilliant', 'monsters', 'whom', 'Art', 'case', 'music', 'precedence', 'everything', 'investing', 'very', 'heart', 'soul', 'children', 'even', 'heart', 'broken', 'time', 'surrounded', 'colorful', 'company', 'assorted', 'characters', 'played', 'Peggy', 'Ashcroft', 'Twiggy', 'Geoffrey', 'Bayldon', 'Sam', 'Howard', 'capable', 'direction', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'film', 'far', 'removed', 'superb', 'work', '1960s', '1970s', 'still', 'solid', 'example', 'good', 'craftsmanship.The', 'region', '2', 'Network', 'DVD', 'decent', 'full', 'frame', 'transfer']",Madame Sousatzka VHS
