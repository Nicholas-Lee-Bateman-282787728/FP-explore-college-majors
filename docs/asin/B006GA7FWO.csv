However, there's a bit of drama in the midst of it because a fun-loving irresponsible sexy guy neglects to take a romantic relationship serious.Life goes sort of topsy-turvy on him, as well as on others involved.

1514932,A3APW42N5MRVWT,B006GA7FWO,"Michael Harbour ""mharbour""","[1, 1]","A fun Bollywood movie with some Romantic Comedy and some Family Drama and quite a bit of dancing. None of the dance numbers are spectacular, but are often creatively staged and costumed and (appropriately as the movie is set in London) include quite a diversity of looks among the dancers. The singing, however, is so heavily auto-tuned that the vocals might as well have been created with a synthesizer. The movie builds momentum slowly and certainly isn't one I would highly recommend, but it is a reasonable diversion and isn't one to avoid, either.",3,Bollywood comedy set in London,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,552,"['fun', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Drama', 'quite', 'bit', 'dancing', 'None', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'spectacular', 'are', 'often', 'creatively', 'staged', 'costumed', 'appropriately', 'movie', 'set', 'London', 'include', 'diversity', 'looks', 'dancers', 'singing', 'however', 'so', 'heavily', 'auto-tuned', 'vocals', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'synthesizer', 'movie', 'momentum', 'slowly', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'one', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reasonable', 'diversion', ""n't"", 'one', 'avoid']",Desi Boyz
1514933,A2DVD7FH0TEVX2,B006GA7FWO,Salil Kapoor,"[1, 2]","Lets recreate the ""behind the scenes"" politicking first. The very fact that Deepika Padukone could make it as a heroine and that too by debuting in an SRK production points at her uncomparable politicking abilities. It is evident that she must have been arriving at the sets with scissors in hands to chop off as much footage of Chitrangada's that her ""netagiri"" and her beau's ""businessgi...ri"" could have afforded. Mudai laakh bura chahe to kya hota, wohi hota hai jo manzoor-e-glamour-khuda hota hai. Chitrangda has uncomparable sex appeal, class and mischeviousness which no scissors can chop off, ""hard luck Deepika - eh!!!!""Coming to the movie. It is short and sweet. A few scenes are hilarious. Akshay is more of Tom the cat than he is Jerry and John is, well, John is always John. John is India's Keanu Reeves, someone who looks and acts the same no matter what character he is trying to enact.The movie is good fun. The music is unique and foot tapping. Everyone (Deepika NOT included) looks very good, especially Chitrangada (ooooo la la). There is a smile on one's face from start to end. And for any movie to be able to do that for the over-stressed, over-frsutrated Indian audiences, is a big achievement.

1514934,A2PYVDMK17QV35,B006GA7FWO,TLW,"[1, 1]",I thought this movie was going to be good because it has Akshay Kumar and John Abraham. No! I did not see the wow! factor in this at all. Two sexy men in a dull film. I ended up giving this movie to my mom because she is a huge Akshay and John fan. I was too until I watched this film. Hopefully when these two act together in a film in the future it won't suck like this film did. What a waste of my money and two hours of my like I will never get back.,1,Desi Boyz,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,454,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'Akshay', 'Kumar', 'John', 'Abraham', 'No', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'wow', 'factor', 'Two', 'sexy', 'men', 'dull', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'movie', 'mom', 'huge', 'Akshay', 'John', 'fan', 'was', 'too', 'watched', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'when', 'two', 'act', 'together', 'film', 'future', 'wo', ""n't"", 'suck', 'film', 'did', 'What', 'waste', 'money', 'two', 'hours', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back']",Desi Boyz
1514935,AOUFNKPTMAIHO,B006GA7FWO,vent,"[1, 1]","I usually don't go for the show me the beef cake movies but this one not only goes for the beef cake it goes for the laughs and the heart.  This movie is a lot of fun period . Similar to the HEART of, but none of the content of the Full Monty. No nudity or embarrassing practice sessions. The dance scenes are energetic, fun and tastefully done. none of that pulling off the garter crap or cheap dollar bill in the thank God non-existent gstring. None of that . This movie is done with a light touch so you don't feel embarrassed for them doing a job they wouldn't normally choose for themselves.  This is very tongue in cheek style.  They just come across as making sure everyone is having a good time in playfully designed sets and costume fantasy , fireman, motorcycles etc., and you're invited for the fun and the very spectacular dancing. The writer/director makes sure we as the audience are included.The story grows forward with the characters as they aren't as desperate anymore and the bills are being paid up to date , John Abrahams character Hunter decides to stop doing this , and tells Akshay( Rocco)But right before he can retire his fiance catches a Youtube video her friends are looking at and it's her fiance in living color  (actually fun one on youtube for real). Big fight and it spills onto Jerry who is told to get out and grow up.  When she walks away from him he is forced into conferring with her father on how to get her back. Very funny times ahead on that plot line.Next up the maturation of Jerry(rocco) . When he is thrown out and his nephew taken from his custody he launches a desperate plan to go back to college and finish his last semester and get his ""son"" out of foster care.  Living in a dorm and surrounded by dead head slackers he begins to grow up and is confronted by a girl who had a crush on him when he was there before . She has lost weight and become a professor. When he has trouble with her class she launches a sexy and funny campaign to help his heart and mind to succeed . LOVED this fun and very entertaining film. LOTS OF HOT GIRLS FOR THE GUYS TOO. Some extremely funny moments for the job seekers of the world who will feel a definite connection with Jerry (rocco) when he goes to interview now with a degree in hand but no experience. With friend ""Hunter"" at his side giving him wildly crazy, but effective advice he can't fail. Not to be missed.Wrapping it up... John Abraham you are tremendously improved (the courage it took to wear that snow hat lol) . To Akshay Kumar Thank you once again for making our days a little more tolerable , the load is always lighter to carry when you are laughing and smiling or being made to feel you are worth working for. Helps you to keep your eye on the true prizes of life ..friends and family.  Fans you might want to check out his other recent Dramadies ... ""House Full""  ""Patiala House"" ""Namastey London "". Akshay not only knows how to keep us laughing but to keep on loving life and trying even when the odds are stacked against you. Keep Smiling :D",5,DESI BOYZ  review 3/9/2012,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,3050,"['usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'show', 'beef', 'cake', 'movies', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'beef', 'cake', 'laughs', 'heart', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'period', 'Similar', 'HEART', 'none', 'content', 'Full', 'Monty', 'nudity', 'embarrassing', 'practice', 'sessions', 'dance', 'scenes', 'are', 'energetic', 'fun', 'tastefully', 'done', 'none', 'pulling', 'off', 'garter', 'crap', 'cheap', 'dollar', 'bill', 'thank', 'God', 'non-existent', 'gstring', 'None', 'movie', 'done', 'light', 'touch', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'doing', 'job', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'choose', 'very', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'style', 'just', 'come', 'across', 'making', 'sure', 'everyone', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'playfully', 'designed', 'sets', 'costume', 'fantasy', 'fireman', 'motorcycles', 'etc.', ""'re"", 'invited', 'fun', 'very', 'spectacular', 'dancing', 'writer/director', 'sure', 'audience', 'are', 'included.The', 'story', 'forward', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'desperate', 'anymore', 'bills', 'are', 'being', 'paid', 'up', 'date', 'John', 'Abrahams', 'character', 'Hunter', 'stop', 'doing', 'tells', 'Akshay', 'Rocco', 'right', 'can', 'retire', 'fiance', 'Youtube', 'video', 'friends', 'are', 'looking', 'fiance', 'living', 'color', 'actually', 'one', 'youtube', 'real', 'Big', 'fight', 'Jerry', 'who', 'told', 'get', 'out', 'grow', 'up', 'When', 'walks', 'away', 'forced', 'conferring', 'father', 'how', 'get', 'back', 'Very', 'funny', 'times', 'ahead', 'plot', 'up', 'maturation', 'Jerry', 'rocco', 'When', 'thrown', 'out', 'nephew', 'taken', 'custody', 'desperate', 'plan', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'finish', 'last', 'semester', 'get', 'son', 'foster', 'care', 'Living', 'dorm', 'surrounded', 'dead', 'head', 'slackers', 'grow', 'up', 'confronted', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'crush', 'when', 'was', 'there', 'before', 'lost', 'weight', 'become', 'professor', 'When', 'trouble', 'class', 'sexy', 'funny', 'campaign', 'help', 'heart', 'mind', 'succeed', 'LOVED', 'fun', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'LOTS', 'OF', 'HOT', 'GIRLS', 'THE', 'GUYS', 'TOO', 'extremely', 'funny', 'moments', 'job', 'seekers', 'world', 'who', 'will', 'feel', 'definite', 'connection', 'Jerry', 'rocco', 'when', 'interview', 'now', 'degree', 'hand', 'experience', 'friend', 'Hunter', 'side', 'giving', 'wildly', 'crazy', 'effective', 'advice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fail', 'Not', 'be', 'missed.Wrapping', 'up', 'John', 'Abraham', 'are', 'tremendously', 'improved', 'courage', 'took', 'wear', 'snow', 'lol', 'Akshay', 'Kumar', 'Thank', 'once', 'again', 'making', 'days', 'little', 'more', 'tolerable', 'load', 'always', 'lighter', 'carry', 'when', 'are', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'being', 'made', 'feel', 'are', 'worth', 'working', 'Helps', 'keep', 'eye', 'true', 'prizes', 'life', '..friends', 'family', 'Fans', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'recent', 'Dramadies', 'House', 'Full', 'Patiala', 'House', 'Namastey', 'London', 'Akshay', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'keep', 'laughing', 'keep', 'loving', 'life', 'trying', 'even', 'when', 'odds', 'are', 'stacked', 'Keep', 'Smiling', 'D']",Desi Boyz
