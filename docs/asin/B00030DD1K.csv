The focus of this series is on two words: Love and Respect. While our culture belives in unconditional love, it often doesn't believe unconditional respect is important. Women crave unconditional love and men crave unconditional respect. Our minds were wired by God to be different. We were created in the image of God as male and female. Our sexes think about things differently-""not wrong, just different.""Dr. Emerson Eggerichs describes the two sexes as wearing different headphones and glasses. Men wear blue glasses and blue headphones. Women wear pink glasses and pink headphones. A man might say to his wife, ""I have nothing to wear!"" A wife might say the same words and mean she has nothing ""new."" A man, on the other hand, might mean he has nothing ""clean."" As Dr. Emerson says repeatedly, ""Not wrong, just different.""I do find the ""Love and Respect"" DVD is an excellent marriage resource. I haven't finished watching all of the DVDs yet, but what I have watched thus far is awesome.  Dr. Eggerichs really is a great presenter, has done lots of research, and most importantly, validates all things he talks about with the word of God.  If Christians would look to the Bible for the answers to life, we wouldn't have so many problems.  Eggerichs uses examples from the Old and New Testament to speak about love and respect.  Whatever people want to believe, the fact is, men and women are different.  We were created by God to have different roles in the marriage.I would give this dvd series over 5 stars if I could; it's that good.  Any couple desiring marriage should watch this series.  Any couple that is married should watch this series too.  Marriage must become the sacred institution it once was.  I'm really thankful Dr. Eggerichs presents uncorrupted biblical truths in this day and age.",5,This material should be required before marriage,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1929,"['50', '%', 'Christian', 'marriages', 'are', 'failing', 'Christian', 'population', 'doing', 'miserable', 'job', 'following', 'God', 'word', 'focus', 'series', 'two', 'words', 'Love', 'Respect', 'culture', 'unconditional', 'love', 'often', ""n't"", 'believe', 'unconditional', 'respect', 'important', 'Women', 'crave', 'unconditional', 'love', 'men', 'crave', 'unconditional', 'respect', 'minds', 'were', 'wired', 'God', 'be', 'different', 'were', 'created', 'image', 'God', 'male', 'female', 'sexes', 'think', 'things', 'differently-', 'not', 'wrong', 'just', 'different.', 'Dr', 'Emerson', 'Eggerichs', 'two', 'sexes', 'wearing', 'different', 'headphones', 'glasses', 'Men', 'blue', 'glasses', 'blue', 'headphones', 'Women', 'wear', 'pink', 'glasses', 'pink', 'headphones', 'man', 'might', 'say', 'wife', 'have', 'nothing', 'wear', 'wife', 'might', 'say', 'same', 'words', 'mean', 'nothing', 'new', 'man', 'other', 'hand', 'might', 'mean', 'nothing', 'clean', 'Dr.', 'Emerson', 'repeatedly', 'Not', 'wrong', 'just', 'different', 'do', 'find', 'Love', 'Respect', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'marriage', 'resource', 'have', ""n't"", 'finished', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'yet', 'what', 'have', 'watched', 'thus', 'far', 'awesome', 'Dr.', 'Eggerichs', 'really', 'great', 'presenter', 'done', 'lots', 'research', 'most', 'importantly', 'things', 'word', 'God', 'Christians', 'would', 'look', 'Bible', 'answers', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'Eggerichs', 'examples', 'Old', 'New', 'Testament', 'speak', 'love', 'respect', 'people', 'want', 'believe', 'fact', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'different', 'were', 'created', 'God', 'have', 'different', 'roles', 'marriage.I', 'would', 'give', 'dvd', 'series', '5', 'stars', 'could', 'good', 'Any', 'couple', 'desiring', 'marriage', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'Any', 'couple', 'married', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'too', 'Marriage', 'must', 'become', 'sacred', 'institution', 'once', 'was', ""'m"", 'really', 'thankful', 'Dr.', 'Eggerichs', 'presents', 'uncorrupted', 'biblical', 'truths', 'day', 'age']",Love and Respect Live Marriage Conference

I've taught an in-depth Biblical marriage course twice. We've gone through some rough times. Very rough. The last decade of marriage has finally been one of growth and communication.That said...the Love and Respect course has recently taught us much. You'd think there wouldn't be moments of severe cluelessness after all the years and stuff we've gone through. Ha!This concept is so simple. But it's not a band-aid.If you can afford it, if YOU want to do what you can to help your marriage - then buy this set.I haven't read the book, but I know there is one available, as well as an audio version that would be cheaper. Way less expensive than a session with a counselor, or another steak dinner filled with arguing and strife.This study is down-to-earth, even non-threatening. But it is convicting. If you aren't willing to make the changes you need to enrich your marriage, then don't buy this.

It points out some of those vicious cycles we married couples sometimes get into, and sometimes it makes you really laugh at how silly we can be!
