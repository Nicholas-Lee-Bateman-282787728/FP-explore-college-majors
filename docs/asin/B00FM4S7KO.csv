He&#8217;s not only in but also the center of nearly all of your motion comics lately.  And they&#8217;ve not been good.  While the animators have out done themselves, they&#8217;re getting better and better, the stories have gotten so dull.  After THOR and LOKI, nearly all of them center on Logan.  The only time that really turned out to be a good thing was HULK vs Wolverine, which was GREAT.  I see you have ETERNALS coming, and I look forward to it.  Thanks for that.  I&#8217;d still LOVE to see maybe Peter David&#8217;s MADROX mini series that lead to X-FACTOR.  Or Greg Rucka&#8217;s PUNISHER.  Or ANYTHING from Majorie Liu.  Her X-23 run would be amazing and hey!  Logan is in it!Also, please lay off Paul Cornell.  He&#8217;s a strong writer, but these adaptions haven&#8217;t made that case.  InHumans didn&#8217;t work.  Logan&#8217;s ORIGINS def didn&#8217;t work.How about some more stories like IRON MAN: Extremis?  Or the SPIDER-MAN one.  That was great.  The Whedon X-MEN motion comics were solid.I LOVE motion comics.  Just not this one.",2,I LOVE motion comics.

Needless to say, their at the forefront when it comes to this exciting, fairly new medium that's sure to replace the printed comic form in the future. Personally I wish DC Entertainment would step up to the plate & give Marvel some healthy competition since DC has a few motion comic releases under their belt but not nearly as many as Marvel Knights. Anyways, this comes as close to a comic book adaption that your ever going to get other than besides reading the stories panel for panel at your own leisure.

This means it's the artwork from the page cut out and given movement.  It doesn't look amazing by any stretch of the word but it's the closet you will get to the comic in terms of &#34;animation&#34;.With that out of the way this one was fun.  The voice acting is actually pretty good.  Well Wolverine is good, the rest are decent.  They reuse some animation a few times too many but the episodic editing sort of explains that.  Speaking of editing I wish they would cut out the intro and credits on these DVDs because they're unnecessary.As for the story it's fun.  I was surprised Jeph Leob wrote it.  My only complaint is it left a lot of unanswered questions.  It is a comic after all though and the special features sported some scenes from the sequel book so one can assume they plan on finishing it.  While on the subject the interview with the creators was interesting and gave me a new respect for Leob I never had before.I can't say how this plays when you've already read the comic as someone who hasn't it was enjoyable.  The book and this film are the same price so it's up to you which you'd prefer.

I think this is kind of a sequel to the wolverine origin story. I can't believe they finally kill off sabertooth. the most famous rivalry in the marvel universe. but spoiler alert in the special feature they give a hint that sabertooth comes back and shows scenes  in the special feature that's not in the movie. so are they releasing another one a vol. 2. I hope so because they kind of leave you standing and wondering who the heck is romules. I hope they put it out soon. but all in all this is a awesome motion comic. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,5,Wolverine Vs.

While I would not sell it or trade it, it marks the first time I felt so-so about a motion comic from Marvel. The voice acting is done well, and the art retains much of it original form, but standing on the fence of this Marvel Knights production left such a dissatisfied taste in my mouth that I honestly considered not purchasing another one from Marvel. For me, the benchmark for Marvel's motion comics are still Iron Man: Extremis and Spider-Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D.
