Of course I read the review from others before I bought it and should have taken heed to them. I wanted to see this first series because I had never seen it. The  only thing I got out of it was how Will Spanner came about. He is the main character in other witchcraft series. I would not had lost much by not seeing this film but I did get to see how it all started.",2,Not what I expected,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,483,"['thought', 'witchcraft', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'most', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'one', 'course', 'read', 'review', 'others', 'bought', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'heed', 'wanted', 'see', 'first', 'series', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'was', 'how', 'Will', 'Spanner', 'came', 'about', 'main', 'character', 'other', 'witchcraft', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'had', 'lost', 'much', 'not', 'seeing', 'film', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'started']",N/A

And because I am on a tight budget 97 cents seemed like a steal to me.  After I watched it I found out why it cost so little.  The story unfolds as two witches are burned at the stake over 9000 years ago.  And then fast forward 9000 years later and the witch couple comes back from hell and wants to eat your soul.  Yes 'im serious thats the whole plot.  That's all you're getting from this movie.  The warlock takes his wife and baby to his ""mothers"" house to wreak havoc amongst them and tortures his wife with bad visuals.  LOL.  No need to go on too much from here because the other reviews say it all.  And as for any splatter lets just say any fans of the slasher genre will be very disappointed.  The body count is low,almost everybody lives.  Not to mention a disappointment to 80's horror fans in general.  This movie is epic fail and I promise you will regret buying it.  I know I have,I watched the dvd as a time waster instead of an actual movie.  I don't think I will ever purchase Witchcraft 2.",1,Oh lawd,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,1077,"['bought', 'movie', 'DVD', 'thought', 'looked', 'interesting', 'am', 'tight', 'budget', '97', 'cents', 'seemed', 'steal', 'watched', 'found', 'out', 'why', 'cost', 'so', 'little', 'story', 'unfolds', 'two', 'witches', 'are', 'burned', 'stake', '9000', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'fast', 'forward', '9000', 'years', 'later', 'witch', 'couple', 'back', 'hell', 'eat', 'soul', 'Yes', 'serious', 'thats', 'whole', 'plot', ""'re"", 'getting', 'movie', 'warlock', 'wife', 'baby', 'mothers', 'house', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'wife', 'bad', 'visuals', 'LOL', 'No', 'need', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'other', 'reviews', 'say', 'splatter', 'lets', 'just', 'say', 'fans', 'slasher', 'genre', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'body', 'count', 'low', 'almost', 'everybody', 'lives', 'Not', 'mention', 'disappointment', '80', 'horror', 'fans', 'general', 'movie', 'epic', 'fail', 'promise', 'will', 'regret', 'buying', 'know', 'have', 'watched', 'dvd', 'time', 'waster', 'instead', 'actual', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'purchase', 'Witchcraft', '2']",N/A
430100,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,6304622791,John's Horror Corner,"[3, 3]","After enduring this ""classic"" I was overcome with the urge to flee, as if such future movie experiences were avoidable as a result of previous insufferable misjudgments.  This film was wowingly poor.  Not unimpressive, nor mediocre, but just POOR.  While I have a special place in my heart for most circa-1980's horror series part ones, this little piece of Hell scarred me with boredom.  So, here's why you should take this to heart and NOT EVER WATCH THIS...When you think of a 1980's horror films what pops in your head first?  Gore?  Cheap scares provoked by sudden scene changes and loud sound effects?  Gratuitous nudity?  You'll find none of these things here.  Not only did this movie suffer a complete lack of even remotely eerie scenes, the producers didn't even have the common decency to force some fledgling actress bare her bosom, butt, or scantily clad body.  No kids are doing drugs or having premarital sex either--so, by common law of horror, no one deserves to die in this movie!  (And almost no one does.)The greatest gore effect involves two robed figures hovering over what could only be described as roadkill in a birdbath.  The figures chant some incomprehensible syllables while kneading mashed organs in their hands and then, GASP, putting it in their mouths.  This scene made me tremble no more than when I eat a poorly prepared meatloaf.  The other effects, if we're elevating them to such a name, were limited to sketchy visions through a mirror that was probably meant to feel like a spooky oracle.I suppose I could address the plot.  Scene One, some people are killed.  All the rest of the scenes, those people were somehow reincarnated into a mother and son (though lovers in scene one) who are obsessed with the son's new child.  Why?  Well, clearly that child is a reincarnation of their unborn child when they were burnt at the stake and, is the ""child of the devil"" as well.  Far from compelling.So we have a lame plot festooned with poor attempts at effects, a total absence of scares, some unexplained motives, no nudity (for those of you who care), and an unsatisfying ending.  Though, to the ending's credit, it was no more disappointing than the rest of the movie.  In fact, for the first time during the movie I was happy when it ended.",1,Only Witchcraft could make me watch this again,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,2278,"['enduring', 'classic', 'was', 'overcome', 'urge', 'flee', 'such', 'future', 'movie', 'experiences', 'were', 'avoidable', 'result', 'previous', 'insufferable', 'misjudgments', 'film', 'was', 'wowingly', 'poor', 'Not', 'unimpressive', 'mediocre', 'just', 'POOR', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'most', 'circa-1980', 'horror', 'series', 'part', 'ones', 'little', 'piece', 'Hell', 'scarred', 'boredom', 'So', 'here', 'why', 'should', 'take', 'heart', 'NOT', 'EVER', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'When', 'think', '1980', 'horror', 'what', 'head', 'first', 'Gore', 'Cheap', 'provoked', 'sudden', 'scene', 'changes', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'Gratuitous', 'nudity', ""'ll"", 'find', 'none', 'things', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'suffer', 'complete', 'lack', 'even', 'remotely', 'eerie', 'scenes', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'common', 'decency', 'force', 'fledgling', 'actress', 'bosom', 'butt', 'scantily', 'clad', 'body', 'kids', 'are', 'doing', 'drugs', 'having', 'premarital', 'sex', 'so', 'common', 'law', 'horror', 'one', 'die', 'movie', 'almost', 'one', 'greatest', 'gore', 'effect', 'two', 'robed', 'figures', 'hovering', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'roadkill', 'birdbath', 'figures', 'chant', 'incomprehensible', 'syllables', 'kneading', 'mashed', 'organs', 'hands', 'then', 'GASP', 'putting', 'mouths', 'scene', 'made', 'tremble', 'more', 'when', 'eat', 'poorly', 'prepared', 'meatloaf', 'other', 'effects', ""'re"", 'elevating', 'such', 'name', 'were', 'limited', 'sketchy', 'visions', 'mirror', 'was', 'probably', 'meant', 'feel', 'spooky', 'suppose', 'could', 'address', 'plot', 'Scene', 'One', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'rest', 'scenes', 'people', 'were', 'somehow', 'reincarnated', 'mother', 'son', 'lovers', 'scene', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'obsessed', 'son', 'new', 'child', 'Why', 'Well', 'clearly', 'child', 'reincarnation', 'unborn', 'child', 'when', 'were', 'burnt', 'stake', 'child', 'devil', 'as', 'well', 'Far', 'compelling.So', 'have', 'lame', 'plot', 'festooned', 'poor', 'attempts', 'effects', 'total', 'absence', 'scares', 'unexplained', 'motives', 'nudity', 'who', 'care', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'Though', 'ending', 'credit', 'was', 'more', 'disappointing', 'rest', 'movie', 'fact', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'happy', 'when', 'ended']",N/A
