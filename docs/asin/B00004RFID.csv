Andy Kaufman was simply superb protraying a wrestling heel(bad guy). He knew how to piss the fans off. ""I'm from Hollywood"" is a nice little time capsule of pro wrestling and the antics of Andy Kaufman from the early 80's.Far as the second feature, I totally enjoyed the interaction between Kaufman and ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie. Their non-sensical ramblings were very amusing and had a natural flow to it between the comedian and wrestling manager. I liked the choice of location at a now-defunct restaurant in Los Angeles. It was also nice seeing scenes of the LA streets in the early 80's.Also included is the LA premiere of ""My Breakfast With Blassie"" with an altered looking Andy Kaufman.

549123,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B00004RFID,drqshadow,"[1, 4]","""I'm From Hollywood"" is just about as thorough a synopsis of Kaufman's wrestling career as a 60-minute mockumentary could ever hope to be. It begins on a huge high note, covering Andy's early career via a series of tongue in cheek interviews with big name co-stars and friends, stretching the truth with an anchor in reality a'l Spinal Tap. It's when the subject turns to his exploits in the Memphis wrestling scene, though, that the picture pulls a complete 180. Those celebrity chats quickly disappear, replaced with direct archival footage of the actual matches and promo segments that eventually built to Kaufman's long-term feud with a very young Jerry Lawler. It's great on a sheerly historical sense, but considering this rivalry lasted for well over a year (in regular once-a-week installments) there's a lot of redundancy in the material that could've been cut out. I would've rather seen a continuation of those interviews spliced in with the raw footage to keep the commentary fresh and the pace quick, because this catches a terrible case of the drags around the halfway point that it never quite manages to shake. It's a major disappointment that the producers couldn't secure the rights to Kaufman and Lawler's infamous fight on Letterman, too, which was the real hook of that storyline.",2,Great Subject Fails to Carry a Mediocre Documentary,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,1301,"[""'m"", 'From', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'about', 'synopsis', 'Kaufman', 'wrestling', 'career', '60-minute', 'mockumentary', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'be', 'huge', 'high', 'note', 'covering', 'Andy', 'early', 'career', 'series', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'interviews', 'big', 'name', 'co-stars', 'friends', 'stretching', 'truth', 'anchor', 'reality', 'l', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'when', 'subject', 'exploits', 'Memphis', 'wrestling', 'scene', 'though', 'picture', 'complete', '180', 'celebrity', 'chats', 'quickly', 'disappear', 'replaced', 'direct', 'archival', 'footage', 'actual', 'matches', 'promo', 'segments', 'eventually', 'built', 'Kaufman', 'long-term', 'feud', 'very', 'young', 'Jerry', 'Lawler', 'great', 'sheerly', 'historical', 'sense', 'considering', 'rivalry', 'lasted', 'well', 'year', 'regular', 'once-a-week', 'installments', 'lot', 'redundancy', 'material', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rather', 'seen', 'continuation', 'interviews', 'spliced', 'raw', 'footage', 'keep', 'commentary', 'fresh', 'pace', 'quick', 'terrible', 'case', 'drags', 'halfway', 'point', 'never', 'quite', 'shake', 'major', 'disappointment', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'secure', 'rights', 'Kaufman', 'Lawler', 'infamous', 'fight', 'Letterman', 'too', 'was', 'real', 'hook', 'storyline']",I'm From Hollywood / My Breakfast With Blassie

Kaufman plays a ""bad guy"" wrestler who taunts the viewing audience about how he is a famous Hollywood star who can beat up any woman who dares challenge him in the ring.  He goes to redneck country and insults the viewers, telling them that he is going to teach them about new things, like soap. After he finally meets a male (Jerry Lawlor) in the ring, he ends up in traction.""My Breakfast with Blassie"" is a parody of ""My Dinner with Andre,"" a film that consisted almost entirely of two people having an intellectually stimulating conversation during dinner at an upscale restaurant on Manhattan's Upper West Side.  So here, Kaufman made a film about former wrestler/wrestling manager Freddie Blassie and himself having an anti-intellectual conversation during breakfast at a downscale Los Angeles pancake house. We see Kaufman and Blassie conversing about how they don't like shaking peoples' hands because ""you never know where their hands could've been - They could have just wiped themselves and their finger could have gone through the toilet paper."" In another scene, Blassie rubs the pregnant Thai waitress' belly for good luck, and then, after she walks away, comments, ""That's another one we'll be feeding on welfare.""These two films are highly recommended.

What's harder to believe is that, once again, we were the joke.While  Andy's put-ons and antics were well known from the beginning of his career,  even the seasoned comedy pros and those closest to him thought Andy had  pretty much lost it by the time he climbed into the ring with Jerry Lawler.  When you watch this DVD, you will be amazed as even Robin Williams  proffers that perhaps Andy had finally slipped that thin, vague line he  seemed to tread.This is a well produced DVD.
