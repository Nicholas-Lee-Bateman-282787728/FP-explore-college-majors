1068288,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B000P2A6C0,a gentle sound,"[0, 0]","Man I love this show.Unfortunately I've only seen three of them, one re-run over and over and two others that just knock me off my feet.But that's not a problem anymore, just seeing three shows I mean, because when I get paid, if i don't get laid off of my 27 year teaching career in sunny CA, I can order.And what I ESPECIALLY like is that everything they did was put into the show-with no deleted scenes. I hate DVD's that I have to wade through all these cut scenes wondering if I now know something that went on behind a door I wasn't supposed to sneak up to, put a glass to, and go ahead and listen in, to find out something generally icky or just too much. It usually just leads you to shake your head and know now you know too much through means sideways. If it was supposed to be there wouldn't it be there? I don't know.Anyway this is free of all that confusion. Watch what you missed on HBO. Order today!Now why do I love it? Fair enough. Let me count the ways.... Well firstly the characters are so off, so unlike the boring stick Happy Days unfunny predictable  joke comedy of network TV with reference to the same 15 things a group of smelly/smarmy/smarty track going, cigar chomping, aggressive, dank old ""listen to my ego"" driven comics do in doing re-runs of the first few days of TV ...ah...I like it's ""not that."" Nothing like that. There is almost none of that I like. Almost none. Feel sorry for that kind of comic. Smell like my grandma's suitcases. I may be old but we moved on for a reason. That' isnt to say that they didn't do their thing well-Red Skelton I loved. Once.  I like it is driven by something where it might be about how being poor is a drag, people are very quirky, you bought a 2nd cup for your broken down apartment, went over-draft and now have all the power shut off.... laughs aren't necessarily punches in our face with an 18 minute laugh track.It just has this lovely little musical thing going. These two have an excellent ""folk"" act that translated to this form so well. They crack on themselves, America...characters  and love. It's really funny.It's just funny.Ok....funny...in the way of why I laugh at kids in a classroom, and passing through things in my days, like the absurdity of a bird flying in the room, kids shrieking, inspectors watching you teach ""to the test"" in the first two days, and a child yelling out ""It's only a bird, it isn't a bat or a dinosaur, relax, if it was a pterodactyl we'd be so dead by now.""It's kinda like that. Only with a New Zealand accent, agent, songs that are always insane and a very light feel.I want to order both seasons, man I hope it's renewed. I think the show is brilliant. I'm actually ordering to watch at work, after my class is long home sure, and I'm working late or weekends and want to watch something but do not want to forget to laugh about it all. Someone called me boring today based on some 5 minute writing, adding I was like Palin's script writer, so that's enough ....if you want the comedy done a little differently you'll be into this.

Think a musical version of ""The Office.""Folk-pop group Flight of the Conchords is Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (played by themselves), who came all the way from New Zealand to New York. They are being managed by the ineffectual New Zealand Consulate official Murray (Rhys Darby), and they have exactly one fan/stalker, Mel (Kristen Schaal). They don't have many gigs, and even fewer successful ones.As they chase elusive fame'n'fortune, the guys have to deal with girlfriend woes (dating the same girl, a ""Yoko"", a girl who just wants to use Bret for sex), Bret getting a job, muggings, body image problems, anti-Kiwi racism, a problematic band rock'n'roll tour, two new fans with impure intentions, a semi-professional actor/compulsive liar who makes Murray think they've got a multimillion-dollar deal, and a bongo player who threatens to divide the band.If I had to come up with a description for ""Flight of the Conchords,"" it would be that they're the folky New Zealand love child of Spinal Tap and ""The Office."" No laugh track, rambling dialogue, and the main characters tend to spontaneously break into song-and-dance at pivotal parts of the plot. And it's brilliant.The writing is brimming over with effortless weirdness, as the guys encounter everyday problems (threesomes, girlfriend woes, racism) which soon turn into hilariously surreal situations (the disturbing children's show, ""Albi the Racist Dragon""). The dialogue is amazing (""She's a pastry chef and a sniper""), and full of rambling conversations that just get stranger with every line (""Have you ever had a threesome?"" ""Nearly."" ""What do you mean, nearly?"" ""I've had a twosome"").The songs are gutsplitting as well, since they're all about homicidal robots, mermaids, hermaphrodites (""Oh you sexy hermaphrodite lady-man-ladies""), and the hiphop-potamus. Not to mention ""Frodo, Don't Wear the Ring"" and its accompanying music video, which are a nod to McKenzie's role as the elf Figwit.But none of this would be even half as funny if it weren't for the actors -- Clement's self-named chatacter is stoic and kind of weird (he writes a song about putting a wig on Bret), while McKenzie's is more childlike, naive and likes to sit in a cardboard box. Darby rounds out the cast as their harried, rather pathetic manager (who isn't even supposed to be managing a band), and Schaal is also quite funny as a woman who has a creepy sexual fixation on the guys.""Flight of the Conchords: The Complete First Season"" is one of the rarest kind of comedy out there -- steady, hysterical, and only gets better with repeated viewings.

Not really.If the show just featured Clement and McKenzie, it'd be good enough but we're lucky to get an amazing supporting cast.

There is plenty of humor to explore in the story's basic plot of two naieve and slightly incompetent Kiwi musicians trying to make it big in NYC...but alas, the same 18 to 25 year old guy jokes and accompanying situations repeat themselves. Every episode. Every episode. The writing becomes complacent, and with it, there is little character development or drive in this show. Ultimately, the viewer ends up waiting for the odd breakout into song, which is the brilliance of Flight of the Conchords. It's hard to care about the two main characters Jemaine and Bret. I'd rather just watch their kitschy, hilarious (and memorable) 3 minute dittys on a variety of inane subjects.The 2 disc set offers no bonus features, and so the band/show's best parts are ignored. Take FOTC for what it's worth and you won't be too disappointed. I just wonder: can these guys go back to New Zealand with their heads held high...or do they sneak back through Aukland anonymously?

Bret McKenzie (ryhmenosaurus) and Jemaine Clement (Hiphoppopotamus) are the two members of this hilarious duo who move to New York in hopes of being discovered. The other regulars on the show are their equally funny band manager Murray who's real job is working at the New Zealand consulate, their one obsessive fan or fan period Mel who is the president, treasurer, and secretary of their fan club, and Dave, Bret and Jemaine's friend and advisorIt's hard to describe how Flight of the Conchords is so funny in the same way it's hard to describe how certain faces Dwight, Jim, Or Pam make to the camera on The Office are funny. There accents and mannerisms alone are hilarious.I'd recommend checking out HBO's website click on Flight of the Conchords and check out the lyrics to some of the songs on different episodes, also funny stuff.I think fans of Seinfeld, The Office, and This is Spinal tap will really enjoy and anyone who gets subtle humor, looking for something fresh.Flight of the Conchords airs Sundays on HBO at 10:30 following Entourage.Episode guide so far.It's already starting to get quoted on Sportscenter.You can also purchase there cd on Amazon as well it is called The Distant Future and has 5 tracks, a full cd will be released early in 2008, only 5$, a good deal, here are the tracks.1.

1068338,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000P2A6C0,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement are two New Zealanders who, together, make up Flight of the Conchords, New Zealand's fourth most popular folk band. In truth though, their music is of the novelty kind that imitates pretty much everything out there, though not all at once and not as blatantly as someone like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic (though he is awesome too!). Their new HBO hit comedy series, which shares the band's name, follows the guys as they try to make it big here in the States. Helped little by well-intentioned New Zealand consulate employee Murray acting as the band's inept manager, naive Bret and desperate Jemaine never seem to have any luck increasing their fanbase beyond one member, the possibly dangerously obsessed Mel, or finding love of any kind to be happy about. The witty banter and awkward situations bring regular laughs throughout the series so far, but the real highlights are undoubtedly the musical numbers. In fact, this is truly a musical TV show. Every episode sees at least two hilarious songs performed as part of the story. Now renewed for a second season, I certainly hope the boys can keep this fantastic show up to the level of its first. The episodes in this complete first season 2-disc DVD set are:Disc 1:Sally: Jemaine finds himself dating Bret's old girlfriend, who is really too hot for either of them. Especially funny songs in this one. A fantastic first episode.Bret Gives Up the Dream: Bret gets a sign holding job because the guys need money, but Jemaine feels Bret is turning his back on the band.Mugged: When Jemaine and Bret get mugged, Bret manages to get away, causing everyone to look down on him for leaving his best friend behind.Yoko: Jemaine and Murray consider Bret's new girlfriend from work to be a threat to the band's unity.Sally Returns: Jemaine thinks he is getting back together with Sally, and her return to their lives causes Bret to want another shot at her too, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend.Bowie: A depressed Bret begins dreaming of an advice giving David Bowie from various incarnations in his career. Truly, this is one of the best episodes, as others have said.Disc 2:Drive By: Murray falls in love with the leggy tech-support girl and gets to sing his own hilarious ballad while Bret and Jemaine have a race war with a racist fruit vendor across the street.Girlfriends: Bret and Jemaine get girlfriends, amazingly, but it turns out they are only interested in one thing. Well, one of them isn't interested in the guys at all. Love the French song in this one, and I'm sure I've seen the sexy blonde in some of Cinemax's after hours stuff.What Goes on Tour: Murray takes the boys on tour and discovers just how ""rock 'n' roll"" they really are.New Fans: When Bret and Jemaine get two new fans who are a bit on the wild side, the guys have to decide just how far they are willing to go.The Actor: Bret and Jemaine hire an actor to pretend to be a record producer and boost Murray's self esteem while simultaneously rejecting the band. This backfires, of course.The Third Conchord: Murray brings a third wheel into the band, and the Conchords soon split into two pairs, separating Bret and Jemaine.

1068345,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000P2A6C0,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","""Flight of the Conchords"" is a quirky, deadpan HBO series about a pair of New Zealanders, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement, trying to break into the New York music scene. The duo is more funky than any folk singers have ever been, and find themselves in a variety of Spinal Tap-esque situations involving the band, their one fan, Mel, and their incompetent manager, Murray.The humor here is very dry and delivered in an extremely deadpan manner, so fans of broadbrush or slapstick comedy may not find this to their tastes. People who like wry and intelligent humor will love it. I was especially amused by the episode where the guys were discriminated against by a fruit cart owner because they are New Zealanders (""I don't want our customers complaining that our fruit tastes like New Zealanders."") It couldn't have been resolved better than when the vendor discovers that he was confusing Australians and New Zealanders, ultimately befriending the guys in a horrible case of mistaken identity. Another favorite was the episode where Bret was haunted by visions of David Bowie in his sleep with hilarious results, and the final episode featuring a guest spot by the wonderful Demetri Martin.Each episode features a couple of short music videos, all of which are over-the-top funny, and are the antithesis of conventional musical productions (thank goodness). The DVD set is well worth owning, but a major complaint is the total absence of extras in a series this recent. If you like offbeat, bizarre comedy, ""Flight of the Conchords"" is well worth checking out.",4,"""She's Got Two Jobs...She's A Pastry Chef And A Sniper.""",1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,1563,"['Flight', 'Conchords', 'quirky', 'deadpan', 'HBO', 'series', 'pair', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'trying', 'break', 'New', 'York', 'music', 'scene', 'duo', 'more', 'funky', 'folk', 'singers', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'find', 'variety', 'Spinal', 'Tap-esque', 'situations', 'involving', 'band', 'one', 'fan', 'Mel', 'incompetent', 'manager', 'Murray.The', 'humor', 'here', 'very', 'dry', 'delivered', 'extremely', 'deadpan', 'manner', 'so', 'fans', 'broadbrush', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'tastes', 'People', 'who', 'wry', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'will', 'love', 'was', 'especially', 'amused', 'episode', 'where', 'guys', 'were', 'discriminated', 'fruit', 'cart', 'owner', 'are', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'customers', 'complaining', 'fruit', 'tastes', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'better', 'when', 'vendor', 'was', 'confusing', 'Australians', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'ultimately', 'befriending', 'guys', 'horrible', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'favorite', 'was', 'episode', 'where', 'Bret', 'was', 'haunted', 'visions', 'David', 'Bowie', 'sleep', 'hilarious', 'results', 'final', 'episode', 'featuring', 'guest', 'spot', 'wonderful', 'Demetri', 'Martin.Each', 'episode', 'couple', 'short', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'funny', 'are', 'antithesis', 'conventional', 'musical', 'productions', 'thank', 'goodness', 'DVD', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'major', 'complaint', 'total', 'absence', 'extras', 'series', 'recent', 'like', 'bizarre', 'comedy', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Flight of the Conchords: Season 1

The series tells the story of Bret and Jemaine, two musicians from New Zealand trying to make it in New York. They are not very successful.Unlike the case in most sitcoms, they live in an apartment that appears socioeconomically appropriate for two struggling musicians.  They are (poorly) managed by a fellow Kiwi whose day job is at the New Zealand embassy.The series mixes in magical realism and musical interludes, with Bret, Jemaine, and other characters breaking out into plot-related songs and scenarios.  The songs all have a humorous bent, and are exquisitely well-done.To say that we love this show would be an understatement.  To put it into perspective, I typically do not like musicals, and my favorite musical is 'The Blues Brothers'.  However, I love Flight of the Conchords.  The two leads are engaging and believable, the writing is razor sharp, and the show hit the ground running, and is enjoyable from the first episode of the first season to the last episode of the second season.Bret and Jemaine pulled the plug on any remaining seasons, and given the amount of creativity poured into the first two I can understand them wanting to take a break before they ran out of steam.

The band doesn't have their act quite together, their managers ""real"" job is at the NZ Consulate (conveniently located below ""All Asian Massage""), the band has one fan and they are hoping for a gig at the aquarium. The plot is humorously intertwined with fantasy music videos that parody the 1980's and 1990's MTV music video hey day. (Think Flashdance).The humor here is quite kiwi, which is excellent, but over the head of people who can't find NZ on a map. This show is going to appeal to the same kind of people who likeExtras - The Complete Series (Includes Series Finale)or have traveled a bit. The show quite rightly points out in a humorous way that a lot of Americans don't understand anything about NZ beyondThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition). Promotional posters on the wall of the NZ consulate proclaim ""NZ-It's Not Part Of Australia"" because many Americans confuse the two countries. (Watch for clever details like this in this show because they are a real joy.) My favourite episode has Jemaine and Bret fighting a race war with a fruit vendor who leaves a piece of stabbed kiwi fruit on their door on top of the note ""Die Kiwi's"". When they discover that the fruit vendor actually hates them because he has them confused with Australians (""you're accents are so much the same""-they're not) , the group makes up by running past the Australian embassy giving the building ""the bird"" much to the dismay of the Australian guard. It's a hilariously funny way to illustrate the fact that NZers are tired of living under the Australian shadow. I think Flight of the Conchords is only going to add to the trend of NZ coming into its own.Kudos to HBO for once again creating an excellent show. Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie have said they couldn't get this show made in NZ and now they are glad because TVNZ would have just ""tvnzed it""-made it bland. The show was apparently ""too kiwi"" for TVNZ. The only shows TVNZ makes are copies of American TV shows. It's true that NZ has a long history of neglecting its own talent which is why so many NZ artists don't object with they are labeled Australian ( Keith UrbanGreatest Hits, Sam Neil, Russell Crowe,Best of Crowded House-all kiwis labeled Australians by the American media). But in all fairness this show wouldn't have been made at any of the major American networks either. I can imagine the guys at ABC saying ""we can't understand their accent"", ""we won't be able to sell it on the Australian aftermarket because it makes fun of Australians and the advertisers won't like it"", etc etc.  HBO and HBO only has the guts to bring this sort of witty and truly funny series to the screen for which I am grateful.That being said, HBO didn't bend over backwards to give anything extra to fans in this DVD collection. You are buying the show only here. No commentaries, interviews, or out takes. You could have recorded this on your digital recording device. I still love owning it, but would have liked to have heard some witty commentary over some of the episodes. I think it would have been hilarious to hear Jemaine and Bret talk about some of the scenes. I've also wondered if any of these experiences are based on the experiences of Crowded House and was hoping for some clarifying interviews with this DVD, but alas, you get nothing.Make sure to check out Jemaine in the truly wonderfulEagle vs. Shark, or the spoofTongan Ninja. If you enjoy the New Zealand writing in Eagle vs. Shark and Flight of the Conchords, I recommend taking it a bit further and subscribing to a New Zealand journal likeLandfallor the cutting edgeTakaheand learning more about the culture subletities of this wonderful country.",5,Best Show On TV-No Extras On The DVD,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3881,"['Flight', 'Conchords', 'lives', 'two', 'NZ', 'musicians', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'create', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'band', ""n't"", 'have', 'act', 'quite', 'together', 'managers', 'real', 'job', 'NZ', 'Consulate', 'conveniently', 'located', 'Asian', 'Massage', 'band', 'one', 'fan', 'are', 'hoping', 'gig', 'aquarium', 'plot', 'humorously', 'intertwined', 'fantasy', 'music', 'videos', '1980', '1990', 'MTV', 'music', 'video', 'hey', 'day', 'Think', 'Flashdance', '.The', 'humor', 'here', 'quite', 'kiwi', 'excellent', 'head', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'NZ', 'map', 'show', 'going', 'appeal', 'same', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'likeExtras', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Includes', 'Series', 'Finale', 'have', 'traveled', 'bit', 'show', 'quite', 'rightly', 'out', 'humorous', 'way', 'lot', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anything', 'NZ', 'beyondThe', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Trilogy', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'Special', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'Promotional', 'posters', 'wall', 'NZ', 'consulate', 'proclaim', 'NZ-It', 'Not', 'Part', 'Australia', 'many', 'Americans', 'confuse', 'two', 'countries', 'Watch', 'clever', 'details', 'show', 'are', 'real', 'joy', 'favourite', 'episode', 'Jemaine', 'Bret', 'fighting', 'race', 'war', 'fruit', 'vendor', 'who', 'piece', 'stabbed', 'kiwi', 'fruit', 'door', 'top', 'note', 'Die', 'Kiwi', 'When', 'discover', 'fruit', 'vendor', 'actually', 'confused', 'Australians', ""'re"", 'accents', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'same', '-they', ""'re"", 'not', 'group', 'up', 'running', 'Australian', 'embassy', 'giving', 'building', 'bird', 'much', 'dismay', 'Australian', 'guard', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'way', 'illustrate', 'fact', 'NZers', 'are', 'tired', 'living', 'Australian', 'shadow', 'think', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'only', 'going', 'add', 'trend', 'NZ', 'coming', 'own.Kudos', 'HBO', 'once', 'again', 'creating', 'excellent', 'show', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'have', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'show', 'made', 'NZ', 'now', 'are', 'glad', 'TVNZ', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'tvnzed', '-made', 'bland', 'show', 'was', 'apparently', 'too', 'kiwi', 'TVNZ', 'only', 'TVNZ', 'are', 'copies', 'American', 'TV', 'shows', 'true', 'NZ', 'long', 'history', 'neglecting', 'own', 'talent', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'NZ', 'artists', 'do', ""n't"", 'object', 'are', 'labeled', 'Australian', 'Keith', 'UrbanGreatest', 'Hits', 'Sam', 'Neil', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Best', 'Crowded', 'House-all', 'kiwis', 'labeled', 'Australians', 'American', 'media', 'fairness', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'major', 'American', 'networks', 'either', 'can', 'imagine', 'guys', 'ABC', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'accent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'Australian', 'aftermarket', 'fun', 'Australians', 'advertisers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'etc', 'etc', 'HBO', 'HBO', 'only', 'guts', 'bring', 'sort', 'witty', 'truly', 'funny', 'series', 'screen', 'am', 'grateful.That', 'being', 'said', 'HBO', 'did', ""n't"", 'bend', 'over', 'backwards', 'give', 'anything', 'extra', 'fans', 'DVD', 'collection', 'are', 'buying', 'show', 'only', 'here', 'No', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'could', 'have', 'recorded', 'digital', 'recording', 'device', 'still', 'love', 'owning', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'witty', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'hear', 'Jemaine', 'Bret', 'talk', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'also', 'wondered', 'experiences', 'are', 'based', 'experiences', 'Crowded', 'House', 'was', 'hoping', 'clarifying', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'alas', 'get', 'nothing.Make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Jemaine', 'truly', 'wonderfulEagle', 'vs.', 'Shark', 'spoofTongan', 'Ninja', 'enjoy', 'New', 'Zealand', 'writing', 'Eagle', 'vs.', 'Shark', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'recommend', 'taking', 'bit', 'further', 'subscribing', 'New', 'Zealand', 'journal', 'likeLandfallor', 'cutting', 'edgeTakaheand', 'learning', 'more', 'culture', 'subletities', 'wonderful', 'country']",Flight of the Conchords: Season 1

Every single episode that I've seen is half boring, a quarter funny and a quarter annoying.  It seems that that is the recipe that HBO likes to follow for their ""breakthrough"" shows.  The humor here is average, you know that rare moment when SNL gets a sketch right and you chuckle a little, that's the best moments of this show.  Nothing that will make you and your friends cry with laughter hours after the show.  As musician comedians, usually not a fan, the songs are completely hit or miss.  Some of the songs have decent melodies that will stay with you a couple days but other songs are just awful, same goes for the humor, some songs are funny and others have you wondering how they could think they were funny.I know a lot of people that think this show is awesome, my brother and his friends, and that's fine, but why watch this when you can watch the old HBO Tenacious D episodes, or Mr. Show, or Upright Citizen's Brigade?
