1398097,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B004EI2NM2,Allan M. Lees,"[25, 30]","I confess I've always wanted to be able to write the story of a relationship in compressed form and Room In Rome accomplishes this brilliantly. In summary it's simple: two women meet in a bar before the movie commences and we see them embark on what should be a simple sexual encounter. But then... half-truths, lies, full truths, sharing of painful past experiences, sharing present joys, the fear of developing love... it's all caught delicately. Every time we think the movie is going in one direction, there's a change of pace, tone and intention.It would be very easy for a film like this to be pretentious but the light direction and sure-footed acting saves the day every time this risk appears to be drawing close. The two women fall in love, almost against their will, and so the morning comes to symbolize both rebirth and also the approaching of the pain of separation. Dawn is Alba's moment, and Dasha promises ""I'll stay with you till the dawn, and then we'll say goodbye.""It's really difficult to manage the intensity of such a scenario, and the longing it involves, but the script and the cast succeed. When the Russian girl Dasha steps away from Alba we really do feel the pain of the moment. Perhaps the only two unrealistic components are (i) the empathy and sympathy each woman has for the other - in real life one or both would tend to cut away to avoid pain; and (ii) the silly ""arrow in the heart"" moment that visually depicts the heart-pain Abla feels.Oh, and as the other reviewer has noted, after about the first two minutes we simply stop noticing the nudity of the actresses - the facial expressions, the movements of the hands, are all much more engrossing. The moments of sexual activity are more tender and touching than erotic, culminating in the moment they hug each other in the bath just before Dasha departs forever. It's in no way sexually arousing but it is absolutely arousing of tenderness, love, and the pain of loss-about-to-happen. How many of us have known that moment when the beloved is still present but we know, absolutely know, they are about to leave and never come back?  This is what the bath scene captures so brilliantly: lost possibility, lost love, a sacrifice to the quotidian. At the end of the movie the two women leave the room together, to go their separate ways. An entire relationship encapsulated in a single night.But... at the end the movie cheats. After the women part, Dasha runs to Alba. The obligatory happy ending... without this last moment of capitulation to audience expectations the movie would have earned a five-star review. And the music is great!UPDATE - since writing the original review I've re-watched this movie from time to time and each time it seems to become more poignant. Yes, some of the acting is a bit clunky for a few seconds here and there but overall there's something profoundly touching about the way in which even during the moments of greatest tenderness, greatest excitement of new love, the echo of imminent loss permeates everything. Perhaps I've reached the age where, no longer believing in love, it's come to matter more and more.",4,Poignant,1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,3134,"['confess', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'write', 'story', 'relationship', 'compressed', 'form', 'Room', 'Rome', 'accomplishes', 'brilliantly', 'summary', 'simple', 'two', 'women', 'meet', 'bar', 'movie', 'commences', 'see', 'embark', 'should', 'be', 'simple', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'then', 'half-truths', 'full', 'truths', 'sharing', 'painful', 'past', 'experiences', 'sharing', 'present', 'joys', 'fear', 'developing', 'love', 'caught', 'delicately', 'Every', 'time', 'think', 'movie', 'going', 'one', 'direction', 'change', 'pace', 'tone', 'intention.It', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'film', 'be', 'pretentious', 'light', 'direction', 'sure-footed', 'acting', 'day', 'time', 'risk', 'be', 'drawing', 'close', 'two', 'women', 'fall', 'love', 'almost', 'will', 'so', 'morning', 'symbolize', 'rebirth', 'also', 'approaching', 'pain', 'separation', 'Dawn', 'Alba', 'moment', 'Dasha', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'till', 'dawn', 'then', ""'ll"", 'say', 'goodbye', 'really', 'difficult', 'manage', 'intensity', 'such', 'scenario', 'longing', 'script', 'cast', 'succeed', 'When', 'Russian', 'girl', 'Dasha', 'away', 'Alba', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'pain', 'moment', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'two', 'unrealistic', 'components', 'are', 'i', 'empathy', 'sympathy', 'woman', 'other', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'would', 'tend', 'cut', 'away', 'avoid', 'pain', 'ii', 'silly', 'arrow', 'heart', 'moment', 'visually', 'heart-pain', 'Abla', 'feels.Oh', 'other', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'first', 'two', 'minutes', 'simply', 'stop', 'noticing', 'nudity', 'actresses', 'facial', 'expressions', 'movements', 'hands', 'are', 'all', 'much', 'more', 'engrossing', 'moments', 'sexual', 'activity', 'are', 'more', 'tender', 'touching', 'erotic', 'culminating', 'moment', 'hug', 'other', 'bath', 'just', 'before', 'Dasha', 'forever', 'way', 'sexually', 'arousing', 'absolutely', 'arousing', 'tenderness', 'love', 'pain', 'loss-about-to-happen', 'How', 'many', 'have', 'known', 'moment', 'when', 'beloved', 'still', 'present', 'know', 'absolutely', 'know', 'are', 'leave', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'what', 'bath', 'scene', 'captures', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'lost', 'possibility', 'lost', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'quotidian', 'end', 'movie', 'two', 'women', 'leave', 'room', 'together', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'entire', 'relationship', 'encapsulated', 'single', 'night.But', 'end', 'movie', 'cheats', 'women', 'part', 'Dasha', 'Alba', 'obligatory', 'happy', 'ending', 'last', 'moment', 'capitulation', 'audience', 'expectations', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'earned', 'five-star', 'review', 'music', 'great', 'UPDATE', 'writing', 'original', 'review', ""'ve"", 're-watched', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'time', 'become', 'more', 'poignant', 'Yes', 'acting', 'bit', 'clunky', 'few', 'seconds', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'something', 'profoundly', 'touching', 'way', 'even', 'moments', 'greatest', 'tenderness', 'greatest', 'excitement', 'new', 'love', 'echo', 'imminent', 'loss', 'everything', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'age', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'believing', 'love', 'come', 'matter', 'more', 'more']",N/A

The two actresses are gorgeous and they play their sex scenes enthusiastically, but the real erotic content is to be found in their playfulness, their hesitation, their emotion. Sex is both entertainment and a bandage for the pain of their pasts and presents. If you're looking for pornography you'll be disappointed despite the profound sexuality of the film.Both women find themselves initially unwilling to give their real names or pasts, substituting a cascade of lies in an effort to keep their distance. Over the course of the night, however, they become closer, the lies fall apart, and they find their emotions running away with them.The bad: the character of Maximo is completely superfluous, adding nothing to the story but the male gaze and a moment of fearful discomfort that interrupts both the emotional and erotic content. The soundtrack repeatedly resorts to an increasingly annoying Italian pop song with vapid English lyrics. And, after an entire film firmly rooted in reality, the penultimate scenes make a sudden jarring and unnecessary switch to magical realism.All in all: come to this film for the beautiful (and near-constant) female nudity, stay for the chaotic love story.

Natasha openly states that she has never come back to a woman's hotel room before. Unsure at first, she eventually comes under the spell of Alba's charms. From that point on, the women rarely don any clothes at all; an occasional robe or sheet is all that separates them for the remainder of the film.The women initially hide their real identities weaving false tales of love, life and their past. As they become closer physically, making love over and over again, the stories gradually become closer to the truth and their inhibitions are stripped bare. Natasha is meeting her fianc&eacute; and is to be married within a week; Alba on the other hand has run away from a troubled relationship with her partner and the grief that has separated them. As the women navigate the terrain of truth and lies, they discover what hides beneath the surface and in doing so change their lives forever. Over breakfast on the terrace surrounded by the beauty of Rome, they talk of what they would do if they could be together.  After this intense night of passion, can Alba and Natasha really part?Set almost entirely in a hotel room full of old world charm, the sensuously real love making scenes are depicted in lush hues as deep as the artwork that hangs on the walls. Writer-director Julio Medem (Sex & Lucia) has brought to the screen a stunning, if unconventional film.

Surfing on the web one day I found a picture of 2 girls hugging very dramatically in a bathtub and someone mentioned it was from ""Room in Rome"" so I decided to give it a go.Picture is marvelous and music is exquisite... I regret enormously not watching this movie before. The story happens in a small room of some sort of hotel in Rome full of paintings. Two strangers meet in a bar, and decide to act crazy for once and head to the hotel room of one of them. Four walls, yet the story does not become boring.This movie dances in a thin lie of truths and lies, and the line becomes even thinner when trying to classify it. I would consider it one of the greatest lesbian drama movies done so far, yet since the two main characters spend 90% of the movie naked it caresses the erotica genre so sensually you will have trouble classifying it yourself.There is just so much complexity, complicity, companionship, and passion between the two characters there's no denial they're each other's true soul mates...  This movie truly catches a glimpse of how lesbian relationships happen many times, and how things are just not always sexual. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",5,It's like a painting brought to life,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,1298,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'movie', 'sitting', 'box', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'will', 'watch', 'Surfing', 'web', 'one', 'day', 'found', 'picture', '2', 'girls', 'hugging', 'very', 'dramatically', 'bathtub', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'was', 'Room', 'Rome', 'decided', 'give', 'go.Picture', 'marvelous', 'music', 'exquisite', 'regret', 'enormously', 'not', 'watching', 'movie', 'story', 'small', 'room', 'sort', 'hotel', 'Rome', 'full', 'paintings', 'Two', 'strangers', 'meet', 'bar', 'decide', 'act', 'crazy', 'once', 'head', 'hotel', 'room', 'one', 'Four', 'walls', 'yet', 'story', 'not', 'become', 'boring.This', 'movie', 'dances', 'thin', 'lie', 'truths', 'lies', 'line', 'even', 'thinner', 'when', 'trying', 'classify', 'would', 'consider', 'one', 'greatest', 'lesbian', 'drama', 'movies', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'yet', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'spend', '90', '%', 'movie', 'naked', 'erotica', 'genre', 'so', 'sensually', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'classifying', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'complexity', 'complicity', 'companionship', 'passion', 'two', 'characters', 'denial', ""'re"", 'other', 'true', 'soul', 'mates', 'movie', 'truly', 'glimpse', 'how', 'lesbian', 'relationships', 'happen', 'many', 'times', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'always', 'sexual', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'friend']",N/A
