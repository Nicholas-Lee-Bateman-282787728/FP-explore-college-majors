106687,A1LDIMQISH07WK,0790738317,Rebecca,"[3, 4]","I have to say that I like the Olsen twins and I think they are good actresses, it's just that none of their movies seem to be my absolute favorites in the entire world. And sometimes, some of their movies can be a bit cheesy and lame. However, I do recommend this one, BILLBOARD DAD, to their fans. It's actually pretty good - whether or not you believe me!In BILLBOARD DAD, it takes place in Venice, California. Mary-Kate plays Tess Tyler and Ashley plays Emily Tyler. The girls are worried about their dad who is an artist because ever since their mother died, he hasn't been out on a date and they think he is lonely. The girls do whatever they can to try and set him up on a date - that means even putting his name and his phone number on a giant billboard in Venice! - and eventually, he ends up seeing a woman. Unfortunately for the girls, the woman he starts to date has a son and the son, Ryan (Sam Saletta), happens to be their enemy on the girls' swim team. But just like all the usual Olsen twin videos, the girls end up...! Well, it would be awful if I spolied the whole movie for y'all so I'm not gonna say the ending but I'll bet you can be pretty sure what'll happen.Anyways, BILLBOARD DAD may not be Oscar-worthy material, but it's certainly entertaining for kids, pre-teens, and even teens. Adults might find this boring. Although some adults may actually like this. I'm not the hugest Olsen twins fan, but I do like their movies and I think they are pretty good actresses. I thought they were especially good when they were on the show, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (which is one of my favorite TV shows!). And I would definitely recommend BILLBOARD DAD to all of their fans. It's a really great movie and some of the guys in it are cute, too.",5,Great fun movie - - but not my fav film ever!,987811200,"04 21, 2001",2001,1755,"['have', 'say', 'like', 'Olsen', 'twins', 'think', 'are', 'good', 'actresses', 'just', 'none', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'entire', 'world', 'sometimes', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'lame', 'However', 'do', 'recommend', 'one', 'BILLBOARD', 'DAD', 'fans', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'believe', 'BILLBOARD', 'DAD', 'place', 'Venice', 'California', 'Mary-Kate', 'Tess', 'Tyler', 'Ashley', 'plays', 'Emily', 'Tyler', 'girls', 'are', 'worried', 'dad', 'who', 'artist', 'ever', 'mother', 'died', ""n't"", 'been', 'out', 'date', 'think', 'lonely', 'girls', 'do', 'can', 'try', 'set', 'up', 'date', 'even', 'putting', 'name', 'phone', 'number', 'giant', 'billboard', 'Venice', 'eventually', 'up', 'seeing', 'woman', 'Unfortunately', 'girls', 'woman', 'date', 'son', 'son', 'Ryan', 'Sam', 'Saletta', 'be', 'enemy', 'girls', 'swim', 'team', 'just', 'usual', 'Olsen', 'twin', 'videos', 'girls', 'end', 'up', 'Well', 'would', 'be', 'awful', 'spolied', 'whole', 'movie', ""y'all"", 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'na', 'say', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'sure', 'what', ""'ll"", 'happen.Anyways', 'BILLBOARD', 'DAD', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Oscar-worthy', 'material', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'pre-teens', 'even', 'teens', 'Adults', 'might', 'find', 'boring', 'adults', 'may', 'actually', 'like', ""'m"", 'not', 'hugest', 'Olsen', 'fan', 'do', 'movies', 'think', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'actresses', 'thought', 'were', 'especially', 'good', 'when', 'were', 'show', 'quot', '7th', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'BILLBOARD', 'DAD', 'fans', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'guys', 'are', 'cute', 'too']",N/A
