293603,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302049040,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","From the minute I heard that there was such a diverse reaction to this film from audiences, I had a feeling that I was going to love it.  I honestly had no idea that I would love it THIS much.  Musicals are right up my alley, but it takes something special for it be top tier, since many musicals seem to follow the same formula.  What `Pennies from Heaven' does is create something unfamiliar, something dripping with exceptional style and presence and while it may not have been what audiences were expecting from the two stars (who are the best they've ever been here), that should not be a reason to avoid or look down on this brilliant film.The world wanted another `The Jerk' and what they got was something far superior in every way, and I like that movie.Taking an interesting approach to the genre, `Pennies from Heaven' has its stars lip-syncing classics in a Great Depression backdrop.  The film dares to contrast the reality of the situations with the fantasy presented in these songs, as one lonely, unhappy man tries to escape the drudgery of his existence through song.  The beautifully choreographed musical numbers add flashes of style and happiness as the world stops and shifts in order for Arthur to `dream', but it is the muted colors and gritty production values that keep the film's core themes relevant and present.The entire cast is fantastic, from Steve Martin to the luminous Bernadette Peters (her Oscar snub is gross) to Jessica Harper as Martin's jilted wife and a surprisingly rich cameo (one scene) performance from Christopher Walken.The progression of plot is unbelievably rich, giving us so much yet gradually, building an unforgettable experience.  There is no holding back here.  The situation is as dire as they come (destitution, unwanted pregnancy, rape, murder, abortion, execution) and yet the juxtaposition of the dire realties and the sunny musicality make this a truly unique and gloriously entertaining experience.",5,Worth every penny!,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,1960,"['minute', 'heard', 'was', 'such', 'diverse', 'reaction', 'film', 'audiences', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'love', 'honestly', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'love', 'THIS', 'much', 'Musicals', 'are', 'right', 'alley', 'something', 'special', 'be', 'top', 'tier', 'many', 'musicals', 'seem', 'follow', 'same', 'formula', 'What', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'create', 'something', 'unfamiliar', 'something', 'dripping', 'exceptional', 'style', 'presence', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'audiences', 'were', 'expecting', 'two', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'here', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'reason', 'avoid', 'look', 'down', 'brilliant', 'film.The', 'world', 'wanted', 'Jerk', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'something', 'far', 'superior', 'way', 'like', 'movie.Taking', 'interesting', 'approach', 'genre', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'stars', 'lip-syncing', 'classics', 'Great', 'Depression', 'backdrop', 'film', 'contrast', 'reality', 'situations', 'fantasy', 'presented', 'songs', 'one', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'man', 'escape', 'drudgery', 'existence', 'song', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'musical', 'numbers', 'add', 'flashes', 'style', 'happiness', 'world', 'stops', 'shifts', 'order', 'Arthur', 'dream', 'muted', 'colors', 'gritty', 'production', 'values', 'keep', 'film', 'core', 'themes', 'relevant', 'present.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'luminous', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Oscar', 'snub', 'gross', 'Jessica', 'Harper', 'Martin', 'jilted', 'wife', 'surprisingly', 'rich', 'cameo', 'one', 'scene', 'performance', 'Christopher', 'Walken.The', 'progression', 'plot', 'unbelievably', 'rich', 'giving', 'so', 'much', 'yet', 'gradually', 'building', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'holding', 'back', 'here', 'situation', 'as', 'dire', 'come', 'destitution', 'unwanted', 'pregnancy', 'rape', 'murder', 'abortion', 'execution', 'yet', 'juxtaposition', 'dire', 'realties', 'sunny', 'musicality', 'make', 'truly', 'unique', 'gloriously', 'entertaining', 'experience']",N/A

Steve Martin stars as a failed sheet music salesman, unhappily married to the up-tight Jessica Harper, who just wants to find someone passionate to love. He finds her in Bernadette Peters, but all does not lead to a ""happily-ever-after"" conclusion. The comedy occurs as the characters burst into song and dance, often at the most depressing moments, mimicking (lip-synching, actually) the famous singers of the '30s such as Bing Crosby and Helen Kane (the ""Boop-boop-a-doop"" girl), and aping Busby Berkeley big-number dance routines. Many of these are hilarious (the schoolkids hoofing on their desks in tuxedos, Christopher Walken in a wowser tap-dance rendition), but the joke is of a single nature and might feel old by the time the movie ends. The attention to details in the sets is amazing, and the photography is superb.

293606,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302049040,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","It's in the middle of the Depression and sad sack Arthur is a traveling sheet music salesman. He dreams of the love and happiness he finds in the songs, and he longs for his wife to give him love and sex. Arthur and the other characters break into lip synching popular songs of the period to illustrate their feelings. He meets a repressed but adventurous school teacher, and depression really sets in for the viewer.The movie is based on the strange and wonderful Dennis Potter BBC television show from 1978 (which I'm in the process of watching). In the Herbert Ross version, Steve Martin plays Arthur, Bernadette Peters the school marm and Jessica Walters the wife.The movie has some great moments, but for me those moments are all wrapped up in the big production numbers. These are elaborate song productions with the stars dancing and lip synching. The numbers are huge Busby Berkeley fantasies in vivid color with lavish sets and costumes. And they completely overwhelm what interest there might be in the sad little story of Arthur. That's only part of the problem. At this point in his movie career, I don't think Martin had the skill or the confidence to portray yearning (as he did excellently in Roxanne). That lack of sympathy for Arthur really undercuts the story. I can't help but contrast his performance with Bob Hoskins in the original BBC production. Hoskins is so instantly likable that he automatically gives greater depth to the role.But, ah, the musical numbers. They're great. Vernel Bagneris does a terrific shuffling dance in the rain to Pennies from Heaven. Christopher Walken is a wonder as a sleazy pimp doing a strip and tap routine while lip synching to Let's Misbehave. And the dance number in the bank with Martin and, I think, an actor named Jay Garner, is a lot of fun. Garner plays a fat, complacent, middle aged banker who turns Martin down for a loan...but then in Arthur's fantasy they break into lip sync song and dance while the banker showers Arthur with money. Garner nearly steals the scene.Martin must have really wanted to do this movie; it shows in the terrific dance routines he handles with skill and enthusiasm. The movie itself, for me, just doesn't come off. If you like big Hollywood production numbers, though, get the disc and fast forward to them. That's what I've done after the first time I saw the movie on VHS. The Walken number alone is worth the price of the DVD. I gave it four stars because of the musical numbers.The DVD transfer is fine.",4,"Great Dance Numbers, Sad Story",1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,2503,"['middle', 'Depression', 'sad', 'sack', 'Arthur', 'traveling', 'sheet', 'music', 'salesman', 'love', 'happiness', 'songs', 'wife', 'give', 'love', 'sex', 'Arthur', 'other', 'characters', 'break', 'lip', 'synching', 'popular', 'songs', 'period', 'illustrate', 'feelings', 'repressed', 'adventurous', 'school', 'teacher', 'depression', 'really', 'viewer.The', 'movie', 'based', 'strange', 'wonderful', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'BBC', 'television', 'show', '1978', ""'m"", 'process', 'watching', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'version', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Arthur', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'school', 'marm', 'Jessica', 'Walters', 'wife.The', 'movie', 'great', 'moments', 'moments', 'are', 'wrapped', 'up', 'big', 'production', 'numbers', 'are', 'elaborate', 'song', 'productions', 'stars', 'dancing', 'lip', 'synching', 'numbers', 'are', 'huge', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'fantasies', 'vivid', 'color', 'lavish', 'sets', 'costumes', 'completely', 'overwhelm', 'what', 'interest', 'might', 'be', 'sad', 'little', 'story', 'Arthur', 'only', 'part', 'problem', 'point', 'movie', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Martin', 'had', 'skill', 'confidence', 'portray', 'yearning', 'did', 'excellently', 'Roxanne', 'lack', 'sympathy', 'Arthur', 'really', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'contrast', 'performance', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'original', 'BBC', 'production', 'Hoskins', 'so', 'instantly', 'likable', 'automatically', 'greater', 'depth', 'role.But', 'ah', 'musical', 'numbers', ""'re"", 'great', 'Vernel', 'Bagneris', 'terrific', 'shuffling', 'dance', 'rain', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'wonder', 'sleazy', 'pimp', 'doing', 'strip', 'tap', 'routine', 'lip', 'synching', 'Let', 'Misbehave', 'dance', 'number', 'bank', 'Martin', 'think', 'actor', 'named', 'Jay', 'Garner', 'lot', 'fun', 'Garner', 'fat', 'complacent', 'middle', 'aged', 'banker', 'who', 'Martin', 'down', 'loan', 'then', 'Arthur', 'fantasy', 'break', 'lip', 'sync', 'song', 'dance', 'banker', 'showers', 'Arthur', 'money', 'Garner', 'nearly', 'scene.Martin', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'wanted', 'do', 'movie', 'terrific', 'dance', 'routines', 'skill', 'enthusiasm', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'like', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'numbers', 'though', 'get', 'disc', 'fast', 'forward', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'VHS', 'Walken', 'number', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'musical', 'numbers.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'fine']",N/A
293607,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6302049040,Craig Connell,"[3, 5]","Man, did I love the musical numbers in this film.....but hated the story. I wound up taping just the music segments out of this film and making myself a neat little half-hour video of fantastic song-and-dance numbers.The dance numbers are 1920s-1930s material except you get 1980s color and special-effects (and loose sexual mores). Actually, these are more like put-ons of those routines, including Busby Berkeley extravaganzas. Added to the routines are humor. I just laughed out loud at the absurdity of them, which included having the actors lip-sync to the old-time singers.The dance routines are all totally different and very entertaining, from the opening bank skit, to the kids in the classroom to Christopher Walken's striptease to Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters imitating Astaire & Rogers. The dancing is good and the songs are great: catchy and fun.Story-wise, Martin (""Arthur Parker"") plays a boorish, profane, lying and just plain unlikeable character. Are we supposed to root for him? Maybe we are to root for Peters, who plays ""Lulu,"" the school teacher-turned- prostitute (sounds like real-life these days with all the female teacher sex scandals). Hey, I like Martin in a lot of films. He can be a very entertaining guy, but the character he plays in here.....well, you can have him and this very cynical and depressing story. No thanks.It's no surprise to me it bombed at the box office. Too bad, because with a more appealing story a lot more people would have been treated to the great musical numbers in this movie.",3,"Hilarious, Innovative Musical Numbers; But Depressing Story",1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,1541,"['Man', 'did', 'love', 'musical', 'numbers', 'film', '..but', 'hated', 'story', 'wound', 'up', 'taping', 'just', 'music', 'film', 'making', 'neat', 'little', 'half-hour', 'video', 'fantastic', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers.The', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', '1920s-1930s', 'material', 'get', '1980s', 'color', 'special-effects', 'loose', 'sexual', 'mores', 'Actually', 'are', 'more', 'put-ons', 'routines', 'including', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'extravaganzas', 'Added', 'routines', 'are', 'humor', 'just', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'absurdity', 'included', 'having', 'actors', 'lip-sync', 'old-time', 'singers.The', 'dance', 'routines', 'are', 'totally', 'different', 'very', 'entertaining', 'opening', 'bank', 'skit', 'kids', 'classroom', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'striptease', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'imitating', 'Astaire', 'Rogers', 'dancing', 'good', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'catchy', 'fun.Story-wise', 'Martin', 'Arthur', 'Parker', 'boorish', 'profane', 'lying', 'just', 'plain', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'Are', 'supposed', 'root', 'Maybe', 'are', 'root', 'Peters', 'who', 'Lulu', 'school', 'teacher-turned-', 'prostitute', 'real-life', 'days', 'female', 'teacher', 'sex', 'scandals', 'Hey', 'like', 'Martin', 'lot', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'guy', 'character', 'here', '..well', 'can', 'have', 'very', 'cynical', 'depressing', 'story', 'thanks.It', 'surprise', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'Too', 'bad', 'more', 'appealing', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'great', 'musical', 'numbers', 'movie']",N/A
293608,A8S11VP9Z36D6,6302049040,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[4, 4]","Had it not been for a film class I took in college, I probably never would have seen this movie. The study of what might appear a semi-typical musical was fascinating. The story is of Arthur (Steve Martin), a sheet music salesman during the Depression. He loves the happy tunes of the songs that he sells, but in real life, all he seems to get is unhappiness. Happy dream sequence musical interludes with period songs contrast with the way things really are in Arthur's life. He has a frigid and shrewish wife, Joan (Jessica Harper), and his sales are dropping. When he meets school teacher Eileen (Bernadette Peters), he sees his first chance at turning his life around. However, trouble still follows him until the ending...which, like the rest of the film, is sad and extremely happy all at the same time. Christopher Walken has a standout dancing cameo role as Eileen's pimp...yes, she slides from school teacher to prostitute in this film.The film tanked at the Box Office when it released, losing about $13 million. The public expected Wild and Crazy Guy Steve Martin, and instead, they got a serious acting song-and-dance man whose character truly is a heel; although he wants to be a good guy, he often makes poor choices that are caused by his libido, not his brain. A better marketing campaign most likely would have helped, but either way, this film still holds up as a successfully daring look back at the Depression and the Musicals of the time that were meant to lift people from these troubled and turbulent times. The film goes back and forth from gritty to frothy; Bob Mackie did a fantastic job with costuming, and the Cinematrography & Set Design are also incredible; actual paintings of the era were recreated in scenes, giving the film both a period and artistic feel that works well in so many ways.Steve Martin is a standout; his dancing would lead you to believe that he had always been a star of musicals; Peters' musical gifts are already known, and she is perfectly cast as the hum-drum teacher who has much more going on inside of her. Her sexual awakening by Martin's character is totally believeable. All of the musical numbers are lip-synched to vintage recordings, with the exception of Martin singing the title song near the end of the film. Martin's lip-synching is somewhat off; whether or not this was intentional is not known, but it does detract somewhat from the film. The standout number for me is Bernadette Peter's musical number, ""Love Is Good For Anything That Ails You,"" sung in her classroom. In this dream sequence, her drab attire is transformed into a tight-fitting silver lam&eacute; gown. This sequence is riveting, funny, and well choreographed.This DVD also includes an interesting panel discussion lead by film critic Peter Rainer. Rainer is a poor moderator, but the anecdotes by Martin, Harper, Bob Mackie, and the rest is very informative. A scene-specific audio commentary by Rainer is also included; although Rainer comes off as a dope, his appreciation of the film and the fact that he ""gets it"" is admirable. Theatrical Trailer also included.Looking for a silly and mindless comedy? Check elsewhere. Want a serious movie with many messages that is artistic and provokes much thought?

293617,A3OTPC2QV17093,6302049040,J. Bongiorno,"[34, 34]","This is a film for thinking people who love movies and aren't afraid to try something very different.  The fact that this picture was made was a miracle in itself as it is almost unrelentingly grim, melancholy and dark, but so gorgeously shot, well-acted, and hauntingly scored that many will find quite a measure of joy in watching this film.  The brilliant musical numbers (performed to perfection by the cast) are up to the standards of the Gingers/Rogers films of old, yet are so contrary to them thematically.  Instead of the standard feel-good joi de vivre, they serve here instead to atually underscore the tragedy of the characters lives and demonstrate just how far away they are from the joyous visions the songs describe.  So, if you're looking for a happy-go-lucky lightweight return to the MGM of the past, this likely isn't the picture for you.  On the other hand, if you want a stunning homage to the musicals of the 30's, but one which does not sacrifice artful storytelling and an almost picture-quality reproduction of the grief, sorrow and anger of the Depression-era 30's, this is the pinnacle of filmmaking (and with sumptious musical numbers to back it).IMO, this is hands down Steve Martin's best role and as well as Bernadette Peters (who should have been won the Academy that year).  Both are incredible, as is Christopher Walken and Jessica Harper.  As the main protagonist of the film, it is a rare distinction for Martin (as well as for this genre film) that he is not really a nice guy -- yet nor is he a true villain.  There are sympathetic qualities to his character, but also irremedially selfish, childish ones.  One of the great elements of this film is that all of the characters are fully three-dimensional and you don't really know where these characters are going to go or what decisions they're going to make.  Behind the stylization, cinematography and dance numbers lies subtle artistic, poetic and psychological underpinnings wherein lie real people and their tragedies and the sorrow they bring upon themselves.  Martin plays the frustrated husband who begins an affair with an innocent schoolteacher, destroying all of their lives, including his own, in the process.  Make no mistake, this is a  dark film which deals powerfully with themes of yearning and lost innocence, and which is fueled by an almost sexual rage.  Sexual anger permeates nearly all of the musical numbers in ways that are surprising and original, yet almost always sad.  Sex represents the catalyst for doom and evil in this film.  There is hypnotizing -- almost trance-like -- and surreal quality to the way this film is shot, and the mood is pervasive and not one a mature film-lover is likely to forget right away...As far as the DVD transfer is concerned: I'm very glad that it's in anamorphic widescreen as it should be.  The color palette is deep and rich, and although there is some artifacting and pixellation, it is hardly distracting.  A major treat is the commentary track by film critic Peter Rainer, a man who really understands the brilliance of this movie and its underlying themes.  There is also a 20th Anniversary Cast and Crew Reunion (which unfortunately lacks Peters and Walken).  The one sore spot of this disk is that it's missing deleted scenes, which is inexusable IMO, especially as one of crew discusses some beautiful scenes he was upset to cut out for the sake of pacing.  Let's hope we get a Special Edition sometime in the near future.Another musical didn't emerge again until Moulin Rouge and Chicago, both of which received great accolades.  Without disprect to those, Pennies from Heaven is a far superior film in many ways: Uncompromising and artful, with touches of noir and mystery; at times a strange ride, and profoundly sorrowful, this is one of those rare classics that has not been seen by enough people.",5,A rare and unusual treat: a musical shrouded in darkness,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,3862,"['film', 'thinking', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'try', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'fact', 'picture', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'miracle', 'almost', 'unrelentingly', 'grim', 'melancholy', 'dark', 'so', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'well-acted', 'hauntingly', 'scored', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'quite', 'measure', 'joy', 'watching', 'film', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'numbers', 'performed', 'perfection', 'cast', 'are', 'up', 'standards', 'Gingers/Rogers', 'films', 'old', 'yet', 'are', 'so', 'contrary', 'thematically', 'Instead', 'standard', 'feel-good', 'joi', 'vivre', 'serve', 'here', 'instead', 'atually', 'underscore', 'tragedy', 'characters', 'lives', 'demonstrate', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'away', 'are', 'joyous', 'visions', 'songs', 'describe', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'happy-go-lucky', 'lightweight', 'return', 'MGM', 'past', 'likely', ""n't"", 'picture', 'other', 'hand', 'want', 'stunning', 'homage', 'musicals', '30', 'one', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'artful', 'storytelling', 'almost', 'picture-quality', 'reproduction', 'grief', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'Depression-era', '30', 'pinnacle', 'filmmaking', 'sumptious', 'musical', 'numbers', 'back', 'down', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'best', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'won', 'Academy', 'year', 'are', 'incredible', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Jessica', 'Harper', 'main', 'protagonist', 'film', 'rare', 'distinction', 'Martin', 'as', 'well', 'genre', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'yet', 'true', 'villain', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'qualities', 'character', 'also', 'irremedially', 'selfish', 'childish', 'ones', 'One', 'great', 'elements', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'three-dimensional', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'what', 'decisions', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'stylization', 'cinematography', 'dance', 'numbers', 'subtle', 'artistic', 'poetic', 'psychological', 'underpinnings', 'wherein', 'lie', 'real', 'people', 'tragedies', 'sorrow', 'bring', 'upon', 'Martin', 'frustrated', 'husband', 'who', 'affair', 'innocent', 'schoolteacher', 'destroying', 'lives', 'including', 'own', 'process', 'Make', 'mistake', 'dark', 'film', 'powerfully', 'themes', 'yearning', 'lost', 'innocence', 'fueled', 'almost', 'sexual', 'rage', 'Sexual', 'anger', 'permeates', 'nearly', 'musical', 'numbers', 'ways', 'are', 'surprising', 'original', 'yet', 'almost', 'always', 'sad', 'Sex', 'catalyst', 'doom', 'evil', 'film', 'hypnotizing', 'almost', 'trance-like', 'surreal', 'quality', 'way', 'film', 'shot', 'mood', 'pervasive', 'not', 'one', 'mature', 'film-lover', 'likely', 'forget', 'right', 'away', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'concerned', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'should', 'be', 'color', 'palette', 'deep', 'rich', 'artifacting', 'pixellation', 'hardly', 'distracting', 'major', 'treat', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'critic', 'Peter', 'Rainer', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'underlying', 'themes', 'also', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'Reunion', 'unfortunately', 'Peters', 'Walken', 'one', 'sore', 'spot', 'disk', 'missing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'inexusable', 'IMO', 'especially', 'one', 'crew', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'was', 'upset', 'cut', 'out', 'sake', 'pacing', 'Let', 'hope', 'get', 'Special', 'Edition', 'sometime', 'near', 'future.Another', 'musical', 'did', ""n't"", 'emerge', 'again', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Chicago', 'received', 'great', 'accolades', 'disprect', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'Uncompromising', 'artful', 'touches', 'noir', 'mystery', 'times', 'strange', 'ride', 'profoundly', 'sorrowful', 'one', 'rare', 'classics', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'enough', 'people']",N/A

But equally important is the brilliance of director Herbert Ross, who took this schizophrenic story with its phony happy ending and brought cohesion to it all with craftsmanship and superior production values. It is unlike any other film he did, and it's sometimes hard to believe this came from the same man who directed tripe like ""The Turning Point.""Everyone involved took risks with this film and rose above themselves, knowing how very special this idea was.

So I watched this 1981 Herbert Ross-directed Hollywood version more-or-less from a ""fresh"" point of view, which I suspect worked in it's favor. The gimmick here - in case you didn't know - in this 1934-set musical is that the actors lip-synch to actual old records of Depression-era songs (some from musical films, some not) while doing their own dancing. This is probably all to the good when it comes to a couple of the leads, Steve Martin and Christopher Walken, who are good dancers (especially Walken) but not as far as I know terribly accomplished singers. Bernadette Peters though is known for her voice as much as anything so it's too bad she doesn't get to use it. Then again, she doesn't exactly have a 1930s vocal style.The fairly thin storyline has Martin as Arthur, a sheet-music salesman in Chicago barely making a living, and married to a frigid wife (Jessica Harper). Arthur of course has grander dreams and on the road in a rural part of the state he meets one of them - a schoolteacher named Eileen (Peters). Romancing Peters, leaving her pregnant, he returns to Chicago and decides to set up a record store, feeling that this is how people want their music now; meanwhile Eileen has followed him to the big city and fallen in with a charming bad man (Christopher Walken) - while Arthur is being pursued by the cops for the murder of a blind girl actually done in by an accordionist who Arthur befriended. I got the feeling there was some statement about art and morality being made at this point - or that might have been made in the longer TV series, that didn't come across here. In any case, life seems hopeless for the fallen Eileen (now christened ""Lulu"") and Arthur, but hey this is a movie-musical, right? So don't expect tears at the end...The film has several problems - the storyline isn't terribly compelling, Jessica Harper's thankless role comes off as sexist and borderline offensive, and Martin seems to be channelling Al Jolson - a great singer, but hardly the best 1930s musical actor - and inappropriate to the style of the film, which is much closer to 1970s grit than 1930s Busby Berkely fantasy.  I don't think Martin's BAD, really - just that his characterization seems a bit out of place at times.  A larger issue I think is that the whole film is built on a notion of irony between the happy-go-lucky nature of the songs being sung, and the dreary lives of the characters - but there simply isn't any space between the two left for the audience to digest this disconnect. We basically get scene after scene of struggle and depression, with a minute or two of bursting into song, and then back into the dark narrative; it never really comes together as the kind of dialectic that (I believe) is intended.But on the bright side, Peters and Walken (in a too-small role) are excellent, and the production design (by Philip Harrison, uncredited), choreography (by Danny Daniels) and especially the burnished-gold cinematography by Gordon Willis are exceptional - and I've got no complaints about the music, however it's used. There are several truly spectacular numbers - the Busby Berkeley-esque showstopper in the bank early on while Martin is trying to borrow money; the dance in the rain to the title song by The Accordionist (Vernel Bagneris) (reminiscent of Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain) and Christopher Walken's dynamic number in the tavern (which reminded me of some of Sammy Davis Jr's work) are all worthy of their antecendents. Very much worth seeing at this point as an example of Steve Martin's work back when he used to take chances and go for something interesting rather than just the easy paychecks.DVD NOTE: the widescreen (1.85:1) transfer looks and sounds fine - Willis' photography really is glorious - but it's a bare-bones package.  Though I don't think this is a ""great"" film, it's one I'd appreciate having more material on - commentary, making-of, something of that sort.  How director/producer Herbert Ross, Dennis Potter and the production team got MGM to finance and release a $22 million (lots of dough at the time) musical in 1981...that'd be an interesting story.  Especially since the film was a flop, putting another nail in the lid of the genre.  Alas it still hasn't attained enough cult popularity for a deluxe presentation.

293623,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6302049040,Nix Pix,"[2, 4]","Director, Herbert Ross' ""Pennies From Heaven"" (1981) is the enchanting musical remake and amalgamation of the 1936 Bing Crosby film vehicle of the same name, and inspired by Dennis Potter's 1978 BBC miniseries starring Bob Hoskin. That it was ill received upon its initial release, and failed to find an audience eagerly applauding from their seats, speaks to the fact that musicals were sadly out of vogue during the 80s and that stylistically - realism was prided over fantasy.  Ironically, the central appeal of this remake lies in its nostalgic commitment to a repertoire of songs that betrayed the conventions of pop culture circa 1981. And the dance sequences, accompanied by lip synced vocals, are nevertheless first rate and staged with a vitality and brilliance not seen on the screen since the golden age of Busby Berkeley.The juxtaposition of the harsh socio-economic conditions of the Great Depression with the escapist effervescence fueling its popular music, layer an absurdity in spectacle onto everyday lives mired in dismal grime - adultery, prostitution, unemployment, poverty and murder. These quandaries are magically teleported into eye-candied enchantment. Each musical number mounts its 30s Hollywood kitsch until the dichotomy between fantasy and reality reaches an impossible split. The results are dark, but dazzling, flawed, yet fascinating; a character study mounted on cardboard and sour cream, a downer - perhaps, but always with a song in its heart.Steve Martin stars as Arthur Parker, a '30s-era traveling sheet-music salesman whose marriage to Joan (Jessica Harper) mirrors the bleakness of Depression ridden Chicago. After suggesting to Joan that she go the route of a sultry tart - and having the idea coldly rejected, Arthur embarks on an ill fated affair with teacher, Eileen (Bernadette Peters). The ensnarement of Arthur's bitter marriage is contrasted by the exuberant versatility he shares in his passion with Eileen. However the m&eacute;nage a trois becomes increasing complex as Joan gravitates closer to Arthur's ideal and Eileen becomes more like the old Joan. Worse, Eileen becomes pregnant - a consequence doomed to tragedy in the end.Martin's performance is perhaps one of his best; a bizarrely conflicted, gentile and greedy showman who secretly lusts for the naughty, guilty little pleasures that his song book of dreams never quite alludes to. Arthur's own perversions mirror those of The Accordion Man (Vernel Barneris) an optimist turned rapist and murderer after his affections for a blind girl are thwarted. At first maligned by Arthur, The Accordion Man is treated to dinner as something of a half hearted apology. This sequence segues into the film's most glorious production number.  Barneris' fluid motions and miming of Arthur Tracy's Pennies from Heaven creates a slow-mo cascade of coinage from the sky - a symbolic prelude of the darkness that is to come to all their lives.Warner's transfer is something of a disappointment. In previous releases the film exhibited a very grainy and very soft image. Though this DVD incarnation is anamorphic, both of these characteristics continue to exist in the image. Colors can, at times, be rich and vibrant. Overall the picture suffers from a harsh visual quality in which blacks are not very solid and contrast levels are poorly rendered. Occasionally there is a bit of edge enhancement that crops up as well as some pixelization but these do not distract. Also, certain scenes are more softly focused than others. The audio has been remixed and cleaned up. Although there's no getting around the fact that these improvements still represent a very dated audio characteristic, the vintage of the film itself, as well as the original recordings used for the production numbers, should discount whatever misgivings a true audiophile may have. Extras include a commemorative featurette with stars reminiscing, as well as scene specific commentary track provided by film critic, Peter Rainer.",3,A SURREAL MUSICAL LET-DOWN - TRANSFER NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT!,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,3994,"['Director', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', '1981', 'enchanting', 'musical', 'remake', 'amalgamation', '1936', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'film', 'vehicle', 'same', 'name', 'inspired', 'Dennis', 'Potter', '1978', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'starring', 'Bob', 'Hoskin', 'was', 'ill', 'received', 'initial', 'release', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'eagerly', 'applauding', 'seats', 'speaks', 'fact', 'musicals', 'were', 'sadly', 'vogue', '80s', 'stylistically', 'realism', 'was', 'prided', 'fantasy', 'Ironically', 'central', 'appeal', 'remake', 'nostalgic', 'commitment', 'repertoire', 'songs', 'betrayed', 'conventions', 'pop', 'culture', 'circa', '1981', 'dance', 'sequences', 'accompanied', 'lip', 'synced', 'vocals', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'first', 'rate', 'staged', 'vitality', 'brilliance', 'not', 'seen', 'screen', 'golden', 'age', 'Busby', 'Berkeley.The', 'juxtaposition', 'harsh', 'socio-economic', 'conditions', 'Great', 'Depression', 'escapist', 'effervescence', 'fueling', 'popular', 'music', 'layer', 'absurdity', 'spectacle', 'everyday', 'lives', 'mired', 'dismal', 'grime', 'adultery', 'prostitution', 'unemployment', 'poverty', 'murder', 'quandaries', 'are', 'magically', 'teleported', 'eye-candied', 'enchantment', 'musical', 'number', 'mounts', '30s', 'Hollywood', 'kitsch', 'dichotomy', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'impossible', 'split', 'results', 'are', 'dark', 'dazzling', 'flawed', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'mounted', 'cardboard', 'sour', 'cream', 'downer', 'perhaps', 'always', 'song', 'heart.Steve', 'Martin', 'Arthur', 'Parker', ""'30s-era"", 'traveling', 'sheet-music', 'salesman', 'marriage', 'Joan', 'Jessica', 'Harper', 'bleakness', 'Depression', 'ridden', 'Chicago', 'suggesting', 'Joan', 'go', 'route', 'sultry', 'tart', 'having', 'idea', 'coldly', 'rejected', 'Arthur', 'ill', 'fated', 'affair', 'teacher', 'Eileen', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'ensnarement', 'Arthur', 'bitter', 'marriage', 'contrasted', 'exuberant', 'versatility', 'shares', 'passion', 'Eileen', 'However', 'm', 'eacute', 'trois', 'becomes', 'increasing', 'complex', 'Joan', 'closer', 'Arthur', 'ideal', 'Eileen', 'becomes', 'more', 'old', 'Joan', 'Worse', 'Eileen', 'pregnant', 'consequence', 'doomed', 'tragedy', 'end.Martin', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'bizarrely', 'conflicted', 'gentile', 'greedy', 'showman', 'who', 'secretly', 'naughty', 'guilty', 'little', 'pleasures', 'song', 'book', 'dreams', 'never', 'quite', 'alludes', 'Arthur', 'own', 'perversions', 'mirror', 'Accordion', 'Man', 'Vernel', 'Barneris', 'optimist', 'turned', 'rapist', 'murderer', 'affections', 'blind', 'girl', 'are', 'thwarted', 'first', 'maligned', 'Arthur', 'Accordion', 'Man', 'treated', 'dinner', 'something', 'half', 'hearted', 'apology', 'sequence', 'film', 'most', 'glorious', 'production', 'number', 'Barneris', 'fluid', 'motions', 'miming', 'Arthur', 'Tracy', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'slow-mo', 'cascade', 'coinage', 'sky', 'symbolic', 'prelude', 'darkness', 'come', 'lives.Warner', 'transfer', 'something', 'disappointment', 'previous', 'releases', 'film', 'exhibited', 'very', 'grainy', 'very', 'soft', 'image', 'DVD', 'incarnation', 'anamorphic', 'characteristics', 'continue', 'exist', 'image', 'Colors', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'picture', 'suffers', 'harsh', 'visual', 'quality', 'blacks', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'solid', 'contrast', 'levels', 'are', 'poorly', 'rendered', 'Occasionally', 'bit', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'pixelization', 'do', 'not', 'distract', 'Also', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'softly', 'focused', 'others', 'audio', 'been', 'remixed', 'cleaned', 'up', 'getting', 'fact', 'improvements', 'still', 'represent', 'very', 'dated', 'audio', 'characteristic', 'vintage', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'recordings', 'used', 'production', 'numbers', 'should', 'discount', 'misgivings', 'true', 'audiophile', 'may', 'have', 'Extras', 'include', 'commemorative', 'featurette', 'stars', 'reminiscing', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentary', 'track', 'provided', 'film', 'critic', 'Peter', 'Rainer']",N/A

But the film is a musical tragedy, and it turned off a lot of audiences of the time, particularly since the actors lip-synch the ghostly voices of 1930s stars like Bing Crosby. Martin physically inhabits the character even if his line readings are a trifle flat. Harper (ubiquitous in the early 1980s) and Peters are riveting. Probably the best-remembered sequence is Christopher Walken's amazing number as a singing, dancing pimp, which is worth the price of the DVD alone.

293628,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,6302049040,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","I don't usually seek out musicals, but this one was quite an experience.  First off, those who don't particularly like musicals probably won't think twice about seeing this, but it is worth a watch.  Now, onto what I liked about the film.  I thought that the musical selections were incredible, and there wasn't a single song I didn't like.  Perhaps I'm biased because I love music from this era, but whatever.  I also loved the set design, costumes and choreography which I thought was amazing.  It was like a Fred Astaire musical, but in color, if I had to make a comparison (even though I've only seen clips of Astaire).  And the schoolteacher he meets is like his Ginger Rogers (with shades of Jean Harlow and Mae West).  Another thing I thought was ingenious was the way in which the musical numbers were presented.  Instead of happening directly within the story, which most of the time takes you out of the cinematic experience (after all, who really breaks into song in real life?), they present all but one of the songs as fantasy/dream sequences which are obviously lip-synched.  This is probably the greatest innovation the film makes.  Other than that, I noticed little things (aided by internet research while I watched it), like a recreation of Edward Hopper's Nighthawks painting in one scene.  The title is taken from a 1936 Irving Berlin musical and song (which I might want to check out, although the movie itself was adapted from a British miniseries), and one scene features two of the main characters recreating a scene from a Fred Astaire musical.  There's also a scene where Christopher Walken gives an impressive dance (and striptease).  Hell, the entire cast gives great dancing performances.  One scene I liked in particular involved a teacher and her class full of schoolchildren.  However, I get to what isn't so great about the film.  For one, Steve Martin's character is a philanderer, habitual liar and all-around jackass who, if it weren't for his optimistic musings, would be pretty hard to get behind and root for.  I didn't feel that many of the characters outside of the main three really had any depth to them whatsoever.  Arthur's wife, in particular, got short shrift in this respect.  Also, without the musical numbers, the movie would be goddamn depressing.  In fact, the movie just gets more depressing as it goes along and more bad things happen to the principal characters.  This makes the musical numbers even more of a necessity because these eventually are the only uplifting moments in the film.  Perhaps, this is trying to say something about the nature of music in life, that it brings happiness and joy into what is essentially a dull and heartbreaking experience (and set, literally, in the Great Depression).  If so, then it made its point very well.  This brings me to the end (SPOILER!), which I felt was kind of a cheat in a way.  It spent the entire movie building on this depression, and then it opts to end it happily.

293632,A37S3ACL57LN62,6302049040,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[3, 8]","The idea for Pennies From Heaven was a good one. The film makers decided to use 20s and 30s standards that suited the scenes that the actors would lipsync and dance to. The music scenes are the best part of the film. The idea of using popular music from the time period to illustrate the moods and feelings of the people who could not otherwise express themselves is really original. The men sometimes mouth the words to women's voices and vice versa, but cheesiness is expected of a musical. This strangeness is not too strange as to make the film unwatchable. Other elements contribute to it's downfall.The movie revolves around a man who is dissatisfied with his mundane life. He leaves his wife one day and steals her money in order to sell sheet music to stores and make a fortune. He meets a beautiful schoolteacher who he corrupts, gets pregnant, and leaves to return to his wife. The schoolteacher is fired from her job, has an abortion, and turns to prostitution. The man returns to her and they proclaim their love for each other while the man is accused of a crime he did not commit. The story is rather tired and standard. One would think the music would make up for it. However, there are more problems than just a dull story.The 1930s style that was employed was successful in costumes and music, but the flow of the story was not very similar to films of the era. The reactions of the characters to each other should have been edited down more to make the film more basic. It is a very long film but the story is quite simple.The cast is great. Unfortunately, after the success of Steve Martin in The Jerk, audiences thought that this movie would be the same. The casting of Bernadette Peters, an exceptional Broadway star, aided this misconception. The film is actually a drama, not a comedy. However, the cast does well with what they are given. Jessica Harper as the wife performs quite well in a subtle understated way. Steve Martin is a bit disappointing and Bernadette Peters performs at her usual level (which is rather high compared to most). Christopher Walken even makes a small appearance.The extra feature on the DVD is a home-videoed recording of some of the cast and crew answering questions from a very flustered interviewer. The setting is informal which makes those being interviewed more candid and relaxed. However, the interviewer hinders the segment.Overall, this film could have been better. What makes this movie even sound appealing and different is the strange use of music.",3,"Good Idea, Mediocre Execution",1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,2514,"['idea', 'Pennies', 'From', 'Heaven', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'film', 'makers', 'decided', 'use', '20s', '30s', 'standards', 'suited', 'scenes', 'actors', 'would', 'lipsync', 'dance', 'music', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'idea', 'using', 'popular', 'music', 'time', 'period', 'illustrate', 'moods', 'feelings', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'otherwise', 'express', 'really', 'original', 'men', 'sometimes', 'mouth', 'words', 'women', 'voices', 'vice', 'versa', 'cheesiness', 'expected', 'musical', 'strangeness', 'not', 'too', 'strange', 'make', 'film', 'unwatchable', 'Other', 'elements', 'contribute', 'downfall.The', 'movie', 'around', 'man', 'who', 'dissatisfied', 'mundane', 'life', 'wife', 'one', 'day', 'steals', 'money', 'order', 'sell', 'sheet', 'music', 'stores', 'make', 'fortune', 'beautiful', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'pregnant', 'return', 'wife', 'schoolteacher', 'fired', 'job', 'abortion', 'prostitution', 'man', 'proclaim', 'love', 'other', 'man', 'accused', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'story', 'rather', 'tired', 'standard', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'music', 'would', 'make', 'up', 'However', 'are', 'more', 'problems', 'just', 'dull', 'story.The', '1930s', 'style', 'was', 'employed', 'was', 'successful', 'costumes', 'music', 'flow', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'similar', 'films', 'era', 'reactions', 'characters', 'other', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'more', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'basic', 'very', 'long', 'film', 'story', 'quite', 'simple.The', 'cast', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'success', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Jerk', 'audiences', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'casting', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'exceptional', 'Broadway', 'star', 'aided', 'misconception', 'film', 'actually', 'drama', 'not', 'comedy', 'However', 'cast', 'well', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'Jessica', 'Harper', 'wife', 'quite', 'well', 'subtle', 'understated', 'way', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'performs', 'usual', 'level', 'rather', 'high', 'compared', 'most', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'even', 'small', 'appearance.The', 'extra', 'feature', 'DVD', 'home-videoed', 'recording', 'cast', 'crew', 'answering', 'questions', 'very', 'flustered', 'interviewer', 'setting', 'informal', 'being', 'interviewed', 'more', 'candid', 'relaxed', 'However', 'interviewer', 'segment.Overall', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'What', 'movie', 'even', 'sound', 'appealing', 'different', 'strange', 'use', 'music']",N/A

293634,A2D63RN5LF14R2,6302049040,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[1, 1]","Steve Martin burst onto the national radar with his comedy album &#8220;A Wild and Crazy Guy&#8221; (1978). He followed that success by starring in his first feature film, the box office bonanza The Jerk (1979) directed by Carl Reiner and co-starring his then-current flame, Bernadette Peters. Although The Jerk was merely crass instead of authentically humorous, Martin and Peters re-teamed for Herbert Ross&#8217; winningly experimental Pennies From Heaven (1981). Predictably, American audiences smelled something new with the film, and stayed away. Many critics were more astute and praised the film, which prompted Martin and Reiner to briefly follow that attempted path of originality in Dead Men Don&#8217;t Wear Plaid (1982) and Man With Two Brains (1983). Alas, like the rest of that decade, what started in a burst of creative energy petered out midway through and succumbed to formula.Paralleling the rise and fall of the 1980s was Martin&#8217;s work as an interesting artist. He simply ceased to take chances after his role as the dentist in Little Shop of Horrors (1986) and rendered himself irrelevant. In contrast, Peters continued to challenge herself, instead of taking the safe route. It is her post Pennies career, rather than Martin&#8217;s, which is more consistently satisfying.Pennies from Heaven is an idiosyncratic and delightfully grim film, and it separates authentic critics from the weak-kneed boys by defying the rules of filmmaking and confounding those who expect dogmatic adherence to genre expectations (with due apologies to Mr. Ebert). It startles us even today and seems as fresh and innovative as it did thirty years ago.Dennis Potter wrote the screenplay, which sprang from his 1978 BBC mini-series of the same name. As in his later script for Dreamchild (1985), Potter achieves a level of unsettling emotional intensity rarely achieved in the medium. Potter and Ross recreate a mythological Depression era, lifted straight from the haunting canvases of Edward Hopper, giving the film its unique texture.Arthur (Martin) is a down on his luck sheet music salesman trying to ply his wares in a corrupt world. Compounding his frustration is his downright Victorian marriage to Joan (Jessica Harper). When Arthur encounters the uninhibited Eileen (Peters), he is not above lying about his marital status.The characters lip-synch to songs from 1930s musicals and, surprisingly, it works. Often, Pennies From Heaven supersedes its source material because&#8212;let&#8217;s be frank&#8212;do any of us ever watch period musicals for their emotional depth or narrative substance?A web of lies, back alley abortions, and the rape and the murder of a blind girl are not going to add up to an Astaire/Rogers happy ending. (Arthur and Eileen even take the place of that famous duo by literally stepping into a scene from 1936&#8242;s Follow the Fleet). Christopher Walken has an all too brief scene, doing a slimy striptease as only he can. Martin is refreshingly subdued. We root for him and Eileen, despite his manipulations. Harper is equally good, and it&#8217;s a revelation of some kind that her character in 1981 is not the one we are asked to identify with or root for, as we would have fifty years earlier.Pennies From Heaven was a gutsy movie in 1981. It still is, never once succumbing to bland and pretentious realism, while at the same time never alienating us emotionally. Ross, Potter, Martin, Peters, Harper, and Walken all proved that the good and original musical had not gone the way of the dinosaur. Alas, it took European audiences to respond to them.",5,When Steve Martin took risks,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,3600,"['Steve', 'Martin', 'burst', 'national', 'radar', 'comedy', 'album', '8220', 'Wild', 'Crazy', 'Guy', '8221', '1978', 'followed', 'success', 'starring', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'bonanza', 'Jerk', '1979', 'directed', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'co-starring', 'then-current', 'flame', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Jerk', 'was', 'merely', 'crass', 'instead', 'authentically', 'humorous', 'Martin', 'Peters', 're-teamed', 'Herbert', 'Ross', '8217', 'winningly', 'experimental', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', '1981', 'Predictably', 'American', 'audiences', 'smelled', 'something', 'new', 'film', 'stayed', 'away', 'Many', 'critics', 'were', 'more', 'astute', 'praised', 'film', 'prompted', 'Martin', 'Reiner', 'briefly', 'follow', 'attempted', 'path', 'originality', 'Dead', 'Men', 'Don', '8217', 'Wear', 'Plaid', '1982', 'Two', 'Brains', '1983', 'Alas', 'rest', 'decade', 'what', 'started', 'burst', 'creative', 'energy', 'petered', 'out', 'midway', 'succumbed', 'formula.Paralleling', 'rise', 'fall', '1980s', 'was', 'Martin', '8217', 's', 'work', 'interesting', 'artist', 'simply', 'ceased', 'take', 'chances', 'role', 'dentist', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', '1986', 'rendered', 'irrelevant', 'contrast', 'Peters', 'continued', 'challenge', 'instead', 'taking', 'safe', 'route', 'post', 'Pennies', 'career', 'rather', 'Martin', '8217', 's', 'more', 'consistently', 'satisfying.Pennies', 'Heaven', 'idiosyncratic', 'delightfully', 'grim', 'film', 'authentic', 'critics', 'weak-kneed', 'boys', 'defying', 'rules', 'filmmaking', 'confounding', 'who', 'expect', 'dogmatic', 'adherence', 'genre', 'expectations', 'due', 'apologies', 'Mr.', 'Ebert', 'even', 'today', 'fresh', 'innovative', 'did', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago.Dennis', 'Potter', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'sprang', '1978', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'same', 'name', 'later', 'script', 'Dreamchild', '1985', 'Potter', 'level', 'unsettling', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'rarely', 'achieved', 'medium', 'Potter', 'Ross', 'recreate', 'mythological', 'Depression', 'era', 'lifted', 'straight', 'haunting', 'canvases', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'giving', 'film', 'unique', 'texture.Arthur', 'Martin', 'down', 'luck', 'sheet', 'music', 'salesman', 'trying', 'ply', 'wares', 'corrupt', 'world', 'Compounding', 'frustration', 'downright', 'Victorian', 'marriage', 'Joan', 'Jessica', 'Harper', 'When', 'Arthur', 'uninhibited', 'Eileen', 'Peters', 'not', 'lying', 'marital', 'status.The', 'characters', 'lip-synch', 'songs', '1930s', 'musicals', 'surprisingly', 'Often', 'Pennies', 'From', 'Heaven', 'source', 'material', '8212', 'let', '8217', 'be', 'frank', '8212', 'do', 'ever', 'watch', 'period', 'musicals', 'emotional', 'depth', 'narrative', 'substance', 'web', 'lies', 'back', 'alley', 'abortions', 'rape', 'murder', 'blind', 'girl', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'add', 'up', 'Astaire/Rogers', 'happy', 'ending', 'Arthur', 'Eileen', 'even', 'take', 'place', 'famous', 'duo', 'literally', 'stepping', 'scene', '1936', '8242', 'Fleet', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'too', 'brief', 'scene', 'doing', 'slimy', 'striptease', 'only', 'can', 'Martin', 'refreshingly', 'subdued', 'root', 'Eileen', 'manipulations', 'Harper', 'equally', 'good', '8217', 's', 'revelation', 'kind', 'character', '1981', 'not', 'one', 'are', 'asked', 'identify', 'root', 'would', 'have', 'fifty', 'years', 'Heaven', 'was', 'gutsy', 'movie', '1981', 'still', 'never', 'once', 'succumbing', 'bland', 'pretentious', 'realism', 'same', 'time', 'never', 'alienating', 'emotionally', 'Ross', 'Potter', 'Martin', 'Peters', 'Harper', 'Walken', 'proved', 'good', 'original', 'musical', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'way', 'dinosaur', 'Alas', 'took', 'European', 'audiences', 'respond']",N/A

And yes, I know that he couldn't go playing The Jerk for movie after movie. Nor was he going to be The Wild & Crazy Guy. And sure, I can respect him for trying to take on a dramatic role - something which all comedians are forced to do eventually with mixed results.But this movie is thoroughly rotten from beginning to end. Steve Martin isn't so much emoting as whining throughout the piece. He's a down on his luck traveling salesman that meets Bernadette Peters and has a bad romance with her. He leaves her. She becomes a prostitute and then he gets executed for a murder he didn't commit simply because he encountered both victim and murderer early in the film.If that was all there was to the movie, I would have never put it on my netflix queue. However there are the musical numbers. And that's really what I was going for. Sadly, all the musical numbers are lip synched pieces. You don't get the real actors. You get seriously mismatched voices coming out of their mouths whenever they have to sing. While in some cases that's the point (the three salesman are singing in female voices after all) it's still off-putting.What's worse is the fact that they didn't even allow Bernadette Peters or Christopher Walken to sing their own songs. Both of whom have much stronger voices than the canned music coming out of their mouths. Now granted, Bernadette Peters had yet to take over Broadway as the woman that stars in everything, but Walken was a trained song and dance man. He gets to dance. He doesn't get to sing.
