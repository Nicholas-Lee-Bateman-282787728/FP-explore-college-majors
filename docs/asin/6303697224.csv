For most of it, I had thought 8 Seconds as a Dylan McKay's film and probably the only noticeable film of his career. Eventually, Luke Perry was faced with the truth that he had no talent for acting and begged himself back to a guest star treatment on Beverly Hills, 90210. As for 8 Seconds, it was a very unfocused picture, never trying to let any issue to be  focal point. It's just a series of incidents going through the motions although I was surprised at the death of the star a bit early because I wasn't expecting it. Finally, the closing credits were rolled, showing the life of Lane Frost in still photographs and video clips, arguably the highlight of the entire picture. Although John G. Avildsen directed 8 Seconds, I had higher hopes, considering what he did with Rocky and Lean on Me. If I had to pick the best rodeo picture made, it was Junior Bonner. There was no comparison with 8 Seconds. Some of the facts of Lane Frost's life were inexplicably distorted in the film. All in all, 8 Seconds was actually not that bad; good enough to be seen on any rainy Sunday afternoon but beware of the corny scenes.",3,A Sometimes Cheesy But Passable Film.,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,1253,"['Viewed', '1/13Rate', '51/13', 'Prior', '8', 'Seconds', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'biography', 'real', 'rodeo', 'competitor', 'ending', 'most', 'had', 'thought', '8', 'Seconds', 'Dylan', 'McKay', 'film', 'probably', 'only', 'noticeable', 'film', 'career', 'Eventually', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'was', 'faced', 'truth', 'had', 'talent', 'acting', 'begged', 'back', 'guest', 'star', 'treatment', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', '8', 'Seconds', 'was', 'very', 'unfocused', 'picture', 'never', 'trying', 'let', 'issue', 'be', 'focal', 'point', 'just', 'series', 'incidents', 'going', 'motions', 'was', 'surprised', 'death', 'star', 'bit', 'early', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Finally', 'closing', 'credits', 'were', 'rolled', 'showing', 'life', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'still', 'photographs', 'video', 'clips', 'arguably', 'highlight', 'entire', 'picture', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'directed', '8', 'Seconds', 'had', 'higher', 'hopes', 'considering', 'what', 'did', 'Rocky', 'Lean', 'Me', 'had', 'pick', 'best', 'rodeo', 'picture', 'made', 'was', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'was', 'comparison', '8', 'Seconds', 'facts', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'life', 'were', 'inexplicably', 'distorted', 'film', '8', 'Seconds', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'seen', 'rainy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'beware', 'corny', 'scenes']",8 Seconds VHS
385481,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,6303697224,a voice of reason,"[3, 4]","I bought '8 Seconds' expecting to see a movie filled with rodeo action and rodeo life. I got an adequate helping of that, but I also got a whole lot more of something I didn't expect: an interesting movie about a man's relationships with the most important people in his life.It's interesting to see how Lane Frost was driven to become a champion because he looked up to his father, who had also been a champion rodeo cowboy. The problem for Frost was that his father was never happy with anything less than perfect and, even as great as Lane was, he still wasn't perfect enough. Without his father's approval or encouragement, the championships took on a much lesser meaning than they should have had for Lane Frost, and throughout the film we see how tortured he is by the idea that his father isn't proud of him. After Lane's death, his father laments the fact that he can't remember ever telling Lane that he loved him. The movie makes a powerful statement about the affect that fathers have on their sons.We also see the effect that long absences have on a marriage as both Lane and his wife, Kellie, become involved in adulterous affairs. Thankfully, the movie makers spare us the graphic details (i.e. no gratuitous sex scenes) and focus on the impact that their actions have on their consciences and their interactions with each other. Through it all, even through the adulterous one-night stands, it's obvious that Lane loved Kellie. The movie accurately portrays a man who tried to be good but who was flawed, which makes it realistic and far better than the idealized portraits of celebrities that movies often provide.Lastly, we also see Lane's friendships with Tuff Hedeman and Cody Lambert. Obviously this is where the rodeo action comes in, but we also see how they bonded as friends, in spite of being competitors, through many long hours on the road, sharing beds in fleabag motels, and riding in every rodeo they could enter. Hedeman's ride for Frost at the end of the movie is a touching tribute to his fallen friend.None of the relationships get the in-depth treatment that is sometimes seen in films about parent and child, husband and wife, or best friends, but each of them is developed enough that we genuinely feel like we've come to know something about Lane Frost and the people who were close to him. Oh, and that rodeo action, it's actually pretty good, too.Due to the profanity (to me, always unnecessary and unfortunate), bar scenes, and adultery (mentioned but not shown - I give credit to the filmmakers for this), this one is not recommended for youngsters. For the adult crowd, it's a good one though, even if you're not a rodeo fan.",4,Relationships and rodeo make quite a combination in this film,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,2668,"['bought', '8', 'Seconds', 'expecting', 'see', 'movie', 'filled', 'rodeo', 'action', 'rodeo', 'life', 'got', 'adequate', 'helping', 'also', 'got', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'interesting', 'movie', 'man', 'relationships', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'life.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'was', 'driven', 'become', 'champion', 'looked', 'up', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'champion', 'rodeo', 'cowboy', 'problem', 'Frost', 'was', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'happy', 'anything', 'less', 'perfect', 'even', 'as', 'great', 'Lane', 'was', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'enough', 'father', 'approval', 'encouragement', 'championships', 'took', 'much', 'lesser', 'meaning', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'tortured', 'idea', 'father', ""n't"", 'proud', 'Lane', 'death', 'father', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'telling', 'Lane', 'loved', 'movie', 'powerful', 'statement', 'affect', 'fathers', 'have', 'sons.We', 'also', 'see', 'effect', 'long', 'absences', 'have', 'marriage', 'Lane', 'wife', 'Kellie', 'become', 'involved', 'adulterous', 'affairs', 'Thankfully', 'movie', 'makers', 'spare', 'graphic', 'details', 'i.e', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'focus', 'impact', 'actions', 'have', 'consciences', 'interactions', 'other', 'even', 'adulterous', 'one-night', 'stands', 'obvious', 'Lane', 'loved', 'Kellie', 'movie', 'accurately', 'man', 'who', 'tried', 'be', 'good', 'who', 'was', 'flawed', 'realistic', 'far', 'better', 'idealized', 'portraits', 'celebrities', 'movies', 'often', 'provide.Lastly', 'also', 'see', 'Lane', 'friendships', 'Tuff', 'Hedeman', 'Cody', 'Lambert', 'Obviously', 'where', 'rodeo', 'action', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'bonded', 'friends', 'spite', 'being', 'competitors', 'many', 'long', 'hours', 'road', 'sharing', 'beds', 'fleabag', 'motels', 'riding', 'rodeo', 'could', 'enter', 'Hedeman', 'ride', 'Frost', 'end', 'movie', 'touching', 'tribute', 'fallen', 'friend.None', 'relationships', 'get', 'in-depth', 'treatment', 'sometimes', 'seen', 'films', 'parent', 'child', 'husband', 'wife', 'best', 'friends', 'developed', 'enough', 'genuinely', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'something', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'close', 'Oh', 'rodeo', 'action', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'too.Due', 'profanity', 'always', 'unnecessary', 'unfortunate', 'bar', 'scenes', 'adultery', 'mentioned', 'not', 'shown', 'give', 'credit', 'filmmakers', 'one', 'not', 'recommended', 'youngsters', 'adult', 'crowd', 'good', 'one', 'though', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'rodeo', 'fan']",8 Seconds VHS

Although it wasn't a box office hit and is slammed by most  critics (who don't speak for the majority anyway) this film is a success.  It doesn't canonise Frost, instead it portrays him the way he undoubtedly  was - as a decent but flawed human being, who like the rest of us, wasn't  perfect but had a good personality and a good heart.

This video is about a man named Lane Frost {Luke Perry -- ""Beverly Hills: 90210"" & Normal Life} who was born to ride. He rode a bucking bull. An awsome soundtrack by top country and western artists including Vince Gill & Reba McEntire, was add to the intensity of this action-packed story of a man who was born to ride. ...This is a good video and I loved it? This is a great real rodeo movie of a rodeo legend named Lane Frost.With a new focus on the future of the sport and a rich history to form a solid base those heading to Las Vegas have every reason to feel optimistic about the 49th Wrangler NFR in 2007! Two things you wont want to miss 49th Wrangler NFR 2007 and your own copy to enjoy for years to come FOREVER, AS If you enjoy the traditions of the old west, that turned a dare between ranch hands so many years ago into a highly entertaining spectator sport....this DVD of ""wrangler NFR 2007(2007 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo)5pk"" is for you to own FOREVER! Karl is taking the helm at a time when the PRCA has been forced by circumstances to take a close look at their organization and the future of rodeo and the results have been a new positive look at the future. Rodeo like all sports continues to produce extremely talented athletes and the stock contractors are raising bucking horses and bulls from breeding programs that just continue to produce top quality buckers. Word around the rodeo circuit is that this is set to be one of the best events in the history of the PRCA. Several exciting events have happened within the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association since the NFR. All good! There is a new man at the helm of the association, Karl Stressman. Karl is certainly not new to the sport of rodeo and to what it takes to put on a top-notch event.I'll live forever everyday in 2007 and 2009, and thank goodness there'll be another 2007 and 2009 someday again, YAHOO, I get to live forever in 2007 and 2009, which means thank goodness I pick my top best two favorites years to live with and repeat forever and ever for years and years to come, as there'll be another 2007 and 2009 again someday forever, YAHOO :) My real top best favorite years I only like that will be around forever are 2007 and 2009, as I really know that one day there'll be another 2007 and another 2009, as thank goodness they'll be here again, as 2007 and 2009 are my top best two favorite years to live with and repeat forever, and thank goodness there'll be another 2007 and 2009 someday, it'll be back and I know it will be, YAHOO :) Nice great and fast quick hands, as I really love calf roping and this is my favorite event forever at the NFR, and this event ROCKS IN 2007 AT THE NFR AND 2009!

A small, enjoyable film about a real-life bronco bull rider named Lane Frost  who became a world champion in his early 20s.

Why on earth would any man want to do that for a living?  The film really showed the bone-jarring that goes on, and the very real danger once a man is off.  Lane Frost was killed before he had a chance to live.  Somehow, just to be the best at bronco bull riding, while providing entertainment for the crowds, does not seem a worthy endeavor to lose your life over.

385490,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,6303697224,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[3, 3]","After being directed by Amazon's recommendation to ""8 Seconds,"" and reading the reviews, I thought that this would be an enjoyable film and purchased it.  I am not a big rodeo fan, but I do enjoy them once in a while; and I have been friends with several bull riders.  While I enjoyed the film, I cannot say that it really helped me to know more about Lane Frost (portrayed by Luke Perry), his life, career, his relationships with other performers, or his marriage.  Indeed, after watching the film, I found myself looking up more information about Lane Frost on the internet to help me make more sense out of the movie.What I missed most in the film was the sense of Lane's apparent true love for both his wife and for bull riding.  They are essentially implied; that is, the viewer must assume them or ""look between the lines.""  This may, to a degree, be caused by the director's inability to do so without changing the rating of the film; (but really is something that could have been done without changing the rating if they wanted to do so).  Also, several of the best songs, in my opinion, were wasted on the credits rather than integrated into the film.  If you are a big fan of bull riding or extreme sports, I am sure you will enjoy ""8 Seconds,"" but if you are looking for a good biopic, this film falls flat.On the other hand, I found the cinematography to be outstanding, and while both Luke Perry and Cynthia Geary (who plays Kellie Frost, Lane's wife) give believable performances, the ""chemistry"" between them was just not there, as far as I am concerned.  Moreover, I feel that the pace of the film was too fast regarding key events and themes, preferring to spend more ""film"" time on the actual ""bull riding.""  I do not think that ""8 Seconds"" has too many bull riding scenes--indeed I think it would have helped to have had more scenes of Lane's ""bad"" rides--but rather that ""8 Seconds"" needs more depth to the other scenes.  I guess, in the final analysis, what I am saying is that the film was edited to be only 105 minutes, when it should have been longer.  Hence, I feel, in the end, that ""8 Seconds"" is a good movie, but not quite as good as other reviewers have rated it.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

385491,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6303697224,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","8 SECONDS (1994) is a film I never saw before, in spite of about a hundred folks telling me to watch it over the years. My little brother was particularly moved by this film, probably because he knew the late bull rider Lane Frost (played by the ethereal and beautiful Luke Perry) - many of us watch rodeo, my brother and I particularly enjoy the bull riders. My title review is, as I understand it, a famous bull rider joke and is told in the film ... though it is tough to catch and tougher to understand.While I was captivated to see the story of Lane Frost, about whom I knew nothing, I have to say I was a bit let down seeing this kind of sanitized cowboy-soap/horse opera. With dialogue that perhaps only Oklahoma natives and a few others can understand, plus the rodeo-speak, well ... it's as specialized as an Australian outback movie.The music may have been top shelf in the early 1990s but it hasn't aged well. It really slows the film in my opinion, because music should in fact play the same role it does in opera. Here it just seems like a silly Japanese jingle machine, rattling away during many of the key scenes. I wouldn't know, but I suspect Frost himself would not have liked that.This film was directed by the strange and uneven John G. Avildsen, for whom I harbor terribly mixed feelings for giving the world the original KARATE KID then ruining it in one sequel. His only other credits of note besides this and the KARATE KID I - III is the original ROCKY and ROCKY V. Rocky indeed - his directing, that is.Perry is very young, competent, sweet and adorable in this role. Perry has been a long-lost love of mine; his only other film appearance of note was a bit part in THE FIFTH ELEMENT as Billy, an ancestor of Bruce Willis. It always seemed to me Perry has been cheated out of a richly deserved film career.As for Frost, I know I've seen the statue of him up in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Nice.Even the odious Steve Baldwin as Richard ""Tuff"" Hedeman is pretty good here. (Maybe I'm imagining it, but I seem to recall seeing Tuff ride. As the movie tells us, Tuff has a son named Lane, and maybe I am imagining it too, but I think I've also seen Lane Hedeman ride.) In any case, if you love Lane Frost, rodeo, bull riders, cowboys or just for the heck of it, aw, shucks, well then git this dang thang and enjoy!",4,"""I heard you jumped off in 8 seconds and threw yer hat in the air!!""",1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,2327,"['8', 'SECONDS', '1994', 'film', 'never', 'saw', 'spite', 'hundred', 'folks', 'telling', 'watch', 'years', 'little', 'brother', 'was', 'particularly', 'moved', 'film', 'probably', 'knew', 'late', 'bull', 'rider', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'played', 'ethereal', 'beautiful', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'many', 'watch', 'rodeo', 'brother', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'bull', 'riders', 'title', 'review', 'understand', 'famous', 'bull', 'rider', 'joke', 'told', 'film', 'tough', 'catch', 'tougher', 'understand.While', 'was', 'captivated', 'see', 'story', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'whom', 'knew', 'nothing', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'seeing', 'kind', 'sanitized', 'cowboy-soap/horse', 'opera', 'dialogue', 'perhaps', 'only', 'Oklahoma', 'natives', 'few', 'others', 'can', 'understand', 'rodeo-speak', 'well', 'as', 'specialized', 'Australian', 'outback', 'movie.The', 'music', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'shelf', 'early', '1990s', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'really', 'film', 'opinion', 'music', 'should', 'fact', 'play', 'same', 'role', 'opera', 'Here', 'just', 'silly', 'Japanese', 'jingle', 'machine', 'rattling', 'away', 'many', 'key', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'suspect', 'Frost', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'liked', 'that.This', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'strange', 'uneven', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'whom', 'harbor', 'terribly', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'giving', 'world', 'original', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'then', 'ruining', 'one', 'sequel', 'only', 'other', 'credits', 'note', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'III', 'original', 'ROCKY', 'ROCKY', 'V.', 'Rocky', 'indeed', 'directing', 'is.Perry', 'very', 'young', 'competent', 'sweet', 'adorable', 'role', 'Perry', 'been', 'long-lost', 'love', 'mine', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'appearance', 'note', 'was', 'bit', 'part', 'THE', 'FIFTH', 'ELEMENT', 'Billy', 'ancestor', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'always', 'seemed', 'Perry', 'been', 'cheated', 'richly', 'deserved', 'film', 'career.As', 'Frost', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'statue', 'up', 'Cheyenne', 'Wyoming', 'odious', 'Steve', 'Baldwin', 'Richard', 'Tuff', 'Hedeman', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'imagining', 'seem', 'recall', 'seeing', 'Tuff', 'ride', 'movie', 'Tuff', 'son', 'named', 'Lane', 'maybe', 'am', 'imagining', 'too', 'think', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'Lane', 'Hedeman', 'ride', 'case', 'love', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'rodeo', 'bull', 'riders', 'just', 'heck', 'aw', 'shucks', 'well', 'then', 'git', 'dang', 'thang', 'enjoy']",8 Seconds VHS

It is worth checking out the website prior to viewing the film, it does provide insights that enhance the experience of viewing the film.

Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]","I thought I'd throw this in 8 Seconds from 1994 directed by John G Avildsen after the embarrassments of Karate III & directing Rocky V which isn't all that bad but it is definitely the weakest of all 6 movies. This is 1 of his better movies. I actually saw this in the theater in back in 1994 when I was 8. Somewhere I have the VHS. It stars Luke Perry as Lane Frost, Stephen Baldwin as Tuff Hedeman, Red Mitchell as Cody Lambert I looked up to see what this guy had done & I read that he died 6 months after this movie came out in a car wreck that's sad. It also stars James Rebhorn as Clyde Frost, Carrie Snodgress as Eline Frost, Cynthia Geary as Kellie Frost & Linden Ashby as Martin Hudson. You also have special appearances by Brooks & Dunn & Vince Gill. Story is about 1 of the most popular bull riders in the late 80's Lane Frost. He & his buddies Tuff & Cody compete in these bull ridding competitions cause they all have the goal of being The World Bull Riding Champion. There Lane meets a girl named Kellie who they fall in love. You a good back & forth between the guys like when Lane gets hurt riding a bull he asks is my d  i  c  k still on. Tuff says it's hanging on by a thread. Tuff motivates Lane to continue. Eventually Lane & Kellie Marry. He wins The World Championship & the fame kind of goes to his head. We learn that Kellie had an old boyfriend which I'll get to the inaccuracies in a moment. Frost cheats on his wife with a young Renee Zellweger she was like 24 at the time. Lane & Kellie seperate Lane has certain dates to ride The Bull Red Rock. 2 out of 3 of those times he fails. Then you have some really well done acting by Luke Perry & Carrie Snodgress. He talks it out with Kellie they stay together Frost wins the 3rd time. Then we get to the finish of the movie at The Ftontier Days Rodeo where Lane rides a bull known as Takin Care Of Business. after the 8 seconds are up Lane gets off & is hit in his side by the bulls horns & he dies & the funeral scene the actors & actresses sell theiir performances. James Rebhorn he has well acted break down scene. Tuff tells Kellie that they are going to induct Lane The Hall Of Fame. Tuff competes in The National Finals where he rides Takin Care Of Business holds on & wins The World Championship he stays on an additional 8 seconds in memory of his friend. Now there were inaccuracies like Clyde Eline & Kellie were given 4 scripts the studio didn't go with the 1 the family liked the best.  Lane & Kellie never cheated on each other. They were seperated in 1988 for a brief time but got back together. Lane Frost was a Christian but the producers didn't want God put in the movie. They did stay true to Lane Frosts positive attitude the stuff about proving himself to his dad never happend he was proud of his son. There never was a guy named Martin Hudson. The day Lane Frost died no family was at the arena. Luke Perry said it bothered him how Clyde Frost was portrayed but Luke Perry put his heart in the role he did a reall good job & I don't care for  Luke Perry.  John G Avildsen did a good job. Cyintha Geary was good I bought the love story it wasn't there to fill time & bore me I cared about them. Stephen Baldwin is good. Red Mitchell was good shame he died. James Rebhorn was good, Carrie Snodgress was good. Linden Ashby was ok he's playing a character that never existed so he does his best. I 'd say check this movie out it's a shame it doesn't get talked about.

The movie has a sad story behind it & an actor died named Red Mitchell 6 months after this movie came out in August of 1994 he crossed a Blind Rail Road Crossing in a rural area he was killed instantly but his Dad lived. Of course this won't be the only movie that has a sad story behind it cause in May I am going to review  The Crow. I know about some of the inaccuracies with what happened in real life vs the movie I will talk about them a little bit throughout this retrospective but I was a little more in depth with them in my review from 2011 from my older account. Anyway the movie was made for &7 million made for $19 million in The US it was directed by John G Avildsen I am a fan of this guy he directed Rocky & Rocky V Karate Kid 1, II & the pos Karate Kid III. Maybe 1 day I will do reviews & retrospectives for all of The Rocky movies. The movie stars Luke Perry as Lane Frost, Stephen Baldwin as Tuff Hederman, Red Mitchell as Cody Lambert, Cynthia Geary as Kellie Frost, James Rebhorn as Clyde Frost & Carrie Snodgress as Elise Frost. The story starts off in 1968 where you have a young kid named Lane Frost & his Father is a Professional Bull Rider you skip ahead 25 years to where Lane is now doing it & you're introduced to his buddies Tuff Hederman & Cody Lambert. Tuff is a wise a  *  * he calls Lane a p  us  s while Cody is a laid back redneck poet. A group of characters that are fun to watch & are likable. Lane grew up looking up to his Dad & now wants to prove himself. I know that's inaccurate cause they got along great from what I have read. Anyway Lane, Tuff & Cody go to a Bull Riding Competition Lane meets this young woman named Kellie who he has his eye on she's a real likable sweetheart of a character. Lane is successful at riding this Bull when it's Tuff's turn he he's over confident & thinks he's the greatest Cowboy ever when he comes out of the gate he slips right off The Bull. I enjoy the bits of humor when they're at this bar Cody's trying to pick up women reading his poem's to them & he's trying to pick up this girl reading this poem to her & she walks off. This guy wants to buy them some beers Tuff wants to beat him up Lane plays peace maker. You have this guy who is mad at Tuff cause he thinks he's dancing with his girl Tuff punches that guy in the face they all run off get in Tuff's Car & make a run for it you have all these PO'ed drunks that have stormed out of the bar. You have all these guys pile in the bed which would be uncomfortable in more ways the 1 the next morning Tuff plays a trick on Lane to make it look like he wet the bed. At another Bull Riding Competition Lane meets up with Kellie they start to fall in love & this relationship isn't force fed like the love story between Alex Murphy & Clara Murphy in The Robobocp remake. I know I am talking about 2 totally different movies but I just am using this example cause the script in Rubberman told me I should believe they're in love but I have a brain & I didn't buy in this movie I buy they're in love so I feel it in my brain & my heart in Rubberman my head's like whatever & I don't feel it in my heart I do in my stomach it makes me sick to my stomach. You know John G Avildsen knows handle to handle these love stories in sports movies like in Rocky, Karate Kid 1 & II Karate Kid III is another story. Lane even detours from Nebraska to see Kellie & propose to her & when they kiss Tuff & Cody make fun of them not in a hateful way but you get a laugh out of it. Lane rides this Bull named Double Trouble he falls off The Bull drops 1 of his hooves between his legs. They take him to to get medical attention he asks ""Is my d  *  *  k still there?"" Tuff: ""It's hanging by a thread."" Kellie asks Cody if he's ok he tells her ""He's fine. He ain't gonna be such a romantic buckaroo for awhile but he will be fine."" Lane's talking about his situation Tuff's like yeah you should retire & he tells just before you die you'll be thinking I'm ap  *  *s. Lane's wondering why he is motivating him cause all he does is tell him how he's no good. Tuff tells him if you believe what everyone says about him then he's dumber than he thought. The next time he has to ride Double Trouble he is successful. Lane & his Dad are watching the tape of him riding Double Trouble his Dad just tells him how he can improve. Lane tells him he got 2nd place so that has to count for something no cause he is told he was just lucky that all the other Cowboys rode so poorly. He is mad & goes off to work off some anger in The Barn Kellie talks to him & she gets through to him cause she doesn't care if he is perfect then it shows later they get Married & as I said I believe this love story cause I feel it in my heart. You have a cameo by Country Singer Vince Gill who was huge in the 90's I don't know if he's still around. Brooks & Dunn make a cameo later on. If you don't like Country Music then that may be a problem if you're seeing this movie for the 1st time. I grew up with Country Music when I was real young I was really in it again in my mid teens then I fell out of Country Music in 2007 or 2008. I will still listen to a lot of the stuff from the late 80's through the 90's up until the mid 2000's. You find out that Tuff's real name is Richard he got the name Tuff when some car doors slammed on his hands when he was 4 & he didn't cry. Another bit of humor I liked is when Kellie wants to move into a home that is close to her parents Lane buys this Trailer & tells her hey it's a place close to her Parents. She's like it't the ugliest thing she's ever seen in her life. Lane goes on to win The World title. He attempts to ride Red Rock an unbeaten Bull but he fails. You have an appearance by Linden Ashby who plays this guy named Martin who was with Kellie at 1 point it causes problems between Lane & Kellie. He thinks she's cheating on him & Lane's on the road a lot they're away from each other & Kellie does cheats on Lane with Martin & while Lane is out promoting merchandise he cheats on his Wife with this Buckle Bunny who is played by Renee Zellweger which was an early role for her & also none of this happened it was just drama added in for the movie. Meanwhile Tuff & Cody are waiting for Lane he has the keys & Cody reads off a poem called ""Waiting On Lane"" ""We've been waiting on lane ever since we can recall we started in April it's coming on Fall. We have us a bite we have a chew we get us some shut eye have us brew. Someone's taking his picture someone's wanting a loan he's kissing the babies or he's on thed*  *n phone. But we'll keep on waiting though we ain't pleased cause The World Champion Bull Rider's got the van keys."" Tuff knows what Lane did. Lane challenges Red Rock at 3 Competition's in reality it was 7 & he won 4 of them. Kellie isn't happy he just wants the attention she ends up telling Lane that she cheated on him he kicks her out he's so mad. He goes back to living with his parents his Mom talks him into getting back with Kellie this scene is well acted by Luke Perry where he wonders why Dad wants him to be so perfect his Mom tells him how they're proud of winning awards & trophies but they get tarnished & it's all in the past she tells him to own up to the things that matter most. Lane fails twice at riding Red Rock & the 2nd time he injures his neck & nearly breaks it. He ends up fining Kellie & tells her everything & they get back together & I buy it cause I care about these characters I like the story this romance isn't force fed as I said & I just don't buy it in my head I buy it in my heart. 3rd time when he rides Red Rock he hangs on & becomes the 1st Bull Rider to defeat Red Rock. Lane goes on to Cheyenne Wyoming but before that he takes Kellie to this field to show her where their new home is going to be. You get to The Frontier Rodeo Days in Cheyenne Wyoming Lane rides a Bull called ""Takin Care Of Business"" ok & he goes the 8 seconds when Lane gets off The Bull The Bull spears him in the back with his horns the real life death I've read was slow painful torture imo & on this day it wasn't nice weather or a dusty field it was rainy & muddy which I think they should have put that in this movie the family wasn't there however in this movie the family being there gives it more of an impact. They didn't tell that Lane won this competition which adds sadness to the situation. During The Funeral Scene when The Casket in The Hearse Cynthia Geary & Carrie Snodgress sell their emotion. Bill Conti's score adds to the emotion  cause he did a lot of the music in the past for Avildsen & for Stallone for Rocky II, III & IV. There's another good scene with James Rebhorn where he's sitting in The Trophy Room & he starts reflecting & crying he remembers how he told Lane how he was proud of him  but can't remember how many times he told him he loves him. Then you get to 6 months later where Tuff convinces Kellie to come with him to The National Finals Rodeo & to accept an award in Lane's honor & he's going to ride ""Takin Care Of Business"" he also tells Kellie that Lane told him that this was going to be his year which was true. He goes on to win The World title & hangs on for 8 more seconds in Lane Frost's memory it cuts to footage of the real Lane Frost & a 1989 interview of Tuff Hederman after he won The World Championship. You also have a real good song by Billy Dean called ""Once In While"" which I wonder what ever happened to that guy & another song by Reba McEntire called ""If I Had Only Known"" which she is still around. So 8 Seconds is a really good movie the acting is not bad at all characters that I care about the love story is not forced & when somethings funny I laugh. John G Avildsen did a great job directing. I'm not a Luke Perry fan but he did a very good job. Cynthia Geary was really good. Stephen Baldwin did a good job. Red Mitchell was good. James Rebhorn & Carrie Snodgress aren't give a lot of screen time but they do a pretty good job. 8 Seconds is a very good movie if you have no clue to watch sometime you know I would say go find 8 Seconds. It holds up I wish I knew what happened to The VHS copy my family had cause I really like to watch stuff on the physical format. Anyway I have fun with these 20 years ago reviews & I haven't even gotten to March where I'll review D2 or in April which I might do something for my 20 years ago reviews. I will have a retrospective for The Crow in May. In June reviews for Speed & Renaissance Man. July I'm going to review Forest Gump maybe & for sure I will review True Lies I might do reviews for Blown Away & maybe The Client.

After I saw it, however, I wish I would have known him.  This film may come off as sort of sugary sweet to some, but adultery, drinking, fighting and cussing don't seem so sugary to me.  Mr. Frost had faults.  He was human.  But he prevailed where others have failed.  That is what make him a hero and Luke Perry's portrayal of Mr. Frost exemplifies that.This movie suffers from a few inaccuracies, but those inaccuracies help move this film along at a pace that non-rodeo people can enjoy.  The acting is fine, and that's really Luke Perry on some of those bulls.  You've got to give the guy a nod for that.The soundtrack is also very influential on the look and feel of this movie.  &quot;Once In Awhile&quot; by Billy Dean is the pinnacle performance in this movie, and if you're eyes don't well up when you hear it, you've got no heart inside.This is a decent family movie, although some younger kids probably shouldn't be exposed to some of the language and the adultery.

385504,A2KBEW2GOSLS3X,6303697224,Larry C,"[3, 3]","You don't want to miss this underrated, wonderfully acted, brilliantly directed, action packed movie called 8 Seconds. The fact that it's about rodeo bull riding only serves to ""harness"" the real reason the movie grabs you. It's the love story.....that's what gets you.....the love story! Yes the action shots are amazing, even if you never saw a rodeo or thought it was stupid or boring. Luke Perry is outstanding in the title role as the tough as nails (albeit diminutive) bronco busting cowboy Lane Frost. Despite his skinny lanky stature he makes an impressive showing in the title role. Matching him almost line for line is Steven Baldwin (the nice Baldwin) turning in a great job as Lane's wisecracking buddy. Also giving a great performance is Cynthia Geary.....just great as Lane's wife. Every live, every look, every moment she's on camera is so convincing I swear she must have married Luke Perry after the movie. She didn't? Well you could have fooled me! But the really out of this world credit goes to the director John Avildsen who just runs away with this one. Maybe his best work ever!

385507,APOUYO1BEPK22,6303697224,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[0, 0]","I never saw this in the theaters and never really thought I would watch it on DVD since the two main stars are Luke Perry and Stephen Baldwin. But a few years ago I was fiending for some country type movies and decided to give this one a chance. When the movie was over and the credits were rolling I was pretty much in shock of how good the movie was... especially since it was a true story.Luke Perry plays Lane Frost in this true tale of a champion. Lane begins riding bulls at a young age (actually sheep at that young of an age) and as he gets older, just continues what he loves to do and makes it his profession. Living the dream. That right there is just amazing to me, because there are very few out there who are doing exactly what they want to do. But not only is he living the dream, but he's really good at it. Also he has 2 really good friends who travel with him and also compete with him. One of the friends, Tuff, is played by Stephen Baldwin. Baldwin isn't too bad in this role, but I still think they could've picked a bum off the road and he would've been better. And then Lane, during one of the meets, comes across his future wife Kellie, played by the ever so boring Cynthia Geary.8 Seconds has some great moments in it and some really funny moments also. I cracked up when Lane brings a really bad trailer home for Kellie... as an actual house for her. She's thinking it's a joke, and he really thought she'd be ok with it. Well... maybe it's funny to me since I know people like that back in Georgia... lol. There are also some really slow parts to and it's mainly cause of some of the acting. Sometimes you'd think you should be watching a romantic part or a good story telling part, and Cynthia or Stephen would just ruin it cause there acting is crap.When the credits were running, I sat there and thought to myself, ""Man this guy had a crazy good life even if it was ended to soon.""Sure he wasn't perfect. He had major daddy issues, he cheated some, and he was barely home (cause he was out making the money). That doesn't hurt the fact though that he tried really hard to make everyone happy. Maybe to hard for his dad. But he was always there for his fans and a really good role model for the kids. And he tried very hard to give everything he could to Kellie (even though he wasn't always faithful). And you really can't help but smile at the end while they show real pictures and clips of Lane. He was always smiling and you could see how much fun he was always having.Man this movie really made me miss home. I gotta find me a rodeo to go to sometime here in Vegas.In the end I would say this movie might feel like a Hallmark movie, but it was a lot of fun at some points. Definitely give it a try.P.S. - I met Stephen Baldwin once back in 1999. I went to a Wal-Mart back in Tucson one night for some super glue and was walking to the check out counters when I saw a guy dressed in all black and wearing a black Kangol hat. I looked at him and thought to myself, I know this dude... but... from... where...? And then I thought, ""HIGHSCHOOL!"" So since he was seriously just standing around and hanging out at the check out counters I went up to him and said, ""Dude did you go to Northside High School back in Georgia?"" He said, ""Nope."" So I walked away totally confused of how I knew this guy. Then I asked someone in the check out aisle who he was and she said, ""I can't remember his name but that's the Bio Dome guy."" ""Ahhhh... now I remember."" And then I went home with my glue and a fun story.",4,Cowboy Up!,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,3530,"['never', 'saw', 'theaters', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'would', 'watch', 'DVD', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'are', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'fiending', 'country', 'type', 'movies', 'decided', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'credits', 'were', 'rolling', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'shock', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'especially', 'was', 'true', 'story.Luke', 'Perry', 'Lane', 'Frost', 'true', 'tale', 'champion', 'Lane', 'riding', 'bulls', 'young', 'age', 'actually', 'sheep', 'young', 'age', 'older', 'just', 'what', 'do', 'profession', 'Living', 'dream', 'right', 'just', 'amazing', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'living', 'dream', 'really', 'good', 'Also', '2', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'who', 'travel', 'also', 'compete', 'One', 'friends', 'Tuff', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Baldwin', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'role', 'still', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'bum', 'road', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'then', 'Lane', 'one', 'meets', 'future', 'wife', 'Kellie', 'played', 'ever', 'so', 'boring', 'Cynthia', 'Geary.8', 'Seconds', 'great', 'moments', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'also', 'cracked', 'up', 'when', 'Lane', 'really', 'bad', 'trailer', 'home', 'Kellie', 'actual', 'house', 'thinking', 'joke', 'really', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'ok', 'Well', 'funny', 'know', 'people', 'back', 'Georgia', 'lol', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'slow', 'parts', 'mainly', 'cause', 'acting', 'Sometimes', ""'d"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'romantic', 'part', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'part', 'Cynthia', 'Stephen', 'would', 'just', 'ruin', 'cause', 'acting', 'crap.When', 'credits', 'were', 'running', 'sat', 'thought', 'myself', 'Man', 'guy', 'had', 'crazy', 'good', 'life', 'even', 'was', 'ended', 'soon', 'Sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'had', 'major', 'daddy', 'issues', 'cheated', 'was', 'barely', 'home', 'cause', 'was', 'out', 'making', 'money', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fact', 'tried', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'everyone', 'happy', 'Maybe', 'hard', 'dad', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'fans', 'really', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'kids', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'give', 'everything', 'could', 'Kellie', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'faithful', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'end', 'show', 'real', 'pictures', 'clips', 'Lane', 'was', 'always', 'smiling', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'was', 'always', 'having.Man', 'movie', 'really', 'made', 'miss', 'home', 'got', 'ta', 'find', 'rodeo', 'go', 'sometime', 'here', 'Vegas.In', 'end', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'might', 'feel', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'points', 'Definitely', 'give', 'try.P.S', 'met', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'once', 'back', '1999', 'went', 'Wal-Mart', 'back', 'Tucson', 'one', 'night', 'super', 'glue', 'was', 'walking', 'check', 'out', 'counters', 'when', 'saw', 'guy', 'dressed', 'black', 'wearing', 'black', 'Kangol', 'hat', 'looked', 'thought', 'myself', 'know', 'dude', 'where', 'then', 'thought', 'HIGHSCHOOL', 'So', 'was', 'seriously', 'just', 'standing', 'around', 'hanging', 'out', 'check', 'counters', 'went', 'up', 'said', 'Dude', 'did', 'go', 'Northside', 'High', 'School', 'back', 'Georgia', 'said', 'Nope', 'walked', 'away', 'totally', 'confused', 'how', 'knew', 'guy', 'Then', 'asked', 'someone', 'check', 'aisle', 'who', 'was', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'Bio', 'Dome', 'guy', 'Ahhhh', 'now', 'remember', 'then', 'went', 'home', 'glue', 'fun', 'story']",8 Seconds VHS

But so what. One thing this film does do is to  reveal a North American Western culture tenaciously clinging to life in a  world that constantly mocks and denigrates it. Lane Frost was, (and still  is), one of the best representatives of this culture. This was the world I  grew up in here in South Texas, where honesty and a person's word meant  something; where ideas of family and faith were REAL and not just political  agendas for republicans and fundamentalist fanatics. Yes, there is a dark  side to this culture, (I also grew  up surrounded by racism and bigotry and  religious nonsense), but ALL human societies have their positives and  negatives. I for one have grown tired of seeing Texans and other people of  the West constantly depicted in film and literature as know-nothing yokels.  8 SECONDS is a welcome reprieve from the usual way westerners are treated,  along with TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL and TENDER MERCIES. And Lane Frost certainly  deserves the tribute this movie gives him.

(I know that fans and basically anyone ever involved with the rodeo circuit know exactly who he is ). But you don't have to be a Bull rider or fan to enjoy this film . In my opinion-this film only lacks one thing - needed to delve a little deeper in his ability . (More than likely)-the film makers wanted to make this more of a love story (to appeal to a bigger audience) . Just seems that way ,because ,there was a lot more to Lane . -- So you pretty much don't have to know anything about the rodeo or bull riding . Just turn the lights down and snug up on the couch with your loved one (ones)-- and watch this film . It is very touching .
