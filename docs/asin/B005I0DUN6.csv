However, my chilren are boys and very visual and they needed some extra help with reading skills. I feel really good about them watching this and they have learned so much from it.My disc did arrive with a defect, but I sent it back and had my new copy the next day.

Before, he really enjoyed things on TV, but now he prefers to watch these DVD's over and over!  He's had them for around three weeks and already knows the songs (he hums them) and is starting to say his letters and sounds!  Using the Numbers Ahoy video, he has already learned to count to 10 and does constantly!  He's counting everything!  I have to admit I really enjoy watching them with him!  Cute graphics, great lessons and catchy tunes!  I HIGHLY recommend this product!",5,Amazing Videos!,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,551,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'set', '2', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'absolutely', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'things', 'TV', 'now', 'watch', 'DVD', 'over', 'over', 'had', 'three', 'weeks', 'already', 'songs', 'starting', 'say', 'letters', 'Using', 'Numbers', 'Ahoy', 'video', 'already', 'learned', 'count', '10', 'constantly', 'counting', 'everything', 'have', 'admit', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Cute', 'graphics', 'great', 'lessons', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'product']",LeapFrog Learning Collection

These are worth purchasing, since our 4-year old watches them over and over again.  Some movies the kids only want to watch once (which are better for rentals).  These Leap Frog videos get multiple viewings, and since they help learn alphabet, spelling, numbers, etc., they are good additions to our DVD shelf.",5,Our kids love these videos,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,379,"['kids', 'videos', 'are', 'educational', 'entertaining', 'are', 'worth', 'purchasing', '4-year', 'old', 'watches', 'over', 'again', 'movies', 'kids', 'only', 'want', 'watch', 'once', 'are', 'better', 'rentals', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'videos', 'get', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'help', 'learn', 'alphabet', 'spelling', 'numbers', 'etc.', 'are', 'good', 'additions', 'DVD', 'shelf']",LeapFrog Learning Collection

This are also very, very good.I truly feel like the creative minds at Leap Frog sit around and think &#34;How can we really teach something in a way that kids will really catch on to and really enjoy as well?&#34; Little things like animating the characters lips and tongue properly as they pronounce letters and words really impressed me as well as far as little details.My son is about 2 1/2 now and he loves these.
