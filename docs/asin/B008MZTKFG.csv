1570716,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008MZTKFG,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 7]","Maybe `Elena' was just poorly marketed.  I wouldn't know because I didn't personally see any advertisements and just happened to stumble onto this when I saw it on Netflix.  Apparently some feel this was supposed to be some sort of a noir or a thriller.  It's not.  `Elena' is more than that.  `Elena' is a deeply moving and complex character study that unravels around the relationship between a woman, her husband, his daughter and her son.  With long brushstrokes for takes, director Andrey Zvyagintsev delivers what I imagine a Hitchcock film would look like under the direction of Michael Haneke.  It is severe, but in a very subtle and observant way, allowing us to get inside Elena's head without feeling beaten over the head by her conundrum of sorts, and the finale is beautifully enriched by an almost stale aftertaste, as if the underscore the decisions of the film's centerpiece.  With a brilliant score (truly haunting) and a brilliant leading lady (what Nadezhda Markina does here is remarkable), `Elena' delivers to us a rather remarkable look at the lengths one will go to in order to enrich the lives of those they love, regardless of the cost.",5,A bitter pill to swallow...,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1161,"['Maybe', 'Elena', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'marketed', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'personally', 'see', 'advertisements', 'just', 'happened', 'stumble', 'when', 'saw', 'Netflix', 'Apparently', 'feel', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'noir', 'thriller', 'not', 'Elena', 'more', 'Elena', 'deeply', 'moving', 'complex', 'character', 'study', 'relationship', 'woman', 'husband', 'daughter', 'son', 'long', 'brushstrokes', 'director', 'Andrey', 'Zvyagintsev', 'what', 'imagine', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'would', 'look', 'direction', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'severe', 'very', 'subtle', 'observant', 'way', 'allowing', 'get', 'Elena', 'head', 'feeling', 'beaten', 'head', 'conundrum', 'sorts', 'finale', 'beautifully', 'enriched', 'almost', 'stale', 'aftertaste', 'underscore', 'decisions', 'film', 'centerpiece', 'brilliant', 'score', 'truly', 'haunting', 'brilliant', 'leading', 'lady', 'what', 'Nadezhda', 'Markina', 'here', 'remarkable', 'Elena', 'delivers', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'look', 'lengths', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'enrich', 'lives', 'love', 'regardless', 'cost']",N/A

The suspense in this film is built on what is not said rather than dialogues and it is filled with slow-paced scenes that depict an atmosphere of bleakness.Elena and her husband, Vladimir, are from two different social classes. Vladimir has money and what seems an uncaring daughter. Elena was a nurse when she met Vladimir at a hospital, and even after the marriage she continues to be behave like a nurse although with benefits. Elena has a useless son and wants Vladimir to help him. Of course, Vladimir refuses because he knows Elena's son is used to having his mom fixe his life and this is when Elena proves that her daughter in law is right to distrust her.In general, the atmosphere and the uncertainy of the movie is very good. However, my reason for not giving it more than three stars is that it all happened too easily or quickly? Elena takes a decision and with no problem whatsoever carries it out without any sort of obstacle. The unexpected ending saves the movie, but I think the director wasted a great opportunity to create more tension or conflict during the second half of the movie by making things happen easily and abruptly.",3,Elena,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1316,"['Russian', 'film', 'similar', 'other', 'Eastern', 'European', 'Scandinavian', 'movies', 'have', 'recently', 'watched', '34', 'My', 'Joy', '34', '34', 'Aurora', '34', '34', 'Delta', '34', 'suspense', 'film', 'built', 'what', 'not', 'said', 'rather', 'dialogues', 'filled', 'slow-paced', 'scenes', 'depict', 'atmosphere', 'bleakness.Elena', 'husband', 'Vladimir', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'social', 'classes', 'Vladimir', 'money', 'what', 'uncaring', 'daughter', 'Elena', 'was', 'nurse', 'when', 'met', 'Vladimir', 'hospital', 'even', 'marriage', 'be', 'behave', 'nurse', 'benefits', 'Elena', 'useless', 'son', 'Vladimir', 'help', 'course', 'Vladimir', 'Elena', 'son', 'used', 'having', 'mom', 'fixe', 'life', 'when', 'Elena', 'daughter', 'law', 'right', 'distrust', 'her.In', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'uncertainy', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'reason', 'not', 'giving', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'happened', 'too', 'easily', 'quickly', 'Elena', 'decision', 'problem', 'whatsoever', 'out', 'sort', 'obstacle', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'movie', 'think', 'director', 'wasted', 'great', 'opportunity', 'create', 'more', 'tension', 'conflict', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'making', 'things', 'happen', 'easily', 'abruptly']",N/A

Eiserloh ""emeiserloh""","[1, 2]","Elena, besides being a low-burn thriller, is an indictment of contemporary Russia where money is the only thing one can count on, and which corrupts/effects the value system completely, unless one is lucky enough and content to eke out a meager existence in servitude.Elena starts out as fairly content, having accepted her lot in life and has been practical/lucky enough to become the nurse/wife/housemaid to a man of property and enough wealth, who treats her politely and well enough as long as his needs are met. His daughter, meanwhile has become a hedonistic cynic (and there are intimations that her mother was similar), which is more evidence that they belong to a corrupt nouveau riche, post communist, post czarist Russia emulating itself all over again, where money has replaced party members, and class system by family name, where the right to ownership has been redistributed, but continues the same class system under a different guise.Elena's husband is not a bad guy, and it doesn't appear that he came by his wealth in grave criminal or corrupt ways, but he is highly protective of the one thing that in his mind perhaps keeps him from being in the same situation as 90 % of the population, and is willing only to indulge the flesh of his loins, and to some extent his wife, and perhaps those who support him in his position like doctors and lawyers, or people he does business with etc.Elena is essentially a good person, who wants to be a good wife, and good Christian, but she also can't help indulging the fruit of her loins, or looking out for his interests and wellbeing (blood is thicker than matrimony, I guess), even though her son is just as hedonistic and self-centered in his own ignorant paltry way as her husbands daughter, and just as spoiled (I mean this in several senses).The context is contemporary Russia, but first world economies are not as far away from a breakdown of ""civilized"" values as we would like to believe. Stretch the middle class just a little more, endure a few more terrorist attacks and we are right there.It's a dog eat dog world, and the tenement youth gang attack on a couple of homeless living in a clearing between their high-rise project and the factory smoke stacks is not a random act of violence, but evidence of the power/anger that can be expressed by those living on the lowest rung of society against people who have no rung at all.",4,"Harsh realities make a mockery of idealized ""goodness.""",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,2401,"['Elena', 'being', 'low-burn', 'thriller', 'indictment', 'contemporary', 'Russia', 'where', 'money', 'only', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'count', 'value', 'system', 'completely', 'one', 'lucky', 'enough', 'content', 'eke', 'out', 'meager', 'existence', 'servitude.Elena', 'out', 'fairly', 'content', 'having', 'accepted', 'lot', 'life', 'been', 'practical/lucky', 'enough', 'become', 'nurse/wife/housemaid', 'man', 'property', 'enough', 'wealth', 'who', 'politely', 'well', 'enough', 'as', 'long', 'needs', 'are', 'met', 'daughter', 'meanwhile', 'become', 'hedonistic', 'cynic', 'are', 'intimations', 'mother', 'was', 'similar', 'more', 'evidence', 'belong', 'corrupt', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'post', 'communist', 'post', 'czarist', 'Russia', 'emulating', 'over', 'again', 'where', 'money', 'replaced', 'party', 'members', 'class', 'system', 'family', 'name', 'where', 'right', 'ownership', 'been', 'redistributed', 'same', 'class', 'system', 'different', 'guise.Elena', 'husband', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'appear', 'came', 'wealth', 'grave', 'criminal', 'corrupt', 'ways', 'highly', 'protective', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'perhaps', 'being', 'same', 'situation', '90', '%', 'population', 'willing', 'only', 'indulge', 'flesh', 'loins', 'extent', 'wife', 'perhaps', 'who', 'support', 'position', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'people', 'business', 'etc.Elena', 'essentially', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'be', 'good', 'wife', 'good', 'Christian', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'indulging', 'fruit', 'loins', 'looking', 'out', 'interests', 'wellbeing', 'blood', 'thicker', 'matrimony', 'guess', 'even', 'son', 'just', 'hedonistic', 'self-centered', 'own', 'ignorant', 'paltry', 'way', 'husbands', 'daughter', 'just', 'spoiled', 'mean', 'several', 'senses', '.The', 'context', 'contemporary', 'Russia', 'first', 'world', 'economies', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'breakdown', 'civilized', 'values', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'Stretch', 'middle', 'class', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'endure', 'few', 'more', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'are', 'right', 'there.It', 'dog', 'eat', 'dog', 'world', 'tenement', 'youth', 'gang', 'attack', 'couple', 'homeless', 'living', 'clearing', 'high-rise', 'project', 'factory', 'smoke', 'stacks', 'not', 'random', 'act', 'violence', 'evidence', 'power/anger', 'can', 'be', 'expressed', 'living', 'lowest', 'rung', 'society', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'rung']",N/A

Finally abit of action talking with her husband over breakfast. Then a shot of her back walking down the street got stuck in time .Basically when there is no dialogue the filming gets sticky. Or it contains filler such as her husband driving his car to the gym for nearly a minute of so what.This is good film; it's not flakey and the music is a puller. It is an interesting film when people converse and you could never accuse the characters of being two-dimensional.

1570723,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B008MZTKFG,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""Elena"" is a spare, meditative drama by Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev that won some awards on the international festival circuit. Elena (Nadezhda Markina) is a housewife of modest origins, married to wealthy Vladimir (Andrey Smirnov). They met when Elena worked as a nurse in a hospital where Vladimir was recuperating. Now they live in a lovely, spacious Moscow apartment, which Elena keeps just as her husband likes. They get along and show genuine affection for each other but sometimes clash when the discussion turns to their grown children. Elena's son Sergey (Alexey Rozin) is chronically unemployed and always asking for money. Vladimir's daughter Katya (Elena Lyadova) is estranged from her father and takes a nihilistic view of life. Things might change when Vladimir has a heart attack and decides to write a will.I have a weakness for films that tell their stories cinematically, with spare dialogue, but I wondered if this might be an exercise in self-indulgence when I saw that the first shot, of trees in front of Vladimir's apartment, lasts a minute and 20 seconds. This is followed by successive shots of the apartment's interior. Dialogue does not commence for 8 minutes. But I came to welcome these silent contemplations of the environment. There are a lot of long shots of people doing nothing. Vladimir in his car. Elena fixing her hair. The photography is beautiful. The silence is, I believe, intended as realism. The director admits that the screenplay is barely long enough for a film half this length. But ""Elena"" tells its story by observing routines. We see Elena's daily routine. We are lulled into it. Then we see a break in the routine. The routine told a story; the break will tell another.Vladimir is a self-made man, now apparently retired. Elena has worked hard all her life and married into comfort in middle age. Sergey is a layabout who expects his mother to wheedle money out of Vladimir for him. Vladimir is reluctant to throw money that way and discourages Elena from indulging her son, but Vladimir tends to indulge his own daughter Katya. Some critics have interpreted ""Elena"" as a social critique of contemporary Russian society, but it is difficult to imagine what it is criticizing, as Zvyagintsev refrains from moralizing about any of the characters. ""Elena"" has also erroneously been referred to as ""film noir"". It does not take place within a chaotic noir universe, and it does not come to any conclusion. The story could have been ""noir"" if the director had taken a different approach. As it is, ""Elena"" is very Russian, ironic, and open-ended.The DVD (Zeitgeist 2012): Bonus features include a lengthy ""Director Interview"" (32 min) in which Andrey Zvyagintsev discusses developing the screenplay, why he included the church scene, why he extended the film beyond its original ending, the silence in the film, the first shot and subsequent long, silent shots. ""Making the Poster Screenprint"" (2 1/2 min) has no dialogue but shows the movie's poster being made at Kangaroo Press. It was designed by Sam's Myth. There is also a US theatrical trailer.

1570724,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B008MZTKFG,Paul Allaer,"[4, 5]","""Elena"" (2011 release from Russia; 109 min.) brings the story of Elena (played by Nadezhda Markina) and Vladimir, both in their sixties it appears. Married life is not quite what it seems, as Elenea appears to be equally the care-taker, maid, and do-it-all for Vladimir. Only later in the film do we learn that they met some 10 years ago when Vladimir was in the hospital and Elena was his nurse. They eventually married, and it brought economic stability for Elena as Vladimir is well off finacially. We also get to know Elena's son, Sergei, and his family, including his 17 yr old son Sasha, a do-no-good slacker of the first degree who desparately wants to go to university so as to avoid having to serve in the army but can't afford it. Sergei is not much better, essentially being supported by Elena. Last major character in the movie is Vladimir's daughter Katerina, the supposedly ""wild and crazy"" one (but is she really?), who rarely sees her old man anymore.Even though the movie starts off very gently (the opening 5 min. or so, all we see is Elena awakening, making coffe and breakfast, and getting ready for the day), it doesn't take long for the tension to start building in the movie. It shouldn't come as a surprise that it's all about the benjamins, of course. Vladimir has lots of it; Sergei and his family not so much and getting more desperate by the day. I won't say more about the plot, you'll just have to see how it all plays out for yourself, but suffice it to say that you are in for quite a few surprises in the last half hour.The movie plays out at glacial speed, and I mean that as a compliment. The character study of Elena is done beautifully, you can see Elena's despair and conflcit (between her husband and her son) in her face. Nadezhda Markina in the title role won several acting awards last year in Europe for this performance, and rightfully so. I have no idea why this movie just now, 18 months after its premiere at the 2011 Cannes festival, found its way to the theatre here in Cincinnati, but better late than never, I suppose.
