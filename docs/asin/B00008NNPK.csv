This documentary is about Jamaica, the Caribbean island that Americans usually have a stereotypical idea about being just a beautiful tourist island for vacations. However after watching this movie you become more aware about the negative effects of globalization on Jamaica. This documentary was very engaging and interesting, because there was a variety of topics and interviews with many important people such as the former president of Jamaica. The different interviews are from many perspectives, from farmers and laymen to an authority figure in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). From this documentary, you learn how Jamaica has been trapped into a cycle of debt and hardship because of the loans with high interest rates that the World Bank and IMF have provided them. You learn about the insidious trade policies that cause a surplus of imports from overseas to destroy Jamaica's native farmer's chances of succeeding. You learn about how this former British colony is invaded by McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, and big corporations looking for cheap labor that exploits poor Jamaicans. The narration is excellent, the background music features great reggae music, and the cinematography was skillfully employed.I definitely would suggest watching this documentary to learn more about how America and the IMF's policy's towards Jamaica and other ""developing countries"" have caused them to become mired into economic and social problems. This was an excellent and beautiful movie that taught me more about the situation in Jamaica and how it arose.",5,An eye-opening documentary about Jamaica's plight,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,1656,"['Life', 'Debt', 'amazing', 'documentary', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'publicity', 'did', 'documentary', 'Jamaica', 'Caribbean', 'island', 'Americans', 'usually', 'have', 'stereotypical', 'idea', 'being', 'just', 'beautiful', 'tourist', 'island', 'vacations', 'However', 'watching', 'movie', 'become', 'more', 'aware', 'negative', 'effects', 'globalization', 'Jamaica', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'was', 'variety', 'topics', 'interviews', 'many', 'important', 'people', 'such', 'former', 'president', 'Jamaica', 'different', 'interviews', 'are', 'many', 'perspectives', 'farmers', 'laymen', 'authority', 'figure', 'International', 'Monetary', 'Fund', 'IMF', 'documentary', 'learn', 'how', 'Jamaica', 'been', 'trapped', 'cycle', 'debt', 'hardship', 'loans', 'high', 'interest', 'rates', 'World', 'Bank', 'IMF', 'have', 'provided', 'learn', 'insidious', 'trade', 'policies', 'cause', 'surplus', 'imports', 'overseas', 'destroy', 'Jamaica', 'native', 'farmer', 'chances', 'succeeding', 'learn', 'how', 'former', 'British', 'colony', 'invaded', 'McDonald', 'Burger', 'King', 'Taco', 'Bell', 'big', 'corporations', 'looking', 'cheap', 'labor', 'poor', 'Jamaicans', 'narration', 'excellent', 'background', 'music', 'great', 'reggae', 'music', 'cinematography', 'was', 'skillfully', 'employed.I', 'definitely', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'documentary', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'America', 'IMF', 'policy', 'towards', 'Jamaica', 'other', 'developing', 'countries', 'have', 'caused', 'become', 'mired', 'economic', 'social', 'problems', 'was', 'excellent', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'taught', 'more', 'situation', 'Jamaica', 'how', 'arose']",Life and Debt

The narrator speaks to the audience as if they are American tourists, for whom she clearly has no love, and to whom she ascribes wealth, obliviousness, ignorance, egoism and callousness.  It would be difficult to glean from this film that Jamaica gains anything from its tourist industry; or that Jamaica works actively to entice tourists to visit in order to get their dollars.  Instead, one is left with the impression that tourist presence is an unwelcome invasion of ignorant exploiters.The same unevenness is presented when speaking of Jamaican debt.  It would be hard to walk away from this film knowing that 1) Jamaica chose to join the World Bank in order to borrow from it; 2) that Jamaica chose to borrow from the Bank and that the terms of the loans are no surprise; or 3) that financial mismanagement by local governments play an important role in overindebtedness.

Barten,"[5, 7]","One of the bonus tracks on the DVD is a music video, ""Mr. Heartless"" by Anthony B. with kids, garbage trucks, cows roaming near a dump, the singer, and the kids playing violin look very young for that part.  They sound great though, and the movie is basically educational in a manner that fits with a song that ends with the exhortation:  Rastafari.  Listening to the commentary by the directer, she seemed to be a little shy about things that she could not come right out and say in the film.  She set up a camera by three men with a Bible sitting in front of a fire and cuts their comments into the film almost as much as the tourists, but in the end she admits that tourism is the number one industry in the global economy.The really dirty secret that she spills the beans on, that none of the farmers actually say in the film, is that whenever a farmer tries to send something into the United States, it is held in Customs until it utterly perishes.  I have been reading about a few trade imbalances, and I'm inclined to believe that powdered milk which appears in this film is subsidized at 137 percent of its price, as is stated in the film in the regular soundtrack.I really wish that the fresh milk shown in this film could have been sold to Asian workers in the Kingston free zone, but they would not receive any money until they returned to their homes in Asia.  Whoever has really big bucks is going to extreme lengths to keep real money from reaching regular people, and I no longer think that Americans are heading into the future with any wind at their backs.  Debt is the biggest problem Jamaica faces as a deteriorating society, growing astronomically with each new year, but American policies of budget deficits, trade imbalances, and gross family financial incompetence throughout the middle class could make the negative net worth of the United States surpass anything the world has ever seen, particularly when the newspapers aren't reporting what Harvey Pitt has been doing since he was chairman of the S.E.C.  Do yourself a favor and watch the video a few times, but be sure to see the movie, interview, and commentary, too.

Pawl ""Dani""","[6, 6]","LIFE & DEBT, a brilliant documentary by Stephanie Black, takes a cautionary look at the bleak state of the small island nation of Jamaica.  Based on a piece written by Antigua-bred writer, Jamaica Kincaid, this film is beautifully narrated by Belinda Becker.  What's more, it is greatly benefited by an evocative musical score that includes such musicians as Ziggy Marley, along with an original score by Mutabaruka.  The story juxtaposes news reels, candid interview with farmers, former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, Deputy Director of the IMF Stanley Fisher, and President of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide (among others), as well as very graphic and honest footage of Jamaican slum life.  You can almost smell the rot coming from the garbage dumps children and families must live close to, on a daily basis, because they simply have no other choice.LIFE & DEBT takes a very sobering look at the effect of twenty-five years of assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), what resulted from this relationship (including the increasing weakening of Jamaican currency, in favor of the American dollar and an increasing struggle for local farmers, as more and more imported produce found its way onto the shelves and into the bellies of Jamaicans and tourists to Jamaica).  Throughout the story, we hear ""If you come to Jamaica as a tourist, this is what you will see...""  LIFE & DEBT makes an especially strong appeal to anyone who arrives in the island nation, and the way in which people tend to appropriate the beauty of a culture (beaches, corn-rowed hairstyles and local food), while turning a blind eye to the stark reality of those who must survive from day to day.  The narrator paints the picture of a ""typical"" tourist.  This person is a wealthy American who has the means to come and go from Jamaica, sees the rolling beaches, delicious local cuisine and warm weather.  They also see the Jamaican natives, and imagine their life to be quite laid back and worry free.  However, the reality is quite the opposite, since most of the poor subsist on less than the equivalent of one American dollar (once numerous taxes take a considerable bite out of their paycheck).This film is beautiful, on so many levels.  Stephanie Black made a bold and beautiful choice in the direction she took with her cinematography.  The combination of beautiful and colorful footage of sunsets, and gorgeous flora and fauna, along with black and white montages (to depict the colonialized ""past"" in contrast with present day Jamaica) was really powerful.  What's more, this is the first time I have seen someone respectfully acknowledging the great detrimental effect the WTO (World Trade Organization) and IMF (International Monetary Fund) has had on smaller, greatly disadvantaged nations that have been wrongfully exploited.  I commend Stephanie Black for having the guts to bring LIFE & DEBT to the screen.

I thought the discussion of the not-so-wonderful results of Jamaica's breaking its colonial ties to Britain was fascinating and relevant to the situation in other countries considering the same step. I felt the film was completely off base in discussing the source of most of Jamaica's problems. In reality, Jamaica's biggest problem is that it is vastly overpopulated. Supporting even Jamaica's present population sustainably is just not possible, and the population is still growing. The natural resources of the island are being destroyed for nothing. The population problem was not even mentioned in the film. The film is correct in pointing out that cheap imported goods, such as U.S.-produced food, are hurting the local economy of Jamaica. The reason for this is not, as the filmmakers seem to think, that the U.S. is a nasty country. Rather, the U.S. has chosen the ridiculous course of subsidizing its own destructive agricultural practices at taxpayer expense. Both globalization and the vast productivity of U.S. mechanized farms are essentially fantasies created by cheap oil. Neither has a long-term future. Jamaica would do better to recognize that and work for more realistic oil prices and reduced agricultural subsidies in the U.S., which would benefit both countries. Unfortunately judging by the film, Jamaica is chasing its own fantasy of an ever-rising GDP through expanded tourism. The day will eventually come when Jamaica will have to cope on its own.

The IMF gives them a loan to keep things running, but with terms which include opening the country to free trade. Not able to compete with the prices of subsidised crops and milk from North America, local farming operations collapse. Government officials are lured into establishing ""tax free zones"" in their ports believing they will create local jobs, only to find that companies like Hanes import workers from China and keep them behind a fence where their wages are not spent in the local economy. Their products are created from cotton made in China, by workers from China, all free from tax.I loved this documentary, but I did read the critical review from ""Island Boy"" seriously (next page). Island Boy writes from Jamaica noting that this documentary leaves out historical information like Manley's policy of 90 percent tax drove which drove the educated middle class and businesses away. His review is something to take note of before watching this film.What you'll learn from Life and Debt is that we often think we are helping a situation by supporting aid when reality we are only being persuaded to subvert justice. It seems that behind many plans which the government presents as good-hearted is a cleverly disguised plan to benefit the rich. You might take the message of this movie and ask yourself how else you are subverting yourself. Does open-space movement preserve the environment or keep local developers rich by making land artifically scarce? Feminism kept wages lower for US employers in the 1970's when inflation was raging and did little to improve the working life of women and children.
