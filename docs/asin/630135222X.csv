Very jumbled and mostly ad libbed, after seeing this movie I'd definitely believe they were either drunk, high, or both for most of the production. I never quite understood why Corey Feldman did that fake froggy voice thing (recent interviews show he definitely doesn't talk like that) but he does it throughout this entire movie. The whole plot seems just incredibly disjointed, so after about halfway through this mess I had to turn it off. A lot of people love this movie dearly, but I'd have to say a lot of the love comes from the nostalgia of the era, which I am shy of by about a decade (born in the late 80s).

However, it is a breeze to watch because of Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, their third film starring together behind License to Drive and The Lost Boys. In a way, the movie feels like a homage paid to Michael Jackson, and that's all there is to it. For some reason, the years of 1987 to 1989 become a theme of people swapping: Vice Versa, Big, Like Father Like Son, 18 Again!, and Dream a Little Dream. So, think about it: Jason Robards' character gets placed into Corey's body yet it is Corey acting like Corey. Big fail.

250317,ABRFGWSJQXLWQ,630135222X,"Butters ""Stupid Flanders, you're a genius!""","[6, 11]","The best thing I can say about this movie is it gives Corey schadenfreude enthusiasts (me) a whole lot to play with. It is literally the most incoherent and incomprehensible movie that has ever been concocted. It is worth something by being that and it shouldn't be just dismissed. Amongst all the body swap movies that were made and all the bad 80's teen movies (I'm looking at you Can't Buy Me Love) this is the only one that made me want to find a car battery or a small child and chuck it through the screen.Where to start, well let's start with the beginning. The two Corey's in a clearly unscripted scene, ""riff"" off of one another, not to unlike their A&E; opus. Things about love and wackin it. It goes on while credits interrupt. And it keeps going on, a meandering conversation by two guys clearly strung out on something and pretending to be high school students. THEN the credits really begin. This is an excellent precursor to what you will see in the coming two hours (which is when I think the opening credits actually end). Another scene has a rock ballad going while Feldman in one room and the delectable Ms. Salenger (where art thou?) in her own respective room, thinking about the other. And thinking, and thinking (I think). We get to hear pretty much the whole song by the time all this thinking sends them into slumberland where things make even less sense, but at least Jason Robards is there.Let's talk about Robards here. There in my opinion, have been few if any better character actors than Robards. Only Hackman and Duvall can top him, I think. And what's more, is Feldman kind of looks and sounds a little bit like him naturally. And yet, there has never been a less convincing performance, not just in the body swap genre, but like ever. And I've seen a few Christian movies. And Transformers 2! But there's more, oh yes, there's more.Despite the six or seven names above the title, some iconic, some named Corey, the second half of the movie really has nothing to do with ANY of them or the body swapping. It becomes a dull of wits (you read that right) between the two school physcos. And a monologue delivered by Feldman that reminded me of Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men - If he played it in his current condition. There's even a dance scene that showcases Feldman's MJ like moves. Again, if they were done in his current condition.And then mercifully it ends. And by ends, I mean it runs out of money. There is no explaination for what just happened. Ever. Actually I can't tell if money was the case. That would be my semi first guess, and they then stretched the scenes of ""dialogue"" and of course the ""thinking"". Or, and this could actually be even more plausible, they never knew in the first place. And judging by each individual scene, that makes even more sense. There are more akward moments here than on The Office.I wish I could stop there. But alas, I have not yet reached the music. If you saw the title and thought, ""Hey, I love that song!"" You should buy this movie. You will get an earful of it. The original version, the new version, I think even other versions as well. Maybe Weird Al jumped in there too. Then, last and always least, Micheal Damian. Yeah, what a get. You could get Jason Robards and Harry Dean Stanton in the movie (and they didn't think to swap him with Haim? I am actually grateful for this) but you couldn't get anyone better than a Soap Opera star to sing the soundtrack song? And then to inundate my young high school generation at the time with it, well, I think we know who we can point the finger at for the economic collapse now.",1,I don't understand what just happened here,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,3606,"['best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'Corey', 'schadenfreude', 'enthusiasts', 'whole', 'lot', 'play', 'literally', 'most', 'incoherent', 'incomprehensible', 'movie', 'ever', 'been', 'concocted', 'worth', 'something', 'being', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'dismissed', 'Amongst', 'body', 'swap', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'bad', '80', 'teen', 'movies', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'only', 'one', 'made', 'want', 'find', 'car', 'battery', 'small', 'child', 'chuck', 'screen.Where', 'start', 'well', 'let', 'start', 'beginning', 'two', 'Corey', 'clearly', 'unscripted', 'scene', 'riff', 'one', 'not', 'A', 'E', 'opus', 'Things', 'love', 'wackin', 'credits', 'interrupt', 'going', 'meandering', 'conversation', 'two', 'guys', 'clearly', 'strung', 'out', 'something', 'pretending', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'THEN', 'credits', 'really', 'begin', 'excellent', 'precursor', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'coming', 'two', 'hours', 'when', 'think', 'opening', 'credits', 'actually', 'end', 'scene', 'rock', 'ballad', 'going', 'Feldman', 'one', 'room', 'delectable', 'Ms.', 'Salenger', 'where', 'art', 'thou', 'own', 'respective', 'room', 'thinking', 'other', 'thinking', 'thinking', 'think', 'get', 'hear', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'song', 'time', 'thinking', 'slumberland', 'where', 'things', 'make', 'even', 'less', 'sense', 'least', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'talk', 'Robards', 'here', 'opinion', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'better', 'character', 'actors', 'Robards', 'Only', 'Hackman', 'Duvall', 'can', 'top', 'think', 'what', 'more', 'Feldman', 'kind', 'looks', 'little', 'bit', 'naturally', 'yet', 'never', 'been', 'less', 'convincing', 'performance', 'not', 'just', 'body', 'swap', 'genre', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'Christian', 'movies', '2', 'more', 'oh', 'yes', 'six', 'seven', 'names', 'title', 'iconic', 'named', 'Corey', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'ANY', 'body', 'swapping', 'dull', 'wits', 'read', 'right', 'two', 'school', 'physcos', 'monologue', 'delivered', 'Feldman', 'reminded', 'Henry', 'Fonda', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'played', 'current', 'condition', 'even', 'dance', 'scene', 'Feldman', 'MJ', 'moves', 'Again', 'were', 'done', 'current', 'condition.And', 'then', 'mercifully', 'ends', 'mean', 'money', 'explaination', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'Ever', 'Actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'money', 'was', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'semi', 'first', 'guess', 'then', 'stretched', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'course', 'thinking', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'plausible', 'never', 'knew', 'first', 'place', 'judging', 'individual', 'scene', 'even', 'more', 'sense', 'are', 'more', 'akward', 'moments', 'here', 'Office.I', 'wish', 'could', 'stop', 'there', 'alas', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'reached', 'music', 'saw', 'title', 'thought', 'Hey', 'love', 'song', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'earful', 'original', 'version', 'new', 'version', 'think', 'even', 'other', 'versions', 'well', 'Maybe', 'Weird', 'Al', 'jumped', 'too', 'Then', 'last', 'always', 'least', 'Micheal', 'Damian', 'Yeah', 'what', 'get', 'could', 'get', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'swap', 'Haim', 'am', 'actually', 'grateful', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'anyone', 'better', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'star', 'sing', 'soundtrack', 'song', 'then', 'inundate', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'generation', 'time', 'well', 'think', 'know', 'who', 'can', 'point', 'finger', 'economic', 'collapse', 'now']",N/A

This movie, however, seeing it as an adult, is just plain strange.  You have the 2 Coreys (Feldman in his full blown Michael Jackson addiction, and Haim still cute rather than bloated, mumbling and drooling all over himself) in a high school setting, the hot girl who is torn between her currant boyfriend and someone else coming in to take her attentions away, and there is some kind of supernatural twist where we float between the real world and the dream world where the lost souls are kept.  I think that aspect was what took this movie down, otherwise it would have been a good teen comedy.  It also took the wind out of the sails of the 2 Coreys, which is unfortunate for them.  Even before Haim's death of a drug overdose a few years ago, they always had that ""2 Coreys"" reputation, and they could have made a real franchise out of it if their addictions and egos and bad choices did not get in the way.

250340,A1K94LXX833JTT,630135222X,Sanpete,"[2, 6]","This isn't quite a body switching movie because the switch isn't complete, but it resembles Freaky Friday in setting up a generation gap, putting the mind of the older protagonist into the body of the younger, and letting hilarity ensue.The basic plot is more strange and complex than that, but plot isn't the strong point of this film.  Apparently there was a lot that happened during the '80s that I don't remember, probably because of repression, judging from some of the stuff in the film.  This movie is a refresher course on the fashion, attitudes, and popular music of the time, particularly for those who were in high school.  ""The two Coreys,"" whom I don't remember at all, were very popular, I've learned, and get most of the screen time.  These facts alone are enough to recommend the movie to those with a fondness for '80s adolescence.For the rest of us it's a mixed bag.  If you like teen romantic comedies, this is that, with unconventional elements to keep it from being merely typical.  The two Coreys are likable, if a little over-cute sometimes.  The humor is pitched at the same level as the fashion, and while it's sharp enough for its type, it isn't as funny to me now as it would have been when I was in high school.  The presence of some very good older actors not acting in very compelling roles doesn't change that.  The movie tries to be real (I guess) by including student drinking and smoking, and has a subplot about escalating violence that includes a gun, but it's far from gritty or realistic; it stays firmly in the realm of fantasy.  That may be good thing in a romantic comedy.  The editing stands out, especially at first: MTV-ish but clever and fresh enough not to be annoying on the whole.  The peculiar plot would hold some interest, but the way it's resolved is abrupt and weak in motivation.The film has some of the appeal of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Say Anything but doesn't rise to the same level of character and dialogue.

250341,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,630135222X,S. Morales,"[0, 4]","Dream a Little Dream is another outing of the 80's heartthrobs ""The Coreys"" in a film that is supposed to be another one of your run-of-the-mill standard ""old man and teen switch bodies"" story but instead takes it to such a horrifically convoluted path that it is almost impossible to make any sense of this film. All I say when it's done is ""um... huh???""Look, forget the fact that it stars the Coreys and is supposedly an 80's gem. Yes, it's from the 80's but FARRR from being a gem. People are basing too many of their reviews on just being a Corey's fan. I'm writing this review of the MOVIE, not on the fact that I'm swooning over the Corey's (although I am a fan of theirs, just not for this particularly bad film). This very low budget ""fantasy"" film about a teen who somehow switches bodies with an older man and must fall in love with his classmate in order to restore them both carries some potential to the likes of similar films (Like Father Like Son, or Vise Versa, also from the 80s, and MUCH better movies). The biggest issues I had with this film were its direction, pacing, complete lack of characterization and annoying, ANNOYINGLY senseless plot and even bigger plotholes.We begin our story with the Coreys. Corey Feldman (the dark haired one) is your typical Michael-Jackson-esque 80's teen with nice parents and a hokey dopey best friend played by Corey Haim. Basically, the two go to high school where Feldman is best friends with a guy named Joel. Joel has a really hot girlfriend who catches the eyes of lots of guys including the school punks/bullies who Joel gets in some tense scenes with. The film begins with an annoying approach in using little dialogue and too many musical montages. The actors hang out for a bit, say some basic lines and then we have a song play and they act out the story as we get to hear a cheesy 80's song. The process of this direction goes on too long during the beginning of the film and we begin to wonder if anything actually HAPPENS!See, the montages of songs are basically a different way to tell a story - use less dialogue, and have the actors do actions to tell the story under a song. While I appreciate the ambition of this direction choice, it simply is not a great way to tell a story if it's overdone. Here, it's way overdone. I was begging for some dialogue and actual acting chops.Well, finally, we meet up with an old man and his wife who still have a very loving relationship. The Corey's and gang always cross their yard on the way to school, which irks the old man. Anyway, their conversation about this introduces us to both of these characters. Neither act very well but whatever, we'll take it. More musical montages as we are introduced to the hot dancer girlfriend (Joel's girlfriend), and the Corey's just hanging out.Now, this old guy is some type of Yoga ""energy mediation"" type who attempts one night to get his wife in on the act. At the same time Joel and his girlfriend get in a small argument, the girlfriend leaves on her bike and Corey Feldman is running home. In a very cheesy scene the girlfriends cuts through on her bike through a backyard as Corey runs through it. They crash and are both suddenly knocked out cold. Yes, it's a far-fetched scene as just bumping into someone on a bike would in no way put anyone out cold. He ""switches places"" with the old man because there was some kind of magical force (that is neither shown nor implied) that goes on when the man is doing yoga with his wife. With the old man doing yoga and the crash scene between Feldman and the girlfriend it somehow switches them both (although, as i'll discuss in a bit, that's where the convolution starts, as we no longer know what happened to the old man and are NEVER told or implied that a body switch goes on, we find out much later, which is ridiculous). So Feldman wakes up and he all of a sudden has amnesia. It's a very cheesy and horribly acted scene, and Feldman goes on to do a TERRIBLE acting job of someone who is walking around high school with amnesia.Now, Feldman begins acting all conservative and stuck up, like an old man. Perhaps it's just his amnesia. But later on we find out that he actually is the OLD MAN who has been taken into Feldmans body. Um... ok, I say. Whatever. This could have been told earlier but instead we had to sit through more annoying horrific acting by Feldman, as he seriously does a really bad job of portraying an old man in a teenager's body. More musical montages of junk ensue and his best friend Corey Haim. By the way, Haim is completely useless in this movie, and was obviously brought in just so they can call it a ""Corey's"" movie. He seriously does NOTHING throughout the entire overly long near 2 hour film as the best friend. He just walks around smoking and making his typical dumb faces. But more on that later.So then we see a series of dream sequences that take place outside the old man's home and this is where the confusion starts. Feldman and the old man chat about some sort of situation that we as the audience are not made known to at first. It's very confusing and we feel as if we're missing something. But what is LATER explained is that the old man also has the teen inside him, and as the old man dreams he is confronted by the REAL Feldman teen boy who constantly needs to be ""coached"" on how to act like a teenage boy in an old man's body. The old man also sees his wife through the window along with Joel's girlfriend (the hot dancer girl) as they both are packing things up like they're moving away. What does this mean? Does this signify that the old man and his wife had a fight and she's moving out or leaving him? Why is the dancer girl in there with her? Where is the old couple anyhow??Now it would only make sense that since we see Feldman play an old man in a teen's body, that we should also have scenes  or a side plot of the teen trapped in the old man's body (sort of like in '18 Again' starring George Burns where he was an old man with a teen spirit since he had a teenage boy trapped in his body). But no, THAT portion of the ""body switch"" is left ENTIRELY to these 2 or 3 dream sequences. The writers obviously didn't know what to do with that old man as teen boy half of the ""body switch"" so they later toss out any questions entirely as Feldman later telling this hot girl something to the likes of ""ever since this switch happened the old couple just seemed to disappear. I'm kinda worried about them."" Ok, there ya go, now no need to worry about where the old couple went, because the main story here involves Feldman playing the old man in the teen's body. He simply explained it away by saying ""I dont know where they went."" Ok, this is an obvious attempt at tossing something very important away for the sake of faster plot development, but even so, Feldman does not play the part with any sort of stability or consistency. How? Well, for one thing, he doesn't ALWAYS act like an old man in a teen's body! Whenever he hangs out with his friend played by Corey Haim, he acts very conservative and uptight as an old man, but whenever he is pursuing this hot dancer girl, he's your typical teenage boy. He just acts in whatever way is convenient for the plot to move along, and the writers have no regard for keeping the character consistent.So we see this when he purposefully tries to go after this hot dancer girl he mostly succeeds. Keep in mind that the dancer girl is still Joel's girlfriend, and Joel and Feldman are actually VERY GOOD FRIENDS in the film. So why is this old man  as Feldman suddenly chasing this young teenage girl?? Is he just really perverted and sees this as a chance to get some hot young action? Or is there some kind of connection with this girl and the dreams the old man keeps having?? Again, we are not told this important information, and are left just ACCEPTING these completely nonsensical situations.The funniest scene was where Feldman (still the old man in the teen's body) gets to go on a date with this girl, and he actually takes her back to the old man's house! Ok, now this teen all of a sudden has ACCESS to the old man's home??? HOW??? This scene gets even more ridiculous when FINALLY the writers let us know that this girl is actually supposed to be the old man's wife! Um.... HOW and WHY is she the old man's wife?? why? The girl has no sort of feeling or knowledge of being taken over by anyone else, but somehow, in some way, she's the old lady. Now we are left to figure out for ourselves that Feldman (the old man in the teen's body) must get with this girl. Will getting with this girl reverse the spell? Will it bring the old couple back? Will it have some affect on this old man's dreams? Again, we are NOT TOLD. So at this point I am just left accepting everything I am watching and being kind of bored to tears by it, because NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE.To add insult to injury, Joel and Feldman are in one scene outside of school, and Joel now acts and speaks as if he's not actually dating this dancer girl. He let's Feldman know that she is very hard to obtain in some way. He gets the feeling that his girlfriend is doing something behind his back, and when he later confronts her about it he becomes a complete sourpuss. The dynamics of a girl cheating on her boyfriend, the boyfriend's reaction, and why a best friend could so easily have woo'd this girl are all nonsensical. Again, we simply accept it and move on. And as far as the old couple? Still nowhere to be found.So finally, FINALLY, after a full 90 minutes into the film does it actually become interesting! How? Well, we get our obligatory prom scene, where Feldman takes this girl and Joel shows up drunk and angry. He confronts the couple, pushes the girl and Feldman and her run off somewhere else. To an dancehall filled with old people (A very funny part is where the girl asks Feldman ""whats your obsession with old people?"" Uh, I get it, it's because he's really AN OLD GUY so he always needs to be around old people). Anyway, here they presume dancing and Joel is so angry he decides to get a gun, get drunk, and get even. At this point the entire ""dream/body switch"" storyline is kept on hold (thank God) for a FARRRR more interesting premise of an angry boyfriend out to kill anyone who gets in the way of him getting back his girlfriend. The boyfriend then runs into the local punks who keep bugging him and in a very tense scene he has the main punk on his knees with the gun to his head and the other thugs standing helpless. Oh, I also forgot to mention that the punks in one scene find and beat up Feldman... why? I have no idea, as Feldman had no altercation with these thugs to give any reason for them to beat him up (again, more nonsensical crap so that we can stretch the plot). Ok, so Feldman at this point is with his girlfriend doing the same ""yoga"" meditation that the old man did with his wife that started this whole body switch (he's trying to reverse it now) when hears about this issue with Joel, so he takes the girl home to her worried parents and tries to stop Joel from killing this punk guy. It's really sad that it took THIS LONG to get to a scene of the movie that is actually good. I'm glad I stuck with it because I was seriously considering just shutting the movie off. If you find yourself saying the same thing, and finally get to the prom scene, give yourself a pat on a back for having survived that long watching this, because you FINALLY get to see a small semblance of a good movie. At this point the whole body switch storyline seems stupidier and more pointless than ever. This could have very easily have just been a movie about teenagers and a love triangle in school, and it would've been way better and made way more sense. Feldman's scene where he tries to talk down his best friend from shooting this guy is Feldman's ONLY good dialogue he is ever given in the entire film, and he also gives his only good performance in this one scene. He also imparts wisdom as an old man talking to young teens about to make a bad choice - the ONLY time this 'old man as teen boy' premise is actually used constructively. I would say the movie is worth watching just to see this scene, it's pretty powerful in its direction and dramatics, and this portion lasts for a good 20 minutes before the movie falls flat once again.The ONLY other scene that is pretty decent in this film is where Feldman is in the gym with this girl as she's working out her dance steps, and the film ""dream a little dream of me"" rock mix starts and Feldman begins his Michael Jackson style dancing. This scene is prominent in the trailer (which you'll have to Youtube to find, it's not on the DVD), and is actually filmed pretty well. A cute scene but you won't lose a wink of sleep if you don't see it so don't worry.But after this good part is over we go back to the annoying body switch storyline where for some reason Feldman warns this girl not to fall asleep, but we are never told why she isn't supposed to. Is it because then the spell can't be reversed? Is there some sort of time limit before they can be switched back? I dunno, again, I just accept what I see even though nothing is explained.The girls mom is always at odds with her and gives the girl a sleeping pill in her drink to get her to fall asleep. The girl does and Feldman sneaks into her window and lets out a very huge overly dramatic cry because she fell asleep. I mean gosh, it's not like she's DEAD or anything. ...sadly, she isn't, so no big twist ending here. Well, the spell gets reversed anyhow and we FINALLY see the old man in his home again with his wife, and Feldman walking to school with his new girlfriend, the dancer girl, or Joel's ex. So see, there was no time limit and no danger of the spell not being able to be reversed since the spell is REVERSED ANYWAY. Now HOW exactly was it reversed?? WE DON'T KNOW, because since Feldman's attempt at that strange ""yoga trance"" that caused this mess never got to be finished (remember, he had to get to Joel before he killed the punk), we dont' really know why the spell was reversed or how. It just was. Hence, Feldman telling the girl not to fall asleep and freaking out when she did meant nothing.But see, there are just too many questions and things that are never explained. WHAT WAS the connection between this girl and the old man's wife? Where was this old couple the whole time?? On vacation? Did they disappear because of the spell?? What was the connection between the old man and Feldman anyhow? What was so special about a yoga exercise between and man and his wife in the privacy of their own backyard and a boy bumping into a girl on her bike at a completely separate location? Were the stars aligned somehow? I mean, com'on, there could have been a bazillion other ways that this body switch could've happened without making it downright stupid as it was in this film. What was the problem with the old man and his wife that was CONSTANTLY implied during the old man's dream sequences?? What ever happened to Joel? Why was Corey Haim even cast in this movie? Why does this movie exist? Oh yea, I know that one at least.So what we have here is just a ridiculously convoluted story where nothing makes sense. The annoying direction and pacing of the story fills in too much time with corny musical montages, and the movie is about 40 minutes too long. Why not have some sort of side plot with the old man as the teenage boy? Why inject all this strange magical dream crap in there when it doesn't really do anything but make things more confusing? This was obviously a desperate attempt to try and take a different direction with this whole ""body switch"" plotline we've seen before, but the problem here is that the writers had no idea what sort of direction to take so they seemed to just write it as the  movie went along. Things are just too nonsensical and dumb to be interesting, and it ultimately makes for a very uninteresting movie. I can only imagine the horrific travesty that is 'dream a little dream 2.' You couldn't PAY ME to purchase that one and sit through it. The Corey's have no charm in this flick whatsoever, and especially since Haim's presence really means nothing, as he, well, does nothing the entire time.So in closing, in terms of technical aspects, this DVD is pathetic. The transfer looks absolutely terrible and practically VHS quality, and the sound quality is a joke. The dialogue was way too low sounding and the music way too high. Hence, whenever one of those annoying musical montages came up, I found myself having to lower the volume by about 10 notches, and when the songs stopped, raising the volume. All the DVD has is the movie and scene selection. No subtitles, no trailer, no nothing.Avoid, even if you are an 80s and Corey's fan. The 2 stars are very generous, and most of it is due to the Corey's themselves, a good title song that plays in the film and the credits, and that one very good 20 minutes of the movie that was mentioned above. So anyway, I'd suggest to stick with the classics 'License to Drive' and 'The Lost Boys' where the Corey's charm is in FULL swing! If you HAVE to see this film, do it on a night where you're prepared to just make jokes about the movie, and of course for that one scene that is actually good. Otherwise, don't bother.",2,"Convoluted Mess Buries Good Potential, Very Disappointing!",1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,17360,"['Dream', 'Little', 'Dream', 'outing', '80', 'heartthrobs', 'Coreys',

250343,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,630135222X,Steffan Piper,"[3, 4]","Who would've imagined, looking back in retrospect at the career on the once young Corey Feldman, that postThe Goonies,Stand By MeorThe Lost Boys, that he had yet one more classic film in him.Also, imagine this film starring Jason Robards and Harry Dean Stanton and the film still holding up after, now, almost 20 years later. It's absolutely stunning.The 1980's saw a plethora of movies flood the market about High School Life, Teen angst and Teenage love tales, mostly lead by John Hughes, the greatest director of this Genre of all time. But, as the '80's waned into a darkness andHair-bandswere all the rage, these films started to be pushed aside by adult coming-of-age films likeGrosse Pointe Blank(yes, 7 years later) and other oddities, likeReality Bites, that would make you question what life after High School was really all about. Sure, Teen movies were made en-masse in the '90's, but none had any real viewing power untilBrickcame about in 2005 and let you know just how absent films like these had been.But Corey Feldman ...This really was the Swan Song from an actor who would disappear from film-making and lose himself into bad career choices, bad life choices, a Michael Jackson obsession that would turn sour, Rehab at the Palms and everything else that a typical Hollywood story would be comprised of. Dream A Little Dream is incredibly well paced, well written and equally well acted. Corey Feldman shines in this as the 'Every Teen' with his annoying and whiny friend, who would remain whiny and annoying for years to come. Feldman gives a performance beyond his years here and makes himself into a equal with Jason Robards, even with the crazy bandana, ripped jeans and tennis racket air-guitar.Was this the last we'll see of this actor? Probably not. Like Crispin Glover, who also struggled with trouble, bad press and bad management in the '90's, heemergedstronger still andresilient.
