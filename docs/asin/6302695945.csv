As she starts corresponding with him, the big question becomes is he or isn't he guilty of the crimes he has been charged with?In 1989, Ted Bundy was a hot topic in the press as he confessed to various murders that he committed shortly before being put to death in the electric chair. Bundy was a good looking man who was smart, intelligent, even charismatic. So it was hard to believe that someone with those qualities could be responsible for such reprehensible crimes.Fatal Charm spins a similar web. Is a charming, good looking guy like Atkins responsible for the murder and sexual assaults of various women or isn't he? Amanda Peterson stars as a teenage girl who finds herself slowly drawn to Atkins.This was a solid premise on which to build a film upon. It was current. It was relevant. It spoke to what was going on at the time, but for some reason or another, Fatal Charm gives up on any attempt to develop its central premise and turns into another, completely different film.The film's central focus should have been on Peterson finding herself slowly seduced by Atkins and the cat & mouse type relationship that develops between these two characters. Fatal Charm gets bogged down by too many unnecessary sub-plots including courtroom scenes, scenes detailing Atkins day to day life in jail and his eventual escape. There's some mother daughter drama. There's some high school drama. They even throw in some erotica, which is set to soft lighting. There's some brief glimpses of gratuitous nudity and a romance novel type feel to these scenes all in an effort to try and spice up things.Atkins' character never comes across as the charming ladies man that the film needed. In fact, his character comes across as rather wimpy and pathetic. There isn't enough red herrings in Fatal Charm either. In order to generate suspense and to keep viewers guessing as to whether Atkins committed these crimes or not, there needs to be a variety of characters that we could pinpoint the blame on. Each of these characters would act like a piece in a puzzle and the viewer would have to figure out just exactly how each one of these characters fits into the bigger picture being painted. Sadly though, the answer to the film's central mystery is resolved halfway through.Watching Fatal Charm, I felt cheated. Here's a film that could have been a smart, intelligent, gripping thriller if they had just brought a greater level of focus and commitment to the film's central premise. Instead, Fatal Charm plays out like a hodgepodge of various ideas that were all thrown together. Every cliche, every Hollywood formula has been recycled to try and make something marketable. It's one big mess and none of it works. Even the film's director, a director who made Children of the Corn, didn't want credit for this.
