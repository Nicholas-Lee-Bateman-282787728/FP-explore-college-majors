Clendenin,"[15, 16]","This video diary is by soldiers and about soldiers, specifically, the 184 marines of Lima Company, a reserve unit from Columbus, Ohio, that was deployed to Iraq from February 28, 2005 to September 30, 2005. The film begins with their jaunty send-off and ends with their tearful reunions amongst a flag-waving crowd waiting for them in the rain. ""No one told us we couldn't,"" remarked one marine about filming their war experiences on home video cameras, ""so we did."" Many of the reservists thought they might be sidelined to some insignificant duty where they wouldn't screw up the real war. That was not to be. Lima Company saw significant battle and lost 23 comrades during their seven month tour. You see first hand how and why. The film alternates between their home videos of the war and their commentaries about their experiences once they got home. We also hear several families relive how and when they heard that they had lost a son in Lima Company. This is no Hollywood production, and that, along with learning what life is like for a soldier in battle, are the film's greatest strengths.",4,"real soldiers, real war, via home video",1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,1099,"['video', 'diary', 'soldiers', 'soldiers', 'specifically', '184', 'marines', 'Lima', 'Company', 'reserve', 'unit', 'Columbus', 'Ohio', 'was', 'deployed', 'Iraq', 'February', '28', '2005', 'September', '30', '2005', 'film', 'jaunty', 'send-off', 'ends', 'tearful', 'reunions', 'amongst', 'flag-waving', 'crowd', 'waiting', 'rain', 'one', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'remarked', 'one', 'marine', 'filming', 'war', 'experiences', 'home', 'video', 'cameras', 'did', 'Many', 'reservists', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'sidelined', 'insignificant', 'duty', 'where', 'would', ""n't"", 'screw', 'up', 'real', 'war', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Lima', 'Company', 'saw', 'significant', 'battle', 'lost', '23', 'comrades', 'seven', 'month', 'tour', 'see', 'first', 'hand', 'how', 'why', 'film', 'alternates', 'home', 'videos', 'war', 'commentaries', 'experiences', 'once', 'got', 'home', 'also', 'hear', 'several', 'families', 'relive', 'how', 'when', 'heard', 'had', 'lost', 'son', 'Lima', 'Company', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'learning', 'what', 'life', 'soldier', 'battle', 'are', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths']",N/A

It really shows why basic training and tech school training are so strict and harsh. These men have to survive under the most horrific circumstances and I will never look at a soldier the same way after seeing this. I've seen movies, yes, but these were real soldiers that documented their time in Iraq and it truly touched my soul.

In these interviews, the worn faces of the soldiers betray the pain and anguish of losing their fellow soldiers and friends. Footage of the several soldiers once they return home, show the difficulty that even those who survive have reintegrating back into society. If your looking for a movie that shows a raw unabashed look at the costs of war, I highly recommend Combat Diaries : The Marines of Lima Company.",5,War as Reality,1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,753,"['Hollywood', 'produced', 'many', 'war', 'movies', 'were', 'full', 'drama', 'blood', 'guts', 'Combat', 'Diaries', 'Marines', 'Lima', 'Company', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'documentry', 'personal', 'interviews', 'actual', 'video', 'footage', 'soldiers', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'part', 'Lima', 'Company', 'viewer', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'ever', 'could', 'interviews', 'worn', 'soldiers', 'betray', 'pain', 'anguish', 'losing', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'friends', 'Footage', 'several', 'soldiers', 'once', 'return', 'home', 'show', 'difficulty', 'even', 'who', 'survive', 'have', 'reintegrating', 'back', 'society', 'looking', 'movie', 'raw', 'unabashed', 'look', 'costs', 'war', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Combat', 'Diaries', 'Marines', 'Lima', 'Company']",N/A

American and Iraqi troops out of duty gave their lives for others, for America and the freedom-loving world, and the knowledge that freedom isn't free. It's dangerous to comment about this subject because it should be hallowed and respected; and it's easy to say or omit things that just aren't ""right"" because there are people who have really suffered tremendous loss. That's one of the ways that I've been moved by this film. This is a beautiful collection of videos and ""vignettes"" of brave young men and their families who were on the front line in Iraq(close to the Syrian border) clearing houses and villages; the ones that did the hard job and made it happen.
