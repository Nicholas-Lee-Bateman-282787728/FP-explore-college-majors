They do not even constitute a ""rocumentary"" as the material on Les Paul here is not sufficiently detailed. This is a birthday celebration for a rock and roll pioneer near the end of his life. Les Paul died two years later.While Les Paul contributed considerably to rock and roll in terms of songs and especially in his invention and improvement of musical instruments (guitars) he was not as well know as he deserved to be. For many of the younger generation this gathering of better known musicians (Steve Miller, Keith Richards, Bonnie Raitt, Tony Bennett and others- some in person, some on video) is an affirmation of the older gentleman. Where will rock and roll be today without the solid body guitar?It is a delightful evening filled with several short performances and short stories/conversations in a party atmosphere. The performances are very good, the audio and video both excellent. You get both the blue-ray disc and the DVD for one low price and that makes it worth adding to your collection.

For over 75 years, he made hit records, made Gibson famous with the Les Paul solid body guitar.Check out his Music with Mary Ford!

Lewandowski,"[0, 0]","Perhaps I should have read other reviews more carefully and read the synopsis more carefully but what I got wasn't what I expected and that is my responsibility.  However, I gave this disc four stars because from a historical perspective and to see how well Les Paul interacts with an audience and other performers it is valuable.  I had no idea he had severe arthritis which, at age 90, makes his performance all the more amazing.  The recordings are of good quality and the duets are enjoyable.  Will I watch this once every two weeks - no.  Will I treasure this volume in my collection - definitely.  If you want a classic ""concert album"" you might want to reconsider but if you want some good music and a lot of personality and insights - this is worth it.  I agree with the comment about interviews dubbed over the music.
