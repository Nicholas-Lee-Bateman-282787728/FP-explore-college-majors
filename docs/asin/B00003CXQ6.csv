Where is Nanny? Where is &quot;especially the other stars of the movie&quot; Pongo and Perita aka the proud parents of the original dalmations? I felt so sorry for Glenn Close and all of the garbage and disgusting acts she had to do. The new characters are much worst and they had too many of them. Oh God please save me from that Auston Powers wanna be parrot. He was so annoying and he tried to steal the movie from everyone but Cruelella and the puppies still hung in there of course. I think Le Pelt has a real wardrobe problem. The butler is the average stero type which he sides with the bad guys but later on he realizes it is wrong and joins up with the good guys. I think Glen Close is more of a comedian than a very evil vilaness but however she makes a great match up Cruella DeVil like the animation movie. A lot of dogs in the movie was bearly used or not used at all. The previews ruined the entire movie by showing way too many clips of the climax: Cruelella disgustingly getting turned into a giant cake. Anyway the real winner in the entire movie was actually Glenn Close. In fact I heard from a certain source that Glenn took home a giant fortune of money for playing the part as Cruellella. Even though the sequel was not good, I hope that they will make another movie with the Dalmatians and Glen Close.

532298,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B00003CXQ6,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[3, 5]","I really had high hopes for this one; Glenn Close reprising her role as Cruella and G&eacute;rard Depardieu as her costar. However, it really is just more of the same, and sadly even sillier than the first. This time, Close is just too over-the-top to really be as delicious as she was in the first outing. Even the slapstick at the end as she gets her comeuppance from the animals (again) is not as funny. The romantic leads are duller than dishwater as well, and there is no Joan Plowright to add an extra dollop of much needed class and humor. Still, from reading the other reviews on Amazon, there must be a place in people's hearts for this film...I would guess that children (very young children) might find it amusing, although some of the plot material is a little unsettling: plenty of talk about killing animals and taxidermy, red paint thrown at a fur coat to simulate blood during an animal protest, as well as some of the prison/makeshift psychiatric hospital scenes thatare also disturbing.On to the plot: years after the first movie, Cruella has spent time in a prison facility where she has been undergoing psychiatric treatment (including electro-shock therapy) to make her have an aversion to fur coats. Her successful treatment allows her to be paroled, and she is back on the streets. Coincidentally, her parole officer Chloe owns Dipstick, one of the Dalmatians that Cruella terrorized in the first movie. During her first appointment with Chloe, Cruella coincidentally notices a photo of an animal shelter on Chloe's desk and decides to be its benefactor. Dipstick & Dottie (Chloe's other dalmatian) also (coincidentally) are about to have a litter of pups...just in time for Cruella's treatment to wear off during visit #2 to Chloe, when the sounding of Big Ben's clock chimes (which coincidentally happens just as she is sitting in Chloe's office where her dalmatians just coincidentally happen to be roosting at the moment). Who wrote this crap?!?Now that she is back into fur coats again, Cruella drags out Anita's sketch of the infamous dalmatian fur coat from movie #1 and decides she wants 102 dalmatians this time...enough to make a hood, too. She teams up with furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt (Depardieu). Jean-Pierre is a cross between a punk-rocker and Liberace...not really sure where the writers were going with this character.Naturally, there is chemistry between Chloe and the owner of the animal shelter (at least on script there is), and they team up to keep Cruella from killing the dalmatians for her new coat.Although the story is lacking, the special effects are wonderful. The costume, hair, and set designers did a spectacular job as well...if only the story had been as carefully planned. Sigh...On a bright note, this DVD really has some amazing extras, which is surprising since the new release of the live action101 Dalmatiansis totally devoid of extras. Here's what you get:*Deleted scene: ""Cruella's Release,"" which shows more details about what happens as she is getting out of prison...amusing, but not really missed from the movie.*3 featurettes: ""Creating Cruella"" (includes interviews with Close), ""Animal Actors,"" and ""Designing Dalmatians.""*Audio commentary w/director Kevin Lima and the animal coordinator/trainers*""Puppy Action Overload"" music video with puppy auditions, outtakes, and scenes from the film*""Dalmatians 101"": featurette on  how to pick a dog that fits your personality, covered with scenes from the film,

parrot talk, and more.*DVD-Rom feature: ""Cruella's Costume Creator.""Specs: DTS 5.1 Digital Surround Sound (THX-Certified) and Widescreen (1:85:1), enhanced for 16x9 TVs.Overall: mildly (emphasis on

Anyway I really didn't see much values in this family film, apart from good ol' Glenn Close and the dogs. Yes, the dogs are still very cute and make the movie bearable enough. However, the story is absurd, the typical predictability deal is here in this movie and I didn't laugh very much. Apart from the ending where Cruella literally gets baked, this film is pretty much comedy-free. Kids will find it hard to laugh at this flick and to generally enjoy this film too. Even they're little minds will not be tricked by the movies dotty silliness. Adults will be dragged along by kids to see this sequel, but I'm sure none of them will think too much of it. Sure, 102 Dalmatians has some good points - the groovy opening song, Glenn Close's excellent performance, the funny ending and the cuteness of the dogs - but ultimately it doesn't succeed.

The end result is borderline pathetic.The story begins with Cruella De Vil being brainwashed by scientists to feel love and affection when she sees a dog much like Dr. Pavlov conditioned his canine subjects to salivate at the sound of a ringing bell. She is released on probation under the skeptical eye of her parole officer Chloe (Alice Evans), who incidentally loves Dalmatians. When Cruella becomes involved with a local animal shelter run by Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd), it seems that she has become completely reformed, but upon the ringing of Big Ben (the biggest Pavlovian bell of them all) she inevitably reverts to her old ways and is soon scheming and screaming for the Dalmatian coat she has wanted for so long and the main frame of the original plot comes back into focus.I will never know why movies like this use this method of storytelling. Of course money plays a big role, but if film sequels and remakes broke free of the originals they are based, who knows what the story possibilities could hold for the industry. Instead of using the original as a crutch, the film-makers could have turned ""102 Dalmatians"" into a character study of Cruella De Vil, or taken the story to new heights instead of reusing old plot devices. They could have even went back to the hand-drawn animation format, which is better suited for the material in the first place.Another crucial flaw has been carried over from the previous film. Instead of getting top billing, the animal characters are turned into secondary characters and used either as MacGuffins or slapstick. Even Oddball, a Dalmatian puppy who grows insecure due to a lack of spots, does not generate the same wattage as the original cartoon puppies did back in 1961. This affects not only the suspense, but also the overall participation of the audience. If nobody cares for the animals, the entire story is derailed.""102 Dalmatians"" is not a bad film. Like all Disney productions, there is an inherent charm throughout and fun is never lacking. Gerard Depardieu as Monsieur Le Pelt, whose outlandish costumes give Cruella's a run for her money, is a brilliant addition to the saga. The productionis also worthy of praise particularly the scenes in Cruella's gothic home, which is unfortunately underused.Glenn Close once again gives a tour de force performance, but Ms. De Vil is a star in her own right and cannot be embodied by an actress of flesh and blood. She belongs in a world without boundaries or conventions.

Perez ""Jose""","[1, 1]","Upfront, it should be noted that ""102 Dalmatians"" is far darker and more violent than the original - either the live action or animated versions.  That said, this is one of those rare sequels that actually surpasses the first film in a number of ways.  First, the story is less ingrained in our heads, so its fresher and unexpectedly more effective.  Second, there are plot twists to rival a gangster flick, with Cruella DeVil first framed as a puppy lover, and then as the nasty character we all love to hate.  Third - and most impressive - is Glenn Close, who chews up every scene here in a Golden Globe nominated performance that makes her far scarier and more effective as a villain.  She's almost channeling the spirit of Alex in ""Fatal Attraction"" with her vile manner and spitted dialogue.  This is an actress at the top of her form - part Alex and part Norma Desmond (who she played to raves, and a Tony Award, in ""Sunset Boulvard.)  Bluntly said, Close gives a tremendous performance as the puppy-coat wearing diva - it's high camp at its best, and she makes the film soar in unexpected, hystrionic ways.

532313,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXQ6,Matthew Horner,"[11, 14]","The idea of movie sequels took off thirty years ago and has been going nonstop ever since. As an idea, it makes sense. TV series have conditioned several generations of viewers to want to see the same characters and often essentially the same story over and over again. A movie sequel is usually a fairly safe financial bet, as it can be expected, on average, to take in about seventy percent of the original's gross. So, it was only natural that Disney wanted to cash in on the success of the live action version of 101 Dalmatians. The result, 102 Dalmatians, failed. There were several reasons for this, but the main one may be that the original story is self-contained. Despite the sequel's attempts to be different, in the end it all boils down to the same thing: Cruella DeVille will go to any lengths to obtain the puppies from which she plans to make a Dalmatian fur coat.This time Cruella has been rehabilitated by a doctor aptly named Pavlov. Chloe [Alice Evans], her probabtion officer, doesn't buy the change, but Cruella [""Call me Ella, not Cruella!""]really does act like a changed woman. She has Alonso [Tim McInnerny], her manservant, lock away her fur coats, since the sight of them now makes her sick. She buys a failing animal shelter and transforms it into a showplace. She even has her own dog, a dreadful thing that looks like a rat. [Why on earth they decided to make this particular dog her pet is beyond me.] The world adores Cruella. One day something happens that reverses the effects of her rehab. Cruella is back with a vengeance, and some of the finest Dalmatian puppies happen to belong to Chloe. As in the original, every character but Cruella fumbles everything, and, for the most part, it's up to the dogs to save themselves.Glenn Close again plays Cruella. Again she is delightful. But a great star turn does not a great movie make. 102 Dalmatians is predictable and overblown. Many of the jokes are best understood by adults, but this is the kind of movie grownups use to baby-sit their children, who won't get much of the humor. There are a lot of cute dogs and other animals, but they lack the charm of the ones in other kids movies such as Babe. With the exception of a truly obnoxious parrot, none of them can talk, yet all of them are shown to have the fully developed emotions of human beings. Personally, I find this makes them a bit creepy. There is also something odd about the movie. There is not a single human character younger than thirty. What kind of children's movie has no children in it? The original didn't, but it was itself a clever remake of what was essentially a long cartoon. Perhaps this sequel would have been more successful if it had had kids in it for kids to relate to.102 Dalmatians will divert the young ones, but it is not something they will wish to see over and over again. It is one of Disney's weaker efforts. And, yes, I do like dogs.",2,Acclaimed actress goes to the dogs...again!,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2907,"['idea', 'movie', 'sequels', 'took', 'off', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'been', 'going', 'nonstop', 'ever', 'idea', 'sense', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'conditioned', 'several', 'generations', 'viewers', 'want', 'see', 'same', 'characters', 'often', 'essentially', 'same', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'movie', 'sequel', 'usually', 'fairly', 'safe', 'financial', 'bet', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'average', 'take', 'about', 'seventy', 'percent', 'original', 'gross', 'So', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'Disney', 'wanted', 'cash', 'success', 'live', 'action', 'version', '101', 'Dalmatians', 'result', '102', 'Dalmatians', 'failed', 'were', 'several', 'reasons', 'main', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'original', 'story', 'self-contained', 'sequel', 'attempts', 'be', 'different', 'end', 'down', 'same', 'thing', 'Cruella', 'DeVille', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'obtain', 'puppies', 'make', 'Dalmatian', 'fur', 'coat.This', 'time', 'Cruella', 'been', 'rehabilitated', 'doctor', 'aptly', 'named', 'Pavlov', 'Chloe', '[', 'Alice', 'Evans', ']', 'probabtion', 'officer', ""n't"", 'buy', 'change', 'Cruella', '[', 'Call', 'Ella', 'not', 'Cruella', ']', 'really', 'act', 'changed', 'woman', 'Alonso', '[', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', ']', 'manservant', 'lock', 'away', 'fur', 'coats', 'sight', 'now', 'sick', 'failing', 'animal', 'shelter', 'transforms', 'showplace', 'even', 'own', 'dog', 'dreadful', 'thing', 'rat', '[', 'Why', 'earth', 'decided', 'make', 'particular', 'dog', 'pet', ']', 'world', 'Cruella', 'One', 'day', 'something', 'effects', 'rehab', 'Cruella', 'back', 'vengeance', 'finest', 'Dalmatian', 'puppies', 'happen', 'belong', 'Chloe', 'original', 'character', 'Cruella', 'everything', 'most', 'part', 'up', 'dogs', 'save', 'themselves.Glenn', 'Close', 'again', 'plays', 'Cruella', 'Again', 'delightful', 'great', 'star', 'turn', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'make', '102', 'Dalmatians', 'predictable', 'overblown', 'Many', 'jokes', 'are', 'best', 'understood', 'adults', 'kind', 'movie', 'grownups', 'use', 'baby-sit', 'children', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'humor', 'are', 'lot', 'cute', 'dogs', 'other', 'animals', 'lack', 'charm', 'ones', 'other', 'kids', 'movies', 'such', 'Babe', 'exception', 'truly', 'obnoxious', 'parrot', 'none', 'can', 'talk', 'yet', 'are', 'shown', 'have', 'fully', 'developed', 'emotions', 'human', 'beings', 'Personally', 'find', 'bit', 'creepy', 'also', 'something', 'odd', 'movie', 'not', 'single', 'human', 'character', 'younger', 'thirty', 'What', 'kind', 'children', 'movie', 'children', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'clever', 'remake', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'long', 'cartoon', 'Perhaps', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'had', 'had', 'kids', 'kids', 'relate', 'to.102', 'Dalmatians', 'will', 'divert', 'young', 'ones', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'wish', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'Disney', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'yes', 'do', 'dogs']",102 Dalmatians VHS

Yes, everyone knows how it ends (as it does with all Disney movies) but you'll find enjoyment in between!!I recommend it!!",5,a delight...,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,695,"['can', 'watch', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'What', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'movie', ""'m"", 'kid', 'adult', 'body-I', 'will', 'admit', 'it-', 'think', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'better', 'first', '101', 'Dalmatian', 'movie', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie', 'Waddlesworth', 'who', 'rott', 'really', 'parrot', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'movie', 'more', 'laughs', 'giggles', 'sneers', 'Disney', 'movie', 'made', 'kids', 'BIG', 'kids', 'Dalmatians', 'mission', 'other', 'movie-is', 'stop', 'Cruella', 'evil', 'ways', 'Yes', 'everyone', 'how', 'Disney', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'find', 'enjoyment', 'recommend']",102 Dalmatians VHS

It's largely a rehash of the first film, bringing along many of the qualities but less of the original cast.Glenn Close was still as menacing as ever.  The scene of her subconsciously reverting to her old ways when hearing the chime of Big Ben was classic for Cruella de Vil.  The Dalmatian spots everywhere might have been overdoing it, but Close saves the scene with her performance.Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is again decent but largely forgettable...I'm looking up everyone's names as I'm writing this.  The butler Alonzo, played again by Tim McInnerny, the only other returning cast member, gets a bigger role and he's somewhat amusing in it, though he doesn't quite fill the shoes of the two thugs from the last film.  The fur designer, Jean Pierre Le Pelt, played by G&eacute;rard Depardieu, was supposed to be eccentric, but that largely fell flat.  An exception would have to be the driving scene in Paris.  I loved how he and Cruella complained about the driving skills of everyone around them, including Alonzo.I think I might have liked this film more if there had been more of a connection among the protagonists to the first film...the antagonists are fine on that front.  Our new female lead, Chloe Simon, played by Alice Evans, has adopted one of the original fifteen puppies from the first film, Dipstick, and a previously unknown mate named Dotty, who have bred a litter of their own.  Okay, I got no impression that Rodger and Anita planned to give up any of their many dogs in the first film?  How did Chloe find them and convince them otherwise?  And why would it be one of the puppies that their original dogs actually brought into this world?  All these questions and more will not be answered and therein lies my problem.  I cannot make a connection with Chloe or this guy named Kevin Shepherd, played by Ioan Gruffudd, who has become the film's male lead as he runs an animal shelter.  His parrot is kind of funny, but that does not save this group.If you liked the first film, you'll probably have luke-warm feelings about this one.  I was under whelmed and my DVD's currently in a box somewhere.  I'll leave the purchasing decision up to you.

532324,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B00003CXQ6,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[2, 3]","""102 Dalmatians"" offers audiences more of one of the most wicked creatures in motion pictures, the outrageous and evil Cruella DeVille. Like the original movie, Glenn Close who plays Cruella, steals the film and this is not an easy task, what with the beautiful dogs, wonderful special effects, and great story. The film producers knew that to harbor Cruella in one film wasn't enough so a sequel was evident. In this outing Cruella is released from prison after being cured of her addiction to killing dogs to fulfill her fantasy of making a coat. However, it is only a matter of time before Cruella's evil ways start to emerge and she eventually resorts back to her old ways, but this time not only does she want a coat made out of dalmatian fur, but she also wants a hood. The movie is hilarious, funny, sad, and over the top, but most of all entertaining. ""102 Dalmatinas"" wasn't as successful as the original, but it became an even bigger hit thanks to the home video market. This DVD has many bonuses, among them a deleted scene called ""Cruella's Release"", a Behind-The-Scenes Featurette, and audio commentary by director Kevin Lima.
