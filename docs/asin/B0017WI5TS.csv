1158106,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0017WI5TS,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Oh, what a fun movie this is! It's about the 1980s, so I guess it's appropriate that the movie sparkles, really has that crisp, quirky humor that made me fall in love with Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street.This is a most atypical high school movie. Chance Marquis (Tad Hilgenbrinck) is the new kid at an International School in Europe. He's tall and lean, extremely good looking, very bright, has a great sense of humor, and is out-of-closet gay. His first day at school, he wears a top hat, bow tie and walking stick.The bully jock of the football (soccer) team is not ready for this. So far, so obvious. The boy who lives next door to Chance is a beautifully buffed young stud who is also on the football team. He also has a garage band, which is pretty awful. He starts being friends with Chance, and from the glimpse we get of Chance's fantasies about him, he's rather attracted to the stud next door.The people in this movie are such characters, you are tempted to consider them shallow stereotypes. But one by one, they prove to be a good bit more than that. In the last few minutes of the movie, even Chance's marine sergeant father proves the have more depth than we had seen before then. Apparently also more than Chance had seen.There's the smart girl of mixed race who talks wise-ass but has a heart of gold, the nerdy photographer with extreme acne and nervous ticks who turns out to be rather delightfully devious when needed. They are Chance's closest friends through most of the movie. Then there's Chances pre-pubescent sister who is probably the smartest one in the family, the aging drag queen who gives Chance encouragement to enter a drag contest where he sings magnificently dressed in his deceased mother's black and sequined gown. Apparently she had been a singer too.But the climax is the Battle of the High School Bands, where . . . oh, why spoil it for you? Suffice to say I could not help thinking once again of Johnny Depp. Cry Baby, you know.A fun, fun movie. The kids are brilliant, the script is up to the witty repartee required, the costumes are really very 1980s (which I hated, by the way), and I can't imagine anyone except perhaps a homophobe not enjoying it.",4,A Truly Memorable Character is Created; A Star is Born?,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2192,"['Oh', 'what', 'fun', 'movie', '1980s', 'so', 'guess', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'sparkles', 'really', 'crisp', 'quirky', 'humor', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'Johnny', 'Depp', '21', 'Jump', 'Street.This', 'most', 'atypical', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'Chance', 'Marquis', 'Tad', 'Hilgenbrinck', 'new', 'kid', 'International', 'School', 'Europe', 'tall', 'lean', 'extremely', 'good', 'looking', 'very', 'bright', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'out-of-closet', 'gay', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'top', 'hat', 'bow', 'tie', 'walking', 'stick.The', 'bully', 'jock', 'football', 'soccer', 'team', 'not', 'ready', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'obvious', 'boy', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'Chance', 'beautifully', 'buffed', 'young', 'stud', 'who', 'also', 'football', 'team', 'also', 'garage', 'band', 'pretty', 'awful', 'being', 'friends', 'Chance', 'glimpse', 'get', 'Chance', 'fantasies', 'rather', 'attracted', 'stud', 'door.The', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'such', 'characters', 'are', 'tempted', 'consider', 'shallow', 'stereotypes', 'one', 'one', 'prove', 'be', 'good', 'bit', 'more', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'even', 'Chance', 'marine', 'sergeant', 'father', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'had', 'seen', 'then', 'Apparently', 'also', 'more', 'Chance', 'had', 'smart', 'girl', 'mixed', 'race', 'who', 'wise-ass', 'heart', 'gold', 'nerdy', 'photographer', 'extreme', 'acne', 'nervous', 'ticks', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'delightfully', 'devious', 'when', 'needed', 'are', 'Chance', 'closest', 'friends', 'most', 'movie', 'Then', 'Chances', 'pre-pubescent', 'sister', 'who', 'probably', 'smartest', 'one', 'family', 'aging', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'Chance', 'encouragement', 'enter', 'drag', 'contest', 'where', 'magnificently', 'dressed', 'deceased', 'mother', 'black', 'sequined', 'gown', 'Apparently', 'had', 'been', 'singer', 'climax', 'Battle', 'High', 'School', 'Bands', 'where', 'oh', 'why', 'spoil', 'say', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'thinking', 'once', 'again', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Cry', 'Baby', 'know.A', 'fun', 'fun', 'movie', 'kids', 'are', 'brilliant', 'script', 'witty', 'repartee', 'required', 'costumes', 'are', 'really', 'very', '1980s', 'hated', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'perhaps', 'homophobe', 'not', 'enjoying']",N/A

Bad acting, bad dialogue, and completely unoriginal and banal plot and characters.  Perhaps the dialogue was intended to be arch, but the actors just didn't have the talent to pull it off.  Instead, everything seemed stilted and fake.  Moreover, their lack of talent and/or charimsa diminshed any sympathy that a viewer might feel for them.  While the characters are in ""sympathetic"" situations, we seen them all before -- and depicted in much more effective ways.  In short, I was bored and unmoved.

1158109,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0017WI5TS,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[12, 14]","Chance Marquis (played by Tad Hilgenbrink, whom some may remember from the ""American Pie ... Band Camp"" movie) is 16 year old Army brat, living with his stern widower military father and his precocious younger sister in Belgium, where he starts his sophomore year at an ""international"" school.  The school seems to have the typical US high school cliques, rendered a bit more ludicrous by the various accents of the students from various countries.  Chance has a definite flair for the dramatic, coming to school his first day wearing a cape, top hat and walking with a cane, which immediately makes him the target of the bullying captain of the football team.  Also on the football team, as well as living next door to Chance and his family, is the hunky Levi (Brett Chukerman from ""Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds), who quickly becomes the focus of Chance's fantasies, and actually is open-minded enough to befriend Chance, until his buddies on the team tell him it is soooooo not cool to be ""friends with a f**.""  Chance hangs out mostly with two other misfits, the tough and sarcastic Twyla and the nerdy school photographer Hank, who conspire with him to get even with the bully.  A night out at a gay club leads to Chance's performing in drag, a fact that becomes widely known at the school, much to Chance's chagrin.Spot-on writing, a great cast and attention to detail makes ""The Curiosity of Chance"" (2006) a delightful ""coming of age"" film about standing up for yourself and your dreams.  The setting in the 1980's, complete with clothes, hair and lots of music from that era, can lead to a conclusion that this is really a gay version of a John Hughes-like high school comedy from that era, but with a current sense of activism and self-respect, a la ""Napoleon Dynamite."" It may have been low budget, but they made the most of every dollar on screen.Winner of several ""best ..."" awards at recent stateside gay film festivals, this US production was filmed in Belgium.

1158112,A1HD7EQMEES9A7,B0017WI5TS,John P.,"[1, 2]","It's a shame that almost all gay themed movies just reinforce negative stereotypes of gay people.  They have to be obsessed with fashion, they end up in drag, they have effeminate mannerisms, they are horrible at sports, etc. etc.  Why would a gay person cheer this type of movie? I know a lot of gay people and they don't act like these sadly predicable characters.As far as the movie. whoever wrote the screenplay did not live in the 80's.  Anyone who was out of the closet in high school in the 80's would have been beaten repeatably and run out of school if not the city, there would have not been the big kiss in the hallway.  This story is a fantasy immersed in simplistic characters.  The suffering and anguish gay people suffered in the 80's is magically transformed with fairy dust. As a fantasy is falls short, the depth of the characters and story lines is paper thin and unimaginative.If you are gay person who fits these stereotypes you may enjoy this movie.  For the majority of gay people and straight people I would think they would find this movie boring and insulting. The majority of gay men and women are just like everyone else and they need more movies to represent how they fit into our society.

Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some of the ""near-Addictive"" as well).  For some movies, I'll share even a short review with you, as follows below.  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))While this film doesn't merit a lot of comment, here're just a few observations---- It's cute, it's innocuous and it's in no way innovative.  What it does do is reinforce---in a fun way---the principles of standing up for oneself, appreciating the friends one does have and, most importantly, keeping hope (re: that last 2-person scene).- This definitely will appeal to the high school crowd (what's really goin' on here---is this just a little different take on the ""High School Musical"" theme?).- Just a thought or two about our leads---Hilgenbrink:  a little ""one-note"" in his come-across (but at only age 23 or so when shooting, and with not much in past filmed performances, he has the greater potential of the two male leads)  //  Chuckerman:  just because you're cute doesn't mean you can act (gonna get in trouble for that one---from girls, maybe boys) and gave a rather wooden performance (he was much better at ""dragging us into the picture"" with his performance in the year 2000 Short:  ""Crush"").  Do have to allow him this, though---the facial expression he gives us, while walking away after ""the kiss,"" was a priceless moment  //  Aldevina Da Silva's work here was tippy-top above the rest.

The movie was set in the 80's (best decade in my life so far) and had a very interesting cast of characters.  Family moves to a new area and the kids start school and that's where things start for Chance.  At home the father is a widower ex military man but pretty darned compassionate to his sons strange choices considering his demeanor played by Chris Mulkey.  The film has it's serious moments but allot of comedy too.  Very light and witty in some moments and others brought back memories of when I was bullied in school as a young man struggling with my own sexuality.  I think anyone that was not popular was branded as something and always had their antagonist to deal with.  If I didn't help them with cheating on tests I was bullied and threatened so I totally got Chance.  I just wish I had his tenacity to let things slide off my back when it got to be too much but with my hot Irish temper that just wasn't me!  lol Never managed to get beaten up, some angel on my shoulder I guess.  In any case Chance was not alone, he had an interesting set of friends... a dorky photographer played by Pieter Van Nieuwenhuyze with his secret brief case, a misfit young woman with a mouth played by Aldevina Da Silva (LOVED her lines) and a jock / football player with his own inner struggles played by Brett Chukerman.  The school principal was hilarious (played by Magali Uytterhaegen) who was apparently very odoriferous with a strange accent cracked me up!  You will also meet a gaggle of drag queens and other assorted characters.  HEY it was the 80's, everything was going on then.  In any case I hope this movie is released in Blu-Ray eventually as I would love to add it to my collection.",5,The Curiosity of Chance was thourougly enjoyable for me!,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1798,"['lead', 'character', 'Chance', 'Marquis', 'played', 'Tad', 'Hilgenbrink', 'was', 'someone', 'could', 'totally', 'relate', 'movie', 'was', 'set', '80', 'best', 'decade', 'life', 'so', 'far', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'cast', 'characters', 'Family', 'new', 'area', 'kids', 'start', 'school', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'Chance', 'home', 'father', 'widower', 'ex', 'military', 'man', 'pretty', 'darned', 'compassionate', 'sons', 'strange', 'choices', 'considering', 'demeanor', 'played', 'Chris', 'Mulkey', 'film', 'serious', 'moments', 'allot', 'comedy', 'too', 'Very', 'light', 'witty', 'moments', 'others', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'when', 'was', 'bullied', 'school', 'young', 'man', 'struggling', 'own', 'sexuality', 'think', 'anyone', 'was', 'not', 'popular', 'was', 'branded', 'something', 'always', 'had', 'antagonist', 'deal', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheating', 'tests', 'was', 'bullied', 'threatened', 'so', 'totally', 'got', 'Chance', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'tenacity', 'let', 'things', 'slide', 'off', 'back', 'when', 'got', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'hot', 'Irish', 'temper', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'lol', 'Never', 'managed', 'get', 'beaten', 'up', 'angel', 'shoulder', 'guess', 'case', 'Chance', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'had', 'interesting', 'set', 'friends', 'dorky', 'photographer', 'played', 'Pieter', 'Van', 'Nieuwenhuyze', 'secret', 'brief', 'case', 'misfit', 'young', 'woman', 'mouth', 'played', 'Aldevina', 'Da', 'Silva', 'LOVED', 'lines', 'jock', '/', 'football', 'player', 'own', 'inner', 'struggles', 'played', 'Brett', 'Chukerman', 'school', 'principal', 'was', 'hilarious', 'played', 'Magali', 'Uytterhaegen', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'very', 'odoriferous', 'strange', 'accent', 'cracked', 'up', 'will', 'also', 'meet', 'gaggle', 'drag', 'queens', 'other', 'assorted', 'characters', 'HEY', 'was', '80', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'then', 'case', 'hope', 'movie', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', 'eventually', 'would', 'love', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

I don't quite see why the movie had to be set in some version of Europe given the only venues that we see in this movie are limited to the school, Chance's house and the drag bar for the most part. Setting aside, this is ultimately a character-driven story and the venue doesn't really matter. The movie was also set in the 80's, which was presented in terms of some of the fashion choices and the music, but not much else.At the end of the day the story is sort of timeless or appropriate to pretty much any period since coming out was a thing.It's interesting to note that Tad Hilgenbrinck was the same guy who played Matt Stifler in American Pie Presents Band Camp - as in the try-hard player kid who was trying to imitate his brother. So from overconfident douche to determined gay teen - that's an interesting range. He wasn't necessarily amazing in the role, but he did pretty well for himself.The movie has a lot going on with the different characters and their motivations, but never really has the time to fully explore things. Yes, Chance is still the primary character that we need to follow around. And thus we really shouldn't have had too many auxiliary characters. I think the only characters that I wish we had learned more about were Chance's family. For the most part they were just background characters who acted based on stereotypes and not much else.

Oh, wait, no, it's more like walking into one of those stores that has so many open jars of potpourri that there's no room left for oxygen and every breath actually tastes like dead flowers.  One hates to hate on a movie that's so obviously well-meaning (except of course for hanging half the jokes on the Smelly Fat Lady); it's like saying ""no! no!"" to a puppy.The title character, ""Chance,"" has just transferred to what appears to be a foreign school for English speakers, somewhere in Europe.  Everyone but the three leads appears to have some kind of accent (the Football Team Bully sounds vaguely Germanic with a peculiar overlay of Noo Yawk that just comes across as a really bad De Niro imitation -- the kind of thing the director should have squashed on Day One but didn't), but nobody speaks anything BUT English.  Chance likes to dress in extravagantly dorky outfits (see cover photo) which, this being High School after all, generally win him well-deserved derision.  Things just wallow along in obviousness until a really cool drag queen (Danny Calandar, who somehow got dragged into this) gives him some good advice and a few things in life to which he might reasonably aspire.Everything ends just as you would expect it to after watching the first fifteen minutes.
