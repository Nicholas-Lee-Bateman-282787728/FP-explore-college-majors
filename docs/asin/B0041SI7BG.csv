Loved his work in The Wire,Rock'n'Rolla,Takers,Thor,and more recently Luther (best TV series the British have put out in years, I'm still waiting on Season3). Second, I think this movie was just as challenging for me to watch as it was for him to play the role of Malcolm Grey. Third,this is the darkest role you'll ever see Idris play and believe me,it is hard to watch. The movie illustrates just how fragile the mind can be.There were so many twists and turns in the movie,such that just when you thought you knew where the plot was leading you, it took a sharp right turn and jumped off the cliff. I've never seen him in such a vulnerable role. Idris' performance showed just how serious of an actor he really is. The movie directing was good once you got past the combat scene(sorry,but it was terrible), granted the combat scene was very important for the plot, but they could've been better. Sincerely,I've seen better gunfights on Modern Warfare 3. Finally, the reason I gave this movie a 4 star instead of a 5 is because I'm an Action flick type of guy and i don't do emotional movies..Why? cause they make me feel sad afterwards. Nevertheless, I did jump at the opportunity to watch this movie because it had Idris Elba in it and I don't regret it, even though i thought it was an action flick to begin with.

In ""Legacy"" the audience gets to see the complete emotional ""melt down"" of Malcolm Grey (fabulously acted by Idris Elba).  This film is marvelously directed and although there are other actors/actresses in the film, to me it really is all Elba's show--he truly deserved an Academy Award for his performance as a tormented former ""special forces"" soldier that performed ruthlessly and bravely while caring out some heinous duties and suffering extreme torture and presently is in hiding because of narrow escape with his life from a failed secret mission to catch Terrorist and now is  more or less forgotten while he views his brother on TV receiving accolades while running for president .

While Elba is convincing as a man who's mind devolves into delusion, the storyline is nearly non-existent, patchwork. Mental disorder is hard enough to capture as entertainment. It's even more difficult to present a story from only the perspective of a warped mind's concoctions. The film needed at least one other character's viewpoint to give the audience validation (or not) of the main character's perceptions. Unfortunately, this didn't happen, leaving the audience hostage to the constant question of reality or fantasy. All characters introduced, with the exception of two, were products of the main character's mind. While one was a peripheral character that was on screen for about 5 mins, the other was served as the story's villain. He is only glimpsed through the eyes of the sick character. The end is designed to make you think, but it doesn't go far enough (especially without at least one additional vantage).",1,What?!!!,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1003,"['purchase', 'movie', 'feeling/question', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'Elba', 'convincing', 'man', 'who', 'mind', 'delusion', 'storyline', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'patchwork', 'Mental', 'disorder', 'hard', 'enough', 'capture', 'entertainment', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'present', 'story', 'only', 'perspective', 'warped', 'mind', 'concoctions', 'film', 'needed', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'character', 'viewpoint', 'give', 'audience', 'validation', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'perceptions', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'leaving', 'audience', 'hostage', 'constant', 'question', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'characters', 'introduced', 'exception', 'two', 'were', 'products', 'main', 'character', 'mind', 'one', 'was', 'peripheral', 'character', 'was', 'screen', '5', 'mins', 'other', 'was', 'served', 'story', 'villain', 'only', 'glimpsed', 'eyes', 'sick', 'character', 'end', 'designed', 'make', 'think', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'especially', 'least', 'one', 'additional', 'vantage']",N/A
