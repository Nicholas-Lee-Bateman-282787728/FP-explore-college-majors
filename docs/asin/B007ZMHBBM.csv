1539980,A2GJXG6JMHBD60,B007ZMHBBM,Boomerocity,"[2, 2]","On a cold Chicago winter night, November 22, 1981, the Rolling Stones were in the midst of their huge Tattoo You tour and had a night off.  Hearing that the legendary Muddy Waters was playing a gig at Buddy Guy's Checkerboard Lounge, they decided to catch one of their blues idols act.  Before the night was over, Muddy had summoned Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Ian Stewart to the stage for a night of jamming to some blues classics.Fortunately for those of us who were not fortunate enough to catch that historical performance, it was caught on camera and is now made available to us on DVD and CD to watch and listen to as we wish - and we'll all wish to watch and listen to it a lot.The package includes 16 tracks on the DVD, eleven of which are featured on the CD.  Featured on both are classics like Baby Please Don't Go (a Boomerocity favorite),  Hoochie Coochie Man, and Clouds in My Heart.  The entire collection is blues - historic blues - as it should be played.  The icing on the cake is hearing it played by the likes of Muddy, Keith, Ronnie, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy.  Add Sir Mick to the mix on vocals and, Wow! History is taking place right before your very eyes and ears.This collection is a must-have for any serious music fan or musicologist since a line of this magnitude is rarely caught on film for posterity.

He tried to upstage him, and by putting on the fake souther accent he tries to sing with, shaking his hair around like he is filming an add for head and shoulders shampoo- I felt sad for Muddy Waters. Someone like Springsteen or Dylan would have been completely respectful of their boyhood idols, but Mick Jagger is always worried about how he looks himself, like a concieted girl. He is more like  Madonna than he is Dylan or Springsteen. It made me feel that Mick Jagger was thinking this as he shared the stage: ""This here bloke might be the authentic, real thing, and I may have gotten about a billion times richer and more famous than he is by ripping him off like I did, but hey, I am better looking than he is, and thats all that counts. He must feel lucky that I came here to share my fabulous fame with him.

I wasn't expecting the sound to be as good as it was, but in both the DVD and the CD it was absolutely clear as could be.  Seeing Muddy play guitar was a special treat for me, as I've never seen him play.  I've always been a casual fan of his -mostly seeing him guest in other's films without his guitar -The Last Waltz comes to mind.  When I first received this, I played the CD first in my car, and was impressed with the fidelity of the recording, an of course the performances were terrific.  After listening to the CD for a few months on and off, I finally took the time to play the DVD and discovered how much I was missing!  Besides the extra tracks, I was finally able to see which musician played which parts, as there are several guests coming and going throughout the show.  The guitar solos from Buddy Guy and Keith Richards were particularly great, but the occasional lead from Ronny Wood and then Lefty Dizz were also wonderful.  Muddy's brief guitar blasts were a revelation to me.  Like a hurricane coming through.  Awesome.  As a fan of electric blues, I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  As for the video quality, it's 1981 in a small Chicago club, so with that caveat, I think it was shot about as well as it could have been.  There's 3 cameras, and I never felt like a moment was missed.  Considering the constraints of space and lighting and video tape, it was very well done.

Upon recently viewing it again I must say, Muddy with the Stones together is not only a great combination of talent, but is also a stunning portrayal of what the blues is all about.

It is all here.When Muddy sings in &#34;Mannish Boy,&#34; &#34;I'm a rolling stone...&#34; you can tell that Mick is truly beside himself.  The Stones were greatly influenced by Muddy and other blues greats, and at this performance you can tell that they are overjoyed to be sharing the stage with him.I really like the intimate feel of the small club they performed at.  At this point in the Stones' career they were mostly playing stadiums and large arenas.  Here they could have shook hands with the audience, that's how close they were.  Also the looseness and freeness of the show is very neat -- for example, when Muddy calls up each member  of the Stones individually.

1539996,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B007ZMHBBM,M. Oleson,"[9, 12]","It's my understanding that this classic collaboration has been on the bootleg circuit for some time.  This is an authorized release by Eagle Vision.  The Checkerboard was a Southside juke joint owned by Chicago blues legend Buddy Guy (who also makes an appearance in a white suit and giant Afro).  The headliner was Mississippi blues god, Muddy Waters and his band.After a couple songs led by piano man Lovie Lee, Waters takes charge and whips through some electric blues that he helped launch.  The grainy home movie style camera work shows a mostly empty long table in front of the tiny club and postage stamp sized stage.  During the 6th song, ""Baby Please Don't Go,"" the table begins to fill with 4 of the Stones, their girlfriends and assorted hangers-on.  First Mick, then Keith Richards, then Ron Wood and finally Ian Stewart all join in the jam.  Jagger hangs in for several tunes (yes he knows all the words), the highlight of which is Waters classic ""Mannish Boy.""  Fueled by cigarettes and Bourbon, Richards and Wood hang in for the long haul.  Waters takes a seat and the Stones table and others take over including Guy, Junior Wells and a stoned out of his gourd, Lefty Dizz.  I'm not familiar with Lefty but as zonked as he was, the man can play.  And from what I can tell, he plays a right handed guitar...left handed!It might have been nice to have some crowd reaction shots when the Stones appeared, but alas no.  No big deal.  The film is in a squarish TV-style 4:3 aspect ratio on DVD and comes with audio options in Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Digital Surround 5.1.  There are 3 bonus songs including one from the Stones at their appointed gig at the Hampton Coliseum.  If you're a blues lover, you have to have this classic one time show.  Here's a track listing:1) Sweet Little Angel 2) Flip Flop And Fly 3) Muddy Waters Introduction 4) You Don t Have To Go 5) Country Boy 6) Baby Please Don't Go 7) Hoochie Coochie Man 8) Long Distance Call 9) Mannish Boy 10) Got My Mojo Working 11) Next Time You See Me 12) One Eyed Woman 13) Baby Please Don't Go (Instrumental) 14) Blow Wind Blow 15) Champagne & Reefer.",4,4 1/2 stars for this classic blues collaboration,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2149,"['understanding', 'classic', 'collaboration', 'been', 'bootleg', 'circuit', 'time', 'authorized', 'release', 'Eagle', 'Vision', 'Checkerboard', 'was', 'Southside', 'juke', 'joint', 'owned', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'legend', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'who', 'also', 'appearance', 'white', 'suit', 'giant', 'Afro', 'headliner', 'was', 'Mississippi', 'blues', 'god', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'band.After', 'couple', 'songs', 'led', 'piano', 'man', 'Lovie', 'Lee', 'Waters', 'charge', 'whips', 'electric', 'blues', 'helped', 'launch', 'grainy', 'home', 'movie', 'style', 'camera', 'work', 'mostly', 'empty', 'long', 'table', 'front', 'tiny', 'club', 'postage', 'stamp', 'sized', 'stage', '6th', 'song', 'Baby', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'table', 'fill', '4', 'Stones', 'girlfriends', 'assorted', 'hangers-on', 'First', 'Mick', 'then', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'then', 'Ron', 'Wood', 'finally', 'Ian', 'Stewart', 'join', 'jam', 'Jagger', 'hangs', 'several', 'tunes', 'yes', 'words', 'highlight', 'Waters', 'classic', 'Mannish', 'Boy', 'Fueled', 'cigarettes', 'Bourbon', 'Richards', 'Wood', 'hang', 'long', 'haul', 'Waters', 'seat', 'Stones', 'table', 'others', 'take', 'over', 'including', 'Guy', 'Junior', 'Wells', 'stoned', 'gourd', 'Lefty', 'Dizz', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Lefty', 'as', 'zonked', 'was', 'man', 'can', 'play', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'handed', 'guitar', 'left', 'handed', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'crowd', 'reaction', 'shots', 'when', 'Stones', 'appeared', 'big', 'deal', 'film', 'squarish', 'TV-style', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVD', 'audio', 'options', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Stereo', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'DTS', 'Digital', 'Surround', '5.1', 'are', '3', 'bonus', 'songs', 'including', 'one', 'Stones', 'appointed', 'gig', 'Hampton', 'Coliseum', ""'re"", 'blues', 'lover', 'have', 'have', 'classic', 'one', 'time', 'show', 'Here', 'track', 'listing:1', 'Sweet', 'Little', 'Angel', '2', 'Flip', 'Flop', 'Fly', '3', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Introduction', '4', 'Don', 't', 'Have', 'Go', '5', 'Country', 'Boy', '6', 'Baby', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', '7', 'Hoochie', 'Coochie', 'Man', '8', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Call', '9', 'Mannish', 'Boy', '10', 'Got', 'My', 'Mojo', 'Working', '11', 'Next', 'Time', 'See', 'Me', '12', 'One', 'Eyed', 'Woman', '13', 'Baby', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Instrumental', '14', 'Blow', 'Wind', 'Blow', '15', 'Champagne', 'Reefer']",Live at the Checkerboard Loung

1540002,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B007ZMHBBM,Steven A. Peterson,"[2, 2]","This is a wonderful DVD (plus a CD) of a concert at Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago (Buddy Guy's club). The DVD begins with a couple blues songs--""Sweet Little Angel"" and ""Flip Flop and Fly."" Nice playing, but I was wondering--""Where is Muddy Waters."" Then, Muddy heads to the stage and we see him perform with his band. Wonderful blues playing, with ""You Don't Have to Go"" and ""Country Boy."" The club provides a claustrophobic feel--small room where people sit almost on top of one another. People are lined up at the entrance, and are admitted as others leave.The show really gets rolling during ""Baby Please Don't Go,"" as we see four Stones enter--Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, and Ian Stewart. When Waters sees them, he invites them to stage. In a way, this is eminently appropriate, since the Rolling Stones took their name from one of Waters' songs and since the Rolling Stones had extolled the virtues of Muddy Waters as an influence on their work (and sometimes had his songs in their play list). One of the touching aspects of this DVD is what appears to be genuine affection and warmth between the old blues warrior and his musical progeny, an unlikely band of Englishmen.We see  Richards and Wood playing with Waters' band on a number of songs; Waters invites Stewart to play the piano. Jagger and Waters play off of one another on the vocals. Making the video more enjoyable--more guests, including legends like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells who join in the music. The small stage features players leaving to make room for new players. The improvisational qualkity of the concert is most pleasurable.And the songs? It's hard to beat ""Mannish Boy,"" ""Hoochie Coochie Man,""  ""Got My Mojo Working,"" Champagne and Reefer,"" and so on. One feature that I especially enjoyed was the various guitar players playing off of one another--Wood, Richards, Lefty Dizz, Guy, and Waters himself at some points, among others.The quality of the DVD is pretty good, given that it was captured in 1981.All in all, a terrific and energetic concert. It was telling to see the obvious influence that blues legends like Muddy Waters had on the Rolling Stones. And how naturally they played the blues.

But this first ""official"" release (with wonderful brand new sound restoration) is the first time I've seen it. It's truly a historical moment and Eagle Vision has given it a nice packaging and a very reasonable price. (The DVD itself is under $15.00 and the combo pack with the audio CD with 11 of the 13 numbers is only five bucks more.The whole show lasts 106 minutes though, in reality, there are two numbers up front by Waters band, without the Hootchie Cootchie Man himself. And while Jagger, Richards and Wood are on stage with Waters for quite a few songs, both Waters and Jagger leave the stage for two songs by guitarist/vocalist Lefty Dizz, though Wood and Richards remain on stage. Oh, I forgot the Junior Wells gets to squeeze on the small stage as well.Waters sings his classics and plays on some of them (he puts away the guitar for a few numbers).The camera work is super with nice close ups and you can really enjoy Waters and Jagger riffing with each other.The DVD adds two bonus performances and an 8 page booklet with some photos and an essay by Robert Gordon that - in text - pretty much describes what you see on your screen.Definitely a must-have for both Blues fans and Stones fans.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Documenting a rare meeting of the King of the blues guitar and the ""best rock and roll band"" - all at a great price",1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,1567,"['Apparently', 'have', 'been', 'bootleg', 'tapes', '1981', 'performance', 'when', 'legendary', 'blues', 'guitarist', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'was', 'booked', 'Buy', 'Guy', 'Chicago', 'juke', 'joint', 'small', 'club', 'tables', 'right', 'small', 'stage', 'Mick', 'Keith', 'Ron', 'showed', 'up', 'front', 'row', 'seats', 'first', 'official', 'release', 'wonderful', 'brand', 'new', 'sound', 'restoration', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'truly', 'historical', 'moment', 'Eagle', 'Vision', 'given', 'nice', 'packaging', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'DVD', '15.00', 'combo', 'pack', 'audio', 'CD', '11', '13', 'numbers', 'only', 'five', 'bucks', 'more.The', 'whole', 'show', '106', 'minutes', 'reality', 'are', 'two', 'numbers', 'up', 'front', 'Waters', 'band', 'Hootchie', 'Cootchie', 'Man', 'Jagger', 'Richards', 'Wood', 'are', 'stage', 'Waters', 'quite', 'few', 'songs', 'Waters', 'Jagger', 'leave', 'stage', 'two', 'songs', 'guitarist/vocalist', 'Lefty', 'Dizz', 'Wood', 'Richards', 'remain', 'stage', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'Junior', 'Wells', 'squeeze', 'small', 'stage', 'well.Waters', 'sings', 'classics', 'plays', 'away', 'guitar', 'few', 'numbers', '.The', 'camera', 'work', 'super', 'nice', 'close', 'ups', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Waters', 'Jagger', 'riffing', 'other.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'bonus', 'performances', '8', 'page', 'booklet', 'photos', 'essay', 'Robert', 'Gordon', 'text', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'screen.Definitely', 'must-have', 'Blues', 'fans', 'Stones', 'fans.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Live at the Checkerboard Loung
1540004,A3H7DVRC2QLH6S,B007ZMHBBM,"T. McCool ""Musicologist""","[69, 71]","This has been circulating among bootleg collectors for years, and finally we get a ""first gen"" copy of the complete show with remastered sound. Having seen this before there aren't any surprises. There are a few caveats. Sometimes the video quality is not the best, and sometimes it's spectacular. The performances are very loose and at times chaotic, as musicians jump on and off the low stage with tables right up to the edge. And other times the music is as tight and brilliant as the blues can be. When the Stones show up and begin jamming, the band picks it up a notch, especially the rhythm section that does a fantastic job keeping this from becoming completely out of control. Muddy is not in good health at this time in  his life (he passes away two years after this show), and he spends most of the show sitting on a stool on stage. But when the band rips into Mannish Boy, Muddy can't keep his seat. He's up and jumping like he's a  young man again, and we see a glimpse of the power and majesty that the man possessed. During part of the show, Mick and Muddy take a seat to allow Jr. Wells (not bad, he should play the harmonica more), Buddy Guy (always a treat), and a drunken Lefty Dizz take turns at center stage. Yes, Dizz is drunk, and ends his feature song standing at the edge of the stage, flailing his arms around, saying or singing something to the audience without a microphone. You can't hear what he's saying but the band and the audience's reactions range from amusement to horror. Wells has to take the stage and literally push Dizz off stage. But it's great that whole sequence is included to give you the complete feel of the evening. No, it doesn't really cast a pall on the rest of the show by any means. It's just comic relief. The very best part of the whole video is the guitar playing and solos from Wood, Richards, Waters, Guy, and the guitarists in Muddy's band ain't shabby either. It really looks like it was a fun evening and one that the members of the audience probably are still talking about to this day. I am not a big fan of concert videos, but this one is fun to watch.The bonus features are cuts from the Hampton 1981 PPV and are nice to have, but again this has been circulating for years. The DVD does not include the whole show, and the songs are edited to take out the dead spots when musicians are going on stage and strapping on a guitar in the middle of the song.

Muddy Waters was up front and center perched on his chair belting out the blues with his band when in walks The Stones in town to perform their own gig. The boys saunter into the club, pull up a few chairs and settle in while Waters is warming up the crowd.The Stones idolized Muddy Waters back in the 1960's when Muddy was touring spreading the blues gospel to the rest of the world. The connection was made back then between the blues and rock and roll as we have it today. The blues seed was planted and the Stones nurtured this style of music into their own style of music.It doesn't take long before Muddy is coaxing Mick up to the stage to join in and next thing you know he has them all up jammin' as if their lives depended on it.Other Blues Greats make their own way to the stage cramming it to over capacity to the delight of all those lucky dogs who were present. Lefty Dizz, Buddy Guy, and  Junior Wells to name a few.It seemed like everybody in the house was on something that night, a high octane groove was in the air and the banter and swagger back and forth between the performers was electrifying.It was a hoot watching Mick strutting his stuff, wagging his caboose and howling to match one of his peers. His  band mates coolly just played off to the side, chain smoking and rising forth when prompted to do so.A few drinks later, a few fine performances past, the whole joint breaks loose.

Watch the DVD I just couldn't stop thinking how those people who paid their minor door fee back in the 80's to see Muddy Waters suddenly found themselves treated to the Stones too.  Talk about the most bang for the buck.  This is all very cool,5,Great Remix,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,378,"['Very', 'good', 'DVD', 'CD', 'set', 'Everything', 'crisp', 'new', 'instead', 'dated', 'original', 'bootleg', 'tapes', 'apparently', 'did', 'Watch', 'DVD', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'paid', 'minor', 'door', 'fee', 'back', '80', 'see', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'suddenly', 'found', 'treated', 'Stones', 'too', 'Talk', 'most', 'bang', 'buck', 'very', 'cool']",Live at the Checkerboard Loung
1540008,APLLDBMLYWJ8A,B007ZMHBBM,W. Wilson,"[0, 0]","Muddy Waters was one of the finest Chicago Blues Players ever to lay fingers to strings.  He inspired countless musicians and bands to seek a career in Blues or blues-related fields, including the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Eric Clapton and countless others.  In his later years he ended up opening for many of these bands...a travesty as the bands knew who was the teacher and who was the student.  Many made the statement that the situation should be reversed with them opening for Muddy.  Live at the Checkerboard Lounge featured Muddy in good form, doing what he did best.  The Rolling Stones went to the show, got invited to sit in and the rest is history.  Any video featuring Muddy Waters is worth buying, without exception.  This one is prime, indeed!",5,Muddy & the Stones,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,761,"['Muddy', 'Waters', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'Chicago', 'Blues', 'Players', 'ever', 'lay', 'fingers', 'strings', 'inspired', 'countless', 'musicians', 'bands', 'seek', 'career', 'Blues', 'blues-related', 'fields', 'including', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Beatles', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'countless', 'others', 'later', 'years', 'ended', 'up', 'opening', 'many', 'bands', 'travesty', 'bands', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'teacher', 'who', 'was', 'student', 'Many', 'made', 'statement', 'situation', 'should', 'be', 'reversed', 'opening', 'Muddy', 'Live', 'Checkerboard', 'Lounge', 'featured', 'Muddy', 'good', 'form', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'best', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'went', 'show', 'got', 'invited', 'sit', 'rest', 'history', 'video', 'featuring', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'worth', 'buying', 'exception', 'one', 'prime', 'indeed']",Live at the Checkerboard Loung
