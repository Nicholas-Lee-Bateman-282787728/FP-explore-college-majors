I would put it in the thriller/horror category and possibly drama or maybe adventure. They (Drew's character and her dad) both have extraordinary powers, but I watched it more for the father-daughter theme. Unfortunately, her father dies and she decides to continue with her life like she should, so I can relate to this story. Overall, it's a great film, but I'm not sure if it's family-oriented 'cause there's a lot of fire, there's a small snake in the film, and there are some scenes with utter darkness while she's with a man, which scares me.",5,Great Father-Daughter Theme,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,609,"['Thanks', 'wonderful', 'father', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'film', 'would', 'put', 'thriller/horror', 'category', 'possibly', 'drama', 'maybe', 'adventure', 'Drew', 'character', 'dad', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'powers', 'watched', 'more', 'father-daughter', 'theme', 'Unfortunately', 'father', 'dies', 'continue', 'life', 'should', 'can', 'relate', 'story', 'Overall', 'great', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'family-oriented', 'lot', 'fire', 'small', 'snake', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'utter', 'darkness', 'man']",Firestarter VHS

203042,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300183459,Erik North,"[2, 2]","Though not exactly a masterpiece, FIRESTARTER is a far better thriller than the critics led people to believe when it was first released in 1984.Based on Stephen King's 1980 novel, this film stars Drew Barrymore (fresh off her role in Spielberg's 1982 masterpiece E.T.) as Charlie McGee, a very young girl whose parents (David Keith, Heather Locklear) were part of a government-sponsored scientific experiment that gave the participants various types of psi powers.  Barrymore's power is unique and, to put it mildly, incendiary.  Just by thinking about it, she can start fires--pyrokinesis.  And she is most apt to do that when she is under stress or angry.Given the fact that agents from a secret government agency known as the Shop have been after her, one can see why she'd use them, even though she doesn't want to.  But the top two men (Martin Sheen, George C. Scott) in the Shop want her powers to be harnessed into the ultimate weapon.  The thing they forget, of course, is that they should be careful what they wish for; they may get it.  And in the explosive, fiery finale, they do indeed get it.Though not quite up to the cinematic standards set by CARRIE or THE SHINING, FIRESTARTER does benefit from a very good performance by Barrymore, and Keith isn't too bad either.  Sheen (who played a political heavy in another King adaptation, THE DEAD ZONE) and Scott (the 1970 Oscar winner for PATTON) make for two very good villains.  The special effects work by Mike Wood and Jeff Jarvis, who worked on both E.T. and POLTERGEIST, though not totally unflawed, also works wonders.  Like another reviewer, I think FIRESTARTER could easily have passed for a 'PG-13' rating, instead of an 'R'.  Unfortunately, such a rating didn't exist yet when the film came out in the winter of 1984.Combining science fiction with suspense and the supernatural, FIRESTARTER is an effective thriller, well worth watching, even if Stephen King is not your particular cinematic bag.",4,Fire On High,1012953600,"02 6, 2002",2002,1968,"['not', 'exactly', 'masterpiece', 'FIRESTARTER', 'far', 'better', 'thriller', 'critics', 'led', 'people', 'believe', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1984.Based', 'Stephen', 'King', '1980', 'novel', 'film', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'fresh', 'role', 'Spielberg', '1982', 'masterpiece', 'E.T', 'Charlie', 'McGee', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'parents', 'David', 'Keith', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'were', 'part', 'government-sponsored', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'gave', 'participants', 'various', 'types', 'psi', 'powers', 'Barrymore', 'power', 'unique', 'put', 'mildly', 'incendiary', 'Just', 'thinking', 'can', 'start', 'fires', 'pyrokinesis', 'most', 'apt', 'do', 'when', 'stress', 'angry.Given', 'fact', 'agents', 'secret', 'government', 'agency', 'known', 'Shop', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', ""'d"", 'use', 'even', ""n't"", 'want', 'top', 'two', 'men', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Shop', 'want', 'powers', 'be', 'harnessed', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'thing', 'forget', 'course', 'should', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'may', 'get', 'explosive', 'fiery', 'finale', 'do', 'indeed', 'get', 'not', 'quite', 'cinematic', 'standards', 'set', 'CARRIE', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'FIRESTARTER', 'benefit', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Barrymore', 'Keith', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'either', 'Sheen', 'who', 'played', 'political', 'heavy', 'King', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'ZONE', 'Scott', '1970', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'PATTON', 'make', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'villains', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'Mike', 'Wood', 'Jeff', 'Jarvis', 'who', 'worked', 'E.T', 'POLTERGEIST', 'not', 'totally', 'unflawed', 'also', 'wonders', 'reviewer', 'think', 'FIRESTARTER', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'passed', ""'PG-13"", ""'"", 'rating', 'instead', 'R', 'Unfortunately', 'rating', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'yet', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'winter', '1984.Combining', 'science', 'fiction', 'suspense', 'supernatural', 'FIRESTARTER', 'effective', 'thriller', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'Stephen', 'King', 'not', 'particular', 'cinematic', 'bag']",Firestarter VHS

Despite her Hollywood lineage, Drew Barrymore just doesn't strike me as a very poignant actress.  E.T. and Charlie's Angels were her best flicks.  Throughout the movie, Drew seems to slur her speech.  She could have been high while performing since she did get hooked on drugs at a very early age.  In my opinion, someone else should have been chosen to play Charlie McGee.Even though this movie was made in the 80s, it still could have done better visual effects-wise. Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, E.T. and Poltergeist came out the same period and were putting out some great supernatural feature films.  Firestarter is substandard compared to its blockbuster counterparts. Doesn't seem as if much of a budget was committed...nor a script for that matter.Nonetheless, the director did what he could while David Keith, George C. Scott and Martin Sheen carried the drama of the film.  For the most part, the story turned out pretty decent.This would fall right to the bottom of the Supernatural Movies pile, but it's still worth watching for entertainment value.  On the otherhand, the sequel, Firestarter 2, is just plain horrid depsite the snappier special effects.  Leave that one alone.

203049,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,6300183459,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[3, 4]","This movie was a decent though not perfect adaptation of the book.  One problem was it tried to be heavy on star power.  The cast includes Drew Barrymore, David Keith, Heather Locklear, Martin Sheen (in a role that Burt Lancaster was to play), George C. Scott, Art Carney, and Louise Fletcher.  For the most part, this was not a problem, but can I picture George C. Scott playing a one eyed native American?  Wasn't there a good native American to play that role?The story is more a true science fiction story than a horror story.  The government has secret experiments toying with paranormal activity.  Two of the guinea pigs fall in love, get married, and . . . no, they don't live happily ever after.  They have a daughter, and the government thugs kill the mother and try to kidnap the daughter, until the father intervenes.

They want to use them as ultimate bio-weapons, Andrew was originally a test subject who had the amazing ability to bend minds and objects with his mind as one day he meets a beautiful woman named Vickey (Heather Locklear) as they got married and had Charlie together. Charlie has the amazing ability to make fire with her mind including fireballs, now the government wants to use her as the ultimate unstoppable weapon as she must fight back to save herself and her father.A nice suspenseful Sci-fi horror thriller loosley based on Stephen King's novel! The film co-stars Martin Sheen, Art Carney, George C. Scott and Freddie Jones, there is lots of excellent pre-CGI special effects of it's day and some nice performances even by Barrymore as the young pyrokentic girl. The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is very cool that adds to the dark yet atmospheric mood of the picture, not one of the best Stephen King movies but worth viewing.This DVD contains good picture quality with good sound but the only extra is a trailer to the film.Also recommended: ""Akira"", ""Scanners"", ""Carrie"", ""Making Contact (a.k.a.

Most people hate this film including Stephen King himself.  While I do not hate the film as much as most people I do think it is one of the weaker Stephen King movie adaptions that I have seen.  It has some good stuff in it, but an equal amount of bad things to offset it.The film starts off nicely.  You have Andrew (David Keith) and his daughter Charlie (Drew Barrymore) on the run from this top secret government group called The Shop.  The Shop is headed by Captain Hollister (Martin Sheen) and John Rainbird (George C. Scott) Andrew underwent an experiment done by the Shop where he took a special drug which gives you psychic powers of some kind.  In Andrew's case he can force people to do what he wants.  His daughter Charlie obtained a gift of her own through the genes called Pyro-Kinesis which allows her to produce fire with a thought.The first half hour of those two on the run I actually enjoyed.  The final act was also engaging.  She learns to control her abilities, escapes the facility and kills all the agents in the process.However, the middle portion of the film is where things fall apart for me.  After a certain point, Andrew and Charlie are apprehended by The Shop.  After that you have nearly forty minutes of them trying to befriend Charlie in order to get her to use her ability for them.  They also experiment on Andrew and give him medication.  It is literally forty minutes of them being experimented on.  I found it incredible boring and unneeded.  Most of it just seemed like time filler.Many of the performances did nothing for me as well.  Some of the cast does alright.  David Keith and Martin Sheen do a good job most of the time, though Martin Sheen can be very over-the-top in places.  Drew Barrymore was not good at all.  She did grow as an actor thankfully.  I've seen some other films of hers and she is a fine actress.  However, she did not do a good job here.  George C. Scott I did not think did that well either.The film has many good things in it.  The beginning and the end were fun to watch.  The score is good especially the music played at the end.  The effects are a bit dated, but are fine overall.  However the acting is not that good.  Plus the middle is pretty dull.  I have not read the entire book, so I cannot comment if it was faithful to the source material or not.  From what I have read, they did not change too much, but I have not read that much of it.Overall, Firestarter is one of the weaker Stephen King adaptions that I've seen.  I would skip it.

203058,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6300183459,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","Thankfully there are actually Stephen King adaptations out there that still manage to turn out half-way decent, and this movie is one of them -- great sound effects (the drumming when the father attempts mind control), the creepy dream flashbacks (his voice in slow motion while they're receiving the experiment), a high body count, some shocking scenes (a man hemorrhaging from his eyes), great cast, class A directing, and an emotionally wrenching subplot. I have noticed some find this boring -- it is more slow-paced in the first half as we work through all this build up, but boring? Never.Like in Carrie, when Telekinesis was explored, King now ventures into another rare area: pyrokinessis. The ability to start fires from sheer will of the mind -- little Charlie (Drew Barrymore) and her father Andy harbor a horrifying history and a secret worth killing for.Charlie's parents, pre-birth, meet where they're both in a room about to receive the dosage of an experimental drug (Lot 9) given by an organization called ""The Shop."" But the experiment goes horribly awry -- except for one thing. It has given Andy the ability to control people by catching them with their eyes (think Vampire) and this power, while physically harmful to him, is interesting to the owners of this secret organization. But due to how destructive this power is, and how much it weakens him, it's not of much use to The Shop, until their interest is piqued big-time when the two have a child, a little girl, whose stuffed toys automatically go up in flames when she gets pissed.The newlywed's dreams have come true, but so have The Shop's, who see in her the perfect killing machine/scientific discovery. And the group is determined to have her...at all costs. I won't give away any more details on what happens, but it's a lot, and it's pretty believable. If this condition and organization existed this is exactly how these people would respond and behave. A very character-orientated picture.The cast and acting is superb and you feel every heartache, every betrayal. Martin Sheen is the owner of this organization. Martin Sheen plays Captain Hollister but I won't ruin who and what his character is. He's basically the same role here as he was in the Dead Zone. When Charlie's mother is shown it's a pre-fame, very young Heather Locklear. She doesn't have that Melrose Place snobbery around her yet, does an excellent job. Drew Barrymore had talent from the beginning and she's better in this than ET, more emotions are shown and you feel for her the entire way through. Her father Andy (David Keith) is perfectly cast and has a certain screen magic.A lot of people die and the majority are burned to death through Charlie's ability. But if I'm giving off the impression she's evil in any way, I don't mean to. The exact opposite. A pretty sweet kid, believe it or not, and this helps drive the knife in even deeper for an emotional effect.I mentioned the directing very briefly above but I need to mention it again. Excellent shots of Charlie when she's about to start a fire (her hair blows behind her head, not as silly as it sounds), great effects with bullets that are shot her way, FIREBALLS!!, just all around great stuff. There's really a lot of drama and story throughout involving the girl's family and constantly being on the run, and it's told through more than her point of view, but also the father's and the villains.Not much fright factor unfortunately...the movie isn't creepy but it is interesting. It doesn't pass out buckets of blood either but it's not completely dry.A sadly overlooked film that has a quiet intrigue about it, underrated and talented. It may need a little patience from the more hyper audience members, but if ignored and left behind, it's only the viewer who ends up getting ""burned.""",4,Excellent,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3809,"['Thankfully', 'are', 'actually', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptations', 'out', 'there', 'still', 'manage', 'turn', 'out', 'half-way', 'decent', 'movie', 'one', 'great', 'sound', 'effects', 'drumming', 'when', 'father', 'mind', 'control', 'creepy', 'dream', 'flashbacks', 'voice', 'slow', 'motion', ""'re"", 'receiving', 'experiment', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'man', 'hemorrhaging', 'eyes', 'great', 'cast', 'class', 'A', 'directing', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'subplot', 'have', 'noticed', 'find', 'boring', 'more', 'slow-paced', 'first', 'half', 'work', 'up', 'boring', 'Never.Like', 'Carrie', 'when', 'Telekinesis', 'was', 'explored', 'King', 'now', 'ventures', 'rare', 'area', 'pyrokinessis', 'ability', 'start', 'fires', 'sheer', 'will', 'mind', 'little', 'Charlie', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'father', 'Andy', 'horrifying', 'history', 'secret', 'worth', 'killing', 'for.Charlie', 'parents', 'pre-birth', 'meet', 'where', ""'re"", 'room', 'receive', 'dosage', 'experimental', 'drug', 'Lot', '9', 'given', 'organization', 'called', 'Shop', 'experiment', 'horribly', 'awry', 'one', 'thing', 'given', 'Andy', 'ability', 'control', 'people', 'catching', 'eyes', 'think', 'Vampire', 'power', 'physically', 'harmful', 'interesting', 'owners', 'secret', 'organization', 'due', 'how', 'destructive', 'power', 'how', 'much', 'not', 'much', 'use', 'Shop', 'interest', 'piqued', 'big-time', 'when', 'two', 'have', 'child', 'little', 'girl', 'stuffed', 'automatically', 'go', 'up', 'flames', 'when', 'pissed.The', 'newlywed', 'dreams', 'have', 'come', 'true', 'so', 'have', 'Shop', 'who', 'see', 'perfect', 'killing', 'machine/scientific', 'discovery', 'group', 'determined', 'have', 'costs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'details', 'what', 'lot', 'pretty', 'believable', 'condition', 'organization', 'existed', 'exactly', 'how', 'people', 'would', 'respond', 'behave', 'very', 'character-orientated', 'picture.The', 'cast', 'acting', 'superb', 'feel', 'heartache', 'betrayal', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'owner', 'organization', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Captain', 'Hollister', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'who', 'what', 'character', 'basically', 'same', 'role', 'here', 'was', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'When', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'shown', 'pre-fame', 'very', 'young', 'Heather', 'Locklear', ""n't"", 'have', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'snobbery', 'yet', 'excellent', 'job', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'had', 'talent', 'beginning', 'better', 'ET', 'more', 'emotions', 'are', 'shown', 'feel', 'entire', 'way', 'father', 'Andy', 'David', 'Keith', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'certain', 'screen', 'magic.A', 'lot', 'people', 'die', 'majority', 'are', 'burned', 'death', 'Charlie', 'ability', ""'m"", 'giving', 'off', 'impression', 'evil', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'exact', 'opposite', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'kid', 'believe', 'not', 'drive', 'knife', 'even', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'effect.I', 'mentioned', 'directing', 'very', 'briefly', 'need', 'mention', 'again', 'Excellent', 'shots', 'Charlie', 'when', 'about', 'start', 'fire', 'hair', 'head', 'not', 'as', 'silly', 'great', 'effects', 'bullets', 'are', 'shot', 'way', 'FIREBALLS', 'just', 'around', 'great', 'stuff', 'really', 'lot', 'drama', 'story', 'involving', 'girl', 'family', 'constantly', 'being', 'run', 'told', 'more', 'point', 'view', 'also', 'father', 'villains.Not', 'much', 'fright', 'factor', 'unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'pass', 'out', 'buckets', 'blood', 'not', 'completely', 'dry.A', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'film', 'quiet', 'intrigue', 'underrated', 'talented', 'may', 'need', 'little', 'patience', 'more', 'hyper', 'audience', 'members', 'ignored', 'left', 'behind', 'only', 'viewer', 'who', 'up', 'getting', 'burned']",Firestarter VHS

The best part of the movie is the very end where Charlie takes her revenge on all the government scumbags that kidnapped her father and herself, and they even killed her father with an intention of wanted to coerce Charlie to use her unfortunate pyro-telekinesis for government power and gain against her will.If you enjoyed this film, check out Drew Barrymore's trilogy film called ""Cat's Eye"" which is a great ""tongue in cheek"" Stephen King film of three great short stories.",5,"""If I do something bad, would you still love me?""",1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,750,"['Playing', 'Charlie', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'ever', 'played', 'How', 'often', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'be', 'main', 'star', 'Rated', 'R', 'film', 'movie', 'can', 'drag', 'time', 'time', 'out', 'very', 'realistically', 'sinister', 'side', 'American', 'government', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'Charlie', 'revenge', 'government', 'kidnapped', 'father', 'even', 'killed', 'father', 'intention', 'wanted', 'coerce', 'Charlie', 'use', 'unfortunate', 'pyro-telekinesis', 'government', 'power', 'gain', 'will.If', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'trilogy', 'film', 'called', 'Cat', 'Eye', 'great', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'Stephen', 'King', 'film', 'three', 'great', 'short', 'stories']",Firestarter VHS

This was the first Stephen King film to be made out of the Wilmington, North Carolina studio and started something wonderful.It's fun to see Drew Barrymore as a child again.  She was fascinated with all the rings I wore back then.  David Keith was very gracious and Martin Sheen was just a good guy all the way around. Not George C. Scott.  He had nothing to do with anyone.  Guess it takes all of his thoughts, all of the time to play a part.The producers,directors and whole crew were so professional and helpful.  It was amazing to watch them put this 'Firey' story together and the special effects won awards and got a lot of notice in the industry back in the eighties.Just fun to watch how special effects were done about 30 years ago.",5,It's A Personal Thing,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,826,"['actually', 'had', 'little', 'script', 'part', 'movie', 'got', 'know', 'most', 'cast', 'was', 'first', 'Stephen', 'King', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'Wilmington', 'North', 'Carolina', 'studio', 'started', 'something', 'wonderful.It', 'fun', 'see', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'child', 'again', 'was', 'fascinated', 'rings', 'wore', 'back', 'then', 'David', 'Keith', 'was', 'very', 'gracious', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'guy', 'way', 'around', 'Not', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anyone', 'Guess', 'thoughts', 'time', 'play', 'part.The', 'producers', 'directors', 'whole', 'crew', 'were', 'so', 'professional', 'helpful', 'was', 'amazing', 'watch', 'put', ""'Firey"", 'story', 'together', 'special', 'effects', 'won', 'awards', 'got', 'lot', 'notice', 'industry', 'back', 'eighties.Just', 'fun', 'watch', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', '30', 'years', 'ago']",Firestarter VHS

Bad slasher films seemed to reign supreme and the idea of Horror = low budget was in everyones mind.  However this title pulls all the stops and provides a highly entertaining, and suspensful thriller that only the mind of Stephen King could write.This movie stars a very young Drew Barrymore in probably one of her top 5 best roles, and she was just a younun in this.  Her character is just overwhelmed with emotions and the development to include the frightening finally proves that this young kid (at the time) could act.That's not to say the supporting cast was lousy, in fact it was also the backup power of Martin Sheen and George C Scott that made the movie even better.  Martin Sheen portrayed the diabolical Military Comandre and George C Scott as the cold and calculating John, the basic hired guns.  The first 30 minutes are Drew and her father trying to escape and the last hour is about the tests they perform and teh eventual carnage taht results.I recomend this to anyone out there.
