A really great value considering if you were to buy these separately it would cost you upwards of $50.

1355584,A1NJLH4H82S1CV,B003NKU9XM,"I. Stanley ""MotleyHoople""","[18, 20]","Tales from the crypt was a great series. The episodes were always fun to watch and frequently featured cool guest stars. Some episodes leaned more to the comical side, whle others were genuinely creepy. But there was always just enough self induced cheesyness from the Crypt Keeper to remind the viewer that it was all in fun and nothing was to be taken too seriously.These combined season sets are a great deal for anyone not already owning the individual season sets. I personally bought all of these shows as individual seasons as they were originally released, and I paid considerably more for each individual set than what these double-season repackages are going for.I must admit that I feel a bit ripped off, but of course this sort of thing seems to happen with DVD releases all the time. Has anyone ever paid full retail price for a new DVD title the week it came out, only to see it at less than half the price less than a year later in a delete bin somewhere? I know I have. The trouble is, do you buy a title as soon as it comes out and suffer the frustration when it shows up for sale at a dramatically reduced price just months later, or do you hold off buying it when it's first released in the hopes of getting a better deal later, and take the chance that it may go out of print and become unavailable?I would recommend these Tales From the Crypt double-seson sets to anyone not already owning them. Good entertainment at a great price. As for me, I'm going to hold off on buying and more TV series sets when they're first released... it seems to be the smartest thing to do! ;-)",5,"Great show, bad deal for owners of the individual seasons",1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1596,"['Tales', 'crypt', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'episodes', 'were', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'frequently', 'featured', 'cool', 'guest', 'stars', 'episodes', 'leaned', 'more', 'comical', 'side', 'whle', 'others', 'were', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'was', 'always', 'just', 'enough', 'self', 'induced', 'cheesyness', 'Crypt', 'Keeper', 'remind', 'viewer', 'was', 'fun', 'nothing', 'was', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously.These', 'combined', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'deal', 'anyone', 'not', 'already', 'owning', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'personally', 'bought', 'shows', 'individual', 'seasons', 'were', 'originally', 'released', 'paid', 'considerably', 'more', 'individual', 'set', 'what', 'double-season', 'repackages', 'are', 'going', 'for.I', 'must', 'admit', 'feel', 'bit', 'ripped', 'off', 'course', 'sort', 'thing', 'happen', 'DVD', 'time', 'Has', 'anyone', 'ever', 'paid', 'full', 'retail', 'price', 'new', 'DVD', 'title', 'week', 'came', 'out', 'only', 'see', 'less', 'price', 'less', 'year', 'later', 'delete', 'bin', 'somewhere', 'know', 'have', 'trouble', 'do', 'buy', 'title', 'as', 'soon', 'out', 'suffer', 'frustration', 'when', 'up', 'sale', 'dramatically', 'reduced', 'price', 'just', 'months', 'later', 'do', 'hold', 'off', 'buying', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'hopes', 'getting', 'better', 'deal', 'later', 'take', 'chance', 'may', 'go', 'print', 'become', 'unavailable', 'would', 'recommend', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'double-seson', 'sets', 'anyone', 'not', 'already', 'owning', 'Good', 'entertainment', 'great', 'price', ""'m"", 'going', 'hold', 'off', 'buying', 'more', 'TV', 'series', 'sets', 'when', ""'re"", 'first', 'released', 'be', 'smartest', 'thing', 'do']",N/A
