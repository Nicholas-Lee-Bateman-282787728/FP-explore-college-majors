Modifications and accommodations are not shown or explained.  Many moves involve jumping up and down or side to side.  Weights are used, but the instructor does not discuss how to use them safely.  The transitions between exercises are quick.If you are experienced at working out, this is a good DVD.  It's good to have for those times when you cannot get to the health club.

The woman performing the workout is different, but honestly, the workout is so similar to ""10 Days"" that there is really no point in purchasing this product if you have the other.There is a 30 second lecture to open the DVD about how weight lifting benefits your metabolism, but then the DVD proceeds to mislead viewers about what actually brings results.Using light weights in a cardio environment does very little, if nothing to build muscle for most, if not all trainees. At one point the women performs a lunge and then does a dumbbell row. The weight is so light that it doesn't produce a strain in any way.Progressively harder weight training is effective, but performing weight lifting exercises with weights that are so light that you barely notice they are there, is an utter waste of time.Outside of the weight training realm, this is just another average cardio DVD with nothing that really separates it from anything else on the shelf. Save your money, buy some adjustable dumbbells instead.One final note...most of the weight training exercises are performed improperly, or with little to know instruction about proper form.

I'm not a fan of Staehle, but this well-cued workout is nicely advanced at the level of Kelly Coffey or Cathe Friedrich. It is chaptered into cardio and weights and each section is long enough to make a difference (about 10 minutes alternating). Unlike '10 Days to a Better Body', this one allows you to do just weights or just cardio if you wish, or switch the order. It includes lots of balancing and compound moves. It also allows you to go heavy with the weights. The pace is just right and the music is pretty good as well. It is not at all the same as the other Results workout (with Cindy Whitmarsh).

It is easy to follow for the beginners and Tracey also shows you level 2 for intermediate levels. She also adds a lot of pulsing with the exercises for added challenge. I consider this a medium effort workout.I typically like exercise tapes that are filled with students for added interest and workout levels and I was a bit hesitant when the workout only included the instructor. She actually keeps the routine interesting and it's almost like have a personal training in your living room! (Training with Tracy is more like working with a real person... she's neither super-skinny nor big breasted.)The DVD has a menu choice for each of the ten 5-minutes sections and you can individually pick and choose the ones you want to do (or do the whole 50-minute routine). It would have been nice to build your own routine from each segment, but that choice is not available on this DVD. I don't know that I cared for the music all that much, it got on my nerves a bit.Here's the sequence on the DVD, each one is about 5 minutes long:Two sets of dumbbells are recommended (1 light and 1 heavier), but you could get away with just 1 set or none at all (for beginners)Warm UpWeights: Back & LegsCardioWeights: Shoulders & LegsCardioWeights: Biceps and TricepsCardioWeights: Leg BalanceWeights: Chest, Glutes, and HamstringsCool DownYou also get a ""Metabolism Boosting Meal Plan"" booklet with the DVD which includes a 1400 calorie a day 7-day menu and recipes for pepper & chicken stir-fry, chicken kabobs, chicken enchiladas, and protein smoothie.

1187508,AZAVU4V0J8S4V,B001F12ITE,Cheryl L. Malone,"[2, 3]","The first thing I looked at was the meal plan included.  The calorie count is good; staying under 1500 KC a day.  Keeping this caloric value and exercising assures weight loss.  The thing that caught my eye is the daily protein values.  The body can only assimilate so much protein per sitting; for the average woman it is about 25 grams per meal.  Beyond that the body excretes it in urine.  I noticed that one meal per day is double the protein needed and if you are a vegetarian you will need to substitute and recalculate but that is no big deal.  The average woman only needs about 60 grams per day and the amount on this meal plan is much higher.  On a short term basis this would be acceptable but not for a long term plan.  All in all I give the meal plan an A.I have to say the workout is not boring; there are a lot of segments and variety of movements; personally I don't care for the cardio but many people might.  The chapters are as follows:Warm-Up:  Upper back and Legs.  There is a slow heart rate increase, which is good.  Great variety: step touches with arm variety; hamstring curls & knee lifts, easy squats.  Good instruction with concentration on form.Weight Segment 1:  Back & Legs.  This segment works the big muscles for increase in caloric burn with good posture instruction.  Rows working the quads and back, legs & triceps with reverse kick-backs.  Shoulder work with one leg balance challenge; lats & back of legs are worked with dead lifts.Cardio 1:  Kind of a cha-cha lead in then squats with a jump, some pulsing squats & leg lifts, punching and kicking drills.  I cannot give this cardio a good rating because it is just not my style but I think many ladies would like it.Weight Segment 2: Shoulder & Legs.  Squats & lifts with weights, alternating one arm lifts with squats, a two arm flutter (quite good) with weights, lat raises & pulses in a holding squat.Cardio 2:  Kind of dance like with some jumps, side lunges, speed bag arm drills, jumping jacks, scissor legs, lunges with hand touches to floor.  I didn't care for this cardio segment, either but different strokes for different folks.Weight Segment 3:  Biceps & Triceps/ overhead triceps & pulses, kick-backs with side step to work the inner thighs, bicep curls, hammers & reverse curls, squats are included, reverse lunge with knee lifts.Cardio 3:  If you have back problems you might want to skip this section.  Bent over squats, jumping side to side with knee lifts, then knee lifts & kick, jump rope.Weight Segment 4:  Leg balance with a chair for level 1; works inner thighs & hip flexors, stationary exercises (ballet type), abduction to work glutes & back leg extensions to lengthen the hip flexors.Weight Segment 5: Chest/ Glutes & Hamstrings:  Floor work with a mat; chest press while in bridge both static & moving, flyes in bridge both static & moving.  A side arm reach (I haven't seen this exercise before but it feels great), with weights, and last but not least push-ups.Cool Down:  Gentle stretchesAll in all I have to say this is a good workout for most people but not for me.",4,Tracey Staehle Gives A Solid Workout,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,3087,"['first', 'thing', 'looked', 'was', 'meal', 'plan', 'included', 'calorie', 'count', 'good', 'staying', '1500', 'KC', 'day', 'Keeping', 'caloric', 'value', 'exercising', 'assures', 'weight', 'loss', 'thing', 'caught', 'eye', 'daily', 'protein', 'values', 'body', 'can', 'only', 'assimilate', 'so', 'much', 'protein', 'sitting', 'average', 'woman', '25', 'grams', 'meal', 'Beyond', 'body', 'urine', 'noticed', 'one', 'meal', 'day', 'double', 'protein', 'needed', 'are', 'vegetarian', 'will', 'need', 'substitute', 'recalculate', 'big', 'deal', 'average', 'woman', 'only', '60', 'grams', 'day', 'amount', 'meal', 'plan', 'much', 'higher', 'short', 'term', 'basis', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'not', 'long', 'term', 'plan', 'give', 'meal', 'plan', 'A.I', 'have', 'say', 'workout', 'not', 'boring', 'are', 'lot', 'segments', 'variety', 'movements', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'cardio', 'many', 'people', 'might', 'chapters', 'are', 'Warm-Up', 'Upper', 'back', 'Legs', 'slow', 'heart', 'rate', 'increase', 'good', 'Great', 'variety', 'step', 'touches', 'arm', 'variety', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'knee', 'lifts', 'easy', 'squats', 'Good', 'instruction', 'concentration', 'form.Weight', 'Segment', '1', 'Back', 'Legs', 'segment', 'big', 'muscles', 'increase', 'caloric', 'burn', 'good', 'posture', 'instruction', 'Rows', 'working', 'quads', 'back', 'legs', 'triceps', 'reverse', 'kick-backs', 'Shoulder', 'work', 'one', 'leg', 'balance', 'challenge', 'back', 'legs', 'are', 'worked', 'dead', 'lifts.Cardio', '1', 'Kind', 'cha-cha', 'lead', 'then', 'squats', 'jump', 'pulsing', 'squats', 'leg', 'lifts', 'punching', 'kicking', 'drills', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'cardio', 'good', 'rating', 'just', 'not', 'style', 'think', 'many', 'ladies', 'would', 'like', 'it.Weight', 'Segment', '2', 'Shoulder', 'Legs', 'Squats', 'lifts', 'weights', 'alternating', 'one', 'arm', 'lifts', 'squats', 'two', 'arm', 'flutter', 'quite', 'good', 'weights', 'lat', 'pulses', 'holding', 'squat.Cardio', '2', 'Kind', 'dance', 'jumps', 'side', 'lunges', 'speed', 'bag', 'arm', 'drills', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'scissor', 'legs', 'lunges', 'hand', 'touches', 'floor', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'cardio', 'segment', 'either', 'different', 'strokes', 'different', 'folks.Weight', 'Segment', '3', 'Biceps', 'Triceps/', 'overhead', 'triceps', 'pulses', 'kick-backs', 'side', 'step', 'work', 'inner', 'thighs', 'bicep', 'curls', 'hammers', 'reverse', 'curls', 'squats', 'are', 'included', 'reverse', 'lunge', 'knee', 'lifts.Cardio', '3', 'have', 'back', 'problems', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'section', 'Bent', 'squats', 'jumping', 'side', 'side', 'knee', 'lifts', 'then', 'knee', 'lifts', 'kick', 'jump', 'rope.Weight', 'Segment', '4', 'Leg', 'balance', 'chair', 'level', '1', 'works', 'inner', 'thighs', 'hip', 'flexors', 'stationary', 'exercises', 'ballet', 'type', 'abduction', 'work', 'glutes', 'back', 'leg', 'extensions', 'lengthen', 'hip', 'flexors.Weight', 'Segment', '5', 'Chest/', 'Glutes', 'Hamstrings', 'Floor', 'work', 'mat', 'chest', 'press', 'bridge', 'static', 'moving', 'flyes', 'bridge', 'static', 'moving', 'side', 'arm', 'reach', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'exercise', 'great', 'weights', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'push-ups.Cool', 'Down', 'Gentle', 'stretchesAll', 'have', 'say', 'good', 'workout', 'most', 'people', 'not']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism

Even still, I found this workout to be challenging and did a great job of working me into a sweat.  As others have said, it may not be the most fun workout but it is still quite effective.  However I will say there was enough variety in the exercises that it kept me from getting bored or losing my motivation.  As with any workout if you do it repetitively it does get boring.  However, it adds great variety of my routine and helps keep me motivated as I find the trainer approachable and inspiring without being chirpy or annoying.I especially appreciate that there are enough variation in the exercise to meet your level of fitness.  This makes the video one you can grow with over time even as your endurance increases and you become more in shape.  The only thing I am less convinced of is how much this body actually boosts your metabolism.  It is true that strength training helps, but without hard scientific facts I am not convinced it will be significant with  the way this workout is designed.

For those of us who are too busy to spend all the time and gas money we once did on the recreation we love, this is a quick and easy solution.You'll need a set of heavy dumbbells, a set of light dumbbells and a mat. (A towel and water any house will have, of course.) I didn't have the dumbbells, so I used 19 oz. soup cans. I'll invest in the dumbbells for this.Looking for muscle toner and cardio? Yes, this video will certainly do the trick. And it's fun, too, which is a big detail if you're going to stick with it. The moves are simple, too, which helps you stay with the program, as opposed to a video with long complex strings of quickly varying moves that have you standing still, staring at the screen, rewinding...and finally forgetting.Even so, you might want to listen to the whole video first before trying it; the explanations are hard to catch as you're also watching and trying to figure out (quickly!) what you're supposed to be doing. While the moves are simple, the details do matter if you're going to get everything out of your workout and it's hard to catch as you're trying to do it on the fly.A diet booklet for one week is included, and most of the food is really easy. Strawberries, cottage cheese, rice...simple and fast for your busy schedule. There are some recipes, too. The problem is, I'd love to see some substitutions in case you don't like some of the foods or cannot find what you need readily at the store, such as swordfish. I'm sure a store has it but I'll have to do some checking.The diet is designed to boost your metabolism. It's an overall healthy diet. I would love to see more veggies, if that's possible; more alkalizing foods as the diet is mostly acidic.I'm looking forward to using this video every day. It's fun, simple, effective, and I'm certain it will influence how I feel as I begin my workday feeling energized.",4,"Simple, effective, and fun",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1933,"['purpose', 'video/booklet', 'set', 'increase', 'metabolism', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'spend', 'time', 'gas', 'money', 'once', 'did', 'recreation', 'love', 'quick', 'easy', 'solution.You', ""'ll"", 'need', 'set', 'heavy', 'dumbbells', 'set', 'light', 'dumbbells', 'mat', 'towel', 'water', 'house', 'will', 'have', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'dumbbells', 'used', '19', 'oz', 'soup', 'cans', ""'ll"", 'invest', 'dumbbells', 'this.Looking', 'muscle', 'toner', 'cardio', 'Yes', 'video', 'will', 'certainly', 'do', 'trick', 'fun', 'too', 'big', 'detail', ""'re"", 'going', 'stick', 'moves', 'are', 'simple', 'too', 'stay', 'program', 'opposed', 'video', 'long', 'complex', 'strings', 'quickly', 'varying', 'moves', 'have', 'standing', 'still', 'staring', 'screen', 'rewinding', 'finally', 'forgetting.Even', 'so', 'might', 'want', 'listen', 'whole', 'video', 'first', 'before', 'trying', 'explanations', 'are', 'hard', 'catch', ""'re"", 'also', 'watching', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'quickly', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'moves', 'are', 'simple', 'details', 'do', 'matter', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'everything', 'workout', 'hard', 'catch', ""'re"", 'trying', 'do', 'fly.A', 'diet', 'booklet', 'one', 'week', 'included', 'most', 'food', 'really', 'easy', 'Strawberries', 'cottage', 'cheese', 'rice', 'simple', 'fast', 'busy', 'schedule', 'are', 'recipes', 'too', 'problem', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'substitutions', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'foods', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'what', 'need', 'readily', 'store', 'such', 'swordfish', ""'m"", 'sure', 'store', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'checking.The', 'diet', 'designed', 'boost', 'metabolism', 'overall', 'healthy', 'diet', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'veggies', 'possible', 'more', 'alkalizing', 'foods', 'diet', 'mostly', 'acidic.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'using', 'video', 'day', 'fun', 'simple', 'effective', ""'m"", 'certain', 'will', 'influence', 'how', 'feel', 'begin', 'workday', 'feeling', 'energized']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism

Schneider,"[29, 30]","I am a daily exerciser who does a range of workouts, from taebo, kickboxing, yoga, salsa, step etc.  I guess you could say that I have a boredom problem, so keeping it fresh with many workouts to choose from is important to me.  As I get older I also look to add in resistance training to keep my bones healthy, which is really important at any age.  I found the workout to be challenging (in a good way).  The workout is 52 minutes long and led by Tracey Staehle, who is a certified trainer with both the AFAA (Aerobic & Fitness Association of America) & NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine).  She also carries a Master's Degree in nutrition.The workout is 52 minutes long and consists of 5 minutes of warm-up, 31 minutes of Aerobic & Toning with Weights, that alternates, 12 minutes of additional toning and 4 minutes of cool down.  You will use a lighter set of weights for some of the exercises (3 lb is what I used) and heavier set (I used 5 to start, but realized 4 was already kicking my butt, so I'll work up to heavier).  As you get stronger, you have the option to up your weights for a challenge when you become accustomed to it.The routines start with an easier exercise and then you progress to a more challenging variation, which usually includes deeper squats, more body parts being active in the exercise, or in the aerobic segments, more jumping.I would caution, that this is a higher impact routine in the aerobic section and you will be doing some jumps, which rev up the metabolism and heart-rate, but may not be especially kind to those that have any knee issues.The routine is a one-on-one, and it is a straight up workout-Tracey is excellent on the cuing, has great form and keeps the workout at a good pace (I especially like when she tells me only a couple more to go!).All and all a good work-out.  Is it fun?  Well, I do have ones that I enjoy more, but for a sheer kick-butt workout that had me in a sweat, I'd say this one was the ticket. Oh, as a bonus....there is a booklet for meal planning to boost the metabolism as well.  I have not tried this, as I am happy with my diet at this point, but looked through it and the meals and recipes noted were definitely things that could assist you.  As someone who has lost over 45 lbs and kept it off for 4 years I can tell you the best eating program is the one you will stick with, so if this does it for you, great.

Very athletic.  I think the weight and cardio intervals are a bit too long.The exercise take up a bit more space than I have.  The music is a bit masculine for me.""10 Days to a Better Body"", by the same makers, is great.  There are one-minute intervals, and the music is pleasant.  It takes less room, and the workouts are 1/2 hours, 2 of them, once every other day.

1187524,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B001F12ITE,Leanne,"[3, 5]","Tracey Staehle is one of my favorite instructors, so I was eager to try this new workout of hers.  As a bit of background, I consider myself to be a high intermediate/advanced exerciser, and own about 120+ workout DVD's, including about five or six of Tracey's independent workouts.This workout is set up as a circuit so that you burn more calories by using your larger muscle groups.  It runs about 51 minutes long, and is broken up in alternating segments: a weight segment, followed by a cardio segment, which is then repeated. After a six-minute comprehensive warm-up, for instance,Tracey moves into the first weight segment (which is composed of back and leg exercises), before setting down the weights and moving into a short cardio segment that lasts about five minutes.  During each segment, she also kicks things up to what she calls Level 2, so you really go all-out.She cycles through each of the major muscle groups in a similar fashion, each time incorporating some leg work (such as lunges or squats) to help bring the calorie burn up.  By the time you finish this workout, you'll have worked all of the major muscle groups, although she did seem to spend more time on back and shoulders than on chest, biceps, and triceps.  By the time I finished this workout, I felt like I had worked everything and had a nice burn going.Some pro's:1.  Tracey is her usual cheery self in this workout; she is a sweetheart and her personality makes it a pleasure to work out with her.2.  She gives excellent form pointers throughout the workout, such as her reminders to ""reset your posture"" before starting a new weight exercise.3.  You only need two pairs of dumbbells (I actually used three pairs of 3's, 5's, and 8's) and a chair to do the workout.  (The chair is used for a segment that focuses on legs, and you will really feel the burn.  If you have Cathe F's Kick Max workout, the chair segment in this workout is similar to the one in Cathe's workout, although it is not as long.)4.  You can easily modify the moves to make the workout easier or harder.  I have a bad knee, so I couldn't do all the squats, lunges, and plie squats that she does, but I was able to modify those moves, along with the moves from the cardio sections.5.  There is a nice warm-up and a nice cool down in this workout.  Sometimes shorter workouts tend to skimp these sections, but this workout doesn't do so.6.  The booklet that comes with the DVD has a seven-day meal plan that looks fairly good, along with a couple of recipes.Some con's:1. The music on this workout is just so-so.  It's not the worst, but it's rather generic and average-sounding, and so not very motivating.2.  As mentioned, Tracey gives great form pointers, but the incessant chatter was a bit too much in places, esp. if you already know how to do these moves.  Even if you don't, after doing this workout a few times, the chatter may start to bother you.3.  There is no separate core segment in this workout.  Some of the exercises definitely work the core, but, in a full-body workout like this one, I would have preferred an actual core segment.Overall, this is a fun, solid workout, and I definitely recommend it!",4,Fun workout that hits all major muscle groups,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,3175,"['Tracey', 'Staehle', 'one', 'favorite', 'instructors', 'was', 'eager', 'try', 'new', 'workout', 'hers', 'bit', 'background', 'consider', 'be', 'high', 'intermediate/advanced', 'exerciser', 'own', '120+', 'workout', 'DVD', 'including', 'five', 'six', 'Tracey', 'independent', 'workouts.This', 'workout', 'set', 'up', 'circuit', 'burn', 'more', 'calories', 'using', 'larger', 'muscle', 'groups', '51', 'minutes', 'long', 'broken', 'up', 'alternating', 'segments', 'weight', 'segment', 'followed', 'cardio', 'segment', 'then', 'repeated', 'six-minute', 'comprehensive', 'warm-up', 'instance', 'Tracey', 'first', 'weight', 'segment', 'composed', 'back', 'leg', 'exercises', 'setting', 'down', 'weights', 'moving', 'short', 'cardio', 'segment', 'five', 'minutes', 'segment', 'also', 'things', 'up', 'what', 'Level', '2', 'so', 'really', 'go', 'all-out.She', 'cycles', 'major', 'muscle', 'groups', 'similar', 'fashion', 'time', 'incorporating', 'leg', 'work', 'such', 'lunges', 'squats', 'help', 'bring', 'calorie', 'burn', 'up', 'time', 'finish', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'have', 'worked', 'major', 'muscle', 'groups', 'did', 'seem', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'back', 'shoulders', 'chest', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'time', 'finished', 'workout', 'felt', 'had', 'worked', 'everything', 'had', 'nice', 'burn', 'going.Some', ""pro's:1"", 'Tracey', 'usual', 'cheery', 'self', 'workout', 'sweetheart', 'personality', 'pleasure', 'work', 'out', 'her.2', 'excellent', 'form', 'pointers', 'workout', 'such', 'reminders', 'reset', 'posture', 'starting', 'new', 'weight', 'exercise.3', 'only', 'need', 'two', 'pairs', 'dumbbells', 'actually', 'used', 'three', 'pairs', '3', '5', '8', 'chair', 'do', 'workout', 'chair', 'used', 'segment', 'legs', 'will', 'really', 'feel', 'burn', 'have', 'Cathe', 'F', 'Kick', 'Max', 'workout', 'chair', 'segment', 'workout', 'similar', 'one', 'Cathe', 'workout', 'not', 'long.', '4', 'can', 'easily', 'modify', 'moves', 'make', 'workout', 'easier', 'harder', 'have', 'bad', 'knee', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'squats', 'lunges', 'plie', 'squats', 'was', 'able', 'modify', 'moves', 'moves', 'cardio', 'sections.5', 'nice', 'warm-up', 'nice', 'cool', 'down', 'workout', 'Sometimes', 'shorter', 'workouts', 'tend', 'skimp', 'sections', 'workout', ""n't"", 'do', 'so.6', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'seven-day', 'meal', 'plan', 'fairly', 'good', 'couple', 'recipes.Some', ""con's:1"", 'music', 'workout', 'just', 'so-so', 'not', 'worst', 'rather', 'generic', 'average-sounding', 'so', 'not', 'very', 'motivating.2', 'mentioned', 'Tracey', 'great', 'form', 'pointers', 'incessant', 'chatter', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'places', 'esp', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'doing', 'workout', 'few', 'times', 'chatter', 'may', 'start', 'you.3', 'separate', 'core', 'segment', 'workout', 'exercises', 'definitely', 'work', 'core', 'full-body', 'workout', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'actual', 'core', 'segment.Overall', 'fun', 'solid', 'workout', 'definitely', 'recommend']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism

Several of the exercises build up to either a second or third degree of difficulty.Other than that, I love the workout. She really mixes it up and does a great job of working the legs, back, abs, and arms. I did not get bored even once, and the workout seemed to fly by. After warm-up she alternates weights and cardio, with each segment being quite different than the last. The dvd allows for direct chapter access if you want to shorten your workout. I would deem this to be an intermediate level workout.The included diet plan is nothing revolutionary, but it's a good solid whole foods program that won't break your budget.

I do work out more than that, but I found I got frustrated because I'm used to changing up my workouts, rather than doing an hour of the same workout.And with injured knees, I'm unable to take full advantage of this workout.I am still able to try a lot of the exercises here, though, because Staehle starts at ""Level 1"", easing into each exercise at a low level before pushing it to ""Level 2"", a high impact version of the same workout.  If you need to start slowly or stay at low impact, it's possible to stick with lighter weights (or no weights at all) and to repeat the Level 1 workouts instead of moving up to Level 2.The included meal plan seems OK, though it won't be appropriate for everyone.  It's a one week plan, 1400 calories a day.  It does seem like a good, reasonable mix of protein, carbs and fat that is appropriate for a muscle-building workout, and it includes three meals plus an AM snack, a PM (before dinner) snack, and an evening snack.  If 1400 calories is right for you, and if you need the guidance of a meal plan to tell you everything you're allowed to eat (which can be a good training tool if you need to learn portion sizes,) and if you have the time to follow the plan and measure everything you eat, this looks like a good plan to follow.If you've got that reunion or wedding coming up in a few months and you need to follow a very structured plan to shave off a couple of inches and tone up those sagging arms, I think this is a good way to go.  It's also a good starting point to learn how to structure a workout and build some muscle.  But it's going to take a serious commitment and a big block of time.  If you're up to it, go for it.",4,"Tough workout, but adjustable for those who can't kick it up to 11",1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2560,"['good', 'news', 'follow', 'instructions', 'DVD', 'meal', 'plan', 'letter', ""'re"", 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'see', 'dramatic', 'results.The', 'realistic', 'news', 'can', 'follow', 'instructions', 'letter', ""'re"", 'probably', 'already', 'fantastic', 'shape.Tracey', 'Staehle', 'instructions', 'are', 'clear', 'easy', 'follow', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'need', 'do', 'part', 'body', ""'re"", 'working', 'describes', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'one', 'minute', 'introduction', 'explaining', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'aerobics', 'building', 'muscle', 'why', 'important', 'boosting', 'metabolism', 'five', 'minute', 'warm-up', '50', 'minute', 'workout', '5', 'minute', 'cool-down', 'see', 'promised', 'results', 'should', 'do', 'workout', '2-3', 'times', 'week', 'day', 'two', 'allow', 'muscles', 'recover.That', 'serious', 'commitment', 'big', 'chunk', 'time', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'more', 'found', 'got', 'frustrated', ""'m"", 'used', 'changing', 'up', 'workouts', 'rather', 'doing', 'hour', 'same', 'workout.And', 'injured', 'knees', ""'m"", 'unable', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'workout.I', 'am', 'still', 'able', 'try', 'lot', 'exercises', 'here', 'though', 'Staehle', 'Level', '1', 'easing', 'exercise', 'low', 'level', 'pushing', 'Level', '2', 'high', 'impact', 'version', 'same', 'workout', 'need', 'start', 'slowly', 'stay', 'low', 'impact', 'possible', 'stick', 'lighter', 'weights', 'weights', 'repeat', 'Level', '1', 'workouts', 'instead', 'moving', 'up', 'Level', '2.The', 'included', 'meal', 'plan', 'OK', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'appropriate', 'everyone', 'one', 'week', 'plan', '1400', 'calories', 'day', 'seem', 'good', 'reasonable', 'mix', 'protein', 'carbs', 'fat', 'appropriate', 'muscle-building', 'workout', 'three', 'meals', 'AM', 'snack', 'PM', 'dinner', 'snack', 'evening', 'snack', '1400', 'calories', 'right', 'need', 'guidance', 'meal', 'plan', 'tell', 'everything', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'eat', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'training', 'tool', 'need', 'learn', 'portion', 'sizes', 'have', 'time', 'follow', 'plan', 'measure', 'everything', 'eat', 'good', 'plan', 'follow.If', ""'ve"", 'got', 'reunion', 'wedding', 'coming', 'up', 'few', 'months', 'need', 'follow', 'very', 'structured', 'plan', 'shave', 'off', 'couple', 'inches', 'tone', 'up', 'sagging', 'arms', 'think', 'good', 'way', 'go', 'also', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'learn', 'how', 'structure', 'workout', 'build', 'muscle', 'going', 'take', 'serious', 'commitment', 'big', 'block', 'time', ""'re"", 'up', 'go']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism
1187534,A32HAMICRE52M,B001F12ITE,Pippa Lee,"[1, 1]","I decided to kick off the New Year by trying Tracey Staehle's ""Boost Your Metabolism"" workout.  It was easy to follow but yet challenging enough that I felt it in my legs by the time I finished.This is an interval workout combining five weight-training segments with three cardio segments.  The first weight segment works the back and legs; the second one, the shoulders and legs again.  Biceps and triceps are covered on the third segment. The fourth one focuses on the legs and the last one on the chest, glutes and hamstrings.  In addition to your dumbbells, you're going to need a chair for the fourth segment and a mat for the fifth one.The cardio segments were just long enough for me (between 5 to 7 minutes) to get my heart pumping, but thankfully short enough that I did not feel tired nor was I out of breath.  The moves are not complicated.  Though you don't need a large space to do the cardio, make sure that you have enough legroom for both front and back kicks.Thorough the workout Staehle demonstrates two levels of difficulty.  Level one is for beginners and a more challenging Level 2 for those with more stamina and flexibility. Level 2 usually involves doing deeper lunges, lots of squats, jumps and leg balances.  Since I have sensitive knees, I found myself keeping the lower part of my body on Level 1 while my upper body followed Level 2 movements.  Staehle works out alone, and she effectively guides you by emphasizing proper form, cuing you to the next movement and by encouraging you to try the next level or to go at your own pace if it is too much.I recommend this fitness DVD to both beginners and intermediate exercisers.  I like the fact that it helps to tone different muscle groups at the same time with straightforward moves.

1187535,A20J4FB33G3X4X,B001F12ITE,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","While this is a good workout, there were a couple things that I didn't like.  First, when the upper body parts are worked out, they are worked out all at once - for instance, three back exercises in a row, three shoulder exercises in a row, etc.  For me, this made it difficult because my muscles were already fatigued after the first round, and I had to do more and more.  Additionally, the lower body is worked out as add-ons to the upper body parts, so you might start out doing shoulder raises, but then squats are added in together with the shoulder raises.  Unless you are very coordinated, either the lower body or the upper body might suffer because it's sometimes hard to concentrate on all the moves at once.  This brings me to my final complaint - there is no ab work in this 52 minute workout.  She keeps saying throughout that you should ""engage your abs so we don't have to do crunches later.""  Well, when you're working your arms and legs at the same time, it's really hard to also focus on engaging the core.Overall, it's a tough workout, and if you're able to focus on doing upper and lower body exercises together, then you'll really get good results.",4,"Good workout, but....",1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1169,"['good', 'workout', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'First', 'when', 'upper', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'worked', 'out', 'are', 'worked', 'out', 'once', 'instance', 'three', 'back', 'row', 'three', 'shoulder', 'exercises', 'row', 'etc', 'made', 'difficult', 'muscles', 'were', 'already', 'fatigued', 'first', 'round', 'had', 'do', 'more', 'more', 'Additionally', 'lower', 'body', 'worked', 'out', 'add-ons', 'upper', 'body', 'parts', 'might', 'start', 'out', 'doing', 'shoulder', 'raises', 'then', 'squats', 'are', 'added', 'together', 'shoulder', 'are', 'very', 'coordinated', 'lower', 'body', 'upper', 'body', 'might', 'suffer', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'concentrate', 'moves', 'once', 'final', 'complaint', 'ab', 'work', '52', 'minute', 'workout', 'saying', 'should', 'engage', 'abs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'crunches', 'later', 'Well', 'when', ""'re"", 'working', 'arms', 'legs', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'hard', 'also', 'focus', 'engaging', 'core.Overall', 'tough', 'workout', ""'re"", 'able', 'focus', 'doing', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'together', 'then', ""'ll"", 'really', 'get', 'good', 'results']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism

The idea behind increasing your metabolism is that if you have more muscle then you burn more calories all day long (even when you are not working out).  I think this is a great strategy and it really does work.I know a lot of women are afraid of building muscles and I have two comments about this concern.  First, it takes a lot of hard work to build muscle mass and it will not happen overnight.  If someone is very concerned about building muscles too big, she could always use lighter weights.  Second, I personally think there is nothing wrong with a woman with a few muscles.  If you ever saw any of Frank Franzetta's paintings, the women in them are often muscular and it's all part of their attractiveness.Working out along with the video is good because it keeps you going and is like getting a workout from a personal trainer.  The menu allows one to pick any section of the DVD from warm-up to cool down (going through the entire video may take some training as it is fairly intense).

Sofield ""geministar91""","[0, 0]","I purchased this product based on a different review site that thought highly of it, then after I'd already ordered it, read the reviews here on Amazon. I have to strongly disagree with the reviewers who state that it is not for a beginner. I would classify myself as perhaps an ""Adv. Beginner"" when it comes to working out and I found this workout to be VERY easy to stick with and didn't find myself wanting to quit at any point. Mixing the cardio and strength training really gives you a chance to catch your breath in between. Tracey breaks every exercise down into level 1, 2, & 3. Not once did I feel like I couldn't make it to the 3rd level. Therefore my conclusion is that if a dead beginner to working out tried this dvd, sticking with level 1 of all the exercises would not be hard for them. I do recommend watching it all the way through once before doing it because she moves from one thing to another without much warning or explanation, but once you get the hang of it you're fine. I did the workout for the first time this morning and afterward I really felt it in my butt and thighs (the two areas I feel need the most help on me!) so that made me happy! I don't think I'll be following the meal plan thats included but it has good suggestions and a few interesting recipes.

Therefore, this review is based upon her experiences with this product, and not my own. With that noted, here is her review.When you get this DVD, the very first thing you should do is sit down and watch it a couple of times first before you actually try and following along with the exercises. At first I tried to just jump in with the DVD and it just didn't work for me. So I sat down and watched the DVD twice, in a row, and then on the third time I followed along with the exercises and had a much easier time with it.I have to admit that at first I thought this was an aerobic DVD, but soon found out that it was anything but. As a matter of fact, I actually had fun doing the exercises, although admittedly I was pretty sore two days after doing it the first time. Now that I have been doing these exercises three times per week for the past three weeks, I am nowhere near as sore as I was, and I am actually feeling better and I have even lost a little weight and I really hope that I don't find it again. Now I haven't really been following the diet program ""Metabolism Boosting Meal Plan"" that was included with this DVD. Although it does seem like it is a good one, I just have better luck with an entirely different diet.I have actually made better progress going to the gym and actually lifting weights and utilizing the various weight machines. However, having said that, I have actually done better at the gym since I incorporated this workout on the days I don't go to the gym.

1187540,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B001F12ITE,Sheri in Reho,"[6, 7]","I have a friend over twice a week to do DVD workouts in my livingroom.  This week, we tried Boost Your Metabolism, which is a sequence of alternating strength and cardio segments and also includes a warmup and cooldown.Before I continue with my review, I find that it helps readers to know what my age and fitness level are so they can tell whether they may have a similar experience with the DVD.  I am in my late 50s and my friend is in her late 60s.  I walk daily and have gone to the gym 2-3 times a week for the past year.  She walks regularly and has gone to the gym 1-2 times a week for the past year.  I am overweight by about 60 pounds; she has maintained a weight loss for years.  We both have bad knees, so anything high impact is a problem for us.After the workout, I asked my friend what rating she would give it if she was doing the review.  She said 3 stars and that's what I was thinking as well.  Here are some issues with the workout from our perspective.1. Too high impact/knee punishing: Lots of jumping up in the air and very deep lunges.  We know our limits so we just did our own moves during the jumping portions and did a modified lunge vs. the very deep lunge.2. Instructor issues:  The instructor is cheerful and has a good sense of humor, but while she may TELL you what's coming next verbally, she doesn't SHOW you, and often she doesn't tell you what direction you're going or on which leg to start.  This caused confusion and frustration for both of us.  Granted, it was our first time doing the DVD, but I have done scores of DVD workouts in the past 7 years and I have not found most of them this confusing to follow at the start.3. Weight level:  As an FYI, you'll want to start with a lighter set of weights than you usually use for your upper body workout when you do this DVD.  I usually use 5s at home for most DVD workouts and 8s, 10s or 12s at the gym and I know I couldn't have gotten through the weight portions of this workout with any of those.  Both my friend and I used a set of 2 pounders and even that was a struggle at times because of the repetition and pulses, and because you're always working lower body at the same time, so it is a more intense workout than just standing still and doing bicep curls.4. Cardio level: Both of us definitely felt this workout while we were doing it and we were both sweating by the 2nd cardio segment but, interestingly, I'm not feeling it much at all today (the day after) and I expected that I would.5. Not for beginners or those who have poor balance or coordination:  My friend and I agreed that we would not recommend this workout to people who are just starting a workout regime.  While I am quite coordinated and usually pick up dance and workout moves quite easily, my friend says she is not as coordinated and has always struggled with workouts that have both upper and lower body going at the same time.  So if *I* was frustrated with the complexity and lack of adequate queueing in this workout, you can imagine how SHE felt.  I could tell she was exasperated.6. There IS a cooldown segment, I felt that it was inadequate for the intensity and breadth of the workout.In summary, if you are at a moderate or advanced level with aerobics/cardio and are in good health, you may quite enjoy this workout, but I do not recommend it if you are a beginner or have issues with your knees/hips or high impact workouts.",3,A good workout but with some flaws,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,3405,"['have', 'friend', 'twice', 'week', 'do', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'livingroom', 'week', 'tried', 'Boost', 'Your', 'Metabolism', 'sequence', 'alternating', 'strength', 'cardio', 'segments', 'also', 'warmup', 'cooldown.Before', 'continue', 'review', 'find', 'readers', 'know', 'what', 'age', 'fitness', 'level', 'are', 'so', 'can', 'tell', 'may', 'have', 'similar', 'experience', 'DVD', 'am', 'late', '50s', 'friend', 'late', '60s', 'walk', 'daily', 'have', 'gone', 'gym', '2-3', 'times', 'week', 'past', 'year', 'walks', 'regularly', 'gone', 'gym', '1-2', 'times', 'week', 'past', 'year', 'am', 'overweight', '60', 'pounds', 'maintained', 'weight', 'loss', 'years', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'anything', 'high', 'impact', 'problem', 'us.After', 'workout', 'asked', 'friend', 'what', 'rating', 'would', 'give', 'was', 'doing', 'review', 'said', '3', 'stars', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'as', 'well', 'Here', 'are', 'issues', 'workout', 'perspective.1', 'Too', 'high', 'impact/knee', 'punishing', 'Lots', 'jumping', 'up', 'air', 'very', 'deep', 'lunges', 'know', 'limits', 'just', 'did', 'own', 'moves', 'jumping', 'portions', 'did', 'modified', 'lunge', 'very', 'deep', 'lunge.2', 'Instructor', 'issues', 'instructor', 'cheerful', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'may', 'TELL', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'verbally', ""n't"", 'SHOW', 'often', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'direction', ""'re"", 'going', 'leg', 'start', 'caused', 'confusion', 'frustration', 'Granted', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'doing', 'DVD', 'have', 'done', 'scores', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'past', '7', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'most', 'confusing', 'follow', 'start.3', 'Weight', 'level', 'FYI', ""'ll"", 'want', 'start', 'lighter', 'set', 'weights', 'usually', 'use', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'when', 'do', 'DVD', 'usually', 'use', '5s', 'home', 'most', 'DVD', 'workouts', '8s', '10s', '12s', 'gym', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'weight', 'portions', 'workout', 'friend', 'used', 'set', '2', 'pounders', 'even', 'was', 'struggle', 'times', 'repetition', 'pulses', ""'re"", 'always', 'working', 'lower', 'body', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'intense', 'workout', 'just', 'standing', 'still', 'doing', 'bicep', 'curls.4', 'Cardio', 'level', 'definitely', 'felt', 'workout', 'were', 'doing', 'were', 'sweating', '2nd', 'cardio', 'segment', 'interestingly', ""'m"", 'not', 'feeling', 'much', 'today', 'day', 'expected', 'would.5', 'Not', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'poor', 'balance', 'coordination', 'friend', 'agreed', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'workout', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'workout', 'regime', 'am', 'quite', 'coordinated', 'usually', 'pick', 'up', 'dance', 'workout', 'moves', 'quite', 'easily', 'friend', 'not', 'coordinated', 'always', 'struggled', 'workouts', 'have', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'So', '*I*', 'was', 'frustrated', 'complexity', 'lack', 'adequate', 'queueing', 'workout', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'SHE', 'felt', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'exasperated.6', 'cooldown', 'segment', 'felt', 'was', 'inadequate', 'intensity', 'breadth', 'workout.In', 'summary', 'are', 'moderate', 'advanced', 'level', 'aerobics/cardio', 'are', 'good', 'health', 'may', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'are', 'beginner', 'have', 'issues', 'knees/hips', 'high', 'impact', 'workouts']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism
1187541,A2OWR5G2OAQF7C,B001F12ITE,Sincerely Yours,"[0, 0]","Notice: this is NOT an aerobic exercise program.  The theme of this dvd is to work on your core muscles of your whole body.It is 55 minute workout broken out into five key weight segments and three cardio segments:Weight segment 1: back and legscardio 1Weight segment 2: shoulders and legscardio 2Weight segment 3: biceps and tricepsCardio 3WS 4: leg balanceWS 5: chest, glutes and hamstringcool downwhen you are in the cardio and weight segments there are two levels: level 1 and level 2 => different level of difficulties, which the instructor explains one after the other.  This is the bit that I wish they had another person or a inset to explain, because as a more intermediate exerciser, I had to follow/wait for level 2 before I could really partake and often I wished for some of the weights pieces that the repetition was for at least 10 instead of instructions for 5 at level 1 and 5 at level 2.  Although once you have gone through the dvd a few times, you can either do level 1 or 2.it seems deceiving in the first 10 minutes of the exercise whether you are getting anything out of it (intermediate speaking), but believe me once I hit the 30 minutes, I was feeling the muscle burn.  I have tried this dvd twice on alternate dates without overworking my muscle groups.So this dvd is great at home workout with minimum equipment (one set of large, one set of smaller dumb bells, mat and a chair) required, some space to move and jump for the cardio segments.  I like the fact that both beginners and intermediates could use it.

1187543,ACQYIC13JXAOI,B001F12ITE,Tooncesmom,"[4, 4]","Results Fitness: Boost Your MetabolismA new workout from NASM certified trainer Tracey Staehle designed to boost metabolism by working core muscles and building endurance.As mentioned, this is not a beginner's workout DVD, however, it's a great adjunct to your fitness program, especially when an hour at the gym isn't possible.  All that's required is a little space, a mat, hand weights ranging from 3 to 10 pounds (I recommend both three and ten pound weights) and a chair.This is a one-on-one workout--almost like having your own personal trainer.  The routine is divided into different activity level segments--a 5 minute warm-up, then a half hour of aerobic and toning (using weights), another 12 minutes of toning and a four-minute cool-down.  Each segment has at least two levels and you can modify--or skip--the second level if you need a less strenuous workout.Tracey combines moves so that more than one area is worked together, for example, upper and lower body moves as in the lunge where you're also working back and shoulders.I'm a certified water fitness trainer and I found myself working hard at the halfway point, evidence that this is a challenging workout for anyone not in shape.  For maximum results, an eating plan is included.  I'd suggest you try it or something similar.I would recommend this workout with one caveat: little to no instruction for modifying exercises to compensate for knee or hip issues is addressed, so you need to use a little discretion on how vigorously you attempt each routine.",4,Very focused intermediate workout,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,1527,"['Results', 'Fitness', 'Boost', 'MetabolismA', 'new', 'workout', 'NASM', 'certified', 'trainer', 'Tracey', 'Staehle', 'designed', 'boost', 'metabolism', 'working', 'core', 'muscles', 'building', 'endurance.As', 'mentioned', 'not', 'beginner', 'workout', 'DVD', 'however', 'great', 'adjunct', 'fitness', 'program', 'especially', 'when', 'hour', 'gym', ""n't"", 'possible', 'required', 'little', 'space', 'mat', 'hand', 'weights', 'ranging', '3', '10', 'pounds', 'recommend', 'three', 'ten', 'pound', 'weights', 'chair.This', 'one-on-one', 'workout', 'almost', 'having', 'own', 'personal', 'trainer', 'routine', 'divided', 'different', 'activity', 'level', 'segments', '5', 'minute', 'warm-up', 'then', 'half', 'hour', 'aerobic', 'toning', 'using', 'weights', '12', 'minutes', 'toning', 'four-minute', 'cool-down', 'segment', 'least', 'two', 'levels', 'can', 'modify', 'skip', 'second', 'level', 'need', 'less', 'strenuous', 'workout.Tracey', 'combines', 'moves', 'so', 'more', 'one', 'area', 'worked', 'together', 'example', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'moves', 'lunge', 'where', ""'re"", 'also', 'working', 'back', 'shoulders.I', ""'m"", 'certified', 'water', 'fitness', 'trainer', 'found', 'working', 'hard', 'halfway', 'point', 'evidence', 'challenging', 'workout', 'anyone', 'not', 'shape', 'maximum', 'results', 'eating', 'plan', 'included', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'try', 'something', 'similar.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'workout', 'one', 'caveat', 'little', 'instruction', 'modifying', 'exercises', 'compensate', 'knee', 'hip', 'issues', 'addressed', 'need', 'use', 'little', 'discretion', 'how', 'vigorously', 'attempt', 'routine']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism

Tracy Staehle is a great instructor who cues expertly and has lots of enthusiam without sounding like an annoying cheerleader ;)  The DVD is just Tracy performing all the exercises and not a class format.This 50 minute workout starts out with a warm-up and then goes into intervals starting with weights and then cardio.The weight lifting intervals are mostly four limb exercises--you use the weights in your hands and move you legs at the same time.  You will do arm raises while squatting, bicep curls while doing leg lunges etc.  My cardio level stayed high during these intervals.  I usually use 5 to 8 pound weights when I practice with these types of DVD's (The Firm/Biggest Loser) but with this one, I had to drop down to 5 for heavy and then 3 and even 2 pounds on some of the exercises...it really works the arms!If you are not a regular exerciser, I would start with 1 pound weights and then move up to the suggested 3 pounds.The cardio sequences are well cued with decent music. I appreciate the fact that the instructor builds the sequence in three levels cueing the moves before they happen, not leaving us behind.  Beginners can stay at the first level for the entire cardio sequence and still get a very good workout.  The second level adds more arm or leg movement and the third level may add plyometrics or jumping.  If this bothers you, just stay at the first level.I will add this one to my regular rotation.",5,This is an all-over toner!,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1445,"['like', 'DVD', 'Tracy', 'Staehle', 'great', 'instructor', 'who', 'expertly', 'lots', 'enthusiam', 'sounding', 'annoying', 'cheerleader', 'DVD', 'just', 'Tracy', 'performing', 'exercises', 'not', 'class', 'format.This', '50', 'minute', 'workout', 'out', 'warm-up', 'then', 'intervals', 'starting', 'weights', 'then', 'cardio.The', 'weight', 'lifting', 'intervals', 'are', 'mostly', 'four', 'limb', 'exercises', 'use', 'weights', 'hands', 'move', 'legs', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'do', 'arm', 'raises', 'squatting', 'bicep', 'curls', 'doing', 'leg', 'lunges', 'etc', 'cardio', 'level', 'stayed', 'high', 'intervals', 'usually', 'use', '5', '8', 'pound', 'weights', 'when', 'practice', 'types', 'DVD', 'Firm/Biggest', 'Loser', 'one', 'had', 'drop', 'down', '5', 'heavy', 'then', '3', 'even', '2', 'pounds', 'exercises', 'really', 'arms', 'are', 'not', 'regular', 'exerciser', 'would', 'start', '1', 'pound', 'weights', 'then', 'move', 'up', 'suggested', '3', 'pounds.The', 'cardio', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'cued', 'decent', 'music', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'instructor', 'sequence', 'three', 'levels', 'cueing', 'moves', 'happen', 'not', 'leaving', 'Beginners', 'can', 'stay', 'first', 'level', 'entire', 'cardio', 'sequence', 'still', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'second', 'level', 'more', 'arm', 'leg', 'movement', 'third', 'level', 'may', 'add', 'plyometrics', 'jumping', 'bothers', 'just', 'stay', 'first', 'level.I', 'will', 'add', 'one', 'regular', 'rotation']",Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism
