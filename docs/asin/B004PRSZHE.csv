Why hasn't the studio released all of Power's movies on DVD?  They were all good...all representative of the wonderful Golden Age of Hollywood....all entertaining. Tyrone Power was a fine actor and a #1 box office attraction during what many consider the best days of Hollywood.  His movies are still popular.  I will continue to look for KING OF THE KHYBER RIFLES to add to my collection! It is hard for me to rate this one as I haven't seen it, but I am guessing a 4-star.",4,Why not available in USA??,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,585,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Ty', 'Power', 'movies', 'own', 'most', 'However', 'only', 'one', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Why', ""n't"", 'studio', 'released', 'Power', 'movies', 'DVD', 'were', 'good', 'representative', 'wonderful', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', '.all', 'entertaining', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'was', 'fine', 'actor', '1', 'box', 'office', 'attraction', 'what', 'many', 'consider', 'best', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'popular', 'will', 'continue', 'look', 'KING', 'OF', 'THE', 'KHYBER', 'RIFLES', 'add', 'collection', 'hard', 'rate', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'am', 'guessing', '4-star']",King of the Khyber Rifles [Region 2]

1423792,AXHCIHVT92GYF,B004PRSZHE,The CinemaScope Cat,"[1, 1]","A newly arrived Captain (Tyrone Power) to the North West Frontier must deal with the prejudice of being a half caste (a British father, a Muslim mother). The situation intensifies when it is discovered that his adopted brother (Guy Rolfe) is an anti-British fanatic who is leading a rebellion against the British and also, when he begins romancing the daughter (Terry Moore) of his garrison's General (Michael Rennie). Based on the novel of the same name and previously made in 1929 by John Ford, this early CinemaScope offering is a grand ""Boys' Own"" adventure tale with all the requisite ingredients. A dashing and handsome hero, a lovely damsel, thrilling battles, desert storms, an exotic and colorful background. Leon Shamroy's (PLANET OF THE APES) majestic cinematography makes the Sierra Nevada mountains and Lone Pine, California locations look like 1857 India! Directed by Henry King and with a glorious Bernard Herrmann score which gets the film's pulse going. With John Justin, Murray Matheson, Frank DeKova and Argentina Brunetti.The Fox DVD from Spain is a nice wide screen (2.35) stereophonic transfer though it is not anamorphic.",4,Tyrone Power in a grand adventure!,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,1144,"['newly', 'arrived', 'Captain', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'North', 'West', 'Frontier', 'must', 'deal', 'prejudice', 'being', 'half', 'caste', 'British', 'father', 'Muslim', 'mother', 'situation', 'when', 'discovered', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Guy', 'Rolfe', 'anti-British', 'fanatic', 'who', 'leading', 'rebellion', 'British', 'also', 'when', 'romancing', 'daughter', 'Terry', 'Moore', 'garrison', 'General', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'Based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'previously', 'made', '1929', 'John', 'Ford', 'early', 'CinemaScope', 'offering', 'grand', 'Boys', 'Own', 'adventure', 'tale', 'requisite', 'ingredients', 'dashing', 'handsome', 'hero', 'lovely', 'damsel', 'thrilling', 'battles', 'desert', 'storms', 'exotic', 'colorful', 'background', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'majestic', 'cinematography', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'mountains', 'Lone', 'Pine', 'California', 'locations', 'look', '1857', 'India', 'Directed', 'Henry', 'King', 'glorious', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'score', 'film', 'pulse', 'going', 'John', 'Justin', 'Murray', 'Matheson', 'Frank', 'DeKova', 'Argentina', 'Brunetti.The', 'Fox', 'DVD', 'Spain', 'nice', 'wide', 'screen', '2.35', 'stereophonic', 'transfer', 'not', 'anamorphic']",King of the Khyber Rifles [Region 2]
1423793,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B004PRSZHE,Trevor Willsmer,"[6, 6]","Heard the one about the halfbreed who joins the cavalry and has to fight prejudice from his comrades at the fort and his own people on the frontier? King of the Khyber Rifles relocates many of the old standbys of cavalry pictures from the Old West to the North West Frontier, with Tyrone Power the half-caste British army officer who finds himself serving in his hometown in the runup to another Indian Mutiny and Night of the Long Knives...Based very loosely on Talbot Munday's semi-autobiographical novel and a remake of John Ford's 1929 The Black Watch, it's not quite She Wore a Yellow Sari or Rio Ganges but it bears more resemblance at times to Western movie stereotypes than its much changed source material. This was only 20th Century Fox's fourth CinemaScope picture, and at times it's clear that all-but forgotten A-list director Henry King (Carousel, Love is a Many-Splendored Thing, The Gunfighter) doesn't know quite what to make of it - one early scene groups all the characters in a scene in the right hand side of the frame with the remainder simply filled with sky as if he were still shooting in Academy ratio. Nor do you get the impression that the studio lavished much money on it despite the success of its director-star partnership. It was King who had directed Power's star-making role in Lloyds of London, and they went on to make a further ten films in a pairing that in its day was bigger news at the box-office than John Ford and John Wayne thanks to pictures like In Old Chicago, Alexander's Ragtime Band, Jessie James, A Yank in the R.A.F., The Black Swan, Captain from Castille, Prince of Foxes, Untamed and The Sun Also Rises. Even on the rare occasions their films flopped they still outgrossed many a hit, though its tempting to suspect that this one's box-office success was more due to the novelty of CinemaScope - `The Miracle You See Without Glasses!' - and stereophonic sound than the quality of the film itself.This is definitely one of their lesser efforts thanks to a rather underdeveloped story that feels like it was rushed into production without a completed script. At times the film very conspicuously seems to be missing scenes that should be there but you suspect were never even filmed, such as Power's meeting with the Indian who raised him when he was orphaned. The third act may rely on the bond Power's hero builds with his native troops but the film never bothers to show us how he earns that loyalty or licks them into shape, while his romance with the colonel's daughter (Terry Moore) has her simply throwing herself at him from the moment he arrives while her well-intentioned father's qualms over their interracial relationship are never resolved. Nor is there a great deal of action, with even the final battle rather a so-so affair despite the promise of plentiful close quarters combat. You can spot a curious cameo from director John Farrow in an unbilled bit part as Corporal Stuart, whose most prominent scene sees him draped dead cross a horse, which must have pleased many of the people who worked on his films (he was a better director than a diplomat, to put it mildly). While Farrow may not have won any Hollywood popularity contests, it's tempting to think he might have been a better choice to helm this one. It's an entertaining enough bit of formula filmmaking, professionally made, but it lacks the spark to raise it above the routine or linger long in the memory after you've seen it - unless you were Irwin Allen, that is: the basic plot would be reworked and the sets, costumes and Bernard Herrmann's memorable score recycled along with the more spectacular stock footage in The Time Tunnel episode The Night of the Long Knives a decade later.No extras on the Spanish PAL DVD, but a good 2.55:1 widescreen transfer with English or Spanish soundtrack options.",3,Cowboys and Indians on the Khyber Pass,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3835,"['Heard', 'one', 'halfbreed', 'who', 'cavalry', 'fight', 'prejudice', 'comrades', 'fort', 'own', 'people', 'frontier', 'King', 'Khyber', 'Rifles', 'many', 'old', 'standbys', 'cavalry', 'pictures', 'Old', 'West', 'North', 'West', 'Frontier', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'half-caste', 'British', 'army', 'officer', 'who', 'serving', 'hometown', 'runup', 'Indian', 'Mutiny', 'Night', 'Long', 'Knives', 'Based', 'very', 'loosely', 'Talbot', 'Munday', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'remake', 'John', 'Ford', '1929', 'Black', 'Watch', 'not', 'quite', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Sari', 'Rio', 'Ganges', 'more', 'resemblance', 'times', 'Western', 'movie', 'stereotypes', 'much', 'changed', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'only', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'fourth', 'CinemaScope', 'picture', 'times', 'clear', 'all-but', 'forgotten', 'A-list', 'director', 'Henry', 'King', 'Carousel', 'Love', 'Many-Splendored', 'Thing', 'Gunfighter', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'make', 'one', 'early', 'scene', 'groups', 'characters', 'scene', 'right', 'hand', 'side', 'frame', 'remainder', 'simply', 'filled', 'sky', 'were', 'still', 'shooting', 'Academy', 'ratio', 'do', 'get', 'impression', 'studio', 'lavished', 'much', 'money', 'success', 'director-star', 'partnership', 'was', 'King', 'who', 'had', 'directed', 'Power', 'star-making', 'role', 'Lloyds', 'London', 'went', 'make', 'further', 'ten', 'films', 'pairing', 'day', 'was', 'bigger', 'news', 'box-office', 'John', 'Ford', 'John', 'Wayne', 'thanks', 'pictures', 'Old', 'Chicago', 'Alexander', 'Ragtime', 'Band', 'Jessie', 'James', 'A', 'Yank', 'R.A.F.', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Captain', 'Castille', 'Prince', 'Foxes', 'Untamed', 'Sun', 'Also', 'Even', 'rare', 'occasions', 'films', 'flopped', 'still', 'outgrossed', 'many', 'hit', 'tempting', 'suspect', 'one', 'box-office', 'success', 'was', 'more', 'due', 'novelty', 'CinemaScope', 'Miracle', 'See', 'Glasses', 'stereophonic', 'sound', 'quality', 'film', 'itself.This', 'definitely', 'one', 'lesser', 'efforts', 'thanks', 'rather', 'underdeveloped', 'story', 'was', 'rushed', 'production', 'completed', 'script', 'times', 'film', 'very', 'conspicuously', 'be', 'missing', 'scenes', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'suspect', 'were', 'never', 'even', 'filmed', 'such', 'Power', 'meeting', 'Indian', 'who', 'raised', 'when', 'was', 'orphaned', 'third', 'act', 'may', 'rely', 'bond', 'Power', 'hero', 'native', 'troops', 'film', 'never', 'bothers', 'show', 'how', 'loyalty', 'licks', 'shape', 'romance', 'colonel', 'daughter', 'Terry', 'Moore', 'simply', 'throwing', 'moment', 'well-intentioned', 'father', 'qualms', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'are', 'never', 'resolved', 'there', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'even', 'final', 'battle', 'rather', 'so-so', 'affair', 'promise', 'plentiful', 'close', 'quarters', 'combat', 'can', 'spot', 'curious', 'cameo', 'director', 'John', 'Farrow', 'unbilled', 'bit', 'part', 'Corporal', 'Stuart', 'most', 'prominent', 'scene', 'draped', 'dead', 'cross', 'horse', 'must', 'have', 'pleased', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'films', 'was', 'better', 'director', 'diplomat', 'put', 'mildly', 'Farrow', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'Hollywood', 'popularity', 'contests', 'tempting', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'helm', 'one', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'bit', 'formula', 'filmmaking', 'professionally', 'made', 'spark', 'raise', 'routine', 'linger', 'long', 'memory', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'basic', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'reworked', 'sets', 'costumes', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'memorable', 'score', 'recycled', 'along', 'more', 'spectacular', 'stock', 'footage', 'Time', 'Tunnel', 'episode', 'Night', 'Long', 'decade', 'later.No', 'extras', 'Spanish', 'PAL', 'DVD', 'good', '2.55:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'English', 'Spanish', 'soundtrack', 'options']",King of the Khyber Rifles [Region 2]
