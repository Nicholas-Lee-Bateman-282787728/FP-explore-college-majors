611888,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JM2Y,A Customer,"[0, 1]","Summary:Jesminder 'Jess' Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra) is a in her late teens and has been playing soccer casually all her life.  She loves the game, and most especially, loves David Beckham (he's an English soccer great for those that don't know).  As she's playing in the park one day with some friends, another female soccer player, Juliette 'Jules' Paxton (Keira Knightley), sees her playing and recognizes that she's good.  Jules approaches Jess and invites her to a practice with her competitive team.The team's coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), agrees, Jess is good.  So, Joe invites Jess to play for them.  She excitedly agrees, but then realizes she has to face her parents (Mr. Bhamra - Anupam Kher; Mrs. Bhamra - Shaheen Khan), who she knows won't be to keen of the idea.  And, well, she's right.  Her mother quickly shoots her down, but she goes behind their backs and plays anyway.The playing seems fine, until Jess starts to fall for the coach, Joe, who Jules already liked.  But the coach can't get involved with any of his players while his coaching them, club rules.  So, in a romantic moment, even though they're not supposed to, Jess and Joe are about to kiss when Jules catches them.  This puts Jules and Jess at odds.  Then, Jess's parents find out she is playing soccer and she is doubly in trouble.  Finally, her sister, Pinky (Archie Panjabi), sets her wedding date for the day of Jess's final match, at which there is supposed to be an American scout that might invite her to play in a professional league in America.Through a rather complicated turn of events, Jess is finally able to get away from the wedding, with her father's blessing, to play the second half of the game.  Of course, they win!  And, Jess and Jules work things out.  Afterwards, Jess and Jules are both offered scholarships to play in America.  Of course Jess's mother will have none of it, but her dad, who used to be a great cricket player, comes through for her and says she can do it.My Comments:There are a lot of reasons to like this movie.  Foremost is obviously that it is about soccer (I'm a soccer player; I can say that).  But it isn't really about soccer; it is about a lot of other issues.  And those issues and the treatment of them are really what make this an engaging movie.  There is the idea of old traditions meeting new cultures and cultural ideals.  There is also the idea of young women 'coming of age' in a modern world.  And, there is romance, friendship, and parents realizing that their children can have a better life than they did due to some of the new opportunities in the world. All of these issues are woven into a complex story, but treated fairly (though definitely with a pro-modernist bent).  So, yes, there are a lot of reasons to like this film.There are, however, a couple of reasons not to like it: Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Keira Knightley.  I was absolutely amazed at the performances of Parminder K. Nagra and Anupam Kher, but Jonathan and Keira, nope, nothing happening here. Keira only knew how to overact; she seemed like she would be more at home on a stage than in front of a camera.  Joe, on the other hand, just didn't relay the deep frustrations that were supposed to be haunting his character.  Because there are some good actors and some bad ones, it balances out to be an okay all around movie, but it was disappointing to see brilliant portrayals (Nagra and Kher) brought down by their much less brilliant fellow actors.The story is very good.  As noted above, it is able to incorporate a lot of themes, all of which are treated convincingly and reassuringly.  At the end of the movie you feel like saying, &quot;There is hope for the collision between the two worlds.  It may not be easy, but people can adjust.&quot;  The only problem I might have with the story is that, perhaps, it incorporates too many sub-plots (like Jess and Jules being lesbians; it started out funny, but got old after a while and really wasn't necessary).Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  It takes a lot of poignant issues for today's teenagers in an increasingly multi-cultural world, puts them into a quick-paced but compelling story, and shows how this issue can be worked through and ultimately resolved.  As Billy Elliott wasn't really about ballet, Bend It Like Beckham isn't really about soccer.  But both movies use those settings to present engaging stories that deal with powerful issues.  I highly recommend this film, especially for teenagers or parents who might be dealing with these kinds of issues.",4,Fun movie; not the greatest acting,1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,4546,"['Summary', 'Jesminder', ""'Jess"", 'Bhamra', 'Parminder', 'K.', 'Nagra', 'late', 'teens', 'been', 'playing', 'soccer', 'casually', 'life', 'game', 'most', 'especially', 'David', 'Beckham', 'English', 'soccer', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'playing', 'park', 'one', 'day', 'friends', 'female', 'soccer', 'player', 'Juliette', ""'Jules"", 'Paxton', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'playing', 'good', 'Jules', 'Jess', 'practice', 'competitive', 'team.The', 'team', 'coach', 'Joe', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Jess', 'good', 'So', 'Joe', 'Jess', 'play', 'excitedly', 'then', 'face', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Bhamra', 'Anupam', 'Kher', 'Mrs.', 'Bhamra', 'Shaheen', 'Khan', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'keen', 'idea', 'well', 'right', 'mother', 'quickly', 'shoots', 'down', 'backs', 'anyway.The', 'playing', 'fine', 'Jess', 'fall', 'coach', 'Joe', 'who', 'Jules', 'already', 'liked', 'coach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'involved', 'players', 'coaching', 'club', 'rules', 'So', 'romantic', 'moment', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'Jess', 'Joe', 'are', 'kiss', 'when', 'Jules', 'Jules', 'Jess', 'odds', 'Then', 'Jess', 'parents', 'find', 'playing', 'soccer', 'doubly', 'trouble', 'Finally', 'sister', 'Pinky', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'wedding', 'date', 'day', 'Jess', 'final', 'match', 'supposed', 'be', 'American', 'scout', 'might', 'invite', 'play', 'professional', 'league', 'America.Through', 'rather', 'complicated', 'turn', 'events', 'Jess', 'finally', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'wedding', 'father', 'blessing', 'play', 'second', 'half', 'game', 'course', 'win', 'Jess', 'Jules', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'Afterwards', 'Jess', 'Jules', 'are', 'offered', 'scholarships', 'play', 'America', 'course', 'Jess', 'mother', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'dad', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'great', 'cricket', 'player', 'can', 'do', 'it.My', 'Comments', 'are', 'lot', 'reasons', 'like', 'movie', 'Foremost', 'obviously', 'soccer', ""'m"", 'soccer', 'player', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'really', 'soccer', 'lot', 'other', 'issues', 'issues', 'treatment', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'make', 'engaging', 'movie', 'idea', 'old', 'traditions', 'meeting', 'new', 'cultures', 'cultural', 'ideals', 'also', 'idea', 'young', 'women', ""'coming"", 'age', 'modern', 'world', 'romance', 'friendship', 'parents', 'realizing', 'children', 'can', 'have', 'better', 'life', 'did', 'due', 'new', 'opportunities', 'world', 'issues', 'are', 'woven', 'complex', 'story', 'treated', 'fairly', 'definitely', 'pro-modernist', 'bent', 'So', 'yes', 'are', 'lot', 'reasons', 'like', 'film.There', 'are', 'however', 'couple', 'reasons', 'not', 'like', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazed', 'performances', 'Parminder', 'K.', 'Nagra', 'Anupam', 'Kher', 'Jonathan', 'Keira', 'nope', 'nothing', 'happening', 'here', 'Keira', 'only', 'knew', 'how', 'overact', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'home', 'stage', 'front', 'camera', 'Joe', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'relay', 'deep', 'frustrations', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunting', 'character', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'bad', 'ones', 'out', 'be', 'okay', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointing', 'see', 'brilliant', 'portrayals', 'Nagra', 'Kher', 'brought', 'down', 'much', 'less', 'brilliant', 'fellow', 'actors.The', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'noted', 'able', 'incorporate', 'lot', 'themes', 'are', 'treated', 'convincingly', 'reassuringly', 'end', 'movie', 'feel', 'saying', 'quot', 'hope', 'collision', 'two', 'worlds', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'people', 'can', 'adjust.', 'quot', 'only', 'problem', 'might', 'have', 'story', 'perhaps', 'too', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'Jess', 'Jules', 'being', 'lesbians', 'started', 'out', 'funny', 'got', 'old', 'while', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', '.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'lot', 'poignant', 'issues', 'today', 'teenagers', 'increasingly', 'multi-cultural', 'world', 'quick-paced', 'compelling', 'story', 'how', 'issue', 'can', 'be', 'worked', 'ultimately', 'resolved', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'ballet', 'Bend', 'Beckham', ""n't"", 'really', 'soccer', 'movies', 'use', 'settings', 'present', 'engaging', 'stories', 'deal', 'powerful', 'issues', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'especially', 'teenagers', 'parents', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'dealing', 'kinds', 'issues']",Bend It Like Beckham

One a white European, Jules, and the other an Indian girl, Jess. Jules, already on a soccer team,had a mother who disapproved of playing the sport, she wanted a girly girl, but she didn't let that stop her. Jess had the same problem about her mother's view of the sport and girls playing it. Jess loved soccer and wanted more than anything to be on a team like her idol, David Beckham. She played everyday in the park with her Indian friends, which were men, and when her mother saw her she refused that Jess play anymore with these guys. Being Indian she felt that women should not show skin the way Jess did when she wore short sleeve shirts and shorts and NO man should ever touch a woman unless married. While playing the park Jules saw Jess playing and offered her to come try-out for a team! This was everything Jess had dreamed of, a real girls soccer team! Jess made the team and she kept it from her family. When her family found out of this her sister's marriage was almost cancelled because the Indian other of the groom felt the same way her own mother felt. Jess and her dreams really broke her family's heart and caused a lot of problems within the household. This movie had a pretty predictable ending but I won't spill it!

I've been looking forward to seeing this movie since the moment I first heard of it, and my expections were rather high.  In a situation like this, I'm usually disappointed by the less than stellar results, but Bend It Like Beckham was better than I expected!  It's a brilliant movie with very likable stars, though I suspect Kiera Knightly will be far more popular than Parminder Nagra when it comes to the US market.I won't mention the story here, but it was absolutely wonderful.  While there are reminiscence of My Big Fat Greek Wedding here, it's unfair to compare the two in such a way.  I certainly think that this movie can stand on its own feet without striking the chords with Greek Wedding audiences.  It's also true that's there nothing new here, but everything is told with such refreshing honesty.  As an Asian American who've just gone through a similar experience, it was a little bit odd to watch the story unfold on the screen with such familiarity, though it made me relate to the movie on a deeper than just superficial level.  I can't wait to get this movie for my own collection!There's just a bit here for everyone: sports, romance, cultural barriers, generational clashes and various other themes.  This isn't a perfect movie, but it certainly comes very close.  And while this may sound like the average sports flick, it isn't.

For a long time now, Indian films have been unavailable in the United States, and for the most part, this still holds true. 'Bend it like Beckham' isn't really an example of the Indian invasion the way Monsoon Wedding was. 'Beckham' was made in England, produced in England, and is spoken in English; however, it has a very non-English tone. Ms. Chadha has taken some of her Indian heritage and culture, and has soulfully mixed it with the incredibly overdone sports/romantic comedy cross sell. The result is a movie about soccer (football),... or rather, football (soccer). Not entirely true, it is also a movie about stereotypes, and how stereotypical our stereotype analogies have become. In many ways, stereotypes are boring now. Thankfully, 'Bend it like Beckham' handles some of the more expected heresies with light hearted humor and essentially good-spirited characters that just need to 'get with the times'.Parmindar Nagra plays Jess, the daughter of Sikh parents. Jess feels she can do nothing but dodge all her parents wishes and upbringing and become a soccer player. She becomes friends with lesbo look alike Juliette and falls in love with her Irish coach Joe. As complications arise, Jess must learn to value her parents values, while her parents, in turn, must learn to value hers. Needless to say, the potential romance with a white boy and potential lesbianism with a white girl all add to the situational comedy. There isn't really any new material here, save for the soccer and Indian costuming of the lead characters, but, there is a distinct freshness about the method. Chadha has breathed - not new life - but fun, into an old genre. Only the most jaded viewer will have difficulty enjoying this soccer/Rocky/Monsoon Wedding mish-mash. And if they don't enjoy it, they will at least seen an early glimpse of Parmindar Nagra, who can not only bend it like beckham, but whose down to earth beauty and carefully non-stylized acting puts her in the running for actresses to look out for. Also, as multiculturalism grows and ferrets out the still greater challenges ahead against it, it is nice to see the outakes of such an amazingly multicultural production in Beckham's closing credits.

It's like an Anglo-Indian Cinderella Story, except that Parminder Nagra is about a thousand times more interesting than Hillary Duff.The plot is paper thin, generally along the lines of ""mom and dad forbid daughter from playing soccer; daughter sneaks out and plays anyway and gets caught; mom and dad forbid daughter from playing soccer again; daughter sneaks out again and plays anyway and gets caught again"" and so forth.  The coach's key contribution to the movie is to smoulder, and the ending is ludicrous not only for its deus ex machina quality but for its complete reversal--two star-crossed lovers agree that they can never be together, and three minutes later they're making out in Heathrow airport in front of the whole world.It's a good-hearted movie and it tries really hard, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had seen it first.

611896,A1EQZQ5BY3TXPG,B00005JM2Y,"Amazon Customer ""NoirDame.com""","[9, 11]","A delightful coming of age story with two luminous stars, Parminder Nagra (now starring on ""ER"") and Keira Knightly (most recently in ""Love Actually""), ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is great fun.Nagra plays Jess, the younger daughter of a middle-class Sikh family, who yearns to play soccer (football in England) professionally despite her family's objections. Her best friend Jules (Knightly) is dealing with parallel disapproval - her mother believes that an athletic tomboy is destined to be lonely, lesbian or both.While the central story of the girls' friendship, and their mutual passion for soccer (as well as their soccer coach) is immensely likeable, the ""smaller bits"" and characterizations are classic. Jess' sister howls and carries on about her impending wedding, and her mother badgers her about the right way to cook - but there's no question that Jess loves them anyways. Jules' mother, who is full of silliness, constantly attempts to understand her daughter and fails miserably, but never stops trying. Joe, the Irish coach and love interest, is inspirational to both girls but obviously wounded by his past relationship with his Da'.Many films feature a misunderstood but plucky lad or lass, who finally achieves success and shows their families, friends, and often the world, that they were right, and everyone else was wrong.Yes, it's a very old plot.But in your typical film about first generation families like Jess', the older generation is painted as being out of touch with their dreams, having sacrificed their ambitions, as well as their homeland, for their children. There's something bittersweet then, if the child turns their back on their home culture and family to get success in the wider world: this sadness is evident in ""Double Happiness"" and ""Floating Life,"" two other films about Asian immigrants, in Canada and around the world respectively.There's some gentle poking-fun at both mainstream English and immigrant Sikh culture, but ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is more realistic in that Jess doesn't really want to leave her home culture behind - she wants to live in both worlds, English and Sikh.In one scene, her teammates pepper her with questions about her sister's arranged marriage, and later plans for her. Jess makes it clear that, while she's willing to go against her parents' wishes to play football, she agrees with their views on love and sex.She even talks (in a non-cheesy way) about her talent for soccer as being a gift from God, knowing that this is something her parents can understand, as religious people. One more reason why this is a great movie for parents to watch and discuss with their teenagers, whatever their background - it shows that parents and kids can compromise without sacrificing common values and dreams.Kids and adults alike will also love the fast-paced, upbeat soundtrack, including the jaunty song ""Independence Day,"" from tomboy-made-good Melanie C, formerly known as Sporty Spice.

Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra spar off one another brilliantly and create such cheekily likable characters in Juliet and Jess.  The film centers around a young Indian girl born in England.  She dreams of being a soccer player like David Beckham, a man she worships.  Her family is vocally opposed, forbidding her to play.  They want her to marry a nice Indian man and continue in the ways of their family traditions.  Much like many other films dealing with this concept, Jess will lie and hide her `real life' (here by joining the female soccer team and falling into a love triangle between her, Juliet and their coach, Joe) from her folks until it all comes spilling out and her family is forced to accept that change is necessary in order to `keep' their daughter.

But, this movie was worth all of the accolades and more.The movie is a mature (i.e., intelligent, not sexual) coming of age story of an Indian girl raised in modern English culture.  The Indian traditions, of course, conflict with the European ideas, but I didn't get the feeling that the film makers were mocking Indian customs.  The girls of the family are bicultural and there were many scenes of the sisters comfortably transferring from one culture to another.It is not a film, therefore, to denigrate one culture or the other.  The point was to show that there are differences, but a person can transcend the differences as was done by basically every character in the film.  The only clownish character was the mother of the English girl who was the best friend of the Indian lead character.That said, let me also say that the film was often hilarious, never sermonizing, and I learned many things about the Indian culture.  My Indian friends were also pleased with the film and laughed at the scenes of the culture clashes.

You like the characters, they have some problems, but everything works out the way you want it to in the end. Further, it's an inspirational story for any young woman who plays a sport. My daughter, who has gotten onto her school's volleyball team this year, liked it a lot. The movie also has something to say about the clash of divergent ethnic groups and about traditional versus contemporary gender roles. Beyond all of that, the script contains plenty of humor and the players handle their roles well. It's very reminisent of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. Take that film, move it to Britain and change it to MY BIG FAT INDIAN WEDDING and you've got the picture.With all of that going for it, though, BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is not &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;flawless&quot;. It's a nice flick. Nice, but very predictable. The script is clever, but the plot holds no surprises and there's not really a lot of tension. In the end, everyone emerges happy and essentially unscathed. Additionally, for non-British viewers, the dialogue is sometimes a little hard to follow.I like this movie and I think most people will find it entertaining, but it's hardly a cinematic classic. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect too much. I'm a bit surprised at how some people gush over it.

Despite her parents wishes she joins a girls team at the insistence of her new friend Juliet (Keira Knightley). Determined to break free from the cultural expectations placed on her by her family, Jess now has the opportunity to prove how good a player she is and realize her dream. The possibilities are endless for those who dare to reach for the stars. As her relationship with her coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) deepens she may have found even more than she had initially anticipated.Critique: While `Bend It Like Beckham' will appeal primarily to a female audience I think it's something that can be enjoyed by all if given a chance.

While there are references to some of the intricacies of the game of soccer as well as the double standards still imposed on girls in today fs society, the heart of the matter is integration. While some may be surprised that the UK is a melting pot of races & cultures, Bend it Like Beckham (BIB), simultaneously portrays the issues faced by a middle class Sikh family attempting to retain the tenants of their culture in the face of increasing British influence and a young woman's battle to balance her own aspirations with those of her overbearing family.The story revolves around Jess (Parminder K. Nagra), youngest of two daughters who excels in soccer while to the dismay of her family, mainly her mother, shows no interest in boys, fashion, or cooking. During a pickup game where she as usual, runs circles around the boys, she catches the attention of Jules (Keira Knightly), who is already a star on the local girls f soccer team. Jess is invited to tryout for the team and what follows is a series of deceptions, misunderstandings, and family crises that illustrates the tenuous balance between integration, growing up, and individualism.Both Nagra and Knightly do a standup job especially Nagra who delivers a spot-on performance. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers provides a less than enthusiastic performance as the team's coach and both Jess and Jules' love interest. Comic relief is provided by the respective mothers of both the girls: one is having nightmares of her daughter being a lesbian, the other of her daughter showing her legs in public and bringing shame on her family. In particular, Jess fmother's laments are hilarious and show the effective parental use of guilt & shame.In addition to soccer, there are references to homosexuality and racism that are not forced but nicely woven into the theme and add a hint of realism to the proceedings. It also provides an interesting peek on Sikh communities where social status and materialism seem to play such strong roles. Talk about image and keeping up with Joneses! However, it really is a story on how the fence is straddled between Sikh & UK and family & individual.Its not Zadie Smith's White Teeth but it does an effective and more importantly, an entertaining job of showing what life is like inside a melting pot, this time one that is simmering with delicious Aloo Gobi.

Without saying to much I can tell you that Bend it Like Beckham is an ambitious film that attempts to bring many genres of typical American films together, and it succeeds in a way that I think most American films fail.  It is part romance, part sports film, part cultural commentary, part commedy, part foreign film (generically speaking and notwithstanding its being British), part feel-good movie, and perhaps even part existential film.

I can't believe I almost robbed myself of the pleasure of seeing ""Bend it Like Beckham"", quite honestly my favorite movie to come out this year so far. It has action, romance, comedy, drama, lots of color and music and in the end a great message about acceptance and following your dreams. What more could you want?Parminder Nagra stars as Jess, a Londoner of Indian descent who has loved playing soccer (or football, to the rest of the world) all her life. She lives and breathes her sport, so much so that every night she tells all her hopes and dreams to a giant poster of British soccer phenom David Beckham that hangs above her bead. Her parents, though, are less than approving, and when Jess uncovers a female soccer team that is willing to let her play in ""real matches"" she must weigh fulfilling her dreams against tearing her family apart. There is also the matter of her gorgeous Irish coach (Jonathan Rhys-Myers) and her new best friend (Keira Knightly); two girls and one cute guy can sometimes cause problems.The script is more deeply layered than you might expect; I especially liked the interaction between Jess and her parents. Jess' mom is horrified by her daughter's passion because she feels nice Indian girls should be thinking of marriage and not ""running around half naked in front of men"", but her father for a subtler reason; he still remembers when he came to England and was not allowed to play cricket because of his race. He cannot bear the idea of sport breaking Jess' heart too.The supporting cast is uniformly great; with standouts being Juliet Stevenson as the mother of Jess' new friend (""There is a reason Sporty Spice is the only one without a boyfriend!"")  and Jonathan Rhys-Myers as the coach. Rhys-Myers, in fact, spends what screen time he has looking incredibly sexy and practically daring the audience to call him on his Irish accent. Everyone else plays their roles to perfection and a good time is had by all, including the audience. Highly recommended!GRADE: A-",5,"""I'm Irish.

611926,AKHJVOYEX6QME,B00005JM2Y,"Colleen McMahon ""&#34;Omnivorous Reader&#34;""","[14, 15]","I finally saw this after seeing Bride and Prejudice a few weeks ago.  I can see what all the fuss was about, especially since this was a ""small movie"" when released in the US that did well mostly on word of mouth.  Truly I wish I had seen it in the theater.Parminder Nagra was wonderful as Jess, the Indian girl who plays great football (soccer), but all her family cares about is marrying off her sister and getting Jess ready for the same route by teaching her to cook an Indian meal and wear more makeup.  Jess is torn between loyalty to her family, who do genuinely love her and mean well, and her desire to see how far her football talent can take her.Keira Knightly has one of her first ever roles (maybe her first ever role) as the girl who befriends Jess and encourages her to join a women's team.  She shows Jess that their dream of playing women's soccer professionally could come true.While the main storyline is compelling, by itself it would be teh stuff of a Disney or ABC Family network movie.  What really makes the movie wonderful is the time and attention given to so many of the supporting characters--Jess' family aren't simple old-fashioned obstacles to her dream, they have real reasons for wanting to protect her from herself to keep her from getting hurt as they have been in the past.  The actors who play her father and mother are especially good.Another supporting standout is Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who plays the coach Joe.  Every time Jess' playing seems to have hit an immovable obstacle, Joe takes a step that keeps it going.  It's not easy, as Jess points out to him at one point, but her family would never have come around at all without Joe's polite but insistent nudges.Of course there are feel-good football playing sequences, and of course the sister's wedding is a blur of ceremony, dancing and even a pointless fight in a hallway (The director's commentary says she insisted on leaving the scene in because a fight always seems to break out at an Indian wedding and no one is ever sure what it's about).Gurinder Chadha wrote and directed the movie and it's obviously a labor of great love.  She does a wonderful job of capturing the tension of the generation of Asians who have grown up in England with English customs, but still pulled toward the customs of their oftentimes unseen homeland.  I loved the little scenes that showed Jess and her peers navigating between the two worlds, like when she and her sister smoothly shift from talking about boys to giving a traditional greeting to the mother of a friend.And like Bride and Prejudice, this movie has a fabulous soundtrack and is going on my list of CDs I want to get one of these days!Also, on the DVD, don't miss the director's commentary because it adds a lot to many of the little touches in the movie--you'll be able to spot her relatives playing relatives in the wedding scenes, and the many tributes to her deceased father that appear in the movie.Worth watching, and for me, probably worth watching again!",5,Feel-Good Movie!,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3009,"['finally', 'saw', 'seeing', 'Bride', 'Prejudice', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'especially', 'was', 'small', 'movie', 'when', 'released', 'US', 'did', 'well', 'mostly', 'word', 'mouth', 'Truly', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'theater.Parminder', 'Nagra', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Jess', 'Indian', 'girl', 'who', 'great', 'football', 'soccer', 'family', 'cares', 'marrying', 'off', 'sister', 'getting', 'Jess', 'ready', 'same', 'route', 'teaching', 'cook', 'Indian', 'meal', 'wear', 'more', 'makeup', 'Jess', 'torn', 'loyalty', 'family', 'who', 'do', 'genuinely', 'love', 'mean', 'well', 'desire', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'football', 'talent', 'can', 'take', 'her.Keira', 'Knightly', 'one', 'first', 'ever', 'roles', 'maybe', 'first', 'ever', 'role', 'girl', 'who', 'Jess', 'join', 'women', 'team', 'Jess', 'dream', 'playing', 'women', 'soccer', 'professionally', 'could', 'come', 'main', 'storyline', 'compelling', 'would', 'be', 'teh', 'stuff', 'Disney', 'ABC', 'Family', 'network', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'time', 'attention', 'given', 'so', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Jess', 'family', 'are', ""n't"", 'simple', 'old-fashioned', 'obstacles', 'dream', 'have', 'real', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'protect', 'herself', 'keep', 'getting', 'hurt', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'father', 'mother', 'are', 'especially', 'good.Another', 'supporting', 'standout', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'who', 'coach', 'Joe', 'Every', 'time', 'Jess', 'playing', 'have', 'hit', 'immovable', 'obstacle', 'Joe', 'step', 'going', 'not', 'easy', 'Jess', 'out', 'one', 'point', 'family', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'Joe', 'polite', 'insistent', 'nudges.Of', 'course', 'are', 'feel-good', 'football', 'playing', 'sequences', 'course', 'sister', 'wedding', 'blur', 'ceremony', 'dancing', 'even', 'pointless', 'fight', 'hallway', 'director', 'commentary', 'insisted', 'leaving', 'scene', 'fight', 'always', 'break', 'out', 'Indian', 'wedding', 'one', 'ever', 'sure', 'what', '.Gurinder', 'Chadha', 'wrote', 'directed', 'movie', 'obviously', 'labor', 'great', 'love', 'wonderful', 'job', 'capturing', 'tension', 'generation', 'Asians', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'England', 'English', 'customs', 'still', 'pulled', 'customs', 'oftentimes', 'unseen', 'homeland', 'loved', 'little', 'scenes', 'showed', 'Jess', 'peers', 'navigating', 'two', 'worlds', 'when', 'sister', 'smoothly', 'shift', 'talking', 'boys', 'giving', 'traditional', 'greeting', 'mother', 'friend.And', 'Bride', 'Prejudice', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'soundtrack', 'going', 'list', 'CDs', 'want', 'get', 'one', 'days', 'Also', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'director', 'commentary', 'lot', 'many', 'little', 'touches', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'spot', 'relatives', 'playing', 'relatives', 'wedding', 'scenes', 'many', 'tributes', 'deceased', 'father', 'appear', 'movie.Worth', 'watching', 'probably', 'worth', 'watching', 'again']",Bend It Like Beckham

I find its plot refreshing, its performances outstanding and its resolution very satisfying.The storyline combines both traditional movie cliches (girl battles against her conservative family to make it in the modern world) and more unusual features (the customs and traditions that comprise the value system of an Indian Sikh family).Jasminda is the intellectually and athletically gifted daughter of a traditional Indian family who is trying hard to preserve its values in 2003 London. Her older sister Pinky, who also has one foot in both worlds, has become her family's role model for her. Initially rebellious, Pinky has recently entered into a &quot;love engagement&quot; with the cute Indian boy she has been seeing on the side.With her family so preoccupied with her sister's wedding preparations, Jasminda sneaks out on the sly to play with a semi-pro women's team. During this adventure, she encounters the tomboyish Juliet and her drop-dead gorgeous coach. Both of these individuals also have their own family issues-Juliet with her very feminine mother and her coach with his overly motivated father.The movie plays out all these family scenarios. The richest and most rewarding moments come from the Indian family dynamics. This movie lets you peer into an interesting slice of culture-traditional Indians living in 21st century London and trying to balance both worlds.The performances are outstanding. Parminder Negra in the lead role manages a nuanced performance: she wants the world of big time soccer and modern day London but she loves and respects the values of her parents. Keira Knightley as Juliet is astonishing. She is a beautiful girl who could care less about her looks. All she wants to do is lace up her cleats. Juliet Stevenson has her mother is hysterical. Yes, perhaps she is a bit over-the-top, but she gets a laugh every time she shows up in the movie. And the actor who plays the coach manages to balance ethical integrity, athletic passion and drop-dead dreamy male lead in one performance!The DVD has some fun extras. The director's track is entertaining and educational. The &quot;how to cook an Indian meal&quot; is fun. And the deleted scenes are entertaining.I would recommend this movie to lovers of &quot;girl power&quot; movies as well as families who want something fun to watch together.

Jess finds herself torn between honoring her parents' wishes to learn traditional Indian women's skills (such as cooking a traditional Indian meal) and honoring her heart's desire to play football (aka soccer). When her sister becomes engaged to be married, the family pressure increases for Jess to set football aside, at the same time as Jess begins to realize how much she loves playing... and winning... football games! Jess is fortunate to have friends and family who care so much about her, although there are many ups and downs. Adding to the humor and tension of this film are frequent misunderstandings about who's kissing whom, as parents struggle to figure out what's going on and how to get their kids' lives back on track. Fortunately for all of us, the kids are focused on helping one another make their dreams come true.The entire cast in BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is fabulous, and the film is at times hilarious, heart-breaking, sad, and uplifting. I was tremendously touched by Parminder Nagra's acting in the role of Jess, as her every expression conveyed tremendous warmth, intelligence, and inner fire. The other star player on the team is Jules, played by Keira Knightley, and she was every bit as riveting to watch as Parminder.BEND IT is a truly amazing and inspiring movie with a powerfully positive message... that great things can be accomplished when you stick with them and don't give up, and when you've got supportive friends and family.

The film centers around Jess (Parminder Nagra), not Keira Knightly, as she longs to play professional football (soccer).  The only problem is that she is from a traditional Indian family who longs for her to give up her 'pipe dreams' and get married.  They forbid her to play, so what does she do...I mean what can she do but lie.  So with the help of her knew friend Juliet (Knightly) Jess joins an all girls soccer team despite her parents demands.

611933,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005JM2Y,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 2]","Another intercultural drama comes from the UK, so I automatically figured it was going to be a winner,... and I was right.  Like many non-European cultures, the Sikhs expect their daughters to learn how to cook, marry nice Sikh men and raise lots of little Sikhs.  Obedience and respect of elders is expected.  Pinkie, Jessminder's older sister, is following the family tradition by getting engaged to have a big fat Sikh wedding--sorry, I couldn't resist, but the football-minded Jess is torn between trying to please her family's wishes and her own desires.  She often spends her time playing football with some male friends of hers at a park.  In fact, her bedroom wall is covered with pictures of David Beckham, who as most people probably know is the captain of Manchester United and the husband of Victoria, a.k.a. Posh Spice.  Score, 1-0.One day, a white girl, Jules, short for Juliette, sees Jess playing and tells her about the Hounslow Harriers, an all-girl's football team headed by John.  He is impressed with her playing and not only wants her on the team, but is very supportive of her, while at the same time being the disciplinary but fair coach.  He also hopes to make the team impressive enough for an American scout to come recruiting.  Result, Jess continues playing with the team, with Jules and Pinkie covering for her.  The problem for Jess is her parents finding out.  Her passions could disrupt Pinkie's wedding if her prospective inlaws find out anything unconventional about the family.  Also, Jess's father played for the cricket team and encountered prejudice because of his race and just accepted life.  He feels that Jess's life will end the same way, in disappointment.  Jess's mother is more vehement than her husband, even praying to a wall portrait of an ancestor.  Score 2-0.Jules's mother, traditional in a different way, has trouble connecting with her football-loving daughter.  She is fretting because Jules doesn't like to go shopping with her.  At one point, she says to look at Sporty Spice and see why she doesn't have a beau.  Jules's father is different.  He encourages his daughter's passion, giving her emotional support by helping her practice.  What both mothers have in common is that they are out of touch with their daughters and believe in traditional roles.  There's a funny scene when Jules's mother thinks her daughter and Jess are lesbians.  Score 3-0.The soundtrack is a motley collection of disco hits, contemporary techno, and the most exotic of all, bhangra music, i.e. Punjabi dance music.  There's even a Punjabi-language of Jennifer Rush's ""Power Of Love"" that comes on.  The entire cast is marvelous, especially Parminder Nagra as Jess, and Jonathan Rhys-Myers as John.  When she's happy or sad, she is believable and someone one can cheer for or wish things could be better.  And Juliet Stephenson, whom I first saw in The Politician's Wife opposite Minnie Driver and Trevor Eve, does a wonderful turn as Jules's befuddled mother.  Also, the black footballer, Mel, is played by Shaznay Lewis, formerly with the All Saints. Score 4-0.As for the title, it comes from a conversation Jess has with Tony, one of her male football mates and the one who turns out to be the most supportive, who says ""why try to cook when you can bend it like Beckham.""  In other words, we all have our own gifts and passions, and it's the most fulfilling to channel our lives towards that shining path.  And maybe in a more diverse world, it is possible for the younger generation to succeed where their parents didn't.  Final score, 5-0.",5,"And this movie is ..............

611934,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JM2Y,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[8, 9]","Growing up in the UK I was always more interested in rugby than soccer and had to endure FA Cup matches and World Cup action with my family. So, when I heard about BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, it seemed like it was about as far away as a movie could be from something I would like.Little did I know that this engaging comedy is precisely the type of movie that someone who lists SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and NOTTING HILL would enjoy.The story of an Indian girl who breaks with her cultural tradition and goes against her parents wishes to join a girls soccer team is handled with a light personal touch. Also interwoven among the inevitable romance and hijinks of teenage girls discovering themselves is an interesting insight into the Indian culture as transplanted into England in what director Gurinder Chadha calls one of her most personal of movies.Newcomer Parminder Nagra plays Jess, the Indian girl in question , who goes behind her parents backs to join the Hounslow Harriers - a top girls team which lists among its players a spunky tomboy named Jules (played by hot Hollywood actress and rising sex symbol Keira Knightley) who spots Jess's talents after seeing her kick a ball around with her friends at the local park.The two immediately strike up a friendship that is compromised by a mutual attraction to the same man - their coach Joe (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers).Soccer actually plays a relatively minor role in the picture, merely serving as a backdrop on which to paint the story of friendship, tradition, culture and self-discovery. And although the action scenes are well handled, the best parts of the movie are the parental interactions with Jess and Jules and the interactions between the two of them and between Jess and Joe.Engagingly and inifinately watchable with some toe jigging musical tracks the DVD includes a commentary from Chadha, a making of featurette, deleted scenes, featurette on the Indian dish Aloo Gobi which is featured in the movie, music, ottakes and a recipe for Aloo Gobi.

611935,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00005JM2Y,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[10, 11]","I will never understand Soccer. It's probably cause I was born and raised in America. It may also have to do with my proclivity to be bad at sports. But I will give anything a try once. So when the US women's soccer team was in the world cup (I guess that's what it's called) I watched the whole thing and was bored to tears.You see I can understand why people want to play the sport. There is definitely a lot of skill involved. But after three hours of watching chicks run up and down a field, nobody scoring a goal, I was ****ed. When the US team finally won with a kick-off I felt even more cheated. All that skill only to win the game thru dumb luck. Ehhh, I could take it or leave it.All that to say, I still liked BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, a schnazzy import from Great Britian.BECKHAM is the story of Jess (Parminder K. Nagra, King Girl) a beautiful young Indian girl living in or around London. She has aspirations of being a great soccer player, but her Mother (Anupam Kher, Jaal:The Trap) wants her to settle down and marry. When Jess meets Juliette (Keira Knightly, The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl) a young lady who offers her a chance to play with a real soccer team, Jess's life is torn between the culture of her family and the love of the game. Which one wins out? You'll have to watch the film and see.What's nice about a film like this is it gives a glimpse of a London we rarely see in the movies. There is a huge Indian population in the city and it such a fascinating culture. BECKHAM excels in giving us a glimpse into the tradition, and pageantry of this ancient culture without making things too over the top. I'm sure if you look at any culture, or walk of life you will find regular people who do some pretty funny things and BECKHAM showcases the Indian culture with such love and affection, but also with that touch of sweet quirkiness.It also shows us how tradition and religion still survive in our modern world. How cultures that were once separated by miles now live in the house next door. There is a great shot in the film of Jess's family having a celebration. It's loud and boisterous and over the next hedge there's a regular British lady hanging up laundry. It's the kind of shot the say a lot without saying a word.Parminder K. Nagra is phenomenal as Jess. I love how the script is constantly forcing her to up the ante. Pushing her character to grow up. I like how it's full of awkward moments, silly moments, tragic moments, and in the end it's so real. A lesser film would have made this movie about winning the big game. BECKHAM'S stakes are much higher. Do you follow your dreams, or follow your family? Can you do both? While the movie ties these concepts up quite nicely, it only because of Nagra's sweet and yet strong performance that the movie takes on a life of it's own and defies any contrivances.My only qualm with the movie is a pointless and ineffective outing of a minor character. It serves no purpose in the film and in the end stops the film cold. It seemed so unnecessary. It didn't enhance the character any more. It seemed tacked on because in films like these it is necessary to have the token gay guy. But hey it's such a minor flaw that I will stop harping on it.Director Gurinder Chadha has crafted a really sweet, good-natured film. I really liked it a lot and I hate soccer.Hey if I liked BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM I think most people will really like it as well.",5,A Great Movie!,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,3448,"['will', 'never', 'understand', 'Soccer', 'probably', 'cause', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'America', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'do', 'proclivity', 'be', 'bad', 'sports', 'will', 'give', 'anything', 'try', 'once', 'So', 'when', 'US', 'women', 'soccer', 'team', 'was', 'world', 'cup', 'guess', 'what', 'called', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'bored', 'tears.You', 'see', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'want', 'play', 'sport', 'definitely', 'lot', 'skill', 'involved', 'three', 'hours', 'watching', 'chicks', 'run', 'up', 'field', 'nobody', 'scoring', 'goal', 'was', '****ed', 'When', 'US', 'team', 'finally', 'won', 'kick-off', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'cheated', 'only', 'win', 'game', 'thru', 'dumb', 'luck', 'Ehhh', 'could', 'take', 'leave', 'it.All', 'say', 'still', 'liked', 'BEND', 'IT', 'LIKE', 'BECKHAM', 'schnazzy', 'import', 'Great', 'Britian.BECKHAM', 'story', 'Jess', 'Parminder', 'K.', 'Nagra', 'King', 'Girl', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Indian', 'girl', 'living', 'London', 'aspirations', 'being', 'great', 'soccer', 'player', 'Mother', 'Anupam', 'Kher', 'Jaal', 'Trap', 'settle', 'down', 'marry', 'When', 'Jess', 'Juliette', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Curse', 'Black', 'Pearl', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'chance', 'play', 'real', 'soccer', 'team', 'Jess', 'life', 'torn', 'culture', 'family', 'love', 'game', 'Which', 'one', 'out', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'see.What', 'nice', 'film', 'glimpse', 'London', 'rarely', 'see', 'movies', 'huge', 'Indian', 'population', 'city', 'fascinating', 'culture', 'BECKHAM', 'excels', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'tradition', 'pageantry', 'ancient', 'culture', 'making', 'things', 'too', 'top', ""'m"", 'sure', 'look', 'culture', 'walk', 'life', 'will', 'find', 'regular', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'pretty', 'funny', 'things', 'BECKHAM', 'Indian', 'culture', 'such', 'love', 'affection', 'also', 'touch', 'sweet', 'quirkiness.It', 'also', 'how', 'tradition', 'religion', 'still', 'survive', 'modern', 'world', 'How', 'cultures', 'were', 'once', 'separated', 'miles', 'now', 'live', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'great', 'shot', 'film', 'Jess', 'family', 'having', 'celebration', 'loud', 'boisterous', 'next', 'hedge', 'regular', 'British', 'lady', 'hanging', 'up', 'laundry', 'kind', 'shot', 'say', 'lot', 'saying', 'word.Parminder', 'K.', 'Nagra', 'phenomenal', 'Jess', 'love', 'how', 'script', 'constantly', 'forcing', 'up', 'ante', 'Pushing', 'character', 'grow', 'up', 'how', 'full', 'awkward', 'moments', 'silly', 'moments', 'tragic', 'moments', 'end', 'so', 'real', 'lesser', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'winning', 'big', 'game', 'BECKHAM', 'stakes', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'Do', 'follow', 'dreams', 'follow', 'family', 'Can', 'do', 'movie', 'concepts', 'up', 'quite', 'nicely', 'only', 'Nagra', 'sweet', 'yet', 'strong', 'performance', 'movie', 'life', 'own', 'contrivances.My', 'only', 'movie', 'pointless', 'ineffective', 'outing', 'minor', 'character', 'purpose', 'film', 'end', 'film', 'cold', 'seemed', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'did', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'character', 'more', 'seemed', 'tacked', 'films', 'necessary', 'have', 'token', 'gay', 'guy', 'hey', 'such', 'minor', 'flaw', 'will', 'stop', 'harping', 'it.Director', 'Gurinder', 'Chadha', 'crafted', 'really', 'sweet', 'good-natured', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'hate', 'soccer.Hey', 'liked', 'BEND', 'IT', 'LIKE', 'BECKHAM', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'as', 'well']",Bend It Like Beckham

611938,A103KNDW8GN92L,B00005JM2Y,David Hugaert,"[0, 0]","A film that's sure to hit the ground running this spring/summer, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is one feature that's neither hit or miss, but is spot on! Jes (Parminder Nagra) is an Indian teenage girl making inroads as a member of her Hounslow, London-based football (soccer in the U.S.) team. But, her strict parents have other ideas about her future, as they wish for her to pursue a life in the academic world, and that sports plays no part in their worldly culture. Jes' best friend Jules (Keira Knightley) somehow gets caught up in Jes' somewhat misguided adventures - both on the playing field, as well as in both hers and her best friend's family fiascos, and the recipe calls for a delightfully funny movie that never lets up from the get-go! However, there's one small insignificance which may baffle many a viewer - although Jes keeps her football playing activities a secret (in accordance to ""BILB""'s storyline), it is well-known that Jes' parents know about her football activities, thus being strongly against them. Along the way, both Jes and Jules have designs on their coach (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Jes and Jules' friendship is suddenly tested when Jes is seen (by Jules) in a scene featuring a warm and tender moment shared with Coach Joe. Jes' mettle with the rest of her team is tested as well, as both she and Jules are up for an athletic scholarship at an American university. As the big day of the local championship game arrives, Jes must choose between attending her sister's wedding and her huge match, of which she is ordered by her father to attend the former. But, seeing as how important the latter is to his daughter, he decides to let her attend the match, and therefore wants his daughter to be happy, which is only right. Of ""...Beckham""'s funnier moments, one of which features a scene with Jes about to kick the deciding shot, when she envisions her family (instead of the members of both opposing teams) standing in the way, attempting to discredit the goal (this is where she has her sister's wedding on her mind, by the way), is the best and funniest moment in the entire movie! This is just one of ""BILB""' priceless ""snapshots"". Even Juliet Stevenson's performance as Jules's mom would pass as a dead-ringer for Hayley Mills! Everything aside, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" doesn't break (nor bend) when it comes to capturing the perfect essence of a spectacular comedy/drama. So, all that's left to be cleared up is do the girls get their scholarships, and do they get to spend an ""ultimate eve in eternity"" with their coach?

611939,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00005JM2Y,David M. Lovin,"[4, 5]","Bend it like Beckham is a wonderful movie.  A young Indian girl, named Jess, who idolizes Manchester United soccer star David Beckham (the movie is pre-trade to Real Madrid) finds it tough to follow her dream of playing soccer.  Her parents don't understand her desire to play, especially her mother, who only wants her to learn to cook good Indian food.  Jess is very talented at the game, however, and one day she is noticed by a girl who plays on an all girl's team.  The girl, named Julie, convinces her to come out to play for the team.  Soon Jess tries to play the game she loves while trying to keep it from her parents.The story is not particularly original.  In fact, it is rather formulaic.  Contained in this film are elements we have all seen many times before.  Will Jess' parents discover her lies?  Will there be a conflict between the two girls over a guy they both like?(it happens to be the coach of the girl's team)  Will there be a ""big game"" at the end which gives us a happy resolution?  The answer to all these is a yes, yet the film is still great to watch.  The young cast, all unknowns, shines and breathes life into the feature.  You will recognize no one here, except possible Keira Knightley, who is the gorgeous love interest in Pirates of the Carribean.  You won't even recognize her in this film, where she is such a tomboy, that her mother worries about her being a lesbian.  In fact, there are a couple of instances of homosexuality in the film, something you should be prepared to discuss with your kids should you choose to watch the film with them.In short, I liked this film a lot.  It's a fun couple of hours.  This is one of those movies you may go back a few years later and recognize a lot of the cast who were unknown at the time.

611944,A3MYY88NLEJ8Y3,B00005JM2Y,Diane Moore,"[0, 0]","I think that it's great when movies like this get out into the mainstream land of movies. Yes, it has some stereotypes (Jules mom thinks that her daughter is a lesbian because she and her friend kissed after the football game) There are a few ""Three's Company"" mishaps (and I have nothing against Three's Company!) People comment that this is like My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Monsoon Wedding, but it happens that they also have a wedding in this movie, and like some other cultures, it is a very big affair.Jesminder (Jess) is a big football (soccer to us) lover, and especially loves David Beckham. (who I didn't know before this movie, but is an English football star) She would love to play football professionally, instead of being a ""solicitor,"" but only plays in the park, without her parents knowledge of it. Her mom would like her to become a ""normal"" Indian woman, like to learn how to cook Aloo Gobi and marry a proper Indian man.Jules, who plays football herself, sees Jess playing in the park, and invites her to try out for the women's team, who is coached by a good looking Irish man, Joe. Jules and and Jess seem to both fancy Joe, but he is not allowed to cross the lines of dating his football players.While all of this is going on, Jess's sister Pinky is getting married to a man she really loves. They are allowed to pick their own husbands, and the wedding is coming up. A really good line that sums Jess up to a tee is when Pinky asks Jess in the car is, ""Don't you want this?"" Jess follows up with, ""Don't you want more than this?"" She has a dream that she will do anything to make it come true, whether it is pretending to get a summer job so she can play the sport, or having her sister cover for her so she can go to a game in Germany.This is not just a ""boy meets girl"" story.

611946,AVCRD98TH48RN,B00005JM2Y,D. Knouse,"[4, 4]","It's been a long time since I could say that I thought a film was at all original or new.  While the story is fairly universal, having a mixture of East Indian culture and English/Irish culture together in a girl's soccer movie is a very unusual and altogether delightful brew.  All the characters are very human, with zero melodrama, all the right emotions are conveyed with honesty and talent.  So, why not 5 stars?  Well, sometimes the soccer play looks choreographed and not entirely realistic.  None of the players seem to sweat very much during the games, or look at all physically exhausted.  The camera angles and sweeping steady-cam shots are interesting and vibrant during those sequences, however, lending a real time perspective(you feel like you are on the field).  But the soccer is not the heart of the film.  The heart of the film is in the form of a friendship between two girls who play together and, unfortunately, both fall in love with the same man.  Friction, indeed!  The only other minor negative in the film is with the tidy ending.  All the loose ends are accounted for, whether realistic or not, creating a complete story wrapped in gold paper and tied up with a pretty red bow.  It was also wonderful to encounter such a talented, new, and gorgeous young actress named Parminder Nagra.  She absolutely glows in this film.  Keira Knightly, of more recent ""Pirates of the Carribean"" fame, makes her debut here, as well.  They have great chemistry together.  For that matter, the entire cast is exceptional...and often very, very funny.  This is a light-hearted film with good writing and an original story.  All in all, this is a very entertaining film.

For starters, it is laugh-out-loud funny, and definitely holds your attention.  I think it was really geared at young teenagers and pre-teens, but I saw it with my mother, and I was twenty years old at the time and we still had fun.  Jess (Parminder Nagra) just wants to play soccer, but her traditional, Indian parents won't hear of it.  They want her to go to college, become a lawyer and be a good Indian wife--let's not forget the cooking lessons her mom wants to subject her to, so she can cook all the curries, breads and assorted fried pastries.  The young Indian-English girl won't hear of it, and while her sister is preparing for her own wedding, the headstrong girl continues to sneak out and play soccer with the guys.  Another young lady (Keira Knightley) sees her playing, and invites her to join a girl's team.  They both proceed to develop crushes on the coach (Jonathan Rhys Myers), and then things get a little complicated......to say the least....also, the whole soccer matter can't be kept under wraps forever.Even though I was never any good at soccer, and don't know much about the game (though, I knew who David Beckham was and that he played for Manchester United at the time that the film came out.......there is even a scene with Jess watching David--or, as her mom likes to call him, &quot;That skinhead boy,&quot; play his &quot;corner&quot;), I had great fun watching Jess triumph in game after game, and enjoyed the Indian flavor that generously sprinkled out this film like fine haldi (tumeric, for those who know it by its Western name) in a savory and spicy curry, meant to be enjoyed with friends and loved ones.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[9, 11]","Gurinder Chadha, director of ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" has struck the same chord in audiences that made ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" such a smash hit.  She describes the clash of cultures that may prevent a British teenager of Indian descent from following her dream of becoming a soccer star.  Jesminder Bhamra, known as Jess, worships the British soccer phenom, David Beckham.  Jess herself is a natural athlete who has all the right moves and great athletic potential.  However, she also has two traditional Sikh parents who want her to marry and attend university.  Jess's parents are horrified when they discover that their daughter is sneaking out behind their backs to play soccer.""Bend It Like Beckham"" succeeds mainly because of the charming and ebullient performances of its two young stars, Parminder K. Nagra as Jess and Keira Knightley, as Juliette, a beautiful blonde who recruits Jess to play on a woman's soccer team.  The supporting performances are all fine, with special kudos going to Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan as Jess's parents.The plot is a takeoff on the Rocky formula.  Can Jess buck her traditional parents and the expectations of what is proper to become a professional soccer player?  Will her ambition bring scandal to her family and put a monkey wrench into her sister's wedding plans?  All of this is played with a light comic touch that is pleasant and entertaining.

611953,AH0K6KAO3N1RH,B00005JM2Y,E. Dolnack,"[5, 6]","What a unique and pleasant little movie. This film is just fun. I highly enjoyed this personal little movie. You can tell that this was a real labor of love for director Gurinder Chadha. She really put her heart into this film and it's apparent. It's rare to see such a warm and individualistic movie today.As an American, I found the ""Britishness"" of this movie to be a treat. It added to the style of the film for me. The actors, the language, the locales, and even the style of humor is wonderfully British rather than formulaic American/Hollywood of today and I found that refreshing.I also enjoyed the delightful and intimate portrayal of Hindu society in this film. There is no stereotyping involved, but a realistic portrayal of Indian culture surrounded by and existing within a white English majority. As being of Indian decent herself, director Gurinder Chadha has obviously put herself and her own life experiences into so many aspects of this movie that it couldn't possibly be anything less than authentic.The element of soccer (""football"" as they say in Europe) was the third ingredient into this mix that completely worked for me. As an American, we've seen one triumphant baseball, American football, and basketball movie after another, but this is probably the first movie I know of that centers losely around the sport of soccer. David Beckham is not quite a household word in the States as say Dion Sanders or Michael Jordan is here. I suppose if this movie would have been made in the US, it would have been about two teenage girls who play softball or high school basketball and it might have been titled ""Curve it Like Clemens"", ""Dunk it Like Shaq"", ""Hit it Like Bonds"", or ""Drive it Like Woods"".As it is, this warm and touching movie keeps things light and on a wonderfully ""European"" tone throughout. It reminded me very much of another wonderful English comedy of recent times, ""Brassed Off"" starring Ewan McGregor.Very charming and unique film.

She is fighting against prejudice because her own people do not want to see a girl showing her legs all over the television, a country where girls do not have the opportunities to shine if they excel in her sport, and her own demons because she fears rejection.Enter a new English friend Juliet, superbly played by Keira Knightley, who scouts for her soccer team and is impressed about the ability of Jess when she sees her play at the park, competing and winning while surrounded by boys. Juliet approaches Jess and encourages her to join the girls team, and Jess accepts but secretly joins because she fears her family finding out and not permitting her to follow her dreams.The male coach, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, becomes the agent of change that opens Jess to no longer fear rejection, to overcome her personal fear of showing disfigurement in public, and the trigger for Jess to open her heart to welcome real change and that is becoming part of another cultural set of values.This story is much like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" a genuine story of the struggle individuals go through as they open their hearts to understanding others with different and sometimes, clashing values, morals, and religious beliefs. This movie is a jewel and if you have teenagers around questioning their lives, this film provides a fun way to realize that we need to understand who we are, work hard at what we want, and follow our dreams, regardless of the barriers we encounter.Don't miss it!!!",5,"A jewel of a comedy, don't miss it!",1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,2145,"['rare', 'film', 'funny', 'filled', 'action', 'revealing', 'struggle', 'cultures', 'attempting', 'evolve', 'foreign', 'country', 'yet', 'fighting', 'keep', 'set', 'values', 'make', 'unique.Bend', 'Beckham', 'superb', 'comedy', 'lives', 'Indian', 'family', 'raising', 'two', 'daughters', 'one', 'following', 'values', 'culture', 'considering', 'marriage', 'family', 'are', 'keys', 'happiness', 'other', 'open', 'hungers', 'change', 'status', 'quo.Jess', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Parminder', 'Nagra', 'Indian', 'girl', 'born', 'England', 'who', 'father', 'great', 'athletic', 'aptitude', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'soccer', 'player', 'fighting', 'prejudice', 'own', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'girl', 'showing', 'legs', 'television', 'country', 'where', 'girls', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'opportunities', 'shine', 'excel', 'sport', 'own', 'demons', 'rejection.Enter', 'new', 'English', 'friend', 'Juliet', 'superbly', 'played', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'soccer', 'team', 'impressed', 'ability', 'Jess', 'when', 'play', 'park', 'competing', 'winning', 'surrounded', 'boys', 'Juliet', 'approaches', 'Jess', 'join', 'girls', 'team', 'Jess', 'accepts', 'secretly', 'family', 'finding', 'out', 'not', 'permitting', 'follow', 'dreams.The', 'male', 'coach', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'agent', 'change', 'Jess', 'no', 'longer', 'fear', 'rejection', 'overcome', 'personal', 'fear', 'showing', 'disfigurement', 'public', 'trigger', 'Jess', 'open', 'heart', 'welcome', 'real', 'change', 'becoming', 'part', 'cultural', 'set', 'values.This', 'story', 'much', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'genuine', 'story', 'struggle', 'individuals', 'go', 'open', 'hearts', 'understanding', 'others', 'different', 'sometimes', 'clashing', 'values', 'morals', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'movie', 'jewel', 'have', 'teenagers', 'questioning', 'lives', 'film', 'fun', 'way', 'realize', 'need', 'understand', 'who', 'are', 'work', 'hard', 'what', 'want', 'follow', 'dreams', 'regardless', 'barriers', 'encounter.Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",Bend It Like Beckham

This message is  amply and reliably illustrated in the film through the stories of Jess, Jules and Joe. Jess and Jules (the two girls) face their families' opposition to their wish to play football. It is interesting that the director has chosen two British girls of different cultural backgrounds (Jess's family is of sikh Indian origin, while jules's is white anglo)to show the opposition that they face is not a cultural issue, but a gender issue: to play football is not considered ""femimine"" and so, the girls will scare away potential husbands; and at least for these two different cultures -as well as many others- a woman without husband is an unhappy unsuccesful woman. On the other hand Joe, the boy, has broken his relations with his family and stopped talking to them, because of a problem also concerning football. But breaking with their family is something the girls -especially Jess- do not even consider doing. And we have a very good time seeing how Jess tries to ""bend"" her family's opposition -a charming family, with a father and mother reminiscent of Tevye and Golde of The Fiddler on the Roof-throughout the whole film. For the director the term ""bend"" is a metaphore: the character tries to do with the obstacles as Beckham does with the ball, that is, to curve around them or above them without ever clashing.

The reason I feel this movie is superior to most movies made by Indian directors is because most movies made in the Bollywood film industry are very unrealistic. As an example - they have people break into song and dance sequences from Switzerland to New York when the story is suppose to be set in India. Indian directors who try to be ""alternative"" and make their story in America also go overboard and make the minority who is growing up in America seem over westernized. By that, I mean that all the protagonist will do is smoke, drink and chase boys or girls.  And, of course in American movies, Indians are only shown as the liquor store owner/taxi driver.This movie decided to forgo the clich&eacute; and have a simple and very believable boy meets girl story. The race difference is not covered up nor is it used in a demeaning way for anyone. Having ultra-conservative parents myself, I felt as if Jasminder's parents were my parents. This movie is very easy to relate to. The sound track is also very nice - with classic Hindi and Punjabi music and some new English releases.Jess is played by Parminder Nagra who is also on ER, Anupam Kher is an Indian actor who must have been in at least 100 Hindi films, and Keira Knightley (who was virtually unknown when this movie first came out) is pretty famous now and has starred in Love Actually, King Arthur, and Pirates of the Caribbean.If you want to see a great, funny, heartwarming movie without violence & sex that actually shows Indians in a realistic way, this is a good one!",5,Leaves you with a happy feeling...,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1621,"['Ok', ""'m"", 'fan', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'one', 'reason', 'feel', 'movie', 'superior', 'most', 'movies', 'made', 'Indian', 'directors', 'most', 'movies', 'made', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'industry', 'are', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'example', 'have', 'people', 'break', 'song', 'dance', 'sequences', 'Switzerland', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'story', 'suppose', 'be', 'set', 'India', 'Indian', 'directors', 'who', 'try', 'be', 'alternative', 'make', 'story', 'America', 'also', 'go', 'overboard', 'make', 'minority', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'America', 'seem', 'westernized', 'mean', 'protagonist', 'will', 'do', 'smoke', 'drink', 'chase', 'boys', 'girls', 'course', 'American', 'movies', 'Indians', 'are', 'only', 'shown', 'liquor', 'store', 'driver.This', 'movie', 'decided', 'forgo', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'simple', 'very', 'believable', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'story', 'race', 'difference', 'not', 'covered', 'up', 'used', 'demeaning', 'way', 'anyone', 'Having', 'ultra-conservative', 'parents', 'felt', 'Jasminder', 'parents', 'were', 'parents', 'movie', 'very', 'easy', 'relate', 'sound', 'track', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'classic', 'Hindi', 'Punjabi', 'music', 'new', 'English', 'releases.Jess', 'played', 'Parminder', 'Nagra', 'who', 'also', 'ER', 'Anupam', 'Kher', 'Indian', 'actor', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'least', '100', 'Hindi', 'films', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'was', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'pretty', 'famous', 'now', 'starred', 'Love', 'Actually', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean.If', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'violence', 'sex', 'actually', 'Indians', 'realistic', 'way', 'good', 'one']",Bend It Like Beckham

While playing football in the park with her guy friends, Jess is approached by Juliet, a caucasian girl who plays for a girl's team and thinks Jess would be a good addition. This sets up the familiar plot where young child tries to follow her dream, gets in trouble with the parents, before a successful conclusion of all the plot threads.Although there's nothing new in the plot of this story, it's the ethnographic details and the extreme likability of the actors that makes this film a joy to watch. Aside from the obvious gender-switching (girl playing sports), the setting (London) and the family (traditional Indian), there's a number of small touches that raise the movie above what could have been simplistic Disney fare, such as Juliet and her not-quite-similar situation where her father supports her while her mother doesn't and the young Irish male coach with another dissimilar home situation in which the father supported him too much. It's as if you get a cross-section of the possibilities of parent-child relationship, to compare and contrast and realize that for all their differences, it still comes down to the need for the child to make his or her own way in the world.Like another ethnic take on a traditional theme, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Bend It Like Beckham succeeds because it reveals that while the food, dress, or customs may be different, parents are parents and children are children.

The main character is a young London teenage girl, nicknamed Jess (short for Jasminder), and born of immigrant Indian parents, who dreams of playing profesionally in a British girl's soccer team. She initially hides from her parents her practices with with a local team until her father accidentally stumbles on a TV sports report of the team in a visiting match in Germany. Not only does Jess face the horror and reprobation of her parents, but she alienates her team mate and friend (played by Keira Keagan) who shares her infatuation with the Irish coach, an earnest lad troubled by his own estrangement from his father. When the coach tries to persuade Jess' father to allow her to try for a soccer scholarship to the United States, he dicovers of how his own Irish experience of exclusion is mirrored by the experience of an Indian man who arrives in England from Uganda hoping to play cricket.The characters muddle through all kind of misunderstandings, including Jess and her teamate's parents belief that the two girls are having a lesbian relationship.

Chadka has elected to use neophytes as actors for the young girls (Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightly) and adds to this mix the talents of veteran performer Juliet Stevenson and the always reliable Jonathan Rhys Meyers, finding just the right combination of fresh youthfulness and experienced adults that makes this movie about life's clashes ring.

Not only do we have the obligatory love triangle, a clash of cultural norms, but Jess just can't do anything ""wrong"" without being found out, somebody always shows up to notice, report on her etc.I am sympathetic to movies where the main character realizes his/her dreams against all odds. In this case, the younger daughter of a not too wealthy Indian family, Jess (Parminder Nagra) has her heart set on football and plays with her Indian friends in the park whenever she can (all half naked men, of course). When Juliet (Keira Knightley), a young woman who plays in a girl's team notices her invites to try out, Jess's life becomes a bunch of lies, all in good fun, of course. Her family strongly disapproves, so Jess follows her heart and her sister covers for her.Jess's mother is perhaps the funniest character of the entire movie, what with her mannerism, determination to put a stop to this foolishness and delightful non-sequiturs (""I don't want you to be like your niece, running around, showing her legs."" ""She's a fashion designer, mom"" ""Divorced, that's what she is. She got married to the gora boy with blue hair, and that's what happens..."" or something like this, you'll have to see :) The dialogue is not always easy to catch for outsiders, but still enjoyable.Interestingly, Jess's and Juliet's mothers have similar fears about their daughters being corrupted by soccer and inability to act like a proper woman. Jess' mom is afraid of the influence of men, especially white guys, while Juliet's mom is concerned that her daugher has turned into a lesbian - both form the basis for a number of jokes.The soccer team is coached by a young white man, the subject of both Juliet's and later Jess's affection.

While ""Bend It Like Beckham"" has a lot of familiar elements, it presents them with a fresh perspective.Newcomer Parminder K. Nagra (soon to be a regular on the series, ""ER"") is very appealing in the lead role of Jess. She's a young woman that has a passion for football (what we call ""soccer"" in the States). This doesn't sit well with her very traditional Sikh parents. They only want her to cook and be the wife of a nice Indian boy. We've heard this story before and with a more Westernized family, this would seem hopelessly dated. However, given Jess's background, this is totally believeable.Despite the hype about co-star Keira Knightley (""Pirates of the Caribbean""), Nagra is the real star of the movie. However, this is not to discount Knightley's obvious charm. Perhaps for some, it may be easier to identify with her Jules over Nagra's Jess, but that is only because people are not looking beyond the surface details. Anybody who has ever shared a difference of opinion with their parents, will connect with Jess's situation. Knightley and Nagra are both very attractive on screen and have great chemistry together. Anupam Kher as Jess's father is another standout in the cast. He keeps the right balance of firmness and sensitivity in his role.The film reminds me somewhat of the award-winning ""Far From Heaven"" because on the surface the film looks and feels familiar, but it incorporates elements that you usually wouldn't find in the earlier films that it resembles.This is a good film for families with teenagers. It might be a little much for younger children. However, parents should definitely be prepared to discuss the film afterward with their children.""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a film that supports multi-culturalism without being heavy handed or preachy. The film is generally upbeat, but doesn't dodge important issues regarding tradition and conflicts between child and parents. Importantly, the film never plays like an ""afterschool special"" insists on always being ""politically correct."" It deals with its material in an honest way, but never forgets that the number one role of the film is to entertain.If you're tired of generic Hollywood teen films that look down on their audience, you'll really appreciate this film. It's an unabashedly ""feel good movie,"" but with substance. While not perfect, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" will leave you wondering why you didn't seek this film out sooner.",4,Fresh Film For Families with Teenagers,1060300800,"08 8, 2003",2003,2532,"['Most', 'films', 'are', 'way', 'geared', 'family', 'audience', 'are', 'often', 'hopelessly', 'unimaginative', 'predictable', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'lot', 'familiar', 'elements', 'fresh', 'perspective.Newcomer', 'Parminder', 'K.', 'Nagra', 'soon', 'be', 'regular', 'series', 'ER', 'very', 'appealing', 'lead', 'role', 'Jess', 'young', 'woman', 'passion', 'football', 'what', 'call', 'soccer', 'States', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'very', 'traditional', 'Sikh', 'parents', 'only', 'want', 'cook', 'be', 'wife', 'nice', 'Indian', 'boy', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'story', 'more', 'Westernized', 'family', 'would', 'seem', 'hopelessly', 'dated', 'However', 'given', 'Jess', 'background', 'totally', 'believeable.Despite', 'hype', 'co-star', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Nagra', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'However', 'not', 'discount', 'Knightley', 'obvious', 'charm', 'Perhaps', 'may', 'be', 'easier', 'identify', 'Jules', 'Nagra', 'Jess', 'only', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'surface', 'details', 'Anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'shared', 'difference', 'opinion', 'parents', 'will', 'connect', 'Jess', 'situation', 'Knightley', 'Nagra', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'screen', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Anupam', 'Kher', 'Jess', 'father', 'standout', 'cast', 'right', 'balance', 'firmness', 'sensitivity', 'role.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'award-winning', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'surface', 'film', 'looks', 'feels', 'familiar', 'elements', 'usually', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'earlier', 'films', 'good', 'film', 'families', 'teenagers', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'much', 'younger', 'children', 'However', 'parents', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'prepared', 'discuss', 'film', 'afterward', 'children', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'film', 'multi-culturalism', 'being', 'heavy', 'handed', 'preachy', 'film', 'generally', 'upbeat', ""n't"", 'dodge', 'important', 'issues', 'regarding', 'tradition', 'conflicts', 'child', 'parents', 'Importantly', 'film', 'never', 'afterschool', 'special', 'insists', 'always', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', 'material', 'honest', 'way', 'never', 'forgets', 'number', 'one', 'role', 'film', 'entertain.If', ""'re"", 'tired', 'generic', 'Hollywood', 'teen', 'films', 'look', 'down', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'really', 'appreciate', 'film', 'unabashedly', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'substance', 'not', 'perfect', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'seek', 'film', 'out', 'sooner']",Bend It Like Beckham

The best part of any DVD package are the extras, and there are three. One is a featurette on the making of the movie that's charming. One is a short featurette showing the director and her mom and aunt making Aloo Gobi. The high point is, of course, the audio commentary, and here the director and her non-Indian husband add their unique and interesting perspective. The viewer can see the movie again through a different pair of eyes, which is why it's a darn shame closed captioning doesn't pick up their comments. As for the movie itself, everyone's pretty much given away the story, so I won't. Anyone reading my reviews on a regular basis knows I love coming-of-age movies.  I've seen some of the best, and I think this movie ranks right up there with them. Even though older kids are involved in this one, I found the movie very charming. It  features a culture clash on several levels: traditonal and modern, British and Asian, even young and older. But what prevails in the end is the love a family has for one another.

611977,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JM2Y,Jason,"[0, 0]","Bend It Like Beckham is a story about strength, overcoming odds, and reaching for difficult goals.  It centers around two soccer (football) players, Jess (Parminder Nagra) and Jules (Keira Knightly), who face family resistance and cultural pressure while trying to acheive their dreams on the field of play.Jules sees Jess playing soccer in the park on day and instantly realizes a diamond in the rough who could help take her team over the top.  Unffortunately, Jess' parents are very strict and old-fashioned, and their Indian culture frowns upon a young lady playing sports competitively - they want a daughter who's looking towards building a family and learning to cook.  One of the interesting parts of this movie is the cultural immersion one experiences seeing the various traditions involved in an Indian girl's wedding, and the paranoid way in which Jess' mother attempts to prove their family's worthiness.A love triangle ensues between the two and their coach - whose androgynous mannerisms completely betray the premise, and the tension of life, love, and competition endanger everyone's dreams.  It could affect Jess' sister's wedding, Jules' mother's sanity, and both girl's future.The one down-side to this movie is the laughably horrible sports scenes.  The footwork on all goals, the slow-as-a-sloth goalies, the complete lack of defense, and the slow-motion ""action"" scenes take away from the realism of the movie, causing a viewer to seriously question if belief can be suspended enough to truly believe any of what is transpiring.Despite that, the girls and their families learn to overcome differences and cultural barriers while on their way to athletic triumph.  It's a worthwhile watch, and probably a great chick-flick/sports combo for couples to watch.",4,"All I'm saying is, there's a reason why Sporty Spice is the only one without a fella!",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,1779,"['Bend', 'Beckham', 'story', 'strength', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'reaching', 'difficult', 'goals', 'two', 'soccer', 'football', 'players', 'Jess', 'Parminder', 'Nagra', 'Jules', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'who', 'face', 'family', 'resistance', 'cultural', 'pressure', 'trying', 'acheive', 'dreams', 'field', 'play.Jules', 'sees', 'Jess', 'playing', 'soccer', 'park', 'day', 'instantly', 'diamond', 'rough', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'take', 'team', 'top', 'Unffortunately', 'Jess', 'parents', 'are', 'very', 'strict', 'old-fashioned', 'Indian', 'culture', 'frowns', 'young', 'lady', 'playing', 'sports', 'competitively', 'want', 'daughter', 'who', 'looking', 'towards', 'building', 'family', 'learning', 'cook', 'One', 'interesting', 'parts', 'movie', 'cultural', 'immersion', 'one', 'seeing', 'various', 'traditions', 'involved', 'Indian', 'girl', 'wedding', 'paranoid', 'way', 'Jess', 'mother', 'attempts', 'prove', 'family', 'worthiness.A', 'love', 'triangle', 'ensues', 'two', 'coach', 'androgynous', 'mannerisms', 'completely', 'premise', 'tension', 'life', 'love', 'competition', 'endanger', 'everyone', 'dreams', 'could', 'affect', 'Jess', 'sister', 'wedding', 'Jules', 'mother', 'sanity', 'girl', 'future.The', 'one', 'down-side', 'movie', 'laughably', 'horrible', 'sports', 'scenes', 'footwork', 'goals', 'slow-as-a-sloth', 'goalies', 'complete', 'lack', 'defense', 'slow-motion', 'action', 'scenes', 'take', 'away', 'realism', 'movie', 'causing', 'viewer', 'seriously', 'question', 'belief', 'can', 'be', 'suspended', 'enough', 'truly', 'believe', 'what', 'transpiring.Despite', 'girls', 'families', 'learn', 'overcome', 'differences', 'cultural', 'barriers', 'way', 'athletic', 'triumph', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'probably', 'great', 'chick-flick/sports', 'combo', 'couples', 'watch']",Bend It Like Beckham

Usually it is a smaller independent film (The Blair Witch Project, My Big Fat Greek Wedding) and makes a nice pile of money more than it cost to make.  Word of mouth spreads and the positive reviews come in, and more and more people start to see it.  In 2002 that movie was Bend It Like Beckham.Jessminder (Parminder Nagra) loves to play soccer and is really good at it.  She plays with some of the boys in the park.  Jessminder is an Indian girl, but lives (and was born) in England.  Her mother is very traditional and while Jessminder has been permitted to play until now, Jessminder's mother has decided that she should grow up and learn to be a good Indian woman so she can find a husband.  Juliette (Keira Knightley) sees Jess playing in the park and realizing how good she is, invites Jessminder to play on her team in a league.  Jess does, but has to hide it from her mother (after her mother forbid Jess to play).  It was combination of Jess playing soccer still, and the fact that her coach, Joe (Jonathon Rhys-Meyers) is male.Jessminder's love of soccer and refusal to quit playing causes a rift in her family.  Jess's sister is engaged to be married into a very traditional family who looks down on Jess's activities and Jess's mother wants her to be much more traditional.  Jules encourages Jess to keep playing and as she continues to play the risk increases of her family finding out.This is a very sweet movie and it is a lot of fun and full of charm.  We know that nothing truly bad will happen to Jessminder, but we continue to root for her all the same.  We want Jess to get to play soccer and to be happy.  We hope that her team will do well (and with Jessminder on the team, how can it not?).  There are some layers to this movie, and even though we can easily figure out what comes next and how things get resolved, it doesn't matter.  Parminder Nagra makes her big screen debut with this movie (she has done television before this) and is excellent.  While Keira Knightley and the supporting cast is important to the movie, it is Parminder's success that is the movie's success.  She is sweet and believable and absolutely makes the movie.

611981,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JM2Y,Joseph Haschka,"[56, 67]","BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM refers to the ball-control skill of English football - uh, ""soccer"" to you Yanks - superstar David Beckham, who plays for mighty Manchester United. Beckham has no role in this film except as the hero of Jesminder ""Jess"" Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), the English-born teenaged daughter of middle-class Indian immigrants living in the London suburb of Hounslow under the approach to Heathrow, where Dad works. The girl's mother (Shaheen Khan) wants Jess to learn how to cook a complete Indian dinner, i.e. with meat and veg, marry a nice Indian boy as her older sister is soon to do, and go to the university. All Jess wants is to play football on the green with the lads. The conflict over career paths escalates when Jess is invited to play for the Hounslow Harriers, a girls' football club, by its star player Juliette (Keira Knightley). The Harriers are coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), a young Irishman permanently sidelined by a leg injury. Joe quickly learns that, on the football field, Jess is positively ""brilliant"", and perhaps what American talent scouts are looking for.If you loved MONSOON WEDDING and MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, then this is your cup of Earl Grey. The film is bursting with energy and populated with an attractive and engaging cast. Nagra is effervescent in the lead as Jess. In a supporting role, Juliet Stevenson is perhaps the best as Juliette's totally clueless Mom, Paula. Anupam Kher as Jess's father starts out low key, but he grows on you as the film progresses.After having seen BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM and MONSOON WEDDING, I'm convinced that Indian nuptials are exuberant riots of color, sound, and merriment, and that a sari is the most graceful of female garments. Please don't disabuse me of the notions.Much of BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is predictable, including a love triangle, but there are some unexpected comedic elements stemming from wrongly perceived sexual preferences that add extra spice to an already eminently entertaining film.

Then the international, cross-cultural, girl-power, film comedy ""Bend it Like Beckham"" is surely the answer. The movie takes place in England, where we meet teenager, Jess Kaur Bhamra (played by Parminder Nagra of TV's ""ER""). She loves playing football (thats' soccer for us, Yanks!) and is an absolute phenomenol, wiz at it, running rings around the guys in pick-up games at the park. At one such game, she meets up with another talented female player named, Jules (Keira Knightley), who wants her to join up with her team in an actual proper (rules, refs, uniforms ETC.) Women's league, which takes it's sports very seriously. Jess tries out for the team's young, but headstrong Coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and makes the team! But there is only one big problem. Jess, comes from a very traditional Indian family. Her Mom (Shaheen Kahn) and Dad (Anupam Kher) dosn't think she should be rough-housing and playing games. In their eyes, she should be in the kitchen learning to make a 'proper Indian dinner' for an in the near-future, 'proper Indian husband'. To complicate matters even further, the family is obsessed with her older sister Pinky's (Archie Punjabi) tumultuous, engagement and wedding plans. In a comedic fashion, Jess' football plans and the big wedding eventually meet head on in both a hilarious and rousing collision course. Director/Writer, Gurinder Chadha (""Bhaji On the Beach"", ""What's Cooking?"") has created a wonderful, high energy, feel-good comedy. While on the surface it might look like it's about sports, in reality the film is about following your dreams. Gurinder's script shows us clashes and misunderstandings abound between generations, ethnic groups, male-female relationships and even best friends. If we would only listen to each other once in awhile, we could avoid a whole lot of trouble. The film has a wonderful cast featuring Parminder Nagra giving a great performance as the determined and forthright, Jess. It seems no matter what she does she's going to land in trouble. Keira Knightley is radiant in a standout, supporting performance as Jess' best friend Jules. Also mention should be made of Anupam Kehr who plays Jess' father, who is both loving but conflicted over his daughter's hopes and dreams. Finally, their is veteren actress, Juliet Stevenson's over-the-top, hilarious turn as Jules' mother, who through a misunderstanding thinks her tom-boyish, daughter is having a gay relationship with Jess. I laughed my head off when she uttered the line ""get your lesbian feet out of my shoes!"". The film also has a delightful sound track that features a wonderful mix of both western pop and Indian dance/electronica music. As for the DVD itself the sound & picture plus menus look great and the disc is loaded with extras, that are as much fun as the movie itself. It features deleted/extended scenes, that are hilarious and easily could have been left in the finished film. The disc also has the Director's commentary, a 'Making of Documentary and the film's international trailers. We also get various music videos connected with the film (some of which feature Mr. & Mrs. Beckham themselves!) But my favorite extra on the disc is a cooking lesson of an Indian dish from Director, Gurinder Chadha and her mother. It's great listening to the mother-daughter quibble back and forth and you get some ideal, where the characters from the film might have originated from. This is a very light, funny, upbeat film.

The British setting is refreshing, the acting is wonderful, and the story is upbeat and full of love.Keira Knightly plays Jess's friend, who introduces her to the girls' soccer team.  There's later conflict between them as they both have a crush on the coach, played by Jonathan Rhy's Meyers. But the story is lightweight, all the problems are solved, and in spite of its predictability, there's enough tension to keep it interesting.This is definitely a &quot;feel-good&quot; film, with ethnic clashes reduced to comedy, lovable characters and modern-day details, such as when a cell phone rings and a group of elderly Sikh ladies all pull their cells phones out of their saris.I enjoyed the film and smiled a lot.

Thus, Jess is compelled to join a girl's team on the sly, and much of the comedy of errors that ensues arises from misperceptions of what's really going on by the Indian family, as well as by the British family of Jess' newfound pal, who has something of a crush on the football coach, Joe.This film sure looked promising from the coming attractions I saw, and it didn't disappoint for a second.

The one thing that they are adamant about is that Jess will NOT play football (soccer) because it isn't lady-like.  Jess' athletic ability is discovered by Jules (whose horrible mother is constantly trying to push her daughter to buy padded bras and more feminine clothing--she also tries to discourage the playing of football) who introduces her to the coach of the women's team.

It describes her attempts to fulfill her dreams, which most of the times bring her in direct contrast with her family and society (not so original).Apart from the script, I certainly enjoyed the ethnic/cultural character of the film, which reveals (always in a humorous way) the traditional Indian way of life, touching subjects such as religion, family, clothing, even cooking (delicious!)The soundtrack of the film is simply brilliant, including an intriguing combination of modern, brit pop songs, and traditional (or not so traditional) Indian songs - pay close attention to the wedding song and the end titles song.All the soccer scenes (including the close-ups) are very well shot. The fact that most of those scenes include girls, who prove how smoothly they can handle the ball, makes them even more enjoyable!Concluding, 'Bend it like Beckham' may not be a masterpiece, but it will certainly leave a big smile on your face.PS The film even offers a suggestion as to how you can explain the off-side rule to someone ignorant!

Anyone who dismisses this film as a ""soccer flick"" definitely needs to give it a second look.  Despite it's soccer-themed title, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a fabulous and heart-warming story about family, traditions, friendship, love, fulfilling your dreams, and - yes - soccer (or football to non-US audiences).In the center of the story is Jessminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), a young Indian girl living in England who desperately wants to be a football (soccer) player.  On the one hand, she is incredibly talented, but on the other, she has very traditional  parents who believe that Jess should (a) go to university, (b) become a solicitor, and (c) marry a nice Indian boy.  But Jess has dreams of her own and when she is approached by Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) while playing soccer with the boys at a local park, she secretly joins Jules' local all-girls ""football"" team.  Jules and Jess become close friends but conflicts arise when both girls fall for the same boy - their coach Joe (the handsome Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).There are many, many highlights to this film.  First of all, it is incredibly entertaining and funny.  There are definitely parallels to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" as Jess' family life is thrown into chaos as they plan for her sister Pinky's ""big fat Indian wedding"" (complete with quirky, colorful relatives and friends). Secondly, it has a very talented cast led by newcomer Parminder Nagra (who is wonderful and earnest as the young woman in conflict between her dreams and her family traditions), the beautiful Keira Knightley (who will soon become a household name once ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" opens this summer), handsome heartthrob Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (rumored to be in the running to be the next James Bond), the hilarious Juliet Stevenson (as Jules' prissy mom who is appalled that her daughter would rather play sports than go shopping with her) and Shaheen Khan (as Jess' no-nonsense mom who is equally appalled that her daughter would rather play sports than learn the finer art of Indian cooking).  Thirdly, the production values, script and acting are top-notch, bringing to mind similarly quirky, enjoyable coming-of-age and feel-good films like ""Muriel's Wedding"" and ""Princess Diaries.""I honestly cannot find fault with this film.  I came into the theater without any pre-conceived expectations and came out loving it and wanting to see it again!  This movie is definitely on my DVD must-have list. I can't wait to own it so that I can watch it again and again.  Anglophiles, soccer fans and anyone who enjoys top-notch romantic comedies must see this movie.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[6, 7]","""Bend it like Beckham"" is a film about dreams, more specifically about the dream of Jess (Parminder Nagra), a young teenager who would love to play soccer as well as her idol, David Beckham. There are two problems, though. The first is the fact that she is a girl, and the second is her very traditional Hindu family.The first problem proves to be easily surmountable, as Jess meets Jules (Keira Knightley), a girl who happens to play in the local soccer team. Jules introduces Jess to the coach of her soccer team, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Despite some initial skepticism, Joe incorporates Jess to the team, after a great try out.Unfortunately, Jess cannot share her happiness with her family. Her parents are immigrants from India, and even though they have lived in England for a long time they still cherish their old traditions. Of course, and according to them, a good girl shouldn't play soccer: she should think about getting married  :)As a result, Jess hides the good news from her father (Anupam Kher), mother (Shaheen Khan) and sister (Archie Punjabi), and begins to play soccer with her new team. As you can imagine, keeping her family from finding out the truth will be quite difficult and hectic. Meanwhile, we will learn some things about cultural differences, friendship, love and (why not?) soccer.On the whole, I highly recommend this movie, even if you aren't that much into soccer. It is very entertaining, but it also helps you to reflect on our increasingly multicultural societies.

I also couldn't date a guy who cancelled dates etc just to go and see a bunch of guys kick a stupid ball around. But I found this film a pleasant surprise, as it focused on the girls, and didn't go too much into the football side of the things. I didn't have to know the offside rule just to watch the film.Parminder Nagra was absolutely fabulous in this film, despite her character's obsession with David Beckham (bleurgh), and she was a real natural in front of the camera too. This girl has big things ahead of her. She also wears the number 7 shirt, the same number Beckham wears for England, and once wore for Manchester United. Unlike her super-skinny co-star, Parminder has a really natural shape, and isn't ashamed to show it off. And the scar on her leg (which I didn't think was real at first) was also incorportated into the film, as well as the story behind it, as originally Parminder thought it would stop her from getting the role.I have to say, Keira Knightley really is way too skinny. She needs a good feeding, and also needs to do something with her hair. It was a mess in this film. She manages to show off her six pack (how many girls do you know who have a six pack?) with the little crop tops she insisted on wearing.Johnathan Rhys Meyers was lovely in this film, and also the accent as well! The plot was sometimes a little predictable, as the three main stars got involved in a love triangle, and you could so see that coming! (Although, in the original script, it was Parminder & Keira's characters who were actually in love, and there's still some of this left in the film, including Jules mum thinking her daughter - Keira - is in love with Jess.)And what's strange in this film is that although Parminder & Keira are playing teenagers, there's actually a 10 year age gap between them, but Parminder does NOT look 10 years older than Keira. Keira was born in 1985, and Parminder was born in 1975.The extras aren't up to much, and kinda boring at the same time. You've got your average commentaries, deleted scenes, making of, outtakes, music videos and also ""Who Wants to Cook Aloo Gobi?"" featurette and the recipe for Aloo Gobi.I did enjoy this movie, although the ending is a little sad, and there are a lot of serious issues sprinkled throughout. It's definitely a movie I'll watch again, with a lot of injokes as well, and sports bra jokes. It also gives an insight into the Indian culture, which worked really well I thought.",3,"Predictable, but good",1125792000,"09 4, 2005",2005,2526,"['have', 'interest', 'football', 'none', 'family', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'date', 'guy', 'who', 'cancelled', 'dates', 'etc', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'bunch', 'guys', 'kick', 'stupid', 'ball', 'around', 'found', 'film', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'focused', 'girls', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'football', 'side', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'offside', 'rule', 'just', 'watch', 'film.Parminder', 'Nagra', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'film', 'character', 'obsession', 'David', 'Beckham', 'bleurgh', 'was', 'real', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'too', 'girl', 'big', 'things', 'ahead', 'also', 'number', '7', 'shirt', 'same', 'number', 'Beckham', 'England', 'once', 'wore', 'Manchester', 'United', 'super-skinny', 'co-star', 'Parminder', 'really', 'natural', 'shape', ""n't"", 'ashamed', 'show', 'off', 'scar', 'leg', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'real', 'first', 'was', 'also', 'incorportated', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'originally', 'Parminder', 'thought', 'would', 'stop', 'getting', 'role.I', 'have', 'say', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'really', 'way', 'too', 'skinny', 'good', 'feeding', 'also', 'do', 'something', 'hair', 'was', 'mess', 'film', 'show', 'off', 'six', 'pack', 'how', 'many', 'girls', 'do', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'six', 'pack', 'little', 'crop', 'insisted', 'wearing.Johnathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'was', 'lovely', 'film', 'also', 'accent', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'was', 'sometimes', 'little', 'predictable', 'three', 'main', 'stars', 'got', 'involved', 'love', 'triangle', 'could', 'so', 'see', 'coming', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'Parminder', 'Keira', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'love', 'still', 'left', 'film', 'including', 'Jules', 'mum', 'thinking', 'daughter', 'Keira', 'love', 'Jess', 'what', 'strange', 'film', 'Parminder', 'Keira', 'are', 'playing', 'teenagers', 'actually', '10', 'year', 'age', 'gap', 'Parminder', 'NOT', 'look', '10', 'years', 'older', 'Keira', 'Keira', 'was', 'born', '1985', 'Parminder', 'was', 'born', '1975.The', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'much', 'kinda', 'boring', 'same', 'time', ""'ve"", 'got', 'average', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making', 'outtakes', 'music', 'videos', 'also', 'Who', 'Cook', 'Aloo', 'Gobi', 'featurette', 'recipe', 'Aloo', 'Gobi.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'ending', 'little', 'sad', 'are', 'lot', 'serious', 'issues', 'sprinkled', 'definitely', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'lot', 'injokes', 'as', 'well', 'sports', 'bra', 'jokes', 'also', 'insight', 'Indian', 'culture', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'thought']",Bend It Like Beckham

612010,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JM2Y,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[3, 3]","The film &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; is an engaging film about a teenaged Sikh girl, Jesminder 'Jess' Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra), that loves to play soccer and her hero is the famous soccer player David Beckham, who once played for Manchester United. (Some archive footage of David Beckham is used in the film.)  Unfortunately, Jess's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Brahma (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan respectively), don't completely approve (her mother especially) of Jess's continued participation in soccer as she has grown.  Instead, they want her to learn more traditional Sikh family ways. A very memorable scene is the film's opening with Jess imagining herself playing with David Beckham, with television sports commentators interviewing her parents.  However, in Jess's imagination, her mother begins to scold the commentators for encouraging her to play soccer.  As the story progresses, Jess's friend Juliette 'Jules' Paxton (Keira Knightley) invites Jess to play on her team that is coached by an Irishman named Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Though her parents object, Jess continues to play with the team and even manages to secretly go with them to play against a team in Germany; and that's when things change more drastically and unexpectedly for Jess, Jules and Joe.Gurinder Chadha did a superb job of directing and writing &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot;. (Paul Mayeda Berges and Guljit Bindra assisted in its writing.)  Parminder K. Nagra's acting was wonderful, as was Shaheen Khan as her mother in the film.  Other memorable characters include Pinky Bhamra (Archie Panjabi), Mel (Shaznay Lewis), Jules' mother Paula Paxton (Juliet Stevenson), her father Alan Paxton (Frank Harper) and Jess's friend Tony (Ameet Chana).  Though the film received no Academy Award nominations, it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy Motion Picture.  It was also nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film by BAFTA.  Overall, I rate &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; with 4.5 stars rounded to 5.

She develops a friendship with one of her teammates and generally loves the new world she has entered.Meanwhile Jesse's sister has had her engagement arranged.  Jesse gets in big trouble when she hugs her teammate in a bus stop and the parents of the groom happen by in car.  They see Jesse's teammate from the back and think that it is an ""English boy.""

There things get rocky between herself and her teammate because they are both competing for the affections of their coach.  He seems to favor Jesse because he has had similar problems with his own parents who think it is unmanly to coach women's soccer.

But don't make the mistake of thinking that you should have more than a passing interest in the game in order to understand and relate to this film.  All you need to know is that the Beckham of the title is the Michael Jordon/Wayne Gretzky or English soccer and that he has the ability to kick a ball along a curved trajectory, hence ""bending it"".  The basic themes are far more universal, centering around the differences between parents and children, males and females, and Western versus East Asian cultures.Parminder Nagra plays Jesminder (Jess for short), the younger daughter of an Indian family living near London.  Unlike her sister and many of her friends, her dreams deal not with gaining a husband and having children but playing professional soccer.  As if to underscore the philosophical divide, the portrait of a Sikh religious figure dominates the living room of the family home while a poster of her idol David Beckham is the most prominent feature of her room, with both images being on the receiving end of various prayers and confidences.  Not surprisingly, Jess' traditionally-minded family does not view her obsession with football as a positive goal (no pun intended).When she is recruited by Jules (Keira Knightley) to play on a girl's tournament team, Jess tries to balance lessons in traditional Indian cooking with her mother with surreptitious training and games.  Jules has her concerns with the possibility of impressing an American scout, and a mother that frets over the possibility of her daughter's passion for athletics turning her into a lesbian.

Made up of equal parts ""Monsoon Wedding"" (moving the Hindu family from India to England) and ""Breaking Away"" (substituting soccer for cycling and girls for boys), ""Beckham"" is guaranteed to have you leaving the theater lighter of heart and step than when you entered. At the heart of the film is Jess (Parminder Nagra), whose love of soccer horrifies her devout Hindu family and even endangers her sister's wedding into an even more traditional family. Encouraging Jess is her new friend Jules (Keira Knightley), star of the local girls' soccer team, who tells entrancing tales of professional women's soccer in America. But their shared attraction to Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the team's brooding coach, soon causes trouble. Meanwhile, Jules' prattling mother (Juliet Stevenson) starts jumping to conclusions about what she perceives as her daughter's masculine behavior. It's no surprise to know that all these conflicts get resolved happily, with whipped cream and a cherry on top. That's the pleasure of a movie like ""Bend It Like Beckham;"" you go to see something that will make you feel good, and you get it, only seldom do you get it done so expertly. (The set of ""Beckham"" must have been a happy place to work, judging from the outtakes shown during the end credits.)

""Beckham""'s themes are universal: The goals of the younger generation clash with those of their parents; A woman tries to succeed at something normally reserved for men.

With so little expectations, all these films have surprised everyone and became box office hits worldwide, and far from being a coincidence, it was all the result of not only talent,but of dedicated hard working young filmmakers,who have fresh and very original ideas, and who got the chance to share it with the world.These young filmmakers, unlike their colleagues in France or the US, do not have the same financial support, and some do really struggle to get their films made. Although there is the Film Council and BskyB who support movie making, the demise of the excellent Filmfour the film division of TV's channel 4(a bit similar to France's Canal +) was a blow to British cinema. But despite that, films are still being made, very successfully and artistically at a that.What distinguishes British cinema, not unlike some European cinemas,is the close relationship and collaboration between writer and director,(if the two are not one and the same). Usually, the two are close friends, who work on the idea together for some time before securing the finances and shooting their project.Bend it Like Beckham is another example of a little film, whose impact was huge.Director Gurinder Chadha (Bhaaji On the Beach) manages to direct a movie that takes womens football as a platform, but weaves many themes on top,friendships,dreams, traditional cultures in 21st Century Britain clashing with the  possibilty of fulfilling these dreams, one that was not available to the first generation of immigrants.So as a result,it does not matter if you do not like football (soccer)or do not understand the game, because the film has a lot more to offer and entertain you in the process.Chadha manages as well to write (or co write)a wonderful comedy too, which is guaranteed to leave you with a feel good feeling long after you watch it.The humour mainly comes from the parents, both Indian and English.Chadha also manages,to show another lighter face of multi-cultural Britain, not unlike the film East Is East (and not Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding as one reviewer saw it).All the actors are great, especially first time actor, and very pretty Parminder Nagra(Jesse), and Keira Knightley (Jules),and  also of course the wonderful Juliet Stevenson, one of my all time favorite actresses.Bend It Like Beckham, is a rare treat, a film that will totally captivate you, with its gentle humour, its engaging story, a must buy from the rich vault of British Cinema.",5,Rule New Britannia!,1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,2644,"['Full', 'Monty', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'East', 'East', '28', 'Days', 'Later..and', 'so', 'on..British', 'cinema', 'full', 'prime', 'talent', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', 'so', 'little', 'expectations', 'films', 'have', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'became', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'worldwide', 'far', 'being', 'coincidence', 'was', 'result', 'not', 'only', 'talent', 'dedicated', 'hard', 'working', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'fresh', 'very', 'original', 'ideas', 'who', 'got', 'chance', 'share', 'world.These', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'colleagues', 'France', 'US', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'financial', 'support', 'do', 'really', 'struggle', 'get', 'films', 'made', 'Film', 'Council', 'BskyB', 'who', 'support', 'movie', 'making', 'demise', 'excellent', 'Filmfour', 'film', 'division', 'TV', 'channel', '4', 'bit', 'similar', 'France', 'Canal', '+', 'was', 'blow', 'British', 'cinema', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'made', 'very', 'successfully', 'artistically', 'British', 'cinema', 'not', 'European', 'cinemas', 'close', 'relationship', 'collaboration', 'writer', 'director', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'same', 'Usually', 'two', 'are', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'work', 'idea', 'together', 'time', 'securing', 'finances', 'shooting', 'project.Bend', 'Beckham', 'example', 'little', 'film', 'impact', 'was', 'huge.Director', 'Gurinder', 'Chadha', 'Bhaaji', 'Beach', 'direct', 'movie', 'womens', 'football', 'platform', 'many', 'themes', 'top', 'friendships', 'dreams', 'traditional', 'cultures', '21st', 'Century', 'Britain', 'clashing', 'possibilty', 'fulfilling', 'dreams', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'first', 'generation', 'immigrants.So', 'result', 'not', 'matter', 'do', 'not', 'football', 'soccer', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'game', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'offer', 'entertain', 'process.Chadha', 'as', 'well', 'write', 'co', 'write', 'wonderful', 'comedy', 'too', 'guaranteed', 'leave', 'feel', 'good', 'feeling', 'long', 'watch', 'it.The', 'humour', 'mainly', 'parents', 'Indian', 'English.Chadha', 'also', 'show', 'lighter', 'face', 'multi-cultural', 'Britain', 'not', 'film', 'East', 'Is', 'East', 'not', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'one', 'reviewer', 'saw', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'first', 'time', 'actor', 'very', 'pretty', 'Parminder', 'Nagra', 'Jesse', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Jules', 'also', 'course', 'wonderful', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'actresses.Bend', 'Beckham', 'rare', 'treat', 'film', 'will', 'totally', 'captivate', 'gentle', 'humour', 'engaging', 'story', 'must', 'buy', 'rich', 'vault', 'British', 'Cinema']",Bend It Like Beckham

Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[2, 2]","With the recent popular successes of indie or foreign films focused on non-traditional American culture, like &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding,&quot; and &quot;Bend it Like Beckham,&quot; it is telling.  It tells of a film consumer need that big production Hollywood isn't currently meeting.  &quot;Bend it Like Beckham,&quot; is indeed unique and heartwarming, qualities lacking in Hollywood production line productions.British-made, we aren't left dismaying subtitles.  A small criticism is that &quot;Bend it&quot; takes a while to hit it's stride.  It no doubt will be a popular view for the soccer-(or football as the rest of the known world knows the sport as) crazed public toting young girls off to Saturday dreams of becoming the next Mia Hamm or Brandi Chastain.  Where, &quot;Bend it&quot; truly makes it's mark is the portrayal of the push and pull of a traditional Indian family making their way assimilating into a foreign culture in a foreign land.  It reminds me much of Amy Tan's &quot;Joy Luck Club,&quot; in that regards.  We are hooked with the movie when main character Jess, played beautifully by Parminder Nagra, finds a way to balance her love for a traditionally-minded family and her personal dreams of following her gifted skills to where they may lead her in the world.  It is a magical cinema moment.The only thing that holds up this movie from the vaunted 5-star ranking is clarity of vision and need for originality.  &quot;Bend it Like Beckham,&quot; tries to be too much, all things to all people.  It is all at once a coming of age story, a clash of cultures story, a feel good sports-formula story, a girl power story.  In addition, it finds itself slightly leaning on the sports-formula crutch.With this said, the criticism are minor, the movie is a good one.  Don't miss it.

Already a HUGE hit everywhere around the world, especailly the place it was filmed, England, it is finally coming to the united states and expanding slowly.  With war coverage on the news 24/7, people need a place to escape reality these past couple of months, and thats why the biggest hits this year (Bringing down the House, How to lose a guy in 10 days) are light hearted comedies.  This is a movie you can go into, forget about all of your worries and troubles for two hours, and come out feeling refreshed, uplifted, and extremely happy.  The storyline is pretty simple;  an Indian family in England wont let their daughter play soccer anymore.  If you are looking for a bunch of rolling on the floor laughs, you wont find them here, but the script is funny, witty, and definately will bring forth more than a few chuckles.  I highly recommend this movie.  Its the best one Ive seen all year and definately will end up being in my top 5 movies of this year.

College-bound Jess (lovely Parminder Nagra), the second daughter in a family of traditional Sikhs in London, has a gift for football (soccer to us), but little opportunity to indulge her passion. A new friend, Juliet (the radiant Keira Knightly), invites her to join a girl's football team, and from then on it's a game of hide and seek as Jess tries to keep the truth from her parents. The date set for an important match, complete with American talent scouts, conflicts with the wedding day of Jess' sister, and to make matters more difficult, Juliet's mother thinks the two pals are lesbian lovers. (In actuality, both fancy their attractive Irish coach, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers.)

Solinger,"[2, 2]","If you hesitated renting this movie because of it's foreign nature or it's lack of box office success (domestically), then let me set you straight.  This is a great, funny, movie.The story takes place in England as a young girl discovers she has a natural talent for playing soccer.  She even gets invited to join an all-girls team.  The only problem is that she's Indian and her parents are traditional.  In their mind, Indian girls need to worry about learning domestic chores and finding a husband, not playing games.  Naturally, Jess does what all teenage girls would do in this situation:  lies to her parents and sneaks off to play anyway.  The backstory involves her sisters pending wedding and what Jess' soccer playing, and erratic behavior, will do to hurt the wedding.There are a lot of laughs, but there's also some serious drama, and the cast and crew pull it off seamlessly.  You will really enjoy this film as an escapist adventure.  Many of us don't live in England, and aren't Indian, so the enrichment we received from watching this film more then makes up for any minor weaknesses the film may have.

If you want an age appropriate film for mid-teens then try New Waterford Girl, 1999. There's a teen girl buddy story that tackles some tricky problems with wit and script.Problem 1:  The happy talk about the ethnic differences and PC drivel about the immigrants that have swarmed into England for a better life, especially the Muslims, this is a bitter pill to swallow after the 2005 bombings of innocents in London.  To be fair, Parmider Nagra's family is a discriminated upon group of folks with turbans, the Sikh's.  They are non-Muslims in secular white England.  You can't happy talk folks into being more tolerant. Sorry, you can't.Problem 2:  The sports action scenes are so predictable. They go on and on for half the movie.  Nagra overcomes all obstacles and scores the winning goal.  No kidding!  I didn't see that one coming.Problem 3:  Neither Nagra or her bosom bud, Keira Knightley look like first class athletes.  They are either too short or too skinny.  They look better with teased up hair and disco outfits dancing for their skinny ex-soccer prodigy, their coach.Problem 4:  I like ethnic comedies; My Big Fat Greek Wedding comes to mind.  But at this point, the generation gap between old country dopes and their offspring in modern Western civilization is tiring.  Hey, if your old ways and old country were so great, why don't you go back there?  I'll tell you why, because there is no opportunity where you came from and people live in dirt.

Kyle,"[3, 5]","But, can just anyone direct a complex film like this and make it seem fresh and simple?Have watched two films of Gurinder Chadha and I'm convinced the man is a genius.  In ""Bend it"" he manages to seque enough sub-plots together to create a full story that will keep viewers seeing new aspects after numerous viewings.First, there's Jessminda (Parminder Nagra) a second sister in a traditional Indian family who only wants to play football (soccer in US parlance) and 'bend it (the ball) like (David) Beckham.'  When Jules, an English girl with similar ambitions, discovers Jess and recruits her for an all girls soccer team, Jess doesn't even know what position she played.  She just played on the field.  Well, it turns out Jess is brilliant and it only takes a little coaching to get that brilliance polished.Then there is Jess' relationship to Keira Knightly (Jules).  Jules' mother thinks Jules is a lesbian because all she's interested in is sports.  When she overhears a conversation between Jess and Jules, she believes the two girls are in love and Jess betrayed her daughter...Then there's Jess' older sister, Pinky, who just wants to get married.  The misunderstandings between the two sets of parents, etc. seem to be keeping the lovers apart.Then, there's Joe, the girls' soccer coach who just may be falling in love with Jess.  Jess admits she'll have an easier time explaining that she wants to be a professional athlete than bringing home a white boyfriend....""Bend it"" is hilarious and bears watching more than once even if you think you have all the plot elements down.

612039,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JM2Y,RMurray847,"[4, 4]","This movie will be compared frequently to MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING.  I really like GREEK WEDDING and thought it was full of laughs and was a ""feel good"" movie.BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM has many elements in common, particularly a character in opposition to the wishes of her parents.  However, the lead character very much respects the culture of her parents, and her conflict doesn't come because she feels the ""old ways"" of her parents are outdated or silly, but because she is torn between the ""old ways"" and new ways.The main character is a teen, just out of high school, Jess, who is a Sikh.  She's a lovely, intelligent and sensitive young lady with a great sense of humor who also loves to play soccer.  Her parents, disapprove of such activity.  Jess encounters spunky Juliet, another good player, who entices Jess to join the local all-girl's team.  Juliet (who goes by Jules) is all British, using terms like ""brilliant"" frequently.  The two girls seem to have little in common aside from the love of soccer, but a close friendship develops.  Jess, whose older sister is about to get married, must sneak behind her parents' back to play soccer, and when she is discovered, much conflict ensues.More conflict ensues when the coach, Joe, is the subject of a crush by both young ladies.  Jules saw him first, of course, but Joe is really attracted to Jess, and when this comes out, the girls' friendship is tested.This only gives you a bare glimpse of the many twists and turns the movie takes.  There are lots of great ""ethnic"" Indian characters, all quite memorable, especially Jess' father, who is an airline pilot.  These immigrants to England have done quite well for themselves, but remain somewhat insular and stick to their own kind.  Jess wants to see more of the world, not because she doesn't love and appreciate where she comes from, but because the world offers her the chance to play more soccer.  She isn't rebelious, as such, she is simply driven.Will it all work out?  Well, this is the ""feel good"" movie of the year, after all, so you guess. But you know what, the movie is full of surprises great and small nonetheless.  Little moments you might not expect.  And the ending is actually far from a cliche, and leaves a little ambiquity.EVERYONE in this little movie is top-notch.  The script is terrific, and to be quite honest, I think this is the most I've enjoyed myself at a movie this entire year thus far.By the way, the movie actually has very little soccer in it, so if you aren't a big soccer buff, don't fret, you won't be lost.  And if you love soccer, there's enough here to draw you in, but it's the rest of the story that will move you.Also, this movie has a simply terrific wedding / reception sequence.  These kinds of scenes have become cliches in comedies and dramas alike, but the way this one moves (and later juxtaposes with a soccer game) is delightful.There are a few belly laughs in the movie, but to be honest, this is a movie that puts a smile on your face early on, and it just doesn't leave.  I had a delightful time, and think you will too.  (The movie is PG-13 and is honest and open about sexuality without being the least bit ""dirty,"" but you may want to keep anyone under 13 away anyway.)",5,"DELIGHTFUL, SURPRISING and ""BRILLIANT""",1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,3240,"['movie', 'will', 'be', 'compared', 'frequently', 'MY', 'BIG', 'FAT', 'GREEK', 'WEDDING', 'really', 'GREEK', 'WEDDING', 'thought', 'was', 'full', 'laughs', 'was', 'feel', 'good', 'IT', 'LIKE', 'BECKHAM', 'many', 'elements', 'common', 'particularly', 'character', 'opposition', 'wishes', 'parents', 'However', 'lead', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'culture', 'parents', 'conflict', ""n't"", 'come', 'old', 'ways', 'parents', 'are', 'outdated', 'silly', 'torn', 'old', 'ways', 'new', 'ways.The', 'main', 'character', 'teen', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'Jess', 'who', 'Sikh', 'lovely', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'young', 'lady', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'who', 'also', 'play', 'soccer', 'parents', 'disapprove', 'such', 'activity', 'Jess', 'encounters', 'spunky', 'Juliet', 'good', 'player', 'who', 'Jess', 'join', 'local', 'all-girl', 'team', 'Juliet', 'who', 'Jules', 'British', 'using', 'terms', 'brilliant', 'frequently', 'two', 'girls', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'aside', 'love', 'soccer', 'close', 'friendship', 'Jess', 'older', 'sister', 'get', 'married', 'must', 'sneak', 'parents', 'back', 'play', 'soccer', 'when', 'discovered', 'much', 'conflict', 'ensues.More', 'conflict', 'ensues', 'when', 'coach', 'Joe', 'subject', 'crush', 'young', 'ladies', 'Jules', 'saw', 'first', 'course', 'Joe', 'really', 'attracted', 'Jess', 'when', 'out', 'girls', 'friendship', 'tested.This', 'only', 'bare', 'glimpse', 'many', 'twists', 'movie', 'are', 'lots', 'great', 'ethnic', 'Indian', 'characters', 'quite', 'memorable', 'especially', 'Jess', 'father', 'who', 'airline', 'pilot', 'immigrants', 'England', 'have', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'remain', 'somewhat', 'insular', 'stick', 'own', 'kind', 'Jess', 'see', 'more', 'world', 'not', ""n't"", 'love', 'appreciate', 'where', 'world', 'chance', 'play', 'more', 'soccer', ""n't"", 'rebelious', 'such', 'simply', 'driven.Will', 'work', 'out', 'Well', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'year', 'guess', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'full', 'surprises', 'great', 'small', 'nonetheless', 'Little', 'moments', 'might', 'not', 'expect', 'ending', 'actually', 'far', 'cliche', 'little', 'ambiquity.EVERYONE', 'little', 'movie', 'top-notch', 'script', 'terrific', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'think', 'most', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'entire', 'year', 'thus', 'far.By', 'way', 'movie', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'soccer', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'soccer', 'buff', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'lost', 'love', 'soccer', 'enough', 'here', 'draw', 'rest', 'story', 'will', 'move', 'you.Also', 'movie', 'simply', 'terrific', 'wedding', '/', 'reception', 'sequence', 'kinds', 'scenes', 'have', 'become', 'cliches', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'alike', 'way', 'one', 'moves', 'later', 'juxtaposes', 'soccer', 'game', 'delightful.There', 'are', 'few', 'belly', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'movie', 'smile', 'face', 'early', 'just', ""n't"", 'leave', 'had', 'delightful', 'time', 'think', 'will', 'too', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'honest', 'open', 'sexuality', 'being', 'least', 'bit', 'dirty', 'may', 'want', 'keep', 'anyone', '13', 'away', 'anyway']",Bend It Like Beckham

And again, it's not a bad little film, but like Thirteen, the end result seems rather a lot of hype for something that didn't really deserve it.Jesminder (ER's Parminder Nagra) wants nothing other than to play football (soccer, for you sport-challenged Americans) like her idol, David Beckham. Her parents think it's time to put away the game and concentrate on school. Unfortunately, just at the same time they decide this, Jess gets invited to play on an all-girls' soccer team. Please her parents or continue to play behind their backs? (The latter, of course, or there wouldn't be a movie.) Along the way, she finds herself possibly getting romantically entangled with her coach, Joe (Titus and b. Monkey showstealer Jonathan Rhys-Myers), which would cause her parents to have a heart attack. Hilarity ensues.It's got a few laughs (rent the DVD, you'll need the subtitles to get some of the jokes), a nice if predictable plotline (which one wag we watched it with kept comparing to the TV show Saved by the Bell), lots of very pretty folks doing very pretty things.

At first glance this movie appears to be a brit-flick-chick-flick but it is a whole lot more.  I cant say enough about what an enjoyable movie this is.  The cinematography is beautiful and it has a great soundtrack that really gets the audience in a happy mood.The story is fresh and while the theme may not be you don't notice it because the characters, both Indian and British, are well crafted and greatly portrayed.  The Indian family is of course very idiosyncratic and the director, being Indian, pokes a little fun at her own culture -- of course with the best intentions.  But she doesn't save this just for the Indians, ""Jules"" parents (the English Set) are two riotously humorous characters.Beyond this, the script is so well written with fresh humor and great sequencing.  I think the film really is a gem.  The best part about the film is its wide appeal.  This is one of those rare movies you can watch with your extended family and they will all love it.  Of course the film resonates best with adolescents but I haven't found a single person who hasn't said this film is at least good.One warning: The soundtrack is catchy and you may need to buy it.If you have seen the film in theaters or on TV you are still missing out.  Get the DVD its packed with deleted scenes (which are understandably not a part of the original film), an aloo gobi recipe and a great commentary -- just to name a few things.

I've never seen such an enthusiastic applause in a theater. And the movie deserves it. We went to the big local megaplex 24 theater movie house even though this is also showing in art movie theaters. And it was sold out, filled to capacity.This is a movie about a young woman's struggle with her Sikh Indian parents' rules and traditions versus being a contemporary adult who talks the same talk as all the other British kids and British Indian kids who, outside of the house, away from the parents are like any other older teen.The acting is superb. We have some great new faces destined for stardom. The music is an awesome blend of western rock and pop and Indian contemporary music.Good stories are built around characters who fascinate us, who we relate to, who we care about and this movie introduces a whole batch of them-- at least six superb actors who you will look forward to seeing again. They played out a script that provided the actors with wonderful characters who made complex, difficult decisions and showed brilliant flawed humanity.This is a movie about clashing cultures and how real people adjust to those clashes. The World Trade Center Bombing was also about that clash of cultures. This movie does a beautiful job of showing how such clashes, fraught with strong emotion and opinons, can be worked out for a positive outcome. I'd like to see a similar movie with a clash between westerners and the Islamic world. It's important to build bridges through humor and positive emotions. This movie was fabulously successful at doing that.When we left the theater we felt great.

612044,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JM2Y,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","Jessie has a problem. She is a young Sikh girl living in England who is also a very talented soccer player with an opportunity to play on a women's soccer team that is scouted by American scouts looking for women to play professionally in the United States. Her problem is that her family, however, is adamant that playing soccer is not one of the desirable qualities in a prospective bride, and insists that she instead give up playing soccer and concentrate instead on learning to cook Indian food.Thus the central conflict is one of the most unique and delightful films of the past few years is created. This is a movie with many, many excellent qualities, and not a few ironies. For instance, Jesminder Bhamra a.k.a. Jess or Jessie, the heroine of our story, is an exceptionally nice girl. Unlike many of the other Indian girls, she doesn't sneak off with guys and engage in sexual behavior that would outrage her parents. All she does is play soccer. Yet, time and again Jess is the victim of narrow-minded prigs, who constantly fantasize that she is doing things that she shouldn't. At times, it seems that she absolutely anything she does leads to misunderstandings and condemnations.Parminder Nagra, who plays Jess, is utterly adorable and loveable. If this movie engages you emotionally, it is because you feel so deeply her plight and the seeming impossibility of her situation. She is a girl who has a chance to become so much more than her peers, but who is constricted by a narrow and parochial understanding of the proper role for a girl. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who played the central character of Brian Slade in VELVET GOLDMINE, is Jess's coach. Keira Knightley, who starred as Lara in a recent TV version of DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, is excellent as the girl who first sees Jess playing soccer in the park and recruits her for her women's team, and who later becomes her friend. But apart from Parminder Nagra, no actor or actress adds as much to the film as the actress who portrays Jess's mother. Her hysterics, her despair over her uncooperative daughter who resists the role she has planned for her, her frequent emotional explosions provide many of the film's funnier moments. But as good as the supporting cast is, the character of Jess has to carry this film, and Parminder Nagra utterly succeeds in doing so.Apart from the central conflict of Jess versus the expectations of her family and community, the thing I enjoyed most about this film was the incredibly vivid and full picture of the Indian community in which Jess and her family live. The viewer really becomes a part of this very distinct world, and while the director clearly sides with Jess in her aspirations to engage in activities frowned upon by that community, he nonetheless treats it with tremendous understanding and affection.One of my favorite movies of the past year, and an absolute must-see picture.",5,Bend it like Jessie!,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,2886,"['Jessie', 'problem', 'young', 'Sikh', 'girl', 'living', 'England', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'talented', 'soccer', 'player', 'opportunity', 'play', 'women', 'soccer', 'team', 'scouted', 'American', 'scouts', 'looking', 'women', 'play', 'professionally', 'United', 'States', 'problem', 'family', 'however', 'adamant', 'playing', 'soccer', 'not', 'one', 'desirable', 'qualities', 'prospective', 'bride', 'instead', 'give', 'up', 'playing', 'soccer', 'concentrate', 'instead', 'learning', 'cook', 'Indian', 'food.Thus', 'central', 'conflict', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'delightful', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'created', 'movie', 'many', 'many', 'excellent', 'qualities', 'not', 'few', 'ironies', 'instance', 'Jesminder', 'Bhamra', 'a.k.a', 'Jess', 'Jessie', 'heroine', 'story', 'exceptionally', 'nice', 'girl', 'many', 'other', 'Indian', 'girls', ""n't"", 'sneak', 'off', 'guys', 'engage', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'would', 'outrage', 'parents', 'play', 'soccer', 'time', 'again', 'Jess', 'victim', 'narrow-minded', 'prigs', 'who', 'constantly', 'fantasize', 'doing', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'times', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'leads', 'misunderstandings', 'condemnations.Parminder', 'Nagra', 'who', 'Jess', 'utterly', 'adorable', 'loveable', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'feel', 'so', 'deeply', 'plight', 'seeming', 'impossibility', 'situation', 'girl', 'who', 'chance', 'become', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'peers', 'who', 'constricted', 'narrow', 'parochial', 'understanding', 'proper', 'role', 'girl', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'who', 'played', 'central', 'character', 'Brian', 'Slade', 'VELVET', 'GOLDMINE', 'Jess', 'coach', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'starred', 'Lara', 'recent', 'TV', 'version', 'DOCTOR', 'ZHIVAGO', 'excellent', 'girl', 'who', 'first', 'Jess', 'playing', 'soccer', 'park', 'women', 'team', 'who', 'later', 'friend', 'apart', 'Parminder', 'Nagra', 'actor', 'actress', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'actress', 'who', 'Jess', 'mother', 'hysterics', 'despair', 'uncooperative', 'daughter', 'who', 'role', 'planned', 'her', 'frequent', 'emotional', 'explosions', 'provide', 'many', 'film', 'funnier', 'moments', 'as', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'character', 'Jess', 'carry', 'film', 'Parminder', 'Nagra', 'utterly', 'doing', 'so.Apart', 'central', 'conflict', 'Jess', 'expectations', 'family', 'community', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'incredibly', 'vivid', 'full', 'picture', 'Indian', 'community', 'Jess', 'family', 'live', 'viewer', 'really', 'part', 'very', 'distinct', 'world', 'director', 'clearly', 'sides', 'Jess', 'aspirations', 'engage', 'activities', 'frowned', 'community', 'nonetheless', 'tremendous', 'understanding', 'affection.One', 'favorite', 'movies', 'past', 'year', 'absolute', 'must-see', 'picture']",Bend It Like Beckham
612045,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JM2Y,Robert Morris,"[4, 4]","Like everybody else, I appreciate knowing in advance if a film is poor so I can avoid it; also, I prefer to ""discover"" an especially enjoyable film rather than hear or read raves about it in advance. This is one of three films I saw for the first time without knowing anything about them, the other two being Good Will Hunting and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Although I consider none a ""great"" film, I thoroughly enjoyed all three but for different reasonsBend It Like Beckham was directed by Gurinder Chadha and co-stars Parminder K. Nagra (Jess Bhamra) and Keira Knightley (Jules Paxton), with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Joe), Anupan Kher (Jess's father), and Juliet Stevenson (Jules's mother Paula) cast in important supporting roles. The film examines the struggles of two teenage girls to overcome parental resistance to their playing on the Hounslow Harriers league football (aka soccer) team. Their ultimate goal is to play for a college or university in the United States. Until a career-ending injury, their Harriers coach (Joe) played on a major professional team in England. Both Jess and Jules are attracted to their demanding but caring young coach. I view their feelings for him as being more substantial than teenage infatuation.As is also true of so many other sports movies (e.g. Hoosiers), there is a Big Game to Be Won and, of course, dramatic tension increases as it approaches. Given the fact that her older sister's (Big Fat Indian) wedding is scheduled on the same day, will Jess be allowed to play? Will her friendship with Jules be re-established? With or wirhout Jess, will the Harriers win? If they do, how will that victory affect Joe's career opportunities as a player or coach? Will Jess and/or Jules be offered an athletic scholarship? The acting is consistently outstanding. Chadha brilliantly delineates the traditional values of Jess's family (especially her mother's), some of which differ significantly from those of Jules's family (especially her mother's). Each girl lives in two worlds, both of which compete for her loyalty. Jess and Jules struggle to keep their parents happy while working so hard to help the Harriers win the league championship. As is also true of Good Will Hunting, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and Tortilla Soup, there is an abundance of humor in this film. Many moments are hilarious, including the not-to-be-missed final credits. The film is good-natured and warmhearted throughout, even when misunderstandings threaten relationships, notably Jess's friendship with Jules. This film has little (if any) social significance but offers wholesome, delightful entertainment of very high quality.

612047,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JM2Y,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","***1/2 ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl's search for identity in 21st Century England.  Like ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" ""Beckham"" deals with the painful struggles tradition-bound cultures must go through as they enter a looser, more freedom-loving modern world.  The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first-generation Indians living in Great Britain.  As with all such tales, it is the young folk who feel the need to pull away from the stuffy values of the past, and who end up dragging the reluctant older folk kicking and screaming into the future right along with them.Jess Bharma is a fairly typical teen with dreams of becoming a world-class soccer player.  However, Jess also comes from a very traditional Indian family that believes a girl should not play around with boys, show her legs in public, or aspire to much beyond marrying a good Indian boy and raising a family.  We've seen this kind of set-up countless times before and ""Bend It Like Beckam"" will certainly not win any prizes for creativity or originality.  It does, however, have a youthful exuberance and a generous spirit that can't help but captivate even the most diehard, coldhearted cynic.  Parminder K. Nagra is utterly winning as young Jess, capturing all the innate optimism and unquenchable enthusiasm of this irrepressible character.  She receives superb support from a cast of outstanding actors, both young and old, including Keira Knightley as Jules, her inspirational buddy who provides Jess with the opportunity to bring her dreams to fruition; Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Joe, the handsome young coach who provides lessons in love along with lessons in soccer; Anupam Kher as Jess' father, who turns out to have some of his own personal demons to deal with; Shaheen Khan as Jess' mother, who doesn't understand why her daughter can't be content with the pre-ordained life her parents have laid out for her; and Juliet Stevenson as Jules' mother, who proves that Indians don't hold a patent on tradition-obsessed parents.  In its quiet, gentle way, the film also confronts the issue of racism, particularly in terms of how the Indians are often still treated as second-class citizens in British society.As directed by Gurinder Chadha, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a light-on-its-feet ""feel-good"" film that never takes itself too seriously.  The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality, as when, for instance, Jules' parents labor under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers.  The plotting, in addition to being predictable at times, often seems contrived and excessively melodramatic (the rivalry between Jess and Jules over Joe being the primary offender).  But this isn't enough to do any serious damage to the film as a whole.Thus, if you're looking for a film that is easygoing, uplifting and comfortably old-fashioned in its demeanor and theme, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is for you.",3,A Crowd-Pleasing Charmer,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,2943,"['***1/2', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'heartwarming', 'charmer', 'young', 'girl', 'search', 'identity', '21st', 'Century', 'England', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', 'Beckham', 'deals', 'painful', 'struggles', 'tradition-bound', 'cultures', 'must', 'go', 'enter', 'looser', 'more', 'freedom-loving', 'modern', 'world', 'culture', 'case', 'immigrant', 'first-generation', 'Indians', 'living', 'Great', 'Britain', 'such', 'tales', 'young', 'folk', 'who', 'feel', 'need', 'pull', 'away', 'stuffy', 'values', 'past', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'dragging', 'reluctant', 'older', 'folk', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'future', 'right', 'along', 'them.Jess', 'Bharma', 'fairly', 'typical', 'teen', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'world-class', 'soccer', 'player', 'However', 'Jess', 'also', 'very', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'family', 'girl', 'should', 'not', 'play', 'around', 'boys', 'show', 'legs', 'public', 'aspire', 'much', 'marrying', 'good', 'Indian', 'boy', 'raising', 'family', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'set-up', 'countless', 'times', 'Bend', 'Beckam', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'win', 'prizes', 'creativity', 'originality', 'however', 'have', 'youthful', 'exuberance', 'generous', 'spirit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'captivate', 'even', 'most', 'diehard', 'coldhearted', 'cynic', 'Parminder', 'K.', 'Nagra', 'utterly', 'winning', 'young', 'Jess', 'capturing', 'innate', 'optimism', 'unquenchable', 'enthusiasm', 'irrepressible', 'character', 'superb', 'support', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'young', 'old', 'including', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Jules', 'inspirational', 'buddy', 'who', 'Jess', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'dreams', 'fruition', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Joe', 'handsome', 'young', 'coach', 'who', 'lessons', 'love', 'lessons', 'soccer', 'Anupam', 'Kher', 'Jess', 'father', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'deal', 'Shaheen', 'Khan', 'Jess', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'daughter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'content', 'pre-ordained', 'life', 'parents', 'have', 'laid', 'out', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Jules', 'mother', 'who', 'Indians', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'patent', 'tradition-obsessed', 'parents', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'way', 'film', 'also', 'issue', 'racism', 'particularly', 'terms', 'how', 'Indians', 'are', 'often', 'still', 'treated', 'second-class', 'citizens', 'British', 'society.As', 'directed', 'Gurinder', 'Chadha', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'light-on-its-feet', 'feel-good', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'movie', 'bit', 'sitcom', 'mentality', 'when', 'instance', 'Jules', 'parents', 'labor', 'illusion', 'daughter', 'Jess', 'are', 'actually', 'lesbian', 'lovers', 'plotting', 'addition', 'being', 'predictable', 'times', 'often', 'contrived', 'excessively', 'melodramatic', 'rivalry', 'Jess', 'Jules', 'Joe', 'being', 'primary', 'offender', ""n't"", 'enough', 'do', 'serious', 'damage', 'film', 'whole.Thus', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'easygoing', 'uplifting', 'comfortably', 'old-fashioned', 'demeanor', 'theme', 'Bend', 'Beckham']",Bend It Like Beckham
612048,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00005JM2Y,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[4, 4]","A friend in London (England, not Ontario) convinced me that I had to see ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" (along with praise from Sundance and the Toronto Film Festival) so lo and behold, one dreary spring day I stepped into a surprisingly crowded theatre (I wasn't sure of a British comedy's marketability in North America). ""BILB"" proved every bit as wonderful as my friend said, and in a nutshell is a sort of cross between ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""Jess, a Londoner of Asian descent, plays football in secret since her parents strictly forbid it and want her to grow into a nice, traditional Sikh girl who can cook a full Punjabi dinner. Jess, however, has other plans. She teams up with Jules (short for Juliet), a fellow footballer, and the team coach Joe and an American scout eagerly appraises the two. Along the way Jess has to survive her sister's frantic, bipolar engagement and wedding, come clean to her parents about her joining the team, fights over her blossoming romance, and learns to follow her heart. Jess confides her worries to her David Beckham poster that hangs over her bed. Her room is filled with Beckham memorabilia. Jules' mother is similarly against her daughter playing football, convinced that she must be a lesbian since she favours sports bras, has short hair and wears boyish clothes. The two girls hang out often, finding more similarities than differences, but when Jess nearly kisses Joe, Jules is furious, having eyed him for herself, and a stony rivalry ensues.The film is doused with Indian culture, including saris, salwar kameez, samosas, Bollywood musicals, singing game shows, bhangra rock, and more, but always finds a more or less comfortable balance between Indian and London cultures. The unbelievably colourful, extravagant wedding was one of my favourite highlights of the film since I adore bhangra rock and Bollywood. The soundtrack is similarly influenced, with many Indian pop songs, and my favourite of all, ""The Power of Love"" cover (Sitam version) by Amar. The cinematography is at times used for comedic effect, as in rapid cutaways to see the dazed/shocked/delighted expression of parents and relatives, in dizzying, rapid-fire football matches, the colourful exuberance of the Indian wedding, the sizzling energy of a German nightclub, and at times timed shots to capture the beauty of day turning into dusk.The movie is blessed with a strong cast, a great story, and characters that draw you into their worlds, worries, and triumphs, not to mention a catchy soundtrack, great football action, and a tender romance. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" will certainly join my other honoured favourites such as ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" Oh, and look for a ""There's Something About Mary""-like singalong/bloopers during the credits.

Meanwhile, Juliet is resisting her mother's wishes of wearing more feminine clothes and dating boys while fearing her daughter might be a lesbian.

Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the positive word of mouth.The movie is not without charm. There are moments of humor. It's well-acted and all the cast  seems well-suited for the roles they've been given. The focus on Sikh culture was mildly interesting and a good focal point for some of the humor.The problem is the storyline is incredibly predictable. I kept waiting for the story to make a tangent, any tangent, from the standard formula where everything the main character wants is achieved in the end including an unlikely dream coming true and getting the attractive young man to desire her. The contrivance of parents who stand in the way of both as the source of main dramatic tension is also standard formula stuff.If you like to watch movies where the protagonist has fantasy goals and a possible unrequited love but gets a fairytale perfect ending (including parents who do a complete turnaround and magically turn accepting and supportive), this would be a good movie for you.

It's quite dull and painfully repetitive, leaving us to count down the minutes until the plot reruns itself for the umpteenth time.When the plot's not stuck in its loop, it's busy cramming in limp situations and characters. Jess' family is presented as a near-exaggeration that makes the parents of My Big Fat Greek Wedding look downplayed. Not just the Indian family, even the mother of Jess' british friend, played by Juliet Stevenson, is convinced that push-ups bras and short skirts, not shin pads and cleats, are the only way to attract a man. Both families feature the old standby of Lone Understanding Parent -- trusting, sympathetic dads -- who both exist merely to convince their grumbling spouse to give the kids a break, but only, of course, in time for the Big Finish.On the plus side, the director succeeded in evoking a workable level of charm from the cast and the roles they play, and it's easy to see why so many people have come to like this film.  It's hard not to like these characters.  Plus, both Nagra and Knightley have the good looks, natural charisma, and honest acting talent that makes a person a bona fide movie star. The soundtrack is cool too except for that Punjabi music at the wedding that played on for a tad too long.Yet, on the whole it winds up being a formulaic mess, not very rousing, not very interesting, and at the end of it all, not all that much fun.

This is a smart, funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for. I urge every mother to give her daughter this DVD for a birthday, Christmas or graduation gift.

She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie; I don't want to give too much away THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL.I love this movie; this is how movies should be made.

The youngest daughter of the Family Bhamra (Anupam Kher & Shaheen Khan), Jess is disobedient to her parents and the traditional, old school ways of Sikh.Jess just happens to be a very gifted football (soccer) player and hatches a plan to go behind her parents backs to play on the London girl's professional football team along with her friend and teammate Juliette 'Jules' Paxton, played by Keira Knightley. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Joe, the dreamy football coach that both of the girls fall for and fight over.But, as the girl's team starts to gain some media attention, Jess's secret can't be kept forever!Mr. Bhamra tries to hammer home to Jess that a Sikh is measured by his quality and NOT quantity that he is a small or a big man. So, in a Sikh, it is what comes out of his mouth that matters as it reflects the quality of learning. Disobedience, lying, and above all, interracial relationships are NOT ALLOWED!Mrs. Bhamra only prays for her youngest daughter to be a normal Sikh young woman, betrothed to a good Sikh young man, and of course, hopes that she can cook a good Aloo Gobi.

So if you haven't seen it, know that this is a fun and enjoyable movie, but not a truly great film as many would have you believe.Two minor criticisms:  First, there were a couple of scenes where my American ears had a hard time understanding The Queen's Englsh being spoken so rapidly (even after rewinding and cranking the volume).

Which is why I simply love Fox Searchlight studios: they've created movies that drop from indie heaven, and they are a fine studio. Bend it Like Beckham is in no way any exception: it's funny, smart, dramatic, special, and gives you that feel-good feeling inside. Parminder Nagra, an actress I have never seen act anywhere else, plays the Indian teenager Jess living in England with a passion for football (for us Americans, soccer). Her parents say otherwise, though, and she ends up lying and cheating out of her culture just so she can follow her dreams of one day playing professional. Her idol in life is David Beckham, much to her parents disprove. Almost in every way this girl is a rebel, and that's partly why the movie is so great. She will stop at nothing to make sure her dream is realized. Now, why, you ask, is a movie about that so appealing? Well, that's a question you'll need to see it to properly understand the answer to. The movie delivers a powerful, almost controversial message: your dreams are the most important things in your life. Put nothing ahead of them, and follow them until they come true in every way you originally imagined them to. This is a good movie to watch along with the recent film ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" as they both deliver the same message, and are both produced by Fox Searchlight, simply the BEST in indie film producing today.

612058,A37F8W82A1E6L7,B00005JM2Y,Stephen Cords,"[1, 1]","Well, my wife and I loved this little British flick.  We popped it in New Years Eve and laughed for the entire time; even harder during the closing credits.  It is refreshing to see a movie where the young folks love and respect their parents to the point where they are willing to make sacrifices to make them happy.  I look at teens in American comedies and hope that the people writing them will go see films like Bend it for some inspiration.The minute I pulled the flick out and put it back in it's case I turned to my wife and made the observation that my 10 year old niece would love this flick.  (I try and make it a point to pass on discs and books to her that I think will challenge her a bit yet still entertain.)  Wifey stopped for a moment, thought about it and then said that she probably would.  For the life of me I couldn't figure out why she had to think about it for a moment.  As I read some of the other reviews here it hit me.Beckham is a wonderful story.  It is inspirational without being sappy, has wonderfully engaging characters and is wildly funny.  The girls are strong and capable without crossing the line into that brazen, in your face, nasty attitude that predominates a lot of American productions.  The message is simple but it's execution is not.  Follow your dreams, but do everything you can to not hurt those around you while you do it.  It can be a very fine line to walk.The only thing that might turn some parents away is the use of homosexuality as a plot point.  Juliet's mother fears her daughter may be a lesbian, that Jess may be her lover and another character comes out of the closet to a close friend.  This won't upset a lot of free thinkers out there, but there are definately some parents who are not ready to explain to their kids why Juliet's mom is so upset that Jess gave her a kiss or why that other character is afraid to talk about their own preferences within their circle of friends.My niece was born in Provincetown MA (San Franscisco East Coast, but smaller) and spent her life surrounded by gay men.  She and her mother have no problems talking about these things.  If however, you don't feel that you or your child are able to reasonably discuss these themes then hold off until you are.  Once you get to that point though, Beckham would be a great place to start.  It handles the issues with great humor and taste.Five stars out of Five.

612059,A27A3AZA7L12N6,B00005JM2Y,Stephen M. Bauer,"[4, 5]","Watch it!  It's about a teenage Indian girl in England who has a talent and passion for soccer and wants to play at the highest levels.  The problem is her Sikh parents are appalled and opposed to their daughter's desires.  They want her to behave like a traditional Sikh girl of her mother's generation back in India.The film moves fast and has more than enough background components to keep is stimulating.We first see Jess, the Sikh girl, playing pickup soccer with the men.  She has a friend-confident among the men who later confides to her that he is gay.  An ""Anglo"" British girl, Jules, recruits Jess to play on a competitive girl's team.  The girls become good friends but end up estranged for a while because both girls have more than a crush on their male soccer coach.  The soccer coach is Irish, which leads to a good twist or two, this being England.  Jules' mother overhears Jess and Jules talking heatedly about this love.  A Sikh woman spots Jess and Jules talking together and mistakenly thinks they were kissing.  Both sides-Jules mother and Jess's family think they are having a lesbian affair.  Jess's sister is engaged to be married.  Jess's un-Sikh like activities cause the family some disgrace, which threatens the sister's engagement.  The Sikh wedding is an uproarious, opulent, and fairly sensual affair.Jess drew great empathy from me.  I was pulling for her the whole way.  The film makes you want to run out on a field and kick soccer ball into the goal.The dialogue in the film is in a heavy British accent and often fast.  You will have to pay close attention if you like to catch all the dialogue, like I do.  The only thing that lacked credibility was the actress who played Jules.  Her acting was fine, but she looked too much like a model.  For a girl jock, her high-glamour lipstick looked ridiculous, and her body looked like anything but an athlete's.  There are many scenes where she is shown bare midriff (wearing a soccer/sports bra), and she is such skin-and-bones, she looks ridiculous.  The actress could never have played sports in her life.You will like the movie if you have daughters that like sports, or if you just like sports, relate to cultural  conflicts, or relate to conflicts between teenagers and their parents.  My son Andrew (10) liked it because it was about soccer.  Michael  (8) likes soccer, but his attention wandered.  If you are a parent, don't worry about the mention of homosexuality.  It's very understated, and I discovered (to my dismay, of course)  that my children already know about such things.  If my kids know, your kids know.The movie is fun, more than it is funny.  There is a little more emphasis on drama, than, say, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but Bend It Like Beckam does have a happy ending.  It is a warm triumph of the human spirit.The ""Lindy"" (my wife) Litmus test:  Pass.  She watched the movie all the way through with great interest.

It's high-energy fun, a teen flick without too much stupid silliness or any of those contrived ""misunderstandings"" that are so common in comedies. The teen characters are irresistibly cute, the culture clashes are funny and not overdone, and the soccer scenes are exciting (I wish there were more of them).But if the messages in this movie about ""girl power"" and following your dreams are going to be taken half seriously, then there's much to criticize. Most of the Indian girls and boys seem obsessed with sex, shopping, and early marriage. The girls lie to their parents time and time again. And what does it really say about girl power when the main character, Jess, as a beautiful, extremely talented soccer player, can win a sport scholarship to an American university? Are beautiful, extremely talented girls the only ones then who can hope to exercise ""girl power""? Jess doesn't have to work hard to acquire her soccer skills. She didn't even play on her high school team! And yet she is better than all the other talented girls who have worked hard for years, been coached, and played on teams. Everything comes so easy for Jess that it's easier to attribute her success to pure luck than to hard work or girl power.On the other hand, besides being blessed and lucky Jess is sweet and level-headed.

These films typically fly under the mainstream radar and depend upon word of mouth to build public awareness of their existence.  Most filmgoers will never see them as they opt for glitzier event films and star vehicles but this is their loss for they will miss out on wonderful treasures like Gurinder Chadha's &quot;Bend It Like Beckham.&quot;Jesminder &quot;Jess&quot; Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra) is a young Indian teen who lives in England.  She has tremendous soccer skills which have gone unappreciated by her traditional parents.  One day Jess catches the attention of Juliette &quot;Jules&quot; Paxton (Keira Knightley) as she plays soccer in the park with her friends.  Jules recruits Jess for a woman's soccer team called the Hounslow Harriers and suddenly the two of them hatch a plot to keep Jess' participation on the team secret.  As she spends more time with the team, Jess becomes attracted to her coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) but matters become complicated because Jules also has feelings for him.  Eventually Jess' parents learn of her exploits and are forced to reassess their plans for their daughter's future.&quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; overflows with charm, energy, and wit from start to finish.  The film includes some thought-provoking commentaries on traditional and cultural attitudes but never becomes too dramatic for its own good.

The supporting performances by Rhys-Meyers, Anupam Kher, Shaheen Khan, and Juliet Stevenson are all solid and perfectly complement the two leads.  &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; is solid evidence that good things sometimes do come in small packages.

While I enjoy sports and really tried to like soccer, but alas, I don't care for the sport. However, the focus here is not so much the game as it is the character's dream to play it without compromising her family's traditions.Jess is a teenaged Indian girl living in England whose older sister is getting married. Though it is a ""love match"", the wedding and all that leads up to it is very traditional Indian, for these ethnic families resist being Anglicized at every turn. Jess is a talented soccer player, which is decidedly unladylike, especially for a girl that according to her mother, should be worried about finding a nice Indian boy to marry.Jess, encouraged by newfound friend, Juliette, joins a soccer team on the sly. From this point forward, we see poor Jess try to juggle her wishes and those of her family's in an entirely realistic manner that was rather unexpected in a film of this genre. Anyone with an ethnic background can relate to her experiences as well as to her family.It is hilarious to see the misunderstandings, Jess getting busted at every turn, and the promise of a forbidden love. Everyone is this film delivers a strong performance, and rather than turning this into a soccer movie, it turns into a movie whose theme focuses more on living for oneself.I would say that having seen this on DVD and having been privy to deleted scenes, my only gripe, and it's a minor one, is that the scene in which Pinky (the older sister) and Jess discuss marriage should have been kept in. This scene humanizes the often backstabbing and shallow seeming Pinky. However, painting her as a complete witch is not a terrible thing either.Overall, this is a thoroughly entertaining, funny film.

And to some extent that's true, but there's much more that's tackled as well.Ok first off the Title - David Beckham is to Soccer (or Football as non-Americans call it) as Michael Jordan is to Basketball. (He's also Posh Spice's husband, but that's besides the point for this movie).The movie is basically about a British-Indian girl's struggle to achieve her dream - to play professional football, and yet still somehow balance her other priorities. But along the way the movie also helps smash a few cultural stereotypes, gives a pro-feminist message and manages to make you laugh out loud all in the space of two hours. What I loved best about this movie is that all the people in it were so real, and so normal, and also how the drama/melodrama was kept to a bare minimum. I also liked how the semi-conservative Indian father's objection to his daughter playing was not that she was a girl or that she was Indian but that he felt that there would be too much struggle. Or how it's not just the conservative Indian family which has problems with their daughter playing soccer but also the English family as well  - ""There's a reason Sporty Spice is the only one without a fella"". This movie was a hit in England, and also in India, where people of both countries felt that it hit really close to home. Hope you Americans enjoy it too.

612069,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JM2Y,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Bend it like Beckham"" is a very charming film about two girls in England, Jess an Jules, both of them aspiring to be football players.  But the only problem is, that Jess Bhamra, who dreams of playing football with her idol David Beckham, belongs to a family moved from India, and the mother and father are not happy about her decision.  And there are more events of life to come, which would eventually make the whole things much complicated, and that is a handsome coach named Joe who helps Jess persue her way.Culture-clashing comedy in UK is nothing new -- we have already seen ""East is East"" -- but what ""Bend it like Beckham"" offers is its charming leading roles played by Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley.  Most incredibly, Keira Knightley was in one of the most commercially successful film called ""Star Wars: Episode I,"" but, none of us probably remember her.  (The reason concerns the way George Lucas used her, which I shouldn't disclose, so check it out for yourself.)  What Hollywood people missed is here revealed fully on the screen -- in short, these girls are radiating with their natural charms, which are simply irrestible.The story is full of familiar moments and devices, we have to admit.  But the fresh charms of the likable and lovable characters, and surprisingly effective turn from Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Velvet Goldmine"" and others) as understanding Coach Joe (cast against type) help greatly to make us forget some of the minor flaws found in the script (Juliet Stevenson's mother's portrayal is often embarrasing, for instance), and as a whole the film goes on always pleasantly.  You will know, after a few minutes, that you cannot hate this film at all.The only complaint is its title, which might sound a little incomprehensible to non-football fans (and in that case you might not notice the cameos of ex-pro-footballers like Gary Lineker, former ace striker of England); well, but if you know  a bit about this sport, you see the meaning of the title and its implication.  David Beckham, star player of Manchester United (and husband to one of the Spice Girls), is so good at doing a freekick, and his techinique to bend the ball's course is really amazing.  Like him, Jess changes her ball's course as is depicted in the film, and possibly her life, too.",4,Girls Rule!

Oh well, here goes anyway...This movie is caked with so many cliches, it ruined the strong potential it had. The Indian girl with a severe burn-mark on her leg, falls in love with her Irish coach, who also happens to have a harsh scar on his leg. And it just so happens, that the Indian girl's best friend is in love with the coach. You can guess what comes next. Jealousy, bickering, and everything else. Meanwhile, the Indian girl is also battling her psychotically religious parents. Her mom is the typical of all stereotypes (I'm not even gonna bother going into the predictable intentions of this old wench. It's the basic ""don't bring shame on the family, blahblahblah, women cook this for the husband, blahblahblah, be a good Indian girl and do what your parents tell you, blahblahblah, you can't play Football, blahblahblah, marry an Indian boy, blahblahblah, don't show your bare legs to millions of people, blahblahblah""). Her father, ALSO played a sport, once upon a time (How convenient for US, eh?). Unfortunately, he was kicked out of a club and made fun of for, get this, wearing a turban. So, since the whites rejected him (because of a turban, no less), he thinks he knows what's best for his little girl.This family has more than its fair-share of issues. As things start to heat up (at BOILING point) all you can do is duck and cover. What we're treated to, is disputes, lies, deception, racism, homosexuality, suspicion of homosexuality, accusations and everything else you can think of. Oh yeah, and guess what! The sister's wedding is the EXACT SAME DAY AS THE BIG GAME! Hey, who DIDN'T see that one coming? Ugh! And don't you just hate when someone walks in on 2 people JUST as they're about to kiss? It happens here. And not only that, as an encore to that sickening cliche, the father walks in on his daughter hugging her coach. These predictable paths have become so tiring, that it pretty much destroyed my enjoyment for the movie. And let's not forget the obligatory Indian wedding... cause afterall, no Indian movie is truly complete without one.I saw the final act coming a mile away, too. Everything all wrapped up in a neat little package.And let me just finish this review up nice and quick by saying Jess' mother gives the most HORRIBLE, DREADFUL, DISGUSTINGLY ANNOYING performance of the last century. Her over-the-top approach dents every scene she's in.I hate to give this film such a low rating, because I DID see a LOT of potential. It's all pretty much wasted, in my opinion.

612074,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005JM2Y,William Hare,"[2, 5]","Parminder Nagra is an attractive, energetic 18-year-old young Indian woman living in the West London suburb of Hounslow, near Heathrow Airport and about thirty minutes by Tube from the West End.  She lives comfortably with her family and is a good enough student so that her parents are strongly encouraging her to go to law school, then marry a nice Indian young man and start a family, the same path her older, about to be married sister, is ready to traverse.Nagra's bedroom is covered with photos of football great (soccer to U.S. fans) David Beckham.  What her parents do not know is that she is more than a fan of the great player; she is a talented performer in her own right.  When Keira Knightley visits the park where Nagra performs brilliantly against a group of Indian young men, she recruits her for the local women's team.When Nagra makes the team and becomes a star player under Irish coach Jonathan Rhys Meyers, she does more than take a major step toward developing her football skills at a higher level of competition.  She feels an immediate affinity for Rhys Meyers, whose own budding career was dashed by an injury.  Like herself, he has had to contend with a strong-willed father.A clash with Knightley, the person who got her the tryout, occurs when the team travels to Hamburg, Germany for a match.  Despite not wanting to get emotionally involved with Rhys Meyers due to Knightley's obvious romantic interest in the coach, the chemistry blends and Knightley catches them during a romantic moment, considering her friend a turncoat.The plot develops toward a final championship match at Hounslow, which is held the same day as Nagra's older sister's wedding.  Her father allows her to sneak away to compete in the match, just as long as she is there for the rest of the big day in her sister's life.  Nagra needs to overcome an earlier sturdy opposition of a father who is opposed to her pursuing football glory due to his own disappointment, occasioned by racism.  As a young man he arrived in England from his native India, and ultimately believed he was not given a proper chance to develop his own athletic skills.The briskly paced film, directed by Gurinder Chadha, who wrote the script with Paul Mayeda Berges and Guljit Bindra, moves to a satisfactory conclusion in which Nagra and Knightley become friends again.The highly talented Juliet Stevenson is excellent in a supporting role as Knightley's mother, seeking to steer her daughter through disappointment in her love live while disdaining her vigorous pursuit of football.  In that area she holds a common view with Nagra's parents, at least until the story is resolved.David Beckham appears late in the film in a scene shot at Heathrow Airport.  Nagra and Knightley share a laugh over the irony at seeing their hero as they prepare to depart for their own football adventures in America.",5,Growing Up Amid a Cultural Divide,1062979200,"09 8, 2003",2003,2874,"['Parminder', 'Nagra', 'attractive', 'energetic', '18-year-old', 'young', 'Indian', 'woman', 'living', 'West', 'London', 'suburb', 'Hounslow', 'Heathrow', 'Airport', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Tube', 'West', 'End', 'comfortably', 'family', 'good', 'enough', 'student', 'so', 'parents', 'are', 'strongly', 'encouraging', 'go', 'law', 'school', 'then', 'marry', 'nice', 'Indian', 'young', 'man', 'start', 'family', 'same', 'path', 'older', 'be', 'married', 'sister', 'ready', 'traverse.Nagra', 'bedroom', 'covered', 'photos', 'football', 'great', 'soccer', 'U.S.', 'fans', 'David', 'Beckham', 'What', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'more', 'fan', 'great', 'player', 'talented', 'performer', 'own', 'right', 'When', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'park', 'where', 'Nagra', 'brilliantly', 'group', 'Indian', 'young', 'men', 'local', 'women', 'team.When', 'Nagra', 'team', 'star', 'player', 'Irish', 'coach', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'more', 'take', 'major', 'step', 'developing', 'football', 'skills', 'higher', 'level', 'competition', 'immediate', 'affinity', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'own', 'budding', 'career', 'was', 'dashed', 'injury', 'had', 'contend', 'strong-willed', 'father.A', 'clash', 'Knightley', 'person', 'who', 'got', 'tryout', 'when', 'team', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'match', 'not', 'wanting', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'due', 'Knightley', 'obvious', 'romantic', 'interest', 'coach', 'chemistry', 'blends', 'Knightley', 'catches', 'romantic', 'moment', 'considering', 'friend', 'turncoat.The', 'plot', 'final', 'championship', 'match', 'Hounslow', 'held', 'same', 'day', 'Nagra', 'older', 'sister', 'wedding', 'father', 'sneak', 'away', 'compete', 'match', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'there', 'rest', 'big', 'day', 'sister', 'life', 'Nagra', 'overcome', 'earlier', 'sturdy', 'opposition', 'father', 'who', 'opposed', 'pursuing', 'football', 'glory', 'due', 'own', 'disappointment', 'occasioned', 'racism', 'young', 'man', 'arrived', 'England', 'native', 'India', 'ultimately', 'believed', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'proper', 'chance', 'develop', 'own', 'athletic', 'skills.The', 'briskly', 'paced', 'film', 'directed', 'Gurinder', 'Chadha', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'Paul', 'Mayeda', 'Berges', 'Guljit', 'Bindra', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion', 'Nagra', 'Knightley', 'become', 'again.The', 'highly', 'talented', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'role', 'Knightley', 'mother', 'seeking', 'steer', 'daughter', 'disappointment', 'love', 'live', 'disdaining', 'vigorous', 'pursuit', 'football', 'area', 'common', 'view', 'Nagra', 'parents', 'least', 'story', 'resolved.David', 'Beckham', 'late', 'film', 'scene', 'shot', 'Heathrow', 'Airport', 'Nagra', 'Knightley', 'share', 'laugh', 'irony', 'seeing', 'hero', 'prepare', 'depart', 'own', 'football', 'adventures', 'America']",Bend It Like Beckham

They all focused quite a bit on the mother-daughter relationship.  &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; garnered the most attention, of course.  &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot; was a sweet look at a Latin-American girl's coming of age.  And &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; presents a similar story from an Indian perspective.As a man who has been thinking a lot about the father-son relationship (now that I'm a father) over the past two years, I HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE MOVIES AS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT INTO THE MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP.All three are refreshing triumphs of the female spirit against the subservience demanded of women by their cultures.  Yet all three heroines ultimately respect the cultures.  They (for the most part) successfully change their families' views on women through choosing to follow their dreams.  They do so in a way that respects and holds onto their respective culture's emphasis on family, while rejecting the dominance of men.&quot;BECKHAM&quot; IS MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE.  &quot;Greek Wedding&quot; is the funniest. &quot;Real Women&quot; is the most realistic.  In that movie, the mother actually rejects the daughter, and we end with a view of the daughter moving on in life.  We hope that a reconciliation will occur; but we are excited that the young woman has moved on with her life.BECKHAM has a lot of the humor of &quot;Greek Wedding&quot; but presents the family conflict in a more realistic way, like &quot;Real Women&quot;.
