1467707,A2WI2RBREBP7LJ,B005LAIH2W,001,"[17, 49]","A very bad screenplay adaptation of the novel.A very bad movie in general.pro:- Effects are generally good, except for the main Mars alien face designs which look cartoony in an otherwise realistic world.con:- Poor overblown acting once the story gets to mars... which is 95% of the film.- EXTREMELY bad script with non-stop unlikely plot driven coincidences.  Nothing that happens in the film naturally 'leads' to anything else-- plot events just happen one after another strung together by impossible coincidences.- Bad TV style editing and camera angles.- Relentless BG soundtrack, which is so overblown that it becomes distracting.- Also surprisingly BORING since the viewer doesn't care about the characters or what is going on despite all the ridiculous cartoony action, which is a killer for a movie of this length.-story summary: Bad guy is bad, good guy is good, there is no character development.  Everyone in the movie takes a turn at beating up the good guy like a roadrunner cartoon-- this is supposed to generate sympathy for his plight/struggle-- but since the good guy is obviously invincible it doesn't matter.  And on Mars a giant mars-frog-dog runs in super-sonically and licks the good guy's face after each time he gets beat up-- which is supposed to be funny.  Eventually people stop beating up the good guy, good guy falls in love with the cute Mars Princess after about three days and marries her, and the bad guy dies.  Good guy accidentally teleports back to Earth, spends the next 10 years becoming a billionaire and trying to teleport back to Mars, which takes about 5 minutes of screen time-- he succeeds.

But I just want to comment on how fantastic the film looks on Blu-ray hi-def.  John Carter is that rare film which combines an intelligent and entertaining story with state-of-the-art visual effects.  Truly, it is a feast for the eyes.  If you're among those movie lovers who is still holding out on upgrading to Blu-ray, this is the movie that should convince you.The bonus features are also plentiful--which I found a pleasant surprise, given the lukewarm box-office performance--and really do a lot to enhance one's enjoyment of the film.  There's a feature on adapting E.R. Burroughs' original stories to the screen, and John Carter's ""journal,"" which can be viewed simultaneously with the film.  There are even some amusing ""Barsoom Bloopers"" and a featurette on the amazing special effects.""John Carter"" should have been the Star Wars of a new generation.  And by the way, when I say ""Star Wars"" I'm talking about the original 1977 film.  Watching JC in the theater, I really felt the way I did watching George Lucas's original flight of space fantasy way back when.

Mostly based on two facts: the critics hated it and it was a box office bomb.  That said, my teenage son borrowed it from his friend and after I told him what a bomb it was, he said that his grandma (my mom) said it was really good.  Not wanting to waste over two hours of my time, I came here to look up the reviews which were very good.  After the first 15-20 minutes I was hooked!  I thought the Tharks and Therns (?) were quite interesting races.  I loved the amazement they all had of John Carter and his jumping abilities.  And of course what kind of girl would I be if I didn't enjoy a bit of love interest.  My son thought the ""dog"" (or whatever it was) was very cool.  I keep wondering why this movie did so poorly at the box office and all I can think of, aside from poor critics reviews, is that they should have given it a different title.  The title ""John Carter"" is too main stream for a sci-fi movie.  I'm thinking ""Return to Bardoom"" would have been a better title...but that's just me.

Amazingly, the trailers that promoted JC's original release contained the *dullest frames* of the entire picture - making it appear to be a CGI snoozefest like Transformers.

This discovery soon led me to the ""John Carter: Warlord of Mars"" comic that Marvel was publishing at the time, and in a short couple of months I was immersed in the amazing artwork of Frank Frazetta, as well as the original pulp stories and novels by authors like Robert E. Howard, and of course, Edgar Rice Burroughs.  1977 also marked the premiere of a little known film at the time called ""Star Wars"".  I have often said over the last 35 years that the first time I saw ""Star Wars"" was the single best time I've ever had at the movies, and while there have certainly been a lot of great films in the last three decades, I was convinced that movies simply didn't have the power to make me feel like that again.  I was wrong.  ""John Carter"" managed to do what I thought was impossible: make me feel like that wide-eyed 11 year old kid again.  It goes without saying that I've been waiting for this film for 35 years, but it was worth the wait.  ""John Carter"" exceeded - no, shattered - my expectations.The original ""Princess of Mars"" is one of my favorite novels of all time.  I've read it so many times over the last three decades that I've lost count, and while some Edgar Rice Burroughs fans were disappointed or even outraged at the deviations from the original source material, in my humble opinion the changes were in most of not all cases justified.  Bob Clampett, the first person who tried to get a John Carter film off the ground in the 1930s, said this about his meetings with Burroughs: ""Edgar was smart enough to understand that one couldn't just literally translate his Mars books page by page into animation; it just would not be cinematic. So, he gave me a great deal of freedom to dream up and be inspired by his writing and develop a cartoon story on my own.""  While ERB was a tremendously gifted author, his works aren't without flaws, and they're a bit dated; there's very little moral ambiguity, he often recycles his own plot twists, and his plots often rely on coincidence.  Additionally, ERB's heroes tend to be sort of Mary Sue characters with no visible physical or moral flaws. I can't see how John Carter or Ulysses Paxton or Cathoris or Gahan would behave differently in the similar circumstances.  So I can see why Stanton chose to give John Carter some personal angst and some character development in order to sell him to modern audiences.  Some have argued that Stanton's changes have rendered a character unrecognizable to fans of the original novels, but I would ask them ""what characteristics define John Carter as a character?""  There's the physical characteristics: black hair (though it's closely cropped in the original novels...no biggie), heightened strength and agility, fairly tall, good looking, in excellent physical health, and agelessness. Although the last characteristic was not overtly stated in the film, it was highly suggested, if people pay attention to the subtle clues in the film. How could Carter, a man who appears to be about the age of thirty (as in the novel) possibly have been able to hold ERB on his knee when ERB was a child and tell him about his wild adventures all over the world? Was Carter doing this as a teenager? And then there's the fact that Carter doesn't age at all during the ten bitter years exiled back on Earth, when the effects wizards could easily have accomplished this with some rudimentary makeup effects.Then there's Carter's personality: Fearless, willing to throw himself in harm's way against impossible odds; selfless, willing to lay down his life for others; Carter behaves consistent with these characteristics throughout the film, even while he's giving lip service to ""only caring about his cave of gold"". He rescues Powell from the Apaches when he could have just left him to die; when he sees the air battle between Zodanga and Helium, he expresses his innate sense of justice and fairness with the remark ""That don't look like a fair fight!"" and then he throws himself into the thick of the battle when he spots Dejah (whom he doesn't even know) in imminent danger.Some argue that the dead wife and child back-story and Carter's initial reluctance to get involved transform Carter into a character unrecognizable to ERB fans, but I disagree.  I saw a character onscreen that was TRYING not to be noble and selfless because of a personal loss, but was failing at it, and I think the dichotomy enriched the story and drove home the values that were important to Burroughs.  This point is driven home by Dejah Thoris, who sees through the wall he's built around himself. My favorite line of the film: ""We may be worlds apart, but I know you, John Carter. From the moment you caught me out of the sky, I knew. I felt the heart of a man willing to lay down his life for others"". That fits ERB's character to a tee.  Without the back-story, that line would not have worked....which brings us to the character changes to Dejah Thoris.  The main difference is the fact that this Dejah Thoris can actually fight, but I can't believe in this post Princess Leia, post Sarah Conner, post Ripley world that either ERB fans or film fans in general were expecting anything less, or would accept a Dejah Thoris who is physically helpless. This concept was outdated even in the late seventies when Marv Wolfman and Chris Clairemont were penning the ""John Carter: Warlord of Mars"" comics, and even then, having read the original novels during the same time period, I welcomed this enhancement. One has to remember that when ""A Princess of Mars"" was written in the early 20th Century, women were supposed to be prim and proper at all times, and ""respectable"" women rarely even worked out of the home. They didn't even have the right to vote. A woman who was basically helpless to the whims of the man who controlled her (either her father or husband) was the norm rather than the exception. Such outdated conventions would never work in a modern film, unless it was a period piece specifically made to highlight such inequality.The Therns are much more powerful in the film than in the original novels. But the Therns in Burroughs' novels are actually pretty weak when their secrets are exposed, and ERB never really went anywhere with them, other than to have their leader kidnap Dejah Thoris and flee from John Carter (continuously). Burroughs' original concept is compelling, but I think for the sake of drama one must make the ""bad guys"" much more powerful than the good guys so that they have a near insurmountable task to overcome. How are the Therns similar to ERBs? They're using a false religion as a global scam to exploit the entire civilization and keep themselves in power, so the subtext is pretty similar.Zodanga isn't even mentioned in ""A Princess of Mars"" until the last 5th of it, and this simply wouldn't work in a feature film.  But Burroughs original pro-environmental message remains intact.  Barsoom is a dying planet, its oceans have long since dried up, and Zodanga is selfishly consuming the lion's share of the dwindling resources and making war on its neighbors rather than cooperating with them to find a solution. It was Stanton and Chabon's way of making the theme contemporary while still acknowledging the original source material.In summary, I think that overall the film is a much more balanced and coherent narrative than the novel it's based on, and it's remarkably true to the spirit of it, certainly truer than any other ERB adaptation in the last century.  And the pacing and scope of the film, as well as Michael Giacchino's magnificent score (that simultaneously manages to channel both John Williams and Basil Poledouris at their best - seriously, this is one of the best soundtracks of all time) bring to mind the classic films of the 70s and 80's, the kinds of films they don't make anymore but you wish they did, like ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  I loved all the actors in their respective roles, and thought Taylor Kitsch was near perfect as John Carter, but the real gem in this film is Lynn Collins' performance as Dejah Thoris. I was initially skeptical when I found out she had been cast as ""the most beautiful woman on two worlds"", but she OWNED the role, both physically and performance wise.  She IS Dejah Thoris.I simply can't recommend this film enough.  After my first viewing, I was numb; on my second, I soaked in and savored every frame of it.  On the third and subsequent viewings, I literally wept at how good it was. The only thing preventing this film from being considered a classic is the fact that not enough people have seen it yet, but that situation will change.  Mark my words: like ""Blade Runner"" and other films that initially met with a cool reception, the decades are going to be kind to ""John Carter"".",5,Made Me Feel Like 11 again,1336780800,"05 12,

1467743,A2KH9KZ2DJMH79,B005LAIH2W,A. Mullen,"[4, 5]","Like a lot of folks, I read the John Carter series as a kid.  Then I read them again as a young adult.  And I re-read them again a few years ago (I'm now in my 50's).  I'd seen the lame attempts at trying to bring ERB's John Carter to the silver screen and kept wondering ""When is a real studio going to take interest in this?""And finally, a ""real"" studio (Disney) has stepped up to the plate and brought the world a worthy adaptation of ERB's John Carter saga.Is it a perfect adaptation?  Nah...But it is pretty close.What didn't work for me:* Many of the longer shots were too tightly framed.  Barsoom needed a sense of greater space.* Taylor Kitsch has adequate acting chops, but the character of John Carter is a hard man.  IMHO, TK just didn't have the gravitas to pull it off effectively.  He was pretty, but I just didn't see hard-won military experience and intense emotional loss in his face.  (This leaves me wondering why the director didn't consider either Mark Strong, Willem Dafoe, or another, more life-experienced actor, since they would have been more effective in portraying JC than Kitsch.  Kitsch's JC really needed a few more miles on him.)* Barsoom was entirely too bright (minor physics queep, I know, but the director/editors should have toned down the day shots to better approximate the actual Mars).* The bromance between Tars Tarkas and JC seemed heavily downplayed.  In the books, these two were fast friends and reliable battle partners.  It was there in this movie, but seemed to be brushed off to the side a bit.* The lead-in segment was 5-10 minutes too long.  It needed to be edited down. (Although I did enjoy the humorous bits.)What did work:* The story: While an obvious blending of different parts of the first two books, as an adaptation, it hung together pretty well.* The technical execution and art direction were first-rate-bordering-on-brilliant, especially the airships.  The other sets, props, and even the Tharks, all had that definite Barsoomian something.  Woola was awesome.* Lynn Collins is the embodiment on Earth of Dejah Thoris in all of her smoldering, fierce, egg-laying glory.* The end segment.  Shorter and more effective at getting JC back to Barsoom.Overall, I thought it was okay, but it just didn't invoke the sense of alien awesomeness that the books do.  I'll definitely buy the BD when it comes out (especially if it has an additional 46 minutes of footage featuring more Dejah...)  I'd definitely like to see a sequel though, to see if the director can round things out a bit more and maybe bring a darker, more adult sensibility to life on Barsoom.  A little less swash and a little more buckle, I'm thinking...BTW, folks that insist on comparing this to Star Wars, Avatar, et al. may certainly be correct in comparing film-to-film.  As for who's deriving from whom though, they should keep in mind that ERB wrote his JC series 100 years ago.  And it's highly unlikely that Star Wars, Avatar, or what-have-you, would even exist in their present forms if ERB's John Carter series had not been written to inspire those stories' creators.",4,"Not without its problems, but I liked it...",1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3102,"['lot', 'folks', 'read', 'John', 'Carter', 'series', 'kid', 'Then', 'read', 'again', 'young', 'adult', 're-read', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'now', '50', ""'d"", 'seen', 'lame', 'trying', 'bring', 'ERB', 'John', 'Carter', 'silver', 'screen', 'kept', 'wondering', 'When', 'real', 'studio', 'going', 'take', 'interest', 'finally', 'real', 'studio', 'Disney', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'brought', 'world', 'worthy', 'adaptation', 'ERB', 'John', 'Carter', 'saga.Is', 'perfect', 'adaptation', 'Nah', 'pretty', 'close.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', '*', 'Many', 'longer', 'shots', 'were', 'too', 'tightly', 'framed', 'Barsoom', 'needed', 'sense', 'greater', 'space', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'adequate', 'acting', 'chops', 'character', 'John', 'Carter', 'hard', 'man', 'IMHO', 'TK', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'gravitas', 'pull', 'off', 'effectively', 'was', 'pretty', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'hard-won', 'military', 'experience', 'intense', 'emotional', 'loss', 'face', 'wondering', 'why', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'more', 'life-experienced', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'portraying', 'JC', 'Kitsch', 'Kitsch', 'JC', 'really', 'needed', 'few', 'more', 'miles', '*', 'Barsoom', 'was', 'entirely', 'too', 'bright', 'minor', 'physics', 'queep', 'know', 'director/editors', 'should', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'day', 'shots', 'better', 'approximate', 'actual', 'Mars', '*', 'bromance', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'JC', 'seemed', 'heavily', 'downplayed', 'books', 'two', 'were', 'fast', 'friends', 'reliable', 'battle', 'partners', 'was', 'there', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'brushed', 'side', 'bit', '*', 'lead-in', 'segment', 'was', '5-10', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'needed', 'be', 'edited', 'down', 'did', 'enjoy', 'humorous', 'bits', 'What', 'did', 'work', '*', 'story', 'obvious', 'blending', 'different', 'parts', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'adaptation', 'hung', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', '*', 'technical', 'execution', 'art', 'direction', 'were', 'first-rate-bordering-on-brilliant', 'especially', 'airships', 'other', 'sets', 'props', 'even', 'Tharks', 'had', 'definite', 'Barsoomian', 'something', 'Woola', 'was', 'awesome', '*', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'embodiment', 'Earth', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'smoldering', 'fierce', 'egg-laying', 'glory', '*', 'end', 'segment', 'Shorter', 'more', 'effective', 'getting', 'JC', 'back', 'Barsoom.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'invoke', 'sense', 'alien', 'awesomeness', 'books', 'do', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'buy', 'BD', 'when', 'out', 'especially', 'additional', '46', 'minutes', 'footage', 'featuring', 'more', 'Dejah', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'like', 'see', 'sequel', 'see', 'director', 'can', 'round', 'things', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'maybe', 'bring', 'darker', 'more', 'adult', 'sensibility', 'life', 'Barsoom', 'little', 'less', 'swash', 'little', 'more', 'buckle', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'BTW', 'folks', 'insist', 'comparing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Avatar', 'et', 'al', 'may', 'certainly', 'be', 'correct', 'comparing', 'film-to-film', 'who', 'deriving', 'whom', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'ERB', 'wrote', 'JC', 'series', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Avatar', 'what-have-you', 'would', 'even', 'exist', 'present', 'forms', 'ERB', 'John', 'Carter', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'written', 'inspire', 'stories', 'creators']",N/A

Bored on a Sunday afternoon, I decided to stream John Carter after reading the reviews here. John Carter is based on the first two Barsoom books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, a wildly popular novelist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century who is best known for the Tarzan novels. His sci-fi fantasy/adventure series was less well known in its time, but like the Tarzan novels is still read.John Carter follows the plot and character development of A Princess of Mars and Gods of Mars far more faithfully than I expected. Granted, the source material isn't Milton, but many a popular novel has been stripped of what complexity it has by the Hollywood machine asumptions that American teens and adults cannot follow even the simplest plot. John Carter keeps the plot intact. The look of the movie is perfect as are the two leads: they look every inch the Barbarian Princess and the Civil War veteran respectively.

The theater I was in was pretty full, the local reviewers were pleasantly indulgent towards it, it wasn't universally reviled or hated by everyone.  Why did it fail so catastrophically?What we have in the movie is basically the quintessential MIGHTY WHITEY action/adventure film, featuring a badass caucasian man placed in a foreign world and becoming the greatest warrior/leader/tap-dancer of them all and bringing peace to the realm.  Considering this story was written around 1917, when those sort of stories were still all the rage (Lord Jim, Robinson Crusoe, etc) there was really nothing they could rightly do, other than to make the helpless natives white too.Pretty much all the common clich&egrave;s and tropes associated with films like Dances With Wolves, James Cameron Presents: Dances With Wolves 2: The Smurfs Edition in 3D, are in this film.  The way it's played straight by all the cast almost puts it beyond reproach; it's less like a tired rehashed story requiring almost no effort to write, and more like the honest, genuine efforts of a first-time writer or filmmaker.  Whether the filmmakers are doing their first movie or not is irrelevant.Simplistic as all the elements are, it's only fair to approach them simplistically, and for a simple story, characters and dialogue are surprisingly good, just on the very brink of being dumb, plodding, but avoiding it either by being sparse and plain, or by sheer earnestness.  Even John Carter stops being a boring little twit at some point in and fits more comfortably into his role (though a better actor would have done marvels).The aliens themselves are at their best when they're utterly unphased by any turn of events, as if what they said was absolutely right; they are not the cause of the disaster and horrors, but simply feeding upon the naturally occurring collapse of civilizations.In all, it's hardly consistent with a catastrophic Hollywood bomb, and certainly deserves more than the sort of money churned by even worse action films like Battleship.",3,An ancient cabal of mysterious aliens conspiring...,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,2154,"['make', 'above', 'average', 'action', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'colossal', 'bombs', 'cinematic', 'history.What', 'hell', 'happened', 'here', 'theater', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'full', 'local', 'reviewers', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'indulgent', 'towards', 'was', ""n't"", 'universally', 'reviled', 'hated', 'everyone', 'Why', 'did', 'fail', 'so', 'catastrophically', 'What', 'have', 'movie', 'basically', 'quintessential', 'MIGHTY', 'WHITEY', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'featuring', 'badass', 'caucasian', 'man', 'placed', 'foreign', 'world', 'becoming', 'greatest', 'warrior/leader/tap-dancer', 'bringing', 'peace', 'realm', 'Considering', 'story', 'was', 'written', '1917', 'when', 'sort', 'stories', 'were', 'still', 'rage', 'Lord', 'Jim', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'etc', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'could', 'rightly', 'do', 'other', 'make', 'helpless', 'natives', 'white', 'too.Pretty', 'much', 'common', 'clich', 'egrave', 's', 'tropes', 'associated', 'films', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Presents', 'Dances', 'Wolves', '2', 'Smurfs', 'Edition', '3D', 'are', 'film', 'way', 'played', 'straight', 'cast', 'almost', 'reproach', 'less', 'tired', 'rehashed', 'story', 'requiring', 'almost', 'effort', 'write', 'more', 'honest', 'genuine', 'efforts', 'first-time', 'writer', 'filmmaker', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'doing', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'irrelevant.Simplistic', 'elements', 'are', 'only', 'fair', 'approach', 'simplistically', 'simple', 'story', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'just', 'very', 'brink', 'being', 'dumb', 'plodding', 'avoiding', 'either', 'being', 'sparse', 'plain', 'sheer', 'earnestness', 'Even', 'John', 'Carter', 'being', 'boring', 'little', 'twit', 'point', 'fits', 'more', 'comfortably', 'role', 'better', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'marvels', '.The', 'aliens', 'are', 'best', 'when', ""'re"", 'utterly', 'unphased', 'turn', 'events', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'absolutely', 'right', 'are', 'not', 'cause', 'disaster', 'horrors', 'simply', 'feeding', 'naturally', 'occurring', 'collapse', 'civilizations.In', 'hardly', 'consistent', 'catastrophic', 'Hollywood', 'bomb', 'certainly', 'more', 'sort', 'money', 'churned', 'even', 'worse', 'action', 'films', 'Battleship']",N/A

1467750,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005LAIH2W,Andre Dursin,"[4, 5]","The subject of countless articles over its stratospheric budget and poor advertising campaign, Disney's JOHN CARTER is poised to generate new fans when the much-ballyhooed picture hits video. In fact, not only is director Andrew Stanton's fantasy a great deal of fun, but it's one central performance shy of being truly spectacular.Adapting Edgar Rice Borroughs' ""A Princess of Mars"" alongside writers Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon, Stanton - a Pixar animator here making his live-action directorial debut - does a fine job working familiar genre conventions into an exciting, occasionally enthralling, otherworldly adventure.John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a former Confederate soldier improbably whisked away to Mars, aka Barsoom, where a civil war rages between the kingdoms of Helium and Zodanga. Complicating matters further is a mysterious, and powerful, beam of energy that the lovely red Martian princess Deja Thoris (Lynn Collins) is close to unlocking the full potential of; in order to stop her, the evil Therns - puppetmasters of the planet - have decided to install one of their minions as King by having him marry Deja. It's up to Carter to stop them, and also navigate the alien wilds of a planet populated with odd creatures, including the insect-like, green Martian ""Tharks,"" who ultimately aid our hero in his quest.Packed with smashing action sequences and likeable characters (as well as a plot that's perhaps a bit too convoluted for its own good), ""John Carter"" is one of those films that its studio, for whatever reason, simply didn't seem to understand. Marketed as an ""edgy"" type of genre vehicle (with anachronistic rock music used in its trailers), the picture is really an old-fashioned, classically constructed fantasy in the obvious vein of, among other influences, ""Star Wars"" (with a dash of ""Dune"" rearing itself, notably in an unused opening to the film where the Princess, staring into the camera, introduces her alien world to the viewer). There are faithful sidekicks (the delightful, canine-like ""Woola""), unlikely allies (the Thark leader, voiced by Willem Dafoe, among them), a good amount of humor and impressive special effects to match.Perhaps Disney took a clue from the movie's central performance in their marketing - the picture's glaring weak point. Kitsch looks like he attended the ""Christian Bale School of Batman Acting"" here, delivering his lines in a hushed, monotone voice and offering not an ounce of charisma in a part that could've been a star-making performance for countless other young actors. Rarely ever cracking a smile, Kitsch's Carter is brooding to the point where you have a hard time understanding what the princess (a lovely performance from Collins) actually sees in him. It's an epic miscalculation that leaves the film with a black hole at its center, and leads one to also wonder why Disney has had such a hard time finding male leads to anchor its recent franchises (the similarly bland Garrett Hedlund was only slightly more effective in ""Tron: Legacy"").Despite Kitsch, ""John Carter"" is still an entertaining cinematic journey of the Saturday matinee variety, anchored by Michael Giacchino's most satisfying score to date and a particularly awesome use of 3-D.Although the film was converted to 3-D in post-production, the movie simply looks amazing in Disney's 3-D Blu-Ray package: depth of field effects are evident in nearly every scene, with crisp detail and almost no ghosting whatsoever that I noticed. The movie manages to maintain its bright visual pallet and come across as demo-worthy material, making the fact that it wasn't actually shot in 3-D a revelation.The package also includes a regular Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copy. Special features include a half-hour look behind the scenes, a brief profile of Borroughs' writing, a commentary with Stanton and fellow crew personnel, bloopers, an optional ""Second Screen"" interactive function, and a number of deleted scenes.I'm not sure ""John Carter"" is ever going to be looked at as a classic, but it certainly doesn't deserve the bad reputation it's been saddled with. Once viewers get a chance to actually see the film and not just base their views based on its negative publicity, it's likely to entertain sci-fi fantasy fans of all ages.",4,Spectacular 3-D in a Movie Much Better than its Reputation Suggests,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,4276,"['subject', 'countless', 'articles', 'stratospheric', 'budget', 'poor', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'Disney', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'poised', 'generate', 'new', 'fans', 'when', 'much-ballyhooed', 'picture', 'video', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'fantasy', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'one', 'central', 'performance', 'shy', 'being', 'truly', 'spectacular.Adapting', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Borroughs', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'alongside', 'writers', 'Mark', 'Andrews', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'Stanton', 'Pixar', 'animator', 'here', 'making', 'live-action', 'directorial', 'debut', 'fine', 'job', 'working', 'familiar', 'genre', 'conventions', 'exciting', 'occasionally', 'enthralling', 'otherworldly', 'adventure.John', 'Carter', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'former', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'improbably', 'whisked', 'away', 'Mars', 'aka', 'Barsoom', 'where', 'civil', 'war', 'rages', 'kingdoms', 'Helium', 'Zodanga', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'further', 'mysterious', 'powerful', 'beam', 'energy', 'lovely', 'red', 'Martian', 'princess', 'Deja', 'Thoris', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'close', 'unlocking', 'full', 'potential', 'order', 'stop', 'evil', 'Therns', 'puppetmasters', 'planet', 'have', 'decided', 'install', 'one', 'minions', 'King', 'having', 'marry', 'Deja', 'up', 'Carter', 'stop', 'also', 'navigate', 'alien', 'wilds', 'planet', 'populated', 'odd', 'creatures', 'including', 'insect-like', 'green', 'Martian', 'Tharks', 'who', 'ultimately', 'aid', 'hero', 'quest.Packed', 'smashing', 'action', 'sequences', 'likeable', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'convoluted', 'own', 'good', 'John', 'Carter', 'one', 'films', 'studio', 'reason', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'Marketed', 'edgy', 'type', 'genre', 'vehicle', 'anachronistic', 'rock', 'music', 'used', 'trailers', 'picture', 'really', 'old-fashioned', 'classically', 'constructed', 'fantasy', 'obvious', 'vein', 'other', 'influences', 'Star', 'Wars', 'dash', 'Dune', 'rearing', 'notably', 'unused', 'opening', 'film', 'where', 'Princess', 'staring', 'camera', 'alien', 'world', 'viewer', 'are', 'faithful', 'sidekicks', 'delightful', 'canine-like', 'Woola', 'unlikely', 'allies', 'Thark', 'leader', 'voiced', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'good', 'amount', 'humor', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'match.Perhaps', 'Disney', 'took', 'clue', 'movie', 'central', 'performance', 'marketing', 'picture', 'glaring', 'weak', 'point', 'Kitsch', 'attended', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'School', 'Batman', 'Acting', 'here', 'delivering', 'lines', 'hushed', 'monotone', 'voice', 'offering', 'not', 'ounce', 'charisma', 'part', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'star-making', 'performance', 'countless', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'Rarely', 'ever', 'cracking', 'smile', 'Kitsch', 'Carter', 'brooding', 'point', 'where', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'princess', 'lovely', 'performance', 'Collins', 'actually', 'epic', 'miscalculation', 'film', 'black', 'hole', 'center', 'one', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'Disney', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'male', 'leads', 'anchor', 'recent', 'franchises', 'similarly', 'bland', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'effective', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '.Despite', 'Kitsch', 'John', 'Carter', 'still', 'entertaining', 'cinematic', 'journey', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'variety', 'anchored', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'most', 'satisfying', 'score', 'date', 'particularly', 'awesome', 'use', '3-D.Although', 'film', 'was', 'converted', '3-D', 'post-production', 'movie', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Disney', '3-D', 'Blu-Ray', 'package', 'depth', 'field', 'effects', 'are', 'evident', 'nearly', 'scene', 'crisp', 'detail', 'almost', 'ghosting', 'noticed', 'movie', 'maintain', 'bright', 'visual', 'pallet', 'come', 'demo-worthy', 'material', 'making', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'shot', '3-D', 'revelation.The', 'package', 'also', 'regular', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'half-hour', 'look', 'scenes', 'brief', 'profile', 'Borroughs', 'writing', 'commentary', 'Stanton', 'fellow', 'crew', 'personnel', 'bloopers', 'optional', 'Second', 'Screen', 'interactive', 'function', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'John', 'Carter', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'looked', 'classic', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'bad', 'reputation', 'been', 'saddled', 'Once', 'viewers', 'get', 'chance', 'actually', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'base', 'views', 'based', 'negative', 'publicity', 'likely', 'entertain', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'fans', 'ages']",N/A

The 3D effects work very well on the small screen and enhance the story rather than distract or detract from it.  This is definitely one of the better 3D movies to get on Blu-Ray.As for the movie itself, the other reviews here do the movie justice--this is a good, nearly great, movie that should have done much better in the theatres and should have had better reviews.  The world of Barsoom (Mars) is completely and convincingly created and the storyline is interesting.  There's no time to be bored and from the very start, you find yourself cheering for John Carter to meet the Princess and fall in love with her.  The acting is good and the effects are not as cartoonish as the really underwhelming Avatar 3D.Definitely worth purchasing for the home collection-it may not be Citizen Kane, but this is a far better movie than Avatar, a Dances with Wolves ripoff often given high ratings and recommended for home purchase.

1467757,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B005LAIH2W,Arch Stanton,"[16, 20]","I went into this film having never read the books, though I knew something about the world. I did for example know what a Thark was going in. And having seen it I have to pay this film the highest compliment I can give: I want to read the books. I fear that a sequel will never be made, and while the film doesn't end on a cliffhanger per se it does feel rather like the ending of the Fellowship of the Ring. And that is sad because of all the movies out there getting sequels at the moment I can think of no world I'd rather go back to than this one.The world is the main selling point of this film. Mars (or Barsoom) is an ancient world, dry and dying. It is filled with beautiful red deserts (which I feel could have been a little more red but still...) and strange peoples. The strangest are probably the Tharks: nine-foot tall green aliens with big tusks and anger issues. They are led by Tars Tarkas, an excellent Willem Dafoe who apparently acted out the part on stilts. The Tharks are what the Na'vi should have been. They may have some of the characteristics of the 'noble savage' but they are also violent and not particularly friendly to outsiders. In other words they have the capacity to be noble but they can also be a genuine threat.If I occasionally compare this film to Avatar or other films it is an unfortunate necessity. Many science fiction epics have stolen much from John Carter. This has led to many complaints of 'having seen it before' and 'it's ripping off other, better films.' Many of these critics don't realize that John Carter is the work that has been ripped off, not vice versa, and even for those who do it doesn't matter. They are film critics after all, not literary ones. The most obvious case of the movie 'ripping off' a 'better' movie is in the arena sequence. This looks exactly like the sequence from the end of Attack of the Clones. Even though it is done better and makes more sense here, I can't deny that it looks like a blatant rip off to those not in the know. But on the whole I was surprised how new and fresh it appears. The ships and costumes are amazing. They used an admirable amount of restraint in making them feel used and lived in. The motorbike-type ships offer the best example of this. The wings fold up and pop out only when in use. In every film I've seen for the last fifteen years the action of opening/closing the sails would be a big complicated affair to show off how cool the technology is. Here it simply pops open. It feels like a real piece of technology that one might use rather than a cheap gimmick. As to the costumes, they are uniformly excellent. They feel lived in, and if they are slightly campy they never go overboard.I'd call the story fairly basic, although there is much detail given along the way. There is an evil general called Sab Than who wants to take over Mars and so he wishes to marry princess Deja Thoris of his rival city. Pretty standard stuff, and he seems a thoughtless brute right out of Flash Gordon or some other adventure serial. Where things get interesting is in the people controlling him. For he is not the film's main villain, merely their puppet. The true villains of the piece are the Tharns, a race of immortals who can disguise their appearance at will and who feed off the destruction of worlds. They've given great power to Than since he seems most likely to achieve this end. He's a good choice too since he causes such a big commotion that people don't think to look beyond him for even darker motives. The really nice thing about the Tharns is that they aren't really brute force villains. They don't destroy the planets, they simply arrange for the inhabitants to do so. They are a quite genuine threat, and when they're done with Mars their next stop is Earth. I don't understand why that little fact has been left out of the trailers.It is through the Tharns that John Carter ends up on Mars. They have the ability to transport themselves between worlds and Carter ends up on Mars by accident after killing one. Here we get one of the film's few missteps. The scenes on Earth take up about twenty minutes and are not particularly engaging, despite Bryan Cranston as a Union officer trying to recruit Carter into the army for some undeveloped reason. Oh yeah, it's 1868 and John Carter is a Confederate veteran from Virginia. Kinda important to know that. Fortunately, once he gets to Mars there is rather more life in the film. John finds that he is insanely strong and has the ability to jump really high due to the lower gravity on Mars. Once there he ends up stuck in one bad situation after another as he acclimates himself to the world. Naturally it's not long before he runs into princess Deja who is fleeing her forced wedding.Character-wise Deja is the real standout. Many people have compared her to princess Leia, but while this comparison is not without merit she is very much her own character. She manages to come off as tough and noble without it feeling forced. I often find female action heroes to be lacking a certain credibility that the guys acquire more easily, yet in this case I found the girl more believable a fighter than the guy. Partly it comes down to the inconsistency of his superpoweredness, but there is also the fact that Taylor Kitsch just isn't a very good actor. He certainly doesn't ruin the film, but he doesn't particularly impress either. That's probably a good part of why the Earth scenes felt flat. They could have really used a better leading man in this role. Fortunately the supporting cast more than make up for it. As with most epic films of this sort the lead character is a somewhat blank slate simply to provide a focus of normality in the crazy world. I've mentioned most of the supporting cast already, but especial props must go out to Mark Strong and Willem Dafoe. Mark Strong is the lead Thern, and for a character who never emotes or acts even remotely menacing he manages to be quietly terrifying. But in some ways he has it easy since he is in an comparatively uncumbersome costume. Willem Dafoe was acting on stilts in the middle of the Arizona desert knowing all the while that he would be digitally replaced in post-production, yet his Tars truly feels like a living character. The other actors do their part well and while there is a fair amount of overacting there are no really bad performances here. Even Kitsch manages to be decent if unimpressive.The rest of the production is similarly first-rate. Effects, scripting, editing - all top class. The musical score is very nice, though they do tend to repeat just one theme instead of creating several. The action scenes have been criticized as sub-standard, but I don't see it. For me the key mark of a good action scene is that I actually care what happens in it. On that mark they certainly succeed. If they could have used more inventive plotting, well that's a fairly minor flaw. A more substantial problem which critics can't seem to get over is the nature of the world. People are flying around in airships powered by light, yet they're still fighting with swords. This is one of those things you can just either accept or not. I have no problem with suspending my disbelief, but I get that others can't. To which I simply have this to say: this movie isn't for you. This film is likely to have a fairly narrow audience, although I imagine it would be popular with the majority of kids. Those who can appreciate this kind of thing, and can ignore that it's set on Mars, are likely to find that it is amazingly good fun.I'm rather amazed that this film got made at all. it is not the sort of movie studio execs like to see. Aliens, a campy story (on Mars no less), and a rather eccentric group of characters, all with no big star. It's amazing it ever got funded. People seem uninterested in seeing it, which is very unfortunate as this is a film which deserves to succeed. I want to see more of the marvelous world of Barsoom and the further adventures of John Carter. But Disney seems uncertain of how to market this, as evidenced by the removal of the iconic ""From Mars"" from after John Carter's name. This is a film which you will either love or not. And there's nothing wrong with that. Some people love sushi, but I can't stand it. That doesn't mean that sushi is bad and everything I like good. The simplest way to figure out whether you will like this film is to ask yourself whether the idea of swordfights in airships and green aliens on Mars appeals to you. If it does then the odds are that you'll like this movie. If you're not sure, give it a shot. you may be surprised. But if that just sounds silly and ridiculous then avoid this movie. It is exactly what it appears to be: a scifi action-adventure with aliens, flying ships, and sword-fights.",5,A Badly Marketed Film,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,8801,"['went', 'film', 'having',

They are fun action-adventure, escapist reads.  They are not and do not claim to be great literature, but at the same time they have staying power.  I mean, who hasn't heard of Tarzan?  Anyway, his ""Princess of Mars"" series is lesser known, but equally fun and engaging.  They, like Tarzan, are great summertime reads!  I was therefore excited to see that Disney was releasing ""John Carter"" (which is based on the ""Princess of Mars"").  I don't remember seeing much hype about this movie before it came out in the theater, but I went to see it anyway, and I really, really liked it.OK, I readily admit that some of the special effects are little hokey, but all in all it's a really fun show!  There are all kinds of aliens, there's danger, intrigue, mystery, comic relief, loyalty, a hero, and even some romantic tension tossed in to flavor the mix.  And, if you are into steam punk at all, you'l like the effects.  They have a very strong steam punk flavor to them.The basic story line (without revealing anything major) is that John Carter, a Civil War hero, suffers great personal loss, so he flees to the western territories and sets out to find gold.  He is a person adrift.  He detaches himself from everyone and everything from his past.  He is a person of strong character, but has become disillusioned.  He then finds himself on Mars (you'll have to watch to see how that happens).  Mars is a smaller than Earth, and has less gravity, so John Carter, an Earthling, has great advantages when it comes to strength, speed, etc.  Once on Mars it's not long before he stumbles into the middle of a war and finds himself confronted with a decision about whether to commit himself or not.I found the characters, even the digitally animated ones to be realistic and engaging.  And, if you are like me, you will love Woola.  Woola is, according to John Carter, a ""nice...monster dog"".  You'll see.This movie is not dark like many sci-fi movies tend to be these days.  It's fun, hopeful, and a great romp.

1467776,A1U01JOXA2RT8Q,B005LAIH2W,Benjamin Young,"[7, 9]","I finally got around to seeing John Carter. When I first saw previews for the movie, its resemblance to Star Wars was uncanny. Then I found out the movie is based off a series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs that came out in the early 1900's.So it turns out, Star Wars resembles the books which in turn causes John Carter the movie to resemble Star Wars. It's a whole chicken and egg thing.But anyway, I'll start right off with saying that if you have read the books, be prepared for some changes to the story. Personally, I found the changes, such as the look and role of the Therns, to be jolting. The problem with reading a book and seeing a movie is you expect the same thing. So when things are switched up, it becomes a little confusing as you try to unlearn what you already know.If you never read the books, I think this movie will be a lot more enjoyable. There is plenty of action, great characters, and a decent plot. Andrew Stanton does a great job transitioning his animated directing experience with Pixar into a live action/animated film with John Carter.And yes, as you watch it, you'll sometimes feel the uncanny similarities the movie has with Star Wars. What with words like Jeddak being thrown around and names of creatures like Banths, how could you not?My one gripe comes with the ending, but I think it has more to do with a lack of confidence in getting a chance to do a sequel to the movie. In the first book, it ends with a clear cliffhanger. The movie almost does the same thing, but in its final moments it resolves the potential cliffhanger and wraps everything up. Something tells me the higher ups at Disney requested this in the event the movie bombed.And, well, it did. So it was probably a good decision that they did that overall.At the end of the day, if you like good action, stories with princesses, and brave heroes, give John Carter a try.

As it stands, it was a lot better than its box office revenue would lead you to believe. First, lets talk about the good. The premise is actually pretty interesting. Without giving too much away for those who haven't seen the movie, lets just say the movie raises questions about the origins of humanity without directly addressing that question itself. Some things are better left to the imagination.Also, the notion that a human would have super-strength on Mars is reasonable even while the creators take that idea to the extreme. But considering its a movie, I can accept the leap in imagination. The storyline itself deals with environmental change and energy problems, which is obviously relevant to most Americans, and integrates these issues seamlessly into a somewhat muddled central plot that involves a superficial character evolution from damaged self-absorbed adventurer to savior of a Martian princess.While I criticized the movie for being superficial, I must confess my main issue with this movie is superficial in the extreme. The movie is about saving a princess I really didn't care for. In the American classic, A Place in the Sun, male viewers will find themselves empathizing with the male lead because he falls in love with an Elizabeth Taylor at the height of her beauty while being trapped in a mediocre life with a mediocre wife. This princess inspires no such feelings, and while she's definitely attractive, she's not somebody I would risk my neck for.In the end, it's an entertaining movie that is only mildly thought-provoking.",4,Superficial but Entertaining,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,1628,"['minor', 'alterations', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'revenue', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'First', 'talk', 'good', 'premise', 'actually', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'questions', 'origins', 'humanity', 'directly', 'addressing', 'question', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'imagination.Also', 'notion', 'human', 'would', 'have', 'super-strength', 'Mars', 'reasonable', 'even', 'creators', 'take', 'idea', 'extreme', 'considering', 'movie', 'can', 'accept', 'leap', 'imagination', 'storyline', 'environmental', 'change', 'energy', 'problems', 'obviously', 'relevant', 'most', 'Americans', 'issues', 'seamlessly', 'somewhat', 'muddled', 'central', 'plot', 'superficial', 'character', 'evolution', 'damaged', 'self-absorbed', 'adventurer', 'savior', 'Martian', 'princess.While', 'criticized', 'movie', 'being', 'superficial', 'must', 'confess', 'main', 'issue', 'movie', 'superficial', 'extreme', 'movie', 'saving', 'princess', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'American', 'classic', 'Place', 'Sun', 'male', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'empathizing', 'male', 'lead', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'height', 'beauty', 'being', 'trapped', 'mediocre', 'life', 'mediocre', 'wife', 'princess', 'such', 'feelings', 'definitely', 'attractive', 'not', 'somebody', 'would', 'risk', 'neck', 'for.In', 'end', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'only', 'mildly', 'thought-provoking']",N/A

I can only hope that Prometheus is this well done.  I laughed as John Carter arrived through a worm hole in the 1870's or early 1880's and found himself in about 1/5 G Mars.  He bounced around and fell down, lost his balance and had to learn to walk all over again.  Then he stumbles upon the natives -- kind of Mar's version of Earth's native peoples.  They come with their adorable, but at first quite scary version of a bulldog and hippo.  It moves like lightning.  He soon amazes the natives with his prodigious jumping ability and becomes a clan member.  Well, the story keeps on moving from adventure to adventure and meetings with the ancient, earth like aliens.  Aha... they seem friendly... and I'll leave you at that.  This movie was full of evolving plot and remarkably lacking in bloody violence.  It was as big a positive surprise as I have ever seen and perhaps one of my favorite five movies of all time.  As a long-time science fiction fan and amateur astonomer, I can tell you it is destined to be a classic.  I hope there are follow-ups too. The plot line leaves lots of questions open and possibilities for youngish John Carter and his career, rule, and progeny.  One last little surprise.  The Martian version of a dog has a long way to go too.  Every really good film needs a surprising and wonderful animal like that to steal the show a little at times and add some humorous relief.  That's what I really loved about this film so much.  It didn't take itself so seriously that it ended up as a massive failure like the movie Dune.  Star Wars too had this same type of sense of adventure and comic relief at times.

1467802,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B005LAIH2W,Brent Butler,"[4, 4]","In reviewing a movie with an original storyline, there is a lower standard, as it doesn't have to be compared to anything. ""John Carter of Mars"" is based on a series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs (even more famous as the author of the 20+ Tarzan books) written starting about 100 years ago - from 1912 into about the 1940s. So there are (presumably) millions of fans of that series who have read it for decades. They are the core of the target fan base for this movie, and the first question is ""How does this movie stand up against the experience of reading the books?""I first read (part) of the Mars series about 45 years ago. I tried it again about 20 years ago, and just recently read the first five books again. Edgar Rice Burroughs did not write with the intention of creating great literature. In fact he started writing after some other business ventures had fallen apart. Reading some pulp novels of the day, he literally thought ""I can write better trash than this trash""! LOL It turned out he was correct. His books were exciting. His ideas were fresh. He was possibly the first very successful author to use a lot of ""world building"", although his writing came just after the publication of the early Oz books, which were also quite successful in that regard.However, Burroughs books were also very formulaic. Original readers who got them a year or two apart probably didn't notice it as much, but if you sit down today and try to read the Mars books one after another, you'll quickly notice that you are essentially reading the same story over and over again, just with changes in characters and other window dressing. It can be important to remember that Burroughs wrote to earn a living, not to create art. So would he have approved of this movie? If it entertained customers and put some bucks in his pocket, he absolutely would have!The ""John Carter of Mars"" movie does not closely follow the plot of any of the Mars books. However, what movie does? Even the very well received ""Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy at times took incredible liberties with the plot of Tolkein's books. Did that make them less spectacular or enjoyable? No. The same is true with this movie. What it gave me as a 45 year fan of the series were substantial dollops of the creatures, races, landscapes, technologies, and familiar plot elements. The hordes of Tharks were particularly spectacular. They came across as ""real people"", just as the aliens in Avatar did. The CGI is detailed and seamless. We had familiar plot elements such as Carter and Dejah Thoris being captured by Tharks, and Carter defeating a Thark and taking his place in their society. The airships of the red race were present, and were as impressive as they were beautiful. Burroughs had an arena scene in the books, and so did the movie. Burroughs had wars ... so did the movie. There were enough similarities that I could feel the sense of Burroughs' plots, if not the details. Since that is about the best you can hope for with a screenplay adapted from novels, I give them good marks in this area. Plot elements from the all of the first three Mars books are included in this movie.Now, what about the plot we actually got in the movie? I liked it. We had two reprehensible sets of bad guys. Carter is given greater depth of character in that he is a reluctant hero. He really just wants to be left alone to pursue his own goals, and over the course of the movie has to be dragged and cajoled into becoming the hero. (This is a departure from Burroughs' character). I like what was done with the Therns. They play a similar role in society to that depicted by Burroughs, but are made into that plus something more in the movie.The movie nails the Thark society. The hordes of barbaric, four armed giants are depicted stunningly as individuals, and as a society in a manner extremely true to the Burroughs vision in his novels. The action sequence where Carter fights a rival horde virtually single handed is right out of the books and is spectacularly rendered in the film. I give the movie an A+ in its depiction of this critical element of transition from book to film.Overall, the filmmakers did a truly impressive job of depicting Martian landscapes, cities, ruins, creatures, and races. In the books, Martian races went around naked, wearing only harnesses needed to hold weapons and other mobile possessions. Not wanting an R rating, Disney DID have to put some clothes on these folks, and they did. LOLI enjoyed this movie in the theater, and I was not disappointed by this Blu ray presentation. I'd been wanting to upgrade to a 3D TV for some time, and had been watching the prices on a certain model for many weeks. The TV finally hit a price I liked, so I used the excuse of the release of this film in 3D, along with the Avengers and the new Avatar 3D, to pull the trigger on that purchase.This movie is a stunning visual achievement in home theater 3D Blu ray. Every element of the film is crisp and detailed. The 3D effects are not ""in your face"", but they certainly add to the viewing experience. Virtually this entire film is CGI, but every object is so detailed that you are completely immersed in the fantasy of this film's environment. The large flying ships are simply gorgeous. The landscapes are detailed and do nothing to break the illusion that you are seeing action on another planet.It seems to me that all of these major Blu ray releases get the sound right ... I have yet to find complaint with one ... and this is no exception. The dialogue is well balanced. It is not overwhelmed at any time by the volume level of the music or the effects. I do have a quibble with the score, but not one that is unique to this film. It seems that a LOT of action spectaculars in recent years have rather pedestrian scores. There are no major themes in this score to latch on to so that when you hear it again, you'd say, ""That's John Carter!"". The same was true, I thought, of the X-Men films. Think back to the days of the big John Williams scores for Star Wars or Superman or Indiana Jones. When those play, they are identifiable. Earlier films like ""The Magnificent Seven"" or ""The Big Country"" ... identifiable. Later films like the 1989 Batman ... identifiable. This score sounds great, but there is no stand out strain to make it uniquely memorable.Obviously I'm a fan of this movie. I just regret that it didn't get the box office pull needed to turn this into a series. The creators did a remarkable job with it. Visually, it is easily in the top few CGI efforts ever, to this date. The story is captivating. The acting is solid.Highly recommended.",5,Satisfying and Spectacular,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,6641,"['reviewing', 'movie', 'original', 'storyline', 'lower', 'standard', ""n't"", 'have', 'be',

I must admit that I never had the pleasure of reading the books, but a friend had praised them to me and got me really hyped for this movie.  The premise seemed fascinating and inspired.  Knowing that the books were written so long ago, was also very impressive to me.  I was ready to be taken on anawesome adventure.The movie was moderate fun, but really nothing special.  I didn't pull my heart strings.  I wasn't wowed by the visuals.  I don't know how much this is owed to the written source material or the Hollywood determination to change things, but the world of Mars just didn't look all that special.  I didn't even have much of a red tint to it for goodness sake.  I thought vehicles and architecture were somewhat bland and looked like they had been pulled from the inspiration of the crappy look of the Star Wars prequels.The acting was decent and the human cast was easy on the eyes, especially the princess of mars.  I don't go into movies expecting the world, but this fell short of what I had allowed myself to expect.For most people I would tell you to wait and rent this one or catch it at your ""discount"" movie theater when it's at the end of it's run.

I don't think so.But I did see a number of favorable reviews in Amazon and the price was right so I took a shot and ordered the Blu-ray. What kind of a title is that? Who knows from ""John Carter""? Michael Clayton, OK, same thing except that people knew George Clooney starred in it and that was enough. Even that one cost $25 million and grossed a little over $50 million so it just cut it. And ""Michael Clayton"" is a damned good picture in my book.""John Carter"" is a grand adventure in the old science fiction/fantasy tradition -- what we referred to as ""space opera"" years ago. The story by Edgar Rice Burroughs is only one of a series of stories with this character. At the beginning, John Carter is a deserter from the Confederate Army who is captured by Union soldiers. He makes an escape, hides in a cave and sees strange markings and a medallion in the hand of a dying man. He is holding the medallion as he repeats a word being muttered by the man: ""Barsoom."" He is immediately transported to the planet Mars, the name of which is ""Barsoom"" to the Martians. The story takes off from there. The visual effects are state of the art, although the story is a bit muddled and unclear as to who is fighting whom.  The quality of acting is on a level superior to at least two of the Star Wars films (episodes 1 and 2)  It is grand entertainment in the old space opera tradition. A friend of mine who knew about the Burroughs story used to joke that when he retired he would move to Mars and open a saloon there called the Barsoom Bar Room.I did enjoy the movie which is visually quite impressive. It is interesting that the title given at the beginning is simply ""John Carter."" At the end, at the start of the credit roll, the title is given as ""John Carter of Mars."" That was the original title but, for some reason, ""of Mars."" was dropped. Whether the original title would have helped sell the picture, well, as they say in the business, that's blood under the bridge. Apparently there were plans for a series of movies based on the John Carter stories. I think we can forget about that.",3,Grand Space Opera Adventure That Didn't Sell,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,2461,"['Did', 'anybody', 'actually', 'know', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'knew', 'was', 'cost', '250', 'million', 'produce', 'had', 'grossed', '73', 'million', 'June', '2012', 'indicating', 'Disney', 'company', 'had', 'real', 'bow-wow', 'hands', 'Did', 'anybody', 'know', 'was', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'written', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'invented', 'Tarzan', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.But', 'did', 'see', 'number', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'price', 'was', 'right', 'so', 'took', 'shot', 'ordered', 'Blu-ray', 'What', 'kind', 'title', 'Who', 'John', 'Carter', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'OK', 'same', 'thing', 'people', 'knew', 'George', 'Clooney', 'starred', 'was', 'enough', 'Even', 'one', 'cost', '25', 'million', 'grossed', 'little', '50', 'million', 'just', 'cut', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'damned', 'good', 'picture', 'book', 'John', 'Carter', 'grand', 'adventure', 'old', 'science', 'fiction/fantasy', 'tradition', 'what', 'referred', 'space', 'opera', 'years', 'ago', 'story', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'only', 'one', 'series', 'stories', 'character', 'beginning', 'John', 'Carter', 'deserter', 'Confederate', 'Army', 'who', 'captured', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'escape', 'hides', 'cave', 'sees', 'strange', 'markings', 'medallion', 'hand', 'dying', 'man', 'holding', 'medallion', 'word', 'being', 'muttered', 'man', 'Barsoom', 'immediately', 'transported', 'planet', 'Mars', 'name', 'Barsoom', 'Martians', 'story', 'there', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'state', 'art', 'story', 'bit', 'muddled', 'unclear', 'who', 'fighting', 'whom', 'quality', 'acting', 'level', 'superior', 'least', 'two', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', '1', '2', 'grand', 'entertainment', 'old', 'space', 'opera', 'tradition', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'knew', 'Burroughs', 'story', 'used', 'joke', 'when', 'retired', 'would', 'move', 'Mars', 'open', 'saloon', 'there', 'called', 'Barsoom', 'Bar', 'Room.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'visually', 'quite', 'impressive', 'interesting', 'title', 'given', 'beginning', 'simply', 'John', 'Carter', 'end', 'start', 'credit', 'roll', 'title', 'given', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'was', 'original', 'title', 'reason', 'Mars', 'was', 'dropped', 'original', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'sell', 'picture', 'well', 'say', 'business', 'blood', 'bridge', 'Apparently', 'were', 'plans', 'series', 'movies', 'based', 'John', 'Carter', 'stories', 'think', 'can', 'forget']",N/A
1467808,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B005LAIH2W,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[6, 9]","Disclaimer: This review is from the theatrical release.  As such, I cannot comment on the as yet unreleased DVD.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.As a Burroughphile from way back, I suppose I should breathe a sigh of relief that JOHN CARTER isn't a disaster.  Despite the liberties taken with the basic storyline, there are still enough essential details remaining to say that the film at least tries to adhere to ERB's classic novel.  I believe they even get more right than wrong.  But I also think I'm on solid ground when I say that many fans of the original will feel as I did - JOHN CARTER is entertaining in its own right, but the magic ofA Princess of Marsnever made the jump to the big screen.Of course, that's the old fogey speaking, who fooled himself for a moment that he could go back to being ten years old for a few minutes (and judging from my fellow-movie-goers that Saturday morning, I wasn't the only one).  But as far as my eleven-year-old son was concerned, it was a great day at the movies.  And why not - JOHN CARTER is quite the spectacle.  An Earthman, mysteriously transported to Mars, who first falls in with a race of four-armed savage Green-men, and then lands smack dab in the middle of a civil war between a distinctly humanoid race of Red-men.  And a princess - there's always a princess in a Burroughs story - and I have to say that this princess, as portrayed by Lynn Collins, ebodies all the charm and beauty I've always associated with Dejah Thoris.  The rest of the screenplay does, at times, become overly complex, but in its esssentials...well, you've probably seen it played out a thousand times before - if Burroughs didn't invent it, he certainly brought it into the twentieth century.This twenty-first century version is a bit loaded, I think, with some social ideas that don't really belong here, but much of that I'll leave up to the individual viewer to determine because your assessment of that will likely depend on your viewpoints prior to seeing the film.  They are minor, and the ideas of the bad guys who are only interested in plundering the planet's resources as well as the anti-war sentiment may be worthwhile - but they were inserted by someone other than Burroughs, and in my opinion, unecessary in order to tell an adventure tale.There will - and should be - a positive reaction to this film.  Those who are drawn to Action/Adventure/Science Fantasy epics will enjoy it and I also think my fellow Burroughphiles will grudgingly give it a thumbs up too.  But I can't say that it's inspiring the same way that I felt about the book those many years ago, nor can I really see it inspiring anyone else.  Considering I thought the book was near-mystical experience at the time, it's not surprising I'd have high demands from the film.  Best to put those in your pocket, if you feel the same, and go see it with a youngster and watch it through their eyes.  That's as close as we'll ever get to being ten again - and really, that's not too bad.",4,"3 1/2 Stars - Entertaining...yes, but sadly no classic",1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,3025,"['Disclaimer', 'review', 'theatrical', 'release', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'yet', 'unreleased', 'DVD', 'review', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'Burroughphile', 'way', 'back', 'suppose', 'should', 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', ""n't"", 'disaster', 'liberties', 'taken', 'basic', 'storyline', 'are', 'still', 'enough', 'essential', 'details', 'remaining', 'say', 'film', 'least', 'tries', 'adhere', 'ERB', 'classic', 'novel', 'believe', 'even', 'get', 'more', 'right', 'wrong', 'also', 'think', ""'m"", 'solid', 'ground', 'when', 'say', 'many', 'fans', 'original', 'will', 'feel', 'did', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'entertaining', 'own', 'right', 'magic', 'ofA', 'Princess', 'Marsnever', 'made', 'jump', 'big', 'screen.Of', 'course', 'old', 'fogey', 'speaking', 'who', 'fooled', 'moment', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'few', 'minutes', 'judging', 'fellow-movie-goers', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'as', 'far', 'eleven-year-old', 'son', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'great', 'day', 'movies', 'why', 'not', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'quite', 'spectacle', 'Earthman', 'mysteriously', 'transported', 'Mars', 'who', 'first', 'race', 'four-armed', 'savage', 'Green-men', 'then', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'civil', 'war', 'distinctly', 'humanoid', 'race', 'Red-men', 'princess', 'always', 'princess', 'Burroughs', 'story', 'have', 'say', 'princess', 'portrayed', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'charm', 'beauty', ""'ve"", 'always', 'associated', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'rest', 'screenplay', 'times', 'become', 'overly', 'complex', 'esssentials', 'well', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'played', 'out', 'thousand', 'times', 'Burroughs', 'did', ""n't"", 'invent', 'certainly', 'brought', 'twentieth', 'century.This', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'version', 'bit', 'loaded', 'think', 'social', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'belong', 'here', 'much', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'up', 'individual', 'viewer', 'determine', 'assessment', 'will', 'likely', 'depend', 'viewpoints', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'are', 'minor', 'ideas', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'plundering', 'planet', 'resources', 'as', 'well', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'may', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'were', 'inserted', 'someone', 'other', 'Burroughs', 'opinion', 'unecessary', 'order', 'tell', 'adventure', 'will', 'should', 'be', 'positive', 'reaction', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'drawn', 'Action/Adventure/Science', 'Fantasy', 'epics', 'will', 'enjoy', 'also', 'think', 'fellow', 'Burroughphiles', 'will', 'grudgingly', 'give', 'thumbs', 'up', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'inspiring', 'same', 'way', 'felt', 'book', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'inspiring', 'anyone', 'else', 'Considering', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'near-mystical', 'experience', 'time', 'not', 'surprising', ""'d"", 'have', 'high', 'demands', 'film', 'Best', 'put', 'pocket', 'feel', 'same', 'go', 'see', 'youngster', 'watch', 'eyes', 'as', 'close', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'being', 'ten', 'again', 'really', 'not', 'too', 'bad']",N/A

I have not read the book and I am not familiar with anything that happened prior to watching this 2 hour and 13 minute long movie. I watched the Instant Video (streaming), so I can't comment on the contents of the DVD/BluRay and their special features.The movie had a lot of action and special effects, which often increases the entertainment value. This part I have no problems with.However, there were problems with the characters. The lead actor was very weak for an epic movie of this caliber. He was barely two dimensional, and not very convincing. The post-production team tried hard to give him some depth with the flashbacks filling in his back-story, but the lead actor was just unconvincing.The lead actress was not as bad as the lead actor, but still, it was an average performance at best. The rest of the human characters were either undeveloped or too one dimensional. The CGI characters were actually acting better than the humans and that's not something you want said about your blockbuster movie.Speaking of the CGI characters, I couldn't help but get Avatar vibes, and steampunk bandwagoneering. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing - that's how Hollywood works after all.Speaking of Hollywood, another issue I have with this, and many other movies: it is easy to see patterns of where things are heading. In recent memory, the only exception I can recall wasDistrict 9 [Blu-ray] where they danced upon movie plot cliches and swerved in completely different directions.Overall, I would recommend someone to watch this movie.

Aren't trailers supposed to make you want to go see a movie? It seemed like a bad mashup ofCowboys & Aliens, Star Wars Phantom Menace andOddworld. It wasn't helped by the pounding orchestral version of Kashmir. Led Zeppelin songs are becoming somewhat of a movie trailer cliche now (used recently in The Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo remake, Sucker Punch). After watching it at home though, boy, am I glad to be wrong. This is a really fun movie and I gladly recommend it to action/sci-fi fans!Helmed by Pixar's Andrew Stanton who directed Wall-E, Finding Nemo, Bug's Life, and wrote all 4 Toy Story films, those are some impressive credentials. This is a period piece, set in the late 1800's and based on the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs (whose other creation is Tarzan). This is old-skool sci-fi/fantasy (think Jules Vernes and H.G. Wells) and the film has a very steampunk/vintage look to it to match, down to the color saturation in some scenes and film grain. The similarities to Cowboys and Aliens and Star Wars are not accidental. Jon Favreau was supposed to direct this film. There's a lot of CG in here. Much of the art design looks like Star Wars, especially the ships, because Peter Chiang headed up the art department on both. Filmed in the American southwest, there are lots of beautiful shots of canyons and geological formations. Mark Strong is always good as a bald bad guy.I won't give away too much of the story. John Carter, a man with a broken past, is a reluctant hero thrust into the role of savior of Mars (or Barsoom, in the story). A Civil War veteran and already a skilled fighter, his abilities are greatly magnified on Barsoom due to the difference in gravity, allowing him to leap long distances and fight with superhuman strength. Along the way, he meets a beautiful British-accented princess (played by the gorgeous Lynn Collins who's actually American) and befriends a race of green Martians.Aside from the obvious violence, there's not too much for parents to worry about. (It's a Disney movie after all). It's gunfights and swordplay. There's even a cute dog-monster thing. Worth watching and I'm definitely going to watch it again. It's not a thinking man's movie.

The terrible shame is that because this did so poorly at the box office there won't be any more of them.  That said, I'd suggest not going into this with any major expectations--it's not Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark--but it is a fun ride.  Should've been called ""Princess of Mars"" though (like the book).  ""John Carter"" is a terrible title.As can be seen from the majority of reviews, most people really liked this film.  But as others have noted, there were some big flaws in its marketing.  Disney is developing a knack for screwing their own films.  They've come out with several films in the last decade that should've done better--deserved better--than the response they got.  I've worked with Disney in the past, and anyone who has had to work with them can tell you: they have their own way doing things.  I worked for a company that did closed-captioning for Disney, and they were the biggest pain in the neck.  Despite knowing nothing about this kind of work, they insisted everything should be done a certain way simply because the guy in charge of that department had his own opinions, which as it turned out were based on one conversation he had with a deaf friend of his wife's.  Forget all the research and testing my company had done; because his wife's friend liked such-and-such, every Disney film would be captioned that way.  I suspect this kind of thing permeates the Disney way of doing business.  I can just imagine that the person who deals with marketing heard something his daughter once said, and therefore, the multi-million dollar marketing campaign gets designed by a ten year old.  Well, whatever the case, they need to reassess their methods, because there are a few franchises that never got off the ground due to their own mishandling.  And unfortunately, the creators of these films lose out, the companies involved lose out, and we the audience never get to see what could've been a great series of films.",4,The bomb almost everyone likes,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2083,"['was', 'awesome', 'parts', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', ""'d"", 'put', 'top', 'hundred', 'action/adventure', 'films', 'time', 'terrible', 'shame', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'said', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'not', 'going', 'major', 'expectations', 'not', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'fun', 'ride', 'Should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'called', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'book', 'John', 'Carter', 'terrible', 'title.As', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'majority', 'reviews', 'most', 'people', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'were', 'big', 'flaws', 'marketing', 'Disney', 'developing', 'knack', 'screwing', 'own', 'films', ""'ve"", 'come', 'out', 'several', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'deserved', 'better', 'response', 'got', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'Disney', 'past', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'work', 'can', 'tell', 'have', 'own', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'worked', 'company', 'did', 'closed-captioning', 'Disney', 'were', 'biggest', 'pain', 'neck', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'kind', 'work', 'insisted', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'certain', 'way', 'simply', 'guy', 'charge', 'department', 'had', 'own', 'opinions', 'turned', 'out', 'were', 'based', 'one', 'conversation', 'had', 'deaf', 'friend', 'wife', 'Forget', 'research', 'testing', 'company', 'had', 'done', 'wife', 'friend', 'liked', 'such-and-such', 'Disney', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'captioned', 'way', 'suspect', 'kind', 'thing', 'Disney', 'way', 'doing', 'business', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'person', 'who', 'marketing', 'heard', 'something', 'daughter', 'once', 'said', 'therefore', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'designed', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'Well', 'case', 'need', 'reassess', 'methods', 'are', 'few', 'franchises', 'never', 'got', 'ground', 'due', 'own', 'mishandling', 'unfortunately', 'creators', 'films', 'lose', 'out', 'companies', 'involved', 'lose', 'out', 'audience', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'series', 'films']",N/A

Consequently, there has been much discussion that James Cameron's ultra-popular film ""Avatar"" was also inspired by the same stories. While there are similar themes, ""John Carter"" seems to be a much more fateful representation and ""Avatar"" took many liberties and creative reroutes.John Carter is an American Civil War confederate army captain that is, through a course of events, transported to a strange planet called Barsoom. He later learns that Barsoom would be what we on Earth would call, Mars. He is gifted with leaping abilities that it seems nobody on Barsoom has. Because of this, he finds himself involved in a complex and long raging war for the future of the planet.While ""John Carter"" is gifted with great visuals and a complex storyline, it is also heavy-handed in the drama and complexities. Much of the film is taken up explaining the intricate connection between Earth and Mars and then the intricate factions of the people who are involved in the battle and why. The movie gets bogged down with a little bit too much explanation and over dramatization from the characters. The movie tried to have fun from time to time, as if it knew it was giving the audience a heavy-handed movie, but it wasn't enough.Ultimately, ""John Carter"" is being dubbed the first blockbuster of the year and that could be the case, but once the other blockbusters start rolling out, it will be quickly forgotten. The action scenes and events in the movie are fleeting. The humor and joy seems to be an after thought to the intricacies of the storyline. The storyline is a good one and I enjoyed the thought that went into how everything worked.

Here he plays the role of John Carter, a character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Although the original novel was written one hundred years ago, Disney has done a wonderful job in adapting the story and the sets to have modern appeal.John Carter is a veteran of the US Civil War.  While prospecting for gold, he takes refuge inside a cave and finds himself transported to Barsoom (Mars).  Because Mars has a lower gravitational pull than Earth,  John Carter is able to use his superior physical strength to jump higher and run faster than the natives.  While in Barsoom, he gets caught up in the power struggle between two powerful factions.  Using his physical abilities, he ends up saving the city of Helium and winning the affections of Princess Dejah.  They end up marrying.  Eventually, he ends up mastering the ability to travel between Earth and Mars.  During his visits to Earth, he relates his adventures to Edgar, his nephew.Once again, I do not want to spoil the story for you.  Suffice it to say that this is a well-made movie.  The special effects are up to the high standards you would expect from a high-budget Disney movie.  The acting performances are what you would expect from an all-star cast.  Taylor Kitsch is a rising star and this is an example of what he can do when given good material.  HBO veterans Ciaran Hinds, James Purefoy, and Polly Walker find themselves together again, after working together several years ago on the set of ""Rome"".

I was also unpleasantly surprised by the rip-off of the Return of the Jedi chase scene with the flyer. If you know nothing remotely about the character of the lead roles or the storyline then this could be rated a good show but they assassinated the characters as portrayed in the book.My wife said to me, ""Well if you just remove Edgar Rice Burroughs from the movie & the movie people had come up with this on their own wouldn't you think this was good."" My reply was of course, ""you mean if Edgar had never lived & they came up with the creatures, topography, alien races & the leads had no characteristics to go with them so they could write any story they wanted & assign characteristics to the roles as they see fit? It seems like that is killing Burroughs all over again & if you're going to do that then you can't advertise that it's based on a Burroughs's book or refer to A Princess of Mars at all. You've removed their hoped for initial fan base too."" I'm sick of Hollywood using classic literature as a front to draw in people & writing a story that has little or nothing to do with the source material.The show should do well with those that haven't read the books, don't know the characters as written by Burroughs & really just want effects & a wow factor. Fans of Burroughs will be turned off by this travesty of an interpretation of A Princess of Mars. I can't recommend it to Burroughs fans, myself included.Still the acting is great, the creatures looked exactly as described in the book & the topography was too. Why they assassinated the leads characters was totally baffling except for writer or director ego. They thought they could do better & they are always wrong.

They predate fictions like Lord of the Rings, Dune, Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, Avatar, Stargate, etc. All of these stories have taken something from the John Carter series or have been inspired by it. Those who say that John Carter is ""derivative"" or a ""rip-off"" simply do not realize how ignorant that statement actually is.Despite my middling expectations, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the film. The polarizing reviews are reminiscent of the original reviews of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Alien"", ""Bladerunner"", and ""Stargate"". These have all gone on to be classics, or cult classics at the very least.This film is beautifully shot, and reminds me of some of the older epics like Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments. The sense of grandeur in some of these scenes is amazing, and begs to be seen on a large screen. The music is also incredibly beautiful. Technically and aesthetically, the film is outstanding.There is no acting that is distracting (for good or bad). In other words, no one's performance will make you say ""Oh, he's good!"", or ""Oh, this acting is terrible"". The acting and characters are intrinsically tied in with the story, and are never unbelievable (if you can suspend your disbelief for the sake of a good science fiction).And that's the point. If you're a fan of science fiction and fantasy, you'll most likely love this film.

1467868,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIH2W,C. Sawin,"[10, 26]","John Carter will more than likely be the first big flop of 2012. With its $250 million budget, the 79 years it spent stuck in development hell, and one of the worst marketing campaigns since Grindhouse, John Carter certainly has its work cut out for it. While the blockbuster film may not be quite as bad as some expect it to be, it will more than likely rub audiences the wrong way and hurt its chances at the box office.John Carter is a lot like Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones in the way that its special effects are really outstanding, but everything else is kind of boring. Every inch of dialogue feels like it goes on forever and seems very drawn out. Short responses and one-liners are kept to a minimum. Everyone has a story to tell, a device to build, a scientific method to explain, a home to get back to, a war to prevent, or a marriage to run away from. It just winds up feeling a bit too over explanatory at times and about forty five minutes too long.Even though the majority of John Carter takes place on Mars, it almost doesn't really seem to matter. There are three or four really outstanding action sequences, but it's like the drama between characters is more important than this fantastic new world John finds himself in or the otherworldly technology he now finds at his fingertips. ""There's a battle going on right over there! We should probably jump in, right?"" ""Probably, but let me tell you the history of my people first, why I don't trust you, and why I think you're crazy for saying you're from Earth."" It has the same issue that last year's The Adventures of Tintin did in the way that when the action hits it's memorable, exciting, and exactly the type of thing you like to pay to see but everything in the middle continues to drag. Some sort of understanding of this new world is required, but this felt like a little much.What the action film is able to get done right is done in the best of ways. John Carter is pure ecstasy to look at. Mars is in a word; breathtaking. That structure John, Dejah Thoris, and Sola run into out on the water before John and Dejah go inside and discover the ninth ray is just an amazing sequence overall that practically parallels the first visit to Pandora in Avatar. There's the battle sequence where John takes on an entire army on his own while we're shown the memory of his previous family and of course the coliseum scene with the two white apes. These three sequences are reason alone to see this extremely expensive dose of eye candy.The cast is just really astounding, as well. Taylor Kitsch proves he's able to handle the leading man role with ease even if he does seem to be doing it with Christian Bale's Batman voice and you can't really go wrong with Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, James Purefoy, and Bryan Cranston in your supporting cast.It's not that John Carter is a bad film. In fact, it's a lot better than you're probably expecting. It even has shades of some of the biggest action and adventure films of all time. Aside from Star Wars and Avatar, I found myself recollecting Raiders of the Lost Ark and even The NeverEnding Story. There is greatness at its core, but there is a lot of weakness to get through to actually reach that destination. Its 132 minute duration is exhausting, the pacing is extremely slow at times, and the film seems pretty dull and boring during its slower moments. I'm pretty sure every child was crying at some point that came to the theater that night. Despite being visually stunning and featuring some spectacular special effects, John Carter is structurally boring the majority of the time. Long before I had the chance to see this, I had guessed it would be the Green Lantern of 2012 and that's a pretty accurate comment to describe this film. I'm sure Mark Strong could vouch for that.",3,"Visually stunning, but structurally boring.",1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,3835,"['John', 'Carter', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'first', 'big', 'flop', '2012', '250', 'million', 'budget', '79', 'years', 'spent', 'stuck', 'development', 'hell', 'one', 'worst', 'marketing', 'campaigns', 'Grindhouse', 'John', 'Carter', 'certainly', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'expect', 'be', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'rub', 'audiences', 'wrong', 'way', 'hurt', 'chances', 'box', 'office.John', 'Carter', 'lot', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'II', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'outstanding', 'everything', 'else', 'kind', 'boring', 'Every', 'inch', 'dialogue', 'feels', 'forever', 'very', 'drawn', 'out', 'Short', 'responses', 'one-liners', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'Everyone', 'story', 'tell', 'device', 'build', 'scientific', 'method', 'explain', 'home', 'get', 'back', 'war', 'prevent', 'marriage', 'run', 'away', 'just', 'up', 'feeling', 'bit', 'too', 'explanatory', 'times', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'too', 'long.Even', 'majority', 'John', 'Carter', 'place', 'Mars', 'almost', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'matter', 'are', 'three', 'four', 'really', 'outstanding', 'action', 'sequences', 'drama', 'characters', 'more', 'important', 'fantastic', 'new', 'world', 'John', 'otherworldly', 'technology', 'now', 'fingertips', 'battle', 'going', 'right', 'there', 'should', 'probably', 'jump', 'right', 'Probably', 'let', 'tell', 'history', 'people', 'first', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'why', 'think', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'saying', ""'re"", 'Earth', 'same', 'issue', 'last', 'year', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'did', 'way', 'when', 'action', 'memorable', 'exciting', 'exactly', 'type', 'thing', 'pay', 'see', 'everything', 'middle', 'drag', 'sort', 'understanding', 'new', 'world', 'required', 'felt', 'little', 'action', 'film', 'able', 'get', 'done', 'right', 'done', 'best', 'ways', 'John', 'Carter', 'pure', 'ecstasy', 'look', 'Mars', 'word', 'breathtaking', 'structure', 'John', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Sola', 'run', 'out', 'water', 'John', 'Dejah', 'go', 'inside', 'discover', 'ninth', 'ray', 'just', 'amazing', 'sequence', 'overall', 'practically', 'parallels', 'first', 'visit', 'Pandora', 'Avatar', 'battle', 'sequence', 'where', 'John', 'entire', 'army', 'own', ""'re"", 'shown', 'memory', 'previous', 'family', 'course', 'coliseum', 'scene', 'two', 'white', 'apes', 'three', 'sequences', 'are', 'reason', 'alone', 'see', 'extremely', 'expensive', 'dose', 'eye', 'candy.The', 'cast', 'just', 'really', 'astounding', 'as', 'well', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'able', 'handle', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'ease', 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'voice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'wrong', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'supporting', 'cast.It', 'not', 'John', 'Carter', 'bad', 'film', 'fact', 'lot', 'better', ""'re"", 'probably', 'expecting', 'even', 'shades', 'biggest', 'action', 'adventure', 'films', 'time', 'Aside', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Avatar', 'found', 'recollecting', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'even', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'greatness', 'core', 'lot', 'weakness', 'get', 'actually', 'reach', 'destination', '132', 'minute', 'duration', 'exhausting', 'pacing', 'extremely', 'slow', 'times', 'film', 'pretty', 'dull', 'boring', 'slower', 'moments', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'child', 'was', 'crying', 'point', 'came', 'theater', 'night', 'being', 'visually', 'stunning', 'featuring', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'John', 'Carter', 'structurally', 'boring', 'majority', 'time', 'Long', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'had', 'guessed', 'would', 'be', 'Green', 'Lantern', '2012', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'comment', 'describe', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'could', 'vouch']",N/A

To Edgar's avid readers it was simply a joy to see the characters come to life on the screen.3D was not necessary for the story and didn't really do it for me.  The CGI was excellent and true to the various creatures as described in the novels, especially Woolla.  No slight to the actress playing Dejah but the book series often referred to her as the most beautiful woman on 2 planets with wars being fought over her - and, very scantily clad (translated, lol,  just about naked), not how I would describe the movie Dejah Thoris Princess of Helium - the actor playing John Carter was quite good.In a nutshell the story is about an American former confederrate officer and educated gentleman from Virginia who after the ravages of the civil war seeks his fortune in the wild west looking for gold.  A former professional soldier with a great aptitude, talent and experience at fighting (as well as liking a good fight) -is pursued by Indiams and hides in a cave which the Indians will not enter due to mystical properties therein and he awakes to find himself mysteriously transported to Mars, called Barsoom by the natives (while his corporeal body remains on earth hidden in the cave no less).  He finds that the lesser gravity of Mars coupled with his personal fighting skills make him a force to be reckoned with amoung the various warlike species on intelligent life on Barsoom (Mars).  He quickly learns the languages of Barsoom.He is constantly encountering hostile intellegent creatures, kicking butt and displaying his greater strength etc. but as a man of honor and a southern gentleman he wins over many a former foe and wins the heart of the most beautiful woman on 2 planets the Princess of Helium (one of the many warring kingdoms of Barsoom).Bottom-line I enjoyed the movie and will purchase the dvd when it comes out - I gave it 5 stars because the task of translating the book to the screen was (to me) a near impossible task and Disney Studios did a very difficult task quite well all things considered.Read the books - then see the movie - I assure you sci-fi fans out there will be hooked.",5,Edgar Rice Burroughs Book translates to the Big Screen,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,2666,"['youngster', 'read', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'book', 'could', 'find', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', 'read', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'one', 'book', 'series', 'authored', 'other', 'series', 'including', 'John', 'Carson', 'Venus', 'Pellucidar', 'Tarzan', 'being', 'amoung', 'better', 'known.Disney', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'adhering', 'book', 'series', 'believe', 'given', 'book', 'content', 'was', 'easy', 'task', 'pack', 'nuance', '1st', 'book', 'series', 'single', 'movie', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'series', 'great', 'deal', 'unexplained', 'Edgar', 'avid', 'readers', 'was', 'simply', 'joy', 'see', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'screen.3D', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'CGI', 'was', 'excellent', 'true', 'various', 'creatures', 'described', 'novels', 'especially', 'Woolla', 'No', 'slight', 'actress', 'playing', 'Dejah', 'book', 'series', 'often', 'referred', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', '2', 'planets', 'wars', 'being', 'fought', 'very', 'scantily', 'clad', 'translated', 'lol', 'just', 'naked', 'not', 'how', 'would', 'describe', 'movie', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Princess', 'Helium', 'actor', 'playing', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'quite', 'good.In', 'nutshell', 'story', 'American', 'former', 'confederrate', 'officer', 'educated', 'gentleman', 'Virginia', 'who', 'ravages', 'civil', 'war', 'fortune', 'wild', 'west', 'looking', 'gold', 'former', 'professional', 'soldier', 'great', 'aptitude', 'talent', 'experience', 'fighting', 'as', 'well', 'liking', 'good', 'fight', '-is', 'pursued', 'Indiams', 'hides', 'cave', 'Indians', 'will', 'not', 'enter', 'due', 'mystical', 'properties', 'therein', 'find', 'mysteriously', 'transported', 'Mars', 'called', 'Barsoom', 'natives', 'corporeal', 'body', 'earth', 'hidden', 'cave', 'less', 'lesser', 'gravity', 'Mars', 'coupled', 'personal', 'fighting', 'skills', 'make', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'various', 'warlike', 'species', 'intelligent', 'life', 'Barsoom', 'Mars', 'quickly', 'languages', 'Barsoom.He', 'constantly', 'encountering', 'hostile', 'intellegent', 'creatures', 'kicking', 'butt', 'displaying', 'greater', 'strength', 'etc', 'man', 'honor', 'southern', 'gentleman', 'over', 'many', 'former', 'foe', 'heart', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', '2', 'planets', 'Princess', 'Helium', 'one', 'many', 'warring', 'kingdoms', 'Barsoom', '.Bottom-line', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'when', 'out', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'task', 'translating', 'book', 'screen', 'was', 'near', 'impossible', 'task', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'did', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'quite', 'well', 'things', 'considered.Read', 'books', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'assure', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'hooked']",N/A

1467880,AIXGFTIK2K3TT,B005LAIH2W,"Daria ""johntracytb5""","[7, 9]","Let's get one thing out of the way: Disney totally blew it on the advertising side when it came to ""John Carter,"" a Grade-A family adventure film, which is why it was so difficult to get folks into the theater in the US. However, this same film was No.1 across Europe for 2-3 weeks, breaking box office records in several countries, so the European marketing team certainly knew what draws people into theaters (and it is not posters of white apes and silhouetted Tharks of all things)! People want to see the winsome Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) and the handsome hero, Taylor Kitsch (the incorrigibly charming ""Gambit"" from ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"").There's no denying that Taylor Kitsch is THE action star of the year, what with three starring film roles in the first half of 2012. There's also no debate that ""John Carter"" has more heart, excitement, action and thrills than any other adventure film in many years. I've seen this film 38 times in the cinema (yep!) during the theatrical release and I couldn't wait to have it to watch any time I please. All of the performances are fabulous, from our world-weary yet bound-by-honor ex-Cavalryman (Kitsch) who is transported to the world of 1863 Mars (locals call it ""Barsoom""), to the merciless plunderer, Sab Than (Dominic West), to the villainous mystic, Matai Shang (Mark Strong). There's also Lynn Collins as the most intelligent, valiant and lovely Disney princess of all, Dejah Thoris, a worthy Princess Of Mars, and the clever and dashing Kantos Kan, played by James Purefoy. Willem Dafoe is wonderfully warm as the Tharks' Jeddak (ruler) Tars Tarkas, played in perfect opposition to the cold and ruthless Tal Hajus (Thomas Haden-Church); this tandem is matched on the feminine side by the pure-hearted Sola (Samantha Morton) plagued by her evil nemesis Sarkoja (Polly Walker). And then there's everyone's favorite lizard-meets-dog, the playful Woola, who lavishes his protection (and slobbering) on his beloved John Carter.The PG-13 rating is mainly for a brief scene of torture which might upset small children, but while it might be unsettling, it is handled quickly and is there solely to advance the subplot. There is a very minor amount of cursing (nothing by comparison to most films these days) and, for any squeamish boys in your home, very little of the mushy stuff. ""John Carter"" is truly a most perfect action/adventure film for the entire family, beautifully translated from the novel of 100 years ago.

1467881,A1H0DVDALK4APZ,B005LAIH2W,Darrell A. Lane,"[3, 4]","Yes, H. G. Rider had already written his Allan Quartermain novels as well as She, but the birth of the first action hero wasn't until 1912 with Edgar Rice Burroughs's science fiction fantasy (published in a mens magazine) A Princess of Mars (two years before Tarzan the Ape Man). Here we see the first super hero/fighting man that inspired not only Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Rocky Jones, Commando Cody, Captain Kirk, Luke Skywalker and Starbuck but also inspired Superman, Batman, Captain America, Green Lantern, The Lone Ranger, Thor, Iron Man, Green Hornet and Indiana Jones (with a little Allan Quartermain dashed in for flavor!). Larger than life heroes battling impossible odds, possessing special skill sets or an arsenal of weaponry (usually ""borrowed"" from the bad guys) and then there's the beautiful princess that needed rescuing and the arena of death plot device are all from the feverish mind of Mr. Burroughs.John Carter, a Virginia gentleman dies in a cave during an Indian War and then wakes up on Mars wearing only his birthday suit, which is okay because everyone else on Mars (Barsoom) prefers their birthday suits as well (harnesses and insignia are usually all any of them wear) and then he goes about conquering the bad guys that later inspired Ming, the Draconians, the Cylons, the Klingons, the Romulans, the Emperor and even Darth Vader; this list is endless because it would also include Sinestro, Lex Luthor, Ra's Al Ghul, Red Skull, Dr. Doom, The Mandarian, Loki, Baltar and Butch Cavindish. You see where this is going...There are fifteen-foot tall, four-armed creatures with nasty underbitten tusks, flying skiffs, swordplay, incredible jumping and wicked explosions...oh, and the incomprable Dejah Thoris being kidnapped as a matter of routine (much the way Jane was in Tarzan); there are cavalry officers, apache Indians, warring tribes, psycho priests, forgotten gods, dictators, assassins, thieves, mad doctors, chessmen, would-be rapists, warriors, weird mating rituals, great white apes, vast deserts, inter-special mating (and the children thereof) and the occasional introduction by Mr. Burroughs himself. And that's just the 11 books that comprise the Martian Tales.This movie actually blends elements of the first three books, A Princess of Mars, The Gods Of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, and is a feast for the eyes. The imagery reflects the literature in many areas, regardless of the usual theatrical changes experienced from the translation of book-to-screen. I was thoroughly impressed, moreso because I've grown bored with Disney's inability to rise above dorky kiddie fare; however, Disney allayed all of my fears of a dumbbed-down travesty and gave me something that sits proudly among the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of celluoid if which it inspired. Of course, Disney now has Marvel and its lengthy host of heroes and villains to lavish the screen with like the Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man and Thor).Herein lies the swordplay of Flash Gordon and Luke Skywalker; herein lies the much-lusted after princesses Ardala, Aura and Leia (don't forget Padme, can't forget her!); herein lies the grandiose battles of Mongol, Tatooine and all points spaceward; herein lies giant monsters and deadly arenas that leering villains like Ming, Count Dooku, Killer Kane, the Klingons or Jabba the Hut are entertained with prior to their downfall; herein lies the skiffs, gadgets and back backs of Commando Cody, Buck Rogers, Bobba Fett and Imperial Biker Scouts; herein lies the genesis of so much that we take for granted.I've heard people tell me that John Carter rips off Star Wars, Star Trek and blah blah blah, but this only shows the limits of a literature-starved America within the vast wasteland of dullness.John Carter, cavalry officer of Virginia, Warlord of Barsoom and betroved of the incomprable Dejah Thoris is the great-great-grandaddy of all the action heroes of the 20th Century pop culture.Thank you, Disney, for doing something totally cool!A Princees of Mars was previously made as a low-budget Scy Fy TV movie (2009) starring the still lovely Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris and Antonio Sabato Jr. as an Iraq War-era John Carter; nothing at all like the recent John Carter but rather faithful to the plot of the first book.John Carter is Charlton Heston's real name but he changed it so it wouldn't be confused with the Burroughs's character; Heston's career seemed to parallel his literary namesake (Colonel George Taylor of Planet of the Apes is another of those classic action heroes).There is an even longer pedegree of the origin of the great action hero of legend (King Arthur, anyone?) we could delve into, but we'll leave this exploration for now and revel in the excitement of yesterday's hero exploding on the screen today.5 stars and beyond!",5,First Action Hero,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,4832,"['Yes', 'H.', 'G.', 'Rider', 'had', 'already', 'written', 'Allan', 'Quartermain', 'novels', 'as', 'well',

1467882,A10U5D2T50JREX,B005LAIH2W,Darrell Heath,"[834, 893]","I went in to  ""John Carter"" filled with trepidation.  I often avoid these big, splashy CGI spectacles that never live up to their promises and I was sure that this film was going to be nothing more than lots of cinematic eye candy and short on substance. Added to that there was a lot of lackluster critical reviews.  Well, all I can say is that this was a grand entertainment and I am so glad I caught it on the big screen!I've heard some critics say the plot was a mess and overly convoluted. Really?  My suggestion to them is ""don't text while watching a movie, you might miss something"".  I found the plot fairly well done and actually made sense (if only the last Star Trek film had that going for it) and was interesting to boot.I also read that the look of Barsoom (Mars to you and me) was dull and uninteresting.  Hmmm, never been an admirerer of the stark and raw beauty of the American southwest I guess.  Personally I found Barsoom to be beautiful, alien, exotic and familiar all at the same time. After all, the Mars rovers have confirmed that the Red Planet does indeed look like our American southwest and I for one happen to think both places very scenic.Some critics have said the story is dull and lifeless.  OK, put down the crack pipe and step away from the video game console.  ""John Carter"" has a great fast paced plot with lots of interesting twists and turns. I also thought the characters were nicely drawn, if not overly complex, and that the alien races on Barsoom to be very interesting with fascinating customs which only made me want to learn more about them.Other critics have complained that they have seen this stuff before in movies like Star Wars and Avatar.  Wellllll, it seems as though those two directors (among other film makers and writers) have been looting the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs for quite some time so I guess there is bound to be a feeling of deja vu.Have we really become such a culture that is so easily jaded?  Can we no longer feel that sense of wonder and feeling of adventure in a film like ""John Carter""?  Maybe we are too use to storylines being spoon fed to us in easily digested bites and cannot follow along with a film that isn't zipping past our eyeballs at 186,000 miles per second with flashy explosions at every eye blink.

1467883,A2OMOO9PDZEVOG,B005LAIH2W,Darryl Fabia,"[12, 14]","There's a line about a character from the movie Sin City that goes: ""He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century.""That sentiment somewhat applies to John Carter, in that while its effects are as modern as they come, the script feels like it grew from the 1980s, and I mean that as a compliment.  It was a fantastic time for action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy films. John Carter is impressive in its creation of a world, but it's also impressive in how deftly it avoids many annoying trappings of modern films of its like.  Sidekicks aren't annoying, there aren't any pop culture references, no wink at the camera nonsense.  It manages to not take itself too seriously, while also sticking wholly to its own world.Story in quick form:  a former Confederate soldier on a gold hunt ends up being transported to Mars, which contrary to popular belief is teeming with life--life that wants to kill other life.  Much as he wants to avoid war, Carter is swept up in one far, far from his home.That description does little justice to the movie.  War?  Not a fun subject, and often its the climactic ""charge!"" scene to many of today's sci-fi and fantasy movies.  John Carter keeps the pace strong throughout with good humor, amazing effects, and action scenes you can follow easily, from tower-hopping to airship-traversing sword fights to a little dog-monster that manages to be adorable while biting people's heads off.I fell in love with the movie because of the jumping most of all.  Because of the lower gravity on Mars and Carter's muscle density (or something), he's a lot stronger and more spry on Mars than he was on Earth.  He can leap all over the place and it's when he's doing this that the movie's magic comes to life.  Jumping between airships, jumping between towers, jumping from battle to battle--you want to be doing the same.The effects are amazing, the score is a classic--if I had to complain, I'd say there are a couple clunky lines and the beginning is a little messy, though it quickly straightens out.  What's stronger than all that is the heart of this movie, and I don't mean in the sappy family film sense.  I mean there's a heart of courage, strength, a sense of old school right and wrong that I normally don't get invested in, but here it was all so fun that I couldn't help enjoying it.  The movie really came together when you realize just how insidious the situation of the war is, and how important it is that John Carter is an outsider coming into this situation.

1467884,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B005LAIH2W,DarthRad,"[21, 25]","This was a terrific movie, well worth watching, in spite of all of the pundits trying to kill it off.Lynn Collins was just luminescent as Dejah Thoris.  The subtle tattoos and jewelry and costuming, combined with her native intelligence and athletic grace and power made for a beautiful modern version of the Princess of Mars. Her irises were enhanced (probably digitally) to a shimmering blue, which was a really nice effect (I think her eyes are normally gray or hazel green, from other photos).  The Edgar Rice Burroughs (ERB) version of Dejah Thoris would have been boring to watch, much like Kim Basinger doing nothing but scream and get tossed around like a sack of potatoes, playing a Victorian era Damsel in Distress in the first Batman movie.Much of the story may seem derivative unless you consider that ERB created them first 100 years ago, and his ideas have been liberally borrowed by many subsequent generations of science fiction writers and movie makers.  It has since become a canon of science fiction that Mars was once inhabited by a lost civilization that faded away as its water and atmosphere faded away.  ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" are among many movies that have taken large chunks of the original ideas of ERB's Barsoom series - the swashbuckling battles between airships, the Arena Battle with monsters, the existence of a powerful force in this strange new world, and the multiple races/species of intelligent creatures coexisting and fighting against each other.The storyline of the movie is actually a combination of ERB's ""A Princess of Mars"" and the second book in the Barsoom series ""The Gods of Mars"".  The trip to the Valley Dor and the mysterious Therns do not appear until the second book.Disney appears to have done everything wrong to market this movie, and the amount of vitriole directed against the movie, probably planted by Disney insiders, has been totally disproportional to the actual quality of the movie.  It's almost as if Disney is fighting an internal battle to not make any more of this series of movies (three were planned).  Which would be a complete shame because I really like this movie.Could the movie have been better?  Well they could have picked a bigger male star with more charisma than Taylor Kitsch, who was OK in this role, but not overwhelming and was outshined by the glittering Lynn Collins.  It would have been interesting to see one of the shiny uber-handsome and very large Hemsworth brothers, Chris or Liam, in this role, or even Sam Worthington.  Dejah's father Tardos Mors and Kantos Kan were played by none other than Caesar and Mark Antony (from the HBO series ""Rome"") - Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy - which I thought was an odd paring, a bit too easily recognizable for people who watch a lot of movies.But otherwise, it's a great movie, and I hope people go and support it while it is still in the theaters, and I for one am planning to get the DVD/BluRay when it comes out.

1467885,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,B005LAIH2W,Dave Cordes,"[16, 20]","A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away...Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a great sci-fi adventure story calledA Princess of Marsthat would become one of the most influential science fiction fantasy stories of the 20th century inspiring George Lucas to make the epicStar Warsfranchise nearly 60 years after it. It has taken a full century for Burroughs' imaginative epic fantasy to come to life on the big screen but John Carter has arrived in theaters DOA thanks to a series of costly marketing blunders by Disney of equally epic proportions.Despite its numerous failures to attract an audience, director Andrew Stanton has delivered a first class epic fantasy film that brings the pages of Burroughs' highly imaginative world of Barsoom to life in living, breathing color with vibrant special effects and computer animation that could easily have become Disney's Star Wars franchise with the proper marketing muscle behind it. Unfortunately we will probably never see the further adventures of John Carter inThe Gods of MarsorWarlord of Marsor any of the other chronicles in Burroughs' classic pulp series because the audience for whom the film was targeted has no idea just who John Carter is and is far more excited to see this summer's Hunger Games, also based on a popular series of teenage literary novels, than a hundred year-old character from a book they've never even heard of.Perhaps the biggest tragedy is the over-simplified title changed by Stanton himself. Who is John Carter? Why should anyone care about him?Well, he's Taylor Kitsch who played Gambit fromX-Men Origins: Wolverineand his co-star Lynn Collins from the same film is ideally cast as the beautiful Princess Dejah Thoris of Helium. John Carter is a confederate captain from Virginia who travels to Arizona to find gold, only to find himself astrally transported to Mars after being fatally shot by Apache Indians. There are plenty of metaphors here between the natives of both worlds that evoke Dances With Wolves and Avatar as John Carter becomes the propheseid hero and savior of Barsoom which the native Tharks call their red planet. With an inspired cast of supporting actors with Willem Dafoe as the voice of Tars Tarkas, a nine foot tall, four armed green Martian, Dafoe sounds exactly as I would have always imagined the voice of Tars Tarkas to sound like and brings the character to life with his impassioned performance. Other inspired casting choices include terrific supporting performances by Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy who are reunited again from working together in HBO's excellent seriesRomeas Tardos Mors and Kantos Kan respectively. Dominic West from HBO's The Wire also rounds out the inspired casting as the villanous Sab Than seeking the hand of the Princess of Helium to unite a planetary civil war and become its ruler.John Carter is filled with action, adventure, special effects, animation, heroes, villains, monsters and a princess, it has all the fundamental ingredients of a classic Disney film and is a faithful adaptation of Burroughs' novel, and Disney and Stanton have delivered a spectacular film that has fallen flat on its face as a $250 million box office disaster that is being critically compared to 1995's sci-fi flop Waterworld. It must make over $400 million just to break even, another unrealistic expectation reminiscent of 2010'sTron: Legacyby the foolish suits at Disney who clearly have no clue how to run the studio nor do they know anything about what they have on their hands or how to mass market their product and for that heads should roll and Disney's marketing department all deserve the grim fate that awaits them.As for the fate of John Carter, who knows, but all indications so far seem to imply that we may never return to the red planet on the big screen again. Fortunately the written pages of Burroughs will last forever for those of us that still remember them...Long live John Carter of Mars!",5,Get Carter,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3936,"['long', 'time', 'ago', 'galaxy', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'wrote', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'story', 'calledA', 'Princess', 'Marsthat', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'stories', '20th', 'century', 'inspiring', 'George', 'Lucas', 'make', 'epicStar', 'Warsfranchise', 'nearly', '60', 'years', 'taken', 'full', 'century', 'Burroughs', 'imaginative', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'come', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'John', 'Carter', 'arrived', 'theaters', 'DOA', 'thanks', 'series', 'costly', 'marketing', 'blunders', 'Disney', 'equally', 'epic', 'proportions.Despite', 'numerous', 'failures', 'attract', 'audience', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'delivered', 'first', 'class', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'film', 'pages', 'Burroughs', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'world', 'Barsoom', 'life', 'living', 'breathing', 'color', 'vibrant', 'special', 'effects', 'computer', 'animation', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'Disney', 'Star', 'Wars', 'franchise', 'proper', 'marketing', 'muscle', 'Unfortunately', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'further', 'adventures', 'John', 'Carter', 'inThe', 'Gods', 'MarsorWarlord', 'Marsor', 'other', 'chronicles', 'Burroughs', 'classic', 'pulp', 'series', 'audience', 'whom', 'film', 'was', 'targeted', 'idea', 'just', 'who', 'John', 'Carter', 'far', 'more', 'excited', 'see', 'summer', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'also', 'based', 'popular', 'series', 'teenage', 'literary', 'novels', 'hundred', 'year-old', 'character', 'book', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'biggest', 'tragedy', 'over-simplified', 'title', 'changed', 'Stanton', 'Who', 'John', 'Carter', 'Why', 'should', 'anyone', 'care', 'Well', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'who', 'played', 'Gambit', 'fromX-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverineand', 'co-star', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'same', 'film', 'ideally', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'Princess', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Helium', 'John', 'Carter', 'confederate', 'captain', 'Virginia', 'who', 'Arizona', 'find', 'gold', 'only', 'find', 'astrally', 'transported', 'Mars', 'being', 'fatally', 'shot', 'Apache', 'Indians', 'are', 'plenty', 'metaphors', 'here', 'natives', 'worlds', 'evoke', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Avatar', 'John', 'Carter', 'propheseid', 'hero', 'savior', 'Barsoom', 'native', 'Tharks', 'call', 'red', 'planet', 'inspired', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'voice', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'nine', 'foot', 'tall', 'four', 'armed', 'green', 'Martian', 'Dafoe', 'exactly', 'would', 'have', 'always', 'imagined', 'voice', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'sound', 'character', 'life', 'impassioned', 'performance', 'Other', 'inspired', 'casting', 'choices', 'include', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'who', 'are', 'reunited', 'again', 'working', 'together', 'HBO', 'excellent', 'seriesRomeas', 'Tardos', 'Mors', 'Kantos', 'Kan', 'respectively', 'Dominic', 'West', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'also', 'out', 'inspired', 'casting', 'villanous', 'Sab', 'Than', 'seeking', 'hand', 'Princess', 'Helium', 'unite', 'planetary', 'civil', 'war', 'become', 'ruler.John', 'Carter', 'filled', 'action', 'adventure', 'special', 'effects', 'animation', 'heroes', 'villains', 'monsters', 'princess', 'fundamental', 'ingredients', 'classic', 'Disney', 'film', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Burroughs', 'novel', 'Disney', 'Stanton', 'have', 'delivered', 'spectacular', 'film', 'fallen', 'flat', 'face', '250', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'disaster', 'being', 'critically', 'compared', '1995', 'sci-fi', 'flop', 'Waterworld', 'must', 'make', '400', 'million', 'just', 'break', 'even', 'unrealistic', 'expectation', 'reminiscent', ""2010'sTron"", 'Legacyby', 'foolish', 'suits', 'Disney', 'who', 'clearly', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'run', 'studio', 'do', 'know', 'anything', 'what', 'have', 'hands', 'how', 'mass', 'market', 'product', 'heads', 'should', 'roll', 'Disney', 'marketing', 'department', 'deserve', 'grim', 'fate', 'them.As', 'fate', 'John', 'Carter', 'who', 'indications', 'so', 'far', 'seem', 'imply', 'may', 'never', 'return', 'red', 'planet', 'big', 'screen', 'again', 'Fortunately', 'written', 'pages', 'Burroughs', 'will', 'last', 'forever', 'still', 'remember', 'Long', 'live', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars']",N/A

Weber,"[4, 5]","I watched this on DVD, feeling a bit put out that I hadn't seen it on the big screen.By the end of it, I felt even WORSE because it's so great! Maybe if it had featured 'Mars' in the title, to attract those who knew nothing of him, or who'd missed the previews, it could've drawn more people. And maybe it could've lost about ten minutes, to bring it well under two hours.But those minor quibbles do not detract in any way from the greatness of this film.Clearly, I had fallen prey to bad press leading up to the cinematic release. I see a lot of films and the high prices mean I have to let one or two slip by.This is what happens. A few bad reviews are written, often by people who don't ever like these kinds of films. Then they're replicated around the world, ad nauseum, via the internet. Some news websites often employ people who sit at desks and do no more than rewrite what's already 'out there'. They call themselves 'journalists'-- they're really little more than copy boys.So what a handful of reviewers said-- stacked on top of the high cost of the movie-- created a negative 'buzz'. Reviewers who follow are affected by this. They don't want to go against the grain because they don't want to be seen as out of the loop, or out of their minds.Then people who have never seen the film, and have no intention of doing so, join in via blogs and online forums and social media. Before long, you end up with a mass of negative opinion that it's almost impossible to combat. The net is infamous for allowing complete strangers to kick someone or something while it's down.This is what occured with the Green Lantern movie. It had awesome special effects, and was resonably true to the comic. It was not as good as Thor but it was pretty damn great; certainly better than the re-booted Spiderman. But it too was affected by overwhelmingly negative coverage-- again, by people who hadn't stepped foot in the cinema.I can only wonder what it's like to be part of making a stunning film, months and years of work, only to have it shot down by people who largely don't know what they're on about.People need to be smarter when they're considering what a good film is, and whether they want to see it. I've learned my lesson.I think that in the future, John Carter will be seen as one of the classic science fiction films of the 2010s.",5,GREAT TO SEE SO MANY LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE HERE,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2337,"['watched', 'DVD', 'feeling', 'bit', 'put', 'out', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'big', 'screen.By', 'end', 'felt', 'even', 'WORSE', 'so', 'great', 'Maybe', 'had', 'featured', ""'Mars"", 'title', 'attract', 'who', 'knew', 'nothing', 'who', ""'d"", 'missed', 'previews', 'could', ""'ve"", 'drawn', 'more', 'people', 'maybe', 'could', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'ten', 'minutes', 'bring', 'well', 'two', 'hours.But', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'way', 'greatness', 'film.Clearly', 'had', 'fallen', 'prey', 'bad', 'press', 'leading', 'up', 'cinematic', 'release', 'see', 'lot', 'films', 'high', 'prices', 'mean', 'have', 'let', 'one', 'two', 'slip', 'by.This', 'what', 'few', 'bad', 'reviews', 'are', 'written', 'often', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'kinds', 'films', 'Then', ""'re"", 'replicated', 'world', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'internet', 'news', 'websites', 'often', 'employ', 'people', 'who', 'sit', 'desks', 'do', 'more', 'rewrite', 'what', 'already', 'call', ""'re"", 'really', 'little', 'more', 'copy', 'boys.So', 'what', 'handful', 'reviewers', 'said', 'stacked', 'top', 'high', 'cost', 'movie', 'created', 'negative', ""'buzz"", 'Reviewers', 'who', 'follow', 'are', 'affected', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'grain', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'seen', 'loop', 'minds.Then', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'have', 'intention', 'doing', 'so', 'join', 'blogs', 'online', 'forums', 'social', 'media', 'long', 'end', 'up', 'mass', 'negative', 'opinion', 'almost', 'impossible', 'combat', 'net', 'infamous', 'allowing', 'complete', 'strangers', 'kick', 'someone', 'something', 'down.This', 'what', 'occured', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'had', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'resonably', 'true', 'comic', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Thor', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'great', 'certainly', 'better', 're-booted', 'Spiderman', 'too', 'was', 'affected', 'overwhelmingly', 'negative', 'coverage', 'again', 'people', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'stepped', 'foot', 'cinema.I', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'be', 'part', 'making', 'stunning', 'film', 'months', 'years', 'work', 'only', 'have', 'shot', 'down', 'people', 'who', 'largely', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'about.People', 'need', 'be', 'smarter', 'when', ""'re"", 'considering', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'want', 'see', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lesson.I', 'think', 'future', 'John', 'Carter', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', '2010s']",N/A

His vision was so far beyond the imagination of the people in his day it's incredible! People couldn't imagne flying machine's, four armed lifeforms, etc.  As a result this series was left behind with the poputlarity of Tarzan.  If you are a fan of ERB's and aware of the Barsoom series you will be entertained and appreciate this movie. If you have never heard of the Barsoom series you will still love it. Great story and great action all told in a cohesive plot you can follow.  While not really true to the plot of ERB's books the movie captures the essence and feel of the books better than most movie to book conversions. Planning for this movie has been in the works for decades. Good CGI finally made it possible. They finally made a believable four armed race possible and they did a great job! Blows away the over hyped Planet of the Apes for CGI effects as well as the storyline and plot. Makes for a great movie with the right ratio of disbelief and emotional attachment.  I only wish the movie industry would do a truely true version of Tarzan (plus additional movies in the Barsoom series). With the current CGI a really good version or Tarzan, set in the appropriate time period is now possible. (If you've read the books you know what I mean) Nothing in the past has come even close to the first two Tarzan books as ERB's wrote them. Too bad the appropriate appreciation of ERB's imagination and talent aren't realized today. Unfortunately the movie industry seems to always think they need to rewrite a books plot and story. They almost never make an improvement.  Sorry I got off on a tangent. Overall John Carter is a great movie.

I prefer the version in the books- I believe it was through a dream, or something like that- in a fantasy movie not everything has to have an explanation.Special effects naturally dominate this movie but here again the movie fails.

Best known for creating ""Tarzan"", Edgar Rice Burroughs is also known for his sci-fi tales about Mars known as ""Barsoom"".In 1912, he would write the novel ""A Princess of Mars"" which would introduce people to a new hero named John Carter and for five more decades, he would go on to write eleven more novels based on the character and many generations of sci-fi fans would grow up reading Edgar Rice Burrough's sci-fi stories.  And for many people, Burrough's ""Barsoon"" stories would inspire many sci-fi authors such as Robert A. Heinlen, Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury.  Including filmmakers such as James Cameron and George Lucas.And many would try to create a film adaption of the film for nearly a hundred years, but the technology to create something so ambitious with spacecraft, monsters and a large alien race was not exactly an easy film that studios could even consider, so many times, owning the rights to make a film based on John Carter fell through.  And in 2006, there was discussion of another attempt to make Burrough's ""A Princess of Mars"" a movie but with the title of ""John Carter"" and was originally planned to be directed by Jon Favreau and produced by Harry Knowles.  But Favreau would go on to work on ""Iron Man"" and so, the next man in line to work on the film was Pixar's Andrew Stanton.Stanton had written many of Pixar's blockbuster animated films such as the three ""Toy Story"" films, ""A Bug's Life"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Wall-E"" and since he grew up enjoying Edgar Rice Burrough's and he has done a magnificent job in writing films, as well as directing ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E"", why not give him the opportunity to direct Disney's most ambitious sci-fi action film.  So ambitious that ""John Carter"" was budgeted at $272 million.The film's screenplay is by Stanton, Mark Andrews (storyboard artist for ""Spider-Man"", ""The Iron Giant"" and the ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" TV series) and Michael Chabon (who wrote the novel ""Wonder Boys"" and the screen story for ""Spider-Man 2&#8243;).""John Carter"" would feature stars such as Taylor Kitsch (""Battleship"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""Friday Night Lights""), Lynn Collins (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""The Number 23&#8243;, ""The Lake House""), Willem Dafoe (""Platoon"", ""Spider-Man"", ""The Boondock Saints""), Thomas Haden Church (""Spider-Man 3&#8243;, ""Sideways"", ""Easy A"") and Samantha Morton (""Control"", ""In America"", ""Morvern Callar"").VIDEO:""John Carter"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  If there is one thing that videophiles can remain confident in Disney, is that they strive for perfection, may it be animated or live action films.  And ""John Carter"" does not disappoint!  The video quality is absolutely beautiful and vibrant.  The colors of the various costume design, the scenery of Mars to the detail of the skin and even CGI aliens and monsters are magnificent.  Black levels are nice and deep and the clarity is amazing.While watching this film, I detected no artifacts, banding or any major issues with the video.  If anything, ""John Carter"" looks magnificent on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the lossless audio, ""John Carter"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.As for the lossless track, ""John Carter"" like the video is just amazing to listen to.

Also, a slipcover case is included.JUDGMENT CALL:Before watching ""John Carter"", I am aware of how badly this film did in the box office and I have read the various news reports on the finger pointing of why the film failed.Was it because Andrew Stanton, who knew how to write and direct animated films for Pixar, was not ready to take on the job for such large scale film?  Was it because the concept of ""John Carter"" has been rehashed in so many other films such as ""Star Wars"", ""Avatar"", ""Flash Gordon"" and other sci-fi films?After finally watching ""John Carter"", I felt that part of the problem was that the film was not marketed well and while John Carter is a name that will entice Edgar Rice Burroughs fans familiar with his work, the goal of a lot of action films is not to solely market to the Generation X or the Baby Boomers but for the Generation Y.  A generation who are used to vampire films, big budget superhero films and sci-fi films such as ""Avatar"".  And ""John Carter"", while familiar to us who are familiar with Burroughs work, may sound like a politician to today's generation.And the problem that the film suffered from was an over-reliance on John's relation to the alien characters and not enough on the storyline about John Carter.  I know that there was a lot of trimming with this film, but I wonder how much important scenes were cut in order to make 132 minutes.  We are given flashbacks of John's wife and child, but it would have made a bigger visual impact if we saw what happened and how it would make things worse for John Carter.As for the war between the Heliums and Zodanga, one again...this feels rushed.  While we are given a narration at the beginning, it's not enough.  You need to build upon the antagonist and show why he is so evil.  And it's been mentioned many times before how George Lucas has borrowed from Burrough's ""Barsoom"" stories.  But one thing he made sure was to show people how evil the empire was and how Darth Vader was the ultimate evil, but also someone behind the scenes.  There was nothing that made us know the level of evil within the character of Sab Than, Jeddak of Dozanga.  All that was established was the Thern and how they love to instill chaos on a planet.For a sci-fi film, may it be a Predator, an Alien, an evil empire or whatever, the antagonist must be shown to be a great evil and thus, the viewer can root for the protagonist.  But it doesn't happen this way in ""John Carter"", why doesn't Princess Deja Thoris want to go back home?  It's because she is being forced to marry the enemy.  For today's viewers, they are so used to seeing the greater evil either kill a love one, destroying a planet or annihilating a race, there is just no way that an arrange marriage is ""enough"" to be believed for today's sci-fi fan.And this is the problem that ""John Carter"" has met with audiences.  This is story based on a 1912 novel which has been rehashed many times and because the people behind the film are great fans of Burrough's work and want to respect the work of his novels, there is no straying away from the storyline. Listening to the audio commentary, there was a moment where Stanton and others talked about how they were big fans, but sometimes a film needs to be changed from its original novel in order to make things modern.  And despite the fact that it may offend those who grew up with the film, the fact that we see this happening with super-hero films such as ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"", ""X-Men: First Class"", to name a few, the writers get away from the original comic book series, maintain the characters but modernize the screenplay for a modern audience.The focus seemed of keeping the storyline intact, but giving today's technology a chance of bringing the story of ""Barsoom"" to a wider audience who may not be familiar with John Carter or the characters of the novels, is a major gamble.  And while watching the film, I realized more and more that the film was devoid of any emotional attachment to its primary characters until we reach towards the end of the film.  And this is surprising to me as Andrew Stanton has always made characters a priority, may it be in the ""Toy Story"" films, ""Wall-E"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters, Inc."".  There was always an emotional attachment to the characters and in this film, it was geared more towards the popcorn action fan and showing that John Carter can kick some butt.As for the Blu-ray release, as expected from a Disney Blu-ray release, the video quality and the lossless audio are fantastic and there are a good number of special features, including a fascinating audio commentary, a featurette on how it took nearly 100 years for a ""John Carter"" film to be released and other special features to keep viewers busy watching this Blu-ray for several hours.Looking back, especially having grown up reading ""John Carter"", not through the novels but the old '70s Marvel comic book series and my feeling when I heard of the film being made was more of a ""would anyone care in this day and age about ""John Carter?"". While myself and others who grew up reading the novels or comic book series would say ""yes""! , after watching this film, I felt that the staff did a good job in bringing Edgar Rice Burrough's sci-fi classic to the big screen and bringing life to the characters, monsters, aliens and air vehicles, but visual effects and action sequences can only go so far.  I still feel that Andrew Stanton is a talented filmmaker and an excellent writer, but there was a reason why this film was not made for so long and it's not just because of the technology, but it's because so many of the stories elements have been done on other sci-fi films, rehashed over and over and ""John Carter"" suffers from sci-fi banality.But by no means is ""John Carter"" a horrible film.  ""John Carter"" manages to have its fair share of fun and enjoyable moments and I felt it managed to be a sci-fi popcorn action film that was created to be nothing more than what it is meant to be.And while I felt that the storyline of the film was average, the overall quality of the video and audio is not. ""John Carter"" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray and I'm confident that videophile and audiophiles will be impressed by this Blu-ray release.  I'll even go farther in saying that this Blu-ray release of ""John Carter"" is probably one of the best looking and sounding Blu-ray releases of 2012 so far!Overall, if you are looking for a family sci-fi action film, ""John Carter"" may not have done well in the box office, but giving it a try on Blu-ray, you may find yourself enjoying it!",4,"If you are looking for a sci-fi popcorn action film, ""John Carter"" is a film you may be looking for!",1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,11845,"['American', 'author', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'well-known', 'creating', 'sci-fi', 'fiction',

It was a very enjoyable movie full of action and the 3-D effects were good though perhaps not the finest I have seen. The special effects in the movie were superb, the storyline was exciting and all in all it was one great movie.Sadly, the night after viewing the movie my son passed away so after 35 years of going together to see movies, a tradition we kept alive since before he was 2 years of age, it will be the last movie we will enjoy seeing together. Im just glad that it was a really good one that both of us enjoyed immensely.So, from before the movie ""The Scanners"" was released, a tradition has passed. I only hope that wherever my son is that he gets to enjoy watching action packed movies just like the literally hundreds we saw together on this mortal coil.I highly recommend this movie to any and everyone. Especially to those of you who actually read the books featuring John Carter. Ya don't have to see it in 3-D, the movie would stand alone in traditional format very easily as the action packed, special effect filled film that it is. I am going to pre-order a blu ray copy for more reasons than simply wanting to own a great, very fun movie to watch. I will also order it out of the memory of my best friend, a son I thought of more as a brother than my child, and simply one heck of a great guy that a lot of people will miss...like just about everyone who had the pleasure to have met him.But for those of you just looking for a great movie to buy and watch, I highly recommend this movie.

The acting, writing and execution of this film were all absolutely awe-inspiring, but nothing about this movie was so jaw-dropping as the fact that it completely tanked at the box office.If Disney's marketing department hadn't dropped the ball (as they did with their 1991 overlooked gem, 'The Rocketeer') and left the title as it appears at the end of the film, 'JOHN CARTER OF MARS', it might have made the film more accessible to people who had absolutely no knowledge of this archetypal and iconic science-fantasy legend.  With the exceptions of a few elitist, die-hard ERB purists who carped about every little change, I don't know anyone who's seen JCM and disliked it.  JCM could've been multi-marketed as an adventure, a sci-fantasy, comedic (~not~ a comedy, though), and above all else, a love story, but Disney acted like they didn't know what they had on their hands.  That is truly a shame, because, even putting the books aside, the movie they made is phenomenal and it got lambasted unfairly.So, I implore you to at least watch, if not outright buy, 'JOHN CARTER OF MARS' when it comes out on BRD and DVD.

You don't have to completely understand the mythos behind the novel to enjoy this film, and the various Classical, Biblical, and mythological allusions add something to the story.Quite a miscellany of cast: Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, and, perhaps most of all, Willem Dafoe as an 8-foot-tall, 4-armed Martian (!) all play their parts very well. The start-to-finish narration that takes the audience by the hand, relating every detail and event (right up to the Disney logo) is a device that would usually be ruinous, but it's both helpful and humorous, adding another quirky appeal to JOHN CARTER.

As a kid reading the Barsoom series I would never have hoped (Nor dreamed) that they would have transferred it to film. I am disappointed that Disney failed to market this properly. I mean for crying out loud the title alone would scare off anybody not familiar with the series. They should have used some reference to John Carter ""Of Mars"" rather than the bland ""John Carter"". The only people that would understand the marketing as it stood would be old (or new) fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs. We at least had a clue. Sadly this probably means no sequels to a marvelous adaptation. I hope that I am wrong, but the so called critics raked this over the coals so badly, I don't know if it can recover.I don't usually like the new movies being released too much gratuitous violence and graphic sex, that it takes away the enjoyment of going to the movies anymore.

Juvenile from beginning to end, and Carter's jumping ""flying"" scenes right out of all those Asian Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon flicks where people sailed through the air on ""erased"" ropes and tethers. So why did I watch the whole movie after I knew it was a total loser in the first ten minutes? I'm a sucker for superb special effects and no one can take that away from the makers of this silly, near indecipherable waste of good talent. In my rarely humble opinion, the whole cast was miscast. Nothing personal, the people are good actors, just too pretty, too young, too whatever. The movie lacks dirt, dust, grime, and grit, if that makes any sense. The whole thing is too clean, too shiny, the CGI too perfect. It's the difference, I suspect, between this Disney/Pixar epic, and Industrial Light & Magic who do the more sophisticated CGI films. Why STAR WARS (ILM) at its worst, was never boring, slow, or lacking the ""wow"" factor. Whereas John Carter strives for Lord Of The Rings quality but falls flat on all accounts. I know it's really being picky to say so, but even young kids know that neither of the two moons of Mars are spherical. And in every night scene here, there they are, always in the same place, spaced the same distance apart, no drama, no sense that we're really on another planet. Okay, one big positive to end with. I did like the ending. Strangely enough. The final plot twist was clever, but comes way too late (like at the very end of the movie)is way too little, and can't even begin to save this film from the ""coulda been great"" junk pile.

I will bow to no one as a fan of Burroughs because I am a third generation reader, having first editions of some of the books from grandparents, and I have passed this love to children and grandchildren.  I have collected a great deal of Edgar Rice Burroughs material, but I hold most dear a letter from him in 1947.  As a kid I had the gall to send him a story idea, something I realized later that few professional authors are happy to receive.  ERB was very gracious and sent me a letter expressing his appreciation and complimented me on my imagination as an eleven year old.  He encouraged me to keep writing which I have in one form or another.I had seen the awful John Carter of Mars film on the SyFy Channel and frankly worried about how this film would be handled.  I need not have worried as Disney did an excellent job.  Not exactly like the original novel, A Princess of Mars, but very close and all my favorite people were there.  We have the great beauty of the planet which I cannot see why some critics felt was boring.  It was an honest depiction of the planet Barsoom which I read about as a kid and later reread.  John Carter is pretty much as I imagined him, ""the incomparable"" Dejah Thoris is a beautiful warrior princess, Tars Tarkis and other Tharks are exactly as I envisioned they would be and it was so good to see Woola.  As a kid I wanted a Calot for a pet.  I liked certain things added to  the film not in the book.  Such things as Civil War flashbacks that gave us a picture of why John Carter was the type of person he turned out to be once on Mars.  The story was very well done and the special effects met the visions I had when I read the original books.I have seen the film more than once, and outside of family members who knew details from me, I found that describing certain aspects about Mars in the original books helped make this an enjoyable film for those who had never experienced ERB.  It is also possible that Tarzan films, so often rerun on TV. hurt John Carter  because of expectations.  We do need to advise people that the Tarzan in the films, as much as we loved Johnny W., are definitely not the Tarzan in the books.  Burroughs himself was not that happy with those films, however they were money makers. We think he would have loved this film.  I am critical about the marketing as and feel that Barnes and Noble and other stores should have been able to release the works of ERB much earlier than waiting for the film to come out.  At least that is what happened where I live.  Just as The Hunger Gams wetted the appetite for kids to see the film, which I personally was not that sold on, there would have been a greater desire to see John Carter.  I also believe it would have been wiser to keep the original title, A Princess of Mars.Sadly I have heard that Disney has dropped plans for a sequel.

1467943,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAIH2W,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","JOHN CARTER (a/k/a JOHN CARTER OF MARS, Dir. Andrew Stanton, 132 minutes, 2012, based on the novelA Princess of Marsby Edgar Rice Burroughs) was one of the most swashbuckling, rollicking fun films I have seen in these long years. I absolutely LOVED it like I love few other films.The folks at Disney have not been sleeping, I can tell you! Neither was Burroughs, who spun this off into theThe John Carter of Mars Series (5 Books)series of novels (a/k/a ""The Barsoom Series"", Barsoom being the Martians' word for Mars). Sadly and oddly, this film would flop like almost no other Disney flop. Let's hope it hits cult status rapidly, which is the least we can do to show our appreciation.Briefly, Captain John Carter (an incredibly hunky yet otherworldly young soul named Taylor Kitsch who somehow manages to occasionally look like Josh Brolin) is a Civil War cavalryman from Virginia, fighting for the South. Full of spunk and vinegar, through machinations I won't really ruin here, Carter finds himself on Mars facing a tall green four-armed warrior chief, Tars Tharkas (Willem Dafoe) of the Tharks. Carter's struggle to adapt to the gravitation of Mars is one of several sequences that will make you howl with laughter.Honestly, you'll have fun seeing how quickly and elegantly this comes about - but I won't tell other than to give you one clue. When John Carter realizes how he got there he equates it with a telegram. This will feed hugely into the storyline.Carter - who is affectionately nicknamed and called ""Virginia"" because he made the error of mentioning it - becomes adopted into the giant green tribe. They try to stand out of the way of an ongoing war between two giant factions of normal humans - blue-blooded Martian humans, of course. The relatively good guys are led by an impressive Tardos Mors (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), father of Princess Dejah Thoris (a very beautiful Lynn Collins).Manipulating space-time in a most psychopathic way is a bunch of baldheaded creeps led by Matai Shang (Mark Strong) and we must hate them, because what they are doing to Mars they plan to do to Earth very soon. In any case, not wanting to mess this up for you any further, I can only insist that you get this DVD and enjoy the heck out of it.I can't begin to list the ways this film might have been ruined. Kitsch is absolutely enjoyable and believable (though no one seemed to think he needed to actually sound like a Virginian). This could have turned into a meathead Bruce Campbell-fest. Those fests have their limited place, but not here. In no way is this wonderful adventure ruined, except perhaps a few sequences that might remind you too much of ""Star Wars"" though Burroughs wrote it like that anyway. Even the musical score is picture-perfect.Honestly, I do not know why these top-notch films (this is in the running for Oscars, mark my words) are ignored by the public. The TV teaser-trailers I saw were absolutely pathetic because Disney had no choice. One other thing: this film marks the record for being on somebody's shelf but never being made, until they started shooting in 2010. This had been in the works, in one company or another, since the mid-1930s. Can you believe it?Now it's been done great justice, and released on the 100th anniversary of its original appearance as a serial in 1912. Burroughs was so embarrassed by the whole thing he released it under a pseudonym. Yet it would become almost as popular as his other great creation, Tarzan. It was then Burroughs showed his true colors, and created more John Carter of Mars adventures.Don't miss this witty, hilarious family film that has a PG-13 rating purely for Taylor Kitsch's marvelous body and the time the camera spends on it. (No complaints from me.) For Goddess' sake, please don't miss this.With the talents of Samantha Morton, Thomas Haden Church, Dominic West, and heir apparent to Shia LaBeouf: Daryl Sabara as a young Edgar Rice Burroughs.",5,"""Flying is good!!""",1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,3931,"['JOHN', 'CARTER', 'a/k/a', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'OF', 'MARS', 'Dir', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', '132', 'minutes', '2012', 'based', 'novelA', 'Princess', 'Marsby', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'swashbuckling', 'rollicking', 'fun', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'years', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'love', 'few', 'other', 'films.The', 'folks', 'Disney', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'sleeping', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'Burroughs', 'who', 'spun', 'off', 'theThe', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'Series', '5', 'Books', 'series', 'novels', 'Barsoom', 'Series', 'Barsoom', 'being', 'Martians', 'word', 'Mars', 'Sadly', 'oddly', 'film', 'would', 'flop', 'almost', 'other', 'Disney', 'flop', 'Let', 'hope', 'cult', 'status', 'rapidly', 'least', 'can', 'do', 'show', 'appreciation.Briefly', 'Captain', 'John', 'Carter', 'incredibly', 'hunky', 'yet', 'otherworldly', 'young', 'soul', 'named', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'who', 'somehow', 'manages', 'occasionally', 'look', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Civil', 'War', 'cavalryman', 'Virginia', 'fighting', 'South', 'Full', 'spunk', 'vinegar', 'machinations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'ruin', 'here', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'facing', 'tall', 'green', 'four-armed', 'warrior', 'chief', 'Tars', 'Tharkas', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Tharks', 'Carter', 'struggle', 'adapt', 'gravitation', 'Mars', 'one', 'several', 'sequences', 'will', 'make', 'howl', 'laughter.Honestly', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'seeing', 'how', 'quickly', 'elegantly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'other', 'give', 'one', 'clue', 'When', 'John', 'Carter', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'telegram', 'will', 'feed', 'hugely', 'storyline.Carter', 'who', 'affectionately', 'nicknamed', 'called', 'Virginia', 'made', 'error', 'mentioning', 'becomes', 'adopted', 'giant', 'green', 'tribe', 'try', 'stand', 'way', 'ongoing', 'war', 'two', 'giant', 'factions', 'normal', 'humans', 'blue-blooded', 'Martian', 'humans', 'course', 'relatively', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'led', 'impressive', 'Tardos', 'Mors', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'father', 'Princess', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Lynn', 'Collins', '.Manipulating', 'space-time', 'most', 'psychopathic', 'way', 'bunch', 'baldheaded', 'creeps', 'led', 'Matai', 'Shang', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'must', 'hate', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Mars', 'plan', 'do', 'Earth', 'very', 'soon', 'case', 'not', 'wanting', 'mess', 'up', 'further', 'can', 'only', 'insist', 'get', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'heck', 'it.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'list', 'ways', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'Kitsch', 'absolutely', 'enjoyable', 'believable', 'one', 'seemed', 'think', 'needed', 'actually', 'sound', 'Virginian', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'meathead', 'Bruce', 'Campbell-fest', 'fests', 'have', 'limited', 'place', 'not', 'here', 'way', 'wonderful', 'adventure', 'ruined', 'perhaps', 'few', 'sequences', 'might', 'remind', 'too', 'much', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Burroughs', 'wrote', 'anyway', 'Even', 'musical', 'score', 'picture-perfect.Honestly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'top-notch', 'films', 'running', 'Oscars', 'mark', 'words', 'are', 'ignored', 'public', 'TV', 'teaser-trailers', 'saw', 'were', 'absolutely', 'pathetic', 'Disney', 'had', 'choice', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'film', 'record', 'being', 'somebody', 'shelf', 'never', 'being', 'made', 'started', 'shooting', '2010', 'had', 'been', 'works', 'one', 'company', 'mid-1930s', 'Can', 'believe', 'Now', 'been', 'done', 'great', 'justice', 'released', '100th', 'anniversary', 'original', 'appearance', 'serial', '1912', 'Burroughs', 'was', 'so', 'embarrassed', 'whole', 'thing', 'released', 'pseudonym', 'would', 'become', 'almost', 'as', 'popular', 'other', 'great', 'creation', 'Tarzan', 'was', 'then', 'Burroughs', 'showed', 'true', 'colors', 'created', 'more', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'adventures.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'witty', 'hilarious', 'family', 'film', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'purely', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'marvelous', 'body', 'time', 'camera', 'complaints', 'Goddess', 'sake', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'this.With', 'talents', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Dominic', 'West', 'apparent', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Daryl', 'Sabara', 'young', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs']",N/A

1467948,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005LAIH2W,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[6, 7]","As one of the internet's resident scribes on all things movie, I'll not be the first - nor certainly the last - to lambast the treatment JOHN CARTER received at the box office.  The short version of this sad history is that JOHN CARTER was the perfect popcorn flick that deserved better - better from fans, better from the studio who made the film, and (far, far) better from the critical community that mostly drubbed it a `disaster' for all the wrong reasons - and, hopefully, it will get better at some point because, arguably, there's no better inspiration for science fiction and fantasy than Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 novel that started the craze.Others have already gone to great lengths to dissect precisely how badly conceived was Walt Disney's marketing scheme for the picture, but, to be honest, I think the failings of the film to garner the success it deserved from the box office goes much deeper.  How do you take a book titled ""A Princess of Mars"" and, then, make a film that goes through so many name changes that it ends up with something as simple as JOHN CARTER?  Not even JOHN CARTER OF MARS, as it was briefly called by some executive who, at least, realized it might be worthwhile to reference Burroughs' original material?  I think a strong case could be made - and probably will be made in some astute article some day by a film scholar - that the property was put in the hands of folks who didn't quite know what to do with it.  Is it STAR WARS?  Is it CONAN, THE BARBARIAN?  Is it STAR TREK?In short, JOHN CARTER was based on the best example of pulp fiction available to all of mankind.  Burroughs' original classic served as an inspiration to not only the best writers in the science fiction & fantasy field, but it led folks like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to want to make movies in their respective universes.  Burroughs' prose has even been cited as an inspiration to Carl Sagan and even astronaut Terrence Wilcutt.  While the question will remain for ages why the film wasn't as successful as it deserved to be, it stands to reason that the original creation will continue to inspire countless folks in the years ahead.Taylor Kitsch does an admirable job bringing the principle character of Carter to life on the silver screen, and the lovely Lynn Collins steals every young boy's heart as the princess herself, Dejah Thoris.  The film was heavily supported by special effects, as many of the inhabitants of Mars had to be mastered with CGI.  Willem Dafoe was the most noticeable voice talent as Tars Tarkas, while James Purefoy performed respectably as Kantos Kan.  The effects were all top-notch - though a handful of sequences appeared a bit too elementary for my tastes - and they were integrated fairly seamlessly with the live action.While much could be made about the ineffective marketing by Disney's usually stellar advertising staff, I tend to think that the confusion over the property itself - just who is this John Carter character? - really killed any momentum the picture could've achieved.  In fact, the film never tracked all the well in the lead-up to its release, and if that doesn't indicate some fault on the part of the advertisers then I don't know who to blame.  Clearly, Burroughs' creation has an audience.  Disney never quite tapped into it, and that's probably because no one involved in drafting a marketing plan was even familiar with the franchise.  Instead, they relied on the picture - which dabbled liberally in the adventures on Barsoom (aka Mars) - and they were undone as a consequence.Having read most of the first novel, I can say that the story that made it to the silver screen is a respectful adaptation, but it strayed from the source material like any adaption does.  There was so much more to these various tribes and cultures in the book that may've made for a greater plot - not to mention the depth of characters that were reduced to general devices instead of fully fleshed creations - and, audience attention span being what it is, I can understand why some folks may've struggled a bit to grasp it all.  The central good-versus-evil story could've used a bit more beefing up, but, at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder how much of it seemed a bit too much like `fluff' for kids (not that there's anything wrong with that!).Lastly, I thought the pacing of the film suffered a bit in the middle third of the picture.  There's a fair amount of set-up that occupies the first third, and, where most second acts build on the drama and mystery of these introductions, JOHN CARTER sort of struggled and groped around a bit to find the story it wanted to tell.  The third act is, mostly, a traditional adventure picture, and it works very well on that level ... but the uneven presentation of that second act may've helped stifle strong word-of-mouth from audience members mostly unfamiliar with the material.  I can remember thinking that, after I saw the film, the story as presented might worked better had it been expanded to either two or three films; the end result of this would've been to give storytellers more space to work with fleshing out the people, places, and history of Barsoom - much in the same way Peter Jackson did with THE LORD OF THE RINGS films - but, alas, it wasn't meant to be.With as much as Disney spent on JOHN CARTER, it'll always remain a bit of a mystery as to why the finished product wasn't as successful as it could've been.  I think we'll be debating it for the ages, but, in the meantime, there's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying the film as is: a rip-roaring return to old school entertainment ... where men are men ... dogs are, well, big dogs ... and there's a princess and a bunch of rather obvious villains thrown into the mix.  While it only hints at the magic from the original STAR WARS trilogy, JOHN CARTER will hopefully continue to be discovered and rediscovered in the generations yet to experience it.STRONGLY

1467953,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B005LAIH2W,Enjolras,"[7, 9]","First of all, I agree with the majority of reviewers in that John Carter is nowhere as bad as many ""professional"" film critics alleged. Disney seemed to denigrate its own movie before it even came out. It's a shame it did, because John Carter is worth viewing if you like sci-fi/fantasy.I also give the filmmakers a lot of credit for keeping the story on Mars, as in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs book, and not changing it to another planet. The Martian landscape as a background works really well and makes for some beautiful imagery.That said, the plot is a bit convoluted. There's a lot of talk about a 9th ray and aliens changing history, but it seems largely inconsequential next to the more traditional and immediate plot of the hero recruiting natives to save the princess. John Carter himself is imprisoned about half a dozen times, each time for a few seconds or so, which ruins the tension and suspense of each imprisonment.The film also suffers from uneven pacing. Some parts move very quickly, while at other times my attention started to wander. Some of the highlights - including the stadium fight with the White Apes featured in much of the promotional material - end up being very short, whereas John Carter's initial leaps on Mars seemed to go on forever. I could see this being a much more popular film if Disney decides to do a special edition re-edit (which is unlikely, unfortunately).Overall, it's a pretty fun film, but flawed in some important ways.

That, however, has very little to do with the movie itself. Put aside the stupid naming and the bizarre advertising choices. Lets look at the movie itself.The movie is actually remarkably faithful in tone to the book Princess of Mars even while changing some of the specifics. Instead of trying to update Edgar Rice Burroughs vision, it simply embraces it. And that's probably my favorite thing about it. The creatures and devices are fantastical and the scale of the cities is epic.There's also plenty of action. Sword fights, flying, jumping. It's all there. And the plot, while simplistic (it's a blockbuster) is easy enough to follow.It's the characters where things fall down. Outside of John Carter and Dejah Thoris have decent character arcs, but no one else gets developed at all.Strangely John Carter seems both too long and too short at the same time. At 2 hours 20 minutes the story drags at times, yet some aspects feel like they were never properly fleshed out.Personally I think I would have cut down the framing story to a minimum and used that time to build up the secondary characters a bit more.Overall then it's a fun movie, but ultimately not very memorable.

Folks, we're not just supposed to wax on about what we think of the movie - we're supposed to review the whole experience.So, here it is. The Disney film adaptation of John Carter of Mars. This is a film that was attempted in the past and the technology simply did not exist. My first encounter with the John Carter character was the 1970's Marvel comics (which I still have in storage thankfully). He was the strongest, fastest, and considered to be the best hero earth had to offer to Mars.Barsoom is simply amazing. Every small detail, right down to the punishment brands, was not put into the film because it looked cool - it was there because it made for a action packed motion picture designed to introduce this 100 year old character of literature to a new audience. So, some exceptions might have been made during production. Go read the books (Princess from Mars comes first) and then watch the film. Then make up your own mind. I simply loved it.This is one of those BD releases I wait for - amazing cinematography and editing along with... wait for it... a 7.1 DTS-HD, and it plays wonderfully though the right system and a great HD TV.As for the behind the scenes, we get a doggie bag filled with little but interesting featurettes: deleted scenes, bloopers, commentary, but nothing new.If you make claim to be a fan of pulp and classical sci-fi and you have an awareness of the character, I think you'll likely enjoy this fun romp across the expanse of Mars.

Ray,"[7, 9]","Having devoured a lot of Edgar Rice Burroughs' pulp fiction as a boy in the early sixties, I have always been amazed at how little of the sense of adventure that permeated his writing ever came out in his various screen adaptations.  Some were good films in their own right (the first couple of Weismueler Tarzans, the last couple of Scott Tarzans, and even Lambert's jungle man of later years), but were simply not Burroughs.  Moreover, the exotic settings on Mars, Venus, etc. were mostly avoided due to their effects requirements (the one Pellucidar film, ""At the Earth's Core,"" being below average at best).  So, I was quite interested in checking out ""John Carter,"" which was tackling perhaps the most effects-heavy of Burroughs' series as well as his best (in my opinion).  After reading some reviews (a few positive, most mixed, and a couple of, frankly, snarky and unworthy efforts aimed at defaming the film's director), I caught ""John Carter"" in 2-D with my wife.  We were both very impressed.  It's beautiful, exciting, and a real tribute to how modern technology and a good feel for the subject matter by the film-makers can create a masterpiece!  Moreover, I felt that I was finally seeing and experiencing the Burroughs I had read.I went back to see this movie again in 3D (which didn't add a thing, indeed, I though it was actually better in 2D) and enjoyed it even more the second time around.  It's sad to think that there will probably not be sequels due to the poor box office (for whatever reason, but certainly not the film's exceedingly high quality).  I would have loved seeing the original trilogy done to this level of excellence, with a series carried on to at least ""The Chessmen of Mars,"" the fifth of Burroughs' Martian books and, for my money, the best thing that he ever wrote.  I can only compare what is happening to ""John Carter"" to what took place long ago with regard to ""The Wizard of OZ.""  That was the most expensive film that MGM had ever made and a big box office flop, which doomed the many wonderful sequels that Baum's great book series might have spawned.  MGM eventually recouped its investment through re-releases (not available today, though perhaps the DVD/cable markets are somewhat akin) and the film went on to become the beloved classic that it is now almost universally considered to be.  I can only hope that ""John Carter"" will see a similar future of proper honors.  If so, though not the financial boon to its makers that it should have been, it will at least give them the recognition they richly deserve for creating a true masterwork.  I know that its DVD incarnation will always have a treasured place in my own extensive film library.",5,"Finally, a Buroughs Film Adaptation Done Right!",1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,2696,"['Having', 'devoured', 'lot', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'boy', 'early', 'sixties', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'amazed', 'how', 'little', 'sense', 'adventure', 'permeated', 'writing', 'ever', 'came', 'out', 'various', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'were', 'good', 'films', 'own', 'right', 'first', 'couple', 'Weismueler', 'Tarzans', 'last', 'couple', 'Scott', 'Tarzans', 'even', 'Lambert', 'jungle', 'man', 'later', 'years', 'were', 'simply', 'not', 'Burroughs', 'Moreover', 'exotic', 'settings', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'etc', 'were', 'mostly', 'avoided', 'due', 'effects', 'requirements', 'one', 'Pellucidar', 'film', 'Earth', 'Core', 'being', 'below', 'average', 'best', 'So', 'was', 'quite', 'interested', 'checking', 'out', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'tackling', 'perhaps', 'most', 'effects-heavy', 'Burroughs', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'opinion', 'reading', 'reviews', 'few', 'positive', 'most', 'mixed', 'couple', 'frankly', 'snarky', 'unworthy', 'efforts', 'aimed', 'defaming', 'film', 'director', 'caught', 'John', 'Carter', '2-D', 'wife', 'were', 'very', 'impressed', 'beautiful', 'exciting', 'real', 'tribute', 'how', 'modern', 'technology', 'good', 'feel', 'subject', 'matter', 'film-makers', 'can', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'Moreover', 'felt', 'was', 'finally', 'seeing', 'experiencing', 'Burroughs', 'had', 'read.I', 'went', 'back', 'see', 'movie', 'again', '3D', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'thing', 'indeed', 'was', 'actually', 'better', '2D', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'sad', 'think', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'sequels', 'due', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'reason', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'exceedingly', 'high', 'quality', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'seeing', 'original', 'trilogy', 'done', 'level', 'excellence', 'series', 'carried', 'least', 'Chessmen', 'Mars', 'fifth', 'Burroughs', 'Martian', 'books', 'money', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'wrote', 'can', 'only', 'compare', 'what', 'happening', 'John', 'Carter', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'long', 'ago', 'regard', 'Wizard', 'OZ', 'was', 'most', 'expensive', 'film', 'MGM', 'had', 'ever', 'made', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'doomed', 'many', 'wonderful', 'sequels', 'Baum', 'great', 'book', 'series', 'might', 'have', 'spawned', 'MGM', 'eventually', 'recouped', 'investment', 're-releases', 'not', 'available', 'today', 'perhaps', 'DVD/cable', 'markets', 'are', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'film', 'went', 'become', 'beloved', 'classic', 'now', 'almost', 'universally', 'considered', 'be', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'John', 'Carter', 'will', 'see', 'similar', 'future', 'proper', 'honors', 'so', 'not', 'financial', 'boon', 'makers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'will', 'least', 'give', 'recognition', 'richly', 'deserve', 'creating', 'true', 'masterwork', 'know', 'DVD', 'incarnation', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'treasured', 'place', 'own', 'extensive', 'film', 'library']",N/A

I had read the Barsoom series in high school in the 1960s, and she was nearly through the ""Hunger Games"" books. We both liked ""John Carter"" better as a movie, and chose to go watch it again as soon as we could.  There are differences from the book -- the Therns in particular right off, but I consider that an acceptable ""update"" in view of what we have come to expect of sci-fi since 1917. The CGI creatures were great! Very believable. The Green barbarians don't look like Frazetta's; they look much better. I did not expect the humor, but it was fun and in the right amounts in the right places. The Martians wear more clothes than in the books, but hey, it's Disney; it doesn't hurt the story. We also loved the Art Nouveau flavor of the Martian architecture, tatoos, armor, etc. The palace in Helium was stunningly beautiful.No, Carter here does not come off as charismatic as, say, Brad Pitt's Achilles, but he's a lonely, depressed Civil War vet who's lost his family in a particularly tragic way, and a man of action, not of philosophical words and exquisite sensibilities.  It works for me just fine.  I also enjoyed Ms. Collins as a capable, intelligent woman, who doesn't overdo it as if she had a feminist revenge chip on her shoulder: her Martian princess is confident in who she is and is ""at home in her skin,"" as some say. Beautiful, over-acting women with lots of attiude but no athletic skill to go with it can be really annoying and ruin an action movie, but Collins shows how it should be done. Other supporting actors (including some familiar, competent Brit faces) are also reliably ""on key.""We don't have a 3D tech TV, or I'd get the 3D.  This was the first movie I tried to watch in 3D and actually enjoyed it that way, but without 3D the colors are more vibrant, so both are good.

1467975,A3OZ7RXT1XGZR9,B005LAIH2W,freeismylife,"[16, 21]","I will be upfront in saying that John Carter is not the best Disney movie I have seen.  But if you like your movies with tons of action, where your senses are on total overload throughout the entire duration, then John Carter is for you.John Carter is based on a series of old novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs which tells the story of Confederate war military caption John Carter (played by Taylor Kitsch) who by happenstance, goes on an adventure that it truly out of this world.In the story, Captain John Carter is a honorable man who has dedicated this military career to helping to protect western settlers.  But he ends up losing his compassion after tragic events happen in his life.  Now disillusioned, he vows to help no one.  But in his quest to find gold, he discovers a medallion that takes him from Earth to Mars (also called Barssom) where another war is going on between two cultures - the Zodangans and the Helimites.  The Zodangans plan to wipe out the Helimites with the help of a strange blue power given to them by Martai Shang (played by Mark Strong), the King of an advance race of people called the Therns.  The Therns can change apperance at anytime and blend into any culture to alter the course of events as they see fit.Carter is initially captured by a group of four armed, green creatures called Tharks who are just waiting for the Zodangans and the Helmites to kill off each other off so that the Tharks can take over Mars.  To end the war, the Helimite princess Dejah Thoris (played by Lynn Collins) has been pledged in marriage to Sab Than (played by Dominic West), the evil king of the Zodangans.  But Dejah runs away to save herself from a loveless marriage and ends up meeting John Carter.  Carter finds that by helping Princess Dejah, he can heal himself from the past and maybe find a new life on Barssom (Mars).The main problem you will find with John Carter is that there are so many characters, and storylines, and cultures, and languages, and plot twists and turns in the movie that it is all a little too much for the audience.  It's like a wild 3D video game where the audience is on complete overload for two full hours trying to figure out what is going on while enjoying all the 3D effects.  This movie may have a complex storyline because Disney is staying true to the original books. Since I have not read any of the stories, I am not sure this is the case.But despite the complexity, John Carter is a spectacular movie to watch.  The 3D was beautiful and the fight scenes are grand and thrilling.  My son was engaged for the entire two hours - there is no way that anyone will be bored while watching this movie. Most of the movie is computer generated graphics that show a make believe Mars (Barssom) that is visually wonderful to watch containing complex flying machines, intricate cities in the sky, and epic battles.And the movie does not take itself too seriously. There are moments where John Carter does things (like learning to walk on Mars in zero gravity or going to the wrong city when he attempts to save the princess) that make the audience burst out laughing.  And there are so many fight scenes in the movie that at one point even Carter makes a joke out of fighting yet another epic battle.For parents, even though John Carter is a Disney movie, it is rated PG-13 for a good reason. There is plenty of cursing in the first 30 minutes of the movie. And the movie is full of violence from beginning to end.  If your children are use to viewing video game violence, then they should be fine with seeing John Carter.  But just a warning that there was one scene involving a branding iron that was particularly hard to watch.My son totally enjoyed this movie, even though the end was so complex, he (and a lot of other people in the audience) were scratching their heads trying to understand it all.  The way the movie ends, a sequel to John Carter will probably be in theaters in the near future.John Carter is rated PG-13 and opens in theaters TODAY, Friday, March 9th.  If you are going to see it, please pay the extra money to see it in 3D.  It is totally worth it.",4,John Carter is a spectacular movie to watch.

1467980,A3CJIC7A4A7KJ2,B005LAIH2W,Gary Fisher,"[5, 6]","In ""John Carter"" we meet characters and themes which marked the birth of modern science fiction and inspired both scientists (such as Carl Sagan) and writers (Clarke, Bradbury, and countless others) in the century which followed the original publication of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels.  Disney's treatment doesn't slavishly parrot the novels, and includes material from more than one of them, but is as true to the original as the images in the minds of most of the millions of readers who have enjoyed these stories since their first publication (as ""Under the Moons of Mars"") in 1912.There's a sharp irony in the fact that Disney, the epitome of the Hollywood Establishment, was so badly burned by the Hollywood Establishment when almost universally bad reviews (and that can be read both ways) kept moviegoers away from what may be the finest Disney release in years.  If you're a fan -- and why else would you be reading this page? -- consider your purchase of this DVD a vote, perhaps not for Disney but for Barsoom, for Burroughs, for the classics of science fiction, and for those who invested so much time, effort and money in this film and might be persuaded to continue the ""John Carter"" series of films in the future.",5,Poetic Injustice?,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,1229,"['John', 'Carter', 'meet', 'characters', 'themes', 'marked', 'birth', 'modern', 'science', 'fiction', 'inspired', 'scientists', 'such', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'writers', 'Clarke', 'Bradbury', 'countless', 'others', 'century', 'followed', 'original', 'publication', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'novels', 'Disney', 'treatment', ""n't"", 'slavishly', 'parrot', 'novels', 'material', 'more', 'one', 'as', 'true', 'original', 'images', 'minds', 'most', 'millions', 'readers', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'first', 'publication', 'Moons', 'Mars', '1912.There', 'sharp', 'irony', 'fact', 'Disney', 'epitome', 'Hollywood', 'Establishment', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'burned', 'Hollywood', 'Establishment', 'when', 'almost', 'universally', 'bad', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'ways', 'kept', 'moviegoers', 'away', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'Disney', 'release', 'years', ""'re"", 'fan', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'reading', 'page', 'consider', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'vote', 'perhaps', 'not', 'Disney', 'Barsoom', 'Burroughs', 'classics', 'science', 'fiction', 'who', 'invested', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'money', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'persuaded', 'continue', 'John', 'Carter', 'series', 'films', 'future']",N/A

Visually, this movie is truly stunning. The CGI and special effects are fantastic, and the various alien critters look really cool. It's true that the creature design is also a bit on the goofy side, but it works really well with the style of the movie. The locations that were chosen to film were excellent, and greatly resemble what I would imagine the red landscapes of Mars to look like.In terms of story, John Carter is very entertaining. I never read the novel (""A Princess of Mars""), so I can't say how true it is to the original source, but I liked the background for the protagonist. It's a very cool take to have him from the civil war era, and his background is fleshed out perfectly for the (very strange) task at hand. His experience with resiliency, combat, and surviving in vastly different cultures suits his unintended expedition on Mars perfectly. Furthermore, it's a clever trick to explain his rather remarkable abilities on Mars (super strength and crazy jumping) as a result of the difference in gravitational forces on Earth and Mars.Unfortunately, the pace does start to get bogged down in the middle of the movie, which seems to happen far too often in the ""epic movie"" genre.

Who wants to pay big bucks at the theater to watch a &#34;major&#34; motion picture that does not have any &#34;major&#34; stars in it? There were 11 books in The Martian Tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs. The second mistake was taking bits and pieces from 4 of the books and trying to make it into 1 movie and then coming up with an ending that Burroughs never wrote in any of the books. Now, the scenery, action, costumes, special effects were all amazing; that's the only thing Disney got right in this movie.

My first mistake was to pull out my copy of 'A Princess of Mars' when I saw the ads for the movie. I don't know how many times I have read this book but the first time was as a teenager. So I am watching the movie with a favorite book fresh in my mind.I recognize the melding of two books in the series. What I fail to see is why. It is as if the director had only read the Cliff Notes versions of the two books. Also he and the production designer had never seen the Frank Frazetta drawings that set the imagery of Mars for so many generations.In casting, the actor who played Carter did not come close in appearance or stature. Deja Thoris, was okay but only okay.Costume design; I realize they couldn't use the Frazetta drawings as a start and get a PG-13 rating, they probably couldn't get a 'R', but really. What pops into my mind is a lighter version of the costumes from 'Dune'.CGI design; who in their minds say the Tharks as skinny. Or equates tusks with demented cow horns. The flying machines were acceptable. I can see how the designers would arrive at that from Burroughs' descriptions. They were far more visually complicated for flying machines than believable. More similar to making a clipper ship fly.I really looked forward to this movie. Wife and son otherwise occupied so I wouldn't be interrupted, popcorn ready, surround sound on.

However, as some correctly predicted, it was a big hit overseas -- and premiered at #1 on Blu-ray and DVD last week.One must wonder how many formed their opinions about the film based on the widely reported lack of ticket sales. There has been lots of finger pointing for the losses, but perhaps the fault wasn't the film so much as with the timing. Did theater audiences want another scifi-fantasy epic franchise? Who knows?John Carter is not a perfect film, but it is very far from a catastrophe. Visually, the stunning imagery, especially on Blu-ray, cannot be denied. The years of work and the big budget shows on screen. Meticulous details abound that make the film very rewatchable. I was struck by the clear glass in the air ships -- it was uneven, as if the glass was hand-made. The look combined high tech with the 19th century (which did remind my wife of Treasure Planet, another very good Disney feature that fizzled in theaters).The film's shortcomings are so well-documented, you don't need me to recount them. On the positive side, there is some humor, especially the ""Virginia"" running gag. One of the best characters in the film is James Purefoy as Kantos Kan (yes, it's hard to keep track of the names and I had to look it up), who amusingly forces his own capture in a climactic battle scene.The toughest roles are the leads, and Taylor Kitsch fares no better than the more well-known Jake Gyllenhaal in Prince of Persia. Neither actor can be held totally responsible when they're shouldering such a massive movie. The princess role, which proved problematic to the filmmakers, who had trouble reconciling her 100-year old persona with contemporary expectations, is handled with deft skill by Lynn Collins.The film has some great shape-shifting villains offering lots of potential for future adaptations. There is also a fascinating parallel narrative centering on Edgar Rice Burroughs as a character in the 19th century, learning the secrets of Carter as he unknowingly dodges the bad guys (I would have liked to have seen more of this story thread).The point is, John Carter is a rousing spectacle that is a must-see for action, scifi, fantasy and adventure movies in the Spielberg/Lucas style. Whether we'll ever see more of this world, in perhaps an animated TV version, is certainly unlikely from where the property stands today.But the same could have been said for Tron and Newsies.

1467997,A22GPW98OSS55,B005LAIH2W,Gregory Hinds,"[0, 0]","I first read ""A Princess of Mars"" before I was 10, well over fifty years ago, and I was immediately hooked on Burroughs although, strangely enough, I never got into the Tarzan stories. It didn't take me long to acquire my first set of the ERB Mars novels and I've read them over and over and over and . . .  The prize of my 800 or so volume collection of fantasy, horror and SF books is a set of the ERB Mars novels with the Frank Frazetta dust covers. I waited all these years for someone to make a passable movie of the John Carter saga and that's what this one is - a passable presentation of the Carter saga.  Why someone feels determined to rewrite the classic Burroughs story is completely beyond me. The original in all its grandeur is pretty much beyond surpassing but the screenwriter (as almost every modern screenwriter does) feels they can improve an original that has withstood almost one hundred years of readers.  Here's what I thought was good and not so good -The opening scenery with its introduction to John Carter was pretty well done.  Although it didn't strictly follow ERB's script, it was close enough for the viewer to get the same idea as to where John Carter came from. The opening scenes with the Tharks were really well done although I've always pictured the Tharks as a little beefier. The dead sea bottoms and the deserted cities were exceptionally well done and the presentation of Woola was priceless - brought tears to my jaundiced eye.  Those who never read the John Carter stories can't recognize that the meeting of John Carter and Woola is every bit as portentious as the first meeting of Spock and Kirk, Holmes and Watson, Morse and Lewis, and even Tarzan and Jane.  As a rule the scene was very well set in the beginning.But then we depart from Burroughs' original plot line and the story starts to lose its original coherence.  The Therns appear out of nowhere with very little introduction of what their place is in Martian society. Tardos Mors and Mors Kajak were given just enough screen time for the non-afficianado to wonder just who they were. The atmosphere plant scenes were pretty much left out - interestingly enough, these were about the only passable scenes in an otherwise disaster of a predecessor production. Whine, whine, whine.The really sad part of this whole thing is that from such a promising first hour or so, the movie died when they left the original story plot.  If they had just stuck with Burroughs' original, they could have stretched this into three or four really block-buster movies (as was done with the Lord of the Rings trilogy recently).  As for poor, pitiful me (and all the other original John Carter fans) we'll have to wait another ten to twenty years (if we live that long) to see if someone attempts to bring this truly classic story out of the rubble that it's now in and do it right.  I gave it four stars mostly because it's the best attempt yet at telling Burroughs' story and I think I'm rating the original novels more than the movie.",4,John Carter,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,3022,"['first', 'read', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'was', '10', 'well', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'immediately', 'hooked', 'Burroughs', 'strangely', 'enough', 'never', 'got', 'Tarzan', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'acquire', 'first', 'set', 'ERB', 'Mars', 'novels', ""'ve"", 'read', 'prize', '800', 'so', 'volume', 'collection', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'SF', 'books', 'set', 'ERB', 'Mars', 'novels', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'dust', 'covers', 'waited', 'years', 'someone', 'make', 'passable', 'movie', 'John', 'Carter', 'saga', 'what', 'one', 'passable', 'presentation', 'Carter', 'saga', 'Why', 'someone', 'feels', 'determined', 'rewrite', 'classic', 'Burroughs', 'story', 'completely', 'original', 'grandeur', 'pretty', 'much', 'surpassing', 'screenwriter', 'almost', 'modern', 'screenwriter', 'feels', 'can', 'improve', 'original', 'withstood', 'almost', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'readers', 'Here', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'good', '-The', 'opening', 'scenery', 'introduction', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'strictly', 'follow', 'ERB', 'script', 'was', 'close', 'enough', 'viewer', 'get', 'same', 'idea', 'where', 'John', 'Carter', 'came', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Tharks', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'done', ""'ve"", 'always', 'pictured', 'Tharks', 'little', 'beefier', 'dead', 'sea', 'bottoms', 'deserted', 'cities', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'presentation', 'Woola', 'was', 'priceless', 'brought', 'tears', 'jaundiced', 'eye', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'John', 'Carter', 'stories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'meeting', 'John', 'Carter', 'Woola', 'bit', 'as', 'portentious', 'first', 'meeting', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'even', 'Tarzan', 'Jane', 'rule', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'set', 'beginning.But', 'then', 'depart', 'Burroughs', 'original', 'plot', 'line', 'story', 'lose', 'original', 'coherence', 'Therns', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'very', 'little', 'introduction', 'what', 'place', 'Martian', 'society', 'Tardos', 'Mors', 'Mors', 'Kajak', 'were', 'given', 'just', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'non-afficianado', 'wonder', 'just', 'who', 'were', 'atmosphere', 'plant', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'were', 'only', 'passable', 'scenes', 'otherwise', 'disaster', 'predecessor', 'production', 'Whine', 'whine', 'whine.The', 'really', 'sad', 'part', 'whole', 'thing', 'promising', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'died', 'when', 'left', 'original', 'story', 'plot', 'had', 'just', 'stuck', 'Burroughs', 'original', 'could', 'have', 'stretched', 'three', 'four', 'really', 'block-buster', 'movies', 'was', 'done', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'recently', 'poor', 'pitiful', 'other', 'original', 'John', 'Carter', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'ten', 'twenty', 'years', 'live', 'long', 'see', 'someone', 'attempts', 'bring', 'truly', 'classic', 'story', 'rubble', 'now', 'do', 'right', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'mostly', 'best', 'attempt', 'yet', 'telling', 'Burroughs', 'story', 'think', ""'m"", 'rating', 'original', 'novels', 'more', 'movie']",N/A

The acting is solid, especially from usual villain Willem Dafoe playing against type, like he did to wonderful effect in the Oliver Stone classic war film PLATOON. The storyline is engaging enough, and the visuals are very impressive, especially in 3-D. The music is also quite good. So, why the three stars?Walt Disney Pictures has always been a family-friendly company, and while some of their latest PG & PG-13-rated films include mild-to-moderate profanity, they HAD NEVER, EVER, EVER combined the Name of God with a mild curse word, thereby taking His Name in vain...until now.

And I have the perspective of having read at least 5 of the Barsoom books when I was a kid. And that is where I would like to start. Movies can never contain everything that was in a book- it is absolutely necessary to strip away the non-essential detail in order to preserve the spirit of the story- and sometimes details must adjust to fit what works in the movies.  The question becomes this: does the movie capture the spirit of the original story?  And the answer here is: Absolutely- in fact I have never seen it done better. I have seldom seen it done as well.  The critics were wrong- the script was very well done, the special effects excellent and the casting was superb.Lynn Collins was absolutely a perfect Dejah Thoris- I remember even when I first saw her in the movie ""They got this exactly right"".So why did this movie not do better? Some blame bad marketting, others just say that it was an anachronism- we no longer really relate to a story that was published almost a century ago. That we have changed too much.  I am going to suggest that the second group are closer to the mark than the first.  I would like to suggest that there is a natural ebb and flow in the things which we treasure.

1468009,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIH2W,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[11, 16]","I'll tell you that Edgar Rice Burroughs was one of my childhood linchpins. He, more than anyone else, instilled in me a love for pulp adventure. And not to play favorites (except I guess I'm gonna) but as much as I relished Lord Greystoke, I'd always preferred Captain John Carter by a hair. It never seemed fair that while Tarzan had garnered so many film adaptations, this swashbuckling Virginian never even got close to a whiff. Until now.JOHN CARTER is admittedly a nebulous film title; I hear you can blame the failure of MARS NEEDS MOMS for Disney's push to disassociate the ERB project from the ""Mars"" label. JOHN CARTER is based (somewhat faithfully) on A PRINCESS OF MARS, the first in Burroughs' eleven volume Barsoom series, with bits from the second volume, THE GODS OF MARS, also peppered in. It's crazy that Burroughs published A PRINCESS OF MARS in serialized form a century ago. But there's a timelessness to John Carter's wild exploits. Gratifyingly, a planetary romance from 1912 still has legs in 2012. No matter the era, it's awesome escapism, a grand adventure. And as an ERB devotee, I can't help but grin big because, just as in the book, Burroughs himself (nicely played by SPY KIDS' Daryl Sabara) bookends the story.JOHN CARTER is Andrew Stanton's debut with directing live-action films, and I think he brings just enough of that heart and that Pixar sensibility that he'd invested in FINDING NEMO and WALL-E, although, no, JOHN CARTER won't be regarded as a classic on the same tier as those two animated gems. But there's a humanity in the story, and dazzling visuals, and unexpected humor. I love the running gag about John Carter's name.***possibly some minor SPOILERS now***The cinematic version of John Carter has been tweaked some. Unlike the gent in the books (who always had his shucks together), the John Carter we view onscreen has baggage. A devastating personal loss has rendered the former Captain of the 1st Virginian Cavalry a shell of his former self. In the untamed Arizona badlands, this Carter is a man without a cause. He only cares about amassing gold. He vigorously rejects the government's ""request"" for his services as an experienced military man, even though he is told by a gristled army colonel that ""Son, we are up to our chin straps in Apaches."" In 1868 Carter's headlong flight from a U.S. cavalry troop leads him to a haunted cave. Moments later, in that cave, a mysterious device catapults him to another world wherein, once again, his services as a fighting man would be required.Let me backtrack a bit, though. I have to mention a sequence on Earth in which Carter, captured by the U.S. Army, persists in one break-out attempt after another. While this is largely played for laughs, this sequence embodies the make-up of Burroughs' heroes. John Carter, Tarzan, Carson of Venus, and others all demonstrate that never-give-up demeanor. I'm so happy they put this sequence in. And it was pretty funny.There's another fun segment soon after he lands On Mars (or ""Barsoom"") in which John Carter learns of the enhanced abilities bestowed him by the planet's lower gravity. Even more than his sudden colossal strength, it's Carter's newfound ability to leap prodigiously that captured my imagination as a kid. There were three things I was anxious to see going into this film, and the film has visualized them marvelously. There's the geek-out thrill of finally seeing the incomparable Dejah Thoris fleshed out. There are the 12-foot-tall Tharks convincingly brought to life. And there are John Carter's astounding leaps. That's levitation, homes. I guess you could throw in the awesome monster dog, Woola, as well.On the barren, war-ravaged wastelands of Barsoom, a Thark's curiousity saves John Carter. Tharks, like most of the planet's indigenous lifeforms, are six-limbed creatures. Tharks are tusked, green-skinned barbarians noted for their savagery and contempt for weakness. Carter is captured by Tharks, his life spared by Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe), a Jeddak (king or leader) who secretly nurses a bump of compassion. Tars Tarkas is like a delighted little kid, wanting to show off Carter's sensational leaps. And you can't blame Tars Tarkas. There's just something joyous in Carter's defiance of gravity. It buys Carter some time.The film's neat retro sci-fi vibe surfaces early on when the narrative introduces the war between the invading forces of the Zodanga empire and the beleaguered city of Helium, touted as the last bastion of a free Barsoom. I soaked in the wonderful set designs and those wicked cool airships. And, somewhere hereabouts, we meet Dejah Thoris. Wonderfully portrayed by Lynn Collins, Dejah Thoris is presented as a fierce warrior-scientist of Helium, as well as its beloved princess. Except that, rather than wed Sab Than (Dominic West), leader of the encroaching Zodanga army, Dejah Thoris runs away.I guess I could roll with the changes the filmmakers made. It's not astral projection but, rather, an ornament of either magical nature or super-science which hurls Carter to Barsoom. Matai Shang (Mark Strong), who doesn't appear until THE GODS OF MARS, does have presence as the overarcing big bad. The film makes him and his fellow Therns more as immortal, shape-shifting interplanetary manipulators than Barsoom's more localized secret rulers. It'll take more than fancy jumping to foil Matai Shang's machinations. It'll probably take a trilogy of movies.My friend, who hadn't ever read ERB, thought the film just so-so. He remarked that it was full of plot cliches culled from other movies like STAR WARS and AVATAR and such. I had to smack him upside the head and tell him that A PRINCESS OF MARS came out way before those movies. To me, JOHN CARTER is a welcome throwback, a good old-fashioned pulp adventure featuring a hero who, for a change, isn't dark or gritty or cynical (okay, Carter starts out a bit cynical). While Taylor Kitsch doesn't quite capture John Carter's gravitas and inherent nobility, he's sold me with what he brings to the table, a terrific physicality and just enough dramatic weight. Lynn Collins, to me, is more of a revelation. I love her interpretation of Dejah Thoris, the resolve she infuses in her role. I love her looks which are exotic enough that I believed she was an otherworldy princess. That Collins is a black belt in Shito-ryu karate makes her that much hotter. That right there should make her a match for a fighting Virginian battling his way across the breadth of the red planet.

Yes they did change elements of the story but not to the point where they have harmed the original in any way that matters. In fact they may very well have improved on it.

1468016,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,B005LAIH2W,H. Snyder,"[3, 3]","Edgar Rice Burroughs, best known for his Tarzan books, produced one of the early science fiction series in his stories of Civil War veteran John Carter's adventures on Mars. Those familiar with Burroughs' original stories will get an extra kick out of this movie, which brings to life fairly faithfully the Tharks, nine-foot-tall warriors with four arms who find themselves caught in the middle of a perpetual war between the city-states of Zodanga and Helium; the human-like residents of those cities; and the variety of exotic creatures that provide transport, entertainment in the combat arena, and even companionship.Burroughs' tales were cutting-edge science fiction nearly a hundred years ago, based on a Mars craze ignited by wealthy amateur astronomer Percival Lowell and his vision of a canal-crossed Martian landscape which he convinced himself he could see through his telescope in Flagstaff, Arizona, a telescope which he had custom built for his purpose of studying Mars.  Although somewhat quaint by today's standards, Burroughs' luridly illustrated stories were influential for many years in stimulating the imaginations of youthful readers.  Among them was a Brooklyn boy who stood in a vacant lot staring at what he thought was Mars, fervently wishing to be transported telepathically to ""Barsoom"", Burroughs' name for the Red Planet.  This young boy was Carl Sagan, who grew up to be a famous astronomer, and a master of popularizing astronomy for the masses.Attempts at putting Barsoom on film had always foundered due to the impossibility of adequately depicting the characters and the physical environment of the Mars stories. Now, with CG animation and Blu-ray high definition anything is possible, and Disney has done a great job of creating a realistic environment for Burroughs' vision of Mars.

True, Disney did a terrible job at promoting it, but all I heard about John Carter was negative, that it was a big flop, a joke.  Not so!  This film will live on as a science fiction cult classic in my opinion, a nice shelf-worthy DVD for any true Sci-Fi collector.But you have to put this picture in its proper historical context and understand that these stories were primarily intended for young people, not adults. Most of these so-called ""reviewers"" failed to understand that, they reviewed this thing as if it were just another big-budget sci-fi extravaganza like Star Trek or Star Wars when, in fact, it was closer to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.Awesome CGI, lots of action. Scripting seemed awkward at times but they probably were trying to stay true to the original text of the book. The beginning was rushed a bit and you have to pay close attention to the narration to understand the set-up.Hard-to-read subtitles were used in early scenes with Martian creatures called Tharks. Thankfully, Carter drinks some kind of elixir that allows him to understand their language and the awkward subtitles were no longer needed.The movie is based on a good example of early pre-1930's classic science fiction.  I know many reviewers balked at the some of the silly contrivances and gadgets shown in the movie, but it was true to much of science as it was known in Edgar Rice Burrough's  time (early 1900's); imagine how dumb Star Trek or Stargate Atlantis will look 100 yrs. from now.Another point: Many of Burrough's stories were targeted towards older children and young adults; science fiction and fantasy were not considered ""proper"" literature in those days, but was enjoyed by millions of bored kids as good escapist summer-time reading; there was no TV in those days, radio was still in its infancy as was the motion picture industry.  Reading and stage theater were about the only forms of popular entertainment available.Never the less, I think it would have been better to retell this story in a more modern setting.  Instead of Mars, pick one of the recently-discovered planets in a another solar system; update some of the technological references and replace the hokey teleportation amulet with something more in-keeping with known physics. You can do all this an still be faithful to the original story just as we are still faithful to Shakespeare via some 250 modern films based on his plays (like West Side Story or Forbidden Planet).",5,Sci-Fi Cult Classic,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,2517,"['Why', 'did', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'media', 'try', 'sink', 'picture', 'True', 'Disney', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'promoting', 'heard', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'negative', 'was', 'big', 'flop', 'joke', 'Not', 'so', 'film', 'will', 'live', 'science', 'fiction', 'cult', 'classic', 'opinion', 'nice', 'shelf-worthy', 'DVD', 'true', 'Sci-Fi', 'collector.But', 'have', 'put', 'picture', 'proper', 'historical', 'context', 'understand', 'stories', 'were', 'primarily', 'intended', 'young', 'people', 'not', 'adults', 'Most', 'so-called', 'reviewers', 'failed', 'understand', 'reviewed', 'thing', 'were', 'just', 'big-budget', 'sci-fi', 'extravaganza', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'closer', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings.Awesome', 'CGI', 'lots', 'action', 'Scripting', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'times', 'probably', 'were', 'trying', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'text', 'book', 'beginning', 'was', 'rushed', 'bit', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'narration', 'understand', 'set-up.Hard-to-read', 'subtitles', 'were', 'used', 'early', 'scenes', 'Martian', 'creatures', 'called', 'Tharks', 'Thankfully', 'Carter', 'kind', 'elixir', 'understand', 'language', 'awkward', 'subtitles', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'needed.The', 'movie', 'based', 'good', 'example', 'early', 'pre-1930', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'know', 'many', 'reviewers', 'balked', 'silly', 'contrivances', 'gadgets', 'shown', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'much', 'science', 'was', 'known', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burrough', 'time', 'early', '1900', 'imagine', 'how', 'dumb', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'will', 'look', '100', 'yrs', 'now.Another', 'point', 'Many', 'Burrough', 'stories', 'were', 'targeted', 'towards', 'older', 'children', 'young', 'adults', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'proper', 'literature', 'days', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'millions', 'bored', 'kids', 'good', 'escapist', 'summer-time', 'reading', 'was', 'TV', 'days', 'radio', 'was', 'still', 'infancy', 'was', 'motion', 'picture', 'industry', 'Reading', 'stage', 'theater', 'were', 'only', 'forms', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'less', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'retell', 'story', 'more', 'modern', 'setting', 'Instead', 'Mars', 'pick', 'one', 'recently-discovered', 'planets', 'solar', 'system', 'update', 'technological', 'references', 'replace', 'hokey', 'teleportation', 'amulet', 'something', 'more', 'in-keeping', 'known', 'physics', 'can', 'do', 'still', 'be', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'just', 'are', 'still', 'faithful', 'Shakespeare', '250', 'modern', 'films', 'based', 'plays', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Forbidden', 'Planet']",N/A

1468030,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAIH2W,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 7]","It might surprise many people to find that many of our most revered adventure films hearken back to the era of the pulps for inspiration; the most glaring (and possibly best) example of that of course being the INDIANA JONES films. But there's also some brand-recognition that's at work at times to, more specifically with the recent (and amazingly awful) reboot of CONAN THE BARBARIAN. When director Andrew Stanton, director of two of the most beloved films in recent years (the beautiful FINDING NEMO and the Kubrick-with-a-heart genius of WALL-E, which I consider to be the best animated film ever made), decided to make his first jump into live-action films, he also looked back to the pulps. In this instance, he looked to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, and less-famously, the tale of a Confederate Civil War soldier thrust onto the Red Planet as originally told in the book ""The Princess of Mars"". While the film itself surrounds the adventures of the titular character, the real star of JOHN CARTER is Stanton and the deftness and joy that he tells this tale which, aside from a few missteps and some less-than-stellar characterization, is a rousing pulp sci-fi adventure extravaganza with some of the most eye-poppingly amazing visuals of a film since AVATAR.This film has a cast that is to die for... aside from its star. You have Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris (The princess of the tale whose only other real claim to film is X-MEN ORIGINS: WOVERINE as Silverfox) who plays her as an intelligent, quirky, beautiful and deadly woman; Ciaran Hinds, James Purefoy and the voice of Polly Walker who all are there to bring the same charm or gravity that they brought to their respective characters in HBO's brilliant series ROME; Dominic West (best known from THE WIRE) as Sab Than, the would-be puppet tyrant of Barsoom; Mark Strong (the British heavy in just about every film from SHERLOCK HOLMES to GREEN LANTERN) as Matai Shang, the immortal who looks to control the fate of Barsoom; Bryan Cranston in an unrecognizable but important role; and the voice talents of Willem Dafoe (who also worked with Stanton on FINDING NEMO) as Tars Tarkas, Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) as Sola, and Thomas Haden Church as Tal Hajus.Taylor Kitsch as Carter lacks a certain consistency in his characterization. He has charm and is ruggedly handsome, but he lacks the leading-man charisma a role like this requires. The writing by Stanton, Michael Chabon, and Mark Andrews, who have a number of characters to deal with, a great deal of plot and exposition and to combine all of this with some bravura action set-pieces hurts the film somewhat in terms of characterization and may seem like a waste of talent in some cases, but each actor has their moment to shine, no matter the size of the part. The real winner, cast-wise, is Collins, who is so strong in her performance that I want to see her in more roles, and would love to see a film based just around her character. But the film is strong enough on its other merits to maintain great interest in the characters and the story to see it all the way through and still have a terrific time.The biggest winner here is sadly the biggest loser of everyone involved here, and that is Andrew Stanton. He directs the film with an eye for spectacle, precision of detail, and most appropriately, a strong sense of fun; the best example of this is the scene in which Carter leaps from ship to ship eventually meeting and fighting alongside Dejah. It's an incredible moment in the film because of just how well each moment is orchestrated. He tells the story of the film with a visual assuredness that rivals that of more experienced live-action filmmakers, and the filmmakers assembled a fantasic crew of digital and practical effects artists so that the interaction between the human/humanoid actors and the CG characters is totally seamless. Unfortunately, the film was something of a colossal bust at the box office due to exceedingly luke-warm reviews, an epically poor marketing campaign, and the natural comparisons between this film and AVATAR. I would watch this film a hundred more times before I would ever even think of watching AVATAR again, but it's a comparison worth making. So because of all this, the ""failure"" of this film to reach the heights it was intended to hit is all on Stanton's shoulders, which may hurt his ability to continue making live-action films.

1468032,A11EJ3XB3DE5DL,B005LAIH2W,James M. Ward,"[2, 2]","This movie about John Carter, a character from the 1912 novel, A Princess of Mars, is thoroughly satisfying in every way. The idea of entanglement, a single body occupying different spaces simultaneously (in this case, planets) goes far beyond Star Trek's warp drive or transporter to imagine a travel that was much more revolutionary. Even Schroedinger, who refined the concept of entanglement (Verschraenkung), did not articulate his theories until 1935. The novel tells the tale of Dejah Thoris, brilliant and beautiful Princess of Helium, a city on Mars (aka Barsoom). She is rescued by John Carter, a Civil War hero adventurer transported to Mars unwittingly to eventually change everyone's destiny. Lavishly produced and beautifully acted, the movie will go down in history as Disney's finest achievement and best-loved movie. It might take some time, however, to erase initial  box office disappointment. It barely broke even on a huge budget. But, like the Wizard of Oz, will endure to become one of America's most popular features. The characters are well developed and interesting. Some of the performances are first rate, including those of Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Lynn Collins and Taylor Kitsch. The warm, three dimensional personalities they create are as resonant and endearing as anything in Twain. That's not something one can say about many science fiction movies. Certainly, Mark Strong's, Matai Shang, will not be exceeded for intelligent villainy or jaded intensity any time soon. You know a performance is great when it seems the actor was also the writer. I encourage anyone to buy the film in Blue Ray to savor the mesmerizing visuals in all their glorious detail. When it comes down to choosing one dream world over another, my vote goes to the movie that features its heroes and heroines ""sailing on light"" in exquisite, dragonfly-like airships.",5,"Burroughs, father of Tarzan, imagines quantum entanglement on Mars 22 years before anyone else",1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,1877,"['movie', 'John', 'Carter', 'character', '1912', 'novel', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'way', 'idea', 'entanglement', 'single', 'body', 'occupying', 'different', 'spaces', 'simultaneously', 'case', 'planets', 'far', 'Star', 'Trek', 'warp', 'drive', 'transporter', 'imagine', 'travel', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'revolutionary', 'Even', 'Schroedinger', 'who', 'refined', 'concept', 'entanglement', 'Verschraenkung', 'did', 'not', 'articulate', 'theories', '1935', 'novel', 'tale', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'Princess', 'Helium', 'city', 'Mars', 'aka', 'Barsoom', 'rescued', 'John', 'Carter', 'Civil', 'War', 'hero', 'adventurer', 'transported', 'Mars', 'unwittingly', 'eventually', 'change', 'everyone', 'destiny', 'Lavishly', 'produced', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'Disney', 'finest', 'achievement', 'best-loved', 'movie', 'might', 'take', 'time', 'however', 'erase', 'initial', 'box', 'office', 'disappointment', 'barely', 'broke', 'even', 'huge', 'budget', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'will', 'endure', 'become', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'popular', 'features', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'interesting', 'performances', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'including', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'warm', 'three', 'dimensional', 'personalities', 'create', 'are', 'resonant', 'endearing', 'anything', 'Twain', 'not', 'something', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'many', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'Certainly', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Matai', 'Shang', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'exceeded', 'intelligent', 'villainy', 'jaded', 'intensity', 'time', 'soon', 'know', 'performance', 'great', 'when', 'actor', 'was', 'also', 'writer', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'buy', 'film', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'savor', 'mesmerizing', 'visuals', 'glorious', 'detail', 'When', 'down', 'choosing', 'one', 'dream', 'world', 'vote', 'movie', 'heroes', 'heroines', 'sailing', 'light', 'exquisite', 'dragonfly-like', 'airships']",N/A

1468035,AQNYGIYW2W6O,B005LAIH2W,jarredbyitall,"[13, 16]","If you didn't get a chance to see John Carter in theaters you really really missed out.  I've been there.  I used to listen to critics and I missed out on some great times at the movies.  I hope after you finally get around to seeing JOHN CARTER and you LOVE it, you'll regret listening to those critics and internet trolls and NEVER EVER do so again.  Why would anyone listen to those who decided, like a mob, to gang up on this great film, or those you who made snap judgments based on trailers only, only to bully it from obtaining box office glory - glory which it deserved like no other action-adventure film in recent history? (Overseas audiences apparently still think for themselves).If you're one of those folks who listened to the critics pile on this great film, and decided to stay away, now is your chance to right that wrong. Buy the Blu-Ray/DVD! I hope after you see JOHN CARTER, and this great FILM sinks into your being, you spread the word and that like wildfire, JOHN CARTER gets the respect and attention it so rightly deserves. It's already destined for CULT status, that much is guaranteed. (Hello Blade Runner!) I just hope it gathers enough of a cult following to generate a sequel - the other books in the series it's based on deserve to be put on screen.  Us fans need to get really loud and be heard.  I hope if you are a fan of adventure films, you give JOHN CARTER a try.You may be thinking, oh I've seen this story before.  But you haven't.  This film is epic and tragic and wonderful and happy and funny and though-provoking.  Bottom-line: it makes you feel like the child you were when you first started liking these types of films - films about adventure and a hero's journey. Up until now, you've only seen the version stolen by others (no disrespect meant - I love most of these films).  But this is the great, great, great grand-daddy of all science-fiction/fantasy action-adventure films.  This is it - the source.  There's something refreshing about seeing that finally put on film. Only took 100 years!It is not a CG-laden crapfest that so much big budget sci-fi has become. (Hello Transformers and Star Wars Prequels I'm looking at you!).  The action is focused.  The backgrounds are real and/or look real - not a scene in it looks like bad green screen work.  The characters have real emotions and motivations. The villains are evil and the heroes are good old-fashioned heroes - not cynical whiny jerks. Taylor Kitsch brings a lot to the title role. He's a reluctant hero and you really feel for when you finally grasp why he's so reluctant.  Lynn Collins transforms herself into a Princess that could show Leia more than a thing or to.  She's that type of character you so rarely see - strong, sexy and smart. Not helpless.  Not a bimbo.  Not a vacant-eyed supermodel.  Mark Strong and Dominic West make for a great set of villains. And the CG characters in this are AMAZING!  They don't come across as animated, they come across as real characters.  I can guarantee you that TARS TARKAS, SOLA, and WOOLA will stick in your memory as fully-formed Martian creatures who just happened to be caught on film.The story of John Carter has been ripped off by countless science-fiction films from Lucas of Cameron.  And the damn shame is, our culture is so uneducated, that the media and masses saw the trailers for John Carter and immediately thought they were just seeing a STAR WARS or AVATAR clone. How ironic is that? Edgar Rice Burroughs CREATED the genre of science-fiction-fantasy in 1912 with his novel A Princess of Mars, upon which JOHN CARTER is based. Yes, I said 1912.  100 years ago - imagine that. He created the names SITH, JEDDAK and BANTHS (Sound familiar Star Wars fans?).  George Lucas tells the story of how he couldn't get the rights to make Flash Gordon, which itself was inspired by Burroughs' Mars books, yet doesn't credit Burroughs for the names and ideas he outright stole.  So, if the arena scene in the trailer looks it's from Attack of the Clones, that's because Lucas stole the idea from Burroughs books in the first place! (Gladiator-style battle between man and beast, with a crowd of alien onlookers, check!  Burroughs was there first buddy-boy.)The media and internet trolls treat the films that stole ideas from JOHN CARTER like they are the originators of the tales and JOHN CARTER is treated like some also-ran. They just don't get it.  That needs to be corrected.  See this film and judge for yourself.I sincerely hope that you see JOHN CARTER and fall in love with the story, the characters, the score and want to go back.  I hope you are mad that you were tricked out of seeing this cornerstone to science-fiction/fantasy by all the negative reviews and bad publicity surrounding it's release. I hope you DEMAND a sequel and call Disney out not doing their part to properly market and promote of this amazing action/adventure/science-fiction/fantasy/romance.  This should have been a summer movie release. Don't get me started on how mad I am at Disney right now.  The only way they can correct it is to greenlight a sequel.  And the only way that's going to happen is for you to buy this DVD/BLU-RAY and spread the word.If you get time, check out the facebook group ""Take me Back to Barsoom!  I want a John Carter Sequel!""  Thousands of fans have already started to rally around the idea of a sequel. If DVD sales are strong enough, maybe it will happen.  I guarantee when you watch the end of this film, you'll want to go back to Mars (Barsoom) ASAP and be VERY VERY curious to see where the story goes next. Book two is amazing. I want to see it on film.(Please note - I am a huge fan of all science fiction fantasy action adventure films. I love Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, StarGate, Avatar, Blade Runner, Alien, The Thing, Conan the Barbarian.  The list is endless.  But my love for all things sci-fi-fantasy began with exposure to ERB's Barsoom (Mars) series of books.  JOHN CARTER is the foundation for all of this love. It may be old school, but as a fan, old school is where it's at. Pulp fiction is where it began. I hope fans of comic books realize this as well and check out John Carter.  In many ways it's like a superhero film - John Carter gains the powers that the early Superman had - super strength and super jumps!Explore the roots of this whole crazy fandom by checking out JOHN CARTER.  Leave your preconceived notions at the door.  Honor its legacy by making this - the original - your own.",5,A must buy! I can't say enough about this great film!

I can't say it's the best sci-fi I've ever seen but it is memorable.The basic story, without spoilers, is about a postwar Confederate soldier, named John Carter, who ends up on Mars by accident. He soon finds himself in the middle of a new civil war between the three peoples who inhabit the planet. For his part, John must decide what his place is in this new world.The best part of the film are the visual effects. They've done a really good job of world building the cinematography is high quality. They went for a steampunk look and feel (high tech/low tech) and for the most part it works. Also, the action wasn't overblown as is the case in a lot of the current movies.Disney did a good job of creating likeable characters and there are plenty of comical moments along the way. For the most part the storyline keeps you interested and in that sense the movie succeeds.So where does John Carter go wrong--and why do I only give it three stars? Two reasons, both of which are tied to the screenplay itself. The scenes can be very choppy at times. It really feels like the problem may be do to a screenplay that was rewritten one too many times leaving the story disjointed.Another big problem for me was all the characters and scenes that too closely resembled other movies--I kept getting flashes of Jar Jar Binks, Jabba the Hut and that blue-man scene from Braveheart. It was very distracting because it was so hard not to notice.Even so, it's still worth watching. Yes, it can be corny and a little recycled at times but its still fun. It was certainly worth the dollar blueray rental.

Edgar had no good way to tell us HOW John Carter made his journeys to and from Mars or any reason why he would suddenly make the journey (in the books).  So we are given more of a realistic foundation for this.  The film maker was influenced by the John Carter comic books.  That's likely where the swagger injection comes from as that tends to be the case in comic books.  Over all though it was well done and it was great to FINALLY see this concept on the big screen.

Meade,"[0, 1]","I never read the original books the movie was based off of, but when I rented the movie I was very much aware of the negative press that came from this so I was not sure what to expect. I wouldn't say I was pleasantly surprised with the movie, but it is definitely better than its been given credit for by mainstream media and critics. The overall story is decent, the acting is ok, and I never found myself bored at any point in the movie. What I watched didn't look like a $250 million dollar movie though, especially when compared to a movie like Avatar, that didn't even cost as much.A couple of things really hurt this movie. The first is the name. I cant understand how Disney could allow such a horrible name for a $250 million dollar movie. The name John Carter does not make people interested and was never going to get anyone to spend money at the theater. This is just stupidly obvious. I'm pretty certain that if the movie had been called Princess of Mars it would have made millions more just from that since the focus would be more on the beautiful princess than on Taylor Kitsch. The smaller issue for me is the setting. When the books were written our knowledge of astronomy was much less than it is now, so I found myself uninterested in going to the theater to watch a movie about all this life and fighting on Mars, when that's not even remotely possible. Avatar was based on a fake world so you could more easily connect to the story than John Carter, when its based on the planet next to us that we know is cold, barely has an atmosphere, and has no intelligent life.Once the movie was available to rent from home I was interested because I enjoy sci-fi, and it was definitely worth renting, but the horrible marketing for this movie really hurt it, and for some of us the unrealistic setting also detracted from the movie. It was nice in 1917 when the book was written, but just doesn't work as well in 2012. Its too bad because I think Andrew Stanton did a decent job making the movie, but I highly doubt we will ever see the sequels.John Carter is not really worth the $10+ to see in a theater, but it is worth the $3-4 to rent on a evening when you just want some decent entertainment.",4,Worth Watching,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,2210,"['never', 'read', 'original', 'books', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'when', 'rented', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'negative', 'press', 'came', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'definitely', 'better', 'been', 'given', 'credit', 'mainstream', 'media', 'critics', 'overall', 'story', 'decent', 'acting', 'ok', 'never', 'found', 'bored', 'point', 'movie', 'What', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', '250', 'million', 'dollar', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'movie', 'Avatar', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'cost', 'much.A', 'couple', 'things', 'really', 'hurt', 'movie', 'first', 'name', 'cant', 'understand', 'how', 'Disney', 'could', 'allow', 'horrible', 'name', '250', 'million', 'dollar', 'movie', 'name', 'John', 'Carter', 'not', 'make', 'people', 'interested', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'anyone', 'spend', 'money', 'theater', 'just', 'stupidly', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'certain', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'called', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'millions', 'more', 'just', 'focus', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'smaller', 'issue', 'setting', 'When', 'books', 'were', 'written', 'knowledge', 'astronomy', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'now', 'found', 'uninterested', 'going', 'theater', 'watch', 'movie', 'life', 'fighting', 'Mars', 'when', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'possible', 'Avatar', 'was', 'based', 'fake', 'world', 'could', 'more', 'easily', 'connect', 'story', 'John', 'Carter', 'when', 'based', 'planet', 'know', 'cold', 'barely', 'atmosphere', 'intelligent', 'life.Once', 'movie', 'was', 'available', 'rent', 'home', 'was', 'interested', 'enjoy', 'sci-fi', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'renting', 'horrible', 'marketing', 'movie', 'really', 'hurt', 'unrealistic', 'setting', 'also', 'detracted', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', '1917', 'when', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', '2012', 'too', 'bad', 'think', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'highly', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'sequels.John', 'Carter', 'not', 'really', '10+', 'see', 'theater', '3-4', 'rent', 'evening', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'decent', 'entertainment']",N/A

On Amazon, the customer reviews indicate a hit movie, with revenues dozens of times the budget.  But it lasted only two weeks in theaters, and I can see why.Edgar Rice Burroughs was a hack, but like Louis Lamour, he was a hack with vision, and a decent writer as well.  His dialog was a little stilted, but his vision was well above average, and his storytelling ability -- spellbinding.  But this movie has nothing in common with the ""Martian Books"" other than the names of the characters and locations.Plotwise, the movie seems confused, erratic, even drugged.  The dialog is base and pretentious, among the worst of any large-budget film I've seen.  And the vision is strained and trite.  It would have been a thousand times better if Disney and company had simply taken the plot, vision, and dialog straight from the books, simply editing out whatever was burdensome (and there is a bit of that).  But making up everything from scratch?  Why even bother to use the names from the Burroughs books?The Peter Jackson ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, with its inept dialog and mediocre attempts to fill in gaps in the books with meaningless action and supposition, was saved by superb acting (I wonder if his version of ""The Hobbit"" will be so lucky) and some wonderful settings.  But ""John Carter"" has none of that.  The acting is as unpalatable as the dialog the actors are faced with, and the settings are pure CGI.The plot, however, is the real nemisis of this piece of spoiled celluloid.  It's hard to tell where it is coming from at any given moment.  This is the lesson I hope Jackson has learned:  Stick to the original; there is a reason why it is so famous and beloved.  Somehow, ""John Carter"" seems like a haphazard attempt to combine disparate elements from the first three books, simply rushing along on a path to failure.  I heard that Disney intended this to kick-start a franchise.  Then why not let it play out as the original stories did?  They became a successful franchise.  ""A Princess of Mars"", a complete story unto itself, would have been a thousand times better.  After making up a new story and character for the first thirty minutes, the writers and director try to cram way too much into the remaining time.Last, but not least:  Characterization in this is so dull.  The obligatory ""woman with a sword"" (again, see Peter Jackson's LOTR, in which any woman can get the drop on Aragorn -- why didn't Sauron just send a half-naked babe with a blade after his mortal enemy?) replaces the Burroughs-era obligatory ""damsel-in-distress"", without adding anything of value to the story.  John Carter, instead of being the honorable ""southern gentleman"" becomes the ""rebellious adult-delinquent"".  And the extra weight of cramming too much plot and weird magic (nowhere in the books is there any magical device, nor a Thern on earth) simply takes away from the novels' delightfully slow revelation of character of the green and red men and women of Barsoom, and their culture (like when John Carter first calls Dejah Thoris ""my princess"", ignorant of the impact of those words between a red man and woman, or the significance of her calling him ""my chieftain"").  This flick is all black-and-white characters, none of which have any motivation, depth, or subtlety, led by  the protagonist constantly whining about wanting his ""cave of gold"".These reflections concern only the first hour of the movie, as I have no intention of watching the rest.  This may be the worst money I've spent since the ""Kill Bill"" dvds went on sale for $5 apiece.

It looked retarded. I finally rented it just out of curiosity and was completely blown away. The acting was top notch, the special effects were amazing, and the story was fantastic. It immediately made me want to watch a sequel, so I went online only to find that Disney botched the marketing so badly that they actually scrapped plans for a sequel because it didn't make enough money! Of course it didn't make money, they made it look ridiculous in everything they said about it. It's a serious sci-fi movie that they marketed as some kind of kids show. The only reason it got a pg-13 rating is because all the people on Mars bled blue blood when they were eviscerated and hacked to pieces. If it had been red this would have had a hard R rating. It was extremely violent and had many adult themes that would not only not appeal to kids, but it would piss off any parents who took thier kids to see it.

I was turned off by the Conan the Barbarian outfits and the seemingly cheesy CGI work that I saw in the trailers.  However, after watching the film on Amazon Instant Video (admittedly, I still went the cheap, non-HD route), I walked away quite impressed with the movie.In short, as many reviews have noted, many of the themes in JC are familiar.  In fact, folks like George Lucas clearly lifted many of their themes and action pieces from John Carter, if the movie is in fact representative of the book. (Which I intend to read at some point on my Kindle.) Unlike George's underwhelming prequels, though, the film had very entertaining characters, an extremely strong and well-motivated female lead, and even children's elements (the dog-alien) that didn't insult the viewer with lowbrow humor.  In short, this is the movie that The Phantom Menace should have been.  In a fair world, JC would have made the $700M that TPM did, while TMP languished.  Sadly, that was not to be.In the end, I have the feeling I'll pick up the Blu-ray in the near future.  It's a film with great action, pretty doggone good CG effects (the Tharks and the dog-alien are very enjoyable, even if they're not 100% believable), and an excellent score.  I dropped the film by one star mainly because I felt that Taylor Kitsch lacks the charisma to be a leading actor and he pulls the movie down when it should have soared.

I am a huge fan of Burroughs in general and the Mars series in particular having first read ""A Princess of Mars"" over 40 years ago. Here are some impressions from that perspective that I came away with:1. Plot changes. They were certainly necessary as ""Princess"" ended on a cliffhanger. More importantly, ""Princess"" was a book with a lot of exposition which can work well enough in a book but is undesirable for a film. Films need a faster pace than a book.2. The Therns. The Therns are certainly much more powerful in the film as compared to the book(s). On the plus side they do provide a convenient explanation for how Carter gets to Mars. This was badly needed as Burroughs was very vague about this. On the debit side they are too powerful and make Carter too much of the pawn and not enough of the all conquering hero that Burroughs created.3. Dejah Thoris. Lynn Collins *is* Dejah Thoris, exactly as a dozen paperback cover artists have depicted her over the decades. Perfect casting. Her character has been updated in two ways to bring her more in line with 21st century sensibilities. First, she is as much a swordsman as Carter whereas in the books her weapon of choice was a dagger used to defend her honor against various miscreants. Second, she is depicted as a scientist here, a role her son played in the novels. Both changes were quite acceptable.4. Jumping ability. Hugely exaggerated over what Burroughs established in the novels. Not sure this was necessary but perhaps the producers were influenced by the success of the many superhero films of late.5. Barsoom. Perfectly depicted. Excellent use of CGI throughout. Quite impressed with the amount of Barsoomian visuals the producers were able to work in. It really had the correct ""feel"".6. The story. Very impressed with the amount of ""Princess"" that made it into the film. The entire framing sequence was retained. The 19th century setting was retained. The whole Thark/Tars Tarkas/Sola/Woola plot points survived.The ""sword and planet"" genre has been out of fashion for a long time now. It has always been something of a male juvenile genre which one had to be exposed to before age 15 to appreciate. The audience for this film probably died out long before the technology was available to bring to the screen.

You also have Mark Strong (Sherlock Holmes) good as always in a villain role of course as a shapeshifting alien and Lynn Collins as one of the sexiest Princesses on film in awhile and she of course is Carter's love interest. Oh and I want Carter's loyal alien dog that follows him everywhere.John Carter is one to be open minded about and to form your own opinion with. The film had bad marketing and wasn't even advertised as being based on a book which sometimes helps. It also was in the top 10 at the box office for a couple of weeks but was constantly picked on due to how much it cost.

Suddenly he is attacked from behind by a strange looking man with an advanced weapon and he is forced to fight.  He kills the man and picks up a glowing medallion and is instantaneously transferred to Mars....This is a Disney Sci-Fi movie and I thought it was excellent.

1468072,A3GG7QSSI58HJV,B005LAIH2W,J. Lail,"[8, 10]","John CarterA couple of years ago, Asylum put together ""A Princess of Mars"" in just a couple of weeks. It was one of the most bastardized movies I have ever seen. The only good thing in it was Tracy Lord's body, which is still nice after all these years.Now, Disney has sunk a couple hundred million dollars in ""John Carter"" in another retelling of Edgar Rice Burroughs ""Martian"" books.I will have to say that I went to see this film with reservations. I have seen several scenes on YouTube, and they didn't look to be anything like the books that I have grown to love over 45 years. I started reading them when I was around 12 years old, so I am pretty well acquainted with the characters.That said, a friend and I went to the theater tonight and saw the film in a completely refurbished theater with new rocking chair seats. The cost of admission? $2.50.As I expected, many aspects of the film did not go along with the books. Some things were a bit outrageous when compared to print, but the movie as a whole was plain out good. I think that if I had never read the books, I might have liked it more. But on a scale of 1-100, I would still give it a 95. :DThe lead characters are Taylor Kitch as John Carter, and Lynn Collins as Dajah Thoris.A few inconsistencies (not all listed) between the movie and the books are:1 - Tars Tarkas was not the Jeddak when he found John Carter (The Jeddak was Tal Hajus).2 - Woola could not run as fast as the movie makes out. He could apparently put a Greyhound to shame, but he couldn't run like a shot out of a cannon as on the movie.3 - The Holy Therns could not just materialize anywhere on the planet. They also wore blonde wigs.4 - The weapon that the Holy Therns used in the move came on quite a bit later in the series and was developed not by the Therns, but by a crazy Jeddak who was out to conquer the world.5 - Matai Shang was a ""Holy Thern"" and dedicated his dirty deeds to ""Lessor Therns"". He would not have dirtied his hands with the things that the movie character did. He also had a beautiful daughter who was nowhere to be seen in the movie.6 - The movie intimated that the Therns were aliens to Mars. This was definately not the way it is told in the books. They fooled the planet into thinking they were ""Holy"" and doing the work if ""Issus"". They were definitely not Holy, and Issus turned out to be a several hundred year old crazy woman who dined on the ""delicate"" parts of the most beautiful women on the planet that happened to be taken hostage by the Black Pirates of Barsoom (who themselves made raids on the Therns).7 - Dajah Thoris was not a warrior, and neither was she a great scholar. She was a smart, pretty, and determined little princess who could wield a sword if she had too, and that was about it.8 - John Carter could jump at most around 150 feet. Most of the time it was more like 10-50 feet. The movie has him jumping a thousand feet or more.9 - Tardas Mors (her grand-father in the books)would never have made Dajah, marry ""Sab Than"", no matter what the cost to the city of Helium. There is no mention of Mors Kajak (her father in the books) at all.10 - Powell and Carter were mining partners in the books.11 - Sab Than was not a Jeddak and the city of Zodanga didn't move around on a giant machine. This was just stupid.Even with the inconsistencies, the movie was a good one to watch. I don't quite understand why it didn't do well in theaters. This is a shame too as there should be two more films to complete the original trilogy. But Stanton's incompetency has probably doomed any further movies in the series.All in all, I would say that this movie was really good. I will definitely see it again........and again. :DBut as stated: Andrew Stanton has screwed the characters up so much, and mixed up so many things from all the books, I don't see how it's possible to make another movie.Note: Even if you do NOT like science fiction, or other movies of this type, take notice: If you like seeing good looking women in skimpy costumes, you should see this film. Lynn Collins is absolutely beautiful as Dajah Thoris. I think I fell just a little bit in love tonight. ;DDisney should have had better advertising and not given up so easily on this film.",5,"Too many liberties taken with writing script, but good anyway.",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,4232,"['John', 'CarterA', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Asylum', 'put', 'together', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'just', 'couple', 'weeks', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'bastardized', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'Tracy', 'Lord', 'body', 'still', 'nice', 'years.Now', 'Disney', 'sunk', 'couple', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollars', 'John', 'Carter', 'retelling', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Martian', 'books.I', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'reservations', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'scenes', 'YouTube', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'be', 'anything', 'books', 'have', 'grown', 'love', '45', 'years', 'started', 'reading', 'when', 'was', 'around', '12', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'am', 'pretty', 'well', 'acquainted', 'characters.That', 'said', 'friend', 'went', 'theater', 'tonight', 'saw', 'film', 'completely', 'refurbished', 'theater', 'new', 'rocking', 'chair', 'seats', 'cost', 'admission', '2.50.As', 'expected', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'along', 'books', 'things', 'were', 'bit', 'outrageous', 'when', 'compared', 'print', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'plain', 'out', 'good', 'think', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'scale', '1-100', 'would', 'still', 'give', '95.', 'DThe', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'Taylor', 'Kitch', 'John', 'Carter', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Dajah', 'Thoris.A', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'not', 'listed', 'movie', 'books', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'was', 'not', 'Jeddak', 'when', 'found', 'John', 'Carter', 'Jeddak', 'was', 'Tal', 'Hajus', '.2', 'Woola', 'could', 'not', 'run', 'as', 'fast', 'movie', 'out', 'could', 'apparently', 'put', 'Greyhound', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'run', 'shot', 'cannon', 'movie.3', 'Holy', 'Therns', 'could', 'not', 'just', 'materialize', 'anywhere', 'planet', 'also', 'wore', 'blonde', 'wigs.4', 'weapon', 'Holy', 'Therns', 'used', 'move', 'came', 'quite', 'bit', 'later', 'series', 'was', 'developed', 'not', 'Therns', 'crazy', 'Jeddak', 'who', 'was', 'out', 'conquer', 'world.5', 'Matai', 'Shang', 'was', 'Holy', 'Thern', 'dedicated', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'Lessor', 'Therns', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'dirtied', 'hands', 'things', 'movie', 'character', 'did', 'also', 'had', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'movie.6', 'movie', 'intimated', 'Therns', 'were', 'aliens', 'Mars', 'was', 'definately', 'not', 'way', 'told', 'books', 'fooled', 'planet', 'thinking', 'were', 'Holy', 'doing', 'work', 'Issus', 'were', 'definitely', 'not', 'Holy', 'Issus', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'several', 'hundred', 'year', 'old', 'crazy', 'woman', 'who', 'dined', 'delicate', 'parts', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'planet', 'happened', 'be', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Black', 'Pirates', 'Barsoom', 'who', 'made', 'raids', 'Therns', '.7', 'Dajah', 'Thoris', 'was', 'not', 'warrior', 'was', 'great', 'scholar', 'was', 'smart', 'pretty', 'determined', 'little', 'princess', 'who', 'could', 'wield', 'sword', 'had', 'too', 'was', 'it.8', 'John', 'Carter', 'could', 'jump', 'most', 'around', '150', 'feet', 'Most', 'time', 'was', 'more', '10-50', 'feet', 'movie', 'jumping', 'thousand', 'feet', 'more.9', 'Tardas', 'Mors', 'grand-father', 'books', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'made', 'Dajah', 'marry', 'Sab', 'Than', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'city', 'Helium', 'mention', 'Mors', 'Kajak', 'father', 'books', 'all.10', 'Powell', 'Carter', 'were', 'mining', 'partners', 'books.11', 'Sab', 'Than', 'was', 'not', 'Jeddak', 'city', 'Zodanga', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'around', 'giant', 'machine', 'was', 'just', 'stupid.Even', 'inconsistencies', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'theaters', 'shame', 'too', 'should', 'be', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'complete', 'original', 'trilogy', 'Stanton', 'incompetency', 'probably', 'doomed', 'further', 'movies', 'series.All', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'will', 'definitely', 'see', 'again', '..and', 'again', 'DBut', 'stated', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'screwed', 'characters', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'mixed', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'possible', 'make', 'movie.Note', 'Even', 'do', 'NOT', 'science', 'fiction', 'other', 'movies', 'type', 'take', 'notice', 'seeing', 'good', 'looking', 'women', 'skimpy', 'costumes', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'Dajah', 'Thoris', 'think', 'fell', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'love', 'tonight', 'DDisney', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'advertising', 'not', 'given', 'up', 'so', 'easily', 'film']",N/A

The movie didn't make the best use of Edgar Rice Burroughs's stories or his imaginative writing. Most of the elements were in place, but the acting was marginal, even with Antonio's flexing muscles and sharply sculpted cheekbones, but the princess, played by one-time porn princess, Traci Lords, was lacking in everything, especially emotion and acting ability. There was plenty of skin, though. It was not up to my -- or anyone else's -- expectations.Along comes Taylor Kitsch in his turn as John Carter, a slow talking, brilliant man born out of his time and transported to Mars to a world he doesn't understand with abilities and strengths he didn't know were possible. John Carter definitely made the grade. There were some small bobbles, but this all star cast has done a creditable job with Burroughs's story and with the world of Barsoom he created.The special effects do not intrude but work seamlessly with the live actors and, despite everyone wearing at least some clothing, unlike Burroughs's story where the ""red men"" were naked most of the time, the story has been captured admirably.

This story is very character-driven, the main characters being John Carter, Tars Tarkas and Princess Dejah Thoris.This story deals with John Carter, a disillusioned Civil War veteran who is mysteriously transported to Barsoom (Mars), which is dying and slowly losing its atmosphere and water.  When John arrives on Mars he immediately notices that he has greater strength and can jump huge distances.  The world he has entered is in the middle of a civil war between Helium and Zodang, which is secretly aided by the Therns (White Martians).Every side in this conflict wants John to aid them but he refuses to become part of it until he sees what is happening here and turns the tables on the plotters.

It is a cinematic homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""John Carter of Mars"" series of novels, based primarily on the first,  ""A Princess of Mars"", and one that remains true in spirit to Edgar Rice Burroughs, written by screenwriters, especially noted American fiction writer Michael Chabon, who are long-time admirers of Burroughs' classic space opera science fiction series. Much to its credit, the film is not only true to Burroughs's spirit, but it also remains quite faithful to the original source material itself. Director Andrew Stanton (who co-wrote the screenplay with Chabon and Mark Andrews) has wrought a most compelling film, filled with excellent special effects and great cinematography, but made especially noteworthy with the presence of an excellent cast. Canadian actor Taylor Kitsch is a credible, heroic John Carter, American actress Lynn Collins is a ravishingly beautiful and compelling Princess of Mars Dejah Thoris, and legendary American actor Willem Dafoe is an admirable Tars Tarkas (even if he is kept ""under wraps"" as Carter's faithful Barsoom (Mars) sidekick and friend).  Don't believe any of the negative reviews which ""John Carter"" earned from skeptical film critics. It definitely ranks alongside Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as among the most successful cinematic translations of fantasy and science fiction ever created; a far more enjoyable and memorable film than either the ""Star Wars"" prequels or ""Avatar"".

An entire book has already been written on that subject:John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood, by Michael D. Sellers.  I came to this film with low expectations, having seen and heard all the terrible media coverage.  I've not read any of Burroughs' work, and even if I had, I judge films on their own merits, not on how faithful they are to their source material.""John Carter"" is a good film.Okay, so it's not exactly Oscar-worthy.  But it's fun and entertaining to watch...and I don't say that lightly, because I'm extremely picky about the movies that I like.  This one may not be deserving of any Academy Awards, but it's better than most of what I see coming out of Hollywood lately.  I recommend buying it.Picture quality of this 16x9 widescreen transfer was excellent.  Audio left something to be desired; I found the dialogue a bit too soft.  I was impressed with the music, which was composed by Michael Giacchino; I hope to hear more of his work in the future.  I don't usually take note of title sequences or end credits, but did in this case; they're so well designed that I enjoyed watching them.  Of the lead cast, I thought Lynn Collins (as Dejah Thoris) gave the best performance.  I know that Taylor Kitsch has been criticized, by I didn't see anything wrong with his acting.  Honestly, it would have been difficult for any actor to deliver lines like: ""Tharks did not cause this, but by Issus, Tharks will end it!"", and keep a straight face.  And this is where the movie stumbles a little: story/plot.  Various words and concepts are unexplained, or explained poorly.  If you're not already well versed in ERB's Mars saga, expect to do some rewinding.  Although this is not, strictly speaking, a steampunk film, I think fans of the genre will get a kick out of it.Normally, I find extras boring, but in this case I thought some were good.  Special features are as follows:1. ""Explore John Carter's Journal With Disney Second Screen.""  I can't speak to this, because you have to download a special app.  I didn't want to bother.2. ""100 Years In The Making.""  Brief history of ERB and his work, and how he influenced just about all sci-fi that came after him.  Also, the tribulations of various attempts to bring his Mars saga to screen over the years.  Interesting.3. Deleted Scenes.  Most of these are unremarkable, with two exceptions.  The first is ""Original Opening: Hall of Science."" I think Stanton dropped the ball here.  This would have made a much better opening for the movie.  The second is ""Ned at College.""  This brief scene provides more of a connection between Ned and John, and was well done.  I think it should have been included.  All the scenes have commentary with Andrew Stanton, which I did not listen to.  Maybe he gives valid reasons why they weren't part of the final cut.4. ""360 Degrees of John Carter"" is a ""making of"" special.  To my surprise, I liked it.  They made an effort to include not only principals such as director/lead cast, but extras, make-up artists, costume designers, and even the cooks/craft service people.5. ""Barsoom Bloopers"" is, of course, a blooper reel.  It was funny to watch.6. Audio commentary w/Director Andrew Stanton, and producers Jim Morris and Lindsey Collins.  I don't usually listen to these, but I might listen to this one in the future.  It'll be interesting to hear what they may have said about the film's (mis)marketing and reception at the box office.Bottom line: in my opinion, ""John Carter"" has gotten a bum rap.

I have found critics to be wrong before, and I wanted to make my own assessment.Movies can be really subjective. John Carter just did not work for me. About the only part of John Carter I enjoyed was the interactive between Carter and the Union Colonel who comes to ""draft"" him. Those few scenes were okay.The fight scenes kept making me wonder why? Why if you have high tech weapons and machines do you need to fight with swords? And to me, the romance angle just did not work at all.The natives (tharks? spelling) portrayal seemed to me to be neither realistic, nor comical, and so they came off as too fakey. I kept thinking of JarJar Binks from Star Wars (I found that character annoying) and a cross with muppets.Most of the CGI effects I found seemed to be imitations of other, better done, movies.I think I may have enjoyed it more had there been better development of fewer characters.  It seems I was just getting to following who was what, and then it changed.  New people, or creatures, entered and it was all new again.At first I thought the lower gravity effects were going to be good, but then it seemed like it was inconsistent.

This one boldy marches right up and sits right down beside Star Wars and other like time-tested, sci-fi 'space operas'.  Plus, this one has the added degree of being distilled from one of the earliest sci-fi classics by Burroughs.  As such, it can claim a somewhat unique plot line and scope, which I will not spoil for the potential newcomer.I gave it five stars, which is, in this case, 4.5 stars rounded up.  I would spare it half a star in agreement with some of the other comments about scripting.  It does get somewhat predictable.  Along with that, I found Taylor Kitsch's delivery a little juvenile and overdone.  His cockiness gets a little tiring.  Still, he is a good choice and a new face.Other than that, it really is a visual feast worthy of Lucas, Spielberg, Scott, et al.  The action sequences and CGI are spectacular and, happily, only improve in scale and depth as the film progresses.  Lynn Collins is an excellent choice for Dejah Thoris, and is stunning to behold in this exotic role; her appearances never go unnoticed....I can only echo the other pleas here for Disney to look past the box office performance and let the growing fan following of this film persuade them to continue the franchise.  It would be a great opportunity for Disney to add their own mark to the sci-fi genre, having such a strong and definitive opener with 'John Carter'.  Burroughs wrote plenty more material in this particular universe to be mined - it would be a shame to not see what happens next to John Carter and Dejah Thoris.

1468098,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005LAIH2W,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 9]","John Carter (originally titled John Carter of Mars) is based on the 1917 novel A Princess of Mars by Tarzan-scribe Edgar Rice Burroughs. An adaptation has been trying to get off the ground since 1931. When the film was finally released to theaters in March, financial prospects were already hopeless. John Carter is now infamous for what a huge flop it was for Disney. On a budget of $250 million (not counting marketing), it only grossed only $72 million in America. Despite what a gargantuan flop it was, it still managed to gross $280 million worldwide, while setting box office records in Russia. The novel it's based on was the first in a series of 11 novels, but this is hardly an established property. I think few would argue that the failure of John Carter was a failure of marketing. The ""of Mars"" was dropped from the title. A rumored reason being that Disney didn't want people to draw a correlation between this film and their recent Mars Needs Moms film, which was also a colossal flop. The trailers were too vague, giving no real indication of what the film was about. When will Disney (and other film studios) realize that it's not an established property or trying to get people to disassociate a film from an unrelated film that brings in box office? It's an intriguing trailer and word-of-mouth that will bring financial rewards. John Carter of Mars would not have reminded people of Mars Needs Moms, but the trailer did remind people of Prince of Persia.The financial hit that Disney took for this film has been widely reported, so much that it's overshadowed the film itself. So how is John Carter? Not bad. What immediately separates John Carter from most films like it is that it isn't a sci-fi, action blockbuster. It's an adventure movie a la Indiana Jones...And you don't see too many films like that anymore. It's a much better film than its reputation would lead you to believe.The film opens on Barsoom (the official name of Mars) and gives a bit of back-story, as well as making it clear that the film will be a visual treat. It then jumps back to New York City, 1881 where John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain, dies suddenly. His nephew Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) inherits his estate and his private journal. As he begins reading, the film once again jumps back to 1868. Here, John Carter escapes the grasp of a Union Colonel (Bryan Cranston) and ends up in a cave where a mysterious medallion transports him to Mars. Because of the physical characteristics of Mars and Carter's bone density, he is able to jump to great heights and utilize great strength. He is captured by some Martians called Tharks and soon finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two cities of Barsoom, with a Princess named Dejah (Lynn Collins) caught in the middle.Action, romance, aliens, war, a lot of eye-popping visual effects, and a charismatic lead actor; John Carter has every essential element necessary to appeal to the broadest audience possible. It's clear throughout the film where the $250 million budget went and the film benefits from this price tag in a way investors did not. The sets are grand and, like most of the film, terrific to look at.John Carter has about as much depth as the average film of this sort, but it's a largely superficial film. It doesn't purely rely on special effects and CGI to tell the story, but the story isn't particularly exciting or fresh. Granted, it's based on a story that was written almost 100 years ago but we've seen this template thousands of times in movies. Still, there is a certain amount of originality due to director Andrew Stanton's visual prowess. Stanton previously directed the Pixar films Finding Nemo and Wall*E, so he has an eye for telling a story visually. Even with his ability to stage a visual extravaganza, his visual sense recalls other films...I could never escape the idea that I was watching Indiana Jones thrown into Star Wars on the set of Lawrence of Arabia. Furthermore, despite a script by 3 different people; much of what's good relies on aspects that weren't on paper. The dialogue is heavy-handed and plodding, but it offers no surprises nor is it particularly important.Even with familiar themes, John Carter is entertaining and it's chock-full of fine actors (including Mark Strong, Ciaran Hinds, Willem Dafoe, and Thomas Haden Church to name a few) and the visual effects are particularly impressive. A familiar template for a story, with fine actors and astounding visual effects? That sounds like Avatar. Yeah...And John Carter, while far from perfect, still does nearly everything better than Avatar. The CGI-heavy action sequences are thrilling and consistently appealing on a visual level. A lot of effort was put into these visual effects and they're quite convincing. One battle sequence is intercut with a traumatic event in Carter's past and is both unexpected and effectively executed.Had this been a hit, it would've done been a major success for the charismatic Kitsch. He brings more depth to his performance as Carter than the film requires. He's got a great, commanding speaking voice and is a very talented physical performer as well. His performance, like the film, is pretty serious-minded. That's where comparisons to Indiana Jones end. There's a minimal amount of humor in John Carter, which is particularly surprising when most films of this sort rely on some type of comic relief.CGI aside, this film would feel right at home as a 70s movie. You don't see blockbuster fare like this too often anymore. I didn't love John Carter, but here's a rare example where a sequel may actually be warranted...And could no doubt be better than this first installment. There's a terrific and simple twist ending that actually concludes the film on a nice note and made me a bit disheartened that there would be no sequel. It's a crowd-pleasing film that will likely find an audience on home video. It falls short of being marvelous, but it certainly entertains and that's really all it needs to do.",4,Better Than It's Reputation Suggests,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,6068,"['John', 'Carter',

However, we really got caught up in the story and the great on-screen chemistry between Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins.The real weakness in this movie is the somewhat confusing plot... basically, the celestial ""bad guys"" are feeding off of the destruction of Mars, but Dejah Thoris, princess of Helium, is close to discovering a source of great power that can reverse Mars fortune.  The ""bad guys"" give a powerful weapon to the leader of the enemy of Helium in order to broker a forced marriage and ultimately destroy Dejah as well as Helium removing the threat for good.Sound confusing?

All of the actors did great jobs with their parts. I was especially effected by the beautiful Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris. I found myself thinking, ""all the actors were great in this movie, but how did they get an ACTUAL princess of Mars down here to Earth to star in one of our films? Hah! Anyway, this movie deserved much better success in theaters and to call it a dud just seems like complete nonsense to me.I would say that choosing the name ""John Carter"" instead of ""John Carter of Mars"" was a mistake (though I can think of a couple reasons why they might have done that), and my recollection of the marketing for the film seemed sort of weak or unfocused.

So I grabbed the blu-ray when it was finally available and was surprised at how entertaining John Carter was. So I check good old Rotten Tomatoes, and what?! 52%?! I'd expected 80 at least. So I read the reviews and laughed at how few critics can just relax and enjoy well-made Flash Gordon-style escapism. Then I come here and voila, 4.5 stars. Why is it that the aggregate movie score here is SO often how I too feel about most movies? I guess my tastes are more typical than I'd like to think...John Carter is just fun, and great-looking fun. The leads are both very solid, with decent chemistry (somewhat Han/Leia-ish, but then Lucas took lots from ERB), and fine stage actors like Hinds and Purefoy (see them together in the great Mayor Of Casterbridge if you're a fan of great acting) add an unexpected amount of solidity to a very spacey story.I love Burroughs' style and read most of the Tarzans and his sci-fi as a kid, and I think this film really does him justice. I wasn't surprised to learn it was done by the guy who did Wall-E, the wisest animated film of the last decade. ERB's wild flights of fancy and crazy creatures come to life here, and who could resist a six-legged wildly loyal space-dog?Dafoe is perfect in his semi-animated role and the look of his species and this film in general is absolutely knockout on blu-ray. Incredible colors and detail. Along with the story, the eye candy and visual feel reminded me of so many of the best sci-fi/fantasy flicks, especially Star Wars and the first Indy, no small compliment.And I truly enjoyed Kitsch, who I'd never seen. His name must delight critics looking to be snide, but I found him fun and dead-on, like Buster Crabbe but better. And if you got that reference, dang you're old! If you didn't, go see what great kitsch you've missed. Director Stanton clearly did not, and made a film that's so epic and so fun that I think it will be a true cult classic as time goes by. ""The one that the critics missed out on entirely!""PS The blu-ray is most fine indeed, with not only a perfect transfer but some good extras including a funny making-of that downplays the crazy 250 mil budget, but shows why the money turned into a truly mind-blowing visual experience.It ain't Shakespeare, but it's great Saturday-afternoon pulp sci-fi.",5,The Amazon Decision wins again,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,2386,"['4.5', 'starsI', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'saw', 'always', 'rented', 'local', 'dishbuster', 'grabbed', 'blu-ray', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'available', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'entertaining', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'So', 'check', 'good', 'old', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'what', '52', '%', ""'d"", 'expected', '80', 'least', 'So', 'read', 'reviews', 'laughed', 'how', 'few', 'critics', 'can', 'just', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'well-made', 'Flash', 'Gordon-style', 'escapism', 'Then', 'come', 'here', 'voila', '4.5', 'stars', 'Why', 'aggregate', 'movie', 'score', 'here', 'SO', 'often', 'how', 'too', 'feel', 'most', 'movies', 'guess', 'tastes', 'are', 'more', 'typical', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'John', 'Carter', 'just', 'fun', 'great-looking', 'fun', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'somewhat', 'Han/Leia-ish', 'then', 'Lucas', 'took', 'lots', 'ERB', 'fine', 'stage', 'actors', 'Hinds', 'Purefoy', 'see', 'together', 'great', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', ""'re"", 'fan', 'great', 'acting', 'add', 'unexpected', 'amount', 'solidity', 'very', 'spacey', 'story.I', 'love', 'Burroughs', 'style', 'read', 'most', 'Tarzans', 'sci-fi', 'kid', 'think', 'film', 'really', 'justice', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'learn', 'was', 'done', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'Wall-E', 'wisest', 'animated', 'film', 'last', 'decade', 'ERB', 'wild', 'flights', 'fancy', 'crazy', 'creatures', 'come', 'life', 'here', 'who', 'could', 'resist', 'six-legged', 'wildly', 'loyal', 'space-dog', 'Dafoe', 'perfect', 'semi-animated', 'role', 'look', 'species', 'film', 'general', 'absolutely', 'knockout', 'blu-ray', 'Incredible', 'colors', 'detail', 'story', 'eye', 'candy', 'visual', 'feel', 'reminded', 'so', 'many', 'best', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'flicks', 'especially', 'Star', 'Wars', 'first', 'Indy', 'small', 'compliment.And', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Kitsch', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'name', 'must', 'delight', 'critics', 'looking', 'be', 'snide', 'found', 'fun', 'dead-on', 'Buster', 'Crabbe', 'better', 'got', 'reference', 'dang', ""'re"", 'old', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'what', 'great', 'kitsch', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'Director', 'Stanton', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'epic', 'so', 'fun', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'true', 'cult', 'classic', 'time', 'one', 'critics', 'missed', 'out', 'entirely', 'PS', 'blu-ray', 'most', 'fine', 'indeed', 'not', 'only', 'perfect', 'transfer', 'good', 'extras', 'including', 'funny', 'making-of', 'crazy', '250', 'mil', 'budget', 'why', 'money', 'turned', 'truly', 'mind-blowing', 'visual', 'experience.It', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Shakespeare', 'great', 'Saturday-afternoon', 'pulp', 'sci-fi']",N/A

Of course the &#34;Incomparable&#34; princess was never more than a raison d'etre in the books anyway so I didn't expect much. I have to say, the VFX were stunning and very true to the books (except Woola was too cute) I just didn't get some aspects of the story and few explanations were given. For instance, why was the city of Zodanga a big moving pile of metal? And, why bring Therns into the plot when they clearly weren't necessary? I have other questions that will never be answered but those are important, sort of. As an action/adventure film it was compelling if a little disjoint and It's too bad there won't be a sequel.

1468180,A2LCSY1RNKWEY,B005LAIH2W,Local Man,"[2, 2]","I read the Barsoon novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs when I was a kid, as classic science fiction adventure from the early 1900s. I liked them better than his better known Tarzan books.  Barsoom was a fantastic world with amazing creatures that would be hard to bring to a movie other than through animation, although many filmmakers had wanted to for decades.  Until Computer Graphics advanced to the level where such creatures could be created and look realistic, any such movie would look cheesy.Andrew Stanton, director of Finding Nemo and Wall-E, was able to construct a movie in this wonderful world, but he slightly modernized the story -- the original story would not have been appreciated by modern audiences -- but Stanton kept the spirit of Burrough's books.  He gave Carter a better back story, of a confederate Calvary captain whose family had been killed and whose home had been destroyed.  Stanton provided a better explanation for the fantastic elements of the story -- a reason why Carter was transported to Mars (known as Barsoom to the natives).Taylor Kitsch was good as John Carter, not amazing, but good.  Lynn Collins, however, was a great Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Mars, who is an accomplished warrior and scientist, and an amazingly beautiful lady.  Mark Strong is one of the best &#34;villain&#34; actors today, and does a nice job in this film.  Willem Dafoe is the voice and provided the motion capture for Tars Tarkis, the &#34;Jedack&#34; of the Tharks, a race of tall, green, 4 armed savage people.This film was the victim of one of the biggest marketing mistakes ever.  The generic title should have been &#34;John Carter of Mars&#34; or &#34;John Carter of Barsoom&#34; or even just &#34;Barsoom.&#34;  The advertising never mentioned that the movie was based upon the classic books by the author of &#34;Tarzan.&#34;  The advertising never mentioned that the director had also made &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; and &#34;Wall-E&#34; (although, this film is nothing like those -- it is a classic adventure).  And most of all, it never explained that &#34;John Carter&#34; was based upon 100-year old books which had been the inspiration for most of the great science fiction adventure stories we have been watching for years -- even George Lucas admitted that the Barsoom books were a significant inspiration for &#34;Star Wars.&#34;  The advertisements had the absolutely wrong tone, featuring some old slow song and clips that made the film seem like a copy of lots of other films without explaining that the other films actually copied from the Barsoom books.One of the big tragedies that this film failed to do well at the box office is that the sequels will never happen.  There were lots more great stories to tell about the amazing creatures and places in Barsoom, but we'll never see those stories unless a LOT of people keep buying the film on DVD, Blue-Ray or Streaming.",5,"Lifelong fan of the books, was thrilled to see ""John Carter"" come to life on the big screen",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,2906,"['read', 'Barsoon', 'novels', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'early', '1900s', 'liked', 'better', 'better', 'known', 'Tarzan', 'books', 'Barsoom', 'was', 'fantastic', 'world', 'amazing', 'creatures', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'bring', 'movie', 'other', 'animation', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'wanted', 'decades', 'Computer', 'Graphics', 'advanced', 'level', 'where', 'such', 'creatures', 'could', 'be', 'created', 'look', 'realistic', 'such', 'movie', 'would', 'look', 'cheesy.Andrew', 'Stanton', 'director', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Wall-E', 'was', 'able', 'construct', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'world', 'slightly', 'modernized', 'story', 'original', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', 'modern', 'audiences', 'Stanton', 'kept', 'spirit', 'Burrough', 'books', 'gave', 'Carter', 'better', 'back', 'story', 'confederate', 'Calvary', 'captain', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'home', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Stanton', 'provided', 'better', 'explanation', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'story', 'reason', 'why', 'Carter', 'was', 'transported', 'Mars', 'known', 'Barsoom', 'natives', '.Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'was', 'good', 'John', 'Carter', 'not', 'amazing', 'good', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'however', 'was', 'great', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'who', 'accomplished', 'warrior', 'scientist', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'lady', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'one', 'best', '34', 'villain', '34', 'actors', 'today', 'nice', 'job', 'film', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'voice', 'provided', 'motion', 'capture', 'Tars', 'Tarkis', '34', 'Jedack', '34', 'Tharks', 'race', 'tall', 'green', '4', 'armed', 'savage', 'people.This', 'film', 'was', 'victim', 'one', 'biggest', 'marketing', 'mistakes', 'ever', 'generic', 'title', 'should', 'have', 'been', '34', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', '34', '34', 'John', 'Carter', 'Barsoom', '34', 'even', 'just', '34', 'Barsoom.', '34', 'advertising', 'never', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'classic', 'books', 'author', '34', 'Tarzan.', '34', 'advertising', 'never', 'mentioned', 'director', 'had', 'also', 'made', '34', 'Finding', 'Nemo', '34', '34', 'Wall-E', '34', 'film', 'nothing', 'classic', 'adventure', 'most', 'never', 'explained', '34', 'John', 'Carter', '34', 'was', 'based', '100-year', 'old', 'books', 'had', 'been', 'inspiration', 'most', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'years', 'even', 'George', 'Lucas', 'admitted', 'Barsoom', 'books', 'were', 'significant', 'inspiration', '34', 'Star', 'Wars.', '34', 'advertisements', 'had', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'tone', 'featuring', 'old', 'slow', 'song', 'clips', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'copy', 'lots', 'other', 'films', 'explaining', 'other', 'films', 'actually', 'copied', 'Barsoom', 'books.One', 'big', 'tragedies', 'film', 'failed', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'sequels', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'were', 'lots', 'more', 'great', 'stories', 'tell', 'amazing', 'creatures', 'places', 'Barsoom', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'stories', 'LOT', 'people', 'keep', 'buying', 'film', 'DVD', 'Blue-Ray', 'Streaming']",N/A

Many reviewers have done an in depth analysis of the film, so I'll keep mine brief.Why only 4 stars?Weakness: Scripting. Plain and simply, I believe that the scripting is the sole reason why the film got panned by critics. The characters are very easy to read and will say exactly what they should say when they should say it. This was a huge weakness and left me curious about why Disney didn't vet this a little better. IMO If the scripting was fixed up and the characters were a bit more.. unique.. it would have made this a 5 star blockbuster. As is, this is pretty much my only complaint about the film.Acting:The acting is well done. The characters interact well and they are very in the moment. However, the script that they seemed to follow to a T is once more the weakness.Filming: It's beautifully filmed. This is definitely some eye candy. I have not yet seen it in 3D, but the 2D version was good enough that I would bet that the 3D version is awesome.Plot: The plot was great. I have watched this film a number of times and enjoyed it during each sitting. I'm happy to say that this did not have the same issues as the scripting.Summary: It's definitely worth a watch. Hopefully Disney sees how well this film is doing on Amazon and decides to create the sequel that we all want to see; albeit with a new team working on the script.",4,Good movie,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,1373,"['movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'depth', 'analysis', 'film', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'mine', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'Weakness', 'Scripting', 'Plain', 'simply', 'believe', 'scripting', 'sole', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'got', 'panned', 'critics', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'read', 'will', 'say', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'say', 'when', 'should', 'say', 'was', 'huge', 'weakness', 'left', 'curious', 'why', 'Disney', 'did', ""n't"", 'vet', 'little', 'better', 'IMO', 'scripting', 'was', 'fixed', 'up', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'more..', 'would', 'have', 'made', '5', 'star', 'blockbuster', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'complaint', 'film.Acting', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'interact', 'well', 'are', 'very', 'moment', 'However', 'script', 'seemed', 'follow', 'T', 'once', 'more', 'weakness.Filming', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'definitely', 'eye', 'candy', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', '3D', '2D', 'version', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'would', 'bet', '3D', 'version', 'awesome.Plot', 'plot', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'number', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'sitting', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'issues', 'scripting.Summary', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'Hopefully', 'Disney', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'doing', 'Amazon', 'decides', 'create', 'sequel', 'want', 'see', 'albeit', 'new', 'team', 'working', 'script']",N/A

Power ""nlp trainer""","[13, 18]","I bought a ticket to another movie, but had to wait an hour, so I thought I would pass time watching John Carter.As JC began I became swiftly swept up in it, forgetting the other movie entirely, as I was so transported.If you're like me and like movies such Star Wars,  I think you will love this movie. I'm not suggesting that it's better than Star Wars, but I certainly enjoyed it than some Star Wars movies.Like many movies our hero John Carter starts out in the ordinary world, in this case, earth slightly after the civil war.  Our hero, a former soldier now disillusioned, has lost his purpose. Now the army attempts to conscript him into service.  Being resourceful he escapes custody, stealing the captains horse, survives a showdown with Indians, seeks shelter in a secret cave with walls of gold.Something happens that transports him to a special world, Mars, with its own rules, where there is a power struggle, between two factions vying for control of the planet, which threatens the destruction of a group of giant indigenous green people, who ultimately become his allies.Quickly, he is taken captive, but in this special world with its different gravity he has special abilities, which impresses his captors.  Pretty soon he crosses paths with an extremely pretty princess, played by Lynn Collins, who has beauty, brains, and fighting skills.  She definitely is not your typical damsel in distress.  She also has an excellent suntan, sky blue eyes, and a most shapely figure.Though worlds separate him from the princess, as he crosses the distance quickly, we come to understand the loss that fuels his reluctance, and when you watch you will discover the cause that fuels his purpose.I have always loved the Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  As a child I would sit in a tree and stop traffic with my blood curdling Tarzan impersonation.  I was unaware that he had also written the John Carter series.This story follows the same mythological pattern set out by Joseph Campbell in his book The Hero has a Thousand faces.  George Lucas followed this template in creating the Star Wars series, and other movies that follow this pattern include The Matrix,  Batman Begins, and Wanted.  John Carter follows yet precedes the pattern, as the book series was written before Campbells book.Stages of the story include a hero called to adventure, refuses the call, something happens to draw him into adventure, meeting the mentor,  meeting the goddess, crossing the threshold, allies, trials and tests, the inmost cave, mastery of both worlds etc.I loved the imagination and the creation of all these Martian characters.Disney was disappointed with its opening weekend gross of $30 million, which tracked several million below expectation.  Supposedly, the movie cost $250 million to make, but I always take these figures with a grain of salt.  The more expensive the movie is, the more impressed people will be, the more likely people are to watch, so figures can easily become inflated.  I think word of mouth will help this movie enormously.If one likes to be swayed by beauty, then one might enjoy the performance of Lynn Collins. I realised early in the movie, that she had not just beauty but a commanding presence, charisma, and acting talent.  In fact she has a strong grounding as a Shakespearean actor, having appeared in Merchant of Venice with Al Pacino.  I did not recognise her because she had different hair, played a man for at least a portion of that movie, and had a Venetian pallor instead of a Martian suntan, or perhaps a Los Angeles spray tan.So, it's nice to see the studio not cast a name but cast a great talent.I loved this movie.

1468191,A24KZBAAUTC83R,B005LAIH2W,Mace & Lacey Gannon,"[9, 12]","I just saw the John Carter film, and I have to say, being a HUGE Edgar Rice Burroughs fan for well over 35 years, this film captured the essence of the Mars series.Although in true Hollywood fashion the film was much different than the original 1st novel - A Princess of Mars - it still managed to get a lot of things right. The filmmakers took several of the concepts and put them in the 1st film, and actually managed to do a credible job. Unfortunately, for people who go to see this film and don't know what the mars language terminology are or means, they may get a little lost. For ones such as I, then they are in for a treat!Director Andrew Stanton and his crew DO manage to create the look and feel of the long-awaited John Carter of Mars movie. The actors are excellent. Especially Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris and Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas. Although Taylor Kitsch did a swell job, I'd much rather have seen Hugh Jackman tackle the role of John Carter. But Taylor did a solid performance.The director did an outstanding job of crating the old-fashioned pulp sci-fi/fantasy feel of the film, while injecting state-of-the-art special effects. The overall look of the film is tremendous.At heart I am a purist when it comes to my boyhood novels and comic books come to life on film. I usually hate it when filmmakers change the scripts they make into films are so vastly different. Rarely do they get it right. (The latest Conan the Barbarian is a perfect example!)And making a huge film like this from a literary giant such as Burroughs, (Yes, he was wayyyy before Tolkien, even!)was not an easy task. But, this time around, they get a hall pass from this gigantic fan. Stanton and his crew kept a lot of the heart of the Burroughs books, and much of the storyline in the 1st book.I hope this movie is a success. It deserves to be. Why? Because you can see that the director had his heart and soul in this, his very first live action movie. For a first-timer, he tackled a major sci-fi/fantasy movie. Not an easy task. He must have balls of steel. And, for the most part, he pulled it off.This begs for a sequel. Because for you people out there that don't know any better, the ending of this film, where John Carter goes back to mars, has him not going back to the arms of his beloved Dejah, but lost in the wilds of mars, where many years have passed, and his beloved wife and son are in extreme danger - as is the entire planet of mars.Now THAT would be a sequel that would not only withstand the age of time, but of movie audiences.",4,Burroughs is Back on the Silver Screen!,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,2546,"['just', 'saw', 'John', 'Carter', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'being', 'HUGE', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'fan', 'well', '35', 'years', 'film', 'captured', 'essence', 'Mars', 'series.Although', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'different', 'original', '1st', 'novel', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'still', 'managed', 'get', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'several', 'concepts', 'put', '1st', 'film', 'actually', 'managed', 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'mars', 'language', 'terminology', 'are', 'means', 'may', 'get', 'little', 'lost', 'ones', 'such', 'then', 'are', 'treat', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'crew', 'DO', 'manage', 'create', 'look', 'feel', 'long-awaited', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'Especially', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'did', 'swell', 'job', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'role', 'John', 'Carter', 'Taylor', 'did', 'solid', 'performance.The', 'director', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'crating', 'old-fashioned', 'pulp', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'feel', 'film', 'injecting', 'state-of-the-art', 'special', 'effects', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'tremendous.At', 'heart', 'am', 'purist', 'when', 'boyhood', 'novels', 'comic', 'books', 'come', 'life', 'film', 'usually', 'hate', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'change', 'scripts', 'make', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'vastly', 'different', 'Rarely', 'do', 'get', 'right', 'latest', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'perfect', 'example', 'making', 'huge', 'film', 'literary', 'giant', 'such', 'Burroughs', 'Yes', 'was', 'wayyyy', 'Tolkien', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'time', 'around', 'get', 'hall', 'pass', 'gigantic', 'fan', 'Stanton', 'crew', 'kept', 'lot', 'heart', 'Burroughs', 'books', 'much', 'storyline', '1st', 'book.I', 'hope', 'movie', 'success', 'be', 'Why', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'had', 'heart', 'soul', 'very', 'first', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'first-timer', 'tackled', 'major', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'movie', 'Not', 'easy', 'task', 'must', 'have', 'balls', 'steel', 'most', 'part', 'pulled', 'off.This', 'begs', 'sequel', 'people', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'ending', 'film', 'where', 'John', 'Carter', 'back', 'mars', 'not', 'going', 'back', 'arms', 'beloved', 'Dejah', 'lost', 'wilds', 'mars', 'where', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'beloved', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'extreme', 'danger', 'entire', 'planet', 'mars.Now', 'THAT', 'would', 'be', 'sequel', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'withstand', 'age', 'time', 'movie', 'audiences']",N/A
1468192,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B005LAIH2W,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I just saw ""John Carter"" and I liked this film very much! Long long time ago, when I was a teenager, I read some of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels in the ""Barsoom"" series (Barsoom means Mars in Martian language) and I enjoyed them greatly. And thanks to this movie, I just relived again this experience and I could enjoy a little bit of the old magic. Burroughs books about Tarzan (he created this character) had quite a number of movie adaptations, but his Martian and Venusian series were considered for a long time too hard to film. Considering that the first book was written in 1912 and that the first plans to film it were made (without success) in 1931, it certainly took time to have a movie version of the first of ""Barsoom"" books - but considering the result, it was worthy waiting that long.Below I tried to describe the best things in this film, with as little SPOILERS as possible.1. John Carter from Virginia, a former captain of Confederate cavalry. For my personal taste Taylor Kitsch pictured him quite well, and the scenario describes him like in the book, as a man courageous, strong and aggressive but also noble, faithful and clever. Unlike in some other action movies I found this hero quite LIKEABLE - he is a little bit grim and sullen in the beginning, but we soon come to understand why and frankly he has reasons to be in such a state of mind. His progressive awakening to a second chance in life is credible and a pleasant thing to watch.2. Dejah Thoris from Helium, the Princess of Mars. Actually, the first book in ""Barsoom"" series, of which this film is the adaptation, had for title precisely ""A Princess of Mars"", as Dejah Thoris is a character as important as John Carter. In the film, in my opinion her character completely steals the show and it is in large part due to the excellent performance of Lynn Collins. Whoever cast her in that role was a genius! Her Dejah Thoris is an excellent mixture of an Amazon (courage and strength), a scientist (brains and learning) and an aristocratic young lady (pride and manners), like in the books.But it is not all. Lynn Collins added to all this a personal touch which made Dejah Thoris also a very feminine character, in the best sense of the term. Although she can swing the sword and pilot the warships as the best male warriors of her country, she also can display a moment of girlish cheerfulness and enthusiasm, smile in a way which melts the hardest hearts, give looks filled with an almost motherly warmth and tenderness (and also a purring promise) and walk in such a way that all males in the assistance are almost howling! I particularly appreciated the fact that when sharpening her sword she simply couldn't resist to look on the blade, check her make up and preen a little... And then, there are short moments when we perceive a brief glimpse of vulnerability - and at that moment she is even more impressive.The fact that Ms Collins is a very beautiful woman with an exceptional figure only adds to her performance - also her clothes, body paintings, haircut, makeup and jewelry were perfectly well chosen! And I really believe that her model of wedding dress should be MANDATORY on Earth - the number of men willing to marry would probably explode overnight as the result! Frankly, when she appeared in her wedding dress, the male part of the public gasped - and in the same time many girls in the cinema started to emit noises similar to those made by a very angry rattlesnake when choking on a half swallowed chinchilla...)))To resume, Lynn Collins pictured a Dejah Thoris so PERFECT and so faithful to the one imagined by Edgar Rice Burroughs, that I had a feeling of ""Dejah Vu"" (sorry, I couldn't resist...)3. The Tharks, desert warriors. Excellent. I found every scene with Thark tribe a delight. The characters of Tars Tarkas and Sola are very well done and played. The Woola ""dog"" is simply too cute and extremely funny - every scene when it appears was welcomed by a big laughter in the cinema.4. Other special effects. This film was very costly and you can really see the effects on the screen. The mobile city of Zodanga, walking through the desolate deserts of Mars is really impressive. The flying warships are excellent. The gigantic White Apes are really impressive and scary. The city of Helium is very beautiful. And finally, the panorama of Mars is really well done - one can immediately see that this world was once full of life, but it is now dying and in dire need of help...5. Dominic West. He plays a scoundrel - again. I must admit that I have a weakness for this actor, since watching him in ""The Wire"", but also the ""300"" and ""Centurion"". Here his role is not as important as it could be, considering that he is not exactly THE main villain (it is not exactly a spoiler - we learn it in the first scene of the film). But it is still a pleasure to watch him.6. Difference with the books. There are many small and one HUGE difference with the ""Princess of Mars"", concerning the race of Therns, who in the book do not play an important role - in the ""Barsoom"" series they really appear in later books. But I believe this HUGE change for once was a rather good thing, as it allows for a more logical explanation of John Carter's travels from Earth to Mars. The smaller differences didn't hurt the movie either.7. The ending is quite good, not stupid at all and rather moving. And that is something not so frequent in modern Hollywood movies. Good job for this one!Bottom line, I liked this film a lot and I am certainly going to buy it as soon as it is available - preferably in Blu-Ray, because here the quality of image has its importance. And I will certainly go to see the sequel if there is one, for many obvious reasons but especially because I am DYING to see how they would solve the little problem of Martian reproduction - because you see, in the books, when John Carter and Dejah Thoris are married, she lays him an egg...)))",4,"A good film, but the title should be  The Princess of Mars , because Dejah Thoris completely steals

Even in this day of CGI miracles this is truly one of the most visually exciting movies of recent years. Even the most jaded fan of CGI will find something to like here. I thought the whole movie was just beautifully done. The exotic, desert-like environment (no doubt shot in the Southwest) of Mars was superbly realized.Other pluses:Strong supporting cast with actors like Mark Strong who excels at playing heavies and courageous bad guys.The ornithopter like flying machines, which ranged from little flitters to bigger battle cruisers, were terrific. A bit like the 'thopters in Dune but more like dragonflies with their glassy wings. Another beautiful special effects job on that.The costumes were another visual feast. I usually don't notice clothing that much but the outfits were just inspired, both men's and women's. It added to the exotic ambience of the Red Planet. It reminded me of the lavish costumes 30 years ago in the Sci Fi movie, Flash Gordon.The 100-mile an hour salamander-like creature who takes a liking to John Carter is a hoot. I want one.An exciting plot with many dramatic twists and turns. I saw some reviews that said the plot was boring. All I can say is stop taking those bong hits while watching a movie, it might improve your attention span.Lots of cool, miscellaneous special effects, such as the energy fields and matrices that appear here and there throughout the movie which were well done and put to good effect.Exciting battle and fight scenes. The humanoids like the 12-foot tall, four-armed Tharps were another plus.I only read one or two of Burroughs's books and that was 45 years ago but I still had a basic knowledge of the story line. I don't know how the Burroughs fans liked it but I thought the movie did justice to his concept of Barsoom (Mars).

1468198,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B005LAIH2W,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[8, 11]","This was a good, solid adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs source material. The film manages to capture the essence of the character and create a decent traditional adventure story. Everything is simple and straightforward driving the plot along. It would not be exceptional but for the fact that so many other film makers would not be capable of doing it. The film is exceptionally well paced aside from the beginning which takes forever to get going.Some changes were made to the source material. Mostly useless and unnecessary changes in my opinion that are each somewhat associated with modern obsessions:(minor spoilers follow)- Carter is given baggage and angst based on his civil war service. This wasn't necessary and thankfully the film minimizes it.- Rather than the ambiguity about how he got to mars that features in the books, we are offered in the film a definitive pseudo-scientific ""alien technology"" reason. I liked the original non-explaination of the book better but obviously people today would think that getting to mars through a cave is ""silly"" while talking about alien technology is the ultimate in scientific seriousness.- The conflict with the apaches is unnecessarly politically correct. It would have been enough to simply have the US Cavalry at war with the apache and use their attempts to draft carter to make him ""man in the middle"" in the conflict. But instead we are given apache pacifists who only start fighting after the army shoots at them.- One of the more silly elements is making Dejah Thoris into a scientist who is going to save mars through technology. First, at the heart of the original concept is that mars can only make progress when its peoples start working together. Making science the savior is against the basic concept. Second, its unnecessary baggage for the character. Someone obviously read the books, thought she wasn't a serious enough character and launched into overcompensation to ""fix"" it. It extends to the point of calling her ""professor"". There were ways to freshen up the character short of the blunt and overly obvious ways they decided to go about doing it.- The worst change is to the Therns. The Therns are changed from the useless reminants of the proud technological past of Mars into all-purpose world destroying alien villians. This was no doubt added because people who see films today want easily identifiable archtype villians. Making the Therns responsible for everything on Mars undercuts one of the basic themes of the book which was the fall of a civilization through a natural disaster and that bringing the people of Mars together was the only way to make things better. The message of the book has a certain amount of relivance to modern politics today. But of course the idea that there is an easily identifiable villian responsible for all problems is even more relivant to the paranoid world of 2012.The Therns should have been presented, in my opinion, as a disinterested small elite on the planet with technology, obsessed with intellectual and religious debate among themselves and no longer interested in the fate of anyone else.The idea of the Therns as manipulators wasn't a bad one. But they could have gone in a better direction with it. Having the Therns, for example, manipulating and pushing an agenda that they considered as improving mars as a whole but without regard to the consequences to individuals such as Dejah Thoris.If they do more films, they should keep the action strictly on Mars. Nobody wants ""tarzan in new york"" with Dejah Thoris playing Tarzan.Despite the lengthy comments, I liked the film and I like the fact that they given a blueprint for how to do an adventure film that others will hopefully take up.",4,good adaptation but lots of questionable changes to source material,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,3728,"['was', 'good', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'source', 'material', 'film', 'capture', 'essence', 'character', 'create', 'decent', 'traditional', 'adventure', 'story', 'Everything', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'driving', 'plot', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'exceptional', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'capable', 'doing', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'paced', 'aside', 'beginning', 'forever', 'get', 'going.Some', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'source', 'material', 'Mostly', 'useless', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'opinion', 'are', 'somewhat', 'associated', 'modern', 'obsessions', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'Carter', 'given', 'baggage', 'angst', 'based', 'civil', 'war', 'service', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'thankfully', 'film', 'it.-', 'Rather', 'ambiguity', 'how', 'got', 'mars', 'features', 'books', 'are', 'offered', 'film', 'definitive', 'pseudo-scientific', 'alien', 'technology', 'reason', 'liked', 'original', 'non-explaination', 'book', 'better', 'obviously', 'people', 'today', 'would', 'think', 'getting', 'mars', 'cave', 'silly', 'talking', 'alien', 'technology', 'ultimate', 'scientific', 'seriousness.-', 'conflict', 'apaches', 'unnecessarly', 'politically', 'correct', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'simply', 'have', 'US', 'Cavalry', 'war', 'apache', 'use', 'attempts', 'draft', 'carter', 'make', 'man', 'middle', 'conflict', 'instead', 'are', 'given', 'apache', 'pacifists', 'who', 'only', 'start', 'fighting', 'army', 'shoots', 'them.-', 'One', 'more', 'silly', 'elements', 'making', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'scientist', 'who', 'going', 'save', 'mars', 'technology', 'First', 'heart', 'original', 'concept', 'mars', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'progress', 'when', 'peoples', 'start', 'working', 'together', 'Making', 'science', 'savior', 'basic', 'concept', 'Second', 'unnecessary', 'baggage', 'character', 'Someone', 'obviously', 'read', 'books', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'serious', 'enough', 'character', 'launched', 'overcompensation', 'fix', 'point', 'calling', 'professor', 'were', 'ways', 'freshen', 'up', 'character', 'short', 'blunt', 'overly', 'obvious', 'ways', 'decided', 'go', 'doing', 'it.-', 'worst', 'change', 'Therns', 'Therns', 'are', 'changed', 'useless', 'reminants', 'proud', 'technological', 'past', 'Mars', 'all-purpose', 'world', 'destroying', 'alien', 'villians', 'was', 'doubt', 'added', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'films', 'today', 'want', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'archtype', 'villians', 'Making', 'Therns', 'responsible', 'everything', 'Mars', 'undercuts', 'one', 'basic', 'themes', 'book', 'was', 'fall', 'civilization', 'natural', 'disaster', 'bringing', 'people', 'Mars', 'together', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'message', 'book', 'certain', 'amount', 'relivance', 'modern', 'politics', 'today', 'course', 'idea', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'villian', 'responsible', 'problems', 'even', 'more', 'relivant', 'paranoid', 'world', '2012.The', 'Therns', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'opinion', 'disinterested', 'small', 'elite', 'planet', 'technology', 'obsessed', 'intellectual', 'religious', 'debate', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'fate', 'anyone', 'else.The', 'idea', 'Therns', 'manipulators', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'better', 'direction', 'Having', 'Therns', 'example', 'manipulating', 'pushing', 'agenda', 'considered', 'improving', 'mars', 'whole', 'regard', 'consequences', 'individuals', 'such', 'Dejah', 'Thoris.If', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'should', 'keep', 'action', 'strictly', 'Mars', 'Nobody', 'tarzan', 'new', 'york', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'playing', 'Tarzan.Despite', 'lengthy', 'comments', 'liked', 'film', 'like', 'fact', 'given', 'blueprint', 'how', 'do', 'adventure', 'film', 'others', 'will', 'hopefully', 'take', 'up']",N/A

1468204,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B005LAIH2W,Marshall Lord,"[3, 3]","""John Carter"" is a 2012 film version of the first of the eleven books of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic Martian series. This review is based on watching the film at home on Blu-Ray.When the people who produced this decided to bring out a film version of a book which had first been published almost exactly a hundred years before (""A Princess of Mars: John Carter of Mars, Book 1"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs was first been published in serial form in 1912 as ""Under the Moons of Mars"") and which had enormously influenced a great many subsequent sci-fi adventures, they must have known that there was a risk of critics and audiences saying ""We've seen it all before"" - because they had seen films and read books which shamelessly copied from Rice Burroughs' ideas.For exmple, Luke Skywalker's battle with the Rancor in ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1 Disc) [DVD],"" and the similar scene with his parents and Obi Wan Kenobi in ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones [DVD] [2002],"" and indeed, just about every scene in a Science Fiction or Fantasy adventure in which the hero and/or heroine have to fight for their lives in front of an audience against huge, strange and terrifying monsters, are pretty much plagiarised from a scene in ""A Princess of Mars"" which is reasonably faithfully reproduced in this film with the credit (or blame!) finally going where it properly belongs.Sure enough, when it came out this film had mixed reviews from critics and some of the flak did appear to be accusations of a lack or originality, with one critic calling the film ""derivative"" and another saying that ""everything in the movie has been done so many times before, and so much better."" A slightly more positive comment along the same lines was that ""just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere.""Even allowing for the fact that this particular criticism was rather unfair, there were a lot of critical  raspberries, and this film didn't do too well in the US box office. So when I rented this and sat down to watch it with my family I wasn't expecting anything too special, but we were pleasantly surprised.Edgar Rice Burroughs' tale of a Confederate Civil War veteran miraculously transported though space (and possibly time) to the red planet which we call Mars and its' inhabitants call Barsoom was created on film with a fair degree of respect but without taking itself too seriously. The airships of Barsoom, the giant green Tharks, the great cities of Barsoom, the heroic John Carter (Taylor Kitch), the brave and beautiful princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Colins) and even Woola, Carter's loyal calot, (a Barsoomian creature the size of a shetland pony who acts like a dog) - it's all here.The action in the film flowed reasonably fast, the characters were well presented and there was some quite good humour.It's not the most brilliant film I've ever seen and the mixed reviews demonstrated that not everyone liked it, but my family did find this entertaining. As mentioned ""A Princess of Mars"" was the first of eleven Barsoom novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs: if the creators of this film ever manage to get the finance to have a go at making film versions of any the remaining ten books I will certainly watch them.",4,"Filn version of ""A Princess of Mars""",1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,3271,"['John', 'Carter', '2012', 'film', 'version', 'first', 'eleven', 'books', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'classic', 'Martian', 'series', 'review', 'based', 'watching', 'film', 'home', 'Blu-Ray.When', 'people', 'who', 'produced', 'decided', 'bring', 'out', 'film', 'version', 'book', 'had', 'first', 'been', 'published', 'almost', 'exactly', 'hundred', 'years', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'Book', '1', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'was', 'first', 'been', 'published', 'serial', 'form', '1912', 'Moons', 'Mars', 'had', 'enormously', 'influenced', 'great', 'many', 'subsequent', 'sci-fi', 'adventures', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'risk', 'critics', 'audiences', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'had', 'seen', 'films', 'read', 'books', 'shamelessly', 'copied', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'ideas.For', 'exmple', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'battle', 'Rancor', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'VI', 'Return', 'Jedi', '1', 'Disc', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'similar', 'scene', 'parents', 'Obi', 'Wan', 'Kenobi', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'II', 'Attack', 'Clones', '[', 'DVD', ']', '[', '2002', ']', 'indeed', 'just', 'scene', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'adventure', 'hero', 'and/or', 'heroine', 'have', 'fight', 'lives', 'front', 'audience', 'huge', 'strange', 'terrifying', 'monsters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'plagiarised', 'scene', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'reasonably', 'faithfully', 'reproduced', 'film', 'credit', 'blame', 'finally', 'going', 'where', 'properly', 'belongs.Sure', 'enough', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'film', 'had', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'critics', 'flak', 'did', 'appear', 'be', 'accusations', 'lack', 'originality', 'one', 'critic', 'calling', 'film', 'derivative', 'saying', 'everything', 'movie', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'slightly', 'more', 'positive', 'comment', 'same', 'lines', 'was', 'just', 'sci-fi/fantasy/superhero', 'adventure', 'ever', 'loved', 'here', 'somewhere', 'Even', 'allowing', 'fact', 'particular', 'criticism', 'was', 'rather', 'unfair', 'were', 'lot', 'critical', 'raspberries', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'well', 'US', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'rented', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'family', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'too', 'special', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'tale', 'Confederate', 'Civil', 'War', 'veteran', 'miraculously', 'transported', 'space', 'possibly', 'time', 'red', 'planet', 'call', 'Mars', 'inhabitants', 'call', 'Barsoom', 'was', 'created', 'film', 'fair', 'degree', 'respect', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'airships', 'Barsoom', 'giant', 'green', 'Tharks', 'great', 'cities', 'Barsoom', 'heroic', 'John', 'Carter', 'Taylor', 'Kitch', 'brave', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Lynn', 'Colins', 'even', 'Woola', 'Carter', 'loyal', 'calot', 'Barsoomian', 'creature', 'size', 'shetland', 'pony', 'who', 'dog', 'here.The', 'action', 'film', 'flowed', 'reasonably', 'fast', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'presented', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'humour.It', 'not', 'most', 'brilliant', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'demonstrated', 'not', 'everyone', 'liked', 'family', 'did', 'find', 'entertaining', 'mentioned', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'was', 'first', 'eleven', 'Barsoom', 'novels', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'creators', 'film', 'ever', 'manage', 'get', 'finance', 'have', 'go', 'making', 'film', 'versions', 'remaining', 'ten', 'books', 'will', 'certainly', 'watch']",N/A

The aliens were entirely believable--perhaps occasionally more-so than their live acting counterparts but visually it was appealing and the action was character driven AND there was plenty of it.  They changed the storyline to make Burroughs' original epic more modern in terms of real-world knowledge without destroying any of the innocence about alien worlds that existed when he wrote it in the early part of the twentieth century.  Sadly, the title should have remained true to the book for die-hard fans and the absence of ""Mars"" in the final title seems to reflect ignorance on the part of the marketing team/people in charge, but if you enjoyed the book series for what it was (idealistic hero type romp) then you should enjoy this movie.And I give two thumbs up to the creators/animators and voices of the four-armed green-skinned martians who made the movie amazingly fun!

1468231,A16XRPF40679KG,B005LAIH2W,Michael Dobey,"[3, 3]","This is a good action flick , and most people who see it will like it. As it is a VERY HIGH BUDGET flick. NO expense was spared and this was done as a labor of love to the classic john carter of mars books by Edgar rice borroughs.  Those books changed popular science fiction and influenced all that came later. Of course edgar is better known for Tarzan. But this is a good version of his books.  It is very well done and In 3d it looks stunning. However , like most 3d you get depth here and little that pops out at you. Those who expect that don't know what 3d is really about , and may be unsatisfied on that account.  Not me though , as I enjoyed this film immensely. The effects are fantastic , the sets are great and stick to the books. IT's got a cool monster dog character , and has that romantic streak in it that we all love.  A man falls for a princess and fights for her!.  It's got good versus evil as well. It is amazing this got made at all. And I salute the people who did this , as they beat the odds to get this to the screen. The removing of mars from the title may have hurt this movie , I don't know. But this is a movie you can watch with your family and it's exciting , and afterward you can give your kid a john carter book to read! As they still thrill even today. Of course it doesn't help that we now know that mars is a wasteland. but back when this was written , people were sure that canals were on mars, and cities too. But it doesn't matter , as it's a cool movie.  A good action film that you can watch with your kids as even the violence is not too graphic. It's similar to the star wars type of violence. give this one a chance!.  The extras include deleted scenes, and other documentaries.

1468235,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B005LAIH2W,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[9, 13]","The fact that this movie's title changed from ""John Carter of Mars"" to simply ""John Carter"" is symptomatic of how hard it is to sell the planetary romance genre to modern audiences.  And that's a shame, because planetary romance has already achieved commercial success in two major franchises.Sci-fi fans will recognize all the elements: an adventurer travels to a foreign land, faces hostile tribes of primitive aliens who wield considerably more power than the ""modern"" despots, earns their respect, and ultimately leads a rebellion in upsetting the old world order while winning the hand and heart of a princess. Sound familiar? Before Star Wars and Dune, there was Edgar Rice Burrough's Barsoom series.Here's the thing: planetary romance by modern standards is cheesy, shallow, and likely a tad racist if not misogynistic.  The ""savage"" races are often analogues for other cultures, women are trophies to be won, and the hero is usually a white guy.  In short...all the criticisms leveled at Star Wars. Modern audiences won't tolerate anything so overt, so the princesses are always tough - but they still need rescuing.  The princess of John Carter is no different; Lynn Collins plays the princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris, and as soon as we see her it's hard to ignore the fact that the girl is buff.  There's a reason her arms are so wiry, and it's refreshing to see that Thoris looks and feels like she could kill a man with a single sword stroke.But back to the titular hero.  He's a Confederate soldier with an awkward past on the hunt for gold.  The Han Solo of the Barsoomian universe, he's largely out for himself. In a world where he can jump fantastic distances and punch twelve-foot tall four-armed Martians to death, Carter is free to do as he pleases.  The only shackles binding him are the affairs of the heart, thus the importance of the princess and Carter's involvement with Thark leader Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe).  Their relationship gets off to a rocky start when Tarkas gets Carter's name wrong and insists on treating him like a pet.It's not long before Carter stops worrying about getting home and starts thinking about getting it on with the inventor/warrior/princess Thoris.  She's fleeing a pending marriage to rival despot Sab Than (Dominic West) that threatens to doom her kingdom.  Imagine Princess Leia never taking off the slave outfit from Return of the Jedi with more muscles and you get the idea.And that's the thing.  On the surface, John Carter seems like a copy of the films that have since imitated its source material. There's a loyal dog-like alien named Woola, an alien sidekick, and swashbuckling battles on hovering ships.  John Carter is epic, but it's a little late to a party it kicked off decades ago.Taylor Kitsch is a blank slate, playing Carter as a brooding and monosyllabic thug.  Carter might have spawned rough heroes like Han Solo, but Kitsch lacks Ford's easy charisma. Unfortunately much of the film rests on Kitsch's chiseled abs. The film soldiers on heroically without him.The special effects are effortless, which is no mean feat in light of four-armed aliens, four-armed apes, and six-legged everything elses. Dafoe is brilliant as Tarkas, Collins is alternately desperate and heroic as Thoris, and even Woola manages to not be too annoying.  The script is top notch, filled with humorous asides and character-building moments that swell along with the music.  It's just Kitsch that's the problem.  If you can look past Kitsch, this is a rollicking good beginning to what we can only hope is a trilogy that will make its grandchildren, like Star Wars, proud.",4,Kitschy,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,3624,"['fact', 'movie', 'title', 'changed', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'simply', 'John', 'Carter', 'symptomatic', 'how', 'hard', 'sell', 'planetary', 'romance', 'genre', 'modern', 'audiences', 'shame', 'planetary', 'romance', 'already', 'achieved', 'commercial', 'success', 'two', 'major', 'franchises.Sci-fi', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'elements', 'adventurer', 'travels', 'foreign', 'land', 'hostile', 'tribes', 'primitive', 'aliens', 'who', 'wield', 'considerably', 'more', 'power', 'modern', 'despots', 'respect', 'ultimately', 'rebellion', 'upsetting', 'old', 'world', 'order', 'winning', 'hand', 'heart', 'princess', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Dune', 'was', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burrough', 'Barsoom', 'series.Here', 'thing', 'planetary', 'romance', 'modern', 'standards', 'cheesy', 'shallow', 'likely', 'tad', 'racist', 'not', 'misogynistic', 'savage', 'races', 'are', 'often', 'analogues', 'other', 'cultures', 'women', 'are', 'trophies', 'be', 'won', 'hero', 'usually', 'white', 'guy', 'short', 'criticisms', 'leveled', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Modern', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'anything', 'so', 'overt', 'princesses', 'are', 'always', 'tough', 'still', 'need', 'rescuing', 'princess', 'John', 'Carter', 'different', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'princess', 'Helium', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'hard', 'ignore', 'fact', 'girl', 'buff', 'reason', 'arms', 'are', 'so', 'wiry', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Thoris', 'feels', 'could', 'kill', 'man', 'single', 'sword', 'stroke.But', 'back', 'titular', 'hero', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'awkward', 'past', 'hunt', 'gold', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Barsoomian', 'universe', 'largely', 'out', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'jump', 'fantastic', 'distances', 'punch', 'twelve-foot', 'tall', 'four-armed', 'Martians', 'death', 'Carter', 'free', 'do', 'only', 'shackles', 'binding', 'are', 'affairs', 'heart', 'thus', 'importance', 'princess', 'Carter', 'involvement', 'Thark', 'leader', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'relationship', 'off', 'rocky', 'start', 'when', 'Tarkas', 'Carter', 'name', 'wrong', 'insists', 'treating', 'pet.It', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Carter', 'worrying', 'getting', 'home', 'thinking', 'getting', 'inventor/warrior/princess', 'Thoris', 'fleeing', 'pending', 'marriage', 'rival', 'despot', 'Sab', 'Than', 'Dominic', 'West', 'doom', 'kingdom', 'Imagine', 'Princess', 'Leia', 'never', 'taking', 'off', 'slave', 'outfit', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'more', 'muscles', 'get', 'idea.And', 'thing', 'surface', 'John', 'Carter', 'copy', 'films', 'have', 'imitated', 'source', 'material', 'loyal', 'dog-like', 'alien', 'named', 'Woola', 'alien', 'sidekick', 'swashbuckling', 'battles', 'hovering', 'ships', 'John', 'Carter', 'epic', 'little', 'late', 'party', 'kicked', 'off', 'decades', 'Kitsch', 'blank', 'slate', 'playing', 'Carter', 'brooding', 'monosyllabic', 'thug', 'Carter', 'might', 'have', 'spawned', 'rough', 'heroes', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Kitsch', 'Ford', 'easy', 'charisma', 'Unfortunately', 'much', 'film', 'rests', 'Kitsch', 'chiseled', 'abs', 'film', 'soldiers', 'heroically', 'him.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'effortless', 'mean', 'feat', 'light', 'four-armed', 'aliens', 'four-armed', 'apes', 'six-legged', 'everything', 'elses', 'Dafoe', 'brilliant', 'Tarkas', 'Collins', 'alternately', 'desperate', 'heroic', 'Thoris', 'even', 'Woola', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'annoying', 'script', 'top', 'notch', 'filled', 'humorous', 'asides', 'character-building', 'moments', 'swell', 'music', 'just', 'Kitsch', 'problem', 'can', 'look', 'past', 'Kitsch', 'rollicking', 'good', 'beginning', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'trilogy', 'will', 'make', 'grandchildren', 'Star', 'Wars', 'proud']",N/A

In the case of John Carter, Disney's 2012 spaghetti western science experiment that call came too soon for the legions of now unemployed production and marketing staff who brought this overwrought and under thought budget busting  sci-fi-western-fantasy-romance-unintentional comedy to our midst only to see it subjected to a fusillade of critical pounding and countless empty theaters.Originally envisioned as a franchise for the studio with two sequels already planned, those plans were immediately scuttled as Carter's Martian adventure brought with it an extraterrestrial write-down of $175 million for the Mouse House.To be fair, I have to admit a rather perverse fascination for films that by any objective measure - really suck. Not films that started with an interesting premise but wound up sabotaged by a bit of odd casting and leaden acting (Waterworld?) but productions that failed dismally through self-inflicted head shots at every stage of development from concept, production, continuity and marketing.Within a ridiculous, convoluted miasma of Peckinpaugh meets Leone meets Lucas meets Roddenberry meets Spielberg meets The Princess Bride, John Carter had no chance to ever present a cohesive storyline. Born on earth in the early 19th century, incomprehensively transported to Mars and thrust into their civil war all while beguiling a sullen princess who is promised in marriage to an enemy overlord.In this deep space muddle, the required suspension of disbelief is never the problem, it is the suspension of belief that always intrudes on the film through absurd dialogue, nonsensical plot twists and action sequences that would make a video game programmer wince.

1468245,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B005LAIH2W,mk,"[17, 23]","As a fitting 100 year anniversary homage to Edgar Rice Burrough's first hero and heroine, before Tarzan, Disney delivers with the big bucks, special effects and adventure fantasy, although Hollywoodish, that can appeal to longsuffering fans, old and new.I grew up reading this fantastic series and eventually all of ERB's books.  I believe this screenplay works off the set of the first three books, originally written as serials: A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars. Let me just say that although this movie is a different story than the books, it stays pretty faithful to the original elements and characters.The title John Carter of Mars was the 11th book of the series.  No biggie, one needs the name.  But here the hero, unlike the solid Virginia gentleman of the book, carrys a nightmarish back story, and overall, he's in it just for the gold.  Typical Hollywood.  Where the moviemakers redeem themselves are in the effects, the great visuals of Mars, and the fun characterizations.The actors are well chosen.  Willem Dafoe is the voice of the savage but noble Thark, Tars Tarkas.  They include a cute but ferocious and fast, Woola, Carter's Martian 'dog' or calot; they show Carter struggle, like Toby Maguire in Spiderman, with his new found leaping ablilites on Mars; the Princess is beautiful, exotic but willing and wanting to fight.  Like the novels, there's an uncertain romance in the air.My favorite scene, as in the books, is when John Carter is fighting the massive hordes coming down against him, jumping and leaping, sword flashing with faithful Woola at his side, slicing the enemy in such great numbers that the bodies pile up into ever growing mounds of dead flesh.  Sounds more gruesome than it is shown on screen.The movie's a visual feast, and for those of us who have waited for decades for the film to be made, and made extremely, high budget and all, well, I am overjoyed and totally willing to overlook the changes in story.  The heart of Edgar Rice Burrough's beloved Mars beats red as ever, and we can only hope for more.",5,At Long Last!,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,2074,"['fitting', '100', 'year', 'anniversary', 'homage', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burrough', 'first', 'hero', 'heroine', 'Tarzan', 'Disney', 'big', 'bucks', 'special', 'effects', 'adventure', 'fantasy', 'Hollywoodish', 'can', 'appeal', 'longsuffering', 'fans', 'old', 'new.I', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'fantastic', 'series', 'eventually', 'ERB', 'books', 'believe', 'screenplay', 'set', 'first', 'three', 'books', 'originally', 'written', 'serials', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'Gods', 'Mars', 'Warlord', 'Mars', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'different', 'story', 'books', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'original', 'elements', 'characters.The', 'title', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'was', '11th', 'book', 'series', 'biggie', 'one', 'name', 'here', 'hero', 'solid', 'Virginia', 'gentleman', 'book', 'carrys', 'nightmarish', 'back', 'story', 'overall', 'just', 'gold', 'Typical', 'Hollywood', 'Where', 'moviemakers', 'redeem', 'are', 'effects', 'great', 'visuals', 'Mars', 'fun', 'characterizations.The', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'chosen', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'voice', 'savage', 'noble', 'Thark', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'include', 'cute', 'ferocious', 'fast', 'Woola', 'Carter', 'Martian', ""'dog"", 'calot', 'show', 'Carter', 'struggle', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'Spiderman', 'new', 'found', 'leaping', 'ablilites', 'Mars', 'Princess', 'beautiful', 'exotic', 'willing', 'wanting', 'fight', 'novels', 'uncertain', 'romance', 'air.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'books', 'when', 'John', 'Carter', 'fighting', 'massive', 'hordes', 'coming', 'down', 'jumping', 'leaping', 'sword', 'flashing', 'faithful', 'Woola', 'side', 'slicing', 'enemy', 'such', 'great', 'numbers', 'bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'ever', 'growing', 'mounds', 'dead', 'flesh', 'more', 'gruesome', 'shown', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'visual', 'feast', 'who', 'have', 'waited', 'decades', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'made', 'extremely', 'high', 'budget', 'well', 'am', 'overjoyed', 'totally', 'willing', 'overlook', 'changes', 'story', 'heart', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burrough', 'beloved', 'Mars', 'beats', 'red', 'ever', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'more']",N/A

I don't recall if I read the novel when I was a youngster, but it has a feeling of being pretty true to its source.  I do seem to recall that the novel's character was a civil war soldier who awoke on Mars.  And adding Edgar Rice Burroughs, the original novelist, to the film was a cute touch.  Yes, the film does resemble many other epic FX movies out there, but I thought the special effects dept did an incredible job with the Tharks.  Movies have come a long way in just a dozen years with regards to special effects.  As far as adventures goes, it's a fairly enjoyable story.Part of the problem with the film, though, is the casting.  The leading man is bland, and he and the leading lady never established any kind of chemistry on camera.The 3D in the film looks terrific at times, but then in some him/her two-shots it looks flat.  In retrospect, I am thinking the parts that looked best were those shots processed through a computer (crowd shots, long shots, special effects).  I know there have been some who said the 3D was terrible, but through a pair of passive glasses, it looked pretty good on the whole.The 7.1 audio was excellent.The extras (which are on the regular Blu-ray disc) include a history of the novel to film, a few bloopers (too few), and a day on the set (this was well done and ran about 35 minutes).  Also there is an opportunity to hook up your iPad or computer to look at a second screen of background material while watching the film.  To me, this is something that they should have done on your TV while watching the film.  By moving it to an outlying device, you increase people's frustration and at the same time by putting it to an iPad or computer it cuts out the chance for more than one person to view it at a time.

But I never knew Edgar Rice Burroughts also wrote the John Carter series of books.  In this the first, in what I'm sure the Disney folks hope won't be the last of many films about the character, I'm a bit conflicted.  The film tries to pull together elements of ""Avatar"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and even the TV series ""Hell on Wheels.""  It partially succeeds.Carter (Taylor Kitsch, TV's ""Friday Night Lights""), a Civil War veteran from Virginia, seeks his fortune in the West by searching for gold shortly after the war.  In an unnecessary sequence he is imprisoned by the controlling military Colonel (Bryan Cranston, ""Drive"") because he doesn't want to fight the local Apaches.  Escaping, Carter finds his way to a cave, filled with gold.  He also finds a medallion that when rubbed, sends him to the planet Barsoom.  We know it as Mars.  Forgetting what science now knows, Mars has breathable air and has a temperature appropriate for bare skin.  It also has a gravity pull much less than Earth, so Carter develops some unique abilities including heighten strength and jumping.Carter first meets local 4 armed, green inhabitants headed by Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe).  Eventually he makes nice with them and they become allies in a final battle against the evil-doers trying to take control of the planet.  Those bad guys are headed by Sab Than (Dominic West, ""The Awakening"") and his mystical shape-shifting mentor Matai Shang (Mark Strong, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"").  They are in a civil war against other humanoids headed by Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds, ""The Debt"") and his princess daughter Dejah (a delicious Lynn Collins, ""X-Men: Wolverine"").Directed by animated wizard Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo""), the story bogs down too often in order to provide info to the characters and the audience about who and what each tribe is about, how Carter got to Mars, how he's going to get back to Earth, what happened to Carter's family, etc.  For films of this genre, with many funny names and fantasy driven story lines, I found this pretty easy to follow.  When the battles begin, so does the fun.  The airships which look like huge dragonflies are very cool but not well built, so we see them crash often.The visuals and sound in the film are really exceptional and this is where the wow factor comes in.  The movie looks great.  The romantic relationship between Taylor and Dejah really never develops.  I'm sure it will if there are sequels, but here it remains a one night stand with no fleshy details.

Did you know that it was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs in a 11-volume Barsoom series of novels from 1912-1943?  Did you know that this story was written WAY before Star Wars or anything George Lucas, J.R.R Tolkien or James Cameron came up with?  In fact, this story probably influenced them and other big sci-fi & fantasy writers & movie directors while growing up!Keeping that in mind, you then start to RESPECT it!Now I knew this before I went to see it and I was totally impressed.In fact, it's what the new Star Wars 1, 2, & 3 should have been (God, those films were so BAD and I loved 4, 5 & 6)!The biggest problem with this movie was all in the marketing by Disney.Disney should have mentioned the history of this story and having the balls to say something like, ""Before Star Wars, before Avatar, before The Lord of the Rings came an incredible story of an earth-man stranded in the middle of a fantastic war, on Mars"", or something like that.Instead they flashed a bunch of action scenes from the movie, which was a very BAD idea.Because when I first saw the trailer, I knew that most people would have thought it just looked like a rip-off of Star Wars or Avatar, when in fact those stories probably ripped their ideas from John Carter.It's a shame because I doubt Disney will continue filming it because it flopped in the theater (hope that marketing team gets fired at Disney).But if you watch it knowing it's history, then you might come to enjoy and respect it.I thought it was a lot of fun, but of course not perfect.  There were very few parts of the film that were a tad bit boring, but the 3D and scenery were fantastic so it made up for those moments.  Acting was great, costumes were very good, CGI scenery was excellent and characters were believable.  A solid good sci-fi movie!I bought the 3D blu-ray and am thankful it's in my collection.

There were major successes like Avengers, Dark Knight Rises, and the first Hobbit film.  Then we had several movies that were intended to start franchises, but performed so poorly that the franchises-to-be were put on hold.  In no general order, they were John Carter, Prometheus, and Snow White and the Huntsman.  The first, John Carter, is based on the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, one of America's greatest writers of science fiction.  Featuring a big ensemble cast full of up-and-coming stars, great special effects, a good story-line, and what should have been a big fan base, this movie almost flopped at the box office, leading to some turnover at Disney's corporate headquarters.  The end result was a quick transition to the home video market, where it has found success.  This two-disc version is one of several versions available for purchase, and for those without a 3-D capable TV, this is probably the best choice.  The movie quality comes across quite nice from beginning to end.  The film itself is beautiful, and is probably the best role so far for Texas native Lynn Collins.  Watching this movie, one can see that many of the top sci-fi films of the past 40 years have been inspired by the Barsoom series of novels.  For example, Collin's character, Dejah Thoris, is clearly the inspiration for Princess Leia.  Likewise the titular character of John Carter seems a good template from which to start Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

There's a lot to like here, as so many reviews point out. I'm a lifelong reader of Burroughs, and somewhat to my surprise, I instantly liked many of the ways in which the film fills out what can be pretty thin writing in the original novel. But this is only two-thirds of a movie, and really falls short in some important respects. John Carter himself needed and deserved much more depth as a character in order to move from page to screen franchise. Robert Downey's Sherlock Holmes shows how a novelized character can be developed into a film presence; John Carter makes it partway there, but the main character just isn't compelling. Ditto Deja Thoris, who ends up being personable and appealing, and well acted, but never the ultra-female force that she could have been. Did Disney require that she be kept under wraps (literally: clad in metal) when the modern screen calls for her to be unleashed? And the director never solved the problem of alien Tars Tarkas, who needs to come across as a strong individual but who in the film ends up as one of a beautifully-executed but relatively characterless army of Tharks. The result of these unrealized needs is a movie that never comes entirely to life, and which rarely excites or thrills, even though so much of what has been accomplished is impressive and cool.

I'm one of those people who read the books as a young adult because they are a part of science fiction history and I felt I should know about them, and after reading them, thought, ""Eh, they're okay.""  Heavy on the adventure, light on the science.  As adventure stories, they're quite entertaining.It's been many years since I've read the books, but from what I recall, the movie captures the feel of the books very well.  Carter has his ""super-strength"" and ""super-jumping"" powers from the books (John Carter was a pre-cursor to Superman).  Like most modern big-budget special-effect laden Sci-Fi movies, this is designed to be seen in a movie theater and not on your TV set.  The actress playing Dejah Thoris is very attractive (but wears more clothes than in the books.  Hey, it's a Disney movie, what do you expect?)The green-skinned, 4-armed Tharks were just a little too comical looking, but I suppose since most of the humor in the film comes during Carter's stay with them, this fits.

There is a bit of wooden dialog, but the ""flavor"" of Barsoom is well captured in this production. Being Disney, the mild lack of clothing for the Princess is understandable (she is naked in the novel).The action is typical of many of today's action stories, and that doesn't help when it comes to making this thing stand out. Bookended by John Carter's ""literary"" association with the author (Edgar Rice Burroughs), it doesn't end with the cliff hanger of the book (many of Burroughs series, including Tarzan, followed the same pattern -- boy discovers girl, boy loses girl, boy has to overcome almost impossible odds to save girl, only to end the story with boy and girl being again separated, despite their obvious love for each other). That same formula is repeated in the movie and it works well.While the ""real"" Dejah Thoris is young (around twenty), the actress in the film (Lynn Collins) did an admirable job playing her opposite Taylor Kitsch's John Carter, despite being older (thirty-something). Kitsch, himself, isn't too bad, but the performance is uneven. As a former rebel, wanting nothing to do with the Union Army in the American Southwest, he was tough and no-nonsense. Once transported to Mars, he became somewhat less rebellious, giving me the impression that I was watching two different characters. I wasn't sure if that was intended, but Carter of Mars (and the end of the film back on earth) reminded me more of Hugh Jackman in Kate and Leopold, rather than his tough as, well, nails Wolverine.Still, effects were good, CGI pretty much seamless, and okay Burroughs-esque story.

1468289,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B005LAIH2W,O Shepard,"[3, 4]","The first 'adult' books I read as a child were Edgar Rice Burrough's adventures of John Carter on Mars in hardcover editions that belonged to my father. My 11 year old self was fascinated by the adventures of the post Civil War Confederate soldier on the red planet that transcended space and time. So like many pre-adolescent fans of the books, I was pleased that John Carter was coming to the screen after many false starts over the hundred year history of the books original publication.  To prepare for the release of the fllm, I reread the first few of the books in the series. Time and my own maturity did not make the books age well to my eyes. The writing was awful. The dialogue was Victorian and stiff. The dated morality almost laughable. Racism and sexism, though taken for granted in the 1910's, was disturbing.  I  understood that the books reflected the early 20th century age it was written in. 'A Princess of Mars', the first John Carter book, was written  in 1911 and published in a pulp magazine in 1912 with the title 'Under the Moons of Mars'.The books were written by a man who failed at every endeaver he ever tried. Burroughs grew up in the latter part of the 19th Century. His social and cultural outlook was painfully Victorian and he knew nothing of Mars nor of science, but he knew how to spin a good yarn that captured the imagination of young boys.After reading the first 3 books again, I realized why the books had never made it to the screen. It was not only a matter of the need for the art of the motion picture to develop believable CGI  but also how to change the book to appeal to modern senses and culture. How to you film a book that was terribly written but which captures the appeal of it by generations of horny adolescents. So the director and writers altered the story of John Carter and hoped for the best. In my judgement, they succeeded.'John Carter the Movie'  loosely follows Burrough's 'A Princess of Mars'. We are introduced to John Carter via the same method that Burroughs introduced him to his readers - through a story framing device. Burroughs inserts himself into the story as the nephew of the mysterious John Carter who has amassed a small fortune and dies in the mid-1880's. His uncle leaves instructions to his young nephew to follow his burial wishes exactly - to entomb his body in a mausoleum  that can only be opened from the inside. John Carter also leaves a journal of his astounding adventures for the young Burroughs to read. This story framing device was also used successful by Burroughs in his other great adventure series, the Tarzan books.Th framing device of storytelling is as compelling as it was in the original book though the plot has been altered from the start to fit a more modern and more  believable  interpretation of  the Therns (the movie's villians). No longer are the Therns the bald priestly white race of Mars. They may not even be from Mars. More story alterations follow.No longer does John Carter simply raises his arms to Mars in the Arizona desert and get magically teleported. He discovered a teleportation device instead.  No longer is he a confederate soldier searching for gold with a partner being chased by Apaches. He is escaping from the custody of US soldiers who stupidly shoot at a band of indians causing them to attack. A back story involving Carter's family is added to provide clearer character motivation for his subsequent actions.The film was doomed to fail at the box office no matter what. Fans would see a different story then their memories.  Movie goers would watch it and wonder what the fuss was about. It was just another superhero movie with great CGI on a Mars that could not possibly exist. (NOTE: I may be incorrect here but I remember that Burroughs plotted John Carter's magical transport to Mars and back to earth and back to Mars again as a trip that transcended both space and time; that Barsoom was a Mars of many thousands of years ago. His Barsoom was not a desert world but a dying world with fields of red grasslands and purple vegetation )The director, Andrew Stanton, has made a credible effort to bring the essence of Barsoom and the John Carter stories to modern audiences by extensive rewrites to the original story. Just look at who was assigned script writting tasks. Amoung the screenwriters are Michael Chabon and Colin Wilson. Predictably, the film did better overseas then in the U.S. where it was not the money making blockbuster that Disney hoped for. It was a tremendously over budgeted film but in what universe other than the unrealistic expectations of bloated Hollywood studios would a take of $271 million be considered a flop?This is actually a good film, no better and no worse that then the parade of other summer extravaganzas that the movie going public is subjected to.

1468294,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B005LAIH2W,pastapadre,"[9, 26]","The writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs have greatly influenced sci-fi over the last 100 years. With John Carter the long road of taking the series of novels to the big screen has finally been realized. The result is a decidedly mixed bag and one that won't exactly hold direct appeal to any particular age or demographic.Based on the first novel ""A Princess of Mars"" the story centers on John Carter who finds himself transported to Barsoom (Mars) where he becomes involved in a war between factions on the planet. While he has little interest in taking sides he eventually forms allegiances while attempting to find his way back home.The film starts on Earth and really struggles there. The scenes are dull and the relevance of them are totally unclear. Once on Barsoom it begins to get more interesting though even then the sense of discovery isn't as compelling as would have been anticipated. Eventually the action picks up, the story gets its hooks in, and improvement comes through the second half of the movie which delivers a surprisingly strong conclusion considering the earlier struggles in getting the audience emotionally involved.While that sense of discovery is lacking there is feeling of wonder and imagination that shines through. Given that the source material is so old it doesn't always translate well but that forward-looking nature is easily identified. There are some decent laughs to be had but it's generally focused on providing adventure and it does a sufficient job of that.The special effects are suitable when keeping in mind that they're trying to convey scenes written 100 years ago and that means they won't always come across as realistic as one would imagine now. Outside of that though the alien creatures look great. The 3D is ultimately unnecessary - adding some depth to scenes but otherwise not enhancing the experience significantly.Despite some dreadful spots - which early in the film include jarring scene transitions - somehow I ended up enjoying the film as a whole. It's a tough one to recommend, and I suspect there will be opinions that stretch completely across the board, but there is a unique nature about it that struck me as being commendable. As an origin story John Carter struggles to gain traction but eventually shows some promise which would bode well for any possible sequels to come.",3,High on adventure but ultimately low on appeal.,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,2344,"['writings', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'have', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'sci-fi', 'last', '100', 'years', 'John', 'Carter', 'long', 'road', 'taking', 'series', 'novels', 'big', 'screen', 'finally', 'been', 'realized', 'result', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'bag', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hold', 'direct', 'appeal', 'particular', 'age', 'demographic.Based', 'first', 'novel', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'story', 'centers', 'John', 'Carter', 'who', 'transported', 'Barsoom', 'Mars', 'where', 'involved', 'war', 'factions', 'planet', 'little', 'interest', 'taking', 'sides', 'eventually', 'allegiances', 'attempting', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'home.The', 'film', 'starts', 'Earth', 'really', 'struggles', 'there', 'scenes', 'are', 'dull', 'relevance', 'are', 'totally', 'unclear', 'Once', 'Barsoom', 'get', 'more', 'interesting', 'even', 'then', 'sense', 'discovery', ""n't"", 'as', 'compelling', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'anticipated', 'Eventually', 'action', 'up', 'story', 'hooks', 'improvement', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'conclusion', 'considering', 'earlier', 'struggles', 'getting', 'audience', 'emotionally', 'involved.While', 'sense', 'discovery', 'lacking', 'feeling', 'wonder', 'imagination', 'Given', 'source', 'material', 'so', 'old', ""n't"", 'always', 'translate', 'well', 'forward-looking', 'nature', 'easily', 'identified', 'are', 'decent', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'generally', 'focused', 'providing', 'adventure', 'sufficient', 'job', 'that.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'suitable', 'when', 'keeping', 'mind', ""'re"", 'trying', 'convey', 'scenes', 'written', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'wo', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'as', 'realistic', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'now', 'alien', 'creatures', 'look', 'great', '3D', 'ultimately', 'unnecessary', 'adding', 'depth', 'scenes', 'otherwise', 'not', 'enhancing', 'experience', 'significantly.Despite', 'dreadful', 'spots', 'early', 'film', 'include', 'jarring', 'scene', 'transitions', 'somehow', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'film', 'whole', 'tough', 'one', 'recommend', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'opinions', 'stretch', 'completely', 'board', 'unique', 'nature', 'struck', 'being', 'commendable', 'origin', 'story', 'John', 'Carter', 'gain', 'traction', 'eventually', 'promise', 'would', 'bode', 'well', 'possible', 'sequels', 'come']",N/A

Another won't mean that much. I have been waiting 50 years for this movie to come out and I, personally, was not disappointed one bit, despite some of the changes the writers/director made to the original story. In some instances, such as the increased fleshing out (no pun intended about the luscious Lynn Collins) of the character of Dejah Thoris from helpless princess to a more well rounded female personality, was a well founded idea and is proabably (again with the help of Ms Collins exceptional acting ability) part of the reason why everyone who raves about this movie really does so. As so many have said, she stole the movie from Taylor Kitsch. In the scene where he finally realizes he is on Mars, her superior acting ability makes him look superfluous to the scene, unfortunately for him. Don't get me wrong, I think he did a good job for his first starring role, but when placed next to a more seasoned actor such Ms. Collins or even Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas, he sadly loses out. I STILL LOVED this movie though, beginning to end.Now, the marketing campaign. I have heard that marketing heads have rolled as a result of the botched effort on this movie. As they should have. From the minute they decided to change the name from John Carter of Mars to just John Carter, it has been a marketing disaster. Several fan made trailers have made their rounds on the internet that did a MUCH better job of describing the story and marketing this movie than the so called professionals ever thought of. I don't know if the people in marketing put the fear of ""Prince of Persia"" into Andrew Stanton's head,and this was part of his reasoning for some of the changes, but I feel he bears some of the blame himself. Not for the movie. His movie is magnificent and I really wish there would be the sequels of Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars, but just how everyone handled the selling of the movie. It saddened me so much to see only 4-5 people in the movie theater with me when it should have been packed.

This suggests only the live action was converted.First, the parallax 3D (the layers of objects and the depth between them) is top notch here. The different characters really stand out strongly from foreground and background. If you value clearly separate layers of depth in your 3D movie, this one delivers throughout from beginning to end on an impressive level. The characters themselves also show good volume, so they are not flat cardboard cutouts. That's important.Next, the depth reaching into the screen, is also present. You can look far into the screen without any trouble.As far as pop out (objects moving outside the screen towards you), there are a few nice pop out moments here or there, but mostly, the film keeps things within the confines of the screen.3D Layers: 9/103D Depth: 8/103D Pop Out 5/103D OVERALL: 9/10 (not an average).

1468332,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B005LAIH2W,Ranny Levy,"[3, 5]","One of our youth film critics reviewed this and here is what she had to say:From Disney's latest 250 million dollar film comes the exhilarating 3-D adventure of John Carter. This movie is based on the first out of eleventh novel of the series Princess of Mars, written about a century ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this film, John Carter is a Civil War veteran who finds a medallion that teleports him to Mars. There, he makes allies and foes with the aliens he encounters and falls in love with the princess of Helium. At the same time, massive war is occurring between the aliens so Mars is in a chaotic state, and there is also an antagonist who tries to use schemes to put Carter back on Earth. Can John Carter manage to stay with his princess despite these obstacles?Writer and director Andrew Stanton wrote the magnificent screenplays for Toy Story 1, 2, and 3, Wall-E, and Finding Nemo, but John Carter is not one of his best works. Some parts are not well rendered and a bit corny, but I did enjoy the ending of the film because it's interesting and unpredictable, and I am sure this movie will become very popular. I also liked the main theme of the movie regarding to cultural differences. The movie shows how different the norms and appearances are for aliens on Mars compared to people on Earth, yet it is universal for both life forms to have good intentions.The CGI animation is also impressive, for it details even on the smallest of aspects. Its vividness combined with the 3-D makes the movie pop to life, particularly during the action scenes. The CGI animation is very compatible with movies such as Avatar and Planet of the Apes. The cinematography is also beautiful since the landscape of the film is set in the desert, which makes the movie more interesting to me since I rarely see action scenes occur in such an isolated, dry, and hot place.As for the actors, all of them performed their roles well, but I think Taylor Kitsch was especially well suited to his heroic character John Carter.I recommend this movie to teens 13 and older because there are a few violent scenes. The movie is a great family film, especially for tweens and some teens. Overall, the movie is an entertaining cinematic experience. There are a myriad of action scenes and the entire film is in 3-D, which adds a lot of depth making the movie seem realistic. You will definitely be thrilled if you're into science fiction movies and video games. Reviewed by Gabriella C, KIDS FIRST!

But let me first say the movie is fantastic. It really its a shame for it to be a flop at the box office because it makes people think it sucks when it doesn't. The story of John Carter being teleported to Mars is interesting enough to keep you hooked all the way through, with enough action to satisfy. But it's not perfect. I'll be the first to defend this movie but I will make fun of it right after. First of all, the Princess is a joke though at times I found her to be a definitive competent heroine. But she's bound by the Disney cliches such as ""I can't marry the Evil Man, I don't love him!"" Been there, done that, and even John Carter himself pokes fun at the cliche by saying ""Is that all there is?"" So points to the movie by addressing the cliches it creates and that's nice. I like how the movie becomes aware of the cliches and will even crack jokes about it. It's not a comedy by any means but the comic relief is nice. But the Princess really did annoy me at times.Overall this movie should have been a success but ultimately it was a gamble that didn't pay off. Evidently it cost $250 Million with another $100 Million for marketing to make this movie. And I'll be honest folks, I have no idea where that money went. I saw it and yes the special effects were nice but they weren't $250 MILLION nice. And how they did the marketing, I don't know. I only saw the trailer by chance and no one in my family even heard about it. Let alone anyone at work. So the movie was overblown and under-marketed. Add that to the obscure source material and no name actors (besides Mark Strong and Willem Defoue) and you've got a movie that is so desperate to make its money that we can now pre-order the Blu-ray not even a month from its original release.And it's a shame, because this movie WAS good! But, too much of ""this"" and ""that"" ultimately added to what financially is described as a ""Flop"".The Box Art doesn't help either. I mean what an unappealing picture is that. It's too much and at the same time too bland. Yellow bold text on an orange/blue background with white blind apes, and two pics of John Carter. This should have been way more subtle. They should have just taken the wallpaper of the bold orange background and near-silhouette John Carter and just slapped in on the box.So again, good movie with great action and decent plot, but unfortunately not only did it fail to make a profit, but now it's got a Box Art that is unlikely to make you interested.",4,"Love the Movie, Hate the Box Art",1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,2618,"['should', 'be', 'giving', 'one', 'star', 'box', 'art', 'like', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'affect', 'rating', 'negatively', 'let', 'first', 'say', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'really', 'shame', 'be', 'flop', 'box', 'office', 'people', 'think', 'when', ""n't"", 'story', 'John', 'Carter', 'being', 'teleported', 'Mars', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'hooked', 'way', 'enough', 'action', 'satisfy', 'not', 'perfect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'defend', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'fun', 'right', 'First', 'all', 'Princess', 'joke', 'times', 'found', 'be', 'definitive', 'competent', 'heroine', 'bound', 'Disney', 'cliches', 'such', 'ca', ""n't"", 'marry', 'Evil', 'Man', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'Been', 'there', 'done', 'even', 'John', 'Carter', 'fun', 'cliche', 'saying', 'So', 'movie', 'addressing', 'cliches', 'nice', 'how', 'movie', 'aware', 'cliches', 'will', 'even', 'crack', 'jokes', 'not', 'comedy', 'means', 'comic', 'relief', 'nice', 'Princess', 'really', 'did', 'annoy', 'times.Overall', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'success', 'ultimately', 'was', 'gamble', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'Evidently', 'cost', '250', 'Million', '100', 'Million', 'marketing', 'make', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'folks', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'money', 'went', 'saw', 'yes', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'nice', 'were', ""n't"", '250', 'MILLION', 'nice', 'how', 'did', 'marketing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'only', 'saw', 'trailer', 'chance', 'one', 'family', 'even', 'heard', 'Let', 'alone', 'anyone', 'work', 'movie', 'was', 'overblown', 'under-marketed', 'Add', 'obscure', 'source', 'material', 'name', 'actors', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Willem', 'Defoue', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'so', 'desperate', 'make', 'money', 'can', 'now', 'pre-order', 'Blu-ray', 'not', 'even', 'month', 'original', 'release.And', 'shame', 'movie', 'WAS', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'ultimately', 'added', 'what', 'financially', 'described', 'Flop', '.The', 'Box', 'Art', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'mean', 'what', 'unappealing', 'picture', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'time', 'too', 'bland', 'Yellow', 'bold', 'text', 'orange/blue', 'background', 'white', 'blind', 'apes', 'two', 'pics', 'John', 'Carter', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'more', 'subtle', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'taken', 'wallpaper', 'bold', 'orange', 'background', 'near-silhouette', 'John', 'Carter', 'just', 'slapped', 'box.So', 'again', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'action', 'decent', 'plot', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'fail', 'make', 'profit', 'now', 'got', 'Box', 'Art', 'unlikely', 'make', 'interested']",N/A

The acting was good -- in fact, there were some top-shelf actors here I had no idea were going to be in it, like James Purefoy and Ciaran Hinds, who was Caesar in the wonderful Showtime series, Rome, and the leads, Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins, were excellent as well. There were a few good laughs (""I'm getting away!""), some romance, lots of adventure. I think this could have been a big hit in the US for Disney if they advertised it differently. First of all, from the TV ads and movie previews I saw, I had no idea that John Carter started out as a Civil War soldier. That added an important dimension to his character. Why they would leave that out of the ads and promo, I have no idea. They could have riffed on the Cowboys and Aliens theme and done a much, much better job of promoting John Carter.

And If I know the material I'm even worse. The formula for what works for me is simple: don't treat me like an idiot and I might like your film. I'm not an art snob.That said I did NOT have any hope for this film. The fact is I've grown to loathe Hollywood's attempts at adapting good pulp writing to film. Few exceptions are made to this well established, personal outlook because I honestly think that Hollywood's efforts to own the material starts with denigrating it. Then they try to build it up by modernizing things or making them more and often even less logical than the stories they're adapting.This film is certainly guilty of that. However, this time the evident contempt was left out. Yes, it's a bit modernized but not in any bad way. The story is a bit more layered than the original and of course nothing in the character's motives remain intact from the original story but the character ARE sincere, at least as much as they are in the book without being embarrassing.This is not my John Carter, but he is a close cousin and that was enjoyable enough for me.Taylor Kitsch as John Carter and especially Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris make these characters come alive in ways I did not expect. No, this john Carter makes no mention of his inability to remember his past or how old he is. This guy is a likable character driven at first by his being sick of war and the process of war. He wants wealth and place to get away from his past. Well, he gets his second wish.-As a side note I like this take on Carter even though I miss the ageless man, the warrior. However given our nation's constant state of war I'm not sure we would sympathize with Burrough's Carter who is described as grinning when he engages his enemies in bloodletting. Burroughs thought that war was noble, that it made a man of you. Later in his life as a war correspondent and seeing the travails of war he no longer clung to naive notions of war's nobler virtues. So, this is essential a Carter from that older writer's perspective-Collin's Dejah is a woman of conscience, a princess who now is also a scientist but also willing to endure a lot to save her people and her father's kingdom though that price is very steep. The original Dejah is also very loyal to her people, her city and her father. So, some change but not a facelift or even disdain, just a more humanized take on both characters.This is growing long but suffice it to say I liked it. I not only liked it I did something I almost never do for a SF/Fantasy film; I endorsed it and even argued with my illustrator/comic artists peers over how good it was. Normally we're very much in agreement but here we had to agree to disagree in a big way.One last thing, I also have come to be very disappointed with FX. This film has turned me around on the use of digital FX. The use of digital affects is used so seamlessly utilized in both settings (beautifully rugged Utah!) and in the characters like the Tharks (they look feel and act so much like they're real it's easy to believe it) are the best use of digital animation I've ever seen. The way they each have individual character, with little mannerisms, speech patterns and facial tics makes them as real as they can be. And the ruin of ancient, dying Barsoom can be felt and seen.Needless to say, all my reservations are on vacation from my usual cynicism. This film gives me hope and I know no one will agree but considering all the crap it takes to get a film like this made, well, I won't disparage the cost it took to make it. I won't say everyone will like this film. There is the hope that many more viewers will ignore the negative campaign to derail this effort and give it a chance.",4,Almost 5 stars but still a far better film than expected,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3793,"['Anyone', 'who', 'considers', 'crank', 'curmudgeon', 'when', 'SF', 'fantasy', 'film', 'fare', 'know', 'material', ""'m"", 'even', 'worse', 'formula', 'what', 'simple', 'do', ""n't"", 'treat', 'idiot', 'might', 'like', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'art', 'snob.That', 'said', 'did', 'NOT', 'have', 'hope', 'film', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'loathe', 'Hollywood', 'attempts', 'adapting', 'good', 'pulp', 'writing', 'film', 'Few', 'exceptions', 'are', 'made', 'well', 'established', 'personal', 'outlook', 'honestly', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'efforts', 'own', 'material', 'denigrating', 'Then', 'try', 'build', 'up', 'modernizing', 'things', 'making', 'more', 'often', 'even', 'less', 'logical', 'stories', ""'re"", 'adapting.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'guilty', 'However', 'time', 'evident', 'contempt', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'Yes', 'bit', 'modernized', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'story', 'bit', 'more', 'layered', 'original', 'course', 'nothing', 'character', 'motives', 'remain', 'intact', 'original', 'story', 'character', 'ARE', 'sincere', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'book', 'being', 'embarrassing.This', 'not', 'John', 'Carter', 'close', 'cousin', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'me.Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'John', 'Carter', 'especially', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'make', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'ways', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'No', 'john', 'Carter', 'mention', 'inability', 'remember', 'past', 'how', 'old', 'guy', 'likable', 'character', 'driven', 'first', 'being', 'sick', 'war', 'process', 'war', 'wealth', 'place', 'get', 'away', 'past', 'Well', 'second', 'wish.-As', 'side', 'note', 'take', 'Carter', 'even', 'miss', 'ageless', 'man', 'warrior', 'However', 'given', 'nation', 'constant', 'state', 'war', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'sympathize', 'Burrough', 'Carter', 'who', 'described', 'grinning', 'when', 'enemies', 'bloodletting', 'Burroughs', 'thought', 'war', 'was', 'noble', 'made', 'man', 'Later', 'life', 'war', 'correspondent', 'seeing', 'travails', 'war', 'no', 'longer', 'clung', 'naive', 'notions', 'war', 'nobler', 'virtues', 'So', 'essential', 'Carter', 'older', 'writer', 'perspective-Collin', 'Dejah', 'woman', 'conscience', 'princess', 'who', 'now', 'also', 'scientist', 'also', 'willing', 'endure', 'lot', 'save', 'people', 'father', 'kingdom', 'price', 'very', 'steep', 'original', 'Dejah', 'also', 'very', 'loyal', 'people', 'city', 'father', 'So', 'change', 'not', 'facelift', 'even', 'disdain', 'just', 'more', 'humanized', 'take', 'characters.This', 'growing', 'long', 'say', 'liked', 'not', 'only', 'liked', 'did', 'something', 'almost', 'never', 'do', 'SF/Fantasy', 'film', 'endorsed', 'even', 'argued', 'illustrator/comic', 'artists', 'peers', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'Normally', ""'re"", 'very', 'much', 'agreement', 'here', 'had', 'agree', 'disagree', 'big', 'way.One', 'last', 'thing', 'also', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'FX', 'film', 'turned', 'use', 'digital', 'FX', 'use', 'digital', 'affects', 'used', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'utilized', 'settings', 'beautifully', 'rugged', 'Utah', 'characters', 'Tharks', 'look', 'feel', 'act', 'so', 'much', ""'re"", 'real', 'easy', 'believe', 'are', 'best', 'use', 'digital', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'way', 'have', 'individual', 'character', 'little', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'patterns', 'facial', 'tics', 'as', 'real', 'can', 'be', 'ruin', 'ancient', 'dying', 'Barsoom', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'seen.Needless', 'say', 'reservations', 'are', 'vacation', 'usual', 'cynicism', 'film', 'hope', 'know', 'one', 'will', 'agree', 'considering', 'crap', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disparage', 'cost', 'took', 'make', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'hope', 'many', 'more', 'viewers', 'will', 'ignore', 'negative', 'campaign', 'derail', 'effort', 'give', 'chance']",N/A
1468345,A3IJ3AEFKL4EWG,B005LAIH2W,"Richard Brookes ""Rumpled Writer""","[3, 4]","A film destined to be a cult classic.Let's go back to 1877 when Giovanni Schiaparelli ""discovered"" canali on Mars.  Misinterpreting the word to mean canals, popular writers and even scientists around the world began to think in terms of life, intelligent life, on Mars.  Life that could build huge, planet spanning canals to bring water to the arid desert of the planet.  Another astronomer, Percival Lowell, took up the baton and began to observe Mars in earnest and for years before and after the turn of the 20th century, speculated on the probability of life, life that he thought could be intelligent.  In the meantime, H.G. Wells penned a novel about invasion from Mars.  ""War of the Worlds"" became a best seller and inspired a huge outpouring of fiction about Mars.  Edgar Rice Burroughs added to the fictional Mars accounts with ""Princess of Mars,"" which was so popular it spawned eleven sequels with the same principal characters, John Carter and Princess Dejah Thoris.Mars had caught the public fancy and the love affair of the public with Mars has hardly abated even to the present day.  Burroughs's Mars is a wonderful place.  In 1917, when ""Princess"" was penned, flying machines were rare on Earth.  But they were already being prepped for war.  Burroughs caught on to this and made the Martian fliers fabulous weapons.  And ""fabulous"" is a key word here.  Burroughs wrote a fantasy, not a science fiction novel.  He was aware of the fact that gravity on Mars is only slightly more than a third of that on Earth and therefore gave John Carter leaping ability... but way more than the lesser gravity would actually allow.  He is almost a superman on Mars.Burroughs's novel was written near the end of the Edwardian era.  War clouds had precipitated actual conflict and the war was on everyone's mind.  There was war on Mars, of course. But the book is an Edwardian romance with beautiful women rewarding heroes with their favors.The plot of the movie, though it does not track exactly with the story of ""Princess of Mars,"" actually captures the atmosphere and essence of Burroughs's so perfectly it is impossible to find fault.  The story is Burroughs.  The characters are exactly what Burroughs delineated in his novels and they are well played. His wonderful tharks look exactly as the reader envisions.  The flying machines are insect-like and adapted to the Martian gravity.  They ride on sunbeams (solar power?).  For anyone enthralled with Burroughs's stories, the movie is so evocative, it renews your sense of wonder.For anyone not familiar with Burroughs's novels, come with me back to 1917 and experience the world that Burroughs saw in his mind's eye.  Visit Mars of that era with its canals and old civilizations, a dying world of turmoil and danger, needing a hero from Earth to make things straight and to win the heart of the Martian princess.  A great and splendorous film and one to enjoy many times.",5,"Splendorous, Magnificent Film Fantasy",1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,2929,"['film', 'destined', 'be', 'cult', 'classic.Let', 'go', 'back', '1877', 'when', 'Giovanni', 'Schiaparelli', 'discovered', 'canali', 'Mars', 'Misinterpreting', 'word', 'mean', 'canals', 'popular', 'writers', 'even', 'scientists', 'world', 'began', 'think', 'terms', 'life', 'intelligent', 'life', 'Mars', 'Life', 'could', 'build', 'huge', 'planet', 'spanning', 'canals', 'bring', 'water', 'arid', 'desert', 'planet', 'astronomer', 'Percival', 'Lowell', 'took', 'up', 'baton', 'began', 'observe', 'Mars', 'earnest', 'years', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'speculated', 'probability', 'life', 'life', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'intelligent', 'meantime', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'penned', 'novel', 'invasion', 'Mars', 'War', 'Worlds', 'became', 'best', 'seller', 'inspired', 'huge', 'outpouring', 'fiction', 'Mars', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'added', 'fictional', 'Mars', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'spawned', 'eleven', 'sequels', 'same', 'principal', 'characters', 'John', 'Carter', 'Princess', 'Dejah', 'Thoris.Mars', 'had', 'caught', 'public', 'fancy', 'love', 'affair', 'public', 'Mars', 'hardly', 'abated', 'even', 'present', 'day', 'Burroughs', 'Mars', 'wonderful', 'place', '1917', 'when', 'Princess', 'was', 'penned', 'flying', 'machines', 'were', 'rare', 'Earth', 'were', 'already', 'being', 'prepped', 'war', 'Burroughs', 'caught', 'made', 'Martian', 'fliers', 'fabulous', 'weapons', 'fabulous', 'key', 'word', 'here', 'Burroughs', 'wrote', 'fantasy', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'was', 'aware', 'fact', 'gravity', 'Mars', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'third', 'Earth', 'therefore', 'gave', 'John', 'Carter', 'leaping', 'ability', 'way', 'more', 'lesser', 'gravity', 'would', 'actually', 'allow', 'almost', 'superman', 'Mars.Burroughs', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'end', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'War', 'clouds', 'had', 'precipitated', 'actual', 'conflict', 'war', 'was', 'everyone', 'mind', 'was', 'war', 'Mars', 'course', 'book', 'Edwardian', 'romance', 'beautiful', 'women', 'rewarding', 'heroes', 'favors.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'not', 'track', 'exactly', 'story', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'actually', 'atmosphere', 'essence', 'Burroughs', 'so', 'perfectly', 'impossible', 'find', 'fault', 'story', 'Burroughs', 'characters', 'are', 'exactly', 'what', 'Burroughs', 'delineated', 'novels', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'wonderful', 'tharks', 'look', 'exactly', 'reader', 'envisions', 'flying', 'machines', 'are', 'insect-like', 'adapted', 'Martian', 'gravity', 'ride', 'sunbeams', 'solar', 'power', 'anyone', 'enthralled', 'Burroughs', 'stories', 'movie', 'so', 'evocative', 'sense', 'wonder.For', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'Burroughs', 'novels', 'come', 'back', '1917', 'experience', 'world', 'Burroughs', 'saw', 'mind', 'eye', 'Visit', 'Mars', 'era', 'canals', 'old', 'civilizations', 'dying', 'world', 'turmoil', 'danger', 'needing', 'hero', 'Earth', 'make', 'things', 'straight', 'win', 'heart', 'Martian', 'princess', 'great', 'splendorous', 'film', 'one', 'enjoy', 'many', 'times']",N/A

After watching it after the fact, I wish I would have seen it in 3D. It brings to life one of the classic SF pulp series, with an ""everyman"" protagonist (John Carter) and a believable supporting cast of aliens, humanoids, machines and landscapes. Watching the first five minutes of John Carter when he's on Mars, you'll find yourself thinking ""So that's where the idea of Superman came from!""This movie was a treat to watch, and one I'll undoubtedly view many more times, James Cameron admits that the John Carter books were his inspiration for Avatar, and after watching this movie, you can see where the books have impacted SF for generations. Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing his Barsoom stories in 1912, at the height of the Mars hysteria. He envisioned ships that sail on light (solar powered aircraft), Astral Projection and more. His scientific ideas, like those of Jules Verne, were considered outlandish. Today, they are almost a reality.Do yourself (and the studio!) a favor and get this movie. It will make a great addition to any SF collection! No, it's not that true to the books - they were more of an inspiration. Carter's leaping ability and strength are over exaggerated, and the other races changed significantly. If Disney would have left some of these aspects, I'm sure the movie would have done much better.

1468347,A2EW96AE53PZMK,B005LAIH2W,Richard De Angelis,"[13, 13]","One of my favorite movies in nearly 50 years of film-watching. Since first catching John Carter on Starz a few months ago, and then buying the Blu-ray, I have watched this movie at least a half dozen times, growing more captivated by it with each viewing. It is a great adventure, lovingly made, beautifully realized, and full of the action and romance of the pulp stories that inspired it. Based on the 1912 story by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, who is considered the grandfather of American science fiction, directors and studios have struggled throughout the last century to bring this epic tale to the big screen. Everything from Flash Gordon, to Star Wars to Avatar was directly inspired or influenced by John Carter's escapades on Mars (or Barsoom as it's called by the natives), but it wasn't until the once science fiction setting of 2011 that computer technology finally caught up to Burroughs'  prolific imagination, making it possible to bring his amazing otherworldly cities, creatures and flying ships to vivid life.As breathtaking and essential to the story as the special effects are, it was Academy Award-winner Andrew Stanton's direction, and the performances of the cast (including the CGI ones) that made me fall in love with this movie. For me, the heart of the film is the impossible yet destined romance between wayward Virginia cavalryman John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) and his literal star-crossed lover, the Martian princess, scientist and swordswoman, Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). The performances of and chemistry between Kitsch and Collins are so convincing I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. And the thousands of green-skinned, nine-foot-tall, four-armed Martian Tharks who make up most of the supporting cast are just as convincing, even though they exist entirely as digital pixels. The only thing that kept me from believing that they were real is the knowledge that they can't be, and the motion-captured performances of the major Thark actors (Willem DaFoe, Thomas Haden Church, Samantha Morton and Polly Walker) convey as much emotion and character as any of their corporeal co-stars. This also goes for Woola, the Martian doglike callot, who quickly becomes Carter's faithful best friend and protector.My only criticism of the movie is the five minute prologue, which I feel takes away from the wonder of Carter's initial Martian journey as it was presented by Burroughs (to rectify this, I recommend starting the movie from scene two, which is when the opening title credit appears). It was mainly for this reason that I was going to give John Carter only four stars, until I realized that the last five minutes--which I consider one of the greatest movie endings in film history--totally offsets the deficit of the awkward beginning.Regrettably, I missed John Carter when it was in theaters, having been unduly influenced by undeservedly negative reviews from members of the film industry press who deemed the movie a critical and financial failure--almost entirely as a result of Disney's incomprehensible and incompetent marketing decisions (such as dropping ""of Mars"" from the title) and false reports of skyrocketing production costs (for more on Disney's marketing debacle, read Michael D. Sellers' excellent expos&eacute;,John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood).Fortunately, John Carter has found a second life and a growing fan following through people viewing it on television, computer and tablet, who are as mystified as I am at how so many critics could fail to appreciate this movie's many charms.  Hopefully, as more and more people give this film the chance it deserves, that fan following will eventually reach a critical mass, and those of us who didn't make it last time will get a second opportunity to see Barsoom on the big screen in a John Carter sequel.",5,100 years in the making worth the wait,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,3831,"['One', 'favorite', 'movies', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'film-watching', 'first', 'catching', 'John', 'Carter', 'Starz', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'then', 'buying', 'Blu-ray', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'growing', 'more', 'captivated', 'viewing', 'great', 'adventure', 'lovingly', 'made', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'full', 'action', 'romance', 'pulp', 'stories', 'inspired', 'Based', '1912', 'story', 'Tarzan', 'creator', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'who', 'considered', 'grandfather', 'American', 'science', 'fiction', 'directors', 'studios', 'have', 'struggled', 'last', 'century', 'bring', 'epic', 'tale', 'big', 'screen', 'Everything', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Avatar', 'was', 'directly', 'inspired', 'influenced', 'John', 'Carter', 'escapades', 'Mars', 'Barsoom', 'called', 'natives', 'was', ""n't"", 'once', 'science', 'fiction', 'setting', '2011', 'computer', 'technology', 'finally', 'caught', 'up', 'Burroughs', 'prolific', 'imagination', 'making', 'possible', 'bring', 'amazing', 'otherworldly', 'cities', 'creatures', 'flying', 'ships', 'vivid', 'life.As', 'breathtaking', 'essential', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'was', 'Academy', 'Award-winner', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'direction', 'performances', 'cast', 'including', 'CGI', 'ones', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'heart', 'film', 'impossible', 'yet', 'destined', 'romance', 'wayward', 'Virginia', 'cavalryman', 'John', 'Carter', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'literal', 'star-crossed', 'lover', 'Martian', 'princess', 'scientist', 'swordswoman', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'performances', 'chemistry', 'Kitsch', 'Collins', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'roles', 'thousands', 'green-skinned', 'nine-foot-tall', 'four-armed', 'Martian', 'Tharks', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'just', 'convincing', 'even', 'exist', 'entirely', 'digital', 'pixels', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'believing', 'were', 'real', 'knowledge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'motion-captured', 'performances', 'major', 'Thark', 'actors', 'Willem', 'DaFoe', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'convey', 'as', 'much', 'emotion', 'character', 'corporeal', 'co-stars', 'also', 'Woola', 'Martian', 'doglike', 'callot', 'who', 'quickly', 'Carter', 'faithful', 'best', 'friend', 'protector.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'movie', 'five', 'minute', 'prologue', 'feel', 'away', 'wonder', 'Carter', 'initial', 'Martian', 'journey', 'was', 'presented', 'Burroughs', 'rectify', 'recommend', 'starting', 'movie', 'scene', 'two', 'when', 'opening', 'title', 'credit', 'was', 'mainly', 'reason', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'John', 'Carter', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'realized', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'consider', 'one', 'greatest', 'movie', 'endings', 'film', 'history', 'totally', 'deficit', 'awkward', 'beginning.Regrettably', 'missed', 'John', 'Carter', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'having', 'been', 'unduly', 'influenced', 'undeservedly', 'negative', 'reviews', 'members', 'film', 'industry', 'press', 'who', 'deemed', 'movie', 'critical', 'financial', 'failure', 'almost', 'entirely', 'result', 'Disney', 'incomprehensible', 'incompetent', 'marketing', 'decisions', 'such', 'dropping', 'Mars', 'title', 'false', 'reports', 'skyrocketing', 'production', 'costs', 'more', 'Disney', 'marketing', 'debacle', 'read', 'Michael', 'D.', 'Sellers', 'excellent', 'expos', 'eacute', 'John', 'Carter', 'Gods', 'Hollywood', '.Fortunately', 'John', 'Carter', 'found', 'second', 'life', 'growing', 'fan', 'following', 'people', 'viewing', 'television', 'computer', 'tablet', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'mystified', 'am', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'could', 'fail', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'many', 'charms', 'Hopefully', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'fan', 'following', 'will', 'eventually', 'reach', 'critical', 'mass', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'last', 'time', 'will', 'get', 'second', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Barsoom', 'big', 'screen', 'John', 'Carter', 'sequel']",N/A

1468354,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B005LAIH2W,RJ Smoove,"[5, 6]","It's a shame the fate this film suffered at the hands of the terrible marketing team Disney hired for this mo allowed to cut the trailers together, and the incredibly bland, generically boring title they decided to go with. Why they chose ""John Carter"" over the original novel's title ""A Princess of Mars"", or even the original film title they were planning to go with, ""John Carter of Mars"" is beyond me. This is the definition of one you have to see it for yourself, because audience interest never piqued for it, and critical reception was fairly split. It truly is a great movie, in my opinion. The pros far outweigh the cons. Biggest flaws were that some stuff, primarily dialogue, was a bit cliche and corny. The story itself has been done and done again. A soldier travels to a distant land, joins the natives, and helps them defeat an overwhelming enemy. That plot should not, and honestly cannot, be held against this film due to the simple fact that the novel is a hundred years old, and was probably one of the pioneers of that story template. Simplified is a perfect way to describe the script, but not too simple. It's depth is more than sufficient. The characters are unique and delightful. Woola is adorable, despite his ugly appearance.I have to say I was quite surprised and happy to see Bryan Cranston in his brief part. Some of the lead performances may be a little stiff, per se, mainly Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins. They have their high points, but overall, I felt they were a tad stiff. Taylor Kitsch, although I don't feel sorry for him if studios invested too much in him as a leading man, I have to say I am a little sorry that he had two major studio blockbuster flops within a span of three months. Lynn Collins is a beauty though, so in a way I can forgive her hiccups. Willem Dafoe and Thomas Hayden Church were great in their voiceover roles. Mark Strong played Mark Strong, or in other words, another intimidatingly intellectual villain. The Blu-ray is a nice, if slightly lacking, package. The extras are scarce, but the transfer is top notch. There is a director's commentary, which tends to be my favorite feature, and a short historical doc, on top of a few other minor things. Overall, it was satisfyingly action packed (in a story-driven way), funny at times, and it should make for one hell of a blockbuster if the marketing doesn't damn it. I recommend it.Note: I cannot currently watch the 3D disc, but I reviewed the 3D combo pack because that's the edition that I bought (for the digital copy).",4,100 Years in the Making,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2538,"['shame', 'fate', 'film', 'suffered', 'hands', 'terrible', 'marketing', 'team', 'Disney', 'hired', 'mo', 'allowed', 'cut', 'trailers', 'together', 'incredibly', 'bland', 'generically', 'boring', 'title', 'decided', 'go', 'Why', 'chose', 'John', 'Carter', 'original', 'novel', 'title', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'even', 'original', 'film', 'title', 'were', 'planning', 'go', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'definition', 'one', 'have', 'see', 'audience', 'interest', 'never', 'piqued', 'critical', 'reception', 'was', 'fairly', 'split', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'opinion', 'pros', 'far', 'cons', 'Biggest', 'flaws', 'were', 'stuff', 'primarily', 'dialogue', 'was', 'bit', 'cliche', 'corny', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'done', 'again', 'soldier', 'travels', 'distant', 'land', 'natives', 'defeat', 'overwhelming', 'enemy', 'plot', 'should', 'not', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'held', 'film', 'due', 'simple', 'fact', 'novel', 'hundred', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'pioneers', 'story', 'template', 'Simplified', 'perfect', 'way', 'describe', 'script', 'not', 'too', 'simple', 'depth', 'more', 'sufficient', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'delightful', 'Woola', 'adorable', 'ugly', 'appearance.I', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'happy', 'see', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'brief', 'part', 'lead', 'performances', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'stiff', 'se', 'mainly', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'have', 'high', 'points', 'overall', 'felt', 'were', 'tad', 'stiff', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'studios', 'invested', 'too', 'much', 'leading', 'man', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'little', 'sorry', 'had', 'two', 'major', 'studio', 'blockbuster', 'flops', 'span', 'three', 'months', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'beauty', 'so', 'way', 'can', 'forgive', 'hiccups', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'were', 'great', 'voiceover', 'roles', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'played', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'other', 'words', 'intimidatingly', 'intellectual', 'villain', 'Blu-ray', 'nice', 'slightly', 'lacking', 'package', 'extras', 'are', 'scarce', 'transfer', 'top', 'notch', 'director', 'commentary', 'be', 'favorite', 'feature', 'short', 'historical', 'doc', 'top', 'few', 'other', 'minor', 'things', 'Overall', 'was', 'satisfyingly', 'action', 'packed', 'story-driven', 'way', 'funny', 'times', 'should', 'make', 'one', 'hell', 'blockbuster', 'marketing', ""n't"", 'damn', 'recommend', 'it.Note', 'can', 'not', 'currently', 'watch', '3D', 'disc', 'reviewed', '3D', 'combo', 'pack', 'edition', 'bought', 'digital', 'copy']",N/A

The retrofitted 3D wasn't terribly bad, though there were scenes where I could remove the 3D glasses and not notice much difference.  Still, the 3D did enhance the movie.Now for the bad.  The leading actor and actress were just bad.  He actually only did one scene in the movie where I actually gave a damn about the character ( where his finding his home burned and family dead, on Earth, interspersed with a somewhat overdone battle scene on Barsoom).

you will see a film here that thinks epic but fails,because of its over attention to detail and the inordinate amount of time it takes to tell this enormous tale(I found myself clock watching numerous times-never a good sign).This story ideally would have been better off told in segments ala Star Wars.Edgar Rice Burroughs original stories really deserve a more detailed look filmicly speaking.The story starts out with Carter,a former Confederate soldier and now seeming archeologist,dodging someone on his tail to send a telegram.Next thing we know he is dead and his  nephew Edgar(as in E.R.Burroughs)is attending the reading of the will.His uncle is entombed in a crypt that can only be opened from the inside`,and much of the estate money will go to see that it is never disturbed.First off Edgar reads his uncles diary which begins back in the late 1800s in the Arizona territory(which in turn begins the main Carter storyline).He is there searching for a legendary cave of gold,which he eventually finds.However a strange being beams into the cave and the two struggle.With his dying breath the being utters some strange wording and a medallion that Carter picked out of his hand,suddenly sends him instantaneously to Mars.He has not a clue as to where he is(this takes quite a while to learn)and finds,due to the lack of an Earth-like gravity,that he can jump enormous distances.However he runs into a race of beings similar in stature to Jar-Jar Binks,but with a smaller head,two small tusks and four arms.They take him back to their encampment.One day a princess from the city of Helium comes into contact with Carter.She tells him that her city and the others on Mars(Barsoom to folks there) are at war and that it has not gone well for her people.She is being forced to marry the commander of the opposing forces in order to achieve peace.Carter of course falls hard for the princess and helps her.Carters main objective all along has been to get back to Earth,and to that end they journey to the scared place of his captors.There they come upon the answer,but which the princess denies,telling Carter she needs more info from her city.It is an obvious lie to keep Carter there.After their visit both are captured and the princess is returned to her husband to be to be married.The princess tells Carter about her lie and tells him he can go back anytime he wants,and says the appropriate words.When the wedding party interrupts their talk,she turns and Carter is gone.She assumes he has gone back,but he has just jumped up onto a ceiling alcove.Over and above all of the strife on Mars,there is a higher race of beings manipulating the outcome of every battle,and are so bold as to even introduce themselves to Carter.Carter in turn enlists the help of his original captors to go against Helium`s enemies.A gigantic battles ensues and in the end the citizens of Helium are free, and Carter and the princess wed.One night shortly after,one of the higher race of beings sends Carter back to Earth.Carter wakes up on the floor of the cave he was originally transported from.It seems a copy of your body is only sent from one place to the next.If something were to happen to the original,the copy would die.Carter returns home and for years searches for another cave with another medallion in order to return to Mars,but in vain.So he fakes his death(we saw at the beginning of the movie)which lures out one of the higher beings.As his nephew is about to open the vault,the being comes out of the bushes to kill him,but Carter jumps him from behind and dispatches him.Carter`s nephew and Carter re-unite,but just briefly.Carter tells his nephew to look after his body and returns to the vault and Mars,his adopted home.There is just so much information to digest throughout this movie as one race comes into the picture,another pops up,then later another which look exactly like the first ones,and on and on.What really threw me off was when Carter first came in contact with his original captors,neither could understand each other.In his captors camp later,everyone is speaking perfect English.There is no explanation as to why the sudden change,except to have Carter remark that he can suddenly understand them.The beginning where Carter is being followed then suddenly he is dead and a will is being read,I thought could have been done better.Sure it all ties back to the beginning at the end,but for a while there at the start,you don`t know whether you were looking at a flashback when Carter is running around and his death is the present,or is it the reverse...it is just unnecessarily confusing for the start of a film like this.The film is epic in style,to be sure,but with all this detail being thrown at you and the hopping back and forth from one sub plot to another,is does get a bit overwhelming,and annoying.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 2:40:1 w/s a/r.The only extras are commentary and a featurette on its making.All in all an overly detail-oriented showboat that tries to look Star Wars-ishly epic-like,but fails to deliver the goods,in this overly long juggernaut.",3,Overly long epic

It's clear that the trailer and marketting of this movie did it a great disservice.  If--and this is a big IF--you can accept the fantasy genre rules for what they are, you'll love it.  Accept that the environment on Mars was at one time wet.  Accept that an earthman can be mystically transported to Mars.  Accept that inhabitants include four-armed humanoids.  Accept that warriors prefer swords even though the technology exists to creat guns. Accept that an earth man can jump and practicaly fly through the air, which is of course breathable, because of Mars lower gravity!  In other words, accept the vision of Edgar Rice Buroughs, the writer of the book created for Mars.  If you can, you will have a rip-roaring time.  The CGI is perfect.  Nothing on the screen looks phony. You'll love the wonderful tribal culture of the Tharks.  You'll love the male and female leads, who take their roles seriously, with no chesiness or tounge-in-cheek attitude.  The producers, director and actors all took the story seriously.  And given the nature of this sort of fantasy, doing it straight and doing it well require amazing talent. They succeed in maintaining the perfect adventure tone throughout, with no ""modernizing"" of the concept. There's not a doubt in my mind that Mr. Buroughts, if he could have seen it, would say, ""Yes, that's precisely how I imangined it when I wrote the book.""  You'll love the sheer adventure of it all.  Everyone in the theater--all five of us--were laughing, applauding, crying in a scene or two, and left the theater pleasantly astonished at how good this film was.

I feel towards ""John Carter of Mars"" like I feel towards ""Firefly"", or ""Starship Troopers"".. great entertainments that didn't catch on or were unfairly maligned, and I'm happy to see so many positive reviews here on Amazon.  I saw this film in the theater, and had a great time.  I laughed out loud alot at how audacious and fun the storytelling was.Simply put:  this is a classic swashbuckling adventure story. There's a tough hero, a beautiful princess, a host of adversaries, colorful side characters, steampunk technology, gorgeous Native American-meets-India-meets Final Fantasy art design, great soundtrack..there's also little to no swearing, no nudity, no bloody violence, no deep morality messages about racism or sustainability or how fathers don't love their sons enough, etc***and THANK YOU - no gritty realistic looking desaturated color palette.Yeah, this film is colorFULL- it looks fantastic in High Def!and it has plenty of romantic subtext, action and humor. And critics moaned about how the story didn't make enough sense. I could care less that they combined and altered some of the original books ideas and elements.. it was written 100 years ago.  It's no big loss, you can read it for free!Big plus:  a family-friendly entertainment that might get your kid interested in reading a hundred year old book  ;)If you're like me and like ""serious"" fantasy films like the Lord of the Rings, but ALSO have room on your shelf for lovingly made, FUN fantasy films that don't take themselves too seriously and are perfect for all ages, please give this film a chance.",5,Seriously,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,1765,"['spoilers', 'not', 'review', 'passionate', 'rant', 'film', 'was', 'fumbled', 'bad', 'marketing', 'raped', 'critics', 'forgotten', 'most', 'everybody.It', 'pisses', 'off', 'over', '40', 'fanboy', 'way', 'feel', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'feel', 'Firefly', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'great', 'entertainments', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'were', 'unfairly', 'maligned', ""'m"", 'happy', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'alot', 'how', 'audacious', 'storytelling', 'was.Simply', 'put', 'classic', 'swashbuckling', 'adventure', 'story', 'tough', 'hero', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'host', 'adversaries', 'colorful', 'side', 'characters', 'steampunk', 'technology', 'gorgeous', 'Native', 'American-meets-India-meets', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'art', 'design', 'great', 'soundtrack..there', 'also', 'little', 'swearing', 'nudity', 'bloody', 'violence', 'deep', 'morality', 'messages', 'racism', 'sustainability', 'how', 'fathers', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'sons', 'enough', 'etc***and', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'looking', 'desaturated', 'color', 'palette.Yeah', 'film', 'colorFULL-', 'fantastic', 'High', 'Def', 'plenty', 'romantic', 'subtext', 'action', 'humor', 'critics', 'moaned', 'how', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'enough', 'sense', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'combined', 'altered', 'original', 'books', 'ideas', 'elements..', 'was', 'written', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'big', 'loss', 'can', 'read', 'free', 'Big', 'plus', 'family-friendly', 'entertainment', 'might', 'get', 'kid', 'interested', 'reading', 'hundred', 'year', 'old', 'book', ""'re"", 'serious', 'fantasy', 'films', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'ALSO', 'have', 'room', 'shelf', 'lovingly', 'made', 'FUN', 'fantasy', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'are', 'perfect', 'ages', 'please', 'give', 'film', 'chance']",N/A

1468381,A3RWY91SBR2ACY,B005LAIH2W,Ronin,"[8, 8]","I read a few of the John Carter novels many years ago.  They were cheesy, but fun.  In fact, that's what workmates would say they saw what I was reading in the cafeteria; ""Barsoom novels?  Those are a hoot.""Superman was really based on John Carter.  Originally, he couldn't fly, and there was no kryptonite; he was just a dude from another planet who could jump really high, and had greater strength due to the Earths gravity relative to Krypton's. John Carter has super strength and high-jumping abilities when on Mars because of it's relative gravity compared to Earth's.  To the people of Mars, John Carter was an alien from another planet with strength beyond what was normal.  Both heroes fought for justice.  Put John Carter back on Earth and he's just a normal guy.  Put Superman back on Krypton, (if it hadn't blown up), and he'd be just another guy.  There really was no difference between John Carter and Superman.  I really think Superman would be a more relate-able character if he had stayed true to his comic book origins.  It was the Superman radio show that bestowed the gift of flight on him, as well as his pesky kryptonite allergy.  I have no doubt that Superman's creators must have been fans on the John Carter novels.  Think about it; the first Superman comic came out in 1938.  John Carter had already been out for more than a quarter of a century.  There is no way the exact similarities between these two characters was an accident.People often say that ""Star Wars"" was inspired by the ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Buck Rogers"" serials of the 30's and 40's.  This may be true, but Flash and Buck were inspired by John Carter.Disney has owned the rights to the Tarzan and John Cater books for a long time, and I remember listening to ""our 25"" on KPFK in Los Angeles in the 1980's when a guest was talking about how Disney planned on updating these stories for the big screen, for instance, there is really not much explanation in the books on how John Carter transports from the dessert cave to Mars, so some scientific explanation would be created for the movies.I waited and waited for the films to be made, but nothing in the 80's, nothing in the 90's, nothing in the 2000's.Then I heard that ""A Princess of Mars"" would come out in 2012 on the one-hundredth anniversary of the book's first publishing. The title would be changed to ""John Carter of Mars"".  I told my wife we would see that film for sure.Then I heard that Andrew Stanton was directing it and that it would be in 3D.  I again told my wife that we would see it for sure.Then we saw a trailer for it while watching another film.  At this point, I think they were still calling it, ""John Carter of Mars"".  I don't know what it was, I can't really explain why, but it just looked, stupid.  I turned to my wife and asked, ""Does that look good to you?""  She just shrugged.  Something about it looked completely underwhelming.Then I saw television ads.  By this time, I think the title had been shortened to just ""John Cater"".  Again, nothing about the ad made me want to shell out hard-earned cash to see it.  I remember wondering to myself why would they change the title to just ""John Carter"".  That really says nothing about the film, and doesn't pull you in.  I'm not a marketing student, but I can tell you, this title sucks.So here I am, a guy who read and enjoyed the books, had been waiting for the movies for literally decades, and now, had no desire to see them.  Imagine how a non-fan felt about it.  I should have been the easiest person in the world to sell this movie to.  Instead. we spent our movie-going money on other films.One day, ""John Carter"" came on television.  I recorded it on my DVR but did not immediately watch it.  One day, my family was getting ready run some errands.  I turned this movie on to watch a few minutes.  I was transfixed.  I didn't want to turn it off.  My daughter, in the middle of getting ready, walks through the living room to go to her room.  She stops for a second to glance at the TV.  She too became transfixed.""What is this?""""John Carter of Mars.  It's by the same guy who wrote the Tarzan books.""""It's really good.""At this point, we had to leave, so I turned it off.  I turned the movie back on as soon as we got back home.  My daughter walks in and asks that I start it over so she could see what she missed.  Now we both sit there and kept saying, ""wow, this is really good.  Why didn't we see this in the theater?""My wife walks in looks a little bit of it and asks, ""What's that?""""John Cater of Mars."", my daughter answers.""It looks cool. Please don't delete it.  I want to watch it later.""I get home from work one day, and my wife is watching it.  She's near the end.  She looks up at me and says, ""This is really good.  Isn't this the film that Disney wrote off?""I'm sorry that I'm taking a long time to get to my point.  All it takes to really like this movie is just to see it.  All it takes to really hate it is to watch the advertising.Oh, and at the very end of the film, you see the letters ""JCOM"", and then the real title of the film, ""John Carter of Mars"".  I'll never understand why the title was changed at the last minute, but the fact that this older title is still in the credits does show that nobody on the creative side of this film got the memo that it was no longer called ""John Carter of Mars"".So, while I skipped it in the theaters, I will gladly shell out money to buy the BD of this film.J. J. Abrams has been hired by Disney to direct the next Star Wars film.  I think he did a pretty good job on the latest Star Trek film, but it wasn't the best film in that franchise.  Watching ""John Carter"" shows how well Andrew Stanton understands and really loves the source material from the Barsoom novels.  I have to think that he would be much better suited to direct the new ""Star Wars"" films than Abrams.",5,One of the best space fantasy films ever made,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,5860,"['read',

1468382,AAOF195P95ZVC,B005LAIH2W,Ross E. Nelson,"[37, 41]","Bravo in this case to Amazon reviewers.  ""John Carter"" was low on my list of must-see movies after the critics panned it, but a quick look at Amazon's reviews changed my mind, and I wasn't disappointed.  It's hard to imagine what the critics' problem was with the movie.  The show had excellent special effects, more than a whiff of humor and laughs, a dash of mysticism, and entertainingly lifelike strange critters.  You can't help but think a good deal of Star Wars was cribbed from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars books, and why not?  Imitate the best, as they say.The plot in a nutshell is that of a former confederate soldier, sick of war, getting accidentally whisked to Mars and ending up in a three-way war that involves two sets of  humanoids and a rougher, cruder culture of tall, four-armed desert dwellers.  The humanoids (I suppose from the Martians' point of view the human Carter would be a Martianoid) are indistinguishable from each other save for the color of their clothing, and the fact that one side is an evil aggressor.  A mysterious group of powerful beings is intervening on the bad guys' behalf, and the battles are on.  Of course, the princess of Mars is on the good side.  She's not only gorgeous, naturally, but has the build of a football linebacker.  I wish I had her broad shoulders.  Carter is sort of like a low-grade Superman, made powerful by Mars's different environment and his earth physiology.That power leads to a couple of inconsistent scenes, in which he gets into trouble that his strength in other scenes easily gets him out of.  Well, all the suspense would be gone if he were unbeatable, I suppose.  Not quite clear too is his teleportation between worlds (potential spoiler here, though I don't think it is): The Carter on Mars is a copy of his body on earth, meaning that his earth body is lifeless but doesn't spoil while his Mars body holds his spirit, soul, whatever.  This datum leads to logical complications and a little confusion, at least for me.I still can't believe this movie wasn't a box office success.  It's not a ponderous, ""serious"" movie but a rollicking, fairly light science fiction fest that's a pleasure to watch.  Could Disney have possibly handled publicity for this movie any worse?  I'm not the most plugged-in grape on the grapevine, but it's unusual even for me to not hear of a huge potential blockbuster of a movie until the very day it hits the theaters.  A little ""Battleship"" hyping might have gone a long way for ""John Carter.""Still, it's not too late to enjoy this movie.  You might be surprised.A tangent that has nothing to do with the movie:  I rented ""Carter"" and again, as is so often the case, the DVD was scratched and dirty with one part of it unwatchable.  For pete's sake whoever's doing this, stop handling DVDs that are not your own with greasy, barbecue sauce-stained and peanut buttery fingers and picking them up with what appear to be claw hammers.  It's enough to make me pine for videotapes, which morons can't touch.",4,Seeing Red on Mars,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,3014,"['Bravo', 'case', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'low', 'list', 'must-see', 'movies', 'critics', 'panned', 'quick', 'look', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'changed', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'hard', 'imagine', 'what', 'critics', 'problem', 'was', 'movie', 'show', 'had', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'whiff', 'humor', 'dash', 'mysticism', 'entertainingly', 'lifelike', 'strange', 'critters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'good', 'deal', 'Star', 'Wars', 'was', 'cribbed', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Mars', 'books', 'why', 'not', 'Imitate', 'best', 'say.The', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'former', 'confederate', 'soldier', 'sick', 'war', 'getting', 'accidentally', 'whisked', 'Mars', 'ending', 'up', 'three-way', 'war', 'two', 'sets', 'humanoids', 'rougher', 'cruder', 'culture', 'tall', 'four-armed', 'desert', 'dwellers', 'humanoids', 'suppose', 'Martians', 'point', 'view', 'human', 'Carter', 'would', 'be', 'Martianoid', 'are', 'indistinguishable', 'other', 'save', 'color', 'clothing', 'fact', 'one', 'side', 'evil', 'aggressor', 'mysterious', 'group', 'powerful', 'beings', 'intervening', 'bad', 'guys', 'behalf', 'battles', 'are', 'course', 'princess', 'Mars', 'good', 'side', 'not', 'only', 'gorgeous', 'naturally', 'build', 'football', 'linebacker', 'wish', 'had', 'broad', 'shoulders', 'Carter', 'sort', 'low-grade', 'Superman', 'made', 'powerful', 'Mars', 'different', 'environment', 'earth', 'physiology.That', 'power', 'couple', 'inconsistent', 'scenes', 'trouble', 'strength', 'other', 'scenes', 'easily', 'Well', 'suspense', 'would', 'be', 'gone', 'were', 'unbeatable', 'suppose', 'Not', 'quite', 'clear', 'too', 'teleportation', 'worlds', 'potential', 'spoiler', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'copy', 'body', 'earth', 'meaning', 'earth', 'body', 'lifeless', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'Mars', 'body', 'spirit', 'soul', 'datum', 'logical', 'complications', 'little', 'confusion', 'least', 'me.I', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'box', 'office', 'success', 'not', 'ponderous', 'serious', 'movie', 'rollicking', 'fairly', 'light', 'science', 'fiction', 'fest', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Could', 'Disney', 'have', 'possibly', 'handled', 'publicity', 'movie', 'worse', ""'m"", 'not', 'most', 'plugged-in', 'grape', 'grapevine', 'unusual', 'even', 'not', 'hear', 'huge', 'potential', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'very', 'day', 'theaters', 'little', 'Battleship', 'hyping', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'John', 'Carter', 'Still', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'surprised.A', 'tangent', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'rented', 'Carter', 'again', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'DVD', 'was', 'scratched', 'dirty', 'one', 'part', 'unwatchable', 'pete', 'sake', 'whoever', 'doing', 'stop', 'handling', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'own', 'greasy', 'barbecue', 'sauce-stained', 'peanut', 'buttery', 'fingers', 'picking', 'up', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'claw', 'hammers', 'enough', 'make', 'pine', 'videotapes', 'morons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch']",N/A

Alas, I was a bit disappointed.  I loved the special effects but thought that the depiction of the main characters was flawed.  I also sensed that the story had been modified.

In looking at those 1 star reviews, the common thread seems to be people who have read the ERB series of John Carter novels and hold them dear to their hearts. This movie is not for them. It borrows some from the series and takes off from there. Reconciling your inner visions with the Hollywood version of anything can be a jarring experience.

Hopefully, there's a mini-series out there somewhere more true to the source material although I have to imagine it would resemble old episodes of Flash Gordon.As for the movie itself, I liked it!

The only reason I'm doing so is because I felt the movie was not as bad as all the so-called ""Top Critics"" who really bashed it said it was.In 'John Carter of Mars' (which, if you're from an older generation, you'll know is an adaptation of writer Edgar Rice Burroughs' 'Barsoom' novels), Taylor Kitsch (who played Gambit in 'Wolverine: Origins', and also starred in the TV series 'Friday Night Lights') plays John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army Captain now searching for wealth, to get away from the several different party's hunting him, and to escape from failures in his past. When Carter ends up in the cave of gold he was searching for, he ends up killing a being known as a Thern, and is accidentally transported to ""Barsoom"" (the real name for Mars in the novels). Carter is taken prisoner by the Green Martians, but discovers that he has the ability to leap great distances & perform feats of great strength due to his different bone density & adaptation to Earth's higher gravity. Carter soon finds himself caught in the middle of a Civil War between the two Red Martian (who are more human looking) cities, and finds a love interest in the form of a Princess named Dejah Thoris (played here by Lynn Collins, who also starred in 'Wolverine: Origins' as Silverfox).Despite my insistence that the film was not that bad, there is no denying that 'John Carter of Mars' WAS a bad movie. There are a lot of impressive effects, but nothing really special that we haven't seen from other space-themed movies such as 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', 'Babylon 5', etc; the cast is horrible (only Taylor Kitsch who plays the main character seems like he was actually TRYING to act); the story is long, difficult to follow, & doesn't really hold your attention all the time; and really Disney? You let a PIXAR director who has never directed a live action movie direct this film??? You can tell the director did not know what he was doing, as the style & visualization for this film is really bland.Bottom line, I'd only recommend this movie if you were a fan of the 'Barsoom' novels, or if you're under the age of 12.

It is the story of a Civil War veteran who dies and magically appears on Mars (no explanation needed, although the film felt it wise to add a ridiculous supernatural element to explain the phenomenon). There he is captured by a green alien race called the Tharks. In the book, he wins their respect with his jumping abilities and his battle skills. In the movie, he simply escapes them (possibly because the filmmakers did not want to deal with the intricacies of the foreign culture and the relationship developments). The Tharks have also captured Dejah Thoris (who in the movie basically gives herself to them because she doesn't want to get married) and Carter falls in love with her. He aligns himself with her to save her native city called Helium.Aside from the adaptation problems, I was disappointed by how much the filmmakers relied on sci-fi cliches to keep the plot moving. Is making a strong woman reject her fiancee the only way to illustrate that she is strong? Is torturing a member of another race the only way to make an audience care for them? Are lame jokes about the aliens mistaking Carter's hometown of Virginia as his name really necessary? The cliches made the film watchable, but nowhere near remarkable. So much has been changed from the classic novel, that I just got more and more frustrated the more I watched.I much prefer the old fashioned straight-forwardness of the book. In it, Carter falls in love with Dejah Thoris at first sight, and although she is strong-willed, she is a captive and therefore helpless and able to be saved. The strong male-oriented sense of adventure is somewhat present in the movie, but it is overshadowed by convoluted additions to the plot. The platonic relationships between Carter and Sola and Tars Tarkas are completely glossed over, which is probably the most frustrating loss in the translation from page to screen. The overall theme of combativeness vs. peacefulness is completely lost.The marketing for this film was horrible. While the film cost millions of dollars to make, the studio did very little advertising, and the trailers I saw didn't give any hints at the story. It wasn't until later that I found out it was based on the Burroughs stories that I had recently discovered. I'll admit that my interest in the book is what brought me to the film, but had it not been for that I would have passed it by.",2,At Least They Kept Woola,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,2462,"['John', 'Carter', 'loosely', 'based', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Mars', 'Barsoom', 'series', 'story', 'Civil', 'War', 'veteran', 'who', 'magically', 'Mars', 'explanation', 'needed', 'film', 'felt', 'wise', 'add', 'ridiculous', 'supernatural', 'element', 'explain', 'phenomenon', 'captured', 'green', 'alien', 'race', 'called', 'Tharks', 'book', 'respect', 'jumping', 'abilities', 'battle', 'skills', 'movie', 'simply', 'possibly', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'deal', 'intricacies', 'foreign', 'culture', 'relationship', 'developments', 'Tharks', 'have', 'also', 'captured', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'who', 'movie', 'basically', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'married', 'Carter', 'love', 'save', 'native', 'city', 'called', 'Helium.Aside', 'adaptation', 'problems', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'much', 'filmmakers', 'relied', 'sci-fi', 'cliches', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'making', 'strong', 'woman', 'reject', 'fiancee', 'only', 'way', 'illustrate', 'strong', 'torturing', 'member', 'race', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'Are', 'lame', 'jokes', 'aliens', 'mistaking', 'Carter', 'hometown', 'Virginia', 'name', 'really', 'necessary', 'cliches', 'made', 'film', 'watchable', 'nowhere', 'remarkable', 'So', 'much', 'been', 'changed', 'classic', 'novel', 'just', 'got', 'more', 'more', 'frustrated', 'more', 'watched.I', 'much', 'prefer', 'old', 'fashioned', 'straight-forwardness', 'book', 'Carter', 'love', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'first', 'sight', 'strong-willed', 'captive', 'therefore', 'helpless', 'able', 'be', 'saved', 'strong', 'male-oriented', 'sense', 'adventure', 'somewhat', 'present', 'movie', 'overshadowed', 'convoluted', 'additions', 'plot', 'platonic', 'relationships', 'Carter', 'Sola', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'are', 'completely', 'glossed', 'probably', 'most', 'frustrating', 'loss', 'translation', 'page', 'screen', 'overall', 'theme', 'combativeness', 'vs.', 'peacefulness', 'completely', 'lost.The', 'marketing', 'film', 'was', 'horrible', 'film', 'cost', 'millions', 'dollars', 'make', 'studio', 'did', 'very', 'little', 'advertising', 'trailers', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'hints', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'later', 'found', 'was', 'based', 'Burroughs', 'stories', 'had', 'recently', 'discovered', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'interest', 'book', 'what', 'brought', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'passed']",N/A

But I always had this little fear in the back of my mind that said it may not do as well as it should, considering Prince of Persia's huge failure, which is a movie I also loved. Then sure enough first weekend $30 million, which if you know the movie business, a movie with a 200 million budget making 30 million is bad, really bad. I kept thinking and hoping for the future of this franchise that it would by some miracle surpass it's budget and do ok. But I was wrong, the next weekend it made even less and less, until The Hunger Games came out to completely diminish any hopes of serious money or any at all for the tale of John Carter of Mars.But what America didn't spend the time or money to find out, was that John Carter happens to be one of the best scifi action adventure movies, one that Disney has ever put out, and two ever made. John Carter has an incredibly captivating story to tell, and has a side romance for any of you women out there. I know right now the chances of John Carter: God of Mars being made are about as good as me going streaking through Harlem. Right, probably not gonna happen, but I guess we can hope and pray, for a sequel not for me streaking. John Carter has an interesting prologue that leads into an excellent adventure on one of the many planets you've probably never been to: Mars.So pick up this movie immediately, because you will never be bored and you'll continuously be asking yourself what life would be like if John Carter hadn't bombed.

I can say that it was a fun adventure movie.The characters are likable, particularly the strong and beautiful princess, Dejah Thoris, who is definitely not a damsel in distress; she wields a sword and knows how to use it.  I also was very impressed with the Thark alien race, who have a unique appearance and distinct culture, but despite them looking and sounding similar, there's just enough nuance to see the personalities of the key characters, especially Tars Tarkas and Sola.  As for John Carter himself, he is likable and unlike a lot of reluctant heroes who quickly change their tune after meeting the pretty woman, it takes John a while to decide to fight alongside the Tharks to save Dejah and Helium.Having recently vacationed in Utah, it was great to see that scenes in this film were filmed there, because the state is very unique and has a natural beauty you won't find anywhere else.  The way Mars is portrayed is unique; the alien races, fauna, and flora are unlike what I have seen in other media.  I particularly liked the dog-like pet of Sola who takes a liking to John.One complaint I have is that we don't learn enough about the villains of the movie. I would have liked to know more about Sab Than, Matai Shang and the Therns and what was motivating them.  Still, the lack of development of the villains is nothing new to this genre.I don't understand why this film received a negative response; in my opinion, the story was fun, the film looked good, and it was family-friendly.  It must have been a failure on Disney's marketing, because I quite enjoyed it and am sad there won't be more films (I believe this was planned as the first movie in a trilogy).

Suddenly among a warrior tribe of four-armed aliens and a beautiful princess, Carter ends up in the middle of another war. But when faced with the chance of returning home to Earth, Carter may have found a cause worth fighting for in Princess Dejah and the people of Barsoom.Taylor Kitsch stars as John Carter, the bitter and destitute man who cares for nothing but his found cave of gold. Kitsch has a young face and stoic countenance, perfect for the role of the ageless John Carter. He's a believable fighter and a great straight man to plenty of humor. Princess Dejah is played by Lynn Collins, who has terrific chemistry with John Carter, and is just as strong and smart as her male counterparts (if not more). Mark Strong and Dominic West are fantastic villains, especially West as a surprisingly charming and attractive (though nave) despot. And my favorite characters in the novel (Princess of Mars) as well as the film were the Tharks, played by Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church and Samantha Morton. Though CGI, the characters still brought depth, emotion, and humor and successfully brought Burroughs' characters to life.Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic Princess of Mars (published in 1917), John Carter is a surprising and exceptional retelling. I recently read Princess of Mars in anticipation for the film. And though the film doesn't delve into the depth of the Tharks' stories as I would have liked, it still captures the spirit of the novel. And the natives of Barsoom get an impressive technology upgrade, and the science is updated for the awe-factor in the film.I had my reservations after seeing the official trailers. But I was happy to see that the screen writers and director Andrew Stanton knew what they were doing, even if the marketing was off. This fan was captivated from beginning to end and loved every minute of this epic adventure. Full of fascinating characters, life-like aliens, and advanced technology - science fiction fans will certainly enjoy John Carter.  But the action-packed thrills, suspense, drama, romance, and incredible story will appeal to a wide range of new fans - of all ages. It's heart-warming, inspirational, and highly entertaining.

1468406,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B005LAIH2W,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[16, 20]","[This review is for the theatrical release.]I have read 12 of the John Carter novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  ""A Princess of Mars"" was the first and had Carter die in a mystic cave and spiritually elevate himself to the red planet Mars, aka Barsoom.  The old Marvel comics series and the newer John Carter series from Dynamite [Warlord of Mars: Dejah Thoris Volume 1 - The Colossus of Mars TP] were my only other resource and I'm really happy to report that the film follows along pretty much along the lines of the campy, pulp style of the early 20th century.2012 is the 100th anniversary of the publication of A Princess of Mars and so I was hoping this film would capture the spirit and it did!  Pro reviewers online were wondering about the film's derivation or why the Tharks had tusks, blah blah.  Clearly they had not read the book!Burroughs is actually related to John Carter and finds Carter has died and ERB has inherited the estate and is left with a diary that is full of the adventures of Carter's time on Mars.  This is a common device with Burroughs's stories.  I recall his Pellucidar tales had a type of radio that the author would get his stories from.  Or on Barsoom, some kind of radio or telepathy was used.In the film, the first meeting of the Tharks and Tars Tarkas was really realistic from the book's perspective.  The personality of Tars is just what I would have imagined:  a Jeddack (king) of his people, proud, challenged and sees an opportunity to help his planet.The princess is also of the same mind:  she sees in Carter not only the salvation of her civilization, but also the salvation of his heart.  Carter's family was brutally murdered during his time in the Civil War and in burying him he lost all hope and all purpose in life.  Can Deja Thoris rekindle that purpose?The bad guys in the piece are Tharns.  I can't remember them from the novel but I have seen this type of tale before - immortal beings who hold sway over lesser beings and guide a planetary civilization to death and despair, and them move onto another one and do the same thing.  Their agents on Earth are prepping us while they mop up Mars (Barsoom).And I loved the special effects.  Helium I imagined more a city in the sky, but they had it down pretty well.  The flyers were as I imagined - giant Dragonfly designs and the fights in the sky were great to see.  The crowd scenes were fun, as well as the gladiator battles with the Great White Apes!Bottom Line:  Don't listen to the naysayers and closed-minded critics.  If you like camp, and long for those thrilling days of yesteryear, check out this film.  No, it's not the best film they could have made of our gentleman of Virginia, but the sum of its parts - Western, Science Fiction and Fantasy Adventure - were really well done.

After waiting until John Carter hit video, I sat down to watch, telling my wife we could turn it off if it was as bad as we had heard.  After sitting through the entirety of this wonderful film without leaving our seats, which we never do, we had to ask each how this was such a failure at the box office (this is not a film for critics, so who cares about them in this case).  From start to finish this was the second most fun I've had watching a movie all year (Avengers was my #1).  Now, I haven't read the books, so how well this translates the source I don't know (or care really).  A movie is NOT a book, so anyone looking for that, go read a book.  As a thrilling adventure that has it's feet firmly placed in the past while taking every advantage possible of modern special effects John Carter is a spectacularly fun film.

1468421,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B005LAIH2W,Sky,"[9, 11]","I sure do hope that the DVD sales of John Carter make up for the bomb that the movie was in theaters. Because at this point I think any studio would be hard pressed to risk another big budget to bring a sequel to the big screen, and that's a shame really. John Carter was an excellent movie that for whatever reason didn't get a fair shake with critics.John Carter is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""Barsoom Series"",  and the John Carter story was only the first in a series of 11 novels (circa 1917 - 1960something).  So there is/was plenty of sequel potential. But as I mentioned above, I won't be holding my breath for any sequels.Perhaps in addition to the odd slew of negative reception by critics, John Carter also suffered from bad marketing by Disney. I remember seeing the trailers for the movie and not being too impressed. It looked weird and unbelievable; some dude fighting monsters on Mars in prehistoric garb with spaceships flying around. And that's not too far off the mark, but the movie's a lot better than that description makes it sound.In a nutshell, in the late 1800s, John Carter is a Civil War vet that the army wants back in its ranks. While running from the army, he also runs into some hostile Indians and gets chased into a cave where coincidentally some portal or gate is being used by an ""alien"" life form. And Carter inadvertently gets sucked into the gate and lands on Mars where the new war that he'll be involved in is anything but civil. I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that the idea was not that Carter gets transferred to Mars as we know it, but Mars in an alternate universe, because John Carter's Mars is fully capable of sustaining human (and non-human) life.The movie has a great story, plenty of action, terrific CGI and it's decently acted. While it ran a little long at just over 2 hours, I was completely entertained from start to finish. And I was left hoping for more. And indeed John Carter was intended to be the first in a trilogy. But according to Entertainment Weekly, Disney expects to lose up to $200MM on John Carter and those kinds of negative numbers won't have Mickey Mouse green-lighting any sequels.But see John Carter. It stands alone as a great film, and while it may leave you wanting more, the open ending can be satisfied with the viewer's own imagination.",4,Mars Needs John Carter,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,2329,"['sure', 'do', 'hope', 'DVD', 'sales', 'John', 'Carter', 'make', 'up', 'bomb', 'movie', 'was', 'theaters', 'point', 'think', 'studio', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'risk', 'big', 'budget', 'bring', 'sequel', 'big', 'screen', 'shame', 'really', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'fair', 'shake', 'critics.John', 'Carter', 'based', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Barsoom', 'Series', 'John', 'Carter', 'story', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'series', '11', 'novels', 'circa', '1917', '1960something', 'So', 'is/was', 'plenty', 'sequel', 'potential', 'mentioned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'holding', 'breath', 'sequels.Perhaps', 'addition', 'odd', 'slew', 'negative', 'reception', 'critics', 'John', 'Carter', 'also', 'suffered', 'bad', 'marketing', 'Disney', 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'impressed', 'looked', 'weird', 'unbelievable', 'dude', 'fighting', 'monsters', 'Mars', 'prehistoric', 'garb', 'spaceships', 'flying', 'around', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'mark', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', 'description', 'nutshell', 'late', '1800s', 'John', 'Carter', 'Civil', 'War', 'vet', 'army', 'back', 'ranks', 'running', 'army', 'also', 'hostile', 'Indians', 'chased', 'cave', 'where', 'coincidentally', 'portal', 'gate', 'being', 'used', 'alien', 'life', 'form', 'Carter', 'inadvertently', 'sucked', 'gate', 'Mars', 'where', 'new', 'war', ""'ll"", 'be', 'involved', 'anything', 'civil', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'suggest', 'idea', 'was', 'not', 'Carter', 'transferred', 'Mars', 'know', 'Mars', 'alternate', 'universe', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'fully', 'capable', 'sustaining', 'human', 'non-human', 'life.The', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'plenty', 'action', 'terrific', 'CGI', 'decently', 'acted', 'ran', 'little', 'long', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'was', 'completely', 'entertained', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'left', 'hoping', 'more', 'indeed', 'John', 'Carter', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'first', 'trilogy', 'according', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'Disney', 'lose', 'up', '200MM', 'John', 'Carter', 'kinds', 'negative', 'numbers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'green-lighting', 'sequels.But', 'see', 'John', 'Carter', 'alone', 'great', 'film', 'may', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'open', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'satisfied', 'viewer', 'own', 'imagination']",N/A

I was thoroughly impressed with pretty much every aspect of this film, and I highly recommend it, especially if you have been holding off so far. One thought that kept coming to mind was, ""this is what the first two Star Wars prequels (which I found quite disappointing) *wish* they could have been like (but were not)."" Not that a direct comparison is warranted, but John Carter uses visual effects technology in the best possible way, to drive the story in a captivating manner that transports you to another place. Additionally, if like me you have not read the source material (""Princess of Mars"" by ERB), the film will actually have some surprising plot twists and things that keep you wondering, which is always nice. It was/is a terrible shame that this performed so poorly at the box office, because it is such a well made film, and everyone who worked on it should be given great credit for not losing the quality at all when working on such a big project. Many films of far inferior quality have made way more money, and this one should have had so much going for it. Blame the poor advertising, I guess. Even the DVD cover art is horrible, in my opinion.

I've my own ideas as to why they trashed this movie but ignore their hating, or you'll miss a pretty great movie.  Yes, the movie is a little over-long but the plot is straight forward and the effects are excellent.  Disney is notorious for being cheap in the effects department but I was constantly surprised for two hours how high-end the production values were.  I don't think I've ever seen a Disney film that was this grand and on such large a scale.  It's definitely a sweeping epic.The best part about this film is it's deeper message.  It's not just about a guy who ends up on Mars and falls in love with a princess.  Not by a LONG shot.  In fact, the message is almost spoken word-for-word by the villian of the story.  This movie is really a wakeup call for everyone on earth today.  It's symbolic of what's happening on our own planet right NOW.  Clandestine persons or parties instigate wars to further their own agenda.  They don't actually fight the wars.  They just ""manage"" them, as was said in the film.  This cycle of war and causing divisions among groups within a civilization makes them easier to manipulate and facilitates the takeover of their lives and planet.

With utter bombs like AVATAR (aka POCAHONTAS or FERN GULLY (take your pick) in outer space) and the purely dreadful THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, it has been a while since we've seen a rollicking good epic sci/fi-fantasy that comes across as fun and with a breath of originality. But it definitely delivered in Disney's JOHN CARTER.I will admit I had lower expectations going in on this one. I had such high hopes for Disney's PRINCE OF PERSIA a couple years ago, but the storyline and characters were just too simple and predictable. But here, with JOHN CARTER, there's a mild complexity to the story that delivers on the right levels.The story starts out with Captain John Carter, former Confederate soldier, being hounded by the Union soldiers to help fight in a war against the Native Americans in Arizona. But when Carter tries to escape from an attack, he winds up hiding out in a mysterious cave with strange markings and lots of gold. And that's when the strange man appears from nowhere, and John Carter suddenly finds himself transported across the galaxy to Mars. With a world on the edge of destruction, an evil warlord with a powerful weapon, and a mysterious race of beings representing a goddess, John Carter must decide which side of the war to fight on -- or whether to fight at all. But the fate of an entire race is in his hands. And it isn't only a warlord after him -- something much more powerful wants John Carter dead.CGI runs rampant throughout the film, but it's never overdone or obvious -- it's subtle in all the right ways, but delivering epic and astounding shots. There's a wonderful exotic look to the film that I don't think has been seen in years. The sets are amazing, and definitely took my imagination to task.My only beef with the film is the acting in the very first few scenes, where Taylor Kitsch (playing the titular hero) comes across a slight bit stiff. Once John Carter's on Mars working through his character development, he seems to come into his own. Lynn Collins is breath-taking as the Princess, and Mark Strong pulls off another great performance as well. The side characters complement the storyline and the main handful of leads.After I left the theater, it kept growing in my mind, just how much I enjoyed JOHN CARTER. The music (another wonderful score by Michael Giacchino) is haunting and truly worthy of this epic tale based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' source material. There are some very fun nods to the book series the movie originates from, and readers of those will be chuckling along the way.

1468442,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B005LAIH2W,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[9, 12]","A Familiar Story100 years after it was first published Edgar Rice Burroughs' sci-fi epic FINALLY is done justice on the big screen. Under-hyped, over-budget, and helmed by a first-time live-action director most famous for directing CGI animated films for a general audience, John Carter is a sci-fi fantasy adventure triumph, and not only the best film of the summer so far, but the best movie I've seen all year.Anyone who has read the books knows the basic story, and many do even if they haven't. A cavalryman at the end of the American Civil War gets magically transported to Mars where his already formidable fighting skills become super-human thanks to the low gravity of Mars. He gets caught up in a war, rescues a Princess, and saves the day. Anyone who faults the movie for repeating tropes of the past should take a moment to consider something Isaac Asimov once said:""There is no such thing as an original idea."" Does John Carter feature gladiator arena fights, a princess in distress, all the usual adventure movie themes? Yes it does. Do Star Wars and Avatar and dozens of other movies feature the same themes and tropes? Yes they do. The books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs did it a hundred years ago, but that's not the point. The point is that the movie does it again, but it does it WELL.That Old Saturday MatineePeople don't seem to care for movies that cater to the love of the old serials like they used to. When Star Wars came out it ushered in a whole era of fan-boy love for old-school adventure. When Indiana Jones came out it got the same level of excitement boiling in the blood of genre fans. Then Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow came out and everyone seemed to forget what movies were all about as it crashed and burned at the box office. The new Star Wars movies came out and people were so demanding in their expectations that they ceased to enjoy good old-fashioned sci-fi cheese for it's own sake (it's supposed to be fun!). And now here we are with John Carter and the same people are making the same mistakes all over again. John Carter is not a throw-away film. It's the best example of it's genre in a LONG time. It's better than the Star Wars Prequels. It's better than the fourth Indiana Jones (which is under-rated in my opinion). And it's a WHOLE lot better than Marvel's The Avengers.A Tour-De-Force of Wildly Entertaining CinemaThis film really does have everything you could possibly want in a summer blockbuster. After I saw it I just couldn't believe it didn't get a July 4th opening, because it deserved to be THE movie of the summer. The film is well-directed, with excellent pacing, timing, and framing. It keeps you watching closely every second, and wastes no time. The photography is beautiful, showing us alien vistas and armies reminiscent of monster films and sword and sandal classics. The fighting is never off-screen, cut-away, or out-of-frame (unlike the horribly directed close-up hand-to-hand fights in the Avengers).The jokes are genuinely and universally funny, viewing after viewing. The writing is sharp and neither overly sparse nor overly wordy. The editing of this film is excellent, yielding a compact, compelling picture that never drags. The CGI is excellent, and even characters that are completely CGI are believable and very human in their emotions and actions (take that JarJar!). There is a bit of a cartoonishness to the CGI, but it simply blends with the world of the movie so well (like Avatar) that I don't mind it at all. The sound effects could win an academy award, and the music DEFINITELY should. John Carter has the most recognizable theme I've heard in a very long time, and the score is dynamic, taking us through all the emotions of joy, sorrow, romantic longing, and heroic triumph.Most importantly, this film has HEART. There is character development, actual PLOT (scheming forces manipulating rulers and others to bring destruction, an internal struggle to let go of the past and fight to create a future). The action sequences are spectacular, but none is so memorable as when our hero has a series of flashbacks to painful past events while fighting endless hordes of green-skinned Martians all alone. I cried during that sequence. That's movie magic.What a Summer Movie Should BeSome people go to movies to see something shocking. Some go to see something dark and edgy. I go to get away from my problems and be reminded that anything is possible. I go to experience a sense of wonder, and most of all, to be entertained. John Carter is a masterpiece of these elements. If you have the right mindset it will make you feel like a kid again. It will let you forget about the world and be magically transported to a far away world. And you will be VERY entertained.John Carter is unapologetic escapist fantasy. Most good things in life are. The only flaw that I can think of is that the film SHOULD have been called John Carter of Mars (as it is on the End Title). Maybe then more people would have seen it. I saw it twice in the theater and only wish I could have seen it a few more times. Don't rent this movie. Buy it. On Blu-ray.

Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara), the author of the book, plays a part in the film in order to give credence to the tale. The tale is patterned on the common early 20th century belief that Mars was inhabited by a dying race with technology greater than our own.The character of John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is nicely introduced through a series of events that take place in Arizona. Carter, a soldier of the lost cause is suddenly transported to Mars and finds himself part of a different war. Because of the low gravity of Mars, John Carter finds that he can run faster and jump higher than the natives. There are two warring factions of humans and giant green creatures just to add to the mix.Lynn Collins plays the warrior princess who wants John Carter to help her defend her city of Helium. Carter, wants only to return to Earth.This movie is finally a fitting tribute to the works of Burroughs. When you watch it, you think, ""Oh, this has been done before,"" or ""that was taken from Star Wars..."" But really this wasn't taken from them, they borrowed from Burroughs.

1468466,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B005LAIH2W,The Wiz,"[44, 54]","More and more I believe modern audiences are going to the movies expecting to be disappointed.  This is partly owing to pre-release media bombardments featuring a given film's highlights and then after we're lured into the theater we discover that those scenes were no more than window-dressing for sound and fury.  Yes, John Carter has those big, action scenes but they are absolutely essential for ""bringing to life"" what was originally an adventure, sci-fi/fantasy book series.There will, no doubt, be many reviewers that want to contrast this film with past monolithic sci-fi/fantasy adventures but let us not forget that long, long before Star Wars or Avatar there was John Carter of Mars; a fantasy series created by Edgar Rice Burroughs around the same time period as WWI and which remains to this day, one of the most imaginative mythologies in fantasy and sci-fi literature of all time.  When they were written, Burroughs' novels were considered more pulp fiction or fantasy entertainment for perhaps a less mature audience than serious fiction; however I believe that the film adaptation has definitely added levels of maturity and character complexity that were never fully developed in the books.  For example the principal character John Carter, although a natural fighter, is haunted by his tragic past as a Civil War veteran which causes him to resist an inherent, heroic inclination and compels him to simply drop out of society or at least obtain the option to distance himself from it (e.g. his gold prospecting).  Add to this the fact that he's suddenly hurled into an alien world complete with ""civil wars"" and racial tensions of its own where he is literally confronted with an option to embrace a separate ""destiny"" within the context of a new life.  The movie adaptation does not however force Carter to face these struggles alone because the role of Dejah Thoris has been transformed from a pretty piece of furniture, doomed to be continually taken captive as she was in the books, to an incredibly intelligent, as well as beautiful warrior princess  that proves herself to be every bit a heroine of Mars.  Ever since Dragonheart we have seen completely CGI animated characters in major roles, with Gollum in LOTR taking this potential to new levels and more recently the character of Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.  This is also the case with another leading character in this film, i.e. Sola a female member of the Thark race (the distinctive Green Martians), as a sympathetic and courageous supporting role.I always loved the creativity of Burroughs in his books but I equally admire what the writers and producers have done with the film John Carter.  Much of the cinematography looks reminiscent of the wonderful book covers that Michael Whelan did back in the 90's (lol, one of the reasons they originally appealed to me).  And of course, modern innovations in CGI have made it possible for such a fantastic universe as this to be transformed into a live-action feature film.  As with LOTR, the special effects supplement a great story rather than supplant a shallow story that only serves as a vehicle for cleverly-arranged, silver-screen pixels (e.g. transformers or the re-booted Star Trek).John Carter does not appear to be a ""feel good"" movie (although the kids in the theater seemed to like it) or sci-fi for the masses like Avatar; rather it seems to me that Disney might be targeting true sci-fi/fantasy lovers rather than producing typically forgettable crowd pleasers.  Is it possible that Disney is actually bucking the Hollywood trend?if I could give this one 10 stars I would because it's just so exceptional given the climate of modern movies.  It's truly a visually stunning movie with a multitude of memorable scenes, an excellent musical score and it honestly reminded me of the experience of seeing the original Star Wars in the theater as a kid.",5,ICONIC...

It, and all of his work, is pulp fiction at its best (or worst)!  What it lacks in realism, character development and import, it more than makes up for in action, adventure and good story-telling.  Scientific understanding, of course, goes out the window.  Even in Burroughs'  time, it was well known that Mars was a frigid, lifeless planet.  Yet Burroughs' planet Mars, if I recall, was a hot, dry planet, populated with all sorts of humanoids and beasts. Silly but imaginative, his books BEG to be made into fun summer movies.  Now, 100 years later, with CGI, we have the capability to do his imagination justice.John Carter is worth watching once, maybe twice, for the action and special effects.  It's superior to Episodes I, II, and III of Star Wars, for sure.  Particularly neat about the special effects is the steampunk appearance of the flying machines.So where did the Disney folk go wrong?  In the CASTING of the humans!  Taylor Kitsch does nothing but scowl the entire movie.  He's too damn scrawny and his hair's too long and scraggly. And finally, with dark circles around his eyes, he looked white and sickly against all the red-skinned Martians.  A better choice for Carter, in my opinion, would be Chris Hemsworth (or his brother), who played Thor. Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris, the Martian princess, is OK she's but not much of an actress.  At one point she cries but sheds no tears.  With the millions spent on special effects, couldn't somebody have sprung for glycerin drops?In Burroughs' book, Carter is immediately smitten upon his first view of Dejah Thoris and battles all of Mars to win her love.  Disney's Carter and Thoris have no chemistry together and you get no sense they are in love.  The computer generated green Martians and even the Martian dog have far more emotion.So my recommendation is to do an Amazon rental of this movie.

Once the action moved to Mars, things definitely looked a lot more visually impressive. I thought that the action sequences were pretty good.

The plot was not too complicated. I felt pretty engaged in the movie for most of it--even the early part where not much was going on. The main actors in it did an excellent job. The dialogue was not dull like it could've been.

With Walt Disney and director Andrew Stanton noticeably shaken over the numbers being thrown out about the cost of John Carter($250M! $300M!), that type of scrutiny has been their reality for the last month. What was the response? A full force marketing blitz that wreaked of desperation, which ended with a 10 minute sizzle reel of clips that turned out to be the perfect cure for insomnia.Unfortunately, that footage was an indicator of what was to come, as all of the dollars spent on re-shoots couldn't make John Carter any less of a boring, incomprehensible drag. Edgar Rice Burroughs, the famous adventure author and creator of Tarzan, would himself be up a tree if he saw what has become of his nearly century old Barsoom novels. Based on the first in the series, A Princess of Mars, the film is led by charisma-free Taylor Kitsch, showing none of the snap glimpsed when he played Gambit in the otherwise terrible Wolverine film. His John Carter is an emotionless cypher, a former captain for the Confederate army who can't seem to stay out of trouble. We're introduced to him via his notes, left behind for a young Burroughs(Daryl Sabara) to read. The author began nearly all of his Barsoom novels this way in a clever little twist, as if Carter's space faring adventures were real and he were simply discovering them. After an interminably long setup, Carter is mysteriously whisked away to the planet Mars, where presumably the action begins.Instead what we actually get is a string of poorly realized characters with convoluted back stories, droning on about some sort of civil war. Known as Barsoom to the natives, the world looks like the bone dry Tatooine segments in The Phantom Menace, only with less pod racing. Or if you like, imagine Waterworld without any water, and that's a pretty good idea of how lame this place is. It's also an indication of the level of convoluted political maneuvering you're likely to face. For some inexplicable reason, Sab Than(Dominic West) of the Zodangans hates the people of Helium, including their badly dressed king(a depressed looking Ciaran Hinds). Yet he wants to marry their feisty and very busty princess, Dejah Thoris(Lynn Collins), in a scheme devised by a bunch of bald headed mystical shapeshifters. Throw in some alien Tharks, a few white apes, and some random mumbo jumbo, and what you have is an action movie so convoluted it makes Inception look like Yogi Bear.It's not as if the plot is all that deep, it's just impossible to tell who anybody is or what their angle is. Nor will you care. Carter arrives and everyone thinks he's some sort of messiah because he can jump really far.  Imagine what the Hulk could do in that gravity. Pointless questions like this will infect your brain because nothing happening on screen will hold your interest.  At such an exorbitant cost, you'd think that money would have bought something more lively than a bunch of unimpressive lizards and mountain landscapes. Stanton, a Pixar vet who directed no less than the amazing Wall-E, appears tripped up by the source material. He certainly didn't have the same live-action success as his colleague Brad Bird did with Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol. John Carter too closely resembles many films we've seen already, sadly ironic considering Burroughs novels were the impetus for so many of them.",2,Somebody at Disney is gonna pay for this junk,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3527,"['When', 'majority', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'film', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'cost', 'then', 'problem', 'usually', 'studio', 'exec', 'head', 'rolling', 'floor', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'noticeably', 'shaken', 'numbers', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'cost', 'John', 'Carter', '250M', '300M', 'type', 'scrutiny', 'been', 'reality', 'last', 'month', 'What', 'was', 'response', 'full', 'force', 'marketing', 'blitz', 'wreaked', 'desperation', 'ended', '10', 'minute', 'sizzle', 'reel', 'clips', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'perfect', 'cure', 'insomnia.Unfortunately', 'footage', 'was', 'indicator', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'dollars', 'spent', 're-shoots', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'John', 'Carter', 'less', 'boring', 'incomprehensible', 'drag', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'famous', 'adventure', 'author', 'creator', 'Tarzan', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'tree', 'saw', 'what', 'become', 'nearly', 'century', 'old', 'Barsoom', 'novels', 'Based', 'first', 'series', 'A', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'film', 'led', 'charisma-free', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'showing', 'none', 'snap', 'glimpsed', 'when', 'played', 'Gambit', 'otherwise', 'terrible', 'Wolverine', 'film', 'John', 'Carter', 'emotionless', 'cypher', 'former', 'captain', 'Confederate', 'army', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stay', 'trouble', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'notes', 'left', 'behind', 'young', 'Burroughs', 'Daryl', 'Sabara', 'read', 'author', 'began', 'nearly', 'Barsoom', 'novels', 'way', 'clever', 'little', 'twist', 'Carter', 'space', 'faring', 'adventures', 'were', 'real', 'were', 'simply', 'discovering', 'interminably', 'long', 'setup', 'Carter', 'mysteriously', 'whisked', 'away', 'planet', 'Mars', 'where', 'presumably', 'action', 'begins.Instead', 'what', 'actually', 'get', 'string', 'poorly', 'realized', 'characters', 'convoluted', 'back', 'stories', 'droning', 'sort', 'civil', 'war', 'Known', 'Barsoom', 'natives', 'world', 'bone', 'dry', 'Tatooine', 'segments', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'only', 'less', 'pod', 'racing', 'like', 'imagine', 'Waterworld', 'water', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'lame', 'place', 'also', 'indication', 'level', 'convoluted', 'political', 'maneuvering', ""'re"", 'likely', 'face', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'Sab', 'Than', 'Dominic', 'West', 'Zodangans', 'people', 'Helium', 'including', 'badly', 'dressed', 'king', 'depressed', 'looking', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'marry', 'feisty', 'very', 'busty', 'princess', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'scheme', 'devised', 'bunch', 'bald', 'headed', 'mystical', 'shapeshifters', 'Throw', 'alien', 'Tharks', 'few', 'white', 'apes', 'random', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'what', 'have', 'action', 'movie', 'so', 'convoluted', 'Inception', 'look', 'Yogi', 'Bear.It', 'not', 'plot', 'deep', 'just', 'impossible', 'tell', 'who', 'anybody', 'what', 'angle', 'will', 'care', 'Carter', 'everyone', 'sort', 'messiah', 'can', 'jump', 'really', 'far', 'Imagine', 'what', 'Hulk', 'could', 'do', 'gravity', 'Pointless', 'questions', 'will', 'infect', 'brain', 'nothing', 'happening', 'screen', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'exorbitant', 'cost', ""'d"", 'think', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'something', 'more', 'lively', 'bunch', 'unimpressive', 'lizards', 'mountain', 'landscapes', 'Stanton', 'Pixar', 'vet', 'who', 'directed', 'less', 'amazing', 'Wall-E', 'tripped', 'up', 'source', 'material', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'live-action', 'success', 'colleague', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'did', 'Mission', 'Impossible-Ghost', 'Protocol', 'John', 'Carter', 'too', 'closely', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'sadly', 'ironic', 'considering', 'Burroughs', 'novels', 'were', 'impetus', 'so', 'many']",N/A

1468496,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIH2W,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 10]","Perhaps you have already read about the disappointing performance of Disney's sci-fi adventure ""John Carter"" at the box office. I don't know who is responsible for that, but I know for sure that the film itself is not to be blamed. It is overlong, I admit, but ""John Carter"" is actually a pretty enjoyable adventure movie with stunning visuals and effective performances from the leads Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins.A Civil War veteran John Carter's adventures and romance on Mars, or ""Barsoom,"" is very famous. Transported to the red planet (the film describes the process in detail), Carter fights with his super-jumping ability and falls in love with a beautiful princess of Mars. No wonder it took so long (100 years to be exact) for the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic story to be made into a film - a film of this scale, which needs imagination, storytelling skills, visuals and someone who can play John Carter.Taylor Kitsch is perfect as the hero, and so is Lynn Collins as a Princess of Mars Dejah Thoris, but it is Carter's ever faithful pet Woola that steals the show. The combat scenes are to me a bit too fast and busy, but they are still exciting with first-rate special effects. Some characters' motives are not convincing, but the slick narrative almost makes us forget that.""John Carter"" (or ""John Carter of Mars"") is flawed. First of all, it needs a better title. This is the first live-action film by Andrew Stanton (""WALL-E""), acclaimed director whose excellent use of visuals is seen here, but not his tight narrative style.That said, ""John Carter"" is a very good sci-fi action film, much better than you are led to believe by negative reviews and disappointing box office results.",4,John Carter and Princess of Mars; Thrilling Adventure Movie,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,1700,"['Perhaps', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'disappointing', 'performance', 'Disney', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'John', 'Carter', 'box', 'office', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'responsible', 'know', 'sure', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'overlong', 'admit', 'John', 'Carter', 'actually', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'adventure', 'movie', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'effective', 'performances', 'leads', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Lynn', 'Collins.A', 'Civil', 'War', 'veteran', 'John', 'Carter', 'adventures', 'romance', 'Mars', 'Barsoom', 'very', 'famous', 'Transported', 'red', 'planet', 'film', 'process', 'detail', 'Carter', 'fights', 'super-jumping', 'ability', 'love', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'Mars', 'wonder', 'took', 'so', 'long', '100', 'years', 'be', 'exact', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'classic', 'story', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'film', 'scale', 'imagination', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'visuals', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'John', 'Carter.Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'perfect', 'hero', 'so', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Carter', 'ever', 'faithful', 'pet', 'Woola', 'show', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'fast', 'busy', 'are', 'still', 'exciting', 'first-rate', 'special', 'effects', 'characters', 'motives', 'are', 'not', 'convincing', 'slick', 'narrative', 'almost', 'forget', 'John', 'Carter', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'flawed', 'First', 'all', 'better', 'title', 'first', 'live-action', 'film', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'WALL-E', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'excellent', 'use', 'visuals', 'seen', 'here', 'not', 'tight', 'narrative', 'style.That', 'said', 'John', 'Carter', 'very', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'negative', 'reviews', 'disappointing', 'box', 'office', 'results']",N/A
1468497,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B005LAIH2W,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 3]","I sort of like this movie, and yet I don't like it and I wish I did. I guess I just feel ambiguous about it. I can appreciate it intellectually, but I can't FEEL for it.It is a conundrum, wrapped in an enigma, with a mystery.The conundrum is why don't I feel more about this film... why didn't it move me as it should have?The enigma is why Disney produced it under their name (instead of Touchstone or another of their properties) -- implying this is a type of ""kids"" movie or family entertainment (which it isn't), and why did it fail in the Box Office and among critics and so many film goers?The mystery is how all the amazing talent that went into this fell so flat on screen.Pros:Very Lavish Production - sets and scenery are excellent, CGI work top notch and seamless.Good Actors - convincing us that they are the characters they portray.Fast Paced Action - plenty of action scenes - in fact these are what help hold the movie together.Relatively Faithful to the Source - based on the ERB ""Princess of Mars"" and other John Carter series of books. Follows the basic plot of POM with some elements from later books thrown in.Cons:Lavish Production is Eye Candy - While the sets are excellent, we get no reason WHY they are what they are. We see everything in very fast cut scenes (including the characters) as if the camera is afraid to linger on a scene long enough for our eyes to focus.Little or No Character (and possibly actor) Chemistry - It didn't seem like the characters really cared for or about each other. Carter and the Princess are at odds only because they have different goals. We don't know what they FEEL about each other or much of anything else. Tars Tarkas is interested in John Carter because he can jump? Huh? There's got to be more. Okay Tars is a CGI character but other films have paired CGI with live characters with a lot more chemistry.Fast Paced Action Too Fast - The camera never stops to linger on anything, it just keeps moving around so we don't see anything in detail or depth. We see lot's of battle scenes with hand to hand combat in what is supposed to be an advanced civilization. Huh? The Tharks have guns, but the people of Helium and Zodanga have swords? Why?Relatively Faithful to the Source - ERB wrote the John Carter series starting as a novel that was later turned into a magazine serial. It was designed to keep readers buying the magazine to read the next installment. In this genre, character is weak and adventure and suspense are high. That's what the audience expects for this type of literature.  The movie seems to follow that approach, which makes it a bit of an empty film. It didn't translate to screen well and lost what made the books appealing. How did they manage this?Pointless Back Story - Why did they put in the back story about ERB as a real person being the nephew of a real life John Carter? It wasn't necessary! The novel explains why JC goes to Mars and comes back several times, perfectly well. The movie could have eliminated the back story, been shorter and less confusing if it simply followed the book better. Having someone appear as ERB in the movie didn't add credibility for me, it seemed to be a cheap attempt at getting credibility -- as if the producers knew the movie wasn't going to fly on its own.------------------------Overall, the movie has all the parts of a good well crafted film, but they didn't hold together for me. I didn't feel any sympathy for John Carter until well into the film when we are FINALLY shown why he is so empty headed - that he lost his wife and child in some sort of attack by someone or other who burn down his house while he is away doing something or other. Action without reason leads to a cognitive disconnect. If this part of the movie (it wasn't in the books) was closer to the beginning (in fact, it could have replaced the back story) we'd have some sympathy for the character from the outset. Instead, Carter comes off as obnoxious for no apparent reason other than he is an idiot. People generally do have motivations for being who they are. The film should have gotten this underway a lot sooner.John and the Princess Dejah Thoris are at odds with each other throughout most of the film. They have different goals. Carter wants to get back to Earth, Thoris wants to save her city of Helium from being overtaken by Zodanga. This was never in the original book, but it could work today as a motivation. Thoris misses what should have been obvious, that she has to motivate Carter into coming to her aid (apparently because he can jump over tall buildings... not sure why this is a great advantage). If the film had developed her character into more of this type of leadership, she could have helped Carter go through a necessary catharsis (i.e. recover a motivation for living a full life) about his family loss and develop as a character. She could have been more passionate about her Helium and her hatred of Zodanga. We just don't get much of anything. It's not the actor at fault here, the script doesn't have the content for her to work with.We are looking at an alien world with fascinating looking beings and an alien culture. ERB did give them good descriptions and it appears that the movie follows that. But ERB also gave the Tharks and others a sense of motivation. They had a reason for their wanderings in the Martian desert (to gather their young hatchlings - which gets done in a few minutes towards the start of the film). Tars Tarkis is a leader among his people in the book, and there, we understand why. In the book, Carter learns about the Tharks, how they live, and why they do what they do. There is chemistry. Unfortunately in this movie, we just see THAT they exist without any reason other than to fight among themselves and get caught up in the war between Helium and Zodanga.Admittedly, the novel wasn't ""deep"", and was mostly about fighting among the peoples of the planet. That was in 1911. We have advanced somewhat since then, and the movie could have added some substance to the story. They tried with the introduction of the mysterious manipulators/villains the Thern, but I think it was the wrong way to go. They just are annoying meddlers. They could have been much more interesting, if they had a reason for being in the movie. But like all the characters, they are there, with no real reason.I found myself thinking of the very first Star Wars. It's not good when one movie makes you think of another! But all that made Star Wars good seems to have fallen flat in John Carter.In SW, we have the character of R2D2. He looks like a vacuum cleaner, has no comprehensible dialog, yet he becomes one of the most endearing characters in the series. In Carter we have the Woola, a dog-like thing which basically serves a similar cinematic purpose. Only it doesn't quite work. There is no interaction between the Woola and Cater to explain the animal's devotion to him.In SW we got Chewbacca the Wookie. He's large, furry, makes no linguistic sense (he can't speak words) but we love him because of himself. In Carter we have Tars Tarkas. He's large, green and he CAN make linguistic sense, but who cares? We never get any chemistry from him, any message, any motivation, and he was voiced by one of the best actors in Hollywood, Willem Dafoe. What the heck happened?In SW we have a Princess, Leia, who is trying to save her world. She's annoying perhaps, but spunky and feisty and we really like her. In Carter, we have Thoris, also a Princess, but she has no spunk, no energy and who really cares? She's beautiful (much more than Leia) and seems to be eye candy more than character.It is probably unfair to compare Carter with Star Wars - but it begs the question... what did Lukas do right, that the folks at Disney missed? And HOW did they miss it? Lukas had to invent the entire Star Wars Universe. Disney had it handed to them on a platter by ERB and somehow they still missed the boat!The John Cater books were highly successful and lasting. People still read and enjoy them today more than 100 years after they first appeared. The source material has a loyal audience. HOW did this movie lose out on all that?---------------------Conclusion:John Carter as a film is worth a look simply because it is the first attempt to capture the ERB JC Mars novels on screen.It has a good look, but not much else.So I'd suggest a cheap rental (like for $3.99 which Amazon isn't currently offering) because it helps you spend 2 hours wondering - what was Disney thinking?I can't say I liked the movie, I can't say I didn't like the movie.All I can do is ask, how did it fall so flat when they had ALL the pieces to make a really great film?Mildly entertaining, but nothing to get excited over.Sorry Disney. You've done such good films in the past.Pity this one came off as such a dud.",3,John Carter Leaves More Questions Than Answers - on All Levels,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,8836,"['sort', 'movie',

1468499,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B005LAIH2W,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","George Lucas in his creation of STAR WARS, James Cameron in his creation of AVATAR, the creators of Buck Rogers, the creators of Flash Gordon, and countless other writers and film directors for almost a century owe a tremendous amount of gratitude to Edgar Rice Burroughs and his Barsoom Chronicles (beginning with A PRINCESS OF MARS , first published under a different title in a short story in 1912). Burroughs is best known for creating Tarzan. However, Burroughs dabbled in several different genres, including science fiction. The most popular of these were the Barsoom Chronicles which feature John Carter and his descendants. After discovering John Carter a few years ago, I had looked forward to a major motion picture based upon Burrough's story. A PRINCESS OF MARS was a novel I toyed with transcribing into a screenplay of my own. Then, in the fall of 2011, I discover the story was being developed into a big-budget picture that was being directed by Andrew Stanton (director of FINDING NEMO and WALL-E) and co-written by literary darling Michael Chabon (author of THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY). So, I put my own desires aside to see what kind of John Carter movie would be made. The final result is a great action movie and one of the best movies of 2012.The movie begins on Earth in 1881. John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is being followed by an unknown tracker. He succeeds in getting to the telegraph office to send a telegraph to his nephew, Edgar Burroughs, who shows up only to discover that his uncle has passed away and has made him the sole heir of his estate. One of the items left behind is Carter's personal journal which Burroughs begins reading.The book flashbacks thirteen years to 1868. John Carter is a former decorated Confederate calvaryman who just wants to work in his mine in the dessert and dig for gold. However, the U.S. government wants Carter to work for them. Carter ends up getting chased and finds himself in a cave filled with gold before being immediately transported to some strange place. Carter is discovered by a race of giant, green, four-armed aliens who are outsiders in a civil war between two separate races of people. During a skirmish in the sky, Carter saves a woman who turns out to be Princess Dejah (Lynn Collins). The Princess will do anything to save her people, but her father wants her to marry the leader of the opposing army. She would, but she believes the marriage will ultimately lead to the destruction of the entire planet. Like the green aliens that discovered him, she believes he is the key to turning the tide and saving Barsoom (Mars).I was completely enthralled by JOHN CARTER. I loved the framing device at the beginning and ending of the movie. I loved the action sequences. I love the romance between Carter and Princess Dejah. I loved the bonding relationship that occurs between Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and Sola (Samantha Morton) after she learns she is his daughter. I love the playfulness of the giant dog-like creature Woola and his devotion to Carter. This is an action movie, but the acting is solid and the script is well-written.As far as flaws, the film doesn't have many. The movie does jump around here at the beginning and some filmgoers might have difficulty understanding exactly what is happening where. Also, I felt that the flashback sequences to Carter's wife and child were misplaced: they either should have been developed more or completely cut. Lastly, although most of the special effects in the movie are seamless, there is one scene that isn't. This scene occurs about two-thirds of the way through the movie where John Carter is driving beneath the moving city; some of the shots in this sequence look computer-generated and stand out.JOHN CARTER is a welcome surprise. Disney completely dropped the ball in the marketing department (thanks in part to the failure in 2011 of MARS NEEDS MOMS) with this movie because the ad campaign for the picture is one of the worst I've ever seen for a major motion picture. Hopefully, word of mouth will cause the movie to succeed where marketing and advertising executives failed because JOHN CARTER is the best movie of the first three months of 2012.",5,A Sci-fi Movie 100 Years in the Making,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,4209,"['George', 'Lucas', 'creation', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'James', 'Cameron', 'creation', 'AVATAR', 'creators', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'creators', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'countless', 'other', 'writers', 'film', 'directors', 'almost', 'century', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'gratitude', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Barsoom', 'Chronicles', 'beginning', 'A', 'PRINCESS', 'OF', 'MARS', 'first', 'published', 'different', 'title', 'short', 'story', '1912', 'Burroughs', 'best', 'known', 'creating', 'Tarzan', 'However', 'Burroughs', 'dabbled', 'several', 'different', 'genres', 'including', 'science', 'fiction', 'most', 'popular', 'were', 'Barsoom', 'Chronicles', 'feature', 'John', 'Carter', 'descendants', 'discovering', 'John', 'Carter', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'looked', 'forward', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'based', 'Burrough', 'story', 'PRINCESS', 'OF', 'MARS', 'was', 'novel', 'toyed', 'transcribing', 'screenplay', 'own', 'Then', 'fall', '2011', 'discover', 'story', 'was', 'being', 'developed', 'big-budget', 'picture', 'was', 'being', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'director', 'FINDING', 'NEMO', 'WALL-E', 'co-written', 'literary', 'darling', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'author', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'KAVALIER', 'AND', 'CLAY', 'So', 'put', 'own', 'desires', 'aside', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'John', 'Carter', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'final', 'result', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2012.The', 'movie', 'begins', 'Earth', '1881', 'John', 'Carter', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'being', 'followed', 'unknown', 'tracker', 'getting', 'telegraph', 'office', 'send', 'telegraph', 'nephew', 'Edgar', 'Burroughs', 'who', 'up', 'only', 'discover', 'uncle', 'passed', 'away', 'made', 'sole', 'heir', 'estate', 'One', 'items', 'left', 'behind', 'Carter', 'personal', 'journal', 'Burroughs', 'reading.The', 'book', 'flashbacks', 'thirteen', 'years', '1868', 'John', 'Carter', 'former', 'decorated', 'Confederate', 'calvaryman', 'who', 'just', 'work', 'mine', 'dessert', 'dig', 'gold', 'However', 'U.S.', 'government', 'Carter', 'work', 'Carter', 'up', 'getting', 'chased', 'cave', 'filled', 'gold', 'being', 'immediately', 'transported', 'strange', 'place', 'Carter', 'discovered', 'race', 'giant', 'green', 'four-armed', 'aliens', 'who', 'are', 'outsiders', 'civil', 'war', 'two', 'separate', 'races', 'people', 'skirmish', 'sky', 'Carter', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Princess', 'Dejah', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'Princess', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'people', 'father', 'marry', 'leader', 'opposing', 'army', 'would', 'marriage', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'destruction', 'entire', 'planet', 'green', 'aliens', 'discovered', 'key', 'turning', 'tide', 'saving', 'Barsoom', 'Mars', '.I', 'was', 'completely', 'enthralled', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'loved', 'framing', 'device', 'beginning', 'ending', 'movie', 'loved', 'action', 'sequences', 'love', 'romance', 'Carter', 'Princess', 'Dejah', 'loved', 'bonding', 'relationship', 'Tars', 'Tarkas', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Sola', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'daughter', 'love', 'playfulness', 'giant', 'dog-like', 'creature', 'Woola', 'devotion', 'Carter', 'action', 'movie', 'acting', 'solid', 'script', 'well-written.As', 'far', 'flaws', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'movie', 'jump', 'here', 'beginning', 'filmgoers', 'might', 'have', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'where', 'Also', 'felt', 'flashback', 'Carter', 'wife', 'child', 'were', 'misplaced', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'completely', 'cut', 'Lastly', 'most', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'seamless', 'one', 'scene', ""n't"", 'scene', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'where', 'John', 'Carter', 'driving', 'moving', 'city', 'shots', 'sequence', 'look', 'computer-generated', 'stand', 'out.JOHN', 'CARTER', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'Disney', 'completely', 'dropped', 'ball', 'marketing', 'department', 'thanks', 'part', 'failure', '2011', 'MARS', 'NEEDS', 'MOMS', 'movie', 'ad', 'campaign', 'picture', 'one', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Hopefully', 'word', 'mouth', 'will', 'cause', 'movie', 'succeed', 'where', 'marketing', 'advertising', 'executives', 'failed', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'best', 'movie', 'first', 'three', 'months', '2012']",N/A

I mean really, truly terrible. Second, for whatever reason, the media practically crucified this movie up to three months before it even premiered. I heard reports that this film was destined to flop before I even knew what it was called. For reasons I still can't fathom, no one in the media was on this films side. They didn't give this film a snow balls chance, much less the benefit of the doubt. Completely ignoring whether or not the film was good, they continually harped on how much it cost to make. As detrimental as that was to the movies eventual release, it is the first reason that really sealed ""John Carter""'s fate.I can honestly say that I have never seen marketing this bad. The first trailer I saw for John Carter was a silent clip that showed no film footage and told me nothing about the film. As the weeks rolled by, things did not improve. The few commercials I saw made it look like a conan the barbarian rip off. Even the name ""John Carter"" hurt this great films chances of success. None of that matters though, because it is finally on DVD/Blu Ray and you can buy it for yourself, without having to wade though terrible ads and misleading media coverage.John Carter is about John Carters adventures on mars. I won't reveal more than that. The characters in this film aren't too deep, but they are enjoyable. The main antagonists are never fully explained, but they are no less effective because of it. The effects in this film are some of the best I have ever seen, and if you have a hd capable television, you are in for a treat.John Carter deserved to be a hit in the theaters.

1468505,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B005LAIH2W,V. Berk,"[0, 1]","John Carter. Did it deserve the fate it received at the box office?  I'm not entirely sure what the answer to that is, but I do know, for what it's worth, the movie is an enjoyable adventure flick deeply rooted in its pulp fiction source.A story of an ex-Confederate soldier who finds himself in the middle of a planet wide conflict on the surface of Mars is pure pulp fiction and in that respect I ate up every minute of John Carter.  I've always enjoyed these kind of stories and John Carter is elbows deep in its background as a pulp serial.  This is swashbuckling action with a sci-fi background, and if that's what you came to see you will not be disappointed.The special effects of John Carter are solid, although they do leave something to be desired knowing the film's immense $250 million production budget.  Don't get me wrong, many of the visuals are stunning, but there is nothing that immediately comes to mind when I think about John Carter.  Sure, watching the film scene by scene I can say ""That looks good"" but never was there anything that just made me say ""Wow!""  If I remember anything it's the design of the four-armed Tharks.Special effects don't make a movie, but the characters of John Carter leave a lot to be desired.  Taylor Kitsch lacks the necessary charisma to pull off his role and his chemistry with Dejah Thoris is non-existent.  Carter's alien allies Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and his daughter Sola (Samantha Morton) are probably my favorite characters in the film and it likely has more to do with their design than their writing.For the record: I have never read any of Edgar Wright Burroughs Barsoom novels.  I cannot say how this movie compares to A Princess of Mars or any other entry in the series.  As such I am not reviewing this movie as a fan.  It is my understanding that the movie has been divisive amongst the book series' fans mostly due to the fact that it compresses too much of A Princess of Mars's  plot into a relatively short running time.  That's just what I've heard.That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if this claim was accurate.  John Carter feels like a film that been cut down from a far longer running time and I am curious to know if a longer cut exists.  If Disney is ever willing to release an extended cut I am certainly willing to give it a watch.At the end of the day I'll say that Disney was in over their heads investing so heavily in this film.  I see no problem in adapting a source as old as John Carter, but it needed more memorable visuals, a charismatic lead, and some truly spectacular action sequences...but even then I don't think Disney should have sunk themselves so deep with this film's budget.John Carter is by no means a spectacular adventure movie, and Disney was in over their heads with the budget, but it is enjoyable for what it is.

Christie,"[26, 30]","I get the feeling that this fantastic and amazing movie was purposely ""assassinated"" by warring interfactional ""tribes"" or individuals within Disney itself. Also complicit in this murder were the pretentious critics who probably never read books as children and cannot comprehend a movie that reflects as best it can the incredible imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Imagine that this series of books was written in 1912, before any form of air travel existed on earth except for balloons. Yet Burroughs creates a world of sophisticated technology being used for baser instincts (war) and for sustaining all life on the planet. He created a planet with 2 equally intelligent species and illustrated how culture can determine the growth of each individual within that culture. And he created a smashing good story that has survived for 100 years. This movie was lovingly made with fine attention to incredible CGI effects that really places the viewer within the fantasy world of Mars that Burroughs created so long ago. The movie has adventure and great zest and charm. Some critics said there wasn't enough character development. Perhaps someone should tell them that Burroughs wrote adventure stories, not psychological thrillers. I truly loved this movie, and it pinged with a very small boy within myself who sat in the backyard in the summer immersed in the Burroughs series of John Carter related books. I feel great sadness for the vicious critics who somehow missed that phase of a child's life. If you like adventure set in a world of fantasy, you will love this movie. This movie deserves to be enjoyed and loved. I feel it will long outlive its negative critics that helped ensure it bombed in its movie distribution.

1468522,ARWCFLO1Q0XY9,B005LAIH2W,W. Foley,"[5, 6]","The movie was given to me as a gift for Father's Day and I was a little nervous wondering if I would really like it. I thought I would like it after seeing all of the trailers for the movies and many people online who said they liked it have enjoyed the movie for the same reasons I thought I would. They said it was a fun adventure that had some great special effects. However, it received mixed reviews upon release and it did not do well at the box office. After viewing it I have to say I really liked it!I am not going to go into great detail about the movie but I will say what I did and didn't like about the movie. In the beginning there is a short prolog that tells the story of the conflicts between the civilizations on Mars, known as Barsoom to the natives. I wish that part was just a little clearer because for a while it was confusing for me to understand who was who and what was going on. I also think the early part of the movie before John Carter arrives on Mars could have fleshed out his character a little better. However, once you are on Mars and the confusion clears up the movie is very enjoyable with good character development with both John Carter and Dejah Thoris, a Princess of Mars who must enter into an arranged marriage in order to resolve the global conflicts. When John Carter arrives on Mars he is captured by a very tall green skinned multi-limb race of humanoids called Tharks. This warrior tribe eventually assists John Carter in his aid to save Dejah Thoris. John Carter's character development is an essential part of the story as his motivation goes from wanting to leave Mars and return to Earth to falling in love with Dejah Thoris and wanting to rescue her and resolve the planet's civil discord.I found as the movie goes along it gets better and better and really becomes an exciting action and adventure movie. I don't want to put too many spoilers in my review but the movie did hit a slight snag for me toward the end. Spoiler alert for the next part if you haven't seen the film: When John Carter gets transported back to earth against his will, his journey to return to Mars seems rushed. It also resolves some of the confusion form the opening of the movie, which is in reality setting up the ending. Its not that this part of the movie was bad, it wasn't, its just that coming so late in the movie the pace of it seems hurried.I wanted to make a comment about leading actor Taylor Kitsch as John Carter. There have been some complaints that he has been miscast because he doesn't portray a larger than life persona one would want in a warrior hero. To some extent that is true. His screen presence is not the best. Yet in the framework of the film it works. He is supposed to be just an average guy that is placed in extraordinary circumstances. When John Carter defeats the Giant white gorillas and Tal Hajus you finally see the larger than life warrior emerge. As I stated that is later in the film. All in all Taylor Kitsch is fine for the role of John Carter.Although I really enjoyed the movie it does have some flaws, which all movies do, and I do not think that it is bad at all. The saddest part for me is that the ending sets us up for a sequel and the movie really cries for one but with the poor performance at the box office we will probably never see one.",4,Barsoom beckons!,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,3322,"['movie', 'was', 'given', 'gift', 'Father', 'Day', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'wondering', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'movies', 'many', 'people', 'online', 'who', 'said', 'liked', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'same', 'reasons', 'thought', 'would', 'said', 'was', 'fun', 'adventure', 'had', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'However', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'release', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'viewing', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'beginning', 'short', 'prolog', 'story', 'conflicts', 'civilizations', 'Mars', 'known', 'Barsoom', 'natives', 'wish', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'clearer', 'while', 'was', 'confusing', 'understand', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'also', 'think', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'could', 'have', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'little', 'better', 'However', 'once', 'are', 'Mars', 'confusion', 'up', 'movie', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'John', 'Carter', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'who', 'must', 'enter', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'order', 'resolve', 'global', 'conflicts', 'When', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'captured', 'very', 'tall', 'green', 'skinned', 'multi-limb', 'race', 'humanoids', 'called', 'Tharks', 'warrior', 'tribe', 'eventually', 'John', 'Carter', 'aid', 'save', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'John', 'Carter', 'character', 'development', 'essential', 'part', 'story', 'motivation', 'wanting', 'leave', 'Mars', 'return', 'Earth', 'falling', 'love', 'Dejah', 'Thoris', 'wanting', 'rescue', 'resolve', 'planet', 'civil', 'discord.I', 'found', 'movie', 'better', 'better', 'really', 'exciting', 'action', 'adventure', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'review', 'movie', 'did', 'hit', 'slight', 'snag', 'end', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'next', 'part', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'When', 'John', 'Carter', 'transported', 'back', 'earth', 'will', 'journey', 'return', 'Mars', 'rushed', 'also', 'confusion', 'form', 'opening', 'movie', 'reality', 'setting', 'up', 'ending', 'not', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'coming', 'so', 'late', 'movie', 'pace', 'hurried.I', 'wanted', 'make', 'comment', 'leading', 'actor', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'John', 'Carter', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'been', 'miscast', ""n't"", 'portray', 'larger', 'life', 'persona', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'warrior', 'hero', 'extent', 'true', 'screen', 'presence', 'not', 'best', 'framework', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'just', 'average', 'guy', 'placed', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'When', 'John', 'Carter', 'Giant', 'white', 'gorillas', 'Tal', 'Hajus', 'finally', 'see', 'larger', 'life', 'warrior', 'emerge', 'stated', 'later', 'film', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'fine', 'role', 'John', 'Carter.Although', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'have', 'flaws', 'movies', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'bad', 'saddest', 'part', 'ending', 'sets', 'up', 'sequel', 'movie', 'really', 'cries', 'one', 'poor', 'performance', 'box', 'office', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'one']",N/A

1468531,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B005LAIH2W,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[26, 27]","""John Carter"" was so brutally savaged by most critics that I felt I was taking a chance buying the four-disk set (which I got at a very good price). Well, it's a delightful, highly entertaining film.Unlike the dreadful ""Flash Gordon"", ""John Carter"" respects its source. The tone is serious, without arch or campy humor. The story is treated as romantic fantasy, which is what it is. (Michael Giacchino's excellent score sets the right mood.) Though there's a fair amount of action, it's not excessive or gratuitous. The focus is principally on the characters. The ending is highly satisfying, and //almost// draws a tear. Almost.Taylor Kitsch (an unfortunate name for the star of a fantasy film!) isn't a great actor, but he's more than competent. His height (IMDB says he's 6', but he looks a lot shorter) and wiry build make him a believable 19th-century soldier.One assumes Roger Ebert's readers are more-perceptive than the average movie-goer, so it's notable that the viewer rating on Ebert's site is 3 out of 4 stars.Once people who didn't see ""John Carter"" in the theater see it on home video, they'll talk it up. ""John Carter"" is a good film that needs no apology, and will eventually be considered a classic fantasy.-------------------------------------------ADDENDUM (""PS"" seemed weak)... It's rare to see a film receive such wildly varying audience reviews: ""A masterpiece!"" is followed by ""It's garbage!"". We all think we have better taste/judgment than those who disagree with us. Being no different, I feel obliged to stick in another two cents.No doubt fanboys (of which I an /not/ one) like films such as ""John Carter"" simply because they're acceptable adaptations of a favorite story. Then there are those who detest such films because they don't like the genre, or they find fault with (what they perceive as) ""bad"" acting/writing/direction.My all-time favorite film is the magnificently acted and directed ""Amadeus"". (Peter Shaffer's screenplay is merely ""excellent"". The acting and direction raise it to a perceived level of superbativeness.) I just got the DVD of ""The Apostle"", Robert Duvall's tour-de-force of writing, acting, and directing, to replace my LV copy. I'll be taking a course in screenwriting at TheFilmSchool in July (yes, really), and wanted to watch it at least once again. (If you haven't seen this film, /do so/.) I think I know the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"", writing-, acting-, and directing-wise.What, exactly, were the ""John Carter"" haters expecting? It's taken from pulp novels written by a man who felt he could churn out fiction at least as rotten (his word) as the cheap stuff he was reading. The film spends 1/7 its running time giving John Carter a backstory, so we know why he acts as he does. The story plays out as drama (though a weak one); the characters' personalities and interactions are generally plausible. (I don't know how much Michael Chabon contributed, but it's hard to believe he wouldn't have tried to push what is basically an action/adventure tale in the direction of a character-driven story.)""John Carter"" avoids some of the clich&eacute;s of romantic fiction. Carter might be a great sword-swinger, but he won't fight other people's battles. (This is why some viewers incorrectly perceive him as a ""pacifist"".) And as Carter still pines for his wife, do you expect him to immediately start drooling over Ms Thoris's thorax? (Though the humanoid Martians are mammalian, the script wisely avoids revealing that they lay eggs. Deejah Thoris is kin to the duck-billed platypus.)I'll agree with the naysayers in one respect... Over the past 30 years, American films have become increasingly cool and  affectless, losing the intense emotions of Hollywood's Golden Age. (Had Michael Curtiz directed ""John Carter"", there would have been fewer objections.) It's also true that effects-heavy films can make it hard for directors to keep the focus on the characters, rather than which shots have to be completed that day. I don't like this, but what's a viewer supposed to do? Reject such films altogether?Is ""John Carter"" a great (in the absolute sense) film? Of course not. Is it a bad film? Emphatically no. Could it have been better? Definitely. It is what it is -- a well-made adaptation of cheap fiction. If you don't like the latter, fine -- but don't blame the film for being an honest representation of its source.",4,an outstanding fantasy film,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,4394,"['John', 'Carter', 'was', 'so', 'brutally', 'savaged', 'most', 'critics', 'felt', 'was', 'taking', 'chance', 'buying', 'four-disk', 'set', 'got', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'Well', 'delightful', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'dreadful', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'John', 'Carter', 'source', 'tone', 'serious', 'arch', 'campy', 'humor', 'story', 'treated', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'what', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'excellent', 'score', 'right', 'mood', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'not', 'excessive', 'gratuitous', 'focus', 'principally', 'characters', 'ending', 'highly', 'satisfying', '//almost//', 'tear', 'Almost.Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'unfortunate', 'name', 'star', 'fantasy', 'film', ""n't"", 'great', 'actor', 'more', 'competent', 'height', 'IMDB', '6', 'lot', 'shorter', 'wiry', 'build', 'make', 'believable', '19th-century', 'soldier.One', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'readers', 'are', 'more-perceptive', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'notable', 'viewer', 'rating', 'Ebert', 'site', '3', '4', 'stars.Once', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'John', 'Carter', 'theater', 'see', 'home', 'video', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'up', 'John', 'Carter', 'good', 'film', 'apology', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'fantasy.', '-ADDENDUM', 'PS', 'seemed', 'weak', 'rare', 'see', 'film', 'receive', 'such', 'wildly', 'varying', 'audience', 'reviews', 'masterpiece', 'followed', 'garbage', 'think', 'have', 'better', 'taste/judgment', 'who', 'disagree', 'Being', 'different', 'feel', 'obliged', 'stick', 'two', 'cents.No', 'doubt', '/not/', 'one', 'films', 'such', 'John', 'Carter', 'simply', ""'re"", 'acceptable', 'adaptations', 'favorite', 'story', 'Then', 'are', 'who', 'detest', 'such', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'genre', 'find', 'fault', 'what', 'perceive', 'bad', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'film', 'magnificently', 'acted', 'directed', 'Amadeus', 'Peter', 'Shaffer', 'screenplay', 'merely', 'excellent', 'acting', 'direction', 'raise', 'perceived', 'level', 'superbativeness', 'just', 'got', 'DVD', 'Apostle', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'tour-de-force', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'replace', 'LV', 'copy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'taking', 'course', 'screenwriting', 'TheFilmSchool', 'July', 'yes', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', '/do', 'so/', 'think', 'know', 'difference', 'good', 'bad', 'writing-', 'acting-', 'directing-wise.What', 'exactly', 'were', 'John', 'Carter', 'haters', 'expecting', 'taken', 'pulp', 'novels', 'written', 'man', 'who', 'felt', 'could', 'churn', 'out', 'fiction', 'least', 'rotten', 'word', 'cheap', 'stuff', 'was', 'reading', 'film', '1/7', 'running', 'time', 'giving', 'John', 'Carter', 'backstory', 'know', 'why', 'story', 'out', 'drama', 'weak', 'one', 'characters', 'personalities', 'interactions', 'are', 'generally', 'plausible', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'contributed', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'tried', 'push', 'what', 'basically', 'action/adventure', 'tale', 'direction', 'character-driven', 'story', 'John', 'Carter', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'romantic', 'fiction', 'Carter', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'sword-swinger', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fight', 'other', 'people', 'battles', 'why', 'viewers', 'incorrectly', 'perceive', 'pacifist', 'Carter', 'still', 'wife', 'do', 'expect', 'immediately', 'start', 'drooling', 'Ms', 'Thoris', 'thorax', 'humanoid', 'Martians', 'are', 'mammalian', 'script', 'wisely', 'revealing', 'lay', 'eggs', 'Deejah', 'Thoris', 'kin', 'duck-billed', 'platypus', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'naysayers', 'one', 'respect', 'past', '30', 'years', 'American', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'increasingly', 'cool', 'affectless', 'losing', 'intense', 'emotions', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Had', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'directed', 'John', 'Carter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fewer', 'objections', 'also', 'true', 'effects-heavy', 'films', 'can', 'make', 'hard', 'directors', 'keep', 'focus', 'characters', 'rather', 'shots', 'have', 'be', 'completed', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'do', 'Reject', 'such', 'films', 'altogether', 'John', 'Carter', 'great', 'absolute', 'sense', 'film', 'course', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'Emphatically', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Definitely', 'what', 'well-made', 'adaptation', 'cheap', 'fiction', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'latter', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'film', 'being', 'honest', 'representation', 'source']",N/A

My partner thought it was terribly cliche - but that's because other movies, from Star Wars, Avatar to Prince of Persia, borrowed freely from it.  This is the original sci-fi swashbuckling fantasy adventure.  I liked it even more the second time I watched it, with the subtitles on, so that I could catch all the dialogue and names.  The green Tharks are smoothly done.  The overall feel of the sets is authentic - not too glossy, and very similar to the original Star Wars trilogy, actually.  I liked the desert cultures, the multi-legged animals, the red Martian's clothing, and the dog-like creature.  I liked the Princess of Mars the most - she's a strong fighter AND a scientist! Taylor Kitsch was the weak point (very bad facial hair and hairstyle) but once I ignored that the movie improved greatly.  I'm going to start reading the books now.",5,Fun movie,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,927,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'based', '1912', 'book', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'My', 'partner', 'thought', 'was', 'terribly', 'cliche', 'other', 'movies', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Avatar', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'borrowed', 'freely', 'original', 'sci-fi', 'swashbuckling', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'liked', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'subtitles', 'could', 'catch', 'dialogue', 'names', 'green', 'Tharks', 'are', 'smoothly', 'done', 'overall', 'feel', 'sets', 'authentic', 'not', 'too', 'glossy', 'very', 'similar', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'actually', 'liked', 'desert', 'cultures', 'multi-legged', 'animals', 'red', 'Martian', 'clothing', 'dog-like', 'creature', 'liked', 'Princess', 'Mars', 'most', 'strong', 'fighter', 'scientist', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'was', 'weak', 'point', 'very', 'bad', 'facial', 'hair', 'hairstyle', 'once', 'ignored', 'movie', 'improved', 'greatly', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'reading', 'books', 'now']",N/A

1468535,A95A9XOSHTQKX,B005LAIH2W,"YeahSoMaybe? ""computersandmusicperson""","[8, 10]","The hatred to this movie by the critics seemed like some kind of self-congratulating schadenfreude bandwagon.  Due to all the FUD put out by the critics and others (the hype about how expensive it was and how it was a flop)  I didn't see this in theaters.  I finally rented it on Amazon download (HD).  I was pleasantly surprised.  I found it to be an entertaining and worthwhile fun movie.ADDENDUM:  While I definitely liked the movie, I notice there is someone (or two) rabid fanboy posters who are copying and pasting the exact * same * comment throughout large parts of the discussion thread.  They may even be one and the same person (sock puppets?)  This kind of crap devalues and degrades the whole Amazon review discussion thread.  Please STOP.  If you liked the movie (and I did) then ...groovy.  Just trust this movie enough to let it stand on it's own and get a life... without pasting robotic comments throughout the entire discussion of this movie!  Don't badger me lobbying to write in for for a sequel.  It's really rude.  If I ever wanted a sequel the desire for it will come within me and not from some outside manipulation.  Unlike fanboys, my identity doesn't come from this movie, it's just something I enjoyed.",4,Don't understand the smug contempt for this movie - I liked it,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,1231,"['hatred', 'movie', 'critics', 'seemed', 'kind', 'self-congratulating', 'schadenfreude', 'bandwagon', 'Due', 'FUD', 'put', 'out', 'critics', 'others', 'hype', 'how', 'expensive', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'flop', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'theaters', 'finally', 'rented', 'Amazon', 'download', 'HD', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'worthwhile', 'fun', 'movie.ADDENDUM', 'definitely', 'liked', 'movie', 'notice', 'someone', 'two', 'rabid', 'fanboy', 'posters', 'who', 'are', 'copying', 'pasting', 'exact', '*', 'same', '*', 'comment', 'large', 'parts', 'discussion', 'thread', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'one', 'same', 'person', 'sock', 'puppets', 'kind', 'crap', 'devalues', 'whole', 'Amazon', 'review', 'discussion', 'thread', 'Please', 'STOP', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', 'then', 'groovy', 'Just', 'trust', 'movie', 'enough', 'let', 'stand', 'own', 'get', 'life', 'pasting', 'robotic', 'comments', 'entire', 'discussion', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'badger', 'lobbying', 'write', 'sequel', 'really', 'rude', 'ever', 'wanted', 'sequel', 'desire', 'will', 'come', 'not', 'outside', 'manipulation', 'fanboys', 'identity', ""n't"", 'come', 'movie', 'just', 'something', 'enjoyed']",N/A
