925267,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AARKH6,Grady Harp,"[10, 10]","Quentin Lee is to be congratulated for taking on several controversial issues and blending them into a novel story that works on many levels.  While many writers and directors of Indie gay films focus on the downtrodden, bleak, tragic aspect of young gay lads coming to grips with their lives, few have presented stories that emphasize an element of redemption based on courage to change those things that can be changed.Ethan Mao (Jun Hee Lee) is an 18-year-old Chinese American boy who has been working (gratis) for his father Abe (Raymond Ma) all his life in their Chinese restaurant.  One evening at closing time a young man enters the negligently unlocked door and robs Ethan's cash register at gunpoint. Abe enters form the back of the restaurant and kills the robber, much to Ethan's chagrin.  This results in an angry confrontation (one of many in an Asian family where the children are supposed to always obey the parents).  Ethan is still mourning the loss of his mother and loathes his stepmother Sarah (Julia Nickson-Soul), a would-be actress who married Abe for money, bringing along her own son Josh (Kevin Kleinberg), a bright young man of obvious mixed genetic pool.  Ethan also has a younger brother Noel (David Tran) with whom he has a warm and strong bond.  Sarah discovers a gay magazine in Ethan's room, shares this with Abe, and Abe throws Ethan out of his home for being gay and shaming his family.Ethan, bitter, homeless and without money, begins a life a street hustler, accepting his passive sexual role with older johns as a means of income.  Serendipitously he meets Remigio (Jerry Hernandez), a fellow hustler and minor drug dealer who understands the life of an orphan's loneliness, and befriends Ethan and offers him shelter and affection.  Ethan decides to return to his home on Thanksgiving (knowing that his family always goes out of town on that day) to take his belongings and get some cash.  Remigio accompanies him and what begins as a simple entry into Ethan's empty home results in disaster as his family returns for a forgotten gift.  Ethan rages against them and decides to hold them hostage until morning when Abe can send Sarah to the bank to retrieve Ethan's mother's necklace - the only memento he has of her.  The crux of the story is how this tangled 'family' comes to different levels of understanding under duress and how Ethan (through this dream vs reality incident) arrives at forgiveness and finds love with the ever-supportive Remigio.The acting is mixed but the cast engages us and allows each chracter to morph into something better than we expect.  Both Jun Hee Lee and Jerry Hernandez bring credibility to their roles and the result is a palpable relationship which touches the viewers' hearts. While there are rough spots in camera work, in script, and in production, this is a strong little Indie film with a lot to say, dealing with positive images and debunking old prejudicial thoughts about sectors of society miscegenating into the fabric that makes our population more tolerant.

925268,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000AARKH6,Jeffery Mingo,"[8, 23]","I don't fault independent filmmakers with their low budgets for not producing what Hollywood can.  Still, this movie was just bad, bad, bad.  It starts off covering important issues like gay, Asian-American youth and presenting imagery that breaks the model minority myth.  Unfortunately, the plot reveals itself about 15 minutes into the film and things go down from there.  This movie was just tedious.  I couldn't wait for this to be over when I saw it.When great straight, Asian-American films (The Joy Luck Club, Better Luck Tomorrow, Masters of the Pillow) and great gay, Asian-proper films (Farewell My Concubine, Fire) have been made, then why make a BAD gay, Asian-American film?  This movie shows something rarely seen: a kiss between an Asian-American, male character and a LatinO character.  Still, instead of developing this unique coupling, things fall apart instantly to the disappointment of this viewer.  Additionally, I think some viewers may find the stepmother's role and representation misogynist.Don't let your liberal leanings lure you into wasting time or money on this.

925269,A6GPIYLINIYI4,B000AARKH6,"koji kumi ""kumi""","[3, 3]","Ethan Mao is a riveting and wonderful story in many ways.  The people who dislike this story probably have never been out of the mainstream straight society.  This movie is about how even in a well-to-do family, that you can become isolated, segregated, and even kicked out of the only family and way of life you have ever known, if you happen to be gay.  This movie shows how fragile life really is.  It also shows how vulnerable and confusing a teenagers life can be, especially a gay teenager.  At one point, Ethan even tries to commit suicide.{Which isn't a stretch considering that 30% of all teenage suicides are those of gay teens.  Also according to the department of health, gay men are 6 more times likely to commit suicide than their straight counterparts.)  If you have a teenager who may be gay, they need you a lot more than your other kids. Reach out to them, guide them, teach them how to live a happy, productive life surrounded by people they love, and most importantly; love them before its too late.The part in this movie that made Ethan a hero to me was when he was confronted by his father on his homosexuality, he did'nt lie about it. Being in the closet most of my life, I always felt I had to lie about my sexual orientation lest I be sent to military school so they can make a ""man out of me."" It's terrible to have to live your life a lie and I have suffered self-isolation and depression because of it.  Ethan told his father that was a part of him so his father kicked him out of the house and family.  Ethan basically had the choice to lie, or to become a street hustler without a pot to piss in.  He courageously chose the later.I think a parent has an inherent duty to love all their children. And I feel that because there is so much backlash from being gay, their gay children need a little more understanding , sensitivity and compassion than their straight kids would.  I also feel that as a step-parent, you have a duty to love your new spouses children, in the least, as you would  a good, and dear friend.  Hopefully one day, they will become just that.The love story in this movie was just that.  It was actually a pure, innocent, self sacrificing love that all people gay or straight should strive for.  Ethan meets Remigio on the streets and he is able to melt Ethan's  tough exterior to become his friend, protector,mentor, and his one true love.I thought the acting was superb on all accounts, but especially the acting of Jun Hee Lee was particularly stellar. In the beginning he is like any normal teen exploring their sexuality.  When he is abandoned by his father you feel his pain.  When you realize that he has worked in his fathers restaurant for free to support his cruel step-mothers selfish lifestyle you feel his rage.  When you see his step-mother continue to mock,torment, and stab him in the back, a lesser person would probably just blow her head off.  But deep in his heart Ethan is gentle, sweet, and vulnerable kid and your heart goes out to him because what is in his heart is pure and you know he just wants his father to accept and love him.  Jun Hee Lee portays all of these emotions sensitively and believably. This is a movie in which the ""criminal ""  is actually the hero.  Believe me, you will be rooting for Ethan all the way!I agree with most of the plot synopsis' that have been given by the favorable reviewers and also agree with a lot of their opinions.  But I do feel that the acting was great, and that the production values gave a realistic vibe to the movie.

The movie received a long ovation, which was well deserved. Afterward the director and two leading actors were most gracious in answering questions from the audience.  Gerry Hernandez, who portrays Remigio, is half Guatemalan and half Filipino, so the actors and director are all of Asian heritage. I have no idea what the previous writer is referring to with his rant that borders on a detachment from reality.
