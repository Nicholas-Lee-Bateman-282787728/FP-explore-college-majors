The story revolves around an outbreak of smallpox, and whereas this may seem fanciful, there was an outbreak in the UK in the early the sixties. The mix of serious and comedic characters is still there and the doctor and his wife have settled into the community. Due to the subject nature, some scenes are 'harder hitting' than in series one and, (without wanting to publish a spoiler or give the plot away), there is one scene in the later part of episode 4 that, although sensitively done, is so well conceived and brilliantly acted it will, if you have any soul, leave you emotionally drained. The BBC have recently shown series 3 of this gem of a programme, hopefully we will not have to wait quite as long for it to be released on DVD as we have for this series. Highly recommended.",5,Wonderful second series,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,941,"['excellent', 'first', 'series', 'more', 'same', 'great', 'acting', 'good', 'characterisation', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'strong', 'story', 'line', 'story', 'outbreak', 'smallpox', 'may', 'seem', 'fanciful', 'was', 'outbreak', 'UK', 'early', 'sixties', 'mix', 'serious', 'comedic', 'characters', 'still', 'doctor', 'wife', 'have', 'settled', 'community', 'Due', 'subject', 'nature', 'scenes', 'are', ""'harder"", 'hitting', 'series', 'one', 'wanting', 'publish', 'spoiler', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'one', 'scene', 'later', 'part', 'episode', '4', 'sensitively', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'conceived', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'will', 'have', 'soul', 'leave', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'BBC', 'have', 'recently', 'shown', 'series', '3', 'gem', 'programme', 'hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'wait', 'quite', 'long', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'have', 'series', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Indian Doctor: Series Two
