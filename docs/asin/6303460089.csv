Unfortunately, he does not get enough screen time; but then again, this movie doesn't do him justice. He is one of the two leading roles, and they do more talking about his character than you actually see his character. For example--his character is supposed to be a real evil guy and the main nemesis, yet you get more insight to all the other bad-guy characters more than you do Gary's character. And for a martial arts film, you hardly see him practicing and/or fighting. Gary should have turned down the role!!",3,This movie doesn't do Gary Daniels' justice.,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,613,"['have', 'good', 'majority', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'films', 'second', 'movie', 'bad', 'guy', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'then', 'again', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'one', 'two', 'leading', 'roles', 'do', 'more', 'talking', 'character', 'actually', 'see', 'character', 'example', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'real', 'evil', 'guy', 'main', 'nemesis', 'get', 'more', 'insight', 'other', 'bad-guy', 'characters', 'more', 'do', 'Gary', 'character', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'hardly', 'see', 'practicing', 'and/or', 'fighting', 'Gary', 'should', 'have', 'turned', 'down', 'role']",Heatseeker VHS

375747,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6303460089,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","Former actor/kickboxer Albert Pyun conceived and directed this futuristic kickboxing movie.  It's mainly just a series of well-staged kickboxing exhibitions, featuring some of the sports' most notable figures.  The plot (what little there is) focuses on the only human world champion kickboxer, played with little vitality by Keith Cooke.  One of the cyborg companies, helmed by villainous Tim Thomerson and Norbert Weisser, creates a real killing machine, played like a machine by the usually more reliable Gary Daniels.  Daniels' fans may be in for a shock as he is an out and out bad guy in this one.  Usually when good guys go bad, their performances do as well?  Anyway, to ensure that Daniels wins this corporate-sponsored tournament, they kidnap Cooke's manager/girl friend, and install a microchip in her neck which makes her go gaga if she doesn't behave--and the mean Weisser makes Jo train Daniels (which makes no sense).The required preliminaries produce the two finalists:  Cooke and Daniels, in a rather anticlimactic and unexciting match.There is some corporate satire here but overall it's all been done to death, and only the fighting sequences make it worth catching.",3,SIGH BORG ACTIONER,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,1185,"['Former', 'actor/kickboxer', 'Albert', 'Pyun', 'conceived', 'directed', 'futuristic', 'kickboxing', 'movie', 'mainly', 'just', 'series', 'well-staged', 'kickboxing', 'exhibitions', 'featuring', 'sports', 'most', 'notable', 'figures', 'plot', 'what', 'little', 'only', 'human', 'world', 'champion', 'kickboxer', 'played', 'little', 'vitality', 'Keith', 'Cooke', 'One', 'cyborg', 'companies', 'helmed', 'villainous', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'Norbert', 'Weisser', 'real', 'killing', 'machine', 'played', 'machine', 'usually', 'more', 'reliable', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'Daniels', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'shock', 'out', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'Usually', 'when', 'good', 'guys', 'go', 'bad', 'performances', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Anyway', 'ensure', 'Daniels', 'corporate-sponsored', 'tournament', 'kidnap', 'Cooke', 'manager/girl', 'friend', 'install', 'microchip', 'neck', 'go', 'gaga', ""n't"", 'behave', 'mean', 'Weisser', 'Jo', 'train', 'Daniels', 'sense', '.The', 'required', 'preliminaries', 'produce', 'two', 'finalists', 'Cooke', 'Daniels', 'rather', 'anticlimactic', 'unexciting', 'match.There', 'corporate', 'satire', 'here', 'overall', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'only', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'make', 'worth', 'catching']",Heatseeker VHS

But let me assure you this one is a true diamond. If your a big martial arts fan this lost video is the treasure that leads us to addictions.  Its a tounament style fighting movie with Keithe Cook and Gary Daniels in which the leading product in the world is cybernetic implants that make you look better and give you instant athlettasism. The only fighter that does not have implants is Chance O'Brien (cook) who is considdered in the movie to be the best fighter in the world. In order to rescue his kidnapped love he has to go through the tournament full of companies selling thier augmentation using the tourament as a national advertiseing method.

375750,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6303460089,Sid the Elf,"[1, 1]","When evaluating the action films of the 90's one factor is very evident. That factor would be; they simply cannot get enough cyborgs. Never before has a decade explored the studio space in the cyborg department as well as the 90's. It's a decade that couldn't take the typical man vs man battles, it had to kick it up and sprinkled in some half human half robot action. A concept we couldn't be happier with. So obviously when we came across Heatseeker and read the synopsis ""A kickboxer declines an invitation to participate in a kickboxing championship where a company plans to plant cyborg-enhanced fighters. When he declines, the company kidnaps his fianc&eacute;e forcing his participation,"" we said oh man we gotta get in on that. Sure it's a film that's been done more then once, but when a concept isn't broke why would you fix it?So Heatseeker starts out with our films hero Chance O'Brien, guess Lance Uppercut would be too obvious, as he wins the championship for the greatest fighter on the planet. With this win he gains the attention of the diabolical Tsui Tung, who runs an underground cyborg fighting arena. Tsui offers Chance O'brien a shot at the title but is turned down. Being Tsui doesn't approve of the answer, him and some goons sneak attack O'brien and kidnap his old lady. Once this happened Sid was floored because this film has clearly lifted parts of theDeath Ring [VHS] plot! Tsui parallels Vachs in an identical fashion, down to the bad guy lair and weird Chinese chick. Seriously...this guy had a deranged Chinese chick too! Naturally O'brien is the film's Matt Collins and exacts his revenge by fighting cyborg after cyborg. In the end he gets the girl and roundhouse kicks Tsui with such force that he actually dies. The final frame is an ultra B zoom in of a sweaty O'brien with the look of victorious fury in his eyes.Heatseeker in itself was pretty awesome if we may say so. Our guess is it had to be awesome when your going to lift the plot of Death Ring, except sprinkling in some cyborg action. We honestly couldn't even get mad about it, because if your going to emulate something why not emulate the best? Obviously it paled in comparison to the mighty Death Ring, but delivered so much confusion and poor poor acting we just had to love it. The fighting scenes are typical B fashion. Not one punch or kick comes within a foot of anyone....just the way we love it. The only thing missing from this movie was a cyborg version of Apache. Now if we had seen something like that we easily could have found a Woody Award for best picture in Heatseeker.",5,Ahhhh Mr Collins....wait a second this is just a poor mans Death Ring,1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,2588,"['When', 'evaluating', 'action', 'films', '90', 'one', 'factor', 'very', 'evident', 'factor', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'cyborgs', 'Never', 'decade', 'explored', 'studio', 'space', 'cyborg', 'department', 'as', 'well', '90', 'decade', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'typical', 'man', 'vs', 'man', 'had', 'kick', 'up', 'sprinkled', 'half', 'human', 'half', 'robot', 'action', 'concept', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'So', 'obviously', 'when', 'came', 'Heatseeker', 'read', 'synopsis', 'kickboxer', 'invitation', 'participate', 'kickboxing', 'championship', 'where', 'company', 'plant', 'cyborg-enhanced', 'fighters', 'When', 'company', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'forcing', 'participation', 'said', 'oh', 'man', 'got', 'ta', 'get', 'Sure', 'film', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'then', 'once', 'when', 'concept', ""n't"", 'broke', 'why', 'would', 'fix', 'So', 'Heatseeker', 'out', 'films', 'hero', 'Chance', ""O'Brien"", 'guess', 'Lance', 'Uppercut', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'obvious', 'championship', 'greatest', 'fighter', 'planet', 'win', 'gains', 'attention', 'diabolical', 'Tsui', 'Tung', 'who', 'underground', 'cyborg', 'fighting', 'arena', 'Tsui', 'Chance', ""O'brien"", 'shot', 'title', 'turned', 'down', 'Being', 'Tsui', ""n't"", 'approve', 'answer', 'goons', 'sneak', 'attack', ""O'brien"", 'kidnap', 'old', 'lady', 'Once', 'happened', 'Sid', 'was', 'floored', 'film', 'clearly', 'lifted', 'parts', 'theDeath', 'Ring', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'plot', 'Tsui', 'parallels', 'Vachs', 'identical', 'fashion', 'down', 'bad', 'guy', 'lair', 'weird', 'Chinese', 'chick', 'Seriously', 'guy', 'had', 'deranged', 'Chinese', 'chick', 'too', 'Naturally', ""O'brien"", 'film', 'Matt', 'Collins', 'revenge', 'fighting', 'cyborg', 'cyborg', 'end', 'girl', 'roundhouse', 'kicks', 'Tsui', 'such', 'force', 'actually', 'final', 'frame', 'ultra', 'B', 'zoom', 'sweaty', ""O'brien"", 'look', 'victorious', 'fury', 'eyes.Heatseeker', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'may', 'say', 'so', 'guess', 'had', 'be', 'awesome', 'when', 'going', 'lift', 'plot', 'Death', 'Ring', 'sprinkling', 'cyborg', 'action', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'mad', 'going', 'emulate', 'something', 'why', 'not', 'emulate', 'best', 'Obviously', 'paled', 'comparison', 'mighty', 'Death', 'Ring', 'delivered', 'so', 'much', 'confusion', 'poor', 'poor', 'acting', 'just', 'had', 'love', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'typical', 'B', 'fashion', 'Not', 'one', 'punch', 'kick', 'foot', 'anyone', 'way', 'love', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'movie', 'was', 'cyborg', 'version', 'Apache', 'Now', 'had', 'seen', 'something', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'Woody', 'Award', 'best', 'picture', 'Heatseeker']",Heatseeker VHS
