He plays a husband and journalist. He loses part of his family when terrorist hijack the plane while they are going to India. He decides to go after the killers when they are released without punishment. He uses the resources of a journalist and some hints from the CIA to track them down. What he doesn't realize is he is being used by the CIA to clean up their involvement. He receives assistance from an FBI agent well played by Forest Whitaker. All in all a very good movie. Not constant action but a good action thriller with excellent production values, sets, music, and direction. If you like movies were an average person takes matters into their own hands to protect their family or to get justice, you will enjoy it.",4,Iron Thriller,1061424000,"08 21, 2003",2003,850,"['Jeremy', 'Irons', 'played', 'good', 'bad', 'movies', 'acting', 'usually', 'quite', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'roles', 'husband', 'journalist', 'part', 'family', 'when', 'terrorist', 'hijack', 'plane', 'are', 'going', 'India', 'go', 'killers', 'when', 'are', 'released', 'punishment', 'resources', 'journalist', 'hints', 'CIA', 'track', 'down', 'What', ""n't"", 'realize', 'being', 'used', 'CIA', 'clean', 'up', 'involvement', 'assistance', 'FBI', 'agent', 'well', 'played', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'constant', 'action', 'good', 'action', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'sets', 'music', 'direction', 'like', 'movies', 'were', 'average', 'person', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'protect', 'family', 'get', 'justice', 'will', 'enjoy']",The Fourth Angel
759934,ACBFF25XJC2T7,B00009YXEN,Choice Critic,"[0, 0]","Jeremy Irons is journalist Jack Elgin.  His wife and two daughters are killed during a failed airline hijack attempt on the way to India. The plane is diverted as part of the hijacking plot to Cyprus. The hijackers demand and get $50 million. They are Serbian mobsters. Left a widower, with only his very young son, Elgin is tortured by the guilt and loss of the rest of his family.He is encouraged, off the record, by CIA operative, Davidson (Jason Priestley) to track the hijackers down.  With the help of an ex-terrorism analyst, Charlotte Rampling, he finds and kills three of them.  Forrest Whitaker arrives as an FBI agent assigned to recover the money.  He and Priestley are almost straight men for what is definitely a star vehicle for Jeremy Irons.If you like Jeremy Irons you will like this movie.  The script and plot are weak, but his performance is, as usual, unique and nearly flawless.  Unlike Liam Neeson in ""Taken"", Irons' character is not a skilled operative.  His portrayal as an unskilled, but determined, avenger is well-played. It is what makes this movie interesting  He is the type of bravura performer who can convey feeling and emotion with a look, a glance, a short phrase.  That is very fortunate for the viewer since the script is pretty weak.The backstory throughout the movie is whether the hijacking was motivated by politics or money. That answer to that question provides the twist necessary to make the film acceptable.  But make no mistake.  Without Jeremy Irons' performance the viewer probably would not care.",3,Revenge of the Fourth Horseman,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1547,"['Jeremy', 'Irons', 'journalist', 'Jack', 'Elgin', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'killed', 'failed', 'airline', 'hijack', 'attempt', 'way', 'India', 'plane', 'diverted', 'part', 'hijacking', 'plot', 'Cyprus', 'hijackers', 'demand', 'get', '50', 'million', 'are', 'Serbian', 'mobsters', 'Left', 'widower', 'only', 'very', 'young', 'son', 'Elgin', 'tortured', 'guilt', 'loss', 'rest', 'family.He', 'encouraged', 'record', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Davidson', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'track', 'hijackers', 'down', 'help', 'ex-terrorism', 'analyst', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'three', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'FBI', 'agent', 'assigned', 'recover', 'money', 'Priestley', 'are', 'almost', 'straight', 'men', 'what', 'definitely', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Jeremy', 'Irons.If', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'script', 'plot', 'are', 'weak', 'performance', 'usual', 'unique', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Taken', 'Irons', 'character', 'not', 'skilled', 'operative', 'portrayal', 'unskilled', 'determined', 'avenger', 'well-played', 'what', 'movie', 'interesting', 'type', 'bravura', 'performer', 'who', 'can', 'convey', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'look', 'glance', 'short', 'phrase', 'very', 'fortunate', 'viewer', 'script', 'pretty', 'weak.The', 'backstory', 'movie', 'hijacking', 'was', 'motivated', 'politics', 'money', 'answer', 'question', 'twist', 'necessary', 'make', 'film', 'acceptable', 'make', 'mistake', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'performance', 'viewer', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'care']",The Fourth Angel

The wife and two daughters of an English magazine editor are gunned down during a failed rescue attempt by terrorists who were hijacking a plane and demanding ransom. A total of fifteen people are killed, in addition to a man who is not included in the list of the dead. The editor tries to get the English and Americans to ""get justice"" for the slayings, but not only do they fail to help, the hijackers are allowed to go free. For some inexplicable reason, a CIA operative tells the editor that he will help him find and kill the hijackers. An FBI agent tries to find the hijackers. The CIA and FBI agents are at odds with each other. The editor goes after the hijackers. Viewers will enjoy the action and suspense and will wonder what is going on. Why were the hijackers let go free? Why are the American government agents acting as they are? Why are they in conflict with each other? Why was the man not reported as being killed?

759937,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00009YXEN,Michael Butts,"[0, 2]","THE FOURTH ANGEL is a slow-moving, cerebral movie, which features Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as an avenging angel.  While one can certainly sympathize with this journalist who loses a wife and two daughters to terrorists, it's hard to accept the stoic Irons in this action hero role.  Director John Irvin (Ghost Story) keeps the pace efficient, but the movie loses a lot of its punch on a convoluted and sometimes hard to follow script.  Forrest Whitaker uses his nice guy persona to efficiently play an FBI agent who ends up helping Irons in his quest for justice, and Jason Priestley flashes his blue eyes convincingly as an arrogant CIA agent, and we even have Charlotte Rampling in a basically useless role.  Overall, though competent filmmaking is evidenced, the casting of Irons stretched my credibility a little too much.",3,JEREMY BOND?,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,827,"['FOURTH', 'ANGEL', 'slow-moving', 'cerebral', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'avenging', 'angel', 'one', 'can', 'certainly', 'sympathize', 'journalist', 'who', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'terrorists', 'hard', 'accept', 'stoic', 'Irons', 'action', 'hero', 'role', 'Director', 'John', 'Irvin', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'pace', 'efficient', 'movie', 'lot', 'punch', 'convoluted', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'follow', 'script', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'nice', 'guy', 'persona', 'efficiently', 'play', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'up', 'helping', 'Irons', 'quest', 'justice', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'blue', 'eyes', 'convincingly', 'arrogant', 'CIA', 'agent', 'even', 'have', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'basically', 'useless', 'role', 'Overall', 'competent', 'filmmaking', 'evidenced', 'casting', 'Irons', 'stretched', 'credibility', 'little', 'too', 'much']",The Fourth Angel
759938,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00009YXEN,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 8]","The title of &quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; refers to the Revelation, but the whole content of the filck has little to do with the Bible.  It is about Jack Elgin, a British magazine editor whose wife and daughters are killed by hijacking terrorists.  Now Jack turns an avenger to gun down all those responsible for the deaths of his beloved.It sounds familar, and it is familiar.  But the point is its casting for Jack is played by Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons, who is getting more and more character actor as seen in &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; and &quot;The Time Machine.&quot;  In this film, thankfully, he avoids hammy acting, delivering pretty a decent one.The problem is, I think, that casting itself, however.  I don't beleive in the idea of one-man army (especially when formerly he was a man in suit) who can eliminate the trained terrorists.  If it is Arnold or Sly, well, that's another story, but the guy who can play the love of Lolita so convincingly cannot play such kind of part.More intersting is the supporting actors.  Forrest Whitaker appears as FBI investigator while Jason Priestley is clad in suit, posing arrogantly like any gvernment agents are required to do on screen (which is incredibley shot in widescreen).  But the most surprising part is the inclusion of Charlotte Rampling who is still gorgeous.  It is always good to see her, and hear her say &quot;Matey&quot; to Irons' hero on yachet, but she is not required to do much.And the story is clumsily told (though it goes fairly smooth), and the awkward conclusion is saddled with most heavy-handed flashbacks that would question the intention of the film.  There's little action that thefilm can boast of, and the shoot-out scenes (too brief) are not well conducted.  Some good ideas are there, like showing a pretty daughter of a terrorist, but that doens't amount ot much because the film somehow forgets about it in the course of its 90 minutes running time.  Regardless of the urgent matters about terrorism suggested here with its serious tone, this film fails to deliver, deliver whatever it wants to.",2,"Ordinary Thriller Featuring Irons, Whitaker, &amp; Rampling",1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,2090,"['title', 'quot', 'Fourth', 'Angel', 'quot', 'refers', 'Revelation', 'whole', 'content', 'filck', 'little', 'do', 'Bible', 'Jack', 'Elgin', 'British', 'magazine', 'editor', 'wife', 'daughters', 'are', 'killed', 'hijacking', 'terrorists', 'Now', 'Jack', 'avenger', 'gun', 'down', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'beloved.It', 'familar', 'familiar', 'point', 'casting', 'Jack', 'played', 'Oscar-winner', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'character', 'actor', 'seen', 'quot', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'quot', 'quot', 'Time', 'Machine.', 'quot', 'film', 'thankfully', 'hammy', 'acting', 'delivering', 'pretty', 'decent', 'one.The', 'problem', 'think', 'casting', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'beleive', 'idea', 'one-man', 'army', 'especially', 'when', 'formerly', 'was', 'man', 'suit', 'who', 'can', 'eliminate', 'trained', 'terrorists', 'Arnold', 'Sly', 'well', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'love', 'Lolita', 'convincingly', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'such', 'kind', 'part.More', 'intersting', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'FBI', 'investigator', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'clad', 'suit', 'posing', 'arrogantly', 'gvernment', 'agents', 'are', 'required', 'do', 'screen', 'incredibley', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'most', 'surprising', 'part', 'inclusion', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'still', 'gorgeous', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'hear', 'say', 'quot', 'Matey', 'quot', 'Irons', 'hero', 'yachet', 'not', 'required', 'do', 'much.And', 'story', 'clumsily', 'told', 'fairly', 'smooth', 'awkward', 'conclusion', 'saddled', 'most', 'heavy-handed', 'flashbacks', 'would', 'question', 'intention', 'film', 'little', 'action', 'thefilm', 'can', 'boast', 'shoot-out', 'scenes', 'too', 'brief', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'conducted', 'good', 'ideas', 'are', 'there', 'showing', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'terrorist', ""doens't"", 'amount', 'ot', 'much', 'film', 'somehow', 'course', '90', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'Regardless', 'urgent', 'matters', 'terrorism', 'suggested', 'here', 'serious', 'tone', 'film', 'deliver', 'deliver']",The Fourth Angel
