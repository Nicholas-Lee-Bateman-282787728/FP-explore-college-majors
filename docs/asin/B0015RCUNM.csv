1150794,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B0015RCUNM,DarthRad,"[4, 6]","For fans of the movie ""Once"", this DVD is like a Part 2 sequel to that story - the Guy and the Girl get back together and make music happily ever after.Shortly after making that Oscar-winning movie (the Oscar was for their song ""Falling Slowly""), Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova (with Joe Doyle on bass and Colm Mac Con Iomaire on violin) recorded this live concert in this small intimate theater in Seattle, Washington on November 4, 2007.  This DVD is part of a series of such intimate concerts recorded for DVD at the Artists Den.The soft lighting, cleverly changing camera angles, and gorgeous colors are a visual treat by themselves.  The audio is superb, the songs lovely.  Hansard charms the audience with his megawatt personality, tells some jokes, and, in this small intimate gathering, even gets them to whistle along a few times.  Irglova, then only 19 years old, is her usual shy self, frequently looking to Hansard while barely looking at the audience; she sits partly with her back to the audience at the piano.  She wears what looks like a thin wedding band on her left hand.The obvious affection and personal connection between Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova is out in the open throughout the show.  It's apparent from watching them in this concert that the only acting they did in ""Once"" consisted of pretending to be strangers getting to know each other.  Watching them in this DVD is like picking up the story line from the ending of that movie, with the Guy returning from London to his true love, the Girl, to tour the world doing concerts.  Hansard and Irglova wear the same sort of earth-tone clothes as before and Hansard plays on the same thoroughly beat-up guitar with the extra holes, the same one he used in the movie.The ending of the concert is really sweet and affectionate, and brought out a delighted standing ovation from the audience.In January 2009, while in Australia playing at the Sydney Opera House, Hansard let out that they were no longer romantically involved, but were still really good friends.  The two have continued to tour together as the Swell Season, and have a new album coming out in October.If you loved the movie ""Once"", if you love the music of Hansard and Irglova, this DVD is a must-see.",5,Beautiful beyond words - a must see for fans of Hansard and Irglova,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,2248,"['fans', 'movie', 'Once', 'DVD', 'Part', '2', 'sequel', 'story', 'Guy', 'Girl', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'make', 'music', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Shortly', 'making', 'Oscar-winning', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'was', 'song', 'Falling', 'Slowly', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'Joe', 'Doyle', 'bass', 'Colm', 'Mac', 'Con', 'Iomaire', 'violin', 'recorded', 'live', 'concert', 'small', 'intimate', 'theater', 'Seattle', 'Washington', 'November', '4', '2007', 'DVD', 'part', 'series', 'such', 'intimate', 'concerts', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'Artists', 'Den.The', 'soft', 'lighting', 'cleverly', 'changing', 'camera', 'angles', 'gorgeous', 'colors', 'are', 'visual', 'treat', 'audio', 'superb', 'songs', 'lovely', 'Hansard', 'audience', 'megawatt', 'personality', 'jokes', 'small', 'intimate', 'gathering', 'even', 'whistle', 'along', 'few', 'times', 'Irglova', 'then', 'only', '19', 'years', 'old', 'usual', 'shy', 'self', 'frequently', 'looking', 'Hansard', 'barely', 'looking', 'audience', 'partly', 'back', 'audience', 'piano', 'what', 'thin', 'wedding', 'band', 'left', 'hand.The', 'obvious', 'affection', 'personal', 'connection', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'out', 'open', 'show', 'apparent', 'watching', 'concert', 'only', 'acting', 'did', 'Once', 'consisted', 'pretending', 'be', 'strangers', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'picking', 'up', 'story', 'line', 'ending', 'movie', 'Guy', 'returning', 'London', 'true', 'love', 'Girl', 'tour', 'world', 'doing', 'concerts', 'Hansard', 'Irglova', 'wear', 'same', 'sort', 'earth-tone', 'clothes', 'Hansard', 'same', 'thoroughly', 'beat-up', 'guitar', 'extra', 'holes', 'same', 'one', 'used', 'movie.The', 'ending', 'concert', 'really', 'sweet', 'affectionate', 'brought', 'out', 'delighted', 'standing', 'ovation', 'audience.In', 'January', '2009', 'Australia', 'playing', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'Hansard', 'let', 'out', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'romantically', 'involved', 'were', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'two', 'have', 'continued', 'tour', 'together', 'Swell', 'Season', 'have', 'new', 'album', 'coming', 'out', 'October.If', 'loved', 'movie', 'Once', 'love', 'music', 'Hansard', 'Irglova', 'DVD', 'must-see']",N/A

1150797,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0015RCUNM,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","In 2007 a film was released in most of Europe and the U. S. called ""Once.""  Admittedly it is one of my favorites, and I thought the best of the year.  After it became successful, the musical stars Glen Hansard, an Irish rocker from a band called ""The Frames,"" and Marketa Irglova, a Czech &eacute;migr&eacute; collaborated to tour as ""The Swell Season.""  Essentially, some of ""The Frames"" were part of the group, but I believe they found other musicians as well.The 75 minute concert was filmed for the TV series, ""Live From The Artists Den"" on the Ovation channel.  It is tightly edited to keep the pacing consistent.  As big a fan as I am, I did think the duo and their bass player and violin player could have used a bit more rehearsal time.  Hansard is certainly the driving force with a powerful voice, a distinct difference from Irglova's almost fragile soprano.  Together there is no denying they make sweet music.  The session was filmed in November, 2007 at Seattle's tiny Good Shepherd Center Chapel, just a couple months before they would win an Oscar for their beautiful hit from ""Once,"" ""Falling Slowly.""Although this disc is a DVD and not a Blu ray, I was amazed at how good it looked.  Great colors, artful direction and some interesting camera angles.  The audio is a compressed Dolby Digital 2.0 but damn if it doesn't sound terrific.  Here is a song list: Say It To Me Now, Lay Me Down, This Low, When Your Mind's Made Up, Lies, Falling Slowly, Golden, Pavement Tune, Once, If You Want Me, Concentric, Star Star. There are some brief interviews with Hansard that add a little time to the song list and some info on the Good Shepherd Center.",4,4 1/2 stars for a short but sweet made for TV concert,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,1658,"['2007', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'most', 'Europe', 'U.', 'S.', 'called', 'Once', 'Admittedly', 'one', 'favorites', 'thought', 'best', 'year', 'became', 'successful', 'musical', 'stars', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Irish', 'rocker', 'band', 'called', 'Frames', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'Czech', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'collaborated', 'tour', 'Swell', 'Season', 'Essentially', 'Frames', 'were', 'part', 'group', 'believe', 'found', 'other', 'musicians', 'well.The', '75', 'minute', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'TV', 'series', 'Live', 'Artists', 'Den', 'Ovation', 'channel', 'tightly', 'edited', 'keep', 'pacing', 'consistent', 'big', 'fan', 'am', 'did', 'think', 'duo', 'bass', 'player', 'violin', 'player', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'rehearsal', 'time', 'Hansard', 'certainly', 'driving', 'force', 'powerful', 'voice', 'distinct', 'difference', 'Irglova', 'almost', 'fragile', 'soprano', 'Together', 'denying', 'make', 'sweet', 'music', 'session', 'was', 'filmed', 'November', '2007', 'Seattle', 'tiny', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'Center', 'Chapel', 'just', 'couple', 'months', 'would', 'win', 'Oscar', 'beautiful', 'hit', 'Once', 'Falling', 'Slowly', 'disc', 'DVD', 'not', 'Blu', 'ray', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'looked', 'Great', 'colors', 'artful', 'direction', 'interesting', 'camera', 'angles', 'audio', 'compressed', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'damn', ""n't"", 'sound', 'terrific', 'Here', 'song', 'list', 'Say', 'Me', 'Now', 'Lay', 'Me', 'Down', 'Low', 'When', 'Mind', 'Made', 'Up', 'Lies', 'Falling', 'Slowly', 'Golden', 'Pavement', 'Tune', 'Once', 'Want', 'Me', 'Concentric', 'Star', 'Star', 'are', 'brief', 'interviews', 'Hansard', 'little', 'time', 'song', 'list', 'info', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'Center']",N/A

The wait time with them was something like ""Infinitely Long Wait.""  I don't understand why they don't just buy more copies of the DVD in that situation. (??)  Anyway, I'm glad I purchased it, as it pretty much fulfills all of the promise of Glen & Marketa's collaborations in Once.  Their songs are ""swell"" (sorry, couldn't resist!), the harmonies are deluxe, and the sound quality is very good.  We get to hear and see versions of their Once tunes (including the minimally featured title track!), plus some good Frames material from Glen.  My only complaint with the production is that the camera stays on Glen too long and doesn't feature Marketa enough.  On their duets, you'd like to see more shots of them singing together, but too often the camera's on Glen, with Marketa only heard (but not seen) in the background.  The only real exceptions to this are some good shared shots on ""Falling Slowly"" (thankfully), and Marketa's lead turn on ""If You Want Me.""  The latter tune is such a delight, it really makes you wish she would write more of her own songs.",4,My mind's made up - this is a good one!,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,1131,"['finally', 'bought', 'waiting', 'vain', 'netflix', 'send', 'wait', 'time', 'was', 'something', 'Infinitely', 'Long', 'Wait', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'buy', 'more', 'copies', 'DVD', 'situation', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'glad', 'purchased', 'pretty', 'much', 'fulfills', 'promise', 'Glen', 'Marketa', 'collaborations', 'Once', 'songs', 'are', 'swell', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'harmonies', 'are', 'deluxe', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'get', 'hear', 'see', 'versions', 'Once', 'tunes', 'including', 'minimally', 'featured', 'title', 'track', 'good', 'Frames', 'material', 'Glen', 'only', 'complaint', 'production', 'camera', 'Glen', 'too', 'long', ""n't"", 'feature', 'Marketa', 'enough', 'duets', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'shots', 'singing', 'together', 'too', 'often', 'camera', 'Glen', 'Marketa', 'only', 'heard', 'not', 'seen', 'background', 'only', 'real', 'exceptions', 'are', 'good', 'shared', 'shots', 'Falling', 'Slowly', 'thankfully', 'Marketa', 'lead', 'turn', 'Want', 'latter', 'tune', 'such', 'delight', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'write', 'more', 'own', 'songs']",N/A
