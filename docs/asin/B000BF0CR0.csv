I really enjoyed the photographs of him. . . especially his problematic nose.  Despite his nose he, apparently, was quite the ladies' man...but then he was very rich. He saved the US economy before there was a central bank.",4,Emperor Indeed!,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,304,"['learned', 'lot', 'short', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', 'bankers', 'world', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'photographs', 'especially', 'problematic', 'nose', 'nose', 'apparently', 'was', 'quite', 'ladies', 'man', 'then', 'was', 'very', 'rich', 'saved', 'US', 'economy', 'was', 'central', 'bank']",Biography - J.

941391,A16KSSD9NAANTI,B000BF0CR0,Glenn Bisset,"[1, 3]",Seems more like a PR piece for a politician.  There is another way of looking at this man'saccomplishments that is not nearly as nice.  No mention of his affiliation with the Rothchildbanking empire and the fact his dad worked for them (the Bank of England) could not havebeen an over site.

941392,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000BF0CR0,Jeffery Mingo,"[8, 13]","As I've written before, the Biographies of the B-list and C-list famous just aren't as interesting as those of the A-list famous.  Clearly, watching something on Abe Lincoln or Van Gogh would be more exciting than this.  Still, if you think of Morgan as the Gates or Wal-Mart guy of his time, then maybe his relevance becomes more clear.  After all, his company still exists at a time when Montgomery Ward, Pan Am, and Enron are long gone.This work doesn't just delve into his successes.  Like Poe, his first wife died young of tuberculosis and he had a bulbous, nasty nose in those pre-Nip/Tuck days.  I love that Biography isn't ashamed to show the HUGE number of famous men who were womanizers and JP Morgan belongs on that list: it was not just Clinton and JFK.  I loved hearing of his love of art.  Biography implies that he was a great negotiator, but twice they mention him locking parties in a room and basically saying, ""Don't come out until you've come to a compromise!""  Not very tactful, it's almost like when the Simpsons stopped the strike at Springfield Elementary.Luckily this work does not include cheesy reenactments.  Though much of his life was lived in the 1800s, they show footage from the early 1900s that did add depth to the work.  They also show those well-down political cartoons of the era.  Though they state that Morgan had children and grandchildren, this is the first Biography I have seen where none of his descendants are interviewed.",2,Important for His Times,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,1468,"[""'ve"", 'written', 'Biographies', 'B-list', 'C-list', 'famous', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'A-list', 'famous', 'Clearly', 'watching', 'something', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'exciting', 'Still', 'think', 'Morgan', 'Gates', 'Wal-Mart', 'guy', 'time', 'then', 'maybe', 'relevance', 'more', 'clear', 'company', 'still', 'time', 'when', 'Montgomery', 'Ward', 'Pan', 'Am', 'Enron', 'are', 'long', 'gone.This', 'work', ""n't"", 'just', 'delve', 'successes', 'Poe', 'first', 'wife', 'died', 'young', 'tuberculosis', 'had', 'bulbous', 'nasty', 'nose', 'pre-Nip/Tuck', 'days', 'love', 'Biography', ""n't"", 'ashamed', 'show', 'HUGE', 'number', 'famous', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'womanizers', 'JP', 'Morgan', 'list', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'Clinton', 'JFK', 'loved', 'hearing', 'love', 'art', 'Biography', 'was', 'great', 'negotiator', 'twice', 'mention', 'locking', 'parties', 'room', 'basically', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', ""'ve"", 'come', 'compromise', 'Not', 'very', 'tactful', 'almost', 'when', 'Simpsons', 'stopped', 'strike', 'Springfield', 'Elementary.Luckily', 'work', 'not', 'include', 'cheesy', 'reenactments', 'much', 'life', 'was', 'lived', '1800s', 'show', 'footage', 'early', '1900s', 'did', 'add', 'depth', 'work', 'also', 'show', 'well-down', 'political', 'cartoons', 'era', 'state', 'Morgan', 'had', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'first', 'Biography', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'none', 'descendants', 'are', 'interviewed']",Biography - J.
