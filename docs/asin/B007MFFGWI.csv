I don't remember when I first heard about Winx Club but when I saw this moving was coming out I thought it looked cute.  The movie is based off the television series and from what I read the animation is a little more vibrant in the movie than the traditional show.  I think the movie has amazing colors and really makes the fairies ""pop!""  The movie is a decent length (just over an hour) and you also get a second disc with seven episodes.  For about $15, this is a great value as you get a lot of Winx Club for your money.  My boys didn't mind at all that it was a girly movie, there are some guys in the show and they were just amazed at the colors and characters.  I do like though that this set includes an actual movie and episodes, whereas some sets say movie but really just include a bunch of episodes.

I found the Disney Fairy shows to be some of my favorites to watch with my Daughter due to the high quality and good story.I did not know much about the Winx series and had high expectations based on other reviews but was dissapointed. The animation was stiff, the story seemed targeted for very young girls and did not flow well. I lost interest very quickly. Maybe this movie assumes you have been watching the Winx series and character development was not needed.I also felt there was too much boy / girl relationships going on for the target audience. The story seemed more for very young girls but all the girls in the movie were dealing with their own boy friends (lots of pouting..etc).
