1605239,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,B00A2MLZ50,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[0, 0]","Some people here and on Netflix give this movie low marks -- claiming that it is both boring and confusing. Ignore them. This is a great indie movie!The film isn't told in a linear fashion. So, you will get a lot of flashbacks. But you will soon become comfortable with the structure, and when that happens, the movie becomes nothing but suspense all the way through. The only bad part -- and this is minor -- was the rushed period of time during the year when the daughter was missing. But, by reducing the time on this issue, the director was able to keep the film at a reasonable length.The acting is very good - even if the characters are a bit one-dimensional.  The lead actress shows versatility; she is not always the petulant, needy girl. I wish they would have used the boyfriend character a bit more. The actor was very capable.As the movie winds down, it becomes a bit gory - but not too much. Also, while the ending does not answer every question, we find out why she went missing (which is the most important issue).  It is easy and interesting to fill in the blanks with imagination.If you like suspense with a supernatural twist and do not mind working with a flashback structure, you will like this movie. I would not describe the plot as complicated to understand or as confusing (as others have done). Maybe some people just aren't that savvy or do not watch closely enough.I am a harsh critic.

1605245,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00A2MLZ50,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","I've commented before about what I call the MTV generation. This is a group of film goers who have no patience when it comes to movies. They want the information thrown at them immediately, they want it NOW! Because of this attitude they don't have time for movies that offer what I call the slow burn. These are films that give you pieces of the story, that take their time in allowing you to absorb what is going on rather than just rush into it in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The best thing about these movies is that when done well they are quite enjoyable.Consider the films of Hitchcock. Even in a film like PSYCHO, his most popular film, you don't have the true gist of the story until 30 minutes into the film. You get glimpses of what is to come, you get set up for what is going to come, and you get involved with the characters. He did this in most of his films. Alas I don't think today's generation would have the patience to sit through an entire Hitchcock film. That's sad. Because not only will they miss some of the greatest films of all times, they'll more likely than not complain about films like TRUE NATURE which deserves more credit than that.The film opens with college student Marianne who goes for a jog one night only to disappear. To stop there would make a short film. Instead the movie takes us to a year later with parents Becky and Reg are still grieving over the loss of their daughter. Miraculously she suddenly shows on the front doorstep caked in mud and filthy though wearing the same clothes she had on when she disappeared.Questioned by the police Marianne offers them little information about what happened to her. She seems to have a mental block about events and possibly is suffering from memory loss in an attempt to retain her sanity. She's given time to recover and go home with her parents.But things remain strained at home. She gets glimpses of what happened but never quite the full story. She wonders why her father didn't come searching for her while we viewers believe he did everything in his power to find her. And beneath it all there is a tension between these family members that makes you wonder if things were as proper and peaceful as they seemed when the film began.The movie offers clues as to what's going on, lets you see bits and pieces of the past and current time lines to try and figure out what happened and what will be. I thought I had figured it out but found myself surprised by the end of the film. It does a good job of bringing together the complete story together and offering a tale that is most satisfying.Complaints I've read about the film have made me think I am correct about that MTV generation. Poor remarks almost seem uniform in complaining that not enough is explained or that it doesn't jump in fast enough. These are obviously written by those who have yet to understand the beauty of the slow burn. They cheat themselves from enjoying a movie that tells a story rather than blows things up.One thing about this movie that should give film makers a boost is that it was shot in Dayton, OH and not Hollywood. This proves that you don't have to go to California to make a good movie. The acting on hand makes the characters believable, enough so that you care and are concerned about all involved. The production values are equal to anything seen from out west. With that in mind I for one hope to see more quality films being made here in the Midwest. I also hope that enough people begin to see that a slow burn film can be enjoyable.

I love movies with original concepts, especially when they are in the horror genre.  TRUE NATURE, a 2013 release from Monarch Home Entertainment, is one of these great films.  Chocked full of intensity and intrigue, this film will keep you enthralled right up to the end.Before I continue, I have to state that I will not be going into great detail about the plot.  If I do, I will give certain key elements away, and discovering what is actually going on is part of what makes this film so enjoyable.  So, I am going to be very vague when I discuss the actual story.TRUE NATURE is shot well and looks excellent onscreen.  I&#8217;m not sure what the budget was for the film, but they used every bit of it wisely.  From the sets to the lighting to the special effects, everything looks great.The acting is also top notch as well.  I enjoyed the entire cast, although actress Marianne Porter,  who portrays the main character, steals the show.  She only has a couple of credits on her IMDB page, but wow&#8230;she gives a staggering performance that will leave you in awe.  I hope to see more of her in future projects.The special effects look good as a whole, even if they are CG.  There&#8217;s not much gore here (a couple of gunshot wounds and some blood-tears), but what we see looks good onscreen.  I particularly enjoyed the CGI Effects feature in the Special Features.  This shows how they did certain shots and the layers that were used.But the story in TRUE NATURE is the real winner here.  It is very original and suspenseful.  I can honestly say I did not see the ending coming.  It wasn&#8217;t what I was expecting at all.My sole complaint about the film is the very final scene.  I will not go into specifics, but it didn&#8217;t make much sense to me.  Maybe I simply misunderstood it.Still&#8230;TRUE NATURE is a great film and I highly suggest giving it a look.
