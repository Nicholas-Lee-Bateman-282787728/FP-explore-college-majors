If part II of this great Next Generation story had already been remastered for Blu Ray why was it not included in the Season 3 Next Generation set?Because they want you all to run out and spend extra money to get Part II when of course it will be included in a few months when the season four set is released on Blu Ray. Now I am sure there are some people who did not want to buy an entire season of Next Generation to get this story and for them buying this makes sense. But for the vast majority of Trek Fans upgrading to Blu Ray this is just another CBS/Paramount money grab. Not even any extra features that would make this worth buying.",1,Another CBS/Paramount money grab.,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,685,"['Hey', 'Trek', 'Fans', 'Ask', 'question', 'part', 'II', 'great', 'Next', 'Generation', 'story', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'remastered', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'Season', '3', 'Next', 'Generation', 'set', 'want', 'run', 'out', 'spend', 'extra', 'money', 'get', 'Part', 'II', 'when', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'few', 'months', 'when', 'season', 'four', 'set', 'released', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Now', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'buy', 'entire', 'season', 'Next', 'Generation', 'get', 'story', 'buying', 'sense', 'vast', 'majority', 'Trek', 'Fans', 'upgrading', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'just', 'CBS/Paramount', 'money', 'grab', 'Not', 'even', 'extra', 'features', 'would', 'make', 'worth', 'buying']",Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Best of Both Worlds

The color, contrast, clarity, all looks amazing.Great Dolby Digital sound.Engaging the Borg special feature which includes interviews with all the major actors from the episode.Gag Reel.CONS:They made an edit to the cliff hanger ending and spliced part 1 and 2 together. That was my favorite part of the episode and they should not have tampered with that iconic moment of television history. Ron Jones composed music named ""Captain Borg"" for the scene where Riker says, ""Mr. Worf, Fire!"" and it is cut short, reducing the impact and drama of the scene. It would have been much better if they let it fade to black, music finishes and then start the second half. They could have kept the ""To be continued"" or removed it, but let the music finish. In the special features, Seth MacFarlane said the reason he hired Ron Jones for Family Guy was because of his music in this episode. I would have preferred if they offered a ""seamless"" and ""original"" version on the disc, so at least we could choose what we want.Overall, I'm happy to own this and don't regret buying it.

1623665,A17LCDEFG5OXSQ,B00BAXTY8U,Curtis Mitchell,"[0, 0]","The theatrical cuts of TNG's two-parters have been floating around for awhile, sourced from a collection that was released in the UK but never in the United States.  I was very excited to hear that finally we were going to get at least one of them with a stand-alone BD release of The Best of Both Worlds.  Included on this disc are the two parts of the marquee storyline that featured Captain Picard being abducted by the Borg.  Both parts have been edited together into a single feature-length episode and watching the story in this manner is fantastic.  While some trivial bits of recap are lost, as we already have the episodes in their original format on home media (and can expect the original cut of Part II on the Season 4 BD) it doesn't feel like a double-dip.I would have liked to see some more special features.  The commentary is nice but a more full-fledged ""movie"" treatment with deleted scenes, etc. would have been pretty cool.  The absence of Season 4, Episode 2: ""Family"" is also felt as it was very much a coda or conclusion to The Best of Both Worlds.  I'll have to remain content with my DVD copy of that episode until we get Season 4 of TNG on BD in a few months.The restoration work that has been done on the TNG BDs has been outstanding and it is great to see that The Best of Both Worlds has been treated with the same quality that the full season releases are.  If you haven't seen TNG on BD yet, the visual clarity of this disc will blow you away.  Sometimes this is amazing, other times it lets you see all to easily the challenges of doing a complex science fiction show in the late 80s/early 90s.  Overall though, I'm glad to have this disc in my collection and I will probably turn to it over the season releases (which as a nuisance have the episodes on two different discs in two different boxes) when I feel like watching The Best of Both Worlds in the future.Highly recommended for both casual collectors who enjoy the occasional episode and appreciate Best-of Collections and serious collectors who will enjoy seeing the theatrical cut of these two landmark episodes.",4,An excellent addition to the Star Trek BD lineup,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,2103,"['theatrical', 'cuts', 'TNG', 'two-parters', 'have', 'been', 'floating', 'around', 'awhile', 'sourced', 'collection', 'was', 'released', 'UK', 'never', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'hear', 'finally', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'least', 'one', 'stand-alone', 'BD', 'release', 'Best', 'Both', 'Worlds', 'Included', 'disc', 'are', 'two', 'parts', 'marquee', 'storyline', 'featured', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'being', 'abducted', 'Borg', 'parts', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'together', 'single', 'feature-length', 'episode', 'watching', 'story', 'manner', 'fantastic', 'trivial', 'bits', 'recap', 'are', 'lost', 'already', 'have', 'episodes', 'original', 'format', 'home', 'media', 'can', 'expect', 'original', 'cut', 'Part', 'II', 'Season', '4', 'BD', ""n't"", 'feel', 'double-dip.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'nice', 'more', 'full-fledged', 'movie', 'treatment', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'cool', 'absence', 'Season', '4', 'Episode', '2', 'Family', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'coda', 'conclusion', 'Best', 'Both', 'Worlds', ""'ll"", 'have', 'remain', 'content', 'DVD', 'copy', 'episode', 'get', 'Season', '4', 'TNG', 'BD', 'few', 'months.The', 'restoration', 'work', 'been', 'done', 'TNG', 'BDs', 'been', 'outstanding', 'great', 'see', 'Best', 'Both', 'Worlds', 'been', 'treated', 'same', 'quality', 'full', 'season', 'releases', 'are', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TNG', 'BD', 'yet', 'visual', 'clarity', 'disc', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Sometimes', 'amazing', 'other', 'times', 'see', 'easily', 'challenges', 'doing', 'complex', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'late', '80s/early', '90s', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'disc', 'collection', 'will', 'probably', 'turn', 'season', 'releases', 'nuisance', 'have', 'episodes', 'two', 'different', 'discs', 'two', 'different', 'boxes', 'when', 'feel', 'watching', 'Best', 'Worlds', 'future.Highly', 'recommended', 'casual', 'collectors', 'who', 'enjoy', 'occasional', 'episode', 'appreciate', 'Best-of', 'Collections', 'serious', 'collectors', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'two', 'landmark', 'episodes']",Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Best of Both Worlds

I will never forget that the second part of the cliff hanger acually had its premiere broadcast on the evening of my wife's and my 3rd wedding anniversary.  We were so caught up with it, that we brought dinner in and watched the show as our celebration.So, many years later, I was excited to hear about the ""seamless"" version on blu-ray.  I received it on the first day it was available to the public and watched it right away with my son. It is great in so many ways; the vibrant color, the enhancements, including the soundtrack just pulls one into the tension filled story.  I even found that the story is a stronger one when told as one complete tale (I felt when I first watched it, that the second episode did not live up to the first), but paired together they come off well.What I did not like was the lack of more ""seamlessness.""  In many ways, I felt like I was watching a theatrical film, but that was conitnually interrupted with the standard tv opening at the beginning and the commercial breaks (where the scene fads to black on dramatic music, only to open again a few seconds later on the same shot).  I felt that this would have been a five star review if they had gone a little further in the seamless aspect.For fans of the show, or new folks becoming interested in it, I do recommend this.

The acting is very good and the plot is extraordinary when compared both to other episodes of the show and to the general quality of other television drama and sci-fi programs at that time. For people who don't want to purchase entire seasons of the show, this is a good option as it provides a very popular story arch with some nice extra features all on one disc.Running approximately 85 minutes, this is a combination of the Season 3 Finale and the Season 4 Premiere. It dramatically heightens the sense of risk and danger in the show compared to many preceding story arcs. The plot pits the crew of the Enterprise against the Borg, the infamous cybernetic collective, who proceed to attempt the destruction of the Federation by assimilating Captain Picard and using his knowledge of Starfleet tactics and technology against them. The acting is generally better than usual for the show, as the cast seem to really bring to life an Enterprise brought to its knees. Especially impressive is the evolving relationship between First Officer Commander Riker and Borg specialist Lt. Commander Shelby. Not only does this near perfect moment in Star Trek history entertain in a big way, but it also sets up many (then) future ST storylines.The video on this disc is greatly improved compared to the original broadcast version. Of course, being an early 90s TV show, it is in 1:33:1 but the cleanup job for the Blu-Ray release has it looking exquisitely sharp. The sound is sharp too in its new re-mastered 7.1 stereo surround. The extras are also nice for being a budget release of a TV show. There are a few short features that give extra context to the show and provide interesting facts presented by the cast and production crew. For the low price, this is a great buy for anyone who loves these episodes and who doesn't want to buy two seasons of the show to own them.

And yes, I called CBS evil.I call CBS evil because they are feeding on the fact that you will (or I did) watch the 3rd season of TNG on Blu Ray. They know that the final episode is one of the worst cliffhangers in TV history in that it ""ruined"" summers for some people (well, not really). Picard being left a Borg at the end of the final eps of the season means if you want to watch this episode now, in HD and in the highest quality possible, you can pick up the TV series Blu Rays. Sure, no problem... except you NOW have to wait for season 4 to release to close off the cliffhanger.... OR... you can simply purchase this Blu Ray that has both episodes included and know what happens or refresh you memory now.They got me to bite.Video:Remastered just like the seasons proper. That means returning to the film elements and rebuilding the series from scratch. Which means the video looks amazing. I didn't notice any video issues at all. No softness and no SD content. Great video.Audio:You get the show in 5.1 (it's actually 7.1, sorry for the error) DTS-MA and the original stereo mix, compressed. It's the best it has ever sounded either way.Extras:All of the extras are worth watching, and as I understand it, they are exclusive to this disc alone. They will not appear on the season sets. This is another reason I purchased the set. The commentary is definitely worth listening to. The Regeneration featurette is full of great information and worth watching. And I love gag reels, so that alone took some of the sting out of buying this.Overall:If you remember the opening episode of TNG season 4, you can be patient and wait for the BD release of Season 4 or just don't care about TNG, then skip this disc. If you want to see the conclusion ""now,"" you love TNG and want some worthwhile extras and don't mind paying for it, then this is worth buying.Recommended.",5,CBS is evil,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1894,"['Yes', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'yes', 'called', 'CBS', 'evil.I', 'call', 'CBS', 'evil', 'are', 'feeding', 'fact', 'will', 'did', 'watch', '3rd', 'season', 'TNG', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'know', 'final', 'episode', 'one', 'worst', 'cliffhangers', 'TV', 'history', 'ruined', 'summers', 'people', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'Picard', 'being', 'left', 'Borg', 'end', 'final', 'eps', 'season', 'want', 'watch', 'episode', 'now', 'HD', 'highest', 'quality', 'possible', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'TV', 'series', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'Sure', 'problem', 'NOW', 'have', 'wait', 'season', '4', 'release', 'close', 'off', 'cliffhanger', 'can', 'simply', 'purchase', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'episodes', 'included', 'know', 'what', 'refresh', 'memory', 'now.They', 'got', 'bite.Video', 'Remastered', 'just', 'seasons', 'proper', 'returning', 'film', 'elements', 'rebuilding', 'series', 'scratch', 'video', 'amazing', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'video', 'issues', 'No', 'softness', 'SD', 'content', 'Great', 'video.Audio', 'get', 'show', '5.1', 'actually', '7.1', 'sorry', 'error', 'DTS-MA', 'original', 'stereo', 'mix', 'compressed', 'best', 'ever', 'sounded', 'way.Extras', 'extras', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'understand', 'are', 'exclusive', 'disc', 'alone', 'will', 'not', 'appear', 'season', 'reason', 'purchased', 'set', 'commentary', 'definitely', 'worth', 'listening', 'Regeneration', 'featurette', 'full', 'great', 'information', 'worth', 'watching', 'love', 'gag', 'reels', 'alone', 'took', 'sting', 'buying', 'this.Overall', 'remember', 'opening', 'episode', 'TNG', 'season', '4', 'can', 'be', 'patient', 'wait', 'BD', 'release', 'Season', '4', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'TNG', 'then', 'skip', 'disc', 'want', 'see', 'conclusion', 'now', 'love', 'TNG', 'want', 'worthwhile', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', 'then', 'worth', 'buying.Recommended']",Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Best of Both Worlds

The editing to combine both parts means a loss of ""to be continued"", a recap, and some music.  Much to my surprise, while the editing was very competently done, the big epic ""TO BE CONTINUED"" was missed...2.  Film restoration quality is top-notch, as is the sound - the editing of both is virtually seamless, and the audio isn't overly loud or underly quiet either3.  Three seconds of a minor reaction shot (in pt 2) had to be upsampled because the original film element was not found (3 seconds lost from this episode combined with 2 seconds from some season 1 story equates to 5 seconds of footage lost -- from an archive containing over 25000 reels of film is quite a ratio of lost:total)4.  The original tv promos are included and are nice to see5.  Loved the blooper real6.  Liked the documentary with the cast.  Elizabeth Dennehy's input is great, surprising at times, and - as the 2-part story shows - did an amazing job as Lt ShelbyThe blooper reel and special features make this an okay purchase.  I think it's been put out just for those of us who do not want to wait until late-July to see part 2 to get to see the whole kit'n'kaboodle now.  Which is nice, since:(a) it's quicker to get this disc than to fetch disc 6 of season 3 followed by disc 1 of season 4(b) casual fans who don't want to buy every season set can just get this story and watch it whole(c) it's a very special episode (had to find another reason)Fans who want every little extra will doubtlessly purchase.  More casual fans might want the whole series but not pay for these sorts of double-dips.  The extras are good, but they don't hold enough merit to be ""must have"".  Less casual viewers, though, that prefer special stories rather than buying entire seasons might find this set worth buying.
