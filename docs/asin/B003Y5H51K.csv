On the bad side it's cliched and predictable. But no more so than a lot of movies about right now.Anything with James Cameron's name attached to it is going to draw interest, and probably unreal expectations. Avatar this is not, nor even the caliber of The Abyss.All that said, this ""inspired by true events"" movie is worth seeing in my opinion. The character interactions, life and death scenarios and sheer palpable feel of the underwater scenes make it worth it.Not a new story, cave diving team get trapped by weather, must go down and in, to get out. Unknown territory, virgin caves, cold, wet and the inevitable power struggles between high flying playboy (Gruffudd) and grizzled pro (Roxburgh), who's trying to save the team, and reconcile with his son keeps the story moving forward.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I'm deciding whether Sanctum deserves a 3 or 4-star rating... since I'm in a good mood, we'll go with a 4.The biggest problem by *far* is that the first 30 minutes is some of the most basic and predictable Jurassic Park-like writing I've ever had to endure.  I flat out *hate* the 30 minutes that open Sanctum.  No, there's no dinosaurs roaming around, but the adventurous flow and the average writing makes the two films strikingly similar.Only when the one woman is determined to not put on the diving suit of a dead person does the storytelling improve.  This is what, 45 minutes in?  Even the death scene before this is exaggerated and uninteresting.  You really have to wait a while for things to improve and I honestly can't blame you if the boredom sets in sooner rather than later and encourages you to shut the movie off.Luckily the second half of the movie actually lives up to the suspense that was promised through the advertisements.  It's an underwater diving mission through deep dark caves that goes horribly wrong for the entire diving team, and people die one by one.  That just about sums up what you can expect.The storyline eventually improves as the film rolls forward so you probably won't be disappointed in the end, but again, the beginning is torturous for viewers because of the blandness and mediocrity of the writing.  You've been warned.  There's even a touching moment involving a father and son, which is probably the number one reason I'm giving Sanctum a passing grade.

1371851,A1V74MGUYUUFAK,B003Y5H51K,"Bob ""seabgb""","[0, 1]","I watched this streaming on Amazon just last night. I thought I would just have something on in the background while I cooked dinner but I soon got engrossed and had to sit down and give it my full attention. So why did I like it and so many other not like it?For one thing, I consider myself somewhat of an adventurer. At least, I like to do adventurous things. I have never participated as a spelunker or gone cave diving, but I am a diver and have owned and operated my own ocean adventure business, primarily wreck, wall, and cage diving with sharks. I like to think of myself as someone who would remain calm under pressure. Fact is, when push comes to shove, you never really know how you'll react.People complain about the dialogue. It didn't bother me. It's sparse, and very job-centric, meaning. most of the time, people are talking about what they're doing or what they're about to do. I'll agree that in the very beginning, when we're meeting a couple of the characters, some of the conversation is less than convincing. I mean, we're given a chance to see characters interacting before the tragedy strikes, in the hope that through this interaction, we'll get to know them and their relationships better. For some, this conversation or dialogue didn't work. Maybe they thought it was flat and two-dimensional. Fact is, these characters, these explorers, ARE two-dimensional. People who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of something like this have to be two-dimensional. It's called focus. And part of the story has to do with this very two-dimensionality and the cost that it has on father and son.The action and exploration of the cave, particularly after the storm hits, is very realistic and at times upsetting and gruesome. Claustrophobics will have a difficult time with this movie, especially, I would think, in 3-d. I didn't see it in 3-d. There are also two pivotal and very dramatic scenes that I wouldn't want kids to watch.Speaking of these two scenes. The movie is produced, in part, by Cameron, and during these scenes, you can't help but think of Cameron and the movie, The Abyss. These two scenes are very dramatic and intense, but knowing of and appreciating Cameron's fictional work and some of his obsessions yanks you temporarily out of the movie.I can't say I was completely invested in the characters or that I cared all that much about them. I felt sorry for them at times. And the challenges, pain, tragedy, they had to face and struggle through, kept me on the edge of my seat. Mostly, what I liked about the movie was its study of leadership and survival, the hard decisions only a true leader can make. By the end of the movie, you're left with a better understanding of what it takes to be a real explorer and leader, the cost real leadership can have on a person's private life.There's is a scene in the film where it becomes obvious the cavers are going to be in a life and death struggle, that the chances for survival are very small.

It would have been worth watching for me if just the outer scenes of the cave entrance were shown - WOW.  I am assuming they are CGI but they are still breathtaking.The movie was based VERY loosely on the true-life experiences of writer Andrew Wight.  The changes definitely spiced up the movie but I wish it had been based more on the real experiences.  It was a great caving and exploration movie but I think too much was made of saying it was inspired by true-life experiences.  Of course, Pannikin Plain Cave is nowhere as spectacular as the images shown for the movie.  Oh well.  Truth or art?I liked Richard Roxburgh as Frank, the Dad and head diver.  I liked Rhys Wakefield as Josh, the son.  Both did a great job.  The other actors were good also.  Not a lot of dialogue in the movie and actually not a huge plot.  Group goes in cave, gets stuck in cave, has mishaps and tries to get out of cave.  But the images were beautiful.  I liked the computer model tour of the cave system shown towards the beginning of the film.All in all, I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone that likes diving, caves or adventure films.

1371856,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003Y5H51K,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 4]","""Sanctum"" exemplifies what happens when innovation becomes more important than a screenplay. The story is contrived, calculating, and unpleasant, but never fear - James Cameron is the executive producer, and he will see to it that we gawk helplessly at the difficult camerawork, the authentically claustrophobic sets, and the 3D effects. Perhaps it was his intention for director Alister Grierson to experience his own private version of ""The Abyss,"" a technological breakthrough that came at the expense of a notoriously difficult shoot. The only difference is that, this time around, the needless suffering is reflected in the finished film, which tells a story so bleak and simple-minded that it's an insult to audiences, especially the ones that paid extra for the 3D glasses.It's said to be based on a true story, but considering the way the plot unfolds, I can't help but take that claim with a grain of salt. It depicts an ill-fated scuba-diving expedition in Papua New Guinea's Esa-ala, a vast network of underground caves; the plan was to surpass a base camp deep beneath the surface and continue further in, but things take a turn for the worst when a massive storm floods the cave's opening and traps the people within. According to the team leader, Frank (Richard Roxburgh), it's merely a matter of finding an underground river and following its current, for all rivers flow towards the sea. He would, of course, say something like that, for he understands caves far better than the mind-numbing routine of CDs, mortgages, and fatherhood.I've admitted in the past that I don't understand the thought processes of mountain climbers and thrill seekers. But movies about such people are usually made in such a way that we, the audience, can somehow respond to the unexplainable lure of nature. The best current example is ""127 Hours""; even with James Franco's arm pinned between a dislodged bolder and a canyon wall, director Danny Boyle had the decency to explore the simplistic beauty of Blue John Canyon, to show the rock formations bathed in sunlight. Compare this to ""Sanctum,"" which takes place almost entirely within the confines of cramped, desolate, dark, waterlogged caves. Such locations fail to inspire a sense of awe. Because of this, it's virtually impossible to sympathize with any of the characters.Not that they were well developed in the first place. Their primary function is to spew inane dialogue before displaying many of the ways in which a person can die in a scuba expedition. By the end of the movie, we will have seen examples of the bends, hypothermia, broken bones, and drowning - which, I'm sorry to say, isn't always an accidental occurrence. One of the characters, the girlfriend of the expedition's financier, is inexperienced as both a scuba diver and a mountain climber, and that sort of makes me wonder why she was allowed to join in the first place. She, along with just about everyone else, is as disposable as a teenager in a slasher film, and about as authentically written.The only two characters that matter are Frank and his son, Josh (Rhys Wakefield). The more scenes they share, the more obvious it becomes that ""Sanctum"" was manufactured strictly for the purposes of watching them reconnect. They have never gotten along; Frank is an explorer who hears only to the call of the wild, and Josh has been forced to partake. But they have more in common than it might first appear, a revelation that pretty much exists only in movies like this. They will eventually find themselves in a commonplace survival scenario, one that involves someone who has gone mad out of desperation to escape. I'd expect this kind of thing from a western or a horror movie, but not from a man-against-nature drama.Although not credited as one of the writers, I have an uneasy feeling that James Cameron contributed to the screenplay. Let me make it clear that I've always championed him as a filmmaker and storyteller, and that includes his latest effort, the monumentally successful ""Avatar."" But now, I feel I must admit that, in one key area, he has consistently disappointed me: The man has a tin ear for dialogue. With ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss,"" ""Titanic,"" and now with ""Sanctum,"" there is not a single line that sounds like something a person would actually say. You know something is wrong when the only way to counteract the effects of a bad scene is to overcompensate with foul language, which flows freely in just about every scene.

1371857,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Y5H51K,C. Sawin,"[15, 21]","Sanctum certainly seems to have a lot of potential, doesn't it? It was filmed in 3D and produced by Avatar director James Cameron. Even if you're like me and not completely sold by the TV spots and trailers, it's bound to be decent because Cameron is somewhat involved, right? Keep telling yourself that. Sanctum is probably the most disappointing theatrical experience in the first few months of the year.You'll probably notice how fantastic the film looks. Sanctum was obviously filmed in 3D and uses the same techniques Cameron used for Avatar, which also isn't surprising. Nearly everything seems to jump off the screen, but at the same time the film doesn't really have any standout moments where the effect is utilized in a way that really wows its audience. Most of the underwater scenes are spectacular though. Seeing those vast underwater cavities, even if they were probably mostly created in front of a green screen, is incredible. There are also several scenes where you're looking at the giant hole in the earth the main characters first enter as if you were looking down from the sky while it's raining that are really memorable because of the perspective. So at face value, Sanctum has the appearance of a good film or at least a decent one.Nearly everything else about the film is awful. You know things are going to go downhill once Josh mutters the line, ""What could possibly go wrong in a cave?"" Everyone in the film just makes terrible decisions from then on out. Remember that thing that happened last time? Let's make it a point to mention that, so it won't happen again. Sure enough, it happens again. DON'T do whatever you're thinking about doing. I know it's a drastic situation and you have to think on your toes, but you will surely die if you do what you're thinking of doing. So what does the person do? That thing they were advised not to. So guess what happens? Josh and Victoria are probably the worst of them. Josh points out the stupidest of observations. When the cave first starts to flood, he's in the team heading to the surface but decides to go back for his dad and the others still down in the cave. The cave is flooding. Water is pouring in. It's very obvious what's happening. So Josh runs in, around rocks, all out of breath and calling out to his dad. When he reaches the cave entrance, he yells out the brilliant statement that, ""THE CAVE IS FLOODING!"" Gee, you think? Victoria does something in the film that is incredibly stupid and you know it is right when she does it, then later looks back on it realizing she should have done what she was advised to do in the first place. Do you want to defile a dead woman's corpse or develop hypothermia and freeze to death? The answer should be obvious. The rest of the characters aren't so great either though. Josh's dad, Frank, is basically emotionless and nothing more than an Australian version of Christian Bale's Batman while Ioan Gruffudd's Carl is the typical selfish character that makes a lot of over the top decisions that never pay off.Throw in the lame attempts at humor and terrible dialogue and you have yourself an hour and forty nine minute groanfest. Carl mentions something about Frank's anus being so tight that a dog won't be able to hear him fart while Crazy George spews nothing but bad jokes and even worse dialogue the entire film. Developing the clap in Mexico along with advising to grow gills if your equipment goes faulty and telling someone to calm down because the ""panic vulture sits on your shoulder"" are all things that are memorable for all the wrong reasons.Some of the tight spaces traveled through while underwater were able to trigger my claustrophobia at times, but it was nothing that hadn't been done better before. Remember The Descent? Most of me was wanting Crawlers to show up and kill everyone in this horrible film after it was established that every character had been dropped on their head at some point in their childhood. The other part of me was wondering why this pushed for an R-rating. Other than a few brief moments of gore and the F-bomb being dropped a few dozen times, the film could've easily been edited down to a PG-13 rating to appeal to a wider audience. Then again, with Cameron's name slapped onto the film and the main marketing ploy, maybe a PG-13 film that mostly takes place underwater would remind too many people of Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss and make them think it was a remake or something. Well, let me tell you, this doesn't come anywhere close to even touching The Abyss.Sanctum is a dull, predictable, and cliche thriller with terrible dialogue, a lame attempt at humor, some of the dumbest characters to ever be included in a film, and just a rather underwhelming journey in the end. Don't go into this expecting it to be another Avatar just because Cameron is connected to the film in some way or because it was filmed in 3D. Don't even expect a good film. If you have any interest in Sanctum, I recommend waiting for the rental because it really isn't worth paying expensive movie theater ticket prices in addition to whatever you have to pay for 3D

Well, looks were deceiving in this case. First off, this is one of the worst blu ray transfers I have ever seen. Most of the visuals were still amazing, but it was disappointing that they were grainy. Second, the acting and writing here is extremely poor. It's hard to care about any of the characters or believe they are actually in peril when you're constantly cringing. Third, the story never reaches its potential...it doesn't do enough to hold an audience for more than five minutes at a time. I understand that the intent was to make a realistic movie, but come on, even if they had thrown in some cheesy cave monster or some tribe of underground cavemen at least the movie have been interesting. I'm not saying that this movie necessarily needed a major plot change...it's just that I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen that would make me care, it never did. I am relieved that I picked up a used blu ray copy rather than spending over $20 for a new copy I will probably end up giving away.The blu ray extras where nothing to get excited about. There is a short documentary featuring the actors and of course James Cameron talking about the making of the film. Most of which centers around the actors talking about their experience working with green screen/CGI technology and whining about how difficult the stunts were.In the end this is a movie you can feel free to skip.

I should have done so because this is a captivating thriller that pushes a lot of emotional buttons in the audience. Even viewing it at home, I can see clearly that some highly sophisticated cameras where in operation here. This is a human story more so than anything else and a fantastic adventure. I was pretty shocked that the death scenes turned out to be so brutal. This was not because of anything gory or grotesque but because the filmmakers put the viewer into the boots of the characters so well that once someone bites the proverbial bullet, it stings much more than in a typical action thriller where people are dying in every other frame of film.The character of the father may remind many of their own old man, a no nonsense, go for broke fanatic that keeps his more delicate emotions firmly in check while lashing out in anger whenever someone questions his leadership. His son is one member of the new generation of men, sensitive and spoiled, self-centered and attention seeking. The father-son confrontation of wills was a big part of the backbone of this film. The underwater photography glorious and the set design claustrophobic and unsettling.There are many other cave movies out there, ( The Cave, The Descent and so on ), and most of them rely on tried and true terrors such as monsters and mutants hiding in the dark and waiting for their victims. What I enjoyed about Sanctum is that it forgoes those cliches in favor of a more classic duel between man and nature. The natural world is remarkably beautiful and profoundly dangerous. I personally am not a big fan of cave exploration myself, preferring to get my adrenaline and adventure in other ways, but Sanctum seems to both summon people to explore and at the same time warn them about the possibilities when things go horribly wrong.The Australian accents can get a bit difficult to understand sometimes, but that's what subtitles are for.

1371863,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003Y5H51K,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","SANCTUM (dir. Alastair Grierson, prod. James Cameron, 2011, 115 minutes). This was an interesting film. The gag reflex had to be defeated in order to make myself continue to watch it after the first 15 minutes: the childish dialogue and set-up was right out of the worst attempts at copying Spielberg I've ever seen.Briefly, a bunch of dodos in Papua, New Guinea, who fancy themselves ""cavers"" (cave explorers; we always called them ""spelunkers"") are arrived in time to get down to their forward base camp. This is deep in the bowels of the earth, in some fictional cave system that is not yet fully explored. Down there awaits a team of fanatic cavers. Just what the doctor ordered.The unfathomably awful Ioan Gruffudd, with his usual lousy American accent (why is he never British?) plays the millionaire wannabe explorer. The great, chameleonic Richard Roxburgh is the gruff old cave expert based at the front camp deep in the cave. The beautiful danseur-noble-like Rhys Wakefield is Josh, son of the old caveman and reluctant heir to the cave-explorer king's throne. Watch this kid intently, he has a sparkling career ahead and I can't wait to see it. Hence, my opinion (exclusively reserved for Wakefiled) that 'we all have to start someplace'.Naturally a phenomenal storm is on the way, in fact it is imminent, but the handful of dummies descend all the way to the base camp. Everyone already knows the entire cave will flood within 3 days or less - so why not go onward? Sure, go on, weather reports are for babies.The fact is, this is a typical sub-par disaster movie and that angered me. One grisly death after another made me even more unhappy. 30 minutes in, the first death occurs: an experienced colleague who drowns. 50 minutes in, the next death: an old assistant native cave expert, so badly injured that he has to be drowned. Just over 1 hour in, the 3rd death occurs though we see that one coming. 1 hour, 17 minutes in comes the 4th death but she was so annoying it was almost enjoyable knowing she'd be out of the way.That 4th death (Gruffudd's annoying girlfriend) plays a key role in the evil mess that occurs, when Gruffudd goes insane and breaks Roxburgh's back. It's actually poor Rhys, who plays Roxburgh's son and does vaguely resemble him, who has to drown Roxburgh. Do cavers really do this on a regular basis?! Anyway, there's your 5th death and by my count, only one of all the deaths was NOT by drowning. What's with all the drowning??The 6th death is perhaps the well-deserved one: Gruffudd, drowned and floating ignobly close to his own salvation. (Earlier in the film Gruffudd screams when he catches fire - that's right, fire and my point is if that's really him, he screams like a little girl.) Cheap, cruddy attempts at drama, though many may see it differently.Only Rhys makes it out alive, and the film thankfully ends at that point. Oddly enough, no sign of rain when he emerges onto the beach, like a nymph from the deep. Me, I don't care for deaths-and-disasters-as-morality-play. Fortunately we are left with the fantastic image of Wakefield emerging safe and sound. Of course if we imagine it a bit, we realize his character will be completely insane after what he's been through, but, what the heck ....The location (Gold Coast, Australia) is all breathtaking and the cinematography is excellent. At times I felt I was watching old episodes of ""Land of the Lost"", but that's because this is a gigantic fictitious cave. Couldn't be helped. The soundtrack is a Philip Glass-like accompaniment I found odd in such a dramatic, lethal animadventure. But then this whole thing seemed to have been written by a high school dropout.Get it if you must, but I wouldn't watch it again no matter how bored I became. That is why I have a gigantic and well-explored DVD collection and you should, too. My advice: leave this one unpurchased unless you wish to fully archive the undoubtedly stellar career awaiting gorgeous Aussie Rhys Wakefield.",2,"""Life is not a dress rehearsal"" ... but this film needed more than its share of them!",1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,3976,"['SANCTUM', 'dir', 'Alastair', 'Grierson', 'prod', 'James', 'Cameron', '2011', '115', 'minutes', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'gag', 'reflex', 'had', 'be', 'defeated', 'order', 'make', 'continue', 'watch', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'childish', 'dialogue', 'set-up', 'was', 'right', 'worst', 'attempts', 'copying', 'Spielberg', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Briefly', 'bunch', 'dodos', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'who', 'fancy', 'cavers', 'cave', 'explorers', 'always', 'called', 'spelunkers', 'are', 'arrived', 'time', 'get', 'down', 'forward', 'base', 'camp', 'deep', 'bowels', 'earth', 'fictional', 'cave', 'system', 'not', 'yet', 'fully', 'explored', 'team', 'fanatic', 'cavers', 'Just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered.The', 'unfathomably', 'awful', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'usual', 'lousy', 'American', 'accent', 'why', 'never', 'British', 'millionaire', 'wannabe', 'explorer', 'great', 'chameleonic', 'Richard', 'Roxburgh', 'gruff', 'old', 'cave', 'expert', 'based', 'front', 'camp', 'deep', 'cave', 'beautiful', 'danseur-noble-like', 'Rhys', 'Wakefield', 'Josh', 'son', 'old', 'caveman', 'reluctant', 'heir', 'cave-explorer', 'king', 'throne', 'Watch', 'kid', 'intently', 'sparkling', 'career', 'ahead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Hence', 'opinion', 'exclusively', 'reserved', 'Wakefiled', 'have', 'start', ""someplace'.Naturally"", 'phenomenal', 'storm', 'way', 'fact', 'imminent', 'handful', 'dummies', 'descend', 'way', 'base', 'camp', 'Everyone', 'already', 'entire', 'cave', 'will', 'flood', '3', 'days', 'less', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'onward', 'Sure', 'go', 'weather', 'reports', 'are', 'babies.The', 'fact', 'typical', 'sub-par', 'disaster', 'movie', 'angered', 'One', 'grisly', 'death', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'unhappy', '30', 'minutes', 'first', 'death', 'occurs', 'experienced', 'colleague', 'who', '50', 'minutes', 'next', 'death', 'old', 'assistant', 'native', 'cave', 'expert', 'so', 'badly', 'injured', 'be', 'drowned', 'Just', '1', 'hour', '3rd', 'death', 'occurs', 'see', 'one', 'coming', '1', 'hour', '17', 'minutes', '4th', 'death', 'was', 'so', 'annoying', 'was', 'almost', 'enjoyable', 'knowing', ""'d"", 'be', 'way.That', '4th', 'death', 'Gruffudd', 'annoying', 'girlfriend', 'key', 'role', 'evil', 'mess', 'when', 'Gruffudd', 'insane', 'Roxburgh', 'back', 'actually', 'poor', 'Rhys', 'who', 'Roxburgh', 'son', 'vaguely', 'resemble', 'who', 'drown', 'Roxburgh', 'Do', 'cavers', 'really', 'do', 'regular', 'basis', 'Anyway', '5th', 'death', 'count', 'only', 'one', 'deaths', 'was', 'NOT', 'drowning', 'What', 'drowning', '6th', 'death', 'perhaps', 'well-deserved', 'one', 'Gruffudd', 'drowned', 'floating', 'ignobly', 'close', 'own', 'salvation', 'Earlier', 'film', 'Gruffudd', 'screams', 'when', 'fire', 'right', 'fire', 'point', 'really', 'little', 'girl', 'Cheap', 'cruddy', 'attempts', 'drama', 'many', 'may', 'see', 'differently.Only', 'Rhys', 'out', 'alive', 'film', 'thankfully', 'point', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'sign', 'rain', 'when', 'beach', 'nymph', 'deep', 'Me', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'deaths-and-disasters-as-morality-play', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'left', 'fantastic', 'image', 'Wakefield', 'emerging', 'safe', 'sound', 'course', 'imagine', 'bit', 'realize', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'insane', 'what', 'been', 'what', 'heck', 'location', 'Gold', 'Coast', 'Australia', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'old', 'episodes', 'Land', 'Lost', 'gigantic', 'fictitious', 'cave', 'Could', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', 'soundtrack', 'Philip', 'Glass-like', 'accompaniment', 'found', 'odd', 'such', 'dramatic', 'lethal', 'animadventure', 'then', 'whole', 'thing', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'high', 'school', 'dropout.Get', 'must', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'matter', 'how', 'bored', 'became', 'why', 'have', 'gigantic', 'well-explored', 'DVD', 'collection', 'should', 'too', 'advice', 'leave', 'one', 'unpurchased', 'wish', 'fully', 'archive', 'undoubtedly', 'stellar', 'career', 'awaiting', 'gorgeous', 'Aussie', 'Rhys', 'Wakefield']",Sanctum

Of course, a tropical storm is on the way, but they all believe they'll be just fine, with a few days to spare. The storm turns into a typhoon, the comm system goes down, and the team is trapped deep in the earth as the torrent of rain causes the water to rise within the caverns and threaten their lives. In the midst of these struggles, we find a teenaged boy at odds with his famous explorer-dad, and others who are more interested in self-preservation than in any act of human decency. We find bits of ""The Abyss,"" ""Alien,"" and ""The Descent"" all mish-mashed into a colossal mess.The first obstacle for me was the ridiculous dialogue, which sounded like teenagers trying to impress friends and screenwriters trying to fabricate drama. The next obstacle was the world-class explorers who panic and turn on each other the moment any danger hits. The third obstacle was the typhoon which arrives in seeming minutes, with no time to warn anyone even though a storm was known to be approaching days earlier. The fourth obstacle was watching experienced explorers leave others far behind in caves and then asking where they are. This is just ridiculous behavior by anyone who has spent more than a few hours outdoors or in the wild. The fifth obstacle was the tribal man shown three or four times for no purpose other than to suggest, I guess, that he has called this storm upon those desecrating his land with their exploration. If, in fact, he was meant to issue a warning, he never did so. It seemed his purpose was forgotten by the directors and writers. The sixth reason was that the film's two women are said to be adventurous in one case, and very experienced at cave-exploration in the other case, yet both die due to their own panicky reactions to things. Apparently women just can't handle the pressure of being in such a pathetic movie.I stopped caring ten minutes into the movie, but kept watching for the few scenes of beauty and natural wonder (the only reason for giving it one star). I began hating the script forty minutes into it, and by the hour-mark I hated myself for wasting a dollar and my evening. If you're like me, you'll want to pass on this mess.

1371868,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003Y5H51K,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","SANCTUM (defined as a holy site and a place where one is free from intrusion) is touted to be a film by James Cameron of Titanic and Avatar fame: he is only a producer.  This 3D film would likely be more interesting in a theater where the 3D aspects of the photography by Jules O'Laughlin would enhance the beauty of the film.  But given those aspects of this little movie SANCTUM is a visual delight, a harrowing experience of witnessing nature at her most angry, and a bit of a sentimental slight story about father and son relationships and the interaction of humans when pitted against the hostile vagaries of Nature. Of note this film was written by Australian underwater explorer and photographer Andrew Wight (with assistance from John Garvin and may be based on some true adventures.Frank McClure (Richard Roxburgh is a grumpy, hard cave explorer and diver exploring the Esa-ala Caves off New Guinea with his trusty support team (Dan Wyllie, Christopher Baker, Nicole Downs, and Cramer Cain) when he is joined by the wealthy but shallow thrill seeker Carl (Ioan Gruffudd), his climber girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson) and Frank's seventeen year old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield, a remarkably impressive handsome young actor from Queensland, Australia): Frank and Josh have never been close nor understood each other.  The mission is to explore the cave's connection to the sea and all goes well until the descent begins.  A storm begins and becomes a cyclone, filling the cave with rushing water in which members of the exploration team are lost. As the numbers of the groups taper down we're left with a father/son confrontation before the explorer party dwindles down to one.Director Alister Grierson in tandem with his special effects people make the most out of this rather superficial and flimsy script.  The cast is Australian and Welsh for the most part and the film was shot primarily in Australia.  The scenery, both above and below the ground is the real star here and the film's primary appeal is the nature of Nature. Keep expectations low and the film will entertain.

Shame on Cameron for this pathetic marketing grab.  I cannot fathom how this man felt this movie would help his reputation.Sanctum is a terrible movie experience.  I found nothing redeeming in this mish-mash of movie cliches and horrible wastes of money.1.  The acting is atrocious.  Everyone is over-acting or just failing miserably in every sense of the word.  Not only is there a sheer lack of talent here but they show absolutely no conscious ability to even remotely get into the situation they are supposed to be in.  However this is due to two larger issues as well.2.  Embarrassing writing.  The screenplay for this film is a giant steaming turd.  The characters are all unlikable.  Not a single one has any redeeming trait.  The film basically moves from one terrible movie cliche to the next.  We have the pouty teenage boy rebelling from his famous explorer dad, the over cocky no fear rich guy with his snotty out of her league girlfriend, the abrasive father who pushes too hard, and the sage sidekick with some ironic ailment for the job he is doing.  Everything in this film is predictable and the writers didn't seem to care.  Whats worse is the pathetic attempts to generate drama are insulting.  The father son quarrels and bonding moments a midst a major disaster are just ludicrous and had me literally cursing the screen.3.  Directing.  The director got nothing out of his actors here and most likely was incompetent to do anything different.  The actors had no flow.  One minute they would be screaming and crying, the next minute they are smiling, joking around and taking pictures like tourists.  This is not just bad acting, it's bad directing.  Clearly the actors were losing their sense of direction from a broken up shooting schedule.  The director should have kept them in the moment but failed to do so.  The main character is this no name teenage boy whose basic range of acting is grinning like a moron to squinting really hard when trying to cry.  Just pathetic.4.  Cinematography.  The main character in this film was supposed to be the cave but the combination of terrible camera work combined with shoddy CGI just made the whole film look terrible.  Half the time you couldn't see anything because the cameras just couldn't catch the action.  Camera angles and positions were poorly chosen and I suspect budget concerns didn't allow for many reshoots.  Later on in the film they give you wide angle shots of CGI caves that are so far back you can't make anything out.  Much of the film has you starring at a rock wall with no clue where you are supposed to look.By about halfway through the film I stopped caring if these morons made it out of the cave alive.  Perhaps most insulting was how it climaxes.  There was no story, just some cheesy disaster film thrown together with no direction and a lot of bogus cheesy film cliches.  Waste of time and money.  Don't even rent this one.  It only encourages them to make more of this trash.

1371878,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B003Y5H51K,Jason,"[60, 68]","Based on a real life, near death caving experience, Sanctum is a thriller that squeezes claustrophobic audiences into tight, dark spaces, and forces all viewers to imagine and evaluate their personal fortitude if put in a precarious situation.Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh), a professional cave diver compared to Jacques Cousteau and Neil Armstrong, is on a caving/cave-diving expedition with his highly trained team and his mercurial son Josh (Rhys Wakefield).  Exploring the Esaala Caves in Papua New Guinea, the team has to traverse thousands of meters of virgin caves in order to ultimately find a connection to the sea.  The eccentric financier, Carl (Ioan Gruffudd), with experience sky diving, caving, and cave diving, stalag-might have a problem with an imminent typhoon that threatens the expedition.  The team is in over their heads when Mother Nature expedites the timeline; and they must navigate an underwater labyrinth in order to survive.Similar to a real surfer watching Point Break, a rock climber watching Cliffhanger, or a skydiver watching...Point Break, there are plenty of technicalities to nitpick.  The point, however, is entertainment, not a documentary.  While utterly predictable during most moments, the movie nonetheless whitens knuckles and squeezes air from lungs.  Beautifully rendered and lit, the cinematography had to naturally extend a little creative license in order to capture some of the brilliant underwater scenes.  Particularly thrilling were the wide-angle cave diving shots and the crystal clear caverns.  If pristine, unexplored worlds, alien to the average human eye were intended, then kudos are warranted.While I enjoyed the script (regardless of predictability), the dialogue was weak at times.  The worst moment was during a particularly harrowing moment, when water was flooding a portion of the cave system, young Josh declares to his father, ""The cave is flooding.""  Department of Redundancy Department calling.  The lines not withstanding, the emotional stress on the key players is appropriate but tired.  Of course the father and son butt heads.  Yep, the son transforms during the film and accepts responsibility.  Does someone make an honorable sacrifice to aid the team?  Guaranteed.  I suppose some spokes are necessary for the wheel.Ultimately I enjoyed Sanctum.

If you're short of cash, you may not want to pay a premium to see this epic in 3D (It's also available in 2D).This is almost one of those ""And Then There Were None"" sagas, because characters are drowning very regularly in this one. There is a classic battle going on between a strong-willed father and an equally determined son. The stubborn, tyrannical father has spent his adult life exploring caves with great danger to himself and to those around him. He's a cold-blooded, some would call a maniacal spelunker. Cave exploration, it seems, involves mountain-climbing skills, underwater diving, toying with death, and conflict-management.Of course in such an endeavor you have to have an ambitious, willful, selfish, risk-taking villain who defies orders, is nasty and puts others at risk. For most of the 109 minutes of movie running time, you are in these caves that are lit well enough to see the actors, and it's bright enough to see them get knocked off. There are no creatures down there to threaten them which may put off some animal enthusiasts in the audience.The actors all do a credible job, but I never heard of any of them. James Cameron was executive producer, but it doesn't look as if he played a very active part in the creative end of the production. The special effects are not particularly noteworthy.There's excitement, suspense, and you can't help becoming involved, but somehow it lacks that creative spark that's needed. It's non-stop action which younger viewers liked. One thing I discovered about 3D movies.

1371895,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B003Y5H51K,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","The title of this excellent film is particularly well chosen, as ""sanctum"" means a secret place known only to few people and also a sacred or holy area. This film tells the story of a group of people who are forced by circumstances to enter such a place - and then try desperately to find a way out... This review contains some limited SPOILERS.Produced by James Cameron this film contains some elements (the masterful use of lights and shadows, a predisposition for blue and gray, some very dramatic fast happening scenes) which remind of his films. It was however directed by an Australian director, Alister Grierson, who made only one film before, ""Kokoda"", which was a rather good war movie. With the exception of Ioan Gruffudd actors were unknown to me, but they all did an excellent job.The story is relatively simple. A group of cave-divers is slowly and methodically exploring and mapping a HUGE complex of partially inundated caves in New Guinea. An unexpected development will force them to explore this place in depth (pun very much intentional) and on the double, taking enormous risks - and I am not saying anything more.This film has absolutely NO supernatural elements - do not expect monsters, mysterious forces, etc. Everything is realistic, sometimes inspired by real problems met by speleologists and cave-divers in the real life - even if the accumulation of all those events during just one expedition is of course rather unlikely, but after all this is an adventure film...The atmosphere of the place of action is absolutely unique. There are moments that I really had the impression that heroes entered a kind of grandiose heathen temple, immensely ancient and so holy that it was never meant to be seen by humans. And indeed, at moments there seems that there is a HIGH price to pay for discovering secrets and splendors, which were not really meant for us. It can almost seem that those who entered there were not meant to leave - and this chtonic ""inner sanctum"" will show great reluctance to release those who violated its peace...There are many excellent scenes in this film but none so tense and moving as the great finale, an absolutely unique thing different from anything else I saw on the screen. I was absolutely delighted with this film both in cinema and on Blu-ray (I warmly recommend to buy Blu-ray, as the visual aspect is important) and I am absolutely keeping this film to re-watch it another time in the future.

That being a cave in the South Pacific.  Our adventurers are trying to figure out how all the rainwater that comes in through a giant hole in the ground makes its way to the ocean.  Couldn't all this energy and money be better spent on finding a cure for cancer or a better way to avoid traffic?  Why would anyone care about rain finding its way through a cave?  The thrill is the journey, I guess.We start out with the grizzled expert played by Richard Roxburgh (""Moulin Rouge""), his teen-age son, his financier (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend, and an assortment of guides and long time companions.  We know that a tropical storm is approaching, but since it's a day or two away, what the hell, let's go diving!  Now we know based on the filmmaker playbook only one or two will make it out alive.  Sure enough, the storm comes quicker than expected - nice communication - and the flooding begins, cutting off the explorers escape route.  We can pretty much pick off the casualty order although it is more difficult with this film because of the unknown Aussie cast.  So then we have to watch for each cast member to do something stupid that will effectively cause his or her doom.  The script is full of clich&eacute;s and we have a lot of yelling.The movie does have its moments however.  When the actors manage to shut up, there are some pretty tense scenes squeezing through small openings, getting tangled, getting lost and getting frustrated.  The film also contains some beautiful photography.  Some is underwater and some in real and artificial caves.  The film is rated ""R"" because of a few too many ""F"" bombs.  I suspect it might have done better in theaters with a PG-13.

It annoyed me that Josh blamed his father for that lady drowning...she was freaking tired. he should have demanded her to stay but since she went she wasn't in the state of mind and panicked so fast. I know nothing about diving but I'm sure that if she had gotten rest, her thoughts would have been a lot more clear. When the storm was first starting and those four people were coming back up and they started screaming and dadada, i think they could have made that scene into a 2 minute than instead of what it was. I loved George's character, when he got decompression sickness and was dying that made me upset. It really annoyed me when they were like telling Frank not to drown that one guy that broken every bone in his body like really, so you gonna let him be in pain? i was thinking you are idiots. When Frank and his son made it to where that military thing was they could have done something to get out in my opinion, and than why go back?!?! And all that drama between Karl between Frank and Josh my god....cut that whole crap out...Freaking psycho he deserved to get left alone in the first place. OOH and about his girlfriend if you are unexperienced why they heck are you going down there? I thought Karl said that they met at another expedition that maybe she knew something but than Frank was she came down here knowing nothing, mistake number one and mistake number 2....blah blah blah...where was the sense from her and her boyfriend obviously not where its supposed to be!!! When the son drowned his daddy cuz he was hurt and slowly dying, not gonna lie it made me tear up cuz at that point you just saw that the boy finally understood his father.

1371922,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003Y5H51K,trebe,"[1, 1]","Set in Papua New Guinea, Sanctum (2011) is a film about the struggle to survive in an elaborate system of underground tunnels.  It begins with a wide scope, focusing on a group of scientists exploring a huge cave, and then narrows down to center on a small group of survivors who become trapped underground.With James Cameron as executive producer, Sanctum has some nicely done underwater sequences, and some cinematic views of nature.  Unlike recent films like The Descent (2005) or The Cave (2005), Sanctum does not feature a threat from some kind of vicious creature.  Instead the danger comes mostly from natural causes.  While Sanctum scores some points in the technical departments, it doesn't exactly break a lot of new ground, and is also weak in character development, dialog, and realism.  The film tries hard, but doesn't quite succeed in telling a story that connects emotionally with the audience.Expert cave diver Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) is the leader of an expedition exploring a huge subterranean cave, which consists of a system of tunnels, with several sections that are flooded with water.  With bad weather on the way, the team is hurrying to complete their work, before the rains come.  McGuire's son Josh (Rhys Wakefield), has just arrived back at camp with Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffudd), the man bankrolling the expedition, and Victoria Elaine (Alice Parkinson) his girlfriend.Incredibly, those at ground level loose communication with the team below, and are unable to warn them that a huge storm has suddenly arrived, and heavy rains soon begin to flood the cave.  Josh doesn't have the best relationship with his father, and they have an argument after a diver accidentally dies.  Josh is on his way out of the cave, but returns to make an unsuccessful attempt to get his father and others on the lower level out, before they are trapped.  Instead, Josh finds himself among those imprisoned, with the route to the surface blocked by water.Frank immediately takes control of the situation, euthanizing a friend who is gravely injured.  Although he has no solid information about the weather conditions, McGuire feels that the group must continue to descend to avoid being drowned, and somehow find a path to the sea.  The survivors include Josh, Carl, Victoria, and Crazy George (Dan Wyllie), a long time member of McGuire's crew who has been banned from diving for health reasons.  Although she has no diving experience, Victoria manages to make it through a tight squeeze in an underwater cave, as the group emerges in an unexplored underground cavern.  As Frank continues to push forward, constantly barking orders like a drill sergeant, conditions soon begin to worsen.Once the explorers are trapped, no attention whatsoever is given to anyone outside of the cave, until the very end of the film.  While the survivors may be on their own, and a rescue attempt might be futile, totally ignoring those above seems odd.  There is a brief interlude when the survivors can see the sky, as they explore the remains of a tank from World War II, but they choose to reenter the caves and continue on an underground path.  You have to cut filmmakers some slack for any film set in a cave, as the lighting is almost never realistic.  Even so, Sanctum lacks realism in many other ways.  Swimming in chilly water, the survivors should all be freezing, but only Victoria is shivering.  These people are constantly wet, yet again, only Victoria shows any signs of being cold.  There's a lot of skin exposed, but the group remains injury and scrape free, except for a small mark of Josh's arm.  In general, the geography is pretty whacked, as the group conveniently finds an unlikely path to the sea.Besides a tale of survival, Sanctum is also about the evolution of Frank and Josh's relationship in a crisis.  The situation is rather clich&eacute;d, as Frank's passion for exploring caves has cost him his family.  The explorer comes across as such an arrogant dislikeable bastard, as Josh and the rest, discover just how hard survival can be.  Enduring the physical hardships involved in making the film, the acting performances by the mostly Australian cast are generally good, probably doing justice to the implausible script.  Rhys Wakefield is a young actor with a lot of potential and good screen presence.  Alice Parkinson is a stunning beauty, who is put through some tough physical trials, and hopefully will be seen much more in the future.  Ioan Gruffudd, known for playing Reed Richards, isn't quite as noble here.Coming into the project, director Alister Grierson did not have a lot of feature film experience, but he meets the challenge fairly well, delivering an entertaining, but flawed action/adventure that feels like a slightly manipulated ride.  With a little more thought and effort, Sanctum clearly could have achieved much more, but various plot issues keep the film from having more impact.",3,a grim and dramatic journey through Carl's bad

The beautifully shot Australian film is about an expedition team led by a veteran cave diver Frank (Richard Roxburgh). The group explores an underwater cave system in Papua New Guinea, but when a cyclone suddenly hits the area, the expedition goes terribly wrong.Fantastic cinematography cannot disguise a run-of-the-mill script and stock characters including Frank's twenty-something son Josh (Rhys Wakefield), the team's financial backer Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson). Like the passengers in ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" they struggle to survive. One major difference is that in ""Sanctum"" we don't really care about the characters.The screenplay by John Garvin and Andrew Wright is said to be based on the Andrew Wright's real-life experience. It is a terrifying story being trapped inside a flooded cave, but here the story is told in an ineffective way. Some scenes are rather good, I admit. The deluge of water itself is scary to look at, and so are the claustrophobic spaces. It takes cinematic narrative skills, however, to generate tension and suspense, which the director seems to forget to use.In short, with decent dark cave and underwater shots, ""Sanctum"" attempts to be a gritty survival action movie, which it is not. It needs better storytelling. We don't need a strained father-son relationship. We don't need a Coleridge poem, either. We don't like watching characters constantly make stupid decisions.
