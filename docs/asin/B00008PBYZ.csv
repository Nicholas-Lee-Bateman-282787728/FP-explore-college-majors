746165,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00008PBYZ,Linda Linguvic,"[26, 36]","This 1999 film in Turkish, Italian and French seemed interesting.  It's set in 1908 during the fall of the Ottoman Empire and depicts one of the last harems.  It's also a story of intrigue and romance.  Some of it was quite interesting, especially the depictions of the daily life of the women.  The acting was good and the mood was set just right, the cinematography showing the opulence of the palace as well as its restrictions.Something was wrong with the screenplay however.  My guess is that too much was left on the cutting room floor. As per the cover of the DVD, it was supposed to last 1 hour and 45 minutes.  However, the disc I viewed was only about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It was hard to figure out exactly what was happening and the story didn't fit together at all. There were flashbacks and flash forwards held together by a tale told by a servant which seemed to foretell the future.  And the ending left a lot of questions unanswered.Therefore, although there were some parts of this film that were good, and it might have been better when it was playing in the theaters, I just cannot recommend this DVD.",3,Good setting and intrigue.
