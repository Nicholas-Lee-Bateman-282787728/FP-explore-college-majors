898374,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B000850GR4,Perry Celestino,"[43, 45]","Well I am very surprized, frankly, that no one has reviewed this superb musical experience yet, so I will!This DVD was released in May 2005 and is the first real taste of Robben Ford live since his excellent live set in Baden-Baden Germany in the 1990s as part of the ""Ohne Filter-Musik Pur"" series-and they are all great! In this Paris set in 2001 Robben has his best band yet- with a great drummer, super bassist (check his solo in ""Help the Poor"") and, for the first time, keyboards. I can't praise this performance enough. Robben exhibits his style masterfully, without a lot of show, and demonstrates how he has successfully combined Jazz (especially Jazz Sax) with Chicago Electric Blues.Ford started around the Bay Area in the 1960s and built up a large following with the ""Charles Ford Band"" (named for his Dad) during the end of the Blues Power revival of the 1ate 1960s. He got to play with Charlie Musselwhite and then Miles Davis which really extended his blues-jazz style and chops. I love the part in the interview (a great bonus feature!) where he said Miles liked him when he played his own stuff, his own way...not what Miles had originally thought he'd play.Well this DVD is well produced, has a good lenght and track selection and the sound is excellent, as you would expect from the Inaukstik people! The opening track ""Prison Of Love"" one of Fords strongest numbers is magnificent and sets the stage for the rest of the performance. It's a cool Jazz-Blues. The top selection of the DVD is ""Help The Poor"" from his most famous and acclaimed recording ""Talk To Your Daughter"". This version is great the the solos are as good as you'll ever hear from anyone! I always thought this and ""Born Under A Bad Sign"" were Ford's greatest songs ever! ""Chevrolet"" is a remake of a Donovan song ""Hey Gyp""(Ford is a master of re-doing old tunes, especially blues, in a new groove and extending them!) This song was done by the Animals as well in the late 1960s. It is great!""Start It Up"" is a Ford rock staple with his trusty 1960s telecaster, which he plays through most of this set-that's also unusual. His version of Mike McDonald's ""Nothing To Nobody"" is outstanding with its great jazz chord structure. The minor key blues offering ""Moonchild Blues"" is perhaps the second greatest tune on the DVD, it sounds very close to the Howlin' Wolf classic ""Who's Been Talking""! You just want to keep on playing it!I highly recommend this DVD. It is the best new Blues inspired DVD of 2005 and a great addition to anyone's collection. If you only get one Robben Ford DVD, this is it! Great product and interesting bonus interview.",5,"Robben Ford In Europe, Again!",1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,2631,"['Well', 'am', 'very', 'surprized', 'frankly', 'one', 'reviewed', 'superb', 'musical', 'experience', 'yet', 'will', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'May', '2005', 'first', 'real', 'taste', 'Robben', 'Ford', 'excellent', 'live', 'set', 'Baden-Baden', 'Germany', '1990s', 'part', 'Ohne', 'Filter-Musik', 'Pur', 'series-and', 'are', 'great', 'Paris', 'set', '2001', 'Robben', 'best', 'band', 'yet-', 'great', 'drummer', 'super', 'bassist', 'check', 'solo', 'Help', 'Poor', 'first', 'time', 'keyboards', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'performance', 'enough', 'Robben', 'style', 'masterfully', 'lot', 'show', 'how', 'successfully', 'combined', 'Jazz', 'especially', 'Jazz', 'Sax', 'Chicago', 'Electric', 'Blues.Ford', 'started', 'Bay', 'Area', '1960s', 'built', 'up', 'large', 'following', 'Charles', 'Ford', 'Band', 'named', 'Dad', 'end', 'Blues', 'Power', 'revival', '1ate', '1960s', 'got', 'play', 'Charlie', 'Musselwhite', 'then', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'really', 'extended', 'blues-jazz', 'style', 'chops', 'love', 'part', 'interview', 'great', 'bonus', 'feature', 'where', 'said', 'Miles', 'liked', 'when', 'played', 'own', 'stuff', 'own', 'way', 'not', 'what', 'Miles', 'had', 'originally', 'thought', ""'d"", 'play.Well', 'DVD', 'well', 'produced', 'good', 'lenght', 'track', 'selection', 'sound', 'excellent', 'would', 'expect', 'Inaukstik', 'people', 'opening', 'track', 'Prison', 'Love', 'one', 'Fords', 'strongest', 'numbers', 'magnificent', 'stage', 'rest', 'performance', 'cool', 'Jazz-Blues', 'top', 'selection', 'DVD', 'Help', 'Poor', 'most', 'famous', 'acclaimed', 'recording', 'Talk', 'Daughter', 'version', 'great', 'solos', 'are', 'as', 'good', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear', 'anyone', 'always', 'thought', 'Born', 'A', 'Bad', 'Sign', 'were', 'Ford', 'greatest', 'songs', 'ever', 'Chevrolet', 'remake', 'Donovan', 'song', 'Hey', 'Gyp', 'Ford', 'master', 're-doing', 'old', 'tunes', 'especially', 'blues', 'new', 'groove', 'extending', 'song', 'was', 'done', 'Animals', 'as', 'well', 'late', '1960s', 'great', 'Start', 'Up', 'Ford', 'rock', 'staple', 'trusty', '1960s', 'telecaster', 'most', 'set-that', 'also', 'unusual', 'version', 'Mike', 'McDonald', 'Nothing', 'Nobody', 'outstanding', 'great', 'jazz', 'chord', 'structure', 'minor', 'key', 'blues', 'offering', 'Moonchild', 'Blues', 'perhaps', 'second', 'greatest', 'tune', 'DVD', 'very', 'close', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'classic', 'Who', 'Been', 'Talking', 'just', 'want', 'keep', 'playing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'best', 'new', 'Blues', 'inspired', 'DVD', '2005', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'Robben', 'Ford', 'DVD', 'Great', 'product', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'interview']",N/A
898375,A1QJ8YEBGIKEM,B000850GR4,Philip Snyder,"[28, 30]","Finally someone's done it right and produced a stunning full length concert DVD of Robben Ford.  I have to say it's about time.  Clocking in at roughly one hour and 28 minutes, this set clearly illustrates why Robben is considered one of the best.  His style of blending the harmonic sophistication of jazz with the deep soul of the blues is put on gorgeous display throughout this entire disc.  Filmed on May 5, 2001 at the New Morning club in Paris, the set list is comprised of:1. Prison of Love2. Just Like It Is3. Nothing To Nobody4. Start It Up5. Moonchild Blues6. Help The Poor7. Chevrolet8. Tired Of Talkin'9. Indianola Blues10. Deaf, Dumb & Blind11. Lovin' Cup12. You Got Me Knockin'As we've come to expect, Robben's playing is stunning and effortless and his tone is both smooth and stinging.  For you guitar freaks out there who might care about such things, Robben plays a gorgeous flame topped Robben Ford Fender signature model for tracks 1, 2, 5, and 6.  The remainder of the show is played on his beloved cream colored '61 Tele (I'm no vintage expert but I think it's a '61).  Extras include a great 24 minute ""interview"" that basically amounts to Robben sitting in what looks like a hotel lounge discussing his musical journey from the very beginning.  After a fantastic anecdote about his time with Miles Davis (with a great Miles impersonation to boot!), the conversation ends with ""to be continued..."".  Does this mean that a second live disc is in the works??  Let's hope so!I have to say that this is a spectacular live DVD.  I got it when it first came out and it was literally played over and over for about three straight weeks.  If you're just discovering Robben Ford, this is a great and affordable introduction.  If you're a longtime fan, this is the DVD you've been waiting for.

898376,A2HI7ZDSJNRWAT,B000850GR4,stranger2himself,"[11, 13]","This is a wonderful recording of the great Robben Ford.  I have both this and the Ohne Filter Ford DVD's.  Both are good, but I like this one better.  The set list is better, it's less heavy- rock influenced, a better mixture of straight blues shuffles, classy R&B, and jazzy pieces with interesting chord changes.  Much better pacing.  I've never heard Robben with an organ player, he has a great one here, who also supplies excellent harmony vocals, a welcome addition. Excellent, swinging bass and drums from Jimmy Earl and Brannen Temple.  Compared to the Ohne Filter DVD there seems to be more structure in the songs, seems more rehearsed, intro's, endings, tempo & mood changes.  I love the fact that Robben plays most of this one on his Telecaster, as I much prefer its sound -- more organic, less processed. There's really no one else like him that I'm aware of now.  Larry Carlton and Mike Stern come to mind, but Larry seems more reserved, pop-oriented maybe.  Stern is certainly a heavy fusion monster.  Neither of them would seem just right to play alongside Otis Rush, T-Bone Walker, or to backup Jimmy Witherspoon or Charlie Musselwhite, all of which Robben has done perfectly.  So, for me, he's the best modern BLUES player -- he knows, and uses, so much more than the pentatonic minor blues scale.  He has all the grease, or ""chitlins & gravy"" as Ron Eschete once called it, of players like Otis Rush and Buddy Guy, but blends that beautifully with an educated knowledge of harmony and chord substitutions, without becoming too much of a rock shredder.  It's a great balance.  If you like true blues and R&B, but need a little more chromaticism and melodic variety than your average Clapton-pentatonic-minor, he's the one.",5,Great Concert,1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,1738,"['wonderful', 'recording', 'great', 'Robben', 'Ford', 'have', 'Ohne', 'Filter', 'Ford', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'like', 'one', 'better', 'set', 'list', 'better', 'less', 'heavy-', 'rock', 'influenced', 'better', 'mixture', 'straight', 'blues', 'shuffles', 'classy', 'R', 'B', 'jazzy', 'pieces', 'interesting', 'chord', 'changes', 'Much', 'better', 'pacing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Robben', 'organ', 'player', 'great', 'one', 'here', 'who', 'also', 'excellent', 'harmony', 'vocals', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Excellent', 'swinging', 'bass', 'drums', 'Jimmy', 'Earl', 'Brannen', 'Temple', 'Compared', 'Ohne', 'Filter', 'DVD', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'structure', 'songs', 'more', 'rehearsed', 'intro', 'endings', 'tempo', 'mood', 'changes', 'love', 'fact', 'Robben', 'most', 'one', 'Telecaster', 'much', 'prefer', 'sound', 'more', 'organic', 'less', 'processed', 'really', 'one', 'else', ""'m"", 'aware', 'now', 'Larry', 'Carlton', 'Mike', 'Stern', 'come', 'mind', 'Larry', 'more', 'reserved', 'pop-oriented', 'maybe', 'Stern', 'certainly', 'heavy', 'fusion', 'monster', 'would', 'seem', 'just', 'right', 'play', 'alongside', 'Otis', 'Rush', 'T-Bone', 'Walker', 'backup', 'Jimmy', 'Witherspoon', 'Charlie', 'Musselwhite', 'Robben', 'done', 'perfectly', 'So', 'best', 'modern', 'BLUES', 'player', 'uses', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'pentatonic', 'minor', 'blues', 'scale', 'grease', 'chitlins', 'gravy', 'Ron', 'Eschete', 'once', 'called', 'players', 'Otis', 'Rush', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'beautifully', 'educated', 'knowledge', 'harmony', 'chord', 'substitutions', 'becoming', 'too', 'much', 'rock', 'shredder', 'great', 'balance', 'like', 'true', 'blues', 'R', 'B', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'chromaticism', 'melodic', 'variety', 'average', 'Clapton-pentatonic-minor', 'one']",N/A
