It is not too boring and too exciting. You can clearly see very bad special effects, but the acting was all right. To B-movie junkies this can be an all right to watch movie, however I can't say how many people would give this movie a second try. To me the movie was all right, as I already knew what to expect of it. This movie offered something new, giants, and even though it was badly made and the CGI sucked none the less, it was okay. I've seen worse movies. Hard to say whether you should give it a try or not. If you expect a very good B-movie, it's not one of them. This is more of a B- or a C/C- movie. Maybe if special effects were better, then the movie could be much better. The nude scene was nothing more than pathetic. Actors were all right, but I didn't care about any of them and neither did I care if the giant would eat their heads or step on them or kill them in any other ways. The sounds of gun shots and gun reloads was clearly stolen from other movies. ''...and then the ugly killer grew  bigger and bigger and bigger ''- but could you tell the watchers, how or why did he grow? No, apparently not. What I found really sad in the movie is when the animal got shot and the giant met his demise. There is gore in the movie and plenty of it, but it's cheaper than cheap. Just like those breasts you'll see.. ewww. It's not just breasts, the whole body was 'eewww'. The story is not surprising in any way and different parts of the whole plot was taken from different sources and then put together. Nothing surprising in this movie.

1641797,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00C57W9GY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Anyone that watches a SyFy Channel original movie on occasion knows that they rarely offer real chills. That doesn't mean that some of the films don't have a demented sort of charm. Grade A cheese, the best of the bunch tend to be hysterically unapologetic creature feature schlock. And who doesn't love bad B-movie mayhem? I certainly do and there aren't enough genetically mutated monsters to satisfy my cravings. However, sometimes there are movies that fail to accomplish even ""dumb fun"" and these can be painfully uninteresting. Unfortunately ""Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyon"" falls into this category. Late in the movie, a story is recounted that shows why Bunyon turned into a crazed axe wielding maniac. That scene is so supremely silly and terrific, it just demonstrated how mundane the rest of the movie was. Let's just say that I'll never think of Babe the Blue Ox in quite the same way. But this demented 5 star scene can't save the lack of creativity in the rest of the film.The movie starts with a glimpse of this back story, but soon moves quickly to the present. A troop of at-risk teenagers is taking an excursion into the woods with a surly Sergeant (Thomas Downey) and a sensitive social worker (Kristina Kopf). As a sort of wilderness reform therapy, each of the law breaking delinquents will be pushed to extremes by the stern taskmaster. Of course, the kids are rather generic character types instead of interesting people. Among them is an incredibly bland good girl who got a bad rap, so you have a good idea of who might survive (I would warn you about a possible spoiler alert, but don't bland good girls generally survive?). When the group finds a mysterious death alter, it opens a Pandora's box of horrors with a murderous giant tracking them down. They meet Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's overacting, more craggy brother) who clues them in on the legend. Cue great back story, brief glimpse of Grizzly Adams, repetitive killings, and on to the blood soaked conclusion.I've seen a lot of terrible CGI work in my pursuit of Bad Movie Magic, but this surely takes the case! So incredibly awful and laughable, I'm inclined to up my rating just to encourage you to see it for yourself. My primary problem with ""Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyon"" was not really how bad it was, I simply didn't have much fun. The characters were so boring and interchangeable. Jesse Kove (as the Lothario) and Jill Evyn (as the bad girl) show signs of life, but are left dry by the unimaginative screenplay. Estevez is wacky, if a tad tedious. Only Thomas Downey seems to get he's in a bad movie with a stunning performance right out of Reno 911. I loved it. The characters we're supposed to care about are horribly generic and uninteresting and the big finale leaves much to be desired. 1 1/2 stars. I'll round up based on the one scene that was great fun and for Downey.
