I definitely can't watch it with my young kids in the room, because even with the sometimes hard-to-decipher accents, it's clearly quite low-brow.But you really care about these characters in lots of ways.  What is hilarious is I grew up a middle-class girl in Texas and my husband grew up in Philadelphia...and yet we both saw lots in these stories that reminded us of those awkward years.If you were never the most popular in school and just loved to laugh, give this a try.

1389294,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B0048QP8N6,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[2, 8]","About 50% of us will identify with the trials and tribulations of teenage schoolboys - the desperate need to get lashed, the desperate need to look cool in front of your mates, the desperate need to avoid having the crap beaten out of you by the school bully, the desperate need to get into Emma Williamson's knickers (or at least a hand up her shirt) and so-on. In fact, school, for a boy of between about 15 and 18 is pretty desperate all 'round.Jay, Simon, Neil and Will are four such boys, and the 18 episodes mined the comedy gold of their travails on E4 between 2008 and 2010. Now, before you go much further, do beware that this is probably aimed at the twentysomething/thirtysomething viewer and it is very much adult viewing: the language and sexual references take care of that, I can tell you. The four lads are fairly stock teens, a dim one, a ladies' man, a boaster and a geeky one and the format/theme is pretty much as per my opening paragraph.The humour is bawdy and scatalogical, the language is shocking and the show won a number of awards. So does it work?Well... sort of. The first series is great and I wouldn't hesitate to give it four or even five stars. There are a number of scenes that had me literally crying with laughter, the humour is nicely sustained  throughout and there's a fairly decent nostalgia schtick (even for a guy who went through sixth form some 30 years back). The characters are fresh and straight out of Grange Hill and the acting (the lads are all played by young adult actors) is good. Admittedly the characters are all parodies, but that of course is the best way to look back at your youth. I particularly enjoyed the teacher Mr Gilbert (one of only two teachers with speaking parts) who is dripping sarcasm and child-hatred personified. I never had a teacher like him, but I can IMAGINE having had one. Indeed, if I ever went into the profession, Mr Gilbert is the man I would model myself on.The problem comes in the two subsequent series when it becomes clear that the idea had a pretty short shelf-life. Instead of exploring new and developing scenarios, laying down fresh ideas and introducing new characters, the writers clearly got lazy and decided that, because S1 worked, S2 and S3 should be more of the same but writ larger. Thus, the characters are the same but more so: the boasty one is boastier, the nerdy one is nerdier, the dimmer one is virtually brain-damaged and the lady's man is (and pardon me for this) more completely c**t-struck than ever. The toilet humour is wetter, the drunken behaviour is more inebriated and the ridiculous scrapes are more contrived. That would be fine if the actual humour of the first series had been at least sustained but it is not. Over the subsequent two series it becomes progressively rarified to the point that the last few episodes are toe curlingly unfunny and the humour is akin to spray-painting ""F##k the Pope!"" on a church wall. I say ""progressively"" - S2 is better than S3 but not as good as S1 and there are certainly SOME good laughs to be had, but that doesn't add up to a good enough reason to fork out for all three.S1 ****1/2S2 ***S3 **",3,6/10 Could do better.

1389296,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0048QP8N6,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 3]","It wasn't but two or three decades back that the late John Hughes made being a teen cool again.  Especially for girls.  No offense to any of the fans of his movies, but Hughes always played more in the girls' wholesome sandbox than he ever did the boys.  Granted, boys were always present - in much the same way a young Anthony Michael Hall sought after and showed a girl's underwear in exchange for a dollar bill - but they were never front and center.  Molly Ringwald was.  A few years back, the film SUPERBAD kinda/sorta did for teenage boys what PRETTY IN PINK and SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL did long before for girls - with some modest thematic differences - and thank goodness the British import THE INBETWEENERS explores similar territory.After all, what's it truly like to be a teenager boy?  No longer a child but not yet a man, the `inbetweener' is constantly barraged with peer pressure in ways too numerous to recount.  From beers to girls - from driving to drinking - a young man's life is little more than an assortment of one misadventure to the next.  He doesn't wanna disappoint his girl, but he can't live with alienating his `mates,' either.  THE INBETWEENER mines the inescapable embarrassment of being a teen in modern times.  Even when that means having the hots for your best friend's mother!Will McKenzie (played by Simon Bird) is enduring a tween-life crisis.  His mother (the comely Belinda Stewart-Wilson) is divorcing his dad, and the loss of household income forces her to put Will in public school.  The transition from jacket-and-tie existence to less formal uniforms is the least of his worries when he befriends lovable dufus Simon (Joe Thomas), the always clueless Neil (Blake Harrison), and borderline sex pervert Jay (James Buckley).  Together, they'll wreck havoc all over town, even when they don't intend it, and they'll brave the tail end of their adolescent years with the hearts on their sleeves, the smell of beer on their breath, and the dreams of their next shagging in their minds!Put aside your understandable prudishness and fully embrace what it was like to be a raving `tween' again.  I've no doubt that you had friends like Will, Simon, Neil, and Jay in ""the best years of your life,"" and maybe you still do today, though I'll hope (if you won't) that they've matured somewhat.  Yes, there are some borderline offensive jokes, and, yes, there are a few subject matters (like pedophilia, for example) that are treated with kid gloves a bit too much ... but there's still an awful lot of innocuous charm wrapped up in what it meant to make it through the era of raging hormones, acne, your first beer, your first kiss, your first club, your first fight, and making out beneath the bleachers.THE INBETWEENERS: THE COMPLETE SERIES was produced by Bwark Productions and Young Films.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Foundry Communications and EntertainmentOne.  It all looks and sounds solid, and - for those of you like me who sometimes struggle with British accents - there's even an English-subtitling track.  Each season includes six episodes (three discs total), and each disc includes a solid handful of special features including deleted scenes, outtakes (not all that funny, but there are a few clever moments), video diaries, behind-the-scenes specials, and audio commentaries.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  As is the nature of bawdy comedies, THE INBETWEENERS certainly isn't for everyone.  I will say that it wasn't as raunchy as it could've been, and I'm comfy admitting that not all of the territory covered was all that hilarious.  Still, the program approached so much of the boys' misadventures with a sense of benign harmlessness that I found it easy to won over by the charm and commitment of the four leads.  Plus, there's a major motion picture that made a bucket of money from the British box office, so if you're looking for a solid primer before catching it theatrically in the U.S. , you might be well served.  At times offensive but more often delightful, THE INBETWEENERS deserves to be discovered, at least, by like-minded male nitwits the world wide over.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at Foundry Communcations and EntertainmentOne provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE INBETWEENERS: THE COMPLETE SERIES by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,Discover What It Was Like To Be 'In Between' Again,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,4394,"['was', ""n't"", 'two', 'three', 'decades', 'back', 'late', 'John', 'Hughes', 'made', 'being', 'teen', 'cool', 'again', 'Especially', 'girls', 'offense', 'fans', 'movies', 'Hughes', 'always', 'played', 'more', 'girls', 'wholesome', 'sandbox', 'ever', 'did', 'boys', 'Granted', 'boys', 'were', 'always', 'present', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'young', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'sought', 'showed', 'girl', 'underwear', 'exchange', 'dollar', 'bill', 'were', 'never', 'front', 'center', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'was', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'film', 'SUPERBAD', 'kinda/sorta', 'did', 'teenage', 'what', 'PRETTY', 'IN', 'PINK', 'SOME', 'KIND', 'OF', 'WONDERFUL', 'did', 'long', 'before', 'girls', 'modest', 'thematic', 'differences', 'thank', 'goodness', 'British', 'import', 'THE', 'INBETWEENERS', 'similar', 'territory.After', 'what', 'truly', 'be', 'teenager', 'boy', 'No', 'longer', 'child', 'not', 'yet', 'man', 'inbetweener', 'constantly', 'barraged', 'peer', 'pressure', 'ways', 'too', 'numerous', 'recount', 'beers', 'girls', 'driving', 'drinking', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'little', 'more', 'assortment', 'one', 'misadventure', 'next', ""n't"", 'wan', 'disappoint', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'alienating', 'mates', 'INBETWEENER', 'inescapable', 'embarrassment', 'being', 'teen', 'modern', 'times', 'Even', 'when', 'having', 'hots', 'best', 'friend', 'mother', 'Will', 'McKenzie', 'played', 'Simon', 'Bird', 'enduring', 'tween-life', 'crisis', 'mother', 'comely', 'Belinda', 'Stewart-Wilson', 'divorcing', 'dad', 'loss', 'household', 'income', 'forces', 'put', 'Will', 'public', 'school', 'transition', 'jacket-and-tie', 'existence', 'less', 'formal', 'uniforms', 'least', 'worries', 'when', 'lovable', 'dufus', 'Simon', 'Joe', 'Thomas', 'always', 'clueless', 'Neil', 'Blake', 'Harrison', 'borderline', 'sex', 'pervert', 'Jay', 'James', 'Buckley', 'Together', ""'ll"", 'wreck', 'havoc', 'town', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', ""'ll"", 'brave', 'tail', 'end', 'adolescent', 'years', 'hearts', 'sleeves', 'smell', 'beer', 'breath', 'dreams', 'next', 'shagging', 'minds', 'Put', 'aside', 'understandable', 'prudishness', 'fully', 'embrace', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'raving', 'tween', 'again', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'had', 'friends', 'Will', 'Simon', 'Neil', 'Jay', 'best', 'years', 'life', 'maybe', 'still', 'do', 'today', ""'ll"", 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'matured', 'somewhat', 'Yes', 'are', 'borderline', 'offensive', 'jokes', 'yes', 'are', 'few', 'subject', 'matters', 'pedophilia', 'example', 'are', 'treated', 'kid', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'awful', 'lot', 'innocuous', 'charm', 'wrapped', 'up', 'what', 'meant', 'make', 'era', 'raging', 'hormones', 'acne', 'first', 'beer', 'first', 'kiss', 'first', 'club', 'first', 'fight', 'making', 'out', 'bleachers.THE', 'INBETWEENERS', 'COMPLETE', 'SERIES', 'was', 'produced', 'Bwark', 'Productions', 'Young', 'Films', 'DVD', 'distribution', 'stateside', 'being', 'handled', 'Foundry', 'Communications', 'EntertainmentOne', 'looks', 'solid', 'who', 'sometimes', 'struggle', 'British', 'accents', 'even', 'English-subtitling', 'track', 'season', 'six', 'episodes', 'three', 'total', 'disc', 'solid', 'handful', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'not', 'funny', 'are', 'few', 'clever', 'moments', 'video', 'diaries', 'behind-the-scenes', 'specials', 'audio', 'commentaries.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'As', 'nature', 'bawdy', 'comedies', 'THE', 'INBETWEENERS', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'will', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'raunchy', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', ""'m"", 'comfy', 'admitting', 'not', 'territory', 'covered', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Still', 'program', 'approached', 'so', 'much', 'boys', 'misadventures', 'sense', 'benign', 'harmlessness', 'found', 'easy', 'won', 'over', 'charm', 'commitment', 'four', 'leads', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'made', 'bucket', 'money', 'British', 'box', 'office', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'primer', 'catching', 'theatrically', 'U.S.', 'might', 'be', 'well', 'served', 'times', 'offensive', 'more', 'often', 'delightful', 'THE', 'INBETWEENERS', 'be', 'discovered', 'least', 'like-minded', 'male', 'world', 'wide', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'good', 'folks', 'Foundry', 'Communcations', 'EntertainmentOne', 'provided', 'DVD', 'screener', 'copy', 'THE', 'INBETWEENERS', 'COMPLETE', 'SERIES', 'request', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']","The Inbetweeners -

1389302,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0048QP8N6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[46, 46]","It's about time!  Of all the British sitcoms that I've watched through the years (and there have been more than I can count), I never understood why ""The Inbetweeners"" hadn't received more notoriety or even a proper DVD release for North American audiences.  Finally, I'm thrilled that Entertainment One is correcting this egregious oversight.  This program, in my opinion, has enormous cross-over appeal and is one of the better coming-of-age efforts that you're likely to encounter.  It miraculously manages to feel both truthful and absolutely absurd and that's not easy to do!  Featuring a quartet of prep school boys navigating the road to adulthood, the show plays to similar themes that we've seen countless times in other TV shows and movies.  But with sharp writing and a spot-on cast, these misadventures seem refreshingly original.  Bawdy and crude, the screenplays also succeed with smarts and wit.  That's why I really love this show.  It's quality entertainment masquerading as lowbrow humor, but it's more biting and daring and absolutely merciless than most conventional TV fare.The four friends at the center of ""The Inbetweeners"" aren't quite in the popular crowd, but they still aspire to make their mark.  To do so, however, they will face countless humiliations.  There is no plan that they can't derail, no situation that they can't make awkward.  By trying too hard to fit in, they stick out even further.  Just like real life.  Early episodes revolve around Will (the impeccable Simon Bird) as he transfers to a new school and ends up with an equally maladjusted trio played by James Buckley, Blake Harrison, and Joe Thomas.  Buckley life is filled with bravado and big stories as he constantly brags about sexual escapades that seem rather unlikely.  Harrison is the requisite dimwit, hilarious in his offbeat view of the world.  And Thomas spends much of his time pining for a girl who has been a lifelong friend.  When Bird enters the scene, he thinks he is above it all but soon becomes the target of bullies which pushes him into the new social circle.  You believe these four could be actual friends, and each actor perfectly embodies his role.The Complete Series consists of three seasons worth of episodes.  This being British TV, however, each season is only comprised of 6 episodes.  So here you are getting a total of 18 episodes at about 24 minutes each for a total package for over 7 hours.Season One: (1) The First Day, (2) Bunk Off, (3) Thorpe Park, (4) Girlfriend, (5) Caravan Club, and (6) Xmas Party.Season Two: (1) The Field Trip, (2) Work Experience, (3) Will's Birthday, (4) Night Out In London, (5) The Duke of Edinburgh Awards, and (6) Exam Time.Season Three: (1) The Fashion Show, (2) The Gig and The Girlfriend, (3) Will's Dilemma, (4) Trip to Warwick, (5) Will is Home Alone, and (6) Camping Trip.I truly love this show and give it the highest recommendation possible.  It was twice nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Comedy, Bird was nominated twice as Best Actor and Buckley picked up one nod.  Simon Bird, in fact, won two British Comedy Awards for this role and the show picked up that top prize for its 2010 season.  Hilarious and occasionally heartfelt, you'll identify with these boys more than you'll care to admit.  One of my favorites.

And the show doesn't necessarily do any one thing so much better or different than the rest; it simply does everything so well.The four boys are a splendid gang, each with their own distinct personalities and failings. The supporting cast of principal and parents are all great as well. Plus to an American, their filthy slang has an additional gleeful joy to hear their strange foreign words, akin to Guy Richie's old films like &#34;Snatch.&#34;Most importantly, the jokes are frequent and great. The humor ranges from offensively cruel verbal barbs, to goofy physical stunts, to sublimely absurd turns of circumstance. Perhaps the plotting is especially delightful, as every episode's shenanigans escalate in such a beautiful orgy of schadenfreude.Not for the easily offended of course, but this show was made for all fans of outrageous and provocative humor.",5,Greatest Teen Sex Comedy Ever,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,1322,"['34', 'Porky', '34', '34', 'Superbad', '34', 'genre', 'Teen', 'Sex', 'Comedy', 'had', 'many', 'entries', 'ranging', 'bad', 'classic', '34', 'Inbetweeners', '34', 'perfection.Just', 'decades', 'comedies', 'have', 'preceded', 'modern', 'British', 'masterpiece', 'show', 'same', 'genre', 'tropes', 'movies', 'adhere', 'crude', 'stupid', 'boys', 'failing', 'raunchy', 'humiliating', 'hijinks', 'pursuit', 'sex', 'show', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'different', 'rest', 'simply', 'everything', 'so', 'well.The', 'four', 'boys', 'are', 'splendid', 'gang', 'own', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'failings', 'supporting', 'cast', 'principal', 'parents', 'are', 'all', 'great', 'well', 'American', 'filthy', 'slang', 'additional', 'gleeful', 'joy', 'hear', 'strange', 'foreign', 'words', 'akin', 'Guy', 'Richie', 'old', 'films', '34', 'Snatch.', '34', 'Most', 'importantly', 'jokes', 'are', 'frequent', 'great', 'humor', 'offensively', 'cruel', 'verbal', 'barbs', 'goofy', 'physical', 'stunts', 'sublimely', 'absurd', 'turns', 'circumstance', 'Perhaps', 'plotting', 'especially', 'delightful', 'episode', 'shenanigans', 'escalate', 'beautiful', 'orgy', 'schadenfreude.Not', 'easily', 'offended', 'course', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'fans', 'outrageous', 'provocative', 'humor']","The Inbetweeners - Complete Series 1-3 - [DVD](REGION 2, UK VERSION)"

1389308,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B0048QP8N6,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[17, 17]","My fellow Amazon reviewer - K. Harris - has already posted a very detailed review of this DVD so I won't repeat much of what he has written (all of which I agree with) but, rather, add some more info that I think you will find helpful.""The inbetweeners"" ran on the commercial Channel Four network in the UK from 2008-2010 and, as K mentions - British TV series are only usually six or seven episodes per season. So this DVD package from eONE contains all three seasons.The series follows four boys in a ""comprehensive school"" in the UK. (Wikipedia defines ""comprehensive school"" as a state run school similar to high schools in the US. The four main characters are obviously ""under 18"" (as many lines in the script refer to that) but we're not sure what grade they are in since they seem about 17 in the first season and continue in class as the seasons progress.One thing to say for these guys is that their hormones are working overtime. They want to ""have at it"" with not only the young ""birds"" in school but - ready for this? - with their friends mothers. (If this fact shocks you, then this is probably not a series you will want to watch - honestly - but it's all done with a sense of raunchy humor. I found that a lot of the language and situations in the short 25-minute episodes - reminded me of the ""American Pie"" series of movies. And I at times it went even further. This may have been a TV series but it probably exceeds most US cable shows in the number of times the F-word and similar expletives are used. And there is nudity but most often bare male buttocks. And the ""toilet humor"" is not just a style of humor, but a lot of scenes seem to occur in a toilet. And there is virtually a ""bodily function"" joke at least once in every episode. Again, I'm just pointing this out for those who may not know what they are getting into.At the same time I was watching this DVD, I've been catching up on the US TV series (on broadcast TV) ""The Big Bang Theory"". Like ""The Inbetweeners"" it revolves around four friends (this time they are post college geniuses) and their attempts to meet women (including the ""hottie"" across the hall. Each of the four is distinct and in a few cases they parallel the four guys in ""The Inbetweeners"".This series seems to have a cult following and I must say that, once I knew what to expect, I had a lot of fun watching the series. It's definitely over the top but most guys can relate to similar experiences. (well some, anyway).The eOne set is LOADED with bonuses, though they are probably for the true fan more than the casual viewer. Each of the three discs has a separate ""making of"" or ""behind the scenes"" featurette, plus a ""video diary"" created by the cast. There are deleted scenes and outtakes (these last items under a minute each) and more.So, check your inhibitions as to language and check out the guys in this DVD. It really is a lot of fun.By the way, the series was followed by a ""feature film"" about the quartet's post school years, which as not yet been released on DVD in the US. Since the ""trailer"" is the first thing you see on this set, and the DVD has an insert saying the film will be ""in Theaters September 2012"", I guessing that eOne will release it on DVD by the end of the year.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"As raunchy as the ""American Pie"" films, this British TV series about 4 high school buds with overactive hormones is lots of fun.",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3338,"['fellow', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'K.', 'Harris', 'already', 'posted', 'very', 'detailed', 'review', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'much', 'what', 'written', 'agree', 'rather', 'add', 'more', 'info', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'helpful', 'inbetweeners', 'ran', 'commercial', 'Channel', 'Four', 'network', 'UK', '2008-2010', 'K', 'mentions', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'only', 'usually', 'six', 'seven', 'episodes', 'season', 'So', 'DVD', 'package', 'eONE', 'three', 'seasons.The', 'series', 'four', 'boys', 'comprehensive', 'school', 'UK', 'Wikipedia', 'comprehensive', 'school', 'state', 'run', 'school', 'similar', 'high', 'schools', 'US', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'obviously', '18', 'many', 'lines', 'script', 'refer', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'grade', 'are', 'seem', '17', 'first', 'season', 'continue', 'class', 'seasons', 'progress.One', 'thing', 'say', 'guys', 'hormones', 'are', 'working', 'overtime', 'want', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'birds', 'school', 'ready', 'friends', 'mothers', 'fact', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'series', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'honestly', 'done', 'sense', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'found', 'lot', 'language', 'situations', 'short', '25-minute', 'episodes', 'reminded', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'movies', 'times', 'went', 'even', 'further', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'series', 'probably', 'most', 'US', 'cable', 'shows', 'number', 'times', 'F-word', 'similar', 'expletives', 'are', 'used', 'nudity', 'most', 'often', 'bare', 'male', 'buttocks', 'toilet', 'humor', 'not', 'just', 'style', 'humor', 'lot', 'scenes', 'seem', 'occur', 'toilet', 'virtually', 'bodily', 'function', 'joke', 'least', 'once', 'episode', 'Again', ""'m"", 'just', 'pointing', 'out', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'been', 'catching', 'up', 'US', 'TV', 'series', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'Inbetweeners', 'four', 'friends', 'time', 'are', 'post', 'college', 'geniuses', 'attempts', 'meet', 'women', 'including', 'hottie', 'hall', 'four', 'distinct', 'few', 'cases', 'parallel', 'four', 'guys', 'Inbetweeners', '.This', 'series', 'have', 'cult', 'following', 'must', 'say', 'once', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'series', 'definitely', 'top', 'most', 'guys', 'can', 'relate', 'similar', 'experiences', 'well', 'anyway', '.The', 'eOne', 'set', 'LOADED', 'bonuses', 'are', 'probably', 'true', 'fan', 'more', 'casual', 'viewer', 'three', 'discs', 'separate', 'making', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'video', 'diary', 'created', 'cast', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'last', 'items', 'minute', 'check', 'inhibitions', 'language', 'check', 'out', 'guys', 'DVD', 'really', 'lot', 'fun.By', 'way', 'series', 'was', 'followed', 'feature', 'film', 'quartet', 'post', 'school', 'years', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'US', 'trailer', 'first', 'thing', 'see', 'set', 'DVD', 'insert', 'saying', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'Theaters', 'September', '2012', 'guessing', 'eOne', 'will', 'release', 'DVD', 'end', 'year.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']","The Inbetweeners - Complete Series 1-3 - [DVD](REGION 2, UK VERSION)"
