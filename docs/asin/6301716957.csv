Did he get a name change after doing this movie or did he change his career?The entertainer that he portrayed had the personality like a Male versionof Alice from the  Twilight saga(I thought) always wanted to share things like his way was the way to do it, and he would get all excited or he would be down in the dumps.I personally liked the entertainer that was portrayed of. and I thought Ira Did a good job doing the not so nice stuff that could of been done not so nice.Senor- Freddie Mmmm its kind of touchy to say, I liked him alot but, to talk about him well that still is kind of questionable?Deborah Fenn",3,archives,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,902,"['was', 'sad', 'story', 'i', 'thought', 'Entertainer', 'did', 'portrayal', 'original', 'person', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'unfortunate', 'entertainer', 'portrayed', 'original', 'person', 'got', 'bad', 'rap', 'doing', 'movie.I', 'sort', 'wonder', 'what', 'Ever', 'Happened', 'Ira', 'Angustain', 'Did', 'get', 'name', 'change', 'doing', 'movie', 'did', 'change', 'career', 'entertainer', 'portrayed', 'had', 'personality', 'Male', 'versionof', 'Alice', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'thought', 'always', 'wanted', 'share', 'things', 'way', 'was', 'way', 'do', 'would', 'get', 'excited', 'would', 'be', 'down', 'dumps.I', 'personally', 'liked', 'entertainer', 'was', 'portrayed', 'thought', 'Ira', 'Did', 'good', 'job', 'doing', 'not', 'so', 'nice', 'stuff', 'could', 'been', 'done', 'not', 'so', 'nice.Senor-', 'Freddie', 'Mmmm', 'kind', 'touchy', 'say', 'liked', 'alot', 'talk', 'well', 'still', 'kind', 'questionable', 'Deborah', 'Fenn']",Can You Hear the Laughter? - The Story of Freddie Prinze VHS

The film states it was based on articles, etc., so need I say more? They added things in that were untrue, which is disrespectful to Prinze.
