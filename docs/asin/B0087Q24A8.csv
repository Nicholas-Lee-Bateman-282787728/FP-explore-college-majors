1548181,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0087Q24A8,Compay,"[5, 5]","Coffin was shot on a shoestring budget of only $600,000. So in all fairness to the filmmakers, you can't expect a horror or thriller of the same quality as Scream or Jacob's Ladder. If you're a diehard fan of Kevin Sorbo, or horror movies in general, it's worth a watch. Otherwise, casual fans of psychological horror flicks may want to give this one a pass.Coffin is the story of a Jack Samms, a man who discovers that his wife and her lover are buried in a wooden box with less than 75 minutes to live. A mysterious stranger offers Jack the opportunity to save his wife, as streaming video shot from the ""coffin"" reveals what could be her final moments alive. As a duo of detectives gain clues into the disappearance of the missing wife and her lover, Jack must play ever card that he has in order to win the game of cat and mouse that he's been pulled into.Despite being shot on a ridiculously low budget, the creators of Coffin were able to cast Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly in X-Men), and Kevin Sorbo of ""Hercules"" fame. The rest of the cast is largely made up of actors that have worked on short films, straight to DVD movies, and the occasional TV show. In other words, the performances in Coffin won't be scoring any movie awards.The story itself isn't especially original. Coffin borrows elements from Saw 2, with an incredibly similar ""twist"" to the 2010 thriller ""Abandoned"" with Dean Cain and Brittany Murphy. So while the twist ending is somewhat predictable, Coffin at least throws one final curveball in the end that the audience won't see coming.  The film has its moments early on, but more than a few scenes just come off as filler.Coffin was written by Kipp Tribble, who also appears in the film as a seasoned detective who likes to play by his own rules.  Tribble shares a Director's credit with Derik Wingo, who also appears in Coffin as a junior Detective. Both have worked mostly as uncredited film extras during their respective careers.  So even though neither is a terrific actor, you have to cut them some slack, as they're relatively new to having as much dialogue as they did in Coffin.Monica Giselle and Moksha McPherrin appear in the film as not much more than eye candy, although I can't complain considering both are gorgeous women. Their inclusion in Coffin does follow a theme to the film's casting, though, which is that many of the actors were veterans in makeup, wardrobe, or special effects in other movies.DVD extras include behind the scenes plus interview featurettes, although the jump in sound levels for both was a bit annoying (seemed to be recorded with a basic handheld digital camera). The behind the scenes look does give plenty of insight as to how they shot the ""coffin"" scenes, and how demanding many of the filming days were.Audio options include a director's commentary by Kipp Tribble and Derik Wingo, though it's noticeable that they're videoconferencing from different cities as they record it. The commentary was interesting in that you learn a great deal about the locations used, their experiences with the different actors, and how brutal some of the 15 hour shoots were.If you love low-budget thrillers, are have a thing for Kevin Sorbo, Coffin is worth a rent online or through your local Redbox kiosk. From the interviews, I know that the two directors put a lot of time and energy into what had to be a low-budget movie, but I honestly wasn't impressed. You definitely want to give this one a rent before you consider buying the DVD.",2,About What You'd Expect for a Straight to DVD Thriller,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,3499,"['Coffin', 'was', 'shot', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'only', '600,000', 'So', 'fairness', 'filmmakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'horror', 'thriller', 'same', 'quality', 'Scream', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'horror', 'movies', 'general', 'watch', 'Otherwise', 'casual', 'fans', 'psychological', 'horror', 'flicks', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'pass.Coffin', 'story', 'Jack', 'Samms', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'lover', 'are', 'buried', 'wooden', 'box', 'less', '75', 'minutes', 'live', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'offers', 'Jack', 'opportunity', 'save', 'wife', 'streaming', 'video', 'shot', 'coffin', 'reveals', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'final', 'moments', 'alive', 'duo', 'detectives', 'gain', 'clues', 'disappearance', 'missing', 'wife', 'lover', 'Jack', 'must', 'play', 'ever', 'card', 'order', 'win', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'been', 'pulled', 'into.Despite', 'being', 'shot', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'budget', 'creators', 'Coffin', 'were', 'able', 'cast', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Senator', 'Kelly', 'X-Men', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Hercules', 'fame', 'rest', 'cast', 'largely', 'made', 'actors', 'have', 'worked', 'short', 'films', 'straight', 'DVD', 'movies', 'occasional', 'TV', 'show', 'other', 'words', 'performances', 'Coffin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'scoring', 'movie', 'awards.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'especially', 'original', 'Coffin', 'elements', 'Saw', '2', 'incredibly', 'similar', 'twist', '2010', 'thriller', 'Abandoned', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'So', 'twist', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'Coffin', 'least', 'throws', 'one', 'final', 'curveball', 'end', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'film', 'moments', 'early', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'filler.Coffin', 'was', 'written', 'Kipp', 'Tribble', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'seasoned', 'detective', 'who', 'play', 'own', 'rules', 'Tribble', 'shares', 'Director', 'credit', 'Derik', 'Wingo', 'who', 'also', 'Coffin', 'junior', 'Detective', 'have', 'worked', 'mostly', 'uncredited', 'film', 'extras', 'respective', 'careers', 'So', 'even', 'terrific', 'actor', 'have', 'cut', 'slack', ""'re"", 'relatively', 'new', 'having', 'as', 'much', 'dialogue', 'did', 'Coffin.Monica', 'Giselle', 'Moksha', 'McPherrin', 'appear', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'considering', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'inclusion', 'Coffin', 'follow', 'theme', 'film', 'casting', 'many', 'actors', 'were', 'veterans', 'makeup', 'wardrobe', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'movies.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'scenes', 'interview', 'featurettes', 'jump', 'sound', 'levels', 'was', 'bit', 'annoying', 'seemed', 'be', 'recorded', 'basic', 'handheld', 'digital', 'camera', 'scenes', 'look', 'give', 'plenty', 'insight', 'how', 'shot', 'coffin', 'scenes', 'how', 'demanding', 'many', 'filming', 'days', 'were.Audio', 'options', 'include', 'director', 'commentary', 'Kipp', 'Tribble', 'Derik', 'Wingo', 'noticeable', ""'re"", 'videoconferencing', 'different', 'cities', 'record', 'commentary', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'locations', 'used', 'experiences', 'different', 'actors', 'how', 'brutal', '15', 'hour', 'shoots', 'were.If', 'love', 'low-budget', 'thrillers', 'are', 'have', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Coffin', 'rent', 'online', 'local', 'Redbox', 'kiosk', 'interviews', 'know', 'two', 'directors', 'put', 'lot', 'time', 'energy', 'what', 'had', 'be', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'definitely', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'rent', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A

1548185,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0087Q24A8,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","A 2011 thriller ""Coffin"" begins pretty in the same way as a Ryan Reynolds' ""Buried,"" in which a man finds himself trapped in a box buried under the ground. In ""Coffin"" a man and a woman (Kevin Sorbo and Sunny Doench) are buried alive together in a coffin, and they have only 75 minutes before they die by suffocation. How original, you might say. The good news is that the film's story offers something more. The bad news is, what it offers is poorly executed and just boring.Anyway, the buried woman is the wife of Jack Samms (Patrick Barnitt), who learns his estranged wife's predicament from a masked stranger ""Trick."" Showing the monitored image of the inside of the coffin, Trick demands Jack pay money for their safe return. Otherwise, Jack might be involved in trouble. Oh, I almost forgot to say that the buried man is the lover of Jack's wife. You will also see Bruce Davison in a brief but pivotal role.""Coffin"" has two major problems: lack of originality, and bland direction. They could have named the masked villain ""Jigsaw."" The difference is that the mastermind of the ""Saw"" franchise is more interesting and charismatic. The character of ""Trick"" (or whoever it is) is nothing intriguing, and neither are Trick's criminal techniques, which I think are predictable to some. What is worse, the film is simply dull. The film's pace is too slow; characters speak too much; the screenplays needs creative ideas; and most of all, the film feels like going on and on, not knowing how to build up tension.As you know, the terror of being ""buried alive"" is one of the popular themes found in thriller. Running against the clock is also one popular theme of the genre. ""Coffin"" has both of them, and fails to make use of them effectively.",2,So Slow-Moving and Boring,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,1743,"['2011', 'thriller', 'Coffin', 'pretty', 'same', 'way', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Buried', 'man', 'trapped', 'box', 'buried', 'ground', 'Coffin', 'man', 'woman', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Sunny', 'Doench', 'are', 'buried', 'alive', 'together', 'coffin', 'have', 'only', '75', 'minutes', 'die', 'suffocation', 'How', 'original', 'might', 'say', 'good', 'news', 'film', 'story', 'something', 'more', 'bad', 'news', 'what', 'poorly', 'executed', 'just', 'boring.Anyway', 'buried', 'woman', 'wife', 'Jack', 'Samms', 'Patrick', 'Barnitt', 'who', 'estranged', 'wife', 'predicament', 'masked', 'stranger', 'Trick', 'Showing', 'monitored', 'image', 'inside', 'coffin', 'Trick', 'Jack', 'pay', 'money', 'safe', 'return', 'Otherwise', 'Jack', 'might', 'be', 'involved', 'trouble', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'say', 'buried', 'man', 'lover', 'Jack', 'wife', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'brief', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Coffin', 'two', 'major', 'problems', 'lack', 'originality', 'bland', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'named', 'masked', 'villain', 'Jigsaw', 'difference', 'mastermind', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'more', 'interesting', 'charismatic', 'character', 'Trick', 'whoever', 'nothing', 'intriguing', 'are', 'Trick', 'criminal', 'techniques', 'think', 'are', 'predictable', 'What', 'worse', 'film', 'simply', 'dull', 'film', 'pace', 'too', 'slow', 'characters', 'speak', 'too', 'much', 'screenplays', 'creative', 'ideas', 'most', 'film', 'feels', 'going', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'build', 'up', 'tension.As', 'know', 'terror', 'being', 'buried', 'alive', 'one', 'popular', 'themes', 'found', 'thriller', 'Running', 'clock', 'also', 'one', 'popular', 'theme', 'genre', 'Coffin', 'make', 'use', 'effectively']",N/A
