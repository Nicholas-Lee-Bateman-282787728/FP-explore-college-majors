772146,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B0000C237Y,"ANT ""azraelart""","[5, 5]","For those of you that enjoy Lewis Black, you should definitely enjoy this DVD.  If you are unsure of whether or not you like him, the price is definitely worth taking the chance.  You will get almost 2 hours worth of very funny sketches and supporting material from one of America's funniest 'angry' comics.It is a collection of three of his shows on Comedy Central, but they are only 30 minute segments.  The extras are pretty nice, though, with his complete coverage of Indecision 2000 for the Daily Show.  It also includes two 'Shorties,' namely a segment from Colin Quinn's and a song by Stephen Lynch.  Quinn's show was not as funny as I would have hoped, but Lynch's song is outrageously humorous (even though I had heard it before).A brief warning for those who do not know.  Lewis Black can sometimes use coarse language and while his main sketches are 99.99% devoid of such words, on the extras and in a few other locations, a word does slip out.  Just a precaution in case you have kids or do not prefer swearing yourself.  If you don't mind and know what you are getting into, you'll absolutely love this DVD, save that it perhaps could have been longer.",4,Great compilation,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,1165,"['enjoy', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'should', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'are', 'unsure', 'not', 'price', 'definitely', 'worth', 'taking', 'chance', 'will', 'get', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'worth', 'very', 'funny', 'sketches', 'supporting', 'material', 'one', 'America', 'funniest', ""'angry"", 'comics.It', 'collection', 'three', 'shows', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'are', 'only', '30', 'minute', 'segments', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'though', 'complete', 'coverage', 'Indecision', '2000', 'Daily', 'Show', 'also', 'two', ""'Shorties"", 'namely', 'segment', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'song', 'Stephen', 'Lynch', 'Quinn', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'Lynch', 'song', 'outrageously', 'humorous', 'even', 'had', 'heard', '.A', 'brief', 'warning', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'can', 'sometimes', 'use', 'coarse', 'language', 'main', 'sketches', 'are', '99.99', '%', 'devoid', 'such', 'words', 'extras', 'few', 'other', 'locations', 'word', 'slip', 'out', 'Just', 'precaution', 'case', 'have', 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'prefer', 'swearing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', ""'ll"", 'absolutely', 'love', 'DVD', 'save', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer']",N/A

I finally got a chance to see one of his specials on Comedy Central and was laughing hysterically.  This guy is extremely full of anger and energy, and knows how to take no prisoners.  &quot;Lewis Black Unleashed&quot; is a fine introduction for those who aren't yet familiar with his stand-up.The DVD contains four half-hour specials that broadcasted on Comedy Central (one of them being called, &quot;Taxed Beyond Belief&quot;).  He's a very topical comedian that doesn't do the &quot;usual&quot; stand-up gig.  He talks about politics, the state of the country, scandals, idiotic people and much more.  Once he gets going on a rant, he never stops.  And the great thing about this guy is that he attacks EVERYONE.  This isn't a democratic comedian who only attacks the Republicans; nor is he a Republican who attacks only Democrats.  He attacks ALL OF THEM--regardless of who's in which party.Lewis Black reminds me a lot of the late Bill Hicks (and that's a good thing).  He definitely has a &quot;Hicks&quot; influence in him--not saying that his delivery isn't original.  On the contrary, he has a certain style that works for him and would not work for anybody else.  He's always on target and never misses a beat when it comes to delivering the goods.Aside from the four half-hour features, the DVD also includes Black's commentary on the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention.  While there's not a lot of extras, that's to be expected with a DVD like this.  It's a lot more impressive than most.  Hopefully he will come out with a full hour special that's uncensored sometime in the near future.&quot;Lewis Black Unleashed&quot; does a superb job of showcasing this very funny comedian's talents.  He's mad, he's bitter--and he's downright hilarious!  If you've never seen him perform before, be sure to give this DVD a try.

And we can cherish his agitated opinions through this DVD packed full of comedy.With Unleashed, we are treated to three of his half-hour stand-up specials (including the two regularly shown specials of Comedy Central's Friday Night Stand Up), as well as ""Taxed Beyond Belief"", where he teaches a class of young-adult students about taxes (of course, in a completely comedic manner). Also here for your viewing pleasure are special features, including his Comedy Central segments for The Daily Show regarding the 2000 Republican and Democratic National Conventions.Still, regardless of his appearances on The Daily Show (which are indeed funny), his stand-up comedy is his greatest art and the best part of this DVD. One of the greatest apsects of Lewis Black's stand-up routines (besides the fact that they're non-stop hilarity) is that he makes fun of everyone and doesn't give you the impression he's taking sides. Focussing on his well-executed job of making us roll over in laughter, he knows exactly how to present his jokes -- even if the joke is less than perfect, he'll say it in a way that makes it perfect. He's got that timeless charisma about him. He's a real character!All in all, if you like people who make anger seem funny, and make serious political conversation seem pointless, then Lewis Black is your kind of man.

I saw him on Comedy Central for the first time about 2 years ago and was sold from segment #1. Lewis Black is unlike any other comic I've ever seen before or since. He steps out of the way of any categorization and serves as the agitated commentator on human stupidity.The DVD contains all 3 of his Comedy Central presents specials, as well as his &quot;Taxed Beyond Belief&quot; special. To be honest, I would have liked it if Comedy Central would have done his specials uncensored like they did with Dane Cook's DVD but at this juncture, I'll take Mr. Black any way I can. The first special is from 1998 is by far my favorite with his rants on the weather, the famous &quot;if it weren't for my horse...&quot; rant and the Clinton trials. His 2000 special is my least favorite of the three but still maintains enough of his biting social commentary to warrant several viewings. The 2002 special si a close second with his bits on the 9/11 tribute combined with the Super Bowl, Starbucks and patriotism. Through it all, he comes through as very intelligent, witty and surprisingly &quot;right on the money&quot; 99% of the time.I could honestly deal with a new release from Lewis Black once every 4 months but anything will do. Overall, you have got to hand it to Comedy Central: they have single-handedly given rebirth to the stand-up game and introduced the world to brilliant minds such as Lewis Black.
