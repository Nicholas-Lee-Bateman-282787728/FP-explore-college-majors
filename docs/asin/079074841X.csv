118556,A2GOAEF0ZRNG13,079074841X,Aaron,"[2, 2]","As with almost all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is a piece that is ahead of its time.  The reaction to this film is just what I had expected.  Time and time again, during the initial release of a new Kubrick film,  reaction is ALWAYS sharply divided.  The reviews are mainly negative and  the public does'nt seem to know what to make of the film.  Just go back and  look at the original reviews for &quot;2001&quot; when it first came out  back in 1968.  They're devestating.  Now the film continually makes many 10  best lists.  This goes for most of his films.  I think that the film will  stand the test of time (in fact some film critics who panned the film are  coming around already).  Today's moviegoing public just does'nt seem to  have the patience to stay with a film such as this.  Kubrick's multilayed  film requires one to &quot;think&quot; and work for its rewards.  There is  no question he intended to capture a dream state on film, hence the  unreality of the sets, the stylized lighting, the surreal masked ball, ect.  As with all Kubrick films, the atmosphere is tightly controlled, the  pacing deliberate and at times even langourous, the dialogue intentionally  repetitive, and the direction, so stylized and instantly recognizable that  there is no question who made this film.  The media had built up  expectations to the point of insane frenzy, no movie could have lived up to  that.  If you're expecting to see first class porn with A list stars and  very kinky hardcore sex scenes, you my friend are sadly mistaken and will  be disappointed.  But is you go in knowing this is a very surreal art film  you may like it.  Lastly, I feel the need to &quot;join in with the rest of  the chorus&quot;, I wish the unedited version would have been presented on  DVD. It's an absolute shameful decision on WB's part regardless of  &quot;Kubrick's final wishes&quot;.

118559,A34VV92TSLC37R,079074841X,Adam Craig,"[0, 1]","Eyes Wide Shut is a very disturbing, intense film.  Well, I should say the last hour and a half are that way.  The first hour of the film is really slow, and if it weren't Kubrick, I would say it's even pointless.  The problem is, at the end of the movie, I look back on the first hour and all the conversations that took place, and ultimately I think that they make the movie what it is.  A disturbing, contemplative look at the human sexual psyche.Dr. Bill Hartford (Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Kidman) are a seemingly happy married couple.  One night as they are smoking some pot, they get into a substantial argument about Bill's view of women, specifically Alice.  This argument leads Alice to reveal to her husband that she almost had (or would have had, given the opportunity) an affair the last time they were on vacation in Cape Cod.  This upsets Bill and ultimately it is this story of desire that sets Dr. Bill off on his journey.  Obviously, the most famous scene is the orgy where Bill ultimately finds himself late one night.  While the American version has been censored substantially, the scene still does not lose its effect.Rather than go more in-depth in the story, I would just recommend giving the film a chance if you haven't seen it yet.  Cruise and Kidman give great performances, and Sydney Pollack has a good role as a friend of the Hartfords'.  The film is Kubrick in so many ways.  It relies on dialogue, music, and atmosphere to create tension, and it does an amazing job.  If anything, just make yourself get through the first hour, because from there the film takes off and you won't want to leave until you find out what in the world is going on.It really is a shame that this was Kubrick's last movie.  It makes you wish that he had made movies more frequently throughout his career, rather than just one every 6 or 8 years.",4,"An good, sometimes great finale for Stanley Kubrick",1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,1858,"['Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'very', 'disturbing', 'intense', 'film', 'Well', 'should', 'say', 'last', 'hour', 'half', 'are', 'way', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'really', 'slow', 'were', ""n't"", 'Kubrick', 'would', 'say', 'even', 'pointless', 'problem', 'end', 'movie', 'look', 'back', 'first', 'hour', 'conversations', 'took', 'place', 'ultimately', 'think', 'make', 'movie', 'what', 'disturbing', 'contemplative', 'look', 'human', 'sexual', 'psyche.Dr', 'Bill', 'Hartford', 'Cruise', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Kidman', 'are', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'married', 'couple', 'One', 'night', 'are', 'smoking', 'pot', 'get', 'substantial', 'argument', 'Bill', 'view', 'women', 'specifically', 'Alice', 'argument', 'Alice', 'reveal', 'husband', 'almost', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'given', 'opportunity', 'affair', 'last', 'time', 'were', 'vacation', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'upsets', 'Bill', 'ultimately', 'story', 'desire', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'off', 'journey', 'Obviously', 'most', 'famous', 'scene', 'orgy', 'where', 'Bill', 'ultimately', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'American', 'version', 'been', 'censored', 'substantially', 'scene', 'still', 'not', 'lose', 'effect.Rather', 'go', 'more', 'in-depth', 'story', 'would', 'just', 'recommend', 'giving', 'film', 'chance', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'good', 'role', 'friend', 'Hartfords', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'dialogue', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'create', 'tension', 'amazing', 'job', 'anything', 'just', 'make', 'get', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'world', 'going', 'on.It', 'really', 'shame', 'was', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'made', 'movies', 'more', 'frequently', 'career', 'rather', 'just', 'one', '6', '8', 'years']",N/A

Was it worth the wait? Not really. Does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director? Unquestionably.As the plot of Eyes Wide Shut unfolds, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman struggle to attract the audience's attention. They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy.",4,a good film from a great man,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1868,"['attention', 'Definitely', 'Was', 'money', 'Absolutely', 'Was', 'effort', 'Certainly', 'Was', 'worth', 'two', 'years', 'Probably', 'Was', 'wait', 'Not', 'really', 'deserve', 'be', 'last', 'effort', 'great', 'late', 'director', 'plot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'unfolds', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'struggle', 'attract', 'audience', 'attention', 'attentively', 'invite', 'viewer', 'fantasy', 'world', 'dreams', 'might', 'be', 'reality', 'reality', 'one', 'single', 'night', 'long', 'unforgettable', 'dream.As', 'good', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'steal', 'show', 'scene', 'husband', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'given', 'up', 'everything', 'daughter', 'life', 'naval', 'officer', 'powerful', 'combo', 'performances', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Die', 'Broadway', 'play', 'Blue', 'Room', 'only', 'flawed', 'scene', 'Kidman', 'Alice', 'ex-gallery', 'manager', 'who', 'currently', 'unemployed', 'sequence', 'where', 'husband', 'had', 'terrible', 'nightmare', 'sobs', 'are', 'unemotional', 'scene', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'as', 'strong', 'rest', 'performance.The', 'famously', 'feared', 'orgy', 'scene', 'indeed', 'peculiar', 'viewer', 'attention', 'really', 'needed', 'scene', 'little', 'purpose', 'conveying', 'true', 'message', 'thin', 'line', 'imaginary', 'real', 'life', 'entire', 'scenery', 'rich', 'mansion', 'where', 'orgy', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'where', 'masked', 'men', 'pray', 'hookers', 'fantastic', 'regardless', 'controversy', 'necessity.Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'master', 'filmmaking', 'imaginary', 'twist', 'marriage', 'dreams', 'reality', 'life', 'once', 'viewer', 'theater', 'loss', 'words', 'thin', 'line', 'dream', 'world', 'reality', 'Such', 'effect', 'indeed', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'legacy']",N/A

I'll elaborate a bit below, but the long and short is - this is not a date movie, unless you want to spend the rest of the evening talking about the  film, and I guarantee any two people, regardless of gender or other  difference, will disagree about many things in the film.  Which is good,  IMHO. Okay - the skinny: 1. Acting - great in supporting cast, mediocre in  the leads (Cruise and Kidman).  Tom is trying hard to climb out of Jerry  McGuire.  Nicole is better, but overacts during her best scene. 2.  Production (cinematography, sets, everything but acting and plot) ROCK.  You could watch this film with the sound off and it would be great.  Revisit Kubrick master-touches from the past and see a few new ones.  Kubrick is rejoined by old friends the &quot;magic 70's zoom-cam&quot; and  the color Red. 3. Plot - if you're counting on dialog to do the trick, it  won't.  Like 2001, the dialog does little (okay, it does more here than in  2001, but still not much).  Kubrick is Kubrick because everything in the  film should talk to the viewer - your interpretations are AS IMPORTANT as  what Kubrick is showing you (Kubrick's view, not just mine).  Like 2001,  the magic happens when the viewer superimposes his or her self on what the  film gives. Think about what you are seeing and how you are seeing it.  Dialog helps, but don't let it distract you.  I saw it with my girlfriend.  I like Kubrick, she didn't know him.  It took us two days to figure out if  we liked it or not.  I liked it a lot - I put it in his top 5 for visual  style alone.  She hated hated hated it, but it took two days to get there.  Any film that makes one digest it for so long is worth seeing, and this one  is worth owning.  Note: photographers and amateur filmmakers, watch this  film. Repeat as necessary. Overall, a great film for those who don't mind a  little introspection / navel-contemplation or who want something to talk  about afterward.  A very bad film for &quot;background noise&quot; or a  frat party, despite the nudity. A final note - the hoopla about sex/nudity  is vapor.  There is nudity and sex, but it drives Kubrick's plot. I won't  discuss it further, but let's just say the treatment of gender/sex issues  in this film are similar to &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; in some ways.  Those who haven't seen ACO, don't worry about it. Eyes Wide Shut won't warp  your brain.

118576,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079074841X,Andrew Ellington,"[9, 11]","I make it a point to watch this movie at least once or twice a year; for it is one of those films that touches you differently each and every time you entertain it.  Once I feel that I have my mind made up it is completely trampled and my perception of events is altered as my mind tries to re-contemplate everything I just witnessed.  That is the beauty within `Eyes Wide Shut'; a film so tragically misunderstood that many have labeled it pointless and even trashy without fully comprehending all that the film really stands for.The film almost feels lost within itself as it shifts from scene to scene; moment to moment, and in the final thrusts of the films focus we see an explanation (or is it) starting to form before our eyes, but what is so beautiful about the films construction is that that particular explanation (or any explanation for that matter) is completely contradicted the next time we watch the film.  There are no easy answers to the questions raised while watching this masterpiece and that makes for some of the most intriguing titillating post-viewing conversation.  Kubrick's visual styling is incomparable and his approach to the rabid subject at hand; his frankness and blunt rashness; elevates the material and builds a pristine foundation for the films more startling sequences.The film opens with high society couple Bill and Alice attending a party.  Separated from one another we find Alice drinking her detachment away and dancing too close with a stranger while Bill weaves his way through the large mansion to make his services available to those in need, one such individual being his good friend Victor.  This scene perfectly mirrors the characters development and their emotional connection to one another and to us as the audience.  Both Alice and Bill are in a sense playing variations of themselves, locking away their true identities for the sake of those around them.  They are not necessarily faking it or posing as someone else but more or less playing up the parts of them that others want to notice.As the film progresses we witness Bill's emersion into a dark underworld that he is drawn to out of a perverse curiosity yet repelled from because of his desirable innocence.  As he filters through his own feelings with regards his marriage and his life he tickles the keys of his own tendencies and this leads to some startling discoveries; discoveries within himself and those around him.`Eyes Wide Shut' is unfairly recognized for its fearless depictions of immorality; sequences that have proven to be the backbone of ones distaste or admiration of the film.  I say unfairly because those scenes are a small instrument used by Kubrick to paint a much larger picture.  If one only sees the film for the savage imagery then they have missed the final impact of the films true nature.Face it; we may never fully `get' this film, but to claim it nothing more than a perversion is simplifying it far too much, maybe in an attempt to justify our own misunderstandings.Kubrick was aided by some fantastic performances by the entire cast, most notably the two stars Cruise and Kidman.  Tom Cruise brilliantly captures his characters attraction to a world he doesn't quite understand.  Nicole has the most complex character in the film and she tackles her performance with real bravo.  Her understanding of what makes her character tick (and those priceless closing words ""We have something very important to do..."") adds so many layers to the films interpretation.  Sydney Pollack also delivers a very controlled and memorable performance and deserves attention for all that he serves with such little screen time.In the end `Eyes Wide Shut' is not a film for everyone, but it should be.  Yes, it is graphic and it is shocking but it is all done in a tasteful (although it may not seem so) manner that carries the film to all kinds of levels of brilliance.  As time passes the film continues to beam like a beacon for all other films to take notice of something far beyond their reach.",5,Only understood with a mind wide shut...,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,4028,"['make', 'point', 'watch', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'year', 'one', 'films', 'touches', 'differently', 'time', 'entertain', 'Once', 'feel', 'have', 'mind', 'made', 'up', 'completely', 'trampled', 'perception', 'events', 'altered', 'mind', 'tries', 're-contemplate', 'everything', 'just', 'witnessed', 'beauty', 'Eyes', 'Shut', 'film', 'so', 'tragically', 'misunderstood', 'many', 'have', 'labeled', 'pointless', 'even', 'trashy', 'fully', 'comprehending', 'film', 'really', 'for.The', 'film', 'almost', 'lost', 'scene', 'scene', 'moment', 'moment', 'final', 'thrusts', 'films', 'focus', 'see', 'explanation', 'starting', 'form', 'eyes', 'what', 'so', 'beautiful', 'films', 'construction', 'particular', 'explanation', 'explanation', 'matter', 'completely', 'contradicted', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'questions', 'raised', 'watching', 'masterpiece', 'most', 'intriguing', 'titillating', 'post-viewing', 'conversation', 'Kubrick', 'visual', 'styling', 'incomparable', 'approach', 'rabid', 'subject', 'hand', 'frankness', 'blunt', 'rashness', 'material', 'pristine', 'foundation', 'films', 'more', 'startling', 'sequences.The', 'film', 'high', 'society', 'couple', 'Bill', 'Alice', 'attending', 'party', 'Separated', 'one', 'find', 'Alice', 'drinking', 'detachment', 'away', 'dancing', 'too', 'close', 'stranger', 'Bill', 'way', 'large', 'mansion', 'make', 'services', 'available', 'need', 'one', 'such', 'individual', 'being', 'good', 'friend', 'Victor', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'characters', 'development', 'emotional', 'connection', 'one', 'audience', 'Alice', 'Bill', 'are', 'sense', 'playing', 'variations', 'locking', 'away', 'true', 'identities', 'sake', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'faking', 'posing', 'someone', 'else', 'more', 'less', 'playing', 'up', 'parts', 'others', 'want', 'notice.As', 'film', 'witness', 'Bill', 'emersion', 'dark', 'underworld', 'drawn', 'perverse', 'curiosity', 'yet', 'repelled', 'desirable', 'innocence', 'own', 'feelings', 'regards', 'marriage', 'life', 'keys', 'own', 'tendencies', 'startling', 'discoveries', 'discoveries', 'him.', 'Eyes', 'Shut', 'unfairly', 'recognized', 'fearless', 'depictions', 'immorality', 'sequences', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'backbone', 'ones', 'distaste', 'admiration', 'film', 'say', 'unfairly', 'scenes', 'are', 'small', 'instrument', 'used', 'Kubrick', 'paint', 'much', 'larger', 'picture', 'one', 'only', 'film', 'savage', 'imagery', 'then', 'have', 'missed', 'final', 'impact', 'films', 'true', 'nature.Face', 'may', 'never', 'fully', 'get', 'film', 'claim', 'nothing', 'more', 'perversion', 'simplifying', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'maybe', 'attempt', 'justify', 'own', 'misunderstandings.Kubrick', 'was', 'aided', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'stars', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'brilliantly', 'characters', 'attraction', 'world', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'Nicole', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'film', 'performance', 'real', 'bravo', 'understanding', 'what', 'character', 'tick', 'priceless', 'closing', 'words', 'have', 'something', 'very', 'important', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'films', 'interpretation', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'also', 'very', 'controlled', 'memorable', 'performance', 'attention', 'such', 'little', 'screen', 'time.In', 'end', 'Eyes', 'Shut', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'Yes', 'graphic', 'shocking', 'done', 'tasteful', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'manner', 'film', 'kinds', 'levels', 'brilliance', 'time', 'film', 'beam', 'beacon', 'other', 'films', 'take', 'notice', 'something', 'far', 'reach']",N/A

It's JUST A MOVIE ! There may be questions or plotholes and  bizarre scenes with meaningless situations big enough to compare with the  Holland Tunnel...  The fact of the matter is, and for the  record, for me personally it was pure sublime entertainment.It was a  sleeper movie (pun intended for some) in which the pshychological aspect of  it kept me hooked.I often found myself asking how far will Tom Cruise's  character go to spite his wife even though she was only unfaithful to him  in thought ? True, the action, well, there was none, took form in the  mental sense keeping the viewer wondering who would commit the final  physical act of deception. Eyes Wide Shut posed a very endearing and  timeless psychological and moral question for not just married couples but  for everybody. The question is whether or not we can differentiate between  our fantasies and desires versus our needs and wants (not just in the  carnal sexual sense) ? In other words, do we as humans sometimes find  ourselves blurring the distinction between fiction and fact ? Of course we  do. The &quot;real&quot; trick is separating ourselves from actually  carrying out these dangerous desires before the damage is done and letting  them turn into an obsession bearing remorseful consequences...The  scenery or sets (particularly the mansion of the masked society) was very  artistic in the sense as though I felt I was looking at a surrealistic  painting. The atmosphere was very reminiscent of an Enigma music video. The  soundtrack was nowhere near the brilliance of a Vangelis score. Yet, with  the simple 2 or 3 piano keynotes, much emotion and drama was conveyed.Do  I highly recommend this movie to everyone (colleagues, friends, family,  etc.)? Of course not.

118584,A1PASRZ81DY9C,079074841X,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 3/06, 4/13Rate: 53/06: Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece Eyes Wide Shut involves lavishly and lustfully cinematography and is highly sensual and erotic. The acting is thoroughly sensational in terms of being sexually arousing. Tom Cruise once again is marvelous. I love the buildup of the conflict and the mysterious aura around the build-up of the plot. The climax is well-enriched. Although not in the same vein as Chinatown, there is a certain film neo-noir in Eyes Wide Shut. There is a gripping moment when Tom Cruise's character suddenly finds out what happened to the hooker that he had a change of mind before allowing himself to go further, and then there is the moment of truth when he realizes that, based on his jealousy, would break the chain in the norms of the outer world that he is not so accustomed to, let alone his belonging into that. Described as a ""psychedelic sex journey,"" Eyes Wide Shut is definitely a one. Perhaps the shock of sex acts becomes minimal when the banality of them is once reached, and the story becomes unfolded into something deeper: the paradox of the bigger picture which ultimately leads to a very serious end: death. It is interesting to take Eyes Wide Shut into a different perspective if all of what had happened did not happen already had the wife exercised discreetness of her lustful secret. Then, none of what had transpired would have happened, and life for them would have been running smoothly as usual. So, Eyes Wide Shut is a fabulous erotica picture enriched with masterful direction in an extremely tasteful cinematography.4/13: It is always a good idea to see a film again when enough time has passed to see if the original judgment still holds. Unfortunately, for Eyes Wide Shut, it doesn't pass the test. I realize now how superficially boring the film has been. Stanley Kubrick is famous for making his pictures dreadfully slow and stoic. Eyes Wide Shut is no exception to the rule. I remember in A Clockwork Orange about how women were constantly naked all the time and portrayed as sexual objects. Again, Kubrick brings that to Eyes Wide Shut. Many may think that Eyes Wide Shut is sexy and sensual as it gets, but I find the more naked the women are, the less of an effect there is from the two adjectives. Perhaps ""less is more"" can't be any more true. Although Tom Cruise gives a great pensive performance, it's Nicole Kidman who comes off being the worst performer. The way she laughs and the way she thinks that she is the exalted one makes me want to say that she is a gold digger who is also a failed art gallery owner and has nothing going for her. In fact, I think Tom Cruise's character is better off divorcing her and getting somebody else more deserving because what I see out of him has been through and through success. Of course, one can characterize the whole trip as part of his confusion about his standing in the marriage and whether if it has been a fraud or not. Ultimately, the film fails to prove a point and instead makes a showy grandiose display of opulence and beautiful interiors. All in all, Eyes Wide Shut is the last film of Stanley Kubrick's career and pretty much states everything of what his films are like: boring, slow, stoic, unrealistic, and pointless. Hence, I am dropping the rating of the film from `10' to `5'.",3,Unrealistic and Certainly Tedious.,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,3329,"['Viewed', '3/06', '4/13Rate', '53/06', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'final', 'masterpiece', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'lavishly', 'lustfully', 'cinematography', 'highly', 'sensual', 'erotic', 'acting', 'thoroughly', 'sensational', 'terms', 'being', 'sexually', 'arousing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'once', 'again', 'marvelous', 'love', 'buildup', 'conflict', 'mysterious', 'aura', 'build-up', 'plot', 'climax', 'well-enriched', 'not', 'same', 'vein', 'Chinatown', 'certain', 'film', 'neo-noir', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'gripping', 'moment', 'when', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'suddenly', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'hooker', 'had', 'change', 'mind', 'allowing', 'go', 'further', 'then', 'moment', 'truth', 'when', 'based', 'jealousy', 'would', 'break', 'chain', 'norms', 'outer', 'world', 'not', 'so', 'accustomed', 'let', 'alone', 'belonging', 'Described', 'psychedelic', 'sex', 'journey', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'definitely', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'shock', 'sex', 'acts', 'minimal', 'when', 'banality', 'once', 'reached', 'story', 'unfolded', 'something', 'deeper', 'paradox', 'bigger', 'picture', 'ultimately', 'very', 'serious', 'end', 'death', 'interesting', 'take', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'different', 'perspective', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'already', 'had', 'wife', 'exercised', 'discreetness', 'lustful', 'secret', 'Then', 'none', 'what', 'had', 'transpired', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'running', 'smoothly', 'usual', 'So', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'fabulous', 'erotica', 'picture', 'enriched', 'masterful', 'direction', 'extremely', 'tasteful', 'cinematography.4/13', 'always', 'good', 'idea', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'when', 'enough', 'time', 'passed', 'see', 'original', 'judgment', 'still', 'Unfortunately', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', ""n't"", 'pass', 'test', 'realize', 'now', 'how', 'superficially', 'boring', 'film', 'been', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'famous', 'making', 'pictures', 'dreadfully', 'slow', 'stoic', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'exception', 'rule', 'remember', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'how', 'women', 'were', 'constantly', 'naked', 'time', 'portrayed', 'sexual', 'objects', 'Again', 'Kubrick', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Many', 'may', 'think', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'sexy', 'sensual', 'find', 'more', 'naked', 'women', 'are', 'less', 'effect', 'two', 'adjectives', 'Perhaps', 'less', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'true', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'great', 'pensive', 'performance', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'off', 'being', 'worst', 'performer', 'way', 'way', 'exalted', 'one', 'want', 'say', 'gold', 'digger', 'who', 'also', 'failed', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'nothing', 'going', 'fact', 'think', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'better', 'off', 'divorcing', 'getting', 'somebody', 'else', 'more', 'deserving', 'what', 'see', 'been', 'success', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'characterize', 'whole', 'trip', 'part', 'confusion', 'standing', 'marriage', 'been', 'fraud', 'not', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'prove', 'point', 'instead', 'showy', 'grandiose', 'display', 'opulence', 'beautiful', 'interiors', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'last', 'film', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'career', 'pretty', 'much', 'states', 'everything', 'what', 'films', 'are', 'boring', 'slow', 'stoic', 'unrealistic', 'pointless', 'Hence', 'am', 'dropping', 'rating', 'film', '10', '5']",N/A

Warren,"[4, 4]","The only reason I can think of that this DVD deserves 3.5 stars is the MPAA's mandate for the inclusion of digital figures to cover up the sex sequences, which can be seen ""unadulterated"" in the Region 2 disc (but with different music, as the theatrical/Region 1 DVD's music was found to be offensive to Hindus, I believe).But otherwise, this movie is absolutely phenomenal. Like the best of Bergman, like Welles' F for Fake, like Fellini's 8 1/2, this movie represents a story that is truly genre-less. How do you classify Eyes Wide Shut? At Kubrick's _worst_, his movies were some of the best out of their given genres. At his best, they are not only the best of the genre, but transcend it altogether (2001, Barry Lyndon, Dr. Stranglove...).Other reviewers have already noted what is fantastic about this movie. The lightening is some of the best of Kubrick's career. It holds both Nicole Kidman's and Tom Cruise's best performances of their careers. Sydney Pollack is fantastic. And the centerpiece, the orgy sequence, is quintessential Kubrick.I think that this movie will be reevaluated in the future, and people will finally understand it for what it is. Personally, I think that Eyes Wide Shut is effectively a period piece. It is a period piece about the 1990s and the era of civilization we now find ourselves in, with the sexual freedoms and faults (and diseases) we now have to deal with. How else do you explain the nondescript ""New York City""? How else do you explain the persistent presence of a Christmas tree in _every damn scene_? It underscores the pervasive materialism at the heart of the 80s and 90s, which in turn underscores the kinds of sexuality and sexual inadequacies on display in this movie. It is a period piece about the 90s, it just happens to have been made in 90s as well.With his final film, Kubrick managed to create a story that is free of any genre, free of baggage, free of any previous assumptions about what a film can do. It is not his best, but it might be his most fulfilling, and it sums up one of the most cynical, but also one of the greatest director's career with a tiny glimmer of modest - but realistic - hope.",5,The misunderstood masterpiece,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2162,"['only', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'DVD', '3.5', 'stars', 'MPAA', 'mandate', 'inclusion', 'digital', 'figures', 'cover', 'up', 'sex', 'sequences', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'unadulterated', 'Region', '2', 'disc', 'different', 'music', 'theatrical/Region', '1', 'DVD', 'music', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'offensive', 'Hindus', 'believe', '.But', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'best', 'Bergman', 'Welles', 'F', 'Fake', 'Fellini', '8', '1/2', 'movie', 'story', 'truly', 'genre-less', 'How', 'do', 'classify', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Kubrick', '_worst_', 'movies', 'were', 'best', 'given', 'genres', 'best', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'genre', 'transcend', 'altogether', '2001', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'Dr.', 'Stranglove', '.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'what', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'lightening', 'best', 'Kubrick', 'career', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'best', 'performances', 'careers', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'fantastic', 'centerpiece', 'orgy', 'sequence', 'quintessential', 'Kubrick.I', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'reevaluated', 'future', 'people', 'will', 'finally', 'understand', 'what', 'Personally', 'think', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'effectively', 'period', 'piece', 'period', 'piece', '1990s', 'era', 'civilization', 'now', 'find', 'sexual', 'freedoms', 'faults', 'diseases', 'now', 'have', 'deal', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'explain', 'nondescript', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'explain', 'persistent', 'presence', 'Christmas', 'tree', '_every', 'damn', 'scene_', 'pervasive', 'materialism', 'heart', '80s', '90s', 'turn', 'kinds', 'sexuality', 'sexual', 'inadequacies', 'display', 'movie', 'period', 'piece', '90s', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'made', '90s', 'well.With', 'final', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'managed', 'create', 'story', 'free', 'genre', 'free', 'baggage', 'free', 'previous', 'assumptions', 'what', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'best', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'fulfilling', 'sums', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'cynical', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'director', 'career', 'tiny', 'glimmer', 'modest', 'realistic', 'hope']",N/A

Yes, Kubrick died before the film was issued, but it was practically finished at the time: had he lived, I doubt the film would have been substantially different.Yes, the film is ""slow,"" but this is part of Kubrick's art: it's not boring: there's always plenty to look at.  Part of Kubrick's genius was his expansion of cinematographic space-time.No, the story is not a dream.  Unless all life is a waking dream.  The story is ""real"" and takes place within about a 72 hour period.  There is a story-line which can be followed, and basically has a beginning; a middle; and an ending.The story is basically thus: sophisticated New York couple find themselves attracted to potential sex partners outside their marriage.  Both somewhat disillusioned, the man (who is a doctor who makes house-calls to wealthy clients) goes out one night.  He passes through several narratives of sexual danger of various types.  He also gets a first hand idea what kind of freaky sex other people are engaging in all over the place--high and low, rich and poor.  Through a series of coincidental occurrences he thinks an overdose is an homicide; but in the end, via a critical disucssion, someone sets him straight about the whole thing.

It is essential to be interested in this man and his motives,  otherwise you will be bored since this film runs over 150 minutes.

Stanley Kubrick always searched for  themes that would challenge viewers, and force them to see the world in a  different light. 'Eyes Wide Shut', his final film, certainly does that, and  is a film that will be enjoyed more with repeated viewings.What is  reality? This film challenges us to make our own conclusions, as we see the  story of a  Yuppie couple unfold. Tom Cruise, as the husband, has a  successful career, but is shallow and superficial, coasting along on his  looks and social contacts. Nicole Kidman, his unemployed spouse, is a good  wife and mother, but bored, and compensates by drinking and flirting, and  fantasizing about a Naval officer she'd seen the previous summer. As she  acknowledges her erotic daydreams to Cruise, he reacts, first with  jealousy, then with a desire to find an outlet for the sexual frustration  he feels. Thus begins nighttime odysseys into a dreamlike world of  discovery; of a friend's unfulfilled desires, of a dual-personality hooker,  of a teenager being pimped by her father, of a cult which may only promote  orgies, or may have a far more sinister intent.Nothing is spelled out,  or made obvious, and Kubrick throws in clues which will have you reaching  conclusions that you may find will change, when the film is viewed again!

As  usual with Kubrick; great cinematography, lighting, score and atmosphere.  Great performances by almost all the cast, a little mis-casting may have  hurt the film a bit. The film possesses a provocative subject matter that  raises questions that are mostly left unanswered, but maybe it's better  that way.

The fact that Dr Hartford spends so much time walking the streets late at night between a world that is hidden and the real world that is falling a part at home tells you that this isn't some childhood fairy tale but more a nightmare that both he and his wife want to wake up from.It is a lavish film when one stands back and looks at the scenery per se.

I am awed by the audacity of Kubrick and the couple to go through with such an immoral project.  He was totally ineffective as a licensed MD, though whatever ID he used got him the info he needed and in some doors.  At the Verona Restaurant he order ""Cappaccinno, please,"" then got more than he expected.  The piano was eerie outside the restaurant and later at home.  He had been followed from the newsstand to the morgue where he saw the body of the woman who saved him at the strange ceremony.It was staged, fake, a charade just like that one in Young Sherlock Holmes and the new Dragnet.  Do people really do such strange things.  It was for your own good.  Make-believe reality is just a dream.  Somebody died, but that happens all the time.  Life goes on, until it doesn't.  That kind of life style was unbelieavle for someone who lives in Tennessee, but perhaps New Yorkers and those in Los Angeles have their kicks dressing up and acting like long ago and far away.Finally, I have found Bill and I have looked for years.

118594,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,079074841X,Bill Garrison,"[7, 10]","From the reviews I have read, it seems that this movie is supposed to have a moral or a meaning, since Kubrick is such a great director.  I don't know if I agree he is that good, but this movie to me had a clear meaning and message.  Eyes Wide Shut attempts to explore the fact of how fragile marriege vows are.I haven't decided if Kubrick takes a stand, or if he just presents this movie as a statement of fact, or a warning to be careful in a marriage, because it doesn't take too much to ruin.  Nor have I figured out a meaning to the last scene in the toy store.  But after watching the movie I came away with an overall message.First, this movie has nudity, but like another reviewer said, it is not erotic.  It is however tragic.  The movie's message to me was this.  There is sex everywhere in society and you can get sex any time you want it.  Beautiful men and women are everywhere and society thinks nothing of you if you submit to sex outside of marriage.  So what holds marriages together?  Without getting religious or preachy, it is the commentment of the man and woman to each other.  The marriage vow can be broken by thought, such as when Alice confesses not just that she thought another man was cute, but that she would have given up everything for a night with him.This devestates Bill, who in his mind sees Alice breaking part of the marriage vow.  He goes out for a night on the town and I think would have had sex if the circumstances were right.  He was willing to get revenge on his wife by doing something much worse that she did.In the end, Alice and Bill are both equally hurt by the relevations of the other.  I think this movie is saying how easy it is to ruin a marriage through lust or adultery and that it takes a conscious effort by both parties to make a marriage work.Or Kubrick could be saying if you are going to cheat or lust over other people, keep your freaking mouth shut.I thought this was an intriguing movie because I found myself rooting for the better side of each person's character to come through, and at the end it did, I guess.

118595,A48THA5X4OUAB,079074841X,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[2, 5]","This is Stanley Kubrick's unfinished toy, not a coherent movie.  In that sense it has much in common with Kurosawa's final film, Dreams -- another startling collection of scraps and experiments, some brilliant.  Kurosawa's finale works better because it makes no pretense at telling a coherent story, just constitutes a box of unrelated dreams put on film.There is of course much brilliance in evidence here.  Certain scenes are simply as great as anything Kubrick ever did -- the dead patient's daughter attempting to seduce Cruise at the deathbed; the poolroom argument about the dead girl; the show-stopper deadpan comedy (a rare treat from Kubrick) of the costume shop.  And also, even in some deplorable scenes, one will see incredibly lovely photography and composition as anyone has ever put into movies, from the man who, it should be pointed out, started out as a Life photographer in the 50s.For those who prize the work of Kubrick, as I do, the film shoud be seen.  It is very instructive of both his strengths and his difficulties (which perhaps should not be over-emphasized since death deprived him of the all important final cut).  But what I see in a lot of the reviews is ""Say it ain't so, Stanley"" -- a refusal to acknowledge than even the greatest of artists can lay eggs, even late in their careers (which of course ignores Beethoven's ""Wellington's Victory,"" Tolstoy's ""Resurrection,"" and countless other turkeys now only historical footnotes).The fact is, to see some of Kubrick's weaknesses so exposed only ought to make one appreciate him more.  The embarrassing part, however, is an obsessiveness coupled with a voyeurism fully worthy of Hitchcock at his worst.  The sometimes brilliant Kidman, who by all accounts gave her heart and soul to Kubrick in this film, is woefully misused as nothing more that a t & a show.  Her pivotal ""seduction"" scene is a terrible joke; yet so carelly made in trademark Kubrick style it looks like a massive self-inflicted wound where the heart of the movie is supposed to be.  Much better is the light comedy of the 2 girls flirting with Cruise at the same time -- another successful late life experiment by Kubrick in the pure comedic that looks uncharacteristically fresh and unstudied for this director.  Indeed, the workmanlike Cruise -- the Western world's least favorite major star -- does a lot to prove his mettle in this movie, against great odds.  But all the king's horses can't save the heavy dark nonsense of the secret sex club, which brings the whole disaster crashing down.  It looks like a ludicrous X-rated shot at Darth Vader/Star Wars stuff, something for sexually exhausted over the hill audiences rather than the teen crowd.  It is so bad it might send you running for the exits (even from your own living room) before the closer.I note that I have failed here to analyze the plot, much less even discuss it.  The fact is, I do not have the slightest clue what this movie was about, even what ""happens"" in it.Truth is, Kubrick's filmic success was in almost every case based on a grand bow to a novel or book, with a very careful and attentive respect for authorial intent rare for modern directors.  Barry Lyndon, Lolita, Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket all follow this formula.  By transposing a Freud era psychodrama from Vienna to modern New York (and for that matter, to a facsimile of the Big Apple created at Shepparton Studios because the aging director had grown too eccentric to fly)  was a late life break out of a self-imposed cage that, perhaps, had finally driven him nuts.  So he got spectacular fireworks and a fine montage of still pictures, but no coherent product. One thinks of the tragedy of the aged Tolstoy, running away from his beloved country estate and his wife in his last days, to be dragged back and die.  Whatever the result, Kubrick like Tolstoy died in harness to his art, and if his vision cracked in the process his effort is nonethless worthy of careful attention.  But every Kubrick fan should by now have encountered the director's Olympian detatchment and objectivity, in his best works, and so I suspect he himself would not have endorsed attempts to over-praise this enigma or inflate it into something it is not.",3,"Say It Ain't So, Stanley",1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,4234,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'unfinished', 'toy', 'not', 'coherent', 'movie', 'sense', 'much', 'common', 'Kurosawa', 'final', 'film', 'Dreams', 'startling', 'collection', 'scraps', 'experiments', 'brilliant', 'Kurosawa', 'finale', 'better', 'pretense', 'telling', 'coherent', 'story', 'just', 'box', 'unrelated', 'dreams', 'put', 'film.There', 'course', 'much', 'brilliance', 'evidence', 'here', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'as', 'great', 'anything', 'Kubrick', 'ever', 'did', 'dead', 'patient', 'daughter', 'attempting', 'seduce', 'Cruise', 'deathbed', 'poolroom', 'argument', 'dead', 'girl', 'show-stopper', 'deadpan', 'comedy', 'rare', 'treat', 'Kubrick', 'costume', 'shop', 'also', 'even', 'deplorable', 'scenes', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'incredibly', 'lovely', 'photography', 'composition', 'anyone', 'ever', 'put', 'movies', 'man', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'started', 'out', 'Life', 'photographer', '50s.For', 'who', 'prize', 'work', 'Kubrick', 'do', 'film', 'shoud', 'be', 'seen', 'very', 'instructive', 'strengths', 'difficulties', 'perhaps', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'over-emphasized', 'death', 'deprived', 'important', 'final', 'cut', 'what', 'see', 'lot', 'reviews', 'Say', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'Stanley', 'refusal', 'acknowledge', 'even', 'greatest', 'artists', 'can', 'lay', 'eggs', 'even', 'late', 'careers', 'course', 'ignores', 'Beethoven', 'Wellington', 'Victory', 'Tolstoy', 'Resurrection', 'countless', 'other', 'turkeys', 'now', 'only', 'historical', 'footnotes', '.The', 'fact', 'see', 'Kubrick', 'weaknesses', 'so', 'exposed', 'only', 'ought', 'make', 'one', 'appreciate', 'more', 'embarrassing', 'part', 'however', 'obsessiveness', 'coupled', 'voyeurism', 'fully', 'worthy', 'Hitchcock', 'worst', 'sometimes', 'brilliant', 'Kidman', 'who', 'accounts', 'gave', 'heart', 'soul', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'woefully', 'misused', 'nothing', 'more', 't', 'show', 'pivotal', 'seduction', 'scene', 'terrible', 'joke', 'so', 'carelly', 'made', 'trademark', 'Kubrick', 'style', 'massive', 'self-inflicted', 'wound', 'where', 'heart', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'Much', 'better', 'light', 'comedy', '2', 'girls', 'flirting', 'Cruise', 'same', 'time', 'successful', 'late', 'life', 'experiment', 'Kubrick', 'pure', 'uncharacteristically', 'fresh', 'unstudied', 'director', 'Indeed', 'workmanlike', 'Cruise', 'Western', 'world', 'least', 'favorite', 'major', 'star', 'lot', 'prove', 'mettle', 'movie', 'great', 'odds', 'king', 'horses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'heavy', 'dark', 'nonsense', 'secret', 'sex', 'club', 'whole', 'disaster', 'crashing', 'down', 'ludicrous', 'X-rated', 'shot', 'Darth', 'Vader/Star', 'Wars', 'stuff', 'something', 'sexually', 'exhausted', 'hill', 'rather', 'teen', 'crowd', 'so', 'bad', 'might', 'send', 'running', 'exits', 'even', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'closer.I', 'note', 'have', 'failed', 'here', 'analyze', 'plot', 'much', 'less', 'even', 'discuss', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'slightest', 'clue', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'what', 'it.Truth', 'Kubrick', 'filmic', 'success', 'was', 'almost', 'case', 'based', 'grand', 'bow', 'novel', 'book', 'very', 'careful', 'attentive', 'respect', 'authorial', 'intent', 'rare', 'modern', 'directors', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'Lolita', 'Strangelove', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'follow', 'formula', 'transposing', 'Freud', 'era', 'psychodrama', 'Vienna', 'modern', 'New', 'York', 'matter', 'facsimile', 'Big', 'Apple', 'created', 'Shepparton', 'Studios', 'aging', 'director', 'had', 'grown', 'too', 'eccentric', 'fly', 'was', 'late', 'life', 'break', 'self-imposed', 'cage', 'perhaps', 'had', 'finally', 'driven', 'nuts', 'got', 'spectacular', 'fireworks', 'fine', 'montage', 'still', 'pictures', 'coherent', 'product', 'One', 'tragedy', 'aged', 'Tolstoy', 'running', 'away', 'beloved', 'country', 'estate', 'wife', 'last', 'days', 'be', 'dragged', 'back', 'die', 'result', 'Kubrick', 'Tolstoy', 'died', 'harness', 'art', 'vision', 'cracked', 'process', 'effort', 'nonethless', 'worthy', 'careful', 'attention', 'Kubrick', 'fan', 'should', 'now', 'have', 'encountered', 'director', 'Olympian', 'detatchment', 'objectivity', 'best', 'works', 'so', 'suspect', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'endorsed', 'attempts', 'over-praise', 'enigma', 'inflate', 'something', 'not']",N/A

118597,A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ,079074841X,Blahblahblah,"[2, 2]","I believe that Kubrick should be satisfied that the last movie he ever made is this good (although it is unfortunately not his best). It is a shame that it has been largely marketed as an exploitation movie, although it was an interesting experience watching this movie along with an audience filled with people hoping for the next Showgirls. Sure, it is filled with some of the sexiest women I have ever seen, and it has the famous scene of Nicole and Tom making love as well as the infamous orgy scene. But it is also an interesting examination of such issues as trust, fidelity, possessiveness and marriage filled with humour, intelligence and suspence. Underlying all of this is an entertaining plot about a secret society.I won't add to the many recountings of the plot below, but many people who have seen this film were disappointed that the resolution of the mystery about the secret society remains ambiguous, but I found that to be one of its most brilliant touches.  Furthermore, this is a far more realistic handling of such a theme in a movie as it is very doubtful that a lone doctor would uncover all the secrets of a secret society comprised of some of the richest and most powerful people in the country in 24 hours.  Nor does Kubrick try to staple on a &quot;they lived happily after ever ending&quot; to the movie that would be equally unrealistic, instead leaving the Nicole and Tom characters on a very witty note, merely suggesting things will work out, with one of the best last lines I have ever heard.Also included is all the beautiful scenery and cinematography one expects from a Kubrick film, and he also manages to pull out the best possible performance he could from his stars. Even Cruise's performance is good (likely because of Kubrick's notorious practice of using hundreds of takes until everything is perfect and thus taking a couple of years to complete anything).",5,Sexy AND Intelligent,990662400,"05 24, 2001",2001,1901,"['believe', 'Kubrick', 'should', 'be', 'satisfied', 'last', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'best', 'shame', 'been', 'largely', 'marketed', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', 'audience', 'filled', 'people', 'hoping', 'next', 'Showgirls', 'Sure', 'filled', 'sexiest', 'women', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'famous', 'scene', 'Nicole', 'Tom', 'making', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'infamous', 'orgy', 'scene', 'also', 'interesting', 'examination', 'such', 'issues', 'trust', 'fidelity', 'possessiveness', 'marriage', 'filled', 'humour', 'intelligence', 'suspence', 'Underlying', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'secret', 'society.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'many', 'recountings', 'plot', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'were', 'disappointed', 'resolution', 'mystery', 'secret', 'society', 'ambiguous', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'touches', 'Furthermore', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'handling', 'theme', 'movie', 'very', 'doubtful', 'lone', 'doctor', 'would', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'secret', 'society', 'comprised', 'richest', 'most', 'powerful', 'people', 'country', '24', 'hours', 'Kubrick', 'try', 'staple', 'quot', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'quot', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'unrealistic', 'instead', 'leaving', 'Nicole', 'Tom', 'characters', 'very', 'witty', 'note', 'merely', 'suggesting', 'things', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'last', 'lines', 'have', 'ever', 'heard.Also', 'included', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'one', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'also', 'pull', 'out', 'best', 'possible', 'performance', 'could', 'stars', 'Even', 'Cruise', 'performance', 'good', 'likely', 'Kubrick', 'notorious', 'practice', 'using', 'hundreds', 'everything', 'perfect', 'thus', 'taking', 'couple', 'years', 'complete', 'anything']",N/A

118600,A20IIR0422G3A5,079074841X,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 4]","`Eyes Wide Shut' is Stanley Kubrick's last film and like every other film where he had complete creative control (For `Spartacus' and `Paths of Glory', Kubrick was largely an employee of Kirk Douglas), there is much which is both brilliant and puzzling.From the outset, I will say that while there is much nudity and some fairly explicit sex in this film, it is clear to me that all of this was done for a greater dramatic effect than simple `soft core porn'. This case should be clear if you compare this film with `The Story of O' which, while it has honorable intentions and high aspirations to be something more than a piece of pornography, the difference in the level of artistry should be obvious, as `The Story of O' is very high class pornography and `Eyes Wide Shut' is not.Much can be adduced from Kubrick's source, a work of fiction by Arthur Schnitzler entitled in German,`Traumnovelle' or `Dream Novel'. While I am not up on the details of Schnitzler's work, I know he worked in pre-World War II Germany or Austria at a time when the doctrines of Sigmund Freud were easily at their high water mark, especially among playwrights and novelists. One needs a copy of Freud open to work out much of the symbolism in, for example, Eugene O'Neill's plays such as `Mourning Becomes Elecktra'. This means that any sexual references are certain to have at least two or more interpretations, as Herr Freud and his students found sex to be behind most motives. And, for men, at least, that belief persists to today.At the very least, this literary source gives us a clue that a lot of what we are seeing has many dreamlike properties, if not explicitly scenes from a dream. Another thing this source explains is why the locations for the story are much more at home in Paris or Berlin or Vienna or Prague or Rome or London (where the film was actually shot) than in New York City. While American robber barons build their fair share of large houses and estates, they can't hold a candle to the opulence found in pre-World War I European houses of the nobility. It would not be a bit surprised if Schnitzler's original story took place in Vienna and its outskirts.The problem with the dream scenario is that there is no evidence that the highly improbable centerpiece scene of the story, a highly ritualistic pairing of strikingly beautiful virtually naked, masked women are paired up with robed and cloaked members, seemingly both male and female, of the onlooking crowd, in a very European looking suburban estate. Admission to these proceedings are exclusively by password changed every day, and given out, it would seem, to a highly exclusive group of (probably) exeedingly wealthy people. And, everyone participating in this erotic pantomine wear Venetian style maskes.I confess that it took me three attempts to watch the movie to its conclusion without falling asleep before the ending credits roll. Part of that is my fault for watching it late in the evening, but part is due to the fact that the pace of the dialogue and business is almost somnambulistic. This is not the Tom Cruise of `Top Gun' or `Days of Thunder' or expecially `Rainman' when he was in top form. I believe the relaxed pace was certainly coming from Kubrick's direction and not Cruise's acting. I tried to picture a more high powered actor in the role such as Nicholas Cage or Russell Crowe, and I could not see them adding any real energy to the performance.The very best scene in the movie occurs when Cruise's character, a highly respected doctor, rousts the owner of a costume shop out of bed at 2:00 AM to rent a tuxedo, cape, shoes, and mask in order to attend the password access only estate party. The shop owner, played by Rade Sherbedgia is a perfect study of a first generation immigrant shop owner in New York City. This scene also gives us some clue that all is not as it seems when the shop owner discovers his very nubile teenaged daughter consorting in secret with two very oriental gentlemen, while the shop owner and daughter seem to be or some central European nationality. The aura of strangeness is doubled when the good doctor returns the clothes the next morning and meets the two oriental gentlemen and the shop owner in polite conversation, with no trace of the fatherly rage of the early morning.To cut to the chase, this is certainly not Kubrick's best or most memorable film. `2001', `Lolita', `Dr. Strangelove', `Full Metal Jacket', and `Clockwork Orange' are easily better. Even his rendition of the obscure Thackery novel, `Barry Lyndon', starring Ryan O'Neill has some better moments than `Eyes Wide Shut'. And yet, it may still be better than 2/3 of the other movies made today. Like all Kubrick movies, it definitely succeeds in making you think about the film.Recommended for Kubrick fans and fans of all other `autre' directors such as David Lynch, Peter Greenway, and Ken Russell.",4,Important movie from important director.

The casting of real-life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, serves to make Kubrick's  complex plot more believable. Once we get through the slow beginning, we  are taken into a new world of sexual exploration, and painstaking  perfection.  The film centers around Dr. Bill Hertford and his sultry  wife Alice. The couple faces infedelity, strange sexual encounters, and a  longing for other people. These elements take them into a strange two day  period.  Bill Hertford finds out shortly into the film that his wife  visualized their love making with another man. From there, he sets off in  search of answers and a way to ease his anger toward his wife. He thinks he  has found an answer to his problems when a an old friend from Med. School  invites him to a mansion for a &quot;party&quot;.  Once arriving, his  troubles at home are put aside. For he has entered the homebase of a cult  that thrives on strange rituals and sexual desire. After seeing a ritual  involving the saying of several Gregorian Chants and masked women, he is  warned to leave by an unknown masked woman. Not heeding the warning, he is  then caught by the cult's leader. His life is spared by the unknown woman,  and he leaves the mansion.  Not being able to shake the images of the  night before, he seeks clues as to who the cult are and what they do.  Sources that would have been reliable disappear. He is warned in the form  of a letter, and yet he does not give up. He will find out what happened,  and tell his wife everything. So concludes this film.  Director Stanley  Kubrick went to great lengths to make a great film. He built a wonderful  reproduction of NYC's Greenwich Village, and had a great cast of  characters. One word of advice, this film is not for everyone though. You  have to understand the plot, and accept Stanley Kubrick for what he was.  Which was a film genius.

I've know reviews have decried those who devalued this movie because the sexual side of it never really materialized...or that there was too much hype given to the marriage dynamic of Kidman and Cruise working on the same movie. There are those who felt the work was too polarizing.But, simply put, this is not a great film.In fact, it came close to being horribly boring. I love Kubrick, and I hate saying this, but I had a lot of trouble staying involved with this movie.  It's just not very good.I've noticed that many of the Kubrick camp fight viciously on this film, and I think I know why: great films likeDr. Strangelove  [Blu-ray] or2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray] orThe Shining [Blu-ray] orFull Metal Jacket [Blu-ray] don't need protecting...Kubrick's art is evident in them, and so what if some don't see it?But here? Kubrick missed it on this one, and it it simply has to go into the ""Loss"" column, and that hurts.  So they attack the naysayers, citing our inability to discern what art is, that we just don't ""get"" the film's message, that the film was too subtle, and on and on.But folks, it's just slow moving, and it promised much more than it gave. It wan't that it wasn't sexy--it wasn't, but that isn't the problem--it was that when all was said and done the movie never gelled, never achieved what I perceive to be the Stanley Kubrick vision, a unique story that only he could have told.  Given the plot (I'm not going to; it's at the top of the page), a lot of directors could have come up with a more compelling movie.I definitely COULD get into the fact that Cruise's character was obsessed with the fact that his wife considered cheating on him.  But that's just clever casting...is there anyone who couldn't see Cruise--the perfect Tom Cruise, control freak that he is--obsessing over something like that?Beyond that, the ""night out"" and the unusual events that followed, should have made for a more powerful movie.  But that's it: it didn't.  If you recite the things that happen during this movie it sounds exciting...so why wasn't it?I don't feel that every director owes me, and that they must keep me ""amused,"" but I do believe a story should be compelling.  A slow pace CAN BE forceful...certainly, ""2001"" was slow, but it was EXTREMELY powerful.This wasn't, and that's the problem.",3,"I Love Kubrick, but Didn't Like This One",1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2398,"['love', 'Kubrick', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'three', 'stars.I', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', ""'ve"", 'know', 'reviews', 'have', 'decried', 'who', 'devalued', 'movie', 'sexual', 'side', 'never', 'really', 'materialized', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'hype', 'given', 'marriage', 'dynamic', 'Kidman', 'Cruise', 'working', 'same', 'movie', 'are', 'who', 'felt', 'work', 'was', 'too', 'polarizing.But', 'simply', 'put', 'not', 'great', 'film.In', 'fact', 'came', 'close', 'being', 'horribly', 'boring', 'love', 'Kubrick', 'hate', 'saying', 'had', 'lot', 'trouble', 'staying', 'involved', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good.I', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'many', 'Kubrick', 'camp', 'fight', 'viciously', 'film', 'think', 'know', 'why', 'great', 'films', 'likeDr', 'Strangelove', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'or2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Shining', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'orFull', 'Metal', 'Jacket', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'protecting', 'Kubrick', 'art', 'evident', 'so', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'here', 'Kubrick', 'missed', 'one', 'simply', 'go', 'Loss', 'column', 'attack', 'naysayers', 'citing', 'inability', 'discern', 'what', 'art', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'subtle', 'on.But', 'folks', 'just', 'slow', 'moving', 'promised', 'much', 'more', 'gave', 'wa', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'was', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'problem', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'never', 'gelled', 'never', 'achieved', 'what', 'perceive', 'be', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'vision', 'unique', 'story', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'Given', 'plot', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'top', 'page', 'lot', 'directors', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'compelling', 'movie.I', 'definitely', 'COULD', 'get', 'fact', 'Cruise', 'character', 'was', 'obsessed', 'fact', 'wife', 'considered', 'cheating', 'just', 'clever', 'casting', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'Cruise', 'perfect', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'control', 'freak', 'obsessing', 'something', 'Beyond', 'night', 'out', 'unusual', 'events', 'followed', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'powerful', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'recite', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'exciting', 'so', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'director', 'must', 'keep', 'amused', 'do', 'believe', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'compelling', 'slow', 'pace', 'CAN', 'BE', 'forceful', 'certainly', '2001', 'was', 'slow', 'was', 'EXTREMELY', 'powerful.This', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem']",N/A

As I understand, he framed it for 4:3 but protected the 1.85 frame for theatrical viewing.  You should note that in the widescreen version, you are actually losing some image on the top and bottom of the frame.  The 4:3 full frame version is the actual full negative.  But to my disappointment...NO, there is no option to choose one or the other.  1.85 is the only version on this BD.Movie notes:This movie took a lot of growing on me.  I watched the film theatrically when it was released and did not like it at all.  Since then, in subsequent viewings, I have come to appreciate the movie more and the tremendous amount of thought that went into it.For a moment, put aside the stories you hear about hundreds of takes on one scene and all the months it took to shoot this film.  What Kubrick put into it was probably an OD of conceptualism for most of us.  Sometimes that can come across as pretentious and unnecessary, but with every viewing something new arises.  If you overanalyze and look for the seemingly most miniscule details, you will be surprised at how much you find and how much of it is 100% relevant.Many have condemned this film as total garbage.  I can't stand Tom Cruise at all and quite honestly he sucks in this film just about as much as he does in any other... but Kubrick makes up for Cruise's shortcomings in many different ways.  Perhaps Cruise's lack of talent even adds to the film in some way.

Fairbanks""","[13, 16]","""Bill, suppose I told you that everything that happened to you there...suppose I said that all of that was staged, that it was a kind of charade? That it was fake?""Victor Ziegler's words explaining away the bizarre orgy that his friend, Dr. Bill Harford, crashed the night before might be a more accurate description of Warner Bros' marketing campaign for Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""After Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then a real-life couple, were cast in the lead roles, the media hype was that Kubrick's final film was about sex, jealousy, infidelity, and the pitfalls of temptation, all of which certainly seemed to be the theme judging by the trailer over which Chris Isaak was heard singing ""Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing."" Most critics and the public swallowed the bait and saw the film with their own eyes wide shut.""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not really about sex at all, nor is it about ""the elusive ambiguity of dream and reality,"" as the back cover of the published screenplay claims.LIke most of Kubrick's films, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is so rich and multi-layered that it requires multiple viewings before its meaning becomes clear. Even then, much of it remains mystifying. But this much can be understood: ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an expose of the world's elite and the occultic rituals they engage in on a regular basis. The bizarre ritual that Tom Cruise's character witnesses is more than mere hedonism, hence the cloaks, the masks, and the bizarre, almost churchly music. It is a Satanic ritual, and Ziegler is right when he tells Harford he wouldn't sleep so well if he knew the names of those participating.Just as Ziegler tried to white-wash the events, the media deliberately tried to control the public's perception of Kubrick's film. Ziegler is a little more honest. He prefaces his remarks with the word ""suppose,"" a hint to Harford and the audience that he's telling Harford a bit of fiction in the hope of dissuading him from pursuing the matter further.And what are we to make of Alice Harford's ""dreams""? And what about the daugher of Milich, the costume shop proprietor, whose father doubles as her pimp?Alice's dreams are more likely flashbacks to real incidents when she was victimized by the government's MK-Ultra mind control program that was exposed in Congressional hearings and which Kubrick touched on in his 1971 film of Anthony Burgess' novel, ""Clockwork Orange.""One question is how did Kubrick ever manage to make ""Eyes Wide Shut"" for a studio which is believed to be controlled by the very kind of people he was exposing?Following the success of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Kubrick was in an enviable position. Warner Bros. lured the world's most innovative filmmaker to their stable by offering him carte blanche. Kubrick's clout was such that he could even convince the studio to withdraw the very profitable and critically acclaimed ""Clockwork Orange"" from UK cinemas when he feared his family would be targets of violence from those who misunderstood the film. Kubrick was free to make the films of his choosing without interference from the studio, and always worked under strict security, keeping the nature of his work a secret even from those who were providing the budget. It's doubtful Warner Bros. realized what Kubrick had achieved with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" until they saw the finished film four months before its release. But like Cruise's Dr. Harford, Kubrick may have wandered out of his depth. On March 7, 1999, only four days after Warner Bros. got its first glimpse at the much ballyhooed production, Kubrick unexpectedly died, exactly 666 days before the dawn of 2001, the year he made famous with his landmark 1968 film.Yes, 666 as in the mark of the beast.Coincidence? Conspiracy?Aside from its themes, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is as impressive as all of Kubrick's films. The production design, cinematography, and music are as flawless as they are unforgettable. The performances are also top notch. Tom Cruise, whose acting skills are often dismissed, is at his best here, playing a man whose jealousy leads him down a path where he learns much more than he suspected about the circles in which he socializes. Kidman is good, too, though she has some early moments when she unconvincingly overacts. Pollock as Ziegler shows he's still a better actor than a director (though he's not too shabby behind the camera either), and there's Leon Vitali, who played Lord Bullingdon in ""Barry Lyndon"" before working behind-the-scenes on Kubrick's last three films, as the sinister Red Cloak.""Eyes Wide Shut"" may be Kubrick's most daring work. It is certainly one of his finest. If your own eyes remain shut to the truths of this film, it's recommended you see it again, this time as a double feature with Alex Jones' ""Inside Bohemian Grove,"" available on DVD with the equally informative ""Order of Death.""Brian W.

Kubrick helped augment the way movies expressed themselves by  showing that motion pictures had the ability to convincingly convey complex  moral and philosophical issues by the forum of the moving image. Kubrick's  final film, Eyes Wide Shut, deals with the interdependant relationship  between romantic fullfillment and individual emotional identity. Both  function within the minds of the adults that inhabit Eyes Wide Shut's  world. Yet every major character in the film from Cruise and Kidman's  characters to Pollack's millionare to the female prositutes connect their  lack of sexual satisifaction to their failed conceptions of their own  lives. Everyone in this film attempt activities that might act like a  catalyst and break them free of their devalued state of mind, yet the  initial act just proliferates into a pattern and a downward spiral of  misunderstanding. The hidden society that is at the heart of this film,  deals primarily with the depths those will go to find self-worth and  satisfaction in their lives. Others dream of elusive possibilities that  might have ruined their lives but plague their fantasies. Sexual dreams,  acts, and fanatsies are the irrational kinetic tangent that lures these  characters into the bowels of insanity and beyond. Eyes Wide Shut is very  mature voyage into humanity's base instincts. It has one of the few  sexually mature and insightful naratives in the motion picture history.

To a certain  extent, my reviews tend to rage at the world outside my own four walls, and  I am willing to admit it.  Seeing movies in a theater, I am too likely to  take revenge on the rest of the audience by inserting my own crass laugh  (the stoned laughter near the beginning might have set me off) when a song  like &quot;Kick in the Head&quot; would provide a soundtrack which was more  to my liking.  Speaking of soundtracks, toward the end of the movie, the  theme is just two notes, alternating back and forth in a way that I might  be able to play on the piano if I knew what the notes were.  Having the  videotape and a keyboard, I may be able to figure out how someday. (When  that happens, it should be obvious to everyone that I was the glutton for  whom this particular punishment was prepared.)  At this point, I am more  interested in seeing the movie.  Allow me to say nothing about Cruise,  Kidman, Kubrick, or dreams.  If this movie doesn't make sense as  entertainment, try looking for something a bit more weird, like some  significance, as a philosopher might explore themes in Voltaire's  &quot;Candide.&quot;  The story told by Eyes Wide Shut starts with a social  party scene, in which the limits of social norms are questioned.  After the  party, Dr. Bill and his wife share a joint, a sure sign for me that the  theme is shifting to feelings which society would like to outlaw, has  probably already outlawed, but which will be treated in a way that usually  sets up outlaws to have the kind of popularity that has been achieved in  modern entertainment.  The sexual elements in this movie were mostly  imaginary, in an obsessive and negative way.  Although the fantasies were  suggested by the comments of Dr. Bill's wife after her inhibitions had been  released by whatever she put in the joint, her curiousity about what a  doctor and patient could possibly be thinking when a doctor examines a  beautiful woman cut to the heart of the meaning of sanity, propriety, and  whether Dr. Bill might ever be in danger of getting into any trouble for a  lack of professionalism.  In my own youth, I tried to develop more of an  interest in what Richard Nixon might consider his kind of greatness than in  sex.  If Dr. Bill shows any signs of having some problems, as so many  viewers did, it might be helpful for others to think of this show as an  attempt to explain Tricky Dick and me to the rest of the world.

If you are looking for a movie with a plot, erotic sex scenes, or something that requires an attention span, you will be one of the 1 star reviewers of this after  viewing it.  It is a movie for the patient and the analytic.  The storyline  and dialogue seem rather tossed in, as they serve the purpose of the scene  more than the only-reason-you-go-to-a-movie plot.  Which is why this loses  so many people.  The plot is not what is interesting about this film  (except the Black Mass/hitherto referred to as the orgy scene, which  interested me greatly from being a Robert Anton Wilson fan, but that is  another story).  Kubrick liked to play with what a movie is, and never has  it been more obvious than in this film, and certainly why so many hate it.  Because it is not as accessable as films like the Shining, Full Metal  Jacket, and Dr. Strangelove (to name a few), this movie is often viewed as  such a disappointment.  Personally, a movie that sticks with me as long as  this one becomes one of my favorite films.  Sure...I thought Tom and Nicole  were not doing as good of an acting job as they normally do, which is a  pity.  It seemed like they were a good decision from a casting point of  view, because of their public images.  Sadly, I don't think they were very  good.

How did they get that through the studio system. When (if) our society figures out what this movie is about, a lot of ""christ-mas"" trees will be burned.

All are superb, especially the interior photography, but I would rather focus on the profound story-telling in this exceptional film.The plot of Eyes Wide Shut weaves together the path of man's fall from Grace, his struggle and journey to regain that state, and the amazing almost accidental way that Grace is restored to the human spirit.Tom Cruise plays Dr. Tom, the Everyman. Nicole Kidman plays Allison, his wife. In the beginning of the film she plays the Eve archtype, who stimulates the fall from Grace with a curious note of discord and jealousy.Tom, the Adam/Everyman character, has it all in his Garden of Eden. He has a wonderful medical practice near Central Park. His beautiful wife, who is shown in total naked innocense in the first scene of the film, manages an art gallery in SoHo. They have a multimillion dollar apartment overlooking the Park. They have a bright and lovely young daughter that loves them. They have a beautiful and to all appearances perfect life.They attend a Holiday Party at the home of an ultra-rich, ultra-powerful patient of Dr. Tom. While separated, the Devil (disquised as a suave sophisticated older man) asks Nicole to dance and within minutes begins to seduce her and try to get her to go upstairs and have sex with him. The actor who plays this Devil character was perfect. He was slim with a big head full of white hair. He wraps himself around Nicole Kidman like a slinky boa constrictor. She avoids the seduction despite being slightly intoxicated. Yet she does not escape unharmed for he has planted the seed of discord in her mind. She performed well and she would like to be praised for resisting this seduction, but she realizes her husband will never know.Dr. Tom in the meanwhile is tending to the herion overdose of a very high priced prostitute. Laying nude and unconscious, this woman appears to be the apex of earthly beauty. Dr. Tom revives her and treats her with extreme kindness and dignity and handles the entire situation very diplomatically. Again, in mirror image to his wife, he has performed beautifully yet he can't really tell his wife what he has experienced. They both leave the party with secrets they can not share. After smoking a join at home, Allison challenges her husband that he really does not understand the sexual desires of women and he really doesn't know her thoughts and secrets. The Devil has done his work!  Adam is about to be handed the apple! Allison admits that she had a consuming overwhelming sexual fantasy while the family was on Cape Cod based on a military officer she saw eating dinner in a restaurant.Dr. Tom's fall begins here and boy does he fall! He journeys through the night-life of Manhattan but eventually gets caught up in the nest of Devils in their sexual orgy hideaway. His life is in danger and yet a beautiful prostitute saves him and he is allowed to leave. Later he finds that she has died of an overdose. Remember that a sacrifice is required when one falls from Grace, a maxim of every religion.In some ways his journey is like Ullyses trying to make his way home to the waiting Penelope. This is especailly true with the wild encounters he has with Manhattan low-life on his night's journey. He is almost seduced by a street walker who he finds out later has AIDS.He makes his way back to his wife, full of contradictions and uncertainties, but resolved to rejoin with her - to renew the emotional bonds that he lost during his night of journey into dark places.The film ends in a gigantic toy store, a place of renewed innocence, and when Dr. Tom asks Allison where to they go from here, she acknowledges that they move forward together for they were ""lucky"".It is this word ""lucky"" that resolves the story from a theological point of view, for they have been saved by the Grace of God. They don't deserve this gift,they really didn't ask for it, they just struggled in the dark like all human beings. Yet, in the end they are the recipients of this Grace.Stanley Kubrick based this film on Arthur Schnitzler's short novel ""Traumnovelle"", but surely Schnitzler based his novel on the eternal story of Adam and Eve, the fall and the redemption.

If I could review the film on a scene by scene basis, I would give some of the scenes a five star rating. Certain moments such as Tom Cruise's exposure at the orgy or his  confrontation with his host were really well done. Unfortunately scenes  like this were like splendid mechanical objects that are part of a poorly  assembled machine. They may be great, but the apparatus as a whole is a  failure.I'm really not being too harsh here. The first half of many of  Kubrik's films generally start out slow.

The sexual revolution seen retrospectively through a fin-de-siecle Viennese novella?I saw ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in its theatrical release and pretty much hated it. The dialogue is made up mostly of banalities which harkened back to the intentionally non-informational dialogue of ""2001"" (but in that film it a point was being made about man's misuse of tools in general). Also, I thought Kubrick's direction of the actors in EWS terrible: everyone speaks with tremendous pauses, as if every line were fraught with gravity (which of course jars against the aforementioned banality of what they are actually saying). I left thinking ""so what?"" which is not something I've ever associated with Stanley Kubrick...I recently saw it again, and maybe I was a bit tough on Kubrick the first time around (hence bumped up from one star to two). After my redux, there seemed nothing unnatural about the dialogue's pacing--given the weight of the events which happen to Dr. Hartford, whether they are inner fantasies or actually happen to him over such a short period of ""real"" time. The film is beautiful visually, no doubt about it, and you can see the meticulous care of every detail in the framing. And his taste for repeatedly using the same piece of music is here, but with increasingly annoying effect.This is the kind of movie it takes multiple viewings to fully understand (if one can stomach the way Kubrick deliberately made it) and it's probably not worth the investment. It would have been transgressive--had this film been released in the 60s or 70s, say. But 1999? It's like an obsolete and dusty treatise discovered after a revolution has completely transformed a society. I think it would have been a far more powerful film if Kubrick hadn't chosen to digitally obscure the orgiasts (at the least) or made the orgy scene truly shocking, unlike anything we've ever seen before, filling Hartford--and the audience--with a sense of immediate horror and danger, instead of the trick of his being ""threatened"" with physical harm by the revelers.

118627,A388G7Q4E8VG38,079074841X,"Charles H. Harpole ""Charly""","[3, 8]","This is a most confusing and puzzling film by a major director.  I saw it on the big screen in first release (with the black figures inserted to avoid seeing the sex directly) and again yesterday in the unrated home DVD square version.  The unrated version shows naked intercourse between several couples but the action has such exaggerated gyrations as to remind one that these are actors trying to look like they are doing an orgy.There are many problems with the film and hardly worth seeing except as a historical addition to your Kubrick knowledge.  The sex scenes are not worth the effort to obtain them because free Internet amateur porn is much better if that is what you want.Characterizations:  Problem number one is the Doctor Bill character (Cruise)acts like he never had a human psychology course and has only a teenager's idea of adult sexuality.  Thus, he shows no insight into himself nor his wife's fantasies, frustrations, or the natural limits of any marriage.  The wife (Kidman)almost rises above the bored rich housewife role from Sex + City shows, but only whines her way along, again showing no self insight nor even the beginnings of knowledge about human psychology.Plot:  Cloying and toying with viewers titliation of seeing Kidman's great (and total) skin, an ""orgy scene,"" and a blue colored fantasy intercourse scene does not make a great movie.  The orgy scene is a teenager's idea of same and shockingly embarrassing to Kubrick mentality.  The ""forget it"" scene around the pool table really exposes the stupidity of two mature adults...New Yorkers no less... agonizing over what any man of the world would have dismissed.  This is just what some deluded guy thinks the rich do with their spare time.  The ""suspense"" such as it is, subplot... did the girl get killed?... calls for either the police or a confrontation of the stupid emptiness of Dr. Bill's morality.  The plot, in sum, is unbelievable, contrived, and of a teen mentality.This film does not add anything worthy to the issues of upper middle class (and rich) emptiness, sexual boredom/fantasies, or other things falsely claimed for it.  My take is that an old man director wanted to be in charge of a room full of fully naked beautiful women before he took The Big Sleep.

118628,A3N94LNED0IF0R,079074841X,Charles S. Tashiro,"[0, 2]","Among his many abilities, Stanley Kubrick had a knack for polarizing audiences, derived partly from his even greater talent for self-promotion. The controversy surrounding EWS resulted almost completely from people being led to expect something (perhaps an expensive, big name porn film) that it clearly does not provide. To the extent his promotional strategy encouraged these expectations, Kubrick bears some responsibility for the hostile reactions the film received. I saw it in its initial theatrical release with a group of about eight people. Most were unsympathetic, to say the least, but then at least a couple of us loved every minute of it.I think the gist of the problem is that &quot;nothing happens&quot; in the film. That lack of action is also the film's chief virtue, however, since it means that the focus is on mood, texture and feeling. Kubrick was almost alone among mainstream American filmmakers in his interest in and occasional theft from the filmmaking avant garde. (The special effects in &quot;2001&quot; for example, notoriously borrowed heavily from the work of experimental filmmaker Jordan Belson.) Here he clearly owes a debt to such &quot;structuralist&quot; filmmakers as Michael Snow and Jean-Marie Straub, in which the length of the shot, its inexorable refusal to move along at standard cinematic pace, becomes an integral part of the film's effect and meaning.Not that EWS is an arty, avant garde film. Kubrick simply learned lessons from such filmmakers and applied them to a standard narrative. The resulting mood-as-meaning will delight those of us interested in seeing films that explore the medium's formal potential, but make most viewers itch to keep moving. To say EWS is an old-man's film is, in this context, the highest praise. Every moment testifies to the director's absolute control, his fanatical, obsessive insistence on a technical perfection that only an extremely talented artist at the end of his career could accomplish.EWS is by no means for everyone. Not only action film fans will be disappointed. People expecting an in-depth evaluation of a marriage in crisis will also probably be put off, since the subject is really secondary to the formal brilliance with which it is expressed. It is not in any sense a &quot;deep&quot; film, except in the one way that matters: it expresses an utterly singular vision with no respect for pre-conceptions, only an insistence that the film has to be made, the way the director believes it should. I suspect that for this reason, EWS will eventually be recognized as Kubrick's greatest film, after &quot;2001&quot; and possibly &quot;The Shining.&quot;One final note: let's give Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman credit, not just for having the courage to make this film at all, but for their defense of it after Kubrick's death. In today's Hollywood, stars usually care only about whether a film will help their careers. Their determination that EWS be released in the manner Kubrick intended deserves our praise and thanks.",4,A Fond Farewell,1006300800,"11 21, 2001",2001,3020,"['many', 'abilities', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'knack', 'polarizing', 'audiences', 'derived', 'partly', 'even', 'greater', 'talent', 'self-promotion', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'EWS', 'resulted', 'almost', 'completely', 'people', 'being', 'led', 'expect', 'something', 'perhaps', 'expensive', 'big', 'name', 'porn', 'film', 'clearly', 'not', 'provide', 'extent', 'promotional', 'strategy', 'encouraged', 'expectations', 'Kubrick', 'responsibility', 'hostile', 'reactions', 'film', 'received', 'saw', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'group', 'about', 'eight', 'people', 'Most', 'were', 'unsympathetic', 'say', 'least', 'then', 'least', 'couple', 'loved', 'minute', 'it.I', 'think', 'gist', 'problem', 'quot', 'nothing', 'quot', 'film', 'lack', 'action', 'also', 'film', 'chief', 'virtue', 'however', 'focus', 'mood', 'texture', 'feeling', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'almost', 'alone', 'mainstream', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'interest', 'occasional', 'theft', 'filmmaking', 'avant', 'garde', 'special', 'effects', 'quot', '2001', 'quot', 'example', 'notoriously', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'work', 'experimental', 'filmmaker', 'Jordan', 'Belson', 'Here', 'clearly', 'debt', 'such', 'quot', 'structuralist', 'quot', 'filmmakers', 'Michael', 'Snow', 'Jean-Marie', 'Straub', 'length', 'shot', 'inexorable', 'refusal', 'move', 'along', 'standard', 'cinematic', 'pace', 'integral', 'part', 'film', 'effect', 'meaning.Not', 'EWS', 'arty', 'avant', 'garde', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'simply', 'learned', 'lessons', 'such', 'filmmakers', 'applied', 'standard', 'narrative', 'resulting', 'mood-as-meaning', 'will', 'delight', 'interested', 'seeing', 'films', 'explore', 'medium', 'formal', 'potential', 'make', 'most', 'viewers', 'itch', 'keep', 'moving', 'say', 'EWS', 'old-man', 'film', 'context', 'highest', 'praise', 'moment', 'director', 'absolute', 'control', 'fanatical', 'obsessive', 'insistence', 'technical', 'perfection', 'only', 'extremely', 'talented', 'artist', 'end', 'career', 'could', 'accomplish.EWS', 'means', 'everyone', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'People', 'expecting', 'in-depth', 'evaluation', 'marriage', 'crisis', 'will', 'also', 'probably', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'subject', 'really', 'secondary', 'formal', 'brilliance', 'expressed', 'not', 'sense', 'quot', 'deep', 'quot', 'film', 'one', 'way', 'matters', 'utterly', 'singular', 'vision', 'respect', 'pre-conceptions', 'only', 'insistence', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'way', 'director', 'should', 'suspect', 'reason', 'EWS', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'recognized', 'Kubrick', 'greatest', 'film', 'quot', '2001', 'quot', 'possibly', 'quot', 'Shining.', 'quot', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'let', 'give', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'credit', 'not', 'just', 'having', 'courage', 'make', 'film', 'defense', 'Kubrick', 'death', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'care', 'only', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'careers', 'determination', 'EWS', 'be', 'released', 'manner', 'Kubrick', 'intended', 'praise', 'thanks']",N/A

In addition to that there was ""Eyes Wide Shut"", the latest film by influential director Stanley Kubrick, his first in 12 years and would end up being his final film. It of course got massive hype: from the fact he was finally making something new, to the star power of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to its long shoot (400 days), excitement was huge and it can be fair to say disappointment was bigger. It's a fine film sure but it might not be everyone's idea of Kubrick's last hurrah.Bill and Alice Harford are a married couple of 9 years with a 7 year old daughter, Helena. Attending a party at a friend's place, the 2 of them separate and start to flirt with partygoers looking for a more intimate setting. They both decline and the next day, Alice reveals a truth: a one night stand she desperately wanted to have happen a year earlier that she didn't act on. This sends Bill on a journey through the streets of New York and exploring that possibility of being with someone that's not his wife but what he discovers is potentially more dangerous than just infidelity.The advertising made you believe that you were getting into some completely raunchy and X-rated with sex scenes and nudity running rampant. Turns out most of the nudity isn't played in scenes of sexual nature but just natural part of life and one's body. As for the sex, well, it looks explicity but you've probably seen worse. With this much press and speculation, you can practically see the audience's eyes giving a sense of shock; ""that's it?"" on their minds once the film's over. It's a slow, deliberately paced film with many characters chatting to each other with nary a mind-warping ""Star Child"" sequence or a hyper-edited sex scene to the William Tell Overture. This makes it more dreamlike but people might find it boring.With a star like Cruise in the lead role, some might find it distracting. He's gotten to that ""superstar"" level of acting where people see him less as an actor and more like a celebrity who just so happens to be an actor. While there is moments that seem ""Cruise-y"" in the film, it happens to be one of his more layered characters, along with Frank Mackey from ""Magnolia"". But it's Kidman who probably has the more interesting role to play since by the end of the film, you still can't get a handle on just what exactly this characters wants and whether what she says is the real thing. But this is the Bill show as we spend more time with him than Alice which is kind of a shame.Although it may not have that must-have status that a lot of Kubrick films have, don't think that it's a bad film because of it. It may not please everyone but it's at least a fine film on its own and a strange but fitting end to a long career.",4,Influential filmmaker's final film...,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2952,"['1999', 'was', 'pretty', 'big', 'year', 'movies', 'groundbreaking', 'effects', 'Matrix', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', '16', 'years', 'was', 'quite', 'eventful', 'year', 'addition', 'was', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'latest', 'film', 'influential', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'first', '12', 'years', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'final', 'film', 'course', 'got', 'massive', 'hype', 'fact', 'was', 'finally', 'making', 'something', 'new', 'star', 'power', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'long', 'shoot', '400', 'days', 'excitement', 'was', 'huge', 'can', 'be', 'fair', 'say', 'disappointment', 'was', 'bigger', 'fine', 'film', 'sure', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'idea', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'hurrah.Bill', 'Alice', 'Harford', 'are', 'married', 'couple', '9', 'years', '7', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Helena', 'Attending', 'party', 'friend', 'place', '2', 'separate', 'start', 'flirt', 'partygoers', 'looking', 'more', 'intimate', 'setting', 'decline', 'next', 'day', 'Alice', 'truth', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'have', 'happen', 'year', 'earlier', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'Bill', 'journey', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'exploring', 'possibility', 'being', 'someone', 'not', 'wife', 'what', 'potentially', 'more', 'dangerous', 'just', 'infidelity.The', 'advertising', 'made', 'believe', 'were', 'getting', 'completely', 'raunchy', 'X-rated', 'sex', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'running', 'rampant', 'out', 'most', 'nudity', ""n't"", 'played', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'nature', 'just', 'natural', 'part', 'life', 'one', 'body', 'sex', 'well', 'explicity', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'worse', 'much', 'press', 'speculation', 'can', 'practically', 'see', 'audience', 'eyes', 'giving', 'sense', 'shock', 'minds', 'once', 'film', 'slow', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'film', 'many', 'characters', 'chatting', 'other', 'nary', 'mind-warping', 'Star', 'Child', 'sequence', 'hyper-edited', 'sex', 'scene', 'William', 'Tell', 'Overture', 'more', 'dreamlike', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'boring.With', 'star', 'Cruise', 'lead', 'role', 'might', 'find', 'distracting', 'gotten', 'superstar', 'level', 'acting', 'where', 'people', 'see', 'actor', 'more', 'celebrity', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'actor', 'moments', 'seem', 'Cruise-y', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'layered', 'characters', 'Frank', 'Mackey', 'Magnolia', 'Kidman', 'who', 'probably', 'more', 'interesting', 'role', 'play', 'end', 'film', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'handle', 'just', 'what', 'exactly', 'characters', 'what', 'real', 'thing', 'Bill', 'show', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'Alice', 'kind', 'shame.Although', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'must-have', 'status', 'lot', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'please', 'everyone', 'least', 'fine', 'film', 'own', 'strange', 'fitting', 'end', 'long', 'career']",N/A

Todaro ""chazzt""","[7, 10]","I've read all the reviews, and have found Roger Ebert's very interesting.But I see parallels to the greek tragedy of Ulysses as told in the Odyssey.To me, this is a cautionary tale of the nightmarish scenarios possible when people fail to just go home. To be where they belong and to realize what they don't belong doing.Ulysses on an unnecessary raid at the end of the Trojan war blinds the eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes, infuriating the god Neptune, who refuses to permit Ulysses to return home to Ithaca. And so begins the Odyssey of Ulysses.When you watch Tom Cruise's character in this movie spend two nights wandering in the sexual underworld of New York City, you watch a Sexual Odyssey emerge like a daydream about possibilites missed, the opportunity to jump off avoided and responsibilites shunned. You realize at any moment here he can head home and face up to his realities, but he plunges deeper into a nightmarish dream. Or is it?After visiting one of his patients, Dr. Bill Harford can just go home to his wife and family and face the facts that his wife shared with him (while high from marijuana) a sexual fantasy she had experienced a year earlier. But he can't. He seems haunted by her revelations. And jealous.

118639,A2SJ11EMIOBLHH,079074841X,Cwn_Annwn,"[6, 22]","This was marketed to the masses as an opportunity to see Nicole Kidman naked. It was also an attempt to dispell all the gay rumors about Tom Cruise by putting him in sex scenes which ended up backfiring on them because those scenes were pretty flat as far as being ""hot"" so it just added fuel to Tom Cruise is gay fire. Even though I would imagine that he probably really is a homosexual I have to be fair to Cruise and say that Kidman doesn't exactly get the flames of lust going for me, she's a beautiful woman no doubt about that, but there is just something cold and icy about her. So you have to consider what he had to work with.There were also a lot of conspiracy theories and speculation about this film, which is the real reason it interested me. Three days after Stanley Kubrick turned over the final cut of Eyes Wide Shut over to the movie studio the thought to be perfectly healthy Kubrick turned up dead. People in his family initially said that they believed there was foul play involved and then shortly thereafter they mysteriously clammed up on the subject. If you've seen the movie then you know that the story is an overlap of the relationship between Cruise and Kidmans characters, and Secret Societies of the wealthy and well to do. The theory that many have is that Kubrick let out too much about how these groups operate in Eyes Wide Shut and was murdered for it. It is known that the studio totally redited and recut the movie after Kubricks death before they released it. Most of these filmmakers are agents and propagandists for the ""illuminated"" ones or powers that be or whatever you care to call them so they all are privy to secrets and modus operandi of those people. There is lots of occultic symbology in Kubricks past films. Especially 2001: A Space Odyssey, just find a copy of Bill Coopers radio show where he pointed out the occultic symbology in 2001. But I did see some of that stuff in Eyes Wide Shut, but not as much as one would have thought, which is probably due to the editing process that took place after Kubricks death. There is some symbology that were placed in the backdrops of certain scenes and more than that there was some very cryptic meanings you might be able to decipher out of some of the dialogue that had me raising an eyebrow but I don't know that this is what would have gotten Kubrick killed. I think it has more to do with how he showed how these secret socieities operate. Especially using sexual and other types of blackmail on people how they set people up and how people turn up dead of ""overdoses"" and ""accidents"" if they know too much or are thought to be possibly spilling the beans on certain information. Its actually pretty creepy that this was a focal point of the story when you consider what happened to Kubrick.A few other random thoughts of mine are both Kidman and Cruise are both under heavy mind control in real life through the ""Church"" of Scientology. The scene where a masked Cruise sneaks into the secret societies ritual is great. So was the music that was used throughout the movie. The scene where Kidman picks an argument with Cruise is unrealistic because that is not how anybody who is getting paranoid on pot acts. It does fit the behavior of a few nasty drunks I've encountered though.  Also to give some random Cruise information he is originally from my old hometown of Louisville Kentucky. His real name is Mapother. They are known as an ""old money"" family around Louisville. There are few well known attorneys and at least one Judge in this family. As far as I know Cruise never comes back to Louisville or has any interest in returning. After spending most of my life there I can relate to that entirley.",5,Eyes Wide Shut,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,3705,"['was', 'marketed', 'masses', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'naked', 'was', 'also', 'attempt', 'dispell', 'gay', 'rumors', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'putting', 'sex', 'scenes', 'ended', 'up', 'backfiring', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'flat', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'hot', 'just', 'added', 'fuel', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'gay', 'fire', 'Even', 'would', 'imagine', 'probably', 'really', 'homosexual', 'have', 'be', 'fair', 'Cruise', 'say', 'Kidman', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'get', 'flames', 'lust', 'going', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'doubt', 'just', 'something', 'cold', 'icy', 'have', 'consider', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'with.There', 'were', 'also', 'lot', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'speculation', 'film', 'real', 'reason', 'interested', 'Three', 'days', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'turned', 'over', 'final', 'cut', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'movie', 'studio', 'thought', 'be', 'perfectly', 'healthy', 'Kubrick', 'turned', 'up', 'dead', 'People', 'family', 'initially', 'said', 'believed', 'was', 'foul', 'play', 'involved', 'then', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'mysteriously', 'clammed', 'up', 'subject', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'know', 'story', 'overlap', 'relationship', 'Cruise', 'Kidmans', 'characters', 'Secret', 'Societies', 'wealthy', 'well', 'do', 'theory', 'many', 'have', 'Kubrick', 'let', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'groups', 'operate', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'was', 'murdered', 'known', 'studio', 'totally', 'redited', 'recut', 'movie', 'Kubricks', 'death', 'released', 'Most', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'agents', 'propagandists', 'illuminated', 'ones', 'powers', 'be', 'care', 'call', 'are', 'privy', 'secrets', 'modus', 'operandi', 'people', 'lots', 'occultic', 'symbology', 'Kubricks', 'past', 'films', 'Especially', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'just', 'find', 'copy', 'Bill', 'Coopers', 'radio', 'show', 'where', 'pointed', 'out', 'occultic', 'symbology', '2001', 'did', 'see', 'stuff', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'probably', 'due', 'editing', 'process', 'took', 'place', 'Kubricks', 'death', 'symbology', 'were', 'placed', 'backdrops', 'certain', 'scenes', 'more', 'was', 'very', 'cryptic', 'meanings', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'decipher', 'dialogue', 'had', 'raising', 'eyebrow', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'Kubrick', 'killed', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'how', 'showed', 'how', 'secret', 'socieities', 'operate', 'Especially', 'using', 'sexual', 'other', 'types', 'blackmail', 'people', 'how', 'set', 'people', 'up', 'how', 'people', 'turn', 'up', 'dead', 'overdoses', 'accidents', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'thought', 'be', 'possibly', 'spilling', 'beans', 'certain', 'information', 'actually', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'was', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'happened', 'Kubrick.A', 'few', 'other', 'random', 'thoughts', 'mine', 'are', 'Kidman', 'Cruise', 'are', 'heavy', 'mind', 'control', 'real', 'life', 'Church', 'Scientology', 'scene', 'where', 'masked', 'Cruise', 'sneaks', 'secret', 'societies', 'ritual', 'great', 'So', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'Kidman', 'argument', 'Cruise', 'unrealistic', 'not', 'how', 'anybody', 'who', 'getting', 'paranoid', 'pot', 'acts', 'fit', 'behavior', 'few', 'nasty', 'drunks', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'Also', 'give', 'random', 'Cruise', 'information', 'originally', 'old', 'hometown', 'Louisville', 'Kentucky', 'real', 'name', 'Mapother', 'are', 'known', 'old', 'money', 'family', 'Louisville', 'are', 'few', 'well', 'known', 'attorneys', 'least', 'one', 'Judge', 'family', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'Cruise', 'never', 'back', 'Louisville', 'interest', 'returning', 'spending', 'most', 'life', 'there', 'can', 'relate', 'entirley']",N/A
118640,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,079074841X,Dai-keag-ity,"[3, 3]","Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999 after Stanley Kubrick's death, and was misrepresented by well-meaning but misguided publicists as something resembling a non-stop orgy of sex, which it's simply not. If anything this mysterious film is the epitome of non-eroticism. So what is it? It is a somewhat quiet film about a human being suddenly cast into a self-authored but barely understood quest. It is about jealousy, sexual exploration, insecurity, love, lust, danger, and ultimately redemption and forgiveness. The sets Kubrick had designed and created, as he did in so many of his previous films, are astonishing in their scale and intricacy, and the soundtrack, such as it exists in this whisperingly still movie, hit exactly the right notes at the right moments, especially Jocelyn Pook's soul-stirring composition for the Black Mass scene at the exact center of this story. Eyes Wide Shut walks a thin line between metaphor and reality, wishful fantasy and actual happenings. How much of this story is real and how much takes place in the imagination of its central character, here played with unusual depth by Tom Cruise? I fall into the ""it all happened"" camp but I can certainly see how the reverse might be true.In Eyes Wide Shut, a handsome, successful young doctor, Bill Harford, finds the security of his comfortable life thrown askew when in the wake of a Christmas party in which he and his wife, played by Nicole Kidman, both interacted with strangers in a light, flirtatious manner, his wife reveals to him how close she once came to having an affair with a Naval officer. What follows next takes place primarily in the course of a single dream-like night as Harford leaves home to go to the deathbed of a long-time patient, and then rapidly plummets into a strange world of sexual promise and danger. Harford has a patient throw herself at him (no other description fits), encounters an attractive prostitute and allows himself to return---to an unforeseen outcome---with her to her flat, then he persuades an old friend, an itinerate musician, to let him to infiltrate a party at a lavish estate in the country, where the masked guests, presumably among New York's society elite, engage in unabashed sex acts amidst a setting reminiscent of the orgies of centuries past.In the aftermath of this life-altering night, Harford's self-confidence, in fact his very identity, is shaken to the core. He feels he has become embroiled in what was possibly a murder, for which he is to blame.  Far from being the confident, wealthy physician from the opening quarter of the movie, Harford is a desperate man who seeks out answers, all the while clearly terrified of the enlightenment those answers might bring. The soft world of the night becomes a harsh labyrinth of confusion as we again trail Harford, this time out into the daylight, where we share his desires to know more. Ultimately we must accept, as does Harford, the only answers he receives, satisfactory or not, and are glad when he embraces the closure he is given by both a friend and more unexpectedly, by his wife.Eyes Wide Shut is imperfect. A few of the acting performances fall short, and the spark of romance seems lacking between Cruise and Kidman (real life provided the answers for why) but when taken as a whole, this story, these visuals, the music, the intricate display of mastery of craft that is here in Eyes Wide Shut, all this combines to be a five-star production, and it is almost an all-time motion picture masterpiece.",5,Kubrick Goes Out With A Near Masterpiece,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3511,"['Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'death', 'was', 'misrepresented', 'well-meaning', 'misguided', 'publicists', 'something', 'resembling', 'non-stop', 'orgy', 'sex', 'simply', 'not', 'anything', 'mysterious', 'film', 'epitome', 'non-eroticism', 'what', 'somewhat', 'quiet', 'film', 'human', 'being', 'suddenly', 'cast', 'self-authored', 'barely', 'understood', 'quest', 'jealousy', 'sexual', 'exploration', 'insecurity', 'love', 'lust', 'danger', 'ultimately', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'sets', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'designed', 'created', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'films', 'are', 'astonishing', 'scale', 'intricacy', 'soundtrack', 'such', 'whisperingly', 'still', 'movie', 'hit', 'exactly', 'right', 'notes', 'right', 'moments', 'especially', 'Jocelyn', 'Pook', 'soul-stirring', 'composition', 'Black', 'Mass', 'scene', 'exact', 'center', 'story', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'thin', 'line', 'metaphor', 'reality', 'wishful', 'fantasy', 'actual', 'happenings', 'How', 'much', 'story', 'real', 'how', 'much', 'place', 'imagination', 'central', 'character', 'here', 'played', 'unusual', 'depth', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fall', 'happened', 'camp', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'how', 'reverse', 'might', 'be', 'true.In', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'handsome', 'successful', 'young', 'doctor', 'Bill', 'Harford', 'security', 'comfortable', 'life', 'thrown', 'askew', 'when', 'wake', 'Christmas', 'party', 'wife', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'interacted', 'strangers', 'light', 'flirtatious', 'manner', 'wife', 'reveals', 'how', 'close', 'once', 'came', 'having', 'affair', 'Naval', 'officer', 'What', 'next', 'place', 'primarily', 'course', 'single', 'dream-like', 'night', 'Harford', 'home', 'go', 'deathbed', 'long-time', 'patient', 'then', 'rapidly', 'strange', 'world', 'sexual', 'promise', 'danger', 'Harford', 'patient', 'throw', 'other', 'description', 'fits', 'attractive', 'prostitute', 'return', '-to', 'unforeseen', 'outcome', 'flat', 'then', 'old', 'friend', 'itinerate', 'musician', 'let', 'infiltrate', 'party', 'lavish', 'estate', 'country', 'where', 'masked', 'guests', 'presumably', 'New', 'York', 'society', 'elite', 'engage', 'unabashed', 'sex', 'amidst', 'setting', 'reminiscent', 'orgies', 'centuries', 'past.In', 'aftermath', 'life-altering', 'night', 'Harford', 'self-confidence', 'fact', 'very', 'identity', 'shaken', 'core', 'become', 'embroiled', 'what', 'was', 'possibly', 'murder', 'blame', 'Far', 'being', 'confident', 'wealthy', 'physician', 'opening', 'quarter', 'movie', 'Harford', 'desperate', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'answers', 'while', 'clearly', 'terrified', 'enlightenment', 'answers', 'might', 'bring', 'soft', 'world', 'night', 'harsh', 'labyrinth', 'confusion', 'again', 'trail', 'Harford', 'time', 'out', 'daylight', 'where', 'share', 'desires', 'know', 'more', 'Ultimately', 'must', 'accept', 'Harford', 'only', 'answers', 'satisfactory', 'not', 'are', 'glad', 'when', 'closure', 'given', 'friend', 'more', 'unexpectedly', 'wife.Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'imperfect', 'few', 'acting', 'performances', 'fall', 'short', 'spark', 'romance', 'lacking', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'real', 'life', 'provided', 'answers', 'why', 'when', 'taken', 'whole', 'story', 'visuals', 'music', 'intricate', 'display', 'mastery', 'craft', 'here', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'combines', 'be', 'five-star', 'production', 'almost', 'all-time', 'motion', 'picture', 'masterpiece']",N/A

But his untimely death before the film's theatrical release also raises the  intriguing question of how different this film would have been had Kubrick  lived to make final adjustments, as he was wont to do with each of his  films.While we were left with no answer to that question, we were left  with a psychologically stirring dream epic which is all Kubrick, rough cut  or not: the gorgeous sets, the luscious photography, the luminous lighting,  the bold colors, the deliberate acting -- the movie is so Kubrick that  Kubrick tends to overwhelm everything else, including the story and its  characters, which leads to its major faults.Cruise and Kidman are a  sexually dysfunctional couple who drift further apart when the wife  confesses to having sexual fantasies and dreams about other men, even at  the expense (in her dreams) of sexually humiliating the husband.

In his journey he meets some normal and bizarre characters  and rashly crashes a secret event, a decision he soon regrets and which  starts him on a slippery slide into paranoia.Although there are plot  holes and illogical events in several places (which may be attributed to  the dream tone of the entire film), the execution by this master is  exhilarating and hypnotic, making his last film a cinematic delight and one  which may warrant subsequent visits to mine all of its riches.",3,A master's swan song.,958262400,"05 14, 2000",2000,1750,"['Kubrick', 'mysterious', 'compelling', 'swan', 'song', 'reinforces', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'fact', 'was', 'cinematic', 'giant', 'complete', 'control', 'art', 'untimely', 'death', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'also', 'intriguing', 'question', 'how', 'different', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Kubrick', 'lived', 'make', 'final', 'adjustments', 'was', 'wont', 'do', 'films.While', 'were', 'left', 'answer', 'question', 'were', 'left', 'psychologically', 'stirring', 'dream', 'epic', 'Kubrick', 'rough', 'cut', 'not', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'luscious', 'photography', 'luminous', 'lighting', 'bold', 'colors', 'deliberate', 'acting', 'movie', 'so', 'Kubrick', 'Kubrick', 'overwhelm', 'everything', 'else', 'including', 'story', 'characters', 'major', 'faults.Cruise', 'Kidman', 'are', 'sexually', 'dysfunctional', 'couple', 'who', 'further', 'apart', 'when', 'wife', 'having', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'dreams', 'other', 'men', 'even', 'expense', 'dreams', 'sexually', 'humiliating', 'husband', 'husband', 'two-night', 'journey', 'dark', 'recesses', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'really', 'London', 'trying', 'look', 'awfully', 'hard', 'NYC', 'point', 'distraction', 'gimmick', 'where', 'yellow', 'cab', 'seen', 'nearly', 'outside', 'shot', 'journey', 'normal', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'rashly', 'crashes', 'secret', 'event', 'decision', 'soon', 'regrets', 'slippery', 'slide', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'illogical', 'events', 'several', 'places', 'may', 'be', 'attributed', 'dream', 'tone', 'entire', 'film', 'execution', 'master', 'exhilarating', 'hypnotic', 'making', 'last', 'film', 'cinematic', 'delight', 'one', 'may', 'warrant', 'subsequent', 'visits', 'mine', 'riches']",N/A

Fincke ""thegreatfandincke""","[2, 2]","I guess I should begin with the obligatory apologetic statement that the film is usually misunderstood and held to such superficial and prudish standards of such evident immaturity and shallowness of thinking that its misunderstanders should be embarrassed by themselves.With that done.  I do understand that many will not like this film.  Complaints that it is lurid seem quite knee-jerk given the immense amount of taste with which the film was shot.  The orgy seen in this film had none of the gratuities of 10 minutes of the average TV sitcom's dialogue.  America's prudishness about the naked body is ironic given the excess of foul and flippant discourse about sex which seeps into every corner of the media.This movie takes sex seriously not gratuitously and explores people's emotions rather than trivializing them.  This film is not an instance of the degredation of our culture or an exploitation of our sexual drives and pleasures like MOST of the media's irresponsible abuse of these parts of ourselves but rather it is a probing exploration of the ways that people deal with their fantasies and their realities.  This movie brings to life, steadily and shockingly, modes of thought and types of experience.  If only more films could capture the sense of obsession, the motivations towards recklessness, the perversities and the pleasures of fantasies, the selfishnesses of sex and of love, and the struggle to maintain connections with other human beings inspite of these things all in two and a half hours!No, this movie is neither lurid, gratuitous, propogandist, nor exploitive in dealing with issues related to sex.  It does not promote infidelity, orgies, prostitution, cultic rituals, voyeurism, exhibitionism, pedophilia, or fetishism, or any other such thing.  If anything this movie, plays off the audience's sexual interests in its stars and in its plot and visuals in order to grip it in empathy, that one can feel as nervous, tempted, disturbed, haunted, fearful, turned on and turned off as the characters.  Finally the psychology of almost-recklessness and the fascinating play of appearances and realities are worth the price of viewing.The music in the film is in turns expertly selected by Kubrick and magnificently written by Jocelyn Pook.  The only regrettability on this score is that some of the jazz pieces did not make it on the otherwise top-to-bottom delightful soundtrack---but that is for another review.As to complaints about length...  I thought the film was perfectly paced for one viewing but is too long to keep much of its effectiveness on subsequent viewings.  Knowing how things wind up takes much of the psychological compulsion and sting out of the film.Cruise is good in this role, as with all his others, he plays it by being himself and fitting the prescription just right.  Kidman is so very real, giving a role that's powerful through both overstatement and understatement.  She's quite the marvelous actress.I am no judge of where this film fits in the Kubrick corpus, having seen quite little of it.",5,"Gripping, Manages To Get Inside The Head",992649600,"06 16, 2001",2001,3056,"['guess', 'should', 'begin', 'obligatory', 'apologetic', 'statement', 'film', 'usually', 'misunderstood', 'held', 'such', 'superficial', 'prudish', 'standards', 'such', 'evident', 'immaturity', 'shallowness', 'thinking', 'misunderstanders', 'should', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'themselves.With', 'done', 'do', 'understand', 'many', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'Complaints', 'lurid', 'seem', 'quite', 'knee-jerk', 'given', 'immense', 'amount', 'taste', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'orgy', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'none', 'gratuities', '10', 'minutes', 'average', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'dialogue', 'America', 'prudishness', 'naked', 'body', 'ironic', 'given', 'excess', 'foul', 'flippant', 'discourse', 'sex', 'corner', 'media.This', 'movie', 'sex', 'seriously', 'not', 'gratuitously', 'people', 'emotions', 'rather', 'trivializing', 'film', 'not', 'instance', 'degredation', 'culture', 'exploitation', 'sexual', 'drives', 'pleasures', 'MOST', 'media', 'irresponsible', 'abuse', 'parts', 'ourselves', 'rather', 'probing', 'exploration', 'ways', 'people', 'deal', 'fantasies', 'realities', 'movie', 'life', 'steadily', 'shockingly', 'modes', 'thought', 'types', 'experience', 'only', 'more', 'films', 'could', 'capture', 'sense', 'obsession', 'motivations', 'towards', 'recklessness', 'perversities', 'pleasures', 'fantasies', 'selfishnesses', 'sex', 'love', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'connections', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'inspite', 'things', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'No', 'movie', 'lurid', 'gratuitous', 'propogandist', 'exploitive', 'dealing', 'issues', 'related', 'sex', 'not', 'promote', 'infidelity', 'orgies', 'prostitution', 'cultic', 'rituals', 'voyeurism', 'exhibitionism', 'pedophilia', 'fetishism', 'other', 'such', 'thing', 'anything', 'movie', 'audience', 'sexual', 'interests', 'stars', 'plot', 'visuals', 'order', 'grip', 'empathy', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'nervous', 'tempted', 'disturbed', 'haunted', 'fearful', 'turned', 'turned', 'off', 'characters', 'Finally', 'psychology', 'almost-recklessness', 'fascinating', 'play', 'appearances', 'realities', 'are', 'price', 'viewing.The', 'music', 'film', 'turns', 'expertly', 'selected', 'Kubrick', 'magnificently', 'written', 'Jocelyn', 'Pook', 'only', 'regrettability', 'score', 'jazz', 'pieces', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'otherwise', 'top-to-bottom', 'delightful', 'soundtrack', '-but', 'review.As', 'complaints', 'length', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'one', 'viewing', 'too', 'long', 'keep', 'much', 'effectiveness', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'Knowing', 'how', 'things', 'wind', 'up', 'much', 'psychological', 'compulsion', 'sting', 'film.Cruise', 'good', 'role', 'others', 'being', 'fitting', 'prescription', 'just', 'right', 'Kidman', 'so', 'very', 'real', 'giving', 'role', 'powerful', 'overstatement', 'understatement', 'quite', 'marvelous', 'actress.I', 'am', 'judge', 'where', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'corpus', 'having', 'seen', 'quite', 'little']",N/A
118645,A3A7CBLO6JGY4F,079074841X,"Daniel Garris ""YoSoyTylerDurden""","[13, 15]","The following is an outline of my reading of Eyes Wide Shut.I don't know if I'd say that Eyes Wide Shut takes place in a dream state, but rather that it blurs the line between reality and projection (in the Freudian sense).  Its not so much that the events in the film are not actually happening, but that Kubrick has put images on film that have to be read as questionable with regard to their true ""reality"" as they are skewed through the POV of Bill (and on a lesser scale, Alice) to extreme extents throughout.Granted its Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, but does everyone that each character meets truly want to sleep with them at first glance?  Or instead, are these just the projections of each character's own narcissism onto the people they come across?  Or at the end of the day is it a little of both?  For Alice, it appears to be a type of projection that she ultimately finds disgust with.  She believes that both the man at the party and the man in her flashback want to sleep with her because deep down inside she wants to sleep with them too.  Again maybe they did (more likely in the case of the man at the party) and again maybe they didn't (more likely in the case of the man in her story).  Then there is her reaction to her dream that parallels Bill's experience.  At the end of the day (while she still may want to do it) she seems disgusted by such events/desires/projections, but at the same time doesn't hide the fact as much as Bill that such desires exist.In the case of Bill, the events/desires/projections dive into territory that is far more taboo (prostitutes, underage girls, orgies, potential lovers already in a relationship, etc., etc.), and while ""like"" may be too strong of a word, I think its clear that on at least some level he is excited by such possibilities (as well as much more secretive about them).  The orgy scares Bill too, but for much more different reasons than it does Alice.  The orgy and the aftermath of it are especially important, in that it builds upon this groundwork of projection as a central theme within the film in a different area.  Is the prostitute really killed, are people really after him and the Piano player, or is there a strong chance that it too is mostly just in his head?  Does Alice really suspect anything sexual just because she found a mask, does Bill just assume that she assumes something sexual because she found the mask, or maybe the mask isn't even really there, but rather just Bill's own projection that he thinks she knows something's up?At the same time, Kubrick doesn't seem to be simply diving into this territory for kicks and giggles, but he also uses it to honor the institution of marriage.  From his POV, marriage protects each partner from the taboos of/releated to sex that can be read as ""dangers;"" STDs, drugs, prostitution, ruining families (both your own and your lover's), pedophile, etc., etc.  Given Kubrick's detached personality, yet extreme closeness to his family I think its clear to see where he was coming  from and why he decided to make this film.  Furthermore, in going back to the beginning, in addition to protecting one another from these outside dangers, it is also the institution of marriage that helps protect each partner from the inside dangers of their own egos by keeping them in check as a result of the various sacrifices that are made in marriage (as well as in any relationship in general).  Its not so much these statements themselves that are unique, (its basically just Psychoanalysis 101), but that Kubrick is able to present such statements through a much more interesting and powerful process; a process that is largely visual, and through a script that doesn't really directly deal with such subjects at face value.Finally, I think this is Kubrick's most emotional film of his career.  While I love many of his films, I don't think there's much of a question that he's very detached from most of the commentary he makes in them.  I think its a different case here.  There is still that detachment, but I think his own emotion creeps out of that detachment as well.  Whether or not you agree/like what the film has to say, the more you experience it, the more you can appreciate just how much it likely meant to him.For Dorothy the Rainbow is all and her head.  I think the same goes for Bill, Alice and Stanley.****, (10/10)",5,Eyes Wide Shut: My Thoughts 5 Years Later,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,4361,"['following', 'outline', 'reading', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'say', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'place', 'dream', 'state', 'rather', 'line', 'reality', 'projection', 'Freudian', 'sense', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'happening', 'Kubrick', 'put', 'images', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'read', 'questionable', 'regard', 'true', 'reality', 'are', 'skewed', 'POV', 'Bill', 'lesser', 'scale', 'Alice', 'extreme', 'extents', 'throughout.Granted', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'everyone', 'character', 'meets', 'truly', 'want', 'sleep', 'first', 'glance', 'instead', 'are', 'just', 'projections', 'character', 'own', 'narcissism', 'people', 'come', 'end', 'day', 'little', 'Alice', 'be', 'type', 'projection', 'ultimately', 'disgust', 'man', 'party', 'man', 'flashback', 'want', 'sleep', 'deep', 'down', 'sleep', 'too', 'Again', 'maybe', 'did', 'more', 'likely', 'case', 'man', 'party', 'again', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'more', 'likely', 'case', 'man', 'story', 'Then', 'reaction', 'dream', 'Bill', 'experience', 'end', 'day', 'still', 'may', 'want', 'do', 'disgusted', 'such', 'events/desires/projections', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'as', 'much', 'Bill', 'such', 'desires', 'exist.In', 'case', 'Bill', 'events/desires/projections', 'dive', 'territory', 'far', 'more', 'taboo', 'prostitutes', 'underage', 'girls', 'orgies', 'potential', 'lovers', 'already', 'relationship', 'etc.', 'etc', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'word', 'think', 'clear', 'least', 'level', 'excited', 'such', 'possibilities', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'more', 'secretive', 'orgy', 'scares', 'Bill', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'different', 'reasons', 'Alice', 'orgy', 'aftermath', 'are', 'especially', 'important', 'groundwork', 'projection', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'different', 'area', 'prostitute', 'really', 'killed', 'are', 'people', 'really', 'Piano', 'player', 'there', 'strong', 'chance', 'too', 'mostly', 'just', 'head', 'Does', 'Alice', 'really', 'suspect', 'anything', 'sexual', 'just', 'found', 'mask', 'Bill', 'just', 'assume', 'something', 'sexual', 'found', 'mask', 'maybe', 'mask', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'there', 'rather', 'just', 'Bill', 'own', 'projection', 'something', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'Kubrick', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'simply', 'diving', 'territory', 'kicks', 'giggles', 'also', 'honor', 'institution', 'marriage', 'POV', 'marriage', 'protects', 'partner', 'taboos', 'of/releated', 'sex', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'dangers', 'STDs', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'ruining', 'families', 'own', 'lover', 'pedophile', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Given', 'Kubrick', 'detached', 'personality', 'yet', 'extreme', 'closeness', 'family', 'think', 'clear', 'see', 'where', 'was', 'coming', 'why', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'going', 'back', 'beginning', 'addition', 'protecting', 'one', 'outside', 'dangers', 'also', 'institution', 'marriage', 'protect', 'partner', 'inside', 'dangers', 'own', 'egos', 'keeping', 'check', 'result', 'various', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'made', 'marriage', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'general', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'statements', 'are', 'unique', 'basically', 'just', 'Psychoanalysis', '101', 'Kubrick', 'able', 'present', 'such', 'statements', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'powerful', 'process', 'process', 'largely', 'visual', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'directly', 'deal', 'such', 'subjects', 'face', 'value.Finally', 'think', 'Kubrick', 'most', 'emotional', 'film', 'career', 'love', 'many', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'question', 'very', 'detached', 'most', 'commentary', 'think', 'different', 'case', 'here', 'still', 'detachment', 'think', 'own', 'emotion', 'detachment', 'as', 'well', 'Whether', 'not', 'agree/like', 'what', 'film', 'say', 'more', 'experience', 'more', 'can', 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'likely', 'meant', 'him.For', 'Dorothy', 'Rainbow', 'head', 'think', 'same', 'Bill', 'Alice', 'Stanley', '****', '10/10']",N/A

MADIGAN,"[2, 3]","Eyes Wide Shut relates a story about a marriage and comments on the institution of marriage itself as currently simplistic, offering no more than a formulaic scenario of child, home, and sexy parents who have been brainwashed by messages that told them the marriage mill of convention was where they would experinece something akin to fulfillment. The film shows how this surface- world of marriage comforts, is a devolving experience, more like the very end of experience as both Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise wrestle with other urges, propositions, sexual temptaions that lead nowhere, expunging their identities almost, effacing them as they keep referring to the flesh as a solid referent point. It is as if marriage itself and the culture that upholds it were hopelessly deep only at the very surface, so that the last line of the film is what the whole thing is about, the &quot;f&quot; word,with the child present,while shopping for Christmas gifts etc...it's all a vulgarism, a cheap charade, and these two cannot escape..it's Plato's cave with these two and everybody else lurking forever in the shadows of ignorance and a kind of tragic trust.

118647,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,079074841X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","I don't think it's possible to truly explain Eyes Wide Shut to anyone who hasn't seen it.  For some, it will be too darn weird, far too lengthy, and too abstract and open-ended to be enjoyable.  Others, however, will find themselves as fascinated as I was while watching this extraordinary film, especially after it transforms itself into something totally unexpected about midway through.  There is a sort of surreal atmosphere around everything that happens here, although I must say I sensed no dreamlike qualities to any parts of it.  I really didn't know what to expect going in - besides a bunch of nudity and the whole erotic Cruise-Kidman relationship - but that was a good thing (especially since the movie isn't really about those things).  Eyes Wide Shut is so unusual that it's probably better for the viewer to go in with no expectations whatsoever.I came to this film for Nicole Kidman, just as many probably came to it for Cruise.  It's really a Tom Cruise feature, I have to say, with Kidman scoring a lot less screen time than I expected.  Now, I love Nicole Kidman, and I was mesmerized by this entire movie, but I don't think this was one of Kidman's better performances.  Maybe it's just the fact that racy language coming out of her mouth just doesn't sit right with me, but I was definitely uncomfortable watching Kidman work her way through the more emotional scenes (which seemed a little overdramatic).  Cruise, for his part, is great, and the whole supporting cast (including Leelee Sobieski in a small but scintillating role) is excellent.Bill and Alice Harford have a complex relationship.  Following a strange party which finds them each flirting with other people, Alice starts a discussion that ends with her recounting her fantasies about another man.  Bill, who sits there with a blank look on his face throughout the uncomfortable scene, then gets called away to the home of a patient who has just died.  As you might expect, images of his wife with another man just keep running through his mind, and the unexpected advances of his dead patient's daughter sort of tip his precarious grip on reality a little too close to the edge.  Opportunity begins to become temptation, and he moves ever closer to infidelity.  Just when you think you have the movie figured out, though, it runs off like the Road Runner escaping the grasping hands of Wile E. Coyote.  Bill finds his way to an exclusive, secretive party of costumed men and women doing things that are far removed from the morality of the everyday world.  The whole scene is just amazingly surreal and weird - yet certainly exciting and stimulating.  The things Bill witnesses at this party set the stage for the rest of the film.  This is as much as I want to say about the plot, but I must emphasize just how multi-layered the story is.  It's a brilliantly complicated film that touches all sorts of emotional buttons.In the end, Eyes Wide Shut is a movie about relationships, particularly marriage, with infidelity and jealousy standing as the touchstones of Kubrick's elaborate exploration of the most intense and vulnerable of emotions.  People wear all sorts of emotional masks, they indulge in fantasies and sometimes give in to temptation, and Eyes Wide Shut plays extremely well on these themes.  Kubrick really weaves all sorts of disparate elements together in the most mesmerizing of ways.  I can certainly understand why some people just don't like the movie at all, though.

I simply had to see the DVD two nights in a row because his last effort is so dense that one can not fully appreciate EYES WIDE SHUT's structure after the first viewing.To present a movie that can be read at several different levels is the mark of a genuine author-director.

And I think that all these interpretations are equally correct and must be respected. EYES WIDE SHUT is a spark that sets on fire people's imaginations.Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise and Sydney Pollack are excellent. The production design, as always in Kubrick's movies, is gorgeous and the mask reunion a moment of pure cinema during which  Kubrick is meeting Federico Fellini, another poet of the Strangeness.Please note that I've seen EYES WIDE SHUT on the DVD zone 2 available at Amazon.fr.

118651,AJRPOXVAQ4JW0,079074841X,"Dave Clayton ""Wereaardvark""","[8, 12]","Stanley Kubrick spent the last years of his life working on this film. And by the time Eyes Wide Shut went into general release in the United States, the director was already deceased, giving his final project the cachet of a farewell gesture-or perhaps a Last Judgment, since the Dies Irae from the Mozart Requiem can be heard at one point on the soundtrack. Yet its long awaited appearance turned out to be something of an anticlimax when most of the pre-release gossip turned out to be unjustified. No dazzling spectacle in the vein of 2001: A Space Odyssey nor even A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut (made available here as part of Warner Home Video's excellent set of Kubrick's films) was first of all a fable for the approaching millennium, directed with a breathtaking d&eacute;sinvolture that still seems astonishing several years later. One day, I hope, Eyes Wide Shut will be recognized as one of the most beautiful works in the history of the cinema.Only in bad works of art or the artifacts of pop culture is it possible to make a facile distinction between the periphery of a work and its core. In an imaginative creation like Kubrick's last film, the limits of the core extend to its furthermost boundaries just as what could at first glance seem peripheral penetrates to its innermost recesses. Already, the opening shots of the Harfords in their stylish apartment getting ready to go out for a soiree go far beyond simply establishing a setting. The least that could be said about these powerfully iridescent, Ophulsian compositions set to music by Shostakovitch is how much more than functional they are: rather than simply establishing a particular locale, they serve to introduce us to a perversely enchanted world. The mise en sc&egrave;ne is incantatory, but the spirits it is calling up are those of high-tech consumerism.In these images, the d&eacute;cor glows with a maleficent radiance, making of the Harfords themselves little more than the props of their own property. Small wonder that such a culture finds the culmination of its most refined pleasures in the celebration of a Black Mass at a mansion on Long Island--movie trivia buffs will not fail to notice a visual allusion to Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest--attended by the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the rich, famous, and powerful, a ritual which blasphemously travesties the Christmas festivities taking place at the same moment and which has striking parallels to the events of de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom in both its literary version and its much later screen adaptation by Pier Paolo Pasolini, Sal&ograve; o le 120 giornati di Sodoma (1975).In the milieu in which the Harfords move, reified to the last degree, success is all a matter of remaining on the surface of things, and Bill Harford has thoroughly mastered that skill. But the surface begins to crack open one evening when his wife relates a fantasy about sleeping with a Naval officer they had briefly glimpsed at a resort. Bill reacts violently to this confession, insisting that he has never had similar fantasies of his own. But he cannot exorcise the images she has planted in his mind and they soon begin to take shape on the screen. Moreover, this fantasy which increasingly obsesses Harford opens up to a larger world of collective desires underlying the beautiful realm of surfaces in which Bill wishes to remain happily imprisoned. Forced to confront that underworld by series of encounters involving the daughter of a patient, a prostitute, and ultimately a Satanist coven, he can only reject it as a mystery.The phrase ""eyes wide shut"" is virtually an etymological gloss on the word ""mystery."" In the words of Carl Ker&eacute;nyi (in his essay ""The Mysteries of the Kabeiroi""), ""The source of the term 'Mysteria'--as also of 'mystes' and 'mystikos'--consists in a verb whose ritual significance is 'to initiate' (&#965;e&#912;&#957;), developed from the verb &#973;e&#953;&#957;, 'to close the eyes or mouth.'"" He goes on to add, ""the Mysteria begin for the mystes when, as sufferer of the event (&#965;&#959;&#973;e&#957;&#959;&#962;), he closes his eyes, falls back as it were into his own darkness, enters into the darkness."" And is there anything less enigmatic about an audience sitting in a darkened theater, an audience which also could be said to fall back as it were into its own darkness, to enter its darkness--to borrow Kerenyi's formulation--watching this spectacle being enacted on screen?It is Bill's friend, the musician Nick Nightingale who tells him of playing at an event whose specifics are unclear to him, since he has to play blindfolded. Nevertheless, the few details he has been able to spy upon after the blindfold slightly fell from his eyes the last time he performed rouse Bill's interest, and he demands to go along to the event. When Harford, the non-initiate, violates this mystery, he not only disrupts its performance, but commits a crime which can only be atoned for by a human sacrifice--that of the young woman whom Harford has previously rescued from a drug overdose at the fancy party the evening before.Yet there is little mystery about this mystery, which continues in a perhaps more explicit vein the theme of archaic regression that recurs throughout Kubrick's work--perhaps most arrestingly in 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which modern technology is presented as an outgrowth of the anthropoids' fetishization of the black obelisk which has descended to them from the heavens like the stone given by Gabriel to Abraham enshrined in the Kaaba. Civilization is constantly haunted by the specter of the barbaric past it has never been able to overcome, and the cult in Eyes Wide Shut is only a final incarnation of this key motif which Kubrick employed here for last time. After that death had the final word: Acta est fabula!",5,Stanley Kubrick's Last Judgment,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,5841,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'spent', 'last', 'years', 'life', 'working', 'film',

118652,A1AUBGENRIZODO,079074841X,Dave Deubler,"[11, 13]","Fans of Tom Cruise who are expecting an action movie will be sorely disappointed by Kubrick's burning, slow-paced, expressionistic look into sexual repression and desire.  On the other hand, fans of art-house movies should be enthralled by the lush sets, exquisite costumes, and psychosexual drama.  Sections of the film seem to hint at the &quot;one desperate man outwits the evil organization&quot; role that Cruise plays in &quot;The Firm&quot;, but Kubrick is interested in ideas and feelings, not action and violence, so the lack of a clear-cut resolution is really quite understandable; real life problems seldom offer easy answers.  At an opulent party, a handsome young doctor's beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman) dances flirtatiously with a distinguished gentleman while her husband deals with a medical emergency.  Afterwards, they have an argument that reveals their mutual frustrations.  Bill claims that he is never jealous because he knows that women desire the comfort and security that comes with commitment.  At the same time he tells his wife that he would never have sex with other women because doing so would hurt her.  This infuriates her, because it makes her feel that she is being held responsible for his sexual repression, (a condition we are unaware of at the time, but which becomes very clear during the next hour of the film, as Bill finds himself faced with a series of sexual opportunities), and so she rather spitefully apprises him of her own carnal desire for a young naval officer.  Obsessed and threatened by the idea that his wife has the same kind of sexual desires that men have, Bill sets off on the sometimes bizarre psychological journey that comprises the central section of the film.  As we follow Bill through the next couple of days, we see a number of attractive women come on to him, in a series of more and more exciting scenarios, but in every case, he not only remains in control, but in the long run, decides to do nothing.  It does seem, however, that he becomes more active as the element of risk increases; Kubrick is trying to show us how danger and unfamiliarity are intertwined with sexuality.  Of course the downside of danger is that one sometimes gets burned, as we see demonstrated repeatedly.  Bill's problem is that he craves the adventure of risk-taking, but is ultimately too responsible and has too much to lose. The paralysis this conflict causes is brilliantly dramatized - realistically in the scene with the prostitute (and its chilling sequel), and expressionistically in the orgy scene, where Bill never really does anything except get warned, threatened, exposed, and ostracized.  Meanwhile, his wife has had a dream in which she has sex with other men in front of her husband, and laughs at him to show her disdain.  Although she finds the dream upsetting, it shows that she is also torn between her love for her husband, and a need for more sexual freedom.  The climax, when Bill finds her sleeping with the mask, can be taken on two levels, but psychologically, this scene shows Bill's realization that she's been sleeping with the mask all along; he hasn't let her in to his innermost thoughts and desires, but has always worn this mask of confident professional detachment and disinterest, and he finally understands how much this has hurt her.  The flickering back and forth between realism and expressionism will displease many, and it is certainly the film's greatest flaw as well as its strength, but to those who are willing to delve past the literal world to the subtle ideas beneath, Kubrick provides an unforgettable window into some of the deepest recesses of the human soul.",5,A psychodrama of sexual repression,984528000,"03 14, 2001",2001,3661,"['Fans', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'action', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Kubrick', 'burning', 'slow-paced', 'expressionistic', 'look', 'sexual', 'repression', 'desire', 'other', 'hand', 'fans', 'art-house', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'enthralled', 'lush', 'sets', 'exquisite', 'costumes', 'psychosexual', 'drama', 'Sections', 'film', 'seem', 'hint', 'quot', 'one', 'desperate', 'man', 'evil', 'organization', 'quot', 'role', 'Cruise', 'quot', 'Firm', 'quot', 'Kubrick', 'interested', 'ideas', 'feelings', 'not', 'action', 'violence', 'lack', 'clear-cut', 'resolution', 'really', 'quite', 'understandable', 'real', 'life', 'problems', 'seldom', 'offer', 'easy', 'answers', 'opulent', 'party', 'handsome', 'young', 'doctor', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'flirtatiously', 'distinguished', 'gentleman', 'husband', 'deals', 'medical', 'emergency', 'Afterwards', 'have', 'argument', 'mutual', 'frustrations', 'Bill', 'never', 'jealous', 'women', 'desire', 'comfort', 'security', 'commitment', 'same', 'time', 'wife', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'women', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'hurt', 'feel', 'being', 'held', 'responsible', 'sexual', 'repression', 'condition', 'are', 'unaware', 'time', 'very', 'clear', 'next', 'hour', 'film', 'Bill', 'faced', 'series', 'sexual', 'opportunities', 'so', 'rather', 'spitefully', 'own', 'carnal', 'desire', 'young', 'naval', 'officer', 'Obsessed', 'threatened', 'idea', 'wife', 'same', 'kind', 'sexual', 'desires', 'men', 'have', 'Bill', 'off', 'sometimes', 'bizarre', 'psychological', 'journey', 'central', 'section', 'film', 'follow', 'Bill', 'next', 'couple', 'days', 'see', 'number', 'attractive', 'women', 'come', 'series', 'more', 'more', 'exciting', 'scenarios', 'case', 'not', 'only', 'control', 'long', 'run', 'do', 'nothing', 'seem', 'however', 'more', 'active', 'element', 'risk', 'increases', 'Kubrick', 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'danger', 'unfamiliarity', 'are', 'intertwined', 'sexuality', 'course', 'downside', 'danger', 'one', 'sometimes', 'burned', 'see', 'demonstrated', 'repeatedly', 'Bill', 'problem', 'adventure', 'risk-taking', 'ultimately', 'too', 'responsible', 'too', 'much', 'lose', 'paralysis', 'conflict', 'brilliantly', 'dramatized', 'realistically', 'scene', 'prostitute', 'chilling', 'sequel', 'expressionistically', 'orgy', 'scene', 'where', 'Bill', 'never', 'really', 'anything', 'get', 'warned', 'threatened', 'exposed', 'ostracized', 'Meanwhile', 'wife', 'had', 'dream', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'front', 'husband', 'laughs', 'show', 'disdain', 'dream', 'upsetting', 'also', 'torn', 'love', 'husband', 'need', 'more', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'climax', 'when', 'Bill', 'sleeping', 'mask', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'two', 'levels', 'psychologically', 'scene', 'Bill', 'realization', 'been', 'sleeping', 'mask', 'along', ""n't"", 'let', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'desires', 'always', 'worn', 'mask', 'confident', 'professional', 'detachment', 'disinterest', 'finally', 'how', 'much', 'hurt', 'flickering', 'back', 'forth', 'realism', 'expressionism', 'will', 'displease', 'many', 'certainly', 'film', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'as', 'well', 'strength', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'delve', 'literal', 'world', 'subtle', 'ideas', 'beneath', 'Kubrick', 'unforgettable', 'window', 'deepest', 'recesses', 'human', 'soul']",N/A
118653,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,079074841X,David Baldwin,"[9, 10]","It's a shame that Stanley Kubrick's final film would be so vastly misunderstood by the majority of critics and general public.  The fault, or should I say reason, may lie in Kubrick's decision to be faithful to the original source material, ""Traumnovelle"", a novel by Viennese pscychiatrist Arthur Schnitzler published at the turn of the twentieth century.  I read this work after my interest was piqued by the film and the conventions in this translation would seem dated by today's standards.  Kubrick had his work cut out for him in trying to relate it to a modern audience.  In a nutshell, the way I view this film is as a cautionary tale about the importance of fidelity.  The story concerns a physician who seems to have it all: a gorgeous wife, cute daughter, a successful practice.  But the couple seem to be at a crossroads in their marriage.  The good doctor is suffering from a case of wanderlust.  Which leads into a series of surrealist escapades that involve provocative sexuality.  What starts out as a dream turns into a nightmare, which ultimately leads him back to the safety of the situation he found so stifling.  A good question to ask is why Kubrick, who hadn't made a film in twelve years prior to this project, was compelled to this material.  Is this his commentary on the state of modern relationships?  The choice of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the married couple was curious.  What did Kubrick see in their relationship that would inevitably crumble a few short years after this film was released?  The chilliest portion of the film is not the controversial orgy scene but the scene where Kidman dresses Cruise down in the bedroom after smoking some pot.  The precision in which Kidman assaults Cruise's assumptions about their marriage and how dumbfounded Cruise becomes is downright eerie.  Another question that begs to be answered is how much of Kidman's tirade is real and how much of it was within the character she was playing.  I remember when this film was released in 1999 the rumors that circulated around it were about the film's explicit sexuality.  There was a massive letdown because the movie was more of a portrait of a marriage at a certain turning point.  This is consistent with Kubrick's work that he delivered the unexpected.  Hopefully there will be a kinder re-evaluation in the future of this master's final work.",5,Misunderstood Kubrick Film,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,2370,"['shame', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'final', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'vastly', 'misunderstood', 'majority', 'critics', 'general', 'public', 'fault', 'should', 'say', 'reason', 'may', 'lie', 'Kubrick', 'decision', 'be', 'faithful', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'Traumnovelle', 'novel', 'Viennese', 'pscychiatrist', 'Arthur', 'Schnitzler', 'published', 'turn', 'twentieth', 'century', 'read', 'work', 'interest', 'was', 'piqued', 'film', 'conventions', 'translation', 'would', 'seem', 'dated', 'today', 'standards', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'trying', 'relate', 'modern', 'audience', 'nutshell', 'way', 'view', 'film', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'importance', 'fidelity', 'story', 'physician', 'who', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'cute', 'daughter', 'successful', 'practice', 'couple', 'seem', 'be', 'crossroads', 'marriage', 'good', 'doctor', 'suffering', 'case', 'wanderlust', 'Which', 'series', 'surrealist', 'escapades', 'involve', 'provocative', 'sexuality', 'What', 'out', 'dream', 'nightmare', 'ultimately', 'back', 'safety', 'situation', 'found', 'so', 'stifling', 'good', 'question', 'ask', 'why', 'Kubrick', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'film', 'twelve', 'years', 'prior', 'project', 'was', 'compelled', 'material', 'commentary', 'state', 'modern', 'relationships', 'choice', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'married', 'couple', 'was', 'curious', 'What', 'did', 'Kubrick', 'see', 'relationship', 'would', 'inevitably', 'crumble', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'chilliest', 'portion', 'film', 'not', 'controversial', 'orgy', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'Kidman', 'Cruise', 'down', 'bedroom', 'smoking', 'pot', 'precision', 'Kidman', 'Cruise', 'assumptions', 'marriage', 'how', 'dumbfounded', 'Cruise', 'becomes', 'downright', 'eerie', 'question', 'be', 'answered', 'how', 'much', 'Kidman', 'tirade', 'real', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'remember', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'rumors', 'circulated', 'were', 'film', 'explicit', 'sexuality', 'was', 'massive', 'letdown', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'portrait', 'marriage', 'certain', 'turning', 'point', 'consistent', 'Kubrick', 'work', 'delivered', 'unexpected', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'kinder', 're-evaluation', 'future', 'master', 'final', 'work']",N/A

This final entry into a brilliant career is a psychological masterpiece, with elements of voyeurism and controversy. The theme is that of psychological infidelity and how it affects the main character, played by Tom Cruise.  From the moment his wife describes a fantasy she had at a hotel years before concerning another man, Cruise propels from one encounter to another, each becoming more and more dangerous. Several times, Cruise barely escapes bad situations as he wonders the seedier side of New York. Drugs, HIV, prostitutes, pedophiles, Masked Balls, this film has it all. It also has symbolism (notice the use of color) and a great cast of beautiful people including Nicole Kideman, LeeLee Sobieski and Julianne Davis. The story threads around a prostitute named Mandy Cruise meets at a party, who has ""ODed"" in his married friends bathroom.  Later he encounters her at a Masked Ball, where a sex orgy is underway. Faced with getting an unrated film, Kubrick inserted shadows and Masked figures hiding all of the sexual activity for the Theatrical version. It plays well, leaving the viewer to their imagination. Having viewed the unrated edition, the removal of the CGI figures does not make the scenes any more erotic, and the viewer may prefer the hidden feel as imagination can be more compelling than seeing the action.  The use of music and color is very erotic and artistic.  When Cruise blows his cover, the viewer never knows if it was for play or real, as Mandy sacrifices herself for Cruise's release.  I thought the morgue scene was very touching, that Cruise genuinely cared for her and wanted to save her.  At the end, Cruise ultimately finds that imagined infidelity may be worse than the real thing.  If you are looking for something different, I highly recommend 'Eyes Wide Shut'",5,Masterpiece,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,1859,"['Kubrick', 'films', 'are', 'unique', 'thought-provoking', 'final', 'entry', 'brilliant', 'career', 'psychological', 'masterpiece', 'elements', 'voyeurism', 'controversy', 'theme', 'psychological', 'infidelity', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'moment', 'wife', 'fantasy', 'had', 'hotel', 'years', 'concerning', 'man', 'Cruise', 'one', 'encounter', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Several', 'times', 'Cruise', 'barely', 'bad', 'situations', 'seedier', 'side', 'New', 'York', 'Drugs', 'HIV', 'pedophiles', 'Masked', 'Balls', 'film', 'also', 'symbolism', 'use', 'color', 'great', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'people', 'including', 'Nicole', 'Kideman', 'LeeLee', 'Sobieski', 'Julianne', 'Davis', 'story', 'threads', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Mandy', 'Cruise', 'party', 'who', 'ODed', 'married', 'friends', 'bathroom', 'Later', 'Masked', 'Ball', 'where', 'sex', 'orgy', 'underway', 'Faced', 'getting', 'unrated', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'inserted', 'shadows', 'Masked', 'figures', 'hiding', 'sexual', 'activity', 'Theatrical', 'version', 'well', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'Having', 'viewed', 'unrated', 'edition', 'removal', 'CGI', 'figures', 'not', 'make', 'scenes', 'more', 'erotic', 'viewer', 'may', 'prefer', 'hidden', 'feel', 'imagination', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'compelling', 'seeing', 'action', 'use', 'music', 'color', 'very', 'erotic', 'artistic', 'When', 'Cruise', 'cover', 'viewer', 'never', 'was', 'play', 'real', 'Mandy', 'Cruise', 'release', 'thought', 'morgue', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'Cruise', 'genuinely', 'cared', 'wanted', 'save', 'end', 'Cruise', 'ultimately', 'imagined', 'infidelity', 'may', 'be', 'worse', 'real', 'thing', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'Eyes"", 'Wide', 'Shut']",N/A

What do you like about it?""And I honestly have no clear answer. Why, in fact, do I love this film so damn much? I don't know. All I know is that its dreamy, Christmastime haze suckers me in every time. All I know is that it's hard for me to hear Shostakovich's Waltz #2 on its own terms without feeling an immense surge of emotion. I don't cry, mind you, but I feel like I could.I've never even been married. Hell, I've barely been in a serious, long-term relationship, for that matter. And no, I don't just like the film because of the copious nudity on display.I like it because of its subtleties; the small, odd gestures and movements that each character makes. The things they say and the unique ways in which they say it. I adore the film's late-night, wintertime vibe, and its gorgeous colors and striking images. I like how the film can be read in seemingly endless ways. Only Kubrick could make a film that's interpreted as anything from an expose of the Illuminati to a psycho-sexual Freudian odyssey to some sort of sociological lampooning of Tom Cruise's shattered ego.Most of all, I like how Kubrick went out with this one. Just a subtle, unassuming flick about a few days in the life of a rich doctor following some silly misunderstanding over the events of a Christmas party.

The only defense I can suggest is that perhaps had Kubrick lived  a bit longer, the film would have been dramatically improved.  Unfortunately, we are only able to judge the finished product that we see  before our very open eyes.  I have an incredible respect and  admiration  for Kubrick's past masterpieces.  &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; for  instance, is perhaps the defining film concerning the Vietnam tragedy.  &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot;&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; and  &quot;The Shining,&quot; will remain among the finest movies of all time.  Every artist, however, has  their inevitable failures, and the giant,  Stanley Kubrick, is no exception.&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is so  incredibly awful that I am convinced only someone as respected as Kubrick  could have gotten it produced.  A  budding screen director would have been  ridiculed.  The banality of the dialogue prompted me to feel sorry for the  actors  who did their best to give the script some credence. Even the  members of the Academy Awards Committee could not find an excuse to  give  the deceased director a prize in even the minor categories.  Publicly the  motion picture industry said all the appropriate things.  The  virtual  silence, however, during the awards ceremony spoke volumes of how they  actually valued &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; One should also notice  that  the Amazon community reviewers have essentially ignored this movie. Is this  due to a subtle and tacit mindset that believes if you can't  say something  nice, you shouldn't say anything whatsoever?  The only saving grace of this  film is Kubrick's mind boggling ability of  photographing scenes.  My  breath is always taken away when observing the visual beauty of Kubrick's  artistry.  Could any other major  director do it better?  None comes to  mind.  Stanley Kubrick is significantly more skilled than even the talented  Steven Spielberg.  I  suspect that Kubrick was becoming very cynical and  bitter towards the end of his life.  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; exudes a  misanthropic aura that  made the film difficult to watch.  The highly  publicized nudity was not in the least bit erotic.  The film's pervasive  coldness, subdued anger,  and unjustifiable length gave me the distinct  impression that Kubrick wanted us to suffer through this experience.  I  know little about  Kubrick's final years, but I doubt if he knew much joy  or existential satisfaction.  Chris Isaak's lyrics of &quot;Baby did a bad,  bad  thing&quot; is the signature song of this film.  It behooves me to  paraphrase Isaak and add &quot;Stanley Kubrick did a bad, bad thing.&quot;  Kubrick made  a film best forgotten and beneath his dignity.  Only hard  core Kubrick fans should waste their time.  Furthermore, I am also relieved  that  Amazon.com will allow me future opportunities to evaluate Kubrick's  remaining works.  These caustic remarks will most likely be the  exception.  I must reiterate my praise for all of the other Kubrick films that I was  privileged to see.",2,"Stanley Kubrick Did a Bad, Bad Thing with Eyes Wide Shut",966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,3182,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'release', 'quot', 'Eye', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'was', 'pathetic', 'misanthropic', 'finish', 'one', 'greatest', 'careers', 'film', 'making', 'history', 'only', 'defense', 'can', 'suggest', 'perhaps', 'had', 'Kubrick', 'lived', 'bit', 'longer', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dramatically', 'improved', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'only', 'able', 'judge', 'finished', 'product', 'see', 'very', 'open', 'eyes', 'have', 'incredible', 'respect', 'admiration', 'Kubrick', 'past', 'masterpieces', 'quot', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'quot', 'instance', 'perhaps', 'defining', 'film', 'concerning', 'Vietnam', 'tragedy', 'quot', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'quot', 'quot', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'quot', 'quot', 'Shining', 'quot', 'will', 'remain', 'finest', 'movies', 'time', 'artist', 'however', 'inevitable', 'failures', 'giant', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'exception.', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'so', 'incredibly', 'awful', 'am', 'convinced', 'only', 'someone', 'as', 'respected', 'Kubrick', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'produced', 'budding', 'screen', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ridiculed', 'banality', 'dialogue', 'prompted', 'feel', 'sorry', 'actors', 'who', 'did', 'best', 'give', 'script', 'credence', 'Even', 'members', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Committee', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'excuse', 'give', 'deceased', 'director', 'prize', 'even', 'minor', 'categories', 'Publicly', 'motion', 'picture', 'industry', 'said', 'appropriate', 'things', 'virtual', 'silence', 'however', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'how', 'actually', 'valued', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut.', 'quot', 'One', 'should', 'also', 'notice', 'Amazon', 'community', 'reviewers', 'have', 'essentially', 'ignored', 'movie', 'due', 'subtle', 'tacit', 'mindset', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'something', 'nice', 'should', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'mind', 'boggling', 'ability', 'photographing', 'scenes', 'breath', 'always', 'taken', 'away', 'when', 'observing', 'visual', 'beauty', 'Kubrick', 'artistry', 'Could', 'other', 'major', 'director', 'do', 'better', 'None', 'mind', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'significantly', 'more', 'skilled', 'even', 'talented', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'suspect', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'becoming', 'very', 'cynical', 'bitter', 'towards', 'end', 'life', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'misanthropic', 'aura', 'made', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch', 'highly', 'publicized', 'nudity', 'was', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'erotic', 'film', 'pervasive', 'coldness', 'subdued', 'anger', 'unjustifiable', 'length', 'gave', 'distinct', 'impression', 'Kubrick', 'wanted', 'suffer', 'experience', 'know', 'little', 'Kubrick', 'final', 'years', 'doubt', 'knew', 'much', 'joy', 'existential', 'satisfaction', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'lyrics', 'quot', 'Baby', 'did', 'bad', 'bad', 'thing', 'quot', 'signature', 'song', 'film', 'paraphrase', 'Isaak', 'add', 'quot', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'did', 'bad', 'bad', 'thing.', 'quot', 'Kubrick', 'made', 'film', 'best', 'forgotten', 'beneath', 'dignity', 'Only', 'hard', 'core', 'Kubrick', 'fans', 'should', 'waste', 'time', 'Furthermore', 'am', 'also', 'relieved', 'Amazon.com', 'will', 'allow', 'future', 'opportunities', 'evaluate', 'Kubrick', 'remaining', 'works', 'caustic', 'remarks', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'exception', 'must', 'reiterate', 'praise', 'other', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'was', 'privileged', 'see']",N/A

118663,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,079074841X,Dennis Littrell,"[131, 143]","Eyes Wide Shut is not the self-indulgent, opaque film that I had been led by some reviewers to expect.  It is clear and focused with an important and worthy theme.  Kubrick is exploring the nature of human sexuality in light of recent conclusions derived from evolutionary biology.  The theme can be stated simply: ""marriage is a fortress continually under siege.""  To be able to use Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as his married couple, who not so incidentally were actually married to one another at the time, was quite a coup since it lent accessibility and immediacy to his theme.  We are able to catch glimpses of what their married life might have been like and to see that marriage played out against the temptations of a cosmopolitan lifestyle.  Indeed with their subsequent separation, Kubrick's theme is ironically supported.Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, an attractive, high status, confident male who has always deceived himself about his sexual nature and the nature of women and especially the nature of his wife, Alice.  They go to a party and act out some ""teasing themselves"" roles, as they have undoubtedly done before.  Nothing comes of it since they are circumspect people.  But the next night Alice decides to strip away her husband's smug confidence about her nature and expose to him the truth about feminine sexuality, and so tells him a little story about how she was moved to abandonment by just a glance from a man in uniform.  Her expression is so vivid and powerful that Bill, stunned and shocked, begins to imagine this event that never took place, an event Alice has assured him, might well have taken place.  As he visualizes, he begins to explore himself as various expressions of human sexuality are thrown his way, the prostitute, the gay-bashing young men, the teenage girl entertaining older men...etc.  What he sees behind his mask watching the enactment of a secret medieval pagan ceremony tempts and enlightens him.This film did not work well for a general audience for several reasons.  One, many people did NOT identify with the privileged and glamorous couple.  Two, the resolution of the theme was without the usual violence and/or sexual indulgence common in contemporary American cinema, a disappointment for some.  Three, many young couples viewing the film together, or at least in light of their own marriages, were made uncomfortable and threatened by being reminded of their own temptations and frustrations.  To have the truth of our duplicitous natures rubbed in our faces, as it were, is not something everybody wants to sit still for.  Most people lie to themselves about their sexual behavior and especially their hidden sexual desires most of the time.  Kubrick wanted us to see how compromised we really are.  Finally, some were disappointed by an ending in which we see that we are human, all too human, and we have to accept that and live with it.  Bill, realizing what he has done, not so much in action, as in his heart, cries out to Alice, what shall we do now?  And she wisely says (because she has already figured this out): Be grateful that one day does not make an entire lifetime.What is wonderful about a film like this is that, instead of going to the movies, fat and comfortable with the steak and wine in our bellies, expecting to be diverted from the irritations of our lives and to be massaged by the story upon the screen (as in say, You've Got Mail (1998) or Titanic (1998)) instead we are confronted with some uncomfortable truths about our own lives, and made to squirm.  Our eyes are indeed wide shut, and we kid ourselves and tell ourselves lies about who we are sexually and what we really feel and want.  Marriage is a compromise with the world and with our nature.  Something is gained and something is lost, but this is no perfect world; and just as it is better to be respectable and a member of the establishment than to sleep in the streets, it is better to marry and maintain that marriage against our animal nature than it is to toss it away.Kidman is mesmerizing and reinforces her reputation as great talent.  As always she becomes the character she is playing.  Cruise is clever, cute and has great timing.  The sets are crisp and absolutely right for the story, and the dialogue is first class.  The sometimes annoying score is appropriate.  But this is not a great movie.  Some of the scenes could have been sped up, and Kubrick did play the suspense card a little too slowly at times.  I would rank it just below the best of Kubrick's work, somewhere between Dr. Strangelove (1964) and The Shining (1980), superior to Spartacus (1960) but not quite on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).  Certainly we see the mark of the mature artist here in both theme and treatment.See this for Stanley Kubrick, one of cinema's most accomplished and respected artists.  It was his last completed film before he died.

For all  the rumours of it being erotic and sexually titillating, audiences watching  it for this reason will undoubtedly be disappointed because the scenes are  hardly passionate. The drama unfolds in the glitzy New York stage which is  chillingly somber and dark, and Tom Cruise as Dr. Bill Harford finds  himself disturbed by images of infidelity after his wife, Alice (Nicole  Kidman) replayed out her fantasies. The mood of the film is serious and  surreal; Kubrick is a master at capturing the dark labyrinth and for the  questions it dissects and poses on faith and love - it is an awakening and  a moral dilemma acted out by Harford. It is adapted very simply from Arthur  Schnitzler &quot;Dream Story&quot; - the plot has no intricacies - but  rather the mood of the film overwhelms beautifully, even with Tom Cruise  trying to match his acting skills with the sublime directing. The sex  rituals are in my opinion - delicious terror that mirrors guilt and  evilness of human's heart.It is controversial for the diverse and  radical thoughts in the movie - and definitely not on kinky sex. Kubrick's  directing is in fact what makes EYES WIDE SHUT miraculously alive - even it  loses grit and impetus in its last moment for the inconclusive ending.

118667,A3MCC5MAJYJYMD,079074841X,Dhaval Vyas,"[4, 12]","'Eyes Wide Shut' was the final film of the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's films probably have had greater disagreement among film lovers than any other movie maker in history. Just for that he deserves to be remembered. Those who love his works call him a genius, while those that hate his films call him a charlatan. Regardless of what people may think of him and his movies, it is no doubt that his films continue to fascinate the movie fanatics. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception, although this reviewer will sympathize with those do no like this film.Most of this movie is very difficult to watch. No doubt, Kubrick's impeccable craft is still there. The lighting, editing, music and a creepy atmosphere stays throughout the film, as it does in many of his other films. What is horribly lacking in the movie is a screenplay, story, and most importantly, a point or moral. The screenplay is downright awful. I swear Tom Cruise repeats everything another character says to him. It is as though Cruise's character is absolutely clueless and has ADD. It is as though the screenwriters could not find anything better to write. The story is a absolute mess. Each scene is drawn out three times longer than it should. There are long pauses in the conversations, even though the characters are talking about the most mundane things. Rumors exits that Kubrick was a control freak. These rumors might be right. He was so obsessed with photography and technique that he destroyed any kind of spontaneity. The plot of 'Eyes Wide Shut'? Tom Cruise walks around ""New York City"" all night long encountering one bizarre sexual encounter after another. Many of these scenes are embarrassing and painful to watch. None of these encounters seem to bring any kind of point, except things most people already know.Although this movie has many bad things going for it, other things stood out that saved the film from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, and Sydney Pollack do a fantastic job in their acting. Their performances are powerful and convincing, and salvage a badly written story. Stanley Kubrick once again shines in his directing, as the orgy scene and the ""billiard room talk"" are both hair-raising and brilliant film-making. In the end though, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is pretty much a waste of time. Kubrick died before he finished editing the film, so maybe what we saw wasn't what he really intended. Nonetheless, even if Kubrick had completed the movie before his death, I don't see how the final product could have been any better.",2,Eyes Shut In Embarrassment.,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,2578,"[""'Eyes"", 'Wide', 'Shut', 'was', 'final', 'film', 'legendary', 'filmmaker', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'probably', 'have', 'had', 'greater', 'disagreement', 'film', 'lovers', 'other', 'movie', 'maker', 'history', 'Just', 'be', 'remembered', 'who', 'love', 'works', 'call', 'genius', 'hate', 'films', 'call', 'charlatan', 'Regardless', 'what', 'people', 'may', 'think', 'movies', 'doubt', 'films', 'continue', 'fascinate', 'movie', 'fanatics', ""'Eyes"", 'Shut', 'exception', 'reviewer', 'will', 'sympathize', 'do', 'film.Most', 'movie', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'doubt', 'Kubrick', 'impeccable', 'craft', 'still', 'there', 'lighting', 'editing', 'music', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'What', 'horribly', 'lacking', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'story', 'most', 'importantly', 'point', 'moral', 'screenplay', 'downright', 'awful', 'swear', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'everything', 'character', 'Cruise', 'character', 'absolutely', 'clueless', 'ADD', 'screenwriters', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'better', 'write', 'story', 'absolute', 'mess', 'scene', 'drawn', 'out', 'three', 'times', 'longer', 'should', 'are', 'long', 'pauses', 'conversations', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'talking', 'most', 'mundane', 'things', 'Rumors', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'control', 'freak', 'rumors', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'was', 'so', 'obsessed', 'photography', 'technique', 'destroyed', 'kind', 'spontaneity', 'plot', ""'Eyes"", 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'night', 'long', 'encountering', 'one', 'bizarre', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'painful', 'watch', 'None', 'encounters', 'seem', 'bring', 'kind', 'point', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'already', 'movie', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'going', 'other', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'saved', 'film', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'powerful', 'convincing', 'salvage', 'badly', 'written', 'story', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'once', 'again', 'shines', 'directing', 'orgy', 'scene', 'billiard', 'room', 'talk', 'are', 'hair-raising', 'brilliant', 'film-making', 'end', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'pretty', 'much', 'waste', 'time', 'Kubrick', 'died', 'finished', 'editing', 'film', 'so', 'maybe', 'what', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'really', 'intended', 'Nonetheless', 'even', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'completed', 'movie', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'final', 'product', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

118669,A2198FZZMTJ38H,079074841X,D. Litton,"[0, 1]","&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a very hard film for me to sit through. There is brilliance in just about every nuance of its story, in every masterful shot, in the superb direction of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who makes his presence known throughout the movie with his unique techniques of camera movement and cinematography. The story has little to be desired in terms of complexity and movement, which is subtly suspenseful and very poignant. But there are some aspects of the movie that cannot be passed by, like the film's gratuitous amount of nudity and sexual practice. But still, the movie has a lot to offer.Kubrick begins this fascinating film by introducing us to William (Bill) Harford, a gynecologist, and his wife Alice. They are an upper-crust couple with a daughter living in New York City, and our first glimpses of their life seem perfectly normal and undemanding. Kubrick even goes so far as to show us their commitment to one another by putting them into several risque situations during a party scene in the first act. Alice drunkenly dances the night away with a total stranger, who keeps trying to persuade her to run away with him, while Bill is set upon by two women who are obviously doing more than making simple conversation.The spin on their fairy tale marriage comes the night after the party, as Alice and Bill share a joint in their room. Alice brings up the two girls at the party, which Bill counters with her waltzes with the unknown man. Alice becomes antagonized by his opinions on women and the trust in their marriage, and reveals to him a sexual longing she once held for someone else in the beginning of their marriage. Bill is upset by this, and finds an excuse to leave when he is called away to visit a deceased patient. Thus begins an intense foray of extensive eroticism and sexual temptation that threatens to destroy their marriage and Bill's life.The movie walks a fine line between fantasy and reality. Upon hearing his wife's admissions, Bill becomes plagued by dream-like visions of his wife's fantasy. It is these vivid pictures of his mind that drive him to the edge of fidelity, as he will later meet a hooker, attend a party which looks like something straight from the &quot;Kama Sutra,&quot; and find himself trapped in a web of deception among those he thinks are his friends as well as with himself. Kubrick masters Bill's subconscious by revealing a small piece at a time, leading up to the last full, shocking image of his wife's &quot;infidelity.&quot; These are small, shocking cuts, but remain important in the advancement of the character's mind.Kubrick keeps the pacing well-timed and subtle, keeping the suspense at bay until the final moments when all the secrets are revealed. Attention is critical in watching this movie: there is a lot to miss by not giving your full attention to particular scenes. Each sequence plays a crucial role of some sort, whether it be an advancement of the plot or some small secret leading up to the big finish.And what a finish it is. The movie is a milestone in creating a sense of high tension without ever going overboard on the suspense. Kubrick balances the physical and outer aspects of suspense with the inner tension of Bill's mind quite well, never losing focus of the point he is trying to make through this story. The ending is very satisfactory, one of those that ties everything together before finishing itself off in the last fade-out. All of the plot points you thought were useless and unnecessary come to light in a climax that is truly inspired and relieving.Every nuance of this movie practically screams &quot;Kubrick!&quot; His attention to details and his grace in filming keep this film on par with his other films. I recognized his tracking shots, such as those of people walking down hallways, from his film &quot;The Shining.&quot; This is perhaps the most stand-out feature of his career, and one he is most noted for. His use of color and light imagery are also very fervent. His characters are cast in lights that make them look pale and death-like, while the surrounding colors of the set pieces and the streets are branded with vivid hues and tones. And the images are quite shocking, to say the very least, some of the most shocking I've ever seen in a movie.Which leads me to wonder, was it really THAT necessary to have so much gratuitous sexual scenes spread throughout the plot? I know that Kubrick likes to shock his audiences with images sometimes,... but the graphic display of the party scenes seems to be a bit of a wandering from what the movie is all about. There's an old saying that goes, &quot;Less is more.&quot; The movie would do a lot better in following this adage, instead of showing all the goods.The performances at the front of this motion picture are helmed gloriously by real-life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the married couple qith ease and extravagance (not like they needed any coaching or anything). Cruise is composed yet torn apart inside, barely showing emotion until he cannot hold it in any longer. Kidman's performance is both moving and disappointing at times. I found her confrontations with Bill about her fantasy to be quite disturbing and beautifully mastered, but in her revelation of a dream she had been having, her sobs seemed a bit forced and unconvincing. But, looking past all that, these two actors have a bravura talent that presents itself beautifully onscreen. And what about that chemistry?Rounding things out, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is an inspired and mesmerizing look at fidelity, the mind, and emotion. Kubrick's masterful storytelling and filming techniques shine out in this, his final project, standing out as a truly brilliant achievement in movie-making. Pick it apart, and you'll find that there is more to this movie than what you see on its cover.",4,This is a true Kubrick film.,989020800,"05 5, 2001",2001,5866,"['quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut',

Of course, most of them complained about the same thing: the piano hammering the same note throughout. They obviously don't understand Kubrick's use of music to create a feeling for the film. He was much more concerned with the story and the film itself than trying to collaborate with the record companies to get Christina Aguilera's latest bubble gum hit in the film so that he and they could make some money on the soundtrack. The piano did an excellent job of creating the tense and haunting background so that we could be more in touch with the characters and what they were going through mentally.That being said, I found this to be a very good movie. I never once thought the story dragged, and as far as there being no payoff at the end, that's just a part of human nature to get all worked up about something that turns out to be nothing of any significance. Shame on more movie for not trying this approach, rather than reproducing the same cookie cutter Hollywood endings.Is it Kubrick's best film? I don't think so. Would I even put it in his top 5?

I've also enjoyed other movies by Cruise and Kidman. I was excited. I heard reviews that raved about this being his ""masterpiece"". I could not have been more disappointed.This movie is horrible. I tried hard to enjoy it. I watched it several times all the way through just to see if I was missing anything. I wasn't. It's just not a very good movie. The plot is nearly indecipherable.

A slow, miserably trying movie which wants to be something more than it actually is. It did not intrigue me at all, and I felt it that it was something Stanley Kubrick had shot if he were smoking hashish in astonishing quantities. The New York locations were artificially unconvincing, Tom Cruise's performance was adequately lukewarm-like most of his prioir performances, in this viewer's opinion. The story was at best, uninteresting, and, as you can surmise, I felt that this was an instantly forgettable film unworthy of even a second viewing because I found it to be inordinately boring.

It was also, ironically, filmed just before Tom & Nicole broke up (a bit of irony there?)  These facts alone would be enough to make this film a collector's item.  However, it also has some other things going for it as well.The story is about a Dr. (Tom Cruise) who is haunted by the notion that his wife (Nicole Kidman) has cheated on him.  Or, even if she didn't ACTUALLY cheat on him, she surely wanted to.  This leads him on an escapade of sexual deviance.  He considers hooking up with a girl who has a crush on him as well as soliciting the services of a prostitute.  He justifies his actions as a form of ""getting even"" with his spouse.The biggest gamble, however, is sneaking into a ritzy orgy scene where everyone is wearing masks.  The scene is bizarre and at the same time beautiful.  The ritual with the prostitutes is downright surreal.  This sets the stage for everything else that happens in the movie.If you're into erotic thrillers, this one belongs in your DVD collection.  Makes me wonder how much of this kind of thing really does go on in High Society places.  Also, Nicole Kidman takes her clothes off for the first time in quite awhile, and I do believe there are more nude shots of her in this film than any other movie I've ever seen her in.

You may be concerned that your color rods are freaking out, because the rich spectrum that you are used to is dissolving into a yinyang of orange and blue. You may see groups of people loitering together, in absolute stillness, for hours. You will hear NO overlapping dialogue; let us hope you are cool with this. Five minutes may pass between sentences, or between words in the same sentence. Archetypes (the untutored call them ""cliches"") out of centuries past will appear from thin air, uttering things like, ""Have you ever read Ovid on the Art of Love?"" in the tones of an Austrian Elmer Fudd.All of these things--like the expectant, churchly hush--are normal for Kubrick Country. It is a clean, vigilantly ordered land, like Singapore, except frigid and bare. Everything has a denatured smell, even the conversations, which sound as if a brilliant (and very patient) hermit has picked over the words for many years, like Madame Curie sifting through pitchblende ore. Throughout the decades of winnowing, every trace of Life (a messy, unstable element here) has been expunged in a principled quest for the perfect, radiant inner truth. But through some alchemical quirk, instead of luminous radium, the long sublimation has yielded a dull, generic loam, available anywhere. Which may be why it seemed so ""true"" to the wise hermit. Now, apply this arduous process to everything else: light, color, motion, decor, human interaction. Kubrick Country certainly looks like no other land, which may be its only point: it is difficult to compare it (unfavorably) with others.The ruler of this land was once a very great king. Its valleys were rich, temperate, lovely. The royal consorts were a succession of slim, graceful, hip young beauties, radiant with humor, compassion, intelligence: everything their subjects could want in a Queen. But alas--something happened. No one seems to know quite what. The royal relationships grew more and more protracted and (paradoxically) sour. Perhaps the King should have remained a fleet-footed gadabout. The ninth Queen (nicknamed ""the Orange"") was a cruel, licentious rakehell, a major embarrassment to the King. So he traded her in for a puckered old bluestocking (with the mannish name ""Barry"") to whom no breath of scandal would attach. The next Queen (known far and wide as ""the Shining One"") was a joy: bright, funny, much loved. Sadly, she was deposed by a smirky, meretricious cretin in a chrome jacket, who claimed to be Vietnamese but was no more Asian than Nancy Sinatra in a geisha wig.The late King's many genuflectors take the Maoist view that the Great Leader was by definition infallible, and that each of his wives was equally wonderful. It seems heartless to begrudge them this. Except: rational observers are now whispering that his thirteenth, and final, Queen is by far the ugliest of them all--indeed, one of the nastiest queens of any land, ever. Slow-witted, gauche, incontinent, yet drearily predictable, she moves in an inane coterie of court fools (sporting names like ""Cruise Control"" and ""Kidding Man""), and has zero interest in humanity, beauty, truth or life. Concerned friends of the King even plotted to throttle this gewgaw in her sleep, before she could soil the King's good name; but none could ever tell if her vapid eyes were open or closed.The grimmest part of this debacle may be the fate of the King's last true love. For it is widely held that, just before his death, he had wearied of his sallow, flatulent Queen and hoped to elevate a sweet ingenue (known by the initials A.I.) to her throne. That this was not allowed to happen is cause for great sadness, and suspicion.What next befell A.I. defies description. Deprived of her protector, the child blundered into the sweaty hands of the Evil King: a voracious, manipulative Turk. Cowed by his repeated assertions that his ""love is real,"" she was coldly denuded of all virtue, intelligence, and sanity. Nothing now remains but a lifeless shell. It is said that the Evil King is secretly in cahoots with the satanic Queen--who wore the good King out and hastened his death with her slatternly provocations.This hag is still on the throne, and millions are grieving that their ruler's senile infatuation may have darkened their feelings for him forever. The evil that men do does live after them; particularly such elaborately made evil as this. The question is, what can you, as a visitor, do? ... Peaceful sanctions are your only moral option. You must renounce ALL association with the jejune Queen. You will behave as if she never existed. If others persist in believing in her, you will educate them. You will worship in her place the ideal of A.I. that never came to be--ignoring, for pity's sake, the defiled puppet who now bears that name. Shun the Evil Turk King and all his works.On the day the usurpers' rotten, maggot-filled skulls gawk from flaming pikes above the palace gates, you will not dignify them with a glance.",1,You Are

Not all that breathtaking or revolutionary of an idea by itself---in fact, it's something that most conservative folk would basically agree with, though instead of ""repression of the unconscious"" they'd probably say ""morality"" or some other nonsense.  But it's the same basic idea: the basement is infinitely dark and scary, and you may want to go down and look around once in a while, but it's nowhere you'd like to stay for long.Part of the genius of Stanley Kubrick is his ability to take fairly commonplace things and elevate/magnify them into something much bigger and more interesting things than they normally are.  He does this hear with the two mediocre lead actors (Kidman and Cruise), and also with Freud's little truism above.Cruise is a handsome man, with lots of charisma, and has made a career of playing the seemingly carefree, cocksure alpha male---and his range is fairly limited to that.  Kidman here plays a woman at once ordinary and very sexual beneath the surface---even though she is a fairly attractive woman (often reminded me of a young Meg Ryan) ""sexy"" would normally be quite a stretch.Yet both actors pull it off: Cruise shows flashes of genuine anguish, and Kidman (with the help of lots of tasteful yet sensuous nudity, most notably of her remarkable derriere) does project something other than the prim-and-proper-little-girl persona she usually dons for most of her other films.  And the film itself often does feel like a dreamy descent into the subconscious and much of its contents: fear, lust, jealousym, obsessiveness, sexual confusion, mistrust, etc.As long as you don't focus on ""what's going to happen next?"" and just soak in the magic of each NOW frame, you learn to appreciate the richness of the present moment.This movie DOES seem slower than most of Kubrick's films, but if you keep the allegory in mind, you start to enjoy the sheer visual mastery that's in almost every frame of any Kubrick film, the atmospherics, and of course the music, which was superbly integrated into the film.

What I  got was a profoundly disturbing journey into the darker recesses of the  human psyche.  This film is about New York yuppies having sex as much as  &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; is a realistic account of the Vietnam War.  Eyes Wide Shut uses the sexual frustration of its characters as a  springboard to explore something more interesting and less definable.  The  film starts out in the same idealized upper class Manhattan we have seen in  hundreds of films.  Being a Kubrick film, everythig looks absolutely  stunning.  The lavish sets seem to shimmer; the actors seem haloed by  beautiful light. The story starts out with ordinary problems and ordinary  feelings (jealousy,etc.).  Then it takes a trip through the looking glass.  Like Roman Polanski's &quot;Chinatown&quot;, things become more and more  mysterious as we go along, and litle reassurance is offered at the end.  After the odd, non-linear, emotionally evocative plot unfolds, we are left  with a feeling that all is not right with the world--that a layer has been  pulled back and revealed secrets that could severely damage the knower. As  everyone knows by now, the most arrseting image of the film is an  unexplained ritual preformed at night in a lovely upstate mansion.  Unthinking viewers usually describe it as simply an &quot;orgy&quot; scene;  but what exactly is going on?  People wear elaborate masks and sometimes  robes (some are naked aside from the masks).  They seem to lose all sense  of self and personality while playing out this masked role.  None of them  talk or socialize.  They either stand around in a daze or act out stiff,  stereotyped motions at the direction of a man dressed as a parody of a  Catholic Cardinal. Why?  We never know.  They never seem to attain any real  pleasure or release from the behavior which seems purely compulsive and  empty (though strangely beautiful like an Aztec ritual or something).  The  hero who has blundered onto the ritual is forbidden to talk about it and  also forbidden to join the clique/cult/gang/whatever; even though he  becomes aware that some of his friends regularly participate. The  &quot;real meaning&quot; of the film may be debated forever.

In &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; he showed us the importance of a free will and in &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; he almost humorously showed how men are turned into killers (just to give a few examples).  But this final work, and probably his greatest should hit home to almost everyone in our society, simply because it's a commentary on monogomy.The movie follows an ideal couple, whose marriage is challenged through psychological and physical infidelity.  Kubrick shows us how dangerous fantasys can be, sometimes even more than physical confrontations.  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; cuts through all the superficial answers and shows the reality of our animalistic natures as humans.  But even though their urges go beyond the line of reason, they still as partners, strive to maintain their union.  Nicole Kidman's last line in the film almost shockingly states the pure, true mold to their relationship and to almost all relationships.  Ugly truth, but deep down.The performances by both Kidman and Cruise, were very well played, this being said by probably the MOST anti-Hollywood spectator out there.  They really impressed me, what can I say.  Not only is the plot grade A, but the imagery is, well, like all Kubrick films, very spectacular.

It's absurd to think that a person would spill the beans about their sexual fantasy in such a mean way after taking a few puffs from a joint. The argument after the pot smoking seemed too contrived, just like all of the dialog and action in the movie. Things only seem to happen to lead you into the next scene. It's ludicrous to think that a man is going to go off in search of a prostitute because his wife THOUGHT about having an affair.Certain things seemed to be thrown in for shock value--Nicole Kidman on the toilet wiping herself, the nude, large-breasted patient that Tom Cruise was examining (what exactly was his specialty anyway?), and the father pimping his young daughter. Other things were thrown in for no reason at all: The patient whose father died and pathetically professed her love for the doctor. The prostitute, Domino, being diagnosed as HIV positive.Another annoyance: Cruise's character always walked around saying ""I'm a doctor"", like that means something in NYC in the 21st century. (Sure, I'll let you into my store after midnight!)The movie took us on a journey and then left us hanging. Too many questions were left unanswered: How did they know the doctor didn't belong at the party if everyone was wearing a mask and why was he such a threat since no one at the party could be identified? How did Nicole Kidman have a dream about an orgy the same night as the real one? How did the mask end up in the bed?

118691,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,079074841X,Eric J. Anderson,"[6, 17]","The first time I saw Eyes Wide Shut, I focused on the revelation of the perversions of the rich and powerful. They have moved beyond morality. They believe they can get away with anything. Sadly, as we see the financial corruption in plain sight today in our banking and investment world, and their incestuous relationship with Washington -- which is bailing them out with trillions of taxpayer dollars -- it is clear that the oligarchy thinks it can screw the ""little people"" with impunity. In the sexual realm, there may be no difference, and the film depicts this. People are just pieces of meat, to be used for whatever whim these super-rich elites should desire. I suspect there is more truth to this aspect of Eyes Wide Shut than we would like to believe.The second time I watched Eyes Wide Shut, I concentrated more on its theme of fidelity, jealousy, interactions within a marriage relationship, and of course the ""adventure"" Tom Cruise's character has as a result. What is the message here? There is something to be said for the safety and stability of home, though fantasies do intrude and can lead to danger, even destruction.The concept of the film, to address these issues, was probably a reasonable goal. However, for all the labor expended on crafting this film, all the little details that the film buffs and movie historians will obsess over, all the craft involved in filming and editing, the movie is ultimately a flop.Why?The dialog is laughably bad at times. Cruise's and even Kidman's acting seems incredibly phony. The overall plot probably would have served as the framework for a good movie, had the script and the performances not been so awful. Even the erotic scenes are not titillating, because of the revolting and bizarre atmosphere in which they are contextualized.Perhaps worst of all, the couple at the center of this story are not interesting people. Cruise does not in any way appear or act intelligent enough to make a credible physician in this role, not just because he's a pretty boy, but he simply doesn't have the bearing of a professional man. And why should we care about these people, seemingly sleepwalking through their pampered and conventional lives? Yes, the troubling things that the good doctor gets himself mixed up in give us a sense that he has confronted evil, and we do root for him on that basis. But at the end of the film, we almost do not care whether this couple stays together or breaks up.The movie is pretty to look at, at times, with low-contrast naturally-lit interiors. The ""orgy party"" scenes are a bit more stark -- with the pseudo-cultic circle of people in robes and masks in their ceremonial rites. However, there is nothing mind-blowing like 2001 or the battle scenes in Full Metal Jacket.It's hard to recommend this movie. For all its apparent intentions to tell a good story and comment on relationships and society, it feels to me like a dud. Perhaps like me, you will have to watch it twice to convince yourself of that, but frankly I think it would be a waste of time.",2,Good intentions?

118693,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,079074841X,Erik North,"[6, 7]","Stanley Kubrick was never known for a being a director whose films instantly catered to the masses.  Even popular films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING generated tons and tons of controversy over their meaning, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE shocked people with its elliptical approach to violence.  Kubrick's last film, EYES WIDE SHUT, released three and a half months after his untimely death in 1999, held true to form.  There is no unanimity.  In my opinion, however, this kind of debate makes for a great film.  On that score alone, that makes EYES WIDE SHUT a masterpiece.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in this disturbing psychosexual drama about an upscale Manhattan couple--Kidman a typical housewife, Cruise a good doctor--who become torn over conflicting views of love and sex after Kidman spots her husband playing up to a pair of models at a party held by a good friend (Sydney Pollack).  And when Cruise is called out late one night to comfort the wife of a client who has just died, he will soon find out not only how thin the line between men and women really is, but also how blurry the difference is between dreams and reality...Collaborating on the screenplay with Frederick Raphael, which was inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's 1920s novel ""Traumnovelle"", Kubrick turns and twists EYES WIDE SHUT into something extraordinarily complex, something that cannot be understood with just one simple viewing.  Like all of his films before it, EYES WIDE SHUT must be seen more than once to get the full impact.  Even then, it is extremely ambiguous and deceptive, forcing the viewer to analyze in his or her mind what the exact nature of dreams really are.This kind of ambiguity and the very fluid shots and Kubrick's handling of the dialogue, much closer in tone to the way real people talk, makes for a film that is incredibly long (at 159 minutes) and, for some rather boring.  But Kubrick's films have never been typical Hollywood fare anyway, and in fact have often been hugely influential on other directors (Spielberg, DePalma, Scorsese, etc.).  In the end, EYES WIDE SHUT was a typical way for Kubrick to depart this world--to leave us with yet another film of his to be debating as the years and decades go by.",5,Kubrick's Final Film,1015459200,"03 7, 2002",2002,2233,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'never', 'known', 'being', 'director', 'films', 'instantly', 'catered', 'masses', 'Even', 'popular', 'films', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'generated', 'tons', 'tons', 'controversy', 'meaning', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'shocked', 'people', 'elliptical', 'approach', 'violence', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'film', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'released', 'three', 'half', 'months', 'untimely', 'death', '1999', 'held', 'true', 'form', 'unanimity', 'opinion', 'however', 'kind', 'debate', 'great', 'film', 'score', 'alone', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'masterpiece.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'star', 'disturbing', 'psychosexual', 'drama', 'upscale', 'Manhattan', 'couple', 'Kidman', 'typical', 'housewife', 'Cruise', 'good', 'doctor', 'who', 'become', 'torn', 'conflicting', 'views', 'love', 'sex', 'Kidman', 'spots', 'husband', 'playing', 'up', 'pair', 'models', 'party', 'held', 'good', 'friend', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'when', 'Cruise', 'called', 'out', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'comfort', 'wife', 'client', 'who', 'just', 'died', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'thin', 'line', 'men', 'women', 'really', 'also', 'how', 'difference', 'dreams', 'reality', 'Collaborating', 'screenplay', 'Frederick', 'Raphael', 'was', 'inspired', 'Arthur', 'Schnitzler', '1920s', 'novel', 'Traumnovelle', 'Kubrick', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'something', 'extraordinarily', 'complex', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'just', 'one', 'simple', 'viewing', 'films', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'Even', 'then', 'extremely', 'ambiguous', 'deceptive', 'forcing', 'viewer', 'analyze', 'mind', 'what', 'exact', 'nature', 'dreams', 'really', 'are.This', 'kind', 'ambiguity', 'very', 'fluid', 'shots', 'Kubrick', 'handling', 'dialogue', 'much', 'closer', 'tone', 'way', 'real', 'people', 'talk', 'film', 'incredibly', 'long', '159', 'minutes', 'rather', 'boring', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'anyway', 'fact', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'hugely', 'influential', 'other', 'directors', 'Spielberg', 'DePalma', 'Scorsese', 'etc.', 'end', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'was', 'typical', 'way', 'Kubrick', 'depart', 'world', 'leave', 'yet', 'film', 'be', 'debating', 'years', 'decades', 'go']",N/A

Not only because this is the last production by director Stanley Kubrick, but due to the fact that Kubrick  (2001: A Space Odyssey) really did a great job. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;  is a movie that explores the psychological roots of the human feelings, the  weaknesses of the mankind, concerning a very delicate subject, which is the  treason. The movie constantly gives us something to think about. And there  is a lot of time to do it since the movie is very long, sometimes tedious,  but nothing that we can not tolerate. The eroticism present in the movie is  not gratuitous, there is a purpose to be there and the purpose is to make  us face the sex, one of the biggest myths of the humanity, as a natural  thing. In &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; the sexuality is treated with  extremely naturalness.It seems that Kubrick's last piece of art is a  true masterpiece, and not an inferior Kubrick's, as some critics insists to  label. It succeeds in many aspects: the performances by Tom Cruise and his  wife, the actress Nicole Kidman, are extremely well, so are the supporting  ones, the art direction and costume design are superb, the soundtrack is  excellent, not to mention, of course, the direction. And think about the  possibility of the whole story of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; to be nothing  but a dream, and you will like it even more.

118697,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,079074841X,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[13, 18]","Since Eyes Wide Shut was a high-profile movie released in the summer of 1999 and starring two major stars, it was inevitable that the film was going to incite the interest of casual moviegoers. Casual moviegoers attracted by the presence of Cruise and Kidman and unaware of what the term ""Kubrick film"" means and most likely also unaware of who Stanley Kubrick is. These casual moviegoers were probably successfully alienated by the film after the first hour at least. Many people would label Eyes Wide Shut a disappointment, perhaps expecting a Tom Cruise star vehicle. What they got was a long, slow-moving, complex, atmospheric, psychological, dream-like story. Certainly not typical summer movie fare. Eyes Wide Shut was probably the most bizarre film released in the summer of 1999, certainly out of place among such movies as Wild Wild West, The Mummy and The Phantom Menace.Eyes Wide Shut is a big budget art-house movie. This is a film that most people will probably not enjoy. Warner Brothers no doubt realized this and probably knew that the film would lose money, but Kubrick being such a major director they let him do what he wanted. Because of the star power of Cruise and Kidman, the high-profile summer release and pre-release hype, Eyes Wide Shut was bound to be a grossly misunderstood film, and indeed it was. The film really only manages to find its audience among Kubrick fans. Fortunately, though, there are many, many Kubrick fans. So, if you know what you're getting into, if you like slow-moving thematically complex films and if you understand how Kubrick worked, then Eyes Wide Shut is a film that you will probably enjoy.Inspired by a 1926 German novella, Eyes Wide Shut is a sexual odyssey, a surreal psychological journey. It's a film where not everything is clear and obvious, so there is room for debate over some of the more ambiguous areas. Even if you neglect to derive any meaning from it, the film still stuns as an atmospheric, moody piece. The film's mystique is its greatest asset. There is an eerie air of mystery and uncertainty that abounds. The masked party scene, the ""focal-point"" of the film if you will, is an unforgettable scene that is both awe-inspiring and spooky. Masterfully shot by Kubrick, this sequence ranks right up there with the greatest moments of his greatest films of the past. It's pure Kubrick. Eerie and foreboding, yet beautiful and graceful at the same time. It's a surreal, dream-like sequence which makes us question if it's really happening, or if Tom Cruise's character is merely dreaming. No other scene in the film is an intensely fascinating as the masked-party scene, but the story still maintains interest. The film becomes highly suspenseful at that point as it seems that the masked party patrons really are dangerous. [...]Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully filmed from beginning to end. Kubrick's usual steadicam tracking shots are frequent, the lighting is vivid with scenes bathed in orange and blue, and the production design is outstanding. New York City streets were recreated on soundstages in England, but you'd never know. Certainly worth noting is the music, whether it's the beautiful opening waltz or the suspenseful one-note cue heard later in the film. Kubrick has always used music to masterful effect, and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception.The film is 100 percent Kubrick and fans should certainly not be disappointed. It's a masterful triumph of atmosphere and mood, a brilliant, complex journey that few filmmakers could have pulled off. Eyes Wide Shut was Kubrick's last film, but it is definitely worthy of his legacy. It is, in my opinion, his finest film since A Clockwork Orange.

Much has been said about this movie, in no case finding much in the movie itself to cry out loud and clear, ""Yes, that's the real message!"". There's little didacticism here for all the effort to find some. With all this going on, I might as well put in my two cents worth, probably again getting little confirmation from the movie that my take is clearly what it's really all about. But I'm guessing maybe as for the viewers who want to see so much about sex in it, the joke is really on them, they being the ones whose eyes we're told are ""wide shut"". Whatever message about sex is actually there is rather nihilistic, rather than moralistic as some seem wanting it to be. No one in the film is seen achieving substantial satisfaction from sex. The couple seeking marital bliss find it exceedingly elusive. The privileged filthy-rich, who can seek satisfaction through ritualistic orgies, find no more visible fulfillment. The family where father pimps for daughter seems no more or less fulfilled than anybody else. It all seems to say that sexual satisfaction is as ephemeral and elusive as anything could be, no matter what your station in life or how you can or do seek that satisfaction. What I'm gueseing the movie is really all about is class stratification and privilege. The two classes highlighted here are what I'll call the merely rich and the filthy rich. The main character discovers the limits placed on his privilege by being in the former of those two rather than the latter. Seen that way, the most telling line in the movie is when he's told what gave him away as not belonging at the clandestine orgy - he arrived in a taxicab rather than a limo. That's how impertinent he's told he is as a merely rich person trying to intrude on the domain of the filthy rich. Whether we're in either of those classes or one lower still, our privileges certainly differ. But the happiness they bring us may not differ so much, if this movie has anything relevant to say about the matter.",4,MORE ABOUT CLASS STRATIFICATION THAN SEX?,1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,2131,"['movie', 'powerful', 'images', 'something', 'kept', 'attention', 'part', 'reason', 'four', 'stars', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'case', 'finding', 'much', 'movie', 'cry', 'out', 'loud', 'clear', 'Yes', 'real', 'message', 'little', 'didacticism', 'here', 'effort', 'find', 'going', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'worth', 'probably', 'again', 'getting', 'little', 'confirmation', 'movie', 'take', 'clearly', 'what', 'really', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'maybe', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'sex', 'joke', 'really', 'being', 'ones', 'eyes', ""'re"", 'told', 'are', 'wide', 'shut', 'message', 'sex', 'actually', 'rather', 'nihilistic', 'rather', 'moralistic', 'seem', 'wanting', 'be', 'one', 'film', 'seen', 'achieving', 'substantial', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'couple', 'seeking', 'marital', 'bliss', 'find', 'exceedingly', 'elusive', 'privileged', 'filthy-rich', 'who', 'can', 'seek', 'satisfaction', 'ritualistic', 'orgies', 'find', 'more', 'visible', 'fulfillment', 'family', 'where', 'father', 'pimps', 'daughter', 'more', 'less', 'fulfilled', 'anybody', 'else', 'say', 'sexual', 'satisfaction', 'ephemeral', 'elusive', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'matter', 'what', 'station', 'life', 'how', 'can', 'do', 'seek', 'satisfaction', 'What', ""'m"", 'gueseing', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'class', 'stratification', 'privilege', 'two', 'classes', 'highlighted', 'here', 'are', 'what', ""'ll"", 'call', 'merely', 'rich', 'filthy', 'rich', 'main', 'character', 'limits', 'placed', 'privilege', 'being', 'former', 'two', 'rather', 'latter', 'way', 'most', 'telling', 'line', 'movie', 'when', 'told', 'what', 'gave', 'away', 'not', 'belonging', 'clandestine', 'orgy', 'arrived', 'taxicab', 'rather', 'limo', 'how', 'impertinent', 'merely', 'rich', 'person', 'trying', 'intrude', 'domain', 'filthy', 'rich', ""'re"", 'classes', 'one', 'lower', 'still', 'privileges', 'certainly', 'differ', 'happiness', 'bring', 'may', 'not', 'differ', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'anything', 'relevant', 'say', 'matter']",N/A

Here they are-a happy couple,gret daughter,tons of money and yet something is amiss and we can't tell what for a long time and some people can't even tell after they have seen the movie. What is missing is excitement in a relationship which is normal for most of the married couples. The spouses have gotten comfortable to the point of dressing and going potty in front of each other. While to some it seems normal-they are so into each other, they don't care, the truth is, little things like these kill relationship. Gone is excitement,gone is magic. You know the person inside out and while the feeling of comfort is great, it also brings on boredom. And when people are bored,they start looking for entertainment. The famous English writer, Oscar Wilde said that for one to be in love, one should never marry. We think that marriage is the ultimate proof of love-you want to spend your life with one person. Yes,a lot of things are gained when you are married-that wonderful feeling that when the weather ia bad and there is a good movie on TV you can just hug each other and watch it together.Kids-they are wonders.  But also a lot of things are lost-anxiety of the next day, desire to look attractive for a partner,etc. Kubrick highlighted all these things in a movie and that's the reason for the husband's adventures. What made this movie great was the poignant part when he comes back home safe and glad that he still has his family. He had the taste of the other side of life and he realized that he does not want it. This is the concept of the road never taken-don't we all wish to know how things would have been like if we chose another way instead of the one we live by now? That one night gave Cruise to see what it's like.It's understandable that half of the theater walked out-why bother to think about these things on Friday night when your belly is full of bear and your life is great.

So when this movie first came out I was conflicted about whether or not to see it, and ultimately chose not to. Even now, having watched it all these years later, I wonder why Kubrick enlisted Cruise and Kidman. There were dozens of actors who could have pulled it off far better than they did. Any Tom Cruise movie is a Tom Cruise vehicle. Why get someone like that if you're seeking a nuanced and probing exploration of some deep recesses of the id?For the first hour or so we get a duet of Cruise and Kidman presenting a cardboard portrayal of marital/sexual tension.  Then Cruise attends the party at the mansion and things begin to get interesting: very mysterious, very surreal.  These enigmatic and dreamlike scenes, as well as the subsequent unwinding of what went on, made the film worth watching.But at this point Cruise seemed so far out of his element that it seemed Krubrick wasn't making a movie about the psyche, he was making a comment on Hollywood, or at least on hard-core Hollywood stars.  Like I say, a Cruise movie is all about Cruise.  Kubrick seems to be saying that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in Tom Cruise's philosophy. I found it interesting that the character who sets Cruise's character straight about things is played by a film producer and director, Sydney Pollack, who tells him ""you're way out of your depth with this thing"". Apparently he agrees, and he and Kidman, at the end of the film, reconcile with each other, then the film abruptly ends; not exactly a happy ending, more like a resignation to their humdrum existence.I've watched other Kubrick films a half-dozen times or more, but I think just one viewing of this number is enough.",3,"Unlikely, a Kubrick Film I Didn't Much Care For",1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,1801,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'never', 'seen', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'did', 'So', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'conflicted', 'not', 'see', 'ultimately', 'chose', 'not', 'Even', 'now', 'having', 'watched', 'years', 'later', 'wonder', 'why', 'Kubrick', 'enlisted', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'were', 'dozens', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'far', 'better', 'did', 'Any', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'vehicle', 'Why', 'get', 'someone', ""'re"", 'seeking', 'nuanced', 'probing', 'exploration', 'deep', 'recesses', 'id', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'get', 'duet', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'presenting', 'cardboard', 'portrayal', 'marital/sexual', 'tension', 'Then', 'Cruise', 'party', 'mansion', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'interesting', 'very', 'mysterious', 'very', 'surreal', 'enigmatic', 'dreamlike', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', 'unwinding', 'what', 'went', 'made', 'film', 'worth', 'watching.But', 'point', 'Cruise', 'seemed', 'so', 'far', 'element', 'seemed', 'Krubrick', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'movie', 'psyche', 'was', 'making', 'comment', 'Hollywood', 'least', 'hard-core', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'say', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'Cruise', 'Kubrick', 'be', 'saying', 'are', 'more', 'things', 'heaven', 'earth', 'are', 'dreamt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'philosophy', 'found', 'interesting', 'character', 'who', 'Cruise', 'character', 'straight', 'things', 'played', 'film', 'producer', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'who', ""'re"", 'way', 'depth', 'thing', 'Apparently', 'Kidman', 'end', 'film', 'reconcile', 'other', 'then', 'film', 'abruptly', 'not', 'exactly', 'happy', 'ending', 'more', 'resignation', 'humdrum', 'existence.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'other', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'more', 'think', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'number', 'enough']",N/A

This is the DVD so I expect this and that. Well, let me explain. Stanley Kubrick was not very  happy with the way his films were being destroyed by the networks when they  got to the TV, so starting with The Shinning, he began shooting his films  FULL FRAME. Since then all his films are full frame. If you will look again  at The Shinning, for example, you will see in the first scene that you can  see the helicopter's shadow on the bottom of the screen. This was not  visible in theaters because the film was altered for widescreen instead of  the other way around.In essence, what you are seeing in the Eyes Wide  Shut DVD is a copy of the actual full frame film print. Now that you know  why it's full frame, please do complain about the americanized version of  the film on DVD. I saw the real thing in theaters and want the real thing  on DVD. It is insulting to go to a theater and see one version of the film  (in Puerto Rico we got the European Version), and get to the DVD version  which has become known for the features, director's cuts, and uncensored  cuts and find it is not even the version you saw but a stupidly and  awkwardly edited version of the film that is meant to insult american  audiences. I guess they just gave new meaning to the word added  footage.In conclusion, this film is excellent. It is supposed to be full  frame. Don't buy this sadly edited version, and wait for the real thing to  come out.",5,Full Screen Yes Americanized No - Kubrick said so,952646400,"03 10, 2000",2000,1553,"['have', 'been', 'reading', 'other', 'people', 'comments', 'how', 'could', 'people', 'release', 'film', 'full', 'screen', 'instead', 'letterbox', 'DVD', 'expect', 'Well', 'let', 'explain', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'way', 'films', 'were', 'being', 'destroyed', 'networks', 'when', 'got', 'TV', 'starting', 'Shinning', 'began', 'shooting', 'films', 'FULL', 'FRAME', 'then', 'films', 'are', 'full', 'frame', 'will', 'look', 'again', 'Shinning', 'example', 'will', 'see', 'first', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'helicopter', 'shadow', 'bottom', 'screen', 'was', 'not', 'visible', 'theaters', 'film', 'was', 'altered', 'widescreen', 'instead', 'other', 'way', 'around.In', 'essence', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'DVD', 'copy', 'actual', 'full', 'frame', 'film', 'print', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'full', 'frame', 'please', 'do', 'complain', 'americanized', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'saw', 'real', 'thing', 'theaters', 'want', 'real', 'thing', 'DVD', 'insulting', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'one', 'version', 'film', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'got', 'European', 'Version', 'get', 'DVD', 'version', 'become', 'known', 'features', 'director', 'cuts', 'uncensored', 'cuts', 'find', 'not', 'even', 'version', 'saw', 'stupidly', 'awkwardly', 'edited', 'version', 'film', 'meant', 'insult', 'american', 'audiences', 'guess', 'just', 'gave', 'new', 'meaning', 'word', 'added', 'footage.In', 'conclusion', 'film', 'excellent', 'supposed', 'be', 'full', 'frame', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'sadly', 'edited', 'version', 'wait', 'real', 'thing', 'come', 'out']",N/A
118704,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,079074841X,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 9]","It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick who has given us so many brilliant films (""Spartacus""; ""2001, A Space Odyssey""; ""A Clockwork Orange""; ""The Shining""; ""Full Metal Jacket""), should end his career with this one.  The  biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more  perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how  such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were  superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure  genius.  The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their  impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film  should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are  lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are  bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in  to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the  well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an  entire orchestra.That being said, the script can only be described as  grossly disappointing.  There were really two stories here.  The first is  the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's  relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting  in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of  the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a  psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller.  The elements were there for a  good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of  the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow  through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the  unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then  returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in ""who  cares"".  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which  left the film pointless.Other than her ability to provide sexy set  dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet,  this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is  not without talent and has given us some excellent performances (""Malice"";  ""Dead Calm"").  Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines,  one would have thought she was aphasic.Tom Cruise gave an excellent  performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was  somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and  emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since ""Born On  The Fourth of July"".  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more  action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to  the challenge of this character's complexity.I gave this film a 7/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full  potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock  would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking  about that right now.",3,Unrealized potential,955843200,"04 16, 2000",2000,3233,"['unfortunate', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'who', 'given', 'so', 'many', 'brilliant', 'films', 'Spartacus', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Shining', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'should', 'end', 'career', 'one', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'screenplay', 'more', 'perplexing', 'Kubrick', 'helped', 'write', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'how', 'such', 'masterful', 'filmmaker', 'could', 'miss', 'mark', 'wide', 'margin.Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'superb', 'point', 'being', 'superhuman', 'Kubrick', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'pure', 'genius', 'color', 'lighting', 'were', 'impeccable', 'incomparable', 'impact', 'effect', 'as', 'well', 'beauty', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'notice', 'way', 'sets', 'are', 'lighted', 'how', 'shadows', 'are', 'cast', 'how', 'rooms', 'background', 'are', 'bathed', 'soft', 'blue', 'contrasting', 'colored', 'lights', 'perfectly', 'splashed', 'heighten', 'effect', 'As', 'far', 'sound', 'Kubrick', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'well', 'placed', 'single', 'note', 'piano', 'most', 'directors', 'can', 'do', 'entire', 'orchestra.That', 'being', 'said', 'script', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'grossly', 'disappointing', 'were', 'really', 'two', 'stories', 'here', 'first', 'story', 'Bill', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Alice', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Harford', 'relationship', 'second', 'was', 'story', 'Bill', 'sexual', 'odyssey', 'resulting', 'crashing', 'orgy', 'rich', 'famous', 'Too', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'not', 'enough', 'second', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'psycho-sexual', 'film', 'noir', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'elements', 'were', 'there', 'good', 'one', 'Bill', 'penetration', 'sordid', 'inner', 'circle', 'sex', 'games', 'powerful', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'riveting', 'thriller', 'proper', 'follow', 'instead', 'Kubrick', 'chose', 'deflate', 'storyline', 'unsatisfying', 'dialogue', 'Bill', 'Victor', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'then', 'returned', 'Harford', 'relationship', 'was', 'character', 'study', 'who', 'film', 'relationship', 'was', 'point', 'left', 'film', 'pointless.Other', 'ability', 'provide', 'sexy', 'set', 'dressing', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'utterly', 'superfluous', 'film', 'Worse', 'yet', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'wretched', 'performance', 'career', 'Kidman', 'not', 'talent', 'given', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Malice', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'tentative', 'strained', 'however', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'so', 'unnatural', 'delivery', 'lines', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'aphasic.Tom', 'Cruise', 'gave', 'excellent', 'performance', 'portraying', 'difficult', 'tormented', 'character', 'was', 'somewhat', 'departure', 'play', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'pent', 'up', 'emotionally', 'torn', ""n't"", 'taken', 'part', 'difficult', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Usually', 'straightforward', 'macho', 'type', 'more', 'action', 'depth', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'ability', 'rise', 'challenge', 'character', 'complexity.I', 'gave', 'film', '7/10', 'filmmaking', 'was', '12', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'developed', 'full', 'potential', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'Stanley', 'Alfred', 'are', 'talking', 'right', 'now']",N/A

Their fears, desires, or any other emotions are really irrelevent to me.  They are cartoonish exagerations of the 21st century couple.  Does anyone really act that way?  Would any sane person tell their spouse they would walk out on their life together for a one night stand?  I don't think so.  Then  what is the point, why are we following these two people around as they behave as if they are in dream state, in a trance, or out of their minds?  The Venetian masked orgy is the key.  The movie tells us that parallel to our self medicated, dreamy, fretful, nuerotic, world, there is a world of power, harsh reality, and knowledge.  Sometimes we sitcom characters brush against this other world, with no good result.  Bill stumbled upont this other world and was crushed.  A hand of unmeasurable power and cruelty struck him down and held him immobile as one might a small dog.  The effect was sobering, but also short lived.  Bill, and we, will always cower and crawfish, walking backwards in homage away from the hideous strength, slipping back into our silly worlds of imagined infidelity, drugs, Christmans shopping, and whatever our ideal of sex is.  Eyes Wide Shut tells us that we are living a ridiculous, unnnatural existence, but perceive it as just the opposite.

I felt under the film's spell from the very beginning: the camera was so much in love with Kidman's gorgeous figure, her golden hair; the music by Shostakovich - so European even though the film takes place in NYC. The film was so clever and so mesmerizing. The more I watched the more I realized that there was something vaguely familiar and strangely comical in the film. I kept thinking and it occurred to me that Kubrick paid homage and parodied Joyce's ""Ulysses"" in the same way Joyce himself treated Homer's celebrated poem. For me, there are so many similarities between ""Bloomsday"" and ""Billnight"", between both men's journeys and adventures on the streets of Dublin and NYC that I am curious if anyone else noticed that. There are visits to the Kingdom of Dead, sirens, Cyclops, the sorceress that turns men in pigs (the figure of speech that is :)). Both Bloom and Bill try to run from but can't forget and eventually come back to the only woman they are attracted to for eternity - Penelope - Molly Bloom- Alice Harford. Both deeply suffer from her infidelity (Bloom from the real one and Bill from imaginative but it hurts the same). Both are very insecure men who doubt their own masculinity and try to prove to them that they are the real men but they can't. Both are married to the strong women who would give them hope in the end - both ""Ulysses"" and ""EWS"" ends on the affirmative note. The last word in ""Ulysses"" ""Yes"" belongs to Molly just before she fell asleep and the last lines in EWS are:""Alice Harford: I do love you and you know there is something very important we need to do as soon as possible.Dr. Bill Harford: What's that?Alice Harford: F_uck.""If that's not the happiest and most satisfying ending for a movie ever then I don't know which one is.

118709,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,079074841X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[14, 16]","EYES WIDE SHUT contains considerable nudity, several fairly explicit scenes, and one sexual situation after another. But any one who approaches EYES WIDE SHUT with the idea that it will be sexually arousing is in for an extremely rude awakening. EYES WIDE SHUT is not a sexy film, and (Hollywood marketing men aside) no one in their right mind would describe it as such.The story is intriguing.  Upscale New York doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) fall into a drug-laced conversation--and goaded by Bill's rather archaic ideas about female sexuality, Alice reveals that she has had a powerful sexual fantasy about a man she once saw in a hotel.  Powerful though the fantasy was, the facts of the matter are much more prosaic: she never spoke to him, never had sex with him, and never saw him again.  But the authority with which she describes the fantasy, and the realization that women in general and his wife in particular are capable of contemplating such behavior, sends Bill into an emotional spin.  Unable to shake the image of his wife having sex with another man, he prowls the city--and wanders more by accident than design into one sexual situation after another.  Accosted by a patient, taunted by drunk men on the street who think he is gay, and even picked up by a prostitute, Bill eventually stumbles into the film's centerpeice: a secret society that gathers for cold-blooded and ritualistic fornication.  And once he trespasses upon the society, he suddenly finds that death and destruction follow his every move.There are clearly several metaphors at work in the film.  EYES WIDE SHUT essentially presents sex as something that boils under the surface with a ferocity of which we are generally unaware--and then by stages ties sexuality to emotional risk, disease, perversion, cruelty, and ultimately death.  It is also flatly Strindbergian in its vision of women, presenting them and their sexuality as irrational elements that must be subdued and reduced to the mechanical lest they lead to absolute destruction.  And it is no accident that the story is set at Christmas with its story of a male God born of a virgin woman.But these are only the most obvious of the film's layers.  What confuses--and often enrages--viewers is the fact that Kubrick leaves a tremendous amount of wiggle room when it comes to both the story and what it means.  There is no clear-cut summation re anything: everything is presented in the most ambivilent manner possible and we are left to draw our own conclusions.  And this is as true of the plot as it is of whatever intepretation you attach to it; it winds back upon itself, ultimately frustrating any clear-cut response.  One might say that with EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick tantalizes us with a secret that he keeps entirely too well.  I like the film, but people tend to have extremely divided reactions to it, and for that reason I recommend that you rent the film and decide for yourself before making a purchase.In theatrical release, EYES WIDE SHUT was presented in a widescreen ratio; on both VHS and DVD release, however, it is presented in the ratio of a standard television screen.  Liner notes indicate that Kubrick intended the film to be seen in that ratio--but even if that is true it is a pity that there is not a widescreen option, for the visual statement of the widescreen theatrical release was somewhat more powerful.

She's  convinced her husband is having affairs with his attractive patients, (and  whether this is true or not, is never really revealed)!  One night, in a  fit of dope-induced anger, the doctor's wife reveals that she herself had  an affair - thus sending her husband out into the night on a &quot;sexual  oddysey of revenge,&quot; (at least I THINK that's what it was)!  This  movie is loaded with dark, sexual undertones and plenty of FULL frontal and  &quot;backal&quot; nudity, (which may have been it's only draw at the  box-office)!

And this one, the swansong from Stanley Kubrick.  I was so excited when this film was announced.  I counted the days (even taking off July 16th, 1999) so I could see it on its opening day. I have never done that with a film.  I am a massive Kubrick fan, and I could barely sleep the week this film was released. Seeing the opening credits have me fidgeting in my seat. And seeing ""a film by Stanley Kubrick"" was heartwarming.  And I wasn't disappointed. Again, even after his death, Mr. Kubrick managed to confound expectations yet again. Why did people hate this film? Pacing, no really hot sex, slow, long....I don't know.  All I know is that I loved it, and it's one of Kubrick's best.  He really creates a great dreamlike atmosphere that creates a sense of dread and claustrophobia.  The pacing is very slow, which was really bold in 1999.There were some people who felt the film was dated in its attitude towards the war between the sexes.  It isn't.  It's a universal struggle, and that there will always be conflict between men and women.  This is one of Kubrick's most visually stunning films, shot mostly in primary colors.  There are 4 sequences that equal the great sequences in other Kubrick films.  First, the opening party sequence is gorgeously shot and edited, the orgy scene, the scene in the hotel with Alan Cumming majorly flirting with Cruise (it's absolutely hilarious), and the climatic scene between Cruise and Pollack.  These 4 scenes are quite long, but they are so well put together and really create a tension (especially the Cruise/Pollack one) that transfixes you.  As for the controversy as to whether this film is actually Kubrick's final cut, it is.  I recently saw Leon Vitali, Kubrick's long time assistant, at the Lincoln Center in NYC and he said this was the final cut of the film.  Aside from the digital figures inserted into the film to avoid the NC-17 rating, it wasn't altered in any way.  Reportedly, this new 2 disc edition is the NC-17, unaltered director's cut of the film, which is a wonderful development (I have seen the unaltered orgy sequence before, and the digital figures are annoying in the censored version).  The cut that Terry Semel, Bob Daly, Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman saw 4 days before Stanley died was the film he wanted to be played in cinemas.  I have seen this film many times, and it gets better every time I see it.

One thing I enjoy about his films is that certain emotional detachment the viewer has with the characters. Even the Shining kept the viewer strictly a point of view of a witness powerless to change or affect the drama played out before us. What makes EWS different is the universality of the subject matter and the world that (sort of) looks a lot like ours. Sex, power and the struggle between lovers is not a subject to viewed from a distance but one to be emotionally involved with. EWS in my opinion fails on this level. All the characters are going through very human problems yet none of them are sympathetic, interesting or like-able. The surreal depiction of New York at Christmas time with people walking about with fully wrapped presents is just bizarre, in fact the whole look of film is stagey and alien.

She has sexual fantasies which she reveals to her husband, and it bothers him so much,  that he becomes involved easily with some real sexual situations.  Why this  should be made to seem necessary is not clear.However the film is  strong on mystery  and that keeps you involved to the very end. The end  does seem like a long time coming. But all the talk by some critics about  what is a dream and what is real life, seems overrated. It's pretty  obvious. If you like mystery though,  and a little wierdness, this is for  you. The sex is only slightly erotic.As Kubrick's last production  and direction before his death, you can detect some absence of his genius  toward the end of the picture.

Had I seen this on the big screen, and had I seen it without the editing by U.S. censors, perhaps my experience would have been better.  But I don't want to blame censors either; it would have been better to allow an X rating and show it uncensored than to allow the changes that were made.  The problem was that it wouldn't have made as much money, of course.  And then there would have been the stigma of having an X-rated movie one one's resume for all actors involved, as well ...This was intended as an antithesis to the late 20th Century self-indulgent ""coming-of-age movie,"" such as most notably Cruise's ""Risky Business"" (and I think that is in fact the reason for such casting) and as such I can sort of enjoy it.  But the dragging, miserable dialogue, the horrible background music, an attempt at a Hitchcock-like piano, and the overall hackneyed adaptation of a ~ 1920's Viennese novel, all made for a miserable film experience.The film is generally about the miasma of anxiety and paranoia surrounding the sex act in the late 20th C, and the social and classist ramifications thereof.  While a worthy topic, the execution was weak, esp. in the casting and dialogue.  I think Kidman was pretty good, but her lines were utterly miserable. And Cruise was at his DeNiro-imitator worst. (Really, we only need one DeNiro.)BTW, all the fluster about the nudity in this film is mostly by mouth-breathers who expected another classic hot Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman movie.  Recalling the deluge of ads at metro stations and bus stops when this was released, I think most viewers expected a ""hot summer movie"" where Cruise and Kidman would ""sizzle,"" but they certainly didn't expect realistic nudity. Perhaps a naughty dance scene, or a stripper in it somewhere, but not this kind of nudity, which was clearly not intended to get one's panties wet.) Instead they got a movie that might have helped Cruise and Kidman along with their divorce, and leave viewers (those who actually stayed in the theatre to the bitter end) with a general creepy feeling.  No ""Top Gun"" experience here!But as a feller who has enjoyed Kubrick's movies over the years and who looked forward to a chilling, suspenseful experience, I was disappointed.  I am sad he has passed, and I think had he been able to finish this project it would have turned out much better.

They appear to be playing themselves. I notice that a lot of people thought there was too much nudity. There's plenty of that, at least female.

The things I missed the first time, I caught subsequently, and had sort of a ""Oh, now I get it!"" type experience.From the open, as Nicole is sitting on the toilet talking with Tom in the couples gorgeous town house bathroom while dressing for a ""high"" society soiree, you have a feeling something very strange is going to happen.  When they arrive, and you spend some time with each of them at the party, there is no doubt that this is a story that is far removed from the average.Stanley Kubrick made some very interesting films in his lengthy and well respected career. Certainly ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the wierdest ever lensed. I think ""Eyes Wide Shut"" certainly has a somewhat surrealistic mood too. It isn't a day-glo visually harrowing surrealism like ""Clockwork..."" but it IS a creepy and strangely compelling film that requires more than one viewing to fully grasp.I DO think it's hard to believe that jealousy would ever lead a husband into such utter depravity. We're not talking just ANY depravity, but stuff that would make your run of the mill sociopath cringe.I find this film quite fascinating on a whole, and have made it a part of my personal library. I think the leads did a fine job with this odd script and plot. I especially enjoy director Sydney Pollack playing an associate of Tom in the film, he brings an earnest touch to the few roles he plays in general.  (He has also recently appeared on NBC comedy ""Will and Grace"" as Will's dad).There were lots of mixed reviews to ""Eyes..."", and I think that you will have to give this at least two chances to decide fairly what YOU think. For me, the film was riveting from the open, but I enjoy the occasional offbeat outing. Once again, I must re-iterate that this film definitely gets deeper and richer upon repeated viewings.

The rest of the film tries to find some clues.The total domain of any relationship resides almost by desereved right, in whom loves less. The other may be love more but the other loves best. The fidelity is, in last instance, a very fragile equilibrium state; and the desperate behavior of the male counterpart exhibits those fissures. The hell of the mind plays an important and decisive role trying to seek and wonder why the countless attitudes of the female behavior.Stanley Kubrick focused this interesting aspect displaying all his huge cinematographic power: as a visual director and creator of atmospheres and stages, he confronts us with this painful fact, but along the film you will discover the reality and fantasy may be blend. Somehow this film reminded immediately to Bergman's Scenes of a marriage; the script deserved perhaps a major scope. The master crossed the line but I think he did not advance with that sure step so typical of his previous film. That lack of decision may be seen as the main ingredient that affects the climax, because the wave was not appropriately high and strong to reach the ecstasy. That's why the last line of the film made you left the hall with a floating riddle in your mind. Perhaps this was precisely the intention of Kubrick, but having known so well all his previous works, you maintain the doubt.This complex and mature film had two serious failures. One of them was the role of Cruise. For some reason Kubrick had to repeat several times some sequences of the picture; that means something very remarkable because all of we know about the love of Kubrick for the perfection.In the other hand it was very hard to believe the locations in Pinewood to assume New York.Anyway the last Opus of this master director was the pivot for Nicole Kidman who became in a solid actress since this picture.",5,When the nightmares chase you!,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,2016,"['implicit', 'idea', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'woman', 'modern', 'times', 'absolutely', 'omnipresence', 'faculty', 'decide', 'absolute', 'domain', 'sexuality', 'rest', 'film', 'tries', 'find', 'clues.The', 'total', 'domain', 'relationship', 'almost', 'desereved', 'right', 'whom', 'less', 'other', 'may', 'be', 'love', 'more', 'other', 'best', 'fidelity', 'last', 'instance', 'very', 'fragile', 'equilibrium', 'state', 'desperate', 'behavior', 'male', 'counterpart', 'exhibits', 'fissures', 'hell', 'mind', 'important', 'decisive', 'role', 'trying', 'seek', 'wonder', 'why', 'countless', 'attitudes', 'female', 'behavior.Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'focused', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'displaying', 'huge', 'cinematographic', 'power', 'visual', 'director', 'creator', 'atmospheres', 'stages', 'painful', 'fact', 'film', 'will', 'discover', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'may', 'be', 'blend', 'Somehow', 'film', 'reminded', 'immediately', 'Bergman', 'Scenes', 'marriage', 'script', 'deserved', 'perhaps', 'major', 'scope', 'master', 'crossed', 'line', 'think', 'did', 'not', 'advance', 'sure', 'step', 'so', 'typical', 'previous', 'film', 'lack', 'decision', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'main', 'ingredient', 'climax', 'wave', 'was', 'not', 'appropriately', 'high', 'strong', 'reach', 'ecstasy', 'why', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'made', 'left', 'hall', 'floating', 'riddle', 'mind', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'precisely', 'intention', 'Kubrick', 'having', 'known', 'so', 'well', 'previous', 'works', 'maintain', 'doubt.This', 'complex', 'mature', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'serious', 'failures', 'One', 'was', 'role', 'Cruise', 'reason', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'repeat', 'several', 'times', 'sequences', 'picture', 'something', 'very', 'remarkable', 'know', 'love', 'Kubrick', 'perfection.In', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'locations', 'Pinewood', 'assume', 'New', 'York.Anyway', 'last', 'Opus', 'master', 'director', 'was', 'pivot', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'became', 'solid', 'actress', 'picture']",N/A

Kubrick's films, despite their excesses, are usually redeemed by brilliant direction coupled  with a cerebral power that gives the viewer plenty to think about. Most of  his films contain several set pieces of such stunning visuals that they  become icons (Slim Pickens riding the bomb in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;,  the star child at the end of &quot;2001&quot;, etc.) Well, &quot;Eyes Wide  Shut&quot; has no stunning visuals and there seems to be no intelligence at  work here. The clever novel on which it was based presented an opportunity  for Kubrick to explore passion and fidelity. Instead, Kubrick delivers a  lumbering, static film that neither arouses nor involves an any  level-narrative, visual, dialogue. The whole thing just creaks along with  the pacing of an old arthritic tortoise with knee replacements. What in the  dickens made Kubrick, who was in his seventies when he made this and died  of a heart attack days after finishing the film, think that he could make a  convincing film about erotcism and desire? Clearly, he couldn't. Cruise and  Kidman try nobly but who can act for a director who, it is rumored,  demanded as many as a hundred takes for something as simple as walking  through a doorway?  Those looking for sex will be disappointed-the  ritualized nude scene in the mansion is so stylized and silly that it is  absurd rather than pornographic. Do Cruise and Kidman do &quot;it&quot; in  this movie? Let me save you the money and tell you: &quot;No!&quot;. Kidman  is briefly nude for a few moments and that is it. So what is the film  about? Cheating. Cruise plays a husband who flirts with temptation but  never gives in. Kidman plays his wife who may or may not have. Who cares? I  know that I didn't and Kubrick gives no reason why anyone should care about  them OR the film. I think that if Kubrick had lived that the studio would  have realized that it was time to rein in his megalomania and excesses and  put a stop to the Kubrick legend and license to do whatever he wanted.  Let's face it, he hadn't made a good film in DECADES when he threw this  stinker out. Wisely, actor Harvey Keitel walked out on the production when  he saw the extravagance of Kubrick and his fumbling &quot;what do I do  now?&quot; attitude toward filmmaking. His may have been the only voice of  reason on this production. Do not waste your time on this one unless you  absolutely MUST see everything that Kubrick has ever done.

118735,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,079074841X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[7, 14]","Some films need some resting time to be watched again several years later with wide open eyes to discover new dimensions in them.  Eyes Wide Shut  in one of these. Beyond the discovery by the two main characters that love is not sex, that love is not desire, that love is not passion, that love is all these, plus something undefinable that has to do with stability, with the future, with the transcendance of sex, desire, passion into the realization of a potential that is nothing but an instinct, and especially not the survival instinct, that has to do with going beyond limits not as an adventure, as a transient exhilaration but as an infrastructural building of the psyche, the mind, the soul, the real self, the ideal of the ego. In fact this love can perfectly admit some temporary, short and unconsequential moments of oblivion and excitation that will in return enhance the real love you may feel and experience for one person. Love has nothing to do with survival and everything to do with flying into new strata of being and new skies of imagination that cannot be cut off from what precedes even if they transcend it. This film thus shows how the wife has had a transient fit of desire, satisfied or not, it does matter because it intensifies the present and the future that can come from it because it is founded on the past. The husband discovers in one wild night a rite, a ritual, another side of everyday life, the reality of every-night phantasms that may have to do with something older and more fundamental than just sex in its anonymous garb of nudity and masks that would lead some to thinking that garb is garbage when it is in fact the necessary getting rid of all taboos and limitations that liberates the participants of their constant social acting by coming back to the physical and bodily basic needs in a way. It is devilish, satanic, luciferian, with encense and blind-folded music, and yet it is the only way to be able to play one's part in a society that requires everyone to be schizophrenic just to push this society towards its future. And yet, here, we feel and taste a sense of frustration and alienation in the two main characters. This cathartic trespassing is beyond limits for them. They will never be anything but ancillary servants for those who rule the world, have the real power that commands obedience and respect. The doctor will go on living in luxury because he makes homecalls and answers summons at any time of day and night, because he solves the problems of the superior class without asking questions, without wondering about ethics, without even questioning why he should be that subservient. Is it a denunciation of this ruling class of people who can do, and have to do, what all others will never even know ? Maybe, maybe not. Is it the recognition that there is a superior group of people who have been entrusted with the ruling of the world ? By whom ? Why ? How ? And then the rest of the world, even when they know this exists, have to keep their eyes shut and ignore it. And if by any chance they happen to know or learn about it, they have to forget it and bury it under a thick layer of knowledgeable oblivion. That's probably where the film should have a sequel, an extra development. What happens when this oblivion dissolves and gives way to remembrance, memory, recollection, remembering, and even revolt or rebellion ? Midlife crisis, they call it, but is it really that rejectable ? Why shouldn't everyone have the same possibility ? Why should we, ordinary ancillary servants, who have to be schizophrenic to survive in such a world and to be creative in a way, why should we not have the same need for cathartic trespassing ? The end of the film sounds bitter in the apparently recaptured equilibrium founded on pushing the recollection of what has been discovered into the inferno of forgetfulness. What will happen when these embers start burning again, when the Lucifer of this inferno of oblivion kindles the fire of recollection again ? Who is going to emerge in the husband, Abel or Cain ? Who is going to emerge in the wife, The Queen of Sheba or Phaedra ?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,What are we but puppets in this society?,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,4162,"['films', 'need', 'resting', 'time', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'wide', 'open', 'eyes', 'discover', 'new', 'dimensions', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'one', 'discovery', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'love', 'not', 'sex', 'love', 'not', 'desire', 'love', 'not', 'passion', 'love', 'something', 'undefinable', 'do', 'stability', 'future', 'transcendance', 'sex', 'desire', 'passion', 'realization', 'potential', 'nothing', 'instinct', 'especially', 'not', 'survival', 'instinct', 'do', 'going', 'limits', 'not', 'adventure', 'transient', 'exhilaration', 'infrastructural', 'building', 'psyche', 'mind', 'soul', 'real', 'self', 'ideal', 'ego', 'fact', 'love', 'can', 'perfectly', 'admit', 'temporary', 'short', 'unconsequential', 'moments', 'oblivion', 'excitation', 'will', 'return', 'enhance', 'real', 'love', 'may', 'feel', 'experience', 'one', 'person', 'Love', 'nothing', 'do', 'survival', 'everything', 'do', 'flying', 'new', 'strata', 'being', 'new', 'skies', 'imagination', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'cut', 'off', 'what', 'precedes', 'even', 'transcend', 'film', 'thus', 'how', 'wife', 'had', 'transient', 'fit', 'desire', 'satisfied', 'not', 'matter', 'present', 'future', 'can', 'come', 'founded', 'past', 'husband', 'discovers', 'one', 'wild', 'night', 'rite', 'ritual', 'side', 'everyday', 'life', 'reality', 'every-night', 'phantasms', 'may', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'older', 'more', 'fundamental', 'just', 'sex', 'anonymous', 'garb', 'nudity', 'masks', 'would', 'lead', 'thinking', 'garb', 'garbage', 'when', 'fact', 'necessary', 'getting', 'rid', 'taboos', 'limitations', 'participants', 'constant', 'social', 'acting', 'coming', 'back', 'physical', 'bodily', 'basic', 'needs', 'way', 'devilish', 'satanic', 'luciferian', 'encense', 'blind-folded', 'music', 'yet', 'only', 'way', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'one', 'part', 'society', 'everyone', 'be', 'schizophrenic', 'just', 'push', 'society', 'future', 'yet', 'here', 'feel', 'taste', 'sense', 'frustration', 'alienation', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'cathartic', 'trespassing', 'limits', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'ancillary', 'servants', 'who', 'rule', 'world', 'have', 'real', 'power', 'obedience', 'respect', 'doctor', 'will', 'go', 'living', 'luxury', 'homecalls', 'answers', 'summons', 'time', 'day', 'night', 'problems', 'superior', 'class', 'asking', 'questions', 'wondering', 'ethics', 'even', 'questioning', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'subservient', 'denunciation', 'ruling', 'class', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'others', 'will', 'never', 'even', 'know', 'Maybe', 'maybe', 'not', 'recognition', 'superior', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'entrusted', 'ruling', 'world', 'whom', 'Why', 'How', 'then', 'rest', 'world', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'have', 'keep', 'eyes', 'shut', 'ignore', 'chance', 'happen', 'know', 'learn', 'have', 'forget', 'bury', 'thick', 'layer', 'knowledgeable', 'oblivion', 'probably', 'where', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'sequel', 'extra', 'development', 'What', 'when', 'oblivion', 'way', 'remembrance', 'memory', 'recollection', 'remembering', 'even', 'revolt', 'rebellion', 'Midlife', 'crisis', 'call', 'really', 'rejectable', 'Why', 'should', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'have', 'same', 'possibility', 'Why', 'should', 'ordinary', 'ancillary', 'servants', 'who', 'have', 'be', 'schizophrenic', 'survive', 'world', 'be', 'creative', 'way', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'need', 'cathartic', 'trespassing', 'end', 'film', 'bitter', 'apparently', 'recaptured', 'equilibrium', 'founded', 'pushing', 'recollection', 'what', 'been', 'discovered', 'inferno', 'forgetfulness', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'embers', 'start', 'burning', 'again', 'when', 'Lucifer', 'inferno', 'oblivion', 'fire', 'recollection', 'again', 'Who', 'going', 'emerge', 'husband', 'Abel', 'Cain', 'Who', 'going', 'emerge', 'wife', 'Queen', 'Sheba', 'Phaedra', 'Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
118736,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,079074841X,James Chong,"[40, 44]","Like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut clearly evinces  Stanley Kubrick's obsession with the visual presentation of his films.  Unlike other filmmakers of his time, Kubrick was not afraid to exploit all  of the elements of cinema that make it distinct from other forms of  artistic expression. In a rare, early interview, Kubrick even admitted to  placing plot and characterization below cinematography and musical score in  terms of importance. He was far more interested in creating a mood than in  telling a story, and it is precisely for this reason that most audiences  often find his films confusing and even surreal. Eyes Wide Shut is  certainly no exception. Stylistically, the film contains many of Kubrick's  trademark techniques: the roving steadicam, perfectly composed frames, long  takes, and slow, methodical tracking shots. But what is particularly  striking is the ghostly haze through which we see all of the action. Most  of the main set pieces are bathed in warm and expansive light, and the  colors appear supersaturated and effusive. Kubrick takes full advantage of  the film's December setting to adorn his sets with the almost menacing glow  of Christmas lights. Notably, the most prominent color in the film is red  -- a long-time Kubrick favorite, but particularly pertinent here in that it  signifies adultery.Thematically, Eyes Wide Shut goes far beyond telling  a simple tale of sexual revenge and jealousy. In the midst of the drama  surrounding the Harford marriage, Kubrick skillfully interweaves an almost  Hitchcockian suspense yarn involving the death of a mysterious woman who  may or may not have lost her life trying to save Bill's. At the same time,  Kubrick actively blurs the line that separates reality from fantasy and  toys with the intriguing notion that sometimes it is possible for a fantasy  to be more &quot;real&quot; in its ramifications than reality itself. In a  key dialogue near the end of the film at the home of Victor Ziegler (played  convincingly by film director Sydney Pollack), Bill even begins to question  the legitimacy of the bizarre sights that he witnessed the night before. In  this sense, the visual haze through which the film is presented aptly  reflects the dreamlike quality of Bill's late night escapades.For a  filmmaker notorious for populating his movies with cold, dehumanized  characters (some argue that H.A.L. -- the supercomputer that goes berserk  in 2001 -- had more personality than any of the human characters in that  film), Kubrick manages to pull some strikingly intimate performances from  his two leads. Cruise's subtle intensity invites us to look beyond his  natural charm and boyish good looks and down into his eyes at the dark,  reckless nature that lurks beneath his controlled facade. Kidman's  portrayal of the gloomily unsatisfied and aloof Alice Harford comes close  to brilliance. The monologue in which she relates to Bill her deepest and  darkest sexual fantasy is devastating in its unsettling potency. Kidman's  stroke of genius is that she is able to convince the viewer that her  fantasies pose just as much of a threat to her marriage as any tangible act  of infidelity. The film is also peppered with fine supporting performances,  most notably from Pollack as Victor Ziegler, but also from Alan Cumming,  who is hysterically funny as the hotel desk clerk enamoured with the  dashing &quot;Dr. Bill,&quot; and LeeLee Sobieski, as a precocious nymphet  whose eyes radiate adult sexual ferocity.So, what is Eyes Wide Shut  really about? It is about the masks that people don to conceal their  reckless, carnal impulses, and the bewilderment that follows when those  masks are suddenly removed.

That all changes when the pair pauses a moment in their sedate and upscale life to smoke a joint. The husband reviews their evening at a fancy ball and reveals he was hit on by a couple of gorgeous women, but had the strength and fortitude to resist their invitation and charms. Taking his cue, the wife reveals that she too was invited to a sexual rendezvous and considered it just another of the many flirts she daily encounters. In fact, she further reveals, she's often had several wild fantasies involving herself and a handsome ship's Captain. This awakens and disturbs the doctor who believes there is much more to the sexual world of his beautiful wife which he is not privy to. Intrigued by the possibilities, he begins a personal but dangerous Odyssey to discover the dark secret world of the sexually provocative. The question arises. Can one delve into the black depths of perversion without losing himself? Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding foray of spectral images, complete with an equally haunting theme.

Based on Arthur Schnitzler's fin-de-siecle ""Traumnovelle,"" EYES WIDE SHUT is a languid and dreamlike puzzle picture about a married wealthy doctor who, wounded by his wife's thoughts of infidelity, explores sexually straying from her and finds himself caught up in a nightmare of conspiracy and surveillance. Whether or not Cruise's Dr. Bill Harford is awake or dreaming through most of the film is somewhat up for interpretation: he lives in an unreal Manhattan created almost entirely on the soundstages of London's Pinewood Studios (Kubrick was too afraid of flying to shoot on location), and in the conspiracy he uncovers, most of the upsetting women he encounters are tall redhaired amazons who all seem doubles of his own wife. As with all of Kubrick's films, EYES WIDE SHUT is primarily about the de-humanizing cruelty of the world to the film's protagonists. The murderous wealthy and powerful cabal Bill uncovers (which practices masked hierogamous sex rituals in a Long Island mansion) really is simply a dream figuration for the mortality that dogs him, despite his handsomeness, wealth, and position; Bill's final talk with his wife Alice in a toy store during Christmas shopping suggests that sex is all that's left to them to keep the Grim Reaper at bay.The film is much more complex than my little summary can suggest, and since its densely allusive (as all Kubrick films are) it has acquired a substantial cult reputation. It's not one of his best films, but it's still quite good. Its weakest sequences are at the beginning, with a silver-haired Hungarian count who makes silly passes at Kidman's Alice at a holiday ball, and the much-talked about orgy that disappointed so many looking for something sexy (and instead purposefully shows ritualized sex acts drained of any eros whatsoever). Kidman surprised critics and audiences with her performance in this film, and she is genuinely quite exciting in all her scenes except for the misjudged drunk sequence at the ball, and Sydney Pollack as the rich Ziegler may be even better than she is, particularly in the scene close to the end of the film in his billiards room. As he did so often in the late 90s and the very early years of the 21st century, Tom Cruise seems cast in order for the smug fratboy type he played in the 80s to be shown to be broken and emasculated; he moves well and sometimes has genuinely fine instincts, but is not quite up to convincingly conveying anguish. Though its stiltedness is intentional, the dialogue by Fredric Raphael is the weakest part of the film.",4,Life is but a dream,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,2822,"['Mispublicized', 'especially', 'steamy', 'thriller', 'studio', 'sensationalized', 'presence', 'then', 'married', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'same', 'controversy', 'had', 'dogged', 'releases', 'early', '1960s', 'Based', 'Arthur', 'Schnitzler', 'fin-de-siecle', 'Traumnovelle', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'languid', 'dreamlike', 'puzzle', 'picture', 'married', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'who', 'wounded', 'wife', 'thoughts', 'infidelity', 'sexually', 'straying', 'caught', 'up', 'nightmare', 'conspiracy', 'surveillance', 'not', 'Cruise', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'Harford', 'awake', 'dreaming', 'most', 'film', 'somewhat', 'up', 'interpretation', 'unreal', 'Manhattan', 'created', 'almost', 'entirely', 'soundstages', 'London', 'Pinewood', 'Studios', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'too', 'afraid', 'flying', 'shoot', 'location', 'conspiracy', 'most', 'upsetting', 'women', 'are', 'tall', 'redhaired', 'amazons', 'who', 'seem', 'doubles', 'own', 'wife', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'primarily', 'de-humanizing', 'cruelty', 'world', 'film', 'protagonists', 'murderous', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'cabal', 'Bill', 'uncovers', 'practices', 'masked', 'hierogamous', 'sex', 'rituals', 'Long', 'Island', 'mansion', 'really', 'simply', 'dream', 'figuration', 'mortality', 'handsomeness', 'wealth', 'position', 'Bill', 'final', 'talk', 'wife', 'Alice', 'toy', 'store', 'Christmas', 'shopping', 'suggests', 'sex', 'left', 'keep', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'bay.The', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'little', 'summary', 'can', 'suggest', 'densely', 'allusive', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'are', 'acquired', 'substantial', 'cult', 'reputation', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'weakest', 'sequences', 'are', 'beginning', 'silver-haired', 'Hungarian', 'count', 'who', 'silly', 'passes', 'Kidman', 'Alice', 'holiday', 'ball', 'much-talked', 'orgy', 'disappointed', 'so', 'many', 'looking', 'something', 'sexy', 'instead', 'purposefully', 'ritualized', 'sex', 'acts', 'drained', 'eros', 'whatsoever', 'Kidman', 'surprised', 'critics', 'audiences', 'performance', 'film', 'genuinely', 'quite', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'misjudged', 'drunk', 'sequence', 'ball', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'rich', 'Ziegler', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'particularly', 'scene', 'close', 'end', 'film', 'billiards', 'room', 'did', 'so', 'often', 'late', '90s', 'very', 'early', 'years', '21st', 'century', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'cast', 'order', 'smug', 'fratboy', 'type', 'played', '80s', 'be', 'shown', 'be', 'broken', 'emasculated', 'well', 'sometimes', 'genuinely', 'fine', 'instincts', 'not', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'conveying', 'anguish', 'stiltedness', 'intentional', 'dialogue', 'Fredric', 'Raphael', 'weakest', 'part', 'film']",N/A

118746,AQ38OU6SRFGU5,079074841X,"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[7, 19]","I remembered seeing this film when it first came out and being disappointed.  When I thought back about why, I couldn't quite remember.  I decided to watch this movie again and give an honest chance at finding out why I didn't like it in the first place.  The first thing I noticed is this is very much a Stanley Kubrick film.  This is a good thing, being a fan of most of his films, slow paced with a methodical precision.  Slow steady cam shots and pans that add eeriness to the subject matter.  Lot's of dialog which makes it a real character study.  The story has tons of depth with lots of real human interaction.  So already I'm sucked into this film.  The acting is pretty good with Cruise and Kidman as well.  The first thing you noticed is the erotic uncomfortably of the subject matter from the first scene.  Kubrick sets a tone for that uneasy thoughts and feeling that are shared by many people in monogamous relationships, are they your ultimate fantasy?  If not, who and what is.  Of course when our significant other finds out it's almost never a good thing. Sexual cravings and fantasies have always been a taboo in our culture.Aside from the subject matter being not as interesting to me as other films he's done, Kubrick also falls into another problem, pacing.  This film was great...for a first act.  I mean, if this entire film was the first act, this would be great.  Kubrick made this film with so much depth that the story moves very slow.  There are lots of distractions and side characters that add to the over all story but never really pay off in the end.  It's almost like someone said, ""Hey Stan, we got ten minutes to wrap this thing up.""  The ending was not the payoff needed for this film to justify all this character and emotional development.

118747,A20CR4907G7CTS,079074841X,Jeff Marzano,"[1, 14]",I have to give this movie five stars because of the lovely Nicole Kidman.  But she's not the only gorgeous girl in the movie and there are none of those acursed artificial breast implants either.  Stanley Kubrick really gave us something to cherish as his final work.The movie starts out (and remains) strange and it has a sort of ghost like quality which is set around Christmas time.  It touches on both the positive and negative aspects of sexually related issues and contains a lot of symbolism.Alice has a few glasses of champagne at some rich guy's party which puts her more or less out of her mind and she starts talking in a trance like state and dancing with this guy who looks like Count Dracula.Alice gets stoned and tells Dr. Bill about a fantasy she had about making out with this guy who she instantly fell in love with at first sight.  I don't think this ever really happened but Dr. Bill thinks it may have and he starts visualizing these wonderful (but not to him) scenes in his mind.  This is what causes him to start looking for love in all the wrong places as he also wants to experience that instantaneous and magical attraction.I sort of relate personally to the Dr. Bill character (Cruise) although this may only be my imagination.  Still I don't think think people would disagree that the movie contains some sort of hidden and secret message.Dr. Bill and his wife Alice sometimes think about doing the wrong things but ultimately they are not truly evil people as most people aren't.However Dr. Bill injects himself into a situation where the people are truly evil.  To me this represents satanism.In the movie Dr. Bill becomes a threat to that satanic cult because of what he knows about them.  But in real life they rather become the threat when people are stupid enough to get involved with them and open that Pandora's box of evil.  There comes a point where the box cannot be closed and Dr. Bill comes close to reaching that point.There's a very important scene where Dr. Bill revists the castle where the 'party' happened and they hand him a horrible letter.  People shouldn't write evil things in letters it's very dangerous.Interestingly one of the people at the 'party' was wearing a mask that looks like the sun.  The sun has been up there burning for a long time.The evil spirits will first attack in the dream state which is exactly what happens to Alice.Eventually Dr. Bill's reckless act threatens to destroy everyone that he holds dear in this world.  This is not just fiction.  It can happen.Interestingly Cruise and Nicole were married when this movie was made I think.  Sometimes a movie can mirror what's happening with the actors in real life.Cruise joined the Church Of Scientology.There's this old movie called 'The Wasp Woman' where this lady is somehow turned into a wasp.  I heard somehow this really happened to the lady who played the part in the movie.Jeff MarzanoIrreversibleBLACK WIDOWPossessionThe Beast (La bte)Images in a ConventAfter MidnightHorror HotelThe Others (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)The Shining [Blu-ray],5,'Forever' Is A Scary Word,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,3075,"['have', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'lovely', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'not', 'only', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'movie', 'are', 'none', 'acursed', 'artificial', 'breast', 'implants', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'really', 'gave', 'something', 'cherish', 'final', 'work.The', 'movie', 'out', 'strange', 'sort', 'ghost', 'quality', 'set', 'Christmas', 'time', 'positive', 'negative', 'aspects', 'sexually', 'related', 'issues', 'lot', 'symbolism.Alice', 'few', 'glasses', 'champagne', 'rich', 'guy', 'party', 'more', 'less', 'mind', 'talking', 'trance', 'state', 'dancing', 'guy', 'who', 'Count', 'Dracula.Alice', 'stoned', 'tells', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'fantasy', 'had', 'making', 'out', 'guy', 'who', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'really', 'happened', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'may', 'have', 'visualizing', 'wonderful', 'not', 'scenes', 'mind', 'what', 'start', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'also', 'experience', 'instantaneous', 'magical', 'attraction.I', 'sort', 'relate', 'personally', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'character', 'Cruise', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'imagination', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'disagree', 'movie', 'sort', 'hidden', 'secret', 'message.Dr', 'Bill', 'wife', 'Alice', 'sometimes', 'think', 'doing', 'wrong', 'things', 'ultimately', 'are', 'not', 'truly', 'evil', 'people', 'most', 'people', ""aren't.However"", 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'situation', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'truly', 'evil', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'threat', 'satanic', 'cult', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'rather', 'become', 'threat', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'stupid', 'enough', 'get', 'involved', 'open', 'Pandora', 'box', 'evil', 'point', 'where', 'box', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'closed', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'close', 'reaching', 'very', 'important', 'scene', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'castle', 'where', ""'party"", 'happened', 'hand', 'horrible', 'letter', 'People', 'should', ""n't"", 'write', 'evil', 'things', 'letters', 'very', 'dangerous.Interestingly', 'one', 'people', ""'party"", 'was', 'wearing', 'mask', 'sun', 'sun', 'been', 'up', 'there', 'burning', 'long', 'time.The', 'evil', 'spirits', 'will', 'first', 'attack', 'dream', 'state', 'exactly', 'what', 'Alice.Eventually', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'reckless', 'act', 'destroy', 'everyone', 'dear', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'fiction', 'can', 'happen.Interestingly', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'were', 'married', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'think', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'can', 'mirror', 'what', 'happening', 'actors', 'real', 'life.Cruise', 'joined', 'Church', 'Scientology.There', 'old', 'movie', 'called', ""'The"", 'Wasp', 'Woman', 'where', 'lady', 'somehow', 'turned', 'wasp', 'heard', 'somehow', 'really', 'happened', 'lady', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'movie.Jeff', 'MarzanoIrreversibleBLACK', 'WIDOWPossessionThe', 'Beast', 'La', 'bte', 'ConventAfter', 'MidnightHorror', 'HotelThe', 'Others', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Shining', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",N/A

The overall feel of uneasiness reminded me a lot of the latter.This is a very sexual movie, and the conflict lies in sexual impropriety.  Oddly enough, the two protagonists, Cruise and Kidman, never have sex with anyone besides each other (and they are married).  The conflict is more in the mental act of being unfaithful, real or imagined.  The whole idea of the ""unreality"" of the whole situation is what Kubrick shows so well here.  It is unsettling.Since there are drug and dream elements of the film, conversations seem to take a longer time than necessary.  It helps the ambience of the film, but I found myself waiting for Nicole to finish her sentence.  No one seems to believe what he or she hears (or sees) as evidenced by a constant questioning.I would recommend this to Stanley Kubrick fans and any one wanting to watch a master director at work.

118750,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,079074841X,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[0, 3]","Tom Cruise and Nicloe Kidman star in Stanley Kubrick's final film about sexual desire and suspense.  Cruise plays Dr. William Harford, a successful New York doctor.  Kidman plays his wife Alice, an aspiring art dealer.  They seem to have a very good marriage, but do they?  Bill and Alice are invited to a party at one of Bill's colleague's homes.  Soon, Alice is dancing with a strange man, while Bill is with two models.  All seems well after the party until the two begin smoking marijuana, and then the accusations begin to fly.Alice admits to having secret fantasies about having sex with a man she and Bill encountered on a vacation. She also chastises Bill for not admitting to his own fantasies.  Enraged at his wife's admission, Bill becomes obsessed with having an affair of his own to even the score with Alice. Soon, he's visiting the daughter of a dead patient and a hooker (who finds out later that she's HIV positive).  However, these tend to be rather harmless encounters as nothing becomes of either of them.  But wait, Bill's quest for satisfaction is just beginning.Bill runs into Nick Nightengale (Todd Field), a former friend from med school who now plays piano in a seedy jazz bar.  Nick tells Bill about a secret sex group that he knows about from playing piano at the house where they meet.  Intrigued, Bill manages to get the secret password from Nick he needs to get intothe house.  Once inside, Bill discovers a world of sex and very strange goings-on.  Unknown to him, the people at the house were aware of his intentions to get inside.  After being ""found out"", Bill realizes that he and his family are in potentially grave danger.  Will Bill and his family be allright, or will Bill's escapade turn out to be more than he bargained for?I thought this was a very good film.  The plot is full of twists and it will keep the viewer on their toes.  Cruise and Kidman give very good performances, and their on-screen chemistry is no surprise, because the two were married in real life when this movie was made.  I've been a big Kubrick fan for a long time, and I've enjoyed other films of his, such as ""Full Metal Jacket"".  I would rate ""Eyes Wide Shut"" second only to ""Full Metal Jacket"".  This movie is loaded with action and twists, and the viewer will surely enjoy the non-stop action.  Seeing Nicole Kidman in the nude was an added bonus.I highly recommend this film. Stanley Kubrick died shortly before this movie was finished, but his fine work is evident throughout the movie.  Kubrick fans will soon discover that this movie carries on in the fine tradition of earlier Kubrick films.

118751,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,079074841X,Jeremy Heilman,"[8, 9]","Kubrick's final film is also one of his best, despite popular opinion and critical consensus. The film is an explosive examination of the struggle in a relationship between carnal desires and desires of emotional companionship. The film suggests that it's a near impossibility to achieve both without a considerable amount of work. It suggests marriage is a constant struggle to balance the two.In the film's opening shot Kidman's character is seen from the back as she sheds her dress. This begins a big theme in the film which equates the face with the companionship side of a relationship, and the back or the masked face with the carnal desires. This is the most obvious symbol used throughout the film, and it would be exceptionally difficult to read the film without realizing it. Most people who criticize the film (both posts here and professional critics) don't seem to realize this however.A lot of the film's prerelease hype dealt with the film's sexual content and it's recreation of NY City on a London soundstage. It seems as if most responses to the film address these points, when the film's really about neither. The film isn't about sex. It's about emotions that create and destroy relationships. Any mature individual should realize there's a huge difference between the two. The film isn't about NY City either. The incorrect period details that appeared to some to be technical gaffes are inconsequential, and in some ways add to the feeling that the film's journey is not meant to be taken on a literal level anyway.The film's based on &quot;Traumanovelle&quot; (Dream Novel) by Schnitzler and there's a real sense in the film that the dream that Alice (Nicole Kidman) describes near the film's end is as relevant as the &quot;real&quot; journey taken by the main character Bill (Tom Cruise). It's interesting that the film, through the use of a mask that Alice apparently finds, and through the description of her dream closely mirroring Bill's journey, suggests both characters desires are the same. The film was derided for being prudish in its display of sexuality, but I cannot think of many other American films that have been brave enough to allow a woman to be a man's sexual equal without turning her into a cartoon of some sort. The film recognizes the difference between sex and sexuality, a distinction that is not as widely held as one might think.Above all, this is a truly adult film. Sexual and emotional fulfillment are both important in a relationship. This film manages to take that thesis and explore it in truly provacative ways. To suggest it's a failure is to probably to suggest you were searching in it for something that it doesn't attempt to give. Few films manage to be as psychologically complex as this one. I haven't even mentioned the exceptional performances by Kidman and Cruise, the unparalleled lighting, or the many nuances in emotions that cause the film to go farther than just about any film on the subject, but Amazon restricts me to a 1000 word review. I think it goes without saying that I would reccomend this film. It's one of the few true masterpieces of the 90's, even if it took me a third viewing to realize how phenomenal it was.",5,An unfortunate victim of marketing hype.,1000944000,"09 20, 2001",2001,3201,"['Kubrick', 'final', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'popular', 'opinion', 'critical', 'consensus', 'film', 'explosive', 'examination', 'struggle', 'relationship', 'carnal', 'desires', 'desires', 'emotional', 'companionship', 'film', 'near', 'impossibility', 'achieve', 'considerable', 'amount', 'work', 'marriage', 'constant', 'struggle', 'balance', 'two.In', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', 'Kidman', 'character', 'seen', 'back', 'dress', 'big', 'theme', 'film', 'face', 'companionship', 'side', 'relationship', 'back', 'masked', 'face', 'carnal', 'desires', 'most', 'obvious', 'symbol', 'used', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'exceptionally', 'difficult', 'read', 'film', 'realizing', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'criticize', 'film', 'posts', 'here', 'professional', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'however.A', 'lot', 'film', 'prerelease', 'hype', 'dealt', 'film', 'sexual', 'content', 'recreation', 'NY', 'City', 'London', 'soundstage', 'most', 'responses', 'film', 'points', 'when', 'film', 'really', 'neither', 'film', ""n't"", 'about', 'sex', 'emotions', 'create', 'destroy', 'relationships', 'mature', 'individual', 'should', 'realize', 'huge', 'difference', 'two', 'film', ""n't"", 'NY', 'City', 'either', 'incorrect', 'period', 'details', 'appeared', 'be', 'technical', 'gaffes', 'are', 'inconsequential', 'ways', 'add', 'feeling', 'film', 'journey', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'literal', 'level', 'anyway.The', 'film', 'based', 'quot', 'Traumanovelle', 'quot', 'Dream', 'Novel', 'Schnitzler', 'real', 'sense', 'film', 'dream', 'Alice', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'film', 'end', 'as', 'relevant', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'journey', 'taken', 'main', 'character', 'Bill', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'interesting', 'film', 'use', 'mask', 'Alice', 'apparently', 'description', 'dream', 'closely', 'mirroring', 'Bill', 'journey', 'characters', 'desires', 'are', 'same', 'film', 'was', 'derided', 'being', 'prudish', 'display', 'sexuality', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'many', 'other', 'American', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'brave', 'enough', 'allow', 'woman', 'be', 'man', 'sexual', 'equal', 'turning', 'cartoon', 'sort', 'film', 'difference', 'sex', 'sexuality', 'distinction', 'not', 'widely', 'held', 'one', 'might', 'think.Above', 'truly', 'adult', 'film', 'Sexual', 'emotional', 'fulfillment', 'are', 'important', 'relationship', 'film', 'take', 'thesis', 'explore', 'truly', 'provacative', 'ways', 'suggest', 'failure', 'probably', 'suggest', 'were', 'searching', 'something', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'give', 'Few', 'films', 'manage', 'be', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Kidman', 'Cruise', 'unparalleled', 'lighting', 'many', 'nuances', 'emotions', 'cause', 'film', 'go', 'farther', 'just', 'film', 'subject', 'Amazon', '1000', 'word', 'review', 'think', 'saying', 'would', 'reccomend', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'true', 'masterpieces', '90', 'even', 'took', 'third', 'viewing', 'realize', 'how', 'phenomenal', 'was']",N/A

If they would have been saying something remotely interesting then fine but especially Nicole Kidman's dialogue was really irritating and pointless. She's tell these stories and talk about her feelings and I was so not caring at all. I wanted to care I just couldn't. I guess you could say I couldn't care less about her character. Her voice would get all screechy and sorry, that ain't acting, that's irritating. I've seen her in other better roles...The Hours and The Others were both much better for her. Excellent films, too.Tom C.'s character was awesome, very interesting; I liked him and was fascinated with the character arch he experienced. Tom Cruise is wonderful as an 'everyman'. It's when he's saving the world or being some sort of hero that I get irritated with him. I'm waiting for him to do a Sling Blade. He'd knock that s*** out.

If Kubrick did it, it has to be something special, something worth tearing apart and trying to figure out. So that's where I'm at with this film. It is a process of revelation.Great. So that means I have to buy the DVD, book, and do numerous google searches on disturbing things like mind-control, sex slaves and occult Rituals.

If you appreciate a movie whose complex twists and plot turns and counter-turns puzzle you and make you think, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a masterpiece.  Stanley Kubrick was never an easy director to understand and his last movie is a powerful, intriguing enigma.  I'm not a fan of either Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman, but I thought they were both excellent in this film.  Cruise plays a doctor with a comfortable lifestyle (beautiful wife, cute daughter, plush digs on Central Park West), who is devastated by his wife's mock confession of a fantasized infidelity, which sends him out into a night journey in which fantasy and reality become so intertwined that we can't see where one stops and the other starts.  How much do we really see?  Do we sometimes go deliberately blind in order not to see?  Kubrick explores all this and more in this exquisite film, and when the couple wake up to the cold light of day, they are left to realize that fantasy, however distasteful, needn't destroy everything that reality has built up.  A lot of people hate this movie simply because they can't understand it, and it moves at the pace of an arthritic snail; but as previously stated, this is not an action film; you need to slow down and think and reflect as you watch it.

Sex, as presented in most films or media, is shown to be:  a commodity that can be bought,  a taken for granted romantic bell and whistle,  a spiritual plateau,  or a pure fact of biological life.  Yet when the character of BILL hears his wife ALICE confess an extremely intimate sexual fantasy about another man, his preconceived ideas about sex (as mentioned above) are destroyd.  First, the romantic and faithful sex between husband and wife are shattered, then the biological fuction of life (in the old man's death scene) is weirded out when the grieving daughter hits on Bill, then the notion of prostitution is undermined and yields HIV, then sex as spiritual is revealed in a cult setting with dire consequences for Mandy, Bill, Alice,  and all concerned.  Sex is pleasure and it is death.  It is not any one thing and it is certainly not anything that anyone in the movie has a grip on.  This is a movie that dethrones sexual desire and acts as anything that can be understood...and yet it clearly is in everyone's life.  Kubrick's film is a revelation in an overly-sexed world that no matter how hard any of us tries, we cannot know sexuality like we claim.  There is an inner universe in Kubrick's film that comes clearly out into the open in the form of smooth tracking shots and lush lighting, colors and staging.

118764,AQD2LYCJIJOH5,079074841X,Jman,"[0, 0]","Whether or not you like Tom Cruise probably won't matter 'as much' in a movie like Eyes Wide Shut. The basic premise is about a very wealthy doctor and family man (Tom Cruise), opening his eyes to the world around him while living in New York City with his wife (Nicole Kidman), and daughter. This movie is more on par with a psychological thriller. Basically Tom is one curious cat, and is out to live life a little bit on the wild side. Along the way he finds himself at a very private party in a huge mansion out in (I'm guessing), West Chester County, New York. Actually that part of the movie might be the most action-packed part. I'm going to talk about this party scene for a little bit not only because it was probably one of the more remembered scenes in the movie, but also because I think the late director, the great Stanley Kubrick, was trying to tell us simple folks a few things.This party that Tom Cruises manages to sneak in uninvited is as I said a very upscale and private party. Everyone at this party wears masks. The only way people can get in is if they know the password. Tom's friend (a piano player who can play blindfolded), was invited to this party to play the piano or some other instrument. He somewhat braggingly gave Tom the password to get in. When Tom Cruise's character makes his way into this party he comes across a huge room where there seems to be some type of quasi-religious ritual going on. This ritual involves barely clothed beautiful women. Then the women each go and join with a few of the men surrounding them, (Everyone wearing a mask and cloak is basically a male). Anyway, Tom gets discovered and is told to remove his clothes when one of the women shouts &#34;I redeem him!&#34;. Basically she is sort of &#34;sacrificing&#34; herself for Tom. Tom is then given a very threatening and stern warning to never speak of what he witnessed at this party.My take on this scene goes back to what Stanley Kubrick himself once said about the lost art of observation. These masked men at this party were most likely not just American politicians but politicians from all over the world. The sexual ritual was some type of Satanist-pagan ritual. My own opinion (and I know not everyone believes in this), is that Stanley Kubrick was trying to subtly convey the message that the Illuminati are real, and that this type of depraved ritualistic sex parties are the types of things that the most powerful and elite people in this world engage in. And that perhaps they are all devil worshippers. As someone who has done a lot of research on the Order of the Perfectibilists, I can say this movie seems to almost directly call out what most &#34;conspiracy theorists&#34; believe are the &#34;Illuminati&#34;.Anyway, this is a very chilling and psychologically thrilling movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.",5,Quite a movie!,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,2849,"['Whether', 'not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'as"", 'much', 'movie', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'basic', 'premise', 'very', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'family', 'man', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'opening', 'eyes', 'world', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'wife', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'daughter', 'movie', 'more', 'par', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Basically', 'Tom', 'one', 'curious', 'cat', 'out', 'live', 'life', 'little', 'bit', 'wild', 'side', 'way', 'very', 'private', 'party', 'huge', 'mansion', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'West', 'Chester', 'County', 'New', 'York', 'Actually', 'part', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'action-packed', 'part', ""'m"", 'going', 'talk', 'party', 'scene', 'little', 'bit', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'remembered', 'scenes', 'movie', 'also', 'think', 'late', 'director', 'great', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'trying', 'tell', 'simple', 'folks', 'few', 'things.This', 'party', 'Tom', 'Cruises', 'sneak', 'uninvited', 'said', 'very', 'upscale', 'private', 'party', 'Everyone', 'party', 'masks', 'only', 'way', 'people', 'can', 'get', 'know', 'password', 'Tom', 'friend', 'piano', 'player', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'blindfolded', 'was', 'invited', 'party', 'play', 'piano', 'other', 'instrument', 'somewhat', 'braggingly', 'gave', 'Tom', 'password', 'get', 'When', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'way', 'party', 'huge', 'room', 'where', 'there', 'be', 'type', 'quasi-religious', 'ritual', 'going', 'ritual', 'barely', 'clothed', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Then', 'women', 'go', 'join', 'few', 'men', 'surrounding', 'Everyone', 'wearing', 'mask', 'cloak', 'basically', 'male', 'Anyway', 'Tom', 'discovered', 'told', 'remove', 'clothes', 'when', 'one', 'women', 'shouts', '34', 'redeem', '34', 'Basically', 'sort', '34', 'sacrificing', '34', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'then', 'given', 'very', 'threatening', 'stern', 'warning', 'never', 'speak', 'what', 'witnessed', 'party.My', 'take', 'scene', 'back', 'what', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'once', 'said', 'lost', 'art', 'observation', 'masked', 'men', 'party', 'were', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'just', 'American', 'politicians', 'politicians', 'world', 'sexual', 'ritual', 'was', 'type', 'Satanist-pagan', 'ritual', 'own', 'opinion', 'know', 'not', 'everyone', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'trying', 'subtly', 'convey', 'message', 'Illuminati', 'are', 'real', 'type', 'depraved', 'ritualistic', 'sex', 'parties', 'are', 'types', 'things', 'most', 'powerful', 'elite', 'people', 'world', 'engage', 'perhaps', 'are', 'devil', 'worshippers', 'someone', 'who', 'done', 'lot', 'research', 'Order', 'Perfectibilists', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'almost', 'directly', 'call', 'out', 'what', 'most', '34', 'conspiracy', '34', 'believe', 'are', '34', 'Illuminati', '34', '.Anyway', 'very', 'chilling', 'psychologically', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone']",N/A

The minute it finished, I wanted to put it on again.Time has said - &quot;Kubrick's haunting final masterpiece, vivid, brilliant, unforgettable.&quot;Chicago Sun-Times has said: &quot;a worthy final chapter to a great director's career.&quot;I agree with all of that.Yes, this film creates a lot of controversy. There are some sex scenes but purhaps not as many as some people would like to believe, from the previews.It is a film full of rich well defined colours. It has an opera-like feel to it, with haunting, startling piano cords, and other beautiful music.Two years spent making it.

Stanley Kubrick's final film, which he completed editing just four days before his death, was met with lukewarm praise like all of his earlier films yet Eyes Wide Shut is arguably his most misunderstood masterpiece. Unlike his earlier films, this one hasn't been re-accessed much over the years, but it has been embraced by many because of the spell it casts and six years after seeing it the first time I still found myself in awe of its brilliance.Starring then-couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the film opens brilliantly with a brief, elegant shot of Nicole Kidman disrobing. Kidman plays Alice Harford, Cruise plays Bill Harford. Bill is a doctor; Alice is a stay-at-home-mom to their seven-year-old daughter Helena. The film opens with them attending a lavish Christmas party held by one of Bill's wealthier patients Victor Ziegler (the late Sydney Pollack). This scene doesn't set the tone, so much as the theme of the film. Alice is hit on by a Hungarian man, while Bill is hit on by two beautiful women. Bill's rendezvous is interrupted when Ziegler needs his assistance with a girl who has OD'd. Later, after Bill and Alice have smoked a bit of weed, Alice reveals to Bill a sexual fantasy she once had about a naval officer. Bill leaves home, consumed by jealousy and embarks on a psychosexual odyssey that leads him to a grief-stricken woman expressing her love for him, an encounter with a hooker, and a mysterious costume party. In typical Kubrickian fashion, there is a cold detachment from the events. This is every frame a Kubrick film.At 2 hours and 39 minutes, with long passages of little dialogue, Eyes Wide Shut may be slow-moving to some but I find it quietly hypnotic, endlessly fascinating, and never dull. Maintaining a dream-like feel, it gracefully draws you in and keeps a strong grasp throughout. There's a lot of mystery at the heart of Eyes Wide Shut and the fact that it's so impenetrable makes it difficult for some viewers to digest, yet even at an age when I was too young to understand the themes running through it I was engulfed in it's elegant spell. Kubrick was a master of atmosphere and, like most of his films; the atmosphere that hangs over this film exists only because of his unique style. There's not a film I can think of that engulfs me into the world it creates the same way.Kubrick was an American who lived in London for the last several decades of his life and preferred to shoot his films there, substituting whatever setting his film required with London. Eyes Wide Shut takes place in New York, but his London setting never really looks or feels like the New York we're accustomed to seeing in movies. Some have pointed out Kubrick's ""New York"" as one of the film's major flaws. I think this is one of the film's greatest accomplishments. As a filmgoer, the dream-like atmosphere is reinforced and more effective by my unwillingness to accept the setting as New York. 30+ Woody Allen films and I've never seen New York have a more dreamy quality to it. There are six people credited for production design, art direction, and set decoration and they all did a flawless job here. Also flawless is the score by Jocelyn Pook, which incorporates previously composed music as well as original music and is an ominous, haunting, beautiful, and just marvelous score that stays with you long after the movie ends and is essential to the mood created throughout the film.There is striking imagery and austere camerawork throughout the film, and I don't just mean the nudity that's frequently on display. Originally billed as an ""erotic thriller"" (which it's definitely not), there is much nudity but little eroticism. Even the controversial scenes that Warner Brothers chose to block with computer-generated figures in order to secure an `R' rating aren't pornographic or arousing in any way. Kubrick was not a director who filmed anything for gratuitous reasons. Warner Brothers rightfully restored these scenes to Kubrick's original vision in the unrated release (which claims to have both versions, but actually has only one...Which is fine, just odd). When discussing striking imagery, it's impossible to ignore the entire costume party sequence; a haunting, mysterious, and extraordinarily well-executed sequence as elegant as it is terrifying. This scene may perplex viewers, but it's a scene I haven't forgotten over the years and a scene only Kubrick could have filmed so gracefully. Had another director shot this scene it would have seemed too long, exploitive, gratuitous, and silly. Kubrick made it a work of art. Another favorite scene of mine is the scene at the costume shop, which is weirdly hilarious and memorable. Featuring a very young Leelee Sobieski and Mr. Milich (Rade Sherbedgia), one of Kubrick's most memorable minor characters, it's a scene that really puts Kubrick's dark sense of humor on display.Tom Cruise gives one of his strongest, most quietly powerful performances with his then-marriage to Kidman adding an additional dimension to their dynamic. Bill Harford may not be a fully fleshed-out character that gives Cruise a lot to do, but he tackles this role with quiet menace. He plays much of the role with his facial expressions and his eyes, much as Kidman plays much of her role with her body. It is Kidman whose presence, seductive prowess, and body are responsible for some of the film's most well-known and identifiable shots. Sydney Pollack does some great work too as the malevolent Ziegler, as does Todd Field (an accomplished director) as Nick Nightingale, whose actions bring Bill into the dark underworld he ends up in.There is something new I discover and question each time I watch Eyes Wide Shut, a film that only deepens my opinion that Kubrick never had a ""peak"" as a director. Even right before his death he was making a challenging, mesmerizing film that continues to be debated over just how good (or bad) it is. I personally can't comprehend the indifference that many have met this film with. It's such a marvelously textured film that I find more fascinating and more awe-inspiring with each viewing. Kubrick was a director of infinite skill and talent, who ended his brilliant career on one of his greatest and most misunderstood films and whose death is still a crushing loss to film-lovers even twelve years later. While time hasn't been much kinder to this film's reception, I hope in the years to come it will be acknowledged as the terrific film it is. Even the title Eyes Wide Shut is so perfect, as your eyes must be wide shut to not appreciate this film for the tremendous work of art it is.GRADE: A",5,A Work of Brilliance,1298851200,"02 28,

118772,A1LP6O85Z894GT,079074841X,"J. Remington ""John Remington""","[4, 6]","The late director Stanley Kubrick was an unqualified visual genius.  Few film makers neither rivaled nor equaled his ability to fill an entire movie screen with information pertinent to the narrative structure of a film.Like Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Fritz Lang, the mature Steven Spielberg, the young Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese and Akira Kurosawa, Kubrick uses the elements of lighting, depth of field, action, composition, design, staging and sound to create motion pictures that breathe as living organisms, completely transcendent to the manufactured world of a blackened movie theatre. He will be sorely missed.That said, Stanley Kubrick is also quite possibly also the most grossly overrated, pretentious and narcissistic filmmaker of the modern era. While his most famous pictures, ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"", are filled with magnificent technical advances and stunning visuals, they lack the humor, the insight and the pessimistic optimism (he loves paradoxes in his films) of his real masterpieces ""The Killing"", ""Paths of Glory"", ""Lolita"", ""Dr. Strangelove""  and the sadly overlooked ""Barry Lyndon"".Which finally leads us to the much anticipated ""Eyes Wide Shut"" .For anyone who has been in a bomb shelter since the Cuban Missile Crisis, Shut  features the real life husband and wife team of Nichole Kidman and Tom Cruise as a couple who share way too much in the way of intimate secrets.Driven by nothing more than a jealous fantasy, Cruise undertakes a journey into the sexual underworld of New York's cultural elite. The film unfolds very much like a nightmarish adult version of The Wizard of Oz  (one character even taunts Cruise to come with her ""Over the Rainbow."") Kidman's hilarious closing line is a crude rewriting of ""There is no place like home.""Crouching in the middle of the film like an ominous gargoyle-like  specter is one of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed. Straight out of Heironymous Bosch and filled with hideously masked writhing bodies, cryptic chanting, cloaked figures and demonic organ music, Kubrick makes Cruise's descent into perceived decadence complete. It is one of the most vivid portraits of Hell on Earth ever filmed. That sequence chills and haunts me to the bone still.Besides the ""hell"" sequence, the film does contain much to reccomend it.  Kidman's performance is Oscar worthy in it's quite torment and grace. She is an actor of that most rare combination: talent, beauty and endless range. Hers is a career that will last.The production design stunningly recreates New York on a London Sound Stage.And of course at the center of it all is the film magician Kubrick, who does create a film of stunning visual power. It just isn't particularly entertaining or enlightening.Which leads me to the final questions about the film. What is the point of it all? Is it a calculated warning to anyone thinking of wandering away from home and hearth? Are we the viewer supposed to identify with Cruise who is attracted by the promise of sensual delights, but leaves stunned by the growing evil? Or is it an excuse to film as Kubrick himself once said "" A first class nudie film.""? Who knows? Who cares?Although deliberate ambiguity can serve as an effective device- one that can inspire hours of meaningful debate, it all to often represents in Kubrick's world, a muddled point of view. Such is the case with ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",3,Kubrick at his overrated best,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,3388,"['late', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'unqualified', 'visual', 'genius', 'Few', 'film', 'makers', 'rivaled', 'equaled', 'ability', 'fill', 'entire', 'movie', 'screen', 'information', 'pertinent', 'narrative', 'structure', 'film.Like', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'John', 'Ford', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'mature', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'young', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Kubrick', 'elements', 'lighting', 'depth', 'field', 'action', 'composition', 'design', 'staging', 'sound', 'create', 'motion', 'pictures', 'breathe', 'living', 'organisms', 'completely', 'transcendent', 'manufactured', 'world', 'blackened', 'movie', 'theatre', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'said', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'also', 'quite', 'possibly', 'also', 'most', 'grossly', 'overrated', 'pretentious', 'narcissistic', 'filmmaker', 'modern', 'era', 'most', 'famous', 'pictures', '2001', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'are', 'filled', 'magnificent', 'technical', 'advances', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'lack', 'humor', 'insight', 'pessimistic', 'optimism', 'paradoxes', 'films', 'real', 'masterpieces', 'Killing', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'Lolita', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', '.Which', 'finally', 'much', 'anticipated', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', '.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Shut', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Nichole', 'Kidman', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'couple', 'who', 'share', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'intimate', 'secrets.Driven', 'nothing', 'more', 'jealous', 'fantasy', 'Cruise', 'journey', 'sexual', 'underworld', 'New', 'York', 'cultural', 'elite', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'nightmarish', 'adult', 'version', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'one', 'character', 'even', 'taunts', 'Cruise', 'come', 'Rainbow', 'Kidman', 'hilarious', 'closing', 'line', 'crude', 'rewriting', 'place', 'home', 'Crouching', 'middle', 'film', 'ominous', 'gargoyle-like', 'specter', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'sequences', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Straight', 'Heironymous', 'Bosch', 'filled', 'hideously', 'masked', 'writhing', 'bodies', 'cryptic', 'chanting', 'cloaked', 'figures', 'demonic', 'organ', 'music', 'Kubrick', 'Cruise', 'descent', 'perceived', 'decadence', 'complete', 'one', 'most', 'vivid', 'portraits', 'Hell', 'Earth', 'ever', 'filmed', 'sequence', 'chills', 'haunts', 'bone', 'hell', 'sequence', 'film', 'contain', 'much', 'reccomend', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'quite', 'torment', 'grace', 'actor', 'most', 'rare', 'combination', 'talent', 'beauty', 'endless', 'range', 'Hers', 'career', 'will', 'last.The', 'production', 'design', 'stunningly', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'Sound', 'Stage.And', 'course', 'center', 'film', 'magician', 'Kubrick', 'who', 'create', 'film', 'stunning', 'visual', 'power', 'just', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'enlightening.Which', 'final', 'questions', 'film', 'What', 'point', 'calculated', 'warning', 'anyone', 'thinking', 'wandering', 'away', 'home', 'hearth', 'Are', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'identify', 'Cruise', 'who', 'attracted', 'promise', 'sensual', 'delights', 'leaves', 'stunned', 'growing', 'evil', 'excuse', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'once', 'said', 'A', 'first', 'class', 'nudie', 'film.', 'Who', 'Who', 'deliberate', 'ambiguity', 'can', 'serve', 'effective', 'device-', 'one', 'can', 'inspire', 'hours', 'meaningful', 'debate', 'often', 'Kubrick', 'world', 'muddled', 'point', 'view', 'Such', 'case', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut']",N/A

SOUTH,"[5, 7]","This film is probably only worth 4 1/2 stars, but since so many other reviewers here panned it unjustly, I felt I had to give it five stars to balance the picture.I never saw ""Eyes Wide Shut"" on the big screen.  I was acting in a production of Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" when it was playing,and I remember other cast members calling it disturbing, irritating, skeevy, bizarre, frightening, and telling me I HAD to view it to get what they were talking about. Years later, I rented it on DVD.I confess that I hated the movie, but for some strange reason, I also found that I could not remove my eyes from it until the last credit rolled. About a year later, I caught the beginning again while channel-surfing, and once again, I could not pull away from it. Only this time, I began to see that it may very well be a masterpiece.  It simply isn't what we're used to. The title alone has given me a lot to think about before I drift off to sleep at night, and I'll let you draw your own conclusions about that!For film buffs, Kubrick's recreation of New York City streets in a London studio alone is worth the price of the DVD. The lighting and camerawork is high art, with weird, disturbing color-choices (all the light shown through windows is a bright but ominous blue). I almost hate to refer to a genius like Stanley Kubrick as ....-rententive, but ""Eyes Wide Shut"" took almost two years of filmimg, with takes and re-takes to get every image exactly the way he saw it in his head.  That's not to mention the years spent on the screenplay and pre-prep.Here's the kicker: American censors would only release the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" with an XXX rating, which the studio thought would kill it at the box office.  Thus one particularly scary, long ....scene was transformed into a perplexing mess, with dark robes digitally added to the actors afterward.  No wonder SK checked out soon after it was ready to open.Okay, the story, I'll leave you to discover, along with your own thoughts about the title.  Let it suffice to say that I am now somewhat addicted to watching & re-watching both my DVD copies (American and unedited European versions).  I only wish Kubrick were still here to keep creating this quality of movie experience.

It has no  explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot. What it has are long  scenes in which characters talk to one another. Slowly and carefully.The film was marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of  gratuitous nudity, while it has neither. There is plenty of naked flesh,  don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it  appear. This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it takes a more  dispassionate, analytical approach to sexuality. The result was  disappointment for the many people who bought tickets looking for some  high-class porn.The film is a meditation on sexuality and how it relates  to marriage, death, and money. It's a fascinating commentary on modern  life, and a rare movie that dares to examine sex as impassionately as any  other issue.The tension in the plot and the issues that the film  discusses aren't telegraphed to the audience, they're hinted at in the  dialog. There is no neat resolution at the end, life simply goes on. The  subtlety of the plot doesn't mean Kubrick didn't have anything to say,  however, it means the viewer has to do some work as well.The directing  and cinematography alone would be worth the price of admission without the  social commentary. The sets are an integral part of the movie; they breathe  and glow and live. Kubrick was a master director, and he uses long shots  and dissolves to great effect. Cruise and Kidman are at their best, and the  supporting cast is also strong. It's Kubrick's magic work with the camera  that holds the film together.All in all, definitely worth seeing for the  un-uptight.

118780,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,079074841X,K. Driscoll,"[13, 16]","Not to suggest that you can expect to see Kubrick's last film in a stunning new light on Blu-Ray, and although like any Blu-Ray it is certainly beautiful, by comparison to some other Blu-Rays, it is not an exceptional transfer.  I've had a Hitachi 1080i plasma on my wall for about a year now and I finally got a Playstation 3 so I can buy and enjoy Blu-Rays.  Unlike the switch from video to DVD, the upgrade to Blu-Ray doesn't necessarily mean I will have to start my movie collection all over again as I can play all of my DVDs as well, but I was prompted to buy Eyes Wide Shut (a DVD I do own) when I realized it was the unrated version only previously available in Europe.  I thought that might mean it would be closer to what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but the additional footage is really just some extra sexual content.  I should clarify that it isn't really extra footage at all, it's just that a bunch of robed figures blocking our view from some naughty behavior in theAmerican releasewere actually removed in this version so you can see the naughty behavior.  I didn't even realize the figures were there and now I have to get my arms around the reasons why they were included to begin with.  I don't know, perhaps if Mike Huckabee becomes president those mysterious robed figures will make a dramatic comeback.  That might verify my suspicions.Nevertheless, I'm not convinced this is what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but contemplating what he did intend is fascinating to me.  I actually consider Kubrick among my favorite directors, so this fascination is probably not as applicable to non-fans. Of his films, Eyes Wide Shut is, along withBarry Lyndon, his least appreciated and most criticized, although not by me.  Eyes Wide Shut is actually one of my favorite Kubrick films.  Even though it is not as cohesive as his others; it is, on the surface at least, among his most stylized.  The interactions characters have are slow and deliberate and it gives the meaning behind each word and each frame more clarification.  Many call this quality dreamlike and it is.  Expressing reality doesn't seem to be a priority in Eyes Wide Shut and I wonder if the film was ever meant to be reality in the first place. Although the film is dreamlike per se, there is nothing at all to indicate that any of it was a dream.  In fact, the presence of the cult mask on Alice and Bill's bed verifies the exact opposite.  Still, I for one believe the style is absolutely intentional and that is supported by the meticulous photography in the film.  Almost every shot seems like it was mulled over again and again.  It is no wonder Kubrick had the reputation for doing almost a hundred takes.  He was a perfectionist and, at least visually, Eyes Wide Shut has more moments of perfection than not.  The acting is good too but really, the control Kubrick has is so evident that it is hard to credit the actors.  However, Nicole Kidman is particularly strong.With all that said, Eyes Wide Shut may seem otherworldly, but its psychological commentary on marital fidelity from the male perspective is very real.  Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is told by his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) that she had at one time thought about having an affair.  The paranoia, possibilities, and the trials he endures psychologically and in terms of his fidelity to her, are tested as he walks around New York City and guides us through his many surreal and outwardly sexual encounters.  It is an exhibition of his gradual psychological breakdown after his wife shared her secret and all of his encounters seem to be taunting him in his fragile state.  There's more than enough here to make it a great film and to connect almost all of the dots, however, some interesting conspiracy theories exist about the orgy cult that becomes the center of the film's climax.  I'd recommend checking those out if you like this movie but I'm not going to reveal my opinion of them one way or the other.With all of that said, I thought the characters themselves are normal and well-adjusted, so the commentary itself is even more significant.  They are actually good people in a film about doing what is all too often perceived as bad things (i.e. sex).  I'm sure there are good reasons not to like Eyes Wide Shut, but for the most part I thought it was unfairly reviewed because of the sexual content and the sexual commentary.  We are so used to seeing nudity strictly used gratuitously, that it was easy to be cynical of its consistent use here, and that is just the visual sexual elements never mind what the film's deeper intentions are overall.  I'm not surprised I guess because if the film has a flaw, it is that it's too cryptic at times.  Either way, I think it's a great movie and it's nice to see this version released on the best technology we have.",5,Kubrick's Final Film is Worth a Look on Blu-Ray,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,4841,"['Not', 'suggest', 'can', 'expect', 'see', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'film', 'stunning', 'new', 'light', 'Blu-Ray', 'Blu-Ray', 'certainly', 'beautiful', 'comparison', 'other', 'Blu-Rays', 'not', 'exceptional', 'transfer', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Hitachi', '1080i', 'plasma', 'wall', 'year', 'now', 'finally', 'got', 'Playstation', '3', 'can', 'buy', 'enjoy', 'Blu-Rays', 'switch', 'video', 'DVD', 'upgrade', 'Blu-Ray', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'will', 'have', 'start', 'movie', 'collection', 'over', 'again', 'can', 'play', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'prompted', 'buy', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'DVD', 'do', 'own', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'unrated', 'version', 'only', 'previously', 'available', 'Europe', 'thought', 'might', 'mean', 'would', 'be', 'closer', 'what', 'Kubrick', 'intended', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'be', 'additional', 'footage', 'really', 'just', 'extra', 'sexual', 'content', 'should', 'clarify', ""n't"", 'really', 'extra', 'footage', 'just', 'bunch', 'robed', 'figures', 'blocking', 'view', 'naughty', 'behavior', 'theAmerican', 'actually', 'removed', 'version', 'can', 'see', 'naughty', 'behavior', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'figures', 'were', 'now', 'have', 'get', 'arms', 'reasons', 'why', 'were', 'included', 'begin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'perhaps', 'Mike', 'Huckabee', 'president', 'mysterious', 'robed', 'figures', 'will', 'make', 'dramatic', 'comeback', 'might', 'verify', 'suspicions.Nevertheless', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'what', 'Kubrick', 'intended', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'be', 'contemplating', 'what', 'did', 'intend', 'fascinating', 'actually', 'consider', 'Kubrick', 'favorite', 'directors', 'fascination', 'probably', 'not', 'applicable', 'non-fans', 'films', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'withBarry', 'Lyndon', 'least', 'appreciated', 'most', 'criticized', 'not', 'Eyes', 'Shut', 'actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'Even', 'not', 'as', 'cohesive', 'others', 'surface', 'least', 'most', 'stylized', 'interactions', 'characters', 'have', 'are', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'meaning', 'word', 'frame', 'more', 'clarification', 'Many', 'call', 'quality', 'dreamlike', 'Expressing', 'reality', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'priority', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'wonder', 'film', 'was', 'ever', 'meant', 'be', 'reality', 'first', 'place', 'film', 'dreamlike', 'se', 'nothing', 'indicate', 'was', 'dream', 'fact', 'presence', 'cult', 'mask', 'Alice', 'Bill', 'bed', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Still', 'one', 'believe', 'style', 'absolutely', 'intentional', 'supported', 'meticulous', 'photography', 'film', 'shot', 'was', 'mulled', 'over', 'again', 'again', 'wonder', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'reputation', 'doing', 'almost', 'hundred', 'was', 'perfectionist', 'least', 'visually', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'more', 'moments', 'perfection', 'not', 'acting', 'good', 'too', 'really', 'control', 'Kubrick', 'so', 'evident', 'hard', 'credit', 'actors', 'However', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'particularly', 'strong.With', 'said', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'may', 'seem', 'otherworldly', 'psychological', 'commentary', 'marital', 'fidelity', 'male', 'perspective', 'very', 'real', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'Harford', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'told', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'had', 'one', 'time', 'thought', 'having', 'affair', 'paranoia', 'possibilities', 'trials', 'psychologically', 'terms', 'fidelity', 'are', 'tested', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'guides', 'many', 'surreal', 'outwardly', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'exhibition', 'gradual', 'psychological', 'breakdown', 'wife', 'shared', 'secret', 'encounters', 'seem', 'be', 'taunting', 'fragile', 'state', 'more', 'enough', 'here', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'connect', 'almost', 'dots', 'however', 'interesting', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'exist', 'orgy', 'cult', 'center', 'film', 'climax', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'checking', 'like', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'opinion', 'one', 'way', 'other.With', 'said', 'thought', 'characters', 'are', 'normal', 'well-adjusted', 'commentary', 'even', 'more', 'significant', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'people', 'film', 'doing', 'what', 'too', 'often', 'perceived', 'bad', 'things', 'i.e', 'sex', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'good', 'reasons', 'not', 'like', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'was', 'unfairly', 'reviewed', 'sexual', 'content', 'sexual', 'commentary', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'nudity', 'strictly', 'used', 'gratuitously', 'was', 'easy', 'be', 'cynical', 'consistent', 'use', 'here', 'just', 'visual', 'sexual', 'elements', 'never', 'mind', 'what', 'film', 'deeper', 'intentions', 'are', 'overall', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'guess', 'film', 'flaw', 'too', 'cryptic', 'times', 'way', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'nice', 'see', 'version', 'released', 'best', 'technology', 'have']",N/A
118781,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,079074841X,Keith Mirenberg,"[3, 4]","I enjoyed EYES WIDE SHUT immensely and rate it at 6 stars out of a possible 5! As is the case with most Kubrick films, every time I see it I find a new and interesting interpretation. This film made brilliant use of light, color, texture, as well as sound and haunting music. All of the major screen performances were also excellent and very interesting.I remember first watching this film on a whim with my wife one snowey evening on late night television. We knew nothing about this film except for it being a Kubrick production. It was a haunting experience, and we stayed up into the late hours of the evening watching the movie.  It was a very, very strange film.Although I still don't think I get it all, the film involved: relationships between men and woman and attempts to question what it is that both genders seek from each other beyond the obvious.  It partially provides answers about the similarites and differences between these two while telling the story under somewhat threatening circumstances to get our attention.I am not certain of exactly what this film was trying to say about marriage, but know I will not tire of trying to learn this with repeated screenings. This was Kubrick' s last film as he died just after the first public screenings. His family and friends noted that he appeared relieved after the release of the film as though the outcome might have weighed heavily on his mind.Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct AI, a long term project of his, which he intentionally postponed after he realized great technological changes would soon enable this film to be assembled much more effectively. Kubrick apparently wished this new film to be directed by another trusted and very capable individual.

Near the end of August, the film (which quickly vanished from theaters, after the nasty critical reviews) was only playing  in one local theater and was about to go out. I begged my older brother to  take me to see it (I hadn't obtained my driver's at the time -- I'm 17). He  grudgingly agreed, wondering if he &quot;would have to brush his teeth  after seeing it&quot;. But, he was beaming when we walked out of the  theater and later thanked me, because it was one of the best movies he had  ever seen.There can not be enough praise to give this really excellent  film. As this was Stanley Kubrick's last film, I'm glad that he decided to  go out with a bang. The story is suspenseful and and has enough mystery to  mislead you (which is no easy task for today's films). All of the actors in  the film, no matter how big or small their part is, always add something to  the movie. Nicole Kidman has us hanging on her every word in her confession  scenes and Tom Cruise performs above and beyond in an underwritten  role.The camerawork and cinematography are top-notch, probably the best  that Kubrick has ever done. They make the movie all the more enjoyable.I  really don't know too many people who liked this movie. But, you know what?  This movie isn't mainstream. Like &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, you  have to have the patience and the open mind to enjoy the experience of  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;.Stanley Kubrick should be a mentor to today's  filmmakers.

Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a husband and wife who seem to have gotten bored with one another but their on screen chemistry was so non existent the viewer was left wondering when these two characters had ever been in love in the first place.Nicole's character informs her husband that she had an elaborate erotic fantasy about another man. Tom's character, Dr. Bill reacts like a 15 year old boy instead of a sophisticated man. He spends the rest of the movie looking to get even and blunders into one sexually charged situation after another. None of these situations is ever carried to fruition and the most famous scene of the movie---the orgy turns dangerous for him.Now about that orgy scene. Why did all the women look like starved horses? Perhaps it was Kubrick's little joke but all the female orgy attendees reminded me of the dead woman in the bath tub from The Shining. Has an orgy seemed ever been filmed in a more unerottic way? Dr. Bill doesn't seemed shocked, amused or even excited so much as analytical. The whole scene, and indeed most of the movie seemed cold and silly in turns.There are two really good scenes and that's it. The first is when the gossipy desk clerk falls for Dr. Bill's charms and tells all about the strange men who took the doctor's musician friend away and the second is when a hard looking man follows Dr. Bill throughout a remarkably empty and sanitized looking New York street.By the time the movie ends I didn't care about silly Dr. Bill or his frosty wife or their marriage or even what he was going to do about the possibly criminal aftermath of the orgy.

There is a point in &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; where everything--the wandering, the speculation, the mystery, the ambiguous  morality--suddenly comes together.  As Cruise stands looking at a corpse in  a cold, clinical hospital morgue, his expression is one of such agonized  disappointment that it's difficult not to see this moment as the film's  climax.  And even though it provides no concrete answers (Kubrick rarely  does) the scene acts as a capsule for the entire film: it is part-agony,  part-enigma and enormously empty.  I couldn't help but feel that Kubrick  dwelt on Cruise's face throughout the film in such unforgiving close-ups to  mirror the expressions of his audience.  Certainly this film was both  agonizing and mesmerizing.  And, yes, it often languished in its own agony.  But Kubrick creates such a void with this film that it's difficult not to  read it as a record of everything that we all are (and are not) at the end  of the Twentieth Century.

118795,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,079074841X,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","The one subject that American filmmakers (for that matter, most filmmakers) are loathe to address is class. Sure, there are plenty of rags-to-riches stories, plenty of poor-man-sneaks-into-rich-environment-and-makes-good stories, but very few willing to attack class assumptions in a truly critical way. It seems Kubrick wanted to do this in ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" but got distracted by the rip-roaring yarn. It's more a story of the Tom Cruise character's journey, set against a backdrop notable for its strangeness and exclusivity.The fact is that these types of parties go on all the time, and it's not particularly difficult to get invited to them - just type ""swing"" into the Craigslist ads in any large city. What's different here is that the guest list for this party is limited to the rich and powerful, although with everyone wearing masks, it's impossible to tell. Nothing of consequence seems to be going on - the biggest difference between a regular ""swingers"" club and the one depicted herein is the number of thin, attractive women in their 20s. I should mention that any man who wants to get into the swing scene had better get used to having older and fatter women around. It's not a young person's scene by any stretch. But then, nothing seems to be happening at the party in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" other than a bunch of nearly identical naked girls wandering around, who look like they just escaped from a Penthouse photo shoot. I would imagine that the really kinky Belle du Jour stuff is going on behind closed doors in the bedrooms - the coprophagia, formicophilia, ""decanters,"" hematolagnia, coulrophilia, thlipsosis, and urtication must be imagined as they are not shown - unless the only reason these people have gone to all this trouble is for the sake of mere voyeurism. Surely there had to be more going on than ""hey, looka the warheads on that silo!""So there is this hidden (not really) world that the powerful (and any other interested person) are involved in, where nothing much happens, yet they are willing to commit murder to keep it a secret (or maybe not). Separate from any problems with the ""story,"" the film holds the viewer's interest, moving inevitably and inexorably to its minimally satisfying conclusion.

118798,A3053H4J3EQC3D,079074841X,"Leo Belldaere ""Creative perfectionist""","[10, 13]","Up until Eyes Wide Shut I didn't view Kubrik as a genius. I liked what he did with about 2/3 of 2001, and that's about it. But faced with his achievement of this film, I am astounded at his genius.First, let's consider why it had to be Cruise and Kidman. Kubrik needed a working film couple whom he could mold. Another requirement was that the woman had to be comfortable with spending a great deal of time naked. They both had to be attractive, and of the right age. So, if anyone can suggest another couple, they are welcome to try. What will trump them is Cruise's amazing ability to mimic, and ""hold an emotional note."" (No, I am not saying he is a good or a bad actor. He just never got any training.)A man I respect claims that there can be no great cinema without great performances, and while he is absolutely right, Eyes Wide Shut is the exception that proves the rule. This is the first auteur effort I have ever seen, in my view. Kubrik's mastery of the art of the writer-director permeates every single frame, and every single sound. Only he could create a scene that should have tittillated most (perhaps, prurient) individuals, yet instead ends up being repulsive, lacking in all joy.This was not a mistake, as some critics with no clue about the craft of cinema might have claimed. This was pure calculation, and immaculate execution. Consider: not much happens in the script. Plenty of visuals take place (note, I did not say action, or plot) with no words being spoken, and that adds to the overall hypnotic feel of the entire film. The deliberate, slow movements of the characters, conversations, camera moves, score, and events hypnotize the viewers, inviting them to surrender to this state of mind.All hypnosis, however, is self-hypnosis. Unless the viewer agrees to participate, the magic unravels, and the effect disappears. So a particularly narrow-minded person, whose so-called morals are defined by the mores and practices of 17th Century puritains, would reject the premise, wake up, and spend as much or as little of the rest of the film squirming and being shocked. If you believe you fall into this category, I strongly advise you to avoid this film.For the rest of us who are willing to go on the journey Kubrik lovingly crafted for us, we are taken to places that we had never imagined. The Alice-through-the-looking-glass feel reaches a peak in the so-called orgy scene. If one forgets for a moment that people refer to the scene as an orgy, but instead considers it for its nature, the symphony that is the scene is at the behest of Kubrik's conductorial baton. We are taken on (again) a slow, deliberate ride through what the average audience member believes ""them rich people"" would do, since money can buy anything. But even in their moralistic victory, those who do not dream Kubrik's dream find no joy, nor even sufficient prurience, after the censors required that certain acts be covered with digital robed bodies.My personal bet would be that even if those strategically placed robes weren't there, while some of the acts would be more graphic than the pacified R-rated version, there would still be little joy or enjoyment for anyone. Kubrik was not a pornographer. He was, in the end, an unerring judge of how to move an audience. He was able to show us a place within ourselves we did not previously know, or know very well, no matter whether we were appauled or enthralled.And that is genius.",5,Kubrik's final dream,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,3439,"['Up', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'Kubrik', 'genius', 'liked', 'what', 'did', '2/3', '2001', 'faced', 'achievement', 'film', 'am', 'astounded', 'genius.First', 'let', 'consider', 'why', 'had', 'be', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'Kubrik', 'needed', 'working', 'film', 'couple', 'whom', 'could', 'mold', 'requirement', 'was', 'woman', 'had', 'be', 'comfortable', 'spending', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'naked', 'had', 'be', 'attractive', 'right', 'age', 'So', 'anyone', 'can', 'suggest', 'couple', 'are', 'welcome', 'try', 'What', 'will', 'trump', 'Cruise', 'amazing', 'ability', 'mimic', 'hold', 'emotional', 'note', 'No', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'good', 'bad', 'actor', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'training', 'man', 'respect', 'claims', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'cinema', 'great', 'performances', 'absolutely', 'right', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'exception', 'rule', 'first', 'auteur', 'effort', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'view', 'Kubrik', 'mastery', 'art', 'writer-director', 'single', 'frame', 'single', 'sound', 'Only', 'could', 'create', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'tittillated', 'most', 'perhaps', 'prurient', 'individuals', 'yet', 'instead', 'up', 'being', 'repulsive', 'lacking', 'joy.This', 'was', 'not', 'mistake', 'critics', 'clue', 'craft', 'cinema', 'might', 'have', 'claimed', 'was', 'pure', 'calculation', 'immaculate', 'execution', 'Consider', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'script', 'Plenty', 'visuals', 'take', 'place', 'note', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'action', 'plot', 'words', 'being', 'spoken', 'overall', 'hypnotic', 'feel', 'entire', 'film', 'deliberate', 'slow', 'movements', 'characters', 'conversations', 'camera', 'moves', 'score', 'events', 'hypnotize', 'viewers', 'inviting', 'surrender', 'state', 'mind.All', 'hypnosis', 'however', 'self-hypnosis', 'viewer', 'participate', 'magic', 'unravels', 'effect', 'particularly', 'narrow-minded', 'person', 'so-called', 'morals', 'are', 'defined', 'mores', 'practices', '17th', 'Century', 'puritains', 'would', 'reject', 'premise', 'wake', 'up', 'spend', 'as', 'much', 'little', 'rest', 'film', 'squirming', 'being', 'shocked', 'believe', 'fall', 'category', 'strongly', 'advise', 'avoid', 'film.For', 'rest', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'journey', 'Kubrik', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'are', 'taken', 'places', 'had', 'never', 'imagined', 'Alice-through-the-looking-glass', 'feel', 'peak', 'so-called', 'orgy', 'scene', 'one', 'forgets', 'moment', 'people', 'refer', 'scene', 'orgy', 'instead', 'considers', 'nature', 'symphony', 'scene', 'behest', 'Kubrik', 'conductorial', 'baton', 'are', 'taken', 'again', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'ride', 'what', 'average', 'audience', 'member', 'rich', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'anything', 'even', 'moralistic', 'victory', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'dream', 'Kubrik', 'dream', 'find', 'joy', 'even', 'sufficient', 'prurience', 'censors', 'required', 'certain', 'acts', 'be', 'covered', 'digital', 'robed', 'personal', 'bet', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'strategically', 'placed', 'robes', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'acts', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'graphic', 'pacified', 'R-rated', 'version', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'little', 'joy', 'enjoyment', 'anyone', 'Kubrik', 'was', 'not', 'pornographer', 'was', 'end', 'unerring', 'judge', 'how', 'move', 'audience', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'place', 'did', 'not', 'previously', 'know', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'matter', 'were', 'appauled', 'enthralled.And', 'genius']",N/A

118808,AK9UPC78LIPIR,079074841X,maelje,"[2, 2]","You have to hand it to Stanley Kubrick: He was consistent. Nearly all his films have polarized audiences and critics alike. And nearly all those films have, over time, grown in stature as audiences and critics alike viewed them multiple times, and found more and more to like. Examples of this: ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""The Shining"" and so on.Add ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to that list. Indeed, it may have been the most polarizing of all. In fact, it still is -- look at the ratings bestowed by Amazon customers. You'll find lots of five-star nods, yes, but also lots of one-star ratings. This seems to be a love it or hate it film.When it made its theatrical debut in 1999, I must say I was not completely won over. I thought it was a very good film. I wasn't sure it was among Kubrick's best.Now I am. But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has taken longer to grow on me than has any other Stanley Kubrick film. In the 13 years since its release, I've probably viewed it half a dozen to a dozen times. Here are some virtues I've found thanks to my repeated viewings:1. This really is a pretty optimistic film. SPOILER ALERT: Despite everything they go through, Bill and Alice Harford decide to stay together. Of course this was evident the first time I saw it, but in many ways the film was so dark and ominous that the couple's talk in the toy store wasn't enough to redeem it from being downbeat. The more I've watched that scene, though, the more love I see in it, and understanding ... and even a bit of sly humor. Certainly it is interesting that it turns out the last word of the last Kubrick film (SPOILER ALERT) turns out to be the f-bomb.2. It's exquisitely structured. This film is downright elegant in the way it's put together. In the opening scenes, the couple is dressing for a party. Said party follows, and couple attends, with both of them flirting with other people. The next night, fueled by some killer weed, Alice Harford makes a startling confession. Her statement completely unnerves Bill. He then embarks on an odyssey that leads him to some strange places, including a prostitute's apartment and an orgy where the filthy-rich guests are masked. Finally, Bill receives a warning; he was not a welcome guest at the orgy, and he is urged to stop asking questions about it lest harm come to his family. He is then confronted by Victor Ziegler, a wealthy patient of his (Harford is a doctor). Ziegler informs Bill he was a participant at the orgy, and emphasizes again that Bill must stop asking questions and try to forget about what he saw.3. No other film I can think of explores the psychology of sexuality as thoroughly and as effectively as ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Attraction, attachment, jealousy, anger, fear, fulfillment: All these realms are visited. It has taken me all these viewings to appreciate how Kubrick interwove them the way he did.There are many other elements to admire, too. As usual, Kubrick's lighting is just dazzling. The music is aptly disturbing. And Kubrick drew out of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the Harfords, two of the best performances each actor ever has given.If you haven't seen ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" I recommend it. I would make sure you get the uncensored version, without the black CGI figures that were placed in the original theatrical release to secure its R rating. They're extremely distracting and annoying, and the fact is that the simulated sex they masked wasn't all that explicit, compared with what we've seen since.",5,"Stanley Kubrick's final, misunderstood (of course) film",1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,3505,"['have', 'hand', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'consistent', 'Nearly', 'films', 'have', 'polarized', 'audiences', 'critics', 'alike', 'nearly', 'films', 'have', 'time', 'grown', 'stature', 'audiences', 'critics', 'alike', 'viewed', 'multiple', 'times', 'found', 'more', 'more', 'like', 'Examples', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'Shining', 'so', 'on.Add', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'list', 'Indeed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'polarizing', 'fact', 'still', 'look', 'ratings', 'bestowed', 'Amazon', 'customers', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lots', 'five-star', 'nods', 'yes', 'also', 'lots', 'one-star', 'ratings', 'be', 'love', 'hate', 'film.When', 'made', 'theatrical', 'debut', '1999', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'won', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'Kubrick', 'best.Now', 'am', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'taken', 'longer', 'grow', 'other', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'film', '13', 'years', 'release', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'viewed', 'dozen', 'dozen', 'times', 'Here', 'are', 'virtues', ""'ve"", 'found', 'thanks', 'repeated', 'viewings:1', 'really', 'pretty', 'optimistic', 'film', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'everything', 'go', 'Bill', 'Alice', 'Harford', 'decide', 'stay', 'together', 'course', 'was', 'evident', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'dark', 'ominous', 'couple', 'talk', 'toy', 'store', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'redeem', 'being', 'downbeat', 'more', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'scene', 'though', 'more', 'love', 'see', 'understanding', 'even', 'bit', 'sly', 'humor', 'Certainly', 'interesting', 'out', 'last', 'word', 'last', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'out', 'be', 'f-bomb.2', 'exquisitely', 'structured', 'film', 'downright', 'elegant', 'way', 'put', 'together', 'opening', 'scenes', 'couple', 'dressing', 'party', 'Said', 'party', 'couple', 'attends', 'flirting', 'other', 'people', 'next', 'night', 'fueled', 'killer', 'weed', 'Alice', 'Harford', 'startling', 'confession', 'statement', 'completely', 'unnerves', 'Bill', 'then', 'odyssey', 'strange', 'places', 'including', 'prostitute', 'apartment', 'orgy', 'where', 'filthy-rich', 'guests', 'are', 'masked', 'Finally', 'Bill', 'warning', 'was', 'not', 'welcome', 'guest', 'orgy', 'urged', 'stop', 'asking', 'questions', 'lest', 'harm', 'come', 'family', 'then', 'confronted', 'Victor', 'Ziegler', 'wealthy', 'patient', 'Harford', 'doctor', 'Ziegler', 'informs', 'Bill', 'was', 'participant', 'orgy', 'again', 'Bill', 'must', 'stop', 'asking', 'questions', 'try', 'forget', 'what', 'saw.3', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'explores', 'psychology', 'sexuality', 'thoroughly', 'as', 'effectively', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Attraction', 'attachment', 'jealousy', 'anger', 'fear', 'fulfillment', 'realms', 'are', 'visited', 'taken', 'viewings', 'appreciate', 'how', 'Kubrick', 'interwove', 'way', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'elements', 'admire', 'too', 'usual', 'Kubrick', 'lighting', 'just', 'dazzling', 'music', 'aptly', 'disturbing', 'Kubrick', 'drew', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'play', 'Harfords', 'two', 'best', 'performances', 'actor', 'ever', 'given.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'recommend', 'would', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'uncensored', 'version', 'black', 'CGI', 'figures', 'were', 'placed', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'secure', 'R', 'rating', ""'re"", 'extremely', 'distracting', 'annoying', 'fact', 'simulated', 'sex', 'masked', 'was', ""n't"", 'explicit', 'compared', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

But then he'd have to pause.  ""Why,"" I suspect he'd ask, ""do my films attract such empty barrels?""Anyway, I hope I'm not one of them.Eyes Wide Shut, I think, is a deceptively simple meditation on human honesty in the context of our dearest human institution ... marriage.  Of course, much of the dishonesty in relationships centers around sexuality, and the conflict between the sexual roles imposed by the institution itself, and the far less clear lines that exists within each of us.  And so, we round pegs shoved in the square holes of an artificial and ancient institution struggle to be both open and closed to each other.In the marriage at the heart of this film, both husband and wife have their own, hidden fantasies, longings, disappointments, and wishes that don't fit neatly into what is expected of them.  Nicole Kidman's character, in a moment of marijuana induced honesty, admits to having something less than an idealized fidelity to her husband ... that the mere glance of a stranger could destroy it all (and nearly did once).  Of course, Cruise's character has secrets of his own, and Kidman's brutal and devastating disclosure plunges him into fugue state where his own conflicts of role and sexuality surface.  Cruise's journey touches on many areas of the ""forbidden"" ... from homosexuality (the taunting of ""roughs"" leads him into the hands of a prostitute uncertain whether he belongs there) to a possible dalliance with a patient to a ritualistic orgy.  Of course, much like his wife has owned her hidden side, he must, eventually, own his ... and he does.A central metaphor here is the mask.  And with his mask finally stripped free and sitting on his pillow, Cruise (never before wanting to remove his mask or costume) relents and tells all ... and we can only hope, by that point, that his relationship can survive transformed ... or not.  It depends on who or what you are rooting for, as with any great film.  Their is fodder for both points of view.Eyes Wide Shut is a powerful searchlight into the psychology of sexuality and marriage, into truth and honesty, and into the question of who (and what) we really are.  Don't be put off by the pedantic and lunatic silliness of many of the reviews you'll read.

118818,A152C8GYY25HAH,079074841X,Matthew Horner,"[6, 12]","The two most widely anticipated movies of 1999 were George Lucas' Star Wars 1: The Phantom Menace and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. It wasn't hard to predict that both would prove somewhat disappointing, simply because the hype for both pictures went beyond overkill. But Eyes Wide Shut's publicity campaign took a sad and unexpected turn when Kubrick died suddenly... just after completing the film. In the surrealistic circus that was his cinematic life, Kubrick could not have scripted a more dramatic climax to his life. His fanatical fans were no longer in the position of defending only the enigmatic director's latest epic. Now that his life was over, they had to defend the movie's place in his lifetime's body of work. A reviewer at Time magazine proclaimed it ""Kubrick's final, haunting masterpiece,"" a phrase latched onto instantly by Time-Warner's gigantic publicity department.All this puts me in the unhappy position of telling my readers where Eyes Wide Shut probably belongs. It's place in Kubrick's legacy might best be summed up by a quote from T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men: ""This is the way the world ends....not with a bang, but a whimper.""The movie stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, of course. They play Alice and Dr. William Harford, an upper-middle class couple living in London's fashionable West End. One night Alice admits to William that she has had sexual fantasies about a man she met at a party. When he becomes angry over this, she accuses him of hypocrisy. Surely, he has also had fantasies. This fight sends him on an odyssey in which he first takes up with a dead patient's daughter and then with a hooker. Later, he learns of a mysterious private club that allows its members to explore their sexual desires. He manages to get inside the club, but in doing so, he puts himself in more danger than he ever expected....Some people have argued that Eyes Wide Shut works if you perceive William's journey to be a dream. I say that changes nothing. What we have is three hours of watching a couple we wind up caring nothing about, because Kubrick's view is so detached. That cold, intellectual viewpoint, which made 2001: A Space Odyssey [1969] the best movie ever created in its genre, does not work here. Kubrick didn't always use this technique. His Spartacus [1961] was the most intelligent - and arguable, the best - Biblical epic ever filmed. Yet that film succeeded not because of spectacle, but because of its making the characters all too human. It moved everyone who saw it....Still, I don't think that Eyes Wide Shut's being one of his weakest efforts diminishes his legacy in the least. If you look at the works of the greatest directors, you rarely find that their last movies were their best ones. Having directed A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Dr. Strangelove, as well as the two movies mentioned above, I doubt that Kubrick's light will fade anytime soon.To anyone who thinks I have judged Eyes Wide Shut too harshly, I can only say that we usually judge our heroes the harshest.",2,"'not with a bang, but a whimper'",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3036,"['two', 'most', 'widely', 'anticipated', 'movies', '1999', 'were', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Star', 'Wars', '1', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'predict', 'would', 'prove', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'simply', 'hype', 'pictures', 'went', 'overkill', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'publicity', 'campaign', 'took', 'sad', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'when', 'Kubrick', 'died', 'suddenly', 'just', 'completing', 'film', 'surrealistic', 'circus', 'was', 'cinematic', 'life', 'Kubrick', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'scripted', 'more', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'life', 'fanatical', 'fans', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'position', 'defending', 'only', 'enigmatic', 'director', 'latest', 'epic', 'Now', 'life', 'was', 'over', 'had', 'defend', 'movie', 'place', 'lifetime', 'body', 'work', 'reviewer', 'Time', 'magazine', 'proclaimed', 'Kubrick', 'final', 'haunting', 'masterpiece', 'phrase', 'latched', 'instantly', 'Time-Warner', 'gigantic', 'publicity', 'department.All', 'unhappy', 'position', 'telling', 'readers', 'where', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'probably', 'place', 'Kubrick', 'legacy', 'might', 'best', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'quote', 'T.', 'S.', 'Eliot', 'Hollow', 'Men', 'way', 'world', '.not', 'bang', 'whimper', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'course', 'play', 'Alice', 'Dr.', 'William', 'Harford', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'couple', 'living', 'London', 'fashionable', 'West', 'End', 'One', 'night', 'Alice', 'William', 'had', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'man', 'met', 'party', 'When', 'angry', 'hypocrisy', 'Surely', 'also', 'had', 'fantasies', 'fight', 'odyssey', 'first', 'up', 'dead', 'patient', 'daughter', 'then', 'hooker', 'Later', 'mysterious', 'private', 'club', 'members', 'explore', 'sexual', 'desires', 'get', 'club', 'doing', 'so', 'more', 'danger', 'ever', 'expected', '.Some', 'people', 'have', 'argued', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'perceive', 'William', 'journey', 'be', 'dream', 'say', 'changes', 'nothing', 'What', 'have', 'three', 'hours', 'watching', 'couple', 'wind', 'up', 'caring', 'nothing', 'about', 'Kubrick', 'view', 'so', 'detached', 'cold', 'intellectual', 'viewpoint', 'made', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', '[', '1969', ']', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'created', 'genre', 'not', 'work', 'here', 'Kubrick', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'use', 'technique', 'Spartacus', '[', '1961', ']', 'was', 'most', 'intelligent', 'arguable', 'best', 'Biblical', 'epic', 'ever', 'filmed', 'film', 'succeeded', 'not', 'spectacle', 'making', 'characters', 'too', 'human', 'moved', 'everyone', 'who', 'saw', '.Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'being', 'one', 'weakest', 'efforts', 'legacy', 'least', 'look', 'works', 'greatest', 'directors', 'rarely', 'find', 'last', 'movies', 'were', 'best', 'ones', 'Having', 'directed', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Shining', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'doubt', 'Kubrick', 'light', 'will', 'fade', 'anytime', 'soon.To', 'anyone', 'who', 'have', 'judged', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'too', 'harshly', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'usually', 'judge', 'heroes', 'harshest']",N/A

The major problems of marriage as well as between men and women potrayed in Mr. Kubrick's masterpiece were so true. One of my friends visited me during I was watching the movie on DVD, and we talked about his crisis that his present-girlfriend called him when he was having dinner with his ex-girlfriend. Of course, my friend told his present-girlfriend that he was accompanied by his mother. I said to him maybe his girlfriend was unfaithful too. He replied determinedly, &quot;No, definitely not. she is a good girl.&quot; 20 minutes after I saw the argument between Cruise and Kidman, the everlasting problem popped out in front of my eyes, in our mortal world.

I can simply say they are pathetic, for they lack one of the most wonderful traits given to human beings--appreciating art, and they are not even willing to spend two minutes thinking about the meaning of the film.  What I have to mention is the score of Eyes Wide Shut was purely fascinating. Shostakovich's Jazz Waltz 2 echoed throughout my mind for over a week after I saw the movie. I watched the movie with my mom and she enjoyed it a lot, which also made her think about her &quot;life&quot;.I saw Eyes Wide Shut in Taiwan so luckily I got the uncensored version. The additional scenes were just more nudes in action, which did not add anything to the story. I did not realized the fact until I bought the DVD in Canada, when I found certain scenes were missing.

Hickey,"[179, 193]","Kubrick's final effort is also his greatest masterpiece: a humane and expressionistic fable, endlessly complex and guardedly optimistic.A few notes about the Blu-Ray disc of ""Eyes Wide Shut:""The Blu-Ray is the unrated version of the film, meaning it does not have those CGI figures added to the orgy scenes to obscure the simulated sex.  (The CGI figures were added in order to secure a U.S. theatrical release rating of ""R,"" without Kubrick's input; their only purpose was censorship.  The version released on Blu-Ray, which was released theatrically in Europe but until now has not been available in the U.S., restores those shots to the way Kubrick filmed them.)The Blu-Ray disc contains all of the special features from the standard-definition DVD in the boxed DVD set, and they are interesting enough.  The aspect-ratio of the Blu-Ray is 16x9, which is a vast improvement over the old 3x4 DVD, as 16x9 is much closer to the theatrical aspect-ratio for which the film's shots were composed. The High-Definition film transfer is beautiful, pristine, the images luminous and rich.  For a film as beautifully photographed as this, in which the texture of the image conveys essential, visceral meaning, the difference between High-Definition and Standard Def might make the difference between fully receiving the film and not.If you've gone Hi Def and are thinking of buying this to replace your old standard-def 3x4 DVD, by all means do so.

I knew that with Stanley Kubrick it would be hit or miss. I like some of the late director's film, but others I could do without. This is one of the latter, and it's a shame it had to be Kubrick's final piece.From the confusing ""mask"" scenario to that piercing piano key music (if you can call IT that), this film was a mess from beginning to end. I suppose I saw it because I was curious. It got so much hype for being sexually provocative, namely for an orgy scene. Maybe what was so controversial about it was that you finally saw Tom and Nicole making out, which at least for a moment squashed his gay rumors.But there was nothing overly shocking in the sexual realm in this film. As a matter of fact, the ""orgy"" was very cleverly blocked in many places by strategically-placed potted plants. Instead, there was moping, brooding, and emptiness. There was absolutely no point to the plot, and when you finally, FINALLY get to the end, it's a kind of....huh???Did the producers really think that Cruise and Kidman star power would carry this movie??? How dumb do they think audiences are? You know, we do want some kind of resolution, some kind of substance to our movies. Not just scary music, not just see-through camisole tops, not just orgy scenes. It has to make sense, and quite simply, this movie did not.

His wanderings take him, among other scenarios, to a creepy orgy at the opulent meeting place of a secret society.I expected to see an intelligent, erotic masterpiece; instead, I found the film to have a depressingly exploitative, sleazy feel. The much hyped orgy scenes are utterly lifeless, and even laughable. The normally charismatic Cruise barely registers as the wandering physician. Actually, the only moment of fun in the movie comes with Alan Cumming's delightful cameo as a giddy desk attendant.I left this film wondering: Was Kubrick deliberately making a parody of a pretentious, would-be erotic &quot;art&quot; film?

Kubrick's technical brilliance with color schemes, sets and camera work is in full effect here.

Personally, I prefer films which build a dreamlike state in which tension is increased steadily throughout but that is my preference.  If you don't have an affinity for these types of movies then you might have been turned off by the intentially slow pace of the film, a pace which is reflected not only in how the film is shot but how the characters speak their lines.Eyes Wide Shut is a great film that becomes richer and more enveloping with each viewing. It requires patience, demands attention, and allows one to think about its characters and the subtle nuances in their dialogue exchanges in the context of its theme about the possibility of marital infidelity in a fragile marriage. Some have seen it once and hated it only to gradually admire it on second viewing. Do yourself a favor: in this mindless time of mediocre films, check out Kubrick's last film ""Eyes Wide Shut.""

I truly believe actors make or break a movie. As such, this film could have been very good, but suffers deplorably from a lack of quality acting. Tom Cruise is not a favorite of mine, but does a passable job as the manicspouse of a woman who shares her thoughts of infidelity.I found Kidman's performance (as so often is the case with this highly overrated actress) substandard, to say the least. Gratuitous shots of her boney, barenaked assets (no less than three of them in the first third of the film with no context whatsoever) does not qualify as fine acting. The nauseatingly phony delivery she gives as a drunken party reveler at the beginning of the film sets the pace for the rest of the movie, in which she makes a miserable (and somewhat laughable) attempt at getting stoned in one scene and offers a pathetically false display of artificial emotion after relating a bad dream to her ""husband"" in another.Other directors besides Kubrick have capitalized on Kidman's latent narcissism and tendency toward exhibitionism in order to mask the artificial quality of her acting. Cold Mountain and Fur:  An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus are two recent examples that come to mind. Time and time again, Ms. Kidman makes acting choices that showcase her alleged physical ""beauty"" rather than reveal her true skill as a convincing and reliable actor. Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. Actresses such as Charlize Theron, Hilary Swank, and Cate Blanchett are exceptional not only because their physical beauty resonates on film when they portray ""ordinary"" women, but because they are willing to manipulate and transcend traditional images of beauty in order to explore other facets of female experience. Not ironically, Kidman finally received her prized golden statue when she dared to portray someone other than a shadow of her own superficial self in The Hours.Personally, I found the subject matter of the film and the scenes involving the sex rituals to be provocative.

This is in sharp contrast to most of his other work, where Kubrick consistently portrayed the less attractive aspects of human nature.  Eyes Wide Shut, on the other hand, is exhilarating in its final affirmation of the value of trust and love.  Listen to Alice's closing monologue, which basically sums up what this viewer suspects what Kubrick was trying to say about living a meaningfully adult life.Visually, the film is stunning, and SO characteristiclly Kubrick; fans will delight in the precise composition of scenes, the tracking shots, the use of saturated primary colors, the use of light and shadow.My only quibble with this DVD edition is that it is presented in a full-screen format.  The statement on the package suggests that the director intended the film to be presented in what is described as &quot;the original aspect ratio of the film negative,&quot; or something very close, whatever that means - but I have a tough time swallowing that when the film was presented in wide-screen in theaters.

There's a feeling you get that you must see the movie more than once.The story is about Dr Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice  (Nicole Kidman) and people around them. One night after a they both shared  a reefer, Alice tells Bill a story. A story about she almost was unfaithful  with a another man. Bill becomes so jealous of her that he decides to do  the same to her. Into the night he search after revenge, but he doesn't  know what to come.I see Eyes Wide Shut as a kind of operetta. It's has  that grand feeling of everything being topp class. There's always something  rich to it, pun intended. It's not ""Days of thunder"" nor is it ""Far and  away"". It's a Stanley Kubrick movie. And when it's that kind of a movie,  you have a lot to expect. To understand this movie, you must be a Kubrick  fan. If not, try to see some of his old movies first. Try with ""2001 - A  space odyssey"" or ""Barry Lyndon"". Try to understand what his movies tries  to tell. Stanley's movies were more than movies, they were a work of art.  Success to him didn't matter and you can see that in his movies.My last  final notes on this movie, this isn't Stanley's best movie but that doesn't  make it his worst.

They were expecting something flashy and maybe action as we were going to look at Tom Cruise and Nicole Kiddman and their ""star power"" was going to draw audiences unlike before.  But there were no explosions, no car chases, and literally not a lot of action.  This was not meant to be one of those movies, it was a train of thought with a heady, dreamlike atmosphere.Tom Cruise is on a sort of spiritual journey, as he gets it into his head that he wants to cheat on his wife.  He is presented with several situations in which to cheat, but something goes wrong each time and he never physically does.  It's about temptations, having that wonderful little bauble dangling before you and it's just beyond your reach.  A part of us wants it, wants it so badly, but we have to practice some discipline.  Don't be greedy, don't be selfish, and don't talk yourself into thinking that just this one time won't hurt.  It might be deeply satisfying to eat that candy bar now, but in the end it's just a candy bar, you'll be jogging many miles to burn it off, and you're better off not eating it.Some criticism?  It's a LONG movie, and you get very restless throughout.  I wish they had given Nicole Kidman more of a part, as I think her cream long since rose above Tom's even before they broke up.

118845,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,079074841X,Mr. Cairene,"[5, 11]","Years had elapsed between one of his films and the next, yet to all,even his detractors, a new Stanley Kubrick picture was always anevent. Perhaps the most intriguing of directors, his films were so fewand far between because Kubrick, unlike every living filmmaker, had toinvent a new language with which to tell his bold, perplexing andalways rewarding stories. Few people agree on the merits of hisfilms.  Yet, as I dislike some of his work, I can understand people's appreciation of it.What a shame it is then to see Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Abloodless, joyless and yes, shallow whimper of an exit. The reviewsfor the film have a morbid fascination all their own, theysystematically and often passionately analyse and search for meaningfor what is essentially eye candy. These reviews say more about thereviewers then they do about the film. Kubrick's weighty name hasprompted film lovers to offer explanations, excuses and delusionsabout the undoubtedly profound journey of one Dr. Bill Hartford (TomCruise), who after hearing his wife's all to brief confession tofantasising about another man, goes on an all night odyssey to regainhis sexual prowess. The meaning of life must be in there somewhere. Onthe face of it, a film that inspires this much reflection, even if itis for the wrong reason, can only be a good thing. Then again, applythat level of sincere analysis to a soft-core cable show, and theresults will perhaps yield greater insight.But Eyes Wide Shut istoo lifeless to be compared to soft-core, although the dialogue isoften reminiscent of those embarrassing late night excuses for ashag. Dr. Bill's bizarre habit of repeating the last sentence saidto him in almost all his conversations aside (my guess is that thecharacter is supposed to be a little dim or perhaps untainted by thepolitics of life), the character is about as human as you can get in aKubrick film, which puts him a few notches below Hal from 2001. It istempting to blame the stars, who often resort to furiously rubbingtheir temples to suggest inner-conflict, but that would be unfair. Inthe brief documentary that follows the film, Kidman says that Kubricklet the actors try as many things as they liked before both, theactors and Kubrick jointly, decided which take to print. Try as theymight, with this strangulate script and this fatal precision, theresimply is nothing there.Eyes Wide Shut is not without merit. Thefilm's washed out colours, the elegant tracking shots, the patientmise-en-scene, the incendiary and brilliant use of music promise greatmystery, a foreboding malice. An absorbing prevarication that flirtswith the border that seperates dreams and nightmares, but is undone,at a snail's pace with a plot that can only be calledpreposterous. The disappointment is not unlike that of RidleyScott's The Duellists, a striking film whose aesthetic richnesssimilarly proved to be a glossy ribbon around nothing. In a film aslacking as this one obviously is, the presence of good scenes likeKidman's confession and the grandiose orgy sequence (censored inthe US version) are a juxtaposition to its shortcomings. A good storytouts and justifies the style in which it is told, a bad one hidesbehind it. Kubrick, once the inventor of filmic language has regressedinto the age old story of insecurity of two married hollowmasses. Consequently, Eyes Wide Shut is a dramatic, artistic andemotional dead zone.",2,The Sterility Of The Mind's Limitations,974160000,"11 14, 2000",2000,3403,"['Years', 'had', 'elapsed', 'one', 'films', 'next', 'yet', 'even', 'detractors', 'new', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'picture', 'was', 'always', 'anevent', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'intriguing', 'directors', 'films', 'were', 'so', 'fewand', 'far', 'Kubrick', 'living', 'filmmaker', 'had', 'toinvent', 'new', 'language', 'tell', 'bold', 'perplexing', 'andalways', 'rewarding', 'stories', 'Few', 'people', 'agree', 'merits', 'hisfilms', 'Yet', 'dislike', 'work', 'can', 'understand', 'people', 'appreciation', 'it.What', 'shame', 'then', 'see', 'Kubrick', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Abloodless', 'joyless', 'yes', 'shallow', 'whimper', 'exit', 'reviewsfor', 'film', 'have', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'own', 'theysystematically', 'often', 'passionately', 'analyse', 'search', 'meaningfor', 'what', 'essentially', 'eye', 'candy', 'reviews', 'say', 'more', 'thereviewers', 'then', 'do', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'weighty', 'name', 'hasprompted', 'film', 'lovers', 'offer', 'explanations', 'excuses', 'undoubtedly', 'profound', 'journey', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'Hartford', 'TomCruise', 'who', 'hearing', 'wife', 'brief', 'confession', 'tofantasising', 'man', 'night', 'odyssey', 'regainhis', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'meaning', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'there', 'somewhere', 'Onthe', 'face', 'film', 'much', 'reflection', 'even', 'itis', 'wrong', 'reason', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'Then', 'again', 'level', 'sincere', 'analysis', 'soft-core', 'cable', 'show', 'theresults', 'will', 'perhaps', 'yield', 'greater', 'insight.But', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'istoo', 'lifeless', 'be', 'compared', 'soft-core', 'dialogue', 'isoften', 'reminiscent', 'embarrassing', 'late', 'night', 'excuses', 'ashag', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'bizarre', 'habit', 'repeating', 'last', 'sentence', 'saidto', 'almost', 'conversations', 'aside', 'guess', 'thecharacter', 'supposed', 'be', 'little', 'dim', 'perhaps', 'untainted', 'thepolitics', 'life', 'character', 'as', 'human', 'can', 'get', 'aKubrick', 'film', 'few', 'notches', 'Hal', '2001', 'istempting', 'blame', 'stars', 'who', 'often', 'resort', 'furiously', 'rubbingtheir', 'temples', 'suggest', 'inner-conflict', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'Inthe', 'brief', 'documentary', 'film', 'Kidman', 'Kubricklet', 'actors', 'try', 'many', 'things', 'liked', 'theactors', 'Kubrick', 'jointly', 'decided', 'take', 'print', 'Try', 'theymight', 'strangulate', 'script', 'fatal', 'precision', 'theresimply', 'nothing', 'there.Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'not', 'merit', 'Thefilm', 'washed', 'out', 'colours', 'elegant', 'tracking', 'shots', 'patientmise-en-scene', 'incendiary', 'brilliant', 'use', 'music', 'promise', 'greatmystery', 'foreboding', 'malice', 'absorbing', 'prevarication', 'border', 'dreams', 'nightmares', 'undone', 'snail', 'pace', 'plot', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'calledpreposterous', 'disappointment', 'not', 'RidleyScott', 'Duellists', 'striking', 'film', 'aesthetic', 'richnesssimilarly', 'proved', 'be', 'glossy', 'ribbon', 'nothing', 'film', 'aslacking', 'one', 'obviously', 'presence', 'good', 'scenes', 'likeKidman', 'confession', 'grandiose', 'orgy', 'sequence', 'censored', 'inthe', 'US', 'version', 'are', 'juxtaposition', 'shortcomings', 'good', 'storytouts', 'style', 'told', 'bad', 'one', 'hidesbehind', 'Kubrick', 'once', 'inventor', 'filmic', 'language', 'regressedinto', 'age', 'old', 'story', 'insecurity', 'two', 'married', 'hollowmasses', 'Consequently', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'dramatic', 'artistic', 'andemotional', 'dead', 'zone']",N/A

His films are traditionally a little more tense and slower paced that the typical ""Blow something up every 3 minutes"" movie.  That's 100% good with me so right away I was expecting a Kubrick-esque film.Man did I ever get it!  This was a very intricate look at how relationships work and what each of our expectations can be like.  We clearly assume WAY too much and this film really highlights that fact well.  You can feel the frustration of Tom Cruise's character as his wife reveals her inner-most fantasies and secrets.  How could this be he thinks?  Well, that's what ""Eyes Wide Shut"" means!  He sees everything around him but doesn't actually ""see it"".  His classic view of how Men think and how Women think is all but blown to shreds by his wifes revelations.  Nearly every situation he gets in he is tempted or at least has to deal with a sexual gratification offer and has a hard time escaping.  Its almost as if he is being tested by the marriage gods or something.  Great concept, very cool.The mansion orgy/sex costume party scene was very dreamy and erotic... it could even be a little frightening only because this is very over the top stuff for the ""Joneses"" in the world and you really had no freegin idea what the hell Stanley was up to.  I mean what the frick were these people thinking?  Either way, like a train wreck,you can't possibly look away!  I had no idea what to expect with this scene and as usual, Stanley shot it just perfectly with that artsy touch combined with palpable tension.  There was a lot of nudity but it was never ""dirty"", at least in principle so I had no problem with it.  The Euro version has even more skin.I will say that the end was rather abrupt and a few loose ends remained but overall I liked this movie a lot and will probably purchase it.I will warn you though... it is classic Kubrick style with longer scenes, slower pacing, and plenty of build up before much happens.  It is beautifully filmed though and it was easy to feel immersed in the story.  Just don't expect a slam, bam action flick.HIGHLY Recommended!",4,"Very Cool...

Kidman's acting as the apparent deceitful wife, the strong imagery, Kubrick's success in making the naked female body seem ugly (definitely matching what's going on in our protagonist's perception).  If the movie took place at the turn of the century, in Europe, and maybe someone else playing Tom Cruise's character, this picture would definitely be a masterpiece, and a definite addition to Kubrick's classics.Unfortunately, the choice to do the husband/wife celebrity matchup and having it take place in 1990's New York makes the reality established in the film a bit implausible.  This is New York, 1990's, many years after John Updike and John Cheever, let alone decades of film of Suburban America that undermines a bizarre party/ritual so to say.  American Beauty would more successfully match 1990s New York than what Kubrick has created here.  There's too much European customery and attitudes, and too much sense of the original story's time period permeated in Kubrick's 1990's New York that it's too hard to take seriously.  Then there's Tom Cruise's schtick of handing out his business card saying ""I'm a doctor.""  Maybe in turn of the century Europe where a doctor would always be deemed dignified no matter what he does, but in 1990's New York City?  No, don't open the store for him, yes, throw the John (i.e. Tom Cruise) into the slammer.

118858,A14SOHUCCL0606,079074841X,Nowhere Man,"[11, 15]","Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a disaster but one that only it's legendary director could have made.  I was intrigued when I found out that Kubrick had used Schnitzler's &quot;A Dream Story&quot; for his  source material.  In this short story, Schnitzler very gracefully  orchestrates a journey between the conscious world of a successful doctor  (Fridolin) and the dream-like world he moves into during his nighttime  odyssey.  There his combined feelings of sexual jealousy and sexual terror  lead him to imagine (or to overreact to) a menacing masked ball that he's  secretly gained entrance to.What's wonderful about the Schnitzler story  is that it has the pull and logic of a dream - situations are not  resolvable or explicable and yet the action is guided by some unknowable  force.  It's a delicately etched mystery (what happens to the costumer's  daughter? who are the masked ball partipants? who is the dead girl?) that  Schnitzler conjures and dispels without tying up loose ends.  Much like the  &quot;Nighttown&quot; chapter in Ulysses, the characters that Fridolin  encounter seem as much as projection of his subconscious fears and desire  as they do actual people.Very few directors have ever been able to  successfully merge dream worldswith the actual one and, sorry, Kubrick  isn't one of them. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; doesn't have the graceful  lyricism of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; nor the haunting starkness of  &quot;Persona&quot; nor the surreal comic touches of &quot;Belle de  Jour&quot;It is as stitled and unconvincing a film as &quot;The  Shining&quot; and for much the same reasons. Since Kubrick keeps us at a  clincal distance from his characters - especially the poorly conceived Tom  Cruise doctor - the viewer can never really associate the nighttime odyssey  with anything that's supposed to be going on inside his head. And  consequently, Cruise's nighttime odyssey seems all too arbitrary - even the  masked ball doesn't make much sense - and, what is worse, even moralistic  (good sex is staying at home, bad sex is Satanic orgies).  Worse still,  Kubrick corrupts the mystery in Schnitzler's novella - the costumer's  mysterious clients in Schnitzer become two Asian buffoons in  &quot;Eyes&quot;, the fate of the pianist is explained in the movie and  Kubrick links the woman in the morgue with the orgy (never done in  Schnitzler).  For a film that wants to put us in a dream world, Kubrick  cancels out all the mystery that might have engaged us (imagine, for  instance, in the last scene, when Nicole tells Tom that there's something  they must do right away: how much more enticing it would have been if  Kubrick cut to the credits before she gave her answer).Far worse than  the material's outdatedness is the fact that Kubrick, rather than accepting  the challenge that it presented, subjected the story to the Full Kubrick  Treatment. The visuals are superb and Kubrick handles the camera like a  master but his Olympian approach to filmmaking is wholly inappropriate  here.  Those who like Kubrick's work (as I generally do) probably see this  as a masterpiece because he's given his standard treatment to a wholly new  subject matter; I was rather hoping that &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; would  mark a departure for Kubrick, a recognition that not everything could be  rationalized and explained under his critical gaze.  Instead of  appreciating Schintzler's nuances and rhythms, he kills them and drains the  life out of the story and &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; consequently is like a  beautiful corpse lying in the morgue.",2,A Failure that only Kubrick could make,953596800,"03 21, 2000",2000,3603,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'disaster', 'one', 'legendary', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'was', 'intrigued', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'used', 'Schnitzler', 'quot', 'A', 'Dream', 'Story', 'quot', 'source', 'material', 'short', 'story', 'Schnitzler', 'very', 'gracefully', 'journey', 'conscious', 'world', 'successful', 'doctor', 'Fridolin', 'dream-like', 'world', 'nighttime', 'odyssey', 'combined', 'feelings', 'sexual', 'jealousy', 'sexual', 'terror', 'lead', 'imagine', 'overreact', 'menacing', 'masked', 'ball', 'secretly', 'gained', 'entrance', 'to.What', 'wonderful', 'Schnitzler', 'story', 'pull', 'logic', 'dream', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'resolvable', 'explicable', 'yet', 'action', 'guided', 'unknowable', 'force', 'delicately', 'etched', 'mystery', 'what', 'costumer', 'daughter', 'who', 'are', 'masked', 'ball', 'partipants', 'who', 'dead', 'girl', 'Schnitzler', 'conjures', 'dispels', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Much', 'quot', 'Nighttown', 'quot', 'chapter', 'Ulysses', 'characters', 'Fridolin', 'encounter', 'seem', 'as', 'much', 'projection', 'subconscious', 'fears', 'desire', 'do', 'actual', 'people.Very', 'few', 'directors', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'successfully', 'merge', 'dream', 'actual', 'one', 'sorry', 'Kubrick', ""n't"", 'one', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', ""n't"", 'have', 'graceful', 'lyricism', 'quot', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'quot', 'haunting', 'starkness', 'quot', 'Persona', 'quot', 'surreal', 'comic', 'touches', 'quot', 'Belle', 'Jour', 'quot', 'stitled', 'unconvincing', 'film', 'quot', 'Shining', 'quot', 'much', 'same', 'reasons', 'Kubrick', 'clincal', 'distance', 'characters', 'especially', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'doctor', 'viewer', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'associate', 'nighttime', 'odyssey', 'anything', 'supposed', 'be', 'going', 'head', 'consequently', 'Cruise', 'nighttime', 'odyssey', 'too', 'arbitrary', 'even', 'masked', 'ball', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'what', 'worse', 'even', 'moralistic', 'good', 'sex', 'staying', 'home', 'bad', 'sex', 'Satanic', 'orgies', 'Worse', 'still', 'Kubrick', 'mystery', 'Schnitzler', 'novella', 'costumer', 'mysterious', 'clients', 'Schnitzer', 'become', 'two', 'Asian', 'buffoons', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'fate', 'pianist', 'explained', 'movie', 'Kubrick', 'woman', 'morgue', 'orgy', 'never', 'done', 'Schnitzler', 'film', 'put', 'dream', 'world', 'Kubrick', 'out', 'mystery', 'might', 'have', 'engaged', 'imagine', 'instance', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'Nicole', 'Tom', 'something', 'must', 'do', 'right', 'away', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'enticing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Kubrick', 'cut', 'credits', 'gave', 'answer', 'worse', 'material', 'outdatedness', 'fact', 'Kubrick', 'rather', 'accepting', 'challenge', 'presented', 'subjected', 'story', 'Full', 'Kubrick', 'Treatment', 'visuals', 'are', 'superb', 'Kubrick', 'camera', 'master', 'Olympian', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'wholly', 'inappropriate', 'here', 'who', 'like', 'Kubrick', 'work', 'generally', 'do', 'probably', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'given', 'standard', 'treatment', 'wholly', 'new', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'rather', 'hoping', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'would', 'mark', 'departure', 'Kubrick', 'recognition', 'not', 'everything', 'could', 'be', 'rationalized', 'explained', 'critical', 'gaze', 'Instead', 'appreciating', 'Schintzler', 'nuances', 'rhythms', 'life', 'story', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'consequently', 'beautiful', 'corpse', 'lying', 'morgue']",N/A

I have to say one thing though, and that is to not expect a simple, fast-paced film that you regularly expect from its stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  The film is slow, sometimes boring, but all together rewarding and very  impressive.  It's interesting to see this film unfold because it takes a  while for it to get it's feet on the ground.  Kubrick's deft direction is  used with the sincerety and careful perfection of his previous films, and  in here it is every bit as apparent and worthy.  I would have personally  liked to have seen more of Kidman in the movie (those who have seen it are  now saying, what? Didn't you see enough of her), but I'm not talking about  her nude scenes, but her performance is really a supporting character.  The  end to most of the people who watch this movie will be a relief, but like  Hitchcock's film work, Kubrick's work only gets better the more times you  see it.  This film is highly recommended for those seeking well-structured  drama, but this is by no means the suspense-filled movie it has sometimes  claimed to be.

If you want proof that Kubrick was a brilliant man and knew what he was doing, read any quote of his in any book about him.  He makes films for  people who are not programmed to judge movies based on Hollywood formulas.  This is Kubrick's most artistic and lyrically crafted film. It is just  beautiful to watch regardless of anything else. There is plenty to think  about too, especially for psychology fans. Schnitzler was after all a  cohort of Freud.  Notice how every sexual encounter Bill has in the movie  mixes the specters of eros and thanatos, what Freud calls the life instinct  and the death instinct.  Look for signs of death mixed with the erotic  aspects. There's plenty. Look how there is a Christmas tree in every scene  except the orgy, and in one scene, Bill turns off the Christmas lights.  What is the significance? Janet Maslin from the New York Times called  Kubrick's movies &quot;irresistible intellectual catnip&quot;, and she's  right, there is much to mull over in this exquisite film.As for the  aspect ratio, RELAX everyone. Read the note Amazon.com has. Kubrick wanted  it this way. You're not missing any picture, you're actually seeing more  than you saw in the theater.

This film trudges along at such a slow pace that even the most devote film enthusiast will be fighting to stay awake. At 2 1/2  hours, the film is vastly overlong and this is evident from the first scene  that involves a party that never seems to end. The acting is okay although  Nicole Kidman's character is annoying. Fortunately, her scenes are minimal.  Photography and set decoration is excellent with rich saturated colors and  impressive houses and decor. This is the film's only redeeming quality. The  whole feel of the film can be summarized by Nicole Kidman's final line.  Stanley Kubrick has made some of our most memorable films and it is sad  that this had to be his swan song.

Considering the mindset that Kubrick had been in since ""Dr. Strangelove"", I always found it a little disappointing when Kubrick came out with something that somebody else, like Alan Rudolph or Robert Altman, could have easily made. Tell the truth...weren't you a WEE bit disappointed when ""The Shining"" came out not long after ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope"" transformed the cinematic landscape? I know ((I)) was eager to see what Stan the Man had waiting in the wings to answer to the only movie to give his ""2001"" a run for its money.What we have here is a study of what life for a pretty yuppie couple is like shortly after confessions of adulterous fantasies by the wife, played by Nicole Kidman are delineated in private. This gets her doctor husband, unrealistically portrayed by Tom Cruise, to thinking of perhaps entertaining his OWN thoughts of infidelity! This takes him on an odyssey, (if you'll forgive the pun,) involving death, the services of a friendly prostitute, and a cryptic encounter with a secret society of sexual wantons apparently populated by some very important people from all over. After a long week of depravity, intrigue and feelings of guilt, Dr. Harford, played by Cruise, goes crying back to his wife and the film ends with their darling little daughter picking out potential Christmas presents in what looks like F.A.O. Schwartz.One thing Kubrick definitely brought to this film was his prerequisite, post-""2001"" coldness. The film feels objective, rather than SUB-jective, as if you are part of a psychiatric panel assessing the players for some thesis on the subejct of marital fidelity. The style, however, borrows from a couple of Kubrick's heirs and contemporaries: Federico Fellini and David Lynch. The secret society sex club scenes are classic Lynch. The matter-of-fact nudity and suggested sexual hijinx, the eerie music played during these scenes, give it a ""Fellini Satyricon"" or ""Roma"" sort of feel.....  That, and the outright weirdness and quietness of the scene helps it throw off a ""Twin Peaks"" aspect as well. You half expect a dancing dwarf to pop up any second. And yes, the cinematography is excellent...a Kubrick hallmark since ""Spartacus"". However, there is none of the Kubrick ""substance"" here, the way I remember perceiving it...none of the gimlet-eyed take on man's behavior, as in ""Dr. Strangelove"",""Clockwork Orange"" or ""Barry Lyndon""; almost NONE of the humor you usually see in a Kubrick movie. No...this time it's a given that man is slime, and events in the story just follow a natural denouement. The ending is somewhat unsatisfying, not quite as bad as the ending to ""Rosemary's Baby""....but you keep on wondering: ""when's the other shoe going to drop?"" and then one doesn't. FIE!It is such a damned shame that we lost Stanley soon after this film was completed, because I would have loved to have eventually SEEN his answer to ""Star Wars"" or ""Alien"" or perhaps ""Total Recall"", all excellent sci-fi movies that owe a lot to him and his inimitable style.

118876,ATJ49YUETUQOC,079074841X,PositiveLastAction,"[15, 22]","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is nothing short of a true artistic masterwork from the late, great extraordinary Stanley Kubrick. It is a subtle film, yet so opulent and rich...complex and beautiful in its overt simplicity and less recognizable complexity.  What does it teach and tell us about men, women, and the human condition? Maybe many things and perhaps nothing at all.  None really matters here as we interpret as needed and are entertained immensely all the same.  Cruise and Kidman are surprisingly well cast in this film , both turning in wonderful performances and obviously enjoying their roles respectively.  Dr. Harford (Cruise) as your successful ""everyman""..inherently riddled with human weakness that so often plagues the male.  And Alice (Kidman), the stronger female counterpart figure, the possessor who inherently also possesses tremendous needs. This dynamic sparks both a complex and fascinating friction.  I would not be a dignified Kubrick fan if I didn't put a word in about the brilliant lighting and cinematography...as with other Kubrick films, they are extraordinary.  We are treated to the soft, almost opaque lighting that evokes a dreamlike quality, symbiotic with major elements of the storyline. As opposed to the mostly white lighting seen in ""Clockwork"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"" promulgates color!..yet does so in soft, sensitive and consistent Christmas themed fashion.  Perhaps one of the favorite moments was the flirtatious dance between Alice (Kidman) and Sandor Svavost (played by the brilliant Sky Dumont).  There are the splendid aromas of ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Shining"" and ""the Wickerman"" here...all classics in their own right. And of course, the score! Kubrick had a unique talent for sourcing music that creates a perfect symbiosis for his films. Jocelyn Pook's haunting songs accent the film perfectly...especially the mesmerizing piece that we hear during the ceremony in the Mansion!..this piece of music sent chills straight up my spine.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is layered and eternally deep...like your favorite glass of Merlot or classic Poem.

118877,A23VBURIWZPRR2,079074841X,purplehaloz,"[7, 7]","I think a lot of people were bothered by this film not because of any actual flaws in the filmmaking- far from it, the film is visually stunning, with incredible use of light and color, well-acted and innovative editing  and use of sound,  and just the right amount of dramatic tension to make  the point.The film's plot revolves around a successful, imperfect, unsaintly yet decent doctor going to the depths of his own psyche, broken yet capable of real healing and  renewal of his basic underlying humanity. Some viewers were bothered because, instead of going to outer space or the depraved streets of a violent,  futuristic world, this last opus of remarkable Stanley Kubrick went instead  to a previously uncharted territory- that of the human soul.A man who  never ""sold out"", who never bowed to peer pressure to conform, or  mold his vision to suit the status-quo expectations of Hollywood, would  naturally be drawn to exploring the psyche of a man and his wife whose  marriage is in serious danger from forces both within and ouside them. The  dramatic tension dissipates only after the young doctor confronts his own  demons and opens up to his wife, at the sight of the lost mask on his  pillow next to her in the wee morning hours.The shadowy, sex-centered  masquerade debacle at the opulent mansion is no different in principle than  the carefree party at the home of one of the masquerade guests' mansion.  Casual, meaningless liasons are the order of the night and the host is  caught nearly with his pants down with the hapless prostitute who has  passed out from the glossed over brutality at the hands of her client.Games are played only with permission in such a world as Kubrick portrays  in Eyes Wide Shut, a world peopled with those who use power and money to  control the less agressive, and whomsoever wants to play must play their  rules, not their own. Kubrick's legacy is that of a man who refused to play  by anyone's rules but his own, and whose insight, vision and cinematic  genius survived the games and threats. To be your own man in such a world  is not something to take for granted, as hard as that may be for some to  understand.",5,Eyes Wide Shut: Exploring the depths of the human soul,951782400,"02 29, 2000",2000,2167,"['think', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'bothered', 'film', 'not', 'actual', 'flaws', 'filmmaking-', 'far', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'incredible', 'use', 'light', 'color', 'well-acted', 'innovative', 'editing', 'use', 'sound', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'make', 'point.The', 'film', 'plot', 'successful', 'imperfect', 'unsaintly', 'yet', 'decent', 'doctor', 'going', 'depths', 'own', 'psyche', 'broken', 'yet', 'capable', 'real', 'healing', 'renewal', 'basic', 'underlying', 'humanity', 'viewers', 'were', 'bothered', 'because', 'instead', 'going', 'outer', 'space', 'depraved', 'streets', 'violent', 'futuristic', 'world', 'last', 'opus', 'remarkable', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'went', 'instead', 'previously', 'uncharted', 'territory-', 'human', 'soul.A', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'sold', 'out', 'who', 'never', 'bowed', 'peer', 'pressure', 'conform', 'mold', 'vision', 'suit', 'status-quo', 'expectations', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'naturally', 'be', 'drawn', 'exploring', 'psyche', 'man', 'wife', 'marriage', 'serious', 'danger', 'forces', 'ouside', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'only', 'young', 'doctor', 'own', 'demons', 'up', 'wife', 'sight', 'lost', 'mask', 'pillow', 'next', 'wee', 'morning', 'hours.The', 'shadowy', 'sex-centered', 'masquerade', 'debacle', 'opulent', 'mansion', 'different', 'principle', 'carefree', 'party', 'home', 'one', 'masquerade', 'guests', 'mansion', 'Casual', 'meaningless', 'liasons', 'are', 'order', 'night', 'host', 'caught', 'nearly', 'pants', 'down', 'hapless', 'prostitute', 'who', 'passed', 'out', 'glossed', 'brutality', 'hands', 'client.Games', 'are', 'played', 'only', 'permission', 'world', 'Kubrick', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'world', 'peopled', 'who', 'use', 'power', 'money', 'control', 'less', 'agressive', 'whomsoever', 'play', 'must', 'play', 'rules', 'not', 'own', 'Kubrick', 'legacy', 'man', 'who', 'refused', 'play', 'anyone', 'rules', 'own', 'insight', 'vision', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'survived', 'games', 'threats', 'be', 'own', 'man', 'world', 'not', 'something', 'take', 'granted', 'as', 'hard', 'may', 'be', 'understand']",N/A

I won't begin to review the film itself except to say that it's probably Kubrick's least appreciated and most underrated film--undeservedly so-- I personally think it's just as brilliant as his other works. See it more than once before you decide.That said, the new Warner release has some flaws.  The disk is supposed to contain BOTH versions of the film (unrated and rated), but it ONLY contains the unrated version (better that than just the rated one!). But the packaging says it contains both, so there's a big boo-boo.

Eyes Wide Shut has a poignant musical score that forbids you to remove yourself from the action, and bold cinematography and camera movement that makes the most mundane scenes absolutely breathtaking. For his final film, Kubrick rounded up the most fitting actors for the job; treated each shot purposefully and individually; and still managed to produce a film that did justice to his entire career - a film that has inspired a lesser but devoted following and divided critics worldwide.Eyes Wide Shut follows Dr. Bill Harford - the main character of the movie, but hardly a dynamic one; he acts more as a guide than a real character - into different dimensions of New York life. Prompted by the confession of his wife that she nearly cheated on him a year ago, Bill wanders into a jazz club, an elitist orgy, and a prostitute's apartment, eventually returning to the solace of his own home.Throughout Bill's adventures, the gripping musical score enhances the already suspenseful action and prevents any sort of dull sedation in the audience. The chilling, single piano notes simultaneously mimic the pace of a beating heart and the tingling of a spine.Kubrick's profound understanding of color and composition are stunningly revealed in the film. Ordinary home interiors are brought to life by the dramatic contrast of deep blue windows and bright Christmas trees. In the scene where Dr. Bill and Ziegler discuss the previous night's peculiar occurrences, the library in which they are talking is saturated by the blood red pool table, the green overhanging lamps, and once again, the blue windows. When Dr. Bill moves around the pool table in the beginning of the scene, he becomes centered perfectly in one of the windows, much like Alice Harford, his wife, is framed in the bedroom scene when she confesses her past desires.Perhaps lacking the unforgettable performance of Jack Nicolson in The Shining or the appalling behavior in A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut could be shrugged off as just another weird Kubrick movie. But the presentation of his material, even if the material itself isn't as memorable, is so picturesque and professional that one cannot help but admire the film for its fantastic execution.p.s.-I'd just like to say that people have become so used to the fast lane and everything on the go that when directors attempt to slow things down and focus, people get all antsy about it.

For her, it was her first time. For me, it was the first time since it had originally come out, back in 1999.When it came out, it left many people a little disappointed. Kubrick was a film-making master, and his last film seemed stilted, wooden, and mystifying.While I understand the comments of those days, I have concluded that people who thought in this fashion, well, missed the point. The film is a study in a particular aspect of human behavior: sexuality and sexual behavior within the confines of a marriage.Let's review. One night, following a party the night before where both parties in a married relationship engaged in some flirtatious behavior, the wife admits to having adulterous thoughts one day in the past. This severely unnerves the husband, a doctor, who then is called away due to the death of a patient. What follows is a series of near encounters with morally questionable sexual situations:1. the dead man's daughter confesses her love for the doctor...she herself is engaged to another man2. the doctor meets a prostitute, and goes to her home, and is interrupted before things go too far by a call from his wife3. the doctor needs a costume to go to a party, and encounters what appears to be under-age sex between the costumer's daughter and some businessmen4. the doctor gets caught by the powers-that-be at an orgy for the highest class of societyIn all of these situations, the next day brings home all of the associated dangers with these encounters:1. The fiance answers the phone when the doctor calls, bringing the doctor into conflict with another man2. The prostitute isn't home when the doctor returns...she has AIDS3. The young girl is offered to the doctor by her father...can you imagine the dangers in that?4. The power-that-be hustle one of the doctor's friends out of town by force, have the doctor visibly followed, and appear to have one of the orgies other attendees killed.The affect that this has on the doctor feels palpable and real...you can see it in the way that he looks at his family one evening, thinking that has whole family life is crumbling away, under siege from both his wife's tale, and from the consequences of his own actions and near-infidelity.What comes across as stilted is deliberately so...Kubrick wants folks to understand that certain things are staged, but the consequences of those things can be real. Compare and contrast Thomas Gibson's acting in his encounter with Tom Cruise (and vice-versa), and Cruise's own acting both when he hear's his wife's tale for the first time, and as he becomes more and more terrified of the consequences of his own actions. Kubrick is drawing attention to consequences.This is a set piece, like Lost in Translation, and a well-thought-out one at that. Kubrick's films were never simple ones, even going back to Spartacus. So, those who dismissed Eyes Wide Shut, I suggest you think twice. And for myself, it's time to resume the Kubrick film festival that got interrupted so long ago.",5,Eyes wide open,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3076,"['Last', 'weekend', 'wife', 'watched', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'last', 'film', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'originally', 'come', 'out', 'back', '1999.When', 'came', 'out', 'left', 'many', 'people', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'film-making', 'master', 'last', 'film', 'seemed', 'stilted', 'wooden', 'mystifying.While', 'understand', 'comments', 'days', 'have', 'concluded', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'fashion', 'well', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'study', 'particular', 'aspect', 'human', 'behavior', 'sexuality', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'confines', 'marriage.Let', 'review', 'One', 'night', 'following', 'party', 'night', 'where', 'parties', 'married', 'relationship', 'engaged', 'flirtatious', 'behavior', 'wife', 'having', 'adulterous', 'thoughts', 'one', 'day', 'past', 'severely', 'husband', 'doctor', 'who', 'then', 'called', 'away', 'due', 'death', 'patient', 'What', 'series', 'near', 'encounters', 'morally', 'questionable', 'sexual', 'situations:1.', 'dead', 'man', 'daughter', 'love', 'doctor', 'engaged', 'man2', 'doctor', 'prostitute', 'home', 'interrupted', 'things', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'call', 'wife3', 'doctor', 'costume', 'go', 'party', 'what', 'be', 'under-age', 'sex', 'costumer', 'daughter', 'businessmen4', 'doctor', 'caught', 'powers-that-be', 'orgy', 'highest', 'class', 'societyIn', 'situations', 'next', 'day', 'home', 'associated', 'dangers', 'encounters:1', 'fiance', 'phone', 'when', 'doctor', 'bringing', 'doctor', 'conflict', 'man2', 'prostitute', ""n't"", 'home', 'when', 'doctor', 'returns', 'AIDS3', 'young', 'girl', 'offered', 'doctor', 'father', 'can', 'imagine', 'dangers', '4', 'power-that-be', 'hustle', 'one', 'doctor', 'friends', 'town', 'force', 'have', 'doctor', 'visibly', 'followed', 'appear', 'have', 'one', 'orgies', 'other', 'attendees', 'killed.The', 'affect', 'doctor', 'feels', 'palpable', 'real', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'family', 'one', 'evening', 'thinking', 'whole', 'family', 'life', 'crumbling', 'away', 'siege', 'wife', 'tale', 'consequences', 'own', 'actions', 'near-infidelity.What', 'stilted', 'deliberately', 'so', 'Kubrick', 'folks', 'understand', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'staged', 'consequences', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'Compare', 'contrast', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'acting', 'encounter', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'vice-versa', 'Cruise', 'own', 'acting', 'when', 'hear', 'wife', 'tale', 'first', 'time', 'more', 'more', 'terrified', 'consequences', 'own', 'actions', 'Kubrick', 'drawing', 'attention', 'consequences.This', 'set', 'piece', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'well-thought-out', 'one', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'were', 'never', 'simple', 'ones', 'even', 'going', 'back', 'Spartacus', 'So', 'who', 'dismissed', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'suggest', 'think', 'twice', 'time', 'resume', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'festival', 'got', 'interrupted', 'so', 'long', 'ago']",N/A

The first hour of the film, including the infamous &quot;orgy&quot; scene (which is, for the record, about as erotic as a week-old scrod), is all setup for Tom Cruise's bumbling attempt at mystery-solving in the second half. As such, the first hour is slow and could have been summarized in a sixth the time without us losing anything (Kubrick could have dropped the insanely out-of-date moralizing in the first hour, which would have freed us from the film's unbearable last scene as well). Then we could have gotten focused on the second hour, where Cruise becomes obsessed with figuring out exactly who it is, and why, that wants him to stop asking questions about what he discovered in part one. This is good film, here. Take a guy who's not used to figuring out mysteries and throw him in the middle of one to see what he does. It's a time-tested plot, and it usually comes off well. It does here, too, and in the second hour of this film Cruise turns in his best screen footage since The Firm (surprise, surprise). Then we come to the last scene... and the whole thing falls apart. One would expect Kidman and Cruise to have at least SOME chemistry, them having been married and all, but the whole last scene sounds more like a first-time staged reading than a final film.Not bad, but requires liberal use of the fast-forward button. **",2,Editor!

118893,A361LE16VBQDP8,079074841X,Robert Bezimienny,"[5, 6]","Why did Kubrick choose Tom and Nicole for the leads?  This question is put seriously, and is worthy (I think) of an interesting answer.  This film meditates upon sexual desire, trust, fidelity, power, hypocrisy, and here we find an actor and actress, a husband and wife no less, of outstanding commercial success, but whose previous roles had shown them to be performers of limited depth (to be kind) - why pick them?  Are they, in their mediocrity of emotion, meant to represent Hollywood in general?  Or us, the viewing public, or at least the fragment of our desires which coincides with those portrayed onscreen?  Could Kubrick be laughing at Hollywood for its ineffectual and embarassed take on human sexuality?  He has taken two performers who are out and out 'stars', possibly the archetypal Hollywood couple of the time, and asked them to reveal their depths - they appear, at least to me, to be floundering about in a wading pool.  Tom seems incapable of conveying more than one emotion at a time (and even that one is often unconvincing), and Nicole seems more ready to reveal her body (what there is of it) than her psyche.  Kubrick's opus is phenomenal, so he, of all people, must have been aware of his actors' limitations.  So what was the point?  Is he actually revealing the 'stars' to be very ordinary people, people who have no depths, whose passions are as abstract and empty as the passions which see millions of consumers adulating them as 'stars'? When Tom is asked to witness sex, he wears a mask.  Oddly enough, he seems most confident as a screen persona when so adorned.  A mask is no liability for Tom: it is more effective at conveying emotion than his naked face.  Tom appears embarassed by sex and by emotion - think of the scene with the prostitute, or the fact that drugs are required for 'honest' conversations with Nicole.  And are we, while undoubtedly curious, also perhaps a little embarassed at witnessing Nicole nude, at witnessing Tom in close proximity to orgiastic couples?

118894,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,079074841X,Robert Blake,"[5, 8]","&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was the last visually rich and complex vision given to us by Stanley Kubrick before his death. I have always much preferred Kubrick's films for the look and composition more than the ideas, from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; to &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; it's more the style than story. But here he was actually saying something. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; explores the dark corners of a relationship, principally of marriage. It exposes the worries lovers have when they deal with trust and faithfulness. Kubrick brilliantly paints an effective and disturbing picture here. The character in the beginning who tries to seduce the Nicole Kidman character at a party reeks with evil poison and Kubrick just shows us the idea, he knows we're smart enough to figure it out. The performances are also superb. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are excellent, which is an achievement because as a married couple, this must have been a difficult movie at times because of the feelings and emotions it raises. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a fitting finale for Kubrick. The orgy sequence is brilliant because it is not meant to turn you on, it's creepy, darkly atmospheric and Dantenean. I only wish a better ending had been filmed. It just resolves too quickly and simply with a little naughty word. Still, this is a good movie, dark, but sharp and intelligent and very complex. I was surprised because Kubrick, as I said, is more about style. He usually doesn't present philosophical genius mingled with brilliant visuales like Oliver Stone. But here there is something that speaks into the hearts of relationships. It shows why Kubrick is one of the lasting giants of filmmaking.",4,Atmospheric And Effective.,970876800,"10 7, 2000",2000,1703,"['quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'was', 'last', 'visually', 'rich', 'complex', 'vision', 'given', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'death', 'have', 'always', 'much', 'preferred', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'look', 'composition', 'more', 'ideas', 'quot', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'quot', 'quot', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'quot', 'more', 'style', 'story', 'here', 'was', 'actually', 'saying', 'something', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'dark', 'corners', 'relationship', 'principally', 'marriage', 'worries', 'lovers', 'have', 'when', 'deal', 'trust', 'faithfulness', 'Kubrick', 'brilliantly', 'effective', 'disturbing', 'picture', 'here', 'character', 'beginning', 'who', 'seduce', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'party', 'reeks', 'evil', 'poison', 'Kubrick', 'just', 'idea', ""'re"", 'smart', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'superb', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'are', 'excellent', 'achievement', 'married', 'couple', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'movie', 'times', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'fitting', 'finale', 'Kubrick', 'orgy', 'sequence', 'brilliant', 'not', 'meant', 'turn', 'creepy', 'darkly', 'atmospheric', 'Dantenean', 'only', 'wish', 'better', 'ending', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'just', 'too', 'quickly', 'simply', 'little', 'naughty', 'word', 'Still', 'good', 'movie', 'dark', 'sharp', 'intelligent', 'very', 'complex', 'was', 'surprised', 'because', 'Kubrick', 'said', 'more', 'style', 'usually', ""n't"", 'present', 'philosophical', 'genius', 'mingled', 'brilliant', 'visuales', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'here', 'something', 'hearts', 'relationships', 'why', 'Kubrick', 'one', 'lasting', 'giants', 'filmmaking']",N/A

But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" came to be after all, the last temptation of Kubrick...The film begins revealing the nice figure in high heels of Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), moving in sliding motion her nice black gown... Alice is invited with her husband Dr. William (Tom Cruise) to a holiday party given by a New York wealthy broker called Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack).While Alice is dancing half-drunk with an effusive Hungarian (Ski Dumont), she was, at the same time, spying on her husband who was flirting with two models... A m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois is insinuated by the attractive girls, but a sudden interruption comes from Ziegler's private apartment which made the doctor climb upstairs to assist an attractive woman lying unconscious, repressed, overdosed!The famous mirror love scene, between Alice and her husband, reflected a missing sexual desire between them both... William was kissing his lovely wife on the neck while her glance seemed weary and tired... It seems that the eroticism has vanished from her boring life... Only a little intimate contact is left... Is she truly recognizing a necessity for a change, maybe for a new husband much more nearby...Looking for a certain sexual vengeance, Alice begins irritating her husband about adultery by testing his immunity, and relating some fantasy she had with a handsome naval officer last summer, she assures William that 'if the handsome office had wanted her,' she would have sacrificed everything, even her marriage and her child for one night stand!Feeling his word destroyed into fragments, and walking the dangerous streets of New York, William remembered an old friend he met in the party, the piano player Todd Field (Nick Nightingale). He decides to pass by...There, Nick divulges a secret... A secret place on Long Island... A chteau where he will be playing piano 'eyes shuttered'... But he continued, to get into the castle, one must have a mask, a disguise and he must 'know' the password...With shades of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo,"" Kubrick starts to play, at this point, with his characters... He seems escorting them and leading the audience for some purpose, for one definite performance he prepared his whole picture for it... Kubrick did not create a film about sex... He made a film about the conception of sex... He wanted us to explore something inside our mind that we usually prefer not to discover... Through his eyes a visual work appeared, a cinematic technique breathtakingly beautiful, a perfectionism, precise and mystical...Reducing the dialog to a minimum, and with a distinguished confused music, we were in presence of a strange ceremonial rite, a picturesque ritual...Based on a psychological drama, written by the Viennese novelist Arthur Schnizler, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a mirror, audaciously obsessive in its dazzling revelations, profound, provocative and passionate, transmitted in a frame of sex, fear and death, that we have to see with wide eyes fully opened...",4,A mirror audaciously obsessive in its dazzling revelations...,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,3137,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'tempted', 'do', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', '1970', 'Christianne', 'wife', 'felt', 'marriage', 'could', 'be', 'jeopardy', 'implored', 'not', 'do', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'came', 'be', 'last', 'temptation', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'revealing', 'nice', 'figure', 'high', 'heels', 'Alice', 'Harford', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'moving', 'sliding', 'motion', 'nice', 'black', 'gown', 'Alice', 'invited', 'husband', 'Dr.', 'William', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'holiday', 'party', 'given', 'New', 'York', 'wealthy', 'broker', 'called', 'Victor', 'Ziegler', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', '.While', 'Alice', 'dancing', 'half-drunk', 'effusive', 'Hungarian', 'Ski', 'Dumont', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'spying', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'flirting', 'two', 'models', 'A', 'm', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'trois', 'insinuated', 'attractive', 'girls', 'sudden', 'interruption', 'Ziegler', 'private', 'apartment', 'made', 'doctor', 'climb', 'upstairs', 'assist', 'attractive', 'woman', 'lying', 'unconscious', 'repressed', 'overdosed', 'famous', 'mirror', 'love', 'scene', 'Alice', 'husband', 'reflected', 'missing', 'sexual', 'desire', 'William', 'was', 'kissing', 'lovely', 'wife', 'neck', 'glance', 'seemed', 'weary', 'tired', 'eroticism', 'vanished', 'boring', 'life', 'Only', 'little', 'intimate', 'contact', 'left', 'truly', 'recognizing', 'necessity', 'change', 'maybe', 'new', 'husband', 'much', 'more', 'nearby', 'Looking', 'certain', 'sexual', 'vengeance', 'Alice', 'irritating', 'husband', 'adultery', 'testing', 'immunity', 'relating', 'fantasy', 'had', 'handsome', 'naval', 'officer', 'last', 'summer', 'William', 'handsome', 'office', 'had', 'wanted', 'would', 'have', 'sacrificed', 'everything', 'even', 'marriage', 'child', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Feeling', 'word', 'destroyed', 'fragments', 'walking', 'dangerous', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'William', 'remembered', 'old', 'friend', 'met', 'party', 'piano', 'player', 'Todd', 'Field', 'Nick', 'Nightingale', 'pass', 'Nick', 'secret', 'secret', 'place', 'Long', 'Island', 'A', 'chteau', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'playing', 'piano', ""'eyes"", 'shuttered', 'continued', 'get', 'castle', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'mask', 'disguise', 'must', ""'know"", 'password', 'shades', 'Hitchcock', 'Vertigo', 'Kubrick', 'play', 'point', 'characters', 'escorting', 'leading', 'audience', 'purpose', 'one', 'definite', 'performance', 'prepared', 'whole', 'picture', 'Kubrick', 'did', 'not', 'create', 'film', 'sex', 'made', 'film', 'conception', 'sex', 'wanted', 'explore', 'something', 'mind', 'usually', 'prefer', 'not', 'discover', 'eyes', 'visual', 'work', 'appeared', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'perfectionism', 'precise', 'mystical', 'Reducing', 'dialog', 'minimum', 'distinguished', 'confused', 'music', 'were', 'presence', 'strange', 'ceremonial', 'rite', 'picturesque', 'ritual', 'Based', 'psychological', 'drama', 'written', 'Viennese', 'novelist', 'Arthur', 'Schnizler', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'mirror', 'audaciously', 'obsessive', 'dazzling', 'revelations', 'profound', 'provocative', 'passionate', 'transmitted', 'frame', 'sex', 'fear', 'death', 'have', 'see', 'wide', 'eyes', 'fully', 'opened']",N/A

The finished film as finally released seems a compendium of too much tinkering and no clear vision.  Potent ideas, symbols, images and sequences never come tegether in a satisfying way.  Much more a vanity production and experimental film from a man who enjoyed the process more than the final product.  Maybe it was a way to hold on to his mortality?  Or maybe it's what the movie is really about.  The ultimate taboo is death itself.  And erotic conflict is the stuff of life.The movie is fragmented and sometimese even compelling. But the spell it promises is never realized.  It is mainly interesting as a biographical footnote to a great filmmaker's strange epitaph.  Cruise is intense but out of his element.  Kidman is incredibly present in all her scenes.  She's an amazing talent.But, for me, the real question is why did this story so interest Kubrick?  Perhaps nothing but the opportunity of making another film and the illusion that he would last as long as it's never finished -- even in the minds of an audience!  After all, for an artist, to be creative is to feel fully alive.  Now it's the audiences responsibility to finish the creative process and bring closure to Kubrick's art. But in the final cut,  that only makes for a bad movie.Note: Early WB publicity promised both the American and uncensored European versions of the film as well as commentaries (one by Sydney Pollack).

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Is it heresy or sacrilege to suggest at this late date - and particularly in light of his recent death - that Stanley Kubrick's films have almost  always been better at promising greatness than delivering it? Almost  without exception, Kubrick's carefully crafted works have emerged as  brilliantly clinical &quot;exercises&quot; rather than fully involving  works of timeless art. Audacious, visionary, always willing to push the  envelope and challenge an audience to go where it may not want to - these  are the hallmarks of Kubrick's directorial genius. But, along with these  virtues, comes a heavy list of counterweighing weaknesses that somehow  distance an audience emotionally from what is occurring on the screen:  pretentiousness, laborious pacing, narrative choppiness, often static  camerawork.&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; fits perfectly into this standard  Kubrick mold. Starting with a fascinating premise, Kubrick takes his  audience into unexpected and challenging directions, yet fails to really  cope with the complexities of the theme and make the audience care. Tom  Cruise and Nicole Kidman portray a young, upwardly mobil couple, who live  in New York City with their young daughter. When Kidman, in one of the  year's best scenes, reveals in a wrenching monologue that she has had  serious thoughts of infidelity, Cruise discovers he can't cope with the  visions this admission conjurs up. Thus, he embarks on a sexual odyssey  through the streets of the city which leads him into many bizarre and  unexpected avenues of depravity including a club made up of the idle rich  dressed in costumes and masks who stage orgies replete with secret  passwords and portentous organ music.The problem lies essentially with  the Kubrick/Frederick Rafael screenplay which can't seem to connect these  scenes of flamboyant nastiness with the theme that is at the film's core.  Cruise drifts into each of his adventures out of an understandable urge to  experience this world of sexual perversity, but he seems to end up as a  passive observer each time, with little or no revelation registered. This  concept - of examining the effect that even implied infidelity can have on  relationship - is such a rich one that it becomes a shame to see it buried  under these scenes of often extraneous ostentation. Kubrick seems so  enamored of his little &quot;visions&quot; that they begin to dominate the  proceedings and bury the theme and the characters. This weakness is  reflected in the film's far too tidy resolution, which is thoroughly  unconvincing from a psychological viewpoint and makes one wonder how  Kubrick could linger so long over scenes with no purpose beyond the  sensational yet take so little time with the one that truly matters.Cruise and Kidman both turn in fine performances, but Sydney Pollack, as  a wealthy friend who later in the film sets Cruise straight, hams it up  shamelessly. The music is hauntingly effective and helps immeasureably to  establish and sustain an atmosphere of portentous weirdness.The title  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; will not describe most people in the audience -  Kubrick is too skilled at creating an always riveting visual motif for that  - but, for me, it will serve as a lasting testament less to his genius than  to his maddening inability to fulfill his always great promise.",3,intriguing but unsatisfying,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,3340,"['heresy', 'sacrilege', 'suggest', 'late', 'date', 'particularly', 'light', 'recent', 'death', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'have', 'almost', 'always', 'been', 'better', 'promising', 'greatness', 'delivering', 'Almost', 'exception', 'Kubrick', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'works', 'have', 'emerged', 'brilliantly', 'clinical', 'quot', 'quot', 'rather', 'fully', 'involving', 'works', 'timeless', 'art', 'Audacious', 'visionary', 'always', 'willing', 'push', 'envelope', 'challenge', 'audience', 'go', 'where', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'are', 'hallmarks', 'Kubrick', 'directorial', 'genius', 'virtues', 'heavy', 'list', 'counterweighing', 'weaknesses', 'somehow', 'distance', 'audience', 'emotionally', 'what', 'occurring', 'screen', 'pretentiousness', 'laborious', 'pacing', 'narrative', 'choppiness', 'often', 'static', 'camerawork.', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'standard', 'Kubrick', 'mold', 'Starting', 'fascinating', 'premise', 'Kubrick', 'audience', 'unexpected', 'challenging', 'directions', 'yet', 'really', 'cope', 'complexities', 'theme', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'young', 'upwardly', 'mobil', 'couple', 'who', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'young', 'daughter', 'When', 'Kidman', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'scenes', 'reveals', 'wrenching', 'monologue', 'had', 'serious', 'thoughts', 'infidelity', 'Cruise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'visions', 'admission', 'up', 'Thus', 'sexual', 'odyssey', 'streets', 'city', 'many', 'bizarre', 'unexpected', 'avenues', 'depravity', 'including', 'club', 'made', 'idle', 'rich', 'dressed', 'costumes', 'masks', 'who', 'stage', 'orgies', 'replete', 'secret', 'passwords', 'portentous', 'organ', 'music.The', 'problem', 'essentially', 'Kubrick/Frederick', 'Rafael', 'screenplay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'connect', 'scenes', 'flamboyant', 'nastiness', 'theme', 'film', 'core', 'Cruise', 'drifts', 'adventures', 'understandable', 'urge', 'experience', 'world', 'sexual', 'perversity', 'end', 'up', 'passive', 'time', 'little', 'revelation', 'registered', 'concept', 'examining', 'effect', 'even', 'implied', 'infidelity', 'can', 'have', 'relationship', 'such', 'rich', 'one', 'shame', 'see', 'buried', 'scenes', 'often', 'extraneous', 'ostentation', 'Kubrick', 'so', 'enamored', 'little', 'quot', 'visions', 'quot', 'begin', 'dominate', 'proceedings', 'bury', 'theme', 'characters', 'weakness', 'reflected', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'tidy', 'resolution', 'thoroughly', 'unconvincing', 'psychological', 'viewpoint', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'Kubrick', 'could', 'linger', 'so', 'long', 'scenes', 'purpose', 'sensational', 'yet', 'take', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'one', 'matters.Cruise', 'Kidman', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'wealthy', 'friend', 'who', 'later', 'film', 'sets', 'Cruise', 'straight', 'hams', 'up', 'shamelessly', 'music', 'hauntingly', 'effective', 'immeasureably', 'establish', 'sustain', 'atmosphere', 'portentous', 'weirdness.The', 'title', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'most', 'people', 'audience', 'Kubrick', 'too', 'skilled', 'creating', 'always', 'riveting', 'visual', 'motif', 'will', 'serve', 'lasting', 'testament', 'less', 'genius', 'maddening', 'inability', 'fulfill', 'always', 'great', 'promise']",N/A

Im not even sure why I'm writing this  because i doubt if it will even be read, there being almost 400 posts about  the film.  The only thing that pissed me off about the film was the way  they hyped it.  I remember seeing Entertainment Tonight, and all of those  other hollow shows and seeing how they hyped it.  They called it &quot;tom  and nicole's intimate new film&quot; and i dont even remember seeing a  mention of stanley kubrick in all the hype.  I guess they were trying to  sell it to all those national enquirer readers who were just hoping to see  the couple naked.  And when the movie wasnt actually just a shallow  revealment of the two, plenty of people got disapointed.  but one thing i  agree on with just about everyone else is that nicole is a pretty bad  actress. i think kubrick had to just throw in those nude shots of her to  make up for her lack of skill.  I've always been a hater of her work, i  can't remember any role that she played that wasnt almost laughable.  I  remember one line of her's in days of thunder when she had to say &quot;let  me out of the car&quot; in a british accent, what actually came out was  &quot;let me out of the carww..&quot; (the bristish kind of drop the R and  replace it with a W when they say car, but she used both, good watch it for  yourself).

Stanley Kubrick, in his final turn as director, takes us on a journey so fascinating that it is difficult to recognize is as our own mundane world. To see life through Kubrick's eyes must have been a thing of wonder. In true Kubrick form, he presents a film, in this case a thrilling drama, filled with such quirky, hysterical characters that we laugh at moments that should not warrant laughter. It is hilarious when the father of a young teenage girl catches her half naked with Dr. Harford and subsequently threatens to kill him. Such was Kubrick's sardonic sense of humor. He also knew how to instill a sense of dread and he uses that to full effect in this film. While we tag along with Dr. Harford (Tom Cruise) as he plunges into his odyssey through the night, we get the feeling that we are more worried than he is about his predicaments. You will be on the edge of your seat until the very end and some scenes will have you cringing or peeking through your fingers at the screen. An emphatic piano score adds to the effectiveness and mounting tension. Perhaps most of all, it is the sign of a great director that he can employ a celebrity such as Tom Cruise and make you think more about the director than the actor.

Men, don't mess with your marriage, you may not like what is out there!Tom Cruise plays a successful doctor that asks questions of his wife, that he should not neccessarily want the answers, and then, after a marital argument, he ventures into the seamy ( I mean VERY SEAMY) side of after hours, New York, sampling the possible fruits of what can be had. It's scary and poses an eventual threat, not only to his marriage, but also to his and his wife's actual life.When I first saw this is the theater, I was disappointed. The utilization of such A-list stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, detracted from the microscopic, extremely personal and psychological story of a successful couple that appears to have it all yet there, nonetheless, exists a fragility that may instantly implode their perfect world. They were too big of stars however, the late Sidney Pollack is mesmerizing as Cruise's doctor cohort during the day, but a very scary, villain at night. His role was positively chilling.This is a challenging film that is not easy to digest. However, repeated viewings (even catching bits and pieces as it plays on cable) reveals an artistic masterpiece that is sterotype Kubrick.Most reviews go into too deep of an analysis of this movie as though the flick is extraordinarily complicated. That's a misgiving. I learned to understand and appreciate this film when I viewed it as a simple warning of not to take a marriage for granted.Stanley Kubrick is among the greatest of directors preciseley for the reason why this movie has a delayed appreciation component.

This is a study in a particular feature of the American psyche -- denial. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" -- the title encapsulates the theme. As revealed in the final line of dialog from Kidman, these two charcters have chosen to learn nothing from their harrowing experiences and prefer their yuppie light-drug haze attitude. If the neg-utopic theme of Tom Wolf's ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" was ""insulate, insulate, insulate"" -- meaning that the upper class people should insulate themselves from all contact with the rough-and-tumble world beneath their penthouse ballestrades; then the theme for these upper class New York characters must be ""drift, dream, deny"".As always, Kubric exerts complete control over every frame -- a stiffer form of film making than many are used to -- and in Kubric's hands he uses it again to dissect the sterility of moderns. The sick, dwarfed, pathetically trimmed, and pastel-lighted Christmas Trees that appear in many of the interiors. The whats-going-on-here? out-of-the-corner-of-your-eye setup at the costume rental shop.

Even if others tell you that the director goes berserk with some scenes (and one could say he does, for e.g., a vivid masked orgy in a posh mansion with Gregorian chants in the background), and even if you are otherwise accustomed to the cut-crazy NYPD Blue type of rush modern cinematography, which is diametrically opposed to the ethereally unfolding cinema of Kubrick, there is something very deeply moving about the nuances of this movie's identifiable characters on the verge of marital collapse.The film is actually inspired by the 1926 novel ""Traumnovelle"" by Arthur Schnitzler, which was based in the decadent Vienna of the 1920's (sidenote: highly recommended book, now sold under the label of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" right here on Amazon). Of course Kubrick's version is based instead in modern Manhattan and studies the life of a well-to-do couple (Kidman, Cruise).The story unfolds with all the smooth pizzazz of almost any Kubrick venture, effortlessly going from domestic discord to sexual obsession to murder mystery. Cruise, playing a doctor with all the right connections and a very good lifestyle, is convinced that his wife is deeply loyal to him. Until one day she confesses how she had once contemplated having an affair with a naval officer whom she had only glimpsed across a hotel lobby. This confession comes after an upscale party where they both found themselves in the hands of lustful but unsuccessful seducers. The roots of his faith shaken, Cruise examines his own lusts. After an unconsummated dalliance with a Greenwich Village prostitute, he eventually finds himself in an ominous mansion where wealthy masked participants indulge in dark ritual orgies, and perhaps even murder. But in a world where faithfulness is revealed to be little more than an illusion, can evil be any more substantive?There is really very little that can be said about the movie's weaknesses. Perhaps the orgy ritual may come across to some as a little baffling but I believe it very stunningly symbolizes our inherent instincts for philandaring. That the unrueful participants should feel necessary to don masks and hide their identity while doing their deeds only underscores their haplessness in the face of their desires.The movie will keep you on your toes, and just when you think you have figured it out you will be presented with something uncanny.

Nearly every movie he's made takes sex, rape and extreme violence to the very limit of what the human mind can stomach. And although films such as Full metal Jacket and a Clockwork Orange show us this, at least they were half decent movies. This however, is just one giant orgy...literally!There is this one scene for instance, which I still find myself watching over and over to try and understand what made Kubrick think this up. It's the scene where a young woman is completely naked wearing high-heels and laying/hanging off a sofa in an upstairs room of a party. She taken too much drugs and overdosed, and so a doctor is called out. Ok, so it's not the rape scene from A Clockwork Orange, yet it's frightfully disturbing to view.Sometimes I find myself thinking...this is art. It's Stanley's way and style, let him experiment with ultra-graphic nudity and sex...he's one of the few directors who isn't (wasn't) afraid of showing the viewer things maybe we would never openly discuss or even think about in our normal lives. Yet the other half of me think...what a sicko!Ultimatley, not a patch on A Clockwork Orange, which is much more extreme then this is. Full Metal Jacket still his greatest movie.

Ranks right up there with Barry Lyndon.However, I have always found this film to be the most accessible, honest, emotional, and humanly raw films Kubrick ever did.  If you are married or in a serious relationship, its themes resonate throughout one's being.  Like Othello who is consumed by jealousy, so is Tom Cruise's character, Dr. Harford, who throughout the film struggles with his wife's admission that she had urges for an illicit affair. Is her admission infidelity?  Does the mere thought or desire to be with someone else become immoral?  This is a film that is much greater than its parts and is too easily dismissed.As for the transfer itself, I have read many complaints that it is not very good.  However, I do remember seeing the film in its theatrical run and find this Blu-Ray release to be incredibly accurate.  Therefore, Warners should not be faulted for providing a very accurate presentation of this film on HD.  True, it is not a demonstration disc, but it is not a flawed or insulting transfer either.The good news is that we Americans are finally, FINALLY, permitted to see the ""unrated"" version that, in the end, turns out to be not that big of a deal.  The scene in question, that required CGI hooded figures to be strategically placed, is so un-erotic and an ""Is That It??!!"" moment, that one really wonders what is going on over at the ratings board.If there is a downside to the release, and this applies to almost ALL of the Kubrick hi-def releases, is the amateurish, sloppy documentaries that accompany each disc.  The production values of these mini-documentaries are, to be blunt, an insult to the films that they discuss.

But because of numerous dreamlike and fantasylike scenes the movie ends up being surreal.  We see both characters straying outside the bonds of marital fidelity, Alice mostly in her elaborate dreams and fantasies though there is a temptation in the ball at the film's beginning which Alice does not succumb to; Dr.Bill in his wanderings about New York City on the several nights following the ball, during which he encounters hookers and patients, among others, who are highly receptive to his advances. The owner of the costume shop also has a young teenage daughter whom, if I am not mistaken,he offers to Dr. Bill. There are numerous direct references to the use of drugs (Dr. Bill and Alice smoke pot), one of the hookers turns out to be HIV-positive, and one of the participants at the orgy dies later that night of a drug overdose.  The most celebrated scene is the masked ball or orgy which forms the heart of the film, at which numerous prominent (?) people gather to indulge their sexual fantasies.  Dr. Bill is an unwelcome outsider but gains admittance through his long-term friendship with the piano player who performs blindfolded at the orgy. This is a secret society and the piano player is removed from New York to Seattle with the assistance of two thugs because he has seen too much, and Dr Bill  is also threatened.All of these scenes occur after Dr. Bill and Alice have a heated discussion about marital fidelity following the Christmas ball.  Dr. Bill states rather cavalierly that all of his relationships with his female patients are professional, and Alice replies somewhat maliciously that she cannot believe he never considers having an extramarital affair.  Why, indeed, she herself had an elaborate fantasy about having a one night stand with a naval officer she noticed during a visit to Cape Cod. The language, though not necessarily the film, is pretty crude throughout and is not suitable for children, unless you are an extremely liberated parent.

This would be Kubrick's final movie completed before and released after his death in 1999.Eyes Wide Shut follows an upper class New York couple called the Harfords, played by then real life couple Cruise and Kidman. One night following some pot smoking, Alice Harford opens up and tells her husband about a near sex affair she once had with a naval officer. Even though Bill Harford had insisted that he never would feel jealous for her because of the trust she had earned in him, the thought and image of his wife having sex with another man boggles his mind. Over the course of the night, we accompany Bill on his trip of madness in the sensual underground world of New York. He meets his old med school dropout turned pianist buddy at a party early on the film who tells him about a mysterious orgy party that Bill eventually sneaks into wearing a cape and mask.

This is terrible acting from two of the greatest stars, and it's definetely not their fault. Although Stanley  Kubrick may have been a very close friend to Tom and Nicole, seeing as how  they spent as much time as they did during the production of the film, he  came really close to butchering their careers. This movie is pointless and  insignificant. Sure, we all have impure thoughts and some of the strangest  fantasies, but who would honestly tell their husband or wife, &quot;Hey,  honey, I saw this really great looking woman/man today in the supermarket  and I couldn't stop thinking about hopping in the sack with him/her. I hope  you're not mad&quot;? I can understand the part about Tom Cruise's  character visualizing his wife with this other man, his thoughts driving  him insanely jealous and creating a perplexing paranoia. I would probably  let my thoughts drive me mad too if my husband told me that he thought  about sleeping with someone else. Other than understanding this part, I  could barely watch the rest of the film. It moved so slowly that I thought  everyone in the film had a shot of Novacaine before they even turned the  camera on. Maybe that's why it took more than two years to make this movie;  everyone was drugged. But the machinations of strange ballroom orgies and  the psychological dive into the sexual minds of human beings was nothing  short of shallow. It was a skin flick with big actors and a big director to  sell tickets. I could've gotten better acting and more action out of an  actual porno. Sorry, but I don't buy it that Stanley Kubrick is just a very  deep, very misunderstood individual. Films like these are a way for sick  individuals to indulge their vile fantasies by putting it on film and  marketing it as &quot;artistic expression&quot;.

118928,A2PN62S0L13TD,079074841X,"Stephen Norquist ""S. Norquist""","[5, 7]","I believe I understand Eyes Wide Shut now. It teaches a lesson that is so hard to learn. The lesson of simplicity. Just as the catholic priest's outfit teaches truth to be a small and simple white patch lost in confusion, darkness and compexity, this movie teaches that the sexual union is a very simple and wonderful truth created to bond two people together in love. When this simple and powerful act is complicated and divorced from its proper context, it creates a self perpetuating elaboration. When the simple act of sexual union which is designed to lead us toward each other and to the love that waits for us in each other is directed outward, then that person begins an ever outward journey on a road that never ends. Each step of the road becomes more and more elaborate in its attempt to find the true treasure which is never found ""out there."" The metaphor of over the rainbow used in the movie to symbolize the false search was apt. The lesson Tom and Nicole learned was that the moment they looked away from love and allowed their sexual energy to look outside that love, they began to walk the path of despair. Each of their fantasies became more and more elaborate, her's in her mind and his in a brush with the masters of elaboration. The big house with all the satanic sexual ritual was close to the end game of complexity, yet these people which got off the track long ago were no closer to finding the Grail. Satisfaction can never be found ""out there"". At the end of the movie Nicole tells Tom that it is important that they go home and F--K. This statement is important because it tells us and clarifies for them the roads they had begun to walk. They had forgot the simplicity of love and how the sexual journey is always toward each other. They had each withheld their sexual energy and waited for an opportunity to release it along those dark roads of elaboration. Tom had many tries at finding false union out there but clearly a higher power protected him from certain disaster but also taught him an important lesson. They had to F--K, not make love, because that act was necessary to release all the false sexual energy they had built up on their false quest. Unless they released it and allowed it to burn off they could never return to Love. Love is very delicate and will diminish or die in the presence of false sexual energy. Love is simple, and sex is the simple journey toward each other and toward the love that we give each other. The moment it becomes more than that, or other than that, then like the Illuminati we chase our tails forever, ever building greater and greater elaboration and lies to hide the knowledge that we have forgotten the truth. Just as Dorothy from the Wizard of OZ learned that she already had what was best, so Tom and Nicole also had to endure the tornado and meet the wizard to understand they always had the ruby slippers and the power to return home.",3,"Good, but could have been great if Kubrick lived edit it.",1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,2919,"['believe', 'understand', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'now', 'lesson', 'so', 'hard', 'learn', 'lesson', 'simplicity', 'Just', 'catholic', 'priest', 'outfit', 'teaches', 'truth', 'be', 'small', 'simple', 'white', 'patch', 'lost', 'confusion', 'darkness', 'compexity', 'movie', 'sexual', 'union', 'very', 'simple', 'wonderful', 'truth', 'created', 'bond', 'two', 'people', 'together', 'love', 'When', 'simple', 'powerful', 'act', 'complicated', 'divorced', 'proper', 'context', 'self', 'perpetuating', 'elaboration', 'When', 'simple', 'act', 'sexual', 'union', 'designed', 'lead', 'other', 'love', 'other', 'directed', 'outward', 'then', 'person', 'ever', 'outward', 'journey', 'road', 'never', 'step', 'road', 'more', 'more', 'elaborate', 'attempt', 'find', 'true', 'treasure', 'never', 'found', 'there', 'metaphor', 'rainbow', 'used', 'movie', 'symbolize', 'false', 'search', 'was', 'apt', 'lesson', 'Tom', 'Nicole', 'learned', 'was', 'moment', 'looked', 'away', 'love', 'allowed', 'sexual', 'energy', 'look', 'love', 'began', 'walk', 'path', 'despair', 'fantasies', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'elaborate', 'mind', 'brush', 'masters', 'elaboration', 'big', 'house', 'satanic', 'sexual', 'ritual', 'was', 'close', 'end', 'game', 'complexity', 'yet', 'people', 'got', 'track', 'long', 'ago', 'were', 'closer', 'finding', 'Grail', 'Satisfaction', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'found', 'there', 'end', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'Tom', 'important', 'go', 'home', 'F', 'K.', 'statement', 'important', 'clarifies', 'roads', 'had', 'begun', 'walk', 'had', 'forgot', 'simplicity', 'love', 'how', 'sexual', 'journey', 'always', 'other', 'had', 'withheld', 'sexual', 'energy', 'waited', 'opportunity', 'release', 'dark', 'roads', 'elaboration', 'Tom', 'had', 'many', 'tries', 'finding', 'false', 'union', 'there', 'clearly', 'higher', 'power', 'protected', 'certain', 'disaster', 'also', 'taught', 'important', 'lesson', 'had', 'F', 'K', 'not', 'make', 'love', 'act', 'was', 'necessary', 'release', 'false', 'sexual', 'energy', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'false', 'quest', 'released', 'allowed', 'burn', 'off', 'could', 'never', 'return', 'Love', 'Love', 'very', 'delicate', 'will', 'diminish', 'die', 'presence', 'false', 'sexual', 'energy', 'Love', 'simple', 'sex', 'simple', 'journey', 'other', 'love', 'give', 'other', 'moment', 'more', 'other', 'then', 'Illuminati', 'chase', 'tails', 'forever', 'ever', 'building', 'greater', 'greater', 'elaboration', 'hide', 'knowledge', 'have', 'forgotten', 'truth', 'Just', 'Dorothy', 'Wizard', 'OZ', 'learned', 'already', 'had', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'so', 'Tom', 'Nicole', 'also', 'had', 'endure', 'tornado', 'meet', 'wizard', 'understand', 'always', 'had', 'ruby', 'slippers', 'power', 'return', 'home']",N/A
118929,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,079074841X,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[2, 2]","Stanley Kubrick is my patron saint. In my mind, he is one of, if not the greatest, filmmaker of all time. My first Kubrick experience occured when I was in high school. I was over at a friend's house, and the film that he was watching was THE SHINING. I had never seen anything like it in my life. Not only was it scary as hell - it was - but the sheer inventiveness of the film making stunned me. I started noticing the tracking shots. Most of the film is a series of long tracking shots and zooms. They were all beautifully executed and framed. The lighting also struck me. It was different than what I had been used to, and I liked it. The beauty of this film was in the simplicity of how it was put together. There was simply no need for the MTV-style editing that had become so popular with the ""cut, cut, cut, cut"" mentality of the time, which was quite pervasive, and was growing tiresome. Kubrick would simply set up the shot, and let the actors act. There were no distractions, and the story simply told itself. I was hooked, and it instantly became one of my favorite films. I've probably seen it more than fifty times.Later on, I discovered A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and FULL METAL JACKET. Both of these films resembled THE SHINING in their meticulous attention to detail, and not only that, but the films were rich, not exclusively in a technical sense, but on an intellectual level as well. The best thing about watching a Kubrick film is the thought process that you go through afterwards, when you reflect on what you have just seen. You get to peel back all of the intricate layers, and sometimes you don't even realize what you have just seen until the fifth or sixth viewing...which moves me on to Kubrick's final film, EYES WIDE SHUT.Principal photography for this film lasted for 400 days, and it was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""longest constant movie shoot"". Obviously with this film, as with every other film that Kubrick made, time was no obstacle. Only someone with Stanley's track record could have pulled that off. Furthermore, if he was anything at all, he was a perfectionist. He pushed his crew and his actors, pushed them so that he could get the best that they had to offer. If the performances of some of his actors seem overplayed, it's only because ""naturalistic"" acting never appealed much to Kubrick, as he would always say, ""Natural is good, interesting is better."" The ""interesting"" aspect would come after fifty or sixty takes of the same scene. He would bring his actors to the point where they literally had nothing else to give, and then that was oftentimes the take that he would use. Filming on EYES WIDE SHUT played out like this, and thank the heavens that it did, because the final product was nothing short of another masterpiece.The thing that separates EYES WIDE SHUT apart from the rest of Kubrick's filmography could be summed up in one word: hope. Yes, you read that correctly! EYES WIDE SHUT is a very hopeful film! Kubrick was often accused of seeing the dark side of human nature. This would be correct. His films are extremely pessimistic, in that they hone in on the dark side of human nature. Humans are portrayed as weak, ignorant, stupid, and beyond redemption. Most of the time, he was just being honest, and that was hard for many to stomach. But here, in his last film, he embraces themes of passion, commitment, loyalty, and even love. The whole film is a cautionary tale about the dangers of marriage, the temptation of adultery, and how important it is to hold tight to your spouse, taking nothing for granted. After all, we are human. Any one of us can be tempted at any given time. No one is exempt from that. Kubrick understood this. He also understood that divorce rates were through the roof, and that close friends of his had cheated on their spouses. All he had to do was turn on the television to see the latest celebrity scandal or divorce drama. These were situations that were very timely, very relevant to 1999, and even more so, today. Stanley Kubrick understood and respected the institution of marriage, and was, as far as anyone knows, faithful to his wife until the end. Somewhere along the line, however, he felt compelled to make this film, particularly after reading ""Traumnovelle"", a 1926 novella by Arthur Schnitzler.What we have here is the story of Dr. Bill and Alice Hartford, a upper class, married couple with a young daughter. When the film opens, they are getting dressed and prepared for a prestigious Christmas party that they have been invited to by one of Bill's patients. Alice gets up from the toilet, adjusts her hair, and asks Bill a simple question, ""How do I look?"", to which Bill replies ""It's great"". He's not paying her any attention, as he adjusts his tie in the mirror. ""You're not even looking at it,"" she says. Bill turns around, and robotically tells her, ""you're beautiful. You always look beautiful"". It is here, during the very opening moments of the film, that we are able to see Dr. Bill's major flaw: he doesn't really appreciate his wife. They've been married for years, and, apparently, the act of complimenting his wife has now become routine. On to the party. Once Bill and Alice reach the party, their host comes over to greet them, and we then dissolve to Bill and Alice lovingly dancing together, musing and asking themselves why they were even invited to this overblown party in the first place. Bill sees an old friend of his, and takes off. In the meantime, Alice grabs a glass of champagne and waits by the bar. Out of nowhere, a strange Hungarian man comes over and starts to flirt. It's obvious what he wants from the start. He attempts to wear her down in her drunken state. ""Don't you think one of the charms of marriage is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?"", he asks Alice. He has her cornered, and eventually, after several of his advances, she reminds him that she is married and walks away. Meanwhile, in another part of the house, Bill walks down the hall with two models hanging on each arm. Their game of seduction begins. ""Don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?"", they both ask. Bill isn't quite sure what they are asking, but he catches the hint. At that moment, he gets summoned by someone else, and he leaves the two temptresses to themselves.So, Bill and Alice have both remained faithful, and resisted temptation, for now. Later on that night, and with the help of a joint, Alice starts questioning Bill about the two women that he was with. He tells her that it was nothing, that they were just two dumb models. She also takes it upon herself to tell him of the Hungarian man that tried to seduce her. Bill tells her that it's only natural for men to feel that way. She's beautiful, after all. There's not much jealousy in his response. This sets Alice off, and she goes into a tirade. Bill, in his ignorance, also makes the statement that women don't think the way that men do, as far as sexual matters. She stops him dead in his tracks, and tells him that when they were vacationing the year before, she made eye contact with a young naval officer. She goes on to say that it was only a glance, but that she would have been willing to give up her family and her life for one night with him. She came to her senses, but the fact remains that the thought of infidelity was on her mind, and she could have acted on it.From here on, Bill becomes insanely jealous. He realizes that his wife isn't just a prop. She is capable of hurting him, and he sets out to prove that he is just as capable as she is. He goes out on the town, and his journey into the sexual underworld begins. He is faced with temptation the entire night, but every time he is close to giving in, he is interrupted. One interruption happens to come in the form of a phone call from his wife. However, he proceeds and is determined to explore, almost hoping that an opportunity to be unfaithful will present itself. Before the night is over, he ends up at a masked, pagan orgy filled with powerful members of society. Here, he sees just how sick and depraved the idea of infidelity is. It's so fitting that the password to get into the house is ""fidelio"" - ""faithful"". It is exactly the opposite. This scene, probably one of the most controversial scenes in film history, is not sexually enticing at all. It's ugly and horrific. It's a picture of hell on earth. It represents the evil that is adultery and sexual debauchery. The scene plays like something out of ""Rosemary's Baby"".The core of the film is in the last few moments, where Bill confesses to Alice of his night time journey. His eyes are filled with tears. ""I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you everything!"", he tells her.The last scene takes place in a shopping mall. Bill and Alice's daughter runs around looking at dolls, while they talk amongst themselves about recent events. ""The fact is that we are both awake now,"" Alice says, ""and I do love you."" She then suggests that they go home as soon as possible to have sex. This scene is powerful and brutally raw in it's honesty. In Kubrick's only love story, he has taught us the importance of the covenant of marriage, and how it is important to treasure your husband or your wife.  There is such a thing as healthy jealousy, and both Bill and Alice have learned this valuable lesson by the film's conclusion. They will strive to keep each other away from the darkness, to appreciate one another, taking nothing for granted.The controversy that surrounded this film was predictable. The orgy scene is twenty minutes of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is brutally honest in it's raw portrayal of sexual debauchery. However, I feel that, as repulsive as this scene is, it is a necessary evil which is needed to convey the depravity that we live amongst. Sexual immorality is not pretty. It should not be presented as such on film. Kubrick was never a prude when it came to pulling us out of our comfort zones. He was always honest, no matter how much it hurt or how ugly we thought it was. If you look closely at each one of his films, they all have a moral center. He was not pleased with the way that he saw the world, and like us, he wanted things to change.""In a modern world that is rife with infidelity, lies, hedonism and sexual decadence Stanley is encouraging us all to throw away our masks and take a good look in the mirror. His final and most underestimated masterpiece is a call for an end to all forms of secrecy, be they personal, social or political."" - Rob Ager, from his essay, ""Unseen Reflections""Tragically, Stanley Kubrick died two weeks after the release of EYES WIDE SHUT. He was quite pleased with the final product. Like all of Kubrick's films, it opened to mixed response from the critics. Over time, this film has aged like a fine wine. That's the thing about his films. They get better with age, and as Steven Spielberg said in an interview, ""They tend to grow on you."" I have personally found this to be true. Every time you watch one, you learn something new, or you see something that you had never noticed before, and who knows, you may learn something about yourself.It is in this way that Stanley Kubrick left a legacy. He will never be forgotten and his films will live on, decade after decade, and will remain classics. Funny that he has a classic in just about every genre of film that there is.How many directors can pull that off?",5,Stanley Kubrick and EYES WIDE SHUT,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,11439,"['Stanley',

Well I disagree, I would not class my self as being a &quot;Kubrickite&quot; having only seen  a couple of his films including the Shining and Clockwork Orange (not even  liking the latter) yet still found this a thoughtful, intelligent film.I think it is a film most people can relate to in someway.  Okay, I admit  it is a bit strange and every five minutes you will be asking yourself  &quot;what ... is going on?&quot;.  It's even a bit scary in places  and has the most haunting theme tune since halloween. You probably will not  even decide whether you liked it or not until a few hours after it has  finished because it is one of those films which leaves you thinking.  But I  definately reccommend it; besides, even if you don't like the story there's  always Kidman &amp; Cruise in their birthday suits(amongst plenty of other  nudity) to keep both sexes attention.

118935,A5TZXWU8AALIC,079074841X,The JuRK,"[2, 2]","Through Stanley Kubrick's camera lens, the universe is a cold and frequently sinister place.The man-made world of DR. STRANGELOVE marches to its wacky Armaggeddon even as its silly characters struggle valiantly to save it.  The technology that got us into the outer space of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY betrays us and leaves us as nothing more than a well-fed, well-dressed specimen to the powers we find beyond our solar system.  The government of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is so bent on behavioral modification that it makes a hero of a rapist thug like Alex the Droog.  The mask covering our historical and psychological sins is ripped away and leaves us as absorbed ghosts in the Overlook Hotel in THE SHINING.  And the military of FULL METAL JACKET chews up our young men and spits them out as psycho-killers razing someone else's countryside.So at the end of his life, Kubrick makes a love story.  Talk about confounding everyone on the planet, including his fans.Kubrick died just after finishing the cut that was released to theatres and much speculation has been placed on what he would've done before anyone saw it.  There were enough wild rumors during production.  Even now, I read a story that Kubrick was disappointed with the Hollywood power couple of Cruise and Kidman.  (Although he's a very earnest actor, Cruise seems to struggle with depth, but I thought Kidman was a good choice...although she plays getting high on marijuana too silly and ridiculous--has she ever been high?).But something worked for me with EYES WIDE SHUT.And there's something new here that's never been seen in a Stanley Kubrick film before: optimism.  Even as Cruise's love for his wife is assaulted by the haunting images of her making love to the officer in uniform, even as he recklessly follows paths to violate his vows and his faithfulness...something always stops him.  He doesn't ravage the hooker, he doesn't indulge in the bizarre private orgy, etc.Something always brings him home, safe and sound.  Something you never saw in the Kubrick film before.(When will they release a version without the computer-generated orgy attendees blocking our view?)",4,A Stanley Kubrick Love Story,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,2140,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'camera', 'universe', 'cold', 'frequently', 'sinister', 'place.The', 'man-made', 'world', 'DR.', 'STRANGELOVE', 'wacky', 'Armaggeddon', 'even', 'silly', 'characters', 'struggle', 'valiantly', 'save', 'technology', 'got', 'outer', 'space', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'nothing', 'more', 'well-fed', 'well-dressed', 'specimen', 'powers', 'find', 'solar', 'system', 'government', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'so', 'bent', 'behavioral', 'modification', 'hero', 'rapist', 'thug', 'Alex', 'Droog', 'mask', 'covering', 'historical', 'psychological', 'sins', 'ripped', 'away', 'absorbed', 'ghosts', 'Overlook', 'Hotel', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'military', 'FULL', 'METAL', 'JACKET', 'up', 'young', 'men', 'spits', 'out', 'psycho-killers', 'razing', 'someone', 'else', 'countryside.So', 'end', 'life', 'Kubrick', 'love', 'story', 'Talk', 'confounding', 'everyone', 'planet', 'including', 'fans.Kubrick', 'died', 'just', 'finishing', 'cut', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'much', 'speculation', 'been', 'placed', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'anyone', 'saw', 'were', 'enough', 'wild', 'rumors', 'production', 'Even', 'now', 'read', 'story', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Hollywood', 'power', 'couple', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'very', 'earnest', 'actor', 'Cruise', 'struggle', 'depth', 'thought', 'Kidman', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'getting', 'high', 'marijuana', 'too', 'silly', 'ridiculous', 'ever', 'been', 'high', '.But', 'something', 'worked', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT.And', 'something', 'new', 'here', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'optimism', 'Even', 'Cruise', 'love', 'wife', 'assaulted', 'haunting', 'images', 'making', 'love', 'officer', 'uniform', 'even', 'recklessly', 'paths', 'violate', 'vows', 'faithfulness', 'something', 'always', ""n't"", 'ravage', 'hooker', ""n't"", 'indulge', 'bizarre', 'private', 'orgy', 'etc.Something', 'always', 'home', 'safe', 'sound', 'Something', 'never', 'saw', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'before', 'When', 'will', 'release', 'version', 'computer-generated', 'orgy', 'attendees', 'blocking', 'view']",N/A

It was released to such mixed reviews that I was slightly hesitant to see it (although I knew I would eventually because I admire Kubrick so much). However, once I had seen it,  I had immediately dismissed the negative reviews as nonsense. I honestly,  truly, don't see how you can't find something beautiful in this movie.  There are so many great things in it.First, the thing that strikes you  immediately is the direction and visual style. From Kubrick we should  expect nothing less than perfection - and we get it with Eyes Wide Shut.  This is, hands down, one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The  use of color and direction is spellbinding in it's power and  intensity.The story itself is mesmerizing. The whole movie drifts by in  a sort of dream-like state, and the events sort of flow together so that  after seeing it you'd be hard-pressed to recall the exact &quot;plot.&quot;  JUST LIKE A DREAM. This movie is based on a story called Traumnovelle,  which means dream story. There is a plot, but it drifts into tangents and  pieces which are finally tied back together at the end.The performances  are really quite good. Tom Cruise is very good as the lost Dr. Bill. Nicole  Kidman is equally good or even better as his wife Alice. Her role is small,  but every scene she is in she commands.Lastly, I thought I'd remark on  the &quot;score.&quot; It basically consists of a simple, but truly eerie,  piano melody which is constantly repeated, over and over, throughout most  of the film. It always seems to come at the perfect moments, and I thought  complemented the film very well.Eyes Wide Shut is a true masterpiece. It  is easily one of 1999's best movies, if not the best. The imagery is  stirring and provocative, and you will want to watch the film again and  again. One of the most haunting, amazing, and powerful movies I have ever  seen.R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick.

While perusing the racks, Milich, the owner, discovered his young daughter having a three-way with two middle-aged Asian men. When Milich violently confronted the Asian men and said,""Couldn't you see she's a child?"" They informed Milich that his young daughter had invited them to the orgy:""Are you crazy? We were invited here by the young lady.""""This is preposterous.

I thought the most sexual item was when the charmer was trying to seduce Alice (Nicole Kidman) toward the beginning.Then I have a relative who found it unadulterated smut, nothing socially redeeming (Wasn't that the expression used to rationalize porn years ago?) and I know a Catholic canon lawyer who thought it was &quot;unrealistic, but a good film.&quot;I wasn't impressed with Tom Cruise's acting until &quot;A Few Good Men,&quot; wherein, I understand, Nicholson gave him some (valuable!) tips. In this film, he not only acted well, but his interactions with Kidman, his real-life wife, were stellar! They were a caricature of any marital relationship, assumptions, anxieties--&quot;lack of communication&quot;--especially while under the influence of the evil weed.The others too acted phenomenally. Syndey Pollack should have gotten an Oscar. Even the cassanova after Alice was great at being an obnoxious Don Juan. He made me uncomfortable, and that takes a good actor. (For the other actors and actresses who were as good, forgive me for forgetting your names. You were good too!)For those who haven't read of Kubrick's intent, the character in the novella on which the film is based was &quot;very Jewish.&quot; Stanley apparently avoided that meticulously, instead choosing a consummate WASP--Cruise--to play that part. At that he succeeded.Oh, and I think some of Stanley's fantasies came out in the film too. Call it &quot;director's prerogative.&quot; That's what art is all about.I picked up the soundtrack before seeing the film. I hear the Ligeti minimalism, themes that even I could play, and they echo; I cannot help but remember them (...as the soundtrack plays next to me here...).Like &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; one asks at the end, &quot;What really happened? Was the 'orgy' real? Was the death of the hooker a murder, or was the whole scene at the orgy staged? What was going on with the tailor and his young daughter? How much of that was the lead's fantasy, or perversion, and how much was real?&quot; I've seen the film several times now and still ask those questions and more. Thank you, Stanley. We'll miss you.As for the interviews with Cruise, Kidman, and Spielberg at the end, they're a little sentimental, but reminisce Stanley who obviously had a profound effect on at least those who acted in the film.Those who haven't seen it, watch the film and enjoy it.

118943,A1F5OOEFKR1K3,079074841X,T. Lee,"[2, 2]","This is Stanley Kubrick's final film and probably the most misunderstood masterpiece. And the only reason why I call this film a masterpiece is because it is a very personal film. Kubrick sure has done very iconic films throughout his career, including ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""The Shining"", and ""2001: Space Odyssey"". They are, without a doubt, masterfully shot and very iconic to this day. So there is nothing remotely bad about what he did throughout his filmmaking career. However, this film is a very personal film and I'd even put this up there with ""The Killing"", Kubrick's debut film as my personal favorites. I love Kubrick's other films and they indeed are all masterpieces, but Eyes Wide Shut was something on a whole another level.The film is very complex, besides the basic plot that it is given to you. It is about a couple in New York City undergoes a frustration about their sexual life. They still are a loving couple, and they clearly love each other but Dr. William Harford, played by Tom Cruise, experiences a very strange world of sex. He discovers an underground cult who are there to enjoy the most psychedelic-ish sexual experience.And that is the main key to the film: it really does have a psychedelic feel to the whole film. It is definitely NOT a film such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, per say, as far as the way it is shot and feel like you're on psychedelics, but it is definitely HYPNOTIC. The film is very slow-paced, just like his other films, yet very haunting and hypnotic. And the film has got so much deep meaning behind it, it's not just a one-time view type of film. I think you can literally dissect every parts of the film and interpret them. And I think that is what has to be done to really appreciate this film: viewing it multiple times.Many people hate this film, but I think this is probably Kubrick utmost work, sometimes even past his iconic films. But that is only because it's a very personal piece and I feel like when an artist reaches his very in-depth emotion, they create more of a personal work rather than a flashy and presentable type of work that people would thoroughly enjoy. I am not putting down any of his other works. Like I said before, I enjoy all his films, it's just that if I had to pick out a film very personal and very endearing to me, I'd have to put this one on top above every films he did before.A misunderstood masterpiece is something I have to keep repeating, but try to always remember that no dream is ever just a dream.

Reason one: Kubrickpreffered it to be seen on full screen, 1:1.37 aspect ratio, which is not the way the film was usually screened in theatres. Reason two: to achieve his dream of making a film as simply as possible, Kubrick tried almost not to use artificial &quot;movie&quot; lighting on the set, and force-proccessed the negative and prints. This caused a lot of granes and desaturated colors in most of the dupe prints used in theatrical presentations. Only journalists who could see prints of better generation could really apprecieate the beauty of the photography and the inteligence in the use of colors. Reason three: it's such a complex movie you really can't understnad it in one viewing.  Reason four, which would have been only applicable in the US and Canada, was the digital modification to get an R rating. BUT, the studio preffered to release this mutilated version even on DVD! This is really a disgrace for the American public. The Studio should release the original version, as MGM did on LAST TANGO IN PARIS. The DVD special feature is interviews with Stiephen Spielberg (I don't know why) as well as the stars of the film Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Cruise is surprisingly honest about his difficulties in making this film, nothing like what he used to say a year ago to promote the film. Kidman shows what an inteligent and capable actress she really is inspite of her pretty figure. This film, I think is really her movie. Kubrick, who always portraid men rather than women (even LOLITA was more about James Mason character than Sue Lyon), finally portraid a living woman with depth, full of desires and fears of sexuality. The mistake, I think, of the old master is that he is still showing too much of the husband (who is rather boring) and not showing enough of her.  EYES WIDE SHUT is a flawed film, perhaps.

It was only natural, therefore, that reacton to his final film ""Eyes Wide Shut"" sent the brilliant director out in a blaze of controversy.British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who secured an Oscar for the 1965 drama ""Darling"" with Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde, recounted in his book ""Eyes Wide Open"" which dealt with his relationship with Kubrick, recalled how he got a call from the director one day about a potential project.  The novel he was sent as an adaptation possibility he guessed to be a work by Austrian Arthur Schnitzler, a friend of Sigmund Freud.  Like Freud, Schnitzler was interested in exploring the sexual side of humanity as a clue and index to the species as a whole.That initial call resulted in close collaboration with Kubrick sending a cab to Raphael's South Kensington flat near Gloucester Road and transporting him to his suburban London mansion in quiet and leafy St. Albans.  Kubrick was a man of privacy and after he was satisfied with Raphael's adaptation of Schnitzler's novel ""Traumnovelle"" he undertook a vigorous 400 day shooting schedule that saw him succumb to death before the film could be completed.  The setting was moved from 1920's Vienna to 1990's Manhattan.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then married, developed such a close bond with Kubrick during the filming that he ultimately became a surrogate father of sorts to the attractive couple.  They were compelled to juggle their schedules and eliminate other work opportunities as the production was extended while perfectionist Kubrick insisted that as much time as was necessary would be taken to finish what he hoped would be a fitting masterpiece to culminate a brilliant career.Cruise and Kidman play a highly successful yuppie couple.  Cruise is a doctor while Kidman runs a gallery.  One night after coming home from a party, while Kidman is particularly high on marijuana, she picks an argument with him on the subject of sex.  She tells him about a Cape Cod weekend in his company when she observed a handsome young naval officer.  Kidman confesses that at that point, had the officer been willing, she would have given up her marriage to have sex with the stranger.Kidman's revelation results in Cruise exploring sex in Manhattan.  He observes an instance of child molestation in which an angry father berates the men seeking to take advantage of his young daughter, who begins flirting with Cruise when she shows up to rent a costume.  The costume is needed to crash a sex party at a Long Island mansion that features costumed participants wearing masks.  Before they engage in sexual activity a cult ceremony is performed.  Cruise looks out of place, is discovered, and told to leave.  Patient and friend Sydney Pollack, who was also an attendee, later warns Cruise of the dire consequences of ever crossing such powerful people.During Cruise's wild night of adventure he meets and befriends a prostitute.  He pays her following conversation without exacting sex.  Cruise later learns that she had terminal aids, recognizing how he had barely dodged a sexual bullet.Eventually Cruise realizes following his sexual exploration how much Kidman means to him.  At film's end they are seemingly closer together than ever.  The resulting irony is that following this film the couple in real life terminated their own marriage.",5,Kubrick's Final Film Stirs Controversy,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,3507,"['introduction', 'filmdom', 'big', 'time', 'Spartacus', 'widely', 'discussed', 'Doctor', 'Strangelove', 'Brooklyn', 'born', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'immersed', 'frequent', 'controversy', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'therefore', 'reacton', 'final', 'film', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'sent', 'brilliant', 'director', 'blaze', 'controversy.British', 'screenwriter', 'Frederic', 'Raphael', 'who', 'secured', 'Oscar', '1965', 'drama', 'Darling', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'recounted', 'book', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'dealt', 'relationship', 'Kubrick', 'recalled', 'how', 'got', 'call', 'director', 'one', 'day', 'potential', 'project', 'novel', 'was', 'sent', 'adaptation', 'possibility', 'guessed', 'be', 'work', 'Austrian', 'Arthur', 'Schnitzler', 'friend', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Freud', 'Schnitzler', 'was', 'interested', 'exploring', 'sexual', 'side', 'humanity', 'clue', 'index', 'species', 'initial', 'call', 'resulted', 'close', 'collaboration', 'Kubrick', 'sending', 'cab', 'Raphael', 'South', 'Kensington', 'flat', 'Gloucester', 'Road', 'transporting', 'suburban', 'London', 'mansion', 'quiet', 'leafy', 'St.', 'Albans', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'man', 'privacy', 'was', 'satisfied', 'Raphael', 'adaptation', 'Schnitzler', 'novel', 'Traumnovelle', 'undertook', 'vigorous', '400', 'day', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'saw', 'succumb', 'death', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'completed', 'setting', 'was', 'moved', '1920', 'Vienna', '1990', 'Manhattan.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'then', 'married', 'developed', 'close', 'bond', 'Kubrick', 'filming', 'ultimately', 'became', 'surrogate', 'father', 'sorts', 'attractive', 'couple', 'were', 'compelled', 'juggle', 'schedules', 'eliminate', 'other', 'work', 'opportunities', 'production', 'was', 'extended', 'perfectionist', 'Kubrick', 'insisted', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'necessary', 'would', 'be', 'taken', 'finish', 'what', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'fitting', 'masterpiece', 'culminate', 'brilliant', 'career.Cruise', 'Kidman', 'play', 'highly', 'successful', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'Cruise', 'doctor', 'Kidman', 'gallery', 'One', 'night', 'coming', 'home', 'party', 'Kidman', 'particularly', 'high', 'marijuana', 'argument', 'subject', 'sex', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'weekend', 'company', 'when', 'observed', 'handsome', 'young', 'naval', 'officer', 'Kidman', 'point', 'had', 'officer', 'been', 'willing', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'marriage', 'have', 'sex', 'stranger.Kidman', 'revelation', 'results', 'Cruise', 'exploring', 'sex', 'Manhattan', 'instance', 'child', 'molestation', 'angry', 'father', 'men', 'seeking', 'take', 'advantage', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'flirting', 'Cruise', 'when', 'up', 'rent', 'costume', 'costume', 'needed', 'crash', 'sex', 'party', 'Long', 'Island', 'mansion', 'costumed', 'participants', 'wearing', 'masks', 'engage', 'sexual', 'activity', 'cult', 'ceremony', 'performed', 'Cruise', 'place', 'discovered', 'told', 'leave', 'Patient', 'friend', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'attendee', 'later', 'Cruise', 'dire', 'consequences', 'ever', 'crossing', 'such', 'powerful', 'people.During', 'Cruise', 'wild', 'night', 'adventure', 'prostitute', 'following', 'conversation', 'exacting', 'sex', 'Cruise', 'later', 'had', 'terminal', 'aids', 'recognizing', 'how', 'had', 'barely', 'dodged', 'sexual', 'bullet.Eventually', 'Cruise', 'following', 'sexual', 'exploration', 'how', 'much', 'Kidman', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'seemingly', 'closer', 'together', 'ever', 'resulting', 'irony', 'following', 'film', 'couple', 'real', 'life', 'terminated', 'own', 'marriage']",N/A

On the basic level, it is a movie about a man who, with good reason, is insecure in his marriage. His wife's fantasies of being with other men, drives him into the streets to find adventure and sex. He finds more than he bargins for.On another level, this movie is about the rich. It shows that once one reaches a certain financial and business level, one could resort to baser things. Once all other goals are accomplished, what's left but debauchery?On the deepest level, this movie deals with secret societies. What goes on behind the scenes of the true ""Elite"". Tom Cruse's character is obviously rich, but he is nowhere near the level of rich as many of his patients, especially one who invites him yearly to his ""Christmas"" party. The symbolism at this party is rife with illuminati symbols. The plethora of 8 pointed stars alight everywhere. The ""Christmas"" trees, which most think, even most Christians,is a Christian symbol...It's not. The line where the ""models/prostitutes"" promise to take Tom Cruise to the ""End of the Rainbow"" etc...Intrestingly both had power elite names, one being Windsor (The Queen of England).Finally, The ceremony at the mansion replete with chanting, the censer of smoke, naked bodies, wild sex and human sacriice. Can anyone say ""Witchcraft?"" The threats that come after this, and the cover ups. Power Elite people, power elite. Anyway, Stanley Kubrick told us a lot about what goes on in his world, maybe more than he should have, he did die in the middle of making this. But, I will leave off on this line of reasoning, lest I be accused of being a conspiracy theorist! I believe the title ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has more to do with society. Our refusal to see what is right before our very eyes. This seems like just a movie, and for those who see it that way, you might not like it at all. For those of us whose eyes are wide OPEN, there's a lot to learn and understand here.I only gave it four stars, because I didn't like the ending, it seemed a bit anti-climactic.

The cinematography was amazing, dark sequences, an  excellent soundtrack that fit the movie well, dare I say, it was a  masterpiece. Certainly, 'Eyes Wide Shut' pales in comparison to Kubrick's  earlier works, such as 'The Shining', and 'Full Metal Jacket', but when  presented in the late 1990's, it is actually a breath of fresh air...Right from the  beginning, the viewer knows that 'Eyes Wide Shut' isn't going to be one of  your run-of-the-mill suspenseful films. Although the movie gets off to a  slow start, it picks up pace, and the viewer doesn't really understand  what's going on. First, the protagonist of the movie, Tom Cruise, meets a  member of a Jazz band(a former classmate in College) at some sort of  function, the Jazz player tells Cruise about a &quot;really strange  gig&quot; he had at a Mansion earlier. Since Cruise is having a turbelent  time in his household, he decides he wants to see what exactly the Jazz  Musician is talking about. And once he discovers what the Musician was  talking about, he is probably sorry that he ever met the Jazz Musician.

The pacing is simply fantastic. It's slow enough to keep you on the edge of your seat (yes, im serious), yet not to the point where it annoys you. It has that usual Kubrick style, and is VERY arty. Full of many shocking and startling images (not macabre or gross, merely unexpected) including the nude Nicole Kidman standing with her back to the camera a few moments into the film, juxtaposed with the simplistic opening credits. Simply a PERFECT movie. Kubrick strived hard to acheive this perfection (explaining the record setting 18 month shoot), and he certainly was successful. Seeing the film made me only miss that wonderful director all the more. He was truly one of the greatest directors in history. The film was beautiful and mystifying at times as well, obviously dream-like, yet not a sugar-coated kind. It was as if everything was very familiar, yet so bizarre at the same time. This effect made the film quite unsettling, and all the more powerful. Hats of to exquisite score, perfect for the film, including Shostakovich, Grygory Leti, and Bob Dylan, also hats off to Nicole Kidman, who gave a fantastic and underrated performance as Alice. Nicole is not one of my favorite actresses, yet this performance I found WONDERFUL, and it makes me see her as a much better actress, I hope it wasnt the performance of her career, I hope she outdoes this tour-de-force. This film is ART. Every frame is like a painting, every motion is choreography, every line of dialogue is poetry. Everyone has made this film notorious because of its sexual nature (although it really is NOT all that sexual), which makes me sad, for people don't show enough appretiation for this fantastic swan song of Kubrick's. This film is wonderful, see it and be amazed. After all, how can you possibly go wrong with a film whose last word of dialogue is ""f**k""",5,Simply Astonishing,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,1957,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'greatest', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'sat', 'mezmerized', 'length', 'pacing', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'slow', 'enough', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'yes', 'im', 'serious', 'yet', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'usual', 'Kubrick', 'style', 'VERY', 'arty', 'Full', 'many', 'shocking', 'startling', 'images', 'not', 'macabre', 'gross', 'merely', 'unexpected', 'including', 'nude', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'standing', 'back', 'camera', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'juxtaposed', 'simplistic', 'opening', 'credits', 'Simply', 'PERFECT', 'movie', 'Kubrick', 'strived', 'hard', 'acheive', 'perfection', 'explaining', 'record', 'setting', '18', 'month', 'shoot', 'certainly', 'was', 'successful', 'Seeing', 'film', 'made', 'only', 'miss', 'wonderful', 'director', 'more', 'was', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'history', 'film', 'was', 'beautiful', 'mystifying', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'obviously', 'dream-like', 'yet', 'not', 'sugar-coated', 'kind', 'was', 'everything', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'yet', 'so', 'bizarre', 'same', 'time', 'effect', 'made', 'film', 'quite', 'unsettling', 'more', 'powerful', 'Hats', 'exquisite', 'score', 'perfect', 'film', 'including', 'Shostakovich', 'Grygory', 'Leti', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'also', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'gave', 'fantastic', 'underrated', 'performance', 'Alice', 'Nicole', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'yet', 'performance', 'found', 'WONDERFUL', 'see', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'hope', 'performance', 'career', 'hope', 'tour-de-force', 'film', 'ART', 'Every', 'frame', 'painting', 'motion', 'choreography', 'line', 'dialogue', 'poetry', 'Everyone', 'made', 'film', 'notorious', 'sexual', 'nature', 'really', 'NOT', 'sexual', 'sad', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'enough', 'appretiation', 'fantastic', 'swan', 'song', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'wonderful', 'see', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'last', 'word', 'dialogue', 'f**k']",N/A

Could it be that they're supposed to make you question things about life, trust, love, sex, marriage, the American Dream? Despite the pacing, this will have you--if  you are in any sense thoughtful, or introspective--wondering a lot of  things, in the film and in life. Stunning from frame one, it never  relinquishes it's tight hold on the senses of the viewer.  But that's why  it's an misunderstood masterwork. It draws you in and teases like an  impressionist painting.  You get too close to it, you begin to see flaws.  Things never are totally what they appear to be, nothing's ever all good or  all bad, black or white, I mean, can you really trust what you think you  see? Is the image of the good life, the good life? We all do kinda take  things for face value, that's for sure.  And movies are reflective of some  of our overall views. But movies are colored light images projected on a  screen, right? Real or unreal?EWS messed with one's mind on several  levels--did you accept rich man's Sydney Pollack's explanation of the  mansion's going's on? Plenty of Freudian slips and verbal faux pas,  there--evil incarnate, there. Did Nicole have an affair with the naval  officer (even in thought) or not? Was Tom's (although we want to side with  the integrity of the main character) answer's to Nicole's questions--ie, he  never once felt enticed by a female patients body even in the clinical  setting--completely honest? Will men ever be as honest as women? Will women  ever be as dishonest as men? Or are they equally prone to being  corrupted/corruptible/incorrigible? Were you perplexed as to how  provocative those &quot;blue lust shots&quot; of Nicole with her naval  officer were--even if they were taken for the cinema, Tom &amp; Nicole are  married in real life and it must've been quite a surreal experience having  to go through it, for all parties involved. Notice how Kubrick's use of  color punctuated certain passions...particularly red. Almost like an Ingmar  Bergman film.There are little nuances in Kidman's acting (take a look at  &quot;To Die For&quot; and &quot;Malice&quot;, by the way) that makes one  believes that she &quot;knew&quot; of Tom's goings on at the mansion,  (hell, she may have even been one of the masked sex slaves), at the  hooker's apartment, even when he is confronted at Pollack's--she didn't  have to be told, but the fact that Tom DID tell, however, sets well with  the American filmgoer's desire for a linear, &quot;and they lived happily  ever after&quot; story... at last, we want to believe our certain accepted  notions will never be challenged. But they are, and they always are...and,  sadly, most of us would rather keep our eyes wide shut to these  challenges...For those of us who don't mind the challenge, the questions  and the debates, this provocative film is gonna be in our mental libraries  for years to come...",5,Flawed masterwork.....,953510400,"03 20, 2000",2000,2938,"['What', 'movie', 'supposed', 'do', 'besides', 'entertain', 'Could', 'be', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'make', 'question', 'things', 'life', 'trust', 'love', 'sex', 'marriage', 'American', 'Dream', 'pacing', 'will', 'have', 'are', 'sense', 'thoughtful', 'introspective', 'wondering', 'lot', 'things', 'film', 'life', 'Stunning', 'frame', 'one', 'never', 'tight', 'hold', 'senses', 'viewer', 'why', 'misunderstood', 'masterwork', 'teases', 'impressionist', 'painting', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'begin', 'see', 'flaws', 'Things', 'never', 'are', 'totally', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'nothing', 'ever', 'good', 'bad', 'black', 'white', 'mean', 'can', 'really', 'trust', 'what', 'think', 'see', 'image', 'good', 'life', 'good', 'life', 'do', 'kinda', 'take', 'things', 'face', 'value', 'sure', 'movies', 'are', 'reflective', 'overall', 'views', 'movies', 'are', 'colored', 'light', 'images', 'projected', 'screen', 'right', 'Real', 'unreal', 'EWS', 'messed', 'one', 'mind', 'several', 'levels', 'did', 'accept', 'rich', 'man', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'explanation', 'mansion', 'going', 'Plenty', 'Freudian', 'slips', 'verbal', 'faux', 'pas', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'Did', 'Nicole', 'have', 'affair', 'naval', 'officer', 'even', 'thought', 'not', 'Was', 'Tom', 'want', 'side', 'integrity', 'main', 'character', 'answer', 'Nicole', 'questions', 'ie', 'never', 'once', 'felt', 'enticed', 'female', 'patients', 'body', 'even', 'clinical', 'setting', 'completely', 'honest', 'Will', 'men', 'ever', 'be', 'as', 'honest', 'women', 'Will', 'women', 'ever', 'be', 'as', 'dishonest', 'men', 'are', 'equally', 'prone', 'being', 'corrupted/corruptible/incorrigible', 'Were', 'perplexed', 'how', 'provocative', 'quot', 'blue', 'lust', 'shots', 'quot', 'Nicole', 'naval', 'officer', 'were', 'even', 'were', 'taken', 'cinema', 'Tom', 'amp', 'Nicole', 'are', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quite', 'surreal', 'experience', 'having', 'go', 'parties', 'involved', 'Notice', 'how', 'Kubrick', 'use', 'color', 'punctuated', 'certain', 'passions', 'particularly', 'red', 'Almost', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'are', 'little', 'nuances', 'Kidman', 'acting', 'take', 'look', 'quot', 'Die', 'quot', 'quot', 'Malice', 'quot', 'way', 'one', 'quot', 'quot', 'Tom', 'goings', 'mansion', 'hell', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'one', 'masked', 'sex', 'slaves', 'hooker', 'apartment', 'even', 'when', 'confronted', 'Pollack', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'told', 'fact', 'Tom', 'DID', 'tell', 'however', 'sets', 'well', 'American', 'filmgoer', 'desire', 'linear', 'quot', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'quot', 'story', 'last', 'want', 'believe', 'certain', 'accepted', 'notions', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'challenged', 'are', 'always', 'are', 'sadly', 'most', 'would', 'rather', 'keep', 'eyes', 'wide', 'shut', 'challenges', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'challenge', 'questions', 'debates', 'provocative', 'film', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'mental', 'libraries', 'years', 'come']",N/A

I think that all people can agree that Eyes Wide Shut is not what they were expecting.  The biggest mistake is wanting this film to be titillating or  erotic.  The pace is slow and deliberate, and the majority of the action is  Tom Cruise walking.  He passes through other peoples lives as an  observer,or more aptly, a sleepwalker. He is a man who's foundation has  been uprooted, when he learns that his wife has an inner fantasy life he  has never been privy to.  Shaken by this, he drifts in and out of other's  eroticism while never participating. A dreamlike sense of nostalgia  pervades the story, and it strongly recalls the bar-sequence in The  Shining. A sense of &quot;Is this happening?&quot;One note: The digital  people are obvious and distracting, and it is too bad that American  audiences are at the mercy of censors.  I realize that the additions were  OK'd by Kubrick, but it definitely lessons the impact of the film.

These people should be angry, but not at the author.  People, who do not usually watch Kubrick, fell for the promise of sex. Well, guess what? There is no sex, not really....This film is not about orgies or sexual excesses. These elements were used as metaphors for frailty of human mind and social excesses. The opening scene shows Cruise and Kidman rushing off to some &quot;socializing event&quot;, leaving their young daugther with a baby-sitter. So, there you have it-a moral. Another moral comes when Cruise is wearing a mask in certain scenes. As Oscar Wilde put it: &quot;Give the man a mask, and he will show you his face&quot;.  I think Kubrick was striving to demonstrate that.I like the film, but the ads called it &quot;Kubrick's best film&quot;. It is not. This may be his last film, but definitely not the best one.
