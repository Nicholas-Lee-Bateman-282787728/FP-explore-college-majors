The plot has been done so many times it's truly impossible to come up with anything original along the same lines. It's the sort of movie you can watch when you don't want anything that would make you think. Miranda Cosgrove is an amazing, talented actress, so this movie fit her pretty well. Still, the movie is a pleasant diversion for a rainy afternoon.",3,"Not bad, but not good.",1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,428,"['Cute', 'first', 'word', 'mind', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'truly', 'impossible', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'original', 'same', 'lines', 'sort', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'would', 'make', 'think', 'Miranda', 'Cosgrove', 'amazing', 'talented', 'actress', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'Still', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",The Wild Stallion

And the landscape in the movie was just the most beautiful for wild horses to run on, but then there were the stupid, evil ones who were 'stealing' the wild horses from the range. The landscape looked far more beautiful with horses on it than it would if there was just another house or mall on it.Mother Nature keeps on disappearing to make more room for humans to destroy nice places like that.

The acting is below par (except for the barrel-racing girl, a natural and promising actress), the dialogue tries to be too clever, and the baddies are annoying (is there any other kind . . . ?). They stick pretty well to the facts, as far as wild horses go, and the use of the Judas horse. The horses all look nice and well-cared for, even if they are clearly not mustangs. By the way, I highly recommend The Phantom Stallion. Maybe one day they'll make a movie/series out of it.",2,I've seen better ...,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,630,"['story', 'remarkable', 'resemblance', 'Phantom', 'Stallion', 'charm', 'made', 'one', 'favorite', 'book', 'series', 'growing', 'up', 'acting', 'par', 'barrel-racing', 'girl', 'natural', 'promising', 'actress', 'dialogue', 'tries', 'be', 'too', 'clever', 'baddies', 'are', 'annoying', 'there', 'other', 'kind', 'stick', 'pretty', 'well', 'facts', 'as', 'far', 'wild', 'horses', 'go', 'use', 'Judas', 'horse', 'horses', 'look', 'nice', 'well-cared', 'even', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'mustangs', 'way', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Phantom', 'Stallion', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'make', 'movie/series']",The Wild Stallion
