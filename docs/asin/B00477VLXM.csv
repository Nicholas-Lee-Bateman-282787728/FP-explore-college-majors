The accents in it bring the more British authenticity to it, although some voices I believe to be better in the Japanese version; however I prefer having the accents, makes it more realistic.As the series go on you just swoon more and more over Sebastian and his sexyness!!The plot, at times seems to go off track and into a random episode that really has nothing to do with the plot but although there maybe an episode or two like that the entire thing falls together at the end and makes for a fantastic show.I greatly reccommend this show to anyone who loves anime, guaranteed you'll love it.Not to mention the box is absolutely beautiful (I have the limited edition box however).

It's not the same as the Japanese voice, but in a way, it's better. Although it might take time to get used to, especially if you've heard the Japanese version, Sebastian was done a lot of justice with the chosen voice. Ditto for Ciel.The manga and anime are very different. They leave each other out, so don't come in here expecting every character to join the party. The ones that do, though, are very entertaining.

Because despite the strong animation & decent voice acting, this just wasn't as strong as it could have been.First off I want to praise Funimation for their dubbing. The original voice acting might be superior but this was quite well done & shows exactly how far dubbing has come in the last 10-15 years. There's a few weak spots here & there but it's good enough that you won't regret watching the dubbed versions at those times when you're just not in the mood for subtitles. The artwork is also very well done in this series. There are nice colors & I love letting my eyes slide over the character designs.Where the series trips over itself is in the filler episodes. They're OK enough but they're just rather weak sauce in comparison to the other episodes. I normally don't take off points for filler episodes but they just dilute the set as a whole. When the series is on point it's awesome, but when it drags it really drags.Despite this I would still recommend getting this box set or watching it online.

I think the voice actors at Funamation did a bang up job with the dubbing.  Both versions have their own flavor.I've been watching Black Butler II on Hulu.com and hope that it gets licensed soon for release on DVD.I have also been buying the manga and greatly enjoy that version of the story as well.,5,Fantastic Anime,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,391,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Black', 'Butler', 'was', 'presented', 'YaoiCon', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'think', 'voice', 'actors', 'Funamation', 'did', 'bang', 'up', 'job', 'dubbing', 'versions', 'have', 'own', 'flavor.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Black', 'Butler', 'II', 'Hulu.com', 'hope', 'licensed', 'soon', 'release', 'DVD.I', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'buying', 'manga', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'version', 'story', 'as', 'well']",N/A

First time I saw this or heard of it was when I was radomally looking on mangafox to discover more manga.  And I stumbled upon this.  Now, usually what makes me want to really read something is by the art work or the title to it.  And seeing as how I like things dark and depressing, I chose to give this a little shot.  Maaan, I LOVE THIS!!!  You guys would probably drop dead with laughter if you ever stumble upon the scene where Sebastian puts Ciel in a corset.  That was classic!  But I'm not going to spoil it 'cause that would be evil, but I can't get off into it that much because I'm only on vol. 5 and I've had some sneak peaks with the episodes on youtube, but by far what I've seen, Square Enix is once again at it.  If any of you have heard Vampire Knight and or Will O' Wisp (All time favs), then you'll TOTALLY love this one.  If not, there is something incrediably wrong with you guys.  But be forwarned, the anime and manga don't exactly have the same story line as I found that out the hard way.  The circus one is only in the manga cause I didn't see it when I was watching some of the anime.  But get this, you'll love the dark humor, sad moments, and...I'm not too sure about the questionable yaoi...but I love it!
