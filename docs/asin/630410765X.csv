This film, which centers around the events of a young woman's passion to become an actress. (Played very well by the attractive Theresa  Randle), Girl 6, becomes frustrated and broken, she takes a job as a phone  sex operator. The job becomes her center-point as it sets a tone of dark  strange obsession for her life. Interesting premise, the film is overlong,  uneven and there is a lack of passion throughout its length. Spike Lee's  character provides minimalist comic relief in a film that is not meant to  be comical. Excellent cinematography. The Prince music is a plus.

And now her nominal agent is going to be upset that she walked out on this ""big break"" that he set up all for her.But all that drama is not helping Judy pay the bills and put food on the table. So she decides to answer an employment ad in a newspaper that promises the opportunity to make great cash through work over the telephone.And this is where Judy (portrayed by Theresa Randle) becomes Girl 6, the phone sex operator. Directed by Spike Lee - with the screenplay by Suzan-Lori Parks - it is an oftentimes funny, but also quite serious and sometimes disturbing look into a woman who truly becomes a number as she tries to chase her dream of an acting career.The plot goes full-circle, with Judy learning as much about herself as how the game is played on the fringes of the ""entertainment"" industry, along with a demoralizing gaze into the anonymity of life and the manipulation by depersonalizing the individual.It truly is a look into the emptiness of talk, talk.",5,"Talk, Talk",1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1281,"['Judy', 'life', 'free-fall.Her', 'ex-husband', 'light', 'years', 'being', 'career-orientated', 'best', 'friend', 'wannabe', 'sports', 'memorabilia', 'dealer', 'just', 'suffered', 'job', 'interview', 'slick-talking', 'movie', 'director', 'who', 'eyes', 'casting', 'couch', 'more', 'looking', 'next', 'big', 'star', 'now', 'nominal', 'agent', 'going', 'be', 'upset', 'walked', 'out', 'big', 'break', 'set', 'up', 'her.But', 'drama', 'not', 'helping', 'Judy', 'pay', 'bills', 'put', 'food', 'table', 'answer', 'employment', 'ad', 'newspaper', 'opportunity', 'make', 'great', 'cash', 'work', 'telephone.And', 'where', 'Judy', 'portrayed', 'Theresa', 'Randle', 'Girl', '6', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'Directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'screenplay', 'Suzan-Lori', 'Parks', 'oftentimes', 'funny', 'also', 'quite', 'serious', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'look', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'number', 'chase', 'dream', 'acting', 'career.The', 'plot', 'full-circle', 'Judy', 'learning', 'as', 'much', 'how', 'game', 'played', 'fringes', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'demoralizing', 'gaze', 'anonymity', 'life', 'manipulation', 'depersonalizing', 'individual.It', 'truly', 'look', 'emptiness', 'talk', 'talk']",Girl 6 VHS

401754,A3K51Z8GYTWAEE,630410765X,"Danniray99 ""Danniray""","[0, 0]","Spike Lee's ""Girl 6"" is a strange, open-ended comedy-drama that actually amounts to little more than a tantalizing character study. The film's protagonist, Judy (Theresa Randle), is an out-of-work actress from New York who moonlights as an assembly-line phone sex operator.  After she's dropped by her agent and acting coach, and humiliated in casting calls (she's repeatedly asked, for example, to disrobe before casting directors), Judy joins a group of ""office girls"" who anonymously entertain a motley crew of male callers, indulging their fantasies with steamy sex- or psychological talk while remaining thoroughly disengaged.  Largely young, attractive (the film features a very young Naomi Campbell) and racially diverse, the ladies are resigned to such work because they can't catch a break elsewhere.  At once intriguing and repulsive, this newfound sideline exposes Judy's emotional baggage and sorely tests her self-esteem and fortitude as she longs for a career as a legitimate actress.  ""Girl 6"" is sometimes quite funny, but it's also a none-too-subtle commentary about the (well-known) dearth of meaningful roles and opportunities for Black actors.  Likewise, there are plenty of sign-posts about the corrosive side-effects of the sex trade and, finally, sly, careful-what-you-wish-for insinuations about the pitfalls of mainstream success (Judy's idol is Dorothy Dandridge, who in 1955 became the first Black Actress to be nominated for an Academy Award in a leading role [""Carmen Jones""].  Dandridge died at age 42, penniless, heartbroken and virtually forgotten).  As Judy, Theresa Randle is a jaw-dropping specimen. Her face is at once breathtakingly innocent, fresh and world weary.  She, like the movie itself, leaves us wanting more. ""Girl 6"" is perfectly watchable, but the overall effect is far too sketchy to be compelling.  Spike Lee himself appears as Judy's next-door neighbor and best friend.  Also with Isaiah Washington and memorable cameos by the likes of Quentin Tarrantino, Madonna, Ron Silver and Halle Berry (who, coincidentally, later won acclaim for her 1998 portrayal of Dandridge and subsequently went on to claim an Oscar for Best Actress for ""Monster's Ball"" in 2001).  The film's soundtrack--by turns loopy, dissonant, and furtively sexual--is produced by--who else?--Prince.",3,Engaging but sketchy character study. . .,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,2318,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'Girl', '6', 'strange', 'open-ended', 'comedy-drama', 'actually', 'little', 'more', 'tantalizing', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Judy', 'Theresa', 'Randle', 'out-of-work', 'actress', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'moonlights', 'assembly-line', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'dropped', 'agent', 'acting', 'coach', 'humiliated', 'casting', 'calls', 'repeatedly', 'asked', 'example', 'disrobe', 'casting', 'directors', 'Judy', 'group', 'office', 'girls', 'who', 'anonymously', 'entertain', 'motley', 'crew', 'male', 'callers', 'indulging', 'fantasies', 'steamy', 'sex-', 'psychological', 'talk', 'remaining', 'thoroughly', 'disengaged', 'Largely', 'young', 'attractive', 'film', 'very', 'young', 'Naomi', 'Campbell', 'racially', 'diverse', 'ladies', 'are', 'resigned', 'such', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'break', 'elsewhere', 'once', 'intriguing', 'repulsive', 'newfound', 'sideline', 'Judy', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'sorely', 'self-esteem', 'fortitude', 'career', 'legitimate', 'actress', 'Girl', '6', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'funny', 'also', 'none-too-subtle', 'commentary', 'well-known', 'dearth', 'meaningful', 'roles', 'opportunities', 'Black', 'actors', 'Likewise', 'are', 'plenty', 'sign-posts', 'corrosive', 'side-effects', 'sex', 'trade', 'finally', 'sly', 'careful-what-you-wish-for', 'insinuations', 'pitfalls', 'mainstream', 'success', 'Judy', 'idol', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'who', '1955', 'became', 'first', 'Black', 'Actress', 'be', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'leading', 'role', 'Carmen', 'Jones', ']', 'Dandridge', 'died', 'age', '42', 'penniless', 'heartbroken', 'virtually', 'forgotten', 'Judy', 'Theresa', 'Randle', 'jaw-dropping', 'specimen', 'face', 'once', 'breathtakingly', 'innocent', 'fresh', 'world', 'weary', 'movie', 'wanting', 'more', 'Girl', '6', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'overall', 'effect', 'far', 'too', 'sketchy', 'be', 'compelling', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Judy', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'best', 'friend', 'Also', 'Isaiah', 'Washington', 'memorable', 'cameos', 'likes', 'Quentin', 'Tarrantino', 'Madonna', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'later', 'won', 'acclaim', '1998', 'portrayal', 'Dandridge', 'subsequently', 'went', 'claim', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Monster', 'Ball', '2001', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'turns', 'loopy', 'dissonant', 'furtively', 'sexual', 'produced', 'who', 'else', 'Prince']",Girl 6 VHS
401755,A324A25PC1DFMF,630410765X,"Darryl K. Clark ""pywakkit""","[2, 2]","'girl 6' is one of the few spike lee films that i appreciate wholly and in parts.the first part is suzan-lori parks' screenplay.  there are times when it feels like a goodly portion of the dialogue is being written as the actors speak the lines.  her words are that good.  the situation which her heroine finds herself in is one that any performer has dealt with.  she somehow manages to plunge the depths of human experience and pull herself up to reconnect with her ambitions to become a working actress without compromise.the second is theresa randle's performance as girl 6.  6 (or judy) has a lot of issues, a great deal of baggage to carry and randle doesn't hold back in revealing any of 6's complexity.  she is vain, she is overly romantic, she is strong and she, as a character, is in great hands with randle.  i can always turn to this film and jump in because randle's performance is that finely crafted and inviting.  a sad postscript is that this fabulous actress hasn't had much to do since this film was released in 1996.the third is the supporting cast, filled with many recognizable faces such as isiah washington, jenifer lewis, gretchen mol, naomi campbell, richard belzer, madonna, michael imperioli, debi mazar, debra wilson, quentin tarantino, john turturro and lee himself. many of these actors had worked or continue to work with lee on his joints.  the cast is an embarassment of riches and each actor comes through.the fourth is the soundtrack made up of prince tunes.  lee uses the music well and the songs are some of the best prince recorded, especially 'erotic city', 'how come u don't call me...' and 'nothing compares to u'.  not to mention the sneak-ins of prince-produced classic like 'nasty girl' and 'screams of passion'.fifth, and i write this gingerly, is the signature use of subplot.  lee uses this device in his films seemingly in an effort to make them longer.  they add little or nothing to the general action nor do they move the films forward with ease.  'girl 6' has one of these subplots and it is only at the last third of the film that is seems that it's affecting the film for the worse.but for the most part, the visuals are stimulating, and at times poetic, the editing and camerawork are dancelike and not too gimmicky and everything works together in a funny, touching whole that sparks some interesting discussion about sex, women and their bodies when they are in the entertainment industry by choice or design.",5,"'6' is for sex, fun, laughs, a few tears and a good time",1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,2467,"['6', 'one', 'few', 'spike', 'lee', 'films', 'i', 'appreciate', 'wholly', 'parts.the', 'first', 'part', 'suzan-lori', 'parks', 'screenplay', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'goodly', 'portion', 'dialogue', 'being', 'written', 'actors', 'speak', 'lines', 'words', 'are', 'good', 'situation', 'heroine', 'one', 'performer', 'dealt', 'somehow', 'manages', 'plunge', 'depths', 'human', 'experience', 'pull', 'up', 'reconnect', 'ambitions', 'become', 'working', 'actress', 'compromise.the', 'second', 'theresa', 'randle', 'performance', 'girl', '6', '6', 'judy', 'lot', 'issues', 'great', 'deal', 'baggage', 'carry', 'randle', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'revealing', '6', 'complexity', 'vain', 'overly', 'romantic', 'strong', 'character', 'great', 'hands', 'randle', 'i', 'can', 'always', 'turn', 'film', 'jump', 'randle', 'performance', 'finely', 'crafted', 'inviting', 'sad', 'postscript', 'fabulous', 'actress', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1996.the', 'third', 'supporting', 'cast', 'filled', 'many', 'recognizable', 'such', 'isiah', 'washington', 'jenifer', 'lewis', 'gretchen', 'mol', 'naomi', 'campbell', 'richard', 'belzer', 'madonna', 'michael', 'imperioli', 'debi', 'mazar', 'debra', 'wilson', 'quentin', 'tarantino', 'john', 'turturro', 'lee', 'many', 'actors', 'had', 'worked', 'continue', 'work', 'lee', 'joints', 'cast', 'embarassment', 'riches', 'actor', 'through.the', 'fourth', 'soundtrack', 'made', 'prince', 'tunes', 'lee', 'music', 'well', 'songs', 'are', 'best', 'prince', 'recorded', 'especially', ""'erotic"", 'city', 'come', 'u', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', ""'nothing"", 'compares', 'u', 'not', 'mention', 'sneak-ins', 'prince-produced', 'classic', ""'nasty"", 'girl', ""'screams"", ""passion'.fifth"", 'i', 'write', 'gingerly', 'signature', 'use', 'subplot', 'lee', 'device', 'films', 'seemingly', 'effort', 'make', 'longer', 'add', 'little', 'nothing', 'general', 'action', 'do', 'move', 'films', 'forward', 'ease', '6', 'one', 'subplots', 'only', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'affecting', 'film', 'worse.but', 'most', 'part', 'visuals', 'are', 'stimulating', 'times', 'poetic', 'editing', 'camerawork', 'are', 'dancelike', 'not', 'too', 'gimmicky', 'everything', 'together', 'funny', 'touching', 'whole', 'interesting', 'discussion', 'sex', 'women', 'bodies', 'when', 'are', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'choice', 'design']",Girl 6 VHS

Blockbuster should put it in the strange but un-true isle.""Girl 6"" is a very rare movie, because as far as I can think, it's the only miss by the brilliant Spike Lee. It's just such a convoluted mix because the plot is changing and running all around in different places. The lead actress Theresa Randle (Judy) was one minute auditioning for a movie, then working as a phone sex operator and then there's all these scenes about a missing girl from NY (90's ""b-talk show star,"" Rolonda Watts played a newscaster.) None of it made much sense to me. Theresa Randle either tried way too hard or not enough because she just didn't come off as a believable character.And, it seemed that perhaps Spike had some very subtle messages of social equality. I especially picked this up when Jennifer Lewis (Boss #1, Lil) mouthed to all her girls that unless otherwise told, they were all ""w-h-i-t-e."" But this is again something that wasn't really touched upon throughout the movie.I did enjoy the soundtrack very much, by Prince. He actually wrote an entire song of CDs just for this movie which are amazing. And the movie also includes lots of cameos: Martin-the-caller was played by Kid Creole and the Coconuts star ~ Coati Mundi, Girl #75 was played by everyone's favorite model who just can't keep her hands to herself ~ Naomi Campbell and everyone's favorite inmaterial girl played Boss #3. And Halle Berry even pops up briefly in a walk-on role as heself.If you want to see this movie, it comes on Encore often and was just added to Comcast's on-demand menu.

401767,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,630410765X,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[10, 11]","1996: Spike Lee directed this movie believe it or not. He wrote the screenplay and performed in the role of the wise, comforting and dreamer neighboor in Lovely's apartment. Theresa Randle of the Bad Boys film, stars as Lovely, or the eponymous Girl 6. When I saw this film, I could not believe it was a Spike Lee film, but his presence in the movie and his signature urban themes are distinctly marked in this movie. The film deals with an aspiring actress who is coaxed into working as a phone sex operator. Despite the good money it pays, it becomes messy and dangerous for her after a client becomes insanely obscessed with her. Her relationship with her (boyfriend ? husband ?) is in jeopardy due to her choice of work. Although clearly this movie attempts to be serious, there are many comic features written into many of the scenes, particularily the sordid, bizarre and outrageous sexual fantasies of the clients. The phone sex scenes that play out between the operators and their clients are hilarious! The ""fantasy sequences"" in which Lovely acts out various roles from television and film are also hilarious. These roles are: Lovely as Dorothy Dandridge in Carmen Jones, as the daughter in the old sitcom The Jeffersons, as Pam Grier's Foxy Brown in 70's exploitation movies and as a 30's or 40's Hollywood Golden Age diva towards the end of the film shot in black and white.Guest stars abound in this witty urban comic drama. Among them Madonna, as a phone sex operator instructor who is giving the girls tips and advice via a monitor, Halle Barry in a brief interview scene, and even Quentin Terentino shows up in the film. I don't know whether to laugh non stop at one of the silliest films ever made by Spike Lee or to wonder at the subtle signficance of its theme. Spike Lee seems to be portraying a strong black woman who undergoes terrible misfortune in a dark and risky business only to give it up in a beautiful scene towards the end when she and her boyfriend/husband kiss and telephones start falling from the sky in slow motion. In Hollywood, she does not give up her morals or dignity and refuses to do a nude sex scene that might be featured in pornpgraphy. It's really a look at Hollywood's love for sex, its classless tastes and its exploitation of women. It might be Spike Lee's greatest film. Just try to look beyond the comedy.",5,A Serious Comedy From Spike Lee,1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,2357,"['1996', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'directed', 'movie', 'believe', 'not', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'performed', 'role', 'wise', 'comforting', 'dreamer', 'neighboor', 'Lovely', 'apartment', 'Theresa', 'Randle', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'film', 'Lovely', 'eponymous', 'Girl', '6', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'presence', 'movie', 'signature', 'urban', 'themes', 'are', 'distinctly', 'marked', 'movie', 'film', 'deals', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'who', 'coaxed', 'working', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'good', 'money', 'messy', 'dangerous', 'client', 'insanely', 'obscessed', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'husband', 'jeopardy', 'due', 'choice', 'work', 'clearly', 'movie', 'be', 'serious', 'are', 'many', 'comic', 'features', 'written', 'many', 'scenes', 'particularily', 'sordid', 'bizarre', 'outrageous', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'clients', 'phone', 'sex', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'operators', 'clients', 'are', 'hilarious', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'Lovely', 'out', 'various', 'roles', 'television', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'hilarious', 'roles', 'are', 'Lovely', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'Carmen', 'Jones', 'daughter', 'old', 'sitcom', 'Jeffersons', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Foxy', 'Brown', '70', 'exploitation', 'movies', '30', '40', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'diva', 'end', 'film', 'shot', 'black', 'white.Guest', 'stars', 'abound', 'witty', 'urban', 'comic', 'drama', 'Madonna', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'instructor', 'who', 'giving', 'girls', 'tips', 'advice', 'monitor', 'Halle', 'Barry', 'brief', 'interview', 'scene', 'even', 'Quentin', 'Terentino', 'up', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'non', 'stop', 'one', 'silliest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'wonder', 'subtle', 'signficance', 'theme', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'be', 'portraying', 'strong', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'terrible', 'misfortune', 'dark', 'risky', 'business', 'only', 'give', 'up', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'boyfriend/husband', 'kiss', 'telephones', 'start', 'falling', 'sky', 'slow', 'motion', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'morals', 'dignity', 'refuses', 'do', 'nude', 'sex', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'featured', 'pornpgraphy', 'really', 'look', 'Hollywood', 'love', 'sex', 'classless', 'tastes', 'exploitation', 'women', 'might', 'be', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'greatest', 'film', 'Just', 'try', 'look', 'comedy']",Girl 6 VHS

Like the music, buy the CD. It is good with Erotic City, Nasty Girl, 13 Kickin' tracks, &#34;Original Soundtrack&#34;, a sad, emotional movie, the part where she went to meet a man she'd talked to, but... she waited, like perhaps he didn't know she was a pretty black woman, doing  what she felt she needed to for income. We often must do things in life we abhor, but must. I judge this movie worth seeing, she was not &#34;selling her body&#34; nor spirit, just TCB (Taking Care of Business), so I felt empathy for her Character. This was the best &#34;Prince&#34; movie I've seen. Empathy is good, feeling for others, good.. I sure didn't feel like looking down on the girl, rather, felt like I wanted to comfort her,  hold her, tell her, &#34;Baby, it will be alright.&#34; But could not. I recommend this movie, and the music CD. Glad when I worked the phones, I did not have to lie or pretend.
