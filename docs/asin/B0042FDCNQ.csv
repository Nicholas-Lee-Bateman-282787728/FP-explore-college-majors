However, Gingerdead Man 2 is a definite improvement, and is enough to make this double feature worth buying if you like cheesy b-movies.

In this case, a double feature!As a fan of the Puppet Master series, I pretty much knew what to expect and in that regard, I wasn't disappointed.  I will say I liked the second movie better than the first and as I was watching it, I ordered the third movie in this series.  My only complaint about the first movie is that it felt like a rough draft.  They really didn't have the right balance of horror to humor worked out.  The second feature though, got it perfectly; it's zany and sly and not a little nuts.  I can't wait to see the third installment.",4,"""Help, we've got homicidal bake goods after us!""",1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,643,"['Curiosity', 'got', 'better', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'killer', 'cookie', 'case', 'double', 'feature', 'fan', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'regard', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'will', 'say', 'liked', 'second', 'movie', 'better', 'first', 'was', 'watching', 'ordered', 'third', 'movie', 'series', 'My', 'only', 'first', 'movie', 'felt', 'rough', 'draft', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'balance', 'horror', 'humor', 'worked', 'out', 'second', 'feature', 'got', 'perfectly', 'zany', 'sly', 'not', 'little', 'nuts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'third', 'installment']",The Gingerdead Man / The Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust

The idea of Gary Busey turning into a gun wielding cookie tells you everything you need to know about it.The second one is nothing but salacious drivel. It lost all the campy goodness of the first one and didn't have the solid base of Gary Busey's voice to save it.
