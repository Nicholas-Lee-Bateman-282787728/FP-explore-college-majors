Trouble is David Jason is always watchable!The reason for this comment is to clear up a few misunderstandings. This isn't the last of Frost - a new series of 3 episodes is currently showing on UK TV:Season 14, Episode 1: Mind GamesOriginal Air Date--12 October 2008Season 14, Episode 2: Dead EndOriginal Air Date--19 October 2008Season 14, Episode 3: In the Public InterestOriginal Air Date--26 October 2008and is being released in the UK on DVD in late October.What is even stranger is that in the UK there is no season 13 at all! Endangered Species was first of all released on a single DVD but is listed (along with the earlier story ""Near Death Experience"" as season 12. Hence in the UK we have seasons 1-12, an extra disc also labelled series 12 and now series 14 is being released.I suspect in the US Endangered Species was released as season 13 to avoid a confusing gap (but then they just added to the confusion by having 2 seasons that were effectively single episodes!)",3,OK ... but ...,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,1083,"['OK', 'everyone', 'said', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'pretty', 'silly', 'episode', 'Trouble', 'David', 'Jason', 'always', 'watchable', 'reason', 'comment', 'clear', 'up', 'few', 'misunderstandings', ""n't"", 'last', 'Frost', 'new', 'series', '3', 'episodes', 'currently', 'showing', 'UK', 'TV', 'Season', '14', 'Episode', '1', 'Mind', 'GamesOriginal', 'Air', 'Date', '12', 'October', '2008Season', '14', 'Episode', '2', 'Dead', 'EndOriginal', 'Air', 'Date', '19', 'October', '2008Season', '14', 'Episode', '3', 'Public', 'InterestOriginal', 'Air', 'Date', '26', 'October', '2008and', 'being', 'released', 'UK', 'DVD', 'late', 'October.What', 'even', 'stranger', 'UK', 'season', '13', 'Endangered', 'Species', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'single', 'DVD', 'listed', 'earlier', 'story', 'Death', 'Experience', 'season', '12', 'Hence', 'UK', 'have', 'seasons', '1-12', 'extra', 'disc', 'also', 'labelled', 'series', '12', 'now', 'series', '14', 'being', 'released.I', 'suspect', 'US', 'Endangered', 'Species', 'was', 'released', 'season', '13', 'avoid', 'confusing', 'gap', 'then', 'just', 'added', 'confusion', 'having', '2', 'seasons', 'were', 'effectively', 'single', 'episodes']",A Touch of Frost Season 13: Endangered Species

It came on sale, so wanting to keep the series whole, I did purchase it.  I did not find it to be as bad as some of the other reviewers; in fact I did not find it to be bad at all.  Some of the other reviews I read had issues with him and a younger woman.  Well, sometime in life that happens.  David Jason himself had a daughter when he was in his 60's, so I assume his wife had to be a lot younger than he was in real life!  The show does not show him being intimate with this young actress anyway, so I don't understand the criticism.  As for the ""season"", I found it disappointing that it was only one episode.  As for the content, having watched documentaries on Endangered Species, whoever wrote the episode did their homework.  The smuggling of animals happens in just this way, at times.

I suspect lead actor, David Jason, has enough money that he does not want to work as much nowadays. But the episode maintains the series' high standards for plot and performances. My only criticism is the volume of the score. I have noticed that the musical score for British TV dramas is typically too loud and this episode of Inspector Frost commits that sin in spades. You will find yourself reaching for the remote to turn down the volume when the music plays over non-dialog scenes and then turning it up again when the dialog starts. Occasionally, the score overwhelms the dialog.
