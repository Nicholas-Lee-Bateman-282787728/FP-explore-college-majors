454372,A3CKPNSGA7JOLK,6305203725,"Bachelier ""&#34;1004&#34;""","[0, 0]","The Slums of Beverly Hills (SBH) is a refreshing coming-of-age tale from the perspective of a young woman on the brink of full physical development in the midst of an unstable family.The characters are lovable oddballs while writer-director Jenkins leavens the serious story with frequent moments of effective comedy.  Jenkins has admitted Slums of Beverly Hills contains lots of autobiographical material, and this is evident in the insight she brings to Vivian's experiences. The character's struggles with the pitfalls of adolescent development may be particular to women, but many of the emotional ramifications are familiar for boys who have now become men. Slums of Beverly Hills is an example of how engaging off-beat coming of age stories can be.Our guide through the Slums is Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne in an excellent performance). Vivian is a tough-talking girl with a guarded curiosity and uncertainty about her own sexuality and her developing body serves as a metaphor for her inner innocence and vulnerability. ""Vivian is stacked"" her older brother points out to their oblivious father, but while most girls would relish the extra attention and attractive power Vivian is not sure whether she wants the breasts (excellent and truthful insight). Her uncertain life also doesn't make it easy to deal with the effects of her hormones raging in her bloodstream.Vivian's father and mother are divorced, and she lives with her father Murray (Alan Arkin) and her two brothers. Vivian lacks a female role model or guide on her becoming (physically) a woman, until her stoned cousin, Rita (the always enchanting Marisa Tomei), comes to stay. Vivian is then on the fast track to learning about sex, but from a questionable model who engages in risky behavior.The Abramowitzes are nomads. Murry mysteriously lacks employment, ambition, or money, so they move from cheap apartment to cheap apartment, sometimes skipping out in the middle of the night to avoid paying rent. Murry's compensation to his children for this erratic behavior is to take them to Sizzler, a place he apparently adores and finds a value but the kids have had enough ove. Murry is oblivious to this. The Abramowitzes stay just within the city limits of Beverly Hills because of the quality of the schools. As Murray states, ""Furniture is temporary, education is forever.""When Rita comes to stay with them (running away from some indiscretion on the East Coast) her rich father (Carl Reiner) pays Murray enough so that he and his family can  move into a better place. With some temporary stability Vivian meets and falls for a gentle-but-nerdy neighbor, Eliot (Kevin Corrigan), who is fixated with Charles Manson and Vivian's chest, while Vivian tries to engage him in an emotional exchange.Slums of Beverly Hills is alternately funny and poignant, and it effectively expresses the various traumas of young womanhood. However, although Vivian is at the center of Jenkins' movie, the other characters are not mere sketches. Murray is particularly vivid, due to the contribution of veteran actor Arkin who balances with and pathos in the right amount of an otherwise straight performance. Murray is not the perfect father, but he loves his children and is trying to provide the best life he can for them. He is frightened of the future and of the approach of old age, and in one touching scene it dawns on Vivian that her father is vulnerable and his life prescribed.Slums of Beverly Hills combines comedy and drama in a natural and satisfying manner and covers a lot of territory without ever losing a sense of humor or its sense of character. The ending is a little weak, but that doesn't ruin an otherwise fine film.",4,a roman a clef,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,3699,"['Slums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'SBH', 'refreshing', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'perspective', 'young', 'woman', 'brink', 'full', 'physical', 'development', 'midst', 'unstable', 'family.The', 'characters', 'are', 'lovable', 'oddballs', 'writer-director', 'Jenkins', 'serious', 'story', 'frequent', 'moments', 'effective', 'comedy', 'Jenkins', 'admitted', 'Slums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'lots', 'autobiographical', 'material', 'evident', 'insight', 'Vivian', 'experiences', 'character', 'struggles', 'pitfalls', 'adolescent', 'development', 'may', 'be', 'particular', 'women', 'many', 'emotional', 'ramifications', 'are', 'familiar', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'men', 'Slums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'example', 'how', 'engaging', 'off-beat', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'can', 'be.Our', 'guide', 'Slums', 'Vivian', 'Abramowitz', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Vivian', 'tough-talking', 'girl', 'guarded', 'curiosity', 'uncertainty', 'own', 'sexuality', 'developing', 'body', 'metaphor', 'inner', 'innocence', 'vulnerability', 'Vivian', 'stacked', 'older', 'brother', 'points', 'out', 'oblivious', 'father', 'most', 'girls', 'would', 'relish', 'extra', 'attention', 'attractive', 'power', 'Vivian', 'not', 'sure', 'breasts', 'excellent', 'truthful', 'insight', 'uncertain', 'life', 'also', ""n't"", 'make', 'easy', 'deal', 'effects', 'hormones', 'raging', 'bloodstream.Vivian', 'father', 'mother', 'are', 'divorced', 'father', 'Murray', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'two', 'brothers', 'Vivian', 'female', 'role', 'model', 'guide', 'becoming', 'physically', 'woman', 'stoned', 'cousin', 'Rita', 'always', 'enchanting', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'stay', 'Vivian', 'then', 'fast', 'track', 'learning', 'sex', 'questionable', 'model', 'who', 'risky', 'behavior.The', 'Abramowitzes', 'are', 'nomads', 'Murry', 'mysteriously', 'employment', 'ambition', 'money', 'move', 'cheap', 'apartment', 'cheap', 'apartment', 'sometimes', 'skipping', 'out', 'middle', 'night', 'avoid', 'paying', 'rent', 'Murry', 'compensation', 'children', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'take', 'Sizzler', 'place', 'apparently', 'value', 'kids', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'ove', 'Murry', 'oblivious', 'Abramowitzes', 'stay', 'just', 'city', 'limits', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'quality', 'schools', 'Murray', 'Furniture', 'temporary', 'education', 'forever', 'When', 'Rita', 'stay', 'running', 'away', 'indiscretion', 'East', 'Coast', 'rich', 'father', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Murray', 'enough', 'so', 'family', 'can', 'move', 'better', 'place', 'temporary', 'stability', 'Vivian', 'meets', 'falls', 'gentle-but-nerdy', 'neighbor', 'Eliot', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'who', 'fixated', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'Vivian', 'chest', 'Vivian', 'tries', 'engage', 'emotional', 'exchange.Slums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'alternately', 'funny', 'poignant', 'effectively', 'various', 'traumas', 'young', 'womanhood', 'However', 'Vivian', 'center', 'Jenkins', 'movie', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'mere', 'sketches', 'Murray', 'particularly', 'vivid', 'due', 'contribution', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Arkin', 'who', 'pathos', 'right', 'amount', 'otherwise', 'straight', 'performance', 'Murray', 'not', 'perfect', 'father', 'children', 'trying', 'provide', 'best', 'life', 'can', 'frightened', 'future', 'approach', 'old', 'age', 'one', 'touching', 'scene', 'Vivian', 'father', 'vulnerable', 'life', 'prescribed.Slums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'comedy', 'drama', 'natural', 'satisfying', 'manner', 'lot', 'territory', 'ever', 'losing', 'sense', 'humor', 'sense', 'character', 'ending', 'little', 'weak', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'film']",Slums of Beverly Hills VHS

454375,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,6305203725,D. Mok,"[9, 10]","As endlessly hilarious as (though more wirily subtle than) Clerks, Slums of Beverly Hills succeeds in spades where so many other screwball comedies fail -- characterization.  Tamara Jenkins' wacked-out sensibility and wit  were already evident in her student shorts, but they always lacked  something more substantial than spunk and wit.  In Slums and its  feature-film length Jenkins finds the space necessary for her to flesh out  her gags with emotional content and real circumstances.Granted, she was  also lucky to have found Natasha Lyonne, the perfect voice for Jenkins'  dialogue and situations.  Spunk, sensitivity, wit and fighting spirit are  all part of what makes Lyonne's character Vivian so memorable.  From the  hilarious and weirdly expressive title sequence on (the staging of which is  reminiscent of the end credit sequence of Doris Doerrie's Men), Lyonne  captures the restless energies of her character as well as the feelings.  Alan Arkin plays with Lyonne marvelously to create a feisty yet charming  family dynamic.And then, of course, there are the gags.  Tampon  discussions under a table, dildo dances, sexual experimentation, a  Manson-head, beautifully rendered comic voice-over (as good as the last  great voice-over performance I can remember, Ray Liotta in GoodFellas) by  Lyonne, forks in legs, bras, gibberish...a laugh-fest that feels like it  ended too soon, when most comedies just make you wish they'd ended sooner.

454383,A1OBJ2263JCK5,6305203725,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[0, 1]","The ""Slums of Beverly Hills"" is one of those film comedies, that makes you laugh out loud, but on the inside you want to cry. The film takes place in the the '70's, a time of halter tops and snakeskin, platform sandals. We meet pubescent, developing, teenager, Vivian Abromowitz (an excellent Natasha Lyonne) and her family. They lead a nomadic existence going from one crummy apartment building to the next, one step ahead of various irate, landlords. They stay within the Beverly Hills zip code (the less well to do parts) for the sake of the good schools. The problem is that divorced, older father, Murray (a great Alan Arkin), just dosn't have the income to support his brood of kids. The kids seem to understand their predicament, but they only begrudgingly move around, trapped in this existence. A semi-salvation comes in the form of a desperate phone call from Murray's wealthy, brother, Mickey (Carl Reiner). It seems he dosn't know what to do with his wild, out-of-control, 29-year old daughter, Rita (Marisa Tomei). Murray volunteers to take on Rita, and get her straighten out, for a small, monthly stipend. Hopefully the money will nudge the family into middle class territory. We watch as Rita's behavior & counsel, both helps the family (especially Vivian), but also wrecks havoc on their lifestyle. Now, after reading this plot summary, one would not picture this as much of a comedy. But the film has a very sharp and funny script. The spit-fire dialogue almost reads like something out of a Neil Simon play. While we laugh with the characters (nothing beats the scene, where Vivian & Rita hilariously pass a humongus dildo back and forth, while dancing to the '70s funk hit ""Flashlight"") we also realize that they are in a tough situation. The entire cast to this movie is uniformly excellent. Natasha Lyonne is great playing Vivian, a teenager, who loves her family, yet is constantly being annoyed or embarassed by them. On top of that she is dealing with all the issues that come along with puberty and becoming a young women. Alan Arkin is wonderful as Murray, a father, who is trying to rationalize and make the best of his hopeless situation. David Krumholtz is really funny as the smart-a** son, Ben, who won't turn down a good toke of weed and loves musical theatre. Special mention should also be made for indie character actor, Kevin Corrigan's supporting role as Eliot, a Charles Manson obsessed, pot dealer, who has eyes for Vivian. Finally, veteran comedian, Carl Reiner has a small, but pivotol role as Uncle Mickey. Reiner's hilarious comic turn is very close (in temperment) to his old Alan Brady character from the classic ""Dick Van Dyke show"". The film's costumes (love Vivian's high, striped knee socks) and sets perfectly recreate a low rent '70s look. Rolfe Kent's original score has a certain humorus, hokey-pokey feeling, that is the perfect companion to the Abromowitz families' nomadic lifestyle. A very funny, yet sad movie.

At one point, one of the actresses says the problem is breasts. She was wrong, since breasts are the whole reason this movie exists.The two female stars in this flick -- Natasha Lyonne, who is badly cast as an incoming high school freshman but looks more like a 21-year-old -- and Marisa Tomei both use stand ins to show off their breasts in separate scenes. These surely weren't Lyonne's breasts, since she used those things some people call candy dishes to enhance her bustline for the film. It's a good bet a stand in did the partial nude scenes of Tomei, also.Aside from discussion (and regular appearance) of breasts, the movie revolves around a Beverly Hills family whose breadwinner (Alan Arkin) has no job and no money yet tries to maintain a Beverly Hills address so his three kids can attend school there. Not much happens with his two sons, one of whom is an aspiring actor.That's because the movie is almost completely dedicated to the sex and social lives of the two female stars. It's a funny movie that holds your attention for 90 minutes but isn't what it pretends to be -- a ""coming out"" film about a young girl with a burgeoning bustline and sexuality.This girl is about as young as Betty Crocker and about as innocent as the Beverly Hills madam.

In the last few years, we have seen a resurgence of independent films. This renewal was fueled in part by the success of Miramax Films, which has delivered such winners as The English Patient and Pulp Fiction, as well as two of this year's Oscar nominees for Best Picture, Shakespeare in Love and Life is Beautiful. Other studios have jumped on the bandwagon. As a result, audiences have more alternatives to standard big budget fare.Yes, Beverly Hills has an area which, by its standards, is very low-rent. Made up mainly of small, two story apartment building with names like Shangri La and Casa Grande, it has nothing in common with the rest of city, except for the zip code.It is in this area that Murray Abramovitz [Alan Arkin] and his children constantly move from place to place. Murray is always behind in his rent, but won't leave Beverly Hills because of its public school system.His daughter Vivian [Natasha Lyonne] is the main character. She must endure all the changes which are natural to a fifteen-year old, while coping with a nomadic lifestyle. They never stay in one place for more than three months. As a family, they are freaks, in Vivian's opinion. The situation gets even worse when her cousin Rita [Marisa Tomei], recently escaped from a drug rehab center, moves in. Rita's father is Murray's successful older brother, and it necessary for the family to pretend everything is fine with Rita because Murray is getting paid to keep her away from home.Slums of Beverly Hills is one of last year's quirkiest and poignant comedies. Vivian puts up with living in cramped quarters with his Dad and her two off-the-wall brothers. She deals with constantly moving around. She watches in both wonder and horror as her body transforms her from adolescent to young adult. She lives through wild escapades with her cousin, and her boyfriend is not quite sane.All of this takes place in the 1970s, and the viewer must take into account that attitudes towards sex and drugs were more liberal back then. Director Tamara Jenkins wisely choses to weave these elements into the story in a matter of fact way. She also succeeds in making the characters likable. Rather than seeming to be unsavory, they come off as being a group of eccentrics just trying to make their way through this life.The acting is uniformly good. These new independent movies are acting as career builders for young actors, much like television shows do. Lyonne had no less than six movie assignments in 1999. It is always good to see Alan Arkin, who has been making movies for over thirty years. Marisa Tomei, who never achieved star status, despite her Oscar for My Cousin Vinnie, continues to create memorable characters in small films such as this one.",3,Eccentric little comedy,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2829,"['Slums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'was', 'produced', '20th', 'Century-Fox', 'small', 'film', 'division', 'Fox', 'Searchlight', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'resurgence', 'independent', 'films', 'renewal', 'was', 'fueled', 'part', 'success', 'Miramax', 'Films', 'delivered', 'such', 'winners', 'English', 'Patient', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'year', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'Other', 'studios', 'have', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', 'result', 'audiences', 'have', 'more', 'alternatives', 'standard', 'big', 'budget', 'fare.Yes', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'area', 'standards', 'very', 'low-rent', 'Made', 'up', 'mainly', 'small', 'two', 'story', 'apartment', 'building', 'names', 'Shangri', 'La', 'Casa', 'Grande', 'nothing', 'common', 'rest', 'city', 'zip', 'code.It', 'area', 'Murray', 'Abramovitz', '[', 'Alan', 'Arkin', ']', 'children', 'constantly', 'move', 'place', 'place', 'Murray', 'always', 'rent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'public', 'school', 'system.His', 'daughter', 'Vivian', '[', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', ']', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'endure', 'changes', 'are', 'natural', 'fifteen-year', 'old', 'coping', 'nomadic', 'lifestyle', 'never', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'more', 'three', 'months', 'family', 'are', 'freaks', 'Vivian', 'opinion', 'situation', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'cousin', 'Rita', '[', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', ']', 'recently', 'escaped', 'drug', 'rehab', 'center', 'moves', 'Rita', 'father', 'Murray', 'successful', 'older', 'brother', 'necessary', 'family', 'pretend', 'everything', 'fine', 'Rita', 'Murray', 'getting', 'paid', 'keep', 'away', 'home.Slums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'one', 'last', 'year', 'quirkiest', 'poignant', 'comedies', 'Vivian', 'up', 'living', 'cramped', 'quarters', 'Dad', 'two', 'off-the-wall', 'brothers', 'constantly', 'moving', 'around', 'wonder', 'horror', 'body', 'adolescent', 'young', 'adult', 'wild', 'escapades', 'cousin', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'quite', 'sane.All', 'place', '1970s', 'viewer', 'must', 'take', 'account', 'towards', 'sex', 'drugs', 'were', 'more', 'liberal', 'back', 'then', 'Director', 'Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'wisely', 'weave', 'elements', 'story', 'matter', 'fact', 'way', 'also', 'making', 'characters', 'likable', 'Rather', 'seeming', 'be', 'unsavory', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'group', 'eccentrics', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'life.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'new', 'independent', 'movies', 'are', 'acting', 'career', 'builders', 'young', 'actors', 'much', 'television', 'shows', 'do', 'Lyonne', 'had', 'less', 'six', 'movie', 'assignments', '1999', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'movies', 'thirty', 'years', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'never', 'achieved', 'star', 'status', 'Oscar', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinnie', 'create', 'memorable', 'characters', 'small', 'films', 'such', 'one']",Slums of Beverly Hills VHS

At any rate, if there's a reason to applaud this critically acclaimed indie, it's the performance of Natasha Lyonne in the focal role of Vivian.Lyonne captures to a tee the ultimately frightening world of being a teenager on the verge of becoming a woman.  Lyonne hits all the right notes, whether it's in lamenting her enormous boobs (a gag that gets old after a while) or exploring her cousin's vibrator (a remarkable scene with no dialogue that conveys the innocence of youth and shows what a fine actress Lyonne is).  Alan Arkin lends good support as her father, but his performance is too one note to show us the real anguish he is feeling.  His scene with Oscar winner Marisa Tomei in which he tells her how lonely he is is handled very well.  Jessica Walter is around briefly as the new love interest in Arkin's life, and she does a beautiful job too.  Tomei is adequate, but not entirely believable.

454390,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6305203725,Mike Stone,"[16, 18]","In a perfect world, ""Slums of Beverly Hills"" would have been a zeitgeist-defining hit.  People would run around asking each other to ""bring me my bong"".  Everyone would be talking about the dancing vibrator scene.  Alan Arkin would have a second career, playing tough-minded, sensible, and loving fathers.  Kevin Corrigan would pop up from time to time in mainstream films as the wise but whacked teenager.  And Natasha Lyonne would rightfully take her place as the `it' girl.  Sadly, and inexplicably, none of these things has happened.I ask myself why this hasn't happened?  The best I can come up with is this: this coming-of-age story focuses on the girl.  Simple as that.  We are used to seeing teenage boys going through adolescent discovery, but for some reason watching a teenage girl do it is less appealing.  Writer/Director Tamara Jenkins has admitted that much of the story is (semi-) autobiographical, which is a scary thought for the audience looking on.  She faithfully sets up mid-70's California, from the tacky architecture, to the overdone interior design, to the clothing and the music.  Her script is low-key but terribly intelligent, even if her characters aren't supposed to be.  There isn't much to push the narrative along, but Jenkins gets a lot of mileage out of her episodic structure.&quot;Slums&quot; details one girl's summer of self-discover, of both the body that was thrust upon her, and the family that she's come to understand.  A weaker person than protagonist Vivian Abromowitz would have crumbled under the weight of the issues she's confronted with (e.g., a rapidly budding bustline, a disruptive menstrual cycle, an embarrassing sex-toy education, an aggressive prospective boyfriend, etc.).  But she's too strong and needed too much by her family to give in to her petty adolescent issues.  Lyonne imbues Vivian with heaps of frustrations, tonnes of patience, a wild curiosity, and loads of charisma.  She is an atypically intelligent actress, which only shows in fits and spurts, the better to detail the intelligence Vivian will have as a woman when she's done being a little girl.  It's a truly wonderful, strong performance.It had better be, for she is confronted in most of her scenes by veteran character actor Arkin (Yossarian!).  I've always loved Arkin's unique delivery, with its faux-monotone and odd vocal rhythms (a uniqueness that marks all great character actors).  He's usually called on to create caricatures, though, which is a damn shame, because here he's created a fully formed character.  And it's perfect!  Poppa Murray Abromowitz loves his kids to death, and is willing to sacrifice any semblance of success in order to give them a good education (the film's basic conceit is that Murray repeatedly moves his family in the middle of the night in order to avoid the rent he can't afford in Beverly Hills, which has a desirable school system).  He appears perfect on the surface -- he loves his kids and is willing to do anything for them -- but is far from a perfect man.  He has a dangerous predilection for the ponies, which is the crux of his financial issues.  He's under the thumb of his well-to-do brother (Carl Reiner), and is willing to subjugate himself for some of Mickey's money.  And in one uncomfortable scene (which I am loathe to give away, although many here have already criticized it), he proves his fallibility without question.  True, the way the scene is set up is terribly manipulative (Vivian fortuitously sees something she shouldn't) but it does shed some light on Murray's humanity, for better or worse.The rest of the cast, for the most part, is remarkable.  David Krumholtz, as Vivian's pot-head and theatre obsessed older brother, is a very interesting actor to watch.  He has no inhibitions whatsoever (in one sequence he's dressed in nothing but saggy briefs, his love handles bulging out, belting out a rousing rendition of &quot;Luck be a Lady&quot;).  Corrigan does fine, low-key work as the pot-selling, Charles Manson obsessed, new next door neighbour who's more than willing to lead Abromowitz down the path into womanhood.  And Rita Moreno is great as Mickey's domineering wife.  Marisa Tomei for the most part does okay, but overall is less than successful.  She's fine in her scenes with Lyonne, as she tries desperately to be the mother figure the younger girl doesn't have (the aforementioned vibrator scene is a good example of this).  But she also has to play a diet pill-popping flake.  In this respect, she goes a little overboard, playing Rita as a broad character sketch, rather than a character.That being said, Tomei does fit in well with the rest of the cast.  Which is the real reason to watch the movie.  It's nothing more than a finely drawn series of character studies.  Watching these people interact, and learn from each other, and laugh with each other is entertainment enough for me, and the reason why I'll always recommend the criminally underappreciated

454392,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305203725,Reviewer,"[30, 31]","For a long time, the depiction of the family unit in movies and on television was for the most part a sanitized, idealized representation, from movies like the Mickey Rooney ""Andy Hardy"" series and William Powell's ""Life With Father,"" to the totally stereotypical versions presented on TV in such shows as ""Ozzie and Harriet"" and ""Father Knows Best,"" which were entertaining, perhaps, but set standards that in reality were simply unattainable; a reflection of real life these movies/shows were not.  There was the occasional film like ""Rebel Without A Cause"" or ""The Young Savages,"" which certainly explored conflicted individuals, but the focus was not on the ""family unit"" per se.  Then gradually, all of that began to change; filmmakers evolved and the screen did begin to more accurately reflect the family dynamic in very real terms, for better or worse, and in 1998, ""Slums of Beverly Hills,"" written and directed by Tamara Jenkins hit the screen, with a depiction of the family unit that's about as honest as it gets.Murray Abromowitz (Alan Arkin) is 65 years old, divorced and raising three kids on his own.  A car salesman, Murray is currently in a ""slump.""  In point of fact, however, his whole life has been one long slump.  But he's determined that his children, Ben (David Krumholtz), Vivian (Natasha Lyonne) and Rickey (Eli Marienthal), are going to get a good education, and that means keeping them in the best schools.  And that means living in Beverly Hills.  It's one of the most ""upscale"" communities in the world, but he doesn't have to be rich to take advantage of the educational opportunities; as long as they live within the city limits, the kids stay enrolled.  It's all a matter of having the right zip code.  But there's the rub; it's just not as easy as it sounds, because even living on the periphery of Beverly Hills cannot be successfully effected without ""means,"" and ""assets"" of any kind are decidedly not a part of Murray's personal resume.Which means there has to be a plan.  And Murray's plan is very simple:  You stay one step ahead of the landlord and the monthly rent and you're home free.  Which means moving.  A lot.  As in slipping out in the middle of the night with only as much as you can carry and moving on to the next ""dingbat"" apartment.  And so is goes with the Abromowitz family, living a nomadic existence as part of a very real sub-culture in one of the richest areas on the planet.  It's hard, but the kids are getting the education.  Murray, however, suddenly has something else to deal with:  Vivian, who is about to enter her freshman year at high school.  And she is not a ""little"" girl anymore.To tell her semi-autobiographical story, writer/director Jenkins has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engrossing film steeped in nuance and gritty realism.  It's an incisive portrait of how a dysfunctional family can survive by establishing parameters which allow them to get from point A to point B on a daily basis, and what it takes to maintain the kind of internal support system that enables them to function and stay together, though individually their goals and aspirations may be pulling them in opposite directions.  it goes far in disproving the idea that a family in perpetual crisis must necessarily disintegrate.The story is told through the eyes of Vivian, which gives the film a decidedly personal resonance, as it is obvious that this is where Jenkins' heart resides.  And it presents a mature perspective that effectively dispels the stereotypical characterization of the self-absorbed teen mired in the throes of paralyzing angst, which adds considerable credibility to this character driven comedy/drama.  Jenkins also successfully captures an entirely genuine ""sense"" of the whole Abromowitz's environment; the look, texture and ""feel"" of the film is a reflection of reality, so much so that you can almost actually detect the scent of the apartments, the steaks cooking at Sizzler or that familiar clean/warm smell of the laundry room.  An exceptionally insightful film, it sheds some light on the invisible threads that hold us together and keep the myriad facets of our society connected.What really brings this one to life, though, is the performances Jenkins exacts from her exceptional cast of actors, beginning with Lyonne, who so perfectly embodies the character of Vivian.  This is the pivotal part of the film, and with her ""natural"" presence Lyonne delivers a convincing portrayal through which she precisely conveys exactly what she's thinking and feeling with a combination of facial expressions, body language and simply the inflection of her voice.As Murray, Arkin gives an extremely affecting and introspective performance, creating a character with whom many in the audience are going to be able to relate and identify on one level or another, as he taps into that sense of not quite being able to figure out how it all works, even after doing it day after day for sixty-five years.  In Murray we see a very accurate reflection of the on-going process of sorting out ""life""-- a process that, in reality, never ends.  It's a performance that takes into account the inherent flaws of being human; it makes us realize that none of us are perfect, but that it's okay-- we just have to keep trying.One of the finest character actors in the business, indy favorite Kevin Corrigan turns in an effective, understated and unassuming performance as Eliot, the guy with whom Vivian has a ""building thing"" relationship.Also giving a memorable performance is Marisa Tomei, as Murray's niece, Rita, who is deliciously tacky and adds some real spice to the film.  Her portrayal is earthy and utterly believable, and like Arkin's Murray, is an honest reflection of how most people grapple with the uncertainties of life.""Slums of Beverly Hills"" is a viable exploration of the human condition; a film that helps us understand who we are, and why.",5,"An Honest Depiction of A ""Family Unit""",1038009600,"11 23, 2002",2002,5922,"['long', 'time', 'depiction',

454393,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6305203725,Richard Ross,"[1, 3]","Vivian (Natasha Lyonne) has two growing problems: her new found breasts and the unwanted attention that brings from boys and her crazy father Mel (Alan Arkin) continually moving Vivian and her two brothers from cheap motel to cheap motel in the middle of the night. To make matters worse  her pill popping aunt Rita (Marisa Tomei) has just escaped from her latest stint at rehab and Mel is letting her live with the family so that he can continue to receive handouts from his rich brother, Rita's father. Rita introduces Vivian to the joys of sex by giving her her first vibrator and offering advice on the best bra to accentuate her growing breasts. Vivian's bust immediately catches the attention of her new neighbor (Kevin Corrigan) who is obsessed with Charles Manson but who  makes room for Vivian as his new obsession. The film has some funny moments but the set up for the jokes takes way too long and often the payoff is not worth it. The best moments come from Corrigan and David Krumholtz who plays Vivian's pot head brother. He is auditioning for a role in the stage production of Guys and Dolls. He is hoping to land the role of Sky Masterson which Marlon Brando played in the film version. The funniest scene in the film involves him singing Luck Be A Lady after taking a massive bong hit since he believes that the marijuana will relax his vocal chords. Jessica Walter from Arrested Development is also good in her couple of scenes as the new woman in Mel's life whom he is trying to convince that his family is normal. Lyonne makes for a good heroine in Vivian and this is one of the actress's few starring roles but the film isn't as good as she is. Tomei does a fun job of playing the drugged out crazy aunt who is  pregnant by a man that she met in rehab.  Tomei and Lyonne have a good rapport between the two of them and their scenes are enjoyable whenever they are not speaking in their made up language.  The performances are all better than the film itself and there are some funny moments but overall it's kinda pointless and dumb.",2,Amusing but not much else,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,2054,"['Vivian', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'two', 'growing', 'problems', 'new', 'found', 'breasts', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'boys', 'crazy', 'father', 'Mel', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'continually', 'moving', 'Vivian', 'two', 'brothers', 'cheap', 'motel', 'cheap', 'motel', 'middle', 'night', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'pill', 'popping', 'aunt', 'Rita', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'just', 'escaped', 'latest', 'stint', 'rehab', 'Mel', 'letting', 'live', 'family', 'so', 'can', 'continue', 'receive', 'handouts', 'rich', 'brother', 'Rita', 'father', 'Rita', 'Vivian', 'joys', 'sex', 'giving', 'first', 'vibrator', 'offering', 'advice', 'best', 'bra', 'accentuate', 'growing', 'breasts', 'Vivian', 'bust', 'immediately', 'attention', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'who', 'obsessed', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'who', 'room', 'Vivian', 'new', 'obsession', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'set', 'up', 'jokes', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'often', 'payoff', 'not', 'worth', 'best', 'moments', 'come', 'Corrigan', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'who', 'Vivian', 'pot', 'head', 'brother', 'auditioning', 'role', 'stage', 'production', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'hoping', 'land', 'role', 'Sky', 'Masterson', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'played', 'film', 'version', 'funniest', 'scene', 'film', 'singing', 'Luck', 'Be', 'A', 'Lady', 'taking', 'massive', 'bong', 'hit', 'marijuana', 'will', 'relax', 'vocal', 'chords', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'also', 'good', 'couple', 'scenes', 'new', 'woman', 'Mel', 'life', 'whom', 'trying', 'convince', 'family', 'normal', 'Lyonne', 'good', 'heroine', 'Vivian', 'one', 'actress', 'few', 'starring', 'roles', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Tomei', 'fun', 'job', 'playing', 'drugged', 'out', 'crazy', 'aunt', 'who', 'pregnant', 'man', 'met', 'rehab', 'Tomei', 'Lyonne', 'have', 'good', 'rapport', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'not', 'speaking', 'made', 'up', 'language', 'performances', 'are', 'better', 'film', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'overall', 'kinda', 'pointless', 'dumb']",Slums of Beverly Hills VHS
