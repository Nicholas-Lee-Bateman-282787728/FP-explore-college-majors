Iam grateful that someone took the time to preserve these shorts and make them available for sale to the public. However, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because.it was not put ona professional DVD like you buy in a retail store.Also, after seeing some one else's review I did realize it dosn't have the MGM music in the beginning. Either they thought it was a waste of time leaving it in each episode or they didn't want to pay for the rights to leave it in. Which is disappointing, but that's ok I still enjoy laughingthrough each episode and remembering it from my child hood.

1411328,A260GVQ1KZ2V6V,B004J5RMO4,"John Malanga ""film guy""","[27, 30]","This review refers the DVD of The Little Rascals Collector's Edition which wasreleased by ATI in 2009 (87 episodes on 11 dvds). I purchased this collection strictly based on the very positive reviews here on amazon.comMy experience was one of disappointment. I can live with the fact that they are not in chronological order, but the MGM logo has been removed from every short thus the music begins abruptly. As one short ends, the next one begins with not so much as a few seconds in between. The opening title is missing on the short entitled Bed Time Worries. The picture quality varies from short to short. The contrast is decent for the most part, but there is no sharpness to most of them - the focus is on the soft side. However, my biggest complaint is with the sound on many of these shorts: there are plenty of snaps, crackles and pops and surface noises to distract from one's enjoyment. A couple of shorts have no sound at all for the first 20 seconds or more.I have tried to be as fair as possible in this review, but if I were their teacher, I could only give a C+ to these Little Rascals mainly because of the very reasonable price and the number of shorts included. Perhaps I expected too much after having read the glowing reviews. I was hoping for the superior quality of the beautiful Laurel And Hardy Essential Collection (released by RHI 2011), which I highly recommend.I haven't seen them all, but I think the picture quality and sound are betteron the Little Rascals: The Complete Collection (2008).",2,Buyer Beware!,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,1522,"['review', 'DVD', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'wasreleased', 'ATI', '2009', '87', 'episodes', '11', 'dvds', 'purchased', 'collection', 'strictly', 'based', 'very', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon.comMy', 'experience', 'was', 'one', 'disappointment', 'can', 'live', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'chronological', 'order', 'MGM', 'logo', 'been', 'removed', 'short', 'thus', 'music', 'abruptly', 'one', 'short', 'next', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'few', 'seconds', 'opening', 'title', 'missing', 'short', 'entitled', 'Bed', 'Time', 'Worries', 'picture', 'quality', 'varies', 'short', 'short', 'contrast', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'sharpness', 'most', 'focus', 'soft', 'side', 'However', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'sound', 'many', 'shorts', 'are', 'plenty', 'snaps', 'crackles', 'pops', 'surface', 'noises', 'distract', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'couple', 'shorts', 'have', 'sound', 'first', '20', 'seconds', 'more.I', 'have', 'tried', 'be', 'as', 'fair', 'possible', 'review', 'were', 'teacher', 'could', 'only', 'give', 'C+', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'mainly', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'number', 'shorts', 'included', 'Perhaps', 'expected', 'too', 'much', 'having', 'read', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'was', 'hoping', 'superior', 'quality', 'beautiful', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Essential', 'Collection', 'released', 'RHI', '2011', 'highly', 'recommend.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'think', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Complete', 'Collection', '2008']",The Little Rascals-11 DVD Set-87 Episodes-With Menus-IN RICH BLACK AND WHITE

1411330,A16ISYMCYGT0NB,B004J5RMO4,"Skullywag ""Skully""","[10, 11]","There are many, many, many Little Rascals DVD sets out there,but you have to be careful of which you choose. Many less and more expensive sets have some episodes that are almost unwatchable (low sound, blurry picture) and some have earlier silent episodes sprinkled through...and believe me, the silents don't have the same charm as the MGM talkies.....in fact some are just plain awful.If you are not lucky enough (or rich enough now)to own the Cabin Fever set...THIS is the one to buy. About 75% of the collection disc sets out there are DVD-R sets, not factory pressed discs... this is one such set, but is forgivable because the content is head and shoulders above so many of the rest. These are as good of copies of the original episodes as they get. I have purchased 3 other Little Rascals sets from that auction site for various amounts, but was still looking for a ""GOOD"" set until purchasing this one. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT waste your money on more expensive sets unless it is a Cabin Fever set.....you'll be sorry. Concidering the quality of other sets I have bought, this one has an amazingly low price for the quality.My ONLY gripe holds true with every other set out there...the episode order...there is none. I would LOVE to find a set that had each short in the order it appeared, but sadly I don't think such a set exists. Episodes flip-flop back and forth through the years like a broken time machine.  If I ever get around to it some day, I'm going to rip, and remaster these discs in correct episode order.",5,Great bang for the buck,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,1533,"['are', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'DVD', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'choose', 'Many', 'less', 'more', 'expensive', 'sets', 'have', 'episodes', 'are', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'low', 'sound', 'blurry', 'picture', 'have', 'earlier', 'silent', 'episodes', 'sprinkled', 'believe', 'silents', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'charm', 'MGM', 'talkies', '..in', 'fact', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'are', 'not', 'lucky', 'enough', 'rich', 'enough', 'now', 'own', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'set', 'THIS', 'one', 'buy', '75', '%', 'collection', 'disc', 'out', 'are', 'DVD-R', 'sets', 'not', 'factory', 'pressed', 'discs', 'one', 'such', 'set', 'forgivable', 'content', 'head', 'shoulders', 'so', 'many', 'rest', 'are', 'good', 'copies', 'original', 'episodes', 'get', 'have', 'purchased', '3', 'other', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'sets', 'auction', 'site', 'various', 'amounts', 'was', 'still', 'looking', 'GOOD', 'set', 'purchasing', 'one', 'PLEASE', 'PLEASE', 'PLEASE', 'DO', 'NOT', 'waste', 'money', 'more', 'expensive', 'sets', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'set', '..you', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorry', 'Concidering', 'quality', 'other', 'sets', 'have', 'bought', 'one', 'amazingly', 'low', 'price', 'quality.My', 'ONLY', 'gripe', 'true', 'other', 'set', 'out', 'episode', 'order', 'none', 'would', 'LOVE', 'find', 'set', 'had', 'short', 'order', 'appeared', 'sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'such', 'set', 'Episodes', 'flip-flop', 'back', 'forth', 'years', 'broken', 'time', 'machine', 'ever', 'get', 'day', ""'m"", 'going', 'rip', 'remaster', 'discs', 'correct', 'episode', 'order']",The Little Rascals-11 DVD Set-87 Episodes-With Menus-IN RICH BLACK AND WHITE

I knew the video quality would not be great, but I was actually surprised that it was not as bad as I thought it would be.  I grew up with the Little Rascals and finding them on DVD was a dream come true. What I don't understand is that all film was actually ""filmed"" on film back then so there should be no degradation in quality, like you get from copying VHS over and over.  I suppose the original, or even copies have long been lost or hidden away for what ever reason so we have to either rely on video tape or recordings from a TV broadcast.
