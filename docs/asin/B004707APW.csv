1388007,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B004707APW,Allan M. Lees,"[2, 3]","While Hollywood spends billions turning out trash, low-budget films from the rest of the world address matters of importance. Illegal is such a film, and benefits from sure direction and assured acting. Tania is Russian, living illegally in Belgium, trying to keep below the radar while she struggles to create a better life for her son Ivan. Unfortunately Ivan is, like most children, unable to imagine a world beyond his narrow vision and consequently doesn't understand his mother's insistance on speaking French in order to keep a low profile. His determined use of Russian leads to his mother's arrest and incarceration in a Belgian detention center. Most of the movie is concerned with what happens here - the good and the bad.This is an unashamed polemic, aimed at ensuring we don't gloss over the human cost of bureaucratic immigration policies. In the end, the wealthy and comfortable citizens of the West complacently ignore the plight of those less fortunate. In the USA the stance is even more hypocritical than normal because American agriculture depends on illigal migrant workers; in Belgium it's merely a question of maintaining EU rules that like all immigration policy basically discriminate on the basis of chance. If you happen to be lucky enough to be born in the West you get a nice life; if you're born elsewhere, hard luck.But that luck really is hard, and the virtue of this film is that it enables us to see the lengths to which courageous individuals will go in order to try for a better life. Ironically, it's the people with the drive to make the attempt who suffer the consequences - yet these are precisely the courageous and driven types we need to maintain the vigor of our societies.At any rate, whatever your stance on immigration, this is a film worth watching because it humanizes what is too often a comfortably abstract issue. And it forces us to engage with individuals rather than the empty posturing of over-fed politicians and bloated bigots, to empathize rather than condemn. In short, while the 200+ movies per year spewing out of Hollywood are pretty much all forgettable trash, this is a movie that is worth every Euro it cost to make and should be seen far more widely than next week's transient meaningless block-buster.",5,A Movie of Importance,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2269,"['Hollywood', 'spends', 'billions', 'turning', 'out', 'trash', 'low-budget', 'films', 'rest', 'world', 'address', 'matters', 'importance', 'Illegal', 'such', 'film', 'benefits', 'sure', 'direction', 'assured', 'acting', 'Tania', 'Russian', 'living', 'illegally', 'Belgium', 'trying', 'keep', 'radar', 'create', 'better', 'life', 'son', 'Ivan', 'Unfortunately', 'Ivan', 'most', 'children', 'unable', 'imagine', 'world', 'narrow', 'vision', 'consequently', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mother', 'insistance', 'speaking', 'French', 'order', 'keep', 'low', 'profile', 'determined', 'use', 'Russian', 'leads', 'mother', 'arrest', 'incarceration', 'Belgian', 'detention', 'center', 'Most', 'movie', 'concerned', 'what', 'here', 'good', 'bad.This', 'unashamed', 'polemic', 'aimed', 'ensuring', 'do', ""n't"", 'gloss', 'human', 'cost', 'bureaucratic', 'immigration', 'policies', 'end', 'wealthy', 'comfortable', 'citizens', 'West', 'complacently', 'ignore', 'plight', 'less', 'fortunate', 'USA', 'stance', 'even', 'more', 'hypocritical', 'normal', 'American', 'agriculture', 'illigal', 'migrant', 'workers', 'Belgium', 'merely', 'question', 'maintaining', 'EU', 'rules', 'like', 'immigration', 'policy', 'basically', 'discriminate', 'basis', 'chance', 'happen', 'be', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'born', 'West', 'get', 'nice', 'life', ""'re"", 'born', 'elsewhere', 'hard', 'luck.But', 'really', 'hard', 'virtue', 'film', 'see', 'lengths', 'courageous', 'individuals', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'try', 'better', 'life', 'Ironically', 'people', 'drive', 'make', 'attempt', 'who', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'yet', 'are', 'precisely', 'courageous', 'driven', 'types', 'need', 'maintain', 'vigor', 'societies.At', 'rate', 'stance', 'immigration', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'what', 'too', 'often', 'comfortably', 'abstract', 'issue', 'engage', 'individuals', 'rather', 'empty', 'posturing', 'over-fed', 'politicians', 'bloated', 'bigots', 'empathize', 'rather', 'condemn', 'short', '200+', 'movies', 'year', 'spewing', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgettable', 'trash', 'movie', 'worth', 'Euro', 'cost', 'make', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'far', 'more', 'widely', 'next', 'week', 'transient', 'meaningless', 'block-buster']",N/A
1388008,A3GGT3AQMGDTH2,B004707APW,"A. S. W. ""Adam Soch""","[0, 1]","In real life, not in this delicate and highly emotional film, is less talk or debate about the core problem of migration or why do people want to settle far away from their homeland? Who in the right mind wants to leave family, friends, home, culture and language behind? We know, millions do, but why and who is at fault? The answer is simple: Corrupt Governments.  But the film ILLEGAL is not a political drama at all, it is a strong, emotional tale about a mother and her struggle to make sure her young son will be all right and grow up in freedom to become a decent person.  The price is way to high but like any respectable and caring mother the sky is the limit, Tania would go to any length to protect her family's well being.  From beginning to end this fine Belgian film will keep your emotions high and often will make you angry, it made me wanting to get involved and do something for her, but soon I realized, I am watching an extraordinary film and I am useless, except feel for the brave mother.  Watching Illegal, Milos Foreman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and Alejandro I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's ""Biutiful"" comes to mind for they both deal with the human condition, the struggle to be alive and make it into the world.This is the second feature film for the talented Belgian writer/director Olivier Masset-Depasse who worked with the equally talented and beautiful actress Anne Coesens in both his feature films.  Anne's screen presence is as dramatic as it is magical, her acting control and evenness is compelling.  I hope you will LOVE this film as much as I do, not only for the subject matters, one of them being migration, that it is controversial and not easy to digest for many natives, but also for the extraordinary script, direction, acting and editing.",5,"It should ""move"" America and the World!",1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1787,"['real', 'life', 'not', 'delicate', 'highly', 'emotional', 'film', 'less', 'talk', 'debate', 'core', 'problem', 'migration', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'want', 'settle', 'far', 'away', 'homeland', 'Who', 'right', 'mind', 'leave', 'family', 'friends', 'home', 'culture', 'language', 'behind', 'know', 'millions', 'do', 'why', 'who', 'fault', 'answer', 'simple', 'Corrupt', 'Governments', 'film', 'ILLEGAL', 'not', 'political', 'drama', 'strong', 'emotional', 'tale', 'mother', 'struggle', 'make', 'sure', 'young', 'son', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'grow', 'up', 'freedom', 'become', 'decent', 'person', 'price', 'way', 'high', 'respectable', 'caring', 'sky', 'limit', 'Tania', 'would', 'go', 'length', 'protect', 'family', 'well', 'being', 'beginning', 'end', 'fine', 'Belgian', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'emotions', 'high', 'often', 'will', 'make', 'angry', 'made', 'wanting', 'get', 'involved', 'do', 'something', 'soon', 'realized', 'am', 'watching', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'am', 'useless', 'feel', 'brave', 'mother', 'Watching', 'Illegal', 'Milos', 'Foreman', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Alejandro', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Biutiful', 'mind', 'deal', 'human', 'condition', 'struggle', 'be', 'alive', 'make', 'world.This', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'talented', 'Belgian', 'writer/director', 'Olivier', 'Masset-Depasse', 'who', 'worked', 'equally', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Coesens', 'feature', 'films', 'Anne', 'screen', 'presence', 'as', 'dramatic', 'magical', 'acting', 'control', 'evenness', 'compelling', 'hope', 'will', 'LOVE', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'subject', 'matters', 'one', 'being', 'migration', 'controversial', 'not', 'easy', 'digest', 'many', 'natives', 'also', 'extraordinary', 'script', 'direction', 'acting', 'editing']",N/A

""Daniel""","[0, 1]","What's interesting to observe in this film is the way the director manages, with a subjective point of view, to transform a documentary into a fiction.

1388010,A3UM5IR9AZL1WZ,B004707APW,"David Crumm ""Editor of ReadTheSpirit magazine""","[1, 2]","Film critics were divided in reviewing ""Illegal,"" made in Belgium and now brought to us by Film Movement, but I'm giving ""Illegal"" 5 stars. So, let me explain: As a journalist, I've read the whole range of reviews in newspapers and magazines--and first of all this film did, indeed, attract a high level of serious critical attention. That also means critics evaluated the film primarily as a movie-going experience. Those who were critical of the film wrote about the harsh experience of watching this single mother caught up in one of Europe's more Kafkaesque detention systems. This certainly isn't a movie for an evening of popcorn and laughter. It's also true that while it can be called Kafkaesque, it might also be called Disney-esque for the sweet sincerity of this mother's love for her son. Whatever the legal system throws at her, she is aimed like a heat-seeking missile at re-uniting with her son by the final scene. (And, no, that doesn't spoil the film because you still have no idea what strange twists and turns will lead you to that ending you can envision the moment the movie begins.)I'm giving this film 5 stars because I've covered years of hot-button debates across the U.S. about immigration policy. I'm not taking sides here on political policies--and neither does this film, in the end. But the debate usually dehumanizes the ""illegals"" to the point that these individuals--in many cases women and children--become two-dimensional cartoons. We no longer see the humanity behind the issue. As a specialist in covering religious issues around the world, I know that one of the great moral choruses on immigration are religious leaders, especially the Catholic church. Throughout his life, Pope John Paul II especially emphasized the human dignity of each person--and the need for compassion in relating to the many groups of people desperately hoping to migrate in our world.That's the value of this movie: compassion and a vision of human dignity. Our hearts go out to this poor mother from eastern Europe who simply wants to raise her son in a corner of the world where he has a chance to make a better life for himself. Instead, she is victimized from several different directions. For most of the film, we follow her through the despair, the dehumanization and ultimately the violence of an immigrant-detention system. At one point, the mother cries out at one of her guards: ""Do you want to know if I have suffered enough to stay in your country?""You'll think about illegal immigration differently after this film. And, it's a great choice to spark discussion with friends. On those grounds, definitely 5 stars.",5,Put some human faces on the political issue of illegal immigration,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,2640,"['critics', 'were', 'divided', 'reviewing', 'Illegal', 'made', 'Belgium', 'now', 'brought', 'Film', 'Movement', ""'m"", 'giving', 'Illegal', '5', 'stars', 'So', 'let', 'explain', 'journalist', ""'ve"", 'read', 'whole', 'range', 'reviews', 'newspapers', 'magazines', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'indeed', 'attract', 'high', 'level', 'serious', 'critical', 'attention', 'also', 'critics', 'evaluated', 'film', 'primarily', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'who', 'were', 'critical', 'film', 'wrote', 'harsh', 'experience', 'watching', 'single', 'mother', 'caught', 'up', 'one', 'Europe', 'more', 'Kafkaesque', 'detention', 'systems', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'movie', 'evening', 'popcorn', 'laughter', 'also', 'true', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'Kafkaesque', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'called', 'Disney-esque', 'sweet', 'sincerity', 'mother', 'love', 'son', 'legal', 'system', 'aimed', 'heat-seeking', 'missile', 're-uniting', 'son', 'final', 'scene', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'film', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'strange', 'twists', 'turns', 'will', 'lead', 'ending', 'can', 'envision', 'moment', 'movie', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', '5', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'covered', 'years', 'hot-button', 'debates', 'U.S.', 'immigration', 'policy', ""'m"", 'not', 'taking', 'sides', 'here', 'political', 'policies', 'neither', 'film', 'end', 'debate', 'usually', 'illegals', 'point', 'individuals', 'many', 'cases', 'women', 'children', 'become', 'two-dimensional', 'cartoons', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'humanity', 'issue', 'specialist', 'covering', 'religious', 'issues', 'world', 'know', 'one', 'great', 'moral', 'choruses', 'immigration', 'are', 'religious', 'leaders', 'especially', 'Catholic', 'church', 'life', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'especially', 'emphasized', 'human', 'dignity', 'person', 'need', 'compassion', 'relating', 'many', 'groups', 'people', 'desperately', 'hoping', 'migrate', 'world.That', 'value', 'movie', 'compassion', 'vision', 'human', 'dignity', 'hearts', 'go', 'out', 'poor', 'mother', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'who', 'simply', 'raise', 'son', 'corner', 'world', 'where', 'chance', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'Instead', 'victimized', 'several', 'different', 'directions', 'most', 'film', 'follow', 'despair', 'dehumanization', 'ultimately', 'violence', 'immigrant-detention', 'system', 'one', 'point', 'mother', 'out', 'one', 'guards', 'Do', 'want', 'know', 'have', 'suffered', 'enough', 'stay', 'country', ""'ll"", 'think', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'differently', 'film', 'great', 'choice', 'spark', 'discussion', 'friends', 'grounds', 'definitely', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1388011,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004707APW,DVD Verdict,"[0, 1]","Judge Jake Ware, DVD Verdict -- ""No matter how much we discuss the subject, world migration--legal and illegal--is here to stay. Experts debate the issue and kick it back and forth as if they were involved in a game of verbal soccer. And yet no one talks about the very real people that are the pawns in this game, who regularly have their lives turned upside down, risking everything for better opportunity for themselves or their families. Illegal is a thought provoking and moving story of ordinary people living extraordinary lives simply because of the randomness of their birthplace. The film spends most of its 90 minute runtime at a fictional detention center where Tania is held as her deportation draws near. Life at the center is shown to be little better than prison with the forced expulsions hanging over the detainees' heads much like a death sentence might hang over the head of a death row inmate. Like so many government initiatives in many of our nations (the war on drugs, for example), the process of dealing with illegal aliens as portrayed in this film seems to be more about putting on a good show for the voters and the media than about actually arriving at a practical and, more importantly, realistic solution to a very real problem. Illegal presents this debate from the immigrant's perspective. Of course, it does take sides, and there is never any doubt that we are meant to sympathize with the protagonist of the story. However, the film is neither heavy handed nor manipulative. Director Olivier Masset-Depasse must be applauded for tackling this emotional and very uncommercial topic. Unfortunately, the 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen visuals of Illegal are not stellar. It suffers from heavy compression and there were many instances of the image pixelating, especially during the less contrasting scenes. This problem is persistent throughout the film, and while it does not detract from the strength of the story, it did call attention to itself.""",4,A thoughtful and mature work about an important subject,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1981,"['Judge', 'Jake', 'Ware', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'discuss', 'subject', 'world', 'migration', 'legal', 'illegal', 'here', 'stay', 'Experts', 'debate', 'issue', 'kick', 'back', 'forth', 'were', 'involved', 'game', 'verbal', 'soccer', 'yet', 'one', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'pawns', 'game', 'who', 'regularly', 'have', 'lives', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'risking', 'everything', 'better', 'opportunity', 'families', 'Illegal', 'thought', 'provoking', 'moving', 'story', 'ordinary', 'people', 'living', 'extraordinary', 'lives', 'simply', 'randomness', 'birthplace', 'film', 'most', '90', 'minute', 'runtime', 'fictional', 'detention', 'center', 'where', 'Tania', 'held', 'deportation', 'draws', 'Life', 'center', 'shown', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'prison', 'forced', 'expulsions', 'hanging', 'detainees', 'heads', 'much', 'death', 'sentence', 'might', 'hang', 'head', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', 'so', 'many', 'government', 'initiatives', 'many', 'nations', 'war', 'drugs', 'example', 'process', 'dealing', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'portrayed', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'putting', 'good', 'show', 'voters', 'media', 'actually', 'arriving', 'practical', 'more', 'importantly', 'realistic', 'solution', 'very', 'real', 'problem', 'Illegal', 'presents', 'debate', 'immigrant', 'perspective', 'course', 'take', 'sides', 'never', 'doubt', 'are', 'meant', 'sympathize', 'protagonist', 'story', 'However', 'film', 'heavy', 'handed', 'manipulative', 'Director', 'Olivier', 'Masset-Depasse', 'must', 'be', 'applauded', 'tackling', 'emotional', 'very', 'uncommercial', 'topic', 'Unfortunately', '1.85:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'visuals', 'Illegal', 'are', 'not', 'stellar', 'heavy', 'compression', 'were', 'many', 'instances', 'image', 'pixelating', 'especially', 'less', 'contrasting', 'scenes', 'problem', 'persistent', 'film', 'not', 'detract', 'strength', 'story', 'did', 'call', 'attention']",N/A

1388013,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B004707APW,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I usually enjoy Film Movement's releases on DVD, and own quite a few of their features, but this movie has to be the bottom of the barrel for them. Basically, it is about a Belarussian mother and her 13-year-old son living illegally in Belgium. The mother is caught by immigration enforcement agents on the street while bringing her son home from school on his birthday. Her son escapes; she is sent to a detention center to await extradition. She keeps her identity hidden (even assumes that of a fellow illegal immigrant), while stressfully worrying about being reunited with her child. There, she connects with other illegal immigrants.There are 3 major problems with this movie: 1) I had NO sympathy for the main character; 2) The audience is given her situation with NO background information about her or the mafia man who is harboring her. It simply tells some sort of story about how bad it is to be an immigrant in Belgium; and 3) The immigration problems in Belgium are unknown to me, and I am simply relying at taking the filmmakers' word on EVERYTHING that is put on the screen, especially &#34;true events&#34; that are being fictionalized.If you are from Europe, and know about the problems with illegal immigration in Belgium, then you'll probably &#34;get&#34; this movie. That aside, there is no character development, and EVERYTHING that happens to the main character is HER FAULT (except the obvious &#34;human rights&#34; violations). One is greatly mistaken if you make an equivalency to this movie and American movies about illegal immigration from Mexico (for that, see &#34;El Norte&#34;). It is supposed to be a film about a mother and son and their separation, and it states so inside the dvd container. However, it merely becomes uninteresting and dull (propaganda?) rather quickly.The lead actress, Anne Coesens, seems to be constantly figuring out how to portray her character. She seems to be brooding and stares at what goes on around her. The most interesting, and better performed, characters in the movie (and they, too, are way underdeveloped) are the Chilean woman and her child, the female guard (a great acting performance), as well as the woman from Mali (of whom the story is partially based).There are much better, earlier movies (&#34;Ali: Fear Eats Soul&#34; and &#34;Unveiled&#34; to name two) that deal with immigration problems in Europe. I am also disappointed by FM for releasing such a low-par feature, and of the many DVDs I own and have seen from this company, this one is on the bottom.Unfortunately, it is forgettable.

Tania is staying illegally in Belgium and at a random check for her papers by Belgian police (despite having a fake identity card), she panicks and tries to get away, unsuccessfully. Tania is taken away to a detention center for illegal women and families in Brussels. Troubles ensue, and as deportation looms, Tania becomes more and more desperate. I will leave the plot at that, as I will let you check out the rest of the movie for yourself.Several thoughts: yes, this is of course a movie about immigration issues, but, as the excellent liner notes make clear, director Olivier Masset-Depasse uses the plot to explore the mother-son relationship, and the desperate things a mother will do for her son, at any cost to herself. The director does a great job at that. And actress Anne Coesens, playing the role of Tania, is simply outstanding (winning several movie festival awards). Great movie all around, although this is miles away from a happy-go-lucky Hollywood movie, obviously.I am a native Belgian myself, although now a long-time US resident (legal, mind you). This movie was Belgium's entry for the 2010 Oscar for Best Foreign Movie (although it didn't get nominated). But just last weekend I watched ""Bullhead"" here in the theatre, another great Belgian movie which did get nominated for the 2011 Best Foreign Movie Oscar (although it didn't win at last weekend's Oscars). Couldn't help but feel some pride that a ""little"" country like Belgium can produce quality movies like ""Illegal"" and more recently ""Bullhead"". A big thank you to Film Movement for bringing ""Illegal"" to American audiences!",4,The desperate things a mother will do,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,2054,"['have', 'been', 'long-time', 'fan', 'Film', 'Movement', 'collection', 'foreign', 'indie', 'movies', 'fact', 'recently', 'finally', 'subscribed', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'foreign', 'movie', 'section', 'local', 'library', 'seeing', 'top', 'movie', 'Begium', 'more', 'later', 'immediately', 'snapped', 'up', 'Illegal', '95', 'min', '2010', 'release', 'Belgium', 'harrowing', 'story', 'Tania', 'Russian', 'woman', 'living', 'Belgium', '13', 'yr.', 'old', 'son', 'Tania', 'staying', 'illegally', 'Belgium', 'random', 'check', 'papers', 'Belgian', 'police', 'having', 'fake', 'identity', 'card', 'tries', 'get', 'away', 'unsuccessfully', 'Tania', 'taken', 'away', 'detention', 'center', 'illegal', 'women', 'families', 'Brussels', 'Troubles', 'ensue', 'deportation', 'Tania', 'more', 'more', 'desperate', 'will', 'leave', 'plot', 'will', 'let', 'check', 'out', 'rest', 'movie', 'yourself.Several', 'thoughts', 'yes', 'course', 'movie', 'immigration', 'issues', 'excellent', 'liner', 'notes', 'make', 'clear', 'director', 'Olivier', 'Masset-Depasse', 'plot', 'explore', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'desperate', 'things', 'mother', 'will', 'do', 'son', 'cost', 'herself', 'director', 'great', 'job', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Coesens', 'playing', 'role', 'Tania', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'winning', 'several', 'movie', 'festival', 'awards', 'Great', 'movie', 'around', 'miles', 'away', 'happy-go-lucky', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'obviously.I', 'am', 'native', 'Belgian', 'now', 'long-time', 'US', 'resident', 'legal', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'Belgium', 'entry', '2010', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'nominated', 'just', 'last', 'weekend', 'watched', 'Bullhead', 'here', 'theatre', 'great', 'Belgian', 'movie', 'did', 'get', 'nominated', '2011', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Movie', 'Oscar', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'last', 'weekend', 'Oscars', 'Could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'pride', 'little', 'country', 'Belgium', 'can', 'produce', 'quality', 'movies', 'Illegal', 'more', 'recently', 'Bullhead', 'big', 'thank', 'Film', 'Movement', 'bringing', 'Illegal', 'American', 'audiences']",N/A

As one commentor mentions, this movie humanizes the process.  Perhaps he is right that those who have drive are the very ones who deserve citizenship.  I don't say, as Obama does, ""let them all in so they will vote for me.""  But I have had an opinion change about these poor illegal immigrants who are just looking for something better.  I just cried.  How very little justice there is in this world.  Isn't there enough room in the United States for a few more who will use their talents to build it up?  What happened to the Statue of Liberty quote:  ""...bring me...your huddled masses yearning to breathe free""?  Who knows, maybe the next will be an Albert Einstein, for all we know?  And that we would turn people back to dictatorships!  Who do we think we are?  Isn't there some way that this could be done properly?  How did my great-grandparents get here?  And yours?  They just came.  Same way we are putting down.  And it's not as if many don't have blood on their hands.  What did many do to the original inhabitants of this land?  Perhaps that whole scenario shows a little bit of hypocrisy.  And the poor Lieve (played exquisitely by Christelle Cornil), who works at the detention center, just can't seem to understand why it is so terrible in the horrible Belarus dictatorship and why people would try to come to her country to escape.  Is it so terrible back there, after all?  Tania answers her ""Do you think we're masochists to endure all this hardship for a little freedom?But when when one of the residents commits suicide, Lieve begins to understand then what these people are enduring in their own countries.  Could it be so horrible to cut them a little slack?  I have many European friends (the place this woman is trying to get inTO), who would love to come here to the US and are brilliant and have plenty of qualifications, promise, and future.  Is there truly no room?  Would there really be chaos?  Or is this a vain imagining.  Candada and the countries down under let more in then we do and they seem to be fine.  Perhaps they have their own problems, as well, but perhaps we also have a little more hypocrisy here, as mentioned by another commentor.  I'm afraid I have changed my mind from kicking them all out to letting them all come in who can somehow show they have a genuine need.  I don't think it would cause chaos.  If China can hold her billions, why not the US her millions?  How bad could it really be?  This movie has changed my mind on this subject forever.  It has changed my life.  You should watch it, too, if you ever get the chance.",5,Very memorable,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,2707,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'types', 'who', 'said', 'kick', 'out', 'illegals', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'cried', 'one', 'commentor', 'mentions', 'movie', 'process', 'Perhaps', 'right', 'who', 'have', 'drive', 'are', 'very', 'ones', 'who', 'deserve', 'citizenship', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'Obama', 'let', 'will', 'vote', 'have', 'had', 'opinion', 'change', 'poor', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'something', 'better', 'just', 'cried', 'How', 'very', 'little', 'justice', 'world', ""n't"", 'enough', 'room', 'United', 'States', 'few', 'more', 'who', 'will', 'use', 'talents', 'build', 'up', 'What', 'happened', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'quote', 'bring', 'huddled', 'masses', 'yearning', 'breathe', 'free', 'Who', 'maybe', 'next', 'will', 'be', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'know', 'would', 'turn', 'people', 'back', 'dictatorships', 'Who', 'do', 'think', 'are', ""n't"", 'way', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'properly', 'How', 'did', 'great-grandparents', 'get', 'here', 'yours', 'just', 'came', 'Same', 'way', 'are', 'putting', 'down', 'not', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'blood', 'hands', 'What', 'did', 'many', 'do', 'original', 'inhabitants', 'land', 'Perhaps', 'whole', 'scenario', 'little', 'bit', 'hypocrisy', 'poor', 'Lieve', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'Christelle', 'Cornil', 'who', 'detention', 'center', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'terrible', 'horrible', 'Belarus', 'dictatorship', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'try', 'come', 'country', 'escape', 'so', 'terrible', 'back', 'there', 'Tania', 'Do', 'think', ""'re"", 'masochists', 'endure', 'hardship', 'little', 'freedom', 'when', 'when', 'one', 'residents', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Lieve', 'understand', 'then', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'enduring', 'own', 'countries', 'Could', 'be', 'so', 'horrible', 'cut', 'little', 'slack', 'have', 'many', 'European', 'friends', 'place', 'woman', 'trying', 'get', 'inTO', 'who', 'would', 'love', 'come', 'here', 'US', 'are', 'brilliant', 'have', 'plenty', 'qualifications', 'promise', 'future', 'truly', 'room', 'Would', 'really', 'be', 'chaos', 'vain', 'imagining', 'Candada', 'countries', 'down', 'let', 'more', 'then', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'fine', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'also', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'hypocrisy', 'here', 'mentioned', 'commentor', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'kicking', 'letting', 'come', 'who', 'can', 'somehow', 'show', 'have', 'genuine', 'need', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'cause', 'chaos', 'China', 'can', 'hold', 'billions', 'why', 'not', 'US', 'millions', 'How', 'bad', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'movie', 'changed', 'mind', 'subject', 'forever', 'changed', 'life', 'should', 'watch', 'too', 'ever', 'get', 'chance']",N/A
