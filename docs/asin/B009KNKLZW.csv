1597550,AYKN84MIK63TP,B009KNKLZW,M. Hughes,"[9, 13]","I am the Stones Authority. I bought this as a gift for a friend, as I already own all the individual DVD's. He loves it and at this price it is a steal. And all three of these DVD's rate a 5 Star review, with perhaps only the Exile documentary pulling in a 4 or 4 1/2 Star rating. I am not going to review each of the DVD's here, as I have already done that for each of them individually. Perhaps I will paste those reviews in later as an addendum to this review. Suffice it to say, it is a bargain and if you like the Stones or are curious about the Stones then you cannot go wrong picking up this three pack at this price.ADDENDUMSTONES IN EXILEREVIEW TITLE: Sunny South of France from the Basement - 4 StarsI am the Stones Authority. Everyone knows about the Exile story, right? If not, then watch the movie - I am not telling you about it here. But this is a big moment in the history of the band - a make or break point. It is the children left to their own devices, except that they are not such little kids anymore. All the minders are gone and they have left home, see what happens... As for the documentary, there has been a lot of criticism of the lack of actual film footage and the use of still photos in montage to make up for it. Look you whiners, not everyone was walking around with a flipping movie camera 24/7 back in the early 70's. You might also be surprised to learn that they did not have cell phones either. However, the interviews woven throughout this movie with such important characters as Mick Taylor, Anita Pallenburg and Bobby Keys, etc., makes for a wonderful view into this unusual period of the bands' history and the making of one of their best - however improbable given the circumstances - albums of their career. I think that it should be the companion piece while reading Tony Sanchez's book ""Up and Down with the Rolling Stones"". Whenever I mention that book it generally hits a nerve with some hardcore Stones fans, who protest that it is a pack of lies. Well, if it is a pack of lies then it is remarkable in its ability to paint accurately the same atmosphere at Nellecote that the documentary does. Besides, in my research recently, I re-read a Rolling Stone magazine interview with Keith from about the time of Some Girls - and he was asked about the book. He did not refute the content. He was, however, angry about what he perceived as a betrayal of trust and accused Sanchez of profiteering. Really. Look, if you are a low life drug dealer with no future prospects you are going to write a book about the only thing of significance to happen in your life. But I digress. This a great documentary with some tasty extras and you should add it to your collection.LADIES & GENTLEMEN THE ROLLING STONESREVIEW TITLE: Oh Yeah! - 5 StarsI am the Stones Authority. I remember seeing this as a midnight movie in 1978. Well, really, I didn't remember much, but then the DVD. Oh yeah. When watching this thing people need to keep in mind that it is 1972. Concerts and big time rock and roll were still evolving - the modest staging is really quite remarkable to behold - even for a major act like the Rolling Stones. As well, the venues from which these performances were pulled to make the full length DVD ""concert"" were quite modest as well. They played two shows in Fort Worth and they played two shows in Houston at Hofheinz Pavillion. Now, I don't know much about the venue in Fort Worth, but I can tell you that Hofheinz is a quite small basketball arena on the University of Houston that might seat four thousand. Today it is a dark and dank dump. Whenever I am there I can't help but think - this is where the Stones played? Doesn't seem possible. It wasn't like they were just breaking out and needed the gig! Now, keeping all this in mind, keep also in mind the limitations of the technology of the day - particularly live concert production, both for recording the live music and filming it. Can't be compared with today. Clearly there is no real lighting director on this thing - or it would have never been lit like this for film. There is probably no real director - or the camera angles and shot selections would have been a bit different for sure, but all that aside and looking past all that - as you should - what this film captures is quite amazing. A very tuned up and hungry Rolling Stones in a fairly raw and intimate setting - no frills staging, just the band - blowing it out. This is a time capsule - given that it is 40 years ago. 40 flipping years ago. The Rolling Stones are very good. And this is as good as anything for proof of how good a guitar player Keith is, but, of course, it is also a record of just how amazing the very young Mick Taylor is. And Jagger is no slouch either. The energy is full blast start to finish. Now, they could control that because they were picking and choosing between four shows worth of performances, but still... I can't play this DVD enough. ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Bitch"" open the ""show"" - it is a hell of a one two punch. The version of ""Dead Flowers"" is just terrific. ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Love In Vain"" back to back are wonderful. Taylor's slide on ""Vain"" is inspired and the version from the film ""Gimme Shelter"" has nothing on this one. But perhaps the absolute dynamite blow you away track - and not a particular favorite of mine, but here it just sets everything on fire - is this version of ""All Down the Line"". I've never heard it that good. And it just maybe be the best single live performance of a song captured of the Stones. I mean, it is that good. Jaw dropping good. Bill is just pumping the locomotive - that bass line is just throbbing and there are a couple of down the line shots where you pretty much see the whole band and it is like you are watching one whole organism moving to the groove. It's mind blowing. Taylor smokes it too. It is just nuts. I really could go on and on about this DVD and every track - including Keith's great guitar work on ""Bye Bye Johnny"" - even though the camera guys miss a lot of it, you hear it baby. And then the dual closers ""Jumping Jack Flash"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" just leave you wanting more. Oh, to have been there - in that little dump of an arena! After you watch this DVD - and see through the years and technological limitations - there is no band today that carries that kind of energy into a show today, leaves it all out on the stage like they do for these shows. The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. For a reason.ROLLING STONES: SOME GIRLS LIVE IN TEXAS '78 - 5 StarsREVIEW TITLE: Would Have Loved To Have Seen This Tour - Now I CanI am the Stones Authority. Look, this thing is getting reviewed through the roof for a reason, and the negative reviews tend to focus on technical issues. I must confess that they do not concern me. What a pleasant surprise the release of this DVD is. A great time to see the Stones too. Here they are after all the transition mess of the mid-70's with Ron Wood fully incorporated and a hit album to go out on stage with and strut. And this album is a strutter and you get most of it in this show, which is also nice. Many of the technical deficiencies that people complain about with ""Ladies & Gentlemen"" are absent here. It is well lit, it is reasonably well directed and it is all from one show. The idea that this hasn't seen the light of day until now is really quite something - what other gems like this await a similar release? Brussels? Hampton Roads? Los Angeles? I had heard something about a film floating around from this tour, but honestly I didn't put much stock in it and figured it was something on the order of ""C*** S***** Blues"" - some disjointed, mish mash of questionable production quality that one day would surface on some cheese ball over priced bootleg. Well, I was wrong. Good. This has to be considered the best Rolling Stones concert DVD - with perhaps only The Rolling Stones at the Max (Steel Wheels Tour and really great DVD) comparing with it or besting it. For now, this Stones concert DVD is my tops. I like the intimacy due to the size of the venue, the size of the stage and the camera positions. You get a better sense of what it is like to be at the ""show"" here than with any other Stones DVD, as far as I am concerned. And then also, the fact that the show is supporting the ""Some Girls"" album is great too. You get 7 songs from the 10 song album. That is pretty unusual too, but it contributes to the ""real"" concert feel of this show - as opposed to the ""revue"" style shows we have had from the Stones since Steel Wheels. It is a great album and the hi-lites from this concert - and there are several throughout - are terrific performances of ""Beast of Burden"" and ""Shattered"". You will love this DVD. If you don't, then you just don't get the Stones.",5,Can't Beat It,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,8805,"['am', 'Stones', 'Authority', 'bought', 'gift', 'friend', 'already', 'own', 'individual', 'DVD',
