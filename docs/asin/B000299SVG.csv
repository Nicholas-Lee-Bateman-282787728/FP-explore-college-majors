He's taking a correspondence course to become a mechanical engineer. She scoffs that he'll never amount to anything more than what he is: superintendant of an apartment building.Andy stops at a bar one night and meets Claudine (Hildur), a young lady who claims to be homeless and without friends. She needs a place to stay for the night and the Super compassionately and rather foolishly offers the use of an apartment that's vacant for the weekend.Immediately, Claudine's crazy Vietnam vet boyfriend Billy (Brandon), his explosives expert buddy Riff (Watson Jr.) and sadistic Virgil (McIntire) move in with the girl. When they sneak up to 7A to see what's going on, Artie and Iris are kidnapped, Artie is thrashed and they're both tied to chairs and gagged.The three men have purposely chosen this building as a base of operations to breach the basement wall of an adjacent bank and rob its vault. They've already planted an armed time bomb in a newly opened safety deposit box; it's set to detonate at 9:30 pm. At 9, the break-in will begin. Billy and Virgil both have hair-trigger tempers and Billy is obviously nuts. Will the Sawyers survive the night?THE STRANGERS IN 7A is also available on MCE'sALL STARS 50 MOVIE PACK.Parenthetical number is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.3) The Strangers in 7A (TV-1972) - Andy Griffith/Ida Lupino/Michael Brandon/James A.

827759,A23NJ9AMXSVC6D,B000299SVG,BerraH,"[1, 1]","This movie was OK but it was just different than we were expecting. We love the Andy Griffith Show and all of the characters from Mayberry! It is a &#34;good&#34; wholesome family show that we can watch without the worry of improper innuendos and suggestive comments that you get with so many other shows! So when we saw that there were other movies that Andy Griffith played in, we were very excited and ordered several of them. I guess we just had the perception that Andy Griffith would have the same values and similar characteristics in all of his movies as he did in his role as Andy Taylor. However, we were disappointed when we found out that he plays roles of people with quite different characteristics in other movies. The roles that he plays in other movies includes characteristics of self-centeredness, pride, arrogance, loud-mouthed, vagrant and a rebel. All of these are basically quite the opposite characteristics of the image that we had developed of Andy Griffith.In this movie &#34;The Stranger in 7a&#34; Andy Griffith plays the role of Artie which was the maintenance man in an apartment building. It was obvious that his marriage wasn't the best and he was willing to have an affair with a lady that he met in a bar while his wife was away. However the affair never happened because she was just leading him on to be able to gain access to apartment &#34;7a&#34; which her boyfriend and his accomplices were going to use in a plan to break into the bank next door. It definitely was not a high quality film but Artie (Andy Griffith) does ends up being the &#34;hero&#34; and he and his wife seem to mend their relationship.As movies go, this movie was OK but if you are expecting to see a movie where Andy Griffith plays a similar role as he does in The Andy Griffith Show (as Sheriff Taylor) then I would not recommend this one.",3,Just OK,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1853,"['movie', 'was', 'OK', 'was', 'just', 'different', 'were', 'expecting', 'love', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'characters', 'Mayberry', '34', 'good', '34', 'wholesome', 'family', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'worry', 'improper', 'innuendos', 'suggestive', 'comments', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'So', 'when', 'saw', 'were', 'other', 'movies', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'played', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'ordered', 'several', 'guess', 'just', 'had', 'perception', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'values', 'similar', 'characteristics', 'movies', 'did', 'role', 'Andy', 'Taylor', 'However', 'were', 'disappointed', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'roles', 'people', 'quite', 'different', 'characteristics', 'other', 'movies', 'roles', 'other', 'movies', 'characteristics', 'self-centeredness', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'loud-mouthed', 'vagrant', 'rebel', 'are', 'basically', 'quite', 'opposite', 'characteristics', 'image', 'had', 'developed', 'Andy', 'Griffith.In', 'movie', '34', 'Stranger', '7a', '34', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'role', 'Artie', 'was', 'maintenance', 'man', 'apartment', 'building', 'was', 'obvious', 'marriage', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'was', 'willing', 'have', 'affair', 'lady', 'met', 'bar', 'wife', 'was', 'away', 'However', 'affair', 'never', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'leading', 'be', 'able', 'gain', 'access', 'apartment', '34', '7a', '34', 'boyfriend', 'accomplices', 'were', 'going', 'use', 'plan', 'break', 'bank', 'next', 'door', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'Artie', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'up', 'being', '34', 'hero', '34', 'wife', 'seem', 'mend', 'relationship.As', 'movies', 'go', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'are', 'expecting', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'similar', 'role', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'Sheriff', 'Taylor', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A
