1206586,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B001JP63X8,Annie Van Auken,"[5, 5]","First a word about privately manufactured DVDs--Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to multi-film budget brands. The films themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can provide a valuable outlet for movies unavailable anywhere else.Alas, as of 5/09 this SYNERGY dub of LET'S LIVE A LITTLE is the only DVD game in town, and the only availableVHSis from an off-brand called ABM. Transfer flaws have been mentioned elsewhere, so caveat emptor, OK? Data on the film itself, then:SYNOPSIS--It's a slight romantic comedy with a psychiatric sub-theme. Adman Duke Crawford (Cummings) has a perfume exec client who was his fiance&eacute; until Duke broke off with her. Michele Bennett (Sten) personifies the ""woman scorned"" axiom-- she drives ex-beau Duke to distraction by refusing to place her signature on a contract.Duke wants nothing more to do with female clients so his boss, James Montgomery (Antrim) assigns him to a psychologist's book promo campaign. But lovely Dr. Loring (Lamarr) clearly isn't the man Duke thought he'd meet when visiting the shrink's office. Despite this, Duke makes an appointment the next day with Dr. L for advice on his intransigent ex.From here the story becomes one of jealousies and obssessions. Michele resents Jo and Duke's obviously budding relationship and so does Jo's stiff-collared surgeon boyfriend, Dr. Richard Fields (Shayne). Duke plans to go ahead and marry Michele; Fields takes Jo to a lodge to get her mind off Duke, who isn't exactly looking forward to his wedding.Related items:The very next project for Hedy Lamarr was De Mille's epicSAMSON AND DELILAH(1949) opposite Victor Mature.In 1949, Bob Cummings appeared in Anthony Mann's excellent film noir,REIGN OF TERROR.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(5.2) Let's Live a Little (1948) - Hedy Lamarr/Robert Cummings/Anna Sten/Robert Shayne/Harry Antrim (uncredited: Billy Bevan/Lucien Littlefield/John Dehner/Jimmie Dodd/John Newfield)",3,That's living?,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2202,"['First', 'word', 'privately', 'manufactured', 'DVDs', 'Often', 'transfers', 'are', 'quality', 'similar', 'multi-film', 'budget', 'brands', 'films', 'are', 'unrestored', 'rarely', 'pristine', 'yet', 'still', 'watchable', 'inordinate', 'number', 'repaired', 'breaks', 'Extras', 'are', 'non-existent', 'inclusion', 'artwork', 'liner', 'notes', 'varies', 'manufacturer', 'companies', 'can', 'provide', 'valuable', 'outlet', 'movies', 'unavailable', 'anywhere', 'else.Alas', '5/09', 'SYNERGY', 'dub', 'LET', ""'S"", 'LIVE', 'A', 'LITTLE', 'only', 'DVD', 'game', 'town', 'only', 'availableVHSis', 'off-brand', 'called', 'ABM', 'Transfer', 'flaws', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'elsewhere', 'so', 'caveat', 'emptor', 'OK', 'Data', 'film', 'then', 'SYNOPSIS', 'slight', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'psychiatric', 'sub-theme', 'Adman', 'Duke', 'Crawford', 'Cummings', 'perfume', 'exec', 'client', 'who', 'was', 'fiance', 'eacute', 'Duke', 'broke', 'off', 'Michele', 'Bennett', 'Sten', 'woman', 'scorned', 'axiom', 'ex-beau', 'Duke', 'distraction', 'refusing', 'place', 'signature', 'contract.Duke', 'nothing', 'more', 'do', 'female', 'clients', 'boss', 'James', 'Montgomery', 'Antrim', 'psychologist', 'book', 'promo', 'campaign', 'lovely', 'Dr.', 'Loring', 'Lamarr', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'man', 'Duke', 'thought', ""'d"", 'meet', 'when', 'visiting', 'shrink', 'office', 'Duke', 'appointment', 'next', 'day', 'Dr.', 'L', 'advice', 'intransigent', 'ex.From', 'here', 'story', 'one', 'jealousies', 'obssessions', 'Michele', 'resents', 'Jo', 'Duke', 'obviously', 'budding', 'relationship', 'so', 'Jo', 'stiff-collared', 'surgeon', 'boyfriend', 'Dr.', 'Richard', 'Fields', 'Shayne', 'Duke', 'go', 'ahead', 'marry', 'Michele', 'Fields', 'Jo', 'lodge', 'get', 'mind', 'Duke', 'who', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'looking', 'forward', 'wedding.Related', 'items', 'very', 'next', 'project', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'was', 'De', 'Mille', 'epicSAMSON', 'DELILAH', '1949', 'opposite', 'Victor', 'Mature.In', '1949', 'Bob', 'Cummings', 'appeared', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'excellent', 'film', 'noir', 'REIGN', 'OF', 'TERROR.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', 'found', 'film', 'resource', 'website', '5.2', 'Let', 'Live', 'Little', '1948', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr/Robert', 'Cummings/Anna', 'Sten/Robert', 'Shayne/Harry', 'Antrim', 'uncredited', 'Billy', 'Bevan/Lucien', 'Littlefield/John', 'Dehner/Jimmie', 'Dodd/John', 'Newfield']",N/A

Hedy Lamarr is a welcome always in my book, but Anna Sten, who I had seen before in all three of her Goldwyn outings, was a pleasant surprise. I like Anna Sten, her acting and her beauty always lit up the screen in spite of what people said about her, the victim of a two year overly done publicity campaign to transform her into a &#34;New Garbo&#34;, she is sadly overlooked, check out some of her other films, a few are available free or for low rental fees on the internet. This is a wonderful comic romp with Cummings as a businessman who suffers a breakdown while working for Sten, who uses him as a sexual playthings, only to become enraptured with the heavenly Hedy. I liked Cummings with the moustache, it made him look more handsome and balanced his features more, it was a shame when he shaved half of it off only to have to shave the rest of it as well. All in all 'Let's Live a Little' (1948) is a fun hour and a half and will leave you wanting just a bit more.",4,Finally Bob Cummings...,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1131,"['disappointment', ""'The"", 'Texans', '1938', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'was', 'actually', 'opposed', 'just', 'floral', 'dressing', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'welcome', 'always', 'book', 'Anna', 'Sten', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'three', 'Goldwyn', 'outings', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'like', 'Anna', 'Sten', 'acting', 'beauty', 'always', 'lit', 'up', 'screen', 'spite', 'what', 'people', 'said', 'victim', 'two', 'year', 'overly', 'done', 'publicity', 'campaign', 'transform', '34', 'New', 'Garbo', '34', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'films', 'few', 'are', 'available', 'free', 'low', 'rental', 'fees', 'internet', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'romp', 'Cummings', 'businessman', 'who', 'breakdown', 'working', 'Sten', 'who', 'sexual', 'playthings', 'only', 'become', 'enraptured', 'heavenly', 'Hedy', 'liked', 'Cummings', 'moustache', 'made', 'look', 'more', 'handsome', 'balanced', 'features', 'more', 'was', 'shame', 'when', 'shaved', 'half', 'off', 'only', 'have', 'shave', 'rest', 'as', 'well', ""'Let"", 'Live', 'Little', '1948', 'fun', 'hour', 'half', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'just', 'bit', 'more']",N/A

The movie is pretty good though with Cummings as an ad executive under stress from an overagressive female client sent to a female neurologist.

Lukomski ""MilwMusicMan""","[1, 1]","I was very pleased to see someone releasing some of Hedy Lamarr's lesser known films on DVD, so I snatched this up as soon as I saw it.  The transfer to DVD leaves a bit to be desired.  The film quality isn't the greatest picture but I don't believe there's a better version available, I'm sorry to say.  I think Hedy and Robert Cummings are quite good in this film and of course Hedy looks as stunning as always.  It's interesting to see a middle aged woman (not Hedy) who is a client of Robert Cummings being sexually aggressive.  I doubt that was the norm in the 1940's.  The movie is cute and romantic and I think very enjoyable by most audiences.

1206592,A1B1F6YL4KP3S6,B001JP63X8,Tonio Gas,"[0, 0]","If you like good romantic comedy and Hedy Lamarr, you should accept that this DVD seems to be quite lousy (as I've seen the movie on TV in Germany, I will only rate the movie itself). What appears to be a B-picture, is good entertainment. Bob Cummings was sometimes miscast as a classical hero, being too boyish, but in this movie, he is perfect as a stressed and puzzled businessman, unable to cope with his demanding job (and especially with a demanding lady). Hedy Lamarr, beautiful as ever and dressed in lavish New-Look-Dresses, was said not to be an actress but a statue, more appearing than acting. But her non-acting gives her character (an analyst) a stoic quietness which mixes perfectly with Cummings' hectic rush. The movie has some deliberate kitsch, but also witty and creative images (such as superimposed fantasies) and witty lines, poking fun at psychoanalytic therapy. Note that the subject was in vogue in (not only) Hollywood's post-war era in which movies such as ""Spellbound"" (1945) and ""The Snake Pit"" (1948) were released.* It was about time for a psychoanalytic comedy, and here it is!* Other than indicated by Amazon, ""Let's live a little"" was released in 1948 and not in 1939.",5,"""I'm mad, but I know it""",1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1203,"['like', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'should', 'accept', 'DVD', 'be', 'quite', 'lousy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'TV', 'Germany', 'will', 'only', 'rate', 'movie', 'What', 'be', 'B-picture', 'good', 'entertainment', 'Bob', 'Cummings', 'was', 'sometimes', 'miscast', 'classical', 'hero', 'being', 'too', 'boyish', 'movie', 'perfect', 'stressed', 'puzzled', 'businessman', 'unable', 'cope', 'demanding', 'job', 'especially', 'demanding', 'lady', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'dressed', 'lavish', 'New-Look-Dresses', 'was', 'said', 'not', 'be', 'actress', 'statue', 'more', 'appearing', 'acting', 'non-acting', 'character', 'analyst', 'stoic', 'quietness', 'perfectly', 'Cummings', 'hectic', 'rush', 'movie', 'deliberate', 'kitsch', 'also', 'witty', 'creative', 'images', 'such', 'superimposed', 'fantasies', 'witty', 'lines', 'poking', 'fun', 'psychoanalytic', 'therapy', 'Note', 'subject', 'was', 'vogue', 'not', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'post-war', 'era', 'movies', 'such', 'Spellbound', '1945', 'Snake', 'Pit', '1948', 'were', 'released', '*', 'was', 'time', 'psychoanalytic', 'comedy', 'here', 'Other', 'indicated', 'Amazon', 'Let', 'live', 'little', 'was', 'released', '1948', 'not', '1939']",N/A
