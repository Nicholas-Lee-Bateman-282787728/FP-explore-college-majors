969333,ABTNYT21NX2LW,B000E6EK2O,"elisa cibrario ""TV connoisseur""","[3, 3]","NOTHING. The part about Brad Pitt going to his school is beyond hilarious, and the way he phrases the bit about not knowing Queen or Wham! were gay -- laugh-cramp-inducing, to say the least. I, too, had it on VHS and was afraid to play it one more time in case it melted. Even after meeting him in person and not being at all impressed with his arrogance, I absolutely love his humor and especially his delivery--and that's saying a lot for an unforgiving Italian like me!

As a previous reviewer has indicated, I also wrote HBO in hopes of getting this produced (maybe it worked!). I too downloaded this a long time ago and that CD has seen some serious play (thanks Napster!). I have only seen the stand-up once on HBO, the day it aired for the first time, so I always have to explain the Everclear bit when he explains how much will get a girl wasted and how much will kill her. There is not a part in this stand-up which is unfunny, I might have to buy two copies cause I know I'll wear one out. David Spade, you have cursed me because everytime I'm on a flight now I have to make the ""boing"" sound of the call button and laugh and everyone around me thinks I'm crazy.

969335,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B000E6EK2O,Mr. J. Murdock,"[0, 0]","David Spade turned out to be surprisingly funny in this one. Generally, I am not a David Spade fan: I don't care much for The Rules of Engagement but Take the Hit was Spade's funniest and best performance. The plus side is he does not discuss subject he has no interest in; such as politics and he plays to his strengths, such as naughty sex jokes and taboo subjects. His best bits is his joke about Jon Benet Ramsey. Your jaw will drop in shocked disbelief. And his rant against the USA network for editing B-rated films which contain a lot of nudity down to PG cleanliness had me laughing off of my seat!",5,Spade hits Comic Gold in Take the Hit,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,606,"['David', 'Spade', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'one', 'Generally', 'am', 'not', 'David', 'Spade', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'Take', 'Hit', 'was', 'Spade', 'funniest', 'best', 'performance', 'plus', 'side', 'not', 'discuss', 'subject', 'interest', 'such', 'politics', 'strengths', 'such', 'naughty', 'sex', 'jokes', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'best', 'bits', 'joke', 'Jon', 'Benet', 'Ramsey', 'jaw', 'will', 'drop', 'shocked', 'disbelief', 'rant', 'USA', 'network', 'editing', 'B-rated', 'films', 'contain', 'lot', 'nudity', 'PG', 'cleanliness', 'had', 'laughing', 'seat']",David Spade - Take the Hit
