1225409,AMJ6UC5QAZND6,B001OY45TS,Agathoklis,"[0, 0]","Robert Siodmak is a director of enormous talent who like Douglas Sirk and Nicholas Ray were, I believe, forced to make stupid movies that they had no sympathy with by Hollywood. Hollywood destroyed Nicholas Ray and Douglas Sirk abandoned film making altogether forty years before his death in disgust. Siodmak returned to Germany after the war and continued making good movies until his death (although, he also made some duds in Germany).Siodmak is remembered for The Killers (another excellent film noir) and the lousy The Spiral Staircase. At his best, he had great control of actors and groups of characters. He was the only director able to control hams like Charles Laughton and Victor Mature. Nobody was able to do this.This movie, like all his consistently brilliant film noirs is complex and excellently acted especially by Barbara Stanwyck. Like Sirk and Ray, at their best, he is in complete control. As in their films minor characters are just as fascinating and complex as the main characters. Note the characterization of the defense attorney who is not interested on whether Thelma Jordan killed her aunt. All her cares about is to win.Note how well the director stages the trial scenes occupying all realistically and dramatically into the scene. See how triumphantly the defense attorney escorts Thelma Jordon to the court through the throng of reporters that are pushing, asking questions and waving cameras in their faces.Siodmak is an underrated genius. Among his works you'll find very bad movies but when he is sympathetic to the material he is a genius as in this case.",5,Brilliant film noir,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,1592,"['Robert', 'Siodmak', 'director', 'enormous', 'talent', 'who', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'were', 'believe', 'forced', 'make', 'stupid', 'movies', 'had', 'sympathy', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'destroyed', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'abandoned', 'film', 'making', 'altogether', 'forty', 'years', 'death', 'disgust', 'Siodmak', 'returned', 'Germany', 'war', 'continued', 'making', 'good', 'movies', 'death', 'also', 'made', 'duds', 'Germany', '.Siodmak', 'remembered', 'Killers', 'excellent', 'film', 'noir', 'lousy', 'Spiral', 'Staircase', 'best', 'had', 'great', 'control', 'actors', 'groups', 'characters', 'was', 'only', 'director', 'able', 'control', 'hams', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'Nobody', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'this.This', 'movie', 'consistently', 'brilliant', 'film', 'noirs', 'complex', 'excellently', 'acted', 'especially', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Sirk', 'Ray', 'best', 'complete', 'control', 'films', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'fascinating', 'complex', 'main', 'characters', 'Note', 'characterization', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'not', 'interested', 'Thelma', 'Jordan', 'killed', 'aunt', 'cares', 'win.Note', 'how', 'well', 'director', 'trial', 'scenes', 'occupying', 'realistically', 'dramatically', 'scene', 'See', 'how', 'triumphantly', 'defense', 'attorney', 'escorts', 'Thelma', 'Jordon', 'court', 'throng', 'reporters', 'are', 'pushing', 'asking', 'questions', 'waving', 'cameras', 'faces.Siodmak', 'underrated', 'genius', 'works', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'bad', 'movies', 'when', 'sympathetic', 'material', 'genius', 'case']",The File on Thelma Jordan; VHS Video

I received my copy today and watched the film tonight.  The film transfer on this DVD is better than I could have imagined.  Beautifully restored and pristine!  I love this movie....a great film to watch on a rainy day or evening.  Stanwyck is perfect as a predatory female who lures bland Wendell Corey into her trap.  Why anyone would fall for Corey would be totally unbelievable except for one thing...Stanwyck makes it believable.  She is always excellent and this film is no exception.  The climax packs a wallop and is just one more reason to own this fine film noir.  No one could touch Stanwyck and I'm glad they have finally given this movie a credible release on DVD with a beautiful transfer!

1225411,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B001OY45TS,Bobby Underwood,"[14, 14]","""Maybe I am just a dame and didn't know it. Maybe I like being picked up by a guy on a binge."" -- Stanwyck to CoreyComing somewhat late in the noir cycle, this long neglected film is much better and more deserving of the praise given many lesser films in the genre, which have been critically re-evaluated after finding a wider following through video and dvd. The File on Thelma Jordan has a beautiful score from Victor Young, lush photography from George Barnes, and good direction from Robert Siodmak, placing this one into the upper echelon of late 1940's film noir. Robert Siodmak, like his brother Curt, began his career in silent films, but was forced to flee Germany before the war, landing first in Paris, then Hollywood. He found his niche in dark and atmospheric thrillers such as The Spiral Staircase, The Dark Mirror, and The Suspect. A noir specialist, The File on Thelma Jordan is as atmospheric and entertaining as any film the director ever made. It is a shame this excellent Barbara Stanwyck film has been collecting dust in the basement of a studio rather than receiving the wide release it deserves.A marvelous mood of noir and romance is immediately set through Victor Young's orchestra and the lush lens of Barnes, who perfectly frames Barbara Stanwyck and Wendell Corey in a California of palm trees and ocean views, and long lanes and lookouts over the city at night. Beautifully lit and photographed, it is one of the finest examples of noir  cinematography in a film from this period. Victor Young's lovely score for this film compliments it perfectly, and might be one of the best ones you've never heard. Johnny Mercer once stated that you always knew when Victor was in the studio just by the tone of the violin and strings. That romantic touch is in evidence with perhaps his finest score outside of The Uninvited, which produced the beautiful Stella by Starlight. In many ways, this is a minor masterpiece. The lush romance of the first half gives way to the darker aspects of love and crime in the second, only to return in the final moments.Wendell Corey is Cleve Marshall. The Assistant D.A. is avoiding going home to his wife and kids because of his meddling father-in-law. His wife is nice, but too much daddy's girl, emasculating the husband she loves and leaving him vulnerable to the understanding Stanwyck. She walks into his office when he's tight, to ask the police for extra protection at her aunt's house. Seeing he's a decent guy, despite his current state, his charm convinces her to take him for a drink, Though nothing happens, the match has been lit, and soon the flame burns bright blue and orange. Secret meetings between them are all beautifully photographed in noir style while Young's music frames the forbidden romance. Stanwyck underplays her role, giving her a softer shading than usual for this type of film, and it works well. Wendell Corey never achieved big star status, but does an excellent job here opposite one.One night Thelma's aunt in murdered during a break-in and everything changes. A rushed attempt by Cleve and Thelma to alter the crime scene goes south, and suspicion falls immediately on her. Her past with a gambler named Tony, a man seen running from the house, and a will leaving everything to Thelma force his office to charge her with murder. Knowing he's the mystery man seen with her, he craftily manipulates the jury after wangling the prosecutor's chair through less than aboveboard means, hoping he can subtly sabotage the trial in her favor. That's when the film begins anew. For those who think they've seen this all before, there is a terrific twist at the end, with a return to the more romantic framing which had disappeared during the drama of the trial.Ketty Frings' screenplay, based on a Marty Holland story, has a realism which works nicely with the tone Siodmak sets. Paul Kelly as Corey's pal, and Joan Tetzel as his young wife both acquit themselves nicely. Stanley Ridges as the wily lawyer for Stanwyck who knows exactly what's going on between Thelma and Cleve is excellent. Fine, underplayed performances, sympathetic characters, and a terrific mood set by director Siodmak make this one a real winner. Highly recommended.",5,"""The left hand never lets the right hand know....""",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,4224,"['Maybe', 'am', 'just', 'dame', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'like', 'being', 'picked', 'up', 'guy', 'binge', 'Stanwyck', 'CoreyComing', 'somewhat', 'late', 'noir', 'cycle', 'long', 'neglected', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'deserving', 'praise', 'given', 'many', 'lesser', 'films', 'genre', 'have', 'been', 'critically', 're-evaluated', 'finding', 'wider', 'following', 'video', 'dvd', 'File', 'Thelma', 'Jordan', 'beautiful', 'score', 'Victor', 'Young', 'lush', 'photography', 'George', 'Barnes', 'good', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Siodmak', 'placing', 'one', 'upper', 'echelon', 'late', '1940', 'film', 'noir', 'Robert', 'Siodmak', 'brother', 'Curt', 'began', 'career', 'silent', 'films', 'was', 'forced', 'flee', 'Germany', 'war', 'landing', 'first', 'Paris', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'found', 'niche', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'thrillers', 'such', 'Spiral', 'Staircase', 'Dark', 'Mirror', 'Suspect', 'noir', 'specialist', 'File', 'Thelma', 'Jordan', 'atmospheric', 'entertaining', 'film', 'director', 'ever', 'made', 'shame', 'excellent', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'film', 'been', 'collecting', 'dust', 'basement', 'studio', 'rather', 'receiving', 'wide', 'release', 'marvelous', 'mood', 'noir', 'romance', 'immediately', 'set', 'Victor', 'Young', 'orchestra', 'lush', 'lens', 'Barnes', 'who', 'perfectly', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'California', 'palm', 'trees', 'ocean', 'views', 'long', 'lanes', 'city', 'night', 'Beautifully', 'lit', 'photographed', 'one', 'finest', 'examples', 'noir', 'cinematography', 'film', 'period', 'Victor', 'Young', 'lovely', 'score', 'film', 'perfectly', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'once', 'stated', 'always', 'knew', 'when', 'Victor', 'was', 'studio', 'just', 'tone', 'violin', 'strings', 'romantic', 'touch', 'evidence', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'score', 'Uninvited', 'produced', 'beautiful', 'Stella', 'Starlight', 'many', 'ways', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'lush', 'romance', 'first', 'half', 'way', 'darker', 'aspects', 'love', 'crime', 'second', 'only', 'return', 'final', 'moments.Wendell', 'Corey', 'Cleve', 'Marshall', 'Assistant', 'D.A', 'avoiding', 'going', 'home', 'wife', 'kids', 'meddling', 'father-in-law', 'wife', 'nice', 'too', 'much', 'daddy', 'girl', 'emasculating', 'husband', 'leaving', 'vulnerable', 'understanding', 'Stanwyck', 'walks', 'office', 'when', 'tight', 'ask', 'police', 'extra', 'protection', 'aunt', 'house', 'Seeing', 'decent', 'guy', 'current', 'state', 'charm', 'take', 'drink', 'nothing', 'happens', 'match', 'been', 'lit', 'soon', 'flame', 'bright', 'blue', 'orange', 'Secret', 'meetings', 'are', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'noir', 'style', 'Young', 'music', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'Stanwyck', 'role', 'giving', 'softer', 'shading', 'usual', 'type', 'film', 'well', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'never', 'achieved', 'big', 'star', 'status', 'excellent', 'job', 'here', 'opposite', 'one.One', 'night', 'Thelma', 'aunt', 'murdered', 'break-in', 'everything', 'changes', 'rushed', 'attempt', 'Cleve', 'Thelma', 'alter', 'crime', 'scene', 'south', 'suspicion', 'immediately', 'past', 'gambler', 'named', 'Tony', 'man', 'seen', 'running', 'house', 'will', 'leaving', 'everything', 'Thelma', 'force', 'office', 'charge', 'murder', 'Knowing', 'mystery', 'man', 'seen', 'craftily', 'jury', 'wangling', 'prosecutor', 'chair', 'less', 'aboveboard', 'means', 'hoping', 'can', 'subtly', 'sabotage', 'trial', 'favor', 'when', 'film', 'anew', 'who', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'terrific', 'twist', 'end', 'return', 'more', 'romantic', 'framing', 'had', 'disappeared', 'drama', 'trial.Ketty', 'Frings', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Marty', 'Holland', 'story', 'realism', 'nicely', 'tone', 'Siodmak', 'sets', 'Paul', 'Kelly', 'Corey', 'pal', 'Joan', 'Tetzel', 'young', 'wife', 'acquit', 'nicely', 'Stanley', 'Ridges', 'wily', 'lawyer', 'Stanwyck', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'Thelma', 'Cleve', 'excellent', 'Fine', 'underplayed', 'performances', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'terrific', 'mood', 'set', 'director', 'Siodmak', 'make', 'one', 'real', 'winner', 'Highly', 'recommended']",The File on Thelma Jordan; VHS Video

If you refer back to the product most of the reviewers bought, it was produced by some outfit I've never heard of before, which means they probably took some old VHS transfer off of the old AMC and stuck it in a VHS/DVD converter and voila. I have over a dozen of the classic Olive DVDs, and this one is on the way - it was just released a few days ago. Every classic DVD I've received produced by Olive has been a great transfer with great sound. You couldn't ask for more. Well, I could ask for extra features and commentary, but in the age of MOD and streaming, I'm just not going to get that.As for the film itself, it's an interesting twist on an old story - bored and ignored married man meets femme fatale. Except this time the married man is a local prosecutor and the femme fatale winds up accused of murder on his watch. It is very much worth your while, as is anything Ms. Stanwyck is in, even if it is just to watch Ms. Stanwyck.

THE FILE ON THELMA JORDANis currently available only on video tape.Thelma Jordan, as played by Barbara Stanwyck,  appears after office hours one night at the District Attorney's office and encounters the assistant DA, Cleve Marshall, played by Wendell Corey, who is on a recreational bender while  trying to avoid going home and facing his overbearing father-in-law. After a series of amusing incidents, the pair are seriously attracted to each other although Cleve Marshall seems to realize that Thelma Jordan is not showing him all her cards.As the movie and the affair progress we see that Thelma may still be involved with her ex, an all around no goodnick named Tony Lorado played by Richard Rober.Thelma lives with her wealthy, elderly  aunt and one night, when the house is burglarized and it turns out the aunt is shot and killed, Thelma turns to Cleve for help.  It doesn't take long for Thelma to be accused of the crime and it is now up to Cleve to throw ethics and legal standards aside to use every trick in the book to help his lover beat  what he believes is an unjust accusation.This movie is fairly suspenseful as well as entertaining and even though the conclusion is not a gigantic surprise, it is engaging in as a pleasant a way a noir murder mystery can be, I guess you could say.Or to put it another way, THE FILE ON THELMA JORDAN is a professionally done entertainment that achieves its goals without too much strain or emotional involvement neccesary by the viewer.THE FILE ON THELMA JORDAN is well acted and moves along quite efficiently, it is certainly worth seeing but probably not one of those films that you will remember long after seeing it.  I give THE FILE ON THELMA JORDAN a Four Star rating.",4,"File This, Please",1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,1875,"['review', '1950', 'Hal', 'Wallis', 'Production', 'released', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'THE', 'FILE', 'ON', 'THELMA', 'JORDAN', 'was', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Siodmak', 'THE', 'FILE', 'ON', 'THELMA', 'JORDANis', 'currently', 'available', 'only', 'video', 'tape.Thelma', 'Jordan', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'office', 'hours', 'one', 'night', 'District', 'Attorney', 'office', 'assistant', 'DA', 'Cleve', 'Marshall', 'played', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'who', 'recreational', 'bender', 'trying', 'avoid', 'going', 'home', 'facing', 'overbearing', 'father-in-law', 'series', 'amusing', 'incidents', 'pair', 'are', 'seriously', 'attracted', 'other', 'Cleve', 'Marshall', 'realize', 'Thelma', 'Jordan', 'not', 'showing', 'cards.As', 'movie', 'affair', 'progress', 'see', 'Thelma', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'involved', 'ex', 'goodnick', 'named', 'Tony', 'Lorado', 'played', 'Richard', 'Rober.Thelma', 'wealthy', 'elderly', 'aunt', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'house', 'burglarized', 'out', 'aunt', 'shot', 'killed', 'Thelma', 'Cleve', 'help', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Thelma', 'be', 'accused', 'crime', 'now', 'up', 'Cleve', 'throw', 'ethics', 'legal', 'standards', 'aside', 'use', 'trick', 'book', 'help', 'lover', 'beat', 'what', 'unjust', 'accusation.This', 'movie', 'fairly', 'suspenseful', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'even', 'conclusion', 'not', 'gigantic', 'surprise', 'engaging', 'pleasant', 'way', 'noir', 'murder', 'mystery', 'can', 'be', 'guess', 'could', 'say.Or', 'put', 'way', 'THE', 'FILE', 'ON', 'THELMA', 'JORDAN', 'professionally', 'done', 'entertainment', 'goals', 'too', 'much', 'strain', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'neccesary', 'viewer.THE', 'FILE', 'ON', 'THELMA', 'JORDAN', 'well', 'acted', 'moves', 'quite', 'efficiently', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'probably', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'remember', 'long', 'seeing', 'give', 'FILE', 'ON', 'THELMA', 'JORDAN', 'Four', 'Star', 'rating']",The File on Thelma Jordan; VHS Video
