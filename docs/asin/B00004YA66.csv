558842,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,B00004YA66,absent_minded_prof,"[3, 3]","In Frequency, Dennis Quaid is a firefighter in Queens, in 1969.  His son John, at 6 years of age, dreams of one day becoming a police officer.  Due to some kind of bizarre transgression of the laws of physics, associated with unusually prominent aurora borealis, he and his adult son John find themselves communicating by shortwave radio, from 1969 to 1999, and back.  John saves his fathers life, by warning him about an impending disaster he will face in a burning building.  But somehow, something about this act has changed history, and caused a psychotic killer to continue killing, although in the normal course of events he would have died, thereby ceasing his activities.  Together, Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel must find the killer, and stop him, before he kills their respective wife and mother.I found this to be quite an enjoyable thriller.  The mere fact of having the father (Quaid) be an incredibly brave fireman, and the son (Caviezel) be a homicide detective, guarantees plenty of action right off the bat.  The shortwave radio is a cool little device, it worked for me.  There are a few scenes where the director shoots slow motion sequences of falling objects from the past and present simultaneously, leaving their synchronicitous moment of impact to imply a change in history.  This was slightly overdone, I thought, but still basically effective.  I really enjoyed some parts of the soundtrack, particularly the song played during the closing credits.  All the supporting actors are very good as well.  Noah Emmerich reprises his trademark role as the protagonists buddy, constantly offering brewskis, which he perfected in The Truman Show, and in Beautiful Girls.By the way, the physics professor they show being interviewed on television by Dick Cavett, to explain the aurora, is apparently named after a real superstring theorist, named Brian Greene.  Anyone out there who enjoys the science part of this movie, and would like to learn more, should look for Brian Greenes very readable book, The Elegant Universe.Basically, this is a very fun thriller.

(A son makes contact with his deceased father 30 in the past using an old ham radio.)  It works for this movie.  After the son of a firefighter learns he can communicate with his father through an old radio, he warns his father of his impending death, and thus changes history.  While this bodes well for them, others soon become victims of a serial killer, who had disappeared before their interference with time.  Father and son work together to solve the mystery of the serial killings, racing against the clock to save a loved one who is now to be the next victim.This movie is a fantasy.  It's about family, and how being ripped apart from the ones you love can affect your life.  It's a heartwarming story, filled with suspense, action, humor, and drama.

Through the miracle of the Aurora Borealis (how many of THOSE do you see in New York?), they manage to talk to each other through the ages. Through this communication, John saves his father's life, but he changes history so that a famous murderer is back on the lam, and he is going to kill John's wife. So far, so good.

I was a successul mixture of suspense, action, Science Fiction, drama and a father-son realtionship movie.  What best descibes the excitment of ""Frequency is the idea it asks...what if?What if you had the opportunity to communicate with a family member, that's been dead for 30 years?  What would you say?  What would you do?  And what if you had the opportunity to change the past and the future?  John Francis ""Little Chief"" Sullivan, portrayed by the talented Jim Caviezel (""The Count of Monte Cristo"", ""Angel Eyes""), is a 36-year old police detective who's going through a period in his life where time is a bad one.  His girlfriend just left him and his job is not cutting him any slack.  On the night of the 30th aniversary of John's father's death, a fire-fighter who died 30 years ago in a warehouse fire, the Aroura Boleias spreads over Queens, New York, where John lives in the house he lived in as a kid.  He then finds his dad's old HAM radio in the closet, which is uses soon enough.  He comes into contact with a mysterious person who claims to be Frank Patrick Sullivan, John's dad.  Little does John know is that he IS John's dad!!!  Apparently, the Northern lights transmitted the frequency from the radio, all the way back to 1969!  Frank, played by acclaimed actor Dennis Quaid,is a 1960's fire fighter, the night before his death, when he contacts John in the future.  John ultimately warns his father about his death and he avoids the catastrophe.  John's life is then radically changed.  Every night, he talks to his Dad over on the radio, which he hasn't talk to in over 30 years.  But the next night after they mae contact, John makes a shocking discovery that his Mother,Julia Sullivan (Elizabeth Mitchell) was murdered only weeks later in Frank's time.  John and Frank now must chase after the murderer before it happens to Jules, in order for them to live a life they dreampt of.""Frequency"" is a touching and fast paced story that never ceases to stop entertaining.

We all know that time travel in this day and age is not possible so Frequency takes an uncommon event to try and explain how it has suddenly became possible. But what was needed is an explanation as to why different time periods could essentially be happening at the same time (for a better and more entertaining look at this concept, read Michael Crighton's Timeline), and there is a good explanation that could be covered in a few minutes. While the movie was based on a good idea, and it had some exciting moments, the script left something to be desired. The picture perfect ending is what completely ruined the movie for me (just like the ending to the Waterboy). Michael Eisner had to be involved. There were some good scenes, especially when Quaid finds a way to escape the fire and when James Caviesel escapes from the Police Interrogation room, but other than that the movie goes on with unexplained events and unestablished relationships between characters (what ever happened to his live-in girlfiend?).

558853,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00004YA66,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I'll say this first off; I really like this movie a lot.  When I first saw it in the theater I was in awe with it.  Sure, I'm not in `awe' anymore, but after watching this movie again last night for like the twentieth time I can definitely say that it still warms my heart.  I still get that same feeling every time I hear that Garth Brooks song start to play in the closing of this film; the tears welling in the eyes and this overwhelming happiness comes over me.  That said I must admit that this movie has its detractors, they just aren't enough to make me forsake the entire experience.The concept behind `Frequency' is one we've seen done many times before and after.  The idea of changing the past is something that intrigues all of us I'm sure since there isn't one person on the face of the planet without regrets.  So here we have John Sullivan; a thirty-six year old man who lost his father thirty years ago in a fire.  His father Frank was a brave fireman who died saving a young girl from a burning warehouse.  This tragedy has destroyed John.  He walks around like a zombie with no cares in life whatsoever.  He still lives in his father's house, the house he grew up in, the house he never left.  It's interesting to me that his mother has since moved out but John stays behind, maybe further addressing the fact that John is the only one who has never moved on or recovered from his fathers death.  He stays in the past in everyway possible.  One night his best friend's son finds Frank's old ham radio and after tinkering with it John finds that he is able to contact a familiar voice from the past, his father.  He soon realizes that he has the opportunity to save his father, to rewrite the past but when he does his future is also rewritten.One thing that I love about `Frequency' is that it works at being a better film than it could have been.  It could have merely been a film about a son contacting his dead father and working to save his life, but it does more than that.  With an intricately woven sub-plot involving a serial killer from the past who was never caught `Frequency' manages to keep the audience at the edge of their seats throughout the running time.  That is a huge plus.  It adds layers of intensity that would not have been there otherwise.As far as the acting is concerned, Quaid steals the show.  I've always been a fan of this man.  He's a very talented actor who never gets the credit or the film roles he deserves.  He grabs a hold of Frank Sullivan with all he has and delivers the standout performance here.  He masters his accent beautifully, which is essential in this type of role.  Elizabeth Mitchell likewise delivers a beautiful performance.  She shows a lot of depth even though she has limited screen time and is obviously taking a backseat to the two leading men.  Shawn Doyle also delivers, sending shivers down my spine as the suspected killer, and Andre Braugher pulls off an impressive supporting performance as Satch DeLeon, Frank's close friend and John's eventual boss.The biggest detractor for me though is James Caviezel.  I've never been too impressed with this actor but here he manages to bore me to tears.  I feel nothing from him.  His `depressed' John is so overly dramatized that he comes across irritating and unsympathetic.  I don't understand why anyone would want to be around him.  He's gloomy and moody and whiney and just a complete and utter mess.  James could have played him differently, could have played him better.  Sure, after he rescues his father he changes his demeanor a bit but it's too little too late for me.  The second half of his performance is far better than the first, I will say that.`Frequency' manages though to still hold merit with me.  It's a much deeper film than it lets on to be and has the ability to touch the heart and warm the soul.  The final moments of the film, filled with this heart racing intensity are flawlessly performed and only add weight to the emotionally uplifting baseball game that closes this touching family film.  `Frequency' is a film about love and loss and that desired reconnection with loved ones; a chance to right wrongs and make better decision; a film about getting the chance to live again the consequences and responsibilities that lie within that chance.  In that respect `Frequency' works on a much greater level than one might expect and deserves to be seen and admired and talked about.",4,Deep and meaningful; a film that is bound to touch and inspire you...,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,4435,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'first', 'really', 'movie', 'lot', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'theater', 'was', 'awe', 'Sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'awe', 'anymore', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'twentieth', 'time', 'can', 'definitely', 'say', 'still', 'heart', 'still', 'get', 'same', 'feeling', 'time', 'hear', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'song', 'start', 'play', 'closing', 'film', 'tears', 'welling', 'eyes', 'overwhelming', 'happiness', 'said', 'must', 'admit', 'movie', 'detractors', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'forsake', 'entire', 'experience.The', 'concept', 'Frequency', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'idea', 'changing', 'past', 'something', ""'m"", 'sure', ""n't"", 'one', 'person', 'face', 'planet', 'regrets', 'So', 'here', 'have', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'thirty-six', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'father', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'fire', 'father', 'Frank', 'was', 'brave', 'fireman', 'who', 'died', 'saving', 'young', 'girl', 'burning', 'warehouse', 'tragedy', 'destroyed', 'John', 'zombie', 'cares', 'life', 'whatsoever', 'still', 'father', 'house', 'house', 'grew', 'up', 'house', 'never', 'left', 'interesting', 'mother', 'moved', 'out', 'John', 'maybe', 'further', 'addressing', 'fact', 'John', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'moved', 'recovered', 'fathers', 'death', 'past', 'everyway', 'possible', 'One', 'night', 'best', 'friend', 'son', 'Frank', 'old', 'ham', 'radio', 'tinkering', 'John', 'able', 'contact', 'familiar', 'voice', 'past', 'father', 'soon', 'opportunity', 'save', 'father', 'rewrite', 'past', 'when', 'future', 'also', 'rewritten.One', 'thing', 'love', 'Frequency', 'being', 'better', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'could', 'have', 'merely', 'been', 'film', 'son', 'contacting', 'dead', 'father', 'working', 'save', 'life', 'more', 'intricately', 'woven', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'serial', 'killer', 'past', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'Frequency', 'manages', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats', 'running', 'time', 'huge', 'plus', 'layers', 'intensity', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'otherwise.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'Quaid', 'show', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'man', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'never', 'credit', 'film', 'grabs', 'hold', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'standout', 'performance', 'here', 'accent', 'beautifully', 'essential', 'type', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'lot', 'depth', 'even', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'obviously', 'taking', 'backseat', 'two', 'leading', 'men', 'Shawn', 'Doyle', 'also', 'sending', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'suspected', 'killer', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Satch', 'DeLeon', 'Frank', 'close', 'friend', 'John', 'eventual', 'boss.The', 'biggest', 'detractor', 'James', 'Caviezel', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'too', 'impressed', 'actor', 'here', 'bore', 'tears', 'feel', 'nothing', 'depressed', 'John', 'so', 'overly', 'dramatized', 'irritating', 'unsympathetic', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'gloomy', 'moody', 'whiney', 'just', 'complete', 'utter', 'mess', 'James', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'differently', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'better', 'Sure', 'father', 'demeanor', 'bit', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'second', 'half', 'performance', 'far', 'better', 'first', 'will', 'say', 'that.', 'Frequency', 'manages', 'still', 'hold', 'merit', 'much', 'deeper', 'film', 'be', 'ability', 'touch', 'heart', 'warm', 'soul', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'filled', 'heart', 'racing', 'intensity', 'are', 'flawlessly', 'performed', 'only', 'add', 'weight', 'emotionally', 'uplifting', 'baseball', 'game', 'touching', 'family', 'film', 'Frequency', 'film', 'love', 'loss', 'desired', 'reconnection', 'loved', 'ones', 'chance', 'right', 'wrongs', 'make', 'better', 'decision', 'film', 'getting', 'chance', 'live', 'again', 'consequences', 'responsibilities', 'lie', 'chance', 'respect', 'Frequency', 'works', 'much', 'greater', 'level', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'deserves', 'be', 'seen', 'admired', 'talked']",Frequency (DVD)

So, I kept my eyes open for its release on video, at which point, I snatched it up and brought it home.  I was not disappointed.  This is the kind of movie they just don't make anymore.  Nowadays, you can usually watch a bit of a movie and predict the end.  I tried to do that with Frequency, but it just didn't work.  Every time I THOUGHT I had it figured out, they changed something in the past, which changed something in the future, making my idea of the ending not possible.  I never did guess the ending and was thrilled and surprised when it came.  I was also thrilled to have watched a movie that could keep me in suspense right up to the end, not to mention a movie that was about nice people who loved each other in what some would consider a &quot;mundane&quot; lifestyle.  There are no penthouses or personal jets or other typical elements of modern movies.  This is about real people in extraordinary circumstances.For those who have lost a parent, this movie is about miracles and wish-fulfillment.  We cheer and cry that these two find each other over the years.  Watching the movie, I didn't like John, the son, much at the beginning, but I watched him soften and become more likeable as he gets to know the father who he lost as a child.There are so many aspects of this movie that you just have to see it to catch them all.

That's exactly the basis for this film. However, detective John Sullivan did not realize just how grave the consequences would become after doing just that by using his deceased father's ham-wave radio!From here on the real ride takes flight with several unsolved serial killings intertwined ! No pun intended, but time is of the essence in catching the killer and righting a wrong...This is one of the first time altering sci- fi movies that can pull at the viewer's emotions or heartstrings when you realize that most of us in a heartbeat would love to have another chance with our dearly departed. The acting by Dennis Quaid is a genuine stellar performance. Jim Caviezel portrays his role perfectly as a man still emotionally and psychologically haunted by his father's death. His character walks through life in a half-awake,depressed, somber state while letting others sort of trample on him.Every aspect of this film with regards to story,acting,effects are astonishing !

And the story moves nicely throughout the movie, with few dull spots. However, when dealing with the heart-tugging subject of a father and son who meet under extraordinary circumstance, you have to expect some sappy and cheesy moments. The less sentimental will laugh at the corniness, but the scenes are undoubtedly moving for all around me I could hear the sniffles of grown men and women alike.Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel are adorable together as the father and son crime solvers that tug on your heart strings, evoking compassion from the audience even in their weaker moments. The supporting cast is one to be commended, for they are full of flavor and humanity and deliver some choice lines. All together, a strong cast that livens up and adds character to a potentially tired story.While this is not the most original movie to come out this year, it is still a good watch. There is enough drama to keep you emotionally invovled, and enough suspense to make me frightened when I walked home at night.....But I'll warn you that if you have an aversion to pure sentimental cheese, leave before the Garth Brooks song starts and the credits begin to role.",4,Frequency mystery/suspense,976579200,"12 12, 2000",2000,1944,"['Voices', 'travelling', 'time', 'murder', 'mystery', 'father', 'son', 'reunions', 'aurora', 'borealous', '.if', 'are', 'willing', 'forgive', 'cheese', 'ham', 'radio', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fine', 'time.Frequency', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'variety', 'pretty', 'average', 'themes', 'altogether', 'interesting', 'way', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'predictable', 'even', 'father-son', 'meeting', 'time', 'barrier', 'not', 'newest', 'idea', 'still', 'pretty', 'cool', 'one', 'usage', 'two', 'characters', 'solve', 'murders', 'past', 'can', 'find', 'murderer', 'present', 'stop', 'past', 'know', 'kind', 'confusing', 'extremely', 'well', 'communicated', 'story', 'interesting', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'nicely', 'movie', 'few', 'dull', 'spots', 'However', 'when', 'dealing', 'heart-tugging', 'subject', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'have', 'expect', 'sappy', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'less', 'sentimental', 'will', 'laugh', 'corniness', 'scenes', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'moving', 'could', 'hear', 'sniffles', 'grown', 'men', 'women', 'alike.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'are', 'adorable', 'together', 'father', 'son', 'crime', 'solvers', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'evoking', 'compassion', 'audience', 'even', 'weaker', 'moments', 'supporting', 'cast', 'one', 'be', 'commended', 'are', 'full', 'flavor', 'humanity', 'deliver', 'choice', 'lines', 'together', 'strong', 'cast', 'up', 'character', 'potentially', 'tired', 'story.While', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'still', 'good', 'watch', 'enough', 'drama', 'keep', 'emotionally', 'invovled', 'enough', 'suspense', 'make', 'frightened', 'when', 'walked', 'home', 'night', '..But', ""'ll"", 'warn', 'have', 'aversion', 'pure', 'sentimental', 'cheese', 'leave', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'song', 'starts', 'credits', 'begin', 'role']",Frequency (DVD)

Quite original thinking behind this story.Dennis Quaid plays a heroic fireman and a loving husband and father in the past.  James Caviezel portrays his adult son in the future.  James Caviezel character is tragic, sad because he misses his father who died in a fire when he was young.  The story affords James' character to save Dennis by telling him how he would die and how to avoid it.  How does he communicates with his dead father?  Watch the film.  It's quite simple.  By doing so, the consequences goes beyond what they imagined, and the story really takes off from that point on.The story is great for popcorn on the sofa at home.

And if you did, would he believe you? This is the dilemma for John Sullivan, (Jim Caviezel) a thirty-something Queens detective who has spent the last thirty years lamenting the loss of his fire fighting father (played by Dennis Quaid). Through some vaguely explained phenomenon they begin to talk through time over his dad's old ham radio. As they talk, and the reality of his fathers looming demise sets in, John warns his father about event that are about to unfold. Skeptical at first, John's father Frank, quickly becomes a believer. Franks escapes the terrible fire, but the repercussions on the future are shocking and unexpected. I won't tell you what these repercussions are, but I will tell you they are very interesting and thought provoking.&quot;Frequency&quot; does a good job of exploring the &quot;what if&quot; factor, but also stresses the &quot;No man should know too much about his future.&quot; princible. Quaid and Caviezel develop a pretty good chemistry as father and son, and the emotion between them seems real enough. (Though the New York accents seem a little too thick at times) I have two problems with &quot;Frequency&quot;; the first is that it takes a little too long to get going which is a product of such a far-fetched story. It takes a lot of up front information to get the audience up to speed. But having said that, once the story does take off it keeps you interested. The second is just a couple of time line inconsistencies that I had trouble explaining, but then again maybe that's just me. All things considered, I did like and enjoy the movie, and even more the second time I watched it. If you do watch this film I would recommend watching it twice.

The film's original promos played up the 'change your destiny' aspect of the plot more than the father-son bond, and I guess I thought there'd be some souped-up DeLorean auto waiting in the wings to whisk characters somewhere every 10 minutes. But this film is nothing like that. I lost my mother sixteen years ago and have only bonded stronger with my dad since then, and as such, really relate to the film's subtler message of re-affirming ties with those you love the most. It doesn't hit immediately. When detective Jim Caviezel first speaks to fireman Dennis Quaid, they are understandably confused and pseudo-annoyed with each other, because they do not yet understand what has happened between them. Later, of course, the 30-year paradox is revealed, and a new relationship emerges after Quaid survives a potentially life-ending fire. The duo-logue which follows between father and son over the ham radio is a breathtaking scene, and when it comes to an end (""I'm almost afraid to turn this off- like we won't get this back""), I'm a tearful mess, every single time.

The film is an expertly directed piece of entertainment that will have viewers so absorbed in its thrilling story that they may have trouble coming back to reality after the end credits have rolled.The film, which was written by Toby Emmerich, explores what happens if a person could alter the past by communicating through time. And while dealing with such heady quantum conundrums, the story also allows for moments of genuine emotion.Troubled New York detective John Sullivan's life is changed forever when he contacts his father, Frank Sullivan, with an old ham radio. What makes their reunion so extraordinary is the fact that Frank died in a fire thirty years earlier. When John realizes that the Aurora Borealis (or Northern Lights) is enabling him to communicate with his father in 1969, he warns him of his death, thus giving Frank the opportunity to save himself and change the future. But altering the timeline proves to be complicated and dangerous as the Sullivan family soon finds out. When John discovers that his effect on the past has changed the future sequence of events, resulting in his mother's death at the hands of a serial killer in 1969, he must uncover the truth about who killed her so that his father can stop her murder before it happens. Utilizing his detective skills, John guides his father on a search for the killer, but the more they disrupt the course of events in the past, the more they find themselves endangered in the future. It's not long before the entire Sullivan family is under threat and their only hope for a life together is dependent upon Frank's resourcefulness and John's guidance. Can they solve the murder of John's mother before she's killed or will they be forced to watch as their temporal interference costs them that which they hold dearest; their family?The film stars Dennis Quaid as Frank Sullivan and Jim Caviezel as John Sullivan. The supporting cast includes Andre Braugher, Elizabeth Mitchell, Shawn Doyle, and Noah Emmerich (the screenwriter's brother). Both Quaid and Caviezel give strong performances, as does the entire cast. Adding to the power of the performances is the subtle aging makeup that it is skillfully applied to the actors to help viewers differentiate between the characters in 1969 and 1999.One of the things that makes Frequency truly unique is that it manages to root itself in the foundations of multiple genres. Being part science fiction, part murder mystery, and part family drama, the film could have easily fallen apart if it weren't for the concentrated efforts of its director.Another interesting aspect of the film is that it's essentially a time travel film in which no one actually travels through time. Only information is relayed back and forth through the ham radio, which limits the opportunities for action and the visual effects set pieces while heightening the suspense.Now the film isn't perfect. There are some serious flaws in the story's logic when it comes to quantum physics and the disruption of the space-time continuum, but the story is absorbing enough that this shouldn't bother many viewers.Also adding to the film's overall impact is the exciting score by master film composer Michael Kamen, who combines taut, suspenseful musical cues with haunting themes that echo the emotions of the characters.All in all, Frequency is an exhilarating thriller that should not be forgotten.The excellent DVD includes an audio commentary by director Gregory Hoblit, an audio commentary by writer Toby Emmerich and actor Noah Emmerich, a trivia track, The Science Behind Frequency documentary, deleted scenes, image galleries, and more.Also recommended:Back to the Future - The Complete TrilogyFlight of the NavigatorThe AbyssSeven12 MonkeysContactPiThe Matrix",4,Echoes Through Time,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,3921,"['thriller', 'Frequency', 'directed', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'Primal', 'FearandFallen', 'audiences', 'were', 'given', 'unexpectedly', 'well-made', 'science', 'fiction/suspense', 'film', 'film', 'expertly', 'directed', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'will', 'have', 'viewers', 'so', 'absorbed', 'thrilling', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'coming', 'back', 'reality', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled.The', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Toby', 'Emmerich', 'what', 'person', 'could', 'alter', 'past', 'communicating', 'time', 'dealing', 'such', 'heady', 'quantum', 'conundrums', 'story', 'also', 'moments', 'genuine', 'emotion.Troubled', 'New', 'York', 'detective', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'when', 'father', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'old', 'ham', 'radio', 'What', 'reunion', 'extraordinary', 'fact', 'Frank', 'died', 'fire', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier', 'When', 'John', 'Aurora', 'Borealis', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'enabling', 'communicate', 'father', '1969', 'death', 'thus', 'giving', 'Frank', 'opportunity', 'save', 'change', 'future', 'altering', 'timeline', 'be', 'complicated', 'dangerous', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'soon', 'out', 'When', 'John', 'effect', 'past', 'changed', 'future', 'sequence', 'events', 'resulting', 'mother', 'death', 'hands', 'serial', 'killer', '1969', 'must', 'uncover', 'truth', 'who', 'killed', 'so', 'father', 'can', 'stop', 'murder', 'Utilizing', 'detective', 'skills', 'John', 'father', 'search', 'killer', 'more', 'disrupt', 'course', 'events', 'past', 'more', 'find', 'endangered', 'future', 'not', 'long', 'entire', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'threat', 'only', 'hope', 'life', 'together', 'dependent', 'Frank', 'resourcefulness', 'John', 'guidance', 'Can', 'solve', 'murder', 'John', 'mother', 'killed', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'temporal', 'interference', 'costs', 'hold', 'dearest', 'family', 'film', 'stars', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'Shawn', 'Doyle', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'screenwriter', 'brother', 'Quaid', 'Caviezel', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Adding', 'power', 'performances', 'subtle', 'aging', 'makeup', 'skillfully', 'applied', 'actors', 'help', 'viewers', 'differentiate', 'characters', '1969', '1999.One', 'things', 'Frequency', 'truly', 'unique', 'root', 'foundations', 'multiple', 'genres', 'Being', 'part', 'science', 'fiction', 'part', 'murder', 'mystery', 'part', 'family', 'drama', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fallen', 'apart', 'were', ""n't"", 'concentrated', 'efforts', 'director.Another', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'essentially', 'time', 'travel', 'film', 'one', 'actually', 'time', 'Only', 'information', 'relayed', 'back', 'forth', 'ham', 'radio', 'opportunities', 'action', 'visual', 'effects', 'set', 'pieces', 'heightening', 'suspense.Now', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'are', 'serious', 'flaws', 'story', 'logic', 'when', 'quantum', 'physics', 'disruption', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'story', 'absorbing', 'enough', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'many', 'viewers.Also', 'adding', 'film', 'overall', 'impact', 'exciting', 'score', 'master', 'film', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'who', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'musical', 'cues', 'haunting', 'themes', 'echo', 'emotions', 'characters.All', 'Frequency', 'exhilarating', 'thriller', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten.The', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer', 'Toby', 'Emmerich', 'actor', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'trivia', 'track', 'Science', 'Behind', 'Frequency', 'documentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'image', 'galleries', 'more.Also', 'recommended', 'Back', 'Future', 'Complete', 'TrilogyFlight', 'NavigatorThe', 'AbyssSeven12', 'MonkeysContactPiThe', 'Matrix']",Frequency (DVD)

He is a firefighter, and while out on a call dies.His death affects John deeply. In 1999 John is a cop working with Satch-who was one of Franks good friends. They uncover a body of a woman who was murdered by the ""nightingale"" Murderer about the time of Franks death-which forces them to reopen the case.In both 1969 and 1999 there is a solar flare. In 1969 Frank comments to someone on his ham radio that he can talk to people that he normally would not be able to because of the flare.In 1999- days before the 30th anniversary of Frank's death- John's friend Gordo finds the ham radio and they plug it in. Soon John is talking to someone on the radio.This movie is about the relationship between a father and son that spans time and death.After several conversations John realizes that he is actually talking to his dad-and he warns him about the fire that kills him-not realizing that by doing that it will change the past in ways neither of them can imagine.One way was the nightingale murderer. In the first history he only killed 3 women, but after Frank survives it turned out he killed many more.

FREQUENCY is based on the idea of shifts in reality occurring in the present as a direct result of communications over short wave radio between a police detective here in this present time (Jim Caviezel) and his father in the past (Dennis Quaid) during times of heightened solar flare activity.This movie works because it is internally consistent, even as it stretches one's concept of what can be possible. I enjoyed watching this movie on several levels, as the father and son get to know each other by talking on a ham radio during a spectacular display of northern lights... and race to stop a killer before he strikes again.I especially enjoyed the way the police detective in the film describes how it feels to have several different memories after reality shifts. In one scene, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) talks with his dad, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), on a ham radio.  John describes how he recalls both the memories of how his father died in a burning warehouse and also the memories of how his dad rescued a woman and emerged unscathed from that same fire.  John says in amazement, &quot;I remember both... at the same time. It's like waking up from a dream and you're not sure what's real. I remember you being here, but I also remember when you weren't.&quot;This film is especially meaningful for anyone seeking insight into that phenomenon when your keys, purse, or sock aren't where you know you left them.

But director Gregory Hoblit has no intention of letting this movie sit on it's laurels or to rely so heavily on this sentimental tripe we've been forced to endure too many times.  Like Pleasantville it gentally tugs at our idealic recolections of the past before blantantly tearing them down before our eyes.  That's when things really pick up and we realize that this isn't the movie New Line'd built it up as being.  It's an edge of your seat thrill ride with intesity to spare and not the weepy overdone meaning-of-life story we've seen done to death since Titanic.  Realitively unknown actor Jim Caviezel plays a New York cop still scared by the the loss of his firefighter dad (Dennis Quaid) thirty years ago.  We bounce back and forth between time as both 1969 and 1999 are unfolding parrellel to eachother.  One night while playing with his father's old ham radio Caviezel finds himself talking to his dad days before his death.  After the typical skeptism you'd expect from any protagonist in a sci-fi yarn, he realizes that he's been given a second chance, one in which he can use to save his father's life.  But there are unexpected consequeces to his fiddling with time, the most notable of which is the continuance of a serial killer who now goes on to kill seven more victims, one of which is his own mother (I won't give too much away).  It's an interesting premise and overdone as it my be the serial killer gere is still facinating stuff.  Reviews have hailed it as Back to the Future meets Seven and though both films are far superior Frequency does a remarkably seamless job of interweaving elements of the two.

This is basically what happens when John, a police detective, finds himself communicating with his presently dead father in the past through a HAM radio and manages to prevent his death.

It's a flip comment, but it actually gets to the core of the movie pretty well.  There's the exploration of the father-and-son relationship between Frank and John Sullivan across the decades (and the fact that Quaid and Caviezel can put that relationship across without appearing together on screen is quite the accomplishment), and there's the cop-suspense story about the hunt for a serial killer preying on women.  The stories are handled with care, and for the most part the script does a good job of establishing the rules of its fantastic premise and sticking with them.  (There are a few slipups, as the screenwriter notes on one of the two commentary tracks.)  Stories that involve altering the timestream almost always end up sinking under the weight of paradoxes, and Frequency does to an extent, but for the most part the film holds up.  And because it has that emotional core to fall back on, one or two imperfections in the plot can't detract from it.I'd give the movie itself 4 stars; the fifth comes from all the extras that New Line packs onto this disc, including two commentaries, a copy of the shooting script, and various storyboards and other effects info.

558902,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00004YA66,D. Litton,"[2, 2]","The year 2000 was a banner year for New Line Cinema, with the releases of such successful movies as the science fiction thriller &quot;The Cell&quot; and the horror film &quot;Final Destination.&quot; One of the movies among this group of terrific releases is &quot;Frequency,&quot; which takes a scientific occurence and turns it into a genuine thriller with tons of surprises and twists. With a truly original plot and a cast of superb actors, this is as good as thrillers get.Police officer John Sullivan is having a tough spot in life. He can't stop thinking about his father, who died thirty years ago when he was a small child. Being a firefighter, Frank Sullivan cares for his wife and kids as much as any husband and father can, so when someone starts using the same frequency as he is on his ham radio, he becomes even more freaked out when he starts realizing that he is talking to his son who is 30 years in the future. Likewise, John is also confused yet exhilarated that he has the chance to talk to his father, and when he gives Frank a piece of information that saves his life, newspapers and family photos magically transform to show his life prolonged until the 80's. However, when a string of murders is set in motion in 1969, Frank and John must work together to catch the murderer before he can reach his next victim: Frank's wife and John's mother.If you think this all sounds confusing, believe me, the only confusing thing about it is trying to think of how to write a synopsis of it. It's not that difficult to comprehend, and while it is not over-simplified, everything is pretty straightforward and understandable. The audience will be able to tell the two time periods about by either looking for the characters' age and appearance, or by the sweeping shots of the aurora borealis, which serves as the link that connects father and son on the radio.Being a student of science, I think I can speak accurately in saying that the science behind the movie is very precise and careful not to stretch credulity. The whole idea for the connection is based on the aurora borealis, or northern lights, which are particles from the sun hitting the surface of Earth's atmosphere, causing interference in most broadcasts and transmissions. The idea that some of those particles can carry transmissions from the past is perfectly fitting for the movie, and hardly makes it not worth watching.The film has an incredibly high amount of intense action and suspense, especially in the second half. Most notably is the sequence in which Frank is caught in the burning building and must make a decision as to where he must go to get out. Most pessimists out there will shrug this scene off with the notion, &quot;Oh, he's going to live because there's another hour of movie to go.&quot; But don't say I didn't warn you if you don't find yourself on the edge of your seat the whole way through.Casting for this movie was a big plus, one of the better ensembles I've seen for a movie like this. It works because everyone fits, molded to the roles they play. Dennis Quaid's performance as Frank Sullivan is incredible, and since he is most of the movie's life force, he carries it off in a fashion that makes the tension even tighter. John Caviezel plays John Sullivan, the slightly emotional and yet smart police officer and grown son of Frank. His acting really brings out the character's strength and heroicism. Because I don't want to ruin the ending for you, I'm not going to mention the actor who plays the villian, but I can say that he is the true embodiment of a movie villain: dark, sinister, and a slick character when faced with possible defeat.The thriller genre is becoming quite tired these days with the same old plot and character development, and it's quite a refreshment to watch &quot;Frequency.&quot; A terrific action piece and even a family film by most standards, you'll find it to be quite original, entertaining, and thrilling in all the right places.",4,This is good thriller making!,980553600,"01 27, 2001",2001,3982,"['year', '2000', 'was', 'banner', 'year', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'releases', 'such', 'successful', 'movies', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'quot', 'Cell', 'quot', 'horror', 'film', 'quot', 'Final', 'Destination.', 'quot', 'One', 'movies', 'group', 'terrific', 'releases', 'quot', 'Frequency', 'quot', 'scientific', 'occurence', 'genuine', 'thriller', 'tons', 'surprises', 'twists', 'truly', 'original', 'plot', 'cast', 'superb', 'actors', 'as', 'good', 'thrillers', 'get.Police', 'officer', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'having', 'tough', 'spot', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'Being', 'firefighter', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'wife', 'kids', 'as', 'much', 'husband', 'father', 'can', 'so', 'when', 'someone', 'using', 'same', 'frequency', 'ham', 'radio', 'even', 'more', 'freaked', 'out', 'when', 'realizing', 'talking', 'son', 'who', '30', 'years', 'future', 'Likewise', 'John', 'also', 'confused', 'yet', 'exhilarated', 'chance', 'talk', 'father', 'when', 'Frank', 'piece', 'information', 'life', 'newspapers', 'family', 'photos', 'magically', 'transform', 'show', 'life', 'prolonged', '80', 'However', 'when', 'string', 'murders', 'set', 'motion', '1969', 'Frank', 'John', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'catch', 'murderer', 'can', 'reach', 'next', 'victim', 'Frank', 'wife', 'John', 'mother.If', 'think', 'confusing', 'believe', 'only', 'confusing', 'thing', 'trying', 'think', 'how', 'write', 'synopsis', 'not', 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'not', 'over-simplified', 'everything', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'understandable', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'two', 'time', 'periods', 'looking', 'characters', 'age', 'appearance', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'link', 'father', 'son', 'radio.Being', 'student', 'science', 'think', 'can', 'speak', 'accurately', 'saying', 'science', 'movie', 'very', 'precise', 'careful', 'not', 'stretch', 'credulity', 'whole', 'idea', 'connection', 'based', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'northern', 'lights', 'are', 'particles', 'sun', 'hitting', 'surface', 'Earth', 'atmosphere', 'causing', 'interference', 'most', 'broadcasts', 'transmissions', 'idea', 'particles', 'can', 'carry', 'transmissions', 'past', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'movie', 'hardly', 'not', 'watching.The', 'film', 'incredibly', 'high', 'amount', 'intense', 'action', 'suspense', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'Most', 'notably', 'sequence', 'Frank', 'caught', 'burning', 'building', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'where', 'must', 'go', 'get', 'out', 'Most', 'pessimists', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'shrug', 'scene', 'notion', 'quot', 'Oh', 'going', 'live', 'hour', 'movie', 'go.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'way', 'through.Casting', 'movie', 'was', 'big', 'plus', 'one', 'better', 'ensembles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'everyone', 'fits', 'molded', 'roles', 'play', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'performance', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'incredible', 'most', 'movie', 'life', 'force', 'off', 'fashion', 'tension', 'even', 'tighter', 'John', 'Caviezel', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'slightly', 'emotional', 'yet', 'smart', 'police', 'officer', 'grown', 'son', 'Frank', 'acting', 'really', 'out', 'character', 'strength', 'heroicism', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'ending', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'mention', 'actor', 'who', 'villian', 'can', 'say', 'true', 'embodiment', 'movie', 'villain', 'dark', 'sinister', 'slick', 'character', 'when', 'faced', 'possible', 'defeat.The', 'thriller', 'genre', 'becoming', 'quite', 'tired', 'days', 'same', 'old', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'quite', 'refreshment', 'watch', 'quot', 'Frequency.', 'quot', 'A', 'terrific', 'action', 'piece', 'even', 'family', 'film', 'most', 'standards', ""'ll"", 'find', 'be', 'quite', 'original', 'entertaining', 'thrilling', 'right', 'places']",Frequency (DVD)

558914,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B00004YA66,"""eurotrashgirl""","[3, 3]","I just saw Frequency and was quite impressed.Parts of the film sent chills down my spine. Both the casting and the acting were extremely good in this movie. Jim Caveizel (who played the homeless addict in the less-than-stellar Pay It Forward) is perfect for the part here, as is Dennis Quaid for the role of his father.The film is about a policeman in Queens, NY, whose firefighter dad died in the line of duty when he was six years old (in 1966). Thirty years later, on an October night in 1999, as he is fiddling with his ham radio, the now 36-year-old son hears a voice coming from the radio that is somehow familiar. Unbeknownst to both men at first, his father is on the other &quot;end,&quot; and is speaking to him from 1969, the day before he is to be killed in the fire. When the son (&quot;John Sullivan&quot;) figures out that he's speaking to his father, he quickly tells his father about the terrible fire that will occur the next day, and tells him about the fatal mistake his father made 30 years before, in an effort to prevent the tragedy and save his father's life. Luckily, the plan works, and the Senior Sullivan (&quot;Frank&quot;), changes his actions accordingly on the day of the blaze and survives the fire. Unfortunately, the fact of his survival changes things beyond either of their imaginations. Everything the father does now that he is alive will affect everything else, since he &quot;wasn't supposed to be there.&quot; This is an interesting part of the film, because I'm sure people often think, &quot;what if I/they had done that instead, where would I be now?...what impact would that have had on the world, or on other people's lives.... would I have met my spouse/been in an accident/avoided an accident?&quot; etc, etc...A parallel storyline is that John (the son) is working on a case involving a serial killer who goes after nurses (the &quot;Nightingale Murders,&quot; they're called). But after he saves his father's life, his mother (a nurse) suddenly disappears from the family pictures... and he has to find a way to save both her (in the past, through communicating with his father) and any other of the serial killer's victims, (and also figure out the identity and whereabouts of the killer, in order to save them). The plot may sound a bit silly and outlandish in such a brief description, but the actors and the details play this out so well that it becomes a riveting, suspenseful film. The film makes up for any deficiencies in the realism (of radio time-travel) with an engaging story, lots of well-paced action, and characters who are played so well that you care what happens to them, and want it to be good. It is an interesting journey into &quot;what-if's,&quot; and even though those of us who have lost a parent may cry for a second at the end when that soft, country song plays, we will be better for the experience of the film, as it is a nice story (ie: the idea of being able to see the loved ones we have lost again and live with them, side-by-side again and do the things we always did together), nicely told. The film offers a loving portrait of a father-son relationship. Some nice flashback images of John's childhood with his father (and mother and best friend, who we also see as older adults) complete the picture, making it watchable and endearing without being sappy or overly sentimental. Plus, the idea of the father and son team solving a case together as age contemporaries but in different &quot;times/eras&quot; was a new spin on an old formula, and I found it really interesting. Each storyline (the son who lost his father and was still grieving thirty years later, and the crime story), had enough good material for two solid, separate movies. Together, they create a really memorable, enjoyable movie experience. Another bonus here is the lack of real violence. I found it refreshing to see a thriller that was so suspenseful and entertaining and thought-provoking that it didn't have to rely on mindless violence to get its point across. Violence wouldn't have added to the story, and without it, the story sets itself apart from other films in the same genre with a more humanist, sensitive approach. The film definetely shines in that regard. This is also a movie that baseball fans will appreciate, as it has some interesting scenes involving the son foretelling some future (for the father) games.As far as overall mood and tone go, the nearest film I can think of (the most similar) is the excellent The Sixth Sense. This movie is like that film, but without the ghosts.The DVD features background data on phenomena such as Aurora Borealis (the Northern Lights), Ham Radios, and the influence of solar events on such radio frequencies. The various people interviewed in the extensive extras are real scientists who know their stuff.

558918,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004YA66,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 2]","This highly imaginative science fiction thriller is an entertaining mind bender of a film.  Toby Emmerich's story takes a fresh approach to the time travel angle.  Rather than having people traveling through time, Emmerich has them communicating through time using a Ham Radio that has been augmented by an Aurora Borealis.  Ok, there aren't many Aurora Borealis events as far south as New York City, but there isn't any trans-time communication noted in the scientific literature either, so we need to allow the story a little latitude.After we accept the premise, this ingenious plot incorporates many different elements to entice the viewer.  There is the human angle of a son speaking to his dead father, the many twists resulting from altering the ribbon of time, and the solving of a thirty-year-old serial murder case.  The various elements are combined effectively by director Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear, Fallen) to produce a fast paced action thriller with sufficient character development to bind us emotionally to the characters.  The fascinating thing about the detective story is that the facts of the crime keep changing in unexpected ways each time John (James Caviezel) imparts something to his father (Dennis Quaid) that causes him to change history.  In addition, the action sequences are well done and the visual effects, especially the digitized Aurora are nicely rendered.  The aging makeup is also realistic.The acting was excellent as well, though the New York accents were pretty bad.  Dennis Quaid alternated between the goofy and endearing dad and the action hero, and managed to keep it from seeming incongruous.  This was a breakout performance by James Caviezel, who heretofore has been confined to minor roles.  His was a very emotional and tense role and he handled it extremely well.  I was also impressed with Elizabeth Mitchell who gave a vivacious performance as John's mother.I enjoy a good intelligent science fiction thriller.  Lately, science fiction has been subsumed into the horror category, since you seldom see a science fiction story that isn't an excuse to hack up some cast members.  This film was more in the tradition of Twilight Zone, relying more on an inventive story than grisly effects to capture the audience.  That's why I rated this film a 9/10.

Fireman, John Sullivan did not die in a warehouse fire because of information from his son in the future.  John is a fireman, who takes high risks to save people, in the first scene where John saves a group of workers trapped under a leaking fuel tank; the fuel tanker accident takes place at a road construction project, the tanker is about to explode, electric wires threaten to ignite the fuel, and John must pry open a steel door and carry injuried man out, who later manages to start running just before the explosion.  How does a injured man manage to run out just before the explosion?  John hero courage and valor allow him to escape death from a exploding fuel tanker.It would seem at first time modification would bring a happy ending, however, the paradox of changing the past to improve the future leaves one reflecting on the complex of time and space.  The movie has some Ham radio humor, as John says, ""we must be talking of the mother of all sun spots.""  In order to go back in time frequency of the radio waves would have to exceed the speed of light.  It seems the radio wave enters a worm hole through a sun spot and emerge out the sunspot in a different time.  So, if space time could wrap around on its self then traveling along the course would take the person back and orth from the past to the future and the future to the past.  The irony of the thought being that the events in the past and future could change the space time topology.John does not die in the warehouse fire; John manages to find a grain slide and escape down it into the bay below;  John loves his wive and wants to see her immediately; John visits his wife, a nurse, at the hospital; if he had died, she would not have been at the hospital; as, a result she saves a serial killers live, Jack;

 John predicts the outcome of the mets game to his black cop friend; John's wife arrives and the black cop takes her aside to watch the game and tell her John is a suspect in the killings;  this gives Jack a chase to question John at gun point;  Jack wants to know how John knows about him and tries to kill John at the police station;  Jack is interrupted by a fellow officer; this give John a chance to improvise a defense using wires from the fuse box and airconditioning unit;  John manages to electrocute Jack with the wires, start the fire alarms, and manages to escape;  John reverse the tide by gaining access to information about Jack's residence from information in his wallet;  Jack discovers John in his apartment and the shooting starts;  Jack chases John and they end up fighting in the water, John takes a steel bolt to Jacks head and it seems Jack is dead;  John Jr does not understand why the mothers picture has not been restored and tells John something is wrong when suddenly Jack appears in both time periods and attacks;

558930,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00004YA66,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","A thriller that associates many interesting elements. First a serial killer, running after him, trying to stop him, in the radical way of today, a good self-defense shot. Then a fireman (yes not very politically correct: firefighter it should have been, but in 1969...) father and heroism, and dying on duty. Then a nurse mother, which is rather banal but explains the overworking schedule of the mother and the over-protective attitude. Then a time warp that happens in a strange way, through an old radio from the time before transistors and computers, with beautiful lamps and diodes.  The orphaned son of the fireman father in 1999 gets in contact through this radio with his father in 1969 or about and they try to stop the killer. After discovering he is a cop. And it works, and the past is changed, and the future of that past is changed, hence the past future is no longer what it could have been or should have been and is what we would have liked it to be. Father, son et grand son. Grandfather, father and son. Three generations instead of two and the orphaned son of the second generation no longer being unable to cope with starting the third generation. Typically American: the desire to change the past, the only thing you cannot change. The future? Maybe if you try hard, and yet without any guarantee. But the past, no way, no hope, and yet there is always an American somewhere who is trying and believing Auschwitz can disappear in thin air. But the most difficult part of the film is the constant shifting from one time to another without being very clear all the time where we stand or are.

I didn't know quite what to expect, but what I found was well written movie, with excellent acting performances and a very gripping storyline, a truly enjoyable moviegoing experience. The story focuses on a cop named John Sullivan (played brilliantly by James Caviezel in a breakthrough big screen performance) who lives in Queens, NY in early October 1999, which happens to be the date of an appearance of a phenomenon that allows John to communicate with his father Frank (with a very solid and emotional performance from Dennis Quaid), on the same radio, in the same house. The interesing part is that John talks to Frank thirty years earlier, merely days before Frank, a firefighter, dies herocially trying to rescue a person trapped in a blazing fire. Frank and John end up making catastrophic changes in the timeline, which leads to the brutal murder of John's mother(in an excellent performance from Elizabeth Mitchell) only days later in 1969. The movie is really a combination of several different elements. First of all it focuses on a father-son relationship between Frank and John. The interaction between Caviezel and Quaid is superb, and leads to some of the films most emotionally moving moments. The emotion is skillfully achieved, as Caviezel and Quaid don't act face-to-face, but across a HAM radio. The interplay between the two time periods really adds to the movie without overshadowing the its story. Frequency also combines elements of suspense, action, mystery, and tense drama. Frequency covers all of the bases, and does so very skillfully. This brings us to the DVD disc itself, which comes from New Line Home Video, who completely loaded the disc with a huge amount of special features, including many interesting DVD-ROM features that can be accessed by any PC with a DVD-ROM drive and PC Friendly installed. If you don't have PC Friendly on your computer, the DVD will install it for you if you so choose. The disc also has deleted scenes, as well as several feature legnth commentaries(by the director, producer, and actor Noah Emmerich who plays the adult Gordo, John's best friend). The disc also includes an interesting original documentary, as well as a trailer and animation galleries. If you are are willing to let your mind go a little bit to accept the science of the storyline, it actually becomes a fascinating part of the movie. This movie would definitely be a worthy addition to any DVD collection. Frequency also offers an extremely exciting and rewarding finale that will not disappoint anyone who watches it. The bottom line is this: Frequency is a wonderful movie, with incredibly strong emotional performances from the entire cast, very moving dramatic moments, as well as tense, gripping action sequences, and a rousing finale. Frequency is definitely one to remember. This movie truly has it all!",5,Frequency: Incredible!

558940,A1TS8A5XM54QDB,B00004YA66,"J. J. Sargent ""jesteratsnetnet""","[1, 2]","Just a short and quick recommendation here... a wild two thumbs up for FREQUENCY, the new Dennis Quaid flick.  It's great science fiction in the tradition of the old Outer Limits series.  It really played like an extended Outer Limits or Twilight Zone show, with great character development, suspense and action.  It's also a good mystery!The plot revolves around strange sunspot activity which makes it possible for a NY City policeman to use a ham radio to talk to his father, a former NY City fireman who died 30 years previously in a fire.  Taking advantage of the opportunity, the son warns the father of his impending death and saves the man's life -- altering forever the future timeline in a strange and HORRIBLE way that the two race through the remaining two-thirds of the film to set right.The filmmakers try really hard to put current quantum physics explanations for what's going on into the film, using an interview with a physics professor with Dick Cavett on the tele in the background on night... it's subtle, yet obvious to the audience that their conversation has to do with the events unfolding in the narrative.  This of course anchors the film in the realm of science fiction rather than science fantasy or scifi, and gives it an air of suggestible believability that helps propel the plot foreward.It also has one of the most suspenseful and tense opening action sequences of any film I've seen in recent history -- a definite armrest grabber!  Three solid stars for this entertaining and at times engaging film which at least attempts to deviate from the old cliche' of time travel plots, even if it fails in a few of those attempts.  It's not easily predictable, but once you get a taste for the director's methodology, you'll start figuring things out.  And the film's ending is a bit overly sentimental, with drawn out slo-mo sequences that border on the worst of the old Kodak ""special moments"" tv adverts.",4,Tense Science Fiction that borders on syrupy sentimentality,1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,1934,"['Just', 'short', 'quick', 'recommendation', 'here', 'wild', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'FREQUENCY', 'new', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'flick', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'tradition', 'old', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'series', 'really', 'played', 'extended', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'show', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'suspense', 'action', 'also', 'good', 'mystery', 'plot', 'strange', 'sunspot', 'activity', 'possible', 'NY', 'City', 'policeman', 'use', 'ham', 'radio', 'talk', 'father', 'former', 'NY', 'City', 'fireman', 'who', 'died', '30', 'years', 'previously', 'fire', 'Taking', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'son', 'father', 'impending', 'death', 'man', 'life', 'altering', 'forever', 'future', 'timeline', 'strange', 'HORRIBLE', 'way', 'two', 'race', 'remaining', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'set', 'right.The', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'put', 'current', 'quantum', 'physics', 'explanations', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'using', 'interview', 'physics', 'professor', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'tele', 'background', 'night', 'subtle', 'yet', 'obvious', 'audience', 'conversation', 'do', 'events', 'unfolding', 'narrative', 'course', 'anchors', 'film', 'realm', 'science', 'fiction', 'rather', 'science', 'fantasy', 'scifi', 'air', 'suggestible', 'believability', 'propel', 'plot', 'foreward.It', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'tense', 'opening', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'history', 'definite', 'armrest', 'grabber', 'Three', 'solid', 'stars', 'entertaining', 'times', 'engaging', 'film', 'least', 'attempts', 'deviate', 'old', 'cliche', 'time', 'travel', 'plots', 'even', 'few', 'attempts', 'not', 'easily', 'predictable', 'once', 'get', 'taste', 'director', 'methodology', ""'ll"", 'start', 'figuring', 'things', 'out', 'film', 'ending', 'bit', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'drawn', 'out', 'slo-mo', 'sequences', 'border', 'worst', 'old', 'Kodak', 'special', 'moments', 'tv', 'adverts']",Frequency (DVD)

First, I must applaud the premise - the use of a ham radio as the device that connects father and son in a supernatural way.  My uncle was a ham radio operator and even taught classes.  It had a tremendous mystique all its own.Dennis Quaid is fabulous.  He effortlessly portrays Frank Sullivan, a man who is passionate about his values, devoted to his family, and larger than life as a fireman.  The movie opens to this father's heroic rescue of a pair of workers trapped underground after a tanker crash.  He comes right home to the wife he loves, the son he loves -- John, his ""Little Chief"" -- in the home he loves; he has it all.  Moving forward thirty years, we meet the adult John.  James Caviezel tears me to pieces in these early scenes as we learn that this father died in a fire 30 years ago.  John is a cop working homicide.  He is still living in the house he grew up in.  He did not completely recover from his father's death.  He drinks to find numbness and his girlfriend (who he loves) walks out on him.  But he is a good man in his own right.  His mother's phone number is on his speed-dial and he takes the time to stay involved in her life.  On this difficult night in October 1999, as he approaches the anniversary of his father's death, his childhood friend Gordo (Noah Emmerich - The Truman Show) helps set up his father's old ham radio that they find looking for fishing gear under the stairs.  Later, with the aurora borealis glistening overhead, father and son make contact on this radio over the distance of 30 years.  Awesome!  My favorite scene on the DVD is captioned ""Catching Up,"" and takes place after a skeptical Frank, up to his ears in smoke and flames, follows his son's frantic warning that he should ""go the other way"" to safety rather than the death that John remembered.  On returning home unscathed, Frank, accidentally wakes his six-year old son, evolving into a joyous bike-riding lesson.  He then finds adult John's voice on the ham and they catch up.  At one point, Frank asks adult John if he is still his ""Little Chief"" and James Caviezel's tearful reply ""I'm trying to be"" is profound.  Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel run with their roles here.  They are two great American actors at work.The entire cast is wonderful.  Elizabeth Mitchell as wife and mother plays so much love and strength into her role.  The screenplay, by Toby Emmerich, brother of Noah, is tight, tender and imaginative.  (The brothers do a great commentary together on the DVD special features.)  The crime-thriller sub-plot is gripping and the ending satisfying.",5,Making it Right,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2707,"['Frequency', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'just', 'discovered', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'others', 'continue', 'add', 'comments', 'here', 'First', 'must', 'applaud', 'premise', 'use', 'ham', 'radio', 'device', 'father', 'son', 'supernatural', 'way', 'uncle', 'was', 'ham', 'radio', 'operator', 'even', 'taught', 'classes', 'had', 'tremendous', 'mystique', 'own.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'fabulous', 'effortlessly', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'man', 'who', 'passionate', 'values', 'devoted', 'family', 'larger', 'life', 'fireman', 'movie', 'father', 'heroic', 'rescue', 'pair', 'workers', 'trapped', 'underground', 'tanker', 'crash', 'right', 'home', 'wife', 'son', 'John', 'Little', 'Chief', 'home', 'Moving', 'forward', 'thirty', 'years', 'meet', 'adult', 'John', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'pieces', 'early', 'scenes', 'learn', 'father', 'died', 'fire', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'John', 'cop', 'working', 'homicide', 'still', 'living', 'house', 'grew', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'completely', 'recover', 'father', 'death', 'find', 'numbness', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'out', 'good', 'man', 'own', 'right', 'mother', 'phone', 'number', 'speed-dial', 'time', 'stay', 'involved', 'life', 'difficult', 'night', 'October', '1999', 'anniversary', 'father', 'death', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Gordo', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Truman', 'Show', 'set', 'up', 'father', 'old', 'ham', 'radio', 'find', 'looking', 'fishing', 'gear', 'stairs', 'Later', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'glistening', 'overhead', 'father', 'son', 'make', 'contact', 'radio', 'distance', '30', 'years', 'Awesome', 'My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'DVD', 'captioned', 'Catching', 'Up', 'place', 'skeptical', 'Frank', 'up', 'ears', 'smoke', 'flames', 'son', 'frantic', 'warning', 'should', 'go', 'other', 'way', 'safety', 'rather', 'death', 'John', 'remembered', 'returning', 'home', 'unscathed', 'Frank', 'accidentally', 'six-year', 'old', 'son', 'evolving', 'joyous', 'bike-riding', 'lesson', 'then', 'adult', 'John', 'voice', 'ham', 'catch', 'up', 'one', 'point', 'Frank', 'adult', 'John', 'still', 'Little', 'Chief', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'tearful', 'reply', ""'m"", 'trying', 'be', 'profound', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'run', 'roles', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'American', 'actors', 'work.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'wife', 'mother', 'plays', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'strength', 'role', 'screenplay', 'Toby', 'Emmerich', 'brother', 'Noah', 'tight', 'tender', 'imaginative', 'brothers', 'do', 'great', 'commentary', 'together', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'crime-thriller', 'sub-plot', 'gripping', 'ending', 'satisfying']",Frequency (DVD)

I enjoyed it tremendously -- so much so that I bought the DVD and have watched it three or four times already.Even though the main focus is the relationship between father and son (separated by 30 years since the death of the father), this movie of the heart doesn't shirk on matters of the head. More scientific in its foundation than Field of Dreams (which simply featured a magic cornfield that enabled the living to interact with the dead), Frequency still manages to make the viewer wonder and wish -- and yearn for second chances with lost loved ones.If you like your movies to be intelligent, well-acted and able to employ both your heart and your mind, you could do a lot worse than Frequency. I highly recommend it.If you don't want to take the plunge and outright buy it before you see it, rent it first. However, I think you'll enjoy it enough to want to own it.

It was a new premise I had not heard of yet, it looked interesting. I have always been a science fiction fan growing up. I loved time travel stories  (i.e. Back to the Future, Star Trek) so this looked promising. Little did I know that it exceeded my expectations. This movie was a sleeper, but should have been a blockbuster. Though the cast consisted of mainly unknown actors save Dennis Quaid, the story is solid, character development is excellent and the action is well done. Quaid and James Caviezel did a great job with their characters - the father/son relationship. The supporting actors did a good job too. One thing that was excellently done was the handling of temporal discrepancies that arise from stories involving time travel or alternate universes. Minute details are carefully shown, and in different instances questions that the audience might have are explained. Everything holds together. The ending was incredible, one of the few movies that kept me guessing until the end. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in the theater, and again on DVD. Now regarding the DVD, I think everyone should go buy this movie after reading this because it's too good to not have in your library. The extras are good, with deleted scenes and commentaries and what not. Overall, go buy this movie because it's one of the best movies of 2000.

Through a freak solar and atmospheric occurence, they are able to communicate through time via the father's short-wave radio.Seeing the father with his son, as a 6-year old, in 1969 and their interaction 30 years later, is wonderful to watch.  What starts as a touching reunion turns into a taut thriller as the son realizes that his interaction with his father has caused tragic and unexpected results.The question that comes to mind is this.  If you could save a loved one, would you do it if the result meant things about your life (or other people's) might change, for better or worse?Dennis Quaid plays the working class, NY fireman as both loving and a bit hard-nosed.  James Caviezel is great to watch as the son who has grown into a man who is not what he or his father envisioned, but who has a chance to redeem himself.  If you have children, many of the situations will tug at your heart, but this movie is not pandering to your base emotions.  It shows the paths that each life takes based on decisions and fate and makes you think about what is in store for each of us.Some plot issues are glossed over a bit, but they do not interfere with the enjoyment of the film.  The setting in the middle-class New York neighborhood gives a nice feel to the film and it is nice to see a movie that can show gritty realism and heart-warming interaction in the same two hours.The video transfer of this DVD is very good and the audio will have you looking over your shoulder if you have a surround sound system.

I missed it when it was out in theaters.  I wish I hadn't.  It is a brilliant tale filled with wonder, mystery, fantasy, and baseball.The story bounds seamlessly between 1999 and 1969, when the aurora borealis cause a tear in time that allows Quaid to talk to his son(Caviezel) via a ham radio.  Caviezel manages to tell his father how he will die and what he must do to avoid it.  The result is a twist and turn of happenings that wouldn't have occurred if Quaid would have died as originally planned.  With new events underway that make significant changes in the lives of the entire family, Quaid and his son begin to work together in order to set time right.  I won't say much more than that about the plot, so that I don't give too much away.Quaid is solid as the lead character, Frank Sullivan.  Caviezel does a great job as Frank's son, John.  The rest of the cast, especially Andre Braugher, do an excellent job.  The story moves at a good pace and there is plenty of action for folks who crave it.The science fiction is key to the story, but this feels more like a drama than a sci-fi flick.  Also, the background story that ties the entire film together, the run of the Amazin' Mets of 69, is brilliant to watch unfold(even though the end result is pretty obvious).I consider this flick a wonderful edition to anyone's collection who enjoys suspenseful drama, science fiction with a little twist, or baseball.Highly recommended.",4,"Drama, Time Travel, Baseball:  Who Could Ask For More?",1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1523,"['Frequency', 'caught', 'eye', 'couple', 'years', 'whenever', 'saw', 'satellite', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'out', 'theaters', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'tale', 'filled', 'wonder', 'mystery', 'fantasy', 'baseball.The', 'story', 'seamlessly', '1999', '1969', 'when', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'cause', 'tear', 'time', 'Quaid', 'talk', 'son', 'Caviezel', 'ham', 'radio', 'Caviezel', 'tell', 'father', 'how', 'will', 'die', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'avoid', 'result', 'twist', 'turn', 'happenings', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'occurred', 'Quaid', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'originally', 'planned', 'new', 'events', 'underway', 'make', 'significant', 'changes', 'lives', 'entire', 'family', 'Quaid', 'son', 'begin', 'work', 'together', 'order', 'set', 'time', 'right', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away.Quaid', 'solid', 'lead', 'character', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'Caviezel', 'great', 'job', 'Frank', 'son', 'John', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'story', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', 'plenty', 'action', 'folks', 'who', 'crave', 'it.The', 'science', 'fiction', 'key', 'story', 'more', 'drama', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'Also', 'background', 'story', 'entire', 'film', 'together', 'run', 'Amazin', 'Mets', '69', 'brilliant', 'watch', 'unfold', 'even', 'end', 'result', 'pretty', 'obvious', '.I', 'consider', 'flick', 'wonderful', 'edition', 'anyone', 'collection', 'who', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'science', 'fiction', 'little', 'twist', 'baseball.Highly', 'recommended']",Frequency (DVD)

558964,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004YA66,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","The paradoxes of time travel are enough to convince most people that it is impossible, along with warp drive, transporter beams, and lots of other staples of science fiction.  Still, writers persist in telling time travel stories and we continue to enjoy them, usually because they are about something else besides time travel.  The deciding factor is not the scientific logic of the method of time travel, because ultimately the rationale simply has to be plausible enough to engage our willing suspension of disbelief.  There are many people who enjoyed ""Somewhere in Time"" and that involved Christopher Reeves' character THINKING himself back to the past.  In the end all that matters are two things.  First, that there is a logical consistency to the rules of the game, whatever they might be.  Second, that there is an emotional payoff to the story that is told under these circumstances.  This is why the ""Star Trek"" episode ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" and the very best episodes of ""Quantum Leap"" were so fantastic.The script for ""Frequency"" written by Toby Emmerich meets both of those criteria.  On the logical consistency axis the twist is to have a time travel story where nobody actually travels through time.  Instead the aurora borealis allows a father, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) and son, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) living in the same house in Queens to talk over the same ham radio set despite the difference of thirty years.  On the emotional payoff scale there is the fact that the father died thirty years ago fighting a fire and the son, who was only 6 at the time, is desperate to reach back into the past, not only to save his father's life but to stop his own life from going into the gutter.  Now, that could be an entire movie right there.  But for Emmerich and director Gregory Hoblit that is just the opening act of the story, because no good deed goes unpunished and if the old chestnut about stepping on a butterfly in the age of dinosaurs could chain out and change the fate of humanity you can imagine what the saving of a life accomplishes.  What starts off as a science fiction/fantasy story suddenly becomes a thriller.I thought the ways the rules of the game were exploited in ""Frequency"" was brilliant from a narrative standpoint.  Of course if you change the past you change the future, but in ""Frequency"" this does not happen instantly from John's perspective.  He can tell the new ""memories"" from the old as things change.  Granted, this is a dramatic device that comes into play big time in the film's climax, but that is why the logical consistency matters more than the scientific and the ending is set up by more subtle examples of the principle at work earlier in the film.  I also like the way that the 1969 World Series was used in this film (I got up in the middle of the night to listen to the games on Armed Forces Radio in Japan that year, so I have strong memories of it as well) and the way that John and his father try to figure out ways of working together to change the past so they have a future.I never took physics, so I did not having any annoying scientific facts gnawing at my brain while enjoying this film, which may be why I had no problem seeing what happened in this movie as being logically consistent.  I just understood the rules and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I thought I had the ending pegged, but was pleasantly surprised with what happened instead (however, on the audio commentary by the director Hoblit reveals that the ending he wanted to shoot was the one I envisioned).  For those of little scientific faith there are a series of explanations offered on the added attractions on the disc, which includes the usually deleted and extended scenes, and three audio commentary tracks by (1) the director Hoblit, (2) the writer Toby Emmerich and his brother Noah, who plays Gordo Hersch, John's next door neighbor and best friend; and (3) composer Michael Kamen.  When you do any of those be sure to turn on the trivia captions as well.  This is one of those DVDs where any doubts about rating are erased by the bonus features.Ultimately, I found ""Frequency"" to be almost as good as the ""Leap Home"" two-part episode of ""Quantum Leap,"" the best time travel story I have ever seen.  That is high praise indeed.  Final Note:  That was not just any episode of ""Hill Street Blues"" on the television that John is watching in his home early in the film but ""Trial by Fury,"" the season premier for the show's third season.  It was not only directed by Hoblit, but was the show that earned the series another Best Drama Emmy and remains one of the Top 10 television episodes I have ever seen in my life.",5,Suspend your disbelief and enjoy a great time travel tale,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,4680,"['paradoxes', 'time', 'travel', 'are', 'enough', 'convince', 'most', 'people', 'impossible', 'warp', 'drive', 'transporter', 'beams', 'lots', 'other', 'staples', 'science', 'fiction', 'Still', 'writers', 'persist', 'telling', 'time', 'travel', 'stories', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'usually', 'are', 'something', 'else', 'time', 'travel', 'deciding', 'factor', 'not', 'scientific', 'logic', 'method', 'time', 'travel', 'ultimately', 'rationale', 'simply', 'be', 'plausible', 'enough', 'engage', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'involved', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'character', 'THINKING', 'back', 'past', 'end', 'matters', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'logical', 'consistency', 'rules', 'game', 'might', 'be', 'Second', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'story', 'told', 'circumstances', 'why', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'City', 'Edge', 'Forever', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'were', 'so', 'fantastic.The', 'script', 'Frequency', 'written', 'Toby', 'Emmerich', 'criteria', 'logical', 'consistency', 'twist', 'have', 'time', 'travel', 'story', 'where', 'nobody', 'actually', 'time', 'Instead', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'father', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'son', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'Queens', 'talk', 'same', 'ham', 'radio', 'set', 'difference', 'thirty', 'years', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'scale', 'fact', 'father', 'died', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'fighting', 'fire', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'only', '6', 'time', 'desperate', 'reach', 'back', 'past', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'father', 'life', 'stop', 'own', 'life', 'going', 'gutter', 'Now', 'could', 'be', 'entire', 'movie', 'right', 'there', 'Emmerich', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'just', 'opening', 'act', 'story', 'good', 'deed', 'unpunished', 'old', 'chestnut', 'stepping', 'butterfly', 'age', 'dinosaurs', 'could', 'chain', 'change', 'fate', 'humanity', 'can', 'imagine', 'what', 'saving', 'life', 'accomplishes', 'What', 'off', 'science', 'fiction/fantasy', 'story', 'suddenly', 'thriller.I', 'thought', 'ways', 'rules', 'game', 'were', 'exploited', 'Frequency', 'was', 'brilliant', 'narrative', 'standpoint', 'course', 'change', 'past', 'change', 'future', 'Frequency', 'not', 'happen', 'instantly', 'John', 'perspective', 'can', 'tell', 'new', 'memories', 'old', 'things', 'change', 'Granted', 'dramatic', 'device', 'play', 'big', 'time', 'film', 'climax', 'why', 'logical', 'consistency', 'matters', 'more', 'scientific', 'ending', 'set', 'up', 'more', 'subtle', 'examples', 'principle', 'work', 'earlier', 'film', 'also', 'way', '1969', 'World', 'Series', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'got', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'listen', 'games', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'Radio', 'Japan', 'year', 'have', 'strong', 'memories', 'well', 'way', 'John', 'father', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'ways', 'working', 'together', 'change', 'past', 'have', 'future.I', 'never', 'took', 'physics', 'did', 'not', 'having', 'annoying', 'scientific', 'facts', 'gnawing', 'brain', 'enjoying', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'had', 'problem', 'seeing', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'being', 'logically', 'consistent', 'just', 'understood', 'rules', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thought', 'had', 'ending', 'pegged', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'happened', 'instead', 'however', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Hoblit', 'ending', 'wanted', 'shoot', 'was', 'one', 'envisioned', 'little', 'scientific', 'faith', 'are', 'series', 'explanations', 'offered', 'added', 'attractions', 'disc', 'usually', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'three', 'audio', 'commentary', 'tracks', '1', 'director', 'Hoblit', '2', 'writer', 'Toby', 'Emmerich', 'brother', 'Noah', 'who', 'Gordo', 'Hersch', 'John', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'best', 'friend', '3', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'When', 'do', 'be', 'sure', 'turn', 'trivia', 'captions', 'well', 'one', 'DVDs', 'where', 'doubts', 'rating', 'are', 'erased', 'bonus', 'features.Ultimately', 'found', 'Frequency', 'be', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Leap', 'Home', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'best', 'time', 'travel', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed', 'Final', 'Note', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'episode', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'television', 'John', 'watching', 'home', 'early', 'film', 'Trial', 'Fury', 'season', 'premier', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'Hoblit', 'was', 'show', 'earned', 'series', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Emmy', 'one', 'Top', '10', 'television', 'episodes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life']",Frequency (DVD)

558966,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00004YA66,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This is a wonderfully nuanced fantasy flick with a bravura performance by Dennis Quaid who plays the father and a compelling one by Jim Caviezel who plays the son.Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he claimed this film to be reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode. It certainly has that feel to it. The premise here is a simple one. A son, haunted by the premature, though heroic, death of his fire fighter father thirty years earlier, is reunited with him through an old ham radio which had belonged to his father. He finds himself speaking to his father over the air waves, when an aurora borealis-like solar storm provides a conduit into the past.This connection to the past allows the son to alter the one event which has so profoundly marred his life, that of his father's death. Over the airwaves he tells his father of the fire to which he will be dispatched and of his impending death. He also tells his father what he needs to do in order to avoid his premature demise. The father is dispatched to the fire about which his son has told him and acts upon his son's suggestion, forever altering the future.This change, however, alters other events, and it results in his mother's premature death at the hands of a serial killer. Father and son now go to work in tandem, each in his own time and way, to try to alter this event, forever changing their respective lives. The son, who is a cop, finds that the case which he has been working on is now the unsolved serial killer case involving his mother.As the father effects subtle changes in his respective reality, this causes shifts in his son's present day reality. While this may seem a little confusing, it is to be expected when you are dealing with time shifts and the ramificatins of altering past events through future information. Ultimately, this causes an interesting convergence of the past upon the present.A nice touch to this film is the fact that it takes place in Queens, New York, home of the New York Mets, and both father and son are die hard Mets fans. More specifically, the father's death occurs in 1969, the year in which the New York Mets won the World Series. This will turn out to be a pivotal event in the movie for more reasons than the obvious one. Baseball fans and nostalgia buffs will love its inclusion in the film.This is a wonderful movie which is sure to both fascinate and tug at your heart strings.",4,THE ULTIMATE FATHER-SON REUNION...,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,2406,"['wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'father', 'compelling', 'one', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'who', 'son.Another', 'reviewer', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'when', 'claimed', 'film', 'be', 'reminiscent', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'certainly', 'feel', 'premise', 'here', 'simple', 'one', 'son', 'haunted', 'premature', 'heroic', 'death', 'fire', 'fighter', 'father', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier', 'reunited', 'old', 'ham', 'radio', 'had', 'belonged', 'father', 'speaking', 'father', 'air', 'waves', 'when', 'aurora', 'borealis-like', 'solar', 'storm', 'conduit', 'past.This', 'connection', 'past', 'son', 'alter', 'one', 'event', 'so', 'profoundly', 'marred', 'life', 'father', 'death', 'airwaves', 'father', 'fire', 'will', 'be', 'dispatched', 'impending', 'death', 'also', 'father', 'what', 'do', 'order', 'avoid', 'premature', 'demise', 'father', 'dispatched', 'fire', 'son', 'told', 'son', 'suggestion', 'forever', 'altering', 'future.This', 'change', 'however', 'other', 'events', 'results', 'mother', 'premature', 'death', 'hands', 'serial', 'killer', 'Father', 'son', 'now', 'go', 'work', 'tandem', 'own', 'time', 'way', 'try', 'alter', 'event', 'forever', 'changing', 'respective', 'lives', 'son', 'who', 'cop', 'case', 'been', 'working', 'now', 'unsolved', 'serial', 'killer', 'case', 'involving', 'mother.As', 'father', 'effects', 'subtle', 'changes', 'respective', 'reality', 'shifts', 'son', 'present', 'day', 'reality', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'confusing', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'are', 'dealing', 'time', 'shifts', 'ramificatins', 'altering', 'past', 'events', 'future', 'information', 'Ultimately', 'interesting', 'convergence', 'past', 'present.A', 'nice', 'touch', 'film', 'fact', 'place', 'Queens', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'Mets', 'father', 'son', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'Mets', 'fans', 'More', 'specifically', 'father', 'death', '1969', 'year', 'New', 'York', 'Mets', 'won', 'World', 'Series', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'pivotal', 'event', 'movie', 'more', 'reasons', 'obvious', 'one', 'Baseball', 'fans', 'nostalgia', 'buffs', 'will', 'love', 'inclusion', 'film.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'sure', 'fascinate', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings']",Frequency (DVD)

Add to that one fabulous cast including Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and Andre Braugher, a fresh take on time travel, and you are in for 2 hours of some fine entertainment.A Police Officer John Sullivan(Caviezel), by a miracle of nature, is able to contact his father, Frank(Quaid), on an old ham radio. The miracle?...The Northern Lights make a rare appearance in New York. What's truly amazing is that his father died thirty years earlier fighting a fire. He is able to change the course of history, by forewarning his father about the tragedy to come. But by changing the course of history, John and Frank may have unleashed an evil chain of events yet to come. They most work together, with the time they have to stop a serial killer.The DVD is a great buy. The transfer is gorgeuos.

558974,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00004YA66,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This film was much, much better than I expected and I spend a nice moment watching it. The review below contains some limited SPOILERS.""Frequency"" is a very original and well thought variation on the theme of time travelling - but with a BIG twist. The story begins in New York in 1969, when the main character, John Sullivan, is only 6 years old and continues in the same place thirty years later, when he is 36. Jim Caviezel (mostly known for his outstanding performance as Jesus in ""Passion of Jesus Christ"") plays the adult John Sullivan, a somehow depressed and borderline alcoholic police officer, who was just dumped by his girlfriend. Denis Quaid plays the equally important role of John's father, firefighter Francis Sullivan - and he is EXCELLENT in this role. In 1999 Francis Sullivan is no more around and his son misses him greatly. And then one evening, when tinkering with the old radio he inherited from his father, John Sullivan will start a conversation with another radio amateur operator, who also lives in New York and who sounds oddly familiar...What follows is a very interesting tale of mystery, tragedy and history changing, mixed with elements of thriller. There are parts of this film which really kept me on edge, especially considering that main characters are pretty likeable and I was seriously worrying about both of them, as things were getting more and more dangerous for them... Also, the ending was pretty surprising and I did not see it comming. There is also a really, REALLY bad guy in this film - and the low key, low drama way in which he is pictured made him actually even scarier...Pay great attention to TV broadcastings which can be seen (or sometimes only heard) discreetly in the background and also to newspaper titles of which the most important appear mostly on the very bottom of the screen...I am not going to say anything more and if you want to see this film try not to read too much about it. The twists and surprises are a particularly important thing in ""Frequency"".I give to this little known film five stars, because it very pleasantly surprised me, impressed me even in one or two scenes and I spend a really, really good moment watching it.

558975,A129YBX5BVNW2,B00004YA66,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","I bought the American BLU RAY of &#34;Frequency&#34; on New Line Home Entertainment because I've always loved this 'talking to my Dad 30 years ago' Fireman movie with a passion.Directed by GREGORY HOBLIT and written by TOBY EMMERICH (older brother of the respected actor NOAH EMMERICH &#8211; see below) - &#34;Frequency&#34; has built up a bit of a cult fan base since its 2000 release. I&#8217;ve had it on many 'Slipped Through The Net' Amazon lists for years.It's the night of 10 October 1969 &#8211; the Baseball World Series will be played out on television sets across American Homes the following day. But that night the atmospheric dance that is the Northern Lights of The Aurora Borealis is doing strange things to the skies over Brooklyn. It&#8217;s even messing with the airwaves.Lighting a cigarette - Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) looks up at the phenomenon and smiles. Frank is a hero father and all round good egg - a fireman that fights the blue beast with courage by day, rides his Harley home afterwards and plays catch with his 'chief' son of 6 on the sidewalk outside their home at night. Until 11 October 1969 - when Frank enters a warehouse down by the docks and in trying to rescue a woman on the top floor &#8211; takes a wrong turn to get out of the building. Neither escapes and The New York Post sadly reports the death of another true blue who didn&#8217;t make it&#8230;Cue to 30 years later in October 1999 and Jim Caviezel is John Sullivan &#8211; his 'chief' all grown up &#8211; a cop who is boozing, losing his wife and still hurting over his Dad&#8217;s loss. His buddies since childhood on the Force Satch and Gordo (Andre Braugher and Noah Emmerich) are worried about him. Gordo (the excellent Noah Emmerich - Jim Carrey&#8217;s Sea Haven mate in &#8220;The Truman Shoe&#8221;) drops by with his son for a chat and to share a Brewsky. But his bored young son (an early part for Michael Cera) finds an NYFD Radio Transmitter in a locked box hidden in a cupboard that everyone&#8217;s forgotten about. The device is old school with glowing valves &#8211; and you need a licence just to use it. John gets it working &#8211; but when no one is in the house and through the crackles &#8211; John hears a man&#8217;s voice &#8211; his Dad Frank from 30 years back.Disbelieving at first - John then begins to realize the potential of the situation and tells Dad how to save his life, which will end the next day (in his time). Dad does just that and John&#8217;s future changes accordingly. Frank hasn&#8217;t died in 1969 but in 1989 from lung cancer. But now a serial killer called &#34;Nightingale&#34; who targets nurses has also lived and killed 15 women instead of 3 &#8211; one of which is John&#8217;s Nurse mum Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell from &#8220;Lost&#8221; and &#8220;Revolution&#8221;). Now both father in 1969 and son in 1999 are locked into a cat and mouse game with this monster to &#8216;alter&#8217; that list. And on it goes to a genius ending that is wholly satisfying&#8230;Special features include:1. Commentary by Director Gregory Hoblit2.

Music Only Track with Commentary by Composer Michael Kamen6. Deleted Scenes7.

Subtitles are English SDH and Spanish only.There are times when you can&#8217;t quite nail why a movie gets to you so much &#8211; or why you hold it in such affection. Perhaps it&#8217;s the father and son thing &#8211; the good guy wins &#8211; the pig gets his comeuppance &#8211; or perhaps it&#8217;s just the sheer likeability of the lead actors given great material to work with.Whatever way you look at it &#8211; &#34;Frequency&#34; on an American BLU RAY is a winner.

558980,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00004YA66,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","I think that Frequency's screenwriter, Toby Emmerich, set out to write a rather original sci-fi movie script. This he did, but he also wound up creating something more. Frequency is one of the best stories about the relationship between father and son ever. I can recommend it as a sci-fi thriller. I can highly recommend it as a modern American drama.As always, I will give you a short plot synopsis, but I must add that, on paper, the story loses something in transition and seems a bit goofy.John Sullivan [James Caviezel] is a cop who lives in the house he grew up in in New York City's Queens borough. He is a a low point in his life now that his wife has walked out on him. One day he and his best friend Gordo [Noah Emmerich] find an old ham radio that John's deceased Dad owned. One night, during a huge display in the sky by the northern lights, some sort of cosmic disturbance occurs. The fabric of time is altered, and John finds himself talking on the old radio to his father, Frank [Dennis Quaid]. Once both of them determine it is not a hoax, John tells Frank, who is living in 1969, that he would not have died in a warehouse fire if only he had tried to escape the other way. The next day, the anniversary of his death, Frank, a fireman, does turn the other way and survives. Joy soon turns to horror when the men discover that they have inadvertently changed the future. They must work together to prevent an even greater tragedy.It is in the two's working together that the story takes flight. Father and son are separated by time. All of their interaction takes place through this ham radio, each man sitting at the same desk thirty years apart. The love between the two is so real and so strong that even the hardest of grown men might shed a tear or two while watching the movie. Caviezel is brilliant, and Quaid is better than he has been in years. I think much of the credit goes to director Gregory Hoblit. Most of his experience has been in television, most notably directing episodes of Hill Street Blues and LA Law. His knowledge of the small screen is part of what makes the scenes between father and son so intimate and believable. Also compelling is how each actor seems so much a part of their time. This is a subtle but important difference that only greatly talented people can bring off. Some great performances are also given by Noah Emmerich, Elizabeth Mitchell as Julia Sullivan, Daniel Henson as John at age six, and Shawn Doyle as Jack Shepard, the villain of the movie.INSIDE SHOTS: Writer Toby Emmerich originally used the idea of a small black hole's causing the time fracture.

Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat (which rarely ever happens to me anymore with movies) but the father/son relationship is one of the best I have ever seen in a film and I have seen quite a few that deal with this theme.  Surprisingly due to the sincerity of the performances and the realistic and exciting direction that never seems to let up the time travel angle really works.  Within the context of this world/story it is completely plausible and not in a goofy way like say Back To The Future.  In this story it serves a deeply rooted purpose.

558985,A2P6PVWZS4NGV0,B00004YA66,Michael Bulger,"[0, 4]","&quot;Frequency&quot; might be classified as science fiction, if only because of its basic premise:  that a particularly violent episode of sunspots links October of 1969 with October of 1999, or at least, allows a young Queens cop in 1999 to communicate with his father in 1969 by way of a single ham radio.  The father had died in a warehouse fire in, you guessed it, October of 1969, and after heeding his son's warning, the timeline is irrevocably altered.  The complications that ensue from that alteration, and the attempts of father and son to make right what they have made wrong, comprise the bulk of the film.  On a different level, we are treated to a family-friendly vision of life in the city, of the bond between father and son, etc. etc.The premise would be more attractive, and the story more engaging, if the film didn't degenerate into typical Hollywood fare.  For example, the father is not only a New York firefighter, but also a heedlessly courageous, manly, all-American firefighter whose daring exploits are worthy of slow-motion camera work.  After avoiding his death in the warehouse fire, the &quot;complications&quot; that ensue involve the survival of a serial killer who would otherwise have died with only three victims to his credit--and if there is any more overdone and hackneyed criminal premise in movies today, the serial killer would have to be it.Notwithstanding these disappointments, the inevitable paradoxes of tampering with the past are not resolved very well in this film; as a result of his communications with his father, the son finds that all the world has changed, excepting his memories, which now include not one but _both_ timelines.  As the action resolutely approaches the climax, the holes in the plot become bigger and bigger.  The willing suspension of disbelief required to remain fully immersed in this film, and not head-shakingly outside of it, was more than I was able to manage.  If you do not have such logical requirements, and if typical Hollywood action fare and trite plot elements don't bother you, &quot;Frequency&quot; is worth seeing.",3,"A nice idea, competently executed, but...",975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,2106,"['quot', 'Frequency', 'quot', 'might', 'be', 'classified', 'science', 'fiction', 'only', 'basic', 'premise', 'particularly', 'violent', 'episode', 'sunspots', 'links', 'October', '1969', 'October', '1999', 'least', 'young', 'Queens', 'cop', '1999', 'communicate', 'father', '1969', 'way', 'single', 'ham', 'radio', 'father', 'had', 'died', 'warehouse', 'fire', 'guessed', 'October', '1969', 'heeding', 'son', 'warning', 'timeline', 'irrevocably', 'altered', 'complications', 'ensue', 'alteration', 'attempts', 'father', 'son', 'make', 'right', 'what', 'have', 'made', 'wrong', 'comprise', 'bulk', 'film', 'different', 'level', 'are', 'treated', 'family-friendly', 'vision', 'life', 'city', 'bond', 'father', 'son', 'etc', 'etc.The', 'premise', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'attractive', 'story', 'more', 'engaging', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'degenerate', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'example', 'father', 'not', 'only', 'New', 'York', 'firefighter', 'also', 'heedlessly', 'courageous', 'manly', 'all-American', 'firefighter', 'daring', 'exploits', 'are', 'worthy', 'slow-motion', 'camera', 'work', 'avoiding', 'death', 'warehouse', 'fire', 'quot', 'complications', 'quot', 'ensue', 'involve', 'survival', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'died', 'only', 'three', 'victims', 'credit', 'more', 'overdone', 'hackneyed', 'criminal', 'premise', 'movies', 'today', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'it.Notwithstanding', 'disappointments', 'inevitable', 'paradoxes', 'tampering', 'past', 'are', 'not', 'resolved', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'result', 'communications', 'father', 'son', 'world', 'changed', 'excepting', 'memories', 'now', 'include', 'not', 'one', '_both_', 'timelines', 'action', 'resolutely', 'climax', 'holes', 'plot', 'become', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'remain', 'fully', 'immersed', 'film', 'not', 'head-shakingly', 'was', 'more', 'was', 'able', 'manage', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'logical', 'requirements', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'fare', 'trite', 'plot', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'quot', 'Frequency', 'quot', 'seeing']",Frequency (DVD)

Buoyed by the fantastic performances of Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and Elizabeth Mitchell, the story is mesmerizing and thoughtfully executed.  There are several scenes of rare poignancy in depicting the relationship between not only a father and a son, but also a family who truly loves each other.Hoblit's direction keeps things moving well, as we experience a parallel time type of scenario.  Things going on in 1969 are paralleled with the actions in 1999, and it's unique the way the story shows John acquiring new memories as things change in 1969.By the end of the movie, my mind was buzzing with questions.  By that time, however, it's not that important.  The ending is so satisfying that you can't help but want to stand up and cheer.One big crime, though, is the Academy Awards' error in not even nominating the beautiful song, ""When You Come Back to Me Again,"" written by Garth Brooks.  In an era where songs are merely added for padding or to sell soundtracks, this song appropriately supports the whole theme of the story.  What a shame!Anyway, this is a great movie.

Thirty years later, his son John ( Jim Caevizel) is now a cop whose life is a mess. The film opens on the eve of the 30 year anniversary of his father's death. John's childhood best friend Gordo( Noah Emmerich) comes over to cheer him up, and they drag out Frank's old ham radio. Due to a phenmenon called an &quot;aurora borealis&quot; John soon realizes that he is able to speak to his father Frank thiry years in the past where the same phenomenon is occuring. Since the death of his father has not yet happened, he is able to warn Frank about the accident. However, saving Frank's life also alters the course of a serial killer which effects John's entire family. John's current investigation is the same unsolved case from 30 years before. Now John and Frank work together over the radio to solve the case and avoid the tragedy that happened to their family.Frequency remains one of my all time favorite movies. The acting is phenomenal!! Jim Caevizel gives the best performance in the movie as John Sullivan. The love for his dad that he shows as well as the determination to solve the case is amazing. Dennis Quade continues to amaze me with his versatile and brilliant roles. Frank Sullivan is no exception. I love the way that he shows love for his son, and how he must become like a cop even though he is a firefighter. Noah Emmerich adds a nice touch to the story with Gordo. A suprising performance was given by Elizabeth Mitchell who plays John's mom Julia. Andre Braugher always does a good job and continues to with Satch. The villan of the story is played by Shawn Doyle. He gives a very impressive performance that will shock you! The story itself is brilliant. It involves many elements. The love between father and son, a murder mystery, and the scientific phenomenon of the aurora borealis. Some timetravel movies suffer with due to lack of explanation. But as the movie goes on, memories of both lives ( the one with Frank dying, and the one with him alive) are shown. You get to see John's life on both timelines, as if they both merged to create the present. This lets us see where the chages were coming from and why they were done.With amazing performances, an incredible script, and an action packed story, Frequency is a treat to watch. It puts an interesting spin on the time travel genre! The DVD is a must own because you not only get the movie, but great special features.

The second story is set in 1999, 30 years later. It describes John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), all grown up and is a police officer, not a firefighter like his father. Basically, John could not get over the fact that Frank, his father, had died in a building fire. John's best friend Gordo (Noah Emmerich) comes across a ham radio inside John's house. The ham radio used to belong to Frank a long time ago, so Gordo urges John to give it a try. And soon enough, the radio works under the different frequencies of the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. John could not believe it when he is talking to his father, who's been dead for 30 years. As the film goes on, there is a string of murders that are the work of a serial killer. And John in 1999 and Frank in 1969 must team up to prevent these killings from happening again from the results of 30 years ago.

There is even a feeling that some parts are a little far-fetched when the film need not be, means blowing up various scenes lessens the impact in the long run, we all like the idea, and maybe if your 11-year-old son was going to steal an adult thriller when you where not looking, Frequency is the kind you would hope he ends up with and not ""Rambo III"", this is solid three star entertainment that I would easily watch instead of ""Alien Vs Predator"" or ""Riddick""(Pitch Black is great).

559007,A348P63LKEES3Z,B00004YA66,Paul S. White,"[2, 2]","Frequency takes an interesting twist on the concept of time travel.  Nobody actually travels forward or backward in time in this movie.  Instead, a son talks to his now deceased father 30 years in the past over the ham radio because of freakish sun storms that occur exactly 30 years apart.  This makes for an interesting movie as we see a son getting to know the father he lost as a child.When it comes to movies or television handling the concept of time travel, you have to make two decisions.  One ? does the story set up and adhere to any rules addressing how time travel and the consequences thereof will be governed.  Two ? are your willing to accept these rules.  In Frequency, the rules are that anything that happens 30 years in the past to change events in the future is noticed exactly 30 years later.  For example, when John Sullivan?s father accidentally burns the desk, the burn mark (still warm) appears before John?s eyes who is sitting at the same desk exactly thirty years later.  I found this somewhat annoying, but the rest of the movie was done well enough that I decided to go ahead an accept this.In the movie, John Sullivan (James Caviezel) talks to his father, Frank, thirty years in the past over the ham radio because of sun storms that occur exactly thirty years apart in 1969 and 1999.  John warns his father that he will die in a fire (Frank is a firefighter), which allows Frank to avoid his untimely demise.  This alters history in ways that lead to John?s mother later being murdered by a serial killer.  John remembers both timelines because he was involved in changing the past (another of the movie?s time travel rules you have to accept).  John warns Frank of what has happened, and they work together to follow the events that lead to Julia Sullivan?s murder in order to alter history once again.If the plot sounds somewhat convoluted and contrived, it is.  But it is done well enough and provides for a rather entertaining two hours.  The focus is on John and Frank as they reestablish the bond they lost when Frank died thirty years ago.  Dennis Quaid does a good job as Frank Sullivan, almost overshadowing James Caviezel?s performance as John Sullivan.  Quaid is an excellent actor who has unfortunately been cast in more than a few mediocre movies.  In Frequency, though, he is given the material that an actor of his talent deserves.The DVD version has most of the usual additional features such as comments by the director and writer as well as biographies of the cast.  One of the more interesting of the additional features is a short documentary on the science behind the movie.  It does not provide a completely sound scientific backing to what transpires in the movie (not that you would really expect it to) but it does have some interesting information on how sun storms have affected ham radio transmissions.",4,Can you hear me how?,1042675200,"01 16, 2003",2003,2862,"['Frequency', 'interesting', 'twist', 'concept', 'time', 'travel', 'Nobody', 'actually', 'forward', 'backward', 'time', 'movie', 'Instead', 'son', 'talks', 'now', 'deceased', 'father', '30', 'years', 'past', 'ham', 'radio', 'freakish', 'sun', 'storms', 'occur', 'exactly', '30', 'years', 'apart', 'interesting', 'movie', 'see', 'son', 'getting', 'know', 'father', 'lost', 'child.When', 'movies', 'television', 'handling', 'concept', 'time', 'travel', 'have', 'make', 'two', 'decisions', 'One', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'adhere', 'rules', 'addressing', 'how', 'time', 'travel', 'consequences', 'thereof', 'will', 'be', 'governed', 'Two', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'rules', 'Frequency', 'rules', 'are', 'anything', '30', 'years', 'past', 'change', 'events', 'future', 'noticed', 'exactly', '30', 'years', 'later', 'example', 'when', 'John', 'Sullivan', 's', 'father', 'accidentally', 'desk', 'burn', 'mark', 'still', 'warm', 'John', 's', 'eyes', 'who', 'sitting', 'same', 'desk', 'exactly', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'found', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'accept', 'this.In', 'movie', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'talks', 'father', 'Frank', 'thirty', 'years', 'past', 'ham', 'radio', 'sun', 'storms', 'occur', 'exactly', 'thirty', 'years', 'apart', '1969', '1999', 'John', 'father', 'will', 'die', 'fire', 'Frank', 'firefighter', 'Frank', 'avoid', 'untimely', 'demise', 'history', 'ways', 'lead', 'John', 's', 'mother', 'later', 'being', 'murdered', 'serial', 'killer', 'John', 'timelines', 'was', 'involved', 'changing', 'past', 'movie', 's', 'time', 'travel', 'rules', 'have', 'accept', 'John', 'Frank', 'what', 'happened', 'work', 'together', 'follow', 'events', 'lead', 'Julia', 'Sullivan', 's', 'murder', 'order', 'alter', 'history', 'once', 'again.If', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'contrived', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'two', 'hours', 'focus', 'John', 'Frank', 'reestablish', 'bond', 'lost', 'when', 'Frank', 'died', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'good', 'job', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'almost', 'overshadowing', 'James', 'Caviezel', 's', 'performance', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'Quaid', 'excellent', 'actor', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'cast', 'more', 'few', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'Frequency', 'though', 'given', 'material', 'actor', 'talent', 'deserves.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'most', 'usual', 'additional', 'features', 'such', 'comments', 'director', 'writer', 'as', 'well', 'biographies', 'cast', 'One', 'more', 'interesting', 'additional', 'features', 'short', 'documentary', 'science', 'movie', 'not', 'provide', 'completely', 'sound', 'scientific', 'backing', 'what', 'movie', 'not', 'would', 'really', 'expect', 'have', 'interesting', 'information', 'how', 'sun', 'storms', 'have', 'affected', 'ham', 'radio', 'transmissions']",Frequency (DVD)

559014,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00004YA66,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","A relatively intelligent sci-fi thriller that in the end doesn't really amount to much, ""Frequency"" emerges as a father/son reconciliation drama with a ""Twilight Zone"" twist.  Written by Toby Emmerich and directed by Gregory Hoblit, the film stars Dennis Quaid as a New York firefighter in 1969 who manages, through some fluke of nature, to contact his very own son, Johnny (Jim Caviezel), via short wave radio, thirty years in the future.  The filmmakers manage to come up with a surprisingly large number of narrative twists and turns to keep this potentially one-note premise intriguing and interesting as father and son come to know each other across the normally uncrossable chasm of time.  For instance, Johnny not only has to try to reverse history and prevent his father's untimely death in a fire in 1969, but also to thwart the murders of his mother and of several other women by a serial killer during that same time period.A film like ""Frequency"" really doesn't have much going for it but the ingenuity of its plot.  Whenever it tries to get meaningful and touching, particularly in its exploration of the father/son relationship, the film dissolves in a puddle of hopelessly contrived and manufactured sentimentality.  On the other hand, ""Frequency"" does manage to keep to a minimum the maddening inconsistencies and lapses in logic that invariably accompany these time-bending scenarios.  Moreover, the filmmakers make clever use of the famous 1969 World Series, astutely finding ways to incorporate it into the fabric of the drama.  On a trivial level, the film does seem to suffer from an apparent oversight on the part of its makers.  The movie is supposed to be set in New York City in the Octobers of 1969 and 1999 - yet, correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't at least some of the trees be turning colors and dropping leaves by that time?  As far as we can tell, the movie seems to have been filmed during the summer months.  For a film whose very foundation is to question the very nature of time, this seemingly insignificant error looms larger than it perhaps otherwise might.A film of this sort really doesn't stand up to too close scrutiny.  A viewer either accepts the incredibility of the premise and goes with it, or rejects the concept out of hand and moves on to another film.  Suffice it to say then that, given its fundamental plot-is-everything nature, ""Frequency"" makes for reasonably diverting and absorbing viewing.",3,relatively intriguing sci-fi thriller,973987200,"11 12, 2000",2000,2450,"['relatively', 'intelligent', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'amount', 'much', 'Frequency', 'father/son', 'reconciliation', 'drama', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'twist', 'Written', 'Toby', 'Emmerich', 'directed', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'film', 'stars', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'New', 'York', 'firefighter', '1969', 'who', 'fluke', 'nature', 'contact', 'very', 'own', 'son', 'Johnny', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'short', 'wave', 'radio', 'thirty', 'years', 'future', 'filmmakers', 'manage', 'come', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'large', 'number', 'narrative', 'twists', 'keep', 'potentially', 'one-note', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'interesting', 'father', 'son', 'come', 'know', 'other', 'normally', 'uncrossable', 'chasm', 'time', 'instance', 'Johnny', 'not', 'only', 'try', 'reverse', 'history', 'prevent', 'father', 'untimely', 'death', 'fire', '1969', 'also', 'thwart', 'murders', 'mother', 'several', 'other', 'women', 'serial', 'killer', 'same', 'time', 'period.A', 'film', 'Frequency', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'ingenuity', 'plot', 'Whenever', 'get', 'meaningful', 'touching', 'particularly', 'exploration', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'film', 'puddle', 'hopelessly', 'contrived', 'manufactured', 'sentimentality', 'other', 'hand', 'Frequency', 'manage', 'keep', 'minimum', 'maddening', 'inconsistencies', 'lapses', 'logic', 'invariably', 'accompany', 'time-bending', 'scenarios', 'Moreover', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'clever', 'use', 'famous', '1969', 'World', 'Series', 'astutely', 'finding', 'ways', 'incorporate', 'fabric', 'drama', 'trivial', 'level', 'film', 'seem', 'suffer', 'apparent', 'oversight', 'part', 'makers', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Octobers', '1969', '1999', 'yet', 'correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'would', ""n't"", 'least', 'trees', 'be', 'turning', 'colors', 'dropping', 'leaves', 'time', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'summer', 'months', 'film', 'very', 'foundation', 'question', 'very', 'nature', 'time', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'error', 'larger', 'perhaps', 'otherwise', 'might.A', 'film', 'sort', 'really', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'too', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'viewer', 'incredibility', 'premise', 'concept', 'hand', 'moves', 'film', 'Suffice', 'say', 'then', 'given', 'fundamental', 'plot-is-everything', 'nature', 'Frequency', 'reasonably', 'diverting', 'absorbing', 'viewing']",Frequency (DVD)

The scene at the end where Quaid shows up to save his son is actually very affecting. The constant rift of time between a young man an his father creates a very unusual but effective separation.

Edwards,"[10, 14]","Review of the $30 Canadian version:  The one star refers not to the movie, which for me, is a five-star movie, but rather to the cheaply done blu-ray version of this movie.  All the commentaries, extras, subtitles, etc., have been stripped out in this overpriced ($30 USD) Canadian version of the blu-ray, as compared with DVD versions.  It's so sad, because I own the American, German, and Czech versions of the movie on DVD, which have all been well done, with all the extras you would expect.  This new stripped down no-menu 'your movie will start now' without your control, idea of creating blu-rays is awful!  Shame on companies who cheaply do this just to get something quickly out on blu-ray!  The whole idea of blu-ray is not just the high def, but also all that available space so that you CAN add other languages, extras, etc.  Talk about a waste of space on a blu-ray disc!  I have also noticed this same thing with two other blu-rays I've purchased recently, movies I really love:  ""The Return"" and ""Dark Water"" (all three of these are my most recent blu-ray purchases and seem to indicate a trend, heaven forbid).  The movie starts automatically without the ability to go to a menu and when you hit the menu button, you get the ""forbidden"" sign.  If you're lucky enough to have a ""pop-up menu"" button on your blu-ray player, then you can sometimes get some minimal functionality through that -- but still not much.  On this DVD, the entirety of all extras and extra functionality is that you can listen to it in French or English, not even any subtitles!  The DVD versions are what you should purchase if you want to have anything beyond that.  I'm not sure the high def alone is worth it if all my blu-rays have no extras nor ability to control the little functionality that may exist on them.  Update as of 20 April 2012:  I see that another version of this movie is coming out on Blu-Ray.  It is half the price of the other.  Hopefully it will have the extras that were stripped out of the other!Review of the $15 American version:  Update as of 10 July 2012:  I am SOO pleased with the new blu-ray disc of 2012!  It looks like the definition problem has been fixed.  Extras have all been added back in.  This is the American version, available for half the price ($15.00) of the useless Canadian one.  All the wonderful extras of the DVD were added back in.  Other languages were added, and to my delight, a Czech language track (I'm currently learning Czech full blast).  In short, I've changed my rating back to a 5-star rating and added this update.  I'm so glad that those responsible for making this and doing it right this time!  Hats off!

The film opens in the year 1969, with fire-fighter Dennis Quaid first introducing the game of baseball (specifically the Amazin' Mets of that season) to his son, John.  Fast-forward to thirty years later, in which John (Caviezel) is a lonesome, washed-ed ex-college baseball great turned cop who stumbles upon his deceased father's old ham radio.One night, John uses the radio to connect with a man in the area, later discovering that he is talking to his father in the past.  When the father avoids death in a fire that was supposed to take his life, John realizes that he can use this uncanny communication to help him with a serial killer murder case.  The two join forces to change the course of history in order to save the lives of the killer's next victims.Clever premise certainly works for the most part, although there are some twists that do not seem to fit.

After establishing the strong father-son bond the two have in 1969, the movie cuts to 1999, where Jon is a wore out cop struggling to keep is life together.  On the night before the anniversary of his father's death, a strange aurora borealis effect (combined with a ham radio) produce a &#34;frequency&#34; that allow father (1969) and son (1999) to talk with each other once again.This movie is so compelling and full of real human drama that words in a review hardly do it justice.  In fact, it almost sounds cheesy and a bit oft-putting to describe the plot.  Rest assured, though, that this is about as quality of a movie as one can find.  It quite literally has everything...incredibly real-feeling characters, a mind-bending plot, great acting, and emotional story lines that will have you welling up in both tears of joy and sadness on certain occasions.I am utterly flabbergasted that a movie like this doesn't get more recognition.  Most people I know have not seen it (a crying shame!).  It is also the kind of movie that the whole family can enjoy.  There is no harsh violence or terrible profanity.  Director Gregory Hoblit crafts &#34;Frequency&#34; into a genre-diverse (and aren't those the best kind of films?!) masterpiece that proves creativity still has a place in Hollywood.&#34;Frequency&#34; is one of my favorite films of all-time.  It tackles so many elements of filmmaking, yet manages to seamlessly weave them all into a tapestry of wonderment.  If you haven't had the pleasure (and you probably haven't, knowing this film's relatively unknown stature), you are missing out on an incredible experience.",5,A Severely Underrated Gem,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1960,"['never', 'amaze', 'movies', 'being', 'incredible', 'what', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'nearly', 'attention', 'deserve', '34', 'Frequency', '34', 'example', 'exactly', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Frequency', '34', 'story', 'father', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'son', 'Jon', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'establishing', 'strong', 'father-son', 'bond', 'two', 'have', '1969', 'movie', 'cuts', '1999', 'where', 'Jon', 'wore', 'out', 'cop', 'struggling', 'keep', 'life', 'together', 'night', 'anniversary', 'father', 'death', 'strange', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'effect', 'combined', 'ham', 'radio', 'produce', '34', 'frequency', '34', 'allow', 'father', '1969', 'son', '1999', 'talk', 'other', 'once', 'again.This', 'movie', 'so', 'compelling', 'full', 'real', 'human', 'drama', 'words', 'review', 'hardly', 'do', 'justice', 'fact', 'almost', 'cheesy', 'bit', 'oft-putting', 'describe', 'plot', 'Rest', 'assured', 'though', 'about', 'quality', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'quite', 'literally', 'everything', 'incredibly', 'real-feeling', 'characters', 'mind-bending', 'plot', 'great', 'acting', 'emotional', 'story', 'lines', 'will', 'have', 'welling', 'up', 'tears', 'joy', 'sadness', 'certain', 'occasions.I', 'am', 'utterly', 'flabbergasted', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'recognition', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'crying', 'shame', 'also', 'kind', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'harsh', 'violence', 'terrible', 'profanity', 'Director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'crafts', '34', 'Frequency', '34', 'genre-diverse', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'kind', 'films', 'masterpiece', 'creativity', 'still', 'place', 'Hollywood.', '34', 'Frequency', '34', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'all-time', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'filmmaking', 'yet', 'seamlessly', 'weave', 'tapestry', 'wonderment', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'knowing', 'film', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'stature', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'incredible', 'experience']",Frequency (DVD)
