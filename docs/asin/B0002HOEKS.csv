The characters are so awesome and the drama was relate-able most of the time.My favorites were Emma, Craig, Mannie, Ashley, Marco and Jimmy.To be honest, I developed crushes on all of my favorite characters, save for Ashley. She was cute, but not that cute. LOLAnyway, this takes place at Degrassi High mostly and everyone is pretty much friends. Lots of drama occurs and the teens have to try their best to just deal. Relationships form and fizzle, bouts of sadness, loneliness, depression, sexual confusion and feeling like the odd man out touch nearly everyone. Some of them begin to have sex earlier than you would think (Hint, hint; Mannie and Craig. But no one could touch Mannie's cute but extra-sleazy ways).Craig dated Ashley, then they broke up and he dated Mannie for some time. He actually cheated on Ashley and when Mannie found out, she was floored and disappointed. She actually went as far as sticking up for him when Ashley was trying to warn her!Cover Art: C-Dialogue: B-Story: BCharacters: ALength: A+Overall: B4.2 stars.",4,A great show for young adults and adults alike. 4.2 stars.,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,1101,"['was', 'entranced', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'awesome', 'drama', 'was', 'relate-able', 'most', 'time.My', 'favorites', 'were', 'Emma', 'Craig', 'Mannie', 'Ashley', 'Marco', 'Jimmy.To', 'be', 'honest', 'developed', 'crushes', 'favorite', 'characters', 'save', 'Ashley', 'was', 'cute', 'not', 'cute', 'LOLAnyway', 'place', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'mostly', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'friends', 'Lots', 'drama', 'occurs', 'teens', 'have', 'try', 'best', 'just', 'deal', 'Relationships', 'form', 'fizzle', 'bouts', 'sadness', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'feeling', 'odd', 'man', 'touch', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'begin', 'have', 'sex', 'earlier', 'would', 'think', 'Hint', 'hint', 'Mannie', 'Craig', 'one', 'could', 'touch', 'Mannie', 'cute', 'extra-sleazy', 'ways', '.Craig', 'dated', 'Ashley', 'then', 'broke', 'up', 'dated', 'Mannie', 'time', 'actually', 'cheated', 'Ashley', 'when', 'Mannie', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'floored', 'disappointed', 'actually', 'went', 'far', 'sticking', 'up', 'when', 'Ashley', 'was', 'trying', 'warn', 'Cover', 'Art', 'C-Dialogue', 'B-Story', 'BCharacters', 'ALength', 'A+Overall', 'B4.2', 'stars']",N/A

I have started watching the show with her as a way of showing her what kinda of things she may experience as a tween and teen in the upcoming years. It started off as a life lesson (I used the first episode as a cautionary tale of why you should be extra careful when talking to and meeting people online), and now she has fallen in love with the characters and their stories.Some of the plots are a little mature for her, which is why I watch WITH her to answer questions or explain why certain situations are not meant for kids her age.

833621,A9YA983MXKCEL,B0002HOEKS,"Gregory Bartz ""Gregorius""","[12, 48]","(note: comments apply to all seasons)This is a really awful show. I mean, it's not as bad as most of the crap on Noggin, but it's still pretty awful. Which is sad really, because the writers do try to make it a good show in their own eyes. And, apparently, the eyes of any 12-year-olds who are dumb enough to believe this crap, which is nothing more than propaganda cheaply disguised as drama, encouraging kids to eat all their veggies and stay virgins for their whole lives.Okay, enough trash-talking. It's time for me to explain WHY this show is so awful. Sadly, it's not one big simple thing. It's a whole bunch of big simple things. I'll start with the one that bugs me the most: unforgivably inaccurate representations of every single ""issue"" (translation: newspaper headline) that the show ""deals with"" (translation: poorly uses as a plot device). For example, take the Season 1 finale ""Jagged Little Pill"". In this episode, a character named Ashley (the only tolerable one in the bunch) takes one hit of Ecstasy and starts speaking gibberish, losing motor control, and doing a few other things. The problem here is that Ecstasy doesn't do ANY of the things that happen to Ash in this episode! Ash then spends the entire summer in Rehab, which no one in the real world goes to unless they're ADDICTED to something. Example number two: a character named Toby, downcast about being circa 50 pounds overweight, forgoes solid food. He lasts about 2 or 3 days at the most before fainting. Sorry, but in the real world, you'd have to get to well below 100 pounds and stay there for a while before you pass out from a lack of calories. In this same episode, a girl who must weigh at least 200 pounds gets a job as a plus-size model and lays the smackdown on a fast food clerk who mocks her physical condition. What's the moral of the story here? That it's okay to be morbidly obese?Alright, second problem. The characters are all horribly one-dimensional stereotypes who lack the brainpower that God gave a jellyfish. Whenever a character is placed in a situation that involves any kind of decision-making, they can always be counted on to take the stupidest, most irrational course of action that the writers can get away with. Said characters are as follows: the Big Dumb Immature Jock (Spinner), the Glamour Queen With Minions (Paige), the Class Clown (JT? or is it TJ?), the Clueless Crusader (Emma), the Token Angry Black Guy (Jimmy), the Token Fruitcake (Marco), the Bad Boy From a Broken Family (Sean), two Smart People With Glasses Who Are Horribly Out Of Shape (Liberty and Toby), and two people (Ashley and Craig) who almost resemble real, normal people. There's also Manny, who originally had the personality of a toaster and was only on the show to give Emma someone to talk to other than her computer; later, the writers decided to make her the official Tramp Wannabe. Every single one of these characters has been seen on at least a dozen sitcoms before, and almost as many real-world high schools.Problem number three. Everyone gets busted. Always. For everything. This makes the plots EXTREMELY predictable, and predictable plots are never a good thing. Jimmy takes Spinner's Ritalin prior to a basketball game? Gee, he got kicked off the team, what a shock! Craig cheats on Ash with Manny? Oh, I'm sure Ash will NEVER find out... so boring. It's counterproductive, too: the characters never regret their actions out of guilt, only out of punishment. What's the lesson? It's only wrong because you got busted?Fourth problem. Lack of realism and balance. For example, the two smartest kids in the school, as previously mentioned, both wear glasses and are horribly out of shape. Smart people in the real world are just as physically fit and can see just as well as the rest of us. Also, I've noticed that the ONLY time the characters ever have sex is in the context of cheating. Nobody ever has sex with the person they're actually dating. Why? Because God forbid that anyone who watches this show get the impression that losing your virginity in High School won't totally ruin your life.Anyway... I have a million and one other gripes with this show, but I think I've said enough. I will admit that this show is EXTREMELY addictive, even for someone who hates it as much as I do, and it's a bit better than the likes of Boy Meets World or Beverly Hills 90210. And I do kind of have to respect what the writers are trying to do with all the Aesop's Fables B.S. But really, if you want a quasi-realistic High School drama, watch Boston Public, or at least Freaks and Geeks (a very overrated show IMO). But for the love of all that is good and holy, if you don't want your brain turned into grape pudding, then stay away from Degrassi.",1,"Predictable, transparent, melodramatic tripe.",1106006400,"01

833626,A3JMHX4PPBSXPK,B0002HOEKS,"J ""j""","[22, 24]","This is not a complaint about the show. (Degrassi TNG is a GOOD show, as good as its predecessor, and the best sequel series since another show with the title TNG that came out back in 87)It is how it is presented, at least on this DVD set.The 15 episodes that make up the first season are on two supposedly cheaply made discs. There is a red back (unlike the silver back on virtually ALL commercial DVDs and most blank ones as well) which gives the impression that this could either be a burned DVD or even pirated (I know it isn't but at first,one is not sure)Also all episodes are listed as ONE title. Although there is a menu option to choose each episode, when the second episode is chosen (for example Mother and child Reunion Part 2) it starts at ""chapter 9"" . Also there is no closed captioning or subtitles and although episodes may have chapters, there are no menus other then the top menu.Picture quality seems to be almost on par with SP VHS.Yes, I know the show was made on the cheap, but it seems that these DVDs were made on the cheaper, and the TRUE value is probably  of what is being charged for it.The biggest appeal for these DVDs at least in the US is that these episodes are presented as seen in Canada (the N didn't originally show ""Jagged little pill"" until into the 2nd season, and have totally eliminated the storyline connected with ""Accidents will happen"" a 3rd season episode.)Degrassi TNG is a very good show, and deserves much wider exposure then currently offered on the N [they may rerun each episode many times, but there are a lot of folks who do not have digital cable or a dish who would enjoy this show] (perhaps on a network with a wider reach like Nickelodeon, MTV, or even CBS!.)Did I get the second season? Yes, as it is a quality series. (This review may have led to a better Season 2 disc)",3,Good show but the DVD leaves something to be desired,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,1833,"['not', 'complaint', 'show', 'Degrassi', 'TNG', 'GOOD', 'show', 'as', 'good', 'predecessor', 'best', 'sequel', 'series', 'show', 'title', 'TNG', 'came', 'out', 'back', '87', 'how', 'presented', 'least', 'DVD', 'set.The', '15', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'two', 'supposedly', 'cheaply', 'made', 'discs', 'red', 'back', 'silver', 'back', 'virtually', 'ALL', 'commercial', 'DVDs', 'most', 'blank', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'impression', 'could', 'either', 'be', 'burned', 'DVD', 'even', 'pirated', 'know', ""n't"", 'first', 'one', 'not', 'sure', 'Also', 'episodes', 'are', 'listed', 'ONE', 'title', 'menu', 'option', 'choose', 'episode', 'when', 'second', 'episode', 'chosen', 'example', 'Mother', 'child', 'Reunion', 'Part', '2', 'chapter', '9', 'Also', 'closed', 'captioning', 'subtitles', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'chapters', 'are', 'menus', 'other', 'then', 'top', 'menu.Picture', 'quality', 'be', 'almost', 'par', 'SP', 'VHS.Yes', 'know', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'cheap', 'DVDs', 'were', 'made', 'cheaper', 'TRUE', 'value', 'probably', 'what', 'being', 'charged', 'it.The', 'biggest', 'appeal', 'DVDs', 'least', 'US', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'seen', 'Canada', 'N', 'did', ""n't"", 'originally', 'show', 'Jagged', 'little', 'pill', '2nd', 'season', 'have', 'totally', 'eliminated', 'storyline', 'connected', 'Accidents', 'will', 'happen', '3rd', 'season', 'episode', 'Degrassi', 'TNG', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'much', 'wider', 'exposure', 'then', 'currently', 'offered', 'N', '[', 'may', 'rerun', 'episode', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'lot', 'folks', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'digital', 'cable', 'dish', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'show', ']', 'perhaps', 'network', 'wider', 'reach', 'Nickelodeon', 'MTV', 'even', 'CBS', 'Did', 'get', 'second', 'season', 'Yes', 'quality', 'series', 'review', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'better', 'Season', '2', 'disc']",N/A

833631,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0002HOEKS,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[95, 100]","Sadly, I must say that I'm probably considered an old guy to most of the reviewers of this ""Degrassi:  The Next Generation"" boxed set.  At twenty-eight years of age, I'm probably twice as old as most of these folks.  But that doesn't matter because I really love this boxed set.  I grew up watching the original Degrassi shows on PBS in Louisiana.  Though the cast was roughly two years older than I was, I found myself relating to a lot of them.  The new series allows me to catch up with some of my old favorites, as well as introduces me to a new crop of kids going through that great life-changing period we know as junior high and high school.This new DVD set brings us the first season of the new series.  Many of the kids are still pre-teens in this season.  We are introduced to Emma, J.T., Toby, Manny, Ashley, Paige, etc.  We're also introduced to some of their parents.  One of the parents is very familiar to us old folks.  Emma's mom is Ms. Nelson, or Spike, from the original show.  She'll become quite close with Emma's media immersion teacher, Mr. Simpson.  Once again, the old folks will probably, recognize Mr. Simpson as Snake from the old show.  Another returning favorite is Joey Jeremiah.  You'll remember him as the goofy kid that wore a fedorah.  Many of the older castmembers show up for a class reunion at the end of episode two.The new cast is fun to watch.  It's funny how kids these days still deal with many of the same problems that other teenagers deal with.  Everything from sex to drug abuse to first loves is dealt with.  There are a few new trials and tribulations these days, however.  One such temptation is internet romance, which gets Emma into a sticky situation.  Another subject dealt with is Ashley having to come to terms with the fact that her father is gay.  Though homosexuals have been around forever, I think that this is the first teen show that deals with this particular situation.  Spinner is on behavior-controlling prescription drugs(ritelin, forgive the spelling).  Jimmy uses those particular drugs to give him an ""edge"" at basketball.  J.T. and Toby check out a little internet porn and, as usual, those blasted parents catch them.  These are just a few of the ""newer"" problems that are addressed on the show.Some of the problems that have hampered teens since the dawn of time are addressed as well.  Toby crushes big-time over Emma, who is captivated by Sean.  Sean, meanwhile, comes from a busted, alcoholic family.  Paige manipulates her friends to get what she wants.  Terry is overweight and thinks that no one will ever like her.  Liberty fears failure in the classroom, etc., etc.  What you get is a teenage soap-opera that deals with real issues.Granted, some of the ""problems"" are hokey and 100% cheese, but this helps break the intensity of some of the dramatic moments.  The acting isn't superb, but it wasn't with the original show, either.  What you end up with is a program that teens and pre-teens can watch without feeling like they are being preached to or lectured.  The characters are believable and they deal with their problems in the same way as any average kid would these days.The DVD extras are fun.  There is karaoke, where you get to sing the theme song.  There's a casting call section where you get to see some of the youngsters try out for roles.  A blooper reel is included, and some deleted scenes as well.  One of the best deleted scenes for us oldsters is one which catches us up on a lot of the old characters from the original shows.I recommend this boxed set to anyone who wants to relive the old days of their youth.  More importantly, I recommend this set to teachers and parents who want to teach their kids without having to hammer a speech down their throats.  Kids connect with the characters on this show, and that makes life a little bit easier to deal with once they realize that they aren't the ""only one"" who has to deal with any of their particular teenage problems.",4,An Old Guy's Point Of View,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,3975,"['Sadly', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'probably', 'considered', 'old', 'guy', 'most', 'reviewers', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'boxed', 'set', 'twenty-eight', 'years', 'age', ""'m"", 'probably', 'twice', 'as', 'old', 'most', 'folks', ""n't"", 'matter', 'really', 'love', 'boxed', 'set', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'original', 'Degrassi', 'shows', 'PBS', 'Louisiana', 'cast', 'was', 'roughly', 'two', 'years', 'older', 'was', 'found', 'relating', 'lot', 'new', 'series', 'catch', 'up', 'old', 'favorites', 'as', 'well', 'introduces', 'new', 'crop', 'kids', 'going', 'great', 'life-changing', 'period', 'know', 'junior', 'high', 'high', 'school.This', 'new', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'new', 'series', 'Many', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'pre-teens', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'Emma', 'J.T.', 'Toby', 'Manny', 'Ashley', 'Paige', 'etc', ""'re"", 'also', 'introduced', 'parents', 'One', 'parents', 'very', 'familiar', 'old', 'folks', 'Emma', 'mom', 'Ms.', 'Nelson', 'Spike', 'original', 'show', ""'ll"", 'become', 'quite', 'close', 'Emma', 'media', 'immersion', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simpson', 'Once', 'again', 'old', 'folks', 'will', 'probably', 'recognize', 'Mr.', 'Simpson', 'Snake', 'old', 'show', 'returning', 'favorite', 'Joey', 'Jeremiah', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'goofy', 'kid', 'wore', 'fedorah', 'Many', 'older', 'castmembers', 'show', 'up', 'class', 'reunion', 'end', 'episode', 'two.The', 'new', 'cast', 'fun', 'watch', 'funny', 'how', 'kids', 'days', 'still', 'deal', 'many', 'same', 'problems', 'other', 'teenagers', 'deal', 'Everything', 'sex', 'drug', 'abuse', 'first', 'loves', 'dealt', 'are', 'few', 'new', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'days', 'however', 'One', 'such', 'temptation', 'internet', 'romance', 'Emma', 'sticky', 'situation', 'subject', 'dealt', 'Ashley', 'having', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'father', 'gay', 'homosexuals', 'have', 'been', 'forever', 'think', 'first', 'teen', 'show', 'particular', 'situation', 'Spinner', 'behavior-controlling', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'ritelin', 'forgive', 'spelling', 'Jimmy', 'uses', 'particular', 'drugs', 'give', 'edge', 'basketball', 'J.T', 'Toby', 'check', 'out', 'little', 'internet', 'porn', 'usual', 'blasted', 'parents', 'catch', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'newer', 'problems', 'are', 'addressed', 'show.Some', 'problems', 'have', 'hampered', 'teens', 'dawn', 'time', 'are', 'addressed', 'well', 'Toby', 'big-time', 'Emma', 'who', 'captivated', 'Sean', 'Sean', 'meanwhile', 'busted', 'alcoholic', 'family', 'Paige', 'friends', 'get', 'what', 'Terry', 'overweight', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'Liberty', 'failure', 'classroom', 'etc.', 'etc', 'What', 'get', 'teenage', 'soap-opera', 'deals', 'real', 'issues.Granted', 'problems', 'are', 'hokey', '100', '%', 'cheese', 'break', 'intensity', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'acting', ""n't"", 'superb', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'show', 'either', 'What', 'end', 'up', 'program', 'pre-teens', 'can', 'watch', 'feeling', 'are', 'being', 'preached', 'lectured', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'deal', 'problems', 'same', 'way', 'average', 'kid', 'would', 'days.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'fun', 'karaoke', 'where', 'get', 'sing', 'theme', 'song', 'casting', 'call', 'section', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'youngsters', 'try', 'out', 'roles', 'blooper', 'reel', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'best', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'oldsters', 'one', 'up', 'lot', 'old', 'characters', 'original', 'shows.I', 'recommend', 'boxed', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', 'relive', 'old', 'days', 'youth', 'More', 'importantly', 'recommend', 'set', 'teachers', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'teach', 'kids', 'having', 'hammer', 'speech', 'down', 'throats', 'Kids', 'connect', 'characters', 'show', 'life', 'little', 'bit', 'easier', 'deal', 'once', 'realize', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'deal', 'particular', 'teenage', 'problems']",N/A

Degrassi: TNG is different, however.  It really goes the distance with the drama.  The show deals with self-consciousness, underage drinking, kids coming from very troubled backgrounds...and those troubles seem to surface every now and then, drugs, and so much more.Even though I never watched Degrassi: Junior High, I really like how a few characters from that have reprised their roles.  Not many shows do that.This show isn't only for teenagers; I'm 25 and can remember (by watching this show) all of the drama I went through when I was in junior high and high school.

This is how I found myself purchasing season one of Degrassi : TNG. Even in the first season, this show from our Canadian friends packs a brutal punch. In the opening two episodes, Emma decides to meet a sixteen year old she met online, only to discover that it's really a 30-40 ish man who wants to have sex with a child. In other episodes, Emma gets her period for the first time and receives help from an unlikely Paige. Toby and JT decide to entertain themselves by looking at some porn online, and in the season finale: good girl Ashley takes some ecstasy JT got and ends up breaking up with Jimmy, telling off Paige, and almost sleeping with Sean.American television just will not touch these issues, so if your looking for something that feels a little bit more realistic than Gossip Girl or any ""reality show"" currently orbiting the corpse that used to be MTV.

If I hadn't watched Season 2 of the show while watching Season 1, I'd have probably been less confused about Ashley but less interested in the show. By the time I got to Season 3, I was officially hooked but the first season was just so-so. The ecstasy episode was hilarious, and the episode about Jimmy trying to make the basketball team and taking his friend's prescription drug was an interesting episode. However, some of the episodes lagged behind. Emma's character is rather annoying, and I'm not at all interested in her mother or the teacher's role so that slowed me down. The episode about cheerleading has been done so many times on so many different shows so that got old quick, too. The ""Mating Game"" episode about peer pressure and sex was interesting, but I just didn't buy into it. I can't think of one boy in high school (or even junior high) would react the way Jimmy did in the end. It was cute, but I gave that episode a *blank stare* for not being believable. The ""Rumours and Reputations"" episode was far more realistic for that crowd, and the way the episode played out kept my attention. I'm not quite sure why I like Liberty's character more than Emma's considering they're both goody two shoes, but something about Liberty is adorably annoying. Emma's driving me crazy.

I could so relate to the series.  When Michelle's father burned the food & started crying after his wife walked out that was my life!!  I felt a certain affinity for Michelle for packing up & moving out because she couldn't stand her fathers racism towards her new boyfriend BLT.My main problem with the new generation is that the children act like adults.  Sure in the first season the kids pretty much acted like kids but they quickly grew up and became super glammed up tiny adults.  I could hardly listen to Paige go on & on about how wonderful she's going to do at Banting College.  She gets into Banting only to freak out, burn down her dorm room & drop out.  Paige has a crush on Alex who turns to stripping instead of college.  I can't relate to either of those characters.  When I was in high school I did not have it all figured out.  I hardly have it more figured out now.  It doesn't sit well with me to watch 15 year olds wax on about how their lives are going to be wonderful once they get discovered like Manny wants to be.  I could care less about Craig.  When his character was introduced there was an air of mystery about him.  He's quickly turned into the typical guy with a tiny bit of talent who uses his charm to seduce any girl he can.  I don't find his character attractive.  I didn't know nor do I know any 16 year olds who are touring the world or going around to pubs playing music and snorting coke.  Sorry, doesn't happen that often in the real world.  Craig talks Ashley into sleeping with him at the same time he's sleeping with Manny who winds up pregnant. I still don't understand how Manny knew the baby was Craig's & not Sully's since she was sleeping with them both at the same time. In a perfect world, Ashley would see through Craig for what he was.  She goes on this tangent about how she wanted to DIEEEEEE last semester.  I remember crushes in high school and feeling that bad also but at some point you need to get a grip & move on.I feel Caitlin needs to do the same thing.  I can't believe that she is STILL stuck on Joey.  In Degrassi High, Joey basically did a Craig on Caitlin.  Joey slept with Tessa Campeneli while he slept with Caitlin for the first time.  If I were Caitlin I'd declare Joey dead to me.  I wouldn't get caught back into the madness 15 years later!!!I find Peter super annoying.  I can totally see how his character could suck some gullible gals in.  Looks wise he's attractive but I don't find anything else about him attractive.  Sure he posted the video of Manny pulling down her top at a party in the bathroom all over the school that was half his problem and half Manny's. Just because Manny was drunk doesn't mean that she's innocent of her actions.  I also have a problem with Emma.  She started out as this odd looking blonde string bean and she blossomed into a very pretty girl but I think she takes it too far.  I have a problem with her over made up look in every frame.  She's in high school!!  I don't understand the whole cheer squad thing as well.  Aren't there any ""Adults"" who are leading the squad?  How in the world can the school of Degrassi let high school students choose who gets to be on the squad and who doesn't?I know this post is rambling but it lays out some of the problems I have with the show.  One thing I liked about the original Degrassi was that the kids were kids and they'd say ""I'm just a kid I don't know everything.""

But never gave the series not much of a thought because I was too busy with American television series at the time.  Back when American television still had great television.  I watched a few episodes of the series on The-N website and was instantly hooked.  One interesting aspect of the series is they actually teenagers playing teenagers.  Something that doesn't happened in the U.S.  Another thing, that get me hooked was the fact that the series takes some real risk.  No disrespect to good Teen Dramas i.e. Season one and Season Two of Dawson's Creek & Everwood.  But most teen drama series begin with, the oddity which is the first day of a new school.  Degrassi has this but it has something I had never seen anyone dare try in their first episode which is Cyber Predators.  What the first episode of this new series does is bridge fans of Degrassi High - The Complete Collection and viewers of this new series.  So if you are a new viewer of the Degrassi univirse like I am, you are not completely confused.  And if you are a long time viewer of the two previous Degrassi series; it is like meeting up with old friends again.  The first season of Degrassi The Next Generation deals with such things as rape, your first date, jealousy, body image, drugs, porn, drinking, peer pressure and all things young kidsdeal with when they are young without all the over the top BS you get on One Tree Hill and Gossip Girl.  The first season sets up relationships and friendships that are still on going now in the series 7th season and some that are taken to the 10th level in future seasons.  Like friendships such as, Manny Santos & Emma Nielson, Spinner Mason & Jimmy Brooks.  And rivals like Paige Michalchuk & Manny Santos.  Season One also begins the iconic relationships of Liberty Van Zandt & J.T. York, and Emma Nielson & Sean Cameron a relationship to this day fans of the series' wonder if they will ever be.  If you despise teen dramas of all kinds then do not purchase these DVD's.  If you don't mind going back and  seeing as close to junior high & high school a television series can be.
