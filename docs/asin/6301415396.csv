In this low-keyed, understated drama of teenage angst and its aftermath, we are treated to some very three-dimensional characters that we can develop feelings about. We probably all know someone like the movie's characters and it's often sad to think they, too, like the characters in the movie, are ""stuck in an existential rut.""Very nice acting, good retro music, and realistic situations. Arquette has never been more charming than in this movie; you can really see why she created such a stir a few years back.",4,Time to sink back into the chair and relish your own life,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,623,"['Sometimes', 'people', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'best', 'years', 'lives', 'most', 'troubling', 'low-keyed', 'understated', 'drama', 'teenage', 'angst', 'aftermath', 'are', 'treated', 'very', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'can', 'develop', 'feelings', 'probably', 'know', 'someone', 'movie', 'characters', 'often', 'sad', 'think', 'too', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'stuck', 'existential', 'rut', 'Very', 'nice', 'acting', 'good', 'retro', 'music', 'realistic', 'situations', 'Arquette', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'charming', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'why', 'created', 'stir', 'few', 'years', 'back']",Baby It's You VHS
252381,A33R4E8T9KVLOM,6301415396,Drew Hunkins,"[5, 5]","The great film director John Sayles delivers with this magnificent film. Its release date is 1983 while the setting is essentially 1960s Trenton New Jersey. Arquette tosses in one of the best acting performances you'll ever see and Spano more than holds his own in what is probably the best love story of the last twenty years.What makes this one work is the incredibly real dialogue along with the progression of time and setting. Unlike other similar films this one is special because it charts the relatively typical high school romance into the post high school work and college world. The smallest lines in the script are truly brilliant and filled with realism. The scene where Arquette meets an old classmate in a working class bar is priceless (""We used to be in gym class together""). Later her portrayal of drunken and stoned college reminiscing is also sensational.Sayles sprinkles some timely 60s Motown and rock n roll into the scenes and also adds in some 70s Springsteen fare that help to give the film an authentic texture. He absolutely nails the scene in which they take a weekday trip to the deserted boardwalk. Also, the depiction of the argument and conversation in her dorm is brilliant in its simplicity and reality.Baby It's You has sort of an independent film feel to it, which isn't unusual given that Sayles made his bones with excellent works such as the Return of the Secaucus Seven and Matewan.

252384,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,6301415396,Mary Esterhammer-Fic,"[7, 7]","I saw this film when it first came out, and it was love at first viewing. I have always liked John Sayles; whether his medium is film or print, he's an amazing storyteller.This is the bittersweet coming-of-age tale of two star-crossed teenagers growing up in 1960's New Jersey. Jill Rosen (Rosanna Arquette)  is a privileged Jewish girl destined for one of the Seven Sisters colleges and, eventually, marriage to someone with a future. Albert (""Sheik"") Capadalupo is a working-class Italian boy who reveres Frank Sinatra and drives around with his best friend in a hotrod called the Ratmobile. (And yes, there's a story behind Sheik's nickname.) At first, their romance is thrilling: Sheik is madly in love with Jill, and Jill finds bad-boy Sheik exciting.But when Jill goes off to college, the dynamics of their relationship change. Sayles does this really well: the characters outgrow each other, or rather the environment that propelled their relationship, and they have to find new common ground...if it exists.Sayles is also a Springsteen fan, and he incorporates a song from each of Bruce's first four albums, in order. Springsteen's music, along with other selections, make this a good soundtrack, too.Parts of this movie are funny, parts are sad, but it's all compelling. It is just as poignant as ""Breaking Away"" and ""Stand by Me"", though those are buddy flicks and this is a romantic drama. Watch for it on TV or buy a copy and hook up your old VCR.

It is a sleeper hit in my opinion-- a story of ending high school and heading for college, at least for the female lead, whereas her boyfriend is not college material and tries to make it as a club singer. They try to have a romance, though they have differences, but because they are both scared of their new lives they keep trying to hold on to one another. I can not put my finger on it, but I really like this movie. The soundtrack is great too, with songs of the 60's.

252387,A1DE6049MCZ3CE,6301415396,Roy Gordon,"[4, 4]","This is one of my favorite films and, along with Lone Star, my favorite film of John Sayles. Some of Sayles' films seem to me to be emotionally removed, but not here. He's committed, and it makes all the difference.It features Rosanna Arquette in a terrific performance that put her on the map. Vincent Spano, the other lead, is good. He's an underrated actor, imo.The film initially seems to be one of those early 60's nostalgia pics, but soon changes its tone. It is a coming of age film for both Arquette and Spano, primarily Arquette, but Spano's intertwined story, mostly seen from his relationship to Arquette, is also interesting.Unlike most coming of age films which center of some one event in which the character's naive youthful idealist views receive some a dose of adult world reality, resulting in disillusion, this film shows the growth of Arquette from a high school senior through her first year of college. Like real lives that I'm familiar with, it's a bumpy road with both successes and failures and a lot of insecurities. Events such as sex are important, but they're fit in as one happening among others along that bumpy road to maturation, not some highlight, single defining moment of her life. And, as in other Sayles films, there is an open ended ending, not some neat Hollywood tie up where Arquette emerges having overcome All, with the implicit ""and lived happily ever after.""The film is quite original this way. It's one I can relate to, in the general way, of my, and I think, most people's development. With Sayles emotional commitment it remains one of my favorite films.
