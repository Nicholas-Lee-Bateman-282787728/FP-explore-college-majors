1346542,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B003IISTE0,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[269, 290]","This tale, based on a best-selling book by Spanish novelist Valerie Tasso, centers on a woman who, since her first sexual encounter, has had a strong desire to explore the heightened sense of arousal and euphoria she experiences each time she has sex. Her appetite is almost unquenchable, her lovers many and varied. She lives by the credo her grandmother (Geraldine Chaplin) instilled in her, not to deny herself the pleasures of life, whatever they be.When she thinks she's finally found true love and all that comes with the Cinderella complex, the dream dissolves, becoming a dark nightmare as she discovers the man of her dreams is insanely jealous, petty, paranoid, violent and abusive. So much for attempting to live out a 'normal' life, she then returns to the barrage of sexual escapades of an insatiable appetite by taking a job at a high class brothel.The movie is anything but sleazy or exploitive, contrary to what I've written, and there are no moral judgments handed down in a holy high court of decency, no punishments enforced for living this lifestyle, no answers served up, no justifications or repercussions, etc., etc. It's not about 'good' or 'bad' people or decisions, we're more concerned here with the drama of the internal conflict as an evolutionary mechanism than the erotic aspects of the story, though they are frequent and prolific throughout the film. Nudity flows like water from a spigot, but it's handled expertly, artistically and erotically.The underlining idea here is the double-standard that the word and concept of ""nymphomania"" is mans creation, utilized when a woman has sexual appetites similar or in excess to his own. (Another way to look at it is ""It ain't easy being pretty, it ain't pretty being easy"", but I'm being facetious). This notion frightens most men more than they'd care to admit.The main character, excellently portrayed by Belen Fabra, carries the entire film on her shoulders, trapped by her need to experiment and lose herself in an unflinching quest for fulfillment, without guilt, conscience or remorse, determined to live her life without denial or regret. She's a triple-threat to our religious-based society, and the world's better off because of it. A well-crafted slice of exploitive arthouse drama that's worthy of watching.",4,Arthouse Exploitation That's More 'Art' Than 'Ex'...,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,2296,"['tale', 'based', 'best-selling', 'book', 'Spanish', 'novelist', 'Valerie', 'Tasso', 'centers', 'woman', 'who', 'first', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'had', 'strong', 'desire', 'explore', 'heightened', 'sense', 'arousal', 'euphoria', 'time', 'sex', 'appetite', 'almost', 'unquenchable', 'lovers', 'many', 'varied', 'credo', 'grandmother', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'instilled', 'not', 'deny', 'pleasures', 'life', 'be.When', 'finally', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'Cinderella', 'complex', 'dream', 'becoming', 'dark', 'nightmare', 'man', 'dreams', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'petty', 'paranoid', 'violent', 'abusive', 'So', 'much', 'attempting', 'live', 'out', ""'normal"", 'life', 'then', 'barrage', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'insatiable', 'appetite', 'taking', 'job', 'high', 'class', 'brothel.The', 'movie', 'anything', 'sleazy', 'exploitive', 'contrary', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'are', 'moral', 'judgments', 'handed', 'down', 'holy', 'high', 'court', 'decency', 'punishments', 'enforced', 'living', 'lifestyle', 'answers', 'served', 'up', 'justifications', 'repercussions', 'etc.', 'etc', 'not', 'about', ""'good"", 'people', 'decisions', ""'re"", 'more', 'concerned', 'here', 'drama', 'internal', 'conflict', 'evolutionary', 'mechanism', 'erotic', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'frequent', 'prolific', 'film', 'Nudity', 'water', 'spigot', 'handled', 'expertly', 'artistically', 'erotically.The', 'underlining', 'idea', 'here', 'double-standard', 'word', 'concept', 'nymphomania', 'mans', 'creation', 'utilized', 'when', 'woman', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'similar', 'excess', 'own', 'way', 'look', 'ai', ""n't"", 'easy', 'being', 'pretty', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'being', 'easy', ""'m"", 'being', 'facetious', 'notion', 'most', 'men', 'more', ""'d"", 'care', 'admit.The', 'main', 'character', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'Belen', 'Fabra', 'entire', 'film', 'shoulders', 'trapped', 'need', 'experiment', 'lose', 'unflinching', 'quest', 'fulfillment', 'guilt', 'conscience', 'remorse', 'determined', 'live', 'life', 'denial', 'regret', 'triple-threat', 'religious-based', 'society', 'world', 'better', 'well-crafted', 'slice', 'exploitive', 'arthouse', 'drama', 'worthy', 'watching']",N/A

A taboo subject treated tastefully, the execution of the movie is excellent, the script, the settings, the photography, the art, the music, the direction, everything is done very well.  But, I must say Bel&eacute;n's performance is flawless, she mainly had all the responsibility of the movie on her shoulders, and she delivers a brilliant performance.  As Valeria Tasso said: ""The most difficult and wonderful dress a woman wears is the nudity and Belen wears it with dignity, honor and attitude"".  This film is absolutely thought and action provoking, I'm very glad films like this are being presented, specially in Spanish, where in name of the ""religion and decency"" the nymphomaniac is still something that is valid.  This movie presents a portrait of a woman who looks for love in all the wrong places, she wants intimacy and she looks for it through sex, she ends up in toxic relationships that put even her life in danger.  And, until she finds herself and learns to love and accept herself, she finds peace with who she is, and from that moment she doesn't care if she's called a nymphomaniac.  I think this concept of ""nymphomaniac"" is vanishing, is pointless, the sexual pleasure of a woman is a birth right, of course we have to enjoy this right with responsibility, and with love and respect to ourselves and demand that from our partners.I think this movie is a must see for every woman, may be we don't agree with everything, and of course you have to see it with an open mind, sadly, it's easier to judge than to understand, but it's an excellent movie, and it has become one of my favorities.

1346550,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B003IISTE0,C McGhee,"[26, 31]","*******SPOILERS*******Diary of a Nymphomaniac is a story framed around the sexual journeys of a woman yet, that is not the message of the movie. I do admit it appears that way for a very large portion of the story.  It is a very graphic telling of the life of a woman that is easily intoxicated by the tactile & sensual just as the title would indicate. There's a lot of nudity & lots of sexual activity so much of it in fact that it would be easy to see this as simply an exploitation movie. It certainly isn't that however.Directed by Christina Molina & made in Spain with Spanish & French language tracks & English subtitles the movie Stars Belen Fabra as Valerie the nymphomaniac & Geraldine Chaplin as her Grandmother / counselor. At the start of the story we are shown Valerie's obsession with the tactile, the sensual & see her exploration of that part of her personality. She moves through various relationships from casual to professional while always having the small voice inside her mind questioning about normality. She knows she is abnormal sexually & wonders if love is possible.Enter, a man she comes to love & is willing to give up all her sexual freedom for. He's rich, successful, handsome & romantic, her dream lover. Committing herself to him she discovers that he is also not a great lover. That does not deter her in the least. She wishes he was different but will accept him as he is. That is when she learns he is also insanely jealous & of course when the jealousy strikes he is vile & abusive. Her only escape is to leave him even though as she says, ""I still love him""This brings her full circle back into having only herself to deal with & she returns to her former life in order to rid herself of these memories that beset her from her `love gone bad'. Yet she is morose & searches her memory for her Grandmother's advice which has always been to not let any pleasure in life pass her by. Her grandmother, who has passed away, was a woman married to one man for many years that enjoyed home life & needlecraft. It's here at the end that Valerie understands that her grandmother's advice was to accept herself as she is & enjoy being Valerie. She has not escaped her love of the tactile & sensual but she has escaped the self doubts about who she is. Now she finally has a chance of getting a grasp on her sensual nature.It really is a mental health workers movie as the theme could be applied to any situation one is confronted with inside yourself that you just can't seem to change. The movie could have been made about a person that just can't quit smoking but then who would watch that. The degree of sexuality in this movie is high but it is also tastefully done & central to the storyline. The drawback is that lots of people will watch for the sex scenes only & then the message goes a' glimmering. I believe that's the viewer's problem, not the directors. I did enjoy Geraldine Chaplin's part in this show even though it's small. The quite, self-assured advice given without explanation played well at the end of the movie.",4,Are they talking to me?,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,3061,"['*******SPOILERS*******Diary', 'Nymphomaniac', 'story', 'framed', 'sexual', 'journeys', 'woman', 'yet', 'not', 'message', 'movie', 'do', 'admit', 'way', 'very', 'large', 'portion', 'story', 'very', 'graphic', 'telling', 'life', 'woman', 'easily', 'intoxicated', 'tactile', 'sensual', 'just', 'title', 'would', 'indicate', 'lot', 'nudity', 'lots', 'sexual', 'activity', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'see', 'simply', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'that', 'however.Directed', 'Christina', 'Molina', 'made', 'Spain', 'Spanish', 'French', 'language', 'tracks', 'English', 'movie', 'Stars', 'Belen', 'Fabra', 'Valerie', 'nymphomaniac', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'Grandmother', '/', 'counselor', 'start', 'story', 'are', 'shown', 'Valerie', 'obsession', 'tactile', 'sensual', 'see', 'exploration', 'part', 'personality', 'various', 'relationships', 'casual', 'professional', 'while', 'always', 'having', 'small', 'voice', 'mind', 'questioning', 'normality', 'abnormal', 'sexually', 'wonders', 'love', 'possible.Enter', 'man', 'love', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'rich', 'successful', 'handsome', 'romantic', 'dream', 'lover', 'Committing', 'also', 'not', 'great', 'lover', 'not', 'deter', 'least', 'was', 'different', 'will', 'accept', 'when', 'also', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'course', 'when', 'jealousy', 'strikes', 'vile', 'abusive', 'only', 'escape', 'leave', 'even', 'still', 'love', 'full', 'circle', 'back', 'having', 'only', 'deal', 'former', 'life', 'order', 'rid', 'herself', 'memories', 'beset', 'love', 'gone', 'bad', 'morose', 'memory', 'Grandmother', 'advice', 'always', 'been', 'not', 'let', 'pleasure', 'life', 'pass', 'grandmother', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'was', 'woman', 'married', 'one', 'man', 'many', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'home', 'life', 'needlecraft', 'here', 'end', 'Valerie', 'grandmother', 'advice', 'was', 'accept', 'enjoy', 'being', 'Valerie', 'not', 'escaped', 'love', 'tactile', 'sensual', 'escaped', 'self', 'doubts', 'who', 'Now', 'finally', 'chance', 'getting', 'grasp', 'sensual', 'nature.It', 'really', 'mental', 'health', 'workers', 'movie', 'theme', 'could', 'be', 'applied', 'situation', 'one', 'confronted', 'inside', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'change', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'person', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quit', 'smoking', 'then', 'who', 'would', 'watch', 'degree', 'sexuality', 'movie', 'high', 'also', 'tastefully', 'done', 'central', 'storyline', 'drawback', 'lots', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'sex', 'only', 'then', 'message', 'glimmering', 'believe', 'viewer', 'problem', 'not', 'directors', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'part', 'show', 'even', 'small', 'quite', 'self-assured', 'advice', 'given', 'explanation', 'played', 'well', 'end', 'movie']",N/A

And it is a ""versus"" situation for all of us.  This movie tries, not always successfully, to dramatize this struggle.  The particular illustration here is a young woman's ""nymphomania"".  For her, the act of lovemaking becomes an exploration of bodily delights that has no end destination.  Once attained, the summit of pleasure immediately calls again.  There is no ""enough for a while"".  We can say the same for people who want to read books all day to the exclusion of any other practical business, or watch TV 16 hours a day, or eat junk-food at every meal, or gamble their paycheck away, or smoke cigarettes, or drink to excess every night.  Very generally speaking, men seem more susceptible to this form of self-destruction than women -- the statistics bear this out -- probably for biological reasons; all the more interesting, therefore, to have a female character as our guide on this journey of self-destructive pleasure-seeking.She lives an otherwise ""normal"" life; she has a job.  But the nights and weekends are given over to lust, to the point that she seeks out strangers on the street.  This early portion of the movie is interesting as we watch this tension play out.  But the movie starts slipping when a shot at a ""normal"" romantic relationship is followed by a sanitized view of brothel life.  The madam runs her establishment without muscle -- what, no concern for her ""investments""?  It's embarrassingly obvious that the writers have no idea of what they're depicting, even in world-weary Spain.  Add a fanciful imagination to preconceptions derived from a hundred movies and you get what the director shows us here.Without describing the denouement, let me just say that I have news for the scriptwriter:  obsessions are not so easily accommodated.  Most end destructively, and then simply mutate into different obsessions.  (Example: that ex-smoker ""health nut"" you may know in your life.)To see this subject from the male point of view, I recommend ""Shame"" with Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan.  No ""you-go-girl"" (or I should say, ""you-go-boy"") uplift in that movie, no self-accepting resolutions, no closure; rather, just the usual ambiguities.

It is brave of director and producer of this film to transfer that novel to the screen.  Movie is authentic since Ms. Tasso participately in creating a screenplay and she guided actress in the main role throughout the process.I like the fact that both author and director challange the idea about double standard for sexual conduct of men and women.  This film, is a story about the woman who breaks all of those barriers.  Very early in her life, she realizes that it is sexual energy that keeps her going through life.  She is determined to experiment with everyone and everything willing to try anything and everything out of ordinary.  The heroine of the film knows that she is not like every day woman.  She accepts it and works through it in order to learn how to conquer her own needs and desires.It is challanging movie and certainly not for everyone.  For more open minded, it is exploration of human condition that is often viewed as taboo.  I would put this movie in the same class as ""Belle Du Jour"" or ""Jamon, Jamon"".
