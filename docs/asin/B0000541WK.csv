In my opinion, Richard is a triple treat in all those aspects.As far as this DVD routine goes, I haven't been able to get past level one yet; I've been in a bit of a health challenge for several months so for me and my somewhat limited abilities at the moment this is a serious workout. I rotate this with other exercise and I am looking forward to going further with Disco Sweat in the coming months.The disco songs are fun and familiar. The moves aren't too hard to follow and if I get lost I just march in place for a moment to catch up. I found it easiest to watch one particular person in the crowd that was doing modifiers of the moves and to try to keep pace with him/her. This is nearly an hour long from start to finish so you can break it up into more manageable sections or do the whole thing if you're able to. Richard keeps the energy high by by giving positive shout outs to you the whole way.If you like kitschy and over the top sparkle gym shorts on your fitness cheerleader you will LOVE this DVD.Recommended for those who want a good workout and those who want to have fun doing so.",4,"okay, laugh all you want....",1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,1335,"['Richard', 'Simmons', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'healthy', 'loose', 'weight', 'really', 'believe', 'should', 'look', 'track', 'records', 'works', 'integrity', 'who/what', 'truly', 'motivating', 'opinion', 'Richard', 'triple', 'treat', 'aspects.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'routine', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'get', 'past', 'level', 'one', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'health', 'challenge', 'several', 'months', 'so', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'abilities', 'moment', 'serious', 'workout', 'rotate', 'other', 'exercise', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'going', 'further', 'Disco', 'Sweat', 'coming', 'months.The', 'disco', 'songs', 'are', 'fun', 'familiar', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'follow', 'get', 'lost', 'just', 'march', 'place', 'moment', 'catch', 'up', 'found', 'easiest', 'watch', 'one', 'particular', 'person', 'crowd', 'was', 'doing', 'modifiers', 'moves', 'try', 'keep', 'pace', 'him/her', 'nearly', 'hour', 'long', 'start', 'finish', 'so', 'can', 'break', 'up', 'more', 'manageable', 'sections', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', ""'re"", 'able', 'Richard', 'energy', 'high', 'giving', 'positive', 'shout', 'outs', 'whole', 'way.If', 'kitschy', 'top', 'sparkle', 'gym', 'shorts', 'fitness', 'cheerleader', 'will', 'LOVE', 'DVD.Recommended', 'who', 'want', 'good', 'workout', 'who', 'want', 'have', 'fun', 'doing', 'so']",N/A

I remember Richard from 'way back, but this was the first time I'd seen him in action in decades. Cute routines and happy, real-looking people just dancin' around and having fun. I just couldn't wait to give it a try myself.When my husband got home that night, I asked, ""Remember disco?"" and he did the John Travolta pose and started grinnin'. ""Come on in here,"" I urged, and he joined me for a truly entertaining and energizing hour or so. We laughed and sweated and got some good exercise.Yes, the songs are choreographed, but it is nothing that you will find impossible. No, I doubt if you will pick up the steps the first time through, but personally I would not want to do a routine that is that easy. There are some neat little moves here that neither of us was familiar with and which we will add to our repetoires.I like that you can pick the individual songs you want from the DVD so you can practice. I did not find it at all annoying that Richard was singing along with the songs, as I was doing it, too. It was truly inspiring when the individual dancers were showcased and the amount of weight they had lost was revealed. Wow. Staying fit and healthy makes you feel like dancing.I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers: the guy who introduced the songs seemed out of place and, at times, annoying.

I love the music and the dance moves on the dvd.  My favorite tunes are:  ""Boggie Fever"", ""You Make Me Feel Mighty Real"" and ""Born To Be Alive"".  Richard incorporates a standing toning segment and abdominal crunch routine.  I like the fact that he has a cool down at the end of the aerobic segment and one at the end of the adbdominal crunch routine.  If I decide not to do the crunches, I have cooled down enough at the end of the aerobics.  I usually complete the abdominal work because Richard is most encouraging in this segment.  It's like he is speaking directly to me.  I LOVE this workout!!!

The workout is over an hour long, and it ends with a cool down number and floor work that is based on doing crunches for your abs.The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because some of the workouts have odd moves that don't seem very beneficial, and don't really go to the beat of the songs.

It came in a set with the Tone video or something I forgot. But I couldn't follow it so I decided to let it dust away in the cupboard.Now I'm 23 and I've gotten fat and wanna lose weight so I decided to exercise again. Since I love dancing so much (I was a dancer in my skinny years lol) I tried those hip hop dance workouts but non can make me really SWEAT without aching my body! The moves are fun yet cheesy and looking at 'large' people dancing in the background energetically motivates me even more because if they can do, so can I! Unlike all other workout videos that I own, they have skinny dancers and I couldn't follow their hardcore workout when I'm fat and heavy.Unfortunately I own the VHS version so the picture is grainy and looks like it was shot with a cheap camera, and sound is quite bad...but still bearable. I'm so happy there's a DVD version now.Some people that complaints about Simmons not instructing the steps and such, chill. After you workout a few times, you'll get the steps and you won't even realize it. For me, I didn't have problems at all because I'm a dancer but even if I wasn't, it's still not that hard to follow because when you've 'mastered' the steps you wouldn't want to listen to Simmons instructing over and over again like you're a beginner. You just wanna keep grooving and sweating and just keep going! Trust me, my other hip hop workout videos have instructions and when I've mastered the steps, those instruction becomes annoying!",5,"Burn, baby BURN!",1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,1602,"['bought', 'when', 'was', '14', 'something', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'was', 'saw', 'infomercial', 'program', 'came', 'set', 'Tone', 'video', 'something', 'forgot', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'so', 'decided', 'let', 'dust', 'away', 'cupboard.Now', ""'m"", '23', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'fat', 'wan', 'na', 'lose', 'weight', 'so', 'decided', 'exercise', 'again', 'love', 'dancing', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'dancer', 'skinny', 'years', 'lol', 'tried', 'hip', 'hop', 'dance', 'workouts', 'non', 'can', 'make', 'really', 'SWEAT', 'aching', 'body', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', 'yet', 'cheesy', 'looking', ""'large"", 'people', 'dancing', 'background', 'energetically', 'even', 'more', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'other', 'workout', 'own', 'have', 'skinny', 'dancers', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'hardcore', 'when', ""'m"", 'fat', 'heavy.Unfortunately', 'own', 'VHS', 'version', 'picture', 'grainy', 'was', 'shot', 'cheap', 'camera', 'sound', 'quite', 'bad', 'still', 'bearable', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'DVD', 'version', 'now.Some', 'people', 'complaints', 'Simmons', 'not', 'instructing', 'steps', 'such', 'chill', 'workout', 'few', 'times', ""'ll"", 'get', 'steps', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', ""'m"", 'dancer', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'still', 'not', 'that', 'follow', 'because', 'when', ""'ve"", ""'mastered"", 'steps', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'listen', 'Simmons', 'instructing', 'over', 'again', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'just', 'wan', 'na', 'keep', 'grooving', 'sweating', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'Trust', 'other', 'hip', 'hop', 'workout', 'videos', 'have', 'instructions', 'when', ""'ve"", 'mastered', 'steps', 'instruction', 'annoying']",N/A

It is hard to follow the routines and the music I was expecting to be more actual Disco melodies by original artists.  I suppose if you watch it enough times (more than 50 in my opinion), you will get the knack of it and be able to follow along with Simmons but I would not have bought this if I had know there were no original artists in the songtrack of this DVD.
