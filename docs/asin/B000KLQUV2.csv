1035178,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000KLQUV2,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 9]","`Jesus Camp' is a revealing document of the right-wing evangelical movement.  Like many people of any political or religious group, the old addage, ""God is on our side,"" is worn on most players' sleeves.  In the crossfire is Becky Fischer, Pentecostal evangelical children's minister and Mike Papantonio, radio host of the ""Ring of Fire"" program.  They are both at the heart of the left/right, red/blue, theocracy vs. oligarchy divide in our nation.  At the time of the filming, Sandra Day O'Connor retired and was about to be replaced on the Supreme Court by Samuel Alito.  The event anchors the focus of the documentary.  Not simply showing a series of observations, there are points that do come full circle.  One of the best scenes in the movie is when Fischer and Papartonio square off on his radio program.  Here he grills her about the difference between children learning and being indoctrinated.  He believes they've been brainwashed.  She asserts they need to be indoctrinated by her beliefs; otherwise, someone else will.  The developments that come before this confrontation give ample reasons to view this movie.There's a zealousness in the children that is pervasive throughout the DVD.  Showing great emotional trajectory, the children are seen raising their hands, crying, and speaking in tongues.  One articulate girl says that the quiet churches are dead churches, and the living churches are the ones that are active and lively.  (No one has shown her places where true believers pray quietly.)  In another scene, Fischer brings out a cardboard figure of President Bush that is nearly actual size.  She invokes all the young faithful to pray for their President.  (My mind kept going to churches where saints and medallions are blessed, and people are accused of idolatry.)  It is from the pulpit the children get fire and brimstone sermons that seethe at the secular culture and a war between Satan and Jesus.  The children are invoked to be key participants in this crusade.  They at first establish self-worth when quoting scripture, ""You were knit in your mother's womb;"" then they pass around plastic replicas of fetuses at different stages of development.  In passion they start to inflame the children.  One scene that particularly smacked of emotions is when a young girl evangelizing people goes to a park and asks one African-American man where he thought he'd go after he dies.  The man replies, ""To heaven.""  She then insists, ""Are you sure?""  He replies affirmative.  She leaves, only to be heard saying, ""I think that man's a Muslim,"" in disparaging tones.`Jesus Camp' has many sharp observations.  However, its import can give us much to ponder.  If Becky Fischer had her way, what would happen?  How many freedoms would people have?  Would we have to publically confess our sins and have policemen at our front doorstep, like the ""God Squad"" on patrol?  On the other hand, if Mike Papantonio had his way, would evangelicals be able to vote, run for office, or take part in the political process?  Would his vision of division of church and state be one where atheists are the only ones objective enough to make decisions and define morality?  I for one am almost glad for the divide, for it is better than having either alternative in the driver's seat.",5,Theocracy Vs.

1035179,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B000KLQUV2,alex bushman,"[6, 13]","There's plenty of material in this film to make people who aren't Christians to look at us as radicals from most of the footage in this film. What's clearly pointed out in this film by the sheer contrast is that the radio host is opposing what the people in the camp are practicing and vice-versa. The disturbing part of this is that there's no middle ground for introspection and that's the weakness of this film, and what keeps it from being an important work. It's merely a number of observances in the life of the people with no perspective on what we're seeing.  The only hints of perspective are contained within the somber and disturbing instrumental soundtrack. If only you got the sense that people were answering questions then the film wouldn't have this void of purpose and point of view.  One question that's no doubt in the minds of Christians, religious people, and secularists is this: faith does play a part in the public arena, but where do we draw the line when it comes to children and their views when it comes to teaching them? This film doesn't even attempt at answering this question, but it doesn't seem to be interested in problems and answers, it's just interested in observing people who talk about them without resolving them. As such, we're left with these things in our mind, thinking about them, and we don't get the sense the people in the film are.

What I saw, however, was far more ""normal"" and reminiscent of my own childhood Christian camp experiences - and, surprisingly, this made the movie far more terrifying than I had thought possible. Against my every expectation, I didn't see future murderers among these children - I saw future grown-ups wracked with the guilt and pain that so many of us still struggle with in the aftermath of rejecting the impossible standards of evangelical Christianity.The adults in this film, Pastor Becky in particular, display a complete lack of shame in their constant emotional abuse of these poor children. It is my strong opinion that these adults - shallow, dried, faithless shells of humans - keep these children in a constant cycle of guilt, fear, and relief in order for the adults to affirm to themselves the rightness of the religion they have devoted their lives, in order to avoid ever reevaluating their own faith, or their own beliefs. These abusers hold up an impossible standard for these children to adhere to, and then use that standard to bully the children to tears while asking them to rededicate their lives to Christ, over and over and over again. It's the cheap, crass showmanship that this sort of evangelical Christianity needs in order to survive.The Bible says ""Be still and know that He is God,"" but Pastor Becky knows better than the Bible, doesn't she? The evangelical movement simply can't have their children being still and at peace - they need a constant flux of tears, shouts, and screams in heavenly 'languages' to affirm that God really is there, that He really is with Pastor Becky. The adults constantly work these children up into an emotional frenzy, first of guilt, then of relief and happiness that their souls have been cleansed of sin once again and they are safe from hell once more... at least until the next time Pastor Becky needs them to cry for her. This frenzied need is shown time and again in the film, from the camp counselors forcing the kids to destroy china cups with a hammer or to pray a blessing over a cardboard cut-out of President Bush and to, quote, ""do some spiritual warfare over him, hummina hammina ha!""If you're an ex-evangelical Christian kid, watch this movie, but be aware that this movie can be very, very triggering. See how these adults manipulate their children in a cheap attempt to reaffirm their own shrunken, shriveled faith. Realize that the similar manipulation you suffered was just that - manipulation. And let go of a little more of the guilt that you still struggle with, even after all those years of brainwashing.

1035189,A1YZ2NO74DCP48,B000KLQUV2,Autumn Butterfly,"[13, 15]","When I was a child I often went to visit my cousins in VA., one of whom had been partially raised by my grandmother and was at the time a devout christian. She went to christian camp every summer for years and when we went to pick her up, she was always happy, well rested and upbeat. These trips really seemed to center her, to make her feel uplifted.Watching 'Jesus Camp' I saw none of that. These children were 'on fire' when they went in, then subjected to several days of psychological and spiritual abuse. The adults who ran the camp seemed to think that they were dealing with other adults rather than impressionable children, and some of the imagery used to reach these children was rather frightening.What we see in the film:* Children in camouflage face paint doing drills and talking about 'spiritual warfare'.* Children reduced to tears because they behaved differently at school than at church - they were told they were hypocrites and liars and their behavior was 'not of god'.* At night the children were in their bunks passing around a flashlight and telling ghost stories, and having a great time until an adult came in and scolded them and told them they needed to reconsider telling ghost stories because they were ungodly.* Some of the more disturbing scenes involved a little blonde haired boy who was obviously struggling to make himself believe. He simply could not do it, and it was truly painful to watch him try so hard to take it all in and force himself to buy into it all when his heart just wasn't into it. He couldn't have been more than eight or nine years old and already he felt like a failure. After his initial appearance, in which he explained his spiritual issues, we see glimpses of him here and there mainly just going through the motions. He raised his arms up and tried to take on the characteristic enraptured look, but ended up dropping them with a sigh that seemed to say 'what's the use?'.I used to teach Sunday school and VBS and I never saw anything like the 'Jesus Camp' crowd. There was the occasional babble and twitch but this came from the adults during the closing ceremonies. The fact that they had small children in Jesus Camp twitching on the floor, speaking gibberish and in tears constantly implies child abuse more than the joy of the spirit.The film actually ended up being quite objective, despite many arguments to the contrary here on Amazon. People from both sides were interviewed and heard, which made the presentation both fair and balanced. The beliefs of the christians reviewed and the non-christians were both fairly represented.I watched this with my oldest son and at the end we had a long discussion about what we had just seen. The conclusions we reached were that these people are hardcore disturbed, and projecting their own feelings of failure, ungodliness and dissatisfaction upon their innocent children. There was no enjoyment to be had at Jesus Camp; indeed every time the children began to relax and smile a little they were hit from all sides by a combative message, told they were liars, hypocrites and failures and made to cry. They prayed in terror of judgment for their perceived spiritual failings, then were set loose to proselytize to complete strangers.The entire situation is sick and disturbing and abusive. The film shows all of this unflinchingly, at times painfully, and makes me profoundly grateful that Becky Fischer is no longer in a position of authority over innocent children.",5,Truly disturbing,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,3480,"['When', 'was', 'child', 'often', 'went', 'visit', 'cousins', 'VA.', 'one', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'partially', 'raised', 'grandmother', 'was', 'time', 'devout', 'christian', 'went', 'christian', 'camp', 'summer', 'years', 'when', 'went', 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'always', 'happy', 'well', 'rested', 'upbeat', 'trips', 'really', 'seemed', 'center', 'make', 'feel', 'uplifted.Watching', 'Camp', 'saw', 'none', 'children', 'were', ""'on"", 'fire', 'when', 'went', 'then', 'subjected', 'several', 'days', 'psychological', 'spiritual', 'abuse', 'adults', 'who', 'ran', 'camp', 'seemed', 'think', 'were', 'dealing', 'other', 'adults', 'rather', 'impressionable', 'children', 'imagery', 'used', 'reach', 'children', 'was', 'rather', 'frightening.What', 'see', 'film', '*', 'Children', 'camouflage', 'face', 'paint', 'doing', 'drills', 'talking', ""'spiritual"", 'warfare', 'Children', 'reduced', 'tears', 'behaved', 'differently', 'school', 'church', 'were', 'told', 'were', 'hypocrites', 'liars', 'behavior', 'was', ""'not"", 'god', '*', 'night', 'children', 'were', 'bunks', 'passing', 'flashlight', 'telling', 'ghost', 'stories', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'adult', 'came', 'scolded', 'told', 'needed', 'reconsider', 'telling', 'ghost', 'stories', 'were', 'ungodly', '*', 'more', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'involved', 'little', 'blonde', 'haired', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'struggling', 'make', 'believe', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'was', 'truly', 'painful', 'watch', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'take', 'force', 'buy', 'when', 'heart', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'eight', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'already', 'felt', 'failure', 'initial', 'appearance', 'explained', 'spiritual', 'issues', 'see', 'glimpses', 'here', 'there', 'mainly', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'raised', 'arms', 'up', 'tried', 'take', 'characteristic', 'enraptured', 'look', 'ended', 'up', 'dropping', 'sigh', 'seemed', 'say', ""'what"", 'use', ""'.I"", 'used', 'teach', 'Sunday', 'school', 'VBS', 'never', 'saw', 'anything', ""'Jesus"", 'Camp', 'crowd', 'was', 'occasional', 'babble', 'twitch', 'came', 'adults', 'closing', 'ceremonies', 'fact', 'had', 'small', 'children', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'twitching', 'floor', 'speaking', 'gibberish', 'tears', 'constantly', 'child', 'more', 'joy', 'spirit.The', 'film', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'quite', 'objective', 'many', 'arguments', 'contrary', 'here', 'Amazon', 'People', 'sides', 'were', 'interviewed', 'heard', 'made', 'presentation', 'fair', 'balanced', 'beliefs', 'christians', 'reviewed', 'non-christians', 'were', 'fairly', 'represented.I', 'watched', 'oldest', 'son', 'end', 'had', 'long', 'discussion', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'conclusions', 'reached', 'were', 'people', 'are', 'hardcore', 'disturbed', 'projecting', 'own', 'feelings', 'failure', 'ungodliness', 'dissatisfaction', 'innocent', 'children', 'was', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'had', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'indeed', 'time', 'children', 'began', 'relax', 'smile', 'little', 'were', 'hit', 'sides', 'combative', 'message', 'told', 'were', 'liars', 'hypocrites', 'failures', 'made', 'cry', 'prayed', 'terror', 'judgment', 'perceived', 'spiritual', 'failings', 'then', 'were', 'set', 'loose', 'proselytize', 'complete', 'strangers.The', 'entire', 'situation', 'sick', 'disturbing', 'abusive', 'film', 'unflinchingly', 'times', 'painfully', 'profoundly', 'grateful', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'longer', 'position', 'authority', 'innocent', 'children']",Jesus Camp

It is a story of child abuse, in my opinion, and the extent to which the State of Missouri is involved is most unsettling, along with everything else.It is also a movie about the American Jihad: the Holy War being waged in the political arena by the conservative right of the Republican party and the evangelistic Christians who have large enough numbers to sway any election.The story centers around a camp run by an evangelical teacher of children. This so greatly resembled some of the pictures in ""Obsession"" [about Muslim children] that I literally got cold chills. For one week these kids are indoctrinated, brainwashed, propagandized to become Christian Soldiers, proselytizers for the fundamentalist faith, and quite specifically for the anti-abortion movement and for creationism, prayer and Bible reading in the public schools. They are practically blackmailed into making a promise to fight against abortion rights, they put on camouflage face paint and dance with sticks that are clapped together to a warrior's song. They are taught to repent so intensely that one dear little girl (the same one in the photo above) got so red in the face with hysterical crying I was afraid she would pass out. And what do they repent? Being afraid to tell their school friends about Jesus, to proselytize in their school classrooms.The movie includes a radio talk show host who offers a critical view of the situation, but still is a Christian, and in the end seems willing to give up to the fundies. It includes cuts from a televangelist in Colorado Springs who said some outrageous things, and then added ""If you use that, I will sue you."" I think he's the same one who was more recently arrested for buying drugs from a male prostitute, or something like that. The name starts with an ""F"" and no, I don't want to go back and watch it in order to get his name. He freaked me out.It's a very scary movie indeed, especially when you see this televangelist boldly saying that the fundamentalists (whom he calls ""evangelicals"") can sway any election. George Bush and his cronies and appointees know it, and we had better speak up about the separation of church and state before it is too late, if it isn't already. At the camp, the kids were offered a life-sized cardboard cut-out of President Bush with two kids holding a large American flag behind him, and told to pray for him, and to chant ""One nation under God"" over and over.I've joined Americans United for Separation of Church and State, but I think I need to do more.

When you're there, when you're feeling it and the Spirit Is In You, it's REAL, you ARE feeling God, and it's a feeling that is absolutely like none other... but scary, because they're using the mind's awesome power of Trancing Out to train children to be warriors.From there, the entire movie not only exposes the fanaticism and lunacy of it all, but also serves the demonstrate the hypocrisy of the Evangelical population.  We would not have had scientific progress if scientists had never challenged Church Doctrine, and yet all the Evangelical families shown are living with all the modern conveniences ~ packaged food, radios, televisions... The family sits at the table and denounces evolution, but I'd be willing to bet some serious money that when they get sick, they see a doctor and get medicine.  And yet modern antibiotics rely on the fundamental understanding of the process of evolution.Further, the Evangelicals denounce the Scandanavian countries as being ""godless"" and filled with the devil, and yet those are the only ones on the planet which have been able to acheive a strong Social Democracy.At the end, the radio guy (I must have missed his name somewhere, d'oh!) comments, ""... the more I hear about this, it just gets crazier and crazier....""

Basically, it follows a few pre-adolesent teens as they go from their fudimentalist Christian homes to a bible camp, run by pastor Becky Fischer. There, they speak in tounges, roll of the floor, and learn about the evils of abortion, Harry Potter, the Democratic Party and...........well, anyone that does not think exactally, and i do mean to the letter, the way they do.And the pity is, these are gentle, sweet, nice, kids, but they are being exposed to some of the worst bigotry and intolerance by Ficsher; this fruitcake wants to kill Harry Potter. She has the kids holding spears and dancing to a Jesus Worrier Dance. She also has them praying to a cut out of George W. Bush. Tell me--how many people died from Harry Potter books as oppesed to George W. Bush?Most disturbing is that she says she  wants her students to have the same fervor for Jesus that Bin-Ladin and co have for Islam.  ""Excuse me,"" she declares, ""but we have the truth."" Ah, well, good thing you told me, I guess its ok then. Now, how many people is it ok for you to get killed?Obama only has 7 and a half years left. There is bound to be a President Fischer likes elected at some point. There are plenty of abortion doctors, civil libaterians, tarot card readers, Americans that beleive in the law of gravity: Why doesn't this crucifix cupcake get a jump on things. She can start constructing the gas chambers now.She also says kids are a sizeible part of the world's popultion, and good tools to spread this thruth she has a monopoly on. She never sees the kids as people, or if she does, it is only because they think EXACTLY how she does.In once sequence, the kids get yelled at for telling ghost  stories in their bunks. God does not want them doing this. The staff at this camp needs make more money: how many people in child care know what god wants, PERSICELY. (Actually, God called me last night and said he wants me to have that '63 Corvette I always coveted. Any buyers?)Worst is, the kids eat this trash, hook, line and Hymmbook. At the end of Jesus Camp, one of the little girls is out prostlotizing, looks at a women, and says ""Oh, I think she's a Muslim."" ""There are two kinds of people,"" Mom says, ""those who love Jesus and those who don't.' The ones who do, they say, need to take America back. And, so, what happens to the rest of us?Just for curiosity--you might call it self-injury-I went to Fischer's website. There she brags about her junior army for Christ and b-tches that she has to see a Buddha statue when she goes to her her nails done.  It furthers my idea that you have a small but vocal group who think because they have chosen a certian set of beliefs, America is THEIRS! Anyone that does not buy in--gays, people into new age dogma, people who stand for tolerance, are a personal afront to them. Given the power, what would Fischer suggest: reeducation camps, prison, forced conversion?  This movie would be laughable if the ideas aspoused were not so frightening.The filmaking is good, but the problem is, except for a brief segment with an AIR America host (you have heard of comic releif?

Although I'm an advocate of personal freedom and liberty and the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit, this documentary challenged some of my assumptions just a bit.

1035195,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000KLQUV2,Brian E. Erland,"[66, 96]","I was raised in the Evangelical Christian church (Four Square Pentecostal) from birth until the age of sixteen and I attended similar summer camps as a child. I would say, speaking from first-hand, personal experience that Evangelical Christianity and the evangelistic techniques as portrayed in the film `Jesus Camp' provide a valid, true to life glimpse into this rapidly growing spiritual mindset and how it plays out in the religious education of their children. I left that movement quite a few years ago and have strongly felt disagreements with many of its beliefs and practices, so I was probably on some subconscious level expecting and maybe even hoping for a highly disturbing expose. Whether that's what I actually wanted or not, I must honestly say this film doesn't provide that anticipated result.The film is an honest depiction of a massive movement sweeping across the American landscape. Its impact will be felt spiritually, domestically and yes, politically for generations to come. Is it indoctrination? Yes, but what isn't? Should they be faulted, shunned or feared just because they've found a way to do it better than other persuasions have? If the films primary intent was to shock and upset the non-evangelical Christian than I would say it has failed in its mission.* At least in my case it has. However if its purpose was to present an honest look at a growing cultural phenomenon then it has indeed succeeded.* I couldn't help but notice while reading the credits that this documentary happens to be ""A Loki Films Production."" Loki is a devious Norse deity comparable to the Christian Devil. Coicidence?P.S.: An important things to remember about random statements and their meaning:- When an evangelical Christian speaks about; ""Those who would give up their lives for Jesus"" or ""Laying down their lives for the gospel"" there is no reason for the non-believer to run and hide. Such verbal expressions have absolutely nothing in common with Jihadist rhetoric. There is no strapping on of explosives or hints of suicide bombers suggested here. To make such inferences shows a clear lack of knowledge and understanding of Christian terminology being exercised by those who do.",5,"""Reclaiming America For Christ"" ~ The Culture War Has Begun",1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2202,"['was', 'raised', 'Evangelical', 'Christian', 'church', 'Four', 'Square', 'Pentecostal', 'birth', 'age', 'sixteen', 'attended', 'similar', 'summer', 'camps', 'child', 'would', 'say', 'speaking', 'first-hand', 'personal', 'experience', 'Evangelical', 'Christianity', 'evangelistic', 'techniques', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'provide', 'valid', 'true', 'life', 'glimpse', 'rapidly', 'growing', 'spiritual', 'mindset', 'how', 'out', 'religious', 'education', 'children', 'left', 'movement', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'strongly', 'felt', 'disagreements', 'many', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'was', 'probably', 'subconscious', 'level', 'expecting', 'maybe', 'even', 'hoping', 'highly', 'disturbing', 'expose', 'what', 'actually', 'wanted', 'not', 'must', 'honestly', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'provide', 'anticipated', 'result.The', 'film', 'honest', 'depiction', 'massive', 'movement', 'sweeping', 'American', 'landscape', 'impact', 'will', 'be', 'felt', 'spiritually', 'domestically', 'yes', 'politically', 'generations', 'come', 'indoctrination', 'Yes', 'what', ""n't"", 'Should', 'be', 'faulted', 'shunned', 'feared', 'just', ""'ve"", 'found', 'way', 'do', 'better', 'other', 'persuasions', 'have', 'films', 'primary', 'intent', 'was', 'shock', 'upset', 'non-evangelical', 'Christian', 'would', 'say', 'failed', 'mission', '*', 'least', 'case', 'However', 'purpose', 'was', 'present', 'honest', 'look', 'growing', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'then', 'indeed', 'succeeded', '*', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'reading', 'credits', 'documentary', 'be', 'A', 'Loki', 'Films', 'Production', 'Loki', 'devious', 'Norse', 'deity', 'comparable', 'Christian', 'Devil', 'Coicidence', 'P.S', 'important', 'things', 'remember', 'random', 'statements', 'meaning', 'When', 'evangelical', 'Christian', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'lives', 'Jesus', 'Laying', 'down', 'lives', 'gospel', 'reason', 'non-believer', 'run', 'hide', 'Such', 'verbal', 'expressions', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'common', 'Jihadist', 'rhetoric', 'strapping', 'explosives', 'hints', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'suggested', 'here', 'make', 'such', 'inferences', 'clear', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'understanding', 'Christian', 'terminology', 'being', 'exercised', 'who', 'do']",Jesus Camp
1035196,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000KLQUV2,calvinnme,"[9, 10]","I thought this film was very fair in its treatment of its subjects - Pentecostal Christians, and in particular, Pentecostal Christian children. At no point during the documentary do the film's makers step in to editorialize. Instead, they just train their camera on their subjects and let them do the talking. Of course, you can also watch the film with the commentary track on. However, even then the makers are talking more about why they included certain scenes and why they had to cut others than of their opinion about what is going on.In spite of the title, most of the film is not spent documenting what goes on at camp. It does focus on the activities and beliefs of just a few main subjects - two Pentecostal children Rachel and Levi, and also the woman who runs the Christian summer camp, Becky Fischer. It shows scenes of worship services, interaction among the children at camp, what goes on in their homes, and the children taking part in such typical activities as bowling. Prior to seeing this film I had heard some people say that the children were being coerced into witnessing and preaching, but I found that not to be the case. In particular the two children that the film focused on - Levi and Rachel - seemed to have an enthusiasm for their faith that was independent of whether an adult was around. Of course, taking the opposite viewpoint, children are always eager to please, and since these children have been immersed in this particular culture from birth, it is probably only natural they would have the world view that they do. The parents and Christian counselors involved also seem very sincere in their beliefs. You get the feeling that they are not trying to manipulate the children, they just want to save them from what they perceive to be an evil sinful world and get them involved in ""the good fight"" from an early age. What stood out as particularly alarming to me is that none of these Christian counselors, parents, or speakers ever seem to quote a Bible verse or encourage the children to learn the Bible itself, and that the adults seem to admire the kind of fanaticism that is present in the Middle East and think it is worth emulating that kind of indoctrination in their own children.The only person in this film that has a real Ick Factor is Ted Haggard. He winds up on screen because Levi is visiting Haggard's megachurch in Colorado Springs, obviously pre-controversy. Haggard is constantly making sarcastic comments to the cameraperson who is filming this movie, and you get the feeling he would throw the whole camera crew out in a second if he thought he could get away with it, politically speaking. What comes across as particularly slimy is when Levi goes up to meet Haggard and Haggard is giving Levi advice on how to play his ""cute kid angle"" to his advantage in his preaching. You can see from Levi's facial expression that he is not expecting this guy to be the disingenuous politician he turns out to be, but he is just too polite of a kid to be anything but respectful.This film is about Pentecostal Christians, not evangelical Christians in general. Evangelical Christian groups such as the Southern Baptists have a much more conventional form of worship than is displayed in this documentary. However, as the commentary track points out, most evangelical Christians, both Pentecostal and non-Pentecostal, do have most of the other viewpoints held in the film - most notably the intertwining of political and religious beliefs, the feeling that the United States was founded as a Christian nation, that it is both their religious and patriotic duty to bring America back to that standpoint, and that the children are the future of this fight. This gives a partial explanation as to why evangelical Christians continue to be a reliable voting bloc for people who are systematically at odds with their own best interests. For the ordinary and very genuine people portrayed in this film, their own earthly futures are unimportant, for they are constantly looking heavenward. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the politicians they vote into office and the deep corporate pockets to which these politicians are really in servitude.",5,A fair portrayal of some troubling trends,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,4194,"['thought', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'fair', 'treatment', 'subjects', 'Pentecostal', 'Christians', 'particular', 'Pentecostal', 'Christian', 'children', 'point', 'documentary', 'do', 'film', 'makers', 'step', 'editorialize', 'Instead', 'just', 'train', 'camera', 'subjects', 'let', 'do', 'talking', 'course', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'However', 'even', 'then', 'makers', 'are', 'talking', 'more', 'why', 'included', 'certain', 'scenes', 'why', 'had', 'cut', 'others', 'opinion', 'what', 'going', 'on.In', 'spite', 'title', 'most', 'film', 'not', 'spent', 'documenting', 'what', 'camp', 'focus', 'activities', 'beliefs', 'just', 'few', 'main', 'subjects', 'two', 'Pentecostal', 'children', 'Rachel', 'Levi', 'also', 'woman', 'who', 'Christian', 'summer', 'camp', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'scenes', 'worship', 'services', 'interaction', 'children', 'camp', 'what', 'homes', 'children', 'taking', 'part', 'such', 'typical', 'activities', 'bowling', 'Prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'had', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'children', 'were', 'being', 'coerced', 'witnessing', 'preaching', 'found', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'particular', 'two', 'children', 'film', 'focused', 'Levi', 'Rachel', 'seemed', 'have', 'enthusiasm', 'faith', 'was', 'independent', 'adult', 'was', 'around', 'course', 'taking', 'opposite', 'viewpoint', 'children', 'are', 'always', 'eager', 'please', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'immersed', 'particular', 'culture', 'birth', 'probably', 'only', 'natural', 'would', 'have', 'world', 'view', 'do', 'parents', 'Christian', 'counselors', 'involved', 'also', 'seem', 'very', 'sincere', 'beliefs', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'children', 'just', 'want', 'save', 'what', 'perceive', 'be', 'evil', 'sinful', 'world', 'get', 'involved', 'good', 'fight', 'early', 'age', 'What', 'stood', 'out', 'particularly', 'alarming', 'none', 'Christian', 'counselors', 'parents', 'speakers', 'ever', 'seem', 'quote', 'Bible', 'verse', 'encourage', 'children', 'learn', 'Bible', 'adults', 'seem', 'admire', 'kind', 'fanaticism', 'present', 'Middle', 'East', 'think', 'worth', 'emulating', 'kind', 'indoctrination', 'own', 'children.The', 'only', 'person', 'film', 'real', 'Ick', 'Factor', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'up', 'screen', 'Levi', 'visiting', 'Haggard', 'megachurch', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'obviously', 'pre-controversy', 'Haggard', 'constantly', 'making', 'sarcastic', 'comments', 'cameraperson', 'who', 'filming', 'movie', 'get', 'feeling', 'would', 'throw', 'whole', 'camera', 'crew', 'out', 'second', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'politically', 'speaking', 'What', 'across', 'particularly', 'slimy', 'when', 'Levi', 'up', 'meet', 'Haggard', 'Haggard', 'giving', 'Levi', 'advice', 'how', 'play', 'cute', 'kid', 'angle', 'advantage', 'preaching', 'can', 'see', 'Levi', 'facial', 'expression', 'not', 'expecting', 'guy', 'be', 'disingenuous', 'politician', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'polite', 'kid', 'be', 'anything', 'respectful.This', 'film', 'Pentecostal', 'Christians', 'not', 'evangelical', 'Christians', 'general', 'Evangelical', 'Christian', 'groups', 'such', 'Southern', 'Baptists', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'conventional', 'form', 'worship', 'displayed', 'documentary', 'However', 'commentary', 'track', 'points', 'out', 'most', 'evangelical', 'Christians', 'Pentecostal', 'non-Pentecostal', 'do', 'have', 'most', 'other', 'viewpoints', 'held', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'intertwining', 'political', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'feeling', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'founded', 'Christian', 'nation', 'religious', 'patriotic', 'duty', 'bring', 'America', 'back', 'standpoint', 'children', 'are', 'future', 'fight', 'partial', 'explanation', 'why', 'evangelical', 'Christians', 'continue', 'be', 'reliable', 'voting', 'bloc', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'systematically', 'odds', 'own', 'best', 'interests', 'ordinary', 'very', 'genuine', 'people', 'portrayed', 'film', 'own', 'earthly', 'futures', 'are', 'unimportant', 'are', 'constantly', 'looking', 'heavenward', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'politicians', 'vote', 'office', 'deep', 'corporate', 'pockets', 'politicians', 'are', 'really', 'servitude']",Jesus Camp

I have nothing but respect for the morality, character, awareness, and  honesty of believing Christians. (I am NOT one.) I have,  however, no respect, for the twisted history, cult pseudo-science, proudly professed brainwashing, and the avowed intention of transforming the world, or at least the United States, into more of the same, as clearly demonstrated by many of the adults in this documentary.As a personal religion, Christianity is not a problem, and I'm sure it has transformed many individual lives at least in part for the better.  When it acts as an active social, educational, and political movement dedicated to capturing the minds, hearts, and souls of everybody else, it is dangerous, and as far from any true spirit of democracy as anything the old communist totalitarians could devise.In Jesus Camp we see the conscious indoctrination of children by indoctrinated adults.  We see sometimes prescient young people who have incorporated many of the more mature tools of adult self-awareness in the service of their emotionally powerful religion.  And we see many of the classic forms of cult mind control used by at least some of the seeming ""normal average middle class mainstream Christian Americans"" of our society.For these kids at Jesus Camp there is immediate intimacy, emotional support, adult and peer recognition, love, acceptance, joy, fun, and the seeming certainty that the creator of the universe cares about them, that they are special, that their lives have meaning, direction and purpose, that they are loved and matter.  That they are not alone.Its a hell of an attractive brew.  If only you can somehow turn your mind off to the accumulated human wisdom and scientific knowledge of the last thousand years, if only you can accept a literal interpretation of a single ancient book, if only you can accept without question, well, a million endless things...sigh...They are real, they are honest, they are committed, and they receive tremendous value, energy, and personal power in their lives from their beliefs..and they are not to be trusted with our democratic liberties and our blessed constitution.

1035200,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000KLQUV2,Chris Luallen,"[6, 9]","Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady are the directors of this excellent documentary about the ""Kids on Fire"" summer camp in Devil's Lake, North Dakota. Pastor Becky Fischer runs this disturbing place, which is focused on brainwashing children into an extremist right wing version of evangelical Christianity. The kids are encouraged to have emotional displays of their ""love for Jesus"" while being terrified by the fire and brimstone Hell that awaits them if they slip into non-belief. One of the aspects of this camp that is most troubling is that it has a highly militaristic tone which calls for the kids to become ""spiritual warriors"" fighting against the many ""sins"" of secular society such as legal abortion and homosexuality. It also has a highly biased Republican political agenda, with pictures of George W Bush being held up and prayers given that Bush's conservative judicial nominee, Samuel Alito, be approved for the Supreme Court.As someone born, raised and still living in the South, I know that these evangelical nutcases don't consider themselves as being on the lunatic fringe. Instead they think they are part of the ""All-American"" mainstream who are defending Christian traditionalism against the assaults of ""radical"" secularists. They also feel their beliefs are supported by the Founding Fathers, which is, of course, completely false. While it's true that many of the early settlers to New England, the Puritans, were intolerant religious fanatics. The opposite is true when it comes to the Founding Fathers. Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, James Madison and many others were influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment which favored the use of reason and science over superstition. The concept of the separation of Church and State was especially important because the Founding Fathers didn't want the United States to lapse into the sort of Catholic versus Protestant religious violence which had plagued Europe during the previous centuries. It was also intended to protect the free practice of religion from state sponsored tyranny.Overall, ""Jesus Camp"" is a straightforward documentary based on film footage of the summer camp and without significant commentary from the directors. But I did enjoy the inclusion of Air America radio host Mike Papantonio who discusses the many threats posed by evangelical extremists and how their hate filled rhetoric contradicts the actual teachings of Jesus (ie) ""love they neighbor as thyself"". Basically, Papantonio shows that it is possible to be a Christian without being an idiot.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Becky Fischer and her cohorts who wish to turn America into an oppressive theocracy. However, I believe most Americans are proud of our long history of freedom and will never let these religious fanatics take over.",5,Turning Kids Into Religious Fanatics,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2800,"['Heidi', 'Ewing', 'Rachel', 'Grady', 'are', 'directors', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Kids', 'Fire', 'summer', 'camp', 'Devil', 'Lake', 'North', 'Dakota', 'Pastor', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'disturbing', 'place', 'focused', 'brainwashing', 'children', 'extremist', 'right', 'wing', 'version', 'evangelical', 'Christianity', 'kids', 'are', 'encouraged', 'have', 'emotional', 'displays', 'love', 'Jesus', 'being', 'terrified', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'Hell', 'slip', 'non-belief', 'One', 'aspects', 'camp', 'most', 'troubling', 'highly', 'militaristic', 'tone', 'kids', 'become', 'spiritual', 'warriors', 'fighting', 'many', 'sins', 'secular', 'society', 'such', 'legal', 'abortion', 'homosexuality', 'also', 'highly', 'biased', 'Republican', 'political', 'agenda', 'pictures', 'George', 'W', 'Bush', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'prayers', 'given', 'Bush', 'conservative', 'judicial', 'nominee', 'Samuel', 'Alito', 'be', 'approved', 'Supreme', 'Court.As', 'someone', 'born', 'raised', 'still', 'living', 'South', 'know', 'evangelical', 'nutcases', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'being', 'lunatic', 'fringe', 'Instead', 'think', 'are', 'part', 'All-American', 'mainstream', 'who', 'are', 'defending', 'Christian', 'traditionalism', 'assaults', 'radical', 'secularists', 'also', 'feel', 'beliefs', 'are', 'supported', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'course', 'completely', 'false', 'true', 'many', 'early', 'settlers', 'New', 'England', 'Puritans', 'were', 'intolerant', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'opposite', 'true', 'when', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Thomas', 'Paine', 'James', 'Madison', 'many', 'others', 'were', 'influenced', 'ideas', 'Enlightenment', 'favored', 'use', 'reason', 'science', 'superstition', 'concept', 'separation', 'Church', 'State', 'was', 'especially', 'important', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'United', 'States', 'lapse', 'sort', 'Catholic', 'versus', 'Protestant', 'religious', 'violence', 'had', 'plagued', 'Europe', 'previous', 'centuries', 'was', 'also', 'intended', 'protect', 'free', 'practice', 'religion', 'state', 'sponsored', 'tyranny.Overall', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'straightforward', 'documentary', 'based', 'film', 'footage', 'summer', 'camp', 'significant', 'commentary', 'directors', 'did', 'enjoy', 'inclusion', 'Air', 'America', 'radio', 'host', 'Mike', 'Papantonio', 'who', 'many', 'threats', 'posed', 'evangelical', 'extremists', 'how', 'hate', 'filled', 'rhetoric', 'contradicts', 'actual', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'ie', 'neighbor', 'thyself', 'Basically', 'Papantonio', 'possible', 'be', 'Christian', 'being', 'idiot.Unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'cohorts', 'who', 'wish', 'turn', 'America', 'oppressive', 'theocracy', 'However', 'believe', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'proud', 'long', 'history', 'freedom', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'take', 'over']",Jesus Camp

1035204,A1DDZAE5NREK1O,B000KLQUV2,"Cypress Green ""She Who Has a Book in Hand Eve...","[3, 3]","This movie was pretty disturbing.  At first, I stopped it 1/3 of the way thru and didn't plan to write a review.  I was disgusted.I was going to take it back to the library, but then I read more reviews for and against it and decided I really needed to see the whole thing.  I watched most of the deleted scenes and a little of the commentary, too.The only thing I didn't like was that I would have liked to hear the film maker ask questions of the film subjects.  Otherwise, I thought it was finely made.  It's a great education for non-evangelicals into evangelical thought.Questions for people in the film:  when Rachel witnesses to the lady in the bowling alley, what does that lady think of that?  The child who said he had to struggle to believe in Jesus.  The girls crying at the events.Mrs. Fischer has stated elsewhere that there's ""nothing political"" about what they do with the children.  She claims they are not being manipulated.  But in the film, the children smash ceramic coffee cups labeled ""government"" with a hammer to symbolize getting rid of godless government.  The pray for George Bush and chant ""righteous judges"" in support of a more conservative Supreme Judge pick.  They are told by the `abortion guy' that they are responsible for changing things.  They are made to picket in D.C. against abortion because the adults think they will have the most impact.In fact, that's one of my biggest beefs with these people.  They constantly stress, both in and out of the children's presence, that the kids are responsible for changing the world.  I have a teaching degree.  In college, we discussed war, nuclear weapons, the environment etc.  It was stressed that we need to teach kids about how they can make change in the world, but NOT to say or imply that it's THEIR BURDEN.  Who made the war in Iraq?  Who has messed up the Earth?  Adults.  We want to train kids to be responsible without setting the worries on the world on their shoulders.I heard this over and over in the movie.  This is THE generation.  That child will be THE greatest preacher.  YOU KIDS will stop abortion and make the schools godly again if you work hard.There's too much talk and songs about war with or without a religious context.  Mrs. Fischer claims this is not taken literally by the children, and one even states as much in the movie (although he does say a person dying a martyr is the coolest).  Can she really think children this age can think that abstractly?  Do preschoolers (shown) up to teens really get it as a metaphor?  Most don't.  Otherwise we wouldn't have people growing up to fight holy wars and shoot abortion doctors.  These kids are never shown being told HOW to think or reason, just WHAT to think.  I heard no adults having real discussions with the kids.I wish these adults could take a step back and see that kids need to be kids, and let them become religiously and politically active when THEY are ready.  Maybe some have, from seeing this film.

That's not to say they're incapable of giving such issues their interest, nor that their development is likely to be impaired by encountering and thinking about them.  As this film so clearly demonstrates, it's how you teach that makes the difference.Jesus Camp has an obvious point of view that isn't sympathetic to the Evangelicals it portrays.  Perhaps when the filmmakers began this project they didn't have any particular bias towards apocalyptic Biblical literalists.  I don't really know, but I can image how neutrality could be easily subverted after meeting some of the people in this film and observing their lives and their ""teaching"" methods.  It's difficult to feel any sympathy for people of any faith who as a result of ideological motivation see people as things, pawns in a supernatural game, rather than as individuals to be cared for and loved.  It's even more difficult to deal with the enmity that arises on seeing parents and ""teachers"" using intense emotional appeals and peer pressure as methods of ideological indoctrination, creating in the minds of a children a world of ""us"" and ""them,"" the kind of world that doesn't normally exist for children until after puberty.Watch this film and despair the generation of lost children produced by this 21st century generation of know-nothing parents.

1035208,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000KLQUV2,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 8]","As the closing credits roll we hear Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky.""  The lyric goes something like, ""I got a friend in Jesus...He's going to set me up with the spirit in the sky...when I die...I'm going to go to the place that's the best.""A similar point-blank irony suffuses this engaging documentary by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady.  Norman Greenbaum had his tongue firmly in cheek, of course, but Becky Fischer and her fellow molders of children are serious.  She believes in indoctrinating the children and she says so.  She points out that in Muslim lands the children are similarly indoctrinated, and even more so.  It is a war.  The word ""war"" is used repeatedly at Jesus Camp which was located (ironically, I guess) in Devil's Lake, North Dakota.  It's a war that must be won, and implicitly the war is against liberals and mainstream American culture, but explicitly against science, especially biological evolution, and against other faiths.  Becky pretends to apologize before telling us that Christianity has The Truth and therefore should triumph over other religions, creeds and cultures.  She believes that.  There can be no question about the sincerity of her beliefs.What struck me most powerfully is what was REALLY being taught at Jesus Camp.  That is, methods of indoctrination.  Behind all the rhetoric about Jesus and being saved was the political agenda for the fundamentalist movement.  Part Nazi rally, part revival meeting, part Brainwashing 101, what really came across were all the persuasive techniques that Becky Fischer, Ted Haggard and the others had perfected.  Suffer the little children indeed.  Get 'em while they're young, Becky tells us.  The impressions made and beliefs instilled in children before the age of, say eight, will last a lifetime, she tells us.She says she loves America.  We see out of a car window the endless sameness of asphalt roads, telephone poles and electric wires, KFC restaurants and car dealerships that form the main streets of most any American town.  I doubt that she loves the America of the Museum of Modern Art or the America of Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson or the redwoods or the Grand Canyon.  Becky says that she loves America, and then she says she prays to get away from this awful world--or words to that effect.I find it tough to find credence in people who devote their lives to manipulating the emotions of children in an effort to create a new generation of opportunists (or zombies) to mindlessly champion the slogans of their political and social agenda.  How sad it was to see young Levi O'Brien--bright, talented and impressionable beyond his years--being molded into a future TV evangelist.  He will learn the clever deceit practiced not by people like Becky Fischer, who as I said, is a true believer, but more like Ted Haggard himself or any number of moneyed evangelical personalities who preach one thing in public and in their private lives do something else.  He will learn the same techniques that Becky and Ted have learned, techniques of rhetoric and persuasion, of indoctrination and the manipulation of emotions.  He will learn what leads to success in evangelical land, that truth comes from religious authority and political and economic power, and that anyone who thinks differently is an enemy.Becky Fischer thinks liberal America will be worried after seeing this documentary.  Her ability to mold children into her brand of Christianity should scare us, she thinks.  But revivalist America comes and goes with the passing of time.  We've seen it all before.  What is different today is that evangelicals were able to elect somebody like George W. Bush and to control the Congress and cow the media.  I think America has seen where that leads, to the weakening and embarrassment of America; and I am betting that America has learned its lesson and that the politicians who would do the work of the faith-based, ignorance-based, head-in-the-sand, evangelical movement will lose out to more enlightened leadership.  After all, unlike Becky, most of us and our children must live in this world without the fantasy of imminent rapture, and therefore must work toward making the world a better place for all of us.",4,Indoctrinating the kids,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,4228,"['closing', 'credits', 'roll', 'hear', 'Norman', 'Greenbaum', 'Spirit', 'Sky', 'lyric', 'something', 'got', 'friend', 'Jesus', 'going', 'set', 'up', 'spirit', 'sky', 'when', 'die', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'place', 'best', 'similar', 'point-blank', 'irony', 'engaging', 'documentary', 'Heidi', 'Ewing', 'Rachel', 'Grady', 'Norman', 'Greenbaum', 'had', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek', 'course', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'fellow', 'molders', 'children', 'are', 'serious', 'indoctrinating', 'children', 'so', 'out', 'Muslim', 'children', 'are', 'similarly', 'indoctrinated', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'war', 'word', 'war', 'used', 'repeatedly', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'was', 'located', 'ironically', 'guess', 'Devil', 'Lake', 'North', 'Dakota', 'war', 'must', 'be', 'won', 'implicitly', 'war', 'liberals', 'mainstream', 'American', 'culture', 'explicitly', 'science', 'especially', 'biological', 'evolution', 'other', 'faiths', 'Becky', 'apologize', 'telling', 'Christianity', 'Truth', 'therefore', 'should', 'triumph', 'other', 'religions', 'creeds', 'cultures', 'can', 'be', 'question', 'sincerity', 'beliefs.What', 'struck', 'most', 'powerfully', 'what', 'was', 'REALLY', 'being', 'taught', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'methods', 'indoctrination', 'rhetoric', 'Jesus', 'being', 'saved', 'was', 'political', 'agenda', 'fundamentalist', 'movement', 'Part', 'Nazi', 'rally', 'part', 'revival', 'meeting', 'part', 'Brainwashing', '101', 'what', 'really', 'came', 'were', 'persuasive', 'techniques', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'others', 'had', 'perfected', 'Suffer', 'little', 'children', 'indeed', 'Get', ""'re"", 'young', 'Becky', 'impressions', 'made', 'beliefs', 'instilled', 'children', 'age', 'say', 'eight', 'will', 'last', 'lifetime', 'us.She', 'America', 'see', 'car', 'window', 'endless', 'sameness', 'asphalt', 'roads', 'telephone', 'poles', 'electric', 'wires', 'KFC', 'restaurants', 'car', 'dealerships', 'form', 'main', 'streets', 'most', 'American', 'town', 'doubt', 'America', 'Museum', 'Modern', 'Art', 'America', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'redwoods', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Becky', 'America', 'then', 'get', 'away', 'awful', 'world', 'words', 'effect.I', 'find', 'tough', 'find', 'credence', 'people', 'who', 'devote', 'lives', 'manipulating', 'emotions', 'children', 'effort', 'create', 'new', 'generation', 'opportunists', 'zombies', 'mindlessly', 'champion', 'slogans', 'political', 'social', 'agenda', 'How', 'sad', 'was', 'see', 'young', 'Levi', ""O'Brien"", 'bright', 'talented', 'impressionable', 'years', 'being', 'molded', 'future', 'TV', 'evangelist', 'will', 'learn', 'clever', 'deceit', 'practiced', 'not', 'people', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'who', 'said', 'true', 'believer', 'more', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'number', 'moneyed', 'evangelical', 'personalities', 'who', 'preach', 'one', 'thing', 'public', 'private', 'lives', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'will', 'learn', 'same', 'techniques', 'Becky', 'Ted', 'have', 'learned', 'techniques', 'rhetoric', 'persuasion', 'indoctrination', 'manipulation', 'emotions', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'success', 'evangelical', 'land', 'truth', 'religious', 'authority', 'political', 'economic', 'power', 'anyone', 'who', 'differently', 'enemy.Becky', 'Fischer', 'liberal', 'America', 'will', 'be', 'worried', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'ability', 'mold', 'children', 'brand', 'Christianity', 'should', 'scare', 'revivalist', 'America', 'passing', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'What', 'different', 'today', 'evangelicals', 'were', 'able', 'elect', 'somebody', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'control', 'Congress', 'cow', 'media', 'think', 'America', 'seen', 'where', 'weakening', 'embarrassment', 'America', 'am', 'betting', 'America', 'learned', 'lesson', 'politicians', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'work', 'faith-based', 'ignorance-based', 'head-in-the-sand', 'evangelical', 'movement', 'will', 'lose', 'out', 'more', 'enlightened', 'leadership', 'Becky', 'most', 'children', 'must', 'live', 'world', 'fantasy', 'imminent', 'rapture', 'therefore', 'must', 'work', 'making', 'world', 'better', 'place']",Jesus Camp

1035210,A3OXW1R2RMDXBX,B000KLQUV2,"Donna Anastasi ""Spin the Plate""","[3, 3]","When first introduced to the Episcopal church, I was presented with the concept of a four legged stool approach to seeking God and learning about Christianity: scripture-intellect-experience-tradition. No one church that I know of manages to fully embrace all four, but when a church latches on to one (e.g., personal experience) at the expense of the others, as the rather radical Pentecostal-Evangelical church portrayed in this movie did, it can lead to a wobbly stool with sub optimal results.Having spent enough time in and around this style of Christianity, though here in New England not as extreme as in the south or southern CA, not too much of what was portrayed in the film came as a huge surprise. I've been struggling in my mind as to whether, as others have said, that this is a form of child abuse. Certainly not when one compares the treatment of these kids to prosecutable abuse cases. As far a damaging the child's psyche, this falls into that broader category of clumsy parenting wherein a parent's extreme political, religious, ethnic views, beliefs, and behavior are force upon children, denying them the opportunity to explore and develop their own belief system and opinions. My hope is that those raised in such a way who are not suited to this lifestyle are able to break free from it in adolescence and with enough alternate experience, relationships, and counseling to move beyond it, hopefully preserving the good aspects.The GoodThe positives in the film were that the parents, often both, were actively involved with children and parenting, kids were treated as important and often as equals, given a purpose, and integrated God into daily living. The children treated each other kindly, with comradery, there was no bullying, no physical or harsh punishment, and exciting, active, experiential learning (these kids did not seem bored), they were confident speakers, and had simple non materialistic lives. Though many viewers took issue with speaking in tongues, I didn't, though like fasting, it may be more appropriate as a private versus public prayer practice. As for the Bush cutout, the kids were praying for not to him. Many churches pray for our leaders, I know we do every week for their ""wise decisions and right actions."" In this movie a cutout Bush was used as a visual and for the children to ""lay hands"" on him which is part of their prayer tradition.The SadThe sad part was how infrequently these children laughed, played, or freely explored including expressing imagination, creativity, and doubts. In one scene the boys are having fun in the dark cabin with flashlights, creepy noises, and scary stories. An adult quickly puts an end to this with a warning about the dangers of ""ghost"" stories (which these weren't), followed by some preaching, and then making them go to sleep. Also, there was in general a lack of praise, thanksgiving, and joy in the blessings of this life. For example, in a breakfast prayer rather than giving thanks for the food, each other, the bright sunny day, etc. a camp leader prays about ending the murdering of the unborn. Amen, let's eat!The UglyWhile certainly not constrained to this church/religion, the ugly here was the attempt to force the children to believe and think like the parents and camp counselors and strongly tying how well they do so to the love, approval, acceptance, and place in the family and church family. In addition, the children were made to be separate from the outside world using many methods such as home schooling, devaluing of other Christian traditions, and rejection of popular culture. Another ugly aspect shown in the film was laying way too much intense, scary information and responsibility on children that were way too young to handle it. Children that looked as young as five were told ""the devil goes after the young"". Later they are handed (perfectly formed btw) seven week old plastic fetuses and told that millions of these little babies were murdered this year and it would continue unless they stopped it from happening. Finally, while the body of Christ has many members, in this church it appears only the mouth/evangelizing is recognized and of value. That might be fine for kids like Levi who clearly are born speakers. I found it sad bordering on ugly to see kids, like the adorable little blond boy, struggling to fit a mold that they clearly did not.",5,"The good, the sad, and the ugly",1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,4384,"['When', 'first', 'introduced', 'Episcopal', 'church', 'was', 'presented', 'concept', 'four', 'legged', 'stool', 'approach', 'seeking', 'God', 'learning', 'Christianity', 'scripture-intellect-experience-tradition', 'one', 'church', 'know', 'manages', 'fully', 'embrace', 'four', 'when', 'church', 'one', 'e.g.', 'personal', 'experience', 'expense', 'others', 'rather', 'radical', 'Pentecostal-Evangelical', 'church', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'did', 'can', 'lead', 'wobbly', 'stool', 'sub', 'optimal', 'results.Having', 'spent', 'enough', 'time', 'style', 'Christianity', 'though', 'here', 'New', 'England', 'not', 'as', 'extreme', 'south', 'southern', 'CA', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'came', 'huge', 'surprise', ""'ve"", 'been', 'struggling', 'mind', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'form', 'child', 'abuse', 'Certainly', 'not', 'when', 'one', 'treatment', 'kids', 'prosecutable', 'abuse', 'cases', 'far', 'damaging', 'child', 'psyche', 'broader', 'category', 'clumsy', 'parenting', 'wherein', 'parent', 'extreme', 'political', 'religious', 'ethnic', 'views', 'beliefs', 'behavior', 'are', 'force', 'children', 'denying', 'opportunity', 'explore', 'develop', 'own', 'belief', 'system', 'opinions', 'hope', 'raised', 'such', 'way', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'suited', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'able', 'break', 'free', 'adolescence', 'enough', 'alternate', 'experience', 'relationships', 'counseling', 'move', 'hopefully', 'preserving', 'good', 'aspects.The', 'GoodThe', 'positives', 'film', 'were', 'parents', 'often', 'were', 'actively', 'involved', 'children', 'parenting', 'kids', 'were', 'treated', 'important', 'often', 'equals', 'given', 'purpose', 'integrated', 'God', 'daily', 'living', 'children', 'treated', 'other', 'kindly', 'comradery', 'was', 'bullying', 'physical', 'harsh', 'punishment', 'exciting', 'active', 'experiential', 'learning', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'bored', 'were', 'confident', 'speakers', 'had', 'simple', 'non', 'materialistic', 'lives', 'many', 'viewers', 'took', 'issue', 'speaking', 'tongues', 'did', ""n't"", 'fasting', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'private', 'versus', 'public', 'prayer', 'practice', 'Bush', 'cutout', 'kids', 'were', 'praying', 'not', 'Many', 'churches', 'pray', 'leaders', 'know', 'do', 'week', 'wise', 'decisions', 'right', 'actions', 'movie', 'cutout', 'Bush', 'was', 'used', 'visual', 'children', 'lay', 'hands', 'part', 'prayer', 'SadThe', 'sad', 'part', 'was', 'how', 'infrequently', 'children', 'laughed', 'played', 'freely', 'explored', 'including', 'expressing', 'imagination', 'creativity', 'doubts', 'one', 'scene', 'boys', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'dark', 'cabin', 'flashlights', 'creepy', 'noises', 'scary', 'stories', 'adult', 'quickly', 'end', 'warning', 'dangers', 'ghost', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'followed', 'preaching', 'then', 'making', 'go', 'sleep', 'Also', 'was', 'general', 'lack', 'praise', 'thanksgiving', 'joy', 'blessings', 'life', 'example', 'breakfast', 'prayer', 'rather', 'giving', 'thanks', 'food', 'other', 'bright', 'sunny', 'day', 'etc', 'camp', 'leader', 'prays', 'ending', 'murdering', 'unborn', 'Amen', 'let', 'eat', 'UglyWhile', 'certainly', 'not', 'constrained', 'church/religion', 'ugly', 'here', 'was', 'attempt', 'force', 'children', 'believe', 'think', 'parents', 'camp', 'counselors', 'strongly', 'tying', 'how', 'well', 'do', 'so', 'love', 'approval', 'acceptance', 'place', 'family', 'church', 'family', 'addition', 'children', 'were', 'made', 'be', 'separate', 'outside', 'world', 'using', 'many', 'methods', 'such', 'home', 'schooling', 'devaluing', 'other', 'Christian', 'traditions', 'rejection', 'popular', 'culture', 'ugly', 'aspect', 'shown', 'film', 'was', 'laying', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'intense', 'scary', 'information', 'responsibility', 'children', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'handle', 'Children', 'looked', 'as', 'young', 'five', 'were', 'told', 'devil', 'young', 'Later', 'are', 'handed', 'perfectly', 'formed', 'btw', 'seven', 'week', 'old', 'plastic', 'fetuses', 'told', 'millions', 'little', 'babies', 'were', 'murdered', 'year', 'would', 'continue', 'stopped', 'happening', 'Finally', 'body', 'Christ', 'many', 'members', 'church', 'only', 'mouth/evangelizing', 'recognized', 'value', 'might', 'be', 'fine', 'kids', 'Levi', 'who', 'clearly', 'are', 'born', 'speakers', 'found', 'sad', 'bordering', 'ugly', 'see', 'kids', 'adorable', 'little', 'blond', 'boy', 'struggling', 'fit', 'mold', 'clearly', 'did', 'not']",Jesus Camp

The terminology in the film, as well as parts of the activities of the children utilize militarized language.  Children constantly refer to themselves as ""warriors"", ""soldiers"", and so on.  One father, on his way to Iraq, plainly states he considers himself a soldier for Christ, and his deployment as an opportunity to introduce the Iraqis, and one assumes, fellow soldiers, to his version of Christianity.  Several comments in the reviews and comments attached thereto argue that all this talk of war is meant to be strictly spiritual, never actual, physical war-like conflict.  This denial is terribly wrong, and terribly dangerous for the nation, and for national security.  In fact, there has been a well-publicized problem of increasing concern with the slow, but effective creeping cancer of the religious right into every level of government and the Department of Defense.  The service academies, particularly the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, but the others as well, have been infiltrated by evangelicals who have to a great extent spread their baleful influence into the curriculum and culture of the academies, as well as the rest of the military.  Leaders in the highest levels of the military have refused repeated orders to clean up their act and remove religious imprints from their commands.  Cadets are subjected to constant brainwashing, and evangelicals have actually insinuated themselves into the very fabric of the institutions themselves.  In the war zones some commanders have encouraged and enabled soldiers to carry bibles and religious tracts out into the field, and permitted outright proselytizing by soldiers, further enraging the Muslim population of the countries we have invaded.The film further shows instances of racial bigotry and religious hatred being instilled in the children.  One scene shows a little girl accosting a group of older African American men, attempting to question their religious beliefs.  After being rebuffed, she tells a little boy with her she thinks ""They must be Muslims.""  Why? Because they were men of color?  The woman running the program feeds the children some pretty wild-eyed, baseless fear-mongering about the alleged monstrosities taught children under Islam.  Hardly the stuff from which world peace is made.

1035212,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000KLQUV2,Dr. E,"[20, 23]","Here is what I found amazing: this film could have been told on an obscene slant... directors Ewing and Grady could have edited the film to make the featured Zionists appear ""crazy."" In fact, I was expecting a Morgan Spurlock  extreme-approach (in a good way!) Instead, these directors removed the ""spin"" and allowed the fundamentalist, evangelical participants to showcase their considerable ignorance of The Bible (and religion in general). (Seriously, did you get the impression that they have no idea what the ""Judeo"" in ""Judeo-Christian"" means?!)As a person raised with no religious affiliation, I have always been fascinated with theology . . . especially in an historical context. Generally uneducated, those who subscribe to the Pentecostal branch of Christianity seem to either ""conveniently"" forget OR genuinely do not understand that glossolalia (or speaking ""speaking in tongues"") does NOT mean constructing an impromptu language, but refers to the ""miracle"" of when ""tongues of fire"" allowed the Apostles to speak in their native language BUT BE HEARD in a variety of languages . . . so that they could communicate with the diverse crowd. Underscore: ACTUAL LANGUAGES THAT ARE KNOWN AND SPOKEN BY A POPULATION:) (see Acts). It is often interpreted as a Christian reversal of the Tower of Babel story. And that the Pentecostal church insists on this gross misinterpretation underscores their inherent xenophobia. So, if you ever wondered why you were uncomfortable when watching their COMPLETELY CONSTRUCTED ""babble"" (read: ""Babel""), it is not mere embarrassment for them, but horror at such a vulgar reading of a sacred text.While one's instinct is to scoff at the ridiculousness of these delusional plebs (who score about a fifty on the Binet Scale), one must not be so hasty. The film depicts, in painful detail, how they infect their children with ignorance (who knew they had their own propaganda videos?!) Denying them the right to learn both science and art. (But did anyone else notice that Levi's mother was reading Lord of the Rings?!! And we all know, according to Becky, that this type of ""deviltry"" is not permitted in any ""good Christian"" home). Any comedic value is instantly negated as the viewer beholds a child doomed to a dark existence. My question is, how are these parents not held to an educational standard by the state? (I do NOT think the children should BE FORCED to learn evolution . . .

1035215,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000KLQUV2,E. Anderson,"[22, 30]","I had the most fortunate experience of being able to view ""Jesus Camp"" when it was in the movie theatres. ""Jesus Camp"" is the documentary that focuses on a pastor named Becky Fischer. She runs a summer camp called Kids on Fire in Devil's Lake, North Dakota. Her goal is to get her young audience to help shape the political culture by dragging religion into the political arena, destroying the whole concept of the separation of church and state. Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady follows Becky and a few of her youthful members around Devil's Lake and outside of the camp but they never appear on camera. There are no snarky editorials like there are in Michael Moore's films. Heidi and Rachel lets Becky and the kids do all the talking, making for a riveting film.From an atheist's point of view, I found this film absolutely terrifying because people like Becky Fischer are trying to shove religion down the throats of non-Christians and non-believers alike. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate Christianity itself per say. I was raised a Christian. It is some of its followers like Becky Fischer that terrifies me because they want to turn this country into a theocratic society. I do think everyone should have the freedom of religion, I just don't think this country needs to be known as solely as a Christian state given that not everyone is a Christian (like myself). Personally I think what the adults in Becky's church were doing to the children were brainwashing. They were hammering away what they (the adults) think is right and wrong. The children are not allowed to think for themselves or to question authority figures like Becky Fischer, at least from my point of view as someone who is not of any faith.The children in this film were riveting to watch to say the very least. I can easily see Levi becoming the next Pat Robertson of his generation. He has all the charisma to become a televangelist. Rachael is a young girl who dreams of becoming a manicurist so while she is doing people's nails, she can convert them to Christianity. She even tries to 'save' a friend of her's in the film who was obviously just playing along with her for Rachael's sake. Tory is the other kid that the filmmakers follow through out the film. She loves to dance and will only listen to music with Christian lyrics. Then there is the cameo appearance by the now defrocked Ted Haggard who obviously lives by the adage ""do as I say not as I do"".The more conservative evangelical Christians like Becky may think otherwise about this film judging by the way the film was edited but I wouldn't know from experience. I personally thought the film is pretty unbias towards Becky and her church. On the other hand, there might be some Christians who might think otherwise because of the way the film is edited. but keep in mind that Becky Fischer herself approved this film. For non-Christians/non-believers like myself ""Jesus Camp"" is an example of some of the ugliness that is being said in the Lord's name. All the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween movies combined don't have all the scare factor ""Jesus Camp"" possesses.

1035217,AQIRBENYADT43,B000KLQUV2,Eddy,"[9, 10]","Never before in the history of my reviewing has the word terrifying seemed so pathetically inadequate. 'Jesus Camp' is a revealing documentary about a bible camp that, had it taken place in a third world muslim country, would be referred to by the mainstream press as disgraceful, militant propoganda.What one is confronted with throughout, is the sight of very young children, professing to have emotions and beliefs that they clearly could not yet understand and have obviously been transplanted onto them by adults who should know better. The sight of a young child saying that at the age of 5 he wanted more from life and was saved by the word of Jesus is a surreal one to say the least.Much of what goes on in this ""Jesus Camp"" is patently psychologically damaging to the children involved and requires nothing short of government intervention (although I am fully aware of how unlikely that is). I personally believe that religious decisions are not ones that should be made for someone while they are still a minor and should be left up to the person themselves once they reach the age of reason. I also would tend to agree with the idea that there is no such thing as a christian child or a muslim child, simply a child of christian or muslim parents.It must be said that most christians are nothing like those depicted in this documentary.

They really admire their subject, Becky Fisher like one would admire Ghandi or Martin Luther King.  You hear words like ""she is so smart and passionate and so charismatic.""  I think some people believed the same think about Hitler and George Bush.  Then Heidi and Rachel(filmakers) still gushing would share their observation of Becky Fisher, the child sinister, mmm excuse me, minister who looks like a big fan of ""The L Word,"" how she has so much influence on these kids and how these kids hang on to every word she says. Ladies, did you two noticed the parents with their heavy hands over their children's shoulders while Minister Becky rages on?  Well the point is she gets a lot of help from home, the same speil that is coming out of her mouth is the same Bandini that's being taught at  home.  So it isn't much of a strectch  for her.  You can laugh and dismiss these kids and the adults behind them but maybe it won't such a joke, because as Becky puts it ""others kids in Palestine are being taught to shot and strap bombs around their bodies"" for Becky I guess its a good thing and she is following suit.  It would have been okay if they just keep it to themselve but what they are teaching these kids is if the person next to you doesn't believe in the same cow poop that you beleive in, then God and Jesus grant you the right to kill that person.  You think this is extreme? No, because the little tykes call for war and they believe they are soldiers of Jesus and God.  The camp even has chant song about going to war.  When you look at recent human history, it seems to follow a pattern of abusing children, (The Industrial Revolution, boy soldiers in the Sudan, rugmakers in India/Pakistan} and The Evangilicals are no different.  The funniest thing about this doc is the appearance of Ted Haggard, we all know what happened to him, but I could've told you that he is a closeted Homosexual, he said ""Fabulous"" about five times with such aplomb, that's a dead giveaway.

1035219,A9WXHV15BK7W,B000KLQUV2,Emil Sinclair,"[12, 18]","Jesus Camp chronicles the experiences of several children and their interactions with the cancer that is evangelical Christianity. The viewer sees how these children are indoctrinated into accepting the religious and political attitudes of the Christian right. For instance, the children are taught to believe that abortion is evil and that global warming is simply made up. Such examples are indicative of what Erich Fromm calls authoritarian ethics, which is characterized by the individual's weakness and dependence on an irrational authority (in this case, the Church and its respective agents), whose power, because it supposedly transcends man, cannot be criticized.As you watch the documentary, you realize that no critical discussion of religion or politics takes place. These children do no investigate the darker passages of the Bible that condone rape, kidnapping, murder, and genocide (see Judges 21:10-24, Deuteronomy 22:28-29, and 1 Samuel 15:2-3, for instance) and thus do not understand that the Bible is not the literal word of God but rather that of His fallible disciples. The narrow focus on social issues such as abortion acts as a smoke screen -- evangelical Christianity has few answers for society's pressing problems like creating more middle-class jobs and providing more families with healthcare. Put simply, it is much easier to denounce pornography, abortion, homosexuality, etc. than it is to formulate a cogent plan to, say, save Social Security and Medicare.At times, the editorializing of Mike Papantonio's radio show seems unnecessary because the documentary's points are well established. It would have been more interesting to conduct a deeper investigation into the lives of the children (Levi, Rachael, and Tory) to see if they change their viewpoints as they mature into adults.

1035220,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,B000KLQUV2,Endless Kitchen,"[5, 5]","In the scenic and peaceful countryside of North Dakota is a special kind of summer camp called ""Kids on Fire School of Ministry."" Not surprisingly, this is a religious-based summer camp but the leader of the camp, Becky Fischer, is rabid in the Evangelical Christianity that she pushes to the children who attend camp. This is not mainstream Christianity or the friendly Sunday schools many Americans know of or once attended or send their children to attend.  Her rabid push is an attempt to mimic ""the Islamic enemy"" overseas (Fischer and many of her fellow activists are disturbingly Islamophobic and hateful). That is not conjecture; she actually says, ""It's no wonder, with that kind of intense training and disciplining, that those young people are ready to kill themselves for the cause of Islam. I wanna see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam. I wanna see them as radically laying down their lives for the Gospel as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine and all those different places, you know, because we have... excuse me, but we have the truth!"" Stats on the screen tell that nearly half of all Evangelicals were born again before the age of thirteen. Her goal is to capture children into her style of Christianity. ""I can go into a playground of kids that don't know anything about Christianity, lead them to the Lord in a matter of, just no time at all, and just moments later they can be seeing visions and hearing the voice of God, because they're so open. They are so usable in Christianity."" The filmmakers focus on three children: Levi, Tory and Rachel. Levi is homeschooled but has a certain precocious quality and a charisma that lends to his dream of being a preacher. Tory is the daughter of a soldier overseas; she love Christian heavy metal and dancing. Rachel is a smart young girl who really likes the idea of proselytizing and has contempt for Christians who lack enthusiasm. The film weaves in occasional cuts of right-wing radio echoing this Jesus Camp-style reactionary politics but also  Mike Papantonio, who provides a liberal Christian or social gospel voice. The film concludes with an on-the-air discussion between Becky Fischer and Mike Papantonio.Wow, this film is raw, frank and eye-opening. I have read much about religion, politics and the rise of religious influence of politics in the United States of America, but seeing it recorded in living color is something else. This documentary is telling, engaging and outrageous. The most startling part of the film are actually the little details. For example, not that ""Jesus Camp"" features preacher Ted Haggard who affirms on stage the idea of putting men to death for having consensual sexual contact with other men while he was actually having drugs with his male partner and would later, briefly, admit to being bisexual. It is that Haggard advised then-President George W. Bush weekly despite lacking any experience or erudition to provide counsel to the head of state of a superpower. Other little details the creationist textbooks and children shows Levi reads and watches with his mother who home-schools him. His mother actually says, ""Did you get to the part yet where they say that science hasn't proven anything?"" These transparent quackeries and anti-intellectual diatribes are an attempt to make what one wishes or believes to be true more important than the actual truth. Recently, these types of propaganda are making a national comeback thanks to Texas being the center of American textbooks and now we have history textbooks that cut Thomas Jefferson and insert Phyllis Schlafly. Levi's mother posts a photograph of George W. Bush on the refrigerator where most parents post art, report cards or photographs of their children.What is very sad and downright abuse are the experiences of the actual children who are at the camp. One boy seems very uncomfortable with the extremism around him, and perhaps religion and God in general, as he cries in a bizarre confessional circle. This child had a lot of moral and physical courage to confess that he really doubts God and I hope he is well today. Levi seems fairly sharp but is given improper and inadequate schooling. Rachel is bright and very nice but also very judgmental, self-righteous and prejudice against other denominations of Christianity. Tory is made to feel ashamed by her desire and fondness for dancing. Shame on these adults for this treatment of children.The film's finale Concerned over raising children-soldiers for the Republican Party and this cult-like indoctrination as well as a move to legislate this Americanized nationalist  form of Christianity, Mike Papantonio asks what this means for democracy in the United States. Fischer denies being partisan but takes a flippant view on dominionism and christendom consuming democracy. Her response is shocking ""You know, I think democracy is the greatest political system on Earth, it's the only it's on the  Earth, you know and it is designed to destroy itself, because we have to give everyone the equal freedom and it will destroy us. And so perfect world it is not going to be perfect until Jesus is truly Lord."" How frightening that this propagandist towards children is openly stating that allowing equality to non-Christians, more specifically non-Evangelicals, is wrong and destructive? This film is plain and clear in its portrayal. The final debate between Fischer and Papantonio provides the only tension in this raw documentary. It is honest, straight-forward, unbiased and fair. This movement is really a disturbing, scary, authoritarian, anti-democratic and twisted form of Christianity (perhaps one might call it pseudo-Christianity, Rick Warren Christianity or heresy). Stay tuned during the ending credits for an amusing and epitomizing moment of these attempts to proselytize children and then have them proselytize during their childhood.This film is disturbing and upsetting but it is important and eye-opening for people across the world to know what is happening in many American communities for the past few decades.

Selvia ""Liz""","[1, 2]","For those of you actually attempting to get information about this film but find themselves blockaded by frothing, indignant, fundamentalist, nubags  who spew incoherent rage at the mere existence of this film, I sympathize. And I also would like to give a less one-sided, and hopefully understandable, summary of this film. Right.First off, this is essentially a documentary which depicts a few days in the lives of children attending a conservative Christian church which, like most of them, has arranged a sort of 'Summer Bible School' and follows what goes on during this event. It paints a fairly honest portrait being that the documenters themselves never speak but rather, allow most of those filmed to speak for themselves about any subject they wish. Throughout, we are given a kind of ""fly-on-the wall"" glimpse of the lives and inner worlds of both the children as well as the Church organizers who helped to create this event. There are snippets also, wherein we get to observe portions of a radio show being hosted by a less conservative Christian and hear his own personal viewpoints on this event as well as the staff conducting it.While much of the imagery is disturbing, it is sadly genuine being that none of the comments are prompted or solicited in any way. Essentially, this is a documentary almost, entirely produced by those depicted in it themselves being that, their voices are often the only ones we hear. Indeed, they give us their honest viewpoints and/or personal biases, all throughout the entirety.Additionally, I would like to add the suggestion, crass as it may seem, placed herein, that those using this forum as a personal venting ground to try to ""clear their name"" or defend their stance as conservative Christians or however else they choose to be identified, should have their comments removed from this board. This is not the place for such things.This said, in my own humble opinion, I believe this documentary to be an insightful and interesting look at the current cultural trends which have become so pervasive in this country. Anyone interested in American History or Sociology should be pointed in the direction of this film.Thank you, very much.",5,"A Clear and Concise Review of ""Jesus Camp""",1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,2191,"['actually', 'attempting', 'get', 'information', 'film', 'find', 'blockaded', 'frothing', 'indignant', 'fundamentalist', 'nubags', 'who', 'spew', 'incoherent', 'rage', 'mere', 'existence', 'film', 'sympathize', 'also', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'less', 'one-sided', 'hopefully', 'understandable', 'summary', 'film', 'Right.First', 'off', 'essentially', 'documentary', 'few', 'days', 'lives', 'children', 'attending', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'church', 'most', 'arranged', 'sort', ""'Summer"", 'Bible', 'School', 'what', 'event', 'fairly', 'honest', 'portrait', 'being', 'documenters', 'never', 'speak', 'rather', 'allow', 'most', 'filmed', 'speak', 'subject', 'wish', 'Throughout', 'are', 'given', 'kind', 'fly-on-the', 'wall', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'inner', 'worlds', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'Church', 'organizers', 'who', 'helped', 'create', 'event', 'are', 'snippets', 'also', 'get', 'observe', 'portions', 'radio', 'show', 'being', 'hosted', 'less', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'hear', 'own', 'personal', 'viewpoints', 'event', 'as', 'well', 'staff', 'conducting', 'it.While', 'much', 'imagery', 'disturbing', 'sadly', 'genuine', 'being', 'none', 'comments', 'are', 'prompted', 'solicited', 'way', 'Essentially', 'documentary', 'almost', 'entirely', 'produced', 'depicted', 'being', 'voices', 'are', 'often', 'only', 'ones', 'hear', 'Indeed', 'give', 'honest', 'viewpoints', 'and/or', 'personal', 'biases', 'entirety.Additionally', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'suggestion', 'crass', 'may', 'seem', 'placed', 'herein', 'using', 'forum', 'personal', 'venting', 'ground', 'try', 'clear', 'name', 'defend', 'stance', 'conservative', 'Christians', 'however', 'else', 'choose', 'be', 'identified', 'should', 'have', 'comments', 'removed', 'board', 'not', 'place', 'such', 'things.This', 'said', 'own', 'humble', 'opinion', 'believe', 'documentary', 'be', 'insightful', 'interesting', 'look', 'current', 'cultural', 'trends', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'pervasive', 'country', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'American', 'History', 'Sociology', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'direction', 'film.Thank', 'very', 'much']",Jesus Camp

Here are a few things I think others might enjoy:See little kids speak in tongues and convulse on the floor. Watch as Jesus washes the sins off little kids' hands with Nestle bottled water! See ""fat & lazy"" (her own words) pastor Becky confuse a Lion with a Tiger! See a child use a dollar bill as a bookmark for his bible. See parents squeeze any sense of imagination or personality out of their own kids. See a Power Point presentation annointed by the words of JC himself through Becky's speaking in tongues. Listen to the horrid sounds of christian rock and rap music. Watch pastor Becky inflate a condom with her own hot air! Be awed as a British dude talks to a 49 cent coffee mug! See an old lady and a group of kids talk to a life-size cardboard cut-out of President Jesus Bush! You will be mesmerized as you witness a chain-smoking ex-convict talk about overthrowing abortion as he duct tapes little kids' mouths shut so they can't scream in terror! Watch a gay meth-head preacher talk about how it's a sin to be gay and do drugs! WOW, christians really LOVE jesus' blood! See pastor Becky smile with delight as she feels her car being baptized by JC himself inside the local carwash. You'll see lots of brain-washing techniques you can try out on your own kids like speaking with rhythm and rhyme, repetitive body movements, humming, threats and just plain old lying!I highly recommend this film, I wish, however, that they would have also included interviews with older kids who had been raised this way for years.

It actually took about 2 months from the day his first mentioned it to the day I watched it. I took so long in getting to it because I just didn't want to watch anything to do with the Christian Church ever again. I used to be a Christian (or, at least I thought I was) until I began to realize I didn't belong there. It was a sham, my being there, and it was done only to appease my wife and my parents.I also went to church because of my children. I was raised to believe that good parents took thier children to church and the Christian Doctrine was taught in the home. I'm 53 years old, and that is the way it was taught in my youth. Well, when my wife and I divorced I also divorced the church. My children are grown, she's remarried, and I'm a happy man.I no longer wanted to hear about the church, and was reluctant to watch this film. I found myself impressed by the three children presented in the film. They seem intelligent, very outgoing, and likeable. The adults leading them, however, seem pushy, overbearing, and downright creepy.What made a disturbing impression on me was the scene in which one of these ""leaders"" made the children cry, and flail about on the floor in seizure-like fits. Imagine bringing a bunch of young children to this camp, and then making them feel guilty about themselves to the point where they cry and ""repent"" of imagined sins?! Shame on these so-called ""leaders"" and their tactics! The entire thing was repulsive and extremely ugly. Seeing Jesus Camp only made me stronger in my belief that divorcing the church was the right way to go. I don't want anything to do with any religion that makes people feel worthless and guilty. Children should be allowed to be children, and not mindless ""god zombies"". The church is based on fear and guilt, not to mention money.

1035224,AY12DBB0U420B,B000KLQUV2,Gary Peterson,"[12, 12]","Here's an interesting and well-done documentary film. It involves the evangelical Christian movement and focuses on a summer religion-based camp for children and the adults associated with it. The movie is called ""Jesus Camp.""The film is very well done in that directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady maintain a somewhat distant neutrality toword their subject. They report, and report well, but don't judge. Judgement is left to the viewer and might vary quite considerably. What are your own religeous beliefs? Are you an evangelical Christian? Maybe you'll think the film is terrific. Are you an agnostic or of another religion? Maybe you'll be appalled or find it deeply disturbing. Personally, I ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the children as they underwent their indoctrination and imitated their teachers and tried so hard to please the adults. I underwent a bit of this myself and it took a long time to finally break away. I found most of the adults in the film to be appalling. To me, the entire evangelical movement is interesting, but disturbing. That's how I'd rate the movie: interesting and disturbing. It's worthy of it's Academy Award nomination.It's a fascinating and sometimes alarming study. My keen attention was held throughout the entire viewing. It was both interesting and appalling at the same time. The film even includes Ted Haggard, the disgraced president of the National Association of Evangelicals.

Pouliot,"[7, 8]","While much of ""Jesus Camp"" is set in a North Dakota camp for evangelical kids, the film also depicts the family background of those who would send their kids to such a place. Much of the film focuses on Levi and Racael, two home-schooled kids who have imbibed deeply of their parents' piety and politics. While these kids are hardly robotic or brainwashed, their unkidlike commitment to their religious principles is sometimes scary to watch. Not surprisingly, these kids are insulated from the real world. Rachael prays over her bowling ball before rolling it, then wanders the alley distributing religious tracts to other bowlers. The mulleted Levi and his family recite their pledge to the ""Christian flag"" and to the Bible before their lessons begin.The camp itself is run by Backy Fischer, at the ironically-named Devil's Lake, North Dakota. Camp is a combination religious revival and political indoctrination. The kids tearfully (and seemingly quite spontaneously) confess their shortcomings, their already-unbearable load of youthful guilt prompting them to uncontrolled weeping. They sing enthusiastic songs about Jesus, support Geroge W. Bush and pray to end abortion. Back home, they visit pre-scandal Ted Haggard's church in Colorado Springs. Levi, especially, clearly hero-worships Haggard, and can be seen pacing the sanctuary, imagining himself as a world-class evangelist. The film follows the kids to a small Washington DC anti-abortion rally where they stand in protest before the Supreme Court building with ""Life"" stickers closing their mouths. Afterwards, they encounter the real world -- which is neither as fascinated by them or as impious as they believe.I had expected to be appalled by the behavior of the parents, but wound up terrified by and concerned for the kids, who are being raised to be narrow-minded, ignorant and self-righteous. Racheal's insistence that God does not listen to the prayers of those whose worship style is sedate has the makings, under the right circumstances, of religious persecution. The film is bracketed by scenes of the bleak midwestern lanscape punctuated by radio snippets about the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito, a darling of the religious right. Air America's Mike Papantonio appears occasionally while taping his radio show and serves as a counterpoint from the left. His comments are heartfelt, but ineffective, a sad commentary on the left's until-now inability to counter the simplistic notions, unwillingness to engage science and narrow view of the true believers.""Jesus Camp"" is fascinating and frightening, a glimpse inside the world of the kind of Americans who reflexively support anything marketed as Christian, including the war in Iraq and the far-right agenda of the Bush II administration. I don't believe that we should fear people like those shown in the film, as they must someday engage the real world and perhaps moderate their more extreme views. But the film does a wonderful job at acquainting us with people whose world view and aspirations are at odds with science, reason and the notions of a secular form of representative government.",5,Creepy but not terrifying,1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,3143,"['much', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'set', 'North', 'Dakota', 'camp', 'evangelical', 'kids', 'film', 'also', 'family', 'background', 'who', 'would', 'send', 'kids', 'such', 'place', 'Much', 'film', 'Levi', 'Racael', 'two', 'home-schooled', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'imbibed', 'deeply', 'parents', 'piety', 'politics', 'kids', 'are', 'hardly', 'robotic', 'brainwashed', 'unkidlike', 'commitment', 'religious', 'principles', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'watch', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'kids', 'are', 'insulated', 'real', 'world', 'Rachael', 'bowling', 'ball', 'rolling', 'then', 'alley', 'distributing', 'religious', 'tracts', 'other', 'bowlers', 'mulleted', 'Levi', 'family', 'recite', 'pledge', 'Christian', 'flag', 'Bible', 'lessons', 'begin.The', 'camp', 'run', 'Backy', 'Fischer', 'ironically-named', 'Devil', 'Lake', 'North', 'Dakota', 'Camp', 'combination', 'religious', 'revival', 'political', 'indoctrination', 'kids', 'tearfully', 'seemingly', 'quite', 'spontaneously', 'confess', 'shortcomings', 'already-unbearable', 'load', 'youthful', 'guilt', 'prompting', 'uncontrolled', 'weeping', 'sing', 'enthusiastic', 'songs', 'Jesus', 'support', 'Geroge', 'W.', 'Bush', 'pray', 'end', 'abortion', 'Back', 'home', 'visit', 'pre-scandal', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'church', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'Levi', 'especially', 'clearly', 'hero-worships', 'Haggard', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'pacing', 'sanctuary', 'imagining', 'world-class', 'evangelist', 'film', 'kids', 'small', 'Washington', 'DC', 'anti-abortion', 'rally', 'where', 'stand', 'protest', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'building', 'Life', 'stickers', 'closing', 'mouths', 'Afterwards', 'encounter', 'real', 'world', 'fascinated', 'as', 'impious', 'believe.I', 'had', 'expected', 'be', 'appalled', 'behavior', 'parents', 'wound', 'up', 'terrified', 'concerned', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'raised', 'be', 'narrow-minded', 'ignorant', 'self-righteous', 'Racheal', 'insistence', 'God', 'not', 'listen', 'prayers', 'worship', 'style', 'sedate', 'makings', 'right', 'circumstances', 'religious', 'persecution', 'film', 'bracketed', 'scenes', 'bleak', 'midwestern', 'lanscape', 'punctuated', 'radio', 'snippets', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'confirmation', 'Judge', 'Samuel', 'Alito', 'darling', 'religious', 'right', 'Air', 'America', 'Mike', 'Papantonio', 'occasionally', 'taping', 'radio', 'show', 'counterpoint', 'left', 'comments', 'are', 'heartfelt', 'ineffective', 'sad', 'commentary', 'left', 'until-now', 'inability', 'counter', 'simplistic', 'notions', 'unwillingness', 'engage', 'science', 'narrow', 'view', 'true', 'believers', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'fascinating', 'frightening', 'glimpse', 'world', 'kind', 'Americans', 'who', 'reflexively', 'support', 'anything', 'marketed', 'Christian', 'including', 'war', 'Iraq', 'far-right', 'agenda', 'Bush', 'II', 'administration', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'should', 'fear', 'people', 'shown', 'film', 'must', 'someday', 'engage', 'real', 'world', 'perhaps', 'moderate', 'more', 'extreme', 'views', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'acquainting', 'people', 'world', 'view', 'aspirations', 'are', 'odds', 'science', 'reason', 'notions', 'secular', 'form', 'representative', 'government']",Jesus Camp

1035234,A3SIJ2IXS7EGS2,B000KLQUV2,Jerome Y. Hebert,"[15, 19]","In my opinion, ""Jesus Camp"" exposes the Evangelical obsession with brainwashing impressionable children even more effectively than ""One Nation Under God"" lays bare some of the insanities inherent in the equally obsessional Evangelical ""ex-gay"" movement.  To a greater degree than ONUG, ""Jesus Camp"" allows the Evangelical worldview to speak for itself.  And what it speaks, in its own words and actions, is both self-damning and infinitely saddening.Although there are no ""stars"" in any conventional sense, the documentary continually comes back to three pre-pubescent attendees of Jesus Camp in particular as its story develops: an in-your-face young girl who is frequently ""moved by the Spirit"" to convert people on the street, or ladies in a bowling alley; a young fellow with an over-developed slave-lock who seems to think himself destined by God to become the next Elijah, Isaiah or Jeremiah (or, perhaps, Ted Haggard whom he has the [mixed] blessing of meeting in person); and a truly engaging little blond boy, not more than eight or nine years old, who confesses to sometimes having doubts about God or the ""Holy"" Scriptures - and feels the guilt of this healthy reaction to nonsense with an intensity that brought tears to his eyes ... and to mine as well.  Like W.C. Fields, children aren't something I'd want to keep around the house, but the psychological, emotional and spiritual abuse that is showered on these children made me wish that some compassionate Peter Pan would swoop down in the night and snatch them away to a rational Neverland where they could complete the job (and experience the joy) of being children rather than being used as obedient living tools to reinforce the political views and things-that-go-bump-in-the-night fears of the ""born-again"" adults who are so brazenly manipulating, brainwashing and exploiting them during their most formative and impressionable years.It becomes easy to understand how an absolutist religious viewpoint and practice could have brought the Western World the 1000-year wonder that we now call the Dark Ages.  Anti-science, anti-rationalism, anti-doubt, and ultimately anti-human guilt, fear and superstition are the ""gifts"" bestowed by this particular ""Spirit.""  ""Jesus Camp"" makes this and more abundantly clear, through the simple and effective means of allowing the ""believers"" to speak and act for themselves.  As the adult ""actors"" display their own personal degrees of mental and emotional instability, self-loathing and doubt compensated for by limitless ""spiritual"" hubris, and often with a mind-blowing display of blatant and transparent (to all save themselves) internal inconsistency, the ""Evangelical"" world is seen for what it is.  Worse, a side of it is shown that few of us have seen or even think about:  the exploitation of children to ensure that they ""share in the blessing"" of ignorance, arrogance and a life of assertive and intrusive self-delusion that would drag everyone else down to its own level of incompetence at, impotence with, and fear of reality and Real World.  At one moment, an unhealthily hefty female preacher - if a Christian's body is the ""temple of the Holy Spirit,"" this lady may well be his version of the entire Angkor Wat complex - is saying that if Harry Potter had lived in ""Old Testament Times,"" he would have been put to death; shortly thereafter, the whole ensemble is performing a ritual of sympathetic magic by smashing crockery which supposedly represents the ""godless"" secular government of the U.S.  And if the fevered and frenetic ""veneration"" of the life-size cut-out of George Bush doesn't come to within a fraction of a Biblical cubit from out-and-out idol (or Fuehrer) worship, then I don't know my Golden Calves ... or my Fuehrers.Irreverence and disgust for the ""piety"" and ""sincerity"" of the deluded ""born-again"" players in this drama aside, I must say that the documentary saddened me profoundly.  I have a profound distaste for child abuse, whether physical, psychological, emotional or ""spiritual.""  The makers of the documentary offer no solution to the troubling state of affairs that exists when a whatever-goes sense of ""freedom of religion"" not only permits but condones, empowers and even encourages such abuse.  Perhaps, like purchasing tobacco or alcohol, the day will come will ""religion"" will not be available to anyone under the age of majority.  In my opinion, such is both highly desirable and long overdue, especially from the perspective of those who think the children of the ""next generation"" are important not for our purposes but for their own.  Unfortunately, I sincerely doubt I'll ever live to see such a leveling up for our species.  Children, I fear, will remain possessions to be used as compliant tools to extend the personal agendas of their elders long after my generation - and the one after it - are forgotten.  If Evangelical Christianity (or any fundamentalist, absolutist anti-rational ""religion"") gains the supremacy it demands, that fear is likely to be a guaranteed and infinitely tragic certainty.",5,"A

1035235,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B000KLQUV2,Jessica Lux,"[4, 6]","Jesus Camp is important documentary not so much for secular Americans who are already highly suspicious of evangelicals, but for the mainline Christian and Catholic populations who practice their religion in balance with their socio-political life.  This movie exposes a horrific underbelly of ""Christian"" brainwashing and cultural warfare.  Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady follow Pentecostal Preacher Becky Fischer as she brainwashes children with a Christian message that is heavily tainted with hate, intolerance, and ignorance.  The bible camp in this movie is nothing like the vacation bible school my peers attended during elementary school in New England, and to most of the world, these people appear to live in a fantastical fairytale.  The scary thing is how much the church leaders and speakers truly believe their own message of hate and fear.The filmmakers are eerily silent throughout the documentary, and this attitude contributes to the power of the film.  The camera follows church leaders and members free of any editorial commentary.  As a viewer, I am deathly curious how Pastor Becky Fisher got involved with the church, and about her outside life, but I know that keeping the film on an even, unbiased keel makes it accessible to the widest possible audience.  Viewers can approach this film in the framework of their own socio-political beliefs, with their own bias.  Judging from the reviews, viewers of all religious backgrounds gleaned powerful insights from this piece of cinema.Seeing Ted Haggard (of the homosexual-bashing closet-meth-using-male-prostitute-hiring fame) preach is alone worth the price of admission for this one.

1035236,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000KLQUV2,JGC,"[9, 10]","""Jesus Camp"" offers a rarely-seen behind-the-scenes look inside the lives of Christian Fundamentalists. I'm not exactly sure what to make of ""Jesus Camp."" Maybe, I should qualify that, I'm not sure what to make of (most) of these people in this documentary.This docu-DVD is somewhat un-slanted. It more or less shows a slice of life, showing Christian Evangelicals. ""Jesus Camp"" proved that more or less this way of living/thinking is no longer an anomaly. Interspersed throughout the DVD were comments from a (fictitious?) radio DJ which included some thought-provoking voiceovers.It was interesting to see these parents home-school their children, complete with their own ""Christian Pledge of Allegiance."" Home-schooling in general is such a rare occurrence. I was also surprised to learn that more than 70% of home-schooled children are from Christian Fundamentalist families. In this crazy society with violence, drugs and teen-pregnancy is home-schooling the solution? Or does home-schooling do more harm than benefit? This DVD doesn't answer those (my) questions, it just shows how some choose to raise their kids.I am a big fan of Ro O'Donnell (you know, the Antichrist, aka ""the most annoying celebrity."") Anyway, someone sent her a message on her blog the other day saying that ""Jesus Camp"" was child abuse and Ro's reply was, ""tragic, and yes, child abuse."" When I first watched this I didn't necessarily assert the children of ""Jesus Camp"" to be victims of any type of violence (either physical or psychological.) But then I thought about it, and it did make sense. Because any parent who would teach their children hate (even if it is done with good intention) is doing a great disservice.I was and am still very taken by the entire film. These children seemed bright, intelligent, honest and very well-behaved. And I think it's great that they believe in Jesus and love Jesus and worship Jesus. It was even more riveting to see the parents. They seemed dedicated to their cause. But it was also somewhat shocking and sad. Because these small kids were being used as pawns, almost. They were taught to convert ""nonbelievers"" and I also had to ask myself if this was done with total altruism? I'm sure the little girl in the bowling alley who went up to the stranger and gave her that Christian-propaganda brochure was totally genuine. But what about the adult(s) who instructed her (or should I say, brainwashed?) to do this? Do they really want to save the souls of all the laughing sinners or are they motivated by something else?There was also a lot of talk about ""hell"" and about being ""evil."" Were they trying to scare the children into going along with the rest of the sheep in the flock? Why is fear-mongering so prevalent in Fundamentalist Christianity?The low-point of the movie (at least, for me) was when that heavyset blonde youth minister, Becky Fischer, brought up a life-size poster of Bush during her sermon. (Incidentally, this is the same proselytizer  who stated that watching ""Harry Potter"" was a sin and evil!) Personally, I could care less what anyone's political beliefs are, but I do find it offensive (not to mention, vulgar) to see politics mixed with religion. Because (contrary to the Christian Fundamentalists' beliefs) this is not a Christian Country; this is a country with Freedom for All Religions. A president should represent all Americans instead of soliciting to a specific market simply to get reelected. And it was absolutely sickening (yet oddly hilarious) to see these poor kids ""thank the president"" like he was another idol for these zealots to worship. By pandering in this bankrupt method, Becky proved that even the devil can quote the scriptures.I also noticed another aspect of the film that seemed curious. Why were more than 99.9% of the children and adults w-h-i-t-e? Were they excluding non-whites? Sometimes what an efficient detective has to do is gather up all their clues. Sometimes it's very difficult to come up with a clear and concise picture, otherwise. But after I looked at all the clues this film had to offer and heard the comments I have to ask, how is this different from putting on white sheets and burning a crucifix on a Black-American's lawn? As far as I'm concerned, any form of bigotry is hate which is nothing more than poison.Becky also made more than one attempt to compare her cause to Fundamentalism Islam. She stated that children in the Middle East would kill for their religion and couldn't understand why American Christian kids weren't as fanatical. (I'm sure she didn't know that the largest Muslim State isn't in the Middle East, but in fact is in Southest Asia; Indonesia.) This was sad and somewhat grotesque to see and hear such things because it was totally irresponsible. This picture reminded me of the movie ""Monster"" (this movie was based on the life of the late female serial-killer, Eileen Wuornos.) Because both films tried to lend a bit of realism, life, compassion and sadness to their protagonists; Eileen Wournous and Becky Fischer, respectively.I'm not exactly sure why, but after watching this movie I had somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe because it didn't answer (m)any of my questions? Although the movie did teach me one important fact; that anyone who chooses to use the Bible (or any other Abrahamic book of God) for their complete and total education is a danger to themselves and to their families.As Ms. Dolly Parton sang, ""Questions I have many, answers but a few. But we're here to learn, the spirit burns, to know the greater truth."" In this mixed-up world I really do not know what I believe in anymore. But I do know that Jesus is Love. Maybe that's enough.",4,Concentration Camp,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,5694,"['Jesus', 'Camp', 'rarely-seen', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'lives', 'Christian', 'Fundamentalists', ""'m"", 'not',

1035238,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B000KLQUV2,J. Michael,"[9, 10]","""Jesus Camp"", a 2006 documentary about a Pentecostal summer camp for children, has had liberal America alternately cowering in fear and up in arms, due to its startling revelations that some Americans take Christianity rather seriously and would like to use the democratic process to change public policy. Rendered hysterical by the fear that a Christian Taliban of Bible-quoting Bushbots will soon be marching into their respective urban enclaves to burn down the alternative coffee houses and yoga schools, American lefties have shown that they are in serious need of a sense of proportion and a field trip to the America with which they are so obviously out of touch. I have my own problems with the church depicted in this film, but it's deranged to consider these fanatics any kind of threat to American democracy and it's hypocritical to condemn them for doing what is their Constitutional right in a free society.""Jesus Camp"" centers around a Pentecostal church led by a loud-mouthed, grossly obese female ""pastor"" named Becky Fischer who is shown indoctrinating a group of children at the church's summer camp in North Dakota. I don't use the word ""indoctrinate"" pejoratively; it's just a statement of fact. Every religion, parent, school, etc. indoctrinates children in the group's own tenets and ideologies. It is somewhat disturbing to see young children programmed in such fanaticism, but it's no less disturbing to see other young children spouting off liberal propaganda that their parents and schoolteachers quite obviously put into their heads. If New York and London critics don't like the fact that this church indoctrinates its young in Jesus and conservative politics, then they should try practicing a little more of the tolerance they're always preaching about.What made me upset was the disgusting emotional manipulation this bully of a pastor and her lackeys put these kids through. Watching her psychologically destroy these children with tactics like her hellfire and damnation sermon and reduce them to blubbering, self-hating puddles of tears who can only be built back up through the ministry and approval of ""Pastor"" Becky is to witness a sickening form of child abuse. In that aspect, this church can indeed be regarded as cult-like. She doesn't just want to influence their religious thinking or get them to vote a certain way when they get older; she wants to control these children. Because of whatever psychological defect this woman has, she wants and needs to be at the very center of their lives, to be worshiped by them.

1035239,A3KUUII2GSHN7T,B000KLQUV2,"Joel Munyon ""Joel Munyon""","[17, 31]","From reading most of the reviews from other amazon patrons on how glorious and true to life this film is, I can decipher one of two things from such assertions...#1. Their experience in the American church is very limited, and they have allowed their own preconceived prejudice to connect with those of the film, and paint a view of the American church with one very broad brush.#2. Those experiences, although perhaps being isolated to one denominational tag, are all they need to agree that 'Jesus Camp', as SOULBOOGIEALEX so ignorantly stated,  ""is one of the few honest portrayals of the right wing evangelist's movement.""'Jesus Camp' is not objective, and if it's honest, its only honesty lives within the view of one sect of Christians (perhaps no more than a few hundred and all from the same church) - hardly enough ammo to label an entire populace of churchgoers as politically-hungry extremists, which is clearly the agenda of this film. As a twenty-six year old who has seen his family screwed by the church on a grandiose scale on at least three occasions, including the career and character assasination of both my parents, I probably have the 2nd most cause to be ticked off at the American organized church, right behind those poor souls who have been abused by men of the cloth. I cannot, however, agree that this film was by any means objective or for that matter, even minimally profound. A group of first-year junior college students could have put out a film like this with a little cash and a little time on their hands. To say otherwise is to not know the diversity within the American church and not know what good, objective filmmaking is all about.What 'Jesus Camp' so desperately tries to sell us on - and by all the naive reviews from others here at amazon, does a good job at doing - is that there is a correlation between Bush and Christianity, between the turmoil of the nation and Christianity, and between the coming social trials of the nation and Christianity. The film paints Christians as mindless, brainwashed fanatics, hell-bent on propogating their message at any cost. There is even a cheap attempt to use an interview with a female pastor and connect the dots between radical Islam and radical Christianity. We also see...* young pre-teens weeping at the idea of sin of redemption like lunatics, strong out on a good brainwashing and a trip on Holy Spirit dust.* pre-teens and their pastors attacking Harry Potter as a devilish tool.* pre-teens ""witnessing"" to complete strangers as if they're just another number for the glory of the kingdom (gag). :-(* parents discussing the horrors of evolution with their homeschool children as I'm sure we realize how much the concept ofevolution is under attack these days(sarcastic chuckle).* a radio talkshow host spouting off mindless diatribes that lack substance, concrete examples, and simple coherency.The films' main attack comes from the idea that Christians are taking over the nation through political policy. The only offering of example the film uses is the Kansas law that teaches intelligent design alongside evolution, a law that places both theories out in the open without advocating either as bona fide fact. That's it. The film showed me nothing else. At that point I was left wondering, ""Is that all you've got? A simple Kansas law that does nothing but promote more conversation in the classroom? Isn't there some other grand scheme the Christians are cooking up out there with their lackey politicians?""I simply cannot understand why the filmmakers, who are oh-so-objective mind you, didn't decide to follow any one of the millions of normal Christians around who dedicate their lives towards giving, loving and human rights causes (like my friend who's church is raising money to stop the child slave trade in central America, as he now rides across the nation on his bike promoting awareness to lazy Americans who are probably inside watching 'Jesus Camp') instead of a group of Christians that in all my time on this earth, I have never encountered the sort until watching this film. Why, I wonder, did they not decide to do a documentary on Willow Creek Community Church and the millions of dollars they put into AIDS causes overseas, or how nearly every mission in this nation is church-sponsored? You see, so many are eager to throw out the baby with the bathwater because of their own prejudice, and this film is a prime example of that. We all must remember, the American church is bigger than our experiences within it, or within the views of this cheap, subjective film.A hollow, agenda-ridden film that is anything but profound or well-crafted.",2,The Christians are coming!

I won't go into it all here, because others have said it better than I probably could.Here are some things I found a bit irritating about this movie:- The Alito nomination. They kept doing a voiceover of radio news about Alito being nominated to the Supreme Court. Although I do find Alito a bit socially conservative, I hardly think his nomination has much to do with the people in the movie. Alito is for instance I think Roman Catholic, and thus, probably would not see eye-to-ey with the people in the film (Ted Kennedy and Nancy Pelosi are Catholic, and they have power, should I fear them ?). This part of the film fell totally flat for me.- Saying ""take back America for Christ"". To some, that might sound scary (I am a non-believer, BTW). But really what does that mean ? I bet Jesse Jackson and John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. used terms like that. Why is it a sign of depth when a Democrat says it, but when a conservative says it, it is ""scary"" ? Didn't Clinton (not to mention) Gore, pepper his speech and his ideas with religious notions (someone mentioned that Clinton actually used the word ""Jesus"" and ""God' more than Bush.- The film shows us a snapshot one one tiny community, without really putting it into a bigger context. For instance, are these people representative of evangelicals, or of Christians ? That is left unanswered.- That liberal Christian radio talkshow host. Where was he again ? I find it a little hard to believe that guy is legit, for some reason. I mean, the radiowaves are not exactly ""exploding"" with left-leaning Christian talk show hosts. I am not saying he is fake, but I just wanted to know more about him.I just want to make one final comment. Here in Texas, a lot of the Christian camps have had their negligence with respect to the children politically covered in Austin. What I mean is, the GOP here in Texas legally exempted them from things like abuse. I find that extremely shameful, particularly from a party that talks about ""protecting the children"".It was interesting that now-discredited ""evangelical leader"" Ted Haggard is in the film. The notion that this guy (who lied about his relationship to a gay prostitute) would be teaching kids about morality, is the height of hypocrisy.

Limited in scope, but representative of a mass movement that's had a significant impact on our day to day lives - and wants to have more of an impact. Levi, the main kid who is followed in the film, looks to be a born grifter. He's a master of knowing how to say what people want, in the way they want to hear it. His sister, Rachael, is learning the game, but is less nuanced; her bit about martyrs is painful and funny as she makes up a scene that she claims to have heard about.All of this rings true to me; I was a fundie in high school, in Missouri, 30+ years ago, and the dynamics remain very similar. There is still a heavy emphasis on Jesus as the genie in the bottle who will grant your wishes. God is the judgmental, abusive father who constantly needs to reiterate how much he loves you - but He'll send you to Hell in a heartbeat if you don't figure out what he wants. There is still an Us vs. Them mentality, not just toward unbelievers, but toward Christians who are not like one's own community. Like the Gnostics, there is a Children of Light vs. Children of Darkness foundation underlying it all, presupposing that unbelievers wish to persecute or lead believers astray, resulting in isolation to preserve one's faith (as when Levi says he would prefer to attend a school that teaches Intelligent Design rather than Evolution; it is assumed to be dangerous to one's faith to be exposed to different, conflicting ideas). I remember warnings from the pulpit against  being ""unequally yoked with"" (marrying or dating) unbelievers. The only accepted reason to interact with unbelievers is for the purpose of evangelizing them or otherwise advancing the cause of ""The Kingdom"". And, of course, there is the intense but unexamined obsession with all things sexual, and the craven need for powerful authority figures.I'd have liked to hear a child psychologist or two talk about the adult/child processes depicted in the film. Given the ages of the children here, and a knowledge of their various stages of development, a discussion of brainwashing techniques and indoctrination and the use of peer pressure and authority - driven pressures would be well-worth hearing.Though the definitive documentary on the Religious Right in America is yet to be made, Jesus Camp is worth seeing.

1035243,A332MW6OA1LYDF,B000KLQUV2,John Noodles,"[25, 84]","I  found this movie more than merely watchable--it was captivating.  It presents a culture I'm unfamiliar with--charismatic evangelical Christianity. (Also, we get to see smarmy, lickerish Ted Haggard denounce homosexuality soon before he was outed himself for his taste in meth and male prostitutes--and what a treat that is!  The guy is creepy.)The problem with the movie is that it is brazenly dishonest. Indeed, it is one of the vilest pieces of propaganda I've seen in a long time.  The filmmakers focus in fringe evangelicals-- Pentacostals--who when seized by the spirit are given to flopping around on the floor and speaking in tongues.  They speak in militaristic language of fighting the good fight against sin, and the implication is that they are fomenting violence (they aren't--at least the filmmakers produce no evidence of that).  Throughout the film, the filmmakers  intercut scenes of some hand-wringing leftist Air America talk show host bemoaning the political influence of evangelicals, and even admonishing evangelical callers not to vote their values or inculcate those value in their children, advice that, given the overall slant of the film, I assume the  filmmakers agree with.  Whose values should they be teaching children? Che Guevera's?  Ted Kennedy's?  Are you seriously suggesting that parents should not be moral guides to their children, and that personal values should not influence voting?  Or are you suggesting that values should not influence voting only among Christians?  Perhaps these leftist are so certain of their own righteousness that the rest of us need only look to them for guidance.  (This recalls Howard ""Yeeeeeoooowwww!"" Dean's admonition for conservatives to stop voting religious/gun/gay issues.)The truth is (a truth the filmmakers shamefully never make clear) is that Pentacostals are far from representative of evangelicals generally.  They share a basic similarity of theology in many cases--some permutation of Calvinism--but the similarities end there.  The folks you see in this  film are closer in their beliefs to Appalachian snake handlers than mainstream evangelical Christians, and most evangelicals will say as much. But this inconvenient fact doesn't stop the filmmakers--two dishonest New York liberals--from suggesting over and over again that all evangelicals are like this, and that George W. Bush takes his marching orders from those folks flopping around on the floor.

I had to laugh out loud when she said in the beginning of her film that most Christians today are 'Fat and lazy'.The most disturbing individual in this entire film is Levi, but htere are some very spooky people as well. Levi is a kid with a crewcut, but has what looks like a racoon tail hainging off the back of his head. Apparently his parents know the Bible frontwards and backwards, but don't know how to cut a mullet. Levi will remind you of Malacai from 'Children of the Corn'. He preaches and has a lot of one on one time with the camera.There is a cute little girl named Rachael. She tries to save people, like the hot blond in the bowling alley. She's a sweet kid, but it is not hard to tell that she has been totally submerged into this culture. It is children like this who grow up to be socially awkward, confused, and angry.Then we have the 'Abortion Man'. Truthfully he looks like a weird pedophile with a bad combover. He talks about the sins of abortion and shows the children tiny little plastic fetuses, making all the kids cry.The most appaling part of this movie is when they brought out a huge cardboard cutout of George W. Bush. The witch demanded the children say hello and give Bush their blessings because he is an upright Christian man on a holy crusade. I watched this with my jaw dropped open. Any fool who believes in Bush and his phony baloney has a lot more problems than sin.And last we have a poorly done sermon by a man named Ted who looked very familiar to me for some reason. He started preaching about the sins of homosexuality, and then I remembered, THIS GUY IS GAY! HE was on the news when he came out of the closet. So what the heck does all this add up to?The only guy in this movie who made any sense was the radio talk show host. He was the only one in the film who had functioning brain cells.I am frightened for America for many reasons, but now I have one more. I must say I am a God fearing Christian. Jesus has saved me and He is my Savior. I believe in the Bible and I go to church when I can. Having said that, I believe one's faith should be taught and not crammed down your throat.

1035245,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000KLQUV2,Jonathan Appleseed,"[24, 28]","The so-called Children's Pastor, Becky Fischer, identified at the end of the program that the correct time to teach children is before they are seven, as what they will have learned will be burned indelibly into their minds. This is true, and it demonstrates that what she is doing is no better than brainwashing. She's employing straightforward cult tactics: get them while they're young, berate them constantly by telling them they're worthless (in her case, full of sin), and speak of great loss and suffering if you do not do as you are told (in her case, going to hell if you don't step in line). If you're told something enough, you'll start to believe it.Last I checked, teachers in public schools aren't employing those tactics when teaching science.Yet the Bible becomes science to her. Harry Potter would have been put to death if he lived in Old Testament times. She conveniently overlooks how many people *right in front of her* that would be put to death if they lived during Old Testament times. Just one example: touch the skin of a pig...we'd lose every football team in the country.It frightens me that she, and people like her, are making themselves responsible for the teaching of this next generation - the generation that will apparently usher in the Second Coming. They tell things like this to the children (as well as that America is God's nation) without putting anything into historical context. For example, the kids who are convinced that their generation will see ""Salvation,"" aren't told about the countless times that Christ's second coming has been prophesied, and the countless times that the prophecies, many of which were based on strict biblical interpretation, were wrong. They are fed ONE line, so can believe only ONE thing.Science doesn't prove anything, they say (although I'll bet their children are vaccinated and given antibiotics when necessary - yes, Virginia, medicine is science). Yet their syllogisms are faulty. Prayer is taken out of school, and the schools fall part - so says a mother convinced that she could home school her kids as well as they could be public schooled. Uh...no, your kid's not going to get a good education. Not if that's the kind of logic you employ.I thought to myself while watching this that ""The Exorcist"" was no longer my scariest movie. This has usurped it. I saw dozens of children speaking in tongues, later sobbing because they were told that they were dirty sinners.Possibly the most disturbing scene involved the cardboard cutout of George Bush. It was treated as a) a real person; and b) like a messiah. I hope George didn't see that; his messianic complex is considerable enough as is.I have great respect for the filmmakers.

1035248,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000KLQUV2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","This 2006 documentary by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady which takes us to Kansas City, Missouri to meet Becky Fischer who runs an Evangelical church camp for young children caused quite a stir upon its release. This is a hard film to critique without personal and/or religious bias, but I'll try my best although I can tell you with no bias that this is a terrific documentary.Becky Fischer is an evangelical pastor who founded the ""Kids on Fire School of Ministry,"" located in Devil's Lake, North Dakota (and I'm the only one who finds this amusing apparently). Fischer says she wants America's youth to be as radical and dedicated to the Gospel as Muslim children are to Islam. Initially, I felt Fischer was a genuine, dedicated woman with extremely misguided views but as the film progresses she seems more like a middle-American version of Adolph Hitler. The documentary focuses on Fischer and three of the kids who attend her camp.The town that makes up the film's setting is populated with Bush-loving; Evangelical Christians who believe Creationism is the only explanation for the world. Jesus Camp does not intend to be a definitive document of Evangelical Christianity, but rather these particular believers and how they indoctrinate their youth with their beliefs. One of the three kids who's given special attention in the film is Levi, a 12-year-old aspiring pastor whose mother makes some of the most infuriating, controversial comments in the film about her belief in Creationism and her disdain for the public school system.Like almost everyone who watches it, I found Jesus Camp more disturbing than many horror films. What makes Jesus Camp disturbing is that these (rather extremist) beliefs are being force-fed to children this young and, while some may disagree, I thought the children in this film seemed like brainwashed zombies. Due to their young age, they can hardly be called ""free-thinking individuals,"" but these are children who express very definite, concrete beliefs in their religion yet their thoughts sound robotic and scripted. The camp's cult-like, persuasive atmosphere which attempts to indoctrinate these children while they're still young and nave is a frightening thing by itself, but the image of young, prepubescent children chanting in tongues is more than just a little disturbing.I don't see the actions of Becky Fischer and the parents as simply passing on their own religious beliefs to the children, as most people do that. What they're doing to the children in this film is mind-control and is completely inappropriate with the ages of these kid's factored in. Fischer is involved in a debate toward the end of the film with Mike Papantonio, a radio talk-show host where she explains that she doesn't believe that people can choose their belief system once they pass childhood. This is the statement that changed any opinions I had about Fischer, because that statement is a thinly veiled way of saying ""they can't be manipulated into believing what I want them to believe after they pass childhood."" While not everyone will agree with my opinion about Fischer's ministry indoctrinating children with their propaganda, few would argue my belief that it's inappropriate to preach about the evils of abortion to children this young.It's essential for me to add that Ted Haggard's appearance in this film (prior to his controversy) adds a whole new undertone to the content of the movie. Now, the director's give a fair, even-handed view of Fischer's church but you can't ignore the bias that sometimes slips through the cracks in the way a shot is framed or presented in the context of the movie. Watching the people in this film, I found it hard to judge the filmmaker's for any bias they may or may not have had. In conclusion, Jesus Camp is an important, disturbing, and eye-opening documentary that will evoke a wide-range of emotions from its viewers.GRADE: A",5,"Important & Enlightening, A Very Good Documentary",1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,3909,"['2006', 'documentary', 'Heidi', 'Ewing', 'Rachel', 'Grady', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Missouri', 'meet', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'who', 'Evangelical', 'church', 'camp', 'young', 'children', 'caused', 'quite', 'stir', 'release', 'hard', 'film', 'critique', 'personal', 'and/or', 'religious', 'bias', ""'ll"", 'try', 'best', 'can', 'tell', 'bias', 'terrific', 'documentary.Becky', 'Fischer', 'evangelical', 'pastor', 'who', 'founded', 'Kids', 'Fire', 'School', 'Ministry', 'located', 'Devil', 'Lake', 'North', 'Dakota', ""'m"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'amusing', 'apparently', 'Fischer', 'America', 'youth', 'be', 'radical', 'dedicated', 'Gospel', 'Muslim', 'children', 'are', 'Islam', 'Initially', 'felt', 'Fischer', 'was', 'genuine', 'dedicated', 'woman', 'extremely', 'misguided', 'views', 'film', 'more', 'middle-American', 'version', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'Fischer', 'three', 'kids', 'who', 'attend', 'camp.The', 'town', 'up', 'film', 'setting', 'populated', 'Bush-loving', 'Evangelical', 'Christians', 'who', 'believe', 'Creationism', 'only', 'explanation', 'world', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'not', 'intend', 'be', 'definitive', 'document', 'Evangelical', 'Christianity', 'rather', 'particular', 'believers', 'how', 'indoctrinate', 'youth', 'beliefs', 'One', 'three', 'kids', 'who', 'given', 'special', 'attention', 'film', 'Levi', '12-year-old', 'aspiring', 'pastor', 'mother', 'most', 'infuriating', 'controversial', 'comments', 'film', 'belief', 'Creationism', 'disdain', 'public', 'school', 'system.Like', 'almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'found', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'more', 'disturbing', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'What', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'disturbing', 'rather', 'extremist', 'beliefs', 'are', 'being', 'force-fed', 'children', 'young', 'may', 'disagree', 'thought', 'children', 'film', 'seemed', 'brainwashed', 'zombies', 'Due', 'young', 'age', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'called', 'free-thinking', 'individuals', 'are', 'children', 'who', 'express', 'very', 'definite', 'concrete', 'beliefs', 'religion', 'yet', 'thoughts', 'sound', 'robotic', 'scripted', 'camp', 'cult-like', 'persuasive', 'atmosphere', 'indoctrinate', 'children', ""'re"", 'still', 'young', 'nave', 'frightening', 'thing', 'image', 'young', 'prepubescent', 'children', 'chanting', 'tongues', 'more', 'just', 'little', 'disturbing.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'actions', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'parents', 'simply', 'passing', 'own', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'children', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'What', ""'re"", 'doing', 'children', 'film', 'mind-control', 'completely', 'inappropriate', 'ages', 'kid', 'factored', 'Fischer', 'involved', 'debate', 'end', 'film', 'Mike', 'Papantonio', 'radio', 'talk-show', 'host', 'where', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'can', 'choose', 'belief', 'system', 'pass', 'childhood', 'statement', 'changed', 'opinions', 'had', 'Fischer', 'statement', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'way', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'manipulated', 'believing', 'what', 'want', 'believe', 'pass', 'childhood', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'agree', 'opinion', 'Fischer', 'ministry', 'indoctrinating', 'children', 'propaganda', 'few', 'would', 'argue', 'belief', 'inappropriate', 'preach', 'evils', 'abortion', 'children', 'young.It', 'essential', 'add', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'appearance', 'film', 'prior', 'controversy', 'whole', 'new', 'undertone', 'content', 'movie', 'Now', 'director', 'give', 'fair', 'even-handed', 'view', 'Fischer', 'church', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'bias', 'slips', 'cracks', 'way', 'shot', 'framed', 'presented', 'context', 'movie', 'Watching', 'people', 'film', 'found', 'hard', 'judge', 'filmmaker', 'bias', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'conclusion', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'important', 'disturbing', 'eye-opening', 'documentary', 'will', 'evoke', 'wide-range', 'emotions', 'viewers.GRADE']",Jesus Camp

Five stars for this film, because it is beautifully produced, but in content it is absolutely horrifying.  Small children gathered together to ""speak in tongues"" and fall down on the floor in rapture?  Is this not child abuse?  Is it not true that children need to explore their world on their own, instead of being terrified to death by claims that if they do not believe in the narrowly drawn world of ""Evangelical"" Christians, they will go straight to hell?  It is to the great credit of the producers of this film that they slyly make fun of the ""Evangelicals"", but don't go over the top with it.  A ... well, how shall I put this? ... a bodaciously voluptuous woman is allowed to complain about ""fat, lazy"" people who don't understand her tiny view of the world.  A girl is allowed to say that ""Britney Spears sings about boys and girls.  We Christians don't believe in that.""  In what?  In boys and girls? And the scenes of adults yelling at children are nicely intercut with an Air America radio host who just cannot believe the nonsense which these people are spouting.  But the people who are the center of this film are -- and I'm sorry, I cannot find another word for it -- evil.  Well-intentioned, I'm sure, but evil.  They all but call on small children to take up arms in defense of their battle against science, homosexuals, Harry Potter and anyone and anything else that does not fit into their understanding, such as it is, of life.  Some of the film dwells on the issue of home schooling.  To me, home schooling is astonishing primarily in that America allows this to happen.  Is it not ultimately clear that home schooling centers largely on people who wish to deny the accumulated wisdom of centuries of science?  Is it not up to America to make sure that her children receive a proper education and not some claptrap that has been dreamed up by the supporters of so-called ""intelligent design""?  I write this as a committed Christian and activist in my church, but as God is my witness, at no point in my life have I ever been told that believing in God means that I must be stupid in every other aspect of my life.  ""Jesus Camp"" shows a dedicated effort to ensure that, as the film's ""protagonists"" put it, ""the key generation"" is as stupid as it possibly can be.  This is a documentary which must be seen by anyone who is concerned about the slow creep of fundamentalism in American sociopolitical life.

It is fairly obvious.The filmmakers obviously made a concerted effort to portray themselves as objective in their handling of the material, but in several instances--in admittedly subtle ways---they betrayed their obvious judgment of the film's subjects.

1035252,AISSRJ7E2L375,B000KLQUV2,"Kelly Garbato ""Marchpane!""","[16, 19]","Although Magnolia Pictures purchased JESUS CAMP from A&E; Indie Films in 2006 and subsequently attempted to pull it from Michael Moore's Traverse City Film Festival because, according to Magnolia president Eamonn Bowles, ""I don't want the perception out in the public that this is an agenda-laden film,"" JESUS CAMP is indeed laden with agendas.  Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady have produced a blood-curling documentary that reveals all too clearly the dangers that fundamental Christianity poses to our secular American democracy.JESUS CAMP follows three Kansas City area families as they travel to Devil's Lake, North Dakota, to attend Kids On Fire School of Ministry - the summer ""Jesus Camp"" of the movie's title.  Brothers Levi and Luke live in St. Robert, Missouri, and attend Rock of Ages Church.  Levi sports a rocking mullet and enjoys preaching.  Rachael attends the same church, and is quite the precocious proselytizer.  Rounding out the group is Tory (short for Victoria) of Lee's Summit, Missouri; she's a member of the children's praise dance team at Christ Triumphant Church.  While she tries to dance for the Lord, she admits to sometimes succumbing to sin and dancing for the wrong reasons: ""dancing for the flesh"".  She's ten.Kids on Fire was founded and is run by Becky Fischer and her ministry, Kids in Ministry International.  Fischer plays like a funny-yet-frightening fundie stereotype, what with her Harry Potter rants (""WARLOCKS ARE ENEMIES OF GOD!!!1!!""), obsession with sin and fits of hysteria.  Much of the film focuses on the summer camp itself, and these scenes are the most chilling.  Imagine, if you will, an auditorium filled with children and teens - kids speaking in tongues, rolling on the floor, convulsing as if from epileptic seizures, tears rolling from their Precious Moments eyes, faces red with exertion.  At times, some of the children seem almost delusional or in trance-like states.  Scary stuff.More frightening still is all the militarized, warmongering imagery invoked by adults and children alike: ""God's warriors."" ""God's Army."" ""This means war."" ""Foot soldiers."" ""Will you sacrifice your life for Jesus?"" Fischer justifies her army-building - the younger the soldiers, the better! - by comparing American Christians to Middle Eastern radical Muslims: the children of Islam learn to become martyrs at an early age, to fight and lay down their lives for their religion.  Rather than recognizing the abusive nature of such indoctrination,  Fischer reasons that Christians must do the same.  After all, this is war, is it not? (To up the ante, the DVD has a deleted scene in which Tory's father says of his pending deployment to Iraq, ""I see this as an all-expenses paid missionary trip."" No wonder we never got those flowers dubya promised us.)At Jesus Camp, the children also receive political instruction: there's an eerie pro-life lecture, complete with plastic feti and strips of tape reading ""life"" to cover the children's little mouths for a moment of silence; a speech about ""godly"" judges; and much talk about those supposed core values shared by this Judeo-Christian country.  All is presided over by a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush, for whom there is much prayer. The rituals resemble miniaturized, child-sized versions of those in Margaret Atwood's THE HANDMAID'S TALE: indoctrination at the Red Center; the Birth Ceremony; and Prayvaganzas, Salvagings and Particicutions. It's at once terrifying and hilarious.The children all inspired a mix of pity and revulsion in this atheist's cockles, but doe-eyed Rachael really stole the spotlight. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to call Child Protective Services or throttle her, shake some sense into her arrogant Christian self. Rachael spends much of the movie trying to ""save"" others: a stranger in the bowling alley, other children, her neighbors, random African American men on the street (""I think they're Muslim"").  Her parents, of course, think her proselytizing is just peachy; there's no consideration as to whether others, Christians and non-Christians alike, might find this insulting or offensive. Not that this is surprising, when her parents are off doing more of the same.  In a deleted scene, Rachael admits to ""working on"" her young neighbor while her parents simultaneously ""work on"" the girl's parents, trying to lure the family into their church (""cult"" is really a more appropriate term). Another deleted scene shows Rachael bragging about all the gifts God has given her: discerning of spirits, prophecy, speaking in tongues and hearing, talking to and understanding THE LORD.In short, Rachael's parents are successfully molding her into an insufferable little snot.In addition to the Jesus Camp footage, there's also some film of the families at home before the summer trip (for example, we see Levi being homeschooled by his mother, who ""teaches"" that creationism is the only means of explaining the mysteries of life and that ""global warming"" is a lie) and afterwards, during vacations to Colorado Springs (here, Ted Haggard makes a brief but glorious cameo) and Washington, DC (for a small but disquieting anti-choice protest). This is all set against the backdrop of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's resignation and Samuel Alito's nomination and confirmation.  Radio talk show host Mike Papantonio (of Air America Radio's Ring of Fire) provides the sole voice of reason, and p0wns Fischer in a one-on-one interview - in which she freely admits to ""indoctrinating"" children, and claims that she loves democracy but says that ""democracy is going to destroy us.""  Make no mistake - this is war, and fundamentalists of any and all stripes won't rest until they've remade the world in their image.Watching the horror that is Jesus Camp, I was reminded of two pertinent quotes:""I want to get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus. I want to feel his salvation all over my face."" - Eric Cartman""Such labelling of children with their parents' religion is child abuse."" - Richard DawkinsAnd there you have it - JESUS CAMP in three

The documentary makers made a statement by picking the footage they chose, a marketing firm for Evangelical Christian training would have likely picked very different scenes. But. The facts do speak for themselves.The raw emotion was uncomfortable to watch. Children parroting charismatic doctrine was also uncomfortable. One of the little girls, and some denominations, would label me as someone who doesn't get it or maybe falls short of being a Christian because I don't participate with extreme emotion when I worship, nor do I have the gift of speaking in tongues.

Evangelicals take the Bible very literally, believe in a literal devil, take ""revelations"" at its word, and believe that the end of days is looming. These beliefs are amply reinforced at Jesus camp.The film was informative in the sense that, as a non-evangelical (an atheist, actually) it is good to be reminded that people really do believe this stuff. Even my Christian girlfriend (evangelical, but on the 'liberal' side of things) found herself better able to look at the evangelical movement from the outside. The film does a good job and takes the 'camera that happens to be in the room' approach. There is no narrator, no commentary; just footage from before, during, and after Jesus camp.Yet, I find claims of the film's neutrality to be incredible. Judging from the overwhelming majority of reviews using words like ""scary"" and ""dangerous,"" and after having seen the film myself, I think the directors may well have gone out of their way to make a point and make the film's subjects look less than decent. I am not really complaining about this, as much as I am giving potential viewers a 'heads-up'. (It may also be that i projected my own biases onto the film.)This film brings up many subjects to ponder. Once we grapple with questions pertaining to the validity of Christianity (and evangelicalism with in it), there is also the issue of whether religion forces one into particular political views (these evangelicals are staunchly conservative). Apart from that, a large issue present in the film is the question of whether it is appropriate to raise kids into a particular faith and belief system(s) at all and how much is too much. Does education become brain-washing and indoctrination? If so, where is the line? Or is all education (arming children with particular facts) indoctrination?Whatever your views, this film will get you thinking about them (and their opposites). The directors certainly don't offer answers, but I still suspect that I know where they stand on the issues (and i suspect their stance to be very much against the type of evangelicalism of the film's subjects).

1035258,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000KLQUV2,LARRY,"[6, 7]","I viewed *Jesus Camp* with mixed feelings.  I guess because I was raised Pentacostal.  So, it was a trip through memory lane while watching this film.This documentary basically focused on Becky Fischer's ministry with Christian children, including an annual Bible camp.  Almost immediately, you'll hear Becky's purpose for this particular ministry.  She claimed that the Palestines are indoctrinating their children with bombs and guns.  So, her point is that why can't she teach American children about Christianity.  Then, towards the end, during her radio interview with Mike Papantonio, she stated that 7-, 8- & 9-year olds are impressionable and it is crucial to get the messages across to them.  In a sense, indoctrination is everywhere and is not limited to weaponry or Christianity.Before we see the Bible camp, Rachel and Heidi interviewed some children in their own homes.  You'll see how some children are homeschooled and how their mothers teach them about certain things, such as global warming not being that big of a deal.  You'll see a girl who loves to dance to Christian music.  However, she's concerned about how her dancing might lead her astray from God.  You'll see another girl who talks about nothing else but God and salvation.The Bible camp was really a week long revival for kids.  They're constantly given sermons (such as Harry Potter isn't good because he's a warlock).  They're singing Christian songs.  They're up front for altar calls, crying and speaking in tongues.  One boy was selected to preach.  So, with a Bible in hand, he goes over some Scriptures and practices his sermon.  It just keeps on going.  You'll see maybe a couple, if not more, clips of kids relaxing or playing.What I found odd about this whole thing was Becky's review of the children.  She has someone filming the sermon and the children.  So, after her sermon, when she's relaxing, she'd put in a tape, watch the children and make some observations and comments.  It was almost like she was trying to make sure that the children were genuine with their committment to God.The biggest attention is given towards the end when Ted Haggard appeared.  Two boys attended this particular church of Ted's.  After the service, they met up with Ted.  Ted appeared to be friendly and encouraged them to keep it up with preaching.  Who knew that within a matter of time, Ted would have been busted for his dabblings with men and drugs?!?Now, you could probably sit back, watch this documentary and be disgusted with it.  How dare these evangelical/Pentecostal Christians brainwash the children?  But then, you have to ask yourself, where else are children being ""brainwashed""?  Anyways, you're going to be amazed by what these children say and believe.

The film harkens back to Lord of the Flies, William Golding's novel and subsequent movies.  In the film ordinary young boys gradually fall into savagery when stranded on a desert island.  They paint their faces, make sacrifices and pray to an unknown entity.  Demons are beaten away with sticks.  They are dominated by the strongest boy who gets them to commit murder to assuage the unknown.  The smallest children succumb the fastest.Fast forward to Jesus Camp.  The kids paint their faces for reasons never explained.  They use sticks and hammers to bash at a demon.  They are led by the oldest boy who dominates the group.  They pray to George Bush who is advertised as being the only savior from secular society.Of course this a creepy film with very young children being thought controlled by a harridan who's infected by her religion.  Recent history is filled with parallel examples:  Imperial Japan, the Third Reich, North Korea, Cuba, and of course Jonestown.  Children, as the adult leader says, are ""so usable.""Unlike other reviewers I do not fret that this movement will gain traction in this culture.  Cults have come and gone throughout history.

One example says that 75% of Evangelicals are home schooled.  So, find a creepily weird Pentecostal bible camp and then generalize to all evangelicals.  Oh yeah, be sure to play a soundtrack of ominously haunting music just so that those who can't put this together will come away with an ""ewwwwwwww"" feeling about the whole thing.It becomes readily apparent that the purpose of this film is to show some disturbing images of children being indoctrinated into a certain relatively small subculture of American Christianity and then generalize it over all people who call themselves ""born again"" or ""evangelical"", and of course it's plain to see that these are just typical supporters of George W.

It is absolutely not. The families and ministries featured are of a decidedly peculiar kind, prone to an almost primitive emotional frenzy and superstition, and their tactics with children and even their beliefs would come under heavy criticism from most of the mainstream evangelical community.I was dismayed that the filmmakers purposely allowed the possibility to linger that the most colorful and warlike figurative language used by camp leaders in the film (""lay down your life for Jesus"", etc.) had potentially violent or dangerous connotations. No effort was made to give the proper context of what was said, yet included in the bonus material was a scene in which Becky Fischer (a central subject in the film) says plainly that as Christians they categorically denounce violence as a tactic, and that their ""weapons"" are prayer and votes. I can only conclude that this balancing and sane bit of information didn't make the final cut because it diffused the anticipated sense of apprehension on the part of uninitiated viewers.Add to that the cheap contrivance of having a radio talk show host provide inline running commentary, just in case the audience hasn't independently managed to arrive at the conclusion that a wave of right-wing religious crazies are on the verge of imposing a theocracy on unsuspecting secularists everywhere.While I was disturbed by some of what I saw, the bottom line is this: we live in a free country. Churches are allowed to be big and influential. Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean that they are ""up to no good"" when they practice their beliefs as they see fit and vote as they please. Nor do they have to answer to anyone for passing those beliefs on to their kids.

There used to be a lot of open land for this.  But the wide open spaces are gone now.  We're all bumping up against each other.  And it is essential we know about each other.That's why I glad I saw Jesus Camp.  Because even though I heard about the Evangelical Christian movement, this film makes it up close and personal.This is a documentary featuring Pastor Becky Fischer whose goal in life is to train children to not only love Jesus, but to be willing to give their lives for him.  We get to meet her as well as the children and it feels sort of funny to hear the words coming out of the children's mouths.  One 12-year old boy talks about how he was ""saved"" at the age of five.  One 11-year old girl gives out Christian literature to everyone on the street.  And a 10-year old girl seems absolutely possessed as she talks about sin and love and devoting her life to Jesus.I find this all eye opening and scary.  I see a violent army forming right there on the screen.  These are Christian soldiers.  And I can't see any good coming from this.The film also shows Air America talk show host Mike Papantonio. He also considers himself a Christian, and he speaks with the voice of reason.  But in all the scenes in which we meet him, he is simply talking and broadcasting his program.It's the children who steal this show though because they are presented in the ecstasy of practicing their religion. They are beautiful children.  They are smart.  And as they accept Jesus, they are rejecting the rest of the world. Hating the rest of the world.  In fact, they are at WAR with the rest of the world.It all makes me think about how nave I used to be.  I really thought we could all live together in peace.  I was raised that way.  I brought up my children that way.  My grandchildren see a big wide happy world.  I would like them to love and accept everybody.But there are other forces out there.  Forces that are growing stronger every day.  The Evangelical Christians are fighting a spiritual battle.  I understand they represent about 10 percent of the American population.

I don't want to come across to strongly, but I am sure this this rub some people the wrong way no matter how I say it.It is deceptive to call the people in this documentary evangicals...  Any of the people I have met who are like this would call themselves pentacostals or charismatics; they would call evangelicalism dead.  I just want to say that to those who are not familiar with Christianity or are adverse to Christians.  This is NOT mainstream Christianity; people who practice these things are not practicing biblical things although they may be well-intentioned.Not everyone who homeschools their children homeschool them in the fashion that is shown in this movie, this is very deceptive.  The major flaw I see in this movie is its inability to show different kinds of Christianity, which for those who are not well-versed in the bible or what is considered orthodox Christianity could be easily decieved to believe that these things are normal Christian behaviors. I feel very blessed I grew up with parents who came from the ""Jesus Movement"" an extremely charismatic movement, but in time my parents became much more conservative, and I am thankful for that.  I was homeschooled, but my mother used a very hands-off approach; meaning, she didn't actually teach me, I learned everything I know from books and the ACE curriculum.  Yes, the curriculum was Christian, but since my mom was so hands-off about things, I was able to really weigh things for myself and study the Bible on my own terms.Becky Fischer, the woman who leads the Bible camp, is obviously well-inentioned, but is extremely misguided.  Over the last year God has led me through studying the Bible, teaching me that I need to test all things (1 Thessalonians 5), test the spirits (1 John 4), and the beareans (Acts 17) who were of more noble character because they tested everything that Paul said based on the scriptures!!!The problem with this ministry to train children for ""God's Army"" is that the children instead of being taught how to study the scriptures are really brain-washed.  It is said, they are to taught to hate everything in this world and to hate the flesh, beyond that they are told to speak in tongues as children!!!  Children cannot discern the spirits generally speaking, they are a lot more susceptable to demonic manifestations or just faking it because they haven't been taught how to discern what is and what isn't God by studying scriptures.This lack of spiritual discernment is shown on both sides, the liberal radio host misquotes scripture and is on the other side of the extrem.  This gives me the impression that the director was trying to let people decide for themselves whether or not either of these people are ""right"".  Well, there is only one way to decide what is right and that is by the Bible, I can believe something as much as I want as these people obviously do, but it does not make it right!I became very entrenched in practices such as breaking things in the physical to break them in the heavenlies, but then realized this is NOWHERE in the Bible, and reclaiming territory, where, in the context of scripture is this in the Bible?  I give this movie  credit because it shows how easy it is to build false belief's when you take scripture out of context, and exactly how important it is to study God's word everyday and to test and weigh everything that people tell you when it comes to God and spirituality.Now, I read some reviews on netflix stating that true is tolerant; I don't believe God ever tells us to ""tolerate"" anyone.  The dictionary states this as the first definition of tolerance ""to allow the existence, presence, practice, or act of without prohibition or hindrance; permit.""  So, I guess in terms of that definition this is true, but usually what I have found people to mean by tolerance means not vocalizing at all that they believe something is wrong based on the Bible.  God never forces us to yeild to him, nor does he force us into anything, he gives the information and with that information the right to choose what we want.  In that way Christians are to be the same way.  We should not say that sin is okay, but at the same time, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves (which love also involves being honest about what is and what isn't sin based on scripture by the way) and to treat people as we want to be treated.In terms of the actual film, I liked the objectivity of it personally because I have tested these kinds of practices and found that they are not scriptural.  I am just not sure that someone who isn't a Christian or a Christian with good discernment will really understand what is going on.  I am glad this movie was made, I just pray that the non-Christians who may write off Christians because of this film would research true Christianity and not listen to what liberals or charismatics say, but rather really seek the understand what the Bible says.In the end, I think this film drives home the point, that we do need to give children the ability to choose Christ and to search things out for themselves and by giving them clear moral guidance, but also giving them the ability to choose for themselves, they can really become a true follower of Christ.One last note, the comment by the one girl with the short hair who claims that churches who sing songs without jumping and shouting are not of God...?  That isn't true.  Worship is a lifestyle, it is me being a liing sacrifice to God by choosing to be obedient to him.  I am can praise God on my own time or in a church setting, but it doesn't make me any more or less holy for it;  The Bible says to pray continually and praise continually (1 Thessalonians 5)...  It is very true that some church who are ""dead"" in their ""worship music"" might be dead indeed, but that may not be true.  I have found that the most ecstatic worshippers were those who were the least well-versed in scriptures because they lived from one emotional high to the next.  it took me a long to learn that it didn't matter if I ""felt"" things while I sang worship songs, its just singing and I may feel something and I may not.  I am not undermining the importance of audibly praising God, but it is important to remember that we need to honor God by knowing who he REALLY IS by studying his word and praying!!!  That is the only way to keep yourself from being decieved by such things as this.  I thank God I went from hallucinating to make myself feel something to realize that God is everywhere and by being born again, I have the Holy Spirit which allows me to have the presence of God always, its not something I have to fight for as long as I am pursuing God through his word and in prayer.God Bless ~Amy",4,An objective viewpoint of extreme modern charismatics...,1238889600,"04 5,

I hesitated because I knew, just from the cover, that it would be a disturbing, one-sided look at a small group of Christians who indoctrinate their children.  It was indeed excruciating to look at the confused, innocent faces of children listening to sermons that would be perfectly fine for adults, but really will mess these kids up for life.  I wanted to take the kids and run like H. as soon as Ms. Fischer said that in Jesus' time, Harry Potter would have been put to death, and that kids had to suffer and ""cook in the pot"" of this painful Christian camp.  There is NO WAY these kids understand this dogmatic doctrine.  They only want to please their family and grownups.  I only pray that when they become adults, they do not jettison their faith as a whole.The documentary could have been a lot shorter.  It makes the point early on, and does not develop, grow, or give the viewer any new information.One thing is for sure.  I am Christian.  These people do not represent my Jesus.  Our church VBS is age-appropriate and invites children to join a church family and explore the Bible and Jesus' love.  We do not browbeat.A final note.  I live in ""suburban-rural mid-America.""

1035266,A18AYRYL1TY8VP,B000KLQUV2,LuelCanyon,"[3, 4]","A shocking, thoroughly irregular, well-made film that fully exhibits the ravages of evangelical practice in America, cultic obsession embodied in a well-strategized assault on the spiritual innocence of children that is so abusive it begs the question ""is this actually happening in America?"" Absolutely unfathomable. As one evangelical mother says in the film ""there are two kinds of people in this world - those who love Jesus and those who don't"". Sound familiar? With us or against us. Yes, Haggard is creepsville (and hilarious, given his recent delicate revelations), and the scene with the children raising en masse a Reich arm of ""blessing"" toward a large cardboard statue of Bush is pure Orwellian theatre that chills to the bone. These poor children already lost to the madness of a few, the manipulation of their innocent emotional lives, their spontaneous weeping and gushing in the face of fevered verbal onslaught by the ""leaders"", the idiotic terror of glossolalia, the threats and coercion, and a palette of concoctions of death and dishonor that wait upon each child's next breath like a living demon - these things are intolerable. But truly scabrous is Becky Fisher, vicious ""leader"" of the camp, Children's Ministry expert (!), in the grip of mental illness, no one supervising her interior fantasy life, and certainly no one safeguarding the children on whom she visits huge wicked things. A big fat woman, she preaches how no child these days is willing to fast for God. There are a number of moments in the film that are laugh out loud, but the sorrow of its content, honestly, is a wound difficult to bear. To live in a nation that acquiesces to this kind of ignorance is burdensome; necessary, no doubt, as antidote, but a true sorrow for anyone with heart for the America we knew. Jesus Camp spotlights an American taliban tribe on the march, delusional warrior dogs at fever-pitch, crazy-eyed - possessed, really. Yes, everything for God except love. A tragedy in one act.

It's an especially good film for students who have read anti-utopias like 1984 and, in particular, The Handmaid's Tale. (Think of Orwell's Parsons children, spies and warriors for Big Brother, or Atwood's Aunt Lydia, who turns young women into handmaids to serve the reproduction needs of the state.)  You might want to ask students whether they think the film is really as neutral as some commentators have suggested. Particularly interesting is the way the camera always pans around the interior of houses (generally with a shot of the  family dog) and what this suggests about socio-economic status.

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[21, 24]","Letting the camera do the talking with no intrusive commentary, the director focuses on the shrill Becky Fischer, who sublimates her lifelong loneliness by obsessing over ""training"" children to fight the devil and to lead her interpretation of a Christian life. Her preaching is primitive, paranoid, lugubrious, and clearly an attempt to compensate for her loneliness and general fearfulness. We also see the children and their families who follow this tongue-speaking charismatic sect.One of the most striking things about this film is that there is no love, only fear and the desperate need for belonging, which translates into people surrendering to the most primitive dramas as a sort of rite of passage. Self-aggrandizing tears to show their piety is their weekly drama in the church or the Bible lessons. The people portrayed are myopic in their beliefs, tribalistic, full of pent-up anger and hostility and in many ways remind me of characters in Gothic horror films. Adding to the Gothic feel are the retreat scenes at Devil's Lake that take place in the dark rain and in the night-time cabins as the kids, shedding their Christian robes, tell ghost stories and share their candid love for the forbidden, ""demonic"" Harry Potter novels. There is a sense of claustrophobia throughout this film as the parents suffocate their children with indoctrination.I can only hope this is a fringe expression of Christian faith.

1035273,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B000KLQUV2,"MK ""Hussar""","[9, 15]","One of the principal techniques of human existence is disarmingly simple and can be summed up in this axiom:  before you destroy your enemy, you must dehumanize your enemy.  A salve is applied to the human conscience if one can visualize one's opponent as evil, inhuman, dangerous, or just plain wrong.  Hesitation enters the game, however, if you realize that perhaps your opponents are sincere in their beliefs.  Can you really belittle, despise, and dismiss the beliefs of someone with a differing viewpoint if you know that they came to their conclusion via--in their view--honest and valid methods?  The makers of this riveting look into the universe of fundamentalist Christianity seem to accomplish just that:  we are able to grasp the true sincerity present in the aims of these pastors who ""indoctrinate"" children, while also understanding the opposing opinion--that perhaps these techniques, however sincere they are in their goal of bringing people to Christ, are yet profoundly wrong.""Jesus Camp (JC),"" a documentary following the journey of evangelical minister Becky Fischer and her flock, is an amazingly impartial analysis that sheds light on a growing movement flowering in America which seeks to turn young Christians into ""born-again"" believers forsworn to the literal Bible truth.  Through the lenses of our chaperones' (directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady) cameras, the viewer is taken on a tour into the fundamentalist Christian movement.  We are introduced to several of the congregation in Lee's Summit, a hamlet proximal to Kansas City, where we find Ms. Fischer preaching to her congregation about the evils inherent in complacency.  She urges the parents and children in her place of worship to attend ""Jesus Camp,"" a workshop of sorts meant to amplify the teachings of Christ.  This camp, located in the rather inauspiciously-entitled Devil's Lake region of North Dakota, is a place where children, parents, and pastors can congregate in a meeting place free from distraction.Prior to the congregation's pilgrimage, Ewing and Co. allow us a brief glimpse into the home life of one of the children.  This child, befitted with an engaging smile, ""rattail"" haircut, and somewhat-unsure demeanor, lectures the audience, via forced ""discussion"" with his mother, that the impact of man's contribution to global warming is unproven, because, to paraphrase, ""...well, an increase of 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit in one-hundred years is like, pretty much nothing.""  Before this, the child was viewing a fundamentalist-leaning ""instructional"" videotape, entitled ""Creation Adventure,"" in which the host and narrator expresses amazement that anyone could believe humans come from ""goo.""Scattered throughout the film, in typical documentary fashion, we witness interviews with one or more personalities.  We witness one rather disturbing interview with the pastor revealing her desire to create levels of belief in her congregation to match the perceived fervor found in young Islamic fundamentalists.  She reveals a brilliant understanding of the nature of belief--that the earlier a belief achieves concrete form in one's mind, the more strongly that belief will be held.  Throughout the film, several snippets from her monologues and sermons illustrate several of Ms. Fischer's deeply-held opinions:1.  That fundamentalist Christians have the right to proselytize because the world requires a counter-force to radical Islam.2.  That fundamentalist Christians have the right to aggressively proclaim their views because, to paraphrase the pastor, ""...because, well, excuse me!  We are the ones who have the correct Biblical interpretation, after all!""3.  The fundamentalist Christian's duty is to reach as many minds as early as possible to counter the Devil's power in this materialistic world.4.  Separation of church and state is an unsuccessful and doomed enterprise which must come to an end; thus, she and fellow pastors encourage her students to pursue public office, with Christian precepts firmly in mind.Arriving at Devil's Lake, Becky and her assistant ministers pray over the electronic equipment, seeking to preemptively expel the Devil and thus prevent diabolical interference.  During the opening sermon, she lambastes the children for their inconsistency:  how can they nod at the teachings of Jesus in church, yet also reject Him in the home and in school with their embrace of mainstream music, books, and movies?  Harry Potter, the wizardly protagonist of J. K. Rowling's series of books, is a ""warlock"" and thus, is in direct opposition to the teachings of Christ, Fischer proclaims.  She speaks of the importance of activism, and urges the children to apply Christian dogma to all aspects of their lives, not just in the house of God.  A cardboard effigy of George W. Bush is brought before the children, and they are encouraged to bless the President and pray that he puts America on the path to Christ.  Children cry and wail as they are told they hold sin inside themselves; nevertheless, they quickly convert to a state of rapture when instructed to allow Jesus into their hearts, as they begin ""speaking in tongues,"" ""collapsing with Christ,"" and producing more tears, only now in jubilation.  One little girl, complete with pressured speech, wide-eyed enthusiasm, and multiple ""umm's,"" details her joy at allowing Jesus into her life and her dedication to teaching others in His name.  The viewer wonders how this little girl's thoughts could possibly come from internal contemplation, so immersed in religious doctrine they plainly are.A recurring viewpoint, voiced by liberal Christian radio-host Mike Papantonio, raises the disturbing idea that these pastors are actively engaged in the brainwashing of America's youth.  Throughout the film, Mike cautions listeners to understand the real importance of separation of church and state, to see that some techniques of fundamentalist ministers are three parts indoctrination and one part life-enhancing, and to realize that America stands in danger of becoming a theocracy.  The film closes with a debate between Mike and Becky on the air, as they argue the consequences of religiously-guided politics, the advantages and pitfalls of early indoctrination of young minds with beliefs regarding ultimate truths, and the future of religion in America.As this is a documentary, the maker's of this film deserve great praise for their flawless maintenance of an objective slant.  This film allowed me to hear the very real sincerity in Ms. Fisher's voice.  Her beliefs, which brook no compromise on what makes one ""damned"" versus what does not, allow room for the deep compassion she truly feels towards those who die without being ""saved.""  Similarly, Mr. Papantonio speaks his mind with passion and verve, begging Americans to see the inherent danger in an even partially-religious American government.  What to do with two equally-sincere and absolutely-opposed opinions?  Is tolerance even possible, or is someone, regardless of sincerity, still absolutely wrong?  In the extremely polarized environment of religious opinion, representing two positions without bias is a vanishingly-rare accomplishment, and renders this movie a ""must-see"" for any student of religion, indoctrination methods, political maneuverings, or the ""American culture wars (an altogether overused, and eyeball-rolling phrase).""",5,"""Jesus Camp"" invites viewers to decide for

The adults in this film brainwashed and indoctrinated into several disturbing beliefs. First of all, they regarded George Bush as a sort of saviour, an ideal of morality. They taught creationism and discretited in its entirety the idea of global warning. The furthered the views of a political party, of Bush, of not believing in global warming and of other things that have to do nothing with religion. They are, in fact exploiting how innocent and gullible these children are and I found it deeply disturbing. Should children be made to suffer so much? They had children stand in front of the Capitol (?), in the cold, with red tape across their mouths (which had ""Life"" written on it). This is exploitation.The documentary is very well made, the people in it and their actions speak for themselves. The makers of the documentary do not try to interject to express their own views. They do present, albeit very briefly, the ideas of a moderate radio host which presents a good balance to the film.This is something everyone needs to see. It is eye-opening and terribly frightening.

1035276,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,B000KLQUV2,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[14, 16]","The true strength of the documentary genre, as far as I have ever seen, is to bring to light the complications and difficulties of its subject matter.  Though the best documentaries have a feel of being a rather natural flow of clips, as though the filmmaker simply turned on the camera and got these gems, in reality, a good documentary is a thorough and extensive process, taking an extraordinary amount of footage to distill itself into a cohesive film.  What helps inspire that cohesiveness is that the filmmaker looks to examine the subject matter rather than judge it or decide on its merit or meaning.  An expert documentary maker is out to reveal the full range of his or her subject matter, using both what may make it look good as well as its problems.Ultimately, this is where Michael Moore fails as a documentary maker.  His main message is too clear, and he clearly edits out what doesn't agree with his point in the end product.  Morgan Spurlock didn't do as good a job with _Supersize Me_, which addressed more of the problems with fast food than the problems of a man committing himself in such a way to fast food, but I think his abilities came through more potently in the series _30 Days_, where people were transplanted from their familiar worlds to unfamiliar ones for a month.  These people may have come out changed, but not always transformed, for their original beliefs were not necessarily 'bad' ones that needed to be rooted out, but simply different from the beliefs they were usually immersed into during the course of each episode._Jesus Camp_ does seem to smack just slightly of predetermination, of filmmakers who are a little shocked at their subject matter when they insert a kind of deathly drone during the ceremonies at the camp, where children are verbally morified into believing themselves untrue Christians if there is any disparity between their behavior and prostelitizing at church and their attitude with their friends, or when a cardboard cut-out of George W. Bush is prayed for and has hands laid upon it by weeping children crying out for the end of abortion in a scene that screams of idolatry.  It may be hard for Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady NOT to be a little disturbed when children are being used in anti-abortion/pro-life protests, or to pray against the wall of a Planned Parenthood building, but perhaps the filmmakers are to be given enormous credit for NOT getting all Michael Moore on the film and are able to present these aspects of the Becky Fisher children's ministry as an honest part of the mission.  There are some wonderful clips of Fisher herself as she relates her devotement and the apparent earnestness of her work, though I must admit that I remained somewhat dismayed as she legitimized her efforts as counterbalancing the supposed brainwashing of 'our enemies' (presumedly Muslims, though this word only ever seems to come up once, and that from a prostelitizing child who wonders aloud about the three black people who did not seem to take too kindly to her approach).Actually, a wonderful LACK of counterbalance comes from clips involving a radio talk show host named Mike Papantonio.  If Papantonio is being offered as the voice of reason, his clips in the end come across as very stale and bland, while the members of Fisher's pastorage seem (at the very least) to show a passion for their belief.This last point seems to be the true fodder for any legitimate, objective view of the evangelical movement--the passion that this movement seems to engender.  Remove the lack of true faith, which has been replaced by dogmatic certainty, and remove the unwavering self-righteousness, and what becomes the most intriguing apsect of evangelicism, and what is possibly the true subject matter of this film, is passion.  The filmmakers, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, do a wonderful job focusing on Rachael and Levi, two children who seem to have an unwavering passion for their faith.  Much like the documentary _Hell House_, _Jesus Camp_ presents to us some true believers of evangelicism, and whether we are a little nauseated by their presence, or a little in awe of the depth of their belief, perhaps there is a nugget of truth in the insistence throughout the movie that these children are indeed the future.  Though they have clearly been indoctrinated by a pastor who seems to talk often out of both sides of her face (at one moment, she insists that these children are not being indoctrinated, yet often calls their activities 'training' and (as I mentioned before) likens their training to being a counter to those whom she says are being brainwashed, and while she insists that the motives of her church are only spiritual and not political, there are the aforementioned prayers on the idol of Bush and the use of children in political protest), perhaps there is hope that the passion of these children can see through any of the garbage that they've been fed (though Fisher seems to rest herself assured that children who are trained in an ideal at 7 or 8 maintain that training for the rest of their lives).In all, a disturbing and troublesome documentary, on a subject matter that can't be dismissed very easily.",4,a documentary in its most impactful sense of the word,1172361600,"02 25,

I found a number of things in this film striking and disturbing. For one, there appears to be a near total lack of male figures in any of these children's lives (whether that is because they are fatherless or the filmmakers choice not to interview fathers is unclear). Another striking element to this film is that if it were not for the fact that this camp is run under a religious guise, many of the things being done to these kids would be considered psychologically abusive. From the perspective of an evangelical, this position is probably laughable. But from anyone not operating from the perspective that the spirit is moving them - or however you might phrase it - what is done to these children and the guilt and shame they are having forced upon them seems nothing short of child abuse. What's troubling to me, personally, is that this film, in trying to expose a part of American life that few outside evangelical circles would know about, also appears to exploit the very children they are (I would imagine) trying to help in some form by exposing what this camp is really about.

1035279,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B000KLQUV2,ninjasuperstar,"[11, 14]","While I generally agree with the politics behind this film, I was not impressed with the presentation of the content.  Most of the movie is filmed with a handheld camera, and the result is something only slightly above a film student's final project.  The zooming and off-center shots were obviously intended to manufacture an effect unnecessarily.  The people in the film are creepy enough by themselves; they don't need any help from heavy-handed visual effects.  There's also some clumsy use of music, but I wasn't nearly as annoyed by the film's overall sound as I was by the visuals.Other reviewers have noted that the film tends to confuse Pentecostals with Evangelicals, but this confusion isn't necessarily inaccurate.  In the last decade, there has been a consolidation of fundamentalists with certain evangelicals, instigated entirely by the Republican Party.  The purpose?  To create an unwavering, neoconservative, political force that is pro-life, pro-death penalty, pro-war, anti-liberal, and so on all in the name of Jesus.  And these newer, crazier, zealots have washed real Republicans away.The fusion of Church and State that this movement desires is exactly the situation they claim to fight against in Iraq, and the same situation that would like to fight against in Iran.  Irony runs thick in this film.  The adults unabashedly desire to control their children's minds.  I thought for sure the main camp leader, Becky Fischer, would at least try to soften her camp's intentions.  But no, she admits that she and the other camp leaders are trying to indoctrinate children, to close them off from the rest of the world, which they regard as trash.Fischer has a point that all other religions likewise indoctrinate children.  I grew up as a Catholic, and I can attest that the old ""Catholic guilt"" is emotionally crippling and that it's residue still lingers and influences my moral life.  That being said, most religions do not intentionally ostracize and isolate their children.  Some of the adults in Jesus Camp home school their kids, for example.  Further, most Christians leave their spiritual guidance to a church leader - priest, minister, deacon, pastor - but not the Pentecostals.  Apparently, anyone can preach with equal authority.  Thus, the parents scrutinize their kids' every move, constantly teaching and preaching, which seems to leave little time for any other kinds of thoughts.The most painful moments of the film occur during the lectures the camp leaders give the kids.  They always start small, using cheesy metaphors, images, and props to whet the kids' interest, and before long, all the lectures make a terrible turn towards angrily praising God.  I don't know how else to describe it.  One moment the kids are listening, perhaps even laughing.  The next moment they are in tears as the mental torture reaches a near Bacchanalian fury.As a documentary, the film is merely okay, but I recommend it if you want to see where the largest political base in America comes from, what they think about, and their bizarre religiosity whose negative political effects that will last a generation.",3,"Fantastic, spooky content but only so-so documentation",1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,3131,"['generally', 'agree', 'politics', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'presentation', 'content', 'Most', 'movie', 'filmed', 'handheld', 'camera', 'result', 'something', 'only', 'slightly', 'film', 'student', 'final', 'project', 'zooming', 'off-center', 'shots', 'were', 'obviously', 'intended', 'manufacture', 'effect', 'unnecessarily', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'creepy', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'help', 'heavy-handed', 'visual', 'effects', 'also', 'clumsy', 'use', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'annoyed', 'film', 'overall', 'sound', 'was', 'visuals.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'confuse', 'Pentecostals', 'Evangelicals', 'confusion', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'inaccurate', 'last', 'decade', 'been', 'consolidation', 'fundamentalists', 'certain', 'evangelicals', 'instigated', 'entirely', 'Republican', 'Party', 'purpose', 'create', 'unwavering', 'neoconservative', 'political', 'force', 'pro-life', 'pro-death', 'penalty', 'pro-war', 'anti-liberal', 'so', 'name', 'Jesus', 'newer', 'crazier', 'zealots', 'have', 'washed', 'real', 'Republicans', 'away.The', 'fusion', 'Church', 'State', 'movement', 'exactly', 'situation', 'claim', 'fight', 'Iraq', 'same', 'situation', 'would', 'like', 'fight', 'Iran', 'Irony', 'thick', 'film', 'adults', 'unabashedly', 'desire', 'control', 'children', 'minds', 'thought', 'sure', 'main', 'camp', 'leader', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'would', 'least', 'try', 'soften', 'camp', 'intentions', 'other', 'camp', 'leaders', 'are', 'trying', 'indoctrinate', 'children', 'close', 'off', 'rest', 'world', 'regard', 'trash.Fischer', 'point', 'other', 'religions', 'likewise', 'indoctrinate', 'children', 'grew', 'up', 'Catholic', 'can', 'attest', 'old', 'Catholic', 'guilt', 'emotionally', 'crippling', 'residue', 'still', 'lingers', 'influences', 'moral', 'life', 'being', 'said', 'most', 'religions', 'do', 'not', 'intentionally', 'ostracize', 'isolate', 'children', 'adults', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'home', 'school', 'kids', 'example', 'Further', 'most', 'Christians', 'leave', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'church', 'leader', 'priest', 'minister', 'deacon', 'pastor', 'not', 'Pentecostals', 'Apparently', 'anyone', 'can', 'preach', 'equal', 'authority', 'Thus', 'parents', 'scrutinize', 'kids', 'move', 'constantly', 'teaching', 'preaching', 'leave', 'little', 'time', 'other', 'kinds', 'thoughts.The', 'most', 'painful', 'moments', 'film', 'occur', 'lectures', 'camp', 'leaders', 'give', 'kids', 'always', 'start', 'small', 'using', 'cheesy', 'metaphors', 'images', 'props', 'whet', 'kids', 'interest', 'long', 'lectures', 'make', 'terrible', 'turn', 'towards', 'angrily', 'praising', 'God', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'describe', 'One', 'moment', 'kids', 'are', 'listening', 'perhaps', 'even', 'laughing', 'next', 'moment', 'are', 'tears', 'mental', 'torture', 'near', 'Bacchanalian', 'fury.As', 'documentary', 'film', 'merely', 'okay', 'recommend', 'want', 'see', 'where', 'largest', 'political', 'base', 'America', 'what', 'think', 'bizarre', 'religiosity', 'negative', 'political', 'effects', 'will', 'last', 'generation']",Jesus Camp

Believers in God's perfect will are advocating a culture war to reclaim America for Christ. These mean spirited holy warriors make no qualms about wanting to take over our country from those sin practicing liberal minded free thinkers. Within minutes we become aware of an all to real powerful force in our own back yard that will stoop as low as humanly possible and stop at nothing to steal democracy from us like a thief in the night.Becky is the first one we meet, as she angrily barks her sermon to her captive group of brain washed children about how this world is sick and we need to break out the tools to fix it. Amazingly hypocritical, in that she is built like a hippo herself, she builds the children's urgency and their youthful purpose by shouting ""We have too many Christian grown ups that are fat and lazy and don't want to give up a meal!"" At the end of her gross sermon the children are encouraged to speak in tongues under fat Becky's guidance.Smartly directed by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, the movie shifts back and forth between the grown up abusers, and the poor impressionable child victoms themselves. Since any viewer with a shread of reality left in their bones would feel hopelessly crushed under the weight of all the vulgar desplays of adverse behavior, and bombardment of sick fundamentalism, the directors spare us time to time by letting us sit in on writer and attorney Mike Papantonio's on air radio show. He becomes the conscious of the film since it is all too clear that the evangelical adults don't have any conscious left and are actively smashing what little conscious remains in their darling little warriors. He is the very voice of sanity that asks the questions that any responsible adult should be asking, like "" Why do you indoctronate children and interfere with their ability to learn and decide for themselves? Don't you realize that you are damaging the progression of mankind?""He also asks the questions that any responsible Christian that honors America should be asking themselves. "" How do we ignor that we are creating children warriors for the republican party? How does that figure in, in any way, with how Christ said we should live our lives on Earth?""During the course of the film we get to know two of the child warriors pretty well, they are Rachel, and Levi. 12 year old Levi is being raised to become a preacher of the holy word himself. There is a shot of him rehearsing his first ever sermon, a sermon he claims that God really wrote through him. It contains all the familiar elements that he has heard his whole life, like "" God is all powerful and good and needs to rule everything"", and "" Satan is wicked and needs to be watched"". His sermon is for his fellow youths so he encourages them to "" Rise up and take action by running with the baton!"" He has also been home schooled along with his little brother who early in this picture sadly claims that Galileo made the right choice when he gave up science for Christ. For those of you that are not hip as to why Galileo chose to do this, it was because in 1610 he made the discovery that the Earth revolved around The Sun. The Catholic Church didn't like his theory that man was not the center of the universe so they sent the Holy Inquisition to go and correct said theory. Not to be outdone in science bashing, Levi tells his parental unit teacher, that he would not mind going to a public school in which the teacher taught that evolution is stupid, and so are the people who believe in it. Meanwhile he is learning the lesson that global warming is not real, that it is just a political tool used by the enemy party against God's chosen political party. You see, when people actually believe that The Rapture is real and it is going to happen at some point during their lifetime, it makes The Earth's natural resources, and the environment completely expendable. After all, Jesus is already on his way so it doesn't matter. I am not making any of this up, it's an actual fact that 45% of American's believe that The Rapture is going to happen in their lifetime...Where's Becky's fat and lazy speach when we need it?Just as heartbreaking sad is ten year old Rachel who is shown actually asking God to bless her bowling ball before every toss down the lane.  Next she approaches a hot young blonde chick of around 20 or so, sitting at one of the adjacent lanes. Rachel tells this blonde lady that God is thinking about her and she just wanted her to know that. Once back with her family, the grown ups gather around to congratulate her efforts to save a soul glowingly. Later Rachel vacuously tells the camera about the types of churches God likes to go to. They are not the ones in which people prey quietly with no passion, because those are ""dead"" churches. Then she talks about her desire to run a hair salon, so that her relaxed clients will be more receptive to the Christian music and soul saving she plans to administer along with the hair treatment. All I can think of, is how amazingly warped poor little Rachel really is. Don't most children wish they could be firemen and movie stars? But under the guiding hands of creatures like fat Becky, Rachel and her minion of fellow brain washed future leaders have no hopes of ever becoming normal kids.""J.C. In the house!""At the Jesus Camp its self, Becky goes around and does something that goes beyond mere stupidity. She blesses the seats, the electricity, the electrical equipment, video projectors, power points, presentations, and microphones, all in the blood of Christ...Christians sure do love their blood...Then during the presentation to the captive kiddies, she condemns that evil monster Harry Potter for being a warlock."" He would be put to death by past Christians!"" she spats hatefully.In the pause that fallows a single childs voice can be heard shouting an ""AMEN!"" Fallowed by complete fellowship applause for that lovely morally righteous comment. Meanwhile the PA plays Christian rap, heavy metal, and rock, along with the appropriate subliminal atmospheric stuff at the most effective moments of the mind numbing sermon. This includes some lady who moans her spirit ladened head off into a hand held microphone...And what in the world is some Australian Preacher doing telling American children that they have to replace the morally corrupt government officails with righteous ones? Meanwhile, Fat Becky makes references about MacDonald drive through windows, ( which I am sure she knows all about ) and tells the now tear stained children to do as The Apostle Paul said and take the scriptures and make WAR with them.There are a couple of telling moments that fallow, in which a few of the children actually say something human despite all the brain washing. The first is when a little boy tells the adults that he sometimes feels that God really isn't there listening to him pray, and that he wonders if The Bible is actually the writen word of God or simply something writen by people. He is given a book and forced to go sit by himself outside and read it. The other moment is when a group of boys are sitting around a table with Levi. One of the boys says that his mother will not let him watch Harry Potter because it has witch craft in it, but he watches it anyway when he goes over his dads house. This is fallowed by an amazing look of shear stunned shock on the faces of all the other boys. Had this scene been played with no audio, a person watching it might have been convinced by the looks on the other boys faces that he just told them that he was in love with fat Becky.Now unlike Mike Papantonio, I do not share America's one nation under God beliefs. In fact, I don't believe that Jesus Christ even existed at all. I am for all practical purposes, a card carrying atheist, but that is alright, that is peachy creamy. What is not alright, is that there is a group that actively messes with the lives of other people. They don't want anyone in this world to even have thoughts that are different then their own. They are building an army of foot soldiers to eradicate the seperation of church and state, and they have already achieved a strangle hold on many of the government and media bodies that rule this country. Yet on the other side, us rational people are just not like them. We still believe in being courteous and respectful of the boundaries of our fellow humans. We still listen to what others have to say and try not to hurt their feelings. Basically, we are asleep at the wheel because we actually believe and practice decency and kindness. Sadly, this will not do anymore, because their side practices agression, and their side has declaired total genocide on us. That is why I refuse to find an easy escape the next time I am approached by a soul saver. Unlike that blonde girl in the bowling alley who acted all sweet and courteos to Rachel, I would of told that little girl exactly why I don't believe in God, and if I have to I will get into an unholy discussion with her entire gang. I will refuse to back down or walk away, because I plan to keep my personal freedom intact.Jesus Camp should be shown to everyone who is of voting age, it is a five star must own film because it lets us know that we are indeed under attack and have to actually act like we are under attack. Jesus Camp is the scariest film I have seen since The Exorcist blessed cinema's around the world on boxing day 1973, because it shows that not only is God dead, but so too is kindness.",5,The scariest

Jesus Camp follows children who will be attending an evangelical summer camp in North Dakota. You learn about their perspectives of faith and their family lives and also get to experience the camp with them. They adults in this documentary us their children as weapons in a war against abortion at one point dragging them to D.C. to protest.  Perhaps the most disturbing part of the documentary is a scene where the camp leader, Becky, asks the kids to come up and confess their sins. One young boy, who is not in the main cast, comes up and tells the crowd that sometimes he doesn't believe in god and then breaks down in tears because he has been told his entire life that it is a sin and you will go to hell if you do not believe in god.

1035287,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B000KLQUV2,Publius,"[8, 13]","All organized religion is essentially about power and control.  In this disturbing documentary about the Pentecostal youth movement, control and power are there for all the see with disturbing results.  It is apparent early on in the film that Pastor Becky Fischers' preaching is not meant to be for the glorification of God, but rather for the glorification of her own ego.  A telling scene that demonstrates this is where Ms. Fischer asks the kids about how good her hair and her nails look right before a sermon.  Several reviewers on this website in particular feel that Fischer in sincere in her belief, but after watching a scene like that, it is hard to fathom why one could think that.  Earlier in the film, Fischer says that Muslim youth in Palestine are being trained to become soldiers in the army of God and are being taught how to strap bombs across their waists.  I guess Ms. Fischer's vision then is that these same children in her camp will be blowing themselves up at Planned Parenthood and Abortion Clinics throughout the country.  What a profound vision of a Christian worldview of faith, love and charity.However, this documentary does not alarm me as it has done most critics of this film, because most of these children will realize sooner rather then later that they were being unjustly manipulated.  Those children now will possibly look back on this film in 2016 and laugh and realize the extent of these adults influence over them.  Ted Haggard alone has probably done more to discredit this movement with his admission of dalliances with gay male prostitutes, and that's in 2006.  Several people have a difficult time understanding that these people are not given toleration in America.  Well, toleration should be granted to all beliefs in America, but not to systems that manipulate children and encourage them to be soldiers of God in the mold of Islamic jihadists.  Those kinds of beliefs should be invalidated for what they are: dangerous, false and ultimately delusional.",5,Delusional,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2004,"['organized', 'religion', 'essentially', 'power', 'control', 'disturbing', 'documentary', 'Pentecostal', 'youth', 'movement', 'control', 'power', 'are', 'there', 'see', 'disturbing', 'results', 'apparent', 'early', 'film', 'Pastor', 'Becky', 'Fischers', 'preaching', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'glorification', 'God', 'rather', 'glorification', 'own', 'ego', 'telling', 'scene', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Fischer', 'kids', 'how', 'good', 'hair', 'nails', 'look', 'right', 'sermon', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'website', 'particular', 'feel', 'Fischer', 'sincere', 'belief', 'watching', 'scene', 'hard', 'fathom', 'why', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'Earlier', 'film', 'Fischer', 'Muslim', 'youth', 'Palestine', 'are', 'being', 'trained', 'become', 'soldiers', 'army', 'God', 'are', 'being', 'taught', 'how', 'strap', 'bombs', 'waists', 'guess', 'Ms.', 'Fischer', 'vision', 'then', 'same', 'children', 'camp', 'will', 'be', 'blowing', 'up', 'Planned', 'Parenthood', 'Abortion', 'Clinics', 'country', 'What', 'profound', 'vision', 'Christian', 'worldview', 'faith', 'love', 'charity.However', 'documentary', 'not', 'alarm', 'done', 'most', 'critics', 'film', 'most', 'children', 'will', 'realize', 'sooner', 'rather', 'then', 'later', 'were', 'being', 'unjustly', 'manipulated', 'children', 'now', 'will', 'possibly', 'look', 'back', 'film', '2016', 'laugh', 'realize', 'extent', 'adults', 'influence', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'alone', 'probably', 'done', 'more', 'discredit', 'movement', 'admission', 'dalliances', 'gay', 'male', 'prostitutes', '2006', 'Several', 'people', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'understanding', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'toleration', 'America', 'Well', 'toleration', 'should', 'be', 'granted', 'beliefs', 'America', 'not', 'systems', 'manipulate', 'children', 'encourage', 'be', 'soldiers', 'God', 'mold', 'Islamic', 'jihadists', 'kinds', 'beliefs', 'should', 'be', 'invalidated', 'what', 'are', 'dangerous', 'false', 'ultimately', 'delusional']",Jesus Camp

1035290,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,B000KLQUV2,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[2, 3]","It's very hard to describe my feelings toward ""Jesus Camp"". Directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady have presented a film unique in its non-judgmental view of a very scary subject. I seriously believe that children should believe in and be passionate about the world at large. What a wonderful and exciting thing it is to be ""growing up"". The blame always goes to the parents, whether negligent or over-protective (or over-influential) to the development of these fresh, inquisitive minds. The film centers around the ideas of evangelist Becky Fischer, a nice lady who believes that Jesus Christ is her Saviour. Her passion is unfettered, and has few bounds. She's not a bad person; rather, ""too good"". It's frightening, then, to know that some kids are ""enticed"" into the business that's going on. The kids interviewed are bright, intuitive and totally taken in by the belief that is forced upon them at an early age.  Kids love attention, because that's their job. It's what they live for. These fresh minds are fodder for religious nuts or dope dealers. (Or a good music or art teacher...) I believe it is all in the hands of the guidance they get at home, and the values instilled in them; with that, they'll be fine. Just because you played piano, doesn't mean you kid has the same ability. Just because you are smart, it doesn't mean your kid is as smart. Just because you love Jesus with an unnatural passion, it doesn't mean it's what your child is destined to do. Narrow-mindedly directing your kids at an early age can, I'm sure, do irreparable harm later on. I truly believe that. (Isn't that what the Taliban does?).The real clincher in ""Jesus Camp"" is the apearance of Rev. Ted Haggard before his disgrace. This smug, arrogant jerk should never be around children, even before we found out he was a pervert. Decide for yourself.

1035293,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000KLQUV2,Robert Moore,"[93, 111]","We live in the Golden Age of the movie documentary.  While mainstream fictional movies have for a decade been in an ongoing creative and qualitative slump (in fact, if you want great fictional visual narrative, television far surpasses film both in excellence and in intelligence), we have witnessed an explosion in high quality movie documentaries.  Part of the reason is certainly technological.  Until relatively recently documentary filmmakers were forced to work either with extremely expensive film cameras or low quality video cameras.  With the advent of compact high-quality digital cameras, however, any documentarian can product extremely good looking footage that looks great even when blown up to the size of a movie theater screen.  The field no longer belongs exclusively to geniuses like Errol Morris but to anyone with a good idea and a camera.I give this five stars and it deserves this, but I want to stress that this film really is a very limited glimpse into contemporary evangelicalism.  The people in this film are not merely evangelicals, but Pentecostals.  They actually are quite different from most evangelicals and especially, for instance, Southern Baptists.  How?  First, Pentecostalism is very much based in emotionalism and feeling and far less in Biblical teachings.  This is apparent from watching JESUS CAMP.  If one is a student of the Bible one will be stunned at how little the Bible is mentioned by the people in the film and what a small role it plays in their religious experience.  In fact, at one point a young girl mocks what she imagines to be the worship experience in a mainstream church, where they sing three hymns and listen to a sermon.  But in many of those churches what one hears in the sermon is a careful exegesis of passages of Scripture.  Few or no Southern Baptist churches feature the emotionalism found by the kids in JESUS CAMP.  This is important to keep in mind since Southern Baptists absolutely dominate the Religious Right in America.The second thing I want to mention is that the film does not show the way that evangelicalism has begun to fragment in the United States.  There are at least three major issues evangelicals are currently splitting over nationally, with promise of many more.  First and so far foremost, the environment.  Many evangelicals simply cannot accept the absurdity that global warming is not taking place and is not caused by human activity.  Even some major figures within the upper echelon of the Religious Right power structure are fragmenting on this issue.  Pat Robertson himself has announced that he now believes both that global warming is real and humans cause it.  As the mountain of evidence pointing to the reality of global warming is building into a mountain range, more and more evangelicals are accepting the obvious.  And with many passages in the Bible speaking of the need to be faithful stewards of the earth and not its exploiters, the pro-environment segment of the evangelical movement is apt to gain more and more traction.  Second, although the Religious Right has a near obsession with abortion, the brute fact is that the Bible does not address the issue directly a single time (despite the fact that there were abortive procedures practiced at the time, as John M. Riddle has documented in his excellent book EVE'S HERBS: A HISTORY OF CONTRACEPTION AND ABORTION IN THE WEST).  On the other hand, the Bible in general and the New Testament especially speaks incessantly about caring for the poor.  Because much of the Religious Right embraces an obsession with the acquisition of material goods, which clashes strongly with everything we see in the New Testament, this has engenders a reaction from many evangelical leaders who feel that Christians are called to both eschew wanton consumerism and to help care for those who lack the basic physical necessities.  Thirdly, evangelicals are splitting, like most of the rest of American already has, over Iraq and George Bush.  If in this film Bush is presented as an object of almost religious adoration, many evangelicals have come to see Iraq as a hideous mistake and many others are troubled by the way Republican political policies have favored the wealthy at the expense of both the middle classes and the poor.Nonetheless, this is a vivid portrait of Pentecostal evangelicalism in the United States.  As stated in the film evangelicals make up 25% of the electorate.  I do not know what percentage Pentecostals make up of evangelicals, but I would be surprised if it was as much as a third.  It is probably much less.  Most evangelicals most assuredly do not speak in tongues.  Still, they do share many beliefs with many other evangelicals, such as the ahistorical belief that America was founded as a Christian nation and that somehow Jesus has been removed from American life (whereas in fact at the time of the ratification of the constitution the Founders intentionally began the preamble with no mention of God but instead stated that the nation was founded by ""We, the People""--also, hundreds of Christians and ministers denounced the ""Godless"" constitution at the time of ratification and afterward for nearly two centuries, until evangelicals beginning in the 1980s began formulating the myth of the founding of the United States as a Christian nation, an idea that would have shocked all the Founders, but in particular the primary architect of the Constitution, the avid supporter of Church-state separation, James Madison).  Most evangelicals are also avidly anti-abortion, though most are unaware that for almost a decade after Roe v. Wade virtually no evangelicals leaders made any public statements about.  In fact, evangelical icon W. A. Criswell actually praised the decision shortly after it was announced, stating that it was simply common sense for a woman to have control of her body (for those who do not know Criswell, one of the members of the evangelical pantheon, he was Billy Graham's pastor).  As Randall Balmer has shown in his marvelous book THY KINGDOM COME, the Religious Right only began to campaign against abortion after the revocation of the tax-exempt status of some religious organizations, a fact that many leaders of the Religious Right are acutely aware (but which fact they certainly do not want to advertise).  And like many evangelicals Pentecostals are suspicious of evolution and science.  So while the film sloughs over some of the truly significant differences between the various kinds of evangelicals, there are a number of themes that run through all.  My only complaint with the film is that you have to already have accumulated a great deal of knowledge about evangelicalism to make these distinctions.The scenes that filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady shot are frequently chilling.  It is obvious that these poor children are being brainwashed and indoctrinated in a manner that is no different than what happens with Islamic extremists.  It is frightening that many of them acknowledge this and do not seem troubled by it.  It breaks your heart viewing the film because these seem like really, really nice kids.  I kept having to fight the sense that what is being done to the poor kids is a form of child abuse.  One scene in particular bugged me.  A really sweet girl walked up to a beautiful blonde girl in a bowling alley with a gospel tract and gave it to her with the words, ""Jesus told me to give this to you.""  Of course Jesus did no such thing (in fact, history is replete with thousands of horrors that various people inflicted on others because they claimed God had told them to).  I was raised in the culture.  I understand the pressures that are placed on children to ""witness"" for Christ and to ""share their testimony.""  As a child I was conscious of how desperately uncomfortable I was with going up to a total stranger and ""telling them about Christ,"" but didn't possess the insight to realize the amount of self-righteousness required to approach someone of whom you know nothing and presume that they lack what you have to give them.  So when watching this poor girl, I couldn't help but think of the horrible things that are parents are doing to her.Unlike some reviewers I did not find Ted Haggard creepy.  Knowing now what we do about him it is all too easy to impart a creepiness that we feel simply had to be there.  I remember something the Catholic devotional writer Henri Nouwen said to me once (for two years Henri hired me to edit, type, and proofread his manuscripts, and also to clean up his English prose--English was his second language and his first drafts often contained infelicities of expression).  The church, he said, is the most sinful place in the world because that is because it is filled with people who acknowledge that they are sinners.  I agree that Ted Haggard's are ironical given his constant attacks on homosexuality, but my own feeling is that most people are afflicted by a host of internal inconsistencies.  In seeing Ted Haggard I was instead struck by how funny and likable he was.  He was witty, friendly, and personable.  And yes, in light of his subsequent downfall (the revelations of his involvement with a gay prostitute and drug use and its apparent confirmation when he resigned from his church broke shortly before the 2006 midterm election and the last in a long string of Republican scandals was viewed as a factor in the Democratic victories) a complete hypocrite.  But I suppose he is no worse than most of us.The lone voice of reason in the film is the trial lawyer and radio journalist Mike Papantonio, who is shown during a broadcast of the ""Ring of Fire"" radio show on Air America, which he cohosts with Robert J. Kennedy Jr.  What I like about Papantonio is that he clearly is as devout as any of the people in the film, but the faith he finds in the New Testament is so completely at odds with those found in the summer camp featured so prominently in the film.  I was so glad he was included in the documentary, if for no other reason than to show that there are Christians who haven't lost their wits.This film really is essential viewing, but as I pointed out above, it is not representative of evangelicalism as a whole.  If one truly wants a balanced view of evangelicalism in America I would recommend two books to supplement this film.  One is Randall Balmer's MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY: A JOURNEY IN THE SUBCULTURE IN AMERICA, which is published by Oxford University Press and was the basis for a PBS documentary.  This will provide a far more comprehensive portrait of contemporary evangelicalism.  I also strongly recommend Rev. Gregory Boyd's THE MYTH OF A CHRISTIAN NATION.  You will find no Christian writer more devout than Boyd and no one who is more careful in the analysis of Scripture.  But as a Bible-believing Christian Boyd comes to very different conclusions than the people found in JESUS CAMP.  But I do not believe that anyone who has actually read the Bible will find their positions closer to the actual content of the Bible and New Testament than Boyd's.  Non-Christians will be impressed that it is possible to combine deep religious devotion with extreme intelligence, resulting in positions that are both Christian and intelligent.",5,Must be seen to

1035294,A2O8FS9MZMBX7C,B000KLQUV2,Rodger Dodger,"[22, 26]","I watched ""Jesus Camp"" with a friend of mine who was raised in this exact culture.  She was so filled with rage throughout the movie.  She kept saying ""That's exactly what it was like."" Interestingly, she too used to break down in tears as the children do in the movie.  The reason she did was because, after the damning sermons, she always felt completely worthless and pathetic.  Jesus loves ya, baby.The problem is that there is an extraordinary amount of wisdom to be gleaned from Christ -  not the worship-demanding, fear-mongering Christ that has been imagined by Christian authorities, but the Christ that preached and manifested love, that rebelled against and was supposedly murdered by an empire not unlike the one these ""good"" Christians are supporting.The question we as a society have to ask is how do we allow these adults their own journeys through a very childlike spiritual understanding (relative to, say, the wisdom manifested by shamans and yogis, for example) while keeping them from using words of love and Christ to mentally and verbally abuse children.There is no rational argument that will stop such church leaders.  Their well-intentioned indoctrination of children borders on, if not surpasses, child abuse in only such a way the DC sniper was able to manipulate his 17 year old companion and North Korea's government is able to brainwash or ostracize in prison camps its entire population.  These church leaders know what they're doing and proudly defend it.  I have known several.  They create a God that needs worship because, subconsciously, they need to be worshipped.  Becky screams ""war!"" at the top of her lungs and believes to her core she is in a war for an America fundamentalists have absurdly re-imagined to be founded as a Christian nation, despite blatant statements by several founding fathers who struggled even in their day to keep the radical Christian sects at bay.  Their search for truth is over.  The only thing left is sectarian violence - be it with guns or words doesn't really matter.The only hope lies in the children as they grow into adolescence.  They may at least understand what this ""abortion"" thing they've been crying about throughout their non-reproductive years really is, that truly being pro-life requires one to also be anti-war, anti death penalty, pro-environment, and even anti-pesticides / pro-organic in the foods they eat that slowly kill them.  That the ""righteous judges"" they were mindlessly screaming for are just the right wing's name for ""activist judges who agree with us"", and that global warming really has nothing to do with either creationism or Jesus.An interesting side note on global warming - scientists have long known that only 1 degree of average temperature change across the globe will have catastrophic impacts on our ecology.  If, as Levi states in the movie, the temperature has increased 0.6 degrees, then we are already 60% of the way there.  Far from the small amount the mother naively brainwashes her child to believe it is.One frequent commentor on this site keeps saying that the deleted scenes show balance.  They just reinforce what the movie lays out.  There is one in which the parents explain that their children are not ""forced"" into this way of thinking, yet every single film they watch, book they read, and activity they do is laden with the propaganda of the radical right wing.I think it would be interesting for the directors to make a ""Jesus Camp: 10 years later"" follow-up.  If I were a betting man, I'd say Levi would be more committed than ever.  He seems to thrive on that structure and attention.  I would think Rachael might pull away, sitting with her head buried in shame and possibly rage at what she was conditioned to say as a 9 year old.  Smart, independent young adults - as she no doubt will become - can break away.Yeah, I know - bad review.

This doc hits close to home, as I have a kind, well-meaning sister who was steered off the cliff and into the abyss of self-imposed psychosis, through the guilt heaped upon her while growing up by these moral zealots. She took up her ""calling"" with an unparrelleled fervor, causing her soul to ache and her mind to be twisted and tormented by the helplessness of not being able to convert all of mankind under heaven to her handed-down, often distorted, beliefs.Altho I have always held a healthy disdain for this new breed of ""Christianity"", (I use the term loosely) I was co-erced into attending a few of these events during my youth, towards the beginning of the movement's inception, during the formative Reagan years and on into the glory days of George H. Sherf II, (known to the blinded masses as the awful cur Bush, Sr.) where I could enivitably hear the bleating of these sheep and the gnashing of young teeth. They were known as ""rallies"", ""youth crusades"" and other such wretched analogies. They consisted of some horrible, smiling, sweating, shouting, son of the devil exciting the young souls into a fevered pitch of spiritual exuberance, then meticulously breaking them down with an unbearable weight of guilt and shame, followed by the ""Altar Call"", whereby these sobbing zombies could head on down to the altar for a little of what I calls ""Man-Made Salvation"". These same despicable beasts could then tout their impressive ""saved soul counts"" to the other arms of the ""ministry"" as proof of the overwhelming good they were accomplishing ""in Jesus' name.""What is so comical about this extremist approach, is that it attempts to keep up with and mirror the various fundmentalist movements from other parts of the world which it is clearly in direct opposition to.It is a poor show to have these same lunatics hovering over ""The Button"" in these tumultuous times. (Altho, I do strongly suspect that those in real power, who milk these mindless zealots for contributions and votes, have little regard at all for the faith they supposedly profess. This comes as a startling realization, I know.) One little error in ""faith-based voting"" is that in the nearly 35 years since the inception of Roe -vs.- Wade, two-thirds of that time will have been spent under Republican ""leadership"" and still no overturned results. Kinda makes you wonder if we're just being duped, eh? Ahhhahhahhahuurrrghhhhh &lt;snort> &lt;chortle> &lt;sob> Well, here's the goods, served up fresh; ehhh... Roe v Wade ain't neva, eva gonna get overturned my brothers and sistahs! That's right! Nevah!! How else are the global elite gonna keep the menace of a nation teeming with poor malcontents under control? You think they want all of us po' folk to be out reproducing like vermin and posing threat to their well-formulated masterplan. No. They will keep enough of us as necessary in order to keep the gears turning in this depraved system, but they need to trim off some of the dead weight, the underperforming dregs, as it were.I would caution anyone who thinks that incidents like those depicted here are isolated, inconsequencial scenarios, to examine the evangelical/prosperity/doomsday movements closer, (as this documentary so aptly does) and recognize the imminent peril all of that entails. Then take a deep breath, shake your head, and recognize that there ain't much left to do but hang on with both hands and enjoy the ride ahead. It'll get a lot worse before it gets any better is the prediction I feel safest with.Extremely well-done and low-key, this documentary is made in the same appealing, old-school manner as such greats as ""Hearts and Minds"", ""Salesman"", and ""Harlan County, U.S.A."", whereby the filmmakers present a compelling, yet virtually un-opinionated picture and the forces of evil are given enough rope to hang themselves.

I guess all totalitarian movements are alike.It was also interesting how religious commitment is so very strictly tied to emotional and physical expressiveness. Crying, reeling, writhing, screaming, babbling - anything physically emotive seems to be very much admired, while silent prayer (or God forbid, meditation), even in a religious context, would seem to be condemned as the way of a ""dead church"". They want your EMOTIONS involved, and that can only be proven to them via your BODY histrionics. Physical hysterics are the coin of the realm to the people in this video, and rightly so, as all that freaking out tends to block rational thought.I suppose the North Korean cult of Kim Jung Il and Kim Il Sung isn't much different in methods and goals.Some of the kids were great. It is interesting that the camp attendee Levi, was apparently evident to BOTH the preacher people AND the documentary makers as a potential telegenic star of some kind, whether a Marjoe Gortner or what we don't yet know. It will be interesting to see.Levi has the distinction of offering the best spontaneous line in the film, at the very end, when he and his fanatic lil friend Rachel are out on the street in DC, targeting sinners for salvation by handing out pamphlets to passers by.Rachel asks Levi:""Is it possible these people think we are SELLING something??""He replies:""Some of them probably think so.""Rachel retorts rhetorically:""But we are just KIDS!

Children who should be out playing and having fun are being brainwashed into becoming ""warriors for Christ"".  It is wrong on so many levels.  Taking every child's dream of being a super hero and twisting it into religious fanaticism-have we learned nothing from the past?The movie shows youngsters writhing on the floor, crying over perceived ""guilt"", speaking in tongues and ready to give up their lives and be martyrs (now where have we heard THAT recently).  Carrying around plastic images of fetuses is not the way to introduce children to the birds and the bees. Red-the color of blood-permeates this scene as children parade around with their little dolls and wallow in perceived goriness. It presents a warped image at the very least.  IF it is the goal of a religion to teach that abortion is wrong (and last time I looked, it is still legal in the US), there are kinder, gentler ways to do so.This film barely stops short of showing adults allegedly training children to overthrow the government as they smash pottery that represents Congress.  Incendiary, brainwashing (Goebbels would be proud) and harmful to fresh, young minds.I have heard that the woman preacher has closed down ""Jesus Camp"" because of fear of further vandalism.  I think her actual motives are somewhat along different, more personal and legal lines.I can foresee years of therapy ahead for some of these youngsters who have had a heavy guilt trip laid upon their innocent shoulders, as their faces redden and tears stream down their cheeks because they have been told they haven't been ""good enough"".

1035298,A3GG91QZH5FQJ4,B000KLQUV2,S.,"[6, 7]","Let me start off by saying that I am a Christian.  I have studied different religions for years.  Every religion has its downfalls, and every religion has its positive influences.  That said, I found ""Jesus Camp"" highly disturbing in a sense that in today's world of being warned about Islamic extremism, we almost fail to recognize the breeding of Christian extremism.Becky Fischer is an Evangelical Christian children's pastor -  a highly charismatic and brilliant woman, who in my opinion uses her brilliance to create fear and hatred.  Again in my opinion, anyone creating fear and hatred in a deliberate manner is a destructive force.  Just because that force is a Christian one does not make the message right.  If Becky Fischer were a Muslim or a Jew, and had the same strength of her message, she would be on top intelligence lists as a threat to international security.It saddened me to see children being brainwashed into believing that everything outside of Evangelism is influenced by Satan.  It saddened me even more to see these same children assume the militant stance of holy warriors.  To paraphrase pastor Fischer, Muslims are creating their holy warriors and so should we.  Two wrongs do not make a right.I really liked that the documentary had no narration from the film makers, who left the final decision to be made by the viewers, based on the footage presented.  You know a topic is powerful when a film with no narration leaves you speechless and deep in thought, as it left me.  Extremism is extremism, whether Islamic, Christian, Jewish or otherwise.

The delusion, arrogance and prejudice that these people assault young minds with - leaving them closed to diversity, to intellectual inquiry - is absolutely shocking. The misinformation and the onslaught of the minds of children who can't begin to understand the complexity of the issues like abortion or evolution, who look to adults for guidance and are taught that anarchy, war-mongering and judgment is the ""righteous"" path.This strand of religion that claims to be Christian preaches only discord, only anger and fear - to say nothing of lauding a president who had, at best, a rudimentary command of his own language and certainly no understanding of anything at all on an intelligent, intellectual level. If it wasn't so completely disturbing, so downright frightening to think that this is what's happening all over the country, you would dismiss it with ridicule.But the fact is that the ""adults"" in this documentary purposefully use and abuse these children with selective preaching by focusing on instilling fear (""the punishment for sin is death - let me see if I have a blood-dripping font...oh yeah, much better""). Some chant you can't understand makes you think about people ""talking in tongues"" because they're possessed (The Exorcist comes to mind). At the same time, you can't escape feeling a chill down your spine as the evangelical minister emphasizes the importance of indoctrinating impressionable children from a young age - a tactic favored by none other than Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany.What's clear from this documentary is that these awful adults misuse childhood insecurities, natural curiosity about the world around us and peer pressure to convince children that the answer to every obstacle, every problem, every question, is god and/or Jesus. But rather than emphasizing positive Christian values such as forgiveness and compassion, the focus is very clearly on creating a barbed-wire line between ""believers"" and anyone who dares question the preachers of what, quite frankly, comes across as mean-spirited, egomaniacal and prejudiced drivel.I'm giving this three stars because the notion of what is in this documentary makes my skin crawl, but it's a powerful warning about what is happening to the children in this country - let down by a dilapidated public school system, misinformed through one-sided homeschooling and unintelligent people grasping for power and money through a veil of Christian belief.",3,"Disturbing, powerful - and absolutely horrifying!",1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2495,"['had', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'documentary', 'delusion', 'arrogance', 'prejudice', 'people', 'assault', 'young', 'minds', 'leaving', 'closed', 'diversity', 'intellectual', 'inquiry', 'absolutely', 'shocking', 'misinformation', 'onslaught', 'minds', 'children', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'understand', 'complexity', 'issues', 'abortion', 'evolution', 'who', 'look', 'adults', 'guidance', 'are', 'taught', 'anarchy', 'war-mongering', 'judgment', 'righteous', 'path.This', 'strand', 'religion', 'be', 'Christian', 'preaches', 'only', 'discord', 'only', 'anger', 'fear', 'say', 'nothing', 'lauding', 'president', 'who', 'had', 'best', 'rudimentary', 'command', 'own', 'language', 'certainly', 'understanding', 'anything', 'intelligent', 'intellectual', 'level', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'completely', 'disturbing', 'so', 'downright', 'frightening', 'think', 'what', 'happening', 'country', 'would', 'dismiss', 'fact', 'adults', 'documentary', 'purposefully', 'use', 'children', 'selective', 'preaching', 'focusing', 'instilling', 'fear', 'punishment', 'sin', 'death', 'let', 'see', 'have', 'blood-dripping', 'font', 'oh', 'yeah', 'much', 'better', 'chant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'think', 'people', 'talking', 'tongues', ""'re"", 'possessed', 'Exorcist', 'mind', 'same', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'feeling', 'chill', 'down', 'spine', 'evangelical', 'minister', 'importance', 'indoctrinating', 'impressionable', 'children', 'young', 'age', 'tactic', 'favored', 'none', 'other', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Nazi', 'Germany.What', 'clear', 'documentary', 'awful', 'adults', 'misuse', 'childhood', 'insecurities', 'natural', 'curiosity', 'world', 'peer', 'pressure', 'convince', 'children', 'answer', 'obstacle', 'problem', 'question', 'god', 'and/or', 'Jesus', 'rather', 'emphasizing', 'positive', 'Christian', 'values', 'such', 'forgiveness', 'compassion', 'focus', 'very', 'clearly', 'creating', 'barbed-wire', 'line', 'believers', 'anyone', 'who', 'question', 'preachers', 'what', 'quite', 'frankly', 'mean-spirited', 'egomaniacal', 'prejudiced', 'drivel.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'notion', 'what', 'documentary', 'skin', 'crawl', 'powerful', 'warning', 'what', 'happening', 'children', 'country', 'let', 'down', 'dilapidated', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'misinformed', 'one-sided', 'homeschooling', 'unintelligent', 'people', 'grasping', 'power', 'money', 'veil', 'Christian', 'belief']",Jesus Camp

Their fervor and easy malleability at such a young age were disquieting; equally so was the fact that the filmmaker obviously gained the trust of the parents and the Jesus Camp instructor, Becky, in order to get them to open up.  What a shock it must have been for them later on to realize that they were being mocked and humiliated.I watched about half of this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it but found that rest to be redundant.  One thing that did stick out in my mind though was the fact that so many kids who are home-schooled come from fundamentalist families who don't believe in evolution.  Several years ago, I read a great book by Carl Sagen about the growing ""scientific illiteracy in our culture -- how many people read their horoscopes on a daily basis and believe in UFO abductions or tarot card readings.

From what I read, even Becky Fisher found it to be so. For those who don't believe in the born-again/Pentacostal agenda, this can be an eye-opening movie about the Pentacostal religion. Initially I found myself shocked and upset at how the children were seemingly being ""brainwashed"" and psychologically traumatized by Becky Fisher's sermons. But then I told myself to check those biases - this is simply another cultural group with religious beliefs that are different from mine. I would want my kids to be raised within my cultural/religious beliefs. I would want them to grow into adults who truly take pride in their cultural and spiritual heritage. All families have that wish and that right, and that's what this group is doing too. It was hard (for me) to watch the kids preach about a dogma that I personally find offensive and against my own beliefs. But the point is - these families are simply following their religious beliefs. As someone posted here, it is seen by those in this religion as 'spiritual maturity' for these kids to have this kind of fervor. It's totally appropriate in this church for them to speak in tongues and preach to others as a means of ""winning the lost.""

Christianity is turned on its head.  Where is the love? Where is the caring?  There is so much emphasis on us vs them it is frightening.  They have exposed their children to hypnotic induction, manipulated them into fear and turned them into propaganda machines.  I see no difference between this and any other cult The movie helps me understand why evangelicals don't believe in global warming and even say that they are only here for a short time until Jesus comes to take them away to heaven.  So why not exploit the earth.  The frightening thing is that these people infiltrate government at the highest levels. I think Jesus would be horrified at what is done in His name. . The film is very well done showing us that these people want to turn our country into one of their own making, a theocracy and eliminate secular law.  ""Godly values"" is a buzz word for their ideas they want ""their"" politicians to bring and to me have very litttle to do with the God to whom I pray.  Whatever happened to Jesus' teachings of helping those less fortunate? I am a Catholic with balanced values.  While this evangelical sect doesn't represent all of them it is close enough for everyone to take a second look when people mention voting for those with ""Godly values"", which turn out not to be  ""Godly"" at all!

The documentary follows Pastor Becky Fisher and her congregation, mostly children since she's a children's pastor. In the film both Becky, some of the children and their parents are interviewed. The result is a very disturbing film.For those of us outside of the movement Fisher's approach to children seems harsh and irresponsible, it has all the markings of brainwashing. One of the most disturbing scenes is where Fisher preaches about double morale, letting the children believe they've let Satan in their heart by prayer in church but acting indifferently to her teachings in school. We see children panicking and bursting out into tears; later when the children start talking in tongues some seem to loose it.Yet nowhere in the movie there seems to be bad intent from her side, Becky really believes in what she preaches, really believes she's helping those children. The children themselves talk enthusiastically about the sermons and seem determined to convert others or become preachers themselves. At times the people portrayed here seem to live in another universe than yourselves, but at the same time they're completely congruent with their believes. When they denounce science or global warming these people honestly feel others who do are misguided and need saving.No where in the movie Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, the directors, attempt to explain how their subjects came into believing; their tales of being reborn remain superficial. In doing so the film never gets an judgemental character, but its also ultimately one of the weaknesses in the film. It leaves the viewer with more questions than he bargained for. You can't help but walking out of the theatre with a feeling of unease; pondering the enormous drift that is apparently there between you and these new borne Christians.The only balance brought to the movie is by a Christian radio show host. He represents a more moderate vein in Christianity and uses his show to ventilate his concerns on this relatively new movement, especially his concerns on how it seems to erode the separation of church and state, especially with the current administration in the White House. The radio show host is important to the movie, it brings balance to our view of Christians and places the movie in our social political times so we have a basis on which to evaluate what we just saw.Just how well Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady succeeded in remaining impartial became clear during the question round at the recent viewing at the International Documentary Festival in Amsterdam. A movie that shocked and disturbed most of the audience their was, according to the directors, perceived by its subject as a means to get the message out. They still remained in contact with Becky Fisher, who is apparently satisfied with the way her church is portrayed. Viewings in the US got different responses than in our Amsterdam audience, outside of the coastlines the audience was divided between those who were shocked and those who shouted out hallelujah during the film; once again making the divide in the States painfully clear.",5,Disturbing and Thought Provoking Document,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,3197,"['Jesus', 'camp', 'rare', 'document', 'one', 'few', 'honest', 'portrayals', 'right', 'wing', 'evangelist', 'movement', 'documentary', 'Pastor', 'Becky', 'Fisher', 'congregation', 'mostly', 'children', 'children', 'pastor', 'film', 'Becky', 'children', 'parents', 'are', 'interviewed', 'result', 'very', 'disturbing', 'film.For', 'movement', 'Fisher', 'approach', 'children', 'harsh', 'irresponsible', 'markings', 'brainwashing', 'One', 'most', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'where', 'Fisher', 'double', 'morale', 'letting', 'children', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'let', 'Satan', 'heart', 'prayer', 'church', 'acting', 'indifferently', 'teachings', 'school', 'see', 'children', 'panicking', 'bursting', 'out', 'tears', 'later', 'when', 'children', 'start', 'talking', 'tongues', 'seem', 'loose', 'it.Yet', 'nowhere', 'movie', 'there', 'be', 'bad', 'intent', 'side', 'Becky', 'really', 'what', 'really', 'helping', 'children', 'children', 'talk', 'enthusiastically', 'sermons', 'seem', 'determined', 'convert', 'others', 'become', 'preachers', 'times', 'people', 'portrayed', 'here', 'seem', 'live', 'universe', 'yourselves', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'completely', 'congruent', 'When', 'denounce', 'science', 'global', 'warming', 'people', 'honestly', 'feel', 'others', 'who', 'do', 'are', 'misguided', 'need', 'saving.No', 'where', 'movie', 'Heidi', 'Ewing', 'Rachel', 'Grady', 'directors', 'attempt', 'explain', 'how', 'subjects', 'came', 'believing', 'tales', 'being', 'reborn', 'remain', 'superficial', 'doing', 'so', 'film', 'never', 'judgemental', 'character', 'also', 'ultimately', 'one', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'viewer', 'more', 'questions', 'bargained', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'walking', 'theatre', 'feeling', 'unease', 'pondering', 'enormous', 'drift', 'apparently', 'new', 'borne', 'Christians.The', 'only', 'balance', 'brought', 'movie', 'Christian', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'more', 'moderate', 'vein', 'Christianity', 'show', 'ventilate', 'concerns', 'relatively', 'new', 'movement', 'especially', 'concerns', 'how', 'erode', 'separation', 'church', 'state', 'especially', 'current', 'administration', 'White', 'House', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'important', 'movie', 'balance', 'view', 'Christians', 'movie', 'social', 'political', 'times', 'have', 'basis', 'evaluate', 'what', 'just', 'saw.Just', 'how', 'well', 'Heidi', 'Ewing', 'Rachel', 'Grady', 'succeeded', 'remaining', 'impartial', 'became', 'clear', 'question', 'round', 'recent', 'viewing', 'International', 'Documentary', 'Festival', 'Amsterdam', 'A', 'movie', 'shocked', 'disturbed', 'most', 'audience', 'was', 'according', 'directors', 'perceived', 'subject', 'means', 'get', 'message', 'out', 'still', 'remained', 'contact', 'Becky', 'Fisher', 'who', 'apparently', 'satisfied', 'way', 'church', 'portrayed', 'Viewings', 'US', 'got', 'different', 'responses', 'Amsterdam', 'audience', 'coastlines', 'audience', 'was', 'divided', 'who', 'were', 'shocked', 'who', 'shouted', 'out', 'hallelujah', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'making', 'divide', 'States', 'painfully', 'clear']",Jesus Camp

The film depicts a radical sect of the evangelical movement, in particular youth ministry.  In any evangelical church, youth ministry is at times manipulative and borderline brainwashing.  However, it is mostly benign, just teaching kids the difference from right and wrong.  Becky Fischer's methods go way overboard and is overt indoctrination into this radical movement.  It's disturbing to watch these kids cry as she lays down the standard guilt technique, claiming that some kids aren't true believers.  That technique is tried and true in ever evangelical church I've set foot in, but somehow in this context it seems way too manipulative and creepy.Of course the standard political elements are in this doc.  We see random pictures and references of President Bush, and a strange scene with a Bush cardboard cut out.  All along during the film, we have liberal-Christian radio commentator Mike Papantonio providing analysis.There were so many creepy people and actions in the movie, then to top it all off Rev Ted Haggard made an appearance.Becky Fischer at one point seemed to praise Palestinian militants and their methods for indoctrinating the youth.

1035306,A1XOHJLA16DPZT,B000KLQUV2,Steve Koss,"[65, 70]","Midway through this remarkably disturbing documentary film, Jesus Camp founder and director Becky Fischer is shown in what is presumably her own home, studying with the intensity of a college football coach preparing for his team's next game a taped version of one of the children's prayer meetings she leads. Mouth open in thrilled amazement, head shaking gently in approving self-awe, she blurts out the most unintentionally revealing line in this movie: ""They [children] are so usable in Christianity."" In practically the same breath, she allows that ""extreme liberals"" must be ""shaking in their boots"" to see such intense belief in children, that the evangelical Christian indoctrination of children is morally more justified than the same actions among Muslims, Jews, and Palestinians because, ""Excuse me, we have the truth,"" and that the same ""we"" must ""stand up and take back the land [America].""Although JESUS CAMP spends about half its time at Becky Fischer's Kids on Fire summer camp in (ironically) Devil's Lake, ND, it could perhaps be more aptly titled JESUS WORLD or KIDS FOR JESUS. Co-directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady center their documentary on three young children, all apparently ten years old or younger: Levi, Tory, and Rachael. These three children are followed from church prayer meetings to their homes (where they recite Christianized pledges of allegiance and are schooled by their mothers in creationism and the fallacies of global warming), and later to a Ted Haggard evangelical convention in Colorado Springs and a pro-life demonstration (complete with red duct tape inscribed LIFE fastened over their mouths) in Washington, D.C. Ewing and Grady remain strictly outside observers these events, offering neither voice-over or commentary. Rather, they offer a softened Christian response through extended excerpts from Mike Papantonio's syndicated radio talk show, Ring of Fire, as response to Becky Fischer's Kids on Fire.In his classic 1963 book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, Dr. Robert J. Lifton identified eight conditions of thought reform as he observed them in Communist China:1. Milieu control - control of human communication through environmental control and limiting all forms of communication with the outside world.2. Mystical manipulation - the group has a higher purpose, experiences are attributed to spiritual causes, control through planned spontaneity.3. The demand for purity - absolute purity can be achieved, failures must be confessed and/or punished.4. The cult of confession - public confessions, minimized privacy, verbalizing all interior fears and anxieties.5. Aura of sacred science - the cult's rules and regulations are absolute, their dogma is absolutely scientific and morally true.6. Loading the language - black-and-white thinking, good words and evil words, relentlessly judging.7. Doctrine over person - the individual is insignificant, the group is all; personal experience and judgment are irrelevant, subordinated to the doctrine.8. Dispensed existence - an elitist worldview and a sharp division between those who are chosen or saved and those who are lost.Intentionally or otherwise, directors Ewing and Brady demonstrate all eight of these conditions in JESUS CAMP's treatment of Tory, Levi, Rachael, and their camper peers. They leave little room for doubt that we are witnessing brainwashing pure and simple, cult formation into an intolerant religious radicalism that brooks no questioning and sees all others as enemies. Becky Fischer talks about enemies, and Ted Haggard declares ""It's massive warfare every day.""JESUS CAMP will leave you alternately shaking your head and cringing over the brainwashing these impressionable young children are receiving. Ewing and Grady's film is an extraordinarily powerful depiction of innocent young minds being manipulated by adults in the name of a blind religious fervor. The process recalls by comparison other such movements, past and present: radical Islamic fundamentalism, the Taliban, China's Red Guard, North Korea, the Hitler Youth. Dante would have reserved a special circle in his Inferno for adults who rob children of their innocence and opportunity to learn, consider alternatives, and choose for themselves. Thankfully, the directors have inserted a few moments that lighten the overall atmosphere: Rachael's attempt at bowling alley proselytizing, kids praying over a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush, and Ted Haggard's hysterically ironic admonitions in full-face close-up that ""I think I know what you did last night; if you send me $[...], I won't tell your wife"" and ""You need to repent.""Ewing and Grady save their best for last. DON'T TURN OFF YOUR DVD THE MOMENT THE CREDITS START TO ROLL or you'll miss out on the film's best moments when Rachael and Levi reach out to three elderly black men sitting in a shaded park. Rachael's simple response to one old man's confident assurance that he will go to heaven when he dies is priceless and neatly illustrates everything that is wrong about radical evangelicalism. Plopped contentedly in her living room armchair, Becky Fischer sums it all up in an earlier part of the movie. Remarking on the trance-like religious intensity of her charges, she ponders admiringly, ""What are these kids going to be like when they grow up?""

I saw it for the first time in 2007 and I watched it again last night. The film amazes and appalls in its depiction of the ways that the Christian Right indoctrinates its children.Jesus Camp is about three children who attend the Kids on Fire camp in Devil's Lake, North Dakota, during summer 2005. The organizers of the camp inform the kids that they can change the world by spreading the evangelical message. The kids are also warned, however, that the Devil targets the young and that they are likely to burn in hell if they don't heed God's message. The camp's director particularly condemns children who watch and read Harry Potter because you ""don't make heroes out of warlocks."" The speeches lead a number of the kids to cry on camera.The adults involved in Kids on Fire make no bones about indoctrinating their kids. One adult says, with no sense of irony, that the Palestinians do a much better job of indoctrinating their children. The same woman says ""I don't feel any child gets anything by choice."" An unforgettable scene involves the adults bringing in a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush and instructing the kids to pray for him. After the prayers, an anti-abortion activist comes in with some plastic fetuses that are supposed to show the size of a human fetus at different stages of development.I felt for the children in the film. All of them are earnest and attempt to do the right thing. One thing that I have noticed about the evangelicals in my area is that they send their children out to proselytize and solicit funds, while the parents seldom engage in such activities.The most striking aspect of the film, to me, is how little we hear about forgiveness and God's love for humanity; in my upbringing (in the Episcopal Church), these two points were the center of the Christian doctrine.I highly recommend Jesus Camp to anyone interested in the role of religion in the U.S. Whatever your beliefs, you will be left with a lot of food for thought.",5,Children in the Hands of an Angry God,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,2104,"['risk', 'going', 'overboard', 'can', 'say', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'almost', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'saw', 'first', 'time', '2007', 'watched', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'film', 'amazes', 'appalls', 'depiction', 'ways', 'Christian', 'Right', 'children.Jesus', 'Camp', 'three', 'children', 'who', 'attend', 'Kids', 'Fire', 'camp', 'Devil', 'Lake', 'North', 'Dakota', 'summer', '2005', 'organizers', 'camp', 'inform', 'kids', 'can', 'change', 'world', 'spreading', 'evangelical', 'message', 'kids', 'are', 'also', 'warned', 'however', 'Devil', 'young', 'are', 'likely', 'burn', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'heed', 'God', 'message', 'camp', 'director', 'particularly', 'condemns', 'children', 'who', 'watch', 'read', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'heroes', 'warlocks', 'speeches', 'lead', 'number', 'kids', 'cry', 'camera.The', 'adults', 'involved', 'Kids', 'Fire', 'make', 'bones', 'indoctrinating', 'kids', 'One', 'adult', 'sense', 'irony', 'Palestinians', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'indoctrinating', 'children', 'same', 'woman', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'child', 'anything', 'choice', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'adults', 'bringing', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'instructing', 'kids', 'pray', 'prayers', 'anti-abortion', 'activist', 'plastic', 'fetuses', 'are', 'supposed', 'show', 'size', 'human', 'fetus', 'different', 'stages', 'development.I', 'felt', 'children', 'film', 'are', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'One', 'thing', 'have', 'noticed', 'evangelicals', 'area', 'send', 'children', 'proselytize', 'solicit', 'funds', 'parents', 'seldom', 'engage', 'such', 'activities.The', 'most', 'striking', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'little', 'hear', 'forgiveness', 'God', 'love', 'humanity', 'upbringing', 'Episcopal', 'Church', 'two', 'points', 'were', 'center', 'Christian', 'doctrine.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'anyone', 'interested', 'role', 'religion', 'U.S.', 'beliefs', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'lot', 'food', 'thought']",Jesus Camp
1035308,A2BMDY4WJIDGG7,B000KLQUV2,S Tuffnell,"[1, 5]","""Jesus Camp"" is a documentary which at first glance seems to be focussing on a group of American fundamentalist extremists who set up a camp for kids 'Kids on Fire' where children are indoctrinated into the teachings of misogynist and bigamist Christian law. The film would have us believe that the loud obnoxious voice of condemnation comes from Becky Fischer, shown to be a nightmare of overweight loud mouth hypocritical nonsense, that causes kids to cry their eyes out when they admit they are sinners and going to hell. The kids are far too young to be thrown all this but the evangelicals in the film have no problem likening a little furry lion toy to SIN and swinging another older lion toy and state ""you got yourself a tiger by the tail and you don't know which end is up"".  Becky Fischer sets herself up for unbridled ridicule with idiotic flippant remarks that never paint her in a good light. At the beginning when she is preaching to the kids she says the problem with America is we are fat and lazy and would not want to fast for 7 days, yet the camera is on a low angle and emphasises how fat Becky is making her words seem ridiculous. She says ""The devil goes after the young... warlocks are enemies of God, had it been in the Old Testament Harry Potter would have been put to death!"" and all the kids clap making it all like a brainwashing session. She says ""come up here and get washed of all your sins"" and she washes all the kids hands with a bottle of Nestle water. As this is occurring a woman is wailing as if in a trance, then the kids begin praying. It really is disturbing to watch. Parents are seen raising the hands of their children forcing their decisions, and there is even a drama taken out of context making the kids look like a tribe of soldiers with painted faces and weapons of warfare.The above description is pretty much how most would react to this Anti-Christian propaganda. A closer look though will reveal there is more going on here in this film than one may initially perceive depending on one's perspective. The scene where Becky says ""don't stop this is the greatest day of your life next to being saved"" is totally off kilter. The music chosen by the filmmakers is bone chilling, a sense of dread is perpetrated, and we see close ups of kids raised hands, eyes crying, and eyes to mouth close up of a young girl speaking weird languages, and it all seems so programmed and sinister. If the filmmaker's intentions were to show that these kids are being brainwashed into a cult they have totally succeeded. It is a one sided affair and the intense camera angles brain wash us into really believing that this is just a cult. But is it? What are we really seeing and what has been omitted that the filmmakers did not want us to see? As long as we are made to fear evangelicals and all that Christians stand for, the filmmakers are content to show us. They are not content to show us anything that happens that is even remotely good. We see the ends of sessions with all the praying but not the sessions themselves, unless of course Fischer makes a radical statement; all of these statements are contained in the film to make sure she is depicted as a threatening monster.An interview with Levi, the child preacher with the long rats tail, reveals the film took out many parts of the dialogue that made things seem more positive. Also there are deleted scenes that showed some of the really nice things that happened. Instead the film focuses on the most radical weird events of the camp such as praying to a cardboard President Bush, smashing a cup, putting tape across their mouths stating 'life', strapping a fetus to their hands, passing around fetus models, and watching a video against Evolution. Of course these things will upset the viewing public and the movie is designed to shock.The film is a piece of sensationalism, plain and simple. The shock tactics of the film make me more disturbed than the actual things that occur at the camp. During the cup smashing scene for example the editing is so programmed it is astounding. We see jump cuts from the breaking cups with a hammer to a shot of the kids reaching out their hands (out of context, just worshipping to a song) jump back to a hammer smashing a cup, close up of kid with hammer for a second, cup breaking for a second, back to kids praying and a boy yells ""Jesus!"" back to a young girls tear streaked face looking up in adoration, another profile scene of a kid looking up with sun streaming through making the shot seem odd, then a shot of a boy crying on the floor shaking and a little girl passes a tissue box as we hear ""If you want something from God you will have to cook a little, you need to stay in the pot, let Him simmer you in the Holy Ghost"". Anyone who has any media knowledge can see how manipulative this type of film editing is. The filmmakers are making it seem worse than it would have been, making a mountain of a mole hill. It was just a symbolic action to make the kids understand more clearly, but the odd editing makes it look sinister and with cult like weirdness. When the little girl cries out, ""we proclaim the lion of Judah"" I broke down as she was in tears praying to God. Then Becky yells like a chant ""This means war! This means war! Are you a part of it or not?"" The music is nightmarish here, a low rumbling drone building ominously, that might accompany a stalker creeping up on a victim, and there are reverberated echoes placed throughout that really have a disquieting effect. The misc-en-scene in this segment alone points to the hidden agenda of the filmmakers.We also have to put up with that radio announcer who gets on my nerves more than Fischer, with his rantings about the problems of Christian fundamentalist attitudes; ""Fundamentalists are tenacious and they elbow their way into positions of power in America, that is the ammo to building a government that they are comfortable with, there's this slow chipping away of the church and state"". Another political agenda thereby surfaces by the tactical placement of the disc jockey who becomes the ghost voice of the filmmakers and the mindset of the viewing public who will automatically take his side.The editing even shows things out of context throughout. At a bowling game young Rachael is shown reading a Christian tract and there is nothing wrong with that, but look at the picture they show in close up, of a baby in a grave and the words ""so the blood in the baby's veins was not human it was God's blood"". Also a pic of Jesus' hand with a nail in it is seen, therefore out of the whole book the filmmakers make sure we see the more controversial bloodier pics. Then she prays for her bowling shot before taking it ""Jesus make a good hit,"" but this is clearly a voice over inserted later as her head was down and she would be inaudible. When she throws the ball the edit is the ball going down in the middle of the lane, then it cuts to her walking away as the ball is now in the gutter, making her prayer look futile. Sure, we do not have to pray when we throw a bowling ball but why do the filmmakers want to show this at all? It makes me wonder again what the hidden agenda is of the film itself. I wonder why I feel so angry at the content of the film, and I realise I too am being manipulated by clever selective editing, camera angles and manipulative music.Fischer, off her own bat manages to give the filmmakers enough fuel to add to the fire, as she is constantly  saying the wrong things behind the scenes making her look like a charlatan. She says before the camp even starts ""I am so exhausted"" and she has only sprayed her hair. She says as she makes a computer slideshow with the font for word 'Death' ""I've got something dripping with blood here"". Satisfied she has found the right `bloodier' font she says ""Yes, that's better"". Great witness! She is seen blowing up a balloon to show how sin inflates, and she shows a brain mould that would symbolise the mind, and sticky fingers to represent sin. We do not see any of these sessions which were perhaps great fun for the kids, but the camera is more devoted to only showing anything that happened that was bizarre in some way.  For example, Becky's cover girl comments when she is being photographed ""It's almost like being on the cover of Rolling Stones"". It is Rolling Stone really, Becky. She could have kept these personal things to herself instead of letting her mouth go into overdrive when the camera was on her but it just makes her intentions seem sinister. Anyone is bound to say weird things when a camera is turned on you, that is a natural thing, but the film magnifies these normally quirky humorous things making them seem very sinister. No wonder Becky closed the camp location after the negative reaction of the film.It is quite a chilling film but I must profess that it really has a hidden agenda and the filmmakers use creepy music throughout especially in the scenes where kids are speaking in tongues or praying, and they show extreme close ups of their faces. These aspects give the film an unsettling quality. The children are rarely if ever seen smiling or having a good time, all the fun aspects of the camp are left on the cutting room floor to be replaced by the serious parts of the sessions that has the effect of making the camp seem grim and focussing on supernatural warfare. It is definitely disturbing to watch extreme close ups of a little girl looking up with tears pouring down, and this little girl, who appears on the cover of the DVD, is used often in the film. Why? The reason is that she was the most emotional so made us angrier when we see here wracked in tears. She also has a strange look on her face as though in a trance and that would suit the filmmakers. Really being touched by God's spirit is normally a private thing that happens sometimes in churches when God moves in the Spirit, but watching these isolated things on the film magnifies them and makes it look like a cult. It may be borderline using kids like this but usually kid's church is a wonderful fun time, and nobody mentions death, hell, or abortion, they just learn about the love of God and Bible stories.Reactionists have hailed it as the most appalling horror movie they have seen, scary as hell, or 1 and a half hours of child abuse. Personally I just wept when I saw those kids crying out against abortion and smashing a cup as a symbol of smashing governmental control. They are far too young to be fed this adult stuff and surely kids praying to a cardboard lifesize George Bush and the leaders of the camp laying hands and praying over the microphones and audio equipment is just opening oneself up for ridicule. Also Pastor Ted Haggard is an object of ridicule; he is preaching away and he is so full of himself, he can't resist showing off. He sees the doco camera and leans into it pointing and saying in a creepy tone, ""I think I know what you did last night....  If you send me $1000 I won't tell your wife!"" Wild laughing and applause follows. He follows up with some flippant comment that if you use this I will sue you, and makes a joke about someone dying so you can get their money. But it makes him look creepy and deranged. Haggard is not the ideal role model either as he fell from grace later professing to be a gay man, taking crystal meth and having a prostitute. So the hypocrite in all his glory is on show. The filmmakers make sure that the screen is absolutely littered with hypocrites.It all paints Christianity as a horrendous thing and the filmmakers make sure that they use every chance they can get to make Christians look like buffoons. As a Christian myself I take exception to this and although the film attempts to show what happens at a kids camp it does so in such a contrived manipulative manner that it becomes in itself a form of brainwashing. More manipulative than the kids camp leaders are the filmmakers who want to make certain as most media outlets, that Christianity is given the worst possible coverage. People seeing the film may make the assumption that all Christian organised doctrines are this radical and extreme, and that we are being brainwashed and it is simply not true.",2,Watching the film

1035309,A2TFWLHE25JD06,B000KLQUV2,Surrounded,"[1, 1]","Purely as a documentary, ""Jesus Camp"" strikes a balance between ""show me"" and ""tell me;"" that is, scenes that show something going on, intercut with talking heads giving their opinions.  The filmmakers stay out of the way, their presence implied only when Ted Haggard addresses them directly a few times.  Although the film is clearly intended to expose people outside this community to a religious practice they may have been unfamiliar with, apparently it is so even-handed that the woman running the camp, Becky Fischer, uses the film as her own advertisement.The practices depicted in the film would be considered child abuse if they were not so widespread.  The radio host, Mike Papantonio, decries the conflation of Jesus with the Republican Party; I would go further in calling it an unholy alliance of the fanaticism of R.J. Rushdoony and the heartless capitalism of Ayn Rand.  Fischer comes across as a sociopath with a touch of insanity, praying over the electrical equipment, as Satan loves a power outage.  These people, almost exclusively white and middle-class, see themselves at war with Islam, with secular society, and are capable of the doublethink that allows them to see themselves both as an oppressed minority and a triumphant majority at the same time.  Abortion, of course, symbolizes everything wrong with America.  George W. Bush is virtually worshipped, with children actually praying to a cardboard cutout of him; God is asked to provide ""righteous judges.""  Ted Haggard's speech begins with a condemnation of homosexuality; I cannot see him in any pre-scandal footage, with his arrogant, condescending attitude, without thinking of what he was doing right after the church service, snorting crystal meth and having sex with a male prostitute.  Was he a top or a bottom?  He's never said.  The ""forgiving"" community in this film, that poured water over children's hands as they repented of hiding their Christianity from their friends in the outside world, wasted no time in ousting the repentant Haggard as if he were Satan himself.Many of these children undoubtedly will reject this indoctrination as they grow older, probably becoming militant atheists.  There's simply no way to sustain this level of insanity outside the cocoon of church and home schooling.  But at least no one is strapping bombs to them and sending them into a crowded marketplace or a platoon of soldiers.  I found myself wondering how I would answer the adorable nine-year-old girl if she came up to me and asked what I thought would happen to me if I were to die at that very moment.  Ask where her parents were, and tell them they didn't deserve to have children?  Or quote Wordsworth, ""a simple child, that lightly draws its breath, and feels its life in every limb, what can it know of death?""  Or Whitman's great closing to ""Respondez,"" ""Let the limited years of life do nothing for the limitless years of death!

We were never told much about the devil or frightened beyond belief about it's existence. I think this documentary will even scare the devil out of his wits.Jesus Camp is about 3 weeks a year in the summer at Devil's Lake (no I'm not kidding) in North Dakota. It's run by Pastor Becky Fischer who truly believes that she's doing God's Will in raising Christian warriors. The camp buffet looks great but everything there is geared toward further indoctrinating young children like Rachael, Levi, and Tory into preaching the word of the Lord.Levi is home-schooled and it turns out that 75 percent of homeschooled children are Evangelical Christians. At home, they don't learn about evolution or the origins of earth. According to a cartoon played at Levi's home in Missouri, they know that the earth is about 6,000 years old according to the Bible. They still believe in Adam and Eve and the six days fundamentally and literally. Levi's mother is one of those true fundamentalist believers who instructs her children at home.Rachael seems kind-hearted but she talks about other churches where it's like the walking dead because they sing a few songs and listen to a sermon but the people aren't dancing and alive. I was deeply disturbed by that as well as her going up to a woman in a bowling alley telling her that the Lord was concerned about her. She even went to three African American men sitting on lawn chairs in Washington D.C. and asked where are they going to go when they died? The man replied ""heaven."" I guess she understood them to be Christians. She made a disturbing comment that she thought they were Muslims.Tory was another one but I didn't see much about her as Rachael and Levi in this documentary. Surprisingly, Pastor Ted Haggard makes an appearance and Colorado Springs has a large Evangelical Christian population. I thought he came across better than he did before the scandal in this documentary. How is he going to explain his situation to the children like Levi and Rachael?Pastor Becky Fischer runs Lakewood Bible Camp in North Dakota. There she further indoctrinates the children to more speaking of the tongues, praising the Lord, educating themselves about Jesus, and preaching to the world. There is nothing sadder than watching children cry for no reason in this documentary. They are taught early on whether through their home-schooling, church, and the camp about Jesus and war with the Devil on every front. The Devil is supposed to be the most horrifying of all and scaring the children into prayer and complete devotion even fasting for the Lord.I wonder what God would do? Since the film is less than 90 minutes, I thought the extras should have been included in the film to help understand the situation further. I thought there that Pastor Ted Haggard came across as human rather than preaching fire and brimstone.This documentary is perhaps one of the most frightening films because it appears as if the children are being brainwashed and cultivated to feel guilt for the rest of their lives and insecure about their own abilities or future plans without wondering if the devil is behind everything.",4,Scary and Frightening!,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,3267,"[""'m"", 'Catholic', 'went', 'Catholic', 'Schools', 'even', 'nuns', 'never', 'had', 'abuse', 'indoctrination', 'anyway', 'were', 'never', 'told', 'much', 'devil', 'frightened', 'belief', 'existence', 'think', 'documentary', 'will', 'even', 'scare', 'devil', 'wits.Jesus', 'Camp', 'about', '3', 'weeks', 'year', 'summer', 'Devil', 'Lake', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'North', 'Dakota', 'run', 'Pastor', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'who', 'truly', 'doing', 'God', 'Will', 'raising', 'Christian', 'warriors', 'camp', 'buffet', 'great', 'everything', 'geared', 'further', 'indoctrinating', 'young', 'children', 'Rachael', 'Levi', 'Tory', 'preaching', 'word', 'Lord.Levi', 'home-schooled', 'out', '75', 'percent', 'homeschooled', 'children', 'are', 'Evangelical', 'Christians', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'evolution', 'origins', 'earth', 'According', 'cartoon', 'played', 'Levi', 'home', 'Missouri', 'know', 'earth', '6,000', 'years', 'old', 'according', 'Bible', 'still', 'believe', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'six', 'days', 'fundamentally', 'literally', 'Levi', 'mother', 'one', 'true', 'fundamentalist', 'believers', 'who', 'children', 'home.Rachael', 'kind-hearted', 'talks', 'other', 'churches', 'where', 'walking', 'dead', 'sing', 'few', 'songs', 'listen', 'sermon', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'dancing', 'alive', 'was', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'up', 'woman', 'bowling', 'alley', 'telling', 'Lord', 'was', 'concerned', 'even', 'went', 'three', 'African', 'American', 'men', 'sitting', 'lawn', 'chairs', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'asked', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'when', 'died', 'man', 'replied', 'heaven', 'guess', 'understood', 'be', 'Christians', 'made', 'disturbing', 'comment', 'thought', 'were', 'Muslims.Tory', 'was', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Rachael', 'Levi', 'documentary', 'Surprisingly', 'Pastor', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'appearance', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'large', 'Evangelical', 'Christian', 'population', 'thought', 'came', 'better', 'did', 'scandal', 'documentary', 'How', 'going', 'explain', 'situation', 'children', 'Levi', 'Rachael', 'Pastor', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'Lakewood', 'Bible', 'Camp', 'North', 'Dakota', 'further', 'children', 'more', 'speaking', 'tongues', 'praising', 'Lord', 'educating', 'Jesus', 'preaching', 'world', 'nothing', 'sadder', 'watching', 'children', 'cry', 'reason', 'documentary', 'are', 'taught', 'early', 'home-schooling', 'church', 'camp', 'Jesus', 'war', 'Devil', 'front', 'Devil', 'supposed', 'be', 'most', 'horrifying', 'scaring', 'children', 'prayer', 'complete', 'devotion', 'even', 'fasting', 'Lord.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'God', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'thought', 'extras', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'help', 'understand', 'situation', 'further', 'thought', 'there', 'Pastor', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'came', 'human', 'rather', 'preaching', 'fire', 'brimstone.This', 'documentary', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'films', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'cultivated', 'feel', 'guilt', 'rest', 'lives', 'insecure', 'own', 'abilities', 'future', 'plans', 'wondering', 'devil', 'everything']",Jesus Camp

The use of fear to stir children to heightened states so you can more easily manipulate them is distrubing but some folks will say that parents and religion have the right to do whatever they wish. I noticed that the children were constantly told they were sinful and that they needed to repent -- the message is that they are never true christians and never saved until they are willing to do the ultimate in their war.  No, they aren't teaching them to use guns yet but the rhetoric is laying the foundation for being able to do that in the future.

I strongly disagree with their theology and the whole idea of glossolalia (speaking in tongues) being acceptable within the church today.Also the depiction of Christians looking at President Bush as a good leader with Christian values sickens me. I think Bush has demonstrated blatant un-Christian behavior and I am appalled that professing Christian conservatives still support him. I voted third party in the presidential election for a real Christian conservative.There are many Christian fundamentalists who find the behavior of the Christians in this film to be very un-Christian and some might even call it signs of demonic possession.I praise the film for it criticism of the Charismatic movement but it should be made clear that a vast majority of Christian fundamentalists don't act this way.",3,Not all Christian fundamentalists act this way !,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1063,"['Fundmentalist', 'Christian', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'misrepresentation', 'Christian', 'fundamentalism', 'Yes', 'people', 'film', 'present', 'Christians', 'anybody', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'Christian.The', 'film', 'mainly', 'Charismatic', 'Pentacostals', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'theology', 'whole', 'idea', 'glossolalia', 'speaking', 'tongues', 'being', 'acceptable', 'church', 'depiction', 'Christians', 'looking', 'President', 'Bush', 'good', 'leader', 'Christian', 'values', 'think', 'Bush', 'demonstrated', 'blatant', 'un-Christian', 'behavior', 'am', 'appalled', 'professing', 'Christian', 'conservatives', 'still', 'support', 'voted', 'third', 'party', 'presidential', 'election', 'real', 'Christian', 'are', 'many', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'who', 'find', 'behavior', 'Christians', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'un-Christian', 'might', 'even', 'call', 'signs', 'demonic', 'possession.I', 'praise', 'film', 'criticism', 'Charismatic', 'movement', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'vast', 'majority', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'way']",Jesus Camp
1035313,AEKVNXC6R8O9G,B000KLQUV2,The philosopher,"[1, 2]","Scarier than any horror film, this documentary focuses on the summer camp for young children that Pentecostal preacher Becky Fischer founded and ran.Watch her and the other ministers get the children to speak in tongues and bring the children to a tearful emotional frenzy. Watch these preachers bring a cardboard cutout of President Bush (the documentary was from 2005), explain to children that Bush was surrounded by godly people (like Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Karl Rove?), and have the children tell Bush via the cardboard cutout that the United States is &#34;one nation under God&#34; (their God, of course--Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and all other non-Christians have no place in this country and are going to hell). Watch the adults complain about abortion, godless public schools, Darwinism, devious liberals or secularists pushing the theory of climate change, and other standard tropes of evangelicals. Watch footage of mega-pastor Ted Haggard, then President of the National Association of Evangelicals, which then represented 30 million people, preach at his church about the evil of homosexuality. A year later, Haggard would resign because he was consorting with a male prostitute and buying crystal meth. By the way, Haggard had been talking with President Bush or his advisers every Monday, which perhaps explains some of the spectacular failures of that administration.It's soul-crushingly sad to watch these kids being taught such a parochial view of life as the absolute truth and to see that the basics of critical reasoning, which focuses on how to think, not what to think, are completely ignored. It also shows why our country is in such bad shape, given the immense political power far-right evangelicals have wielded with their simplistic and often factually incorrect views of topics like climate change.The reaction of viewers of this movie to the &#34;Jesus camp&#34; was so negative that the camp was shut down.

1035315,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000KLQUV2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 12]","I enjoy going to thrillers and horror films, looking for the next great `edge of your seat' film experience. More often than not, I am left wanting, as the filmmakers resort to a series of cheap thrills trying to scare the audience with graphic, disgusting images, robbing their films of any impact. Well, I recently saw one of the scariest films I have ever seen. It not only left me on the edge of my seat, but is also filled with graphic, disgusting images and is all the more impactful because the film is a documentary about real people who run a camp for children. You horror devotees out there are probably saying to yourself ""oooh sounds promising"". Then you better hurry out and rent the new documentary ""Jesus Camp"", truly one of the scariest films I have seen in some time.The documentary follows Pastor Becky Fischer, an Evangelical Christian Children's Pastor, as she meets with a group of children at a church. She is there to meet with and talk with the kids, but she is also there to sell her summer camp, located at Devil's Lake, South Dakota. Every summer, she and a small staff, welcome children from around the country, and their parents, for a summer camp devoted to training children to become the next wave of Evangelical warriors.At this initial meeting, Pastor Becky meets three children who will end up coming to the summer camp; Levi, a young boy with a mullet, who believes so strongly in God and the message of his church, his wardrobe exists almost exclusively of t-shirts proclaiming his love of God, Rachael, a young woman, who loves to dance, but feels her body movements might lead to temptation and move her away from the church, even though she dances to Christian rock and Tory, the youngest of the group, doesn't hesitate to approach strangers and ask them if they are Christians and give them pamphlets about the church and their message. These three children all attend Pastor Becky's summer camp and we are invited along for the experience.The beauty of ""Jesus Camp"" is that the directors, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, have been given access to a world most of us will never see. Pastor Becky lets them in and they film some of the meetings and seminars. They talk to each of the participants and we hear their own words. There are a few half-hearted attempts to show the `other side' of the argument, but these aren't really necessary.The horror of the film isn't a `liberal' or `conservative' thing; it has nothing to do with that. The horror comes from watching these children soak up these messages like a sponge, frequently with their parents in attendance, and never learning the `other side' of the argument, for comparison's sake, if nothing else.After we meet the three children, we follow one of them home and learn that she is being home schooled. Her mother doesn't believe the school system promotes an ideology that they want their kids to learn. Her number one objection? There is no prayer in school. As the mother talks about the home schooling, we listen to her teaching her daughter about `Creationism' and the lack of evidence supporting global warming. I didn't realize global warming, as an idea, was something Evangelical Christians were against. Why? This doesn't make any sense. Yet, they seem to believe this very strongly.We meet Levi, whose parents will accompany him to camp and the family will take a road trip after the camp to Colorado and Washington, DC, bringing Tory along for the ride. Levi wears bright colorful t-shirts, as any kid his age would. Yet, his bright orange t-shirt with the Reese's peanut butter cup symbol is filled with the word `Jesus'. All of his t-shirts are like this. Levi is being groomed to be the next Ted Haggart (who appears in the documentary, more on that later) and I have no doubt he will one day end up with a television ministry. His beliefs and conviction are so strong, we just know he will one day take a wrong turn and start preaching on television.And the cameras roll as Pastor Becky talks about her mission. At one point, she explains how Muslim people train their children to be warriors, why shouldn't Christians train their children to be warriors. During her visit to the church, she leads a prayer session and many of the children seem to become consumed with guilt and start crying, and shaking, and pleading for God's forgiveness. For what? They are 9 and 10 years old. What could they have done that would require God's forgiveness?At the camp, Pastor Becky promises a fun time for all and shows us some of the props she uses to illustrate the various messages she portrays. At one point, she picks up a Ken doll and a Barbie, both of which are covered in leaves. You can probably guess the message. She goes on to show us more of the props she has accumulated and explains how she will use them. This is both frightening and numbing. Some of the messages she wants to present, and the props she wants to use are truly perplexing. Others are simplistic.She also has guest speakers. At one point, a man addresses the group and shows them a collection of small baby doll fetuses, in various sizes. He is there to talk about how all children, no matter the size, or the age, are God's children and God has a plan for them all. He then goes on to place a piece of duck tape with the word ""LIFE"" written on the front, over many of the people's mouths. This discussion is also pretty graphic. Again, the audience is 9 and 10 year olds, and he tells them about leading protests at birth control clinics, what happens during an abortion, etc.This session is followed by a group activity where the children smash mugs with the word `Government' printed on them and they bless a cardboard cut out of President George W. Bush.These scenes are riveting, interesting and scary.""Jesus Camp"" is not a perfect documentary. There are moments when the filmmakers simply film long stretches of highway, filled with fast food and chain restaurants, presumably in Pastor Becky's car. The idea is to draw parallels between the proliferation of strip malls, chain stores and the spreading of the type of large churches featured in the documentary. The parallel is made the first time they do this, yet they revisit this idea at least two more times. Perhaps they intended this as a sort of break between ideas or acts, but it doesn't really work that way.These moments also include radio commentary about the confirmation hearings for Associate Justice Alito as he was being considered for the Supreme Court.There are also a couple of moments with Mike Papantino, a radio talk show host who seems to have a show discussing religion on Air America. Mike appears to be a knowledgeable man and also seems to be amazed when members of the religious right call in. These moments are meant to be a sort of counterpoint to the Pastor Becky scenes and we see there can be a more moderate view of religion and how it fits into modern life. But these scenes are nowhere near as powerful as the scenes of the kids at camp. This is okay, because we really don't need them. The scenes of Pastor Becky and the children talking more than adequately convey the danger of teaching the children these messages. If the counterpoint isn't going to be as strong, they shouldn't be included. They may end up diluting the central message.Towards the end of the film, Mike Papantino gets a call from Pastor Becky and is able to pepper her with some hard questions. During the talk, she states that they don't talk about government at her camp, and this is moments after we have watched her children break mugs with the word `government' on them and then pray to the cardboard cutout of President Bush. Did she not remember these moments at her camp? Did she forget the cameras were rolling?Remember Levi? At camp, he is asked to preach to the group and spends an afternoon ruminating about the message he wants to present, what he wants to say, etc. Levi's parents attend the camp, along with his younger brother, and they make a regular family vacation out of it. After camp, they travel to Boulder, Colorado and visit Reverand Ted Haggart's extremely large church. The boys are mesmerized as Taggart leads his large sermon and we watch the director putting together the televised broadcast. This was clearly shot before Haggart was outed and confessed to having sex with male prostitutes. Now, he is apparently fighting with the film's producers and Distribution Company over his portrayal.Then the family travels to Washington, DC where they continue the protest over abortion, meeting at the Supreme Court and once again covering their mouths with tape and the word `LIFE"".These scenes are interesting, but they don't really fit with the overall theme of the rest of the documentary. The film is called ""Jesus Camp"", not ""Jesus Summer Vacation"". I would have preferred more exposure to the activities at the camp, even though what I did see made me ill to my stomach.Overall, ""Jesus Camp"" is a very effective, very interesting documentary I won't soon forget. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary, but didn't win, it was up against ""An Inconvenient Truth"".""Jesus Camp"" is a necessary viewing experience.",4,The Scariest Horror Film I

1035317,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000KLQUV2,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[6, 9]","I admit right off that this film wasn't quite what I expected. I'd taped something off HBO recently that was similar, about how certain ""religious activists"" are influencing us. And I guess I expected this to be more, well, frightening.So, it starts with Becky Fischer--as another critic had pointed out, a rather obese preacher (referring in the beginning, ironically, to someone fasting!) There's not much unexpected there. She's got the answer--have you ever dealt with fundamentalists? Of course they have the answer, and you can't reason them out of it.The real subject of the film, though, was the children over whom Ms. Fisher is attempting to have a great influence. To start, they were surprisingly articulate. One of them has short hair and a pony tail, just a hairstyle I wouldn't expect from a young guy of that ""conservative"" background. The articulateness was mixed with an extreme of emotion. During some of the camp experiences, they were crying, quivering. Oh, and I mustn't forget, their speakers often rambled on ""in tongues."" That's something that has always made me laugh. C'mon. You're claiming that means something, or is inspired? Nonsense. A chimp or a puppy can do that! Anyway...The kids repeatedly referred to themselves as ""warriors."" THAT is what I found most frightening about the camp. The difference between, say, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish fundamentalists is neglible at best. (Kevin Phillips in at least one of his books points out that they reinforce each other!) Warrior implies violence. And violence is violence, with the same consequences no matter what your ""cause."" It is the manifestation of ""extremism.""Later in the program, the film introduces you to the now infamous Ted Haggart. He points out that there are, if I got the numbers correct, two churches opening per day of his doctrine. That's another thing that brought a chuckle to me. I've talked with three denominations (which I won't specify here) in as many years that claim they are the fastest growing churches in the country. They all claim more and more adherents, yet I don't know of any. It must be a nice illusion.Some reviewers have commented on the ""pro-choice"" ideology of the producers of the film. I don't know if I buy that, but what was obvious from the film itself and even more from some deleted scenes which are part of the DVD is the preoccupation of the fundamentalists with abortion. That preoccupation became obvious when some mistachioed adult speaker with ""Life"" on his t-shirt addressed the kids in the camp, then continued throughout.As to the ""liberal"" agenda of the producers, woven into the theme was the election of Alito onto the Supreme Court bench. I didn't see that as a ""pro-choice"" commentary, but as a challenge to the fundamentalists' perhaps excessive influence over something as important as the choice of a Supreme Court justice--and, inferably, other offices, e.g., the presidency.And the inclusion of the stars and stripes over ""Christian"" crosses, and  the kids' recitiation of pledges of allegiance to the Christian flag and to the bible which were paraphrases of the traditional pledge of allegiance were a poignant display of the political agenda of the kids' teachers!Woven into the film too was commentary by a radio announcer by whom I was a little confused at first: He commented on his role as a ""Christian,"" so, until later in the film, I wasn't sure whether the guy was an ally or a rival of the fundamentalist message. Right here, then, I won't give away his role, but let you see the film and come to your own conclusion. He was, I'll point out, an advocate of separation of church and state, something with which Ms. Fisher zealously disagreed.I liked the music, by the way. I didn't find  it as ominous as some critics felt, but it kept me awaiting the next scene.Overall, I recommend the film. It could give us important perspectives on the type of society we'd like to become, as opposed to what kind the camp(s) are likely to propogate.",4,What're the kids becoming?,1176595200,"04 15, 2007",2007,4001,"['admit', 'right', 'off', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'expected', ""'d"", 'taped', 'something', 'off', 'HBO', 'recently', 'was', 'similar', 'how', 'certain', 'religious', 'activists', 'are', 'influencing', 'guess', 'expected', 'be', 'more', 'well', 'frightening.So', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'critic', 'had', 'pointed', 'out', 'rather', 'obese', 'preacher', 'referring', 'beginning', 'ironically', 'someone', 'fasting', 'not', 'much', 'there', 'got', 'answer', 'have', 'ever', 'dealt', 'fundamentalists', 'course', 'have', 'answer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reason', 'it.The', 'real', 'subject', 'film', 'was', 'children', 'whom', 'Ms.', 'Fisher', 'attempting', 'have', 'great', 'influence', 'start', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'articulate', 'One', 'short', 'hair', 'pony', 'tail', 'just', 'hairstyle', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'young', 'guy', 'conservative', 'background', 'articulateness', 'was', 'mixed', 'extreme', 'emotion', 'camp', 'experiences', 'were', 'crying', 'quivering', 'Oh', 'must', ""n't"", 'forget', 'speakers', 'often', 'rambled', 'tongues', 'something', 'always', 'made', ""C'mon"", ""'re"", 'claiming', 'something', 'inspired', 'Nonsense', 'A', 'chimp', 'puppy', 'can', 'do', 'Anyway', 'kids', 'repeatedly', 'referred', 'warriors', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'frightening', 'camp', 'difference', 'say', 'Christian', 'Muslim', 'Jewish', 'fundamentalists', 'neglible', 'best', 'Kevin', 'Phillips', 'least', 'one', 'books', 'points', 'out', 'reinforce', 'other', 'Warrior', 'violence', 'violence', 'violence', 'same', 'matter', 'what', 'cause', 'manifestation', 'extremism', 'Later', 'program', 'film', 'introduces', 'now', 'infamous', 'Ted', 'Haggart', 'out', 'are', 'got', 'numbers', 'correct', 'two', 'churches', 'opening', 'day', 'doctrine', 'thing', 'brought', 'chuckle', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'three', 'denominations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'specify', 'here', 'many', 'years', 'claim', 'are', 'fastest', 'growing', 'churches', 'country', 'claim', 'more', 'more', 'adherents', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'must', 'be', 'nice', 'illusion.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'pro-choice', 'ideology', 'producers', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'buy', 'what', 'was', 'obvious', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'part', 'DVD', 'preoccupation', 'fundamentalists', 'abortion', 'preoccupation', 'became', 'obvious', 'when', 'mistachioed', 'adult', 'speaker', 'Life', 't-shirt', 'addressed', 'kids', 'camp', 'then', 'continued', 'throughout.As', 'liberal', 'agenda', 'producers', 'woven', 'theme', 'was', 'election', 'Alito', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'bench', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'pro-choice', 'commentary', 'challenge', 'fundamentalists', 'perhaps', 'excessive', 'influence', 'over', 'something', 'as', 'important', 'choice', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'justice', 'inferably', 'other', 'offices', 'e.g.', 'presidency.And', 'inclusion', 'stars', 'Christian', 'crosses', 'kids', 'recitiation', 'pledges', 'allegiance', 'Christian', 'flag', 'bible', 'were', 'paraphrases', 'traditional', 'pledge', 'allegiance', 'were', 'poignant', 'display', 'political', 'agenda', 'kids', 'teachers', 'Woven', 'film', 'too', 'was', 'commentary', 'radio', 'announcer', 'whom', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'first', 'commented', 'role', 'Christian', 'so', 'later', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'guy', 'was', 'ally', 'rival', 'fundamentalist', 'message', 'Right', 'here', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'role', 'let', 'see', 'film', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'was', ""'ll"", 'point', 'out', 'advocate', 'separation', 'church', 'state', 'something', 'Ms.', 'Fisher', 'zealously', 'liked', 'music', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'as', 'ominous', 'critics', 'felt', 'kept', 'awaiting', 'next', 'scene.Overall', 'recommend', 'film', 'could', 'give', 'important', 'perspectives', 'type', 'society', ""'d"", 'like', 'become', 'opposed', 'what', 'kind', 'camp', 's', 'are', 'likely', 'propogate']",Jesus Camp
1035318,A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B000KLQUV2,"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev.""","[7, 24]","Jesus Camp is the story of young children growing up Pentecostal.  They speak in tongues, quiver on the floor, try to share their faith with adult strangers, and the attend passionate church/camp services that blend classic pentecostal and holiness teachings (beware the sin/devils in your life!) with pro-life, pro-Creationism and skepticism about Global Warming.  The result:  a documentary that drew some hallelujahs from pentecostals, some concern from noncharismatic Christians, and a firestorm of accusations from many.I attended such camps from middle school through high school, and served as a counselor at some.  The secular left accuses Fisher (and, by implication, pentecostals and evangelicals) of abusing, brainwashing our kids, of raising up recruits for Christian jihadist/militias, and all sorts of other wild-eyed, foolishness.  Frankly, I'm at a loss.  I fear for a society that could so quickly condemn and lash out at a religious movement with a 120+ year history, and half a billion adherents worldwide (nearly 10% of the worlds population).  Whether the passion and exuberance of pentecostalism is truly frightening to some, or the hatred of socially conservative politics drives opponents of the religiosity displayed in this film, I found the responses frightening.Some have asked what would become of these children, subjected to such psychological atrocities.  In my case, it led me to becoming a chaplain in one of our national prisons, working with Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, and a whole range of Christians--from Catholic, to liturgical, to fundamentalists.  Most people think I'm a decent fellow.The film itself was skewed (music can make the sacred seem ominous), but not unreasonable.  The producers were a secular Jew and a mildly observant Catholic.  We would not expect them to fully understand us.  The one disappointment was an over-emphasis on politics.1.  Yes, most evangelicals are pro-life--religiously, passionately so.  However, teaching our children why is no more indoctrination than getting young elementary school students to write their congresspeople about global warming.2.  The kids were not praying TO Bush, but rather FOR him.  The commentary tract had the producers explaining this, and that, yes, they would have prayed for Clinton or Kerry too.On a very positive note, Fisher's camps and this films footage did show the pentecostal prototype.  Most Pentecostal kids programs are not this pentecostal.  These kids, by our understanding, showed incredible spiritual maturity.  Those who do not understand religious fervor and emotion would do well to ask us about it, rather than immediate condemn it as brainwashing, indoctrination, etc.Bottom-line:  Jesus Camp was an intelligent and provocative documentary on pentecostal Christianity in America.

To witness a child as young as 5 weeping almost to the point of hyperventilating, as he accounts of his ""salvation"" from his ""sins"". He's FIVE!And yet, according to the cult of Christianity, he was conceived in sin. He was damned before he was formed in the womb. All, by god's will. (Psalm 51:5)This camp's directors and staff admit they are the terrorist zealot Muslim's equivalent, as their intention is to indoctrinate young Christians to be just as zealous as the terrorists Muslim children, in defense of the realm of Christ.So that if a holy war breaks out radical Christian's are just as armed and ready as are radical Muslims.  The war of two factions within the Abrahamic trinity.Jesus Camp came under fire after this feature movie presentation was broadcast in part, on national television some years ago, as part of an investigative news program's attempt at shedding light on religious radicals in America.As a consequence of that programs exposure of JC's agenda, and JC's own responsibility in producing what was a theatrical movie in limited release in the U.S. (and now a DVD), Jesus Camp (JC) had to relocate to an undisclosed location, for all the harassment they received due to the child abuse, cult indoctrination techniques, etc... that was exhibited as child abuse in this program.All in the name of Jesus who, like himself as his own father god, and as in the name of terrorist Islam who call that same god ""Allah"", is a Deity for whom sin filled mortals are inspired to believe needs their violent intercession in order to proclaim his dominion over his created earth and people. He needs humans to kick arse in order to prove he's omnipotent god.What a laugh. And yet in the case of mutilating the intellect of young children through the hardwire programming of cult ideology, what a horrific case of child abuse and travesty for our global future.Imagine a god of peace.One that will never be found in Christianity.

1035321,A1XBYZX09V1OB4,B000KLQUV2,Valerie J. Saturen,"[3, 3]","""Jesus Camp"" is a genuinely frightening documentary about an evangelical summer camp in North Dakota. Shocking scenes abound amid constant talk of ""washing oneself in the blood of Christ"" (this familiar lingo is why I call this brand of evangelicalism a ""blood cult""). The children are spurred on into an emotional frenzy of tears, flailing, and speaking in tongues; they're made up in camouflage clothing and face paint, and in a chilling testament to the militancy of the ""Christian soldier"" credo, brandish spears in an eerie dance to a song that cries for war. Becky Fischer, the camp's leader, speaks candidly about the need to train Christian children to be as intensely committed as Palestinian kids who gladly go to their deaths for Islam. And watching this footage, it's not difficult to imagine her vision becoming a reality. One has to acknowledge that this particular group represents fundamentalist Christianity pushed to some of its furthest extremes, beyond what you'd find with most evangelical churches. Yet it's not a very far stretch. The militancy and the genuine brainwashing that the movie depicts are very real, and more common than many people realize.It isn't the camp's right-wing ideology that makes the film disturbing; it's the fact that this is a movement that seeks out the most vulnerable among us. As the movie shows, it is a movement that zeroes in on children, because they're vulnerable. It's not that kids are stupid; it's that they have a far greater capacity to blur the line between reality and imagination, and thus to get ""into"" things in a way adults can do only with painstaking indoctrination. This is why kids make such especially fearless and cruel soldiers, as demonstrated by the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In ""Jesus Camp,"" the kids are sent out to use their disarming cuteness in recruiting new members and staging political demonstrations against abortion. They stand in front of the White House, mouths taped with the word ""LIFE."" As young children, they can't be expressing their own well-formed opinions; they're simply being exploited.Adding to the tragedy of such exploitation is the fact that several of the kids are clearly talented and perceptive for their age, so it seems an even greater shame that they're being indoctrinated instead of nourished as critical thinkers. Levi, a 12-year-old, has an extraordinary talent for public speaking; Rachael, who's nine, is unusually perceptive about people and has an intuitive understanding of psychology. Even Becky, the leader, is obviously an excellent teacher, or would be if she weren't crazy.As someone who's researched Christian Zionism, I was interested to note one scene where some of the kids recite the Pledge of Allegiance before three flags: an American flag, a Christian flag emblazoned with a cross, and an Israeli flag.",5,Disturbing Glimpse Into a Growing Movement,1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,2851,"['Jesus', 'Camp', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'documentary', 'evangelical', 'summer', 'camp', 'North', 'Dakota', 'Shocking', 'scenes', 'abound', 'constant', 'talk', 'washing', 'blood', 'Christ', 'familiar', 'lingo', 'why', 'call', 'brand', 'evangelicalism', 'blood', 'cult', 'children', 'are', 'spurred', 'emotional', 'frenzy', 'tears', 'flailing', 'speaking', 'tongues', ""'re"", 'made', 'up', 'camouflage', 'clothing', 'face', 'paint', 'chilling', 'testament', 'militancy', 'Christian', 'soldier', 'credo', 'brandish', 'spears', 'eerie', 'dance', 'song', 'war', 'Becky', 'Fischer', 'camp', 'leader', 'candidly', 'need', 'train', 'Christian', 'children', 'be', 'intensely', 'committed', 'Palestinian', 'kids', 'who', 'gladly', 'go', 'deaths', 'Islam', 'watching', 'footage', 'not', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'vision', 'becoming', 'reality', 'One', 'acknowledge', 'particular', 'group', 'fundamentalist', 'Christianity', 'pushed', 'furthest', 'extremes', 'what', ""'d"", 'find', 'most', 'evangelical', 'churches', 'not', 'very', 'far', 'stretch', 'militancy', 'genuine', 'brainwashing', 'movie', 'depicts', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'more', 'common', 'many', 'people', 'realize.It', ""n't"", 'camp', 'right-wing', 'ideology', 'film', 'disturbing', 'fact', 'movement', 'out', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'movie', 'movement', 'children', ""'re"", 'vulnerable', 'not', 'kids', 'are', 'stupid', 'have', 'far', 'greater', 'capacity', 'blur', 'line', 'reality', 'imagination', 'thus', 'get', 'things', 'way', 'adults', 'can', 'do', 'only', 'painstaking', 'indoctrination', 'why', 'kids', 'make', 'such', 'especially', 'fearless', 'cruel', 'soldiers', 'demonstrated', 'civil', 'wars', 'Liberia', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'kids', 'are', 'sent', 'use', 'disarming', 'cuteness', 'recruiting', 'new', 'members', 'staging', 'political', 'demonstrations', 'abortion', 'stand', 'front', 'White', 'House', 'mouths', 'taped', 'word', 'LIFE', 'young', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expressing', 'own', 'well-formed', 'opinions', ""'re"", 'simply', 'being', 'exploited.Adding', 'tragedy', 'such', 'exploitation', 'fact', 'several', 'kids', 'are', 'clearly', 'talented', 'perceptive', 'age', 'even', 'greater', 'shame', ""'re"", 'being', 'indoctrinated', 'instead', 'nourished', 'critical', 'thinkers', 'Levi', '12-year-old', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'public', 'speaking', 'Rachael', 'who', 'nine', 'unusually', 'perceptive', 'people', 'intuitive', 'understanding', 'psychology', 'Even', 'Becky', 'leader', 'obviously', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'would', 'be', 'were', ""n't"", 'crazy.As', 'someone', 'who', 'researched', 'Christian', 'Zionism', 'was', 'interested', 'note', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'kids', 'recite', 'Pledge', 'Allegiance', 'three', 'flags', 'American', 'flag', 'Christian', 'flag', 'emblazoned', 'cross', 'Israeli', 'flag']",Jesus Camp
1035322,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000KLQUV2,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[19, 23]","Thought provoking and alarming in many respects, ""Jesus Camp"" presents its story with amazing fair balance; we see the Christian camps where science is questioned, the values of the secular world are challenged and Christian Soliders are created and we also hear from (all too infrequently)radio talk host Mike Papantonio (who is a Christian himself but a liberal as opposed to the conversatives presented that run and attend the Jesus camps portrayed in the film)who questions this uncomfortable intermingling of politics, anti-science and religion. As the filmmakers point out we all live in our own little box--cutting us off from more extreme viewpoints. Despite preacher Becky Fisher's good qualities, ""Jesus Camp"" presents a place where children are as brain washed as if in a Communist re-education camp. The values that are taught about honesty are laudable but much of this goes frighteningly over the edge. The scenes of the children at camp remind me of the brainwashing that occurs with the Nazis and other extremist groups. The film director's present it all without judging the movement but just about anyone would be disturbed the some of the comments and content. The scenes where the home-schooled children are taught that global warming doesn't exist (using rhetoric vs. deductive logic)and where the line is blurred between science and faith (the creationist arguments)and where the family performs a ""pledge of alligance"" to a flag with a white cross on it is indeed disturbing moving beyond the bounds of saying grace or giving thanks to fanaticism.The DVD presents deleted scenes (some of which are as alarming and strange as those presented in the film) along with a commentary track by the filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady. Like Grady, I was raised as a Catholic so seeing this extremism was scary to me in many respects. Their comments are often insightful and fascinating. While both women clearly admired Becky Fischer's ability as a speaker, amazingly they were able to restrain themselves from discussing their personal viewpoint on what she is doing.It's also frightening to me how George Bush and the many political leaders are made out to be soliders on the march for God--it brings us one step closer to the madness of a holy war and also deifies people who have manipulated the belief system that drives (according to the filmmakers) at least 80 million Americans. While the secular values that Hollywood and the mainstream media often sells may be vapid, this extreme reaction isn't the key to creating a world of tolerance without violence towards others and is just as vapid, manipulative and empty in its own, perverse way.As the filmmakers point out we clearly live in a diverse world where we insulate ourselves from the diversity around us. That is exactly the type of environment that allows Facism, Nazism and Holocaust-like events to come into being and even flourish with the support of the people. Insolation doesn't solve the world's problem nor does the often extreme views presented from the evangelical Christians presented in this film. In many respects, ""Jesus Camp"" taught me that I really know a lot less about my fellow Americans than I thought and that some of them are really frightening. I'm concerned about these individuals ""taking back America"".

The filmmakers ably walk a tightrope without revealing how THEY truly feel about it. I'm sure they understand there are parents who would like to own this and feel PROUD of what Fischer is doing, and don't want to alienate that section of the buying public. What Fischer and her ilk are doing is an affront to decency, humanity, and psychological well-being. Everyone should see this and witness the horror being perpetrated upon American children today.

At first blush this seems innocuous enough - teach children about Jesus, Christianity and how to lead society towards a more moral and brighter future. Dig a little deeper and you will find a festering boil of hatred, radical right-wing inculcation and militant Christianity. I am not exaggerating in the slightest - Becky herself concedes her desire to transform her innocent and impressionable charges into soldiers for Jesus willing to lay down her lives as Islamic fundamentalists do (oddly enough, there do not seem to be very many Christian adults willing to take Becky's advice). Any compassionate parent would be appalled at this attitude, but for Becky and the extreme fundamentalist crowd, it simply comes with the territory.Her exact words: ""It's no wonder, with that kind of intense training and discipling, that those young people are ready to kill themselves for the cause of Islam. I wanna see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam. I wanna see them as radically laying down their lives for the Gospel as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine and all those different places, you know, because we have... excuse me, but we have the truth!""She even admits, up front, that no amount of reasoning, arguments or evidence can sway her from her rigid, dogmatic beliefs.Homeschooling gets a sizable focus, and this is more disturbing than life in a closed Amish community (at least to my mind). The Amish do not seek violence, oppression or unquestioned control over dissenting groups. These students have been taught to accept Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck as authority figures on par with the god they worship. Worse still, Ted Haggard has profound authority and influence at these and other similar events (such as megachurch sermons). Children are induced to chant exhortations to their god to end abortion and keep Republicans in Congress and god-fearing Christians in the Whitehouse.One of the more devout campers, Levi, fasts regularly to be closer to god. As any doctor will tell you, this is not safe for a young teenager about to enter their growth spurt. Once again, religion abuses children. The ten commandments exalts this with this one-sided edict: Respect your mother and father.It gets worse. The most disturbing scene had Fischer condemning Harry Potter for being ""a wizard"" and dismissing his heroic and selfless deeds. This is the core of Christianity - it's not what you do that counts. It's not how many lives you save or how profoundly you improve the world. It's all about who you are. If you're a Christian, eternal hedonism awaits. If you're not, well, too bad. There's something far less pleasant for you and your ilk.I cannot recommend this movie enough, but I must warn viewers to be prepared for the worst. This will not be entertaining for any except the most extreme dogmatists.

I went to these children's revivals and camps and grew up believing that anyone who doesn't believe in my God was going to hell and that I should be ready to die for the cause of Jesus. I am a fim believer that this type of indoctrination is the wrong answer. As someone who grew up that way, I found it devastating once I got into the real world and became aware of what other religions were really about, and that there was no way that all those people who are of different religions and who are good people are going to hell, simply for not believing the way I did.What pastor becky fisher and these other adults don't seem to understand is that you can teach kids anything and they will believe it. That's why there are kids in Iraq and Afghanistan who are willing to emplace IEDs and strap on suicide bombs... because someone indoctrinated them to believe that it's the ""truth"", just like Becky Fisher was certain that ""I'm sorry, but we have the truth!""I grew up in a community much like the one in this film, and most of the kids I grew up with are now very much aware that reality is far from what we were taught. I know some people who learned the hard way in college and in their jobs that the world is not as simple as ""either you're with God or you're against Him."" And it's sad that grown people are still willing to raise their kids to believe so.I won't say I'm traumatized from growing up that way, but I am a little bitter, because I missed out on a normal american childhood. I turned out okay, a productive citizen, an Army soldier, and currently serving in Iraq. However, I look back on my childhood and I know my kids won't grow up that way. They will be educated, not only in secular education, but also in world religions so that they will be aware of what's out there, and they can make their own choices as to what they believe in.If these extremist Christians are so convinced that they hold the truth, why are they afraid to let them see what else is out there? Won't the truth prevail, no matter what else the kids are exposed to? Where is the faith in that? Why should you raise your kids to be single-minded and ignorant to other beliefs if you believe that you have the truth anyway?And just one more thing I wanted to put out there: terrorists are not working for the cause of Islam like Becky Fisher said. They work for extremists who falsely claim the name of Islam, because Islam is a religion of peace. This is the kind of lie that will raise kids to discriminate and hate other religions. Christians complain that they are being persecuted all the time, meanwhile they are persecuting every other religion, trying to get their beliefs out of the country, which by the way is a free country where everyone should be free to practice their religion, faith, and beliefs.",5,"Scary, Gut-wrenching",1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,2865,"['What', 'so', 'scary', 'film', 'grew', 'up', 'went', 'children', 'revivals', 'camps', 'grew', 'up', 'believing', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'was', 'going', 'hell', 'should', 'be', 'ready', 'die', 'cause', 'Jesus', 'am', 'fim', 'believer', 'type', 'indoctrination', 'wrong', 'answer', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'way', 'found', 'devastating', 'once', 'got', 'real', 'world', 'became', 'aware', 'what', 'other', 'religions', 'were', 'really', 'about', 'was', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'religions', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'hell', 'simply', 'not', 'believing', 'way', 'did.What', 'pastor', 'becky', 'fisher', 'other', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'can', 'teach', 'kids', 'anything', 'will', 'believe', 'why', 'are', 'kids', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'emplace', 'IEDs', 'strap', 'suicide', 'bombs', 'someone', 'indoctrinated', 'believe', 'truth', 'just', 'Becky', 'Fisher', 'was', 'certain', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'truth', 'grew', 'up', 'community', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'are', 'now', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'reality', 'far', 'what', 'were', 'taught', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'learned', 'hard', 'way', 'college', 'jobs', 'world', 'not', 'as', 'simple', ""'re"", 'God', ""'re"", 'Him', 'sad', 'grown', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'willing', 'raise', 'kids', 'believe', 'so.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'traumatized', 'growing', 'up', 'way', 'am', 'little', 'bitter', 'missed', 'out', 'normal', 'american', 'childhood', 'turned', 'out', 'okay', 'productive', 'citizen', 'Army', 'soldier', 'currently', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'However', 'look', 'back', 'childhood', 'know', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'educated', 'not', 'only', 'secular', 'education', 'also', 'world', 'religions', 'will', 'be', 'aware', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'choices', 'what', 'believe', 'extremist', 'Christians', 'are', 'so', 'convinced', 'hold', 'truth', 'why', 'are', 'afraid', 'let', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'there', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'truth', 'prevail', 'matter', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'exposed', 'Where', 'faith', 'Why', 'should', 'raise', 'kids', 'be', 'single-minded', 'ignorant', 'other', 'beliefs', 'believe', 'have', 'truth', 'anyway', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'wanted', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'terrorists', 'are', 'not', 'working', 'cause', 'Islam', 'Becky', 'Fisher', 'said', 'work', 'extremists', 'who', 'falsely', 'claim', 'name', 'Islam', 'Islam', 'religion', 'peace', 'kind', 'lie', 'will', 'raise', 'kids', 'discriminate', 'hate', 'other', 'religions', 'Christians', 'complain', 'are', 'being', 'persecuted', 'time', 'meanwhile', 'are', 'persecuting', 'other', 'religion', 'trying', 'get', 'beliefs', 'country', 'way', 'free', 'country', 'where', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'practice', 'religion', 'faith', 'beliefs']",Jesus Camp

1035330,AHPH1L46OHNE5,B000KLQUV2,Zane A. Undercoffer,"[3, 4]","This is a proper documentary. What I mean by that, there is no narration. Really the movie has barely any injected textual facts, and usually only to depict locations and people. What I find brilliant about that is no one is telling you any assumption. It's left up to the individual mostly to form their opinions.This documentary is about evangelical christians in america. It's set in roughly 2006? I believe it's middle of the second term of bush, and towards the end deals with the evangelical response to the nomination of a supreme court judge.It should be noted this movie is deeply disturbing. As well it should be. This sort of religious zealotry has made large regions of this country truly terrifying for those that don't fall in line with a specific belief structure. These types are specifically and aggressively seeking economic, socio, and political power to replace the government with one they're more ""comfortable"" with. If your faith is one of a more moderate christian stance this movie will hopefully sicken you. You have kids under 10 being taught a strong anti-abortion stance. That may sound good (if you're pro-life), until you realize these are first-third graders (and younger) turned *legion* against a topic they can't possibly understand. Some call it brainwashing, the real term for it is indoctrination. Your church does it to a degree, every church and faith does. But this is turned up to 11. It will make you deeply question the role your faith plays on your children's upbringing. If you are a more moderate christian I have to wonder what that emotional dynamic is like after watching a movie like this. They technically don't follow any different faith than you. They just execute it differently. Those at the top are pulling the strings differently towards their ideal socio-economic ideals. Though that's honestly par for the course for religions, and why this country specifically was formed without a national religion and one of the main tenants of it's government being separation of church and state.As an atheist, this movie is so, deeply, troubling. It's one of those rare pieces that without drawing a conclusion for you, will rock you to your very core. It makes me ache knowing there are people (largely in the south and fly over states) who are forced to live double lives because so much of their day to day livelihoods depends on it. What I find most insanely troubling is the blatant rejection of science. Believing it's a lie and a conspiracy. Yet all of these people drive cars, use the internet, live in houses, have mega churches with power point and projectors. They indoctrinate their children from the get-go to reject science...how do they think society will function without science? I think the answer is quite sinister, those at the top do realize it can't. But having a largely uneducated populace is easier to control and sway towards your political goals.Thankfully this movie was set nearly 10 years ago. We no longer have a zealot right wing president. Ted haggard (who during this film's period wasn't disgraced yet) has since been disgraced and a large shadow has been cast on these types.

1035331,A10W40DOIE1EOP,B000KLQUV2,Zelie Nic,"[3, 3]","I first heard about this film when I saw a small segment about it on CNN while I was getting ready to head out to work.  Of course I was intrigued because I had experienced some 'mega-churches' first-hand in the early ninties prior to their becoming a nationally recognized phenomenon.  Coming from the solemn, tradition-based Catholic church, my grandmother's evangelical group appeared goofy to me.  This wasn't only because I saw their casual church (complete with indoor basketball court) pandering to a other-wise uniterested congregation, but because I had left oragnized religion behind some years before...I'm sure that a lot of the audience are outside the world of organized religion and are viewing this documentary in order toget a glimpse of people ""behaving strangley.""  To these people, the young boy with the rat-tail is a walking joke.But are the actions taken by the parents and the other adults in ""Jesus Camp"" more indoctrinary in nature than most anything else we get our children to do?  I don't know.  Sure.  I had a problem with the way children were targeted, but what bothered me more was the fact that, throughout the film, I never saw, nor heard The Bible being discussed.  In fact, most of the activities the film shows the children doing at the camp are kinetic actions of commitment; symbolic faith and little else.Of course, the trouble with a documentary is that so much is lost or spun in the process of editing.  Perhaps these children do study The Bible.  Perhaps they do discuss the lessons of Christ and what-not.  I don't know.This documentary does succeed in presenting the Camp, plus a dissenting view from someone within the Christian community (in the form of a talk radio host).  I was glad that this movie lacked a man-in-front-of-the-camera host-of-sorts.  The slant of the maker is undeniably set against the camp, but at least its more subtle than having a host come up and tell you.According to the radio host (whose name I can't remember) one in four Americans consider themselves to be evangelical christians; to what degree is unknown.  However, as you're watching ""Jesus Camp"" the statistic does become... almost forboding.I really did like the film, even though it bothered me.  Maybe I wanted to be bothered though, as I did know aforehand what the film was about.  I'm sure others felt the same way.  Though I doubt I'll ever become a member of any sort of religion again, I do maintain a reverence for Jesus because, really, if people took the time to adhere to his teachings... well, how could you complain?Oh yes.  This movie features a song which I would guess is called ""Kickin' it for Christ."" It is hilarious.  You can't miss it as the song is played as the group gathers for the first time at the camp.God bless the PowerPoint presentation, and God bless this review.",4,Let's the subjects speak for themselves,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,2831,"['first', 'heard', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'small', 'segment', 'CNN', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'head', 'out', 'work', 'course', 'was', 'intrigued', 'had', 'experienced', ""'mega-churches"", 'first-hand', 'early', 'ninties', 'prior', 'becoming', 'nationally', 'recognized', 'phenomenon', 'Coming', 'solemn', 'tradition-based', 'Catholic', 'church', 'grandmother', 'evangelical', 'group', 'appeared', 'goofy', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'saw', 'casual', 'church', 'complete', 'indoor', 'basketball', 'court', 'pandering', 'other-wise', 'uniterested', 'congregation', 'had', 'left', 'oragnized', 'religion', 'years', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'audience', 'are', 'world', 'organized', 'religion', 'are', 'viewing', 'documentary', 'order', 'toget', 'glimpse', 'people', 'behaving', 'strangley', 'people', 'young', 'boy', 'rat-tail', 'walking', 'joke.But', 'are', 'actions', 'taken', 'parents', 'other', 'adults', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'more', 'indoctrinary', 'nature', 'most', 'anything', 'else', 'get', 'children', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sure', 'had', 'problem', 'way', 'children', 'were', 'targeted', 'what', 'bothered', 'more', 'was', 'fact', 'film', 'never', 'saw', 'heard', 'Bible', 'being', 'discussed', 'fact', 'most', 'activities', 'film', 'children', 'doing', 'camp', 'are', 'kinetic', 'actions', 'commitment', 'symbolic', 'faith', 'little', 'else.Of', 'course', 'trouble', 'documentary', 'so', 'much', 'lost', 'spun', 'process', 'editing', 'Perhaps', 'children', 'do', 'study', 'Bible', 'Perhaps', 'do', 'discuss', 'lessons', 'Christ', 'what-not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.This', 'documentary', 'succeed', 'presenting', 'Camp', 'dissenting', 'view', 'someone', 'Christian', 'community', 'form', 'talk', 'radio', 'host', 'was', 'glad', 'movie', 'lacked', 'man-in-front-of-the-camera', 'host-of-sorts', 'slant', 'maker', 'undeniably', 'set', 'camp', 'least', 'more', 'subtle', 'having', 'host', 'come', 'up', 'tell', 'you.According', 'radio', 'host', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'four', 'Americans', 'consider', 'be', 'evangelical', 'christians', 'what', 'degree', 'unknown', 'However', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'statistic', 'become', 'almost', 'forboding.I', 'really', 'did', 'film', 'even', 'bothered', 'Maybe', 'wanted', 'be', 'bothered', 'though', 'did', 'know', 'aforehand', 'what', 'film', 'was', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'become', 'member', 'sort', 'religion', 'again', 'do', 'maintain', 'reverence', 'Jesus', 'really', 'people', 'took', 'time', 'adhere', 'teachings', 'well', 'how', 'could', 'complain', 'Oh', 'yes', 'movie', 'song', 'would', 'guess', 'called', 'Kickin', 'Christ', 'hilarious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'song', 'played', 'group', 'gathers', 'first', 'time', 'camp.God', 'PowerPoint', 'presentation', 'God', 'bless', 'review']",Jesus Camp

It's a very troubling documentary, mostly because it doesn't bring a ready-made point of view to the film. The filmmakers aren't asking you to feel one way or the other about the subjects of the documentary. They're simply presenting a slice of Christian fundamentalist life to light.What you're seeing can hardly be qualified as anything besides brainwashing and even border-line insanity. The leader of the camp gets kids to speak in tongues, makes them cry by telling them what terrible sinners they are (these are children, not even pre-teens), and at one point has them speaking in tongues while laying their hands on a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush. A lot of this stuff just seems unreal.Arguably, the best part of the documentary is that it includes a brief interview with Ted Haggard, PRE-meth and homosexual prostitute scandal. He's preaching before his congregation, and looking into the camera, condemning homosexuality and other forms of sin, while, we've now discovered, he was carrying on that very lifestyle.Jesus Camp makes a point without trying to make a point. By presenting evangelical Christians raw, without giving their own opinions or condemnation of their lifestlye and actions, they really reveal the hypocritical nature and denial of reality that these people have. (Global warming is not real, but a car wash can be blessed by jesus).If you're at all interested in seeing into the secret world of evangelical christians, and the scene in Borat didn't give you enough speaking in tongues and yelling preachers, check out Jesus Camp.
