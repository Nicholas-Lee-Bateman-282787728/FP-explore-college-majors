Sometimes you'll find a rare gem but most of the time it won't even be worth remembering. Remember all those PROPHECY sequels? That's what I thought. Anyway, I'm happy to say that MIMIC SENTINEL falls into the rare gem category. I had absolutely no idea what to expect with this one nor do I know why I even rented it after hating MIMIC 2 so much and the fact that I'm not even that big of a fan of the original. But I'm glad I did.It goes something like this. Strickland disease (which was established in the first film) survivor Martin (Karl Geary) suffers from extreme environmental sensitivity making it hard for him to leave his room in the apartment he shares with his mother (Amanda Plummer) and his sister, Rosy (Alexis Dziena). So, he obsessively takes photographs of the world outside his window and, as you might have guessed, eventually learns that the Judas Bugs are back once again. While it's absolutely no mystery that the plot of this film borrows more than a little from Alfred Hitchkock's REAR WINDOW, the film really works. While I've always found the MIMIC bugs rather creepy, this film seemed to really capitalize on that and make a genuinely scary, suspense building movie out of them.Rookie filmmaker and screenwriter (he also wrote and directed the as of yet unreleased indie SOFT FOR DIGGING) J.T. Petty has what it takes to tell a good story and make an entertaining film. Instead of trying to make a crappy film that requires more money than he had to work with, Petty made a good, small film that was within his means. By getting rid of a lot of the special effects (even though there are a few) and different locations, Petty lets the viewer become engrossed in the characters and lets them feel the paranoia that Marvin experiences. Instead of just watching the film, the viewer becomes a voyeur right along with Marvin. Later in the film, even after Marvin's voyeuristic journey is over, the director shoots the film with a blackened ring around the corners of the TV as if your now watching Marvin from an apartment across the street as Marvin did to others earlier in the film. For me, this worked to great effect. I felt like I was watching someone in danger and wasn't getting up to do anything about it. While I felt the whole Lance Henrisken aspect of the film was a bit unnecessary, for the most part the film really worked for me. So as for director J.T. Petty, I'm going to place him in my directors to watch book. I mean, if he can make a good sequel to a movie about giant bugs then I'm convinced he's capable of anything.C+",3,"With MIMIC 3, director J.T.

His direction more so than his writing really struck me, although The Burrowers is an impressive film and recommended viewing for horror fans.  Mimic Sentinel is not quite as successful and heavily influenced by Hitchcock's Rear Window, which provides a nice platform for Petty to show off his talented eye for setting up shots and capturing a dark and creepy mood.  The film has a compelling sense of style, which overshadows the merely functional dialogue.  Unsurprisingly, Mimic Sentinel was put together quickly and on minimal budget.  The haste in which the film was made might be the best excuse for the perfunctory, rather unbelievable climax.  As a writer/director, Petty either needs to amp up the writing a bit or find help.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Imagine Alfred Hitchcock's  ""Read Window""... but instead of a murderer in the other apartments, there's a giant shape-shifting human-sized bug.So goes the plot for ""Mimic 3: Sentinel,"" which tries to mix up the formula by switching to a more murder-mysteryish format. It's an admirable attempt with some decent performances (especially by the lead actor) but it feels strangely like the lost pilot of a ""Mimic"" TV show, and both the climax and the character development feel pretty rushed.As a child, Marvin (Karl Geary) was one of the last survivors of a roach-borne disease. Now he has to live in a specially sterilized room in his family's apartment, which he can only briefly leave. So he spends his days photographing his neighbors from afar. His favorite targets are his drug-dabbling sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena), his neighbor Carmen (Rebecca Mader) and a weirdo he calls the Garbageman (Lance Henriksen).But before long, Marvin realizes that the people he's observing are vanishing. But when he contacts the police, the cop they send is more interested in having sex with Marvin's mom (Amanda Plummer) than in investigating a possible crime. As Marvin, Rosie and Carmen investigate the disappearances, they find that the real culprit is not even human, but a Judas bug...Director JT Petty is to be commended for breaking with the ""Mimic"" formula of the first two movies -- and not just a little break, but breaking almost all the way. It takes a lot of guts to reimagine the story of the Judas beetles from an ""ordinary"" person's perspective, and try to model it after the classic Hitchcock movie ""Rear Window."" Except without James Stewart, and things definitely do move outside the room.Unfortunately, ""Mimic 3"" doesn't QUITE work out. The story's biggest problem is that it seems like the pilot for a ""Mimic"" TV show -- at times it feels like an X-Files episode that they simply forgot to write Mulder and Scully into. Additionally, the climax seems to simply bounce out of nowhere, and the movie ends before you have a chance to realize that... well, that it IS the climax.However, Perry does an excellent job with the various actors, all of whom give nicely nuanced performances -- particularly Geary, playing a character who is allergic to everything, yet is desperate to experience the outside world. The problem is, those characters are not developed in the right places. For instance, it's never explained why Carmen is so attracted to Marvin, especially when she finds out he's been photographing her from afar like a creeper.""Mimic 3"" boldly strikes out where no Mimic movie has gone before, but the execution has some big hiccups. Still, it's a less sexist sequel than ""Mimic 2.""",2,He's watching them,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2698,"['Imagine', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Read', 'Window', 'instead', 'murderer', 'other', 'apartments', 'giant', 'shape-shifting', 'human-sized', 'bug.So', 'plot', 'Mimic', '3', 'Sentinel', 'mix', 'up', 'formula', 'switching', 'more', 'murder-mysteryish', 'format', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'decent', 'performances', 'especially', 'lead', 'actor', 'strangely', 'lost', 'pilot', 'Mimic', 'TV', 'show', 'climax', 'character', 'development', 'feel', 'pretty', 'child', 'Marvin', 'Karl', 'Geary', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'survivors', 'roach-borne', 'disease', 'Now', 'live', 'specially', 'sterilized', 'room', 'family', 'apartment', 'can', 'only', 'briefly', 'leave', 'days', 'photographing', 'neighbors', 'afar', 'favorite', 'targets', 'are', 'drug-dabbling', 'sister', 'Rosy', 'Alexis', 'Dziena', 'neighbor', 'Carmen', 'Rebecca', 'Mader', 'weirdo', 'Garbageman', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', '.But', 'long', 'Marvin', 'people', 'observing', 'are', 'vanishing', 'when', 'police', 'cop', 'send', 'more', 'interested', 'having', 'sex', 'Marvin', 'mom', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'investigating', 'possible', 'crime', 'Marvin', 'Rosie', 'Carmen', 'investigate', 'disappearances', 'find', 'real', 'culprit', 'not', 'even', 'human', 'Judas', 'bug', 'Director', 'JT', 'Petty', 'be', 'commended', 'breaking', 'Mimic', 'formula', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'little', 'break', 'breaking', 'almost', 'way', 'lot', 'guts', 'reimagine', 'story', 'Judas', 'beetles', 'ordinary', 'person', 'perspective', 'try', 'model', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'Rear', 'Window', 'James', 'Stewart', 'things', 'definitely', 'do', 'move', 'room.Unfortunately', 'Mimic', '3', ""n't"", 'QUITE', 'work', 'out', 'story', 'biggest', 'problem', 'pilot', 'Mimic', 'TV', 'show', 'times', 'X-Files', 'episode', 'simply', 'forgot', 'write', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Additionally', 'climax', 'simply', 'bounce', 'nowhere', 'movie', 'have', 'chance', 'realize', 'well', 'climax.However', 'Perry', 'excellent', 'job', 'various', 'actors', 'whom', 'give', 'nicely', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Geary', 'playing', 'character', 'who', 'allergic', 'everything', 'desperate', 'experience', 'outside', 'world', 'problem', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'right', 'places', 'instance', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'Carmen', 'so', 'attracted', 'Marvin', 'especially', 'when', 'been', 'photographing', 'afar', 'creeper', 'Mimic', '3', 'boldly', 'out', 'where', 'Mimic', 'movie', 'gone', 'before', 'execution', 'big', 'hiccups', 'Still', 'less', 'sexist', 'sequel', 'Mimic', '2']",N/A
767830,A1PY4BCMI543EX,B0000ARD7S,E. Barrios,"[1, 2]","I took a chance on this movie after reading the reviews. I have to say I was surprised by the quality. The directing was good and most of the actors were pretty decent, especially the guy who played Martin; Lance Henriksen, of course, was on point.I won't give you a play-by-play because other reviewers have already done that. I will say, though, that the movie is something like ""Rear Window Meets Mimic Bug."" It was filmed in Romania, but you can find all this out on the featurette.The movie is heavy on character development so don't go expecting nonstop action from the beginning. In other words, if you're one of those low-attention-span types, then this is definitely not the movie for you. I didn't see any real hardcore gore until 45 or so minutes into it.I agree with the other reviewers in that there were a few scenes that were so dark you couldn't make out what the hell was going on. However, again, if you watch the featurette, you'd know that the director had an extremely limited budget to work with, which I gathered while watching the movie. But I think those dark scenes ultimately added to the films overall charm. It allowed the building of suspense until the excellent kill scenes at the end.As for the video quality, the film looked sharp and I didn't notice any video anomalies. Sound was fine, too.Caution: There is a disturbing scene in the featurette where one of the extras shows us around the Romanian movie lot where wild dogs roam. He shows us, while crying, some dead dogs on some grass as well as a dead puppy. I don't think he was joking. The director mentions how he was stunned by the amount of wild, yet friendly, dogs that roam the streets. I take it they live on handouts and there must not be much of that going on. So, any animal lovers be warned!In some ways, this third installment of Mimic is even more intelligently made than the first.

This was probably due in part to Guillermo Del Toro stating that he referenced that great movie as he directed the original Mimic (the bit about the little boy staring out his window as the bugs went in and out of the church across the way).  I don't think though, that he meant to supplant one for the other.  To its detriment, this installment relies entirely on the peeping Tom aspect with a less than compelling character/actor (Karl Geary), as Marvin the peeper.  After awhile, that incessant click-click-click of his camera became more than a little distracting.  Also, watching someone watching others does not make for gripping drama.  Especially when so many of those scenes were purposefully kept static, aloof.  You have a guy in a sterile white environment juxtaposed with the dark and seedy world outside and all he does is shudder and snap.  All that lost potential for suspense, clumsily mishandled because the aperture was kept so low.  They even bungled the seminal sequence of being in the wrong apartment at the wrong time and getting caught.  And who should appear at that very moment, rather late in the game?  Take the money and run Lance Henriksen.  In a plot device that literally comes from out of left field, up pops Lance as Garbageman.  Who?  What?  Why?  Yes, it's more than a little confusing and not all that important in the scheme of things.  It was a role and a performance he didn't have to break a sweat over.  Too little too late to inject any thrills into this rather pedestrian plot.  At worse, Mimic 3 is mundane.

Marvin (Karl Geary) is a survivor of Stricklers disease introduced in the original ""Mimic."" He's pretty much resigned to his bedroom and spends his time taking endless photos of the street down below and the people in the building across the street. He lives with his mom Simone (Amanda Plummer) and his sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena). People are disappearing and Marv thinks he's seeing the Judas bug but cannot convince the police. Can he save the day?As others have mentioned, this is ""Rear Window"" with bugs. Why did they bother? There isn't enough story here which probably explains the paltry 77 minute running time. But aside from that we've seen this too many times. The kid sees something...kind of, but the authorities don't take him seriously because he's cried wolf before.You could fill a book with films using that plot line. Then there's the ""Garbage Man."" Lance Henriksen plays this role and you figure he'll have a key part here but, when that part is revealed, it's not much more than a segue into a possible round four.With the limited sets it feels claustrophobic and the budget would only support a few small scenes with the bugs. Only a couple characters are hi-lighted. The rest pretty much fill the bug chow quotient. It's actually directed decently so I have to point the finger at the script as the bad boy here. And how did Amanda Plummer get involved? She usually picks nifty, quirky projects to be in. She seemed on board for the sole purpose of cashing a paycheck.This didn't hurt to watch but, when it was over, a stink filled the room.

767840,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0000ARD7S,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 1]","I was a big fan of Mimic, was moderately interested in Mimic 2, and when I discovered a third installment had been made I just had to see it.  If only to point and laugh.Mimic 3: Sentinel is short.  Real short.  And that's obviously on purpose, because the movie has little to say.  It's basically Read Window with giant bugs.  Unlike past films that have torn a page from Rear Window's script book (Disturbia being one recent example), Mimic 3 doesn't really know how to reproduce the dread of the original.Mimic 3's biggest problem is preserving the mystery of who the murderer is.  Since this is the third installment about giant killer cockroaches that masquerade as raincoat-wearing people, it's pretty clear that the bug is the killer. That, and a Mimic murders a young boy in the first five minutes. Once we know who the murderer is, the rest of the time is taken up with an idiotic cavalcade of morons just asking to be turned into bug food.There's our protagonist, who suffers from Strickland Disease, which is tied to how the bugs were created in the first place.  But really, that's not important at all and has little bearing on the plot other than to make Marvin (Karl Geary, utterly failing to adopt an American accent) a hybrid between a bubble boy and an autistic.  He takes pictures.  Lots and lots of boring pictures.  He lives with his loopy mom (Amanda Plummer) and spitfire sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena) who duck in and out of scenes while adding almost nothing to the plot.  One of the pictures Marvin takes is of Carmen (Rebecca Mader), the hottie who lives across the street.  She of course takes a liking to Marvin immediately even though he fails to demonstrate a single redeeming characteristic.There's also a cop who is romancing Marvin's mom, Detective Gary Dumars (John Kapelos). See, the whole reason Marvin doesn't go to the cops is because he's called them dozens of times already.  And because Dumars keeps assuring Marvin that he's looked into these mysterious disappearances, when he's not - it's all a ploy to impress Marvin's mom. In short, nobody will believe poor Marvin.Except for the fact that if you call 911, it's not a question of belief; a process is kicked off and cops show up, whether or not you're believable or even sane. This may be why Mimic 3 keeps having Marvin dial 911 and then HANG UP.  He does this no less than two times, presumably because he can't take a picture and listen to a phone at the same time. He also uses a camera with regular film instead of digital, so he can conveniently be away from the camera at the most inopportune moment.When Lance Henriksen shows up to kick thorax and take names, it's a mercy.  It's not in the cards for him either though, because our hero (that'd be Marvin) is the only one who can save the day.  Never mind that he has a life-threatening aversion to cigarette smoke or perfume, he can take on a bug all by himself in a room filled with choking fumes and the distinctive odor of bug juice.Mimic 3 does have its moments.  One murder scene is evocatively shot with nothing but an eerie soundtrack playing.  And poor Marvin's showdown with the Mimic involves some interesting lighting from the inside of a refrigerator.  But other than those two scenes this movie is a snooze.And that's a shame. The director is obviously trying very hard - he tries to tell a story through Marvin's pictures, he tries to reinforce Marvin's isolation through his camera, and he tries to make the best of a small budget with carefully placed shadows.  He just fails on all three counts.",2,I feel bad for the director,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,3565,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'Mimic', 'was', 'moderately', 'interested', 'Mimic', '2', 'when', 'discovered', 'third', 'installment', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'only', 'point', 'laugh.Mimic', '3', 'Sentinel', 'short', 'Real', 'short', 'obviously', 'purpose', 'movie', 'little', 'say', 'basically', 'Read', 'Window', 'giant', 'bugs', 'past', 'films', 'have', 'torn', 'page', 'Rear', 'Window', 'script', 'book', 'Disturbia', 'being', 'one', 'recent', 'example', 'Mimic', '3', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'reproduce', 'dread', 'original.Mimic', '3', 'biggest', 'problem', 'preserving', 'mystery', 'who', 'murderer', 'third', 'installment', 'giant', 'killer', 'cockroaches', 'masquerade', 'raincoat-wearing', 'people', 'pretty', 'clear', 'bug', 'killer', 'Mimic', 'murders', 'young', 'boy', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'know', 'who', 'murderer', 'rest', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'idiotic', 'cavalcade', 'morons', 'just', 'asking', 'be', 'turned', 'bug', 'protagonist', 'who', 'Strickland', 'Disease', 'tied', 'how', 'bugs', 'were', 'created', 'first', 'place', 'really', 'not', 'important', 'little', 'bearing', 'plot', 'other', 'make', 'Marvin', 'Karl', 'Geary', 'utterly', 'failing', 'adopt', 'American', 'accent', 'hybrid', 'bubble', 'boy', 'autistic', 'pictures', 'Lots', 'lots', 'boring', 'pictures', 'loopy', 'mom', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'spitfire', 'sister', 'Rosy', 'Alexis', 'Dziena', 'who', 'duck', 'scenes', 'adding', 'almost', 'nothing', 'plot', 'One', 'pictures', 'Marvin', 'Carmen', 'Rebecca', 'Mader', 'hottie', 'who', 'street', 'course', 'liking', 'Marvin', 'immediately', 'even', 'demonstrate', 'single', 'redeeming', 'characteristic.There', 'also', 'cop', 'who', 'romancing', 'Marvin', 'mom', 'Detective', 'Gary', 'Dumars', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'See', 'whole', 'reason', 'Marvin', ""n't"", 'go', 'cops', 'called', 'dozens', 'times', 'already', 'Dumars', 'assuring', 'Marvin', 'looked', 'mysterious', 'disappearances', 'when', 'not', 'ploy', 'impress', 'Marvin', 'mom', 'short', 'nobody', 'will', 'believe', 'poor', 'Marvin.Except', 'fact', 'call', '911', 'not', 'question', 'belief', 'process', 'kicked', 'off', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'not', ""'re"", 'believable', 'even', 'sane', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'Mimic', '3', 'keeps', 'having', 'Marvin', 'dial', '911', 'then', 'HANG', 'UP', 'less', 'two', 'times', 'presumably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'picture', 'listen', 'phone', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'camera', 'regular', 'film', 'instead', 'digital', 'can', 'conveniently', 'be', 'away', 'camera', 'most', 'inopportune', 'moment.When', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'up', 'kick', 'thorax', 'take', 'names', 'mercy', 'not', 'cards', 'hero', ""'d"", 'be', 'Marvin', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'mind', 'life-threatening', 'aversion', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'perfume', 'can', 'take', 'bug', 'room', 'filled', 'choking', 'fumes', 'distinctive', 'odor', 'bug', 'juice.Mimic', '3', 'have', 'moments', 'One', 'murder', 'scene', 'evocatively', 'shot', 'nothing', 'eerie', 'soundtrack', 'playing', 'poor', 'Marvin', 'showdown', 'Mimic', 'interesting', 'lighting', 'inside', 'refrigerator', 'other', 'two', 'scenes', 'movie', 'snooze.And', 'shame', 'director', 'obviously', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'tell', 'story', 'Marvin', 'pictures', 'reinforce', 'Marvin', 'isolation', 'camera', 'make', 'best', 'small', 'budget', 'carefully', 'placed', 'shadows', 'just', 'fails', 'three', 'counts']",N/A

767846,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000ARD7S,trebe,"[0, 0]","Directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, The Devil's Backbone), and based on a story by Donald A. Wollheim, Mimic (1997) was a big budget Hollywood production that first introduced the Judas Breed, a giant roachlike creature with the ability to ""mimic"" the appearance of man.  The bugs returned to terrorize New York in Mimic 2 (2001), and are back for round 3 in Mimic Sentinel (2003), a direct to video production filmed in Romania.According to director J.T. Perry, he was approached with the idea of melding the Mimic creature, with a situation similar to Hitchcock's Rear Window.  Taking on the project, Perry's screenplay for Mimic Sentinel is a combination of some of the main themes from the two films, as the story is centered on a young man named Marvin Montrose (Karl Geary), who is survivor of Stricklers', the disease that caused the introduction of the Judas Breed.  As a result of his illness, Marvin has problems breathing, and is hypersensitive to things in the air.  He spends most of his time in his room, in an apartment that he shares with his protective mother (Amanda Plummer) and his younger sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena).  His hobby is taking photographs of people on the street below, and in the nearby apartments.  His photos are pinned up on the wall, forming a large collage.From his bedroom window, Marvin views some strange happenings during the night, as the Judas Breed is loose in the neighborhood and claiming new victims.  Together with his sister Rosy and Carmen (Rebecca Mader), a woman who lives in a neighboring building, Marvin begins to scrutinize the neighborhood, focusing on a man known as the ""Garbageman"" (Lance Henrikson) aka Dr. Justin Whistler, the film's Thorwald.Like Rear Window, there is a certain sense of helplessness and frustration, as much of the film takes place in Marvin's room, and the immobile and physically weak photographer, can't do very much, and has to rely on others to investigate.  Police detective Gary Dumars (John Kapelos) pays a visit to the apartment, but he's more interested in having sex with Marvin's mother, than solving any murders.  The film moves at a slow pace until near the finish, when violence suddenly explodes.  After ineptly watching those he cares about getting hurt or killed, Marvin finally takes action.  The special effects are mostly minimal until the finish, where they are featured to good effect, as the bugs turn real nasty, and almost no one is left unscathed.For fans of the original film, Mimic Sentinel may be an interesting watch just out of curiosity, as it's something of an acquired taste.  In the closing of his commentary for the director's cut of Mimic, Guillermo del Toro recommends viewing Mimic Sentinel.  The pacing is rather ponderous, as the bugs initiate almost all the action.  The action sequences are crisply executed and quite violent, helping to redeem a film that lacks realism, and has lots of plot holes.  The characters are a bit weird, and might not be to everyone's liking, but the acting performances generally seem to do justice to the screenplay.  Alexis Dziena provides a spark, among what is a kind of sleepy cast.  Lance Henrikson's intense presence is a huge plus, although his role is small, he has a terrific final scene.",3,the rereturn of the Judas Breed...,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,3260,"['Directed', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'Hellboy', 'Devil', 'Backbone', 'based', 'story', 'Donald', 'A.', 'Wollheim', 'Mimic', '1997', 'was', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'first', 'introduced', 'Judas', 'Breed', 'giant', 'roachlike', 'creature', 'ability', 'mimic', 'appearance', 'man', 'bugs', 'returned', 'terrorize', 'New', 'York', 'Mimic', '2', '2001', 'are', 'back', 'round', '3', 'Mimic', 'Sentinel', '2003', 'direct', 'video', 'production', 'filmed', 'Romania.According', 'director', 'J.T', 'Perry', 'was', 'approached', 'idea', 'melding', 'Mimic', 'creature', 'situation', 'similar', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Taking', 'project', 'Perry', 'screenplay', 'Mimic', 'Sentinel', 'combination', 'main', 'themes', 'two', 'films', 'story', 'centered', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Marvin', 'Montrose', 'Karl', 'Geary', 'who', 'survivor', 'Stricklers', 'disease', 'caused', 'introduction', 'Judas', 'Breed', 'result', 'illness', 'Marvin', 'problems', 'breathing', 'hypersensitive', 'things', 'air', 'most', 'time', 'room', 'apartment', 'shares', 'protective', 'mother', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'younger', 'sister', 'Rosy', 'Alexis', 'Dziena', 'hobby', 'taking', 'photographs', 'people', 'street', 'nearby', 'apartments', 'photos', 'are', 'pinned', 'up', 'wall', 'forming', 'large', 'collage.From', 'bedroom', 'window', 'Marvin', 'strange', 'happenings', 'night', 'Judas', 'Breed', 'loose', 'neighborhood', 'claiming', 'new', 'victims', 'Together', 'sister', 'Rosy', 'Carmen', 'Rebecca', 'Mader', 'woman', 'who', 'neighboring', 'building', 'Marvin', 'scrutinize', 'neighborhood', 'focusing', 'man', 'known', 'Garbageman', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'aka', 'Dr.', 'Justin', 'Whistler', 'film', 'Thorwald.Like', 'Rear', 'Window', 'certain', 'sense', 'helplessness', 'frustration', 'much', 'film', 'place', 'Marvin', 'room', 'immobile', 'physically', 'weak', 'photographer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'much', 'rely', 'others', 'investigate', 'Police', 'detective', 'Gary', 'Dumars', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'visit', 'apartment', 'more', 'interested', 'having', 'sex', 'Marvin', 'mother', 'solving', 'murders', 'film', 'moves', 'slow', 'pace', 'finish', 'when', 'violence', 'suddenly', 'ineptly', 'watching', 'getting', 'hurt', 'killed', 'Marvin', 'finally', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'mostly', 'minimal', 'finish', 'where', 'are', 'featured', 'good', 'effect', 'bugs', 'turn', 'real', 'nasty', 'almost', 'one', 'left', 'unscathed.For', 'fans', 'original', 'film', 'Mimic', 'Sentinel', 'may', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'just', 'curiosity', 'something', 'acquired', 'taste', 'closing', 'commentary', 'director', 'cut', 'Mimic', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'viewing', 'Mimic', 'Sentinel', 'pacing', 'rather', 'ponderous', 'bugs', 'initiate', 'almost', 'action', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'crisply', 'executed', 'quite', 'violent', 'helping', 'redeem', 'film', 'realism', 'lots', 'plot', 'holes', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'weird', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'liking', 'acting', 'performances', 'generally', 'seem', 'do', 'justice', 'screenplay', 'Alexis', 'Dziena', 'spark', 'what', 'kind', 'sleepy', 'cast', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'intense', 'presence', 'huge', 'plus', 'role', 'small', 'terrific', 'final', 'scene']",N/A

The standard plot device means that the cop would not believe in the story, or at least remain sceptical, and the thrill continues.  In this movie, inspted of that, the cop starts to have a date with Marvin's mom (Amanda Plummer).  Do you think we need this kind of plot development?Anyway, after while the story strays into the alley, another girl comes into the room, named Carmen, and the two become Nancy Drew-like amateur detectives, and there is a strange man nicknamed 'The Garbageman' (Lance Henriksen, 'AVP' and many others).But you don't see Grace Kelly here, nor Hitchcock's assured hand as director.  The film suffers from a very disjointed script, which doesn't know how to scare, or even amuse us.  The bad construction of the filmed shots only lead to the confused impression on our side -- actually, we don't know exactly whether some of the characters are killed or not, or how got killed.  The bad acting from the leads only lessen the scare, and first of all, you don't see the lethal bug itself very much.The only good thing is the photography that captured the creepy mood of the backyard of a decayed apartment.

Sequels to this movie could easily have gone the routes of other horror film sereis and given us ""Mimic in L.A."" or ""Mimic in Space""... but instead took a much better low key approach.The addition of Lance Henriksen was a welcome one as he always seems to add an extra creepy performance, but that might have something to do with watching him star in Pumpkinhead when I was a little kid!Don't go into this expecting a direct continuation of the original film, and definately don't expect it to be another action oriented sequel. As other reviewers have mentioned this film has a feel of the Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window rather than the action/horror tone of its predecessors, and for a direct to DVD movie I think that really helps the overall quality of this film.",5,Nice departure from the sequel formula!,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,954,"['time', 'horror', 'film', 'spawns', 'third', 'sequel', 'always', 'much', 'more', 'elaborate', 'more', 'blood', 'gore', 'Mimic', '3', 'producers', 'decided', 'go', 'entirely', 'different', 'route', 'Sequels', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'gone', 'routes', 'other', 'horror', 'film', 'sereis', 'given', 'Mimic', 'L.A.', 'Mimic', 'Space', 'instead', 'took', 'much', 'better', 'low', 'key', 'approach.The', 'addition', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'was', 'welcome', 'one', 'always', 'add', 'extra', 'creepy', 'performance', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'watching', 'star', 'Pumpkinhead', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'direct', 'continuation', 'original', 'film', 'definately', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'action', 'oriented', 'sequel', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'feel', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'Rear', 'Window', 'rather', 'action/horror', 'tone', 'predecessors', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movie', 'think', 'really', 'overall', 'quality', 'film']",N/A
