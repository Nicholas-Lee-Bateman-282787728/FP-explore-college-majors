986616,A3K51Z8GYTWAEE,B000FA57IU,"Danniray99 ""Danniray""","[0, 1]","""Madea Goes to Jail"" is yet another bawdy, simplistic and politically incorrect live musical play in Tyler Perry's long-runnning comedy franchise. As Mr. Perry plays her, Madea is a big, busty, pistol-packing and hot-tempered southern grandmother/matriarch who stands six-foot five and packs a solid wallop.  Like so much soap opera, Madea's stories center around the travails of work-a-day folks:  sex, incarceration, adultery, drugs, violence and the meaning of family, church and God in the Black community (this DVD has at least one surprise:  Brian Hurst's portrayal of the lone[and rare] White character blends right in and appears by far to be the most talented of the cast's male singers). All of this may be a bit over the top, but Madea is undeniably funny and she's always entertaining. Yes, sometimes the overamplified singing (replete with excessive vocal gymnastics) is just too much--no one seems to have heard of the less-is-more concept. But judging from the size of the arenas Mr. Perry plays, that may be what his vast--and surprisingly diverse--audience demands.  And who are we to insult anyone else's taste?  Anyone looking for heavy realism and accurate, true-to-life downers need look elsewhere.  That is obviously not Mr. Perry's calling.  If his message of preachy uplift turns someone's life around for the better, then who are we to complain?  Those who pontificate about Perry's tendency to traffic in stereotypes would do well to remember that these were not created out of thin air:  stereotypes spring from REALITY!No one would ever mistake the ""Madea"" musical-comedies for ""Phantom of the Opera"" and the audience knows (or at least should have some clue as to) what its in for. Aside from the works of the late great August Wilson (to whom Mr. Perry certainly CANNOT be compared), there has been precious little in mainstream theater that has reflected Mr. Perry's demographic.I tend to like Mr. Perry precisely because he has no pretensions about creating ""high art.""  His Madea is never afraid or hesitant to let it all hang out, warts and all. She knows how to have a good time.  Likewise, the playwright knows his audience, he's exceedingly generous and he never falters on delivering what he does best.",4,"Bawdy, loud, simplistic and politically incorrect. . .but I loved it. . ..",1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,2240,"['Madea', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'yet', 'bawdy', 'simplistic', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'live', 'musical', 'play', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'long-runnning', 'comedy', 'franchise', 'Mr.', 'Perry', 'Madea', 'big', 'busty', 'pistol-packing', 'hot-tempered', 'southern', 'grandmother/matriarch', 'who', 'six-foot', 'five', 'solid', 'wallop', 'so', 'much', 'soap', 'opera', 'Madea', 'stories', 'center', 'travails', 'work-a-day', 'folks', 'sex', 'incarceration', 'adultery', 'drugs', 'violence', 'meaning', 'family', 'church', 'God', 'Black', 'community', 'DVD', 'least', 'one', 'surprise', 'Brian', 'Hurst', 'portrayal', 'lone', '[', 'rare', ']', 'White', 'character', 'blends', 'right', 'far', 'be', 'most', 'talented', 'cast', 'male', 'singers', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'top', 'Madea', 'undeniably', 'funny', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Yes', 'sometimes', 'overamplified', 'singing', 'replete', 'excessive', 'vocal', 'gymnastics', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'have', 'heard', 'less-is-more', 'concept', 'judging', 'size', 'arenas', 'Mr.', 'Perry', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'vast', 'surprisingly', 'diverse', 'audience', 'demands', 'who', 'are', 'insult', 'anyone', 'else', 'taste', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'heavy', 'realism', 'accurate', 'true-to-life', 'downers', 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'obviously', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Perry', 'calling', 'message', 'preachy', 'uplift', 'someone', 'life', 'better', 'then', 'who', 'are', 'complain', 'who', 'pontificate', 'Perry', 'tendency', 'traffic', 'stereotypes', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'remember', 'were', 'not', 'created', 'thin', 'air', 'stereotypes', 'spring', 'REALITY', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'mistake', 'Madea', 'musical-comedies', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'audience', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'Aside', 'works', 'late', 'great', 'August', 'Wilson', 'whom', 'Mr.', 'Perry', 'certainly', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'be', 'compared', 'been', 'precious', 'little', 'mainstream', 'theater', 'reflected', 'Mr.', 'Perry', 'demographic.I', 'tend', 'like', 'Mr.', 'Perry', 'precisely', 'pretensions', 'creating', 'high', 'art', 'Madea', 'never', 'afraid', 'hesitant', 'let', 'hang', 'out', 'warts', 'how', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Likewise', 'playwright', 'audience', 'exceedingly', 'generous', 'never', 'delivering', 'what', 'best']",Madea Goes to Jail

I can only think of a few cons and a whole gang of pros.Cons:  I thought Tyler was a little rough on Chico and I didn't care for the man putting his hands around her neck (during the Behind the Scenes rehearsal).  I wonder how she felt about that, but it bothered me quite a bit.  The wigs are still horrendous, but I know they save time. Who in the world made Chico's tear tattoos though?  I've seen a bunch of tear tattoos growing up and they've always been little, but somebody put tears so big on her face that it looked more like a wet marker.  I don't know what was on that lady's bird who sang the song at the end but all that oversinging was driving me insane--she started making this short, yelping noise that sounded like a gun going off and I wanted to pause the DVD and duck down for cover.  She made this loud ""yiddiddidd"" noise and then a bunch of ""yay-e-yay-uhs""...it was terrible. That song should've ended before she started impersonating weapons.Pros:  Let's have a moment of appreciation for Mr. Ryan Gentles and Mr. Christian Keyes, because those two men will have you lose your breath more than Destiny's Child. I really hate pick-up lines and I'm deadset against sweating anybody, but THOSE two are the the dudes that you have to stop, look at your homegirl, and go ""Did you just see THEM?""  Wow!  That's all I can say.  I thought Ryan was absolutely the finest man ever with dreads...whoa.  Ron Andrews playing ""Pete the Pimp"" was a cutie pie too, but I thought he was older than he really was until I saw Behind the Scenes.But on to the movie.  This movie was incredibly hilarious.  Madea going to jail is just scary in general, but I really dug the lessons she tried to express in regards to women who have children but are in jail; the foster care system; officers raping women prisoners; violence in men's prisons; violence in women's prisons; betrayal; cheating; friendship; sexual responsibility; and street life *singing* ""You know it's hard out here for a pimp.""  The movie was excellent all around. I was too ecstatic when Tyler actually SANG several times during this movie and then broke character to talk about playalistics and people who come in and out of your life for their own intentions.  I couldn't agree more with the tree analogy.I'm trying to figure out what I liked more--the behind-the-scenes shot when Ryan growled at the camera or the movie...but that's a tough one.I'd recommend it to anyone breathing--go see it today!  It took me about four hours to get through the movie because I just kept rewinding scenes and falling out laughing again. ""Sonny"" cracked a joke with Pepsi about ""ac'in"" and I cracked up and saw that he had the potential to be funny as well and Pepsi was crazy as usual.  I really like her singing voice and her comedy, as well as Leo the Lion.  My favorite part of the whole movie was the ""Old School"" scene. I couldn't get enough of that and this movie.  And who was on the saxophone?  That musician was GETTING IT!
