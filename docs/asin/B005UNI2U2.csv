I finally had some time and decided to watch the movie.At first I thought I made a mistake as it started out with Japanese racing much faster than the sparse English subtitles. There was background sound that did not match the pictorial scenes. For the first ten minutes or so I was sure I made a mistake. Then the movie and the acting and the story started to show through. I completely forgot that I was reading subtitles. I started kibitzing. Many stories are very transparent and you can anticipant the next step. This one was fresh at every turn.A woman (Narumi Yasuda) who invents a time travel liquid finds herself in a coma from an accident. She gains consciousness just long enough to send her teenage daughter Akari Yoshiyama (Riisa Naka) on a mission from 2010 to 1972 to hold a chemistry student Masamichi Hasegawa (Munetaka Aoki) to his promise. Though some mishaps and a series of coincidences we get a much more intricate story then just time traveling. The well done ending even though surprising could not be any other way.,5,"Screenplay by Tomoe Kanno, based on the novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui",1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,1103,"['had', 'seen', 'preview', 'movie', 'had', 'wish', 'list', 'finally', 'had', 'time', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie.At', 'first', 'thought', 'made', 'mistake', 'started', 'out', 'Japanese', 'racing', 'much', 'faster', 'sparse', 'English', 'subtitles', 'was', 'background', 'sound', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'pictorial', 'scenes', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'was', 'sure', 'made', 'mistake', 'Then', 'movie', 'acting', 'story', 'started', 'show', 'completely', 'forgot', 'was', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'started', 'kibitzing', 'Many', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'transparent', 'can', 'anticipant', 'next', 'step', 'one', 'was', 'fresh', 'turn.A', 'woman', 'Narumi', 'Yasuda', 'who', 'time', 'travel', 'liquid', 'coma', 'accident', 'gains', 'consciousness', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'send', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Akari', 'Yoshiyama', 'Riisa', 'Naka', 'mission', '2010', '1972', 'hold', 'chemistry', 'student', 'Masamichi', 'Hasegawa', 'Munetaka', 'Aoki', 'promise', 'mishaps', 'series', 'coincidences', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'intricate', 'story', 'then', 'just', 'time', 'traveling', 'well', 'done', 'ending', 'even', 'surprising', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'other', 'way']",Time Traveller: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time

I normally only watch Japanese anime, but I loved this live action film.  I'm not a crazy movie buff, but I enjoyed the different feel of the movie and how the story was told.  The acting was as good as any film I've seen made by Hollywood.  I only wish it was dubbed in English versus subtitled.

I tend to not like foreign films much because I am used to American-quality films-and it's easy to notice how the camera angles and shots are bouncy or shaky or just strange in foreign films. I quickly became immersed in the story however, and ended up really liking this movie. I suggest you all to give this a shot, especially if you are just venturing into the world of foreign films, because it does a very good job with story, characters and sound. I will admit that they overplayed their soundtrack-though it wasn't open to many options, so I have to give that a shot. The second half was exceedingly well done, and I was very pleased with this. I hope to find more foreign films that are as good as this one was.In case you didn't read the title-THIS IS NOT LIKE THE ANIME. The mother, I would assume is supposedly the protagonist in the anime film, and while she isn't necessarily the main character, she does play an interesting role.

This was not a remake of the same movie.  I wish I had read the reviews first but I thought they were just about the acting or how close it stayed to the original.  This is loosely based on the anime, perhaps attempting to be a sequel of sorts.  As with Japanese (vs. American-style) movies, it was more deliberate, not flashy and definitely character-driven.  That was fine.  There were a few parts that beg you to throw away what is realistic and jump into this fantasy with both feet.  Otherwise you couldn't get through some parts.  I personally hated what she found her father to be and how he treated her, esp. at the end.  Only a handful of scenes I would say were humorous, quite unlike the anime. And the movie that was being directed (a character was filming a movie), I just didn't get it.  Maybe it was symbolism for what was happening to the characters, but I just don't get it.  Maybe if I was Japanese I would know a bit more of what it all meant (cherry blossoms being apart of it).  Anyway, it was ok.  If I had known a bit more I probably would have skipped it, nothing esp. stood out for me in this movie except being able to hear the lovely Japanese language for 2 hours straight!  ...and of course it was -somewhat- like the anime I thoroughly enjoyed in the past.",3,Definitely not a remake,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1416,"['loved', 'anime', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Leapt', 'Time', 'saw', 'amazon', 'Prime', 'thought', 'great', 'movie', 'now', 'Live', 'Action', 'Wrong', 'was', 'not', 'remake', 'same', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'first', 'thought', 'were', 'just', 'acting', 'how', 'close', 'stayed', 'original', 'loosely', 'based', 'anime', 'perhaps', 'attempting', 'be', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'Japanese', 'vs.', 'American-style', 'movies', 'was', 'more', 'deliberate', 'not', 'flashy', 'definitely', 'character-driven', 'was', 'fine', 'were', 'few', 'parts', 'beg', 'throw', 'away', 'what', 'realistic', 'jump', 'fantasy', 'feet', 'Otherwise', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'parts', 'personally', 'hated', 'what', 'found', 'father', 'be', 'how', 'treated', 'esp', 'end', 'Only', 'handful', 'scenes', 'would', 'say', 'were', 'humorous', 'quite', 'anime', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'directed', 'character', 'was', 'filming', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Maybe', 'was', 'symbolism', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Maybe', 'was', 'Japanese', 'would', 'know', 'bit', 'more', 'what', 'meant', 'cherry', 'blossoms', 'being', 'apart', 'Anyway', 'was', 'ok', 'had', 'known', 'bit', 'more', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'skipped', 'nothing', 'esp', 'stood', 'out', 'movie', 'being', 'able', 'hear', 'lovely', 'Japanese', 'language', '2', 'hours', 'straight', 'course', 'was', '-somewhat-', 'anime', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'past']",Time Traveller: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time
