227288,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,630024797X,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 5]","Paris, Texas is a profoundly beautiful film that certainly belongs in any film collection worthy of the name.  It rewards on all levels, cinematography, story, acting, and heart - even soundtrack.  The picture takes you to an eerie and exotic place, both literally and emotionally, and maintains its high-wire level of vivid authenticity for each and every one of its 147 minutes.  Put simply, this is filmmaking at its very best - Paris, Texas surely earned its 1984 Palme d'Or.In Paris, Texas, very little happens - and it happens at a leisurely pace.  Director Wim Wenders uses time opulently, painting nuanced details on a vast canvas; we're well into the movie before Travis (our protagonist) even speaks.  The austere Texas landscapes Travis wanders seem haunted by an exquisite spiritual longing and emptiness, perfectly majestic and perfectly designed to torment him.Harry Dean Stanton (Travis) is a reliably excellent actor, but Paris, Texas is his masterpiece.  He does so much with so little that, even though his character is oddly extreme, we care about him instantly.  We don't know why he's walked through hell, and neither does he, but we need to know.  As we learn more, we must discover what happened to his son and wife, and what will happen to them all.Dean Stockwell, a consistent and underappreciated actor, has his hands full as Walt, brother to Travis.  He and his wife must try to reel Travis back into reality, and in so doing, reacquaint Travis with Hunter; the son he left behind when he went missing four years ago.  That Walt and wife have been Hunter's parents all that time, and are putting the love for their adopted son in jeopardy by reuniting Travis and Hunter, is only one of the film's many difficult moral and emotional choices.  But Walt is a good brother, and his self-sacrifice foreshadows even greater acts of selflessness to come.Viewers who surrender to the spell of this movie will wear their emotions outside their skin; there is vulnerability, openness, and poignancy that is sometimes almost unbearable.  Hunter Carson, as the son abandoned not once but twice, (father and mother), is marvelously unaffected and likeable.  Watching Travis build something good with his long-lost son is a joy.  Wenders has faultless timing, his direction is masterful.  He makes us wait for the payday, admittedly, but when it arrives, it is even better than we had any right to expect.  Nastassja Kinski, as Jane, estranged wife of Travis and Hunter's mom, is astounding.  The scene between her and Travis is as chilling, real, and poetic as anything I have ever seen on film.Choosing Ry Cooder to do the score was an inspired decision, there is a plaintive, melancholy loveliness to his solo guitar that is perfectly at home in the barren, hurt landscapes of both the heart, and the Texas badlands.",5,A Man Wanders An Exquisite Wilderness,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,2832,"['Paris', 'Texas', 'profoundly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'certainly', 'belongs', 'film', 'collection', 'worthy', 'name', 'levels', 'cinematography', 'story', 'acting', 'heart', 'even', 'soundtrack', 'picture', 'eerie', 'exotic', 'place', 'literally', 'emotionally', 'high-wire', 'level', 'vivid', 'authenticity', 'one', '147', 'minutes', 'Put', 'simply', 'filmmaking', 'very', 'best', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'surely', 'earned', '1984', 'Palme', ""d'Or.In"", 'Paris', 'Texas', 'very', 'little', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'Director', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'time', 'opulently', 'painting', 'nuanced', 'details', 'vast', 'canvas', ""'re"", 'well', 'movie', 'Travis', 'protagonist', 'even', 'austere', 'Texas', 'Travis', 'wanders', 'seem', 'haunted', 'exquisite', 'spiritual', 'longing', 'emptiness', 'perfectly', 'majestic', 'perfectly', 'designed', 'torment', 'him.Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Travis', 'reliably', 'excellent', 'actor', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'even', 'character', 'oddly', 'extreme', 'care', 'instantly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'walked', 'hell', 'neither', 'need', 'know', 'learn', 'more', 'must', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'son', 'wife', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'all.Dean', 'Stockwell', 'consistent', 'underappreciated', 'actor', 'hands', 'full', 'Walt', 'brother', 'Travis', 'wife', 'must', 'try', 'reel', 'Travis', 'back', 'reality', 'so', 'doing', 'reacquaint', 'Travis', 'Hunter', 'son', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'went', 'missing', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'Walt', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'Hunter', 'parents', 'time', 'are', 'putting', 'love', 'adopted', 'son', 'jeopardy', 'reuniting', 'Travis', 'Hunter', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'difficult', 'moral', 'emotional', 'choices', 'Walt', 'good', 'brother', 'self-sacrifice', 'foreshadows', 'even', 'greater', 'acts', 'selflessness', 'come.Viewers', 'who', 'surrender', 'spell', 'movie', 'will', 'wear', 'emotions', 'skin', 'vulnerability', 'openness', 'poignancy', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'Hunter', 'Carson', 'son', 'abandoned', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'father', 'mother', 'marvelously', 'unaffected', 'likeable', 'Watching', 'Travis', 'build', 'something', 'good', 'long-lost', 'son', 'joy', 'Wenders', 'faultless', 'timing', 'direction', 'masterful', 'wait', 'payday', 'admittedly', 'when', 'even', 'better', 'had', 'right', 'expect', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'Jane', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Travis', 'Hunter', 'mom', 'astounding', 'scene', 'Travis', 'chilling', 'real', 'poetic', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film.Choosing', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'do', 'score', 'was', 'inspired', 'decision', 'plaintive', 'melancholy', 'loveliness', 'solo', 'guitar', 'perfectly', 'home', 'barren', 'hurt', 'landscapes', 'heart', 'Texas', 'badlands']",N/A
227289,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630024797X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Wim Wenders' `Paris, Texas' is a film that completely took me by surprise.  I'm still not exactly sure what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't this.I think it's important to know the type of director Wenders is before taking a bite out of `Paris, Texas'.  I haven't seen a lot of his films, but one of my favorite films of all time was directed by the man (`Wings of Desire') so, I can't say I wasn't acquainted with his work before indulging in this cult classic.  Wenders likes to allow the majesty of his surroundings to create an intimate space between the audience and the film itself.  You could liken his style to that of Terrence Malick or even Ingmar Bergman; a man who likes to let silence rest long enough to make a loud impact.  So, when watching a film like `Paris, Texas', be prepared to be completely absorbed in the epic majesty of the screen itself; with long sequences of little apparent progression but ultimately giant leaps of character development.The silence says so much.`Paris, Texas' tells the story of a man who's been missing for four years.  He suddenly rears his head again, causing his brother to come rushing to his aid.  This man, Travis, left behind a young bride and a young son when he disappeared, and in his absence his wife went missing as well and his young son, Hunter, came to live with Travis's brother and his wife.  At first silent and awkward, Travis soon begins adjust to the life he left behind, and he begins to attempt atonement, which leads him (and his son) on an interesting journey into the heart of Texas to find Jane, his wayward wife.At the heart of this film is a beautiful story of a man's love, a deep love that he cannot control or even begin to fully understand.  As he connects (or reconnects) with his son, Travis begins to pick up the pieces of his own broken heart.  His recollection of his own childhood seem to be jumbled with his understanding of his son's own upbringing; possibly a recoil into childish reasoning in order to sustain peace of mind in the midst of his own mistakes.  As he comes face to face with his biggest regret, his story unfolds in excruciatingly heartbreaking fashion.That final conversation, between Travis and Jane, is remarkable.`Paris, Texas' has a lot more going for it than a phenomenal story.  The cinematography is outstanding; grand in scope and yet gritty and harsh in tone.  The direction is crisp and understated, allowing the subtle hints of development in story to absorb the audience.  The score, so sullen and eerie, plays on the eardrums with expert understanding of the emotional complexities held in the film.  And then you have the fantastic performances by the entire cast; most notably Harry Dean Stanton (such an emotionally rounded portrayal), Dean Stockwell (caring and confused and authentically so) and Nastassja Kinski (the way she shuffles emotions in a few mere moments is remarkable).  When you layer all of these elements atop one another you have one of the most gratifying films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.Just spellbinding.",5,A lonely struggle for self-redemption...,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,3067,"['Wim', 'Wenders', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'film', 'completely', 'took', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'this.I', 'think', 'important', 'know', 'type', 'director', 'Wenders', 'taking', 'bite', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'films', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'was', 'directed', 'man', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'acquainted', 'work', 'indulging', 'cult', 'classic', 'Wenders', 'likes', 'allow', 'majesty', 'surroundings', 'create', 'intimate', 'space', 'audience', 'film', 'could', 'liken', 'style', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'even', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'man', 'who', 'let', 'silence', 'rest', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'loud', 'impact', 'So', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'epic', 'majesty', 'screen', 'long', 'sequences', 'little', 'apparent', 'progression', 'ultimately', 'giant', 'leaps', 'character', 'development.The', 'silence', 'so', 'much.', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'tells', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'missing', 'four', 'years', 'suddenly', 'head', 'again', 'causing', 'brother', 'come', 'rushing', 'aid', 'man', 'Travis', 'left', 'behind', 'young', 'bride', 'young', 'son', 'when', 'disappeared', 'absence', 'wife', 'went', 'missing', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'son', 'Hunter', 'came', 'live', 'Travis', 'brother', 'wife', 'first', 'silent', 'awkward', 'Travis', 'soon', 'adjust', 'life', 'left', 'behind', 'attempt', 'atonement', 'son', 'interesting', 'journey', 'heart', 'Texas', 'find', 'Jane', 'wayward', 'heart', 'film', 'beautiful', 'story', 'man', 'love', 'deep', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'even', 'begin', 'fully', 'understand', 'reconnects', 'son', 'Travis', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'own', 'broken', 'heart', 'recollection', 'own', 'childhood', 'seem', 'be', 'jumbled', 'understanding', 'son', 'own', 'upbringing', 'possibly', 'recoil', 'childish', 'reasoning', 'order', 'sustain', 'peace', 'mind', 'midst', 'own', 'mistakes', 'face', 'face', 'biggest', 'regret', 'story', 'unfolds', 'excruciatingly', 'heartbreaking', 'fashion.That', 'final', 'conversation', 'Travis', 'Jane', 'remarkable.', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'phenomenal', 'story', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'grand', 'scope', 'yet', 'gritty', 'harsh', 'tone', 'direction', 'crisp', 'understated', 'allowing', 'subtle', 'hints', 'development', 'story', 'absorb', 'audience', 'score', 'so', 'sullen', 'eerie', 'plays', 'eardrums', 'expert', 'understanding', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'held', 'film', 'then', 'have', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'such', 'emotionally', 'rounded', 'portrayal', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'caring', 'confused', 'authentically', 'so', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'way', 'emotions', 'few', 'mere', 'moments', 'remarkable', 'When', 'layer', 'elements', 'atop', 'one', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'gratifying', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing.Just', 'spellbinding']",N/A

Basically, the feelings to be explored in this film weren't all wondrous for me to understand. It was a very similar picture to Lost in Translation, which revived the genre that Paris, Texas followed through. Certainly, pictures like that weren't ideal entertainment for me because the message was often unclear and obscure.

I gave it 2 stars for the music and the cinematography.  To call this movie slow is the understatement of the year ... it moves like a sedated tortoise.  I really can't understand those people who say that this is the best film they have ever seen ... they can't have seen many films.  I have been watching films seriously for about 30 years, and have seen many great ones ... but this ain't one of them.&quot;Okay, wise guy, you didn't like it. Why?&quot;  First of all, let me say that the first part, when the main character interacts with his brother, brother's wife, and his kid (who has been raised by his brother), is far better than the end, when he and his son search for his wife.  They find her in Houston by waiting outside a bank and following her car (why not try the phone book first?). Then, unexplainably, Travis leaves the kid with her while he takes off again (going to Paris, Texas?  Does he intend to come back?).  This, after spending much time re-establishing a relationship with his boy.  I'm not one that demands happy endings, but I do like endings that make some sort of sense.  I hear that much of the ending was unscripted, and it shows.Dramas require tension, whether between characters or in the plot (&quot;don't ever open the green door!&quot;).  This movie has none, which is a primary reason why it is so terminally dull.  Travis (Stanton) is a complex character, but is never fully revealed, and although we may feel sorry for him and his condition, he remains simply a screwed up individual.Dramas also require some kind of contrast.  There is very little of that in the film in any respect.Great dramas usually have great dialogue.  Don't look for any memorable dialogue here.  I don't expect Shakespeare, but the totally mundane, inane dialogue in this picture does not serve it well.  Shepherd could have done better. And the director must have been watching too many Antonioni films, with all the pauses and lacunae.Acting?  Stockwell, as usual, does a good job.  Stanton is mute for much of the first part of the film.  When he does finally talk, his lines are delivered in a monotone that could put anyone to sleep.  Kinski, Travis' wife, is gorgeous, but doesn't have much of a role.I recently viewed &quot;Scarecrow&quot; with Gene Hackman and Al Pacino.

German filmmaker Wim Wenders did just this with his film Paris, Texas. It was a collaboration with acclaimed playwright and actor Sam Shepard and can be seen as a kind of lament for an era of the American west that no longer exists. It's an American road movie about characters living on the fringes of society and was made during the peak of the materialistic Reagan era. Paris, Texas went on to win the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival and firmly established Wenders as an art house darling.The first disc features an audio commentary by filmmaker Wim Wenders. The director talks about how he and Ry Cooder decided to use the music that is in the Paris, Texas. Wenders also talks about the origins of the film and working with Sam Shepard on the screenplay. The director talks about the genesis of the film's title and how it relates to Travis. Wenders tells many filming anecdotes on this informative track.Also included is a theatrical trailer.The second disc starts off with an interview with Wenders from 2001. He had wanted to make a film about America but hadn't done it to his satisfaction with his previous films. It wasn't until Paris, Texas that he felt like he had achieved this goal. It was also the first time he worked in a spontaneous fashion without a pre-planned shot list.""The Road to Paris, Texas"" is a collection of interviews with key collaborators of Wenders over the years. They all speak admiringly of the man. Wenders talks about the influence of rock `n' roll and road movies on his work.Also included are interviews with both Claire Denis and Allison Anders, who worked on the film as first assistant director and production assistant respectively. They went on to become directors in their own right. They give their impressions of Wenders, how they met him and what it was like to work with the filmmaker. In addition, Anders reads from the diary that she kept while working on the film.""Cinema Cinemas"" is a segment from an April 2, 1984 episode of this French television programming featuring Wenders and composer Cooder working on the score for Paris, Texas. Wenders talks about his love of rock `n' roll music. It was a dream of his to have Cooder work on his film.There is a collection of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Wenders. We see more of the German doctor taking care of Travis at the beginning of the film. Most of this footage is bits and pieces that just didn't fit and were ultimately cut. Also included is fantastic Super 8 mm footage, some of which was used in the flashback sequences so as to resemble old home movies.Finally, there are ""Galleries,"" one a collection of photographs that Wenders took while location scouting in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California.

Markel,"[4, 8]","This review is for the 2004 DVD release by 20th Century Fox.I really loved the look of this movie when it started in West Texas and the cinematography was astounding. The soundtrack by Ry Cooder also fit the mood of the desert perfectly. The main character is Travis, (Harry Dean Stanton), who wanders recklessly in the Texas desert. He is later rescued by his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), and Walt takes him back to Los Angeles to be with Walt's wife and Hunter, the son of Travis whom he abandoned 4 years earlier. We see the household situation that Hunter has been placed in with Walt and his loving wife the past several years and it seems very healthy and stable.The film slowly moves in a direction where it appears that Travis wants to put his life back in order. Finally there is a plan to reunite Travis, his son and estranged wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski). After some amateur detective work they find Jane in Houston. There is one powerful scene where Travis confesses to Jane why he left her.  The final outcome is a blemish for this film in my opinion - especially the social placement of the young boy (if you realize in what situation he was in when the movie started and what circumstance he was in when the film ended).  But all in all, it's a beautifully filmed movie that's very good, but a better ending could have made it a great movie.The DVD picture quality and audio are first rate.

227305,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,630024797X,Edmonson,"[3, 3]","""Paris, Texas""(1984) is directed by Wim Wenders (Wings of Desire). Even though Wim Wenders directed 12 feature films before this one he said that this was his second film since it took all of his previous films for him to be able to make this one. Sam Shepard and Kit Carson wrote the screenplay, and Ry Cooder supplied the wonderfully melancholic slide guitar music. The film begins with Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) wandering apparently aimlessly in the Southwestern desert of the U.S. Initially he seems to have amnesia, and we discover later that he has been in incognito for four years. Gradually he emerges from his psychological retreat from the world with the help of his brother who has been taking care of his son. This is a film that slowly unfolds its secrets as Travis continues a healing process which began when he first ran out into the desert, running away from civilization and his old life. The story comes full circle when Travis finds his missing wife, Jane (Nastassja Kinski), and we learn the full story about what led to Travis' escape from the world. This film won't be to everyone's taste who is used to the fast pace of the city, as this movie at times is as slowly relentless, and harsh as the parched desert itself, its landscape the bare bones of a man who has come face to face with his dark side and hasn't liked what he saw.This blu-ray is remastered with DTS-HD Master Audio, and has a large number of special features, including interviews with Wim Wenders, Ry Cooder, Dean Stanton, Peter Falk, Dennis Hopper, Hanns Zishler, Patricia Highsmith, Claire Dennis, Allison Anders, and Samuel Fuller. There is also ""Wim Wenders Hollywood April '84"", which is a French television segment featuring Wenders and Cooder at work on the score.

These ideas - trite, maybe, but psychologically powerful - are ideas that inhabit the work of one of America's great writers - Sam Shepard.  PARIS, TEXAS may be one of Mr Shepard's greatest collaborations.  Certainly, visually, it may be one of the most beautiful films of America ever made, DAYS OF HEAVEN and KOYAANISQATSI notwithstanding. The richness of the colours, the framing, represent a wondrous manifestation of Mr Shepard's vision, a vision that is reminiscent of Edward Hopper - humans isolated in a landscape albeit a stunningly beautiful one.  And whether that landscape is the Mojave Desert or suburban L.A. or urban Houston, it is a landscape that is strangely cold, and clean, eerie and unwelcoming.  Robbie Muller may be a master cinemaphotographer in the way he is able to give reality to Mr Shepard's and Mr Wender's vision.  Let's face it - a story is really a platform to launch off into exploring the wider questions.One striking and memorable moment among many, is when the searching anti-hero, Everyman, Travis is walking purposefully (he is on a mission) across a sidewalk on a freeway cloverleaf interchange bridge - in the background beyond the steel safety rail in the middle distance are the freeways and the cars. Travis is the only animal, human, organic thing visible, and he walks purposefully on ignoring all vistas, and then we and he become aware of a ranting male voice which increases as we get closer and closer until it overcomes the hum and occasional whoosh of traffic.  THe voice gets louder declaiming the destruction of the world - Travis pauses when he gets to the man, listens a sentence or two, then continues on his way, edging past the ""mad"" orator.Yes the film does tell a story.  And the story does hold our interest.  Our dreams may be pathetic, and romantic, and we may have to painfully learn that we cannot possess the thing we love the most or we will destroy it.  The joy of Travis is that he learns this, and through a wonderful act of redemption and generosity, achieves a kind of grace.But it is the visual splendour and cinematic power of Wim Wenders,and Robbie Muller giving expression to Sam Shepard that makes this one of the greatest films about America.Brilliant and captured stunningly well on DVD.

227311,ATAO781X1B6SY,630024797X,John J. Martinez,"[10, 23]","(I must give multiple mea culpas to anyone who read this review and didn't understand it. I have tried here, as of September 2010, to make it worth reading.Thanks.)AS FAR AS THE FILM ITSELF:I will not try to give too much away, but please understand, this movie has that rare kind of intensity.I was alone and divorced living in Yakima, Washington in 1990. I had nothing, was barely working part-time, drinking a lot and didn't care about the future. I felt the world collapsed around me, and I was never going to get beyond what limitations I had chained to myself so badly it took several years to let it all go.Then one day I went to the video store and rented this movie.I was simply interested in Harry Dean Stanton, who had also made in 1983/84 one of my favorite films ""Repo Man"" as the rough repo cop Bud. I thought it might it have some bite to it, so I slipped the VHS tape in and sat back in the one chair I could fit in my tiny kitchenette apartment and watched it.I was blown away. Wim Wenders had reached into my life and put it on the TV screen. There Harry was (as 'Travis') at the beginning of the film, wandering under the vast open skies and desert in the hot Texas sun alone as he drinks from a small jug of water. He is literally wandering in the desert, and really heading in no direction.A local sheriff finds him, and after questioning him (Travis doesn't answer), he goes through his clothes and finds a slip of paper with his brother Walt's (Dean Stockwell) number. Walt comes to get him and we find out that he has been missing for 4 years. He takes Travis back to LA with him where we now see his 7 year old son Hunter, who was abandoned there by Travis' wife, is curious to know who he is.We find Travis is a disaster, and emotionally vacant to everyone, even Hunter. The film takes us on an emotional rollercoaster as the mysteries unfold of what he may or may not have done in his past, what he wanted to do with his life and his motivations to put his family back together are slowly and painfully revealed.He is clearly still haunted by the memories of his past, but still wants to make things right. All he wants is a piece of land to re-build his childhood home, and to be happy. This idea has brought him to a personal crossroad.Travis leaves with Hunter to go find his ex-wife Jane, who may have run off to Los Angeles to be an actress, and after spending a brief time in Hollywood, he finally finds out where she is and finds out she is living in Houston. He takes off once again to confront her (and she is played all too briefly by Nastassja Kinski).The last 20 minutes of the film is soul-wrenching, and in one of the most emotionally revealing conversations I've ever seen put on film, Travis and Jane finally confront each other - sort of. (You have to see the scene to understand it, I won't spoil THAT.)I watched this film over and over, watching the silent pain and hope of the redemptive face of Travis, how he never had any kind of voice in how he felt about things in the first place, and the resulting upheaval when he re-enters his son Hunter's life, among other failures. I felt what he felt as he tried to regain anything that resembled a life, and still loved his ex-wife, and dearly loved his son. I was living this life onscreen.Wim Wenders had realized his glorious love for all things Western and Harry Dean Stanton deserved an Oscar for his performance.This movie is very slow in pace, so unless you actually have the patience of the sints, than this film is not for you. It's cerebral, and thought-provoking, and the visuals are stunning, and even though the plot is hard for many to get into, I understood it from the very beginning,It's okay because it's about Travis trying to pick up the pieces of all of the hearts he has broken (including his own) and gluing them back together again. It's haunting and sad and will make you weep if you've EVER have been in a situation of unresolved relationships and heartache.The music score by Ry Cooder is sad, billowy, and floats you over the dried yellowed land, carrying you along as the silent stoic visuals of the Old West are brought alive and complimented by him. Wenders (and to a almost lesser extent David Lynch) had that kind of cerebral touch in the late 80's and early 90s. You knew it existed, but you never knew what it was until you went off the beaten path and around the safe corner.This movie haunted my life for several years after I first watched it. It made me sit in corner ponder my own existence, and my own part in my own reality. It was a personal hazy reflection of my life in the early 90s and it still makes me kinda sad to watch.As for me? After 1993 I left Yakima (and sadly, my son, but he didn't need to see a drunk), went back home to Chicago and I have been somewhat happier since. My son and I get along very well and my time in Hell on earth is over. I'll be honest, seeing this film put a mirror to my face and really woke me up. I have kept a copy near me for years now, but don't watch it as much. Maybe it's now because the film did what did for me, and it doesn't anymore.I know in the world there are people still out there like Travis, and Jane, and Hunter, who are hurting bad and are looking for the answer to healing, hope and redemption. I was lucky. Will this film help them? Only if they want it to.ANYWAY... AS FAR AS THE DVD SPECIFICATIONS GO:This is 1:75:1 and enhanced for widescreen TV. The sound is a fresh Dolby 5.1 and is crisp and clear. There are two extras featured: a deleted scenes section, and a optional commentary throughout the film with Wenders himself.Together, 20th Century Fox has given us a DVD worth owning for the price of a case of good beer. If I met myself back in 1990 when I first saw this, I'd go up to myself, buy us some beers and let him rent the movie, and together we'd watch the film and try to get through it without falling apart.For some people this may be too ""visceral"" of an experience, and yes it can be slow in a LOT of places, but it's supposed to be, because the pace is set up for you to take in each and every subtle nuance of this story!I get it, I got it, and now I hope you get it, too. It's honestly worth your examination.(Thanks for reading and I hope this review is better than the screwed-up one I left here for several years, but now have happily erased in favor of this one.)",5,This film kept me alive for almost two years.,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,6388,"['must', 'give', 'multiple', 'mea', 'culpas', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand',

Did his father love his mother for what she was, a plain girl from Texas, or what he imagined her to be, a ""fancy woman"" from France?Travis has the same problem; he's the real focus of the film and around him the Texas twilight casts long, sad shadows that glisten with hope, brilliant colors, and soon to be approaching night. In him's a heart that's torn between his love for what he knows and for what he wants to run away from, between his son, Hunter, his ex-wife Jane, and himself. The only one of these he knows is real is his son, who's the second core of the film. Hunter is the reality of his marriage to Jane, the one thing he knows is solid and true and right in front of him.Nobody makes films like this anymore. This was done in 1984 and deservedly won a Palmes d'Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival, one of the top awards given to a film director.Nobody makes films with this much heart anymore.

227330,AQBHNE9AP6YBP,630024797X,NostalgiaVHS,"[2, 2]","`Paris, Texas' is a stunning and sublime portrait of the human spirit's quest for redemption and belonging, an extraordinary film which displays a remarkable understanding of its characters and of the vast, lonely world they inhabit. Through beautifully photographed images and flawlessly executed movements and dialogue, the film manages to elicit complex and profound emotions while still managing to maintain a genuine and personal perspective of reality. Rarely are films successful in presenting a world so rich with such authentic humanity, but `Paris, Texas' is unique in its ability to transcend the artistic boundaries of dramatic film-making, and will slowly but surely integrate itself into the lives of those who accept it for the quiet masterpiece it truly is.The severely underrated Harry Dean Stanton stars as Travis Stockwell, a lonely drifter who wanders aimlessly through a spacious and empty desert somewhere in the American Midwest, endlessly searching for something profoundly important, yet he can't quite remember what that something is. Travis is eventually discovered by his successful brother Walt, who is shocked that Travis is still alive. Walt explains to the dirty and mute Travis that he had completely disappeared for four long years, during which time he and his wife had been raising Travis' eight year old son Hunter for him. After Travis lays eyes upon Hunter for the first time in four years, memories of love and loss flood back into his conscious, and he soon embarks on a journey to rejuvenate his long disbanded family.What proceeds is a tale of reunion and rediscovery, where cherished memories of love and loyalty are finally restored and the emotional bonds tattered by years of loneliness and alienation are once again restored. One of the more remarkable aspects of the film is its dedication to the development of its characters; it takes its time to illustrate their often complex feelings, and the story is told through their context. Travis' early attempts to earn the trust of Hunter are so moving and sincere that it becomes heart-breaking to see him fail. The scenes are effective without the aid of melodramatic music or phony dialogue. They exist within a solid reality, where organic human emotions take center stage.Harry Dean Stanton delivers a brilliant performance, capturing every obscure idiosyncrasy and mannerism of his eccentric character with outstanding authenticity and style. His performance is almost haunting in its power to inspire such a wide range of emotions. His soul-bearing monologue near the end of the film is a high-water mark for character acting and the undisputed highlight of the film. It's one of the most beautifully emotional scenes I've ever had the pleasure of viewing, one which has stuck in my mind months after originally seeing it. It's such a brilliant monologue that I would feel guilty spoiling the context in which it's delivered.Paris, Texas is an American fairy tale of love and redemption, where the loneliness of the vast desert plains is echoed in the sprawling cities which surround them. It defies all stereotypes and genres, creating a world unique to the art of film, where the story relies not on a sequence of contrived events but on the genuine feelings and individual experiences of the characters. It's a slow and quiet meditation on life, a subtle film of unparalleled beauty and substance. There's no doubt in my mind that it's one of the greatest films ever made.

227331,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,630024797X,Only-A-Child,"[11, 15]","Before you rush out and buy the ""Paris, Texas"" (1984) DVD based on the many glowing reviews and comments, you may want a bit of a reality check. The film is 145 minutes long, that's almost two and a half hours. And not much happens during this time. The pacing is about on the level of ""The Straight Story"" (1999), which was only 112 minutes; so if that film had you climbing the walls you should probably steer clear of this one.On the other hand ""Paris, Texas"" is a technical masterpiece with great photography, excellent directing, and solid performances from the entire cast (although that cast is small). And it's a lyrically told story about loss, loneliness, and eccentricity; a look America and American values from an outside perspective (in this case European). I'm not sure that the film's message(s) is gotten across (unless you listen to the commentary feature on the DVD and maybe not even then) but it is certainly more coherent than when Michelangelo Antonioni tried to do the same thing in the early 1970's.The film opens with a wanderer walking alone in the desert. You eventually learn that this is not Howard Hughes but Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton), that he has been missing the past four years, has semi-amnesia (a lot is made of this but the condition is never adequately explained), has a seven year-old son name Hunter (Hunter Carson), and a wife named Jane (Nastassia Kinski). Kinski fans will be somewhat disappointed as she does not even appear until the last third of the film (except briefly in some grainy home movies).The film could actually be classified as a ""buddy picture-road movie"" or two buddy picture- road movies. The first third features Travis and his brother's (Dean Stockwell) journey from Texas to LA, the final third Travis and his son's journey back to Texas. The weakest part is the middle third which serves little purpose other than providing some background details and linking the two journey segments.Because ""Paris, Texas"" is not your standard pre-sold commercial product, most of its suspense comes from the viewers themselves, who have little idea just where the film is headed. So if you watch a lot of films and are jaded because everything is so predictable, this movie viewing experience should be a nice change of pace.Because you haven't met these characters in other films, it takes a lot of storytelling to flesh them out, which is probably the biggest reason for the film's extended running length. Sam Shepard's script is not so much elliptical as it is evasive, somehow the characters tell us their most basic beliefs and deepest fears without really revealing anything about themselves (insert ""Two Lane Blacktop"" here).German New Wave director Wenders gets an astonishingly unaffected performance from young Hunter Carson, as convincing as any you are likely to find. Carson never did much after this amazing debut.The most intriguing sequences take place between Stanton and Kinski. The actors are never face-to-face as their characters speak to each other from opposite sides of one-way mirror. Travis has found Jane working in a seedy shop where lonely men pay to talk to women on the telephone.?The DP fills the screen with images of people dwarfed by vast, distant, and impersonal land/ cityscapes. The most effective and original is a sequence of Travis walking along a bridge over a LA interstate with the audio supplied by an unseen (until the end) and rambling derelict addressing the bumper to bumper traffic rushing by below.Then again, what do I know?

There are suggestions of Shepard's Fool for Love here, another tale of a love torn couple. This time around the crisis has turned Harry Dean Stanton into a mute desert walker, found by his brother Dean Stockwell. I got a laugh at how a billboard of Barbra Streisand's face in Yentl is used as iconigraphically as the opening aerial view of the barren Texan landscape. Stockwell plays the brother with such tenderness that it's no surprise that soon Stanton drops his obsessive/compulsive behaviour and reaches out to his abandoned son, performed with genius by Hunter Carson. The Super8 screening with flashbacks to the good ole days is a mistake, since it spoils the seductive mystery, and any good playwright knows to hold off on explainations until the third act. I loved Wenders use of red in the colour scheme, and Robby Muller's photography captures a storm in all it's threatening beauty. The title is perhaps Shepard at his most oblique, but everything is forgiven when Wenders stages a peepshow reunion, with a two way mirror and telephones.

You know this film was made a while ago becuase in one scene we see one of the characters smoking while on the air flight from California to Texas.  It is a story of a man who has been missing for four years.  He has been wondering thru Texas until his brother was notified about his wheeabouts.  It is a reluctant gathering between the two brothers particularly once it becomes obvious that the missing brother has 8-year old child that has been cared for by his aunt and uncle for the last four years.  Emotions, family ties, future are all at stake.  There is a mystery about marriage break up of the older brother and almost simultaneous disapperance between himself and his wife.  As story slowly unforld we learn about strong and passionate love between two people that brought them both destruction and separated them from their little boy. It is also a story about the things that we most strongly imagine that become frightening reality.  Can it be that our thought and actions are so powerful that things we fear the most can become reality?  Well this film certainly shows that is quite possible.  As Travis (main character) is found by accident, the only way he can give his family a second chance is if he disappers again.  Because his love for Jane, his wife, is still strong, but he knows well by now that it has destructive powers to it. Emotionally charged movie that requires certain sense of maturity from its audiences.  Definitely an acquired taste.

227335,A361LE16VBQDP8,630024797X,Robert Bezimienny,"[7, 8]","Criterion's Blu-ray transfer is magnificent.  The image is very natural, with great depth - I viewed this via a 1080p projector, and the transfer was as film-like as could be hoped for.  The soundtrack is as impressive - with Ry Cooder's music being so integral to the heart of the film, this improvement over DVD is very welcome.I remember first viewing this at the cinema in the 80s.  To be honest, I found it a bit gruelling.  At that time I hadn't seen much in the way of European cinema, and the American setting and actors had me expecting a film with not just a different pace but a different emotional world.Now I find 'Paris, Texas' makes me think of a strange mix of other films.Firstly, classic Westerns; most notably, 'The Searchers' - primarily for the mood evoked by the vast expanse of landscape, but also for the ultimately unfathomable motivations of the characters - however much you learn about Travis (or Ethan Edwards) the story behind their actions remains incomplete.Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' also comes to mind - again there is ravishing cinematography, and the overwhelming sense of immense space; there is also the direct connection with Sam Shepherd writing for Wenders and acting for Malick; the characters too share a terrifying vision of love, a vision that seems embodied in their physical surroundings - the superficial beauty is tied to an emotional emptiness, a kind of directionlessness, where ordinary morality is limited in its powers.  It's as if both films speak of a freedom, intoxicating and full of promise, but which is also frightening, in that anything is possible and everything feels insecure.More distant allusions reach to the 'existentialist' American road movies of the late 60s and early 70s, such as 'Vanishing Point' and 'Two-Lane Blacktop'.  Where are all these men going?  The image of the driver staring out at the world, on an inescapable journey, towards something unknowable (at the most obvious level, towards death), and away from his past - all these films share this perspective.Ry Cooder's music envelopes the film, augmenting mood, and somehow heightening the importance of any particular image - as an aside, Ry Cooder recorded the entire score in little over a day!  The music's role reminds me of Jim Jarmusch's 'Dead Man' - Neil Young's guitar likewise permeates the bones of that film.Wenders' own European background also suggests links to German cinema of the 70s, notably his own works, but also those of Herzog and Fassbinder.  The emotional pathology of the protagonists is starkly reminiscent of the narcissism, dissociation, and quasi-psychotic states of various characters inhabiting Fassbinder's prolific career, and there is a gentler association with Bruno S., especially in 'Stroszek' (once again set in America) - Travis reveals a dislocated child-like aspect to his character, touchingly played out through his contact with his son, Hunter.  The pieces of his character are not coherent, however - his chaotic inner life is glimpsed literally through windows or through telephone wires, and along with child-like sympathy, there is rage, envy, jealousy, and despair. These emotions are impossible to bear, and so they are beaten down, his face scored but impassive.  His efforts at denial detach him from reality, and Wenders' film charts his brief, and inwardly conflicted and complicated, return to the world shared by others.The other characters in 'Paris,Texas' also live at one remove from reality.  The depressing darkened world of Jane, Nastassja Kinski, is a literal as well as a metaphoric house of fantasies - one wonders if David Lynch was watching. Travis's brother Walt, Dean Stockwell, and his wife Anne, Aurore Clement, also maintain a problematic relationship with the world, despite a superficial normalcy - their stories are only hinted at, yet there is an element of fantasy in their adoption of Hunter as ""their own"" child, and Anne in particular is worried that losing Hunter will see their relationship, or in her words their ""world"", collapse.Unsurprisingly, what I've mentioned goes nowhere near exhausting ideas inspired by the film.  It is long, and the narrative is simple - but this is not what makes watching the film a demanding and taxing experience.  The emotional foundation of the film is very disturbing - there is pain, and fear, and a real sense of people being broken. This is not meant to be merely a pleasant entertainment.  It is harrowing, and it is a meditation not a diversion. The fragility of the human experience is here - in the faces, the images, the words, and most poignantly in Ry Cooder's haunted music.",5,Beautiful Blu-ray of Wenders' Dark Classic,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,4650,"['Criterion', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'magnificent', 'image', 'very', 'natural', 'great', 'depth', 'viewed', '1080p', 'projector', 'transfer', 'was', 'as', 'film-like', 'could', 'be', 'hoped', 'soundtrack', 'impressive', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'music', 'being', 'so', 'integral', 'heart', 'film', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'very', 'welcome.I', 'remember', 'first', 'viewing', 'cinema', '80s', 'be', 'honest', 'found', 'bit', 'gruelling', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'way', 'European', 'cinema', 'American', 'setting', 'actors', 'had', 'expecting', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'different', 'pace', 'different', 'emotional', 'world.Now', 'find', ""'Paris"", 'Texas', 'think', 'strange', 'mix', 'other', 'films.Firstly', 'classic', 'Westerns', 'most', 'notably', 'Searchers', 'primarily', 'mood', 'evoked', 'vast', 'expanse', 'landscape', 'also', 'ultimately', 'unfathomable', 'motivations', 'characters', 'however', 'much', 'learn', 'Travis', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'story', 'actions', 'incomplete.Terrence', 'Malick', ""'Days"", 'Heaven', 'also', 'mind', 'again', 'ravishing', 'cinematography', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'immense', 'space', 'also', 'direct', 'connection', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'writing', 'Wenders', 'acting', 'Malick', 'characters', 'too', 'share', 'terrifying', 'vision', 'love', 'vision', 'embodied', 'physical', 'surroundings', 'superficial', 'beauty', 'tied', 'emotional', 'emptiness', 'kind', 'directionlessness', 'where', 'ordinary', 'morality', 'limited', 'powers', 'films', 'speak', 'freedom', 'intoxicating', 'full', 'promise', 'also', 'frightening', 'anything', 'possible', 'everything', 'feels', 'insecure.More', 'distant', 'allusions', 'reach', ""'existentialist"", 'American', 'road', 'movies', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'such', ""'Vanishing"", 'Point', ""'Two-Lane"", 'Blacktop', 'Where', 'are', 'men', 'going', 'image', 'driver', 'staring', 'out', 'world', 'inescapable', 'journey', 'towards', 'something', 'unknowable', 'most', 'obvious', 'level', 'towards', 'death', 'away', 'past', 'films', 'share', 'perspective.Ry', 'Cooder', 'music', 'film', 'augmenting', 'mood', 'somehow', 'heightening', 'importance', 'particular', 'image', 'aside', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'recorded', 'entire', 'score', 'little', 'day', 'music', 'role', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', ""'Dead"", 'Man', 'Neil', 'Young', 'guitar', 'likewise', 'bones', 'film.Wenders', 'own', 'European', 'background', 'also', 'links', 'German', 'cinema', '70s', 'notably', 'own', 'works', 'also', 'Herzog', 'Fassbinder', 'emotional', 'pathology', 'protagonists', 'starkly', 'reminiscent', 'narcissism', 'dissociation', 'quasi-psychotic', 'states', 'various', 'characters', 'inhabiting', 'Fassbinder', 'prolific', 'career', 'gentler', 'association', 'Bruno', 'S.', 'especially', ""'Stroszek"", 'once', 'again', 'set', 'America', 'Travis', 'dislocated', 'child-like', 'aspect', 'character', 'touchingly', 'played', 'out', 'contact', 'son', 'Hunter', 'pieces', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'coherent', 'however', 'chaotic', 'inner', 'life', 'glimpsed', 'literally', 'windows', 'telephone', 'wires', 'child-like', 'sympathy', 'rage', 'envy', 'jealousy', 'despair', 'emotions', 'are', 'impossible', 'bear', 'so', 'are', 'beaten', 'down', 'face', 'scored', 'impassive', 'efforts', 'denial', 'detach', 'reality', 'Wenders', 'film', 'charts', 'brief', 'inwardly', 'conflicted', 'complicated', 'return', 'world', 'shared', 'other', 'characters', ""'Paris"", 'Texas', 'also', 'live', 'one', 'remove', 'reality', 'depressing', 'darkened', 'world', 'Jane', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'literal', 'as', 'well', 'metaphoric', 'house', 'fantasies', 'one', 'David', 'Lynch', 'was', 'watching', 'Travis', 'brother', 'Walt', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Aurore', 'Clement', 'also', 'maintain', 'problematic', 'relationship', 'world', 'superficial', 'normalcy', 'stories', 'are', 'only', 'hinted', 'yet', 'element', 'fantasy', 'adoption', 'Hunter', 'own', 'child', 'Anne', 'particular', 'worried', 'losing', 'Hunter', 'will', 'see', 'relationship', 'words', 'world', 'collapse.Unsurprisingly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'nowhere', 'exhausting', 'ideas', 'inspired', 'film', 'long', 'narrative', 'simple', 'not', 'what', 'watching', 'film', 'demanding', 'taxing', 'experience', 'emotional', 'foundation', 'film', 'very', 'disturbing', 'pain', 'fear', 'real', 'sense', 'people', 'being', 'broken', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'merely', 'pleasant', 'entertainment', 'harrowing', 'meditation', 'not', 'diversion', 'fragility', 'human', 'experience', 'here', 'images', 'words', 'most', 'poignantly', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'haunted', 'music']",N/A

227339,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,630024797X,Steven Aldersley,"[4, 5]","Paris, Texas (1984)Drama, 147 minutesDirected by Wim WendersStarring Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski and Dean StockwellThe first thing to mention about Paris, Texas is how quickly the opening scene establishes a mood. We are shown sweeping shots of a desert to the sound of Ry Cooder's haunting guitar. A man who we will later know as Travis (Stanton) comes into view. He looks like he's been wandering for days. He's wearing a red cap and jeans and his beard looks several weeks old. He wanders into an isolated bar and collapses.A local clinic tends to his injuries and contacts his brother, Walt (Stockwell), who flies from Los Angeles to collect him. It's been four years since the two last met and Walt had wondered whether Travis was still alive. Travis doesn't speak during this meeting and Walt has to show extreme patience while he waits for Travis to begin explaining what happened. In a sense, the audience is in the same situation. For almost 30 minutes, the film plays out like a total mystery.Walt wants to fly Travis home because he took in his child as his own when Travis disappeared. Travis insists that they drive, and on using the same rental car Walt drove when he picked him up. We learn that Travis has bought some land in Paris, Texas, but he can't remember why. It's clear that Travis has been through a traumatic experience and has attempted to block out those memories.Travis makes two important decisions during the story:The first could spawn all manner of debate about whether it is right or wrong. His mental health is in question, and yet he makes a decision that could drastically alter someone's life; or perhaps the lives of several people. You'll have to decide for yourself whether his actions were justified.The second decision comes as a result of a meeting with a person who used to be important in his life. In the final 25 minutes of the film, we are shown a very unusual conversation. It's tense, emotional, brave, heartbreaking and elegant all at once. It's this conversation which elevates the film to the level of greatness. The ending is almost impossible to predict early in the film, and that's something I find refreshing. Here's a film with an idea and it's perfectly executed.Harry Dean Stanton has played so many colorful characters over the years, but Paris, Texas gives him his most significant role. He gives Travis depth and the film wouldn't work without him. His appearance and haunted expression fit the character and his performance is quiet, but powerful.Nastassja Kinski's performance as Jane is a revelation. Watch the subtle emotions on her face and hear how expressive her voice can be as she responds to Stanton's monologue. I'm also impressed by Hunter Carson's realistic portrayal of a young boy.It's always interesting to see things from a different viewpoint and Wim Wenders shows us how he views America. The screenplay and Ry Cooder's score work together well. This is the kind of film that seems timeless. It's a human story set in a world so large that its characters are in danger of becoming lost, but they somehow find their way.I had to make a choice of my own in this review. Should I give away the whole story so that I could discuss some of the best scenes, or should I say just enough to set the mood? I hope that I have said enough to make you interested in seeing the film. If you do, maybe you'll understand why I withheld so much information.",5,Criterion rejuvenates another classic,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,3434,"['Paris', 'Texas', '1984', 'Drama', '147', 'minutesDirected', 'Wim', 'WendersStarring', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'Dean', 'StockwellThe', 'first', 'thing', 'mention', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'how', 'quickly', 'opening', 'scene', 'mood', 'are', 'shown', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'desert', 'sound', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'haunting', 'guitar', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'later', 'know', 'Travis', 'Stanton', 'view', 'been', 'wandering', 'days', 'wearing', 'red', 'cap', 'jeans', 'beard', 'several', 'weeks', 'old', 'isolated', 'bar', 'collapses.A', 'local', 'clinic', 'injuries', 'brother', 'Walt', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'collect', 'been', 'four', 'years', 'two', 'last', 'met', 'Walt', 'had', 'wondered', 'Travis', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'Travis', ""n't"", 'speak', 'meeting', 'Walt', 'show', 'extreme', 'patience', 'Travis', 'begin', 'explaining', 'what', 'happened', 'sense', 'audience', 'same', 'situation', 'almost', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'out', 'total', 'mystery.Walt', 'fly', 'Travis', 'home', 'took', 'child', 'own', 'when', 'Travis', 'disappeared', 'Travis', 'drive', 'using', 'same', 'rental', 'car', 'Walt', 'drove', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'learn', 'Travis', 'bought', 'land', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'clear', 'Travis', 'been', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'attempted', 'block', 'out', 'memories.Travis', 'two', 'important', 'decisions', 'story', 'first', 'could', 'spawn', 'manner', 'debate', 'right', 'wrong', 'mental', 'health', 'question', 'yet', 'decision', 'could', 'drastically', 'alter', 'someone', 'life', 'perhaps', 'lives', 'several', 'people', ""'ll"", 'have', 'decide', 'actions', 'were', 'justified.The', 'second', 'decision', 'result', 'meeting', 'person', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'important', 'life', 'final', '25', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'very', 'unusual', 'conversation', 'tense', 'emotional', 'brave', 'heartbreaking', 'elegant', 'once', 'conversation', 'film', 'level', 'greatness', 'ending', 'almost', 'impossible', 'predict', 'early', 'film', 'something', 'find', 'refreshing', 'Here', 'film', 'idea', 'perfectly', 'executed.Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'played', 'so', 'many', 'colorful', 'characters', 'years', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'most', 'significant', 'role', 'Travis', 'depth', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'appearance', 'haunted', 'expression', 'character', 'performance', 'quiet', 'powerful.Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'performance', 'Jane', 'revelation', 'Watch', 'subtle', 'emotions', 'face', 'hear', 'how', 'expressive', 'voice', 'can', 'be', 'Stanton', 'monologue', ""'m"", 'also', 'impressed', 'Hunter', 'Carson', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'young', 'boy.It', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'things', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'how', 'America', 'screenplay', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'score', 'work', 'together', 'well', 'kind', 'film', 'timeless', 'human', 'story', 'set', 'world', 'so', 'large', 'characters', 'are', 'danger', 'becoming', 'lost', 'somehow', 'find', 'way.I', 'had', 'make', 'choice', 'own', 'review', 'Should', 'give', 'away', 'whole', 'story', 'could', 'discuss', 'best', 'scenes', 'should', 'say', 'just', 'enough', 'set', 'mood', 'hope', 'have', 'said', 'enough', 'make', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'do', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'withheld', 'so', 'much', 'information']",N/A

The idea that this was Kurt Cobain's favorite film is truly something to consider.Harry Dean Stanton is the lead and if you are a fan you know the value he brings to the screen.This could arguably be his best film and there is a long list to choose from.Paris, Texas opens up with a strange man wondering randomly through the desert.A mute drifter stumbling aimlessly through the American outback.Where is he going?

227342,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,630024797X,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[3, 4]","Occasionally, a film comes along that, in its simplicity, captures the character of a landscape as well as the people in it.  Such a movie is ""Paris, Texas,"" German director Wim Wenders' second American film.  His first, ""Hammett"" (1982), was re-edited by its producer to make it more commercial.  Two years later, Wenders returned to America with European financing and full artistic freedom, and created ""Paris, Texas,"" a road movie of great visual beauty that works on several levels.The story focuses on Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton).  Our first image of the character is a distant shot of him emerging from the Southwestern desert, a scene reminiscent of Omar Sharif on camel in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" slowly approaching the camera as heat rising from the desert sands gives the scene a mirage-like effect.  Travis wanders into a small Texas town and collapses from exhaustion.  The local doctor contacts Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who, with his wife, has been raising Travis' son, Hunter.  Travis goes back to Walt's home in Los Angeles, but remains distant.  Uncomfortable with life in the suburbs, he decides to take his son and go back to Texas to find his former wife and Hunter's mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski).The movie is technically a road picture, but also explores themes of redemption and restlessness while couching itself in mystery.  We're told that Travis has been lost for five years, but are never clued in as to where he's been.  This gives a mythic aura to the character.  Man on a quest -- a modern day Don Quixote not jousting at windmills but lost in the metaphoric desert.This is the only movie in which Stanton was the star.  He's made quite a career as character actor, but this is his best role.  His rugged face suggests a man who's experienced a hard, unhappy life, and his reticence suggests a Gary Cooper-like Everyman.Wenders lets his images resonate with the viewer rather than editing quickly.  He establishes a slow pace that allows us to see what Travis and the other characters are thinking.  This is not a movie overstuffed with dialogue.  The locations -- flat sun-drenched, wide-open -- capture the beauty of the Southwest.With evocative cinematography by Robby Muller and music by Ry Cooder, ""Paris, Texas"" is a beautiful looking film with a distinctly American feel.The Criterion Blu-ray edition contains audio commentary by Wim Wenders; ""The Road to Paris, Texas,"" a 43-minute making-of documentary; deleted scenes; and a featurette containing reminiscences by Claire Denis and Allison Anders, the film's first assistant director and production assistant, respectively.",5,A Film of Haunting Beauty,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,2635,"['Occasionally', 'film', 'simplicity', 'character', 'landscape', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'movie', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'German', 'director', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'second', 'American', 'film', 'first', 'Hammett', '1982', 'was', 're-edited', 'producer', 'make', 'more', 'commercial', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Wenders', 'returned', 'America', 'European', 'financing', 'full', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'created', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'road', 'movie', 'great', 'visual', 'beauty', 'several', 'levels.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'Travis', 'Henderson', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'first', 'image', 'character', 'distant', 'shot', 'emerging', 'Southwestern', 'desert', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'camel', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'slowly', 'approaching', 'camera', 'heat', 'rising', 'desert', 'scene', 'mirage-like', 'effect', 'Travis', 'wanders', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'collapses', 'exhaustion', 'local', 'doctor', 'contacts', 'Travis', 'brother', 'Walt', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'wife', 'been', 'raising', 'Travis', 'son', 'Hunter', 'Travis', 'back', 'Walt', 'home', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'distant', 'Uncomfortable', 'life', 'suburbs', 'take', 'son', 'go', 'back', 'Texas', 'find', 'former', 'wife', 'Hunter', 'mother', 'Jane', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', '.The', 'movie', 'technically', 'road', 'picture', 'also', 'themes', 'redemption', 'restlessness', 'couching', 'mystery', ""'re"", 'told', 'Travis', 'been', 'lost', 'five', 'years', 'are', 'never', 'clued', 'as', 'where', 'been', 'mythic', 'aura', 'character', 'Man', 'quest', 'modern', 'day', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'not', 'jousting', 'windmills', 'lost', 'metaphoric', 'desert.This', 'only', 'movie', 'Stanton', 'was', 'star', 'made', 'quite', 'career', 'character', 'actor', 'best', 'role', 'rugged', 'face', 'man', 'who', 'experienced', 'hard', 'unhappy', 'life', 'reticence', 'Gary', 'Cooper-like', 'Everyman.Wenders', 'images', 'resonate', 'viewer', 'rather', 'editing', 'quickly', 'slow', 'pace', 'see', 'what', 'Travis', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'thinking', 'not', 'movie', 'overstuffed', 'dialogue', 'locations', 'flat', 'sun-drenched', 'wide-open', 'capture', 'beauty', 'Southwest.With', 'evocative', 'cinematography', 'Robby', 'Muller', 'music', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'film', 'distinctly', 'American', 'feel.The', 'Criterion', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'Road', 'Paris', 'Texas', '43-minute', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'containing', 'reminiscences', 'Claire', 'Denis', 'Allison', 'Anders', 'film', 'first', 'assistant', 'director', 'production', 'assistant', 'respectively']",N/A
227343,AQP1VPK16SVWM,630024797X,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[8, 9]","I wouldn't recommend ""Paris, Texas"" as a blind buy but if you are a fan of the film this is the ultimate edition compared to the arid DVDs that have appeared before. If you've never seen the movie you may want to rent it first to see if it's to your taste; Wim Wenders' film blends European style filmmaking with an almost literary approach to a story about a man who mysteriously disappears and then, suddenly, pops up gradually resuming his old identity and life. It's a mystery without a conclusion that doesn't focus on the why or how but on the journey back to self discovery. As such, the deliberate pacing may not be to everyone's taste but if you can appreciate the film the performances are brilliant particularly Harry Dean Stanton who must play a man that contains all of his guilt, doubts and emotions. If you can appreciate the films of Terence Malick (""Badlands"", ""Days of Heaven"", ""The New World"" and ""The Thin Red Line"") you'll enjoy Wenders work which, at least superifically, has much in common with Malick's work.""Paris, Texas"" comes across as the visual equivalent of a tone poem; Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) mysteriously shows up after 4 years in the desert. Travis would claim to remember nothing about his past if he would speak--everyone assumes he's mute until they are able to contact his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who with his wife has been raising Travis' son Hunter (Hunter Carson) as his own. Travis has returned to rediscover his life and undo the past as best he can including locating his estranged wife Jane (Natassja Kinski)who disappeared sending Travis on his own lost journey into Hades.Based on stories written by actor/playwright Sam Shepard, adapted by L. M. ""Kit"" Carson and directed by German director Wim Wenders (""Wings of Desire"", ""The American Friend"", ""Buena Vista Social Club"")""Paris, Texas"" makes the landscape as much a character as those we are following in the film. Having said that, this film is acquired taste with a pace more in keeping with later indie films (and, in fact, the feel of ""Paris, Texas"" has much in common with the films that Terence Malick made at the time and continues to make)--it's much more a mediative piece on the loss of self, memory and Travis' attempt to reclaim what is lost after trauma.The Criterion edition features a stunning looking HD transfer (at one point you can see vultures circling over prey in the distance). There is a depth only hinted at on previous transfers, colors pop and the film has been scrubbed of flaws. Ry Cooder's marvelous score has never sounded so good with a rich sounding lossless presentation.The special features (which are always a highlight of Criterion editions)are exceptional: we get excerpts from a 1990 documentary on Wenders featuring interviews with a wide variety of admirers and collaborators from Peter Falk to novelist Patricia Highsmith (who wrote ""The American Friend""); an interview with Wenders, new video interviews; a 1984 French TV special about Wenders' work; deleted scenes and super 8 home movies from the film are also included and we get a gallery of Wenders' scouting location photos. The original theatrical trailer is included plus we get an excellent audio commentary from Wenders, behind the scene photos and a booklet with critic Nick Roddick's essay on the film as well as vintage interviews with Shepard, Kinski, Stockwell.For fans of ""Paris, Texas"" the Criterion edition is the standard on Blu-ray (and DVD). The film has never looked better nor has it ever received such a lovingly detailed history on its production.
