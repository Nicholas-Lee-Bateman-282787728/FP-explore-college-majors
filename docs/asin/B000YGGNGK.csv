1119694,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B000YGGNGK,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[2, 2]","After a somewhat shakey start in its short first season, ""Barney Miller"", here in the second season, develops the format that made it so popular that it could last eight seasons. Although Barney's wife, Liz, is shown in the show's opening we actually see her very little, which I think was the right move. Whereas in the first season we see numerous scenes that take place outside the squad room, by the second season, almost all activity is restricted to that one set.  However, the most important change was making Wojo (played by Max Gail) the frequent main focus of the stories.  I think this came as a disappointment to Gregory Sierra who played Sgt Chano Amangual, the Puerto Rican detective who left the show after this season. Sierra was the most well-known actor when the series began, and yet as the second season progresses, we see less and less of him and there are few episodes in which he is the focus of attention. In the first season there was an episode that showed him undergoing a crisis because he was forced to shoot and kill and suspect and we see him in anguish over this, an episode in which he was able to show his acting abilities to the fullest.  However, the creators of the show felt that this type of story was not appropriate for a comedy so by the second season we no longer see stories of this type.  I presume that it was frustration over this that led Sierra to leave the series, which I think was unfortunate.  Linda Lavin appears in several episodes as Det. Wentworth, but this also didn't last very long.  Steve Landesberg is introduced as Fish's nemesis, Det Arthur Dietrich. Although we don't see much of him in this second season, he later became one of the stars of the show and we see flashes of his dry humor that added so much to the show.  I also feel that Abe Vigoda's role as Det Philip K Fish was too restricted because almost everything he says is a complaint about his age, his health, his wife Bernice and his need to go to the restroom. Having mentioned these minor complaints of mine, I still want to say that the show is one of the finest comedy series ever made. Many comedies of the 1970's that I once found hilarious, such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""Bob Newhart"" and ""All in the Family"" now seem dated to me but ""Barney Miller"" is the exception and it is still fresh as it was then.My favorite episode is ""Fear of Flying"" in which Wojo's reluctance to fly in an airplane while extraditing a prisoner to Cleveland (of all places!) is the centerpiece. His charge is a bigamist played by the always deadpan Jack Riley and whose wife in New York, played by the underappreciated actress Valerie Curtin shows up at the 12th Precinct and overdoses on sleeping pills. Wojo calls the hospital and they tell him that she must ""emtpy her stomach....you know...upchuck!"" as Wojo tells Barney in his inimitable Polish way.  Upon hearing this everyone turns to Yemana and says ""give her coffee!"".  See it for yourself to see how it turns out!",5,"""Barney Miller"" Really Gets Rolling",1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,2981,"['somewhat', 'shakey', 'start', 'short', 'first', 'season', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'here', 'second', 'season', 'format', 'made', 'so', 'popular', 'could', 'last', 'eight', 'seasons', 'Barney', 'wife', 'Liz', 'shown', 'show', 'opening', 'actually', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'think', 'was', 'right', 'move', 'Whereas', 'first', 'season', 'see', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'squad', 'room', 'second', 'season', 'almost', 'activity', 'restricted', 'one', 'set', 'However', 'most', 'important', 'change', 'was', 'making', 'Wojo', 'played', 'Max', 'Gail', 'frequent', 'main', 'focus', 'stories', 'think', 'came', 'disappointment', 'Gregory', 'Sierra', 'who', 'played', 'Sgt', 'Chano', 'Amangual', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'detective', 'who', 'left', 'show', 'season', 'Sierra', 'was', 'most', 'well-known', 'actor', 'when', 'series', 'began', 'yet', 'second', 'season', 'progresses', 'see', 'less', 'less', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'focus', 'attention', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'episode', 'showed', 'undergoing', 'crisis', 'was', 'forced', 'shoot', 'kill', 'suspect', 'see', 'anguish', 'episode', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'acting', 'abilities', 'fullest', 'However', 'creators', 'show', 'felt', 'type', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'appropriate', 'comedy', 'so', 'second', 'season', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'stories', 'type', 'presume', 'was', 'frustration', 'led', 'Sierra', 'leave', 'series', 'think', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'Linda', 'Lavin', 'several', 'episodes', 'Det', 'Wentworth', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'Steve', 'Landesberg', 'introduced', 'Fish', 'nemesis', 'Det', 'Arthur', 'Dietrich', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'second', 'season', 'later', 'became', 'one', 'stars', 'show', 'see', 'flashes', 'dry', 'humor', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'also', 'feel', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'role', 'Det', 'Philip', 'K', 'Fish', 'was', 'too', 'restricted', 'almost', 'everything', 'complaint', 'age', 'health', 'wife', 'Bernice', 'need', 'go', 'restroom', 'Having', 'mentioned', 'minor', 'complaints', 'mine', 'still', 'want', 'say', 'show', 'one', 'finest', 'comedy', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'Many', 'comedies', '1970', 'once', 'found', 'hilarious', 'such', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Family', 'now', 'seem', 'dated', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'exception', 'still', 'fresh', 'was', 'then.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Fear', 'Flying', 'Wojo', 'reluctance', 'fly', 'airplane', 'extraditing', 'prisoner', 'Cleveland', 'places', 'centerpiece', 'charge', 'bigamist', 'played', 'always', 'deadpan', 'Jack', 'Riley', 'wife', 'New', 'York', 'played', 'underappreciated', 'actress', 'Valerie', 'Curtin', 'up', '12th', 'Precinct', 'overdoses', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'Wojo', 'hospital', 'tell', 'must', 'emtpy', 'stomach', '.you', 'know', 'upchuck', 'Wojo', 'Barney', 'inimitable', 'Polish', 'way', 'hearing', 'everyone', 'Yemana', 'give', 'coffee', 'See', 'see', 'how', 'out']",Barney Miller: Season 2

I couldn't wait to get Seasons 2, and 3 in the mail. For me it had been a long time since I had watched any of the Barney Miller episodes. I was quite pleased with the product. My only beef was the video quality, of course the show was filmed in the late 70's, and early 80's. When I played the DVD on my 42 LCD flat screen I quite shocked how poor the video was on the DVD. There were times when there was a long shot of the squad room, and it was blurry, then when they switched back to a close up showing two of the detectives the picture immediately cleared up.  Also on almost every video on the far left there are vertical lines side of the TV screen, although this is only visible on a panel HDTV. If I played the same DVD on one of my older CRT tv's, you couldn't see the lines. That is my only beef. I have all the Columbo DVD's, and those movies were filmed in the 1970's, and the picture quality on my flat screen with them is excellent.If you are a die hard Barney Miller fan  I strongly recommend that you buy these DVD's.

Fish is on the verge of retirement, we even get an episode of him at home. Harris begins his writing career for the local police newspaper.The comedy is turned on high, we can't help but laugh at what goes on at Precinct 12.

1119703,AZJRZOV6S0KVD,B000YGGNGK,"JohnG ""JohnG""","[9, 9]","Barney Miller was(along with Hill Street Blues and the first three seasons of MASH) the last prime-time, commercial television show that I actually scheduled into my weekly ""To-Do"" list, so I greeted with absolute elation the news that somebody had finally made the second season available. I check here almost daily to see if additional seasons have been released (and would appreciate if anybody in the know would let me know if the release of additional seasons are on the way.)It isn't hard to figure out why Barney M. was, and still is, the high watermark in television comedy: Good writing. The story, the humor was everything. No exotic sets (basically the entire eight seasons are shot in the squad room) no special effects, no sex, no violence. All the money seems to have been spent on writing good scripts. The cast look, talk and act like real, believable people in the real world. (There are actually old people in the cast, women who don't bulge from low-cut blouses and parents that don't look like high school students.) Even more amazing, most of the characters dealt with here are actually non-people like taxi drivers, plumbers, waitresses and street urchins who take a bus to work. Everybody in entertainment today knows that real people are doctors, lawyers, advertising executives, bankers and handsome corporate heads who drive expensive sports cars. Character development is fantastic, and even semi-regulars  like Lugar and Skanlon are unique, superbly developed characters..and hilarious.This show is, above all, a rare adult comedy.

Fans of the Barney Miller Show will be happy to see that the wait is finally over and perhaps we can even hope that subsequent years will be released at a much more rapid pace than what we've seen so far.While the first season was short and still finding its way, we start to see the show develop into its true routine here. Barney's wife is in just two episodes (a welcome relief) and life in the squad room clearly takes center stage. The one exception to that rule is a single episode that revolves around Fish (Abe Vigoda) that feels very much like a pilot for a spinoff series that never happened. That same episode also introduces the character of Det. Dietrich (Steve Landesberg) who becomes a regular in Season Three.Watching these episodes again after such a long time has been a real treat. The cast is stellar and the writing much more intelligent than the typical sitcom. Abe Vigoda is especially deserving of praise as his deadpan delivery makes almost anything seem funny. If you're a fan of the show, you will definitely want Season Two.

Today's ""cop shows"" are so obsessed with realism that they forget the value of a little perspective, especially a humorous one.  Like MASH, Barney Miller can take you from a guffaw to tears in a heartbeat, and the streets of New York City in the 70s provide an even more varied backdrop than does the Korean (or its analogue, the Vietnam) war.The episodes in this collection are classic, from ""The Layoff"" which was written in response to the city's plea to the Federal Government for emergency funding, to which the Feds responded with a resounding ""Drop Dead"" to the colorful characters that are always multidimensional and unique.  The quality of this show is unsurpassed.  I sincerely hope that the rest of these shows are released at reasonable intervals.
