1140239,A3SBCBEN4NGK5I,B00133KFJO,B-Movie Fan,"[5, 8]","Good idea - lousy execution.  Also, please note that the movie description is misleading.  Jaime Pressly does not play one of the participants in the ""fake"" reality TV show that the killer is filming.  She is dead about ten minutes into the movie, before the ""reality show"" gets started.This isn't the worst horror movie of the year.  The actors and actresses are easy on the eyes.  The death scenes aren't the worst you'll see in a direct to video horror movie.  Although not great, the acting isn't that bad (for a direct to video release.)  But what about the story . . .A group of college students are locked in a compound in the desert and participate in ""Survivor"" style challenges in order to win a million dollars.  What they don't know is that the losers are being killed off.A reality show where contestants get killed off is a great hook for a horror movie.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't do much with that hook.  It does a lousy job of developing the characters (and yes, even a horror film should have some kind of character development or at least some decent back-stories)  For example, we have the self-described ""goofy guy"" who seems like a decent enough sort.  Before anyone know that the people who get voted off the show are being killed and that all the participants are in danger, he almost kills another participant to win an immunity challenge.  Later, it becomes apparent to him and everyone else that people are ""really"" being killed.So, after he knows that the show is ""real"" and that people are dieing, why does he ""literally"" stab another participant in the back to win an immunity challenge?  Is he that afraid of dieing?  Does he feel guilt?  Do the other participants resent him murdering one of their own?  Do they worry that he might kill one of them next?  Who knows, the movie doesn't get around to telling us.Similarly, there are some great angles that this film fails to explore.  In this ""reality show"" the participants vote to have participants kicked ""off"" the show each night.  That leads to some drama and tension between characters even before they know that the ""losers"" are getting killed.  How cool would a scene have been where they are ""forced"" to vote a person ""off"" the show (and to a certain death) ""after"" they know what is really going on?  Just another missed opportunity for this movie.  (The largest probably being when they decide to kill off the only ""name"" actress in the first scene . . .)Save yourself some time and don't buy or rent this movie.",2,Disappointing and Misleading,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,2511,"['Good', 'idea', 'lousy', 'execution', 'Also', 'please', 'note', 'movie', 'description', 'misleading', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'not', 'play', 'one', 'participants', 'fake', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'killer', 'filming', 'dead', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'reality', 'show', 'started.This', ""n't"", 'worst', 'horror', 'movie', 'year', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'easy', 'eyes', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'worst', ""'ll"", 'see', 'direct', 'video', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'direct', 'video', 'release', 'what', 'story', '.A', 'group', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'locked', 'compound', 'desert', 'participate', 'Survivor', 'style', 'challenges', 'order', 'win', 'million', 'dollars', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'losers', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'off.A', 'reality', 'show', 'where', 'contestants', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'great', 'hook', 'horror', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'hook', 'lousy', 'job', 'developing', 'characters', 'yes', 'even', 'horror', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'kind', 'character', 'development', 'least', 'decent', 'back-stories', 'example', 'have', 'self-described', 'goofy', 'guy', 'who', 'decent', 'enough', 'sort', 'anyone', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'voted', 'off', 'show', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'participants', 'are', 'danger', 'almost', 'participant', 'win', 'immunity', 'challenge', 'Later', 'apparent', 'everyone', 'else', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'being', 'killed.So', 'show', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'dieing', 'why', 'literally', 'stab', 'participant', 'back', 'win', 'immunity', 'challenge', 'afraid', 'dieing', 'feel', 'guilt', 'Do', 'other', 'participants', 'resent', 'murdering', 'one', 'own', 'Do', 'worry', 'might', 'kill', 'one', 'next', 'Who', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'telling', 'us.Similarly', 'are', 'great', 'angles', 'film', 'explore', 'reality', 'show', 'participants', 'vote', 'have', 'participants', 'kicked', 'show', 'night', 'drama', 'tension', 'characters', 'even', 'know', 'losers', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'How', 'cool', 'would', 'scene', 'have', 'been', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'vote', 'person', 'show', 'certain', 'death', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Just', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'movie', 'largest', 'probably', 'being', 'when', 'decide', 'kill', 'off', 'only', 'name', 'actress', 'first', 'scene', 'Save', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'rent', 'movie']",Cruel World

1140244,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B00133KFJO,Richard Ross,"[7, 9]","Phillip (Edward Furlong) is a little unstable since he was rejected on live T.V. on some dumb dating show. He's waited years to get his revenge on the girl (Jaime Pressly) who humiliated him and after murdering her he moves into her mansion where he lures nine unsuspecting people to participate in his own twisted reality show. Thinking they are appearing on a ""Survivor for College Kids"" type show where they can win a cool $1 million, the kids have no idea the danger that lays ahead. Like any actual reality show the kids all fit stereotypes: the Southern guy is a hick farmer, the Southern gal is the most promiscuous, the Gay guy is the cattiest, the Asian is skilled in karate, and the Latina curses out her competitors in Spanish. The stud (sleazed to perfection by Andrew Keegan) actually tells the girls that he's the guy their mothers warned them about. The challenges include locking themselves in coffin like crates and fumbling around in green goo until they can unlock themselves from the inside. Those who lose are ""sent home"". Things go from gross to gory as challenges grow to include carving raw, bloody meat from a hanging cow carcass and then eating it. The movie's pretty gross but it's also a lot of fun. There are three really hot girls (Laura Ramsey, Sanoe Lake, and Aimee Garcia) and Keegan is debauched perfection. Furlong is hilarious and Daniel Franzese, who plays Phillip's slow brother Claude, is wonderfully weird. These two make the movie worth a watch. The film ends on a cliffhanger that sets up the possibility of a sequel but I doubt that's gonna happen any time soon.

1140245,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00133KFJO,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","The formula for Horror is very simple. Outrageous characters, creepy music, blood, and lots of beautiful people, but Cruel World is one of those rare Horror films that actually has a story worth telling. After being scorned on a reality dating show, Philip Markham (Edward Furlong) has decided to create his own show. A fear factor type competition with a one million dollar reward. The only problem is when you lose the game, you lose your life, a stipulation the contestants weren't previously aware of. This was a fun film for me, because not only is it original, but it has a cast full of seldom seen 90s teen idols. My regular readers know by now that I consider Edward Furlong to be one of the hardest working, most under appreciated actors in all of Hollywood, but to be honest, he wasn't anything special in this film. Furlong's character is one of those evil geniuses that really seems to be all bark and no bite. The true stars of this film are the lesser known contestants like, Andrew Keegan and Sanoe Lake. The contestants are all oblivious and watching them trying to figure things out under the guise of winning a competition was really clever. The contestants and the competitions are really what helps to distinguish this film from all the other slash films. While including the four elements, and finding a lot of reasons for the pretty people to take their cloths off, there is actually a better than average story here and an experienced cast. The combination of the two make this film much more entertaining than the slasher films you've become accustom to. While I was disappointed in the fact that Edward Furlong couldn't carry this film in the way I've become accustom to seeing, there were still plenty of great performances and exciting moments. If you're a big Horror fan like I am, and you're looking for something a little bit different, give Cruel World a try.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,1890,"['formula', 'Horror', 'very', 'simple', 'Outrageous', 'characters', 'creepy', 'music', 'blood', 'lots', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Cruel', 'World', 'one', 'rare', 'Horror', 'films', 'actually', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'being', 'scorned', 'reality', 'dating', 'show', 'Philip', 'Markham', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'decided', 'create', 'own', 'show', 'fear', 'factor', 'type', 'competition', 'one', 'million', 'dollar', 'reward', 'only', 'problem', 'when', 'lose', 'game', 'lose', 'life', 'stipulation', 'contestants', 'were', ""n't"", 'previously', 'aware', 'was', 'fun', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'original', 'cast', 'full', 'seldom', 'seen', '90s', 'teen', 'idols', 'regular', 'readers', 'know', 'now', 'consider', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'be', 'one', 'hardest', 'working', 'most', 'appreciated', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'honest', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'film', 'Furlong', 'character', 'one', 'evil', 'geniuses', 'really', 'be', 'bark', 'bite', 'true', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'lesser', 'known', 'contestants', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', 'Sanoe', 'Lake', 'contestants', 'are', 'oblivious', 'watching', 'trying', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'guise', 'winning', 'competition', 'was', 'really', 'clever', 'contestants', 'competitions', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'distinguish', 'film', 'other', 'slash', 'films', 'including', 'four', 'elements', 'finding', 'lot', 'reasons', 'pretty', 'people', 'take', 'cloths', 'actually', 'better', 'average', 'story', 'here', 'experienced', 'cast', 'combination', 'two', 'make', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'slasher', 'films', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustom', 'was', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'could', ""n't"", 'carry', 'film', 'way', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustom', 'seeing', 'were', 'still', 'plenty', 'great', 'performances', 'exciting', 'moments', ""'re"", 'big', 'Horror', 'fan', 'am', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'give', 'Cruel', 'World', 'try']",Cruel World
