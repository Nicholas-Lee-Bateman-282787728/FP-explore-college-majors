1274601,AF342RETPCOK7,B002KH4KSY,Adam Lambert,"[7, 10]",I love the original children of the corn film but this one leaves you wanting more. The problem with this one they leave out all the best parts that made the original so good. Plus the actor that played Isaac did not fit at all. John Fraklin who played Isaac in the original made him creepy. But Preston Bailey  makes Isaac out to be just a little annoying snot nose kid. The actor who played Maliki I thought was better but still not the best. Overall this film wasn't bad it just didn't add up to the original. They are suppose to release a unrated cut on October 6th maybe that will be better.,3,It could of been better,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,596,"['love', 'original', 'children', 'corn', 'film', 'one', 'wanting', 'more', 'problem', 'one', 'leave', 'out', 'best', 'parts', 'made', 'original', 'so', 'good', 'actor', 'played', 'Isaac', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'John', 'Fraklin', 'who', 'played', 'Isaac', 'original', 'made', 'creepy', 'Preston', 'Bailey', 'Isaac', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'annoying', 'snot', 'nose', 'kid', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Maliki', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'still', 'not', 'best', 'Overall', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'original', 'are', 'suppose', 'release', 'unrated', 'cut', 'October', '6th', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'better']",N/A

Unlikely, yes, and even more unlikely is that the woman is the black one.The woman is loud, mean, and constantly complaining.  Constantly.  The man seems cool headed and has recently returned from a tour in 'Nam.  I hope the woman gets killed but I doubt it.  She really needs to die.  I'm surprised the husband hasn't done it already.  Seriously, she's taking jabs at him about Vietnam, calling him a rapist and child killer and stuff.  Not cool.  Why hasn't he smacked the face off her?  She is begging for it.  C'mon.  Domestic violence laws weren't as crippling back then.The first 35 minutes of this movie was them fighting in the car.  It was just as annoying as watching a couple fight in real life.Oh my god I just saw the man just do a Steven Segal move where he broke a kid's arm bones out.  Oh he just killed a kid.  I guess his frantic wife was right haha.I'm not sure what the point of this movie is, or what the ""moral"" is supposed to be.  Religion is bad?  I'll go with that... as long as we include KING's religion.The new Issac is weak.  I can barely understand him.  He mumbles and is too quiet.  And why does Malaci always have blood all over him?  Shouldn't he wash his hands?  I would.  I hate sticky hands!Why can't they just re-do movies with better film and effects?  It always seems like the acting is WORSE.  And the directors always want to change the story to ""make it their own"".  Get a life.The man is having Vietnam flashbacks in the corn field now.  He just killed 2 kids.  More flashbacks.  Lots of blonde kids here.  Naturally they are evil.  Nothing more evil than blonde people and Nazis.  Remember WW2?  This movie is really bad.  He just stabbed a 5 year old blonde kid in the juggler.Dinner time at the kid's camp.  Fat girl just slapped someone's hand who was trying to take her plate of corn.  Funny.  Oh now here's the ""Time of Fertilization"" aka the underage sex scene.  This is inappropriate and just creepy.  What kind of sick director would insist on showing this?  Little kids are watching them do it and are cheering them on.  Wow that was so very wrong.  Glad my daughter wasn't watching this movie with me.  Instead of Fertilization Time, maybe a funeral would be more appropriate?  I mean, 5 or so kids died today.Are these kids Amish?  Only Amish kids dress like that, from what I've seen.  And I grew up in Iowa.Wow they really did kill the wife.  Good.  I expect the guy will die too now.  So now I don't really care about anyone in this movie.  Oh the guy just died.  The end.Oh not the end.  They have an after credits scene.  It isn't worth watching.

I liked Rob Zombies Halloween and Halloween 2 remakes, it was totally diff and was it's own movie. The Friday the 13th remake disappointed me, but I was ok with it and still bought it. So when I heard about this one and even read the reviews I still gave it a chance, boy was I wrong, this was a total taken word for word from the short story, which I read a few days before I watched this remake. I actually liked the short story so I went into this movie with an opened mind. So I am going to say, that the problem is not the script, but more or less the presentation of it. The burt was ok, but the lady playing vicky was annoying as hell and made me wanna stab sissors in my ears. The kid playing isaac was boring dull and talked with a monotone voice, was not creepy, was not scary was not imposing or anything and made me wanna fall asleep as if I was in an old baptist church listing to a dull sermon. The guy that played Malachi was a joke he was not scary and did not have the same power the guy from the 1st was had. It was very thrown togather and sloppy. I also hated the teen sex secne in front of 9 year old kids, thought that was very tacky and not tastefull. Avoid this movie its not good and will make you fall asleep.

SWan,"[0, 0]","I have read many other reviews on here about the distasteful elements of the movie, but isn't that the point of going to the movies to begin with? In this genre of movies especially, shock value is what makes a movie the critics either have a love for,or an absolute sheer hatred for. Yes... it is true there are a few moments in the movie that left me feeling uneasy... but when you really think about the context of what Stephan King had written in his short story, that was the point; NOT TO FOLLOW BLINDLY IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OTHERS. As we all know children are the most easily swayed in politics, religion, what have you. Obviously I don't know what was going on in Kings head when he wrote the short story, but if I had to guess, I would conclude that children are probably the most savage creatures out there. When you think about it, Children of the Corn taps into that essence of following the crowd, and what can happen when lynching becomes a lifestyle. Follow what's popular, or we'll lynch you, pick on you, torture you, heck we might even kill you, right? A child's moral status isn't fully established, depending on the environment and so forth.

1274609,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B002KH4KSY,David Girod,"[0, 0]","I will give the filmmakers credit in that they did try to stick a bit more closely to King's original short story...but that's a problem. It's a short story, under 20 pages in length, and they have to make a 90 minute film, so you know this thing will be padded to the gills.Right off the bat we see the kids of Gatlin, Nebraska in a tent revival being preached to by a very timid looking Isaac in 1963? I know I'm in trouble now..Isaac should be all ""hellfire"" & ""damnation"", and while this little actor may be saying the right things...he's too adorable. It's like listening to Cindy Brady read the lyrics to a death metal song, it just doesn't work.Flash forward to the mid-70's (of course, no one talks or looks like someone from the mid-70's), we meet a bickering couple on the backroads of Nebraska as they argue along a road passing a huge cornfield. The couple argues, and kid with a cut throat comes stumbling out of the corn, and as the couple argues, they hit the dying kid with their car. Getting of the car arguing, the couple walk over and argue over the corpse. While arguing about what to do next, they argue some more. Arguing, the couple put the dead body in the back of the car and decide to argue their way into Gatlin to find help, while arguing. Arguing, they arrive in Gatlin, and they argue getting out of the car, and argue themselves into a deserted diner where they argue. Finally they separate to look for help, and still manage to argue, even when they are not together. Pretty soon the kids show to murder these two...and thank god, I'm actually rooting for them to succeed just so the arguing will stop.Now we get a prolonged chase through the corn. Lots of running and ducking in the corn, so much running and ducking that our hero flashes back to Vietnam. The kids chase the guy through the corn, and they even have a flashback montage of all of the events from the opening of the movie...and we see some more arguing. They are still running through corn.This movie is just awful. I enjoyed the original Linda Hamilton, 80's slasher version of this tale, but this was a complete waste of time. Honestly, the first hour of this film is spent with this grating couple driving around arguing, and that is not an exaggeration. I'm not quite sure what they were going for, as you honestly begin to loathe these people, and hope to see them die just to shut them up! The casting is just so bad, with only the kid playing Malachai being somewhat decent, the rest of the kids are just awful. Toss in a bizarre and rather explicit sex scene, and the desperation by the filmmakers to shock just oozes out of the DVD player.Nothing to recommend, and I can see why King refused to have anything to do with movie.",1,He Who Walks Into Nam Flashbacks,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,2733,"['will', 'give', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'did', 'try', 'stick', 'bit', 'more', 'closely', 'King', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'problem', 'short', 'story', '20', 'pages', 'length', 'have', 'make', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'know', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'padded', 'gills.Right', 'bat', 'see', 'kids', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'tent', 'revival', 'being', 'preached', 'very', 'timid', 'looking', 'Isaac', '1963', 'know', ""'m"", 'trouble', 'now..Isaac', 'should', 'be', 'hellfire', 'damnation', 'little', 'actor', 'may', 'be', 'saying', 'right', 'things', 'too', 'adorable', 'listening', 'Cindy', 'Brady', 'read', 'lyrics', 'death', 'metal', 'song', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.Flash', 'forward', 'mid-70', 'course', 'one', 'talks', 'someone', 'mid-70', 'meet', 'bickering', 'couple', 'backroads', 'Nebraska', 'argue', 'road', 'passing', 'huge', 'cornfield', 'couple', 'kid', 'cut', 'throat', 'stumbling', 'corn', 'couple', 'argues', 'hit', 'dying', 'kid', 'car', 'Getting', 'car', 'arguing', 'couple', 'walk', 'argue', 'corpse', 'arguing', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'argue', 'more', 'Arguing', 'couple', 'put', 'dead', 'body', 'back', 'car', 'decide', 'argue', 'way', 'Gatlin', 'find', 'help', 'arguing', 'Arguing', 'arrive', 'Gatlin', 'argue', 'getting', 'car', 'argue', 'deserted', 'diner', 'where', 'argue', 'Finally', 'separate', 'look', 'help', 'still', 'manage', 'argue', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'together', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'kids', 'show', 'murder', 'two', 'thank', 'god', ""'m"", 'actually', 'rooting', 'succeed', 'just', 'so', 'arguing', 'will', 'stop.Now', 'get', 'prolonged', 'chase', 'corn', 'Lots', 'running', 'ducking', 'corn', 'so', 'much', 'running', 'ducking', 'hero', 'back', 'Vietnam', 'kids', 'chase', 'guy', 'corn', 'even', 'have', 'flashback', 'montage', 'events', 'opening', 'movie', 'see', 'more', 'arguing', 'are', 'still', 'running', 'corn.This', 'movie', 'just', 'awful', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', '80', 'slasher', 'version', 'tale', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'Honestly', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'spent', 'grating', 'couple', 'driving', 'arguing', 'not', 'exaggeration', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'honestly', 'begin', 'loathe', 'people', 'hope', 'see', 'die', 'just', 'shut', 'up', 'casting', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'only', 'kid', 'playing', 'Malachai', 'being', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'rest', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'awful', 'Toss', 'bizarre', 'rather', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scene', 'desperation', 'filmmakers', 'shock', 'just', 'oozes', 'DVD', 'player.Nothing', 'recommend', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'King', 'refused', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'movie']",N/A
1274610,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B002KH4KSY,David J. Brown,"[7, 10]","I was stoked when there were reports that the original Children of the Corn was being remade by the original film's producers.  Actually, the first time I heard this was about a month ago on the new Anchor Bay Blu-Ray release of the original film.  This is the type of film that should be remade.  The original film had its moments, but was ultimately more goofy then scary, and really strayed way too far from the original King short story.  I mean, come on!  If I knew 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" was an orange dust cloud with an animated skull in it mushrooming up into the air, I probably wouldn't have kept watching.So here we are with yet ANOTHER REMAKE of a film from the 80's.  Sure, the original is no prize so I thought it novel to remake it.  Even better was the producers dusted off King's draft of the screenplay for the 1984 to act as their springboard.  Unfortunately, they rewrote it and made it even worse then the original.  It doesn't even have the benefit of the original's unintentional humor, and hysterically unscary lead baddie performance of Isaac.  The only thing this film retains from King's short story is the fact that our protagonists are the same bickering couple from the short story as opposed to the first film's in sync couple.  Guess what?  The acting is so annoying that instead of getting a couple that legitimately has problems we're just harranged for an hour and a hallf of a wife biting her husband's head off.  A husband who was a Vietman Vet, the remake is set in 1975.  So, guess who's suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome?  You guessed right, and the results are hilarious audio flashbacks at the film's climax, and bullet streaks flying through the air.  The director of this remake obviously wanted to make a statement in regard to violence and its effects in the real world, but I think it's more half baked window dressing then anything of meaning.How can I be sure about the director's intentions?  Well, the DVD comes with a 45 minute making of doc that allows this pompous, talentless hack expause such lofty intentions.  I don't want to sound like a meanine, but this guy seriously spends just as much time putting down the original flick as he does talking up his new version.  It's almost like he doesn't take credit for being involved with the first Children of the Corn at all.  Really lame self promotion.  Oh, and if you're wondering if the great unholy God of this series actually shows up at the end of the film the way King described him in half a paragraph in the original story, you'll be bummed again.  Whether or not his final appearance is as lame as the original's orange mushroom cloud is up to you to decide.The acting is all uniformly terrible.  It's by the numbers.  The only actors who seem to be trying are the possessed kids, but the problem with that is they come off more like petulent brats then malevolent demonic entities.  Sorry, I'm almost convinced that this King story can't be served well on the screen ever.  His main villains are small children.  Child actors just can't pull off the kind of otheworldly malevolence in any believable way.  Sure, they look cute and they're doing nasty things, but one never buys that they are truly evil, but more of a cheap horror effect.  Nothing gets to the more simple minded viewer faster and easier then showing a cute kid with a blank stare doing something awful.  It's cheap scare tactics that don't even work.Bottom line, is this thing was premiered and made in conjunction with the Sci-Fi, oops, I mean Sy-Fy(the further dumbing of America in full evidence), so you know the hit and miss average of quality from past efforts.  I know there are many out there that have been waiting to see King's story finally get the proper treatment.  It's even worse knowing that King himself wrote a screenplay, THAT NO PRODUCER HAS EVEN USED OR EVEN CRIBBED FROM YET!  Why?  Maybe King should buy back the rights to his script and try making this thing on his own with Darabont or Garris--his most trusted film collaborators.

How's that for classy?  I don't remember anything like that in Stephen King's original short story but the makers of this film swear they are being faithful to the source material.  In many ways they are but this film is so ineptly executed that it is an even bigger insult to Stephen King than the original (not so bad) film was.The only bright spot in this rancid remake is Daniel Newman as Malachi.  That guy can act and he gives Courtney Gaines a run for his money with his amazing and sympathetic portrayal of Malachi.  Aside from Newman the rest of the acting is simply awful, particularly from the ""children"" who seem barely able to speak english.  The kid playing Isaac isn't even elementary school play material.  This kid is an absolutely rotten actor.The script, while in theory is closer to the story, brings in all sorts of nonsense about Burt being a Viet Nam vet who is apparently experiencing post-traumatic stress in the corn field (and of course we get the obligatory flash back sequences). If you thought the original film was slow paced, try sitting through this snooze fest.  Burt and Vicki yack and yack with a dead body in the trunk and then Burt wanders through the corn for a half hour experiencing flash backs that are just pointless and sleep inducing.And guess what?  The original film had BETTER visual effects in it than this one since this remake has ABSOLUTELY NO visual effects whatsoever.  YOU WON'T SEE HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS IN THIS FILM.  Not even a glimpse.  Not even a big fluffy glowing cloud formation.  Not a gopher from hell in sight.  NOTHING.  THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER.What a complete waste.  Yes the movie ends like the story with Burt and Vicki dead on crosses with their eyes gouged out but to see the actual end of the film you have to watch the credits all the way to the end and then the film picks up again with the children out in the corn field about to act out the finale of the film.  Why on earth this was done is a complete mystery.  Perhaps incompetent director Donald Borchers forgot to film any connecting scenes and decided to show the credits before inserting the final portion of the film.  Who knows.  It's all so amateurish, awful and absurd that you won't care and probably won't make it through more than a few minutes of this entirely terrible film.Well...maybe not entirely terrible as the set design in the church is a little better than in the first film and the haunting theme music of Johnathan Elias is retained for this version.  And of course there is the truly excellent performance by Daniel Newman as Malachi.

David Anders is more interesting than the character Peter Horton played in the original -- this time, we get a former Marine from Vietnam instead of the just-graduated emergency room doctor.  The woman who plays Vicky in this movie, instead of Linda Hamilton, is also great.  These two fight constantly and are on the verge of a divorce, which is more interesting than the lovely dovey couple that Horton and Hamilton played back in 1984.But, they are the only two who are better actors than in the original. The child actors in this are awful, especially the one playing Isaac.  He is so bad that at times I felt like I was watching a grade school parents' night play.  Just awful.I also miss the two good kids from the original -- Job and Sarah.  Without them, the town's just full of evil, crazy kids and the movie's less interesting.I also miss the weird old guy who ran the filling station in the original movie...he was not in this one.I read the original Stephen King short story and this adaptation does better reflect the plot of that story...but it's missing the best parts of the 1984 movie.I actually started this review giving the movie a 3...but as I wrote this, I have been thinking on that and realize it's at best a 2-star in terms of ratings.A movie like this is really a success based on who plays the Isaac character...the leader of the kids.  The first movie worked because the kid cast as Isaac was the right blend of menacing and creepy.  The one in this new version failed because its Isaac was just a terrible actor.

The bottom line is that the movie's potential was limited in its effect to scare the audience.  To its credit, the original ""Children of the Corn"" had a degree of credibility to it in that it allows the viewer to suspend his/her disbelief for a time, there is some atmosphere, some suspense and had that 80s horror movie feel to it.  All and all, it was an entertaining horror movie, albeit not a very scary one.This remake of ""Children of the Corn"", on the other hand, is sheer rubbish with no credibility whatsoever.  There is nothing even remotely scary about this movie.  The acting is atrocious, there is no atmosphere to it, the action seems forced and, in a word, the movie is just plain lame.  The sad part about it is that the creators of this flick took this movie seriously, but to horror enthusiasts like myself, this movie is a total joke.

The story line between the two movies remains pretty much the same; Vietnam vet Burt and his princess wife Vicki are headed to California for a second honeymoon.  After driving for many miles on I-80, Burt decides to pull off the interstate and continue on some back roads.  Their journey soon leads them to Gatlin, Nebraska.  While driving, the couple finds it very strange that there are no other cars or people around.  In the midst of arguing with Vicki, a small boy runs into the road and is struck by Burt.Unsure of what to do next, they place the boy's body in the trunk of their car and head off to find the police.  However, there's no one in Gatlin: except for the children.  The children are lead by child preacher Issac and his teen enforcer Malachai.  Isaac has brainwashed the children into believing they are to follow the one known as He Who Walks Behind the Rows.  All of the adults in the town have been killed, and now Burt and Vicki have become their next targets of sacrifice.  Will Vicki and Burt make it out alive, or will the children succeed in making them human sacrifices?This movie isn't very scary at all.  There is very little suspense, and most of what the viewer gets is scene after scene of Burt and Vicki arguing with each other.

As portayed by actress Kandyse McClure, ""Vicki"" is the wife from hell.  For the first thirty minutes, we're treated to her screeching, cursing, degrading her long suffering husband, David Anders, a recent Vietnam vet. The wife jeers and insults him in a non-stop barrage that never ends.  When the husband runs over a corn child, the wife turns up the insults and one wonders what the husband sees in her--and why he takes it.When the wife is finally murdered, you want to applaud.And the rest of the movie is just one endless marathon were the husband runs through cornfields. His pursuers are so fat, you can imagine them ordering wash tubs of corn dogs during breaks.  Oh, yeah, we're also supposed to be scared of a little boy whose supposed to be the leader--yet, he comes off as a brat who needs his diapers changed real fast.And then we have a bizarre sex scene where a teenage couple strip naked before all the other oorn children have sex--with the little ones all grinning and jumping up and down and leering at each other. You can imagine the director screaming: ""Act like you love it! Act like dirty little kids!""As for the corn monster, there isn't one.

I'd rather be bludgeoned unconscious with dried ears of corn than watch this film again.  (I live in Iowa, so this is an option!)  I had a few unintentional laughs, especially during the child killing spree the main protagonist went on during his escape attempt.  This film definitely has the highest body count of children killed in any horror film I've seen.  Between that and the ""sex scene"" in the film, I'm still shivering.  But anyway...  I digress.""Children of the Corn,"" in case you actually are living in a cornfield, is a remake of a prior film of the same name, both of which are based on a Steven King story.  (I can still remember one of the creepy lines from the original film, although I haven't seen it in years: ""He wants you too, Malachi. He wants you, too."") The plot is quite interesting for a horror film: it's set in a small Nebraska town and revolves around a religious cult composed of children that worship a being that lives in the corn fields.  A husband and wife encounter the kids, and the events that follow make up the rest of the story.  I'll not go into it in more detail, as other reviews have done it in already.Unlike a lot of people, I don't mind so much that Hollywood is hell-bent on making endless remakes, but I wish they would at least make a better remake.  This film is in no way better than its predecessor.  The acting is atrocious - not that they were given very good dialogue.  The lines were forced, and the actors are stiff and unbelievable.  The special effects are laughable and, if you can believe it, worse than the 1984 film.  So much for progress.  I think that I read that the SyFy (formerly known as Sci-fi) channel backed the making of this film or something to that effect.  I've gotten to the point where if I see Sci-fi channel on a DVD, I run.... I turn around and flee for my life. This movie should have been no different, but I only found this out post-viewing.  If the idea of this film is interesting to you, by all means, go watch the original film.  It's far superior.

1274618,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B002KH4KSY,Julian Kennedy,"[29, 36]","Children of the Corn (2009): 1 out of 10: Good lord did they screw this movie up. First, the writer (George Goldsmith) who adapted the original Children of the Corn is some sort of savant. Apparently all the good scenes in the original movie (The killing of the adults, Isaac and Malachi going at it in the climax, were his invention.) This movie cut all that good stuff out and replaced it with the Viet Cong and public child sex.The blame rests squarely on Mr. Stephen King's shoulders. He did not like the changes the 1984 and wanted to stick to his original story. Therefore, the movie takes place in the mid-seventies and the main couple is a divorcing, squabbling mess. In addition, the main character hallucinates Viet Cong shooting in the corn which looks ten times worse than it sounds. Oh they have a sex scene in a church 'The time for fertilization has come!' where two teens have sex while nine year olds look on masturbating corn cobs.... good lord I didn't need to see that.The casting is horrible. If I never see Kandyse McClure again (in the Linda Hamilton role) it will be to soon. She ruins the first half of an already horrible film. Daniel Newman as Malachi and Preston Bailey as Isaac ruin the second half. Daniel looks like he is reading off cue cards while Preston is about as threatening as a kitten.Oh and if that all was not a big enough F You to the audience, the monster never shows up at the end.It isn't like the original Children of the Corn was Casablanca or something but good lord this is an embarrassment for all involved.",1,Children of the Corn (2009)....

1274627,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002KH4KSY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","Children of the Corn (Donald P. Borchers, 2009)Fritz Kiersch first adapted Stephen King's chilling story ""Children of the Corn"" for the big screen in 1984. It, and its many, many sequels, have become staples on the Syfy Channel (and its recent spinoff Chiller) in the intervening years. By now, the original is a certified cult hit, despite the fact that as a movie, it really kinda blows. (Okay, remove the ""kinda""; the only big-screen King adaptation that's sillier is ""Graveyard Shift"", and that's at least so over-the-top stupid it deserves some recognition.) So when Don Borchers, who wrote the screenplay for the underrated Grace Jones vampire flick Vamp, and King himself set out to make a new adaptation, they didn't have to raise the bar too high to make it better. Aside from a few screens, they did an admirable job.I don't know how it escaped me in all the years since I first read the short story (which happened, I think, in 1978) that ""Children of the Corn"" is a Vietnam War allegory. (You know, cornrows, thick foliage, jungle...) It makes sense, though, and Borchers and King bring that out a lot more in this adaptation. They also make a couple of other changes, some of which work, and some don't. In case you've never read the story (and by all means, you should do so at your earliest convenience), the plot: Vietnam vet Burt Stanton (Into the Blue 2's David Anders) and wife Vicki (Battlestar Galactica's Kandyse McClure) are on what's supposed to be a second honeymoon. Only it looks a lot more like it's going to wind up in divorce. Burt, sick of highway driving, got off the Interstate in Nebraska and decided to travel on back roads for a while. At one point during their bickering, a kid with his throat cut stumbles out onto the road, and Burt sees him too late. He decides he's going to drive to the nearest town and report the accident. Unfortunately, the nearest town is Gatlin, where, we learn in the opening scene (one of the big points against the movie; the best part of the story is finding all this out as we go along), a crazy kid had, twelve years earlier, incited the rest of the town's children to kill everyone over the age of nineteen, claiming God was speaking through him in the guise of something called He Who Walks Behind the Rows. (It's a bit more obvious in this movie, as well, who He Who Walks Behind the Rows really is... in case you didn't get the memo.) Since then, everyone is killed upon reaching their ""Day of Favor"" (nineteenth birthday), to keep up the sacrifices, keep the rain coming, etc., etc. Think of it as The Wicker Man, peewee-style. And needless to say, Burt and Vicki are over nineteen.There are all sorts of interesting, somewhat perverse quirks in this flick. Sometimes when King goes back and revises his old stories for film, the result is just horrendous (look at the ""new ending"" for The Mist, for example), but most of what's here works just fine. The connotations of Vicki being black (the film, by the way, stays true to King's original mid-seventies setting--though I swear the story was set in 1978, while this version of the film is set in 1975) have been hotly debated on the IMDB message boards since the film originally aired, and I don't really have anything to add that hasn't already been said save that this is the kind of change I expect screenwriters to overplay, and it's not done here. Similarly, Burt's Vietnam War background is integrated nicely, especially in the flashback scenes, which feel less derivative than they do iconic (one in particular will strike you as very familiar, and it works here). The one change that doesn't work I can't tell you about, because it would spoil the film's biggest Big Reveal. But man, I can't believe they spent so much of their special effects budget on it. (You'll know it when you see it.)On the other hand, what doesn't work in this movie, by and large, is the acting (or lack of same). Burt and Vicki are both played by capable actors (though McClure finds herself with a Judith O'Dea/Naomi Watts-style role, where most of the time she just has to scream), and Malachai, the town enforcer (Broken Bridges' Daniel Newman), has some acting chops. All the child actors, though, seem to have been chosen from headshots rather than acting ability. Most of those are small parts, so it's not a huge problem. Isaac the crazy preacher-kid is played by Dexter's Preston Bailey. You'd think someone who's been around for a couple of seasons of one of TV's highest-rated shows would have had some enunciation classes by now (and in many ways, Isaac is the film's actual main character). The other relatively large speaking role is that of Nahum, played by Paul Butler (of My Sister's Keeper); cute as a button, but not ready for speaking roles at this point in his career.Still, acting problems and dumb special effects aside, this towers over the 1984 adaptation. Which doesn't make it a good movie by any means, but if you're sitting around with nothing to do on a Saturday night and you choice is between this and, say, Spring Break Shark Attack, you should definitely go for this one. ** ",2,Corn...y.

1274631,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B002KH4KSY,Sid the Elf,"[3, 3]","In 1984 Stephen King gave the world a reason to fear the children of Nebraska by writing Children of the Corn. Usually kids run around causing minor mischief pissing off a few parents here or there. However these kiddies are a bit different. Instead of the normal path, they form a murderous cult taking out every adult in sight. This is a concept that no doubt would reduce Santa to jif causing him to then swing his FTL's around over his head in a clear plastic bag. Since it has a good cult following the Sci-fi channel thought it must be a good idea to do a remake. Usually the remake idea never follows through well as was the case with Children of the Corn.In this version we have a couple, with their marriage on the rocks, taking a little road trip. As they cruise through the cornfields of Nebraska they plow down a kid who runs across the road. Obviously not helping the marriage counseling process. Now they're freaking out and notice the kid's throat was slit and decided to get all Tommy Boy on him by throwing him in their trunk. As they come to the next town they soon find a pack of little punk kids of supernatural sorts and are forced into battle. After about a half hour into the film it really starts to go downhill. The main characters acting gets way to corny as he challenges the kids using his military experience. It's quite hilarious to watch this guy get chased down by some kids as young as 7, not all being male.So in conclusion, the remake had nowhere near the effect the original had. There were some legit moments of enjoyment and even a couple laughs along the way. Unfortunately there wasn't enough to keep you interested. Even from a strictly B standpoint it couldn't work. Now we don't want to be too critical so have to  give some credit being that it was a sci-fi channel picture that was a cut above most. Compared to their usual disasters like Grizzly Rage or Mega Snake this one ranks high on their list. As far as a recommendation we can only say feel free to check it out when it's on t.v, but please don't spend $20 some odd dollars.

1274632,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B002KH4KSY,Stuart Conover,"[1, 1]","The film itself was directed by Donald P. Borchers who also ended up taking Stephen King's original short story to adapt into the screenplay that produced this wreck of a film. Children of the Corn is Borcher's third time behind the director's chair but from his first time having worked with horror as he has worked as both crew and producer on a large amount of horror films in the past including a few movies you may have heard of (and loved or hated) such as Leprechaun 2, Highlander 2, The Fog, and a personal favorite of mine - The Howling. Did I mention he was also one of the producers on the original 1984 release?The 2009 release of the classic Stephen King's Children of the Corn should have taken a few queues of the 1984 release that had come before it. This movie trumps almost every other re-make that had come out in 2009 in teaching the lesson of what not to do while re-making a classic horror film. I'm actually shocked it came out as bad as it did with how easy of a concept the film actually has but it seemed that everything they could do to make it wrong was what they went with for the story. With Borchers past experience in the horror genre I really have to question how this film turned out as it did. Even the actors felt underused as the film went out.We open the film with Burton Stanton (an actor you will easily recognize from a slew of television shows) and his wife Vicki (Kandyse McClure of Battlestar Galactica fame) are driving across country and it's this initial scene that blows the movie as Vicki is really just more cruel than necessary and doesn't seem to play the part right. The problem is after Battlestar you know Kandyse has the acting chops she just doesn't seem to come off as believable hateful as she is supposed to be in this film. When the couple finally hit a child in the car and have to find a town they come across a nearly deserted city and find it full of only children with Issac (Preston Bailey who ends up playing Cody on Dexter and Nicholas in the 2010 remake of The Crazies) in charge.For those that don't know the basis of the plot, the children have taken over the city killing all of the adults and using them as sacrifices to a creature that lives in the cornfield whom they worship as a God. The big bonus of being able to see what is ruling these children's lives never happens as there is no payoff that shows what it is and the ending felt both rushed and unnatural with how Burton falls into having flashbacks that overlay the horror he is experiencing.ScyFy has put together some impressive re-makes in the past. Their production value on the Dune (yes I know not horror) miniseries comes to mind. However I will quickly admit that all I am doing right now is looking forward to the Dimension Films re-make that will be coming out in the near future to wipe this abomination out of my memory. With being involved in the original release of this film I don't quite know how Borchers was able to steer this in such a wrong",2,"The original should be remade, but not like this",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2995,"['film', 'was', 'directed', 'Donald', 'P.', 'Borchers', 'who', 'also', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'Stephen', 'King', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'adapt', 'screenplay', 'produced', 'wreck', 'film', 'Children', 'Corn', 'Borcher', 'third', 'time', 'director', 'chair', 'first', 'time', 'having', 'worked', 'horror', 'worked', 'crew', 'producer', 'large', 'amount', 'horror', 'films', 'past', 'including', 'few', 'movies', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'loved', 'hated', 'such', 'Leprechaun', '2', 'Highlander', '2', 'Fog', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Howling', 'Did', 'mention', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'producers', 'original', '1984', 'release', '2009', 'release', 'classic', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Children', 'Corn', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'few', 'queues', '1984', 'release', 'had', 'come', 'movie', 'almost', 'other', 're-make', 'had', 'come', 'out', '2009', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'what', 'not', 'do', 're-making', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', ""'m"", 'actually', 'shocked', 'came', 'out', 'as', 'bad', 'did', 'how', 'easy', 'concept', 'film', 'actually', 'seemed', 'everything', 'could', 'do', 'make', 'wrong', 'was', 'what', 'went', 'story', 'Borchers', 'past', 'experience', 'horror', 'genre', 'really', 'have', 'question', 'how', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'did', 'Even', 'actors', 'felt', 'underused', 'film', 'went', 'out.We', 'open', 'film', 'Burton', 'Stanton', 'actor', 'will', 'easily', 'recognize', 'slew', 'television', 'shows', 'wife', 'Vicki', 'Kandyse', 'McClure', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'fame', 'are', 'driving', 'country', 'initial', 'scene', 'movie', 'Vicki', 'really', 'just', 'more', 'cruel', 'necessary', ""n't"", 'seem', 'play', 'part', 'right', 'problem', 'Battlestar', 'know', 'Kandyse', 'acting', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'off', 'believable', 'hateful', 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'When', 'couple', 'finally', 'hit', 'child', 'car', 'have', 'find', 'town', 'come', 'nearly', 'deserted', 'city', 'find', 'full', 'only', 'children', 'Issac', 'Preston', 'Bailey', 'who', 'up', 'playing', 'Cody', 'Dexter', 'Nicholas', '2010', 'remake', 'Crazies', 'charge.For', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'basis', 'plot', 'children', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'city', 'killing', 'adults', 'using', 'sacrifices', 'creature', 'cornfield', 'whom', 'worship', 'God', 'big', 'bonus', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'what', 'ruling', 'children', 'lives', 'never', 'payoff', 'what', 'ending', 'felt', 'rushed', 'unnatural', 'how', 'Burton', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'overlay', 'horror', 'experiencing.ScyFy', 'put', 'together', 'impressive', 're-makes', 'past', 'production', 'value', 'Dune', 'yes', 'know', 'not', 'horror', 'miniseries', 'mind', 'However', 'will', 'quickly', 'admit', 'am', 'doing', 'right', 'now', 'looking', 'forward', 'Dimension', 'Films', 're-make', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'near', 'future', 'wipe', 'abomination', 'memory', 'being', 'involved', 'original', 'release', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'Borchers', 'was', 'able', 'steer', 'such', 'wrong']",N/A

Imagine a story, from the King of Horror, filmed the way it should have been the first time?If you can, then you have the NEW Children of the Corn, refilmed and rewritten by Donald P Borchers (based on the King short story).  If you liked the original, then you will be shocked by this version.  Firstly, this is horror/suspense the way it should be done.  The horror/suspense is aided by the big question, what the hell is going on in Gatlin, Nebraska?  Secondly, where are all of the people?  Why does it seem that time has stood still?Burt and Vicki, an unhappily married couple about to seek divorce, travel through Nebraska just because.  A lonely stretch of road puts them corn country, and in the path of an escaping little boy.  Striking him with his Thunderbird, they look for a place to report the crime, and discover the deserted town of Gatlin.  The year is 1975 and Burt, a Viet Nam vet is still suffering from Post Traumatic Stress  Syndrome.  His wife, a preachers daughter, doesn't understand, and their marital tension builds just as the mystery before them escalated into a fight for their lives.  The children, led by a pre-teen preacher, Isaac and Malachai (his brother), control a large group of children who have lived 12 years without adults.  He who walks in the Corn, rules with fear, yet the fanatical, cult grip on the children in undeniable. As Borchers says in his special feature, one of the points he wanted to make that as mature individuals (and a society), we must not follow blindly, but rather be able to ask questions and seek wise guidance.  The youth, in this film, were the adults in the first film.  Placing youths in the main roles  creates another moral focal point that is accentuated as those above the age of 18 are sacrificed horrifically (denying their `mature' influence upon the youth), to personify `And a child shall lead them'.  That aside, as Vicki and Burt seek answers, the brutality of the children is obvious.  Stuck in an old testament mind set, sacrifice is the only solution.  Without it, there can be no absolution.  The outlanders, as Isaac puts it, are to be sacrificed so the Children of the Corn can become pure once more as those above 18 are purged one more time.This is one frightening film.  The cinematography is outstanding.  The stark, empty town conveys and magnifies the blood lust while providing an atmospheric setting for the pursuit of the outlanders.  The cornfields serve to focus our attention on the conflict, and symbolize the conflict itself.  Where have all the parents gone????  The adults not only fertilized the object of their cult, yet also created it with their own `sinful' behaviours.  The `cross' has become a perverted corn decorated, symbol of evil and religious misunderstanding.  Where grace should be, blood sacrifice (Old Testament), rules supreme and no-one is safe.  The big question here is simple, how real is your faith?  What is it based on?Whatever you come away with, you will never think of corn the same way again.There is violence.  There is blood.  There is religious symbolism.  There is no redemption in Gatlin, Nebraska today.Tim Lasiuta",5,Frightening,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,3289,"['Imagine', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'back', 're-shoot', 'what', 'regarded', 'Classic', 'film', 'way', 'YOU', 'wanted', 'first', 'time', 'were', 'afraid', 'to..', 'Imagine', 'story', 'King', 'Horror', 'filmed', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'then', 'have', 'NEW', 'Children', 'Corn', 'refilmed', 'rewritten', 'Donald', 'P', 'Borchers', 'based', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'liked', 'original', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'version', 'Firstly', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'horror/suspense', 'aided', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'Secondly', 'where', 'are', 'people', 'Why', 'seem', 'time', 'stood', 'still', 'Burt', 'Vicki', 'unhappily', 'married', 'couple', 'seek', 'divorce', 'travel', 'Nebraska', 'just', 'because', 'A', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'road', 'corn', 'country', 'path', 'escaping', 'little', 'boy', 'Striking', 'Thunderbird', 'look', 'place', 'report', 'crime', 'discover', 'deserted', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'year', '1975', 'Burt', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'vet', 'still', 'suffering', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'wife', 'preachers', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'understand', 'marital', 'tension', 'just', 'mystery', 'escalated', 'fight', 'lives', 'children', 'led', 'pre-teen', 'preacher', 'Isaac', 'Malachai', 'brother', 'control', 'large', 'group', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'lived', '12', 'years', 'adults', 'who', 'Corn', 'rules', 'fear', 'fanatical', 'cult', 'grip', 'children', 'undeniable', 'Borchers', 'special', 'feature', 'one', 'points', 'wanted', 'make', 'mature', 'individuals', 'society', 'must', 'not', 'follow', 'blindly', 'rather', 'be', 'able', 'ask', 'questions', 'seek', 'wise', 'guidance', 'youth', 'film', 'were', 'adults', 'first', 'film', 'Placing', 'youths', 'main', 'roles', 'moral', 'focal', 'point', 'accentuated', 'age', '18', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'horrifically', 'denying', 'mature', 'influence', 'youth', 'personify', 'child', 'shall', 'lead', 'aside', 'Vicki', 'Burt', 'seek', 'answers', 'brutality', 'children', 'obvious', 'Stuck', 'old', 'testament', 'mind', 'set', 'sacrifice', 'only', 'solution', 'can', 'be', 'absolution', 'outlanders', 'Isaac', 'are', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'Children', 'Corn', 'can', 'become', 'pure', 'once', 'more', '18', 'are', 'purged', 'one', 'more', 'time.This', 'one', 'frightening', 'film', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'stark', 'empty', 'town', 'conveys', 'blood', 'lust', 'providing', 'atmospheric', 'setting', 'pursuit', 'outlanders', 'cornfields', 'serve', 'focus', 'attention', 'conflict', 'symbolize', 'conflict', 'Where', 'have', 'parents', 'gone', 'adults', 'not', 'only', 'fertilized', 'object', 'cult', 'yet', 'also', 'created', 'own', 'sinful', 'behaviours', 'cross', 'become', 'perverted', 'corn', 'decorated', 'symbol', 'evil', 'religious', 'misunderstanding', 'Where', 'grace', 'should', 'be', 'blood', 'sacrifice', 'Old', 'Testament', 'rules', 'supreme', 'no-one', 'safe', 'big', 'question', 'here', 'simple', 'how', 'real', 'faith', 'What', 'based', 'come', 'away', 'will', 'never', 'think', 'corn', 'same', 'way', 'violence', 'blood', 'religious', 'symbolism', 'redemption', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'today.Tim', 'Lasiuta']",N/A

We aren't given any background information, characters are missing, and Isaac is so little and cute, that he isn't believable. On top of that, instead of a loving middle aged couple, we get a fighting interracial couple, in 1975, that features a Marine with PTSD and a prom queen who won't shut up! I'm glad it was a little creepier and bloodier than the original, but they cut out some of the best parts and give absolutely no background information.

Re-makes can be good, as I've often said-and they shouldn't follow the original scene for scene anyway, when they do for me it ruins the story both ways, predictability isn't always a problem for me, but with re-makes, changing the story can make it more interesting-what RZ did with Halloween/Michael Myers was brilliant, same with Jason Vorhees.",4,"too much complaining, not enough praise.... on remakes in general",1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1252,"['Having', 'read', 'several', 'reviews', 'remake', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'like', 'versions', 'merits-some', 'parts', 'are', 'comparable', 'others', 'are', 'not.The', 'acting', 'least', 'decent-although', 'Issac', 'one', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'preacher', 'original', 'alot', 'creepier.As', 'Vicky-I', 'Linda', 'portrayal', 'better', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'need', 'remember', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'bets', 'are', 'sometimes', 'understand', 'why', 'acted', 'way', 'did', 'admittedly', 'like', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'better', 'too.The', 'music', 'versions', 'good', 'special', 'f/x', 'are', 'good', 'more', 'differences', 'comparisons', 'ending', 'more', 'fitting', 'SK', 'movie', 'time-the', 'evil', 'stopped', 'not', 'destroyed', 'not', 'mention', 'price', 'terrible', 'one', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short-both', 'versions', 'are', 'good', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'liberal', 'own', 'good', 'Re-makes', 'can', 'be', 'good', ""'ve"", 'often', 'said-and', 'should', ""n't"", 'follow', 'original', 'scene', 'scene', 'anyway', 'when', 'do', 'story', 'ways', 'predictability', ""n't"", 'always', 'problem', 're-makes', 'changing', 'story', 'can', 'make', 'more', 'interesting-what', 'RZ', 'did', 'Halloween/Michael', 'Myers', 'was', 'brilliant', 'same', 'Jason', 'Vorhees']",N/A

1274638,A34HYQ9BQZPE78,B002KH4KSY,William Dorfer,"[0, 0]","This is the first film I've ever given a one-star rating on here. I always try to find some good in a movie, some redeeming quality that makes me like it, but it felt like no matter what happened in this movie, it just made me angrier and more bored.Let me break it down for you like this: Burt and Vicky, in this film, are a married couple on the brink of utter marital destruction; the character Vicky is the most insufferable shrew one could imagine. Whereas Linda Hamilton's character in the 1984 original was playful, friendly and much more easily able to relate to, this Vicky spends the first 40-45 minutes doing nothing but yelling at her husband, blaming him and insulting him when he didn't even cause a need for her to be upset. Burt is honestly the only character I can relate to in the movie; he's good-natured, patient, strong-willed and is still able to emote like a regular human being (as opposed to his wife who basically does nothing but spew animosity throughout). This isn't a Children of the Corn remake!!! This is ""How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days: Hee-Haw Edition""!!!The evil children in this movie are also very poorly done, especially in comparison to those of the original. The kids in this film aren't very bright and don't do a half-convincing job that they're evil; honestly I just felt like the little suckers needed a good spanking to set them straight. Also, I'm aware that one isn't supposed to like the villain in a horror film, but even as the bad guys, I just wanted to go up to the children and say ""I don't like you."" That's right, even the villains in this horror film aren't on par with a decently-done villain role. The character of Isaac was just an annoying little shrimp, whereas in the original he was twisted and menacing, and FAR more believable. This film's Malachai also has nowhere near as much finesse as Courtney Gains in the original movie; Malachai here just kinda has no personality and is pretty forgettable as far as being the bad guy that does the dirty work.What really bothers me about the film, though, is that despite how insufferable the first 45 minutes or so were, halfway through, this movie has the utter nerve to pick up the pace. I wasn't expecting the film to be very exciting, but about 50 minutes in the kids start to attack, Burt fights back in an attempt to rescue Vicky, and all the creepy cult material kicks into play. It's bad enough that half the film wastes our time on pointless bickering, but to turn itself into an almost-decent excuse for a low-budget made-for-television remake of a horror classic just bothered me. It's the equivalence of hearing a musical artist you don't like do a legitimately good cover of a song you do like.All in all, this was one of the poorest horror movie remakes I've ever seen. The ONLY reason I would suggest that anyone watch it is they, like me, want to complete the Children of the Corn film series. Otherwise, stay FAR away from this garbage. This is just one of those films that shouldn't have been made. In all honesty though, I do think there are some remakes of the 2000's that are legitimately good, such as The Last House on the Left, Maniac and Mother's Day, so give those films a chance before you subject yourself to the torture that is this movie.
