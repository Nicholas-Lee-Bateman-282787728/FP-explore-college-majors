1245479,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B001XWH65G,K. Ostrowski,"[1, 6]","At the end of this film, we're told that the movie was made by a group of over fourty students, and I have no real difficulty believing that.  The film's subject matter is somewhat likable, but its cinematography is imperfect in a number of ways.For one thing, the film could have benefitted from about fifty percent more background music than it had.  Lack of any background music can work well in horror films, but in inspirational stories, it really helps to have it.Secondly, I'm afraid that the acting of the two young leads may turn people off at first, since neither of them are fantastic actors.  Not Keanu Reeves-type bad, but still not great.I also found it hard to sympathise with the girl on at least one level.  I don't see why her father should be the one making ethical decisions for her.  I understand why she made the choices she did, and I agree with her, in a sense, but at her age, the role of the parent should be more as an ethical advisor and confidant; not as ""the boss of me.""  I'm afraid that even if that wasn't intended, that was how it sort of came across.On the subject of its ethics, its understanding of law, and of religion, this film is spot-on, and I appreciate that.  There aren't enough modern movies willing to work that hard or think that much.  However, you also shouldn't watch this movie if you only care about happy endings, because this film is kind of a depression pill.In Spider-man 2 (one of the best mainstream movies in recent years, in my opinion) Peter Parker expresses his discontent over the fact that his Uncle Ben lost his life because he was the only person who did the right thing, but Spider-man also tries to comfort us over the loss experienced by all the people who try to do the right thing, and give us a little hope.  As its title might indicate, Come What May makes no such attempt.Still, there's a distinctiveness to that, and a sort of hard-hitting insistence in that approach, even though it excludes the film from ever becoming the feel good movie of ""x time of the year.""  This movie definitely didn't make me feel better.  In fact, it made me feel a lot worse.  Others have called it inspirational, and in an ethical sense, it most definitely is, but I'm also comparing it to better movies, made during better times, when the movie industry was a better thing.  Quality films like ""the Sound of Music,"" ""Newsies,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" made during times when the quest for shock value wasn't all that mattered.Maybe I shouldn't do that.  Maybe comparing this film to some of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time would be a mistake, but regardless, I feel that it would be just as wrong to give it the perfect grade.  This film has its heart in the right place, and it expresses that heart very well, but it's not perfect, and that's really all there is to it.",4,The message at the end comes as no surprise to me.,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,2847,"['end', 'film', ""'re"", 'told', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'group', 'fourty', 'students', 'have', 'real', 'difficulty', 'believing', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'somewhat', 'likable', 'cinematography', 'imperfect', 'number', 'ways.For', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'fifty', 'percent', 'more', 'background', 'music', 'had', 'Lack', 'background', 'music', 'can', 'work', 'well', 'horror', 'films', 'inspirational', 'stories', 'really', 'have', 'it.Secondly', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'acting', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'may', 'turn', 'people', 'off', 'first', 'are', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'Not', 'Keanu', 'Reeves-type', 'bad', 'still', 'not', 'great.I', 'also', 'found', 'hard', 'sympathise', 'girl', 'least', 'one', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'father', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'making', 'ethical', 'decisions', 'understand', 'why', 'made', 'choices', 'did', 'agree', 'sense', 'age', 'role', 'parent', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'ethical', 'advisor', 'confidant', 'not', 'boss', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'intended', 'was', 'how', 'sort', 'came', 'subject', 'ethics', 'understanding', 'law', 'religion', 'film', 'spot-on', 'appreciate', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'modern', 'movies', 'willing', 'work', 'hard', 'think', 'much', 'However', 'also', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'care', 'happy', 'endings', 'film', 'kind', 'depression', 'Spider-man', '2', 'one', 'best', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'opinion', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'discontent', 'fact', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'lost', 'life', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'Spider-man', 'also', 'comfort', 'loss', 'experienced', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'give', 'little', 'hope', 'title', 'might', 'indicate', 'Come', 'What', 'May', 'such', 'attempt.Still', 'distinctiveness', 'sort', 'hard-hitting', 'insistence', 'approach', 'even', 'film', 'ever', 'becoming', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'x', 'time', 'year', 'movie', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'fact', 'made', 'feel', 'lot', 'worse', 'Others', 'have', 'called', 'inspirational', 'ethical', 'sense', 'most', 'definitely', ""'m"", 'also', 'comparing', 'better', 'movies', 'made', 'better', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'industry', 'was', 'better', 'thing', 'Quality', 'films', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Newsies', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'made', 'times', 'when', 'quest', 'shock', 'value', 'was', ""n't"", 'mattered.Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'Maybe', 'comparing', 'film', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'masterpieces', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'regardless', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'wrong', 'give', 'perfect', 'grade', 'film', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'heart', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'perfect', 'really']",Come What May
