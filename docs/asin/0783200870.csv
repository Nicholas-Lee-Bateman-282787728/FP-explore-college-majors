44498,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,0783200870,Amy Lynn,"[12, 14]",This started out cheesy. Probably one of the lamest movies ive seen and not particularly in a 'good way'...though it had its moments. It seemed like one big excuse to see women naked and the acting was average at best. Its about some students at an all girls private school called Cherryvale Academy. Theres 2 girls that want the same guy whos also a student at a nearby Academy for Men. Also some kind of relationship between one of the girls and that guy. In between all this the guys start dressing up like women to get into the girls dorms to pull pranks on them.  As the movie went on it got a little bit better and there were some genuinely funny scenes in it 'like the car scene' but nothing spectacular. I also liked some parts of it and was able to relate to some of the things that went on and laughed to myself. I guess you could call this a 'sex or romantic comedy'. I call it that but also just an excuse to see hot girls naked. 2.5- 3,3,Private School,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,948,"['started', 'out', 'cheesy', 'Probably', 'one', 'lamest', 'movies', 'ive', 'seen', 'not', 'particularly', ""'good"", 'way', 'had', 'moments', 'seemed', 'one', 'big', 'excuse', 'see', 'women', 'naked', 'acting', 'was', 'average', 'best', 'students', 'girls', 'private', 'school', 'called', 'Cherryvale', 'Academy', '2', 'girls', 'want', 'same', 'guy', 'whos', 'also', 'student', 'nearby', 'Academy', 'Men', 'Also', 'kind', 'relationship', 'one', 'girls', 'guy', 'guys', 'start', 'dressing', 'up', 'women', 'get', 'girls', 'dorms', 'pull', 'pranks', 'movie', 'went', 'got', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'were', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'scenes', 'car', 'scene', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'also', 'liked', 'parts', 'was', 'able', 'relate', 'things', 'went', 'laughed', 'myself', 'guess', 'could', 'call', ""'sex"", 'romantic', 'comedy', 'call', 'also', 'just', 'excuse', 'see', 'hot', 'girls', 'naked', '2.5-', '3']",N/A

44503,A3PD0NM46NWGU6,0783200870,Carlos,"[49, 56]","I have fond memories of being a horny 13 year old and catching Private School on cable back in the mid-80's and it had always been a movie I longed to see have a DVD release. Well...that day has finally arrived and I'm here to tell you that I must have been dumb as a rock at 13 cuz Private School might be one of the worst pieces of drek to crawl out of the 80's teen sex comedy toilet you'll ever see...and it's wonderful. See, movies can sometimes be an entirely subjective thing if you have memories attatched to them. Viewing this film nearly 25 years later I was instantly transported back to my teenage years and I spent more time reminiscing about the 80's, my first crush, the kids I hung out with, etc. than paying attention to the flick. That's not a bad thing really. The script is atrocious, the actors are painfully unfunny (especially the guy who plays Bubba who I recall stinking up a lot of these teen movies) and the cheese-ometer gets cranked up a few notches when a song sung by Phoebe Cates plays over a montage that makes Baywatch look classy.Which brings me to Phoebe Cates...the sole reason this film even exists. Has there ever been another actress whose good looks radiate charisma when she herself is'nt really doing much of anything? Don't get me wrong she turned out to be a fine actress and her previous film ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" is about a zillion times better than Private School but truth is Phoebe Cates might have the most beautiful face ever committed to film (which may explain why the Phoebe-Cult continued to this day).And yet....it's Betsy Russelll who delivers the goods, who actually provides Private School with it's truly sexy moments. Just watch the scene where she tries to seduce Matthew Modine by flaunting her perfectly toned legs in his face and tell me that she might not be the queen seductress of all time.So if you've never seen this movie (and you're under 30) you'll probably wonder what all the fuss was about but if you remember 1983 and you remember waiting on line to play Pac-Man at the arcade, chances are you love this film for reasons good taste can't explain.",3,Truly awful film...so why the 3 stars?,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,2134,"['have', 'fond', 'memories', 'being', 'horny', '13', 'year', 'old', 'catching', 'Private', 'School', 'cable', 'back', 'mid-80', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'movie', 'longed', 'see', 'have', 'DVD', 'release', 'Well', 'day', 'finally', 'arrived', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'dumb', 'rock', '13', 'cuz', 'Private', 'School', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'pieces', 'drek', 'crawl', '80', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', 'toilet', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'wonderful', 'See', 'movies', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'entirely', 'subjective', 'thing', 'have', 'memories', 'attatched', 'Viewing', 'film', 'nearly', '25', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'instantly', 'transported', 'back', 'teenage', 'years', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'reminiscing', '80', 'first', 'crush', 'kids', 'hung', 'out', 'etc', 'paying', 'attention', 'flick', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'really', 'script', 'atrocious', 'actors', 'are', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'especially', 'guy', 'who', 'Bubba', 'who', 'recall', 'stinking', 'up', 'lot', 'teen', 'movies', 'cheese-ometer', 'cranked', 'up', 'few', 'notches', 'when', 'song', 'sung', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'montage', 'Baywatch', 'look', 'classy.Which', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'sole', 'reason', 'film', 'even', 'Has', 'ever', 'been', 'actress', 'good', 'looks', 'radiate', 'charisma', 'when', ""is'nt"", 'really', 'doing', 'much', 'anything', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fine', 'actress', 'previous', 'film', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'zillion', 'times', 'better', 'Private', 'School', 'truth', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'might', 'have', 'most', 'beautiful', 'face', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'Phoebe-Cult', 'continued', 'day', '.And', 'yet', '.it', 'Betsy', 'Russelll', 'who', 'goods', 'who', 'actually', 'Private', 'School', 'truly', 'sexy', 'moments', 'Just', 'watch', 'scene', 'where', 'seduce', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'flaunting', 'perfectly', 'toned', 'legs', 'face', 'tell', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'queen', 'seductress', 'time.So', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', ""'re"", '30', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'remember', '1983', 'remember', 'waiting', 'line', 'play', 'Pac-Man', 'arcade', 'chances', 'are', 'film', 'reasons', 'good', 'taste', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain']",N/A

However if you were a boy anywhere near puberty in the 1980s this was one of the movies you always hoped came on cable late at night when you got to stay up late.  The script and acting are atrocious.  Even though the movie had some young stars that would go on to be relatively good actors, they were not given much to work with, even by teen sex comedy standards.  There were also some whose careers never made it out of the 1980s.  It has about every 80s movie cliche you can imagine (right down to the cheesy music montage).  The two best things about the movie Betsy Russell, and having some relatively good songs on the soundtrack.  Phoebe Cates was the big star in the movie, coming off her role in Fast times.  And although she was the &#34;sexy one&#34; in that movie, she plays the rather bland &#34;good girl&#34; in this one.  She is of course still gorgeous, and did show a little bit toward the end of the movie, but Betsy Russell is the one who amps up the sex factor here.Ultimately you know what you get with this.  It is not great by any means.
