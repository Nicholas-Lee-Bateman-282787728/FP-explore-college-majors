935560,AQ2TLXCQVBI59,B000AYYVGA,M. MacBradaigh,"[0, 0]","I liked a lot of what Brad Stine has to say. I agree with the politics.But to be fair, it feels like - as the audience - you are being yelled at for the entire act.  His delivery is angry.  It's polished, he's obviously very comfortable, but at times I felt it was almost oppressive listening.Some of it is actually funny.  But it's not like say, Blue Collar Comedy, where you mostly just laugh your rear end off.I guess it depends on your cup of tea.  I thought it was going to be more light-hearted than it is.",3,"Has some good things to say, but delivery is less funny than serious, and delivery is rough",1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,512,"['liked', 'lot', 'what', 'Brad', 'Stine', 'say', 'agree', 'politics.But', 'be', 'fair', 'like', 'audience', 'are', 'being', 'yelled', 'entire', 'act', 'delivery', 'angry', 'polished', 'obviously', 'very', 'comfortable', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'almost', 'oppressive', 'listening.Some', 'actually', 'funny', 'not', 'like', 'say', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'where', 'mostly', 'just', 'rear', 'end', 'off.I', 'guess', 'cup', 'tea', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'light-hearted']",Brad Stine: Tolerate This!

It would be hard not to laugh a lot listening to this routine.Like all good comedians, Stine can take virtually any routine situation and turn it into a joke. The main difference is that he is able to get laughs without foul language, which is such a rarity these days. He is also very open about being Christian and conservative.He has very funny routines on various topics including the following:  applause, common courtesy, men and women, spiders, Jesus' brother, and many more.  I have all of Stine's CDs and would recommend this one as well as all of the others.  He is also great to see live.Highly recommended!",4,Hilarious Clean Humor,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,705,"['great', 'routine', 'Brad', 'Stine', 'comedy', 'good', 'food', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'not', 'laugh', 'lot', 'listening', 'routine.Like', 'good', 'comedians', 'Stine', 'can', 'take', 'virtually', 'routine', 'situation', 'turn', 'joke', 'main', 'difference', 'able', 'get', 'laughs', 'foul', 'language', 'rarity', 'days', 'also', 'very', 'open', 'being', 'Christian', 'conservative.He', 'very', 'funny', 'routines', 'various', 'topics', 'including', 'following', 'applause', 'common', 'courtesy', 'men', 'women', 'spiders', 'Jesus', 'brother', 'many', 'more', 'have', 'Stine', 'CDs', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'live.Highly', 'recommended']",Brad Stine: Tolerate This!
935562,A1BYGXZTXEX9DF,B000AYYVGA,"W. Smith ""Steampunk Enthusiast""","[26, 28]","Brad Stine has made a name for himself as a Christian Conservative Comedian.  He fills a niche in a market inundated with those of the oppositie political bent.This DVD, like the last one, Brad Stine: A Conservative Unleashed, is a live audience performance.  Brad has a nice rapport with his audience and his sense of timing and his clever selection of a wide array of content makes for a solid show.  There's something for everyone here, and its nice to see a comedy act that my 8 year-old could watch that is familiy-friendly.  I suppose if you are a liberal, you may not like some his politically-oriented comments, but if you enter with an open mind there's plenty of 'oh yeah everyone feels that way' moments.  Also, Brad's act is over an hour long- impressive!  Most comedians put in their 30 mins and you are revving up as an audience just as they suddenly shut down the show- not so with Stine.I am giving this DVD 4 stars, rather than 5, only because the previous Stine work, Brad Stine: A Conservative Unleashed, was, well...better.  In the prior outing Brad played to a smaller theater venue and the camera work was better able to display his act.  In Tolerate This! Brad is playing to a huge stadium-style audience and the impact of Brad's jokes is lessened(though still far superior to 90% of the comedy out there).If you are a Christian Conservative(about 50% of the country mind you) then this DVD is for you.  I would suggest that you first grab Brad Stine: A Conservative Unleashed because it is a better primer for what Brad is all about.  That being said, the two DVD's compliment each other nicely because Brad obviously took care in not using retread jokes from one show to the next. You can't have too much of a good thing.",4,Great Comedy-Compliments his Prior Installment,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,1746,"['Brad', 'Stine', 'made', 'name', 'Christian', 'Conservative', 'Comedian', 'niche', 'market', 'inundated', 'oppositie', 'political', 'bent.This', 'DVD', 'last', 'one', 'Brad', 'Stine', 'Conservative', 'Unleashed', 'live', 'audience', 'performance', 'Brad', 'nice', 'rapport', 'audience', 'sense', 'timing', 'clever', 'selection', 'wide', 'array', 'content', 'solid', 'show', 'something', 'everyone', 'here', 'nice', 'see', 'comedy', 'act', '8', 'year-old', 'could', 'watch', 'familiy-friendly', 'suppose', 'are', 'liberal', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'politically-oriented', 'comments', 'enter', 'open', 'mind', 'plenty', ""'oh"", 'yeah', 'everyone', 'feels', 'way', 'moments', 'Also', 'Brad', 'act', 'hour', 'long-', 'impressive', 'Most', 'comedians', 'put', '30', 'mins', 'are', 'revving', 'up', 'audience', 'just', 'suddenly', 'shut', 'down', 'show-', 'not', 'so', 'Stine.I', 'am', 'giving', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'rather', '5', 'only', 'previous', 'Stine', 'work', 'Brad', 'Stine', 'Conservative', 'Unleashed', 'was', 'well', 'better', 'prior', 'outing', 'Brad', 'played', 'smaller', 'theater', 'venue', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'better', 'able', 'display', 'act', 'Tolerate', 'Brad', 'playing', 'huge', 'stadium-style', 'audience', 'impact', 'Brad', 'jokes', 'lessened', 'still', 'far', 'superior', '90', '%', 'comedy', 'there', '.If', 'are', 'Christian', 'Conservative', '50', '%', 'country', 'then', 'DVD', 'would', 'suggest', 'first', 'grab', 'Brad', 'Stine', 'Conservative', 'Unleashed', 'better', 'primer', 'what', 'Brad', 'about', 'being', 'said', 'two', 'DVD', 'compliment', 'other', 'nicely', 'Brad', 'obviously', 'took', 'care', 'not', 'using', 'retread', 'jokes', 'one', 'show', 'next', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing']",Brad Stine: Tolerate This!
