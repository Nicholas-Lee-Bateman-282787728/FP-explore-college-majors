Of course, as soon as it was released, I HAD to own it.I LOVE this show!  It reminds me of Degrassi, as far as the issues it tackles, except it adds undercover cops to the mix.  It makes me wish I had been a teenager in the 80s...all those great hairstyles...Anyway, I really enjoy it.  It's educational, yet entertaining.  Each story is very realistic, and I think it's important for younger people to watch.  Johnny Depp (as Hanson) is just downright adorable, and Peter DeLuise (as Penhall)is really hilarious!  It gets even better when Captain Fuller joins the crew.  ""Don't Pet the Teacher"" is my favorite episode...(Hanson falls for his teacher).  Any fan of the 80s, Johnny Depp, Peter DeLuise, undercover cops, crime-fighting/solving, or tight jeans :) will enjoy this TV show.Alright, now...as far as the music goes: BOO HOO, people!!!  I know that I can't really relate to the people who are complaining about the music being changed (since I never saw the original show when it first came out), but seriously, what is the big deal?

I remember as a young boy gleefully watching almost ever one of these episodes on the Fox network.  This show and the Simpsons made me fall in love with the Fox network, at the time, the joke of the network community.  21 Jump Street's actors are all still around today, a testament to how well the acting was.  The mature material made me feel like I was watching an important show, rather than mindless dribble.  Few are more dissapointed with the problems with this DVD than I.Unfortunately, the music has been changed due to licensing roadblocks.  As far as I am concerned, this is a dealbreaker plain and simple.  Then there is the talk of the pilot being the wrong one.  Why?  It makes you realize that whoever was in charge of this DVD release at Anchor Bay wasn't a true 21 Jump Street Fan.  Too bad.The rumors are going around that Miami Vice has succumbed to the same music licensing problems, another dealbreaker.I'm so glad we can all report the truth about these DVD screw ups here at Amazon.com.  I'd give it zero stars if I could, as we are not getting the original material.

832578,A1SUKL95MDNVQS,B0002F6B2E,D. Reyes,"[26, 27]","21 Jump Street launched two careers: one, most notably that of Johnny Depp and the other would be that of the young upstart TV network called Fox. It premiered in 1987 and was, in a way, a 1980's version of the mod squad. But it was original in storylines and ahead of its time in storylines as well. The storylines were dark and gritty as was the subject matter that fueld the episodes back then. There were topical issues touched upon on this series such as AIDS, death, rape, even incest and abuse. But despite those subject matters the series had many great comical aspects to it as well due to the fact that the cast through seasons 1-4 had great chemistry. Two people on the series that had the best chemistry were probably Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise and that shown through when their characters ""Hanson"" and ""Penhall"" donned the alias' of ""The McQuaid Brothers"" in episodes where their characters had to go undercover in high schools.The series ran strong for 4 seasons as a first run show, but during his last season (season 4) it was well known that Johnny Depp wanted out of his contract to move on to bigger and better things, and he also disliked the concept of cops going undercover in high schools and had some sort of moral objections. Season 5 is easily forgettable as Johnny Depp and Dustin Nguyen had left the show and the ratings dropped drastically so the show was put into syndication. So that was pretty much the death of the show as it became a shell of its former self.Another thing about this series, though it was a show about young officers that looked young and were able to go undercover in high schools, in actuality a lot of the episodes didn't even revolve around that type of scenerio. As the series progressed and characters had developed personalities a lot of episodes revolved around their own struggles on the show most notably the episode about the death of Johnny Depp's character's girlfriend and his character's struggles with the death, and also Peter Deluise's character's struggles in the later seasons involving his wife in El Salvador.It's great to see this series finally be put out on DVD and despite being a show from the late 80's the only thing dated about the show would just be the fashion of the time. The episodes and topic matter still hold up I believe. One other thing about the show was it's choice of great late 80's music, as REM and U2 songs were featured in episodes along with a handful of other songs from hit bands of the time, hopefully the songs featured in episodes will be kept on the DVDs as they are released. One also has to wonder if season 5 will even be released.. Time will tell. And though shows like Married with Children and The Simpsons helped Fox become a major player, this show did help a lot as well by drawing in a young teenage demographic and helped shape Fox into a ""hip"" and ""edgy"" network.",5,Jump!,1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,2884,"['21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'launched', 'two', 'careers', 'one', 'most', 'notably', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'young', 'upstart', 'TV', 'network', 'called', 'Fox', 'premiered', '1987', 'was', 'way', '1980', 'version', 'mod', 'squad', 'was', 'original', 'storylines', 'ahead', 'time', 'storylines', 'as', 'well', 'storylines', 'were', 'dark', 'gritty', 'was', 'subject', 'matter', 'fueld', 'episodes', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'topical', 'issues', 'touched', 'series', 'such', 'AIDS', 'death', 'rape', 'even', 'incest', 'abuse', 'subject', 'matters', 'series', 'had', 'many', 'great', 'comical', 'aspects', 'as', 'well', 'due', 'fact', 'cast', 'seasons', '1-4', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Two', 'people', 'series', 'had', 'best', 'chemistry', 'were', 'probably', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Peter', 'DeLuise', 'shown', 'when', 'characters', 'Hanson', 'Penhall', 'donned', 'alias', 'McQuaid', 'Brothers', 'episodes', 'where', 'characters', 'had', 'go', 'undercover', 'high', 'schools.The', 'series', 'ran', 'strong', '4', 'seasons', 'first', 'run', 'show', 'last', 'season', 'season', '4', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'wanted', 'contract', 'move', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'also', 'disliked', 'concept', 'cops', 'going', 'undercover', 'high', 'schools', 'had', 'sort', 'moral', 'objections', 'Season', '5', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dustin', 'Nguyen', 'had', 'left', 'show', 'ratings', 'dropped', 'drastically', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'syndication', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'death', 'show', 'became', 'shell', 'former', 'self.Another', 'thing', 'series', 'was', 'show', 'young', 'officers', 'looked', 'young', 'were', 'able', 'go', 'undercover', 'high', 'schools', 'actuality', 'lot', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'revolve', 'around', 'type', 'scenerio', 'series', 'progressed', 'characters', 'had', 'developed', 'personalities', 'lot', 'episodes', 'revolved', 'own', 'struggles', 'show', 'most', 'notably', 'episode', 'death', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'character', 'struggles', 'death', 'also', 'Peter', 'Deluise', 'character', 'struggles', 'later', 'seasons', 'involving', 'wife', 'El', 'Salvador.It', 'great', 'see', 'series', 'finally', 'be', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'being', 'show', 'late', '80', 'only', 'thing', 'dated', 'show', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'fashion', 'time', 'episodes', 'topic', 'matter', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'believe', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'show', 'was', 'choice', 'great', 'late', '80', 'music', 'REM', 'U2', 'songs', 'were', 'featured', 'episodes', 'handful', 'other', 'songs', 'hit', 'bands', 'time', 'hopefully', 'songs', 'featured', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'DVDs', 'are', 'released', 'One', 'also', 'wonder', 'season', '5', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'released..', 'Time', 'will', 'tell', 'shows', 'Married', 'Children', 'Simpsons', 'helped', 'Fox', 'become', 'major', 'player', 'show', 'did', 'help', 'lot', 'well', 'drawing', 'young', 'teenage', 'demographic', 'helped', 'shape', 'Fox', 'hip', 'edgy', 'network']",N/A

But seeing the series also reminded me of the talents of the other actors, and how cool all the undercover cops were ... and how positively outrageous hairstyles were back then.Way back when, the series was the first of its kind to address the problems teenagers face at home and at school. To my mind, it started a whole host of important research into the teen's brain which it has been shown is completely different from that of a child or an adult. It is no wonder, then, that high school is the place for experimenting and a real hub of what may seem like incomprehensible behaviours and attitudes.I've often thought that the series deserves to be re-invented for the modern young audience. With a little bit of updating on the rising problems in schools, it could become as popular now as it was then. And, of course, may prove to be a launching pad for upcoming actors.Many reviewers complain that the music has totally changed --- I must be very honest here to say that I did not notice (I did, however, think that the music was a little strange - others obviously have much better long-term memories than I do!). It was enough for me to get absorbed with Johnny Depp and with perfect hindsight be able to see his obvious talent for acting, and his exploration of the strange and wonderful.I've read that Depp hated being a teen star, but in all honesty he should be proud of what 21 Jump Street achieved and its continuing popularity.

They completely cut the song out of the dvd and just cut to Hanson coming to the garage. Also in the original, Hanson plays his sax with the band and then the credits start to roll. On the dvd, he is about to play, and that gets cut too. Some of the words used in the dialogue were dubbed over which was kind of ridiculous considering the show started in 1987 and nothing was dubbed over then.
