The whole film is basically one long interrogation.

562088,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00004ZDFL,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[4, 4]","I always knew Gene Hackman was a superb actor but he eclipses even himself in the complex layering he gives us of a man under suspicion of double rape and homicide.  It reminded me early on of a French film I had been oddly unmoved by, 1981's &quot;Garde a Vue,&quot; and then I learned this was a remake of that film.  Usually, we Americans ruin it when we remake French films but this time I think it is quite the reverse.  One reason is Hackman and the other is that the director and writers have opened this film up so it lost its stagey aspects and moved well beyond the confines and restraints of the police station. Hackman is interrogated by Morgan Freeman, no slouch himself in the acting department.  However, Freeman's police captain character simply does not have the complex nuances of Hackman's. Picture a man who absolutely hates his life, although he is rich, at the top of his profession and married to a beautiful but much younger woman.  What might this man do to release himself from the deadliness of his daily life?  Would killing two girls release him from the grips of this being-dead-while alive state?  Or would he be more likely to shoot himself in the foot or walk in front of a bus?  What extremes of human behavior will he go to in order to break out of walking around like a zombi? This is the fundamental question you have to ask yourself about Hackman's character throughout and he indeed has you vacillating on predicting what he did do.  When you run the entire film back through your memory, the ending, which I cannot tell you, completely fits.  The end makes total sense if you tuned in throughout to each particle of the character that Hackman gave you, starting with the time he first picked up the phone to call the police.  He, after all, is a lawyer who should know better than to open a door he wants to keep shut.

That's why I'm so shocked to see so many people here on Amazon only rating it as `OK'.From beginning to end I couldn't look away. `Under Suspicion' is the type film that I classify as ""PERFECT"", the screenplay, the acting, and EVERY aspect of the production quality is as good as film making gets.The production quality grabs you by the eyes and doesn't let go from beginning to end. This keeps you enthralled so no matter what is happening in the plot the movie keeps a steady fast pace.The plot: As you've discerned from Amazon, this is a physiological murder mystery thriller in REAL TIME. The entire film takes place on New Year's Eve in Puerto Rico. Gene Hackman is a fat cat lawyer living and partying with other fat cat American lawyers in mansions in Puerto Rico. On his way to a New Year's party he is asked by police detective and friend, Morgan Freeman to, ""Drop by the station and answer a few questions."" But it becomes very obvious right away that Hackman is a murder suspect in a series of recent pedophile murders. Hackman is grilled mercilessly by Freeman and his partner young bad ass partner Thomas Jane. Hackman denies everything and fights back this his own psychoanalysis.Having seen so many great performances by Hackman and Freeman I thought I'd seen it all. These actors couldn't offer anything new? Boy was I pleasantly proven wrong! Hackman and Freeman are really set free and unleash the best performances of their careers.The story progresses all in real time in the same setting for two hours. Don't worry, you won't be bored. Freeman attempts to break down Hackman by putting his life on trial. He sees cheap prostitutes, and orders exotic porn online, and he met his trophy wife, Monica Bellucci, when she was only 11 years old!Freeman also focuses his sights on Bellucci hoping to turn her against Hackman. The battle of wits there is just as intense as it is with Hackman.Hackman's actual guilt is left up in the air until literally the last minute of the film and is very meaningful.Don't be worried by all these naysayers on Amazon.

562091,A6OLSZ3I3Q01I,B00004ZDFL,"Charles Paxton Martin ""Paxton in Spain""","[0, 3]","In this crime thriller, based upon the marvellous French film ""Garde &agrave; Vue,""Garde &agrave; vuethere are a hundred tragedies in the lives of the three principal protagonists, and as we see a man slowly coming to the realization that he is not merely being called into the San Juan, Puerto Rico, police station by his old ""friend"" the police captain, magisterially played by the infallible Morgan Freeman, we see how a powerful man can be completely destroyed by an unrelenting interrogation. Proof after proof is supplied to show that there can be no question of this man's guilt. With these great actors and such an interesting plot, how can this fail to be a box-office smash?To begin with, there is absolutely no connection between the human drama unfolding and the time and place of the events, which merely serve to add an element of color to what basically is a three-person drama, four if you want to include the mediocre acting of Freeman's assistant. I believe the producers chose San Juan at Carnival time because they were afraid that audiences would reject a claustrophobic and rather stagey drama which could as easily take place within one single room, anywhere on the planet.This would have made a great one-hour radio drama or TV movie. Freeman breathes life into his part, but my admired Gene Hackman falls progressively apart somewhat as though this were a play on the London or New York stage. Monica Bellucci is a fascinating and beautiful enigma, whose motives never become clear.In the final analysis, the film ends up confusing the spectator.

562093,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00004ZDFL,Daniel McInnis,"[3, 8]","You might wonder how with a cast that includes Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Thomas Jane (Boogie Nights) can this remake of the 1981 French thriller Garde a Vue fall flat.  It's obviously not in the acting, and Lost in Space director Stephen Hopkins does a suprisingly good job at the helm.  So it's got to be the writing, right? Well, not exactly.  The writing is actually pretty good for the first hundred minutes or so, but it's when they try to pull the rug out from underneath us with it's obligatory twist ending (which is quickly becoming the biggest cliche in screenwriting), that things go array.  The dialogue builds tension in a brilliantly subtle way but then they shoot themselves in the foot with a climax that makes everything that proceeded it seem meaningless.Freeman plays a Puerto Rico police captain who reluctantly calls in an old friend to be questioned regarding the murders of two young girls.  Hackman's the prime suspect, having found the second body and spun an inconsistent story that doesn't match the facts of the case.  The give and take between the two as Freeman unrelentingly interrogates Hackman's character is a marvel to watch and the only reason to see this movie at all.Henry (Hackman) is the subject of this psychological rape as he's mercilessly grilled by the captain and his overzealous partner (Jane) into pouring out his every indiscretion to them.  His story is picked apart and scrutinized until he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  I suppose that's what the movie wants to be all about.  It's not much interested in being a crime thriller but has much loftier goals in mind.  It wants to turn the looking glass on a corruptible system of police work, even when it's inadvertent, that puts such a strain on the accused.  That's the real intention of of film, to suggest that the crime's not in the criminal offense itself but in being held under suspicion (thus the title which was modified from the novel &quot;Brainwash&quot; by John Wainwright).During the course of the movie Hackman has his civil liberties stripped away one by one, and by focusing so intensly on his ordeal it undermines the fact that two children have been violated and murdered.  This would be a tense, taunt suspense thriller is only it weren't for those last five minutes which try to be reflective and thoughtful but instead come off as a ridiculously forced conclusion.  In retrospect I realize that the resolution has it's intended purposes, but I still can't help but feel like the authors wrote themselves into a corner that they inevitably had to cheat their way out of.The acting is good, so good in fact I almost hate to give this picture a negative review, but it does little to salvage a scattered plot.  Hackman's thoroughly impressive in the way he allows Henry to be torn down without compromise, never allowing his ego to get in the way of the story, though he probably should have.  Freeman is equally good, proving once again that he can play just about any part he so desires.And the directing's beyond reproach.  Hopkins makes clever use of the camera, allowing the audience to become a part of the story as he tells it.  He's very liberal with flashbacks, permitting the questioning parties (Freeman &amp; Jane) to intrude on the moments as Henry's reliving them.  This is about as creative as movies get, which is quite impressive but only makes me dislike the film even more.  The fact that such highly original moments are wasted on a plot that's going nowhere only serves to make the finished product more distressing.If you missed this one in theatres you're not alone.  It was barely released stateside, which should give you an idea of just how awful the ending truly is.

Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman deliver great performances and Thomas Jane and Monica Bellucci solidly contribute to the movie. The reason I rate this movie so highly is the authenticity of mind bending and misdirection that can occur in awful and traumatic events. The flashback sequences provide valuable perspective.

That assumption would not lead to disappointment in this case.  This is a terrific psychological crime drama with an excellent story, great acting and powerful directing.Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) is a prominent and wealthy citizen of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who found the body of a young girl who had been murdered.  Police captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) is a long time friend of Hearst's and asks him to come down to the station answer some questions and tie up some lose ends.  What ensues is a blistering interrogation where it is clear that Hearst is the prime suspect.The script is smart, probing and full of nuance.  Subtle hints in both directions make us continually re-evaluate Hearst's guilt or innocence as the interrogation twists and turns.  The ending is a surprise and quite abstruse, requiring some reflection to fathom.Stephen Hopkins' (Lost In Space) direction is fabulous.  The camerawork is excellent, using various perspectives and jump cuts to lend power to the dialogue.  I would have liked to see more character development of Captain Benezet to understand his obsessive motivation of trying to nail Hearst.  Also, it seems a bit incongruous to have this set in Puerto Rico and have so many obviously American characters.  Nonetheless, the work by Hopkins is first-rate overall.The acting is superb.  Morgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion.  His dogged pursuit of Hearst never lets up as he is slowly eaten alive by his fixation with proving Hearst is the murderer.  Hackman's performance is equally outstanding.  His is the most complex and mentally tortured character in the film, and he portrays Hearst like a rat on an electric grid.  Italian star Monica Belucci is mysterious and lovely as Hearst's suspicious wife in one of her few American films.  The only mediocre performance comes from Thomas Jane as the detective.  He is unable to match the rhythm and intensity of the rest of the cast.  This part probably should have gone to a Hispanic actor in keeping with the setting.This intense and clever film keeps the audience guessing throughout.  I rated it a 9/10.

It was based on the British novel Brainwash, by John Wainwright. I did not see the French film simply because I can't find it but I've seen Under Suspicion more than once and enjoy it every time even though I know how it ends.As a thriller/mystery/crime investigation, Under Suspicion (2000) teases a viewer and more likely would leave a fan of the pure genre disappointed but as a psychological character study which uses the mystery and serial murders investigation as a device to explore the darkest places of human desires and relationships, it is very good. Besides, watching for almost two hours the duel of wills, intellects, and despairs between noble as always Morgan Freeman and exceptional Gene Hackman is a treat. The director's approach to narrative that allows the viewer to be placed along with Victor (Freeman) inside the flashbacks of Hackman's character, Hector, is interesting, unusual, and fresh, and adds to an uneasy and dark atmosphere of the forbidden and deeply hidden desires and fantasies. As great as they both are, for many years after I saw the film for the first time, it was the striking beauty of then relatively little known to the American viewers, Italian Monica Belucci that I remembered vividly. The film director, Stephen Hopkins wanted to cast Monica Bellucci after watching Mal&egrave;na (2000) while on an overseas flight. I am glad he did. She did not get lost next to her celebrated partners in the film. I also think that moving the action to San Juan, Puerto Rico during the San Sebastian Street Festival that is celebrated every third week in January was a good idea. The carnival atmosphere of music, vibrant colors, and grotesque masks strikes the dramatic contrast with the harrowing devastating experience the main characters of the movie go through and the place in life they find themselves after the investigation is over.

562106,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00004ZDFL,Joseph Haschka,"[22, 24]","Puerto Rico is the unlikely setting for UNDER SUSPICION, a who-done-it that's essentially a stage spotlighted for two of America's finest actors, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman. The latter plays a police captain, Victor Benezet, investigating the recent rape and murder of two young girls. Hackman plays lawyer Henry Hearst, Victor's erstwhile friend, and now the prime suspect. This film features less of Hollywood's usual recipe of thrills, and focuses more on the personalities of the two principals as they verbally spar back and forth as Benezet attempts to close the case. Thomas Jane plays a young homicide detective who'd rather beat a confession out of Hearst  than obtain one through the finesse of interrogation. The magnificently sensual actress, Monica Bellucci, plays Hearst's much younger wife Chantal, icily unavailable to his physical affections after deciding that he was having an affair with her teenage niece. Or was he?The duel begins when Benezet requests that Hearst stop by the police station to answer a few minor questions. After all, it'll only take ten minutes or so, and Hearst will not be delayed attending a charity fund-raising dinner across the street, at which he is to give the main toast at the behest of Benezet's boss, the police Superintendent. Talk about pressure to get on with it.Initially, the plot seems nothing more than a revamped COLUMBO script, as a weary police officer tries to winkle a confession out of a canny adversary. But, it's more than that, even beyond watching these two old pros, Hackman and Freeman, display their acting skills. As Hearst recounts his alibis, which are portrayed to the viewer as flashbacks, the director inserts the Benezet character into those scenes, as if he were physically present, allowing him to ask more questions of Hearst as his alibi unfolds.  This is an ingeniously clever effect that I've not seen in any film previous. And then there's the stunning beauty of Bellucci as she plays Hearst's Ice Queen. Wow! (Yeah, I know, mine is a guy fascination, just like in Monica's splendid Y2K film MALENA.)The ending is totally unexpected. (""Huh? Say, what!""). And, profoundly sad, if one considers the ties that continue to bind in a love relationship gone sour.",4,Two old pros conjure a masterpiece of misdirection,980812800,"01 30, 2001",2001,2249,"['Puerto', 'Rico', 'unlikely', 'setting', 'UNDER', 'SUSPICION', 'who-done-it', 'essentially', 'stage', 'spotlighted', 'two', 'America', 'finest', 'actors', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'latter', 'police', 'captain', 'Victor', 'Benezet', 'investigating', 'recent', 'rape', 'murder', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'Hackman', 'lawyer', 'Henry', 'Hearst', 'Victor', 'erstwhile', 'friend', 'now', 'prime', 'suspect', 'film', 'less', 'Hollywood', 'usual', 'recipe', 'thrills', 'more', 'personalities', 'two', 'principals', 'verbally', 'spar', 'back', 'forth', 'Benezet', 'close', 'case', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'young', 'homicide', 'detective', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'beat', 'confession', 'Hearst', 'obtain', 'one', 'finesse', 'interrogation', 'magnificently', 'sensual', 'actress', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'Hearst', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'Chantal', 'icily', 'unavailable', 'physical', 'affections', 'deciding', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'teenage', 'niece', 'was', 'duel', 'when', 'Benezet', 'Hearst', 'stop', 'police', 'station', 'answer', 'few', 'minor', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'only', 'take', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'Hearst', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'delayed', 'attending', 'charity', 'fund-raising', 'dinner', 'street', 'give', 'main', 'toast', 'behest', 'Benezet', 'boss', 'police', 'Superintendent', 'Talk', 'pressure', 'get', 'it.Initially', 'plot', 'nothing', 'more', 'revamped', 'COLUMBO', 'script', 'weary', 'police', 'officer', 'winkle', 'confession', 'canny', 'adversary', 'more', 'even', 'watching', 'two', 'old', 'pros', 'Hackman', 'Freeman', 'display', 'acting', 'skills', 'Hearst', 'alibis', 'are', 'portrayed', 'viewer', 'flashbacks', 'director', 'Benezet', 'character', 'scenes', 'were', 'physically', 'present', 'allowing', 'ask', 'more', 'questions', 'Hearst', 'alibi', 'unfolds', 'ingeniously', 'clever', 'effect', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'previous', 'then', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'Bellucci', 'Hearst', 'Ice', 'Queen', 'Wow', 'Yeah', 'know', 'mine', 'guy', 'fascination', 'just', 'Monica', 'splendid', 'Y2K', 'film', 'MALENA', 'ending', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'Huh', 'Say', 'what', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'one', 'ties', 'continue', 'bind', 'love', 'relationship', 'gone', 'sour']",Under Suspicion

562108,A3NVNNLSVEVZ99,B00004ZDFL,just Jack,"[6, 7]","""Under Suspicion"" is a truly remarkable film that addresses a taboo issue. The film is well head of its time, which will ensure it remains classic for years to come.Based on John Wainwright's 1960's book ""Brainwash"" and the 1980's French film ""Garde a Vue"" or Police Custody. The book title gives you a hint of the plot which neither film title does. Whether the American movie is loyal to the French film or British book I do not know, but the European influences are readily apparent.One can expect superb performances from Hackman and Freeman, but one should also expect that such actors can choose superlative plots. Under Suspicion is a complex plot which explains why so many do not see it. If anything it is too complex.One of the advantages of film over print is that a film can use multiple Points of View far more readily that print.The first point of view is that of the junior detective, ably acted by Thomas Jane. Horrified by the crime - rape and murder of two children, blinded by prejudice, the detective jumps to the gut belief a rich dirty old man must have done it. The detective reflects the mob mentality.The second point of view is that of the senior detective (Freeman). Both detective and suspect (Hackman) are of similar age, know each other and have similar marital problem, so a battle of wills develops between them. This is common plot device used to encourage the audience to identify with the characters but in this film it detracts from and confuses the plot.The film opens with a plot device intended to create tension. The suspect is on his way to public speaking engagement when called in for questioning. This is implausible and again detracts from the plot. The device becomes effective when the senior detective's boss puts pressure on the detective to release the suspect to fulfil the engagement.The evidence against the suspect (Hackman) is circumstantial. However the suspect's explanation of the events is confused and self-incriminating, which serves to convince the Senior Detective of his guilt. Hence the title of the French film - Police Custody.At one stage the plot `thickens' leading the audience to suspect the male suspect is guilty of under-age sex, but his wife is guilty of murder, driven by jealousy. This plot line is made implausible by the beauty and young age of the character playing the wife, Monica Bellucci.The subtext of ""Under Suspicion"" is classically French. Many Hollywood films seek to capture the beauty of French film when seeks to get behind the headline ""Lock your daughters away - Paedophile on the rampage, raping and murdering little girls."" French film often deals sensitively with the cause of such issues. The problem is not Hollywood' failure to portray the issues but the audience demand for likes of Scream 1, 2 and 3.The subplot, the theme of the film, is played out by the suspect (Hackman) and to a lesser extent by the wife (Bellucci). The subplot is brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. Whether he is guilty or not is irrelevant by the end of the film. The suspect is coerced into believing he is guilty. Hence the book title ""Brainwash"".The Point of View of the wife, told more than acted, reveals the sub-plot and the theme of the film. She first met the suspect when she was twelve and he was a 30 year old adult. His hobby was photography. She delighted in the attention of his camera lens. As she grows she accepts his patronage to attend university and finding men of her own age wanting, she returns to seek him sexually. Passionately in love, they become the celebrities of their town, until one day she sees him paying the same photographic attention to her niece. Blinded by jealousy she believes his intention can only be sexual. In her jealous rage she freezes him out. His sexual deprivation, his love of photography, merely serve to provide motivation to the circumstantial evidence. If his wife, the one person he loves, can believe he is guilty, then he must be. Hence he confesses to something he had not done.""Under Suspicion"" is a gripping and frightening film. Its shows how innocent people can be made to feel guilty and be found guilty by social prejudice, ignorance and misunderstanding. More frightening is the potential sequel to the story. That a person made to feel guilty, but found not guilty, can and probably will proceed to commit the crime with impunity. Both themes have been portrayed in other books and films. I do not know of a film which portrays both themes with the subject of paedophilia. Lolita is probably the closest one can get. Under Suspicion fires a warning shot across society's bows. It warns that the more society is blinded by moral indignation, which is happening with paedophilia, the worse problem will get and innocent people will be destroyed by the prejudices of the lynch mob.All film functions to reinforce or question society's values and attitudes. Society, even in 2009, is not yet ready for the questions raised by ""Under Suspicion"". Brilliantly acted, directed and edited, `Under Suspicion' is undermined by the commercial demands on contemporary cinema.

562110,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004ZDFL,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","The heavyweight casting of ""Under Suspicion"" might be so impressive that it ultimately hurts the film.  Certainly the idea of having Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in a room going after each other in a lengthy police interrogation is going to be worth the watching, but given who the principles are director Stephen Hopkins may be stacking the deck too much in terms of how we resolve the film's ambiguities.  After all, we fully expect Freeman to be playing a good cop and you can never really look at any character Hackman is playing without wondering what he is really up to.  The tag line for this film only serves to emphasize this idea: ""Everyone has secrests.  Some of them are crimes.""This 2000 drama is a remake, after the peculiar manner of such things, of the 1981 French film ""Garde &agrave; vue.""  This time the setting is in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which allows the film to have an exotic element while retaining the rules of American jurisprudence.  During the celebration of San Sebastian's Feast police captain Victor Benezet (Freeman) asks prominent attorney Henry Hearst (Hackman) to come in and answer a few questions about the statement he gave about finding the body of a murdered girl.  This is the second such murder in the last couple of weeks and the police are trying to capture what they fear is a serial killer.  But as Hearst answers Benezet's questions more and more holes appear in his story, which raises even more questions about not only what the lawyer was doing when he discovered the body, but what other things he has been up to in recent weeks.Clearly we are to think that Hearst is guilty, but from the start we have the feeling that there is more that is going on here than meets the eye.  But the more Benezet uncovers Hearst's questionable interesting in ""young"" women and his troubled marriage with the beautiful Chantal (Monica Bellucci), the more we become convinced that there is something missing, some key piece to the puzzle that we do not yet understand.  Herding us in this direction are the frequent pronouncements by Det. Felix Owens (Thomas Jane), who is investigating the murders, that Hearst in absolutely guilty.  This guy in trying to drive the nails into the coffin way too soon and even sabotages the interrogation in his eagerness to get to the part when Hearst gets executed for his crimes.The fact that this is a criminal investigation obscures that what we have here is a psychological drama.  Benezet believes that he can find the truth by unraveling the layers of lies and obfuscations that Hearst has created about his life and personal habits.  Step by step the interrogation strips away not only Hearst's secrets but his toupee as well.  To get Hearst to crack Benezet brings Chantal Hearst into the process, hoping that she will allow them to search the house and asking her questions that illuminate more lies in what her husband has been telling the police.Part of the attraction here is that Hearst fights back.  He knows that Benezet has recently been divorced and is able to put together some telling guesses about the glass house in which the captain is living.  Hearst knows how the game is played and is sharp enough to know when the police are overplaying their hand.  He is a respected member of the community, supposedly giving them ten minutes of his time on his way to give a speech at a fundraiser, and he knows that bringing him down could make the careers of Benezet and Owens.  But the main strength of the paper is that whatever the shortcomings of the script Hackman and Freeman make you pay attention.  I would have loved to have seen them do this as a stage play, without the Hopkins constantly showing us in flashbacks what the two men are talking about, and letting these two heavyweights carry the entire thing.In the end, what you think about ""Under Suspicion"" comes down to whether or not you buy the ending.  I can see how many viewers would have problems catching and understanding the ""why"" for what happens.  I picked it up the first time simply because I was paying more attention to a look in the eyes more than what was being said at the crucial moment.  Be fully prepared to watch this film twice, so that you can reassure yourself that what happens at the end comes both logically and emotionally from all that comes before it.  I think you will be able to see how it makes sense, although you might not appreciate that the came comes to an end with a quiet surprise rather than a big shock.",4,"""Everyone has secrets.

562111,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00004ZDFL,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 8]","Despite the fact of the excellence of acting of Morgan Freeman and the interesting performance of Gene Hackman, this movie comes off as a mishmash.  The theme of sexual abuse of a child is such an emotionally loaded one that it needs to be treated with great sensitivity.  In ""Under Suspicion"" (US), it is exploited to further the plot.  Hackman as Henry Hearst is great in the scene where he confesses that he ""likes them young"" as his young wife watches through the glass.  Thomas Jane is explosive as the young detective who can't control himself.  Monica Bellucci as wife Chantal comes across as an ice princess, covering all emotions from A to B.  The DVD version doesn't offer much more, no deleted scenes.  The discourse on the filming is embarrassing.  Freeman and Hackman talk about how much they loved the French film (Garde a Vue by Claude Miller) on which this was based.  Because US is so poor, it's sad to see how little enthusiasm can accomplish.  They liked the tension between the characters; and that was good.

562115,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00004ZDFL,Matthew Gladney,"[5, 6]","'Under Suspicion' is one of those movies which is, to put it honestly, mediocre. It stars two fine actors (Morgan Freeman &amp; Gene Hackman), is quite innovatively directed (by Stephen Hopkins), and has an interesting setting (Puerto Rico during a carnival). The plot, on the other hand, comes across pretty standard.This is basically a police interrogation, familiar to many as it has been rendered time and again on television and in other movies. It is done well, by all involved, but it has also been done before. Hackman and Freeman, and the direction of Hopkins, lift the telling of the tale up a notch, but it still feels like old ground. There has been crime commited (in this case two murders), there is a prime suspect (Hackman), and so he and the overzealous policeman (Freeman) square off for a close-quarters interrogation.This sort of scenario, though well-worn, can make for a really good movie, so I sat back and soaked it all in. The film kept me riveted throughout, until the ending came along. Now, I am not here to give anything away - don't worry. But what I will say is that the picture suddenly went from its entire focus of a &quot;Did he do it?&quot; interrogation flick to &quot;Let's pause and reflect upon these characters, their lives, their hopes, their troubles, their fears, their desires, their angst&quot; - etc. etc.A movie which wants to end so poignantly must be sure to make the audience care about the characters. Maybe other viewers did. I did not, as I took this movie as a mystery/thriller. Most mystery/thrillers are simply plot-driven, and I saw no exception with 'Under Suspicion'. In a mystery/thriller, most of the actions taken by the characters are usually scrutinized for how they affect the *plot*, not the characters themselves.I don't know if I've expressed my thoughts on the matter very well - perhaps not. But my final word on the film is that it is enjoyable and engaging until the last 5-10 minutes. Just be prepared for what some may deem a possibly disappointing ending.",3,"A Good Attempt, But.....",993859200,"06 30, 2001",2001,2031,"['Suspicion', 'one', 'movies', 'put', 'honestly', 'mediocre', 'two', 'fine', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'amp', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'quite', 'innovatively', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Hopkins', 'interesting', 'setting', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'carnival', 'plot', 'other', 'hand', 'pretty', 'standard.This', 'basically', 'police', 'interrogation', 'familiar', 'many', 'been', 'rendered', 'time', 'again', 'television', 'other', 'movies', 'done', 'well', 'involved', 'also', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Hackman', 'Freeman', 'direction', 'Hopkins', 'telling', 'tale', 'up', 'notch', 'still', 'old', 'ground', 'been', 'crime', 'commited', 'case', 'two', 'murders', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Hackman', 'so', 'overzealous', 'policeman', 'Freeman', 'square', 'off', 'close-quarters', 'interrogation.This', 'sort', 'scenario', 'well-worn', 'can', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'sat', 'back', 'soaked', 'film', 'kept', 'riveted', 'ending', 'came', 'along', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'here', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'picture', 'suddenly', 'went', 'entire', 'focus', 'quot', 'Did', 'do', 'quot', 'interrogation', 'flick', 'quot', 'Let', 'pause', 'reflect', 'characters', 'lives', 'hopes', 'troubles', 'fears', 'desires', 'angst', 'quot', 'etc', 'movie', 'end', 'so', 'poignantly', 'must', 'be', 'sure', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'characters', 'Maybe', 'other', 'viewers', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'took', 'movie', 'mystery/thriller', 'Most', 'mystery/thrillers', 'are', 'simply', 'plot-driven', 'saw', 'exception', ""'Under"", 'Suspicion', 'mystery/thriller', 'most', 'actions', 'taken', 'characters', 'are', 'usually', 'scrutinized', 'how', 'affect', '*plot*', 'not', 'characters', 'themselves.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'expressed', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'very', 'well', 'perhaps', 'not', 'final', 'word', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'engaging', 'last', '5-10', 'minutes', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'what', 'may', 'deem', 'possibly', 'disappointing', 'ending']",Under Suspicion

Perhaps from a marketing standpoint, it was. To people who love movies, though, anything starring Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman is worth a look-see, and Under Suspicion, while marred by a few slow spots and a rather weak ending, is no disaster. I can assure you that sparks fly when Hackman and Freeman are on screen together.The setting is present day San Juan, Puerto Rico. Police Captain Victor Benezet [Freeman] is investigating the murders of two young girls. A big problem is that the finger of suspicion points at Henry Hearst [Hackman], who is not only one of the island's most respected citizens, but also an old friend of Benezet's. On the night of a big charity event at which Hearst is the guest of honor, Benezet calls him in for a short question and answer session before the event. The interview turns into a lengthy one in which Hearst's life unravels before his eyes. The plot line concerns two things. The first is whether or not Hearst is guilty. The other is an examination of how brutal an investigation into one's private life can be. With today's high tech police technique's, even the innocent can become the guilty because of other things the process can reveal.Even though this is not their finest movie, Freeman and Hackman are at their finest. They are the type of actors who do not give a bad performance, regardless of the strengths or weaknesses of the script. Each has always been smart enough to combine a good work ethic with his genius. Also noteworthy is Thomas Jane as Detective Owens, although he is handicapped by having to play a very stereotypical character, the type you are all too happy to see leave the scene. Monica Bellucci, who plays Hearst's much younger wife, is a major star in her native Italy. Her role requires little more of her than standing around looking exquisitely beautiful, which she does extremely well.I think Under Suspicion is most appealing to those who enjoy a good play. While director Stephen Hopkins does take some advantage of the glorious Puerto Rico scenery, much of the movie takes place in two rooms of the police station. This gives it a stagy feel, which some people do not at all enjoy.",3,"Hackman, Freeman, Janes excellent in stagy 'Suspicion'",1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2315,"['way', 'distributor', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'yanked', 'theaters', 'just', 'handful', 'play', 'dates', ""'d"", 'think', 'Suspicion', 'was', 'disaster', 'Perhaps', 'marketing', 'standpoint', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'movies', 'though', 'anything', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'look-see', 'Suspicion', 'marred', 'few', 'slow', 'spots', 'rather', 'weak', 'ending', 'disaster', 'can', 'assure', 'fly', 'when', 'Hackman', 'Freeman', 'are', 'screen', 'together.The', 'setting', 'present', 'day', 'San', 'Juan', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Police', 'Captain', 'Victor', 'Benezet', '[', 'Freeman', ']', 'investigating', 'murders', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'big', 'problem', 'finger', 'suspicion', 'points', 'Henry', 'Hearst', '[', 'Hackman', ']', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'island', 'most', 'respected', 'citizens', 'also', 'old', 'friend', 'Benezet', 'night', 'big', 'charity', 'event', 'Hearst', 'guest', 'honor', 'Benezet', 'short', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'event', 'interview', 'lengthy', 'one', 'Hearst', 'life', 'unravels', 'eyes', 'plot', 'line', 'concerns', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'not', 'Hearst', 'guilty', 'other', 'examination', 'how', 'brutal', 'investigation', 'one', 'private', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'today', 'high', 'tech', 'police', 'technique', 'even', 'innocent', 'can', 'become', 'guilty', 'other', 'things', 'process', 'can', 'reveal.Even', 'not', 'finest', 'movie', 'Freeman', 'Hackman', 'are', 'finest', 'are', 'type', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'bad', 'performance', 'regardless', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'always', 'been', 'smart', 'enough', 'combine', 'good', 'work', 'ethic', 'genius', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Detective', 'Owens', 'handicapped', 'having', 'play', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'character', 'type', 'are', 'too', 'happy', 'see', 'leave', 'scene', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'who', 'Hearst', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'major', 'star', 'native', 'Italy', 'role', 'little', 'more', 'standing', 'looking', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'extremely', 'well.I', 'think', 'Suspicion', 'most', 'appealing', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'play', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Hopkins', 'take', 'advantage', 'glorious', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'scenery', 'much', 'movie', 'place', 'two', 'rooms', 'police', 'station', 'stagy', 'feel', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy']",Under Suspicion

Compounded by this interrogation-style movie, we expected to have a treat.  In many ways, this movie meant to do well with a great location such as Puerto Rico, the female star in the form of Monica Belluchi (who found fame in an Italian movie, &amp; also as a beau to Bruce Willis), &amp; not to mention a director, Stephen Hopkins who gave us &quot;The Ghost &amp; The Darkness&quot;, starring Michael Douglas &amp; Val Kilmer.  Sad to say that I was disappointed with the outcome &amp; it was quite akin to &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;, a dud starred Nicholas Cage &amp; Gary Sinise.  The interrogation was constant in a room, &amp; there were flashbacks from those three main characters.  Camera tricks were used to make it interesting but the premise of this movie was so thin &amp; that after two hours, we couldn't help it but exhausted by the ordeal.  This movie explored also the strained relationships between Gene Hackman's character &amp; his wife, &amp; also testing the friendships between Gene's character &amp; Morgan's character.  Anyhow, to have those two as executive producers as well, they really missed the target by a wide margin.  No wonder this movie went straight to the video market.

562124,A3KJ9UTP3TSDJW,B00004ZDFL,"Professor Emeritus P. Bagnolo ""Slugger/BIGGUY""","[3, 4]","The title foreshadows the subtle reality behind the film, missed even by some professional critics. Hackman plays Henry Hearst, a noted attorney, and rather well-off, to say the least, and a close friend of police Captain, Victor Benezet, played by Morgan Freeman. Hearst's much, much, younger wife, Chantal, is the erotically, gorgeous, Italian star, Monica Bellucci.  Thomas Jane plays a not-so-bright, detective, with a desire for violent solutions to gaining a confession. Hearst, is apparently, incredibly wealthy, and on his way to be the be key note speaker at an event at the request of Captain Benezet's boss, when he is asked by Benezet to stop by headquaters for ""ten minutes, or so,"" to help out with the case of two murdered teenage girls.Ten minutes stretches into hours and a cat and mouse game between the obviously brilliant lawyer, Hearst, and the cagy, Benezet, ensues. Benezet has his pal squirming, and Hearst's gorgeous wife has shut him out of her affections, over what she saw as his attempts to seduce her teenaged niece, so the introduction of Benezet's evidence of Hearst's possible dallaince and murders of girls about the same age as the niece who is object of Chantal's apparent insecurity, (or was it an excuse (?) for her to rebel  against, or reject, her older husband), gives her cause for reflection. As the torturous grilling goes on, the stress on the participents becomes almost unbearable. Hearst and Benezet are featured in innovative flashbacks of the sort one sees regularly on CSI Miami, and as the tension builds, tempers flare, violence seems right around the corner, and one wonders, where is the lawyer's, lawyers(?), as the duel works it's deceptions into the psyche of the suspect, witnesses and Interrogators.Hearst's guilt/innocence, glides back and forth with every new revelation of each member of the drama. I shall not spoil, the conclusion for you, but the acting, direction, script, and settings are flawless and the ending is somewhat unexpected, though we guessed correctly, our companions did not.What floated under the radar, hence my title, was the lustfull envy of both Benezet and the young, violence prone, detective at Hearst's wealth, position, intellect, possessions, prominently including his luscious and much younger wife, Bellucci as Chantal. One can see the roiling covetousness of the antagonists of Hearst, and the feeling rises, that one sees so often now days, of a lawman making every effort to nail a wealthy and fortunate man, at the expense of justice. Benezet, seems determined to wreck the rest of Hearst's life to satisfy his jealousy and his young assistant seems to care little about anything but throwing a few punches and maybe getting closer to Chantal, also Benezet's, seeming, but more reserved desire. Mankind's error is that the interpretation of the word ""covet"" does nor merely mean desiring what another has, but acting maliciously upon that desire, to steal it away, whether or not they benefit from their action.It is the old case of penis, cash and prominence, envy, of men locked in jobs which pay is nominal, who lust after what they cannot have and another, whose grass may not be as green as they think and desire.You cannot go wrong with Freeman, Hackman, and Stephen Hopkins masterful direction, exposing lust, uncertainty, disloyalty, distrust, immaturity and  envy. Watch Hackman, in the final scene, display his self-respect, despite what must have been a heartbreaking realization.The only questionable thing, which seemed a bit ludicrous in this taut drama, is why Hearst, a skilled and successful attorney, did not immediately clam up and call a criminal attorney. It appeared to be an author's less than honest, contrivance, a shill game, which covered up a weakness in the plot-line which would have alerted Allen Shore-James Spader-Boston Legal, had this been written by David E. Kelley. Kelley would have reconstructed the plot to compensate for the oversight or laziness, or the attempt to put one over on the audience. He would have post-haste ended the interrogation and cut to a trial instead. The proper answer by Hearst to the first subtly suspicious question should have been, ""Either arrest me, release me, or I will call my lawyer, Right now!""The dessert is that even the measured glimpses of the alluring Monica Bellucci, remind one of all besides the art, the food and land/seascapes, that is good about Italy.",5,BELOW THE RADAR,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,4436,"['title', 'subtle', 'reality', 'film', 'missed', 'even', 'professional', 'critics', 'Hackman', 'Henry', 'Hearst', 'noted', 'attorney', 'rather', 'well-off', 'say', 'least', 'close', 'friend', 'police', 'Captain', 'Victor', 'Benezet', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Hearst', 'much', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'Chantal', 'erotically', 'gorgeous', 'Italian', 'star', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'not-so-bright', 'detective', 'desire', 'violent', 'solutions', 'gaining', 'confession', 'Hearst', 'apparently', 'incredibly', 'wealthy', 'way', 'be', 'be', 'key', 'note', 'speaker', 'event', 'request', 'Captain', 'Benezet', 'boss', 'when', 'asked', 'Benezet', 'stop', 'headquaters', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'help', 'out', 'case', 'two', 'murdered', 'teenage', 'girls.Ten', 'minutes', 'stretches', 'hours', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'obviously', 'brilliant', 'lawyer', 'Hearst', 'cagy', 'Benezet', 'Benezet', 'pal', 'squirming', 'Hearst', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'shut', 'affections', 'what', 'saw', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'teenaged', 'niece', 'introduction', 'Benezet', 'evidence', 'Hearst', 'possible', 'dallaince', 'murders', 'girls', 'same', 'age', 'niece', 'who', 'object', 'Chantal', 'apparent', 'insecurity', 'was', 'excuse', 'rebel', 'reject', 'older', 'husband', 'cause', 'reflection', 'torturous', 'grilling', 'stress', 'participents', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'Hearst', 'Benezet', 'are', 'featured', 'innovative', 'flashbacks', 'sort', 'one', 'regularly', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'tension', 'builds', 'tempers', 'flare', 'violence', 'right', 'corner', 'one', 'wonders', 'where', 'lawyer', 'lawyers', 'duel', 'deceptions', 'psyche', 'suspect', 'witnesses', 'Interrogators.Hearst', 'guilt/innocence', 'back', 'forth', 'new', 'revelation', 'member', 'drama', 'shall', 'not', 'spoil', 'conclusion', 'acting', 'direction', 'script', 'settings', 'are', 'flawless', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'guessed', 'correctly', 'companions', 'did', 'not.What', 'floated', 'radar', 'hence', 'title', 'was', 'lustfull', 'envy', 'Benezet', 'young', 'violence', 'prone', 'detective', 'Hearst', 'wealth', 'position', 'intellect', 'possessions', 'prominently', 'including', 'luscious', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'Bellucci', 'Chantal', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'roiling', 'covetousness', 'antagonists', 'Hearst', 'feeling', 'one', 'so', 'often', 'now', 'days', 'lawman', 'making', 'effort', 'nail', 'wealthy', 'fortunate', 'man', 'expense', 'justice', 'Benezet', 'determined', 'wreck', 'rest', 'Hearst', 'life', 'satisfy', 'jealousy', 'young', 'assistant', 'care', 'little', 'anything', 'throwing', 'few', 'punches', 'maybe', 'getting', 'closer', 'Chantal', 'also', 'Benezet', 'seeming', 'more', 'reserved', 'desire', 'Mankind', 'error', 'interpretation', 'word', 'covet', 'merely', 'mean', 'desiring', 'what', 'acting', 'maliciously', 'desire', 'steal', 'away', 'not', 'benefit', 'action.It', 'old', 'case', 'penis', 'cash', 'prominence', 'envy', 'men', 'locked', 'jobs', 'pay', 'nominal', 'who', 'lust', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'grass', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'green', 'think', 'desire.You', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Freeman', 'Hackman', 'Stephen', 'Hopkins', 'masterful', 'direction', 'exposing', 'lust', 'uncertainty', 'disloyalty', 'distrust', 'immaturity', 'envy', 'Watch', 'Hackman', 'final', 'scene', 'display', 'self-respect', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'heartbreaking', 'realization.The', 'only', 'questionable', 'thing', 'seemed', 'bit', 'ludicrous', 'taut', 'drama', 'why', 'Hearst', 'skilled', 'successful', 'attorney', 'did', 'not', 'immediately', 'clam', 'up', 'call', 'criminal', 'attorney', 'appeared', 'be', 'author', 'less', 'honest', 'contrivance', 'shill', 'game', 'covered', 'up', 'weakness', 'plot-line', 'would', 'have', 'alerted', 'Allen', 'Shore-James', 'Spader-Boston', 'Legal', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'Kelley', 'would', 'have', 'reconstructed', 'plot', 'compensate', 'oversight', 'laziness', 'attempt', 'put', 'one', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'post-haste', 'ended', 'interrogation', 'cut', 'trial', 'instead', 'proper', 'answer', 'Hearst', 'first', 'subtly', 'suspicious', 'question', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'arrest', 'release', 'will', 'call', 'lawyer', 'Right', 'now', 'dessert', 'even', 'measured', 'glimpses', 'alluring', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'remind', 'one', 'art', 'food', 'land/seascapes', 'good', 'Italy']",Under Suspicion

Then he discovers the body of a little girl and reports it to the police--as any good citizen should.Captain Victor Benezet (Freeman) is a hard-working police captain who investigates the first death and discovers more. He calls Henry to the station on the night of a prestigious charity event for questioning along with his subordinate Detective Owens (Thomas Jane).The problem comes when Hearst's story doesn't quite stack up.  On the night of a benefit ball where Hearst is supposed to speak, Benezet calls him in for questioning.Benezet is under a lot of pressure.  Hearst is a powerful man on the island and a friend of his boss.  Plus, he's the keynote speaker at the fundraiser--and the island needs the money.  Hurricane Lucy has just ripped through and despite the party atmosphere, they have a cholera outbreak, open pits for sewers and the other plagues a storm leaves behind.The questioning is rough, revealing omissions in Henry's story, plus his life isn't quite as much of a dream as we'd once believe.  We see the story unfold  through testimony, flashbacks, and current happenings.  Henry and his wife sleep in separate bedrooms--regarding the alibis: ""We don't ask those kind of questions anymore..."" Henry regularly visits young prostitutes, because: ""Someone opposite Chantal. A prostitute will give you a great deal for a little bit of money..."" Henry has a fondness for young children--he 'raised' Chantal to be the woman of his dreams...But--did he do the crime or didn't he?  I was almost on the edge of my seat wondering through the whole film.  Both Hackman and Freeman give stellar performances and the story is fascinating, but I think I could have done with about 20 minutes less film somewhere.If you're a fan of intense, interpersonal drama, this film's one for you.
