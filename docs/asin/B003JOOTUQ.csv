1347638,A2KR1OGGF0OU8O,B003JOOTUQ,George T. Thorn,"[23, 25]","Jeff Dunham has become one of my favourite commedians. It is wonderful to again see much of Jeff's early work as he perfected his art form. Like a great sitcom Jeff has built his characters in a box over the years to create an actual personality for each one. It is amazing to watch him perform first as a stand up commedian, then to bring his friends into the show. As the characters appear in the show they become real personalities that attack the crowd, a nationality or an issue of the time and Jeff falls back allowing the character to run the show. The characters will then bring Jeff back into the show as they interface directly with him. Jeff is truly the man with many personalities. This DVD is a must for any fan of Jeff Dunham, the characters never become stale.",5,Early Jeff,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,776,"['Jeff', 'Dunham', 'become', 'one', 'favourite', 'commedians', 'wonderful', 'again', 'see', 'much', 'Jeff', 'early', 'work', 'perfected', 'art', 'form', 'great', 'sitcom', 'Jeff', 'built', 'characters', 'box', 'years', 'create', 'actual', 'personality', 'one', 'amazing', 'watch', 'perform', 'first', 'stand', 'up', 'commedian', 'then', 'bring', 'friends', 'show', 'characters', 'appear', 'show', 'become', 'real', 'personalities', 'attack', 'crowd', 'nationality', 'issue', 'time', 'Jeff', 'back', 'allowing', 'character', 'run', 'show', 'characters', 'will', 'then', 'bring', 'Jeff', 'back', 'show', 'interface', 'directly', 'Jeff', 'truly', 'man', 'many', 'personalities', 'DVD', 'must', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'characters', 'never', 'become', 'stale']",Lafflink Presents: The Platinum Comedy Series Vol. 4: Jeff Dunham
