Milligan,"[0, 0]","If you've seen the first five seasons of 'The guild', whether online, on DVD, or both, you will notice that this season is a LOT more involved with other things other than the Knights of Good sitting behind their computers and interacting via microphones and headphones.This season has more of everything - secondary characters, extras, subplots.  the gist of the season is that Codex gets a job as the creator of the game's assistant. And everyone is trying to get him to release another expansion of the game - an underwater world. Everyone who worked on it liked it. But a single negative comment about anything, puts the guy into a tailspin, and can't make a decision about anything.I have to say, I think I liked the earlier seasons better when it was mostly just the core characters. But if you have already purchased the first five seasons, then you cannot NOT get this one!And who knows, maybe it will be your favorite season.The extras include a behind the scenes on an almost daily basis, cast audio commentary, and the video &#34;I'm the One Who's Cool.&#34;",4,The Guild: Season Six,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1069,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', ""'The"", 'guild', 'online', 'DVD', 'will', 'notice', 'season', 'LOT', 'more', 'involved', 'other', 'things', 'other', 'Knights', 'Good', 'sitting', 'computers', 'interacting', 'microphones', 'headphones.This', 'season', 'more', 'everything', 'secondary', 'characters', 'extras', 'subplots', 'gist', 'season', 'Codex', 'job', 'creator', 'game', 'assistant', 'everyone', 'trying', 'get', 'release', 'expansion', 'game', 'underwater', 'world', 'Everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'liked', 'single', 'negative', 'comment', 'anything', 'guy', 'tailspin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'decision', 'anything.I', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'liked', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'mostly', 'just', 'core', 'characters', 'have', 'already', 'purchased', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'NOT', 'get', 'one', 'who', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'favorite', 'season.The', 'extras', 'include', 'scenes', 'almost', 'daily', 'basis', 'cast', 'audio', 'commentary', 'video', '34', ""'m"", 'One', 'Who', 'Cool.', '34']",The Guild: Season 6

I thought the last season brought us to a point where there was real growth in each character and that the reality of life began to have meaning for them. How did these changes occur? Buy the dvd or watch it on Youtube. Felicia is one hell of a talent.,5,Good ending,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,285,"['love', 'show', 'love', 'Felicia', 'thought', 'last', 'season', 'brought', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'real', 'growth', 'character', 'reality', 'life', 'began', 'have', 'meaning', 'How', 'did', 'changes', 'occur', 'Buy', 'dvd', 'watch', 'Youtube', 'Felicia', 'one', 'hell', 'talent']",The Guild: Season 6
1661146,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DT55P44,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","Everyone's favorite Guildies return for the sixth and final season of the fantastic web series ""The Guild.""  After four seasons creating a fairly insular world, Season Five broke format and took to the road.  With the cast attending a huge gaming conference, we finally got the opportunity to see our lively cast interact with others without the aid of avatars and video conferencing.  And while not everyone loved this conceit, it opened up a myriad of new possibilities and presented tons of terrific celebrity cameos.  The twelve episodes of Season Six pick up directly following the events at that conference.  Codex (the invaluable Felicia Day) has her new dream job working for Floyd Petrovsky (Ted Michaels), the creator of ""The Game.""  In addition, Vork (Jeff Lewis) was able to score a romantic bond with former sci-fi starlet Madeleine Twain (played by Buck Roger's Erin Gray) and that courtship continues into these episodes.  But don't worry!  If you think a good woman can tame Vork into normality, it simply will never happen!Most of the action in Season Six does concern this new workplace setting and each of the cast members pursuing outside interests.  Codex is instantly hated by the staff due to her exalted status as Floyd's right hand man and confidante.  They just want to release the underwater expansion for the game, but the erratic Floyd can't withstand fan criticism and is a mass of indecision.  When Codex gets a key to test the new areas out, the other members of the Guild can't resist being drawn in to the drama.  Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh) poses as an IT guy (of course) and finds unexpected bliss beneath the sea.  Tink (Amy Okuda) exercises her feminine wiles on a young programmer (a likable Corey Craig) and gets more than she bargains for.  And Vork, after a confrontation with Floyd, mounts a massive and hilarious protest outside the studio.  That leaves Bladezz (Vincent Casso) and Clara (Robin Thorsen) to largely fend for themselves in the B-story.  But it's a great one!  Clara wants to prove she's a good mom (yeah, right) and Bladezz wants to cash in on her experiences so they embark on a new vlogging enterprise to accomplish both goals.  Hilariously, Clara's husband figures prominently into the story and gets some really funny action and it's about time.Bonus Features on DVD Release:Commentary TracksProduction Diary FeaturetteBehind the Scenes of The Guild""I'm The One That's Cool"" Music VideoGag ReelSeason Six seems a bit more slickly produced than other years, and a world apart from the primitive looking episodes from the premiere in 2007.  They even have a sleek new graphic over the opening music.  As I mentioned, this is 12 complete episodes (the shortest was probably shy of seven minutes and the longest maybe around eleven minutes).  For my money, this was actually one of my favorite years.  As a finale, it has left all of the major characters better off than where they started and (dare I say) relatively happy.  I loved the story lines and the supporting cast.  But all of the major players had a tremendous opportunity to shine in these final episodes and that's what made it so satisfying for me.  I'll miss ""The Guild"", to be sure, but this is a fitting send-off.
