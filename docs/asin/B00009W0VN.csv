I have been doing yoga for years, so I thought ""beginner"" would be too easy. However, I really like Sara Ivanhoe (her early Crunch yoga DVDs are cute and fun), so I decided to give it a chance anyway. For me, this is a good routine to do when I am low energy and need something much more mellow than my typical workout. The poses were a lot of fun, and because I wasn't straining, I could focus on my alignment. The routine doesn't move too quickly, so I felt as though I had time to arrange myself on the ball. I also was able to follow the instructions Sara was giving without straining to watch her or having to turn around to look (good routine choreography!) I did find that in some poses the ball rolled out from under me and was difficult to use as a balance tool, but most of the time I found myself thinking: ""Wow, I'm tempted to use the balance ball in my regular yoga practice, this is great!""

758588,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B00009W0VN,Joanna Daneman,"[105, 109]","My sister the yogi insisted I get started doing this ancient form of exercise. She's been doing yoga for years, and while I did yoga in high school, I've been a drop-out for decades. Ok, ok, I'm getting started, really, I am, Sis!I chose this Yoga DVD because it was labeled for  ""beginners"" and also because I have a large exercise ball gathering dust. I liked the idea of using the ball for support because I am clumsy as hell, and the ball acts as a sort of yoga block as well as making you use your small muscles as you strive to balance. (I was told by a professional trainer that this is why free weights and walking are superior to static machine exercises, because the act of balancing uses many more muscles.) So I pumped up the big ball and dusted it off, got out a sticky mat (you need one for this) and took off my shoes and put on some suitable yogi pants and a soft tee shirt. I then tested the ball, as the DVD instructs you, to make sure it was at the right firmness to position me correctly.Ms. Ivanhoe has a clear, pleasant voice, the filming is bright, well-positioned and easy to follow. The workout was moderately challenging for me--nothing I couldn't do, but not overly easy. I felt the workout immediately in my abdominals, while getting a pleasant stretch to my entire back. You start with a series of movements, each position flowing into two or three more ""asanas"" to make a set of exercises. The first set uses the puppy pose (head down, back arched inward) and the pyramid pose (rather like stretching the hamstrings before working out.) You roll the ball down and put your hands on the ball rather than on the mat as an advanced pose might have you do. A nice back stretch. The second set used the cat pose (arching and swaying your back) and ending up in the plank pose--lying prone on the ball, using your hands to support you in a horizontal position that makes you use your abdominals. The next set was the ""Salute to the Sun"" --four more moves.  Throughout, the instructor tells you which asana to inhale on, and which to exhale on--this is important, says my sister. The key to Yoga is knowing when to breath and this is not always part of every instructional tape or DVD.  When I was done, I felt my abdominals had been worked--I felt ""centered"" which is the aim of this set of yoga exercises.I rate this five stars--definitely good for a beginner (assuming you have no health issues you must discuss with your physician) and a great way to get started in yoga. I enjoyed every moment of this workout on the ball.",5,"Great for the beginner--relaxing, fun and effective",1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,2550,"['sister', 'yogi', 'insisted', 'get', 'started', 'doing', 'ancient', 'form', 'exercise', 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'years', 'did', 'yoga', 'high', 'school', ""'ve"", 'been', 'drop-out', 'decades', 'Ok', 'ok', ""'m"", 'getting', 'started', 'really', 'am', 'Sis', 'chose', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'was', 'labeled', 'beginners', 'also', 'have', 'large', 'exercise', 'ball', 'gathering', 'dust', 'liked', 'idea', 'using', 'ball', 'support', 'am', 'clumsy', 'hell', 'ball', 'sort', 'yoga', 'block', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'use', 'small', 'muscles', 'strive', 'balance', 'was', 'told', 'professional', 'trainer', 'why', 'free', 'weights', 'walking', 'are', 'superior', 'static', 'machine', 'exercises', 'act', 'balancing', 'uses', 'many', 'more', 'muscles', 'pumped', 'up', 'big', 'ball', 'dusted', 'off', 'got', 'out', 'sticky', 'mat', 'need', 'one', 'took', 'off', 'shoes', 'put', 'suitable', 'yogi', 'pants', 'soft', 'tee', 'shirt', 'then', 'tested', 'ball', 'DVD', 'instructs', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'right', 'firmness', 'position', 'correctly.Ms', 'Ivanhoe', 'clear', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'filming', 'bright', 'well-positioned', 'easy', 'follow', 'workout', 'was', 'moderately', 'challenging', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'not', 'overly', 'easy', 'felt', 'workout', 'immediately', 'abdominals', 'getting', 'pleasant', 'stretch', 'entire', 'back', 'start', 'series', 'movements', 'position', 'flowing', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'asanas', 'make', 'set', 'exercises', 'first', 'set', 'puppy', 'pose', 'head', 'down', 'back', 'arched', 'inward', 'pyramid', 'pose', 'rather', 'stretching', 'hamstrings', 'working', 'out', 'roll', 'ball', 'down', 'put', 'hands', 'ball', 'rather', 'mat', 'advanced', 'pose', 'might', 'have', 'do', 'A', 'nice', 'back', 'stretch', 'second', 'set', 'used', 'cat', 'pose', 'arching', 'swaying', 'back', 'ending', 'up', 'plank', 'pose', 'lying', 'prone', 'ball', 'using', 'hands', 'support', 'horizontal', 'position', 'use', 'abdominals', 'next', 'set', 'was', 'Salute', 'Sun', 'four', 'more', 'moves', 'Throughout', 'instructor', 'asana', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'important', 'sister', 'key', 'Yoga', 'knowing', 'when', 'breath', 'not', 'always', 'part', 'instructional', 'tape', 'DVD', 'When', 'was', 'done', 'felt', 'abdominals', 'had', 'been', 'worked', 'felt', 'centered', 'aim', 'set', 'yoga', 'exercises.I', 'rate', 'five', 'stars', 'definitely', 'good', 'beginner', 'assuming', 'have', 'health', 'issues', 'must', 'discuss', 'physician', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'started', 'yoga', 'enjoyed', 'moment', 'workout', 'ball']",N/A

In ""On the Ball"" she focuses on core muscle groups by using the ball during yoga postures. This may seem like it would make the postures more difficult and that is the case while doing warrior. While doing downward dog (called puppy dog pose) and cat/cow, the postures are much easier with the ball.During chair pose the ball is held over the head so you are using it more as a weight and this presents a balance challenge. So throughout you are either using the ball as a supporting feature or as a weight. If you have long legs you may find you move the ball out of the way on a few of the standing poses while it becomes more useful when doing pyramid and the final series of stretches.Overall I felt I got a good workout as I could feel the work I'd done on the core muscle groups. The balancing aspects of yoga are slightly enhanced with the ball so you are using more muscles to keep yourself stabilized.

The latter is something I've dabbled with for years but never made much of a commitment to, so when I saw this video combining yoga with the stability ball, I decided to give it a shot.Sara Ivanhoe is a pleasant instructor, cute and positive without being overly perky.  She explains things clearly without dwelling on them, so things move along briskly.  Some of the position names strike me as odd ('puppy dog pose'?) but the modifications in general make sense.  From a beginner's viewpoint, the poses become more doable yet at the same time more challenging, thanks to the addition of the ball.  My only complaint, really, is the music, which is a new age-y sort of trance and which sounds rather cheap.Overall, I really rather enjoy this workout.
