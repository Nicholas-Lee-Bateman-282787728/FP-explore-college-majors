109295,A1NEO06KPX4VCC,0790741660,ADM,"[0, 0]","If you like courtroom dramas or prison movies, this movie will likely hold your interest, even though it is not an exceptional example of either of  those dramas. More compelling is Kevin Bacon's performance as Henry Young,  a petty criminal who was sent to Alcatraz and horribly mistreated  there.The movie follows Young as he suffers through 3 years of solitary  confinement in the &quot;dungeons&quot; of Alcatraz, and them commits a  violent crime in the prison's cafeteria as soon as he is let out of  solitary.He is defended at his trial by a young Harvard-educated lawyer,  adequately played by Christian Slater. Slater's character defends Young by  arguing that Alcatraz and the penal system is responsible for turning Young  from a non-violent person to a violent one, and is therefore to blame for  the murder. In other words, Slater's character &quot;puts the system on  trial&quot;.This main plot is augmented by subplots involving Slater's  relationship with his older brother, and Bacon/Young's relationship with  his sister, both of which go down fairly predictable paths.All in all,  the movie is fairly predictable and occasionally unintentionally funny  because of its over-the-top screenplay, particularly in the courtroom  scenes. For example, R Lee Ermey, who plays the judge overseeing the case,  is continually chiding Slater's character for &quot;skating on thin  ice&quot; -- the two extend this metaphor for about 5 lines of terribly  written dialog.The poor quality of the script, though, is usually  balanced by Bacon's very good performance as the convict, a simple man  jailed for stealing $5 to feed his orphaned sister. Bacon's character draws  the ire of Alcatraz's sinister assistant warden (Gary Oldman) for  participating in an ill-fated escape attempt. It's all downhill for  Bacon/Young after that, as Oldman metes out punishment after inhumane  punishment.So, I would recommend this movie to courtroom drama fans, and  Kevin Bacon fans, but would advise those who are looking for an uplifting  movie to watch on a Saturday night to look elsewhere.Also, since this is  a review of the DVD, I'll just point out that the DVD has no extras (not  even a trailer), the sound quality is adequate, and the video quality is  slightly below average. (You'll notice some aliasing/ghosting in some  poorly lit scenes.)",3,Worth Watching for Kevin Bacon's Performance,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,2345,"['like', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'prison', 'movies', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'hold', 'interest', 'even', 'not', 'exceptional', 'example', 'dramas', 'More', 'compelling', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'Henry', 'Young', 'petty', 'criminal', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'Alcatraz', 'horribly', 'mistreated', 'there.The', 'movie', 'Young', '3', 'years', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'quot', 'dungeons', 'quot', 'Alcatraz', 'violent', 'crime', 'prison', 'cafeteria', 'as', 'soon', 'let', 'solitary.He', 'defended', 'trial', 'young', 'Harvard-educated', 'lawyer', 'adequately', 'played', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Slater', 'character', 'Young', 'arguing', 'Alcatraz', 'penal', 'system', 'responsible', 'turning', 'Young', 'non-violent', 'person', 'violent', 'one', 'therefore', 'blame', 'murder', 'other', 'words', 'Slater', 'character', 'quot', 'system', 'trial', 'quot', 'main', 'plot', 'augmented', 'subplots', 'involving', 'Slater', 'relationship', 'older', 'brother', 'Bacon/Young', 'relationship', 'sister', 'go', 'down', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'paths.All', 'movie', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'occasionally', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'over-the-top', 'screenplay', 'particularly', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'example', 'R', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'who', 'judge', 'overseeing', 'case', 'continually', 'chiding', 'Slater', 'character', 'quot', 'skating', 'thin', 'ice', 'quot', 'two', 'extend', 'metaphor', 'about', '5', 'lines', 'terribly', 'written', 'dialog.The', 'poor', 'quality', 'script', 'usually', 'balanced', 'Bacon', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'convict', 'simple', 'man', 'jailed', 'stealing', '5', 'feed', 'orphaned', 'sister', 'Bacon', 'character', 'ire', 'Alcatraz', 'sinister', 'assistant', 'warden', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'participating', 'ill-fated', 'escape', 'attempt', 'downhill', 'Bacon/Young', 'Oldman', 'out', 'punishment', 'inhumane', 'punishment.So', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'fans', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'fans', 'would', 'advise', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'watch', 'Saturday', 'night', 'look', 'elsewhere.Also', 'review', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'just', 'point', 'out', 'DVD', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'sound', 'quality', 'adequate', 'video', 'quality', 'slightly', 'below', 'average', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'aliasing/ghosting', 'poorly', 'lit', 'scenes']",N/A

109299,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0790741660,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","MURDER IN THE FIRST (USA/France-1995) alleges to be based on true events. Certainly there was a Henri Young, but the facts of his life vary widely from those in the film, which has him a starving 17-year old who stole five bucks from a grocery store that was also a post office, thus  Henri was convicted of a Federal crime. Young in fact was a bank robber who on at least one occasion took hostages. He committed his first murder at age 15 and spent time in two prisons before being transferred to ""the Rock.""There were three survivors of the thwarted Alcatraz escape that Young participated in, not two. He was never held in solitary for years, it was a matter of months, nor did he kill Rufus McCain in front of 200 cafeteria witnesses on the day of his release from ""the Hole,"" it was fully a year later and happened in the tailoring shop. Young didn't die of abuse in 1942 but was shipped from prison to prison, held on that first murder conviction, until he skipped parole in '72 and was never heard from again.Accepting then that the film is a work of pure fiction, it can be examined strictly on its own merits. As entertainment and as a sob story, it works only if one discounts a great deal of overacting. Kevin Bacon as Young is the most egregious scenery-chewer of several. His cartoonish Henri is reminiscent of Dwight Frye's Renfield or Laughton's Hunchback. Bent, hobbled and badly scarred, both physically and emotionally, wild-eyed  Kevin sets a high bar that his fellow hams can't quite clear. Gary Oldman as Asst. Warden Glenn comes mighty close, though.The dangerously sadistic Glenn is unable on the witness stand to secrete his psychotic nature from the jury when Young's attorney James Stamphill (Christian Slater) pokes him with a metaphoric stick of truth. Oldman roars, pours sweat, pops neck veins and appears the monster we've known and hated in previous less-public settings.Glenn's penal superior, absentee Warden James Humson, is portrayed by Stefan Gierasch as having slipped far into senile dementia. Humson doesn't overemote when provoked by Stamphill perhaps only because he can't remember how. Stephen Tobolowsky, aka ""Ned the Head"" inGROUNDHOG DAY(1993), has the unenviable task of playing the chief public defender who, without cause, hates underling Stamphill like a canker. He assigns the untested young attorney to Henri's case solely because it's a ""no-win"" scenario for the defense.Embeth Davidtz as Stamphill's supervisor and soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend has less to do than Kyra Sedgwick's Blanche the hooker, a gift from Stamphill to his cooperative client. (We're supposed to believe that overpainted Kyra is able to service Henri in a holding cell with guards not too far away.)R. Lee Ermey as Judge Clawson steams and bellows down at Stamphill from the bench, clearly no friend of the defendant, only until the trial commences. Then he notches it back to half-power and does a legal 180, sustaining the defense on every point, thereby foiling the prosecutorial plans of District Attorney McNeil (William H. Macy), who in high dudgeon and frustration fogs up his owlish spectacles.Brad Dourif (always nice to see him) is Stamphill's duplicitous older brother, Byron. He too gets one scene to pull out most of the stops. Finally there's Christian Slater's performance. Although matching energy levels with Bacon, Oldman, and Dourif when one-on-one with them, somehow Slater's emotions never become caricature. Our sympathies are always with his Stamphill, and he saves this picture from mediocrity.Despite some bloated acting, MURDER IN THE FIRST, a costumer that's part prison movie/part courtroom drama, is a worthwhile cinematic diversion and recommended.",4,Bacon = HAM,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,3701,"['MURDER', 'IN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'USA/France-1995', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Certainly', 'was', 'Henri', 'Young', 'facts', 'life', 'vary', 'widely', 'film', 'starving', '17-year', 'old', 'who', 'stole', 'five', 'bucks', 'grocery', 'store', 'was', 'also', 'post', 'office', 'thus', 'Henri', 'was', 'convicted', 'Federal', 'crime', 'Young', 'fact', 'was', 'bank', 'robber', 'who', 'least', 'one', 'occasion', 'took', 'hostages', 'committed', 'first', 'murder', 'age', '15', 'spent', 'time', 'two', 'prisons', 'being', 'transferred', 'Rock', 'were', 'three', 'survivors', 'thwarted', 'Alcatraz', 'escape', 'Young', 'participated', 'not', 'two', 'was', 'never', 'held', 'solitary', 'years', 'was', 'matter', 'months', 'did', 'kill', 'Rufus', 'McCain', 'front', '200', 'cafeteria', 'witnesses', 'day', 'release', 'Hole', 'was', 'fully', 'year', 'later', 'happened', 'tailoring', 'shop', 'Young', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'abuse', '1942', 'was', 'shipped', 'prison', 'prison', 'held', 'first', 'murder', 'conviction', 'skipped', 'parole', ""'72"", 'was', 'never', 'heard', 'again.Accepting', 'then', 'film', 'work', 'pure', 'fiction', 'can', 'be', 'examined', 'strictly', 'own', 'merits', 'entertainment', 'sob', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'deal', 'overacting', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Young', 'most', 'egregious', 'scenery-chewer', 'several', 'cartoonish', 'Henri', 'reminiscent', 'Dwight', 'Frye', 'Renfield', 'Laughton', 'Hunchback', 'Bent', 'hobbled', 'badly', 'scarred', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'wild-eyed', 'Kevin', 'high', 'bar', 'fellow', 'hams', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'clear', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Asst', 'Warden', 'Glenn', 'mighty', 'close', 'dangerously', 'sadistic', 'Glenn', 'unable', 'witness', 'stand', 'secrete', 'psychotic', 'nature', 'jury', 'when', 'Young', 'attorney', 'James', 'Stamphill', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'metaphoric', 'stick', 'truth', 'Oldman', 'sweat', 'neck', 'veins', 'monster', ""'ve"", 'known', 'hated', 'previous', 'less-public', 'settings.Glenn', 'penal', 'superior', 'absentee', 'Warden', 'James', 'Humson', 'portrayed', 'Stefan', 'Gierasch', 'having', 'slipped', 'far', 'senile', 'dementia', 'Humson', ""n't"", 'overemote', 'when', 'provoked', 'Stamphill', 'perhaps', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'Stephen', 'Tobolowsky', 'Ned', 'Head', 'inGROUNDHOG', 'DAY', '1993', 'unenviable', 'task', 'playing', 'chief', 'public', 'defender', 'who', 'cause', 'underling', 'Stamphill', 'canker', 'untested', 'young', 'attorney', 'Henri', 'case', 'solely', 'no-win', 'scenario', 'defense.Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'Stamphill', 'supervisor', 'soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend', 'less', 'do', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Blanche', 'hooker', 'gift', 'Stamphill', 'cooperative', 'client', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'overpainted', 'Kyra', 'able', 'service', 'Henri', 'holding', 'cell', 'guards', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'away.', 'R', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Judge', 'Clawson', 'steams', 'down', 'Stamphill', 'bench', 'clearly', 'friend', 'defendant', 'only', 'trial', 'commences', 'Then', 'back', 'half-power', 'legal', '180', 'sustaining', 'defense', 'point', 'thereby', 'foiling', 'prosecutorial', 'plans', 'District', 'Attorney', 'McNeil', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'high', 'dudgeon', 'frustration', 'fogs', 'up', 'owlish', 'spectacles.Brad', 'Dourif', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Stamphill', 'duplicitous', 'older', 'brother', 'Byron', 'too', 'one', 'scene', 'pull', 'out', 'most', 'stops', 'Finally', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'performance', 'matching', 'energy', 'levels', 'Bacon', 'Oldman', 'Dourif', 'when', 'one-on-one', 'somehow', 'Slater', 'emotions', 'never', 'become', 'caricature', 'sympathies', 'are', 'always', 'Stamphill', 'picture', 'mediocrity.Despite', 'bloated', 'acting', 'MURDER', 'IN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'costumer', 'part', 'prison', 'movie/part', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'worthwhile', 'cinematic', 'diversion', 'recommended']",N/A

109301,A1MIJKZQ1MIRBM,0790741660,C. Law,"[2, 3]","MURDER IN THE FIRST begins just as an escape attempt from the maximum-security federal penitentiary at Alcatraz has failed. Two escapees are dead, a third  (the informant) is returned to his cell, and a fourth, a young man named Henri Young (Kevin Bacon), is placed into a dingy, black hole underneath the ground. He remains there for three years, only visited by Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and his vicious beatings and a spider that knows a way out.Once he is released, Young is placed back into the prison population. With revenge consuming him, he lashes out at the informant who was responsible for landing him in confinement by running a spoon through the man's throat. Unknowing of the treatment that transformed Young from petty thief to cold-blooded killer, the government tries Young for first degree murder. Enter Christian Slater who stars as James Stamphill, an up and coming public defender who is assigned to defend Henry Young and maybe the only person in Young's life who doesn't want to just give up on the man.While how much of the story is actually true and how much of the story has been created by Hollywood is in question, there's no doubt that MURDER IN THE FIRST is entertaining. While most of the things about Henry Young are true, I understand that some liabilities have been made with the characters played by Christian Slater and Gary Oldman. That shouldn't matter though. They are not the heart of the story. Henry Young is at the heart of the story and the fact that any of this ever happened to a man is horrific and makes it a story deserving to be told. And even if all of this had never truly happened (I wish it hadn't), and the story was a complete work of fiction by a Hollywood screenwriter it will still be a good movie and an involving look into the human psyche.For his performance as Henry Young, Kevin Bacon should have been nominated for an Academy Award. With his haunting eyes and his unhealthy appearing weight loss alone, Bacon makes us care for the character. His performance is flawless. Christian Slater does also does well in one of the finer acting choices of his career (aside from TRUE ROMANCE and INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE). His Slaterism's are often subdued for a more relaxed, more innocent man approach, which works rather well. Gary Oldman, who I would go as far as to say is the most underrated actor in Hollywood, gives another great, over the top performance which to me comes as no surprise. I've never seen Gary Oldman once seem like the same man in anything he's ever been in. That' s got to say something for his talents.With great performances and an endearing story, MURDER IN THE FIRST is a first-rate film. And, despite its title, it's not about a murder. It's about life.Maybe I'm a simpleton but I liked it.B+",4,A first-rate film!,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,2793,"['MURDER', 'IN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'just', 'escape', 'attempt', 'maximum-security', 'federal', 'penitentiary', 'Alcatraz', 'failed', 'Two', 'escapees', 'are', 'dead', 'third', 'informant', 'returned', 'cell', 'fourth', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Henri', 'Young', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'placed', 'dingy', 'black', 'hole', 'ground', 'three', 'years', 'only', 'visited', 'Associate', 'Warden', 'Glenn', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'vicious', 'beatings', 'spider', 'way', 'out.Once', 'released', 'Young', 'placed', 'back', 'prison', 'population', 'revenge', 'consuming', 'out', 'informant', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'landing', 'confinement', 'running', 'spoon', 'man', 'throat', 'Unknowing', 'treatment', 'transformed', 'Young', 'petty', 'thief', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'government', 'Young', 'first', 'degree', 'murder', 'Enter', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'James', 'Stamphill', 'up', 'coming', 'public', 'defender', 'who', 'assigned', 'defend', 'Henry', 'Young', 'maybe', 'only', 'person', 'Young', 'life', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'man.While', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'actually', 'true', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'been', 'created', 'Hollywood', 'question', 'doubt', 'MURDER', 'IN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'entertaining', 'most', 'things', 'Henry', 'Young', 'are', 'true', 'understand', 'liabilities', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'characters', 'played', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'are', 'not', 'heart', 'story', 'Henry', 'Young', 'heart', 'story', 'fact', 'ever', 'happened', 'man', 'horrific', 'story', 'deserving', 'be', 'told', 'even', 'had', 'never', 'truly', 'happened', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'story', 'was', 'complete', 'work', 'fiction', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'involving', 'look', 'human', 'performance', 'Henry', 'Young', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'haunting', 'eyes', 'unhealthy', 'appearing', 'weight', 'loss', 'alone', 'Bacon', 'care', 'character', 'performance', 'flawless', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'also', 'well', 'one', 'finer', 'acting', 'choices', 'career', 'TRUE', 'ROMANCE', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'Slaterism', 'are', 'often', 'subdued', 'more', 'relaxed', 'more', 'innocent', 'man', 'approach', 'rather', 'well', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'most', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'top', 'performance', 'surprise', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'once', 'seem', 'same', 'man', 'anything', 'ever', 'been', 's', 'got', 'say', 'something', 'talents.With', 'great', 'performances', 'endearing', 'story', 'MURDER', 'IN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'first-rate', 'film', 'title', 'not', 'murder', 'life.Maybe', ""'m"", 'simpleton', 'liked', 'it.B+']",N/A

109305,AE12AEJFCOGGY,0790741660,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[3, 13]","[I actually give this film a rating of **1/2]Man's inhumanity against man is one of the most powerful themes in drama.  It is the subject that drives &quot;Murder in the First Degree,&quot; a film (supposedly based on  real events) that tells the horrifying tale of Henry Young (Kevin Bacon), a  man sent to Alcatraz for stealing five dollars.While serving his time on  the Rock, Henry suffers greatly at the hands of the sadistic Assistant  Warden (Gary Oldman.)  He is tortured, beaten, abused and kept in solitary  confinement for three years.  When he is finally reintroduced into the  general prison population, Henry is so confused and frightened that he  does, for him, the unthinkable: he murders another inmate.Everyone is  set for a quick trial (to be followed by an even quicker execution) until  Henry's defense attorney, James Stampill (Christian Slater), comes on the  scene.  He is ready to fight and he will do whatever it takes, even if it  means taking on Alcatraz and the entire penal system.The plot of  &quot;Murder&quot; is by no means a new one, nor is it even remotely  unpredictable.  At every turn, the savvy movie viewer will know what is  coming next, even if the characters in the film do not.  (The sequence with  Stampill and the former prison guard is particularly weak.  If he is so  smart, how could he not have seen that coming?)  The courtroom scenes are  okay except when Stampill engages in implausible bouts of  histrionics.All the same, predictability on its own will not necessarily  ruin a film.  What makes &quot;Murder&quot; watchable are some good  performances and Marc Rocco's direction.  Prior to this, Rocco directed a  few perfectly dreadful films, including &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot;  and &quot;Where the Day Takes You.&quot;  Here, though, his work is much  better.  His attempts at imposing a visual style are occasionally  obtrusive, but he makes it work often enough to keep things  interesting.The acting by the three principals is fine.  Slater is good,  although he is too young and inexperienced to give his role the weight it  needs.  (Please don't try to argue that that is the point, either.  I don't  buy it.)  Bacon does well in the showier part, giving a nicely modulated  performance.  Oldman has a tendency to go over the top (see &quot;The  Professional,&quot; for example), but here he is more restrained and his  work is better because of it.  He also does a perfect job of suppressing  his British accent.The main problem with &quot;Murder&quot; is Dan  Gordon's writing, which never rises above the merely ordinary.  The plot is  familiar, many of the scenes are clich&eacute; and the characterizations are weak.  The screenplay is certainly adequate, but that is not enough to make a  good film.",2,"Sad, But Not Particularly Gripping",960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,2775,"['[', 'actually', 'give', 'film', 'rating', '**1/2', ']', 'Man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'themes', 'drama', 'subject', 'quot', 'Murder', 'First', 'Degree', 'quot', 'film', 'supposedly', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'horrifying', 'tale', 'Henry', 'Young', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'man', 'sent', 'Alcatraz', 'stealing', 'five', 'dollars.While', 'serving', 'time', 'Rock', 'Henry', 'greatly', 'hands', 'sadistic', 'Assistant', 'Warden', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'tortured', 'beaten', 'abused', 'kept', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'three', 'years', 'When', 'finally', 'reintroduced', 'general', 'prison', 'population', 'Henry', 'so', 'confused', 'frightened', 'unthinkable', 'inmate.Everyone', 'set', 'quick', 'trial', 'be', 'followed', 'even', 'quicker', 'execution', 'Henry', 'defense', 'attorney', 'James', 'Stampill', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'scene', 'ready', 'fight', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'even', 'taking', 'Alcatraz', 'entire', 'penal', 'system.The', 'plot', 'quot', 'Murder', 'quot', 'means', 'new', 'one', 'even', 'remotely', 'unpredictable', 'turn', 'savvy', 'movie', 'viewer', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'even', 'characters', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'sequence', 'Stampill', 'former', 'prison', 'guard', 'particularly', 'weak', 'so', 'smart', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'okay', 'when', 'Stampill', 'implausible', 'bouts', 'same', 'predictability', 'own', 'will', 'not', 'necessarily', 'ruin', 'film', 'What', 'quot', 'Murder', 'quot', 'watchable', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'Marc', 'Rocco', 'direction', 'Prior', 'Rocco', 'directed', 'few', 'perfectly', 'dreadful', 'films', 'including', 'quot', 'Dream', 'Little', 'Dream', 'quot', 'quot', 'Where', 'Day', 'Takes', 'You.', 'quot', 'Here', 'though', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'attempts', 'imposing', 'visual', 'style', 'are', 'occasionally', 'obtrusive', 'work', 'often', 'enough', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting.The', 'acting', 'three', 'principals', 'fine', 'Slater', 'good', 'too', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'give', 'role', 'weight', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'argue', 'point', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Bacon', 'well', 'showier', 'part', 'giving', 'nicely', 'modulated', 'performance', 'Oldman', 'tendency', 'go', 'top', 'see', 'quot', 'Professional', 'quot', 'example', 'here', 'more', 'restrained', 'work', 'better', 'also', 'perfect', 'job', 'suppressing', 'British', 'accent.The', 'main', 'problem', 'quot', 'Murder', 'quot', 'Dan', 'Gordon', 'writing', 'never', 'merely', 'ordinary', 'plot', 'familiar', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characterizations', 'are', 'weak', 'screenplay', 'certainly', 'adequate', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'film']",N/A
109306,A1FDW1SPYKB354,0790741660,David Von Pein,"[4, 4]","Based on true-life events, &#34;Murder In The First&#34; premiered in U.S. movie theaters in January 1995 and stars Kevin Bacon as Henri Young, a 28-year-old man who (as depicted in the film) stole five dollars and ended up doing 3-plus years in the solitary &#34;dungeons&#34; of Alcatraz prison in San Francisco in the late 1930s and early 1940s.Upon looking up some information on the Internet regarding the &#34;real&#34; Henri Young, it seems that the filmmakers of this finely-crafted and well-shot Warner Brothers' drama did, indeed, dish up a liberal dose of &#34;dramatic license&#34; regarding the true events in Mr. Young's life. But, I suppose, this is to be expected from a Hollywood story depicting real-life people and events.One thing that's been fictionalized for the movie is the brief scene when we find out that Young died while still behind Alcatraz bars. It's never fully explained in the film just exactly HOW Young died while still in prison. I think this should have been more thoroughly spelled out in the movie (even from a &#34;fictionalized&#34; point-of-view).Evidently, according to info I can gather, Young did NOT die while in prison, and, in fact, might still be alive to this day. Young disappeared after being paroled from a Washington State prison in 1972, after serving additional prison time for another murder.  (Sounds like another &#34;D.B. Cooper&#34; type of saga.)&#34;Artistic filmmaking license&#34; notwithstanding, &#34;Murder In The First&#34; is an excellent piece of motion-picture entertainment, IMO. Bacon is just terrific in his role as the beaten, nearly-savage Young, who was confined to the pitch-black solitary confinement area of Alcatraz for more than 1,000 days before finally being released from the &#34;dungeon&#34;.Gary Oldman and Christian Slater also display their considerable acting chops in this film, along with R. Lee Ermey, who plays the Judge at Young's murder trial. You'll want to slap Ermey silly after a few scenes as the obnoxious &#34;Judge Clawson&#34; here. He's quite effective and humorous (although not altogether believable) as the rather overbearing chief court official.This film has a classy style to it, with many interesting camera angles and camera movements employed by the movie's brain trust, headed by Director Marc Rocco. I particularly liked the way Rocco moves the camera in circles during the first scene featuring Slater and Bacon, with the camera moving non-stop as it circles completely around Bacon's/(Young's) jail cell. An effective way to present this scene, rather than just &#34;planting&#34; two cameras in the cell and cutting between still shots of the two actors.This DVD version of &#34;Murder In The First&#34; offers up a dual-sided disc, with a Full-Frame (1.33:1) version on one side, and a nice, crisp-looking Anamorphically-enhanced Widescreen (1.85:1) version on the other side.  Colors look rich and well-rendered here, IMO, with many scenes exuding a deliberately-grainier &#34;1940's&#34; look and feel to them.The sound gets good marks here too. It's not a full-blooded 5.1-channel track utilized for this DVD, but the Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Stereo soundtrack fills the speakers very nicely nonetheless.  There's a good musical score too.More about this DVD ....................&#62;&#62; Extra Bonus Material -- None at all.&#62;&#62; Chapter List? -- Yes; located inside the &#34;Snapper&#34; DVD case (38 total chapter stops included).&#62;&#62; Languages -- English and French (both in DD 2.0 Surround).&#62;&#62; Subtitles -- English and French.&#62;&#62; Region Encoding -- &#34;Region 1&#34;.&#62;&#62; MPAA Rating -- R.Parting Thoughts ....... 1995's &#34;Murder In The First&#34; is a Grade-A motion picture, serving nicely as a good character study of one Mr. Henri Young, and at the same time doubling as a dandy &#34;courtroom drama&#34;, too.

With an uncannily natural affinity for Henri, Bacon finds his way into the marrow of this tortured, downtrodden prisoner. In what could have too easily turned into a over-the-top ""Look, Ma, I'm acting!"" role, Bacon strikes a balance that is unique and rare. Unafraid of any aspect of Henri it becomes a performance nothing less than astonishing in its honesty.The first 20 minutes presents us with the naked, filthy animal the system wishes to portray him as Henri. Yet, even here, with little more than a mad scene comprised of grunts, screams and incoherent mumblings about baseball, multiplication tables and The Lord's Prayer, Bacon makes Henri shine beneath the hair and grime introducing us to a pitiable sorrowful man not only wronged by the system, but utterly destroyed then forgotten by it. This is one of those rare performances where the work outshines the actor - I'd forgotten entirely I was even watching an actor.It's a hard heart that will not be moved by Henri and Bacon should look back at this performance with nothing but pride. (The fact he was not nominated for an Oscar is astonishing as his performance.)Christian Slater gives one of his best performances as well and Gary Oldman is, (predictably) wonderfully evil as is William H.

109315,A328S9RN3U5M68,0790741660,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the `veracity' of the allegedly true story.According to the reported facts, `Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.'  Those are the `facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows:Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz.Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level.

Fellow actors Gary Oldman, William H. Macy, and especially Christian Slater, also turn in fine performances.As a courtroom drama, there are few movies that can compete with this one. Slater, as Bacon's defense attorney, must triumph over what seem like insurmountable odds: everything from his own boss, colleagues, the prison system, the government, and even his own older brother (played by talented actor Brad Douriff), is against him. But in the end he wins the case despite the formidable forces arrayed against him.You should be aware that the movie takes considerable license with the facts, however. In the movie, Bacon's character is said to be just a petty criminal whose punishment far exceeded his crime by having to spend 1000 days in solitary, and that it was the brutal conditions in Alcatraz that caused him to commit the subsequent murder. In fact. Henry Young (the criminal), was a career criminal and sociopath who had a long history of crime, had already murdered one person, and brutalized another hostage after a bank robbery. He later committed another murder while in prison. So he was not a sympathetic person at all in real life.Also in the movie, the warden is said to be warden over three prisons, only visiting The Rock 24 times in three years, and so couldn't know what the conditions were like. In fact, there has never been a warden who ran more than one prison.

Many of us were dressed in clothes of the 1930s and 1940s.  I was not an actor, never wanted to be, and never had the talent to be.  But I was out of work and being an extra helped bring in some cash.  A woman who lived in my apartment building was also standing with me, and I discovered quickly the difference between myself and a shark.  Earlier in the day, she had gone through a professional hairstylist and got the makeup done, then a fancy 1930s dress.  We were standing together in the line, talking, but as soon as the casting people came closer, she transformed into one of those people you see in movies who will do anything for her career, including stomping you under foot.  hissed at me to pretend I didn't know her, though I had gone with her to the hairdresser and to the audition, and she did everything she could do to draw their attention.  As it turned out, we both got hired.Though the film was set in San Francisco, they shot the courtroom interiors in a warehouse in Sylmar, California.  Day scenes were filmed at all times of the actual day thanks to the world of make-believe sun lighting on the ""windows"" of the ""courtroom.""  I was assigned the role of a news photographer (there were about a dozen of us, but I think I was the only one who had a tripod camera...and you can see me in a few scenes, either with my bald head or a hat -- gad, I looked so young 17 years ago...sigh).  (The young woman I mentioned earlier was cast as one of the people in the balcony watching the trial.  Her overwhelming ambition drove her to asking a PA to move her downstairs to the main viewing area so she would be onscreen more.  I think she also tried to get lines.  The last I saw if her she was flirting with a member of the lighting crew.  She was no longer on the set by the second day.)Anyway, the various courtroom sequences were mostly starring Kevin Bacon and Christian Slater, as prisoner and lawyer, respectively.  When you watch the movie, you will notice that each scene has dozens of angles.  The director would shoot it with one camera (as I recall), and do what-seemed-like a neverending series of setups to cover every angle.  I thought I would go mad doing the same scene over and over and over, in new angle after new angle after new angle.  You've never seen anyone get as much coverage as he did. (And that set was hot...plus the fact that smoking cigars and cigarettes by the reporters was required.  I was surrounded by cigar smokers even when we were between takes.  It got to be a health issue and cigarettes and cigars were extinguished at the end of a take, and then re-lit before the camera rolled.)Until I rewatched this movie tonight, I forgot that William H. Macy played the opposing attorney.  He wasn't really a name then, I believe, and so I never paid much attention to him.  I regret that now.  I do remember wandering around the set and glancing at his desk and seeing grisly crime photos.The scene with the warden on the witness stand was an ordeal for all involved because the actor who played him, Stefan Gierasch, blew his lines on every take.  It finally got to the point where his lines were written on cue cards placed to the side of the camera.I was there for the courtroom scenes once the trial has started, and out of all them, I recall the ones with Gary Oldman as a sadistic Alcatraz official and the one with Bacon on the witness stand the best.  Oldman generated pure evil.  And Bacon was brilliant throughout the film, but especially in this key scene.  When you see those tears that roll down his face, that wasn't movie magic.  I was there and they were real, believe me.  (By the way, between takes, the Kevin Bacon you and I know would come out.  One particular moment I remember was when spouse Kyra Sedgwick, who had a cameo in the film as a prostitute, visited the set with their two children.  They were very happy but  I seem to recall one of the children was disturbed seeing Bacon in the scar makeup and that he was in leg shackles.) (My memory of Christian Slater between setups was him leaving the set, accompanied by his huge bodyguard.)Then came the night of January 16th, 1994.  We were on a very late shift.  They would usually work us about ten or more hours in a shift - though for the extras, we spent much of it in sitting in another building, dozing off, or playing a game, reading, or just making friends - so some days we would be there long hours, but by law be required to have several hours off before the next work period.  As it happened, we were working this particular night late, on into January 17th.  We were on the set.  A long time.  Finally, around 4:30 AM, we were told to take a break.  We proceeded off the set and as we were just about to leave the warehouse, I felt myself losing my balance.  I thought i was just dizzy for a moment.  Then I heard something on the set crashing.  The lights flickered and we were told to get out of the building as quickly as possible.  The ground was shaking.  We were in the middle of an earthquake.  A very violent one.  The Northridge Earthquake, as it would become known.  We were only about a dozen miles from its epicenter and I'll tell you something...though an earthquake may only shake for about 30 seconds, it will seem like the longest time of your life.  People were injured, some with bloody arms or legs, some people in shock.  We were instructed to get away from the building and lay by the sidewalk at the street.  I was lucky and only had a slight bruise or so and was able to escape the panic of the moment by trying to help people who were injured.  We had to remain there until the sun came up.  When the sun did arise, we could see black smoke rising high over different areas of Los Angeles.The filming was put in hold.  I think the set had been destroyed by the quake.  When the company resumed filming, it was done entirely in SF.And so that is why I look at this film differently than the average person.As to the Blu-ray...the video is only so-so.  It never gets in for serious ""this-is-what-HD-is-about"".Audio is good.Extras are only a 12-minute revisit by Kevin Bacon, which is informative.Overall, recommended for the story.",4,A personal

109328,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,0790741660,Movie Fan,"[2, 2]","Oh well, but yet here is another underrated movie with great acting, a sad true story, and no appreciation. This movie MURDER IN THE FIRST is alot like midnight express, in both true stories, both men were charged for something not very serious. It's an issue that has never been corrected. I know how messed up systems can be, and i'm not saying let the petty criminals all go, but even if they do break the law over something small, why give them such a harsh sentence? It makes me sick that these guys are in prison for 10-15 years for stealing pencils, and 5 bucks, and carrying marajauina. And yet the rapists and child molesters and murderers get 3-5 years. It makes no sense! Both men in both movies had breakdowns while in prison. Who wouldnt, so they both attack an inmate, it's like hello wake up. When you have a breakdown whatever you do you are so from reality and not enough people understand the mental effect prison can have on your mental health. It's the worst punishment of all. I'm against over-sentencing on non violent criminals. People who harm people, children, and animals, people who are a real threat to society should be locked up for 10-15 years, not peopple like the guy in this story who stole money for his hungry sister, and just because of the building being federal AND no longer a convenient store is ludacrous and absurd. And these sadistic arrogant SOB's that call themselves wardens shouldnt even be in charge of the prisons if they are going to torture and cut people's ankles open. They shouldnt get away with that. There's no excuse for that. This movie is a sad reality that if you put power into the wrong hands, they'll do horrible things. Much like the SOB warden in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION another excellent film. Probably the best because i like the ending. Well both endings are similar in midnight express and shawshank redemption. But murder in the first is sad because kevin bacon dies. I'm not sure i believe he got the justice he deserved.

109333,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,0790741660,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[3, 5]","Movie Summary: Henri Young was caught stealing $5 to feed is little sister and ended up in prison on Alcatraz Island. Years later he is caught trying to escape. For this he incurs the wrath of the Associate warden. Henri is put into solitary confinement for over 3 years. He is savagely beaten and tortured during this time. When he is finally released back into the prison's general population he is barely human. At the prompting of another inmate, Henri attacks and kills the stool pigeon who ratted on the escape attempt and caused Henri to have to spend 3 years in the hole. Now Henri is accused of Murder in the First Degree and facing the death penalty. It's an open and shut case, a sure loser, so they give it to James Stamphill, a green lawyer fresh out of school, as a practice case. But there is one thing they didn't count on, that James would actually try to win.My Opinion: I had seen the trailer for Murder in the First on many other DVDs and finally got around to seeing it. The story takes place in the 1930s and I like this period of American history, so it is not surprising that I enjoyed the movie very much despite its purported &quot;flaws&quot;. One of the things that has been called a flaw is that it is only loosely based on a true story. This seems to bother some people. The real Henri Young was not so nice a guy and the prison Warden not so bad a guy. But we have to remember that this is a movie, made for entertainment purposes. Had they made a documentary instead, it would not have been nearly as entertaining. I don't consider this a flaw. The other weak point that people have brought up are the courtroom scenes. I enjoyed these but others have called them silly and contrived. They are not up to the realistic standards of show like Law and Order, but they are not that bad either. I did notice however that the DA did not cross examine Henri which seemed strange. These &quot;flaws&quot; or weaknesses fade into the background however if you catch onto the main themes which are friendship and freedom. I enjoyed these parts of the movie the most. To see how different things were important to Henri and James was very interesting. To James it started out as just a case he had to win. To Henri it was a chance to have a friend for the first time in his life. In the end they share both. As for the acting, I thought both Slater and Bacon were excellent. I forgot at times that it was Kevin Bacon and saw him as Henri. For a star as highly recognizable as Kevin Bacon, I think this is a big compliment.DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 (not 2.35:1 as listed) and full screen, DD2.0. Good picture quality. No extra features what so ever.What You Should Do:  See it if you like Court Room dramas. Christian Slater and Kevin Bacon both give great performances which are worth seeing. This is a very low priced DVD so it doesn't cost much more to buy than to rent so that is an option as well.Related Movies To Check Out: True Crime, The Untouchables, To Kill a Mocking Bird",4,Action - Reaction,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,3019,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Henri', 'Young', 'was', 'caught', 'stealing', '5', 'feed', 'little', 'sister', 'ended', 'up', 'prison', 'Alcatraz', 'Island', 'Years', 'later', 'caught', 'trying', 'escape', 'wrath', 'Associate', 'warden', 'Henri', 'put', 'solitary', 'confinement', '3', 'years', 'savagely', 'beaten', 'tortured', 'time', 'When', 'finally', 'released', 'back', 'prison', 'general', 'population', 'barely', 'human', 'prompting', 'inmate', 'Henri', 'attacks', 'stool', 'pigeon', 'who', 'ratted', 'escape', 'attempt', 'caused', 'Henri', 'have', 'spend', '3', 'years', 'hole', 'Now', 'Henri', 'accused', 'Murder', 'First', 'Degree', 'facing', 'death', 'penalty', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'sure', 'loser', 'give', 'James', 'Stamphill', 'green', 'lawyer', 'fresh', 'school', 'practice', 'case', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'James', 'would', 'actually', 'try', 'win.My', 'Opinion', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'Murder', 'First', 'many', 'other', 'DVDs', 'finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'story', 'place', '1930s', 'like', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'not', 'surprising', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'purported', 'quot', 'quot', 'One', 'things', 'been', 'called', 'flaw', 'only', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'bother', 'people', 'real', 'Henri', 'Young', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'nice', 'guy', 'prison', 'Warden', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'guy', 'have', 'remember', 'movie', 'made', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'Had', 'made', 'documentary', 'instead', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'flaw', 'other', 'weak', 'point', 'people', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'are', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'enjoyed', 'others', 'have', 'called', 'silly', 'contrived', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'standards', 'show', 'Law', 'Order', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'did', 'notice', 'however', 'DA', 'did', 'not', 'cross', 'examine', 'Henri', 'seemed', 'strange', 'quot', 'quot', 'fade', 'background', 'however', 'catch', 'main', 'themes', 'are', 'friendship', 'freedom', 'enjoyed', 'parts', 'movie', 'most', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'things', 'were', 'important', 'Henri', 'James', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'James', 'started', 'out', 'as', 'just', 'case', 'had', 'win', 'Henri', 'was', 'chance', 'have', 'friend', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'end', 'share', 'acting', 'thought', 'Slater', 'Bacon', 'were', 'excellent', 'forgot', 'times', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'saw', 'Henri', 'star', 'highly', 'recognizable', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'think', 'big', 'compliment.DVD', 'Quality', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'not', '2.35:1', 'listed', 'full', 'screen', 'DD2.0', 'Good', 'picture', 'quality', 'extra', 'features', 'what', 'so', 'ever.What', 'Should', 'Do', 'See', 'like', 'Court', 'Room', 'dramas', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'very', 'low', 'priced', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'cost', 'much', 'more', 'buy', 'rent', 'so', 'that', 'option', 'well.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'True', 'Crime', 'Untouchables', 'Kill', 'Mocking', 'Bird']",N/A

109335,A2584EDFG5FLGM,0790741660,"Simon Yap ""Simepro""","[2, 3]","This is easily Kevin Bacon's finest. His performance is Oscar worthy. This film inspired me when I was a young legal student. It had been sometime since I have seen the movie. A friend of mine had borrowed the movie and kept it for a good year. I had first bought this movie via a laser disc. Thereafter when the DVD came out, I paid over US 25 for it.Here the performances are solid. I am sure many have written about how great the movie it. As such the purpose of my review is to focus what this show means to me. This movie explores the importance of the client solicitor relationship. The show begins with Young being very alienated to Slater's character. This is shown by the director's careful photography angles. It somehow seems to convey that one has to enter into someone's prison to get another out. It cleverly shows that not only Young was in prison but Slater's character also. This is clearly pointed out when he (the lawyer) chose to enter his (Young) cell. It cleverly shows that he was a slave to the legal system and to the footsteps of his brother brilliant played as always by Douriff.It was clearly a battle that not only Young had to fight but one that Stamphill had to fight as well. Hence trust had to be developed. The story captures a solicitor's need to win his clients confidence. It also deals with situations when the client's instructions are clearly against his advice.My favourite scene is when the judge reprimanded Young and said; ""This is my court. I am the one who says whether is OK or not OK"". Then staring at Young he asks ""OK?"" Now that is brilliant. Well done, Marc Rocco. You have won a fan.

109336,AL277B4AQCWBG,0790741660,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 3]","The tagline tells us this is the story of the trial that closed down Alcatraz, and the first twenty minutes of Dan Gordon's screenplay tell us precisely why: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) was illegally kept in solitary confinement for over three years, and during that time was regularly brutalized by the prison warden (Gary Oldman). Consequently, the story of how his lawyer, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), discovers and proves these events is drained of most of its excitement - we know exactly where it's heading, and what the final outcome will be when it gets there. It might have been more engaging if the audience, like Stamphill, was simply presented with an apparently deranged petty-thief-turned-murderer, and had to uncover gradually the institutionalized brutality which unhinged him (a structure more like 'A Few Good Men' where the dramatic revelation about what really happened is only made at the climax). As it stands, this film is nicely put together but a little dull. The characters are interesting, though, and the emerging friendship between Henri and his lawyer almost makes up for the predictability of the plot. Slater and Oldman do well, as usual (though the script doesn't give either of them much scope), and Bacon delivers the most physically committed performance of his career - but it's still no Oscar winner.",3,Let down by story structure,1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,1343,"['tagline', 'story', 'trial', 'closed', 'down', 'Alcatraz', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Dan', 'Gordon', 'screenplay', 'tell', 'precisely', 'why', 'Henri', 'Young', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'illegally', 'kept', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'three', 'years', 'time', 'was', 'regularly', 'brutalized', 'prison', 'warden', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Consequently', 'story', 'how', 'lawyer', 'James', 'Stamphill', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'discovers', 'events', 'drained', 'most', 'excitement', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'heading', 'what', 'final', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'when', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'engaging', 'audience', 'Stamphill', 'was', 'simply', 'presented', 'apparently', 'deranged', 'petty-thief-turned-murderer', 'had', 'uncover', 'gradually', 'institutionalized', 'brutality', 'unhinged', 'structure', 'more', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'where', 'dramatic', 'revelation', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'only', 'made', 'climax', 'film', 'nicely', 'put', 'together', 'little', 'dull', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'though', 'emerging', 'friendship', 'Henri', 'lawyer', 'almost', 'up', 'predictability', 'plot', 'Slater', 'Oldman', 'do', 'well', 'usual', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'scope', 'Bacon', 'most', 'physically', 'committed', 'performance', 'career', 'still', 'Oscar', 'winner']",N/A

He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn, the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill, is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz.  I think this is clearly Kevin Bacon's best performance in this movie.  A truly emotional movie that ranks among the top Alcatraz movies made. Gary Oldman also puts in a very solid performance. Christian Slater plays a youthful, inexperienced attorney to perfection.

As always, Michael Douglas was outstanding in ""A Perfect Murder"" and the performances of Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen were excellent. Such a great screenplay and with a number of twists in the plot.  If you like action, suspense, crime movies, murder mysteries, revenge with the bad guy finally tripping himself up and being caught by a very intelligent detective you will love it.In ""Murder by Numbers"" Sandra Bullock was both the main star and one of the Executive Producers and this was a perfect vehicle to showcase her abilities as an actress--which is why I think she selected it.  The two young male actors were so believable as the privileged, bright and bored amoral teens who believed they were smarter than anyone else and could plan and execute the perfect murder and get away with it.  Sandra Bullock was the police detective who was both psychologically and physically scared by a vicious attack years earlier but which still haunted her and which she tried to suppress but which still had power over her.  Great screenwriting, directing, casting in addition to the acting which was excellent.  If you enjoy suspense, detective stories, action and a number of twists in the plot you will be hooked from the start.  Hint:  everything in the movie is there for a reason although it may be later in the film when the audience understands the significance of what they had seen previously.""Murder in the First"" is supposedly based on a true story the same as ""Murder by Numbers"" and I don't usually like movies about prisons and prisoners who may be sentenced to the death penalty. The acting by Kevin Bacon who played Henry the teen sent to prison for stealing $5 and who ended up spending three years in solitary confinement and being tortured for an attempted escape from Alcatraz was fantastic. Gary Oldman played the Associate Warden of Alcatraz who was a sadist and felt he could do anything he wanted to the prisoners and who actually ran the prison on a day-to-day basis.  Both of these actors turned in academy award quality performances and I found myself completely engrossed in this movie (much to my surprise).
