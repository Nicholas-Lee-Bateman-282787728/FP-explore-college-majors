So when I saw this on dvd, I had to get it for my kids.  It teaches selfishness and generosity and doing the right thing.  Neat story.  ""Old version"" type of clamation but that's not a problem whatsoever.  Great dvd to add to your collection.",5,Great story for kids,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,459,"['remember', 'seeing', 'PBS', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'then', 'older', 'kid', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'show', 'anymore', 'missed', 'show', 'forgot', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'had', 'whole', 'bunch', 'neat', 'stories', 'clamation', 'when', 'saw', 'dvd', 'had', 'get', 'kids', 'selfishness', 'generosity', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Neat', 'story', 'Old', 'version', 'type', 'clamation', 'not', 'problem', 'whatsoever', 'Great', 'dvd', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Having raised 4, I just feel that children need every opportunity to revel and thrive in their innocence before the bedlam of cable & internet invades upon them. so if you have impressionable little ones scurrying around I highly recommend this gentle fable.Refreshingly subtle, yet still morally aware, this is the story of a Russian Tsar who issues a challenge for the hand of his daughter Princess Alexya, the foolish peasant boy Pyotr who answers the call, and the incidental band of talented merry-misfits who accompany his quest.You have adventure, romance, friendship, trust, compassion, and good vs. wicked all bundled together with wonderful humor. This Emmy Award winning animated tale, narrated by David Suchet, is an early tale of super-heroes, a fellowship of seven, who wield the forces of ice, wood, kindness, thirst, sight, sound, and last but not least...appetite, to thwart all obstacles they encounter.Wonderful little story !",5,"""Long Ago & Far Away""",1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1110,"['can', 'not', 'think', 'better', 'way', 'entitle', 'review', 'cite', 'WGBH', 'program', 'first', 'introduced', 'heart-warming', 'Russian', 'fairy', 'tale', '2', 'decades', 'ago', 'Having', 'raised', '4', 'just', 'feel', 'children', 'need', 'opportunity', 'revel', 'thrive', 'innocence', 'bedlam', 'cable', 'internet', 'invades', 'so', 'have', 'impressionable', 'little', 'ones', 'scurrying', 'highly', 'recommend', 'gentle', 'fable.Refreshingly', 'subtle', 'yet', 'still', 'morally', 'aware', 'story', 'Russian', 'Tsar', 'who', 'issues', 'challenge', 'hand', 'daughter', 'Princess', 'Alexya', 'foolish', 'peasant', 'boy', 'Pyotr', 'who', 'call', 'incidental', 'band', 'talented', 'merry-misfits', 'who', 'accompany', 'quest.You', 'have', 'adventure', 'romance', 'friendship', 'trust', 'compassion', 'good', 'vs.', 'wicked', 'bundled', 'together', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'winning', 'animated', 'tale', 'narrated', 'David', 'Suchet', 'early', 'tale', 'super-heroes', 'fellowship', 'seven', 'who', 'wield', 'forces', 'ice', 'wood', 'kindness', 'thirst', 'sight', 'sound', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'appetite', 'thwart', 'obstacles', 'encounter.Wonderful', 'little', 'story']",N/A

It combined excellent claymation with first-rate acting, and of course the story was also very satisfying. We watched it on a VHS tape that I recorded off the air.I would love to buy this on DVD, but I'm not going to spend over $100 on it! I wonder if WGBH (the US producer) might have a way of making it available for a new generation of children.",5,Superb animation and acting.

I bought it recently, and it holds up to this day.  The characters are lively and fun without being crass or rude, and the storyline is sweet, simple, and very much an enjoyable fairytale that the whole family will love to watch again and again.  Why get your kids hooked on the cheap, ""edgy"" children's programming that's all the rage these days, when there are shows like this?

I loooved every minute of it.  And my 22-year-old and 19-year-old brother and sister were intrigued to the point of watching it with me - and they are not very much into all that stuff to begin with :)  Classic storywriting.  If you have kids, this is the epitome of a fable - in fact, it reads just like a childhood-classic fairy tale with an original story line.  Of course, it has some great morals attached to it as well: do what's right, help others, and good things will come to you.  So if you have kids, be sure to grab this one for them!  They don't make stuff like this anymore - the artistic time and talent it took to make this is obvious.  Be sure to get this one, it's wonderful! :)",5,AMAZING,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,879,"['love', 'old-school', 'claymation', 'great', 'storylines', 'old-school', 'tv', 'shows', 'were', 'around', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'i.e', 'Long', 'Ago', 'Far', 'Away', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'loooved', 'minute', '22-year-old', '19-year-old', 'brother', 'sister', 'were', 'intrigued', 'point', 'watching', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'stuff', 'begin', 'Classic', 'storywriting', 'have', 'kids', 'epitome', 'fable', 'fact', 'just', 'childhood-classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'course', 'great', 'morals', 'attached', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'what', ""'s"", 'right', 'help', 'others', 'good', 'things', 'will', 'come', 'So', 'have', 'kids', 'be', 'sure', 'grab', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'stuff', 'anymore', 'artistic', 'time', 'talent', 'took', 'make', 'obvious', 'Be', 'sure', 'get', 'one', 'wonderful']",N/A

It's a grand story in the classic tradition.The hero: honest and unassuming. The quest: impossible. The prize: love and glory. The troupe: improbable. The imperial advisor: evil. The princess: the princess. But, just as a skilled chef can make a magical confection from the same ingredients that you and I bumble with, these creators draw a timeless tale from such ordinary ingredients. Classic or not, this story stands squarely in the classic style.These stop-animated dolls show delicate form and coloring. They move well enough that you'll suspend disblief willingly and eagerly, and they move among beautiful props. The sidekicks (I love the woodcutter's wife) each do their magical part to save the day.Sit back and let this charming wash over you.
