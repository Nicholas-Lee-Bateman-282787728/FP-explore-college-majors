But he seems to run the topic of race into the ground.  He's no Dave Chapelle!  He seems to be obssessed with being black!  We get it Chris.  Your black, some people are white, and others are (gasp) LATINO!  Thanks for sharing this amazing news!  I swear, he seems raceist.  So much so it got boring.  I'm white, and some say ""Well, you just don't get it unless your a minorite.""  No, I'm partially minorite, and it's still not funny.  The foirst 10 minutes were hilarious, then after that I was just like SHUT UP!!!!  Stop talking.  Get a new subject.  Pryor did alot of race topics, but he did many things WITH IT.  Chris Rock just is always talking about black people this and black people that.  Pryor talked about white church black church comparisions, bl;ack family white family comparision, white politics black politics comapision, did you ever notice this about (whatever race).  He is clearly the master of the topic of race, not this new guy trying to take over.  Not that he's totally worthless as a comic.  get the CD ""Born Suspect.""

517126,A3UAVYY80HNFZW,B0000399WN,drefractor,"[11, 13]","What makes you laugh? ""Bigger and Blacker"" dishes out the following:1) Profanity -- quite a bit of it. If you laugh at the mere thought or sound of profanity, buy this DVD. But in reality, the raw language is irrelevant. Watch the intensity of the delivery and pay attention to the ideas surrounding the ""bad"" words.2) Social/Political Commentary from one man's perspective -- A LOT of it.Chris Rock, as he continually states either directly or indirectly, is a ""law and order conservative"" (well, mostly order!) and a ""moral"" liberal. His moral liberalism is a bit extreme for most people, but it is refreshingly consistent and counterbalances the traditional notion of ""liberal"" tolerance with the libertarian ideal of being accountable for one's actions. Oh, and by the way, there are no victims in Chris Rock's universe. If you dislike ""Victim"" mentality, you will find it well dismissed here.3) Social/Racial Commentary from a black man's perspective -- There is a fair amount of this in Bigger and Blacker, but nothing earth shaking. Although he is clearly not pleased to be directly on the negative end of racial profiling, Rock typically redirects his racial commentary into larger themes (violence, hypocrisy, value systems...).4) About Men and Women -- Who are we, together and apart? These subjects are always fertile ground for comedy. Although he attempts to soften the blows by continued professions of his love for women, Chris's take on women in general is pretty harsh, while not quite so hard, nor as detailed on men. Rock has a clear disdain for absentee fathers, but men get a pass on most of their behaviors -- behaviors that are excused as ""understandable"" (if not necessarily right) attempts to get around intolerable actions of women. Judging by the apparent reaction of the  female members of the audience, Chris puts enough meat on the bones of his contentions to warrant serious contemplation after the laughter.5) Physical Presence -- Energetic, intense, animated...6) Limited Exaggerations --  Bigger and Blacker material mostly avoids ""over-""exaggeration while its points are being made, and make no mistake, Chris Rock is trying to make a LOT of points (Rock's latest stand-up effort, ""Never Scared"" drifts more often into realm of over-exaggeration by my account, thus rendering it less enjoyable despite some great ideas).7) Bonus Points -- A hilarious question is asked about medical science's ability (or lack thereof) to cure major diseases... An observation is given about social security's relevancy to black men... Both of these bonus points strain at the limits of exaggeration, but contain enough weight to make them worthy of an acid laugh or three...In short, Bigger and Blacker is not light comedy. If you primarily like self- depreciating comedians, Chris Rock is not your man; If you are a diehard of the ""left"" or ""right,"" he is not your man. If you prefer to believe that the world is generally rosy, he is not your man. If, on the other hand, you enjoy exceptional (almost) equal opportunity skewerings of pretenses and prejudices, it doesn't get much better than ""Bigger and Blacker"".",5,Sharp Views on Various Human Conditions...,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,3134,"['What', 'Bigger', 'Blacker', 'out', 'following:1', 'Profanity', 'quite', 'bit', 'laugh', 'mere', 'thought', 'sound', 'profanity', 'buy', 'DVD', 'reality', 'raw', 'language', 'irrelevant', 'Watch', 'intensity', 'delivery', 'pay', 'attention', 'ideas', 'surrounding', 'bad', 'words.2', 'Social/Political', 'Commentary', 'one', 'man', 'perspective', 'LOT', 'it.Chris', 'Rock', 'continually', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'law', 'order', 'conservative', 'well', 'mostly', 'order', 'moral', 'liberal', 'moral', 'liberalism', 'bit', 'extreme', 'most', 'people', 'refreshingly', 'consistent', 'traditional', 'notion', 'liberal', 'tolerance', 'libertarian', 'ideal', 'being', 'accountable', 'one', 'actions', 'Oh', 'way', 'are', 'victims', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'universe', 'dislike', 'Victim', 'mentality', 'will', 'find', 'well', 'dismissed', 'here.3', 'Social/Racial', 'Commentary', 'black', 'man', 'perspective', 'fair', 'amount', 'Bigger', 'Blacker', 'nothing', 'earth', 'shaking', 'clearly', 'not', 'pleased', 'be', 'directly', 'negative', 'end', 'racial', 'profiling', 'Rock', 'typically', 'racial', 'commentary', 'larger', 'themes', 'violence', 'hypocrisy', 'value', 'systems', '.4', 'Men', 'Women', 'Who', 'are', 'together', 'apart', 'subjects', 'are', 'always', 'fertile', 'ground', 'comedy', 'soften', 'blows', 'continued', 'professions', 'love', 'women', 'Chris', 'take', 'women', 'general', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'hard', 'detailed', 'men', 'Rock', 'clear', 'disdain', 'absentee', 'fathers', 'men', 'get', 'pass', 'most', 'behaviors', 'behaviors', 'are', 'excused', 'understandable', 'not', 'necessarily', 'right', 'attempts', 'get', 'intolerable', 'actions', 'women', 'Judging', 'apparent', 'reaction', 'female', 'members', 'audience', 'Chris', 'enough', 'meat', 'bones', 'contentions', 'warrant', 'serious', 'contemplation', 'laughter.5', 'Physical', 'Presence', 'Energetic', 'intense', 'animated', '6', 'Limited', 'Exaggerations', 'Bigger', 'Blacker', 'material', 'mostly', 'over-', 'exaggeration', 'points', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'make', 'mistake', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'trying', 'make', 'LOT', 'points', 'Rock', 'latest', 'stand-up', 'effort', 'Never', 'Scared', 'more', 'often', 'realm', 'over-exaggeration', 'account', 'thus', 'rendering', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'ideas', '.7', 'Bonus', 'Points', 'hilarious', 'question', 'asked', 'medical', 'science', 'ability', 'lack', 'thereof', 'cure', 'major', 'diseases', 'observation', 'given', 'social', 'security', 'relevancy', 'black', 'men', 'bonus', 'points', 'strain', 'limits', 'exaggeration', 'contain', 'enough', 'weight', 'make', 'worthy', 'acid', 'laugh', 'three', 'short', 'Bigger', 'Blacker', 'not', 'light', 'comedy', 'primarily', 'self-', 'depreciating', 'comedians', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'not', 'man', 'are', 'diehard', 'left', 'right', 'not', 'man', 'prefer', 'believe', 'world', 'generally', 'rosy', 'not', 'man', 'other', 'hand', 'enjoy', 'exceptional', 'almost', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'skewerings', 'pretenses', 'prejudices', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Bigger', 'Blacker']",N/A

From poking fun at the gun culture in America to irresponsible parenting, racism and Clinton's impeachment, Rock will have you choking with laughter. I can never forget his take on Newt Gingrich's motives for having president Clinton impeached. He manages to slip in the unadulterated truth with some profane poignancy. There is a good number of expletives used, but all are cleverly worked into the jokes to give them greater clout. His irreverence for hypocrisy and his political incorrectness are reminiscent of Pryor in his prime.

Bigger & Blacker is an HBO production filmed in the Apollo Theater and is brilliant satire from the perspective of an African-American.Rock lays the smack down on topics such as school violence, gun control, irresponsible parents, neglected fathers, infidelity, bigotry, and the poor state of health care.  His assertions are blunt, bold, and are fired from point-blank: ""A man is only as faithful as his options"", ""Men lie but women are much bigger liars"", ""Blacks and whites have little to complain about, consider the state of Native Americans"".All of Rock's material is solid and most of it is intelligent and thought-provoking.  He slips into crudeness only briefly as he suggests that the blind be assigned to midgets instead of seeing-eye dogs and when he mentions his contempt for women that don't provide oral servicing.  Also, he picks on white people a little, but it is not really funny like when Richard Pryor teased white people.  These minor flaws are certainly not deal breakers.Rock is providing a solid hour of comedy here.  He has a superb rapport with his audience and his delivery is very good overall with only a couple instances of repeating himself or otherwise stalling as he gathers his thoughts.  This is an adult show and profanity is used liberally, but not quite what I would consider gratuitously.  Overall this is a very good show that all fans of standup comedy, should consider viewing.

I subsequently made more tapes for all my friends, telling them that this is the funniest thing they'll ever see.  I naturally added the DVD to my collection when it was available.  Yes, Chris Rock swears a lot.  A whole lot.  Yes, he's controversial.  Yes, he harpoons everyone--- white, black, politicians, the media, the masses, the medical profession, men, women, and everyone in between.  So?  He's funny, dammit!  He's hilarious!  Unlike Andrew Dice Clay, who used profanity purely to get a laugh (and where is he today?), Chris Rock integrates it in clever, intelligent commentary on current events, interpersonal relationships, and just about every other subject you can imagine.  His dissertations on the Clinton-Lewinski affair, on dead rappers, on family interactions, are priceless.  My favortie?  His insightful, incisive evaluation of the 3 things men want (I won't tell you.  You'll have to get it from him).  Sure, everyone has different ideas of what's funny, but if you aren't afraid of four-letter words (I personally have a hard time keeping them out of my own conversation) and you like scathing wit and appreciate keen observations of modern life and the human condition --- regardless of your race, gender, sexual orientation, etc, etc ---- you should find this side-splittingly, tears-running-down-your-face funny.
