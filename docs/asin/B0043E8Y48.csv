1384286,A3UCBB9XD1SVK0,B0043E8Y48,"John Frame ""There Is No Substitute For Equality""","[0, 0]","This is a highly enjoyable and very high quality 2010 Eagle Rock DVD release of Frank Zappa's 1982 feature length (2hr) concert video ""The Torture Never Stops"" which was assembled from the professionally filmed Halloween 1981 shows in New York. It is credited as being transferred direct from Frank's own 1"" video master, and it's hard to imagine it could be any better (however a Blu-ray version would eliminate the split second pause as the layers change on the DVD-9). The video quality is superb - so close to film, but with just a hint of what was unavoidable with even the very best of 1981 video cameras. The stereo audio is huge, crystal clear and so beautifully mixed you could cry with joy. An astounding band too - and incredibly tight with some mind boggling arrangements, while convincing you that it's all just a walk in the park. Great DVD extras - including two out-take songs, and a professionally made video for ""You Are What You Is"" which could never be aired on any conservative TV network. My favourite performances from this are ""Alien Orifice"", ""Dumb All Over"", ""Strictly Genteel"" and ""Stevie's Spanking"" which features a beautiful duet between Frank Zappa and Steve Vai. I don't know if I've used enough superlatives in this mini review yet, so please add a half dozen more for camera work, editing, production, DVD design and the liner notes by Scott Thunes.",5,"lovingly transferred direct from Frank's own 1"" video master, perfectly showcased",1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,1383,"['highly', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'high', 'quality', '2010', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'DVD', 'release', 'Frank', 'Zappa', '1982', 'feature', 'length', '2hr', 'concert', 'video', 'Torture', 'Never', 'Stops', 'was', 'assembled', 'professionally', 'filmed', 'Halloween', '1981', 'New', 'York', 'credited', 'being', 'transferred', 'direct', 'Frank', 'own', '1', 'video', 'master', 'hard', 'imagine', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'however', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'would', 'eliminate', 'split', 'second', 'pause', 'layers', 'change', 'DVD-9', 'video', 'quality', 'superb', 'so', 'close', 'film', 'just', 'hint', 'what', 'was', 'unavoidable', 'even', 'very', 'best', '1981', 'video', 'cameras', 'stereo', 'audio', 'huge', 'crystal', 'clear', 'so', 'beautifully', 'mixed', 'could', 'cry', 'joy', 'astounding', 'band', 'too', 'incredibly', 'tight', 'mind', 'boggling', 'arrangements', 'convincing', 'just', 'walk', 'park', 'Great', 'DVD', 'extras', 'including', 'two', 'out-take', 'songs', 'professionally', 'made', 'video', 'Are', 'What', 'Is', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'aired', 'conservative', 'TV', 'network', 'favourite', 'performances', 'are', 'Alien', 'Orifice', 'Dumb', 'Over', 'Strictly', 'Genteel', 'Stevie', 'Spanking', 'beautiful', 'duet', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'used', 'enough', 'superlatives', 'mini', 'review', 'yet', 'please', 'add', 'half', 'dozen', 'more', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'production', 'DVD', 'design', 'liner', 'notes', 'Scott', 'Thunes']",N/A
1384287,A1MHTHU9A6OFN3,B0043E8Y48,"JP ""ZappaFan""","[0, 0]","And what I mean by that title is - there were actually 2 shows that night in NYC, a matinee and an evening, and the DVD seems to be a condensed version of both shows. NOT a complete version of either, or even the complete show that aired live on MTV that night (which, based on the bootleg VHS (and now DVD) that I have was the evening show).So, what you get is a partial recording of a show that, in my opinion, is better than the 1984 shows, but not up to the standards of the 73-74 band or that Gold Standard of Zappa shows: Baby Snakes. In fact, as many others have pointed out, this concert was somewhat lackluster compared to the 70s shows, like Zappa wasn't enjoying himself as much anymore.And yes, as many of us already know, this is the exact same footage that was previously released on The Dubroom Special so I guess that's why I was so disappointed, when they announced they were finally releasing this; I naturally assumed they WERE going to release both shows. Or at least the complete program as aired on MTV.But the band IS awesome; one of Frank's better line-ups and the DVD looks and sounds good. It's not 5.1, only PCM stereo, but if you have a good audio system that won't make much of a difference. Chad Wakerman's drums are a little too buried in the mix, the vocals are too ""forward"" and it's a little bass heavy for my taste, but still pretty good. Better than some that ARE in 5.1 in fact!!A few other notes; regardless of what Zappa says in the liner notes of YCDTOSA vol I, disc 2, I do not believe the Dumb All Over/Heavenly Bank Account/Suicide Chump sequence on the CD is from these shows, there are no solos on Suicide Chump on the DVD. And, if they were simply edited out, it is hands-down the greatest video editing I have ever seen. You can't tell at all.And the break between Jumbo Go Away and Stevie's Spanking is also VERY smooth. Not only are they from the 2 different shows (Jumbo from matinee, Spanking evening), shortly into Spanking you can still see Vai and his guitar tech swapping the electric Sitar (or whatever it is) he played on Sinister Footwear for the Stratocaster he uses during Spanking!!Which is the source of what is probably my greatest gripe.....I LOVE Footwear, think it is one of Zappa's best instrumentals and it IS on the bootleg of the MTV show that I have. So I was GREATLY disappointed to see it was left off this disc and darn near threw something at the TV when discovering so (didn't bother to read the tracklist beforehand)In fact the one thing I CAN say is that ALL the video editing is excellent, it plays like a continuous concert and if you didn't know the above facts would think it was!In addition to Sinister Footwear there are several more from that night I would have LOVED to have seen on the DVD - Yo' Mama, What's New In Baltimore?, Moggio , Joes' Garage and Why Does It Hurt When I Pee being the main ones.As for the bonus section, you do get 2 more songs: Teenage Prostitute and City of Tiny lights, as well as the original conceptual video for You Are What You Is. But a warning if you also own Baby Snakes - DON'T bother watching City of Tiny Lights, it is probably THE greatest example of how lackluster this concert was compared to Baby Snakes. And is also the perfect example of how drastically Zappa's guitar playing talents had declined during the intervening 4 years since Baby Snakes was filmed. No that I'm saying he was bad but, we all know he didn't play guitar near as much as he had in the 70s, focusing more on composing, and it REALLY shows. Playing City of Tiny Lights from 77 and then this one is almost light and day; the 77 version is so superior.The complete set lists for both shows are as follows:Matinee: You Are What You Is, Mudd Club, The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing, Dumb All Over/Heavenly Bank Account/Suicide Chump, Jumbo Go Away, Envelopes, Drowning Witch, What's New In Baltimore?, Moggio, We're Turning Again, Alien Orifice, Teenage Prostitute, Flakes, Broken Hearts Are For Assholes, The Blue Light, Tinseltown Rebellion, Yo Mama, Bobby Brown, City Of Tiny Lights, Strictly Genteel, Dancin' Fool, Whipping PostEvening: Black Napkins, Montana, Easy Meat, Society Pages/I'm A Beautiful Guy/Beauty Knows No Pain/Charlie's Enormous Mouth, Fine Girl, Teenage Wind, Harder Than Your Husband, Bamboozled By Love, Sinister Footwear, Stevie's Spanking, Cocaine Decisions, Nig Biz, Doreen, Goblin Girl, Black Page No. 2, Tryin To Grow A Chin, Strictly Genteel, The Torture Never Stops, Joe's Garage, Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?, Illinois Enema BanditThe GREATLY castrated track list of this DVD is:Black Napkins, Montana, Easy Meat, Beauty Knows No Pain, Charlie's Enormous Mouth, Fine Girl, Teenage Wind, Harder than Your Husband, Bamboozled By Love, We're Turning Again, Alien Orifice, Flakes, Broken Hearts Are For Assholes, You Are What You Is, Mudd Club, The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing, Dumb All Over, Heavenly Bank Account, Suicide Chump, Jumbo Go Away, Stevie's Spanking, The Torture Never Stops, Strictly Genteel, Illinois Enema BanditSo, comparing the set lists to the DVD track list, you can see what a cut-up piece of sub-par work this DVD ended up being, compared to what we COULD have if the ZFT would have released both shows in their entirety. Even so, I consider it a must have for all Zappa fans because it shows the line-up Frank himself considered one of his best in all it's glory.So, 4 stars (really more like 3.5) for what could have been. A disc (or even 2 discs) with both complete shows, unedited, would certainly rate 5 stars. Even if it doesn't live up to the standards set by Baby Snakes!!",4,Unedited?!?!? 3.5 stars for what could have been!,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,5624,"['what', 'mean', 'title', 'were', 'actually',

The sound and picture quality of this release is excellent. The band sounds fantastic though I do feel the absence of Ike Willis in this show. You are expecting to hear him sing the parts of You Are What You Is and Bobby Martin ends up doing them. That's not really a criticism because Martin and Ray White fill in well but it was something that I noticed immediately.What's a little disappointing about this release is that it is JUST music. There is nothing about this show which suggests its a Frank Zappa Halloween Show. The music could've been played at any time during 1981.
