If I had seen this in 1997, maybe it would have come across more strongly than it does now (I'd never watched it before). The tone seems strangely uneven; the actual murder story line is laid out in the straight forward way it would have been in a mid-budget 90s thriller, and Colm Feore's killer basically stays in that movie while the comic characters take off into more zany films. Those zanier elements have some ideas that are still hilarious, but there aren't as many of these as I'd hoped for. It's great that this movie recklessly subverts conventions, but those subversions don't always payoff into sustained laughs. For example, the disengaged cop who follows his hunches to shows and restaurants gets a big laugh when his plan becomes clear, but after that point, there are rapidly diminishing returns on the joke.",4,"Not a lost master piece, but still pretty funny",1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,900,"['2013', 'premise', 'lot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watch', 'had', 'seen', '1997', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'more', 'strongly', 'now', ""'d"", 'never', 'watched', 'tone', 'strangely', 'uneven', 'actual', 'murder', 'story', 'line', 'laid', 'out', 'straight', 'forward', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mid-budget', '90s', 'thriller', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'killer', 'basically', 'movie', 'comic', 'characters', 'take', 'off', 'more', 'zany', 'films', 'zanier', 'elements', 'have', 'ideas', 'are', 'still', 'hilarious', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'great', 'movie', 'recklessly', 'conventions', 'subversions', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'payoff', 'sustained', 'laughs', 'example', 'disengaged', 'cop', 'who', 'hunches', 'shows', 'restaurants', 'big', 'laugh', 'when', 'plan', 'clear', 'point', 'are', 'rapidly', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'joke']",N/A

The premise, about an idiot who thinks he's being chased by the law when the police already know who the real killer is, is pure genius.

There's tons of terrific jokes and nearly every one is dead on.

Dave Foley plays Niel, a banking executive that thinks he is going to be the next company president at his firm, but suddenly has his life turned upside down when his boss chooses someone else...and then ends up dead. Now what's funny about this plot so far, nothing, but as with many of the gang from the kids in the hall, it just happens.  Niel discovers the body of his boss, and in shock, he ends up contaminating the whole crime scene with evidence that he did the murder, so he takes off and runs away as a fugitive, heading for mexico.  As you've may figure out, he plays a very simple guy, not the brightest star in the sky. What he never realized is that the bosses office was videotaped, and they have the real killer on film and police are after him, and have no interest in Niel.  But, fate has him crossing paths with the real killer throughout the movie, and not once does the simple niel ever read the paper or actually watch tv to find out he's not really wanted.
