As an idea its a good one but in practice the recreation of a live performance for a television show has some limitations especially in the area of timing and editing.Michael McDonald's performance in support of his Motown album is quite a good one all things considered. He plays 12 songs in a set that lasts a little under an hour and gets good performances from his guests Ashford and Simpson, Pat Simmons and Ton Johnson of the Doobie Brothers. Highlights include I Heard it Through The Grapevine, Ain't No Mountain High Enough and his own later solo  and Doobie Brothers work.All in  all this is not a bad set but it is a little constrained by its format. The disc includes some textual special features and a two song preview of another Soundstage episode featuring Chicago.",3,Michael McDonald and Friends,1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,908,"['PBS', 'Soundstage', 'was', 'revived', '2003', 'forum', 'presenting', 'today', 'most', 'important', 'artists', 'intimate', 'live', 'settings', 'idea', 'good', 'one', 'practice', 'recreation', 'live', 'performance', 'television', 'show', 'limitations', 'especially', 'area', 'timing', 'editing.Michael', 'McDonald', 'performance', 'support', 'Motown', 'album', 'quite', 'good', 'one', 'things', 'considered', '12', 'songs', 'set', 'little', 'hour', 'good', 'performances', 'guests', 'Ashford', 'Simpson', 'Pat', 'Simmons', 'Ton', 'Johnson', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Heard', 'Grapevine', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Mountain', 'High', 'Enough', 'own', 'later', 'solo', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'work.All', 'not', 'bad', 'set', 'little', 'constrained', 'format', 'disc', 'textual', 'special', 'features', 'two', 'song', 'preview', 'Soundstage', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Chicago']",N/A

Watch for the bonus track where Michael does a shamelesspitch for Jennifer Lopez' recent cover of ""You Belong to Me"" which of course is no where as good as Carly Simon's or the Doobies.Now with his Soul Speak album becoming a huge success maybe he'll do another special or another gathering of friends this time where he does more duets.

This concert is a full five stars!  My only negative is that it was only 53 minutes long.  Even that was packed with the feeling that I like to get from concert DVDs.Someone said something about the sound quality being poor.  I can only say that that person must not have a system to run it on.  On my (somewhat old) 5.1 system, this concert was as potent as the original concert.  If you're running decent equipment, you won't be disappointed.This was the first concert that I played on my new 42"" TV.  The video quality need make no apologies, either.  When combined with the sound, I thought I was in Best Buy watching this on a $5000 system!As for the content, what can you say?  It's Michael Mc Donald singing both the Doobie hits, and the Motown remasteries.  A visit from Nick and Valerie -- ba da bing!  Great concert (albeit short).It's a great ""come over and watch"" concert for singles; and a good ""hey hunny"" to spring on your spouse.

MM sings his solo hits (Sweet Freedom, I keep Forgetting),  his hits with the Doobie Brothers (Minute by Minute, What a Fool Believes, Takin' It to the Streets, You Belong to Me), and songs from Motown 1 album (I Heard It through the Grapevine, Ain't No Mountain High Enough, Ain't Nothin' Like the Real Thing).  Patrick Simmons & Tom Johnston from the Doobies also sing 2 of their songs (Black Water, Take Me in Your Arms).MM is backed up by an outstanding band and singers.  I really enjoyed the performances.  On his own songs with the Doobie Brothers, I felt he performed them better on this DVD than on the Doobies -- Wildlife Concert, which happened to be a really great performance.  He is also backed up by Ashford and Simpson on the Motown songs.I thought the sound quality was very good; I had no problems with it.If you're a MM fan, you will really like this DVD!

I have to say that I was disappointed though. Michael sings most of the songs very differently than originally recorded. Still good, energetic performances, just not exactly what I was after...I'm kind of a stickler for hearing songs sang much like the originals. Some artists do it very well, some kinda do their own thing live. I had no issues with the sound or picture quality on my equipment, as some of the reviewers experienced. Overall, I'm glad I own it, but probably not one that I'll watch very much. I'd rather crank the original cd songs.
