Music fans in general don't realize it just now, but this band is going to turn out to be very important to the evolution of rock as we know it. In much the same way as a DMB or a Phish, BFF takes musical angles never-before used and creates songs you can sing along with. The venue is small and thus, the sound is remarkable. Ben is hilarious. Overall a very worthwhile buy. Only detraction is that the material is the band's older material (Kate, Song for the Dumped...)

Packham ""Stuart""","[1, 1]","I've watched this DVD a few times now and every time I watch it I catch myself marvelling at how excellent Ben Folds is on the piano. It's like a natural extension of his body. And I also marvel at the things he's also doing when playing the piano - keeping a beat with his body whilst standing up and playing, then playing a harmonium simultaneously! For me, a budding pianist, just to watch Ben Folds perform is worth the price of admission.But. There's so much more than that on this DVD. Perfect sound quality, picture quality and camerawork for one thing. They play all of their classics too. Folds lets the piano have it in `The Last Polka' and `Philosophy', and uses a microphone on the actual piano strings whilst bassist Robert Sledge attacks his bass guitar to elicit feedback in `Song For the Dumped'. Amongst other things, you get the trademark wild behaviour we've come to expect from Ben Folds Five: Folds stands on his stool, bashes the keys with his shoe throws his stool at the piano; the band launch into seemingly spontaneous tangents; and they fool around in `Underground'. Put simply, this DVD is about as close as you could come to actually seeing them live if you never got the chance. I didn't, and now I'm satisfied!You also get 45 minutes of extra `spare-reels' footage on this DVD after the concert. This is where the DVD kind of falls down. The picture quality isn't very good, the sound is adequate, and the camera technique is quite poor. You seldom get to see Folds actually hitting the keys (that's where I get the chills up my spine). Also, about 6 out of the 9 songs played in this section were played in the West 54th bit, but it's great to hear a live version of Jackson Cannery, as well as some studio shots of BF5 recording `Don't Change Your Plans' and `Army'. Interspersed between the songs on the spare-reels section is little nonsense clips of the band fooling around. In one clip they are riding small German motorcycles whilst Sledge claims ""I wanna be free to ride my machine without getting hassled by the man!"" In another they encounter a psychopathic stuntman who beats them all up, breaks Ben Folds' finger and snaps Sledge's arm. Very funny stuff.Ultimately though this DVD is really well worth the purchase price just for the concert at West 54th. It's so perfectly executed and well done, and the band play so well and with such gusto that it's like you're part of the audience. In fact you get a much better view than the audience! The spare reels section adds some laughs another dose of the band going nuts again, which is great, but it pales in comparison with the first section of the DVD. Nevertheless, I'd give it four stars easily, probably four and a half.",4,A really good DVD - it's like seeing the band live!,1012953600,"02 6, 2002",2002,2717,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'time', 'watch', 'catch', 'marvelling', 'how', 'excellent', 'Ben', 'Folds', 'piano', 'natural', 'extension', 'body', 'also', 'marvel', 'things', 'also', 'doing', 'when', 'playing', 'piano', 'keeping', 'beat', 'body', 'whilst', 'standing', 'up', 'playing', 'then', 'playing', 'harmonium', 'simultaneously', 'budding', 'pianist', 'just', 'watch', 'Ben', 'Folds', 'perform', 'price', 'admission.But', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'DVD', 'Perfect', 'sound', 'quality', 'picture', 'quality', 'camerawork', 'one', 'thing', 'play', 'classics', 'too', 'Folds', 'piano', 'have', 'Last', 'Polka', 'Philosophy', 'microphone', 'actual', 'piano', 'strings', 'whilst', 'bassist', 'Robert', 'Sledge', 'bass', 'guitar', 'elicit', 'feedback', 'Song', 'Dumped', 'Amongst', 'other', 'things', 'get', 'trademark', 'wild', 'behaviour', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Ben', 'Folds', 'Five', 'Folds', 'stool', 'keys', 'shoe', 'stool', 'piano', 'band', 'launch', 'seemingly', 'spontaneous', 'tangents', 'fool', 'around', 'Underground', 'Put', 'simply', 'DVD', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'could', 'come', 'actually', 'seeing', 'live', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'did', ""n't"", 'now', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'also', 'get', '45', 'minutes', 'extra', 'spare-reels', 'footage', 'DVD', 'concert', 'where', 'DVD', 'kind', 'falls', 'down', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'adequate', 'camera', 'technique', 'quite', 'poor', 'seldom', 'get', 'see', 'Folds', 'actually', 'hitting', 'keys', 'where', 'get', 'chills', 'up', 'spine', 'Also', 'about', '6', '9', 'songs', 'played', 'section', 'were', 'played', 'West', '54th', 'bit', 'great', 'hear', 'live', 'version', 'Jackson', 'Cannery', 'as', 'well', 'studio', 'shots', 'BF5', 'recording', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Change', 'Your', 'Plans', 'Army', 'Interspersed', 'songs', 'spare-reels', 'section', 'little', 'nonsense', 'clips', 'band', 'fooling', 'around', 'one', 'clip', 'are', 'riding', 'small', 'German', 'motorcycles', 'whilst', 'Sledge', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'free', 'ride', 'machine', 'getting', 'hassled', 'man', 'encounter', 'psychopathic', 'stuntman', 'who', 'up', 'breaks', 'Ben', 'Folds', 'finger', 'Sledge', 'arm', 'Very', 'funny', 'stuff.Ultimately', 'DVD', 'really', 'well', 'purchase', 'price', 'just', 'concert', 'West', '54th', 'so', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'well', 'done', 'band', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'such', 'gusto', ""'re"", 'part', 'audience', 'fact', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'view', 'audience', 'spare', 'reels', 'section', 'laughs', 'dose', 'band', 'going', 'nuts', 'again', 'great', 'comparison', 'first', 'section', 'DVD', 'Nevertheless', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'easily', 'probably', 'four', 'half']",Ben Folds Five - The Complete Sessions at West 54th

I am a huge fan of Ben Folds Five and am one of the unfortunate souls who never got to see them perform live. Nontheless, I am extremely pleased with this purchase and mad at the same time for not going out of my way to see them live when the were together.After watching this DVD, it made me ponder one important question.  Why did they break up?  Obviously there's a reason, but the magic that is present in this performance makes you think they would be together for much longer than they were.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll see them back together soon.I really wanted to catch the full effect of this show.  Since I don't have Dolby 5.1 surround on my DVD player/TV, I decided to watch it on my computer with my headphones.  I can honestly say I had goosebumps through the majority of the show.  The camera angles and sound quality are, for lack of a better word, perfect.  I might enjoy a widescreen version, though.  No matter.  It's still incredible.  I could hear every little snare hit, finger slide, and breath of the concert.  I don't believe one miniscule detail was left out of this performance.  It is top notch in my book.One thing I've come to expect from good bands is that they sound as good live as they do on record.  How many bands make incredible albums, but just don't cut it when it comes to performing on stage?  I can think of plenty.  Not Ben Folds Five.  They are as accurate as a band can get.  There are several times when the guys go off track and experiment a bit.  On the final track, &quot;Song For the Dumped,&quot; Robert Sledge actually makes a trip hop beat with his bass.  Pretty impressive if you ask me.There is not one track on this entire disk that should be skipped over.  If there were a couple of songs on the 54th Street portion from &quot;The Unauthorized Biography,&quot; I believe this would be a perfect Ben Folds Five Greatest Hits album.  I know that I'll be watching this performance for many years to come.  I better buy a back up copy while I can to replace this one when it wears out.Please do yourself a favor and get this dvd.  Any fan of the band would be extremely happy.  I think it captures them at their best.  If you don't like Ben Folds Five, you soon will.
