Absolutely superb, with every shot like a masterpiece of painting. Beautifully told in poetic language. (I saw it in the Spanish version). Viggo Mortensen was perfectly cast, giving a brilliant performance as the soldier-turned-mercenary to the Spanish empire, portraying a weary warrior with a noble heart. A movie that appeals to so many senses and that could easily be seen more than once, because there is so much to take in, and for the quality of the photography alone, it could be enjoyed many times over. Thumbs up to the director of photography, the director, to Viggo, to the rest of the excellent cast, as well as the script-writer!",5,A treat to the senses,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,706,"['would', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'photography', 'alone', 'Absolutely', 'superb', 'shot', 'masterpiece', 'painting', 'Beautifully', 'told', 'poetic', 'language', 'saw', 'Spanish', 'version', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'giving', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'soldier-turned-mercenary', 'Spanish', 'empire', 'portraying', 'weary', 'warrior', 'noble', 'heart', 'movie', 'appeals', 'so', 'many', 'senses', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'so', 'much', 'take', 'quality', 'photography', 'alone', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'times', 'Thumbs', 'director', 'photography', 'director', 'Viggo', 'rest', 'excellent', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'script-writer']",N/A

The settings and costumes are beautiful and the story, though sometimes difficult to follow, always keeps the viewer interested. But it's Mortensen's character that is particularly well portrayed. He's not the perfect hero at all. Capable of cruelty and deception somehow we still warm to him and admire him. And that's Mortensen's achievement. All the sub-plots come together well too. For those of us who think that it's more and more rare to see a 'new' movie because most of what's produced today is basically a re-hash of the usual stories and themes, then here's one worth watching and something different from the usual Hollywood mass production.",5,great movie with a difference,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,838,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'describing', 'different', 'plots', 'need', 'repetition', 'here.This', 'great', 'movie', 'far', 'best', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mortensen', 'play', 'settings', 'costumes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'story', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'follow', 'always', 'viewer', 'interested', 'Mortensen', 'character', 'particularly', 'well', 'portrayed', 'not', 'perfect', 'hero', 'Capable', 'cruelty', 'deception', 'somehow', 'still', 'warm', 'admire', 'Mortensen', 'achievement', 'sub-plots', 'come', 'together', 'well', 'too', 'who', 'think', 'more', 'more', 'rare', 'see', ""'new"", 'movie', 'most', 'what', 'produced', 'today', 'basically', 're-hash', 'usual', 'stories', 'themes', 'then', 'here', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'something', 'different', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'mass', 'production']",N/A
649585,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B00005JPF9,Arch Stanton,"[1, 2]","This movie has a lot to recommend about it. It has a good cast, beautiful sets and imagery, a budget, and an unusual setting. I don't really know any Spanish actors outside of Javier Barden and Antonio Banderas neither of whom are in this, but all of the performances are quite good. Particularly good is Viggo Mortenson who can apparently speak Spanish fluently. Who knew? The budget is really on display here. There are some pretty impressive action scenes. I particularly love the little details like how the Spanish soldiers have to keep their fuses lit since they have to use them to fire their guns. The best part of the movie is undoubtedly the cinematography. The composition and layout of the shots imitate paintings from the period which makes for some beautiful still images.Despite that it's not really a film I can recommend. While it seems to have all the right parts they never really come together properly. For example despite the good performances the characters are utterly undeveloped and change completely without any reason or motivation. I understand that this film is several books combined together and it shows. You can tell exactly when one book ends and another begins. This also means that there's no overarching plot throughout the movie but only a series of smaller incidents. For example, near the beginning of the film Alatriste is hired to kill two men who turn out to be the prince of England and his friend. Once he discovers this they never mention it again. Trying to keep up with what's going on is a constant effort and even when paying attention it is impossible to know why it's happening. What they should have done is pick one of these stories (they cover at least half a dozen) and spend the entire movie on it. By forcing them all together with no links they ruin any dramatic potential inherent in them. Because of this you never really care for (or understand) any of the main characters and you never really get a feel for the important events happening around them. So why I'd really like to give it a higher rating I cannot because it isn't really one coherent movie so much as several smaller ones.

After ""LOTR"" I started looking at some of his other movies realizing he is a pretty good actor. I was not let down by ""Alatriste."" Viggo plays the title charactor, a Spanish mercenary in the 17th century. There ia a lot going on in this movie and a lot of the reviewers complained about this, but I like the movie alot. Being in Spanish with subtitles did not detract at all from the story. There is action, romance and a real grittiness to this film. It also touches on some real historic events, wars in Flanders and against France. There are two love stories going on. Alatriste's love is a married actress who doesn't seem to really care for anyone and her retribution for this fits the crime. The other love story is the son of a friend of Alatriste's who was killed and Alatriste promised to take care of to the dying man. You can't quite be sure if this man's lover is sincere either. Viggo plays his charactor with very real emotions going from cold hearted mercenary to revenge seeking, then sypathetic regretful ex-lover. I was glad I took a chance on this film after reading some of the negative reviews. I never read the books so I don't know how it compares.

Hollywood has not done justice to Spaniards and Spanish history since &#8220;El Cid&#8221; was released back in 1961 (and somewhat with &#8220;Gladiator&#8221; which was loosely based on a Hispano-Roman general from the Roman province of Hispania). Although &#8220;Alatriste&#8221; is distributed by 20th Century Fox abroad (fortunately with English subtitles), the movie was suspiciously not released and marketed to the U.S. public. This movie is devoid of the prolific negative stereotypical caricatures of Spaniards fostered by Hollywood and the mass media in the United States. Moreover, the movie is not plagued with Hollywood&#8217;s contemporary cookie-cutter production style and fixation on infantile fluff (i.e., exaggerated special effects, gratuitous violence, and pseudo-pornography). The story is solid and entertaining; however, it may be difficult to follow since most people in the United States have been deprived of factual Spanish history, but rather inculcated with Hispanophobia in its place. I suggest watching the movie a few times to get a better understanding.The sword duels are realistic and are not influenced by Oriental martial arts sword fighting like so many movies regurgitated by Hollywood.

Visually this is a very good movie. Good action, filmed very well. Unfortunately the movie is very disjointed and jumps all over the place. There is no flow and no real character development. It can be very hard to follow if you haven't read the books. The books are great and I highly recommend them. Unfortunately if you haven't read them the film will make absolutely no sense. If you've read the books you will have some empathy for the characters and have a vague idea of what's going on. Unfortunately the movie seems to have jumped over 4 to 5 books that do all of the character development.  Being so disjointed some of the scenes and action make no sense. You get the feeling that something may have happened previously that results in the scene you're watching but have no idea what it was. I now realize why the film wasn't released in the US. It's entertaining for the fans who have read the books(but still hard to follow). If you haven't read them you'll be so lost and the story will make so little sense you'll think the people who made the movie had no idea what they were doing. They should have stuck to just making a film about the first one or two books instead of cramming all the books into one movie. Especially since not all of the books have been released in the US yet. If you haven't read the books don't buy this movie. Even if you have read the books translated into English you may want to pass on this film.

Alatriste novels, chronicles a number of the Captain's adventures, over the course of about 20 years. These include service in the Spanish army in Flanders and intrigues at home in Madrid. Captain Alatriste (Viggo Mortensen) is like a Spanish version of D'Artagnan, and this movie is set at approximately the same time as ""The Three Musketeers"", with many of the same historical figures throughout.I have only read one of the Capt. Alatriste novels (the first one), and the problem with that novel was that there was too little material spread over too many pages. It was as if Perez-Reverte was holding back for the later novels in the series (he probably was). ""Alatriste"" the movie has the opposite problem. There is too much material condensed in to too little time. This 2  hour movie is based on all five of the Alatriste novels and as a result the film flies through event after event, giving the audience little chance to become acquainted with the characters or to figure out what is going on. Even the first section of the film, which was based on the book that I had read, was hard for me to follow and by the end of the film, I couldn't figure out what was happening at all and didn't really care.

I love the way it was made to resemble Diego de Velasquez' paintings, with its vivid ciaroscuro, strategic positioning of the bodies in each frame, and a lot of drapery and textiles that you can actually discren from one another be it leather, silk, or parchment.Action content is sufficient and not boring. We can see fencing as it was during that century, a bloody ordeal - far from sport. In particular i really enjoyed a show in the use of the left-hand dagger, or the gauche which greatly empowers the fighter. Needless to say, El Capitan is a master fencer with hands on experience...almost or as good as his arch-foe - a Sicilian...This is a film filled with emotions, in part due to a great play of the actors involved in its making. In short: idea of love for the rich and the poor greatly differs, while our hero is neither - he seems to be in the category of his own, a conquistador, which allows him to mingle in different strata of his society from top to the very bottom. A woman who has his unquestionable love, is an actress, who unwittingly (but surely) betrays him. That nevertheless does not change Captain's feelings even a bit - in fact he keeps loving her till (her) bitter decay, which is by the way i think one of the most touching scenes in the movie.Through vivid scenery and true-to-life representation of the time epoch, this film conveys a very positive message.

649597,A1HS4595P8TLG8,B00005JPF9,JPS,"[4, 5]","I posted this review today on amazon.uk. It seems that the film has also suffered from the same type of critics on Amazon.com. Accordingly, I felt it might be useful - at least for some - to read a somewhat different point of view coming from someone who really loved the film.I am a bit amazed that this film has been critized so much, and this is why I am reviewed it only now, after having bought it over six months ago, seen it twice, and thoroughly enjoyed enjoyed it each time.As another recent has noted (Vandal), I also like it both despite of and because of the main criticism levelled against it: that it is disjointed, with, allegedly, too much crammed into one film. Stating that the film includes bits and pieces from three of Perez-Reverte's books on Captain Alatriste is quite correct. However, this did not ""ruin any dramatic potential"" for me. Quite the opposite in fact, it added some. Rather than a continuous, linear and somewhat conventional story of Captain Alatriste over some 20 years (from 1622 to the battle of Rocroi in 1643), you get glimpses, the main episodes in the life of a profesional and veteran Tercio. Whether this is deliberatly intended or whether it is just the result of wanting to include as much of the three books as possible is rather irrelevant to me. This is because I found the end result rather good and, unlike others perhaps, I do not necessarily need my films to spell everything out.Interestingly, I also felt that, by concentrating on the issue above, most reviewers seem to have missed what for me was the main point of the whole film: the hero's (or should I have written the ""anti-hero""?) rise and fall, which mirrors that of Spain. Two other reviewers have captured parts - but only parts - of this core theme that makes the film come together.One is Charles Vasey in ghis ""Golden Century"" review. This is indeed a film about the Spanish wars in Flanders against the heretics and rebels that would become the Dutch: heretics because they were Protestants, and rebels because they rejected the King of Spain's authority and were fighting for independence which they would finally obtain, becoming the United Provinces (the current Netherlands). These endless wars lasted the best part of 80 years and were quite horrific, even for the time, as the film shows rather well with its episode on canal warfare and the other episode on the siege of Breda. Spain, who would finally be defeated a good 20 years after Rocroi (in 1643), would also be bankcrupted and bled dry by the endless war, while the Dutch received support from England, and even sometimes from Catholic France, both bitter rivals of Spain. This is largely seen in the film.The other reviewer (Bob Salter) rather insisted on Alatriste as a ""killer for a few coins"". This is the other part of the story, that of an increasingly impoverished - or at least unequal Spain where demobilized soldiers were no longer paid and had to hire out their swords to anyone willing to pay them the few coins that would precent them from starving, while the great nobles intrigued, plotted and got ever richer. The film's contrast between the arrogant and despising attitude of Olivares (very well portrayed, by the way) and the impoverished but still proud Alatriste is one of the most powerful scenes. Reduced to misery, Alatriste, and all of the other demobilized soldiers who only have their swords to live on, are simply ready to accept ANY job to survive, especially killing somebody.One the object lessons of the film is to show how the most valiant and brave of Spain's sons, those that bled and died on its numerous battlefields, were the most poorly and dishonorably treated, as if they were beggars, when they went home and were no longer fighting a war. So, it is hardly surprising if some reviewers found the film gloomy: it's all about misery, doom and gloom, on the one hand, and herosm and honor (but NOT glory) on the other. The first piece occurrs whenever Alatriste is demobilized (and therefore not paid anything anymore by the Crown). The second, when he is fighting for the Greater glory and benefit of his (somewhat unworthy) King. These contrasts are, of course, quite deliberate in the film, and also exist in the books. This is, after all, the Spanish and modern version of the Three Musketeers: it's realistic and feels very real. It's about doom, gloom and honour, and don't expect any ""Hollywodian happy ending"". There are a couple of love stories, of course, but they do not end particularly well and the couples do not exactly end up by ridding of into the sunset!Finally, there is, of course, the costums, which are wonderfully accurate to the extent that they seem to be straight out of a museum (the Prado, of course!), the actors' performances, on which so much has already been said that I do not feel the need to add more comments (I loved Vigo Mortensen's performance, but I also liked many of the others, starting with the actor playing Olivares) and the battles and duels, which are filmed in such a way as to make them as gripping and as realistic as possible. The last scenes - those of the battle of Rocroi - are particularly good, and perfectly historical by the way: the Tercios did not surrender and fought to the last before being overrun by the French cavalry. The film's end, which does stop abruptly, is certainly deliberate: either there was nothing more to show, apart from the final slaughter, or this was allowing for a Part 2 sometime in the future. After all, the film only uses Perez-Reverte's first three books on Alatriste, so there is still room for at least one sequel...Anyway, in case you had not realized yet, I loved that film and it worked fine for me...",5,"Doom, Gloom and Honor at the end of Spain's ""Golden Century""",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,5722,"['posted', 'review', 'today', 'amazon.uk', 'film', 'also', 'suffered', 'same',

The movie started way too late, but was well-worth waiting for. Agust&iacute;n D&iacute;az Yanes clearly succeeded in his filmic version of P&eacute;rez-Reverte's ""Alatriste"" series, offering the spectators the opportunity to witness the adventures of a soldier and his friends, and making us care for whatever happens to them.The action is set in the early 17th century, mainly in Spain. The story is told in retrospective by &Iacute;&ntilde;igo Balboa (Unax Ugalde), a young man that Diego Alatriste (Viggo Mortensen) took under his wing after the death of his father, an old comrade. Alatriste was a soldier that sometimes offered his sword for hire to those who could pay the price, and that lived a dangerous life, during the decline of the Spanish Empire.This film lasts more or less two hours, but that is enough to learn about Diego Alatriste and I&ntilde;igo, the women they loved, and the dangerous lives they led. It is also quite interesting to watch Alatriste's Spain, and learn what was wrong with it, from the point of view of a simple soldier that nonetheless had lots of pride and a distinctive point of view regarding what was happening around him.Pride, courage, friendship, love and treason are some of the themes that this film tackles, while telling us about Alatriste and his friend. I would like to point out that the cast did a wonderful, specially in the case of Viggo Mortensen as Alatriste, Unax Ugalde as I&ntilde;igo, Ariadna Gil as Alatriste's lover and Elena Anaya as Ang&eacute;lica, the young woman I&ntilde;igo loved with all his heart.On the whole, I can say I really liked ""Alatriste"". It is the kind of outstanding movie that creates an atmosphere that leds you to believe someone has managed to find a way to bring the past back, and you are lucky enough the experience it. What more can you ask a movie for? Of course, highly recommended...Belen AlcatPS1:  Bear in mind that ""Alatriste"" has some scenes with a lot of violence and some nudity, never gratuitous but not adequate for children.PS2: I saw Viggo at the avant premi&eacute;re, and I am pretty sure that the ladies will be glad to know that he is just as good looking in person as in the movies.

I won't be buying the books, which aren't the sort of light reading I prefer. Of Viggo Mortensen, on the other hand, I am a great admirer, but not for the usual reason, since I've never seen a hobbit, though perhaps I should. It's just that ever so gradually as I connected one splendid performance in this or that film to another one, I learned his name. My admiration truly soared when I saw A History of Violence, however, where I believe his is one of the finest performances I've ever seen anywhere, in any format, in one of the finest movies movies I've ever seen. (Two friends who are acting teachers agree, by the way). This movie is not the &#34;great&#34; category, probably in part for the reason which admirers of the books have objected to, namely that any story so compressed is doomed to be confusing. So yes, at times my husband and I got slightly confused, made worse by the fact that neither he nor I could confidently identify every Spanish face, and that was made worse by the fact that the whole film, while starkly beautiful, is dark, appropriately shot in tones of mud and grey. And of course the occasional facial confusion was made even harder by having to read the subtitles, FAST, then scrutinize the faces again. But at no time was that a big problem, and as I said, the film is very beautiful, so I never minded having to go back. Moreover, in the interests of full disclosure I should say that I read a lot of history and most of what I read is set in the early modern period, which is precisely when this story takes place. Although the film is not focused on history as such, it is historically impeccable. However, it remains an adventure story and it does NOT require much historical knowledge at all. I think that anyone who is even mildly interested in knowing why Spain was fighting in &#34;Flanders&#34; at the time could read the two Wiki segments that deal with Spain from the time of its acquiring great wealth from the Americas, down to the middle of the 1600s, by which time the money was gone. Or simply take a sideways step from watching reruns of The Borgias to this. During its era of glory the tough, smart Spanish soldier was sent almost everywhere on earth, and that is REALLY the over-arching theme of the movie and of Mortensen's role. His portrait of the &#34;unknown&#34; soldier&#34; of that time and place is simply amazing. It is the portrait of a very particular man who weeps when he goes to visit his lifelong love in a hospital for those dying of syphilis, while at the same time it is a perfectly painted &#34;type&#34; who might equally well have served with immense courage and distinction under the brilliant Stanley McChrystal in more recent, equally sad, wars.",5,Splendid Portrait of Spain in this Era,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2886,"['situate', 'reviewer', 'here', 'should', 'say', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'adventure', 'series', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'see', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'books', 'are', ""n't"", 'sort', 'light', 'reading', 'prefer', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'other', 'hand', 'am', 'great', 'admirer', 'not', 'usual', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'hobbit', 'perhaps', 'should', 'just', 'ever', 'so', 'gradually', 'connected', 'one', 'splendid', 'performance', 'film', 'one', 'learned', 'name', 'admiration', 'truly', 'soared', 'when', 'saw', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'however', 'where', 'believe', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'format', 'one', 'finest', 'movies', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Two', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'acting', 'teachers', 'agree', 'way', 'movie', 'not', '34', 'great', '34', 'category', 'probably', 'part', 'reason', 'admirers', 'books', 'have', 'objected', 'namely', 'story', 'so', 'compressed', 'doomed', 'be', 'confusing', 'So', 'yes', 'times', 'husband', 'got', 'slightly', 'confused', 'made', 'worse', 'fact', 'could', 'confidently', 'identify', 'Spanish', 'face', 'was', 'made', 'worse', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'starkly', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'appropriately', 'shot', 'tones', 'mud', 'grey', 'course', 'occasional', 'facial', 'confusion', 'was', 'made', 'even', 'harder', 'having', 'read', 'subtitles', 'FAST', 'then', 'scrutinize', 'again', 'time', 'was', 'big', 'problem', 'said', 'film', 'very', 'beautiful', 'never', 'minded', 'having', 'go', 'back', 'Moreover', 'interests', 'full', 'disclosure', 'should', 'say', 'read', 'lot', 'history', 'most', 'what', 'read', 'set', 'early', 'modern', 'period', 'precisely', 'when', 'story', 'place', 'film', 'not', 'focused', 'history', 'such', 'historically', 'impeccable', 'However', 'adventure', 'story', 'NOT', 'require', 'much', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'mildly', 'interested', 'knowing', 'why', 'Spain', 'was', 'fighting', '34', 'Flanders', '34', 'time', 'could', 'read', 'two', 'Wiki', 'segments', 'deal', 'Spain', 'time', 'acquiring', 'great', 'wealth', 'Americas', 'down', 'middle', '1600s', 'time', 'money', 'was', 'gone', 'simply', 'take', 'sideways', 'step', 'watching', 'reruns', 'Borgias', 'era', 'glory', 'tough', 'smart', 'Spanish', 'soldier', 'was', 'sent', 'almost', 'everywhere', 'earth', 'REALLY', 'over-arching', 'theme', 'movie', 'Mortensen', 'role', 'portrait', '34', 'unknown', '34', 'soldier', '34', 'time', 'place', 'simply', 'amazing', 'portrait', 'very', 'particular', 'man', 'who', 'when', 'visit', 'lifelong', 'love', 'hospital', 'dying', 'syphilis', 'same', 'time', 'perfectly', 'painted', '34', 'type', '34', 'who', 'might', 'equally', 'well', 'have', 'served', 'immense', 'courage', 'distinction', 'brilliant', 'Stanley', 'McChrystal', 'more', 'recent', 'equally', 'sad', 'wars']",N/A

I've only read two books in the series.  Where the film dealt with events in the books I knew, it came across as a painfully abbreviated Cliffs Notes version of the source material.  Once it moved into unfamiliar territory, I enjoyed it more.I think ""Alatriste"" will be enjoyed most by viewers completely unfamiliar with the books.  Taken on its own the film is an entertaining, if slightly confusing, swashbuckler.  Although there are plenty of thrilling battle scenes and duels, this isn't a simple action picture; some knowledge of 17th century Spanish history will certainly help the viewer understand the major plot points.This was the most expensive movie ever produced in Spain, and the money spent on it shows in the final product.  The production is first rate, with an excellent cast headed by Viggo Mortensen as Alatriste.  The costumes and sets are exceptional, and the cinematography gives the film an atmosphere reminiscent of a fine old painting.Fans of the books will be disappointed.  ""Alatriste"" would have been improved by devoting the entire film to the events of just the first book.  Or, the Spanish producers could have taken a page from the Hollywood play book and given us a series of sequels.  There is certainly enough interesting material in the books to sustain several movies.The Fox International DVD (Regions 1 and 4) has scene selection and features language tracks in either Spanish (Castellano) or Portuguese; subtitles are available in English or Portuguese.",4,"17th c Spain brought to life in a gorgeous production, but not recommended to fans of the novels",1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,1769,"['Alatriste', 'epic', 'film', 'Spain', 'dealing', 'life', 'adventures', 'Captain', 'Diego', 'Alatriste', 'soldier', 'Philip', 'IV', 'reign.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'cover', 'events', 'set', 'forth', 'five', 'Arturo', 'P', 'eacute', 'rez-Reverte', 'novels', 'Captain', 'mere', '145', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'two', 'books', 'series', 'Where', 'film', 'dealt', 'events', 'books', 'knew', 'came', 'painfully', 'abbreviated', 'Cliffs', 'Notes', 'version', 'source', 'material', 'moved', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'Alatriste', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'viewers', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'books', 'Taken', 'own', 'film', 'entertaining', 'slightly', 'confusing', 'swashbuckler', 'are', 'plenty', 'thrilling', 'battle', 'scenes', 'duels', ""n't"", 'simple', 'action', 'picture', 'knowledge', '17th', 'century', 'Spanish', 'history', 'will', 'certainly', 'help', 'viewer', 'understand', 'major', 'plot', 'points.This', 'was', 'most', 'expensive', 'movie', 'ever', 'produced', 'Spain', 'money', 'spent', 'final', 'product', 'production', 'first', 'rate', 'excellent', 'cast', 'headed', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Alatriste', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'exceptional', 'cinematography', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'reminiscent', 'fine', 'old', 'painting.Fans', 'books', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Alatriste', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'devoting', 'entire', 'film', 'events', 'just', 'first', 'book', 'Spanish', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'page', 'Hollywood', 'play', 'book', 'given', 'series', 'sequels', 'certainly', 'enough', 'interesting', 'material', 'books', 'sustain', 'several', 'movies.The', 'Fox', 'International', 'DVD', 'Regions', '1', '4', 'scene', 'selection', 'features', 'language', 'tracks', 'Spanish', 'Castellano', 'Portuguese', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'Portuguese']",N/A

The continual violence is tactfully handled. I can't recall so many bods succumbing to death by blade in one film. None of the stabbing and slitting is dwelt upon gratuitously. It feels right. Mortensen(Indian Runner/History of Violence)as usual, looks the part, as does everyone else. The humdrum business of soldiery, the shrugging off of demands upon his courage, the deferral of romance. The intrigues of the Spanish Court and the offenses of the Inquisition and the fear it engendered, are all caught. Velasquez's, 'Water Carrier' and ,'Surrender at Breda' are nice touches amongst all the props, but serve as little else! I did enjoy that Bunuel styled moment at Breda when the large number of staff freeze as if posing for Diego Velasquez's pleasure. Though it's somewhat cute, respect to Velasquez is appropriate, given the cool recording of the court and his optical fidelity, qualities the film revels in. Much of the lighting of interiors which bathe only a few figures in claustrophobic pools of chiaroscuro, are inspired by the humanist element of Baroque painting epitomised by Rembrandt and the Spanish masters.The battles scenes, the nature of warefare in the C17th are fascinating and unprecedented. Given the wide sweep the film assumes, it's little wonder that we don't feel the actors, even at their most intimate exchanges. That's the price paid here for epic ambition.

Sardrena,"[0, 0]","Based on a series of novels from prolific author Arturo Perez-Reverte, this film is a swashbuckler about the adventures of Spanish soldier Diego Alatriste and his ward during the dying days of the Spanish Empire.  The very idea of a Spanish swashbuckler is refreshing - generally Spaniards are seen eagerly impaling themselves on Errol Flynn's flailing foils.In an equally interesting casting coup, Viggo Mortensen (who has a B.A. in Spanish) stars as the tough swordsman.  Mortensen's words are few, his Spanish rather mushy.  Though the production values in this film are excellent, one major distraction is Alatriste's hat.  It might be accurate for the period, but the enormous piece of millinary makes Mortensen look like a giant mushroom.One big problem for English-speaking viewers of Perez-Reverte film adaptations is deciphering Spain's political history.  Alatriste is no exception.  If it compells the viewer to review a little Spanish history, great; I suspect that it will leave quite a few scratching their heads however.The film's greatest weakness - alluded to in other reviews - is that this film tries to cram pieces of the series of novels into one film.  Consequently, the film feels choppy and disjointed.There is a femme fatale in the film, which I suspect Perez-Reverte wrote as an homage to Milady De Winter of Dumas' The Three Musketeers, but... casting is vital, and this is another weak point.  The child who portrays that character has strong presence and mature flintiness, but her adult counterpart is weak.Despite all of these flaws, Alatriste is an unusual cinematic experience.

This film takes for granted that we already know something of the era's Spanish political, literary and military history. Even Spaniards found this movie confusing, so what hope do we foreign viewers have?Mortensen is fine in the title role, though the Argentine Spanish of his youth occasionally creeps through the European accent he learned for the film.In fact, the whole cast is good, but they're trapped in a hopeless script that leaps over plot points too fast while still somehow remaining plodding and dull.

Too much of substance and pleasure to the reader is left out.  The whole comes off as if it were ""made for TV.""  Perhaps it was.  The books are wonderful and exciting however, and this movie is good enough of a first pass to earn another stab at it by a superior production.  I think however that Viggo will not be bested by any other.  An actor of his caliber is needed for the cryptic and laconic Alatriste.On the plus side, the sets and scenery and costumes are fantastically real.  No doubt when they were filming in the Palacio Real in Madrid-- they were there.  If not then I am most surprised.  The harquebuses, the swords, the perpetual presence of the main gauche blade-- all were required and all were present.I only have modest Spanish so we used the English subtitles.  The subtitles were sufficient.  They lack the poetry of the English translation of these books, which have a fine style all in themselves; and yet they were adequate.  They coincided well with the content and listening to the movie in Spanish is absolutely pleasurable and should be mandatory for the viewer.  I loathe dubbing and this was mercifully not available.Viggo was the best actor, as one might expect. The rest of the cast were fit and capable insofar as the abbreviated story structure allowed them to unfold.  Unfortunately that was not as much as a reader of the series would desire.  All in all then, unsatisfactory to a reader of the series but good enough to enjoy and wish for more.

Based on the first three books of our eponymous hero Captain Alatriste (Viggo Mortenson), this is a swashbuckler from start to finish. It is also a sort of Spanish history lesson, it kicks off in 1622 and the fighting in Flanders, but soon jumps back to Spain and continues with the jumping all the way through.It also has a love interest or two and some darn fine acting. At one point Alatriste is told `You must change mare, the saddle is already occupied' - indicating his chosen bed mate is now seriously off limits. The attention to period detail is excellent and the costumes stunning, this is a film that has had a lot of money thrown at it, That may also be the problem it is just too ambitious and some may feel too long, as it runs to 135 minutes. That is not normally a problem, but with the constant jumps in the plot unless you are really hooked or committed, you may find your attention starting to wander, I watched over two sittings so was not too bothered. The fight scenes are really realistic, especially with so much use of daggers and swords, they do not stint on the blood spurts and it is not all trendy `300' graphics type blood either, but good old fashioned `hide behind the sofa' stuff.The tale is sprawling, but the emotions come across as very real. There is a lot of emphasis on honour, loyalty, love and patriotism. Director Agustin Diaz Yanez has made a good fist of trying to pull the books together, but maybe would have benefitted from doing three films instead of this encyclopaedic one. It is in Spanish with some very good sub titles, there is a bit of French too but nothing to fret about. If you like a bit of an historical swash buckler with some love and gore thrown in then you should give it a go - but best to go rental.",4,"The Spanish Inquisition, Love, Betrayal, Wars and Huge Hats!",1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1884,"['sprawling', 'mess', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'way', 'short', 'however', 'still', 'ruddy', 'good', 'Based', 'first', 'three', 'books', 'eponymous', 'hero', 'Captain', 'Alatriste', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'swashbuckler', 'start', 'finish', 'also', 'sort', 'Spanish', 'history', 'lesson', '1622', 'fighting', 'Flanders', 'soon', 'jumps', 'back', 'Spain', 'jumping', 'way', 'through.It', 'also', 'love', 'interest', 'two', 'darn', 'fine', 'acting', 'one', 'point', 'Alatriste', 'told', 'must', 'change', 'mare', 'saddle', 'already', 'occupied', 'indicating', 'chosen', 'bed', 'mate', 'now', 'seriously', 'limits', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'excellent', 'costumes', 'stunning', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'money', 'thrown', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'problem', 'just', 'too', 'ambitious', 'may', 'feel', 'too', 'long', '135', 'minutes', 'not', 'normally', 'problem', 'constant', 'jumps', 'plot', 'are', 'really', 'hooked', 'committed', 'may', 'find', 'attention', 'starting', 'wander', 'watched', 'over', 'two', 'sittings', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bothered', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'realistic', 'especially', 'so', 'much', 'use', 'daggers', 'swords', 'do', 'not', 'stint', 'blood', 'spurts', 'not', 'trendy', '300', 'graphics', 'type', 'blood', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'hide', 'sofa', 'stuff.The', 'tale', 'sprawling', 'emotions', 'come', 'very', 'real', 'lot', 'emphasis', 'honour', 'loyalty', 'love', 'patriotism', 'Director', 'Agustin', 'Diaz', 'Yanez', 'made', 'good', 'fist', 'trying', 'pull', 'books', 'together', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'doing', 'three', 'films', 'instead', 'encyclopaedic', 'one', 'Spanish', 'very', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'bit', 'French', 'too', 'nothing', 'fret', 'about', 'like', 'bit', 'historical', 'swash', 'buckler', 'love', 'gore', 'thrown', 'then', 'should', 'give', 'go', 'best', 'go', 'rental']",N/A
649614,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005JPF9,Trevor Willsmer,"[8, 11]","Spain's most expensive film to date, Alatriste is the kind of film that, in theory at least, is right up my alley: a historical epic about a professional soldier in the various Spanish Wars of the 17th century. Unfortunately rather than pick one of the five books with the character written at the time, the producers and writer-director Agustin Diaz Yanes bizarrely try to fill all of them into a 145-minute film, which strangely enough doesn't result in a fast-paced film that races from one half-realized scene to the next but rather results in lots of rather slow and sedate scenes that just happen without too much regard for what comes before or after them - they're just there before the film moves on to the next bit they've decided to use,  rather like the way early silent movies would bill themselves as Scenes From Ben-Hur or Scenes from MacBeth. It doesn't help that Viggo Mortensen underplays to the point of semi-comatose, leaving the film with no panache and no-one to really interest you: it's hard to shake the feeling that original choice Antonio Banderas could have put some much-needed fire into the part. It's very handsomely produced even if the budget constraints mean it's the kind of film where you never even see the cities its armies besiege, but when you're an hour into the film and the only moment that particularly impresses is a brief scene of tunnel-fighting in the trenches, you know this isn't going to get much better.The film sort of picks up around the middle with a fairly good ambush on board a galleon, and there's an okay battle scene before the film finishes (it doesn't really have a climax, it just sort of... stops), but it's one of those films where nothing really comes of it all. Plots are set in motion yet never resolved, conspiracies partially uncovered and then forgotten and characters reappear and disappear without ever leaving you that much the wiser or more entertained. There's absolutely no sense of momentum and not much of a story or character to compensate. You know about as much about the hero at the end as you did five minutes into the film, and nothing he does ever ultimately matters - indeed, for all the throat-cutting on display he doesn't even despatch his arch-enemy himself (though quite why the man is his arch-enemy is never really gone into either). With a better script and a more charismatic lead the film could have made something out of a hero who fights his way through life on the sidelines of history without ever making a real difference, but sadly this one leaves wondering why he merited a movie of his own. A TV series along the same lines as Sharpe would have been a much better idea than this rather dull outing.

649615,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPF9,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","""Alatriste"" stars Viggo Mortensen as the title role Diego Alatriste, a veteran soldier (and a hired assassin) in the service of Spanish King Philip IV. Known as ""Capitan,"" Alatriste, always faithful to his duty, witnesses the slow fall and decline of the empire while he himself continues to fight in the battlefield. The film also includes a romance between the hero and a beautiful actress Maria de Castro (Ariadna Gil) as well as many battles and swordfights.Set in the 17th century and based on Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte's best selling novels (five volumes so far), ""Alatriste"" is beautifully shot, but suffers the rushed pace and underdeveloped characters. Those who have knowledge of the Spanish history might feel differently, but to me the film's story unfolds too fast, sometimes leaping from one scene to another, giving almost no clue as to what really happened between them. The cast, all talented, do their best and deliver solid performances, but few of the characters are memorable.""Alatriste"" is said to be the most expensive film made in Spain and if you watch the film, you will not be surprised to hear that. The film is visually superb, with impressive production designs and costumes. Some of the film's images look as if taken directly from paintings (one scene recreates Diego Vel&aacute;zquez's ""The Surrender of Breda"" for instance). Also of note are the swordfights and battles depicted in the film, which give more emphasis to the brutality and violence of the fights. The swashbuckling in this film is not dancing; it means killing in the most brutal way.""Alatriste"" is not all that bad. It just needs much more time to be an emotionally involving film.
