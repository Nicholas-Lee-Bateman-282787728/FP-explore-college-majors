It really looks like a Korean VHS from the early 80s.  I love the opera and have two complete versions on CD and LP as well as DVD, but this is not the best introduction to the work.  Also, I am tired of ridiculous mis-casting of leading female roles for this and other operas such as Tristan und Isolde.  A building sized singer is not to be believed when there are so many other acceptable, if not believable leads.  The ""plot"" of Turandot is pretty silly anyway, but to expect any man to risk his life for this Turandot is stretching it way too much.  The tenor's ""Nessun Dorma"" seems rather hollow after ""winning the hand"" of the principle.  Has he fulfilled his fantasy of marrying a princess or given a mortgage on some property?I don't think I will add Mehta's production to my collection any time soon.",1,Turn my back on this Turandot,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,955,"['Perhaps', 'actual', 'complete', 'opera', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'project', 'documentary', 'muddiest', 'grainiest', 'image', 'quality', 'can', 'imagine', 'really', 'Korean', 'VHS', 'early', '80s', 'love', 'opera', 'have', 'two', 'complete', 'versions', 'CD', 'LP', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'not', 'best', 'introduction', 'work', 'Also', 'am', 'tired', 'ridiculous', 'mis-casting', 'leading', 'female', 'roles', 'other', 'operas', 'such', 'Tristan', 'Isolde', 'A', 'building', 'sized', 'singer', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'acceptable', 'not', 'believable', 'leads', 'plot', 'Turandot', 'pretty', 'silly', 'anyway', 'expect', 'man', 'risk', 'life', 'Turandot', 'stretching', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'tenor', 'Nessun', 'Dorma', 'rather', 'hollow', 'winning', 'hand', 'principle', 'fulfilled', 'fantasy', 'marrying', 'princess', 'given', 'mortgage', 'property', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'add', 'Mehta', 'production', 'collection', 'time', 'soon']",The Turandot Project

But I enjoyed this film because it illustrates how cross cultures can work together to create a beautiful production. Chinese opera itself is incredible, but in this film, a movie director is put in charge of the production. There is a big difference between stage lighting and film lighting. This film depicts resolving differences between crews. Not too much here about the singers, or the orchestra. Meta has a role, but it's basically about making this thing work. I especially enjoyed the army troops being used as extras.",4,Opera Planning,1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,617,"['Turandot', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'operas', 'being', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'Madam', 'Butterfly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'how', 'cross', 'cultures', 'can', 'work', 'together', 'create', 'beautiful', 'production', 'Chinese', 'opera', 'incredible', 'film', 'movie', 'director', 'put', 'charge', 'production', 'big', 'difference', 'stage', 'lighting', 'film', 'lighting', 'film', 'resolving', 'differences', 'crews', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'singers', 'orchestra', 'Meta', 'role', 'basically', 'about', 'making', 'thing', 'work', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'army', 'being', 'used', 'extras']",The Turandot Project
689462,A2MZXLN9TLP1R4,B00005Y79N,GLBT,"[24, 36]","There are so many facets to the events being described here that it's almost incredible how dull this documentary is. While they mention in passing that there are tensions between the Chinese government and the director of the opera, we never see any of that play out and it's never mentioned again. Similarly, we're told that this is a huge cultural event for China, to have such a lavish production of Turandot performed in Beijing, but we don't really see that reaction, aside from two or three very brief comments near the end.Then there are the tensions amongst the people putting the production together. Again, these are casually brought up, but there's no follow-through.Instead of following any of these potentially fascinating threads, the makers of the documentary instead show us footage of people walking through China, an opera singer complaining to someone we've never seen before that the hat she's supposed to wear looks stupid, etc. The whole documentary seems to lack any kind of focus.Several weeks ago, I saw &quot;Moon Over Broadway&quot; which is a documentary about the making of a musical (starring Carol Burnett). While the staging of an opera in Beijing is much more potentially interesting to me than a musical with Carol Burnett, &quot;Moon Over Broadway&quot; was a far more successful documentary than &quot;Turandot Project&quot; because it actually managed to get behind the scenes and to develop some of its ideas. There was an actual story taking place and we got to know several of the people involved in the production and we were able to experience their frustrations and conflicts. By the end of &quot;Turandot Project,&quot; by way of contrast, I felt like I had nothing invested in any of the people involved and had no real sense of who they were or why they were there or why this was important.&quot;Turandot Project&quot; isn't really worth your time unless you're a huge opera fan and willing to sit through a lot of pointless footage that's been slapped together at random.",3,"Interesting Topic, Dull Documentary",1055116800,"06 9, 2003",2003,2020,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'facets', 'events', 'being', 'described', 'here', 'almost', 'incredible', 'how', 'dull', 'documentary', 'mention', 'passing', 'are', 'tensions', 'Chinese', 'government', 'director', 'opera', 'never', 'see', 'play', 'out', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'Similarly', ""'re"", 'told', 'huge', 'cultural', 'event', 'China', 'have', 'such', 'lavish', 'production', 'Turandot', 'performed', 'Beijing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'reaction', 'aside', 'two', 'three', 'very', 'brief', 'comments', 'end.Then', 'are', 'tensions', 'amongst', 'people', 'putting', 'production', 'together', 'Again', 'are', 'casually', 'brought', 'up', 'follow-through.Instead', 'following', 'potentially', 'fascinating', 'threads', 'makers', 'documentary', 'instead', 'show', 'footage', 'people', 'walking', 'China', 'opera', 'singer', 'complaining', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'supposed', 'wear', 'looks', 'stupid', 'etc', 'whole', 'documentary', 'lack', 'kind', 'focus.Several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'saw', 'quot', 'Moon', 'Over', 'Broadway', 'quot', 'documentary', 'making', 'musical', 'starring', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'staging', 'opera', 'Beijing', 'much', 'more', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'musical', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'quot', 'Moon', 'Over', 'Broadway', 'quot', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Turandot', 'Project', 'quot', 'actually', 'managed', 'get', 'scenes', 'develop', 'ideas', 'was', 'actual', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'got', 'know', 'several', 'people', 'involved', 'production', 'were', 'able', 'experience', 'frustrations', 'conflicts', 'end', 'quot', 'Turandot', 'Project', 'quot', 'way', 'contrast', 'felt', 'had', 'nothing', 'invested', 'people', 'involved', 'had', 'real', 'sense', 'who', 'were', 'why', 'were', 'why', 'was', 'important.', 'quot', 'Turandot', 'Project', 'quot', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'time', ""'re"", 'huge', 'opera', 'fan', 'willing', 'sit', 'lot', 'pointless', 'footage', 'been', 'slapped', 'together', 'random']",The Turandot Project

689465,A5BAE3SEOGND5,B00005Y79N,"Robin Wolfson ""Reliza""","[33, 35]","Although &quot;Turandot&quot; was always my mother's favorite Puccini opera and, as a result, I grew up listening to it, I never quite understood it as I understood the other &quot;simpler&quot; works like Butterfly and Tosca (my personal favorite). But when I saw &quot;The Turandot Project&quot; on the Sundance channel this morning, all of a sudden everything became clear and I rushed to the computer to find the DVD.While the production itself is spectacular (300 extras, 50 ballet dancers, a contortionist from the Beijing Opera, and 300 soldiers from the local Chinese Army garrison), the documentary of what was involved in making the production actually happen is fascinating. I counted at least four languages (English, Italian, and Mandarin for most, but let's not forget the Viennese sound director with his own Mandarin/German translator) and a nearly unlimited number of egos.At the end of the documentary, while we hear Puccini's gorgeous music, the film cuts between the the actual production and the earlier shots of the various problems and rehearsals. I swear, watching that, I got actual goosebumps.In all, the production is the culmination of an astonishing effort dedicated towards one goal: the production of Puccini's masterpiece in its perfect setting, the Forbidden City. The production is a triumph of human dedication and cooperation and makes you think that maybe, in the end, there's hope for us all.",5,My mother's favorite Puccini,1037491200,"11 17, 2002",2002,1430,"['quot', 'Turandot', 'quot', 'was', 'always', 'mother', 'favorite', 'Puccini', 'opera', 'result', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'never', 'quite', 'understood', 'understood', 'other', 'quot', 'quot', 'Butterfly', 'Tosca', 'personal', 'favorite', 'when', 'saw', 'quot', 'Turandot', 'Project', 'quot', 'Sundance', 'channel', 'morning', 'sudden', 'everything', 'became', 'clear', 'rushed', 'computer', 'find', 'DVD.While', 'production', 'spectacular', '300', 'extras', '50', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'contortionist', 'Beijing', 'Opera', '300', 'soldiers', 'local', 'Chinese', 'Army', 'garrison', 'documentary', 'what', 'was', 'involved', 'making', 'production', 'actually', 'happen', 'fascinating', 'counted', 'least', 'four', 'languages', 'English', 'Italian', 'Mandarin', 'most', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Viennese', 'sound', 'director', 'own', 'Mandarin/German', 'translator', 'nearly', 'unlimited', 'number', 'egos.At', 'end', 'documentary', 'hear', 'Puccini', 'gorgeous', 'music', 'film', 'cuts', 'actual', 'production', 'earlier', 'shots', 'various', 'problems', 'rehearsals', 'swear', 'watching', 'got', 'actual', 'goosebumps.In', 'production', 'culmination', 'astonishing', 'effort', 'dedicated', 'towards', 'one', 'goal', 'production', 'Puccini', 'masterpiece', 'perfect', 'setting', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'production', 'triumph', 'human', 'dedication', 'cooperation', 'think', 'maybe', 'end', 'hope']",The Turandot Project
