1320757,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B00344EAQY,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[14, 19]","ZOMBIES OF MASS DESTRUCTION--what a spectacular title.  No way an After Dark Horrorfest entry could live up to such a masterful name, is there?  I had some pretty low expectations for this movie, and was somewhat surprised by the overall results.But after thinking about this movie for a couple of days, I've come to an important realization--I'm getting kinda tired of my zombie films being infected by this outbreak of comedy.  I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, but I'm starting to crave a totally serious, well-made undead film.  Something along the lines of the classics White Zombie, I Walked with a Zombie, or Night of the Living Dead.  I'd even settle for a brutal gorefest with a cardboard script, as long as it didn't cram politics down my throat in a completely obvious manner.  No teen romance, no trite morality tale, no transparent social criticisms, PLEASE!  It's getting overdone.Although I really enjoyed ZOMBIES OF MAS DESTRUCTION, it didn't totally avoid any of these cliches.  It did bring some immaculate gore--the heinous, blood-soaked flesh-chomping madness that is vital for this type of film.  The type of stuff that will make you shudder, wince, and eventually chuckle a bit to cope with the absolute mayhem.  Very well done in that regards.But there is plenty of gay humor that's worn pretty threadbare in this film.  It focuses too much on the town, family, and church's response to the gay couple, and it's completely overdone.Other stuff that came off pretty heavy handed--the media's reporting of the zombie crisis.  They quickly called it the work of terrorists.  This causes one idiot to become overly suspicious of his friendly Iranian neighbors.  Ok, ok, I get the real life implications, just thought it was forced upon us way too much.Still I thought ZOMD was very solid.  I actually liked it more than Zombieland even.  It didn't have anybody near as cool as Woody Harrelson though.  No sweet cameos either.  But this is must see stuff for the zombie fan.

1320759,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00344EAQY,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 4]","If a political commentary is to succeed, especially if it's a comedy, it cannot simply point at a target and pump it full of lead. It must also be clear on what it's speaking out against and why, and it must go about it thoughtfully and intelligently. The great failure of ""ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction"" is that aims at everyone, regardless of political orientation. It gives the appearance of an attack against conservative American values, but at the same time, it takes potshots at progressive ideas and the people who support them, so in the end, everyone looks weak, unfocused, and just plain stupid. Are the filmmakers saying, then, that politics in general turns us into zombies, like the ones roaming the streets feeding on flesh? They may be right in that some of us are mindless and ignorant, but they're wrong in that it applies to everyone.Part of the problem is that the zombies exist as a metaphor for far too many social issues, including racial intolerance, homophobia, ignorance of world affairs, terrorism, religious fanaticism, the electoral process, and family values. At a certain point, it becomes exhausting trying to figure out exactly what political point is being made. Another problem is that, so far as I can tell, most of the subplots would have been just fine without the presence of the zombie metaphor - it provides little apart from an excuse for relentless gore, which is so over the top that it surpasses humor and becomes monotonous. After it was over, I felt as if nothing of political or social relevance had been said, not even with the inclusion of obvious imagery and one-liners.The setting is a small community called Port Gamble, located on an island off the coast of Washington State. The white picket fences and neatly manicured lawns give it the appearance of Normal Rockwell Americana, but appearances can be deceiving. Stepping back into it are Tom Hunt (Doug Fahl) and Lance Murphy (Cooper Hopkins), a gay couple. They're visiting from New York in order to finally come out to Tom's mother, although Tom is deathly afraid of how she will react. In the meantime, he would prefer it if Lance acted straight. When we finally do meet Tom's mother, the zombie metaphor works its way in, although not successfully; you'd have to be pretty dense to not recognize a zombie when you see one, especially when it's someone you love.After the zombies have taken over, they find themselves locked in a church with regulars who, for reasons I can't begin to understand, have been unaware of the situation. Also in the church are two mayoral candidates (James Mesher and Linda Jensen) and a reverend (Bill Johns), who all debate the zombie situation in obvious political undertones, specifically as it relates to the status of American gays. I guess I got their point, although I can't say it was made cleverly. Ultimately, the characters of Tom and Lance do little more than perpetuate gay stereotypes, and not in a way that's funny, satirical, or politically motivated.Another important character is Frida Abbas (Janette Armand), an Iranian American everyone assumes is Iraqi. Immediately, we see what the filmmakers were getting at: She was born in this country, and yet everyone expects her to look, sound, and behave as if she were from the Middle East, including her father (Ali Hamedani), who wants her to be proud of her heritage. She crosses paths with Joe Miller (Russell Hodgkinson), who starts out as a mere conservative but devolves into a paranoid, delusional maniac once the zombies start attacking. It doesn't help that the TV continuously flashes news reports that the infection was probably the result of a terrorist plot. In due time, Joe has Frida tied to a chair in his basement, employing interrogation tactics that could never been seen as funny, not after all the news surrounding the appalling treatment of suspected terrorists in foreign countries.George A. Romero has proven time and time again that zombie movies are useful for social and political commentaries, so I'm puzzled as to why Kevin Hamedani and his co-writer Ramon Isao couldn't make ""ZMD"" work. Why did they feel that everyone should be a target for ridicule? The tone of their film is not one of message making but of nihilism, the sense that it's pointless to care about anything because there's nothing worth caring about. This is something that no amount of explicit gore can gloss over. I suppose this movie had all the right ingredients, but it's useless if no one bothers to mix them together properly. ""ZMD"" is not the clever satire it wanted to be; it's a silly, mean-spirited, brutal, uneven mess, lacking the ability to choose which side it wants to make fun of more.",3,For Those Who Like Their Satires Unfocused and Gory,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,4707,"['political', 'commentary', 'succeed', 'especially', 'comedy', 'can', 'not', 'simply', 'point', 'target', 'pump', 'full', 'lead', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'clear', 'what', 'speaking', 'out', 'why', 'must', 'go', 'thoughtfully', 'intelligently', 'great', 'failure', 'ZMD', 'Zombies', 'Mass', 'Destruction', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'political', 'orientation', 'appearance', 'attack', 'conservative', 'American', 'values', 'same', 'time', 'potshots', 'progressive', 'ideas', 'people', 'who', 'support', 'so', 'end', 'everyone', 'weak', 'unfocused', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Are', 'filmmakers', 'saying', 'then', 'politics', 'general', 'turns', 'zombies', 'ones', 'roaming', 'streets', 'feeding', 'flesh', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'are', 'mindless', 'ignorant', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'everyone.Part', 'problem', 'zombies', 'exist', 'metaphor', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'social', 'issues', 'including', 'racial', 'intolerance', 'homophobia', 'ignorance', 'world', 'affairs', 'terrorism', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'electoral', 'process', 'family', 'values', 'certain', 'point', 'exhausting', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'political', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'problem', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'subplots', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'fine', 'presence', 'zombie', 'metaphor', 'little', 'apart', 'excuse', 'relentless', 'gore', 'so', 'top', 'humor', 'monotonous', 'was', 'felt', 'nothing', 'political', 'social', 'relevance', 'had', 'been', 'said', 'not', 'even', 'inclusion', 'obvious', 'imagery', 'one-liners.The', 'setting', 'small', 'community', 'called', 'Port', 'Gamble', 'located', 'island', 'coast', 'Washington', 'State', 'white', 'picket', 'fences', 'neatly', 'manicured', 'lawns', 'give', 'appearance', 'Normal', 'Rockwell', 'Americana', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'Stepping', 'back', 'are', 'Tom', 'Hunt', 'Doug', 'Fahl', 'Lance', 'Murphy', 'Cooper', 'Hopkins', 'gay', 'couple', ""'re"", 'visiting', 'New', 'York', 'order', 'finally', 'come', 'out', 'Tom', 'mother', 'Tom', 'deathly', 'afraid', 'how', 'will', 'react', 'meantime', 'would', 'prefer', 'Lance', 'acted', 'straight', 'When', 'finally', 'do', 'meet', 'Tom', 'mother', 'zombie', 'metaphor', 'way', 'not', 'successfully', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'dense', 'not', 'recognize', 'zombie', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'someone', 'love.After', 'zombies', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'find', 'locked', 'church', 'regulars', 'who', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'understand', 'have', 'been', 'unaware', 'situation', 'Also', 'church', 'are', 'two', 'mayoral', 'candidates', 'James', 'Mesher', 'Linda', 'Jensen', 'reverend', 'Bill', 'Johns', 'who', 'debate', 'zombie', 'situation', 'obvious', 'political', 'undertones', 'specifically', 'status', 'American', 'gays', 'guess', 'got', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'made', 'cleverly', 'Ultimately', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Lance', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'perpetuate', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'not', 'way', 'funny', 'satirical', 'politically', 'motivated.Another', 'important', 'character', 'Frida', 'Abbas', 'Janette', 'Armand', 'Iranian', 'American', 'everyone', 'Iraqi', 'Immediately', 'see', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'getting', 'was', 'born', 'country', 'yet', 'everyone', 'look', 'sound', 'behave', 'were', 'Middle', 'East', 'including', 'father', 'Ali', 'Hamedani', 'who', 'be', 'proud', 'heritage', 'paths', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'Russell', 'Hodgkinson', 'who', 'out', 'mere', 'conservative', 'paranoid', 'delusional', 'maniac', 'zombies', 'start', 'attacking', ""n't"", 'help', 'TV', 'continuously', 'news', 'reports', 'infection', 'was', 'probably', 'result', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'due', 'time', 'Joe', 'Frida', 'tied', 'chair', 'basement', 'employing', 'interrogation', 'tactics', 'could', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'funny', 'not', 'news', 'surrounding', 'appalling', 'treatment', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'foreign', 'countries.George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'proven', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'useful', 'social', 'political', 'commentaries', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'why', 'Kevin', 'Hamedani', 'co-writer', 'Ramon', 'Isao', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'ZMD', 'work', 'Why', 'did', 'feel', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'target', 'ridicule', 'tone', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'message', 'making', 'nihilism', 'sense', 'pointless', 'care', 'anything', 'nothing', 'worth', 'caring', 'about', 'something', 'amount', 'explicit', 'gore', 'can', 'gloss', 'suppose', 'movie', 'had', 'right', 'ingredients', 'useless', 'one', 'mix', 'together', 'properly', 'ZMD', 'not', 'clever', 'satire', 'wanted', 'be', 'silly', 'mean-spirited', 'brutal', 'uneven', 'mess', 'lacking', 'ability', 'choose', 'side', 'make', 'fun', 'more']",N/A

A lot of times the biggest challenge the characters face in any zombie movie is getting along with each other. In ZMD, they tear it off at the arm and run with it making the first (as far as I know) political zombie comedy.The beginning of the movie has a great scene showing the uber-idyllic life that's going on on this island and is accompanied by some cheery music which gave me high hopes for the rest of the film. The first 30 minutes are a slow burn while the inhabitants go about their lives and zombies start appearing here and there in the background of the shots. Again, something that worked great.When the zombies finally come out in force, they never quite feel threatening, seeming more of a plot device to move the characters along their paths.But there is plenty of blood and gore to keep it going along, the effects are good and the comic bits mostly work with a couple of great one liners.

1320766,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B00344EAQY,Howard M. Kindel,"[1, 1]","A breath of fresh air - you name it.  This is not only a zombie comedy - it's a glorious parody of our years of madness (which are, of course, still going strong).  And, yes, it absolutely has a decidedly ""liberal"" slant - so what?  Satires always present a very definite point of view: how could you satirize something if you had no point of view against which to compare whatever it is you're satirizing?  And in this case, that point of view is reason, balance and sanity - which constitute the traditional point of view which gives satire its sting.  The residents of Port Gamble are already zombie-like in their ritualistic adherence to what they take to be the norms of society.  They go through their lives reacting blindly to outside stimuli without ever thinking about anything beyond the immediate environment.  So when they begin one by one turning into actual zombies, it's quite a while before anyone in town notices their transformation.  Once their transformation is all but complete, the comedic parody takes a terrifyingly gruesome turn.  The three main characters - Frida, daughter of an Iranian immigrant, and Tom and Lance, gay lovers who come to town so Tom can ""come out"" to his mother - find themselves having to fend off, not just an army of zombies, but the few remaining townspeople unaffected by whatever caused the mass transformation.  There is gore and mayhem enough to satisfy die-hard zombie fans, aided by one after another narrow escape from the clutches of death. And, through it all, the satire just keeps rolling along.This is a good zombie comedy, made absolutely enchanting if you appreciate the very pointed satire.  The acting is generally very good - particularly the Mayor,  the Preacher and the terrorist seeking Redneck.  The setting melds perfectly with the satire: a quaint picture postcard town with white picket fences populated by crazed zombies.  The dialogue, too, is perfectly suited to the surroundings and the events.  Plus there's the suspense of not knowing for sure who will survive and who will succumb to the zombie attack.

1320768,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B00344EAQY,John Milton,"[0, 0]","Another DVD that I was given over the festive period was Zombies of Mass Destruction, a horror comedy written and directed by Kevin Hamedani and starring Janette Armand, Doug Fahl and Cooper Hopkins.Described as a ""political zomedy"" and with a cover that doesn't scream high production value, I was a little wary when I started watching this. To be fair, I was pleasantly surprised! Filmed on location in Port Gamble, Washington, USA, the town seems like a picture perfect little slice of Americana and is an ideal location for proceedings as set out by Hamedani, who introduces commentary throughout Zombies of Mass Destruction on the darker side of America's conservative views: homophobia, right-wing Christianity; and Islamophobia and fear of terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11.Additionally, ZMD has what I would consider a cool retro soundtrack that very much put me in mind of themes from John Carpenter's movies.Much to my delight, the special effects were largely of the non-CGI variety and well done for the most part. Even when used, CGI was employed sparingly.Unfortunately, in the first quarter of the movie, ZMD goes for cheap scares with plenty of ""boo!"" moments which again, are reminiscent of 80's horror flicks. My disappointment didn't end there either... The performances from many of the actors was a little like the acting I'd expect to see on a US daytime soap. Janette Armand, Doug Fahl and Cooper Hopkins; and Bill Johns as the pious Reverend Haggis definitely propped up the whole affair.My major issue with ZMD is the fact that it tries to encompass too many themes within its sub 90 minute running time; and for me, making this a comedy was a mistake. ZMD could most definitely have been a competent horror film with some excellent social commentary but the message seems to get a little lost in some of the more comedic moments of the story.

Perron ""Philip""","[8, 9]","I saw this flick at the theater during the Horrorfest itself and right away I  knew we were going the horror-comedy route so I was like, okay, not my favorite but when done well it usually can top any real horror flick easily.We have some island community right off the coast in the Pacific Northwest, just like ""any small town"" in the US (or even Canada for that matter).  Instantly we find out that almost everyone in the town is a caricature or an exaggeration ... think the Simpsons humor.  We have a gay couple that are truly stereotypical where one is deciding to come out of the closet.  We have a crunchy-feely hippie middle aged woman.  We have an ethnic father from the ""old country"" (in this case Iran).  We have his teenage daughter who is a typical teenager (pop music lover, dresses like Britney Spears, dates a boy her old man doesn't like, etc.)  The next door neighbor family who seem to be clueless of what an American is.  The girl's rock and roll boyfriend.  The local pastor and his pulpit somewhat as a political tool.  The conservative mayor running for re-election.  Now take these characters and make them so exaggerated and poof, you have the Simpsons.  Only the teenage girl is ""normal"" and pretty much is the straight-man for the flick.The movie actually was pretty fun, the humor was great (from Archie Bunker ridiculous, to parody like the Simpsons), and the story seemed pretty cool.  Basically a zombie outbreak occurs, started by an Islamic terrorist group, and then the island goes into total chaos with jokes created within the extremes of the caricatures themselves.  The main jokes focus around the misunderstanding of the teenage girl's heritage and how the typical ""dumb"" American doesn't know the difference between a middle eastern American and a Middle Easterner.  Also, the gay couple gets it good from ""right wing"" crazies even though a zombie outbreak is occurring.  Anyone that happens to be on the right of the political spectrum are turned into either evil people or the typical uneducated religious, political, or sportman crazy.  Anyone on the left of spectrum are turned into stereotypical ethnics, gays, or hippies.  The only likeable character out of the whole film is actually the teenage girl who is the type of person you'd see at any McDonald's eating a burger with her boyfriend; in other words, completely normal.I loved the film when I watched it but looking back I slowly grew to not like it as much as I originally thought.  I guess making everyone a ""joke"" and throwing in the political/religious aspects of intolerance and showing the ""bad"" in people makes it not as enjoyable or even as funny as I thought.  And again, the point of the film was to show the ""bad"" in people but the ""bad"" that was shown was more of the exception and not more of the rule as the director/screenwriters presented.  So as a result, I have a bad taste in my mouth.  The funny aspects were more ripping the right-from-center folks and not seeing the gray in both political sides of the table but simply the black and white.Would I recommend this film?  Sure, watch it and you'll either love it, hate it, or feel as I do.  It really all depends on where you are politically.  If you are on the left, you'll love it.  If you are on the right, you'll hate it.  If you think both right and left are flawed but neither are ""evil"" as the film makers show, then you'll probably be right where I am.

I was initially a little surprised because I watched ZMD at the After Dark Film Fest and thought it was undeniably brilliant.  And by ""brilliant"" I mean pure zombie-shredding awesomeness.  But then again, Evil Dead 2 has some seriously negative reviews on Amazon, so go figure.  So hopefully this review will serve as an aid to help you determine whether you ought to click either the ""add to cart"" button or instead do a search for ""New Moon.""Like Evil Dead 2, Zombies of Mass Destruction doesn't fit neatly into one genre.  If you're the kind of movie geek I am, this is a huge buy sign.  It suggests to you that not only are you about to watch a gory Zombie movie, but also that the film has a shot at throwing in some nice surprises.  If, however, you're one of those people who, in order to enjoy a movie, your predetermined expectations about it must be met, then I daresay ""Twilight"" might be the better option for you.If you're the type of person who discovers cool movies and music on their own, then gets their friends into it, then I'd say you have a good chance of digging this flick.  If, however, you go see movies only after someone tells you it's good, you might want to wait until you get to college where it will suddenly be hip to see culty movies like Zombies of Mass Destruction.  Now, I'm not suggesting you have to be any kind of genius to get this flick, but be honest with yourself: Are you strictly a main-streamer? (e.g. You like movies about daywalking teen vampires).  Did you think the parking garage/Gypsy fight scene in DRAG ME TO HELL was ""unrealistic"" or ""lame"" or ""silly?""  If the answer to either of those questions is yes, then this flick may not be for you.  In fact, do that search for Kristen Stewart right now.The fact is, ZMD is at once a very scary and gory bloodbath, but also a perverse black comedy that could have been done by an unholy alliance between George A. Romero and  Matt Stone & Trey Parker.  The performances are compelling and the film balances its humor with its horror nicely.  But the political satire and the subtle homages to classic cult horror flicks never get in the way of telling a solid zombie survival story.But lastly and most importantly, if you've read this review and have failed to understand that I consider the insinuation that you might enjoy the ""Twilight"" series to be an egregious insult, then Zombies of Mass Destruction is definitely not for you.",5,Awesome Satirical Zombie Gorefest,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,2563,"['Zombies', 'Mass', 'Destruction', 'one', 'flicks', 'based', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'reading', 'here', 'people', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'was', 'initially', 'little', 'surprised', 'watched', 'ZMD', 'Dark', 'Film', 'Fest', 'thought', 'was', 'undeniably', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'mean', 'pure', 'zombie-shredding', 'awesomeness', 'then', 'again', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'seriously', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'so', 'go', 'figure', 'So', 'hopefully', 'review', 'will', 'serve', 'aid', 'help', 'determine', 'ought', 'click', 'either', 'add', 'cart', 'button', 'instead', 'do', 'search', 'New', 'Moon', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'Zombies', 'Mass', 'Destruction', ""n't"", 'fit', 'neatly', 'one', 'genre', ""'re"", 'kind', 'movie', 'geek', 'am', 'huge', 'buy', 'sign', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'watch', 'gory', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'also', 'film', 'shot', 'throwing', 'nice', 'surprises', 'however', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'order', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'predetermined', 'expectations', 'must', 'be', 'met', 'then', 'daresay', 'Twilight', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'option', 'you.If', ""'re"", 'type', 'person', 'who', 'cool', 'movies', 'music', 'own', 'then', 'friends', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', 'have', 'good', 'chance', 'digging', 'flick', 'however', 'go', 'see', 'movies', 'only', 'someone', 'good', 'might', 'want', 'wait', 'get', 'college', 'where', 'will', 'suddenly', 'be', 'hip', 'see', 'culty', 'movies', 'Zombies', 'Mass', 'Destruction', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'have', 'be', 'kind', 'genius', 'get', 'flick', 'be', 'honest', 'Are', 'strictly', 'main-streamer', 'e.g', 'movies', 'daywalking', 'teen', 'vampires', 'Did', 'think', 'parking', 'garage/Gypsy', 'fight', 'scene', 'DRAG', 'ME', 'TO', 'HELL', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'lame', 'silly', 'answer', 'questions', 'yes', 'then', 'flick', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fact', 'do', 'search', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'right', 'now.The', 'fact', 'ZMD', 'once', 'very', 'scary', 'gory', 'bloodbath', 'also', 'perverse', 'black', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'unholy', 'alliance', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'performances', 'are', 'compelling', 'film', 'humor', 'horror', 'nicely', 'political', 'satire', 'subtle', 'homages', 'classic', 'cult', 'horror', 'never', 'get', 'way', 'telling', 'solid', 'zombie', 'survival', 'story.But', 'lastly', 'most', 'importantly', ""'ve"", 'read', 'review', 'have', 'failed', 'understand', 'consider', 'insinuation', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Twilight', 'series', 'be', 'egregious', 'insult', 'then', 'Zombies', 'Mass', 'Destruction', 'definitely', 'not']",N/A

1320779,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B00344EAQY,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[7, 13]","Well, they can't all be winners.  This is the fifth of 2010's 8 Films To Die For that I've watched - and after several good entries, I was wondering when the let down would come.  It's particularly disappointing because, for the first half anyway, this film seemed to be going all the right directions.Now, I know this is a difficult film to judge, because for one it is a low-budget entry, and secondly it tackles several hot-button issues (ie, religion, racism, and politics).  Thus, it would be easy for me to just dismiss it as poor quality and pretentious liberal clap-trap.  But I do want to be fair . . .As I said, the first portion got off to a promising start.  For a low-budget film, the acting was pretty good, camera work, direction, editing all handled well.  I was starting to get my hopes up.And that first kill . . . WOW! It was quite out of the blue and done very well.  The moment the horror started, it was unrelenting.  Gorehounds will find much to love here - and the filmmakers show zero reservation, even setting up a sick joke involving the violent death of an 8-year old girl.  The film definitely features the most gruesome images of the festival this year  - and they were done expertly.  It was clear a lot of love went into the effects, and I appreciate that.  I also appreciate the performances out of the majority of the lead characters.Unfortunately, as the film enters its final third, it almost seemed like a different director took over.  Suddenly editing became very sloppy - performances began to suffer - and gaps in logic started to appear.Some of the characters took sudden, unrealistic turns.  For example (SPOILER ALERT) one of the political characters spent the majority of the film opposing hatred, knee-jerk racism, and guns - and in one scene she suddenly lifts a revolver and gleefully shoots her opponent.  In the final scene, she gives a speech echoing the ultra-conservative bent of George W.Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.  There was absolutely no setup for her character to make such a radical change. (END SPOILER)It's this kinds of inconsistency that plagues the final act of the film.  The filmmakers seemingly got sidetracked by their political jabs that the immediate story suffered.  And this, of course, is the second problem with the film - its feeble attempt at political satire.  With a name like ZOMBIES OF MASS DESTRUCTION, it is clear the filmmakers are bringing a particular baggage to the proceedings, and will be less concerned with a gripping narrative, and more interested in setting up scenarios where they can poke fun at various belief systems.This mainly comes in three different forms - 1) An Iranian girl who inevitably becomes the target of the local redneck father when terrorists are blamed for the outbreak.  2) The gay couple who are first trying to come out to one's mother, and later the target of the local preacher's attempt to convert. And 3)The two candidates for mayor.  Thus the filmmakers attempt to tackle racism, homophobia, and left/right politics all at once.  It's an ambitious idea, and unfortunately, one that doesn't quite come off.  There's nothing wrong with satire if you can handle it in a clever manner - but here, it fails.The reason is that the filmmakers resort to simple broad stereotypes.  The redneck is completely irrational, the preacher is ridiculously self-righteous, and the mayoral candidate is the epitome of Bush-ist politics.  The problem with such broad stereotypes is it divides your audience.  The left-leaning side will no doubt howl with glee at these ridiculous stereotypes, while conservatives will roll their eyes and disengage.  And all the while, the story fades into the backdrop as the true motive reveals itself, to laugh at and then dispatch these effigies of conservative sentiment.Were the second half of the film carried off as exceptionally as the first half, one might could overlook such obvious and broad stereotyping - but, as I said, the second half is an utter mess - so rather than a smart bit of satire, it just comes off as a childishly failed attempt at clever political wit.I think a better approach would have been to simply pick one of these political elements and flesh it out more fully.  I think a very effective comedy could have been made contrasting the war on zombies with the war on terror.  Too bad - its a missed opportunity, and one of the lesser entries in the 2010 Afterdark Horrorfest.",2,"Despite a well-polished opening act, the film devolves into a mess of failed political satire.",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,4442,"['Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'winners', 'fifth', '2010', '8', 'Films', 'Die', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'good', 'entries', 'was', 'wondering', 'when', 'let', 'down', 'would', 'come', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'first', 'half', 'anyway', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'right', 'directions.Now', 'know', 'difficult', 'film', 'judge', 'one', 'low-budget', 'entry', 'secondly', 'several', 'hot-button', 'issues', 'ie', 'religion', 'racism', 'politics', 'Thus', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'just', 'dismiss', 'poor', 'quality', 'pretentious', 'liberal', 'clap-trap', 'do', 'want', 'be', 'fair', '.As', 'said', 'first', 'portion', 'got', 'off', 'promising', 'start', 'low-budget', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'direction', 'editing', 'handled', 'well', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'hopes', 'first', 'kill', 'WOW', 'was', 'quite', 'blue', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'moment', 'horror', 'started', 'was', 'unrelenting', 'Gorehounds', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'love', 'here', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'zero', 'reservation', 'even', 'setting', 'up', 'sick', 'joke', 'involving', 'violent', 'death', '8-year', 'old', 'girl', 'film', 'definitely', 'most', 'gruesome', 'images', 'festival', 'year', 'were', 'done', 'expertly', 'was', 'clear', 'lot', 'love', 'went', 'effects', 'appreciate', 'also', 'appreciate', 'performances', 'majority', 'lead', 'characters.Unfortunately', 'film', 'final', 'third', 'almost', 'seemed', 'different', 'director', 'took', 'over', 'Suddenly', 'editing', 'became', 'very', 'sloppy', 'performances', 'began', 'suffer', 'gaps', 'logic', 'started', 'appear.Some', 'characters', 'took', 'sudden', 'unrealistic', 'turns', 'example', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'one', 'political', 'characters', 'spent', 'majority', 'film', 'opposing', 'hatred', 'knee-jerk', 'racism', 'guns', 'one', 'scene', 'suddenly', 'revolver', 'gleefully', 'shoots', 'opponent', 'final', 'scene', 'speech', 'echoing', 'ultra-conservative', 'bent', 'George', 'W.Bush', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'was', 'absolutely', 'setup', 'character', 'make', 'such', 'radical', 'change', 'END', 'SPOILER', 'kinds', 'inconsistency', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'seemingly', 'got', 'sidetracked', 'political', 'jabs', 'immediate', 'story', 'suffered', 'course', 'second', 'problem', 'film', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'political', 'satire', 'name', 'ZOMBIES', 'OF', 'MASS', 'DESTRUCTION', 'clear', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'bringing', 'particular', 'baggage', 'proceedings', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'concerned', 'gripping', 'narrative', 'more', 'interested', 'setting', 'up', 'scenarios', 'where', 'can', 'poke', 'fun', 'various', 'belief', 'systems.This', 'mainly', 'three', 'different', 'forms', '1', 'Iranian', 'girl', 'who', 'inevitably', 'target', 'local', 'redneck', 'father', 'when', 'terrorists', 'are', 'blamed', 'outbreak', '2', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'first', 'trying', 'come', 'out', 'one', 'mother', 'later', 'target', 'local', 'preacher', 'attempt', 'convert', '3', 'two', 'candidates', 'mayor', 'Thus', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'tackle', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'left/right', 'politics', 'once', 'ambitious', 'idea', 'unfortunately', 'one', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'off', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'satire', 'can', 'handle', 'clever', 'manner', 'here', 'fails.The', 'reason', 'filmmakers', 'resort', 'simple', 'broad', 'stereotypes', 'redneck', 'completely', 'irrational', 'preacher', 'ridiculously', 'self-righteous', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'epitome', 'Bush-ist', 'politics', 'problem', 'such', 'broad', 'stereotypes', 'audience', 'left-leaning', 'side', 'will', 'doubt', 'howl', 'glee', 'ridiculous', 'stereotypes', 'conservatives', 'will', 'roll', 'eyes', 'disengage', 'while', 'story', 'backdrop', 'true', 'motive', 'reveals', 'laugh', 'then', 'dispatch', 'effigies', 'conservative', 'sentiment.Were', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'carried', 'off', 'as', 'exceptionally', 'first', 'half', 'one', 'might', 'could', 'overlook', 'such', 'obvious', 'broad', 'stereotyping', 'said', 'second', 'half', 'utter', 'mess', 'so', 'rather', 'smart', 'bit', 'satire', 'just', 'off', 'childishly', 'failed', 'attempt', 'clever', 'political', 'wit.I', 'think', 'better', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'pick', 'one', 'political', 'elements', 'flesh', 'out', 'more', 'fully', 'think', 'very', 'effective', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'contrasting', 'war', 'zombies', 'war', 'terror', 'Too', 'bad', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'one', 'lesser', 'entries', '2010', 'Afterdark', 'Horrorfest']",N/A

1320781,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B00344EAQY,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[0, 0]","Zombies of Mass Destruction is a 2010, ""zombie comedy"" directed by Kevin Hamedani and was released under the, ""8 Films to Die For"" collective.  The film takes place in Port Gamble, Washington, and bisects into both the story of a man bringing his boyfriend home from the east coast to admit his homosexuality to his mother, and the story of an Iranian-American woman battling stereotypes in a town teeming with ignorant locals.  The intent, here, was to tackle both subjects with humor.If you're familiar with 8FTDF, you no doubt know what to expect concerning budget, and the same issues apply here.  Sort of.  While the acting mostly fell flat, I was surprised to see that the special effects for the film were executed really well.  A couple of the kill scenes were original and definitely violent, but the real rewards came in the mindless gore that popped up randomly throughout the project.  The eyeball scene, for example, was goofy, but so fun to watch.  If I were grading this movie on special effects alone, I'd give it four stars.I just couldn't get into the movie, though.  The design of the gay couple was so stereotypical that it became unrealistic almost immediately.  Because of this, I thought their involvement dragged like a broken leg for the film's entirety, which is exhausting.  Towards the end, the, ""I'M WITH HIM"" half of the duo seemed to start dialing it in, but for me, it was already too late.  I also found that the middle-eastern, political focus of the film was tritely saturated, as well.  I understand that it's seemingly relevant to our times, but the attempt here came across as merely surface fodder for the dim, and hardly made any statements.Still, as I mentioned before, the proprietors of this film weren't swimming in cash, so you get what you get, and that's fine.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film to anyone, especially when there are funnier zombie films out there like Dead Alive, Shaun of the Dead, and even Fido.  But, if you're bored and feel like watching Gorgeous Frida barefoot her way around your television for an evening, I wouldn't really blame you.

This movie used sociopolitical statements and tried to turn them into jokes and most them went over like a lead balloon. There are a few good moments in the movie, just not enough. There is way too much gore and blood splatter, it got old fast. This movie could have been much funnier, but it isn't a total loss.
