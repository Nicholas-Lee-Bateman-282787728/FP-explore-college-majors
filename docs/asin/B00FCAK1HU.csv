The first two DVDs here are from the NYC concert and feature full sets from Police, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, etc.  The second disk is the theater documentary in it's full 3 hour format and adds Bruce Springsteen and U2 to the mix.  The other sets quite frankly I haven't bothered with yet.  But they do feature some sets down the years up to and including Mumford & Sons at the 2012 show.

Re-watching these concerts brings back great memories. The video quality is very VHS, but it seems to increase the awesome. At one point Martha Quinn audio interrupts Peter Gabriel's performance.A memory I have is Tracy Chapman singing &#34;Don't Give Up&#34; with Peter Gabriel, but I haven't found it on this set. Too bad, as it was an epic point for me.  Included, though, is the equally excellent &#34;The River&#34; with Sting and Springsteen.",5,Great set!,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,568,"['Received', 'Christmas', 'gift.A', 'high', 'point', 'lifetime', 'attending', 'concerts', 'was', 'Amnesty', 'Concert', 'Philadelphia', 'Re-watching', 'concerts', 'back', 'great', 'memories', 'video', 'quality', 'very', 'VHS', 'increase', 'awesome', 'one', 'point', 'Martha', 'Quinn', 'audio', 'interrupts', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'performance.A', 'memory', 'have', 'Tracy', 'Chapman', 'singing', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Give', 'Up', '34', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'set', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'epic', 'point', 'Included', 'equally', 'excellent', '34', 'River', '34', 'Sting', 'Springsteen']",Released: The Human Rights Concerts 1986-1998
