760128,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B00009YXIF,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[6, 12]","Things were bound to cool down after the action-packed third volume of this popular series revolving around Tsukasa, a player trapped and unable to log out of ""The World,"" the most popular online community/RPG of the near future.This volume starts of with a recap of the previous one: several players have formed teams to search for the ""Key of the Twilight,"" a legendary item that, rumor has it, could reset The World or free Tsukasa. Several players were transported to an alternate dimension and found a character called ""The Broken Man"" spouting nearly-incoherent clues about the Key. At the disc's end, Tsukasa sacrifices himself to free buddies Mimiru and Bear, and lies lifeless on the ground.The players sit and speculate after the recap: what has happened to Tsukasa? Who is The Broken Man? And what, if anything, significance did his babbling have? Meanwhile, we find a shell-shocked Tsukasa sitting back in his hidden world, dazed out and whimpering while picking on a teddy bear, the strange female voice continuing to speak to him.This may be the slowest disc of the series, which is saying a lot considering the dripping-molasses pace this series offers. There is indeed very little in terms of physical action, and surprisingly, very little in terms of advancing the series. The disc does contribute to the overall feel by examining BT, one of the sub-main characters who hedges the line between good and bad. She finds herself at the mercy of two players, but is ""saved"" by Tsukasa; pangs of guilt over her views and treatment of Tsukasa make her open up to him. Similarly, her growing affections for the likeable Crim are deflected when she offers to meet in the real world. She sits sobbing as he leaves, her online character emotionally distressed by the lack of real-life interaction. This makes a great statement about the feel of the series: some can still make out the line between the virtual World and the real World; others are beginning to lose that distinction.A semi-major plot event occurs at the end of the disc, with no major ramifications to the rest of the series other than a set-up for a character to change allegiances later in the story.A slow, slow disc, even for "".hack"" fans.

760131,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B00009YXIF,Kellyannl,"[2, 2]","Containing some of the series' best-scripted episodes, this whole volume is proof that SIGN is at it's best during quiet moments when we learn more about the characters.  After the intense cliffhanger of the last volume is resolved, things slow down a little.  It's the calm before the storm as the next volume will start heading the party towards it's inevitable confrontation with The Voice tormenting Tsukasa.Tsukasa himself takes a backburner to some extent once we find out what has happened to him, as these episodes are largely devoted to character studies of the two women of the party - B.T. and Subaru.  As the DVD jacket suggests, Crim also plays a large role, his relationships with the women acting as a catalyst for revealations about them.Crim is a decidedly good man, but he's only human like everyone else.  In this volume, we find out that offscreen he's committed the faux pas of giving B.T. mixed signals by meeting with her in the real world in spite of the fact that he already knows he's not going to return her blatant interest in him.  This leads to an uncomfortable scene in which he's forced to gently but firmly refuse to see her again offline, leaving a humiliated B.T. to struggle between any loyalty she owes Bear and her jealousy of Subaru, who she knows has a bond with Crim that she never will.Subaru, meanwhile, pays for her championship of Tsukasa as she watches the Crimson Knights disband before her eyes, throwing her into The World as most players know it for the first time.  At first Crim is there to protect her, thoroughly enjoying the knight in shining armour act, but in a case of really lousy timing his job forces him to leave again while she's still overwhelmed.  All he can do is try as best he can to lovingly prepare his friend for what he knows she has facing her in his absence.  One of the most memorable sequences in the series, Subaru's first day in The World on her own is both sad and inspiring, including a glimpse of her in the real world as she's comforted by an empathetic Tsukasa that explains her aversion to combat and why she doesn't just stay offline while Crim's away.Incredibly deep and nuanced, Sign just keeps getting better and better.",4,A quiet interlude,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,2208,"['Containing', 'series', 'best-scripted', 'episodes', 'whole', 'volume', 'proof', 'SIGN', 'best', 'quiet', 'moments', 'when', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'intense', 'cliffhanger', 'last', 'volume', 'resolved', 'things', 'slow', 'down', 'little', 'calm', 'storm', 'next', 'volume', 'will', 'start', 'heading', 'party', 'inevitable', 'confrontation', 'Voice', 'tormenting', 'Tsukasa.Tsukasa', 'backburner', 'extent', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'episodes', 'are', 'largely', 'devoted', 'character', 'studies', 'two', 'women', 'party', 'B.T', 'Subaru', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'Crim', 'also', 'large', 'role', 'relationships', 'women', 'acting', 'catalyst', 'revealations', 'them.Crim', 'decidedly', 'good', 'man', 'only', 'human', 'everyone', 'else', 'volume', 'find', 'out', 'committed', 'faux', 'pas', 'giving', 'B.T', 'mixed', 'signals', 'meeting', 'real', 'world', 'spite', 'fact', 'already', 'not', 'going', 'return', 'blatant', 'interest', 'uncomfortable', 'scene', 'forced', 'gently', 'firmly', 'refuse', 'see', 'again', 'offline', 'leaving', 'humiliated', 'B.T', 'struggle', 'loyalty', 'Bear', 'jealousy', 'Subaru', 'who', 'bond', 'Crim', 'never', 'will.Subaru', 'meanwhile', 'pays', 'championship', 'Tsukasa', 'Crimson', 'Knights', 'disband', 'eyes', 'throwing', 'World', 'most', 'players', 'know', 'first', 'time', 'first', 'Crim', 'there', 'protect', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'knight', 'shining', 'armour', 'act', 'case', 'really', 'lousy', 'timing', 'job', 'forces', 'leave', 'again', 'still', 'overwhelmed', 'can', 'do', 'try', 'best', 'can', 'lovingly', 'prepare', 'friend', 'what', 'facing', 'absence', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'series', 'Subaru', 'first', 'day', 'World', 'own', 'sad', 'inspiring', 'including', 'glimpse', 'real', 'world', 'comforted', 'empathetic', 'Tsukasa', 'aversion', 'combat', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'stay', 'offline', 'Crim', 'away.Incredibly', 'deep', 'nuanced', 'Sign', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better']",.hack//SIGN: Omnipotence -Volume 4

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[0, 0]",".Hack//SIGN - Vol. 4: Omnipotence contains episodes 15 - 18 of the fascinating series about a virtual reality online game called The World and the characters trying to unravel a strange mystery.I watch these DVD's straight through; the story is so absorbing.  The backgrounds are clever and enchanting, and especially realistic at twilight.  The colors in the sky are gorgeous.  I confess I have a bit of a crush on Bear.  I also really admire the Silver Knight and feel Subaru is in the wrong.Episode 15 - ""Depth"" - Tsukusa ""dies"" a painful and terrifying death within the World. His screams are something awful. Tossed out of the Twilight Eye, Mimiru and Bear are worried about Tsukasa.  Mimiru is overjoyed when he makes his appearance again, but he has forgotten an important conversation they had.Meanwhile, Lady Subaru finds out that Silver Knight has been keeping messages from her to prevent her from seeing Tsukasa.  Subaru finds Tsukasa and they share a special moment.  We see she is deeply in love with him, and he is beginning to have feelings for her too.Episode 16 - ""Conflict"" - BT is shot down by Krim (in his ""The King and I"" outfit) as he says their tryst in the real world was a mistake, but he would like to be partners with her in the game.  She is very hurt.  We learn a little more about BT in this episode.  She and Tsukasa open up a little to each other.Episode 17 - ""Declaration"" - The Silver Knight and Subaru argue about the true purpose of the Crimson Knights in the World.  He wants to stop and bind malicious players to protect other players in the world.  Subaru does not like the vigilante style and insists on only sending stern e-mails to players who flout the rules.  The conflict between Silver Knight and Tsukasa reaches a head, and she takes drastic action.Episode 18 - ""Recollection"" - A ""princess"" with no knights to protect her, Subaru is vulnerable and shy in the World.  Crim comes to his lady's rescue.  He gives her some good advice to boost her self-confidence.  Unfortunately, Crim cannot always be with Subaru, and she is attacked.  Weak and hurt, she finds Tsukasa and falls into his arms.In this episode, we learn who Subaru really is in the real world - a bit of a shocker.",4,Serious story development,1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,2226,"['.Hack//SIGN', 'Vol', '4', 'Omnipotence', '15', '18', 'fascinating', 'series', 'virtual', 'reality', 'online', 'game', 'called', 'World', 'characters', 'trying', 'unravel', 'strange', 'mystery.I', 'watch', 'DVD', 'straight', 'story', 'so', 'absorbing', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'clever', 'enchanting', 'especially', 'realistic', 'twilight', 'colors', 'sky', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'confess', 'have', 'bit', 'crush', 'Bear', 'also', 'really', 'admire', 'Silver', 'Knight', 'feel', 'Subaru', 'wrong.Episode', '15', 'Depth', 'Tsukusa', 'dies', 'painful', 'terrifying', 'death', 'World', 'screams', 'are', 'something', 'awful', 'Tossed', 'Twilight', 'Eye', 'Mimiru', 'Bear', 'are', 'worried', 'Tsukasa', 'Mimiru', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'appearance', 'again', 'forgotten', 'important', 'conversation', 'had.Meanwhile', 'Lady', 'Subaru', 'out', 'Silver', 'Knight', 'been', 'keeping', 'messages', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'Tsukasa', 'Subaru', 'Tsukasa', 'share', 'special', 'moment', 'see', 'deeply', 'love', 'beginning', 'have', 'feelings', 'too.Episode', '16', 'Conflict', 'BT', 'shot', 'down', 'Krim', 'King', 'outfit', 'tryst', 'real', 'world', 'was', 'mistake', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'partners', 'game', 'very', 'hurt', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'BT', 'episode', 'Tsukasa', 'open', 'up', 'little', 'other.Episode', '17', 'Declaration', 'Silver', 'Knight', 'Subaru', 'argue', 'true', 'purpose', 'Crimson', 'Knights', 'World', 'stop', 'bind', 'malicious', 'players', 'protect', 'other', 'players', 'world', 'Subaru', 'not', 'vigilante', 'style', 'insists', 'only', 'sending', 'stern', 'e-mails', 'players', 'who', 'flout', 'rules', 'conflict', 'Silver', 'Knight', 'Tsukasa', 'head', 'drastic', 'action.Episode', '18', 'Recollection', 'princess', 'knights', 'protect', 'Subaru', 'vulnerable', 'shy', 'World', 'Crim', 'lady', 'rescue', 'good', 'advice', 'boost', 'self-confidence', 'Unfortunately', 'Crim', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'Subaru', 'attacked', 'Weak', 'hurt', 'Tsukasa', 'arms.In', 'episode', 'learn', 'who', 'Subaru', 'really', 'real', 'world', 'bit', 'shocker']",.hack//SIGN: Omnipotence -Volume 4

Like Rashomon, they offer use a set of varying viewpoints and challenge us to form our own opinion.  In this, the video series, the characters believe that a secret artifact, the Key of the Twilight, hold the means of solving the mysteries of the virtual universe.  For Tsukasa, who is trapped in the game while his body lies comatose, it is the promise of a return to a normal life.For others, the key spells power, or wealth.  But in a sense, it is really a red herring, distracting the viewer from the more subtle dramatic interplay taking place among the characters.  For this series isn't really about the game, but those who play it.  For some it has come to replace live, and for others it is only a game they play for fun.  Who is right? - we are offered only vague signs and portents to make our own decision.In this set of episodes the real story is the unfolding and development of two characters that previously held lesser roles - BT and Subaru.  BT's avatar it one of cold, self-centered sensuality - perhaps, though, it hides a deep neediness and loneliness.  Confronted with Sora, who only sees other players as tools, she finds a reflection of herself - and is disquieted by it.Subaru, however, takes her place as one of the heroines of the story as her feelings for Tsukasa put her in direct conflict with many of the Crimson Knights.  The results appear disastrous, but in the end we are given a flash of understanding about both her own bravery and what underlies it.  We are reminded vividly for the second time that The World is only a reflection of the characters' realities.Is there a tragedy coming?  Or transformation and healing?  For now we are only  given the delicate underpinnings of an increasingly complex story.  When this series started I expected a pleasant presentation of adventures in a virtual role playing game.
