Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country, Big Lebowski, etc., are fantastic films, particularly with a strong noir-ish theme.  These movies have very richly developed characters who find themselves in wonderfully detailed and parallel-ly intertwined stories.  The real driver, IMHO, is that the stories suck the viewer in, and really make you want to know what will happen next...the other driver is that the intertwining of the stories is usually artfully done.  Meaning that we're usually dealing with several independent plot lines of dubious characters doing stupid things that eventually intersect, and amplify the stupidity of the situations they're in.  So to Burn...while on the surface it has all of these elements, its lacking substance.  I'm having difficulty articulating exactly why, but there's something of substance clearly missing - the ""so what"" factor.  The acting is generally good with Cohen-esque strange characters.  The plot has several in parallel that do intersect in a strange way.  But it all feels bland and doesn't have the certain extra spice to make it more meaningful.

1204782,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001IZNIZU,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I think it's pretty well decided on that the Coen brothers produce movies you either love or hate.  They have their very own style and they continue to stay true to that style; but like anything or anyone, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  `Fargo' works, as does `No Country for Old Men'; two films that couldn't be any more different yet are surprisingly very much the same.  My love affair with the Coen's has been spotty to say the least.  I usually tend to adore their more prestigious work, yet I find myself distanced from their more commercial outings (the fact that they actually directed `Intolerable Cruelty' makes me rather sick).I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  It looked rather funny when I saw the trailers, but the film received such awfully sub par reviews that I was nervous.  Then awards season rolls around and it pops up on the NBR's top ten, and then it starts snagging Globe and BAFTA nominations and I'm scratching my head thinking `this wasn't supposed to be that good'.I finally saw it.It wasn't that good.Okay, here's the problem; it's not `that' funny.  Here's another problem; it's not `that' intelligent.  Everyone prides the Coen's on their clever mix of humor and brains, making very adult, very mature and very intelligent comedies.  This one isn't really funny or smart.The film tells a convoluted (but it's not as `twisty, turny' as it thinks it is) tale of CIA analyst Osbourne Cox who has recently been fired.  Under emotional stress he decides to take time to write his memoirs.  Meanwhile his wife Katie is having an affair with Harry Pfarrer, a federal marshal married to a children's author.  Urged by her lawyer to get a copy of her husband's financials before pursuing divorce, Katie accidentally copies his memoirs and when they wind up laying around on a gym changing room floor two airheads think they've stumbled onto some secret CIA `stuff'.  Attempting to blackmail Cox into paying over some much needed cash, these two nitwits wind up getting mixed in some serious `stuff'.The film is very easy to follow, despite all the characters and plot twists.  Like I said, they're not as convoluted as they think they are being.  As far as the acting is concerned, it is really sporadic.  Some of it is great, some of it is bland and some of it is horrendous.Brad Pitt is comedic genius here, playing the densest character in the bunch.  This allows him to just create a purely comedic character, with no baggage or additional strings to pull.  He's just funny, and he should have had a lot more screen time.  Richard Jenkins is also very endearing and stands out amongst the rest of the cast, mainly because he's the only character who isn't an idiot.That's another problem with this movie.  There is really not one intelligent person in the entire film.  Everyone you meet is dumber than the last person you met, so they all wind up being just as ridiculous as the last.  A few morons sifted into a comedy can help pepper in the fun a bit, but when there is not one person who seems remotely intelligent it can make for a rather uninteresting time.George Clooney is very over the top, as is John Malkovich, but Malcovich handles his characters emotional deterioration much better than Clooney.  Clooney just comes off like a moron; Malcovich elevates his characters moronic status, if that makes any sense.  Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton have both received nominations for their performances but I fail to see why.  I somewhat can see the Swinton love a bit, for she is rather good with what she is given (which isn't much mind you), but McDormand is in my opinion `worst in show'.  I just didn't get what she was doing.  I love her, don't get me wrong.

I had no real interest in seeing it as I've slowly become less and less enthusiastic about new Coen films over the last few years and felt quite let down over No Country which I feel is overrated.Still I rented it and am very glad I did. It's a typical Coen comedy with all the usual ingredients of silly / amusing characters, complex plotting and dark humour. It's not quite as zany or stylised as their earlier comedies like Raising Arizona or Hudsucker; here the characters are less cartoonish and the humour more sophisticated and in that respect has more in common with their more recent output like Big Lebowski, Intolerable Cruelty and Fargo.It's also slightly more low key than usual Coen comedy fare but is still full of invention and has a number of brilliant laugh out loud moments, mainly due to the excellent comedic mannerisms of both Clooney and Pitt. Actually, I thought Pitt was excellent, very innocent and lovably innocuous and his scenes where he tries to fish for a reward are pure comedy gold!Burn After Reading is the Coens on form for me, and it shows in the details. For example, who else would bother to make what could have been a rather mundane scene such as Pitt's character hanging out in a car waiting for a couple to leave their house, so subtly hilarious and memorable - again kudos to Pitt. When Pitt is inside the cupboard getting increasingly anxious, if you listen carefully, you can actually hear him wheezing! Hilarious! Again, the first encounter with the divorce lawyer (J.R. Horne), a short scene but made so fun because Horne was brilliantly funny and a typical Coen invention. There are so many comedic flourishes littered about, some very subtle, others more overt and in the end, it all rounds off to a very satisfying 90 minutes.There is a definite undercurrent of condescension which may be off putting for some though. You get the people at the top (here portrayed by the CIA and Russian embassy staff) being interrupted by these silly middle-aged people with their foibles, trying to make sense of all their shenanigans which in the end amount to nothing. Then of course you get Malkovic's speech at the end. It's difficult to say whether this is the Coen's showing a general disdain for people or whether it's them making fun out of their own middle-agedness.

Where else, other than as a Amazon film reviewer, can one feel so smugly superior and amused at the strivings and shortcomings of others, while celebrating the satisfaction of the bully, with the balm of comedy and farce, than in a Coen Brothers film? Not all of us can be paid to feel that way, some of us have to pay others, like the Coens, to provide us with two hours or so of escape to these wonderful sentiments.

After last year's award winning No Country for Old Men (which I haven't seen), they return to comedy with a spy thriller that features, instead of covert CIA agents and national secrets, a bunch of buffoons.The first thing you'll notice before you get into the purpose and intent of the film is the music and filming techniques. It is straight spy thriller stuff. Suspensful music, framing shots you'd expect in a Bourne or Bond film. Then you begin to realize that all the characters are morons. The great cast begins with John Malkovic as Oswald Cox, a midlevel CIA agent who quits his job instead of accepting a reassignment. He decides to write his memoirs. Those memoirs end up in the hands of two Hardbodies gym employees Linda Litzke and Chad Feldheimer (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt). They think they are in possession of some top secret information, and they will do anything to turn the ""top secret"" info into money.George Clooney plays Harry Pfarrer, a treasury department official who thinks he has his wife fooled that he is a good husband. While his wife is away, he is sleeping with Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton), Oswald's wife. He also is on an internet dating service and mees Linda Litzke. The movie ends with all the characters and story lines interacting in a crazy way.This movie really has no plot, in that there is no final objective. The movie instead has fun with the spy thriller genre and explores what would happen if the dumbest people in the world thought the were dealing with some top secret information.This movie isn't for everyone. There is a lot of foul language and a few scenes of gruesome violence. But that is expected in a ""R"" movie. All the great actors in the film play against their normal on-screen personal. They aren't sexy or smart or smooth. They are just dumb. You can judge how well you like your movie by your reaction to what happens to Chad Feldheimer (Pitt) when he is hiding in a closet.

1204800,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001IZNIZU,Caleb Williams,"[128, 155]","After the true genius of No Country For Old Men, the Coen Brothers come back with a whole new dimension. Burn After Reading is a dark comedy about idiots faced with an intelligent and complex situation. Two Gym instructors Linda Litsky (Frances McDormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) find a disc containing the memoirs of ex CIA agent Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich). They, being idiots think it's a disc containing top secret information and try to bribe Osbourne for money which would help pay for Linda's cosmetic surgery. Things don't go to plan as Osbourne has bigger things on his mind, his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with the paranoid Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney).This film is actually quite intelligent in its own right, the characters seem well defined and are played superbly. The characters were specifically written for the actor playing them and it really shows.John Malkovich portrays the agent lost of all hope well, you become quite intimidated by both his intelligence and temper.George Clooney as the paranoid individual who's having more affairs than you can wave a stick at doesn't falter. He's jumpy, but hey who wouldn't be if you were sleeping with three different women. This eratic behaviour becomes a bit tragic and leads to the death of one of the characters in the film.Brad Pitt as the loveable and wannabe cunning idiot is fantastic, the facial expressions and general stereotypical dexterity of what we would expect a personal trainer to be really works. This becomes especially amusing when he enters into the bribing game with Malkovich and starts to enter into the character of cunning spy. It has to be seen to be believed.Frances McDormands character is the real shining light of the whole film as she's the catalyst leading up to the films biggest events. She's a middle aged gym instructor paranoid over the look of her body. While trying to get plastic surgery, she's turned down by her insurance company and is the one that convinces Pitts character to bribe Cox. She's a woman on the edge of giving up on life and wants to take one last leap into the chance of a relationship, but is made even more nervous by her own body insecurities.The Coens once again create a film that is both surreal and believable, the characters are shockingly brilliant. The scenario is a bit over the top but comes together perfectly. There is something that bothered me, however, and that's the fact that every character in the film seemed to be having an affair with someone else. I don't know, maybe that was the whole point that made the film work. For fans of the Coens this is definitely one that sits proudly in their film catalogue next to such greats as No Country For Old Men and The Big Lebowski. I would strongly recommend it to any film fan overall, it's definitely worth it just for the Brad Pitt & Clooney facial expressions.

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[4, 5]","Whoever cast this movie made the best choicesHow Brad Pitt, rather than playing ego building roles like DiCaprio does, plays just a regular air head doofus in this movie, and so endearingly, is wonderful, brilliant, perfect.How Clooney plays a total, complete, absolute, malicious, deceitful jerk rather than the nice guy (which is Pitt) is amazing. I could have done without the sight of his basement project, but it reveals much about the personality and concepts of his character and of the decadently shallow meaningless society he keeps.Amazing thoughout, although, as I say, I find the basement project really really unviewable, while it makes you wonder how he imagines this will help grow his wife's love.Clooney is amazing, and does the character perfectly, complex, yet shallow, fooling no one.THat chidlren's book, yeah, pure marketing, but not a book you would ever actaully read to kids, not one kids would ever actually read, but one which makes tv morning shows.So, just one question.IS this a comedy or a tragedy?Kind of like Hamlet, lots of really funny lines, and much tragedy. HearHamlet: John Gielgud's Classic 1948 Recording (Classic Drama S.)More like Titus Andronicus, in fact, gruesome comedy with excruciating tragedy. See, if you don't readTitusAnd a perfect representation of the decadent society we exist in.Or those of the upper middle class desparately clinging to their stuff.Like inThe History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Penguin Classics)We're toast. Stick a fork in us. We are done.Casting is great in this, with familiar faces. QUIZ: Who is the superior in the closing summing up scene? SO familiar, so great!The former Russian (or Greek?) Orthodox priest?Ok, NO SPOILER HERE!!Only two really nice guys in this movie, both work at Hardbodies (ok, Manolo, too, but we do not see much of him, as he is poor in this complex wealthy film)so how come they, you know, well, watch the movie.And after we grow to appreciate them both in this movie of no saints.Excellent film, again nearly Shakespearean in complexity, I just wish the Coen brothers had kept us out of that basement. NOT A NICE MIND PICTURE, ok? Besides, no white one has ever been that big . . .interesting to see as a prophetic warning of where we are, and a delight at moments, watching Mr. Pitt play a doofus exercise guy who breaks people's bones, all around a real indictment of our society (have I said that yet?)well done. They say the Coens have several other fine films I have not seen.

It concerns a burnt-out CIA operative (John Malkovich) and his hen-pecking wife (Tilda Swinton) who's cheating with a serial adulterer (George Clooney).  Tossed into the middle are two health club employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) looking to make a few bucks on the side.Malkovich is a scene-stealer as always; if you want to see something absolutely terrifying, picture a drunk, raging Malkovich wielding a hatchet.  McDormand is terrific as always; Swinton plays up her ""Michael Clayton"" role, taking it up a notch a few levels.  Clooney gets by on charm alone for the first half, which is really all that's required; afterwards, he holds his own with the rest of the gang.  And Pitt...well, it's nice to see such a reknowned actor breaking image and playing a complete schmutz.  He's not exactly in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" form, but he's perfect for the role.  Supporting credit goes to the wonderful Richard Jenkins and the hilarous J. K. Simmons.As stated before: It's easy to pass this film off as light-hearted, when compared to the Coen Brothers' previous picture.  But that would be to ignore the Brothers' entire catalogue. The final scene in ""Burn After Reading,"" though absolutely hilarious, is easily as dark and thought-provoking as anything ""No Country For Old Men"" had to offer.

And each character, in his or her own way, shows it. The fact that Frances McDormand's character gets what she most wants in life--a liposuction paid for by her insurance--and gets it despite going to every bizarre extreme to obtain it, simply adds to the overall message of meaninglessness.

In this one, she comes off as a modern, sexy woman, caught in a doomed relationship, and not a medieval royal figure.Then there is Frances McDormand.

In recent memory, I've watched ""Fargo"" and ""No Country For Old Men"" and enjoyed them both. However, both were very unusual and thought-provoking films. So, okay, I found a Coen Brothers comedy, ""Burn After Reading,"" in the five-dollar rack and just had to try it. A Coen Brothers comedy? The mind boggles at the thought. On the DVD front cover, it said ""A Comedic Masterpiece"" and ""Incredibly Entertaining."" That was my first sign that it probably wasn't all that good. My judgement was on the spot.This movie was a comedy written about and for 40-somethings, people who have been out and about long enough that they are experiencing a lot of anxieties about  who they really are and what they're trying to do in life. Let's give them credit, the Coen Brothers have a sharp eye for those kinds of people and they painfully exploit it. The jokes are jokes, yes, but a lot of them have a razor-sharp cutting edge and their impact brings as much discomfort as laughter. Don't get me wrong, I like their ""eye of truth"" way of viewing the world. However, it turns the movie into part comedy and part very critical judgement of our society. That's all right, our society can use it. It's just that I was expecting something that was frivolous and hilariously funny and I got their jaundiced eye on life in the difficult forties. And, no, I'm not in my 40s. I'm 76.The movie starts out with John Malkovich quitting the CIA in disgust at their policies and going through the experience by attempting to write an exposing-style book. The CDs of the writings together with some of the data on which the book is based are lost and then found by two employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) at a fitness center. These two numbskulls figure that it's some kind of lost secret CIA document that people might pay big money to get back. Before long, the original author, an ex-CIA officer, a Federal Marshall, The Russian Embassy and others are involved and Brad Pitt ends up dead and floating in Chesapeake Bay. It's hard to explain. Trust me. It's just about what you might expect to happen in Washington with everyone trying to keep their own rear end covered.In any case,  did I find it a funny movie? No, not particularly. Was it an interesting movie? Yes, in a certain very bizarre sense. Was it a well done movie? Yes, exceptionally well done. The movie provided a strange and thought-provoking reaction, but I think an appropriate subtitle for the DVD might be ""Burn After Viewing.""Gary Peterson",3,A Comedy Written About And For 40-Somethings.

It is the peculiar genius of the Coen Brothers to be able to sum up the essential weirdness of wildly diverse 'cultures.' They nailed LA in 'The Big Lebowsky.' They encapsulated the mythic South in 'Oh Brother.' They are to cultural anthropology what music is to traffic noise, or Baudelaire is to the Paris phone book. They have distilled, in Burn After Reading, the intrinsic nasty stupidity of the 'Intelligence' community, the same people who have given us the best film noir moments of the Post-Cold War.The only good thing about the mutant dog do virus strain that laid me out a few days ago (spread by the wheels of that wheelchair in which The Smirker made his escape) is that I've had a chance to catch up on a few films. Oh, I meant to see Burn After Reading eventually, despite the lukewarm response it's gotten from crrrrritics, but I might have forgotten. Thank you, flu! This film is a Coen Brothers masterpiece, far more interesting and well-crafted than 'No Country for Old Men', which the Brothers made only for money and to scam the idiots who award Oscars.The casting of Burn After Reading has to be recognized as a manifestation of generous confidence on the part of the Coens in each of the over-exposed actors involved.  Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, Brad Pitt? Who else would have believed they were capable of real character acting! Malkovich, yes, but he must have had enormous fun. I'm tempted to think the actors paid the producers of this film for the privilege of proving their craft. Frances McDormand of course is in reality the third Coen Brother... you know, like Groucho, Chico, and Harpo?Here's my advice:  Don't wait for the Bushy Tail Flu to lay you on your couch!

1204847,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001IZNIZU,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Joel and Ethan Coen won the market on strange, off-centered movies that toss out bits and pieces of nonsense and lets the audience - and the obviously wildly entertained group of actors involved - put it together as best they can.  The Coen brothers have made some very fine films: this just isn't one of them.What little plot there is pops along something like this: Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), an expert on Balkan affairs, is fired at the CIA: he begins writing a memoir of his past and his responses. His wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce and expects her lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) - a philandering State Department marshal - to leave his wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel). Bouncing along to the next episode, a CD drops out of a gym bag at a Georgetown gym and employees Linda (Frances McDormand), an Internet obsessed date seeker,  and Chad (Brad Pitt) attempt to make it big by turning it into cash (Linda wants money for elective surgery, and Chad, a fluffhead goes along). Information on the CD leads them to Osbourne who declines to pay them for the CD so they visit the Russian Embassy as an option.  Linda and Chad decide they need more of Osbourne's secrets to enhance their 'valuable CD'. Bounce to another sidebar:  Linda's boss Ted (Richard Jenkins) likes her, and Harry's wife leaves for a book tour. The CIA (JK Simmons) is involved and the 'conspiracy' continues to blossom - all so that Linda can have plastic surgery to enhance her status on the Internet dating sites while her partner Chad just plods along in his own oblivious style for the ride.  Looking for a meaningful interconnected plot? Good luck!The film lacks sensitive editing that would make it easier to follow the myriad subplots but then that is part of the Coen style.  The dialogue is full of puns - embarrassingly so - and instead of trying to make the film make sense it is better to just sit back and let the silliness of human foibles entertain. That is probably why so many of our top film actors sign on for Coen brothers film - to have fun and poke fun at not only the world we live in but also at us.

1204848,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B001IZNIZU,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 1]","The reviews have been mixed, and I'm not at all surprised.  BURN AFTER READING won't be everybody's cup of Gatorade, but if you're one of the many naysayers who claim to find the film a major letdown after last year's officially designated Best Pic NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, well, let me just say, I do understand your point.  But has it occurred to you that maybe you're less of a COEN BROS. fan and more of a CORMAC McCARTHY fan?Yes, yes, I know that NO COUNTRY was supposed to be a case of the source material (the McCarthy novel of the same name) being the perfect fit for our two most idiosyncratic filmmakers, and in many ways, it was just that.  But there was one significant difference, in my book anyway.  And that was the person(?) of Anton Chigurh himself.  We all know by now that Chigurh is quite simply the personification of implacable evil, less of human being than a force of supernature.  And like a malevolent phoenix, he rises from the ashes more than once.  One thing he's NOT is a bumbler.  In that, he differs from just about every other Coen ""bad guy,"" or for that matter, just about every other major Coen character.Heck, even the seemingly invincible biker dude in RAISING ARIZONA turned out to be Wile E. Coyote in the end.I know the Brothers don't particularly like to be intellectualized about, but if there's one common theme uniting all their work, it's probably that the entire human race is the Gang That Could't Shoot Straight.  In the Coen's universe, we're all bad comic actors strutting and fretting for about 90 minutes on atarnished silver screen. Good guys or bad, small or mighty, it don't make no never mind. Usually, just like in real life, the misterioso elements that do occur (a cow on a barn, say) are just enough for us fools to scratch and wonder if just maybe there aren't more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt in our philosophy...OR our cinema.  Or my name isn't Horatio!If you keep the Coens' basic worldview in mind, you just may find that BURN AFTER READING is a near perfect expression of same.  This is an absurd world where EVERYBODY is out of their league.  And they've all watched too many spy movies.  Even the spies--who really should know better.  When John Malkovich--being the quintessential John Malkovich here--rails at Brad Pitt's buffoonish would-be blackmailer/""Good Samaritan"" and tells him that he (Pitt) has no idea what he's up against, he's so into his espionage mode that you might forget for a second that he's just a (fired) CIA analyst penning what appears to be a not very revealing tell-all.  In other words, this is not ""spy vs. spy.""  It's ""schlub vs. schlub.""And you gotta love that.  Or at least I do.  You can do what you want.",5,"Right, Right, Naysayers,  We Get It!

It is funny first because it is a parody of American society, of the small middle class of working people who are not particularly swift and definitely not lucky but they just do what they do with some desire to get some satisfaction out of it. Maybe even some profit or benefit. The favors of a woman, or some extra investment money. Nothing really serious but just five plastic surgery operations for the bargain price of $25,000. And that would give some dynamic ambition to anyone, and anything would be good enough to make that extra money. When you add to that the fact that everyone is playing around with another woman or another man, and the film remains within the limits of straight-dom, you have it all. The spy-apprentices will get entangled with the adulterous spouses and the situation is unbelievably complex, and lethal if not plain deadly. But then the film - and it starts with that - is situated all around one third rank CIA executive, hence with spies and other undercover actions and activities. But since most people in that situation are not in any way listed as active spies, the CIA top boss - if there is one - just wonders what it is all about and his reaction will be to clean up the situation. And the clean-up will be drastic. Only the three women will survive: the spouse of the spy, the spouse of the security service chap and the unmarried woman who wants to finance her plastic surgery. The two spouses are free since the two men they were married to end up dead. And the third woman is happy too since the CIA pays for the plastic surgery to bury the  business. In other words the film is a big parody of many other films, and first of all Mission Impossible, but transferred to the level of the dummies who read all the books especially written for them, and these dummies in this film are definitely dim. And then the rest is quid pro quo (both imbroglio and legal meaning) and crazy situational complications. It turns the very serious security problems of the 21st century into a farce, and we think somewhere that after all they are a farce which makes the film absolutely righteous.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,When the dummies are governing our world,1230336000,"12 27, 2008",2008,2317,"['comedy', 'funny', 'why', 'so', 'funny', 'funny', 'first', 'parody', 'American', 'society', 'small', 'middle', 'class', 'working', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'swift', 'definitely', 'not', 'lucky', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'desire', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'Maybe', 'even', 'profit', 'benefit', 'favors', 'woman', 'extra', 'investment', 'money', 'Nothing', 'really', 'serious', 'just', 'five', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'operations', 'bargain', 'price', '25,000', 'would', 'give', 'dynamic', 'ambition', 'anyone', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'When', 'add', 'fact', 'everyone', 'playing', 'around', 'woman', 'man', 'film', 'limits', 'straight-dom', 'have', 'spy-apprentices', 'will', 'get', 'entangled', 'adulterous', 'spouses', 'situation', 'unbelievably', 'complex', 'lethal', 'not', 'plain', 'deadly', 'then', 'film', 'situated', 'one', 'third', 'rank', 'CIA', 'executive', 'hence', 'spies', 'other', 'undercover', 'actions', 'activities', 'most', 'people', 'situation', 'are', 'not', 'way', 'listed', 'active', 'spies', 'CIA', 'top', 'boss', 'one', 'just', 'what', 'reaction', 'will', 'be', 'clean', 'up', 'situation', 'clean-up', 'will', 'be', 'drastic', 'Only', 'three', 'women', 'will', 'survive', 'spouse', 'spy', 'spouse', 'security', 'service', 'chap', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'who', 'finance', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'two', 'spouses', 'are', 'free', 'two', 'men', 'were', 'married', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'third', 'woman', 'happy', 'too', 'CIA', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'bury', 'business', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'big', 'parody', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'first', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'transferred', 'level', 'dummies', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'especially', 'written', 'dummies', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'dim', 'then', 'rest', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'imbroglio', 'legal', 'meaning', 'crazy', 'situational', 'complications', 'very', 'serious', 'security', 'problems', '21st', 'century', 'farce', 'think', 'somewhere', 'are', 'farce', 'film', 'absolutely', 'righteous.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

B Kraft ""lonestargazer""","[2, 3]","First of all, my wife and I are big Coen brothers fans.I watched this movie and found some of the scenes outrageously funny, but I was more ambivalent than my wife. I felt it was ""reminiscent in feel"" of the Big Lebowski. Then we watched the commentary, and one of the principals made the remark that it was a ""comedy about old people"", and it was a Eureka moment for me. Most of these characters are in some ways privileged, but they just don't enjoy it, or have sense enough to realize the problem is within themselves, yet they are obsessed at finding that ""magical"" answer. It doesn't hurt that the Coen display a feel for the Beltway life of Washington that they did for the deep South in O Brother, or for L. A. in Liebowski. How do guys from New York understand places that are so ""distant from New York""?These are a bunch of middle-aged plus people (except for Brad Pitt, who's character is none too bright), who all think they are smarter than they really are, and who all believe that somehow life (or some person or combination of persons) is conspiring to deprive them of some deeper part of the pie that will guarantee their fulfillment.If you are a Boomer, who has ever had a job where you didn't feel there was anywhere for you to progress, or who has ever been in a dead-ending relationship, I think you will see the brilliant humor in this movie. For you younger people, it will probably happen to you too in time.This movie to me is very perceptive about how easy it is to get things all wrong about what your problems are -- especially as you are playing the ""back 9"" of your career and your life. In fact, there's quite an object lesson here with which the Bard of Avon and his Polonius would be quite at home -- if you are honest with yourself, you are not likely to be dishonest with anyone else or be taken advantage of. If you can't be honest with yourself, you are quite at risk to do bizarre and mistaken things.Legitimately, several of the scenes and elements of the plot do echo ""The Big Lebowski"", so I recommend you give yourself a chance to watch this movie a couple of times -- it grew on me, as did Lebowski or O Brother.

""Good to the last drop"" If I may quote Maxwell House Coffee. It's violent, Ironic, and has an ending that leaves you in stitches. Some comedies stretch a plot and its many low brow jokes, but we'll have none of that stuff here. Enjoy! OH, and it uses its Blue ribbon cast to its dreamed of capacity! What a bonus.There are some really crazy moments in this film, that shocked me, and in a wierd sort of way made me laugh. The accidental shootings are portrayed visually as shocking, but the set up, and the treatment afterwards really has you laughing. It is a eerie mixture of C.I.A seriousness and goofed up comedy with its comments about our government operations. John Malkovich is nearly always wicked and funny at the same time, such as in Con Air, and here he again that likable, funny, screwed up character that we love.The cast is huge, like the Oceans movies. No one is really left in the cold, as far as having their acting moments here, and that must be an accomplishment of the director. Getting his script across and utilizing his allstar cast cannot be easy to do. The movie moves along at a nicely edited pace, which is rather hard to get done right, but in the hands of the right editors, amazing the Coen brothers again, it is made to look easy. How much can two motivated people personally take care of on their own in a major motion picture: well the Cohen brothers really push that limit with having their hands on nearly every process of the making of this film.I don't want to understate the story telling of this film. It is an odd, yet intelligently funny movie that ends in a way that leaves room for discussion.

Menta, Jr.","[1, 2]","Like ""Fargo"", the Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"" is one of their occasional productions that combines farce with drama, with neither aspect compromising or diluting the other.  While at first glance everyone here strongly defines themselves- in that very American way of looking at things- by their jobs (intelligence agent, gym employee, academic, etc.), the movie eventually makes it clear that we're all ultimately defined by our desires, lusts, and personal quirks.  It's these latter aspects of the characters that make them pursue increasingly crazy, though sadly still quite believeable, actions.Frances McDormand is particularly good, both hilarious and chilling, as the gym employee who will do absolutely anything, without a shred of guilt (or even awareness that she should at least CONSIDER feeling guilty), to secure the cosmetic surgery she desperately wants.  Brad Pitt and George Clooney are terrific, too, with both again demonstrating some serious comic chops.Both light and cutting, ""Burn After Reading"" is upper-tier Coen Brothers work and not to be missed.

1204877,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001IZNIZU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","The Coen Brothers send up of the ""spy thriller"" genre, Burn After Reading followed on the heels of Best Picture-winnerNo Country for Old Menand, like almost all Coen Brothers films, was a completely different direction from that previous film. It's a dark/screwball comedy that does go over the top, but is completely comfortable in its absurdity. The Coen Brothers said they wanted this to be their ""Tony Scott movie."" Well (different genres aside), it's better than most Tony Scott movies.The film grabbed my attention immediately in the brilliant opening scene where Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst, is told he is being demoted to a lower clearance level as a result of his ""drinking problem."" Seeing this as a political crucifixion, Osborne quits his job and decides to pen an ""explosive"" memoir. George Clooney plays Harry Pfarrer, a U.S. Marshal who works in the Treasury Department. Harry is happily married to a children's book author, happy to point out he has ""never fired his gun in 20 years of Marshal Service,"" and is having an affair with Osborne's wife Katie (Tilda Swinton).Frances McDormand plays Linda Litzke, a loudmouthed, nave gym employee looking for love...And a way to pay for all the plastic surgery procedures she wants. Linda works with Chad (Brad Pitt), a gum-chewing, clueless simpleton who works Linda at Hardbodies gym. When Chad finds a disc that seems to contain Osborne's memoirs, the two decide to bribe Osborne for some money to return his ""intelligence s***."" Richard Jenkins co-stars as Ted, the nervous, insecure manager of Hardbodies.Few movie character's need you to use two adjectives when describing them. These characters do...All are multi-dimensional, bumbling idiots that don't feel like ""written"" idiots. The Coen's wrote these characters specifically for the actors that play them and each actor (knowing they're not shooting for an Oscar) has a blast playing they're character. The Coen Brothers have always excelled at creating memorable film characters, but I found their creations here some of their most memorable and easily some of their funniest.Much of the credit goes to the actor's, two I'll talk about specifically. George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, and Frances McDormand are all Oscar winners; both have played this character before. Clooney is hilarious and has received his fair share of attention for this role. It's nice to see a serious actor not being afraid to let loose. Swinton has also played this character before; as the most humorless character in the film, it's not even much of a stretch from herMichael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)character. And McDormand is great as always, especially in movies directed by her husband Joel Coen. The characters she plays in Coen movies always seem to be adored by their creator(s) and usually have the happiest ending. This is no exception.The two actors' that really stand out, for me, are John Malkovich and Brad Pitt. I love Malkovich and will watch any movie he's in. Anyone who's seen a Malkovich film has probably noticed that he has one of the most commanding, attention-grabbing voices especially when he's yelling. The Coen Brothers seem to have noticed, as they wrote this part specifically for him and I think there are two or three scenes where Malkovich isn't yelling. This is a great comedic performance. Not just because Malkovich is a revered actor of film and stage, as he's had no problem breaking away from type in the past...But he's absolutely fascinating, empathetic, and hilarious. People tend to say that Osborne is the most intelligent character, but as the tagline of this film said: ""intelligence is relative."" Osborne is smart, but like all the people in this film has their idea of what's going on all wrong. Even the smartest character in this film lacks common sense. You laugh at Osborne, but you feel a bit bad for the guy too.Brad Pitt, an underrated actor, comes out of nowhere with his performance as Chad. I know people who won't see a Pitt film, but he steals the show here! Not only that, he's created one of the most brilliant character's of his career. He disappears into the role of Chad, bringing such an energy and hilarity to his role. In character, Pitt saying the word ""s***"" can cause you to cry tears of laughter.The confrontation between Chad and Osborne in the car is a perfect example of the comedic genius of the script and the great comedic timing of the actors. Everything about this scene is ingenious from Pitt's squinty eyes, to the expletive-filled exchange between the two, and finally to ""you think it's a Schwinn!""Anyway, as for the rest of the film; the dialogue is brilliantly written. There are lines in this film that you will very likely remember for a long time. There's quite a bit of swearing in the film, but it never feels gratuitous. If not further the development of the characters, I find that no one can say the ""f-word"" like Malkovich can. The musical score is your typical ""spy movie"" music that works so wonderfully here, adding to the absurdity of the film and seemingly remarking on the false tension that these ""spy thrillers"" attempt to build.Burn After Reading is a screwball comedy, Coen style. It's a film that takes nothing seriously and, at a 92-minute running time, only has scenes necessary to the plot. Before you disagree, there are scenes that seem to have no place in the film whatsoever. If this film wasn't as ludicrous as it is, they wouldn't. However, even the scenes that don't seem to have any relevance add to sheer randomness of this film. And it is random; the Coen's have no problem leading the film is one direction only to jerk it into completely different one moments later.Many people have rejected this film. All Coen Brothers films have their detractors, but this one seems to be taking a lot of heat. I honestly can't understand why. The Coen Brothers have always made films like this, but this is distinctly different from any previous comedy efforts...And it IS better than their last comedyThe Ladykillers (Widescreen Edition).The script seems to get the biggest amount of complaints. The first time I saw the film (I've seen it four times now), I had no idea what was going on and I was wondering where this movie was going. What was the point? The two scenes that J.K. Simmons is in sum up the entire ""point"" of the movie. Is the plot ""contrived?"" Yes. Does the film seem to be going nowhere throughout? Yes. If you paid attention to the (hilarious) scenes with Simmons, you should realize that the entire point of the film is that there really isn't one. The characters have as good of an idea as you do about what's happening. It has a central conflict that is really not of much importance and the rest of the film is the hilarious situations that come from this conflict. I don't see how even people who disliked the film can't admire the brilliance of the plot structure.Burn After Reading is the most inventive, unique comedy of 2008. I really love this movie. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect, and it's not one of the best Coen Brothers movies. But it's a very intelligent comedy with great characters and witty dialogue that is absolutely bursting with creative energy.How can you dislike a movie that can be summed up with one word;

What do they expect from the Coen Brothers? Why, this film could even be called a madcap comedy with a criminal twist.""Burn After Reading"" has been ""read"" a number of ways: a spoof of the intelligence community (my call on the funniest part of the film), a social commentary on extra-marital and internet affairs, and a poke at mid-life crises. Let me add one more dimension to this adept Coen Brothers film of masterful ensemble acting: the apparent inability for one human to really know another, resulting in superficial intimacies.People are who they are. Even if they switch their partners, they still are who they are. Case in point: Tilda Swindon plays a cold, haughty type with John Malkovich, but once she and George Clooney actually shack up, they become who they are once again and disenchanted with each other.Clooney enjoys sex with Francis McDormand's character until he learns she is part of his paranoid misadventure. She is willing to sell trade secrets to the Russian Embassy to make enough money for plastic surgery. Her employer at the health club is obviously in love with her and is willing to overlook her suddenly bad work habits. Brad Pitt perfectly plays an airhead personal trainer, yet is fearless in espionage matters. John Malkovich is fired from Intelligence and writes his memoirs in a drunken stupor to get back at the agency. In fact, it is Malkovich's papers that get into the hands of Francis! It is a big loop-di-loop. Even though I gave important parts of the story above, none is a spoiler!Even Clooney's wife, a children's book author for pete's sake, is having an affair. Do we really know another human being, even those we love and live with? The Coens say no. All these people are solid citizens, yet behave abominably when their little universes fall apart.One reviewer describes Francis McDormand as the third Coen Brother.

Corn ""reviewer""","[6, 8]","First off, if you've already seen this in theaters, consider seeing the  DVD, if only for the Bonus features, where the Coen Brothers and the cast of Burn After Reading show glimpses into how the Coen process works.In Burn After Reading, they tie together such diverse subjects as liposuction,spies and gym instructors. Frances McDormand, who is a favorite of the Coens, once again shines in this movie. She is a favorite of mine and I have to watch closely to see the art behind her work. She is simply believable to me in nearly every role.George Clooney and Brad Pitt both get to be awkward and clownish. Pitt plays a gym instructor who discovers a disc created by Osborne Cox (played by John Malkovich) Cox is not having a good year, having been demoted as a spy and also about to have his marriage implode.When Pitt and McDormand (both gym instructors) discover the tape, it sets into motion a whole sequences of plot twists and turns that kept me hooked. I foresaw some of them but was surprised by many other scenes....and some moments were simply laugh out loud funny. Others were horrifying. Mostly, it was a very weird movie, in the best sense of the word ""weird"".I also felt that there was something poignant about this film. In the ending scene, when there is musing about what happened and the lessons learned, I felt the Coens were coming as close to delivering an overall message - or warning - as they ever do, perhaps hinting at the dangers about being too complacent about security and safety and depending on the government to provide that. The movie left me wanting more, so I went back and looked at key scenes again.Also recommended?

The entire affair is an absurdist look at not only DC but self-obsession, political thrillers, middle age, and a host of other mostly modern ailments. Coen stalwarts McDormand and Clooney are excellent, but Malkovich and Pitt made me laugh the most, which was quite a lot.Everything's perfectly deadpan, and if you don't appreciate laughing at yourself along with everyone else, BAR won't do it for you. A large slice of how we live is lampooned here, especially for those who've crested the 40-year hill and are gliding gracefully, or more likely not so, towards worm food status. Pitt seems to represent youthful obliviousness in general, and is the only character free of remorse or even self-inspection.What I really loved about this film is that every single bit player is perfectly cast; all the government lackeys and CIA stooges are out to save their own butts first and foremost, and each actor seems exactly as selfish and myopic as they should be. The whole picture is painted so unflinchingly and yet with so much barely hidden glee that it all seems to get more weirdly funny as it goes on.The Coens are in fine fettle here, and I rank this as very much one of their funniest, almost at Lebowski level. That worked by being over the top, and this works in precisely the opposite way. Its various overt subtleties seem to have escaped a large segment of the public and even Coen fans, judging from BAR's very mixed reception, but I think this one will age beautifully and eventually be seen as the twisted little masterpiece it is.",4,Extreme irony of the Coen variety,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,1628,"['4.4', 'funniest', 'thing', 'movie', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'entire', 'affair', 'absurdist', 'look', 'not', 'only', 'DC', 'self-obsession', 'political', 'thrillers', 'middle', 'age', 'host', 'other', 'mostly', 'modern', 'ailments', 'Coen', 'stalwarts', 'McDormand', 'Clooney', 'are', 'excellent', 'Malkovich', 'Pitt', 'made', 'most', 'was', 'quite', 'lot.Everything', 'perfectly', 'deadpan', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'laughing', 'everyone', 'else', 'BAR', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'large', 'slice', 'how', 'live', 'lampooned', 'here', 'especially', 'who', ""'ve"", 'crested', '40-year', 'hill', 'are', 'gliding', 'gracefully', 'more', 'likely', 'not', 'so', 'towards', 'worm', 'food', 'status', 'Pitt', 'represent', 'youthful', 'obliviousness', 'general', 'only', 'character', 'free', 'remorse', 'even', 'self-inspection.What', 'really', 'loved', 'film', 'single', 'bit', 'player', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'government', 'lackeys', 'CIA', 'stooges', 'are', 'save', 'own', 'butts', 'first', 'foremost', 'actor', 'exactly', 'selfish', 'myopic', 'should', 'be', 'whole', 'picture', 'painted', 'so', 'unflinchingly', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'barely', 'hidden', 'glee', 'get', 'more', 'weirdly', 'funny', 'on.The', 'Coens', 'are', 'fine', 'fettle', 'here', 'rank', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'funniest', 'almost', 'Lebowski', 'level', 'worked', 'being', 'top', 'precisely', 'opposite', 'way', 'various', 'overt', 'subtleties', 'seem', 'have', 'escaped', 'large', 'segment', 'public', 'even', 'Coen', 'fans', 'judging', 'BAR', 'very', 'mixed', 'reception', 'think', 'one', 'will', 'age', 'beautifully', 'eventually', 'be', 'seen', 'twisted', 'little', 'masterpiece']",N/A

And I don't remember publicity of any kind.  But it was on cable TV and when it listed the cast of characters, I knew I had to see it.First of all, there is Frances McDormand.  I've loved her performances ever since I saw Fargo years ago.  In this film she plays the role of an aging gym instructor who doesn't have enough money for the cosmetic surgery which she is sure will help her land a man.  She's looking for love through the internet and the men she meets are all losers.  Another gym instructor, and her friend, is Brad Pitt, playing the part of a rather dense golden haired trainer.  One day they just happen to find a computer disk which looks like it has some secret CIA information on it.  The disk actually belongs to John Malkovich, who has been fired from the CIA and is writing a book about his experiences.  Whether the so-called secret information on the disk is actually real is always a question mark.  Malkovich is married to Tilda Swinton, a thin society type who is having an affair with George Clooney.  Clooney is quite a womanizer.  Even though he thinks he is happily married, there are several women in his life.  Frances McDormand becomes one of them.The plot is so faced paced that I had no time to think.  But I did laugh a lot.  Every scene is stretched to its outrageous edge.  There's gunplay and murder throughout and most of the characters meet their end in some serendipitously outrageous way.  The conclusion is fun and satisfying even though most of the characters have been killed off.I am not one for comedies.  But I loved this one.

But without a lot of the complexity developed from a simple wish to have a beautiful body - the ending could not have been as hilarious.

The CIA Analyst's spouse downloads information from Osborn's computer to prepare for divorce.  She thinks it is mainly financial information and does not want to be cheated out of her share.  Somehow the CD ends up at the Hard Body Gym, where Frances McDormand (Linda Litzke), a love-starved aging employee, and Brad Pitt (Chad Feldheimer) a personal trainer, who is a good friend find it and see there may be a way to use it for money through blackmailing Osborn Cox.Linda's search for love continues with on-line dating ""meet-ups""  and her constant calls to the insurance company to complain that the four procedures she needs are not elective - they are important to her life and career.  The procedures should be paid for.  They aren't.  George Clooney (Harry Pfarrer) is one of her ""dates"" - but he also married and is carrying on an affair with Osborn's wife.  He is a ""cheater"".

I consider Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, and Fargo as some of my favorite movies.  But boy were those hopes dashed in a heartbeat when I actually viewed this one.  This doesn't even come close to quality of those movies.Burn After Reading has a whole array of problems, but here is a list of what comes to mind.  First and foremost, everyone tries WAY too hard to be funny and quirky.  Whenever you notice each and every character doing a ""look at me, look at me"" against every other character, that's not a good sign.  Plus, there isn't a single likeable character.  There's no one you can ""root for.""  Even the one character you thought you could root for, ends up being just as horrible as the rest of them.  They're just all horrible people and you don't want any of them to succeed in any way.  Also, Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are just WAY too stupid for words.  I know they're supposed to be, but this is just annoyingly so.  It's not really funny, just annoying.The only reason I'm even giving this two stars instead of one, is simply because of a few scenes.  There are a few standout scenes that float to the top and are actually pretty funny.  I don't want to ruin it, if you're actually going to watch this, but a few are good.  Plus, anytime JK Simmons is on screen, you realize how fantastic that guy really is.  Pity he's only in it for about 5 minutes total.  He also makes you realize just how much the other actors are waaaaaaaay overacting and mugging for the camera.Overall, as a Coen brothers fan, I was sorely disappointed.

(Even the purposely and funnily mistitled 'Burn After Reading' sort of ties into the 'blundered' events that take place, as the centerpiece of the movie, the CD disc isn't something you'd associate with burning after viewing!) That spark of interest that nearly all Coen brothers movies have never quite fires in this movie for me, and things don't coalesce until well into it. The first 45 minutes introduced characters that just weren't that interesting and the farceness started seeming a bit lame and and worn thin. All that said, it's rentable. You get the Coen style shtick and the filmaking itself (cinematography, dialogue, pacing,etc) is good, the ending has the weird 'ending that doesn't feel like an ending' vibe , nearly as much as no country for old men.",3,"Classic Coen style, but just ok",1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,1136,"['nutty', 'nitwit', 'characters', 'are', 'classic', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'wild', 'situations', 'find', 'something', 'only', 'could', 'concoct', 'Someone', 'mentioned', 'supposed', 'metaphors', 'movie', 'places', 'online', 'mention', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'only', 'Coen', 'are', 'clever', 'fellows', 'already', 'knew', 'way', 'movie', 'true', 'Even', 'purposely', 'funnily', 'mistitled', 'Reading', 'sort', 'ties', ""'blundered"", 'events', 'take', 'place', 'centerpiece', 'movie', 'CD', 'disc', ""n't"", 'something', ""'d"", 'associate', 'burning', 'viewing', 'spark', 'interest', 'nearly', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'quite', 'fires', 'movie', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'coalesce', 'well', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'introduced', 'characters', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'farceness', 'started', 'seeming', 'bit', 'lame', 'worn', 'thin', 'said', 'rentable', 'get', 'Coen', 'style', 'shtick', 'filmaking', 'cinematography', 'dialogue', 'pacing', 'etc', 'good', 'ending', 'weird', ""'ending"", ""n't"", 'feel', 'ending', 'vibe', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'country', 'old', 'men']",N/A

Their films seem to be exercises in hilarious subtleties, demonstrating humanity's most interesting strengths and weaknesses.  The plots sprawl and fray, the characters seem to exist independently of each other, and the whole thing can often come across as slapdash.  Or so muted that the only impression it leaves is quizzical.I've been a huge fan for a long time (ever since I sawBlood Simple, in fact), and I don't believe these guys have ever made a movie that didn't have a serious point to make.  EvenThe Big Lebowski, arguably one of their most absurd works, had a lot to say about the way honest laziness can sometimes thrive in spite of the malicious excesses of those who are more powerful and harder working.""So, what did we learn?"" asks a CIA official at the end of BURN AFTER READING.  Well, let's see.The film begins with CIA analyst Osborne Cox (a spot-on Malkovich) being demoted due to alcoholism.  Cox, rather than be disgraced, quits and begins work on his memoirs (between drinks).  The CIA keeps tabs on him, and around him suddenly swirls a mess of senseless intrigue that involves a twitchy sex addict who works for the Treasury (George Clooney), a vain and desperate gym employee (Frances McDormand), and her clueless (but Can Do!) buddy, Chad (Brad Pitt).  When Cox's memoirs make their way into McDormand's hands, she sees a way to solve her woes by blackmailing the analyst into paying for a bevy of cosmetic surgeries.Aside from the typically convoluted plot, the film is a dark and dead-pan comedy about how the frailties of adulthood (alcoholism, sexual indiscretions, blind personal vanity) can alter the lives of people who deserve much better.  Looked at from head-on, the movie is sorta depressing, even though many of the characters get exactly what they're looking for.  That's, of course, not really the point.Near the end of the film, analyst Cox confronts a person who has become involved in the plot to use his memoirs for personal gain.  ""You represent the idiocy of this world,"" he sneers.  Making sense of idiocy is something the Coen brothers have been doing for a long, long time, and even if the government agents keeping tabs on all the lies and greed-grubbing don't do such a good job of learning from the craziness, that doesn't mean an astute viewer can't find something to take away from the theatre.",4,The Idiocy Of This World,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,2443,"['easy', 'watch', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'leave', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'exercises', 'hilarious', 'subtleties', 'demonstrating', 'humanity', 'most', 'interesting', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'plots', 'sprawl', 'fray', 'characters', 'seem', 'exist', 'independently', 'other', 'whole', 'thing', 'can', 'often', 'come', 'slapdash', 'so', 'muted', 'only', 'impression', 'quizzical.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'ever', 'sawBlood', 'Simple', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'guys', 'have', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'serious', 'point', 'make', 'EvenThe', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'arguably', 'one', 'most', 'absurd', 'works', 'had', 'lot', 'say', 'way', 'honest', 'laziness', 'can', 'sometimes', 'thrive', 'spite', 'malicious', 'excesses', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'harder', 'working', 'So', 'what', 'did', 'learn', 'CIA', 'official', 'end', 'BURN', 'AFTER', 'READING', 'Well', 'let', 'see.The', 'film', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Osborne', 'Cox', 'spot-on', 'Malkovich', 'being', 'demoted', 'due', 'alcoholism', 'Cox', 'rather', 'be', 'disgraced', 'quits', 'work', 'memoirs', 'drinks', 'CIA', 'tabs', 'suddenly', 'swirls', 'mess', 'senseless', 'intrigue', 'twitchy', 'sex', 'addict', 'who', 'Treasury', 'George', 'Clooney', 'vain', 'desperate', 'gym', 'employee', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'clueless', 'Can', 'Do', 'buddy', 'Chad', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'When', 'Cox', 'memoirs', 'make', 'way', 'McDormand', 'hands', 'way', 'solve', 'woes', 'blackmailing', 'analyst', 'paying', 'bevy', 'cosmetic', 'surgeries.Aside', 'typically', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'film', 'dark', 'dead-pan', 'comedy', 'how', 'frailties', 'adulthood', 'alcoholism', 'sexual', 'indiscretions', 'personal', 'vanity', 'can', 'alter', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'deserve', 'much', 'better', 'Looked', 'head-on', 'movie', 'sorta', 'depressing', 'even', 'many', 'characters', 'get', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'course', 'not', 'really', 'point.Near', 'end', 'film', 'analyst', 'Cox', 'person', 'who', 'become', 'involved', 'plot', 'use', 'memoirs', 'personal', 'gain', 'represent', 'idiocy', 'world', 'Making', 'sense', 'idiocy', 'something', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'government', 'agents', 'keeping', 'tabs', 'lies', 'greed-grubbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'good', 'job', 'learning', 'craziness', ""n't"", 'mean', 'astute', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'something', 'take', 'away', 'theatre']",N/A
1204900,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001IZNIZU,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[9, 10]","Joel and Ethan Coen make movies that are at right angles to most of the rest of Hollywood. Their dramas, going back to ""Blood Simple"", have a refreshing splash of humor, and their comedies, going back to ""Raising Arizona"", have dark elements. The Coen's are so adept at crossing stylishly from one genre to another it is no surprise that their grim Oscar-winning ""No Country For Old Men"" is followed by this delightfully twisted comedy.I repeatedly find in Coen comedies characters who are not only entertainly dumb, but (as happens so often in real life, doesn't it?) unaware of their stupidity. (Think back to ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"") In ""Burn After Reading"" the Coens have assembled both performers and characters who are able to rip through a script that would be part hilarious and part ridiculous - ridiculous, that is, if it were not a Coen Brothers movie.Brad Pitt appears prominently in the film's ad campaign (and he is sublime as an airheaded fitness trainer), but it would be difficult to say he is the ""star"", as a half dozen characters share as much screen time. John Malkovich brings an edgy profanity to his not-as-smart-as-he-thinks-he-is CIA analyst, who quits rather than take a demotion when his bosses confront him about his drinking problem. Tilda Swinton is superbly cast as his icy wife, not only reprising her White Witch character from ""Narnia"", but also her cold-blooded lawyer from ""Michael Clayton"". Swinton plays a pediatrician - the kind that makes children cry and doesn't care. Swinton is having an affair with ""Clayton"" co-star George Clooney, who once again expertly essays a Coen Clown, this time an ex government protection agent who ""never once discharged his weapon"" in years of service, but tells another character at a cocktail party that he could use his pistol if needed, because ""reflexes take over - it's all muscle memory"". (These reflexes complicate the plot in a way that can only be described as Coenesque.) Frances McDormand does much of her best work for husband Joel and brother-in-law Ethan (winning her Oscar in ""Fargo""), and here she gets a wonderful role as Pitt's dim-witted fitness center co-worker. McDormand has a poignant but funny early scene where she and a plastic surgeon (the extremely reliable Jeffrey DeMunn from ""The Green Mile"" and ""Law and Order"") discuss four separate operations she desperately wants - ""I've gone about as far as I can go with this body here..."" Richard Jenkins secretly pines for McDormand and tries to let her know he's interested even without the expensive surgery.A MacGuffin is produced by the Malkovich character, who decides since he's left the CIA to write a memoir. The Swinton character copies Malkovich's computer files planning for divorce and wanting financial records, and the disc which incidentally includes Malkovich's memoirs is found at the gym where Pitt and McDormand work. Dimwit Pitt concludes that this CIA memoir is valuable spy stuff and he conspires with McDormand to offer the disc to the Russians to pay for McDormand's plastic surgery.""The Russians?!"" J.K. Simmons asks in amused confusion as a CIA superior when he is informed by Malkovich's former boss, played by David Rasche. Although they appear only briefly, Simmons and Rasche produce a couple of the film's best scenes, including the side-splitting conclusion where the ""loose ends"" are tied as only the Coens can. I could say more, but that would deprive you of the pleasure of finding out for yourself.And you should.",5,The Coen Brothers return to Comedy,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,3526,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'make', 'movies', 'are', 'right', 'angles', 'most', 'rest', 'Hollywood', 'dramas', 'going', 'back', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'have', 'refreshing', 'splash', 'humor', 'comedies', 'going', 'back', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'have', 'dark', 'elements', 'Coen', 'are', 'so', 'adept', 'crossing', 'stylishly', 'one', 'genre', 'surprise', 'grim', 'Oscar-winning', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'followed', 'delightfully', 'twisted', 'comedy.I', 'repeatedly', 'find', 'Coen', 'comedies', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'entertainly', 'dumb', 'happens', 'so', 'often', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'unaware', 'stupidity', 'Think', 'back', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'Coens', 'have', 'assembled', 'performers', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'rip', 'script', 'would', 'be', 'part', 'hilarious', 'part', 'ridiculous', 'ridiculous', 'were', 'not', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movie.Brad', 'Pitt', 'prominently', 'film', 'ad', 'campaign', 'sublime', 'airheaded', 'fitness', 'trainer', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'say', 'star', 'half', 'dozen', 'characters', 'share', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'edgy', 'profanity', 'not-as-smart-as-he-thinks-he-is', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'who', 'rather', 'take', 'demotion', 'when', 'bosses', 'confront', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'superbly', 'cast', 'icy', 'wife', 'not', 'only', 'reprising', 'White', 'Witch', 'character', 'Narnia', 'also', 'cold-blooded', 'lawyer', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Swinton', 'pediatrician', 'kind', 'children', 'cry', ""n't"", 'care', 'Swinton', 'having', 'affair', 'Clayton', 'co-star', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'expertly', 'Coen', 'Clown', 'time', 'ex', 'government', 'protection', 'agent', 'who', 'never', 'once', 'discharged', 'weapon', 'years', 'service', 'character', 'cocktail', 'party', 'could', 'use', 'pistol', 'needed', 'reflexes', 'take', 'muscle', 'memory', 'reflexes', 'complicate', 'plot', 'way', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'Coenesque', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'much', 'best', 'work', 'husband', 'Joel', 'brother-in-law', 'Ethan', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Fargo', 'here', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Pitt', 'dim-witted', 'fitness', 'center', 'co-worker', 'McDormand', 'poignant', 'funny', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'extremely', 'reliable', 'Jeffrey', 'DeMunn', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Law', 'Order', 'discuss', 'four', 'separate', 'operations', 'desperately', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'body', 'here', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'secretly', 'McDormand', 'tries', 'let', 'know', 'interested', 'even', 'expensive', 'surgery.A', 'MacGuffin', 'produced', 'Malkovich', 'character', 'who', 'left', 'CIA', 'write', 'memoir', 'Swinton', 'character', 'copies', 'Malkovich', 'computer', 'planning', 'divorce', 'wanting', 'financial', 'records', 'disc', 'incidentally', 'Malkovich', 'memoirs', 'found', 'gym', 'where', 'Pitt', 'McDormand', 'work', 'Dimwit', 'Pitt', 'CIA', 'memoir', 'valuable', 'spy', 'stuff', 'McDormand', 'offer', 'disc', 'Russians', 'pay', 'McDormand', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Russians', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'amused', 'confusion', 'CIA', 'superior', 'when', 'informed', 'Malkovich', 'former', 'boss', 'played', 'David', 'Rasche', 'appear', 'only', 'briefly', 'Simmons', 'Rasche', 'produce', 'couple', 'film', 'best', 'scenes', 'including', 'side-splitting', 'conclusion', 'where', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'only', 'Coens', 'can', 'could', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'deprive', 'pleasure', 'finding', 'out', 'yourself.And', 'should']",N/A

This is one of those ""comedies"" where you're watching the movie, wondering if the funny part is supposed to be happening yet.The way I hear it, the movie got made as follows:  The Coen brothers took the script to the money people, who soon realized it wasn't funny in the least.  They pointed this out as a serious obstacle, whereupon the Coen brothers said, ""Yeah, but dig this:  we'll cut the budget down to nothing by shooting the action as a variety of interior scenes in somebody's house.

And (3) the 'lighter' comedies (Intolerable Cruelty, Ladykillers).Burn After Reading belongs imo to category 3.

1204903,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B001IZNIZU,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[5, 16]","Some years ago I was at a taping of a sit-com in Hollywood, and during a long lull in the action, the producers sent out a professional comedian to keep the audience in the mood to obey the huge LAUGH signs that stared at us like the muzzles of a firing squad. The comedian was a respected guy, a comedy-club-circuit regular who had appeared on talk shows and broadcast specials, and he immediately pitched into a very long, complex, involved joke about cancer. The joke wasn't funny, in fact it was confusing, depressing and somewhat tedious, but we all assumed the punch-line was there and would make everything we'd listened to over those long uncomfortable minutes of build-up retroactively hilarious.  Alas, we were wrong, and what we got instead of laughs was a sort of unintentional Grandpa Simpson imitation - a disjointed ramble of a story that goes nowhere and only makes you wish you hadn't started listening.BURN AFTER READING reminded me strongly of this incident. The talent assembled is massive, all the ingredients for funny are in place, but funny never happens. Instead, you get two hours of depressing, squalid black humor from which the humor has been surgically removed, leaving behind a joyless, uncomfortable little movie that seems to want to laugh at the human condition but can't muster up more than a few sadistic grunts.The movie's premise, which couples six degrees of separation with chaos theory, is as follows. An unhappy CIA analyst (John Malkovich) with anger issues quits his job and decides to write his memiors. Unbenknownst to him, unhappy British wife is cheating on him with a sleazy, self-involved ex-Federal Marshal played by George Clooney. The ice queen wants to divorce her husband and marry the already-married Clooney, so at the behest of her attorney, she steals what she thinks are his financial records of f his computer, only to lose them at a local gym. There, the records, which are actually the memiors and filled with secret information, are recovered by a submoronic personal trainer played by Brad Pitt, who takes them to his co-worker Frances McDormand. Frances is unhappy with her love life and takes to dating on the Internet, with depressing results. She is also unhappy with her body and wants plastic surgery, but can't get her HMO to pay, so she decides to blackmail Malkovich to get the money, with Pitt's help. At the same time, she takes up with Clooney, who despite his own marriage, and the fact he  has promised to divorce his wife and marry the British ice queen, is sleeping with everything under the sun. Thus everyone in the movie becomes linked to everyone else by circumstance, and without even knowing it, works at cross-purposes with greater and greater intensity until, whammo, people start to die.If all this sounds convoluted, it is. In fact, there is a scene where a CIA man (David Rasche) tries to explain to his boss (J.K. Simmons) what the hell is going on with all these thefts, murders and blackmail schemes, and finds he can't do it - it is all too tediously inexplicable. But convolution is not the movie's real problem. What is wrong with BURN AFTER READING, aside from the glacial pace, is the way it tackles its subject matter. Black comedies, the Coen brothers specialty, depend on finding humor in horror, but in this movie there is neither humor nor horror, there are only a series of squalid vignettes that take the worst possible view of modern life and human nature. The scenes of McDormand trying to date via the Internet, or Malkovich trying to justify his decision to quit the CIA to his vegetative father while, unbeknownst to him, his wife is sleeping with someone else, are pathetic and depressing.  The ""running gag"" of watching Malkovich's neatly ordered life destroyed by divorce is about as funny as chemotherapy, and I'm sorry, but the fact the producers intended this to be funny doesn't make it so.

His wife (Tilda Swinton), who is having an affair with U.S. Marshal George Clooney, is planning to divorce John and, upon advice of her attorney, she copies various files from her husband's hard drive...including his book notes.In a roundabout way, the computer disc falls into the hands of two moronic gym employees (Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt), who blackmail Malcovich for its return.  When he doesn't pay, they decide to sell it elsewhere.Events quickly spiral out-of-control as all of the characters' lives converge toward an outrageous climax that is classic Coen Brothers.The entire cast, which also includes Richard Jenkins and J.K.

Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) has quit his analyst job at the CIA rather than be demoted on account of his drinking problem. His frosty bourgeois wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), a pediatrician who couldn't be less suited to the job, considers the loss of income good reason for divorce. Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is a bubble-headed gym employee in desperate want of four expensive cosmetic surgeries. When a CD containing Osbourne's memoir-in progress is found in the gym's locker room, Linda's buff, vapid co-worker Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) deduces that it is top secret stuff. Linda sees an opportunity to get her surgeries and impress her new lover Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), who makes a hobby of meeting women through an internet dating service, in spite of having a wife and a mistress, Katie.This overcomplicated plot is in contrast to Joel and Ethan Coen's last film, ""No Country for Old Men"", whose structure was a simple chase. Everyone is connected to everyone else and to that blasted CD without knowing it. The deadpan incredulity of two CIA bureaucrats who are trying to sort it all out produces some of the film's best lines. There has been criticism that Linda and Chad are too stupid to be interesting or sympathetic, but all characters involved in the cockamamie schemes that are the basis of most thrillers are, in fact, stupid, and the brothers Coen are making fun of that here. Brad Pitt's cheerful dim-bulb Chad is one of his most memorable performances. And though we're immersed in dumbness, minor characters and well-placed set decoration fill the film out with more subtle comedy. As to whether ""Burn After Reading"" makes a political statement, well, the CIA sweeps the carnage under the carpet without trying very hard to understand what's going on. Under those circumstances, we might all do the same. But I wonder if the Coens did not mean something by it.The DVD (Universal 2008): There are 3 featurettes. ""Finding the Burn"" (6 min) interviews Joel and Ethan Coen about the film and some of the cast about working with the Coens. ""DC Insiders Run Amok"" (12 min) interviews the Coens about how they conceived the story and writing roles for particular actors. The cast talk about their characters. Costume designer Mary Zophres chimes in with the ideas behind the costumes. And production designer Jess Gonchor discusses shooting in New York for Georgetown. ""Welcome Back George"" (3 min) in an interview with Clooney in which he talks about the parts the Coens have written for him.

Not so here - nothing remotely ""delightful"" about the slobs in this movie, except in their self-seriousness they are occasionally funny.  Brad Pitt is cute and dumb (what an acting stretch!), John Malkovich is surly and obnoxious (another acting stretch), George Clooney is sexy and promiscuous (yet another stretch), and Tilda Swinton is a cold, acid-tongued harpy (a 4th stretch).  Frances McDormand has managed to avoid such type-casting in her various roles. Here she is an agreeable but super-shallow and super-selfish health club employee who can't figure why her insurance company won't pay for the numerous plastic surgeries that she ""requires"" to ""reinvent herself,"" but the ticket to fast money just might be a CD found in the health club locker room, so she and dumb Pitt try to sell the ""secrets"" (which in fact are worthless) to the Russian embassy.  This plot line intertwines with the story of curmudgeon Malkovich quitting his job at the CIA, angering his money-loving wife (who is having a fling with the married Clooney, and so is every other woman in DC), who intends to divorce him once she gets a fix on his money situation.These are NOT nice people, but for about 90 minutes they're rather enjoyable to watch, rather pathetic specimens of humankind, even tough Clooney, Swinton, and Malkovich move in the elite circles of Washington insiders.  McDormand's character gets most of the laughs, with her ""positive thinking"" approach to her ludicrous attempt to milk some money from the worthless ""secrets"" on the CD.  Everyone seems to be sleeping with everyone else, and McDormand meets Clooney (who takes off his wedding band) through a computer dating service, then the next day gushes to her boss about Clooney's ""sincerity.""Early in the movie, Clooney reveals - twice - that he has carried a gun for 20 years but has never had a need to use it.  Obviously there comes a point in the movie where he finally gets to use the gun, a plot point I will not spoil, except to say that it is both funny and gut-wrenching.This is not a movie for the kids, since roughly a third of Malkovich's lines are the F word, while Pitt seems fixated on the S word. There is a scene in Clooney's basement with a cleverly constructed ""pleasure chair"" which seems to add nothing to the plot, and I'm still puzzling over why the scene was included.  One of McDormand's dates keeps his glasses on while having sex (the best sex scenes in movies tend to be funny, not erotic).If the federal government really does have people like this running the show, God help us all.

Disagree with me all you like; reviews are opinion based, and this is my opinion. That's all it is. If you loved the movie, don't take my review personally.The Coen brothers usually make a fantastic movie. ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", and ""No Country for Old Men"" are all five star films in my book. Even their lesser known movies are great, with the exception of the boring ""Lady Killers"". Coming on the heels of ""No County for Old Men"", my expectation level for ""Burn After Reading"" was high. Not unfairly high; I didn't expect another award winner, jut an entertaining movie with a quality story and descent acting. What I got was a fairly pointless melodramatic movie with characters it was hard to empathize with, like, or want to see succeed.No, this is not an awful movie that is impossible to watch (well maybe during Clooney's ridiculously camera-aware mugging near the end of the film) but it isn't up to the Coen's usual standards either. All the elements of a good movie are there: quality name actors, a plot that is a highly sarcastic take on a pumped-up spy thriller, and the Coen's typical evocative camera work. What's missing is that cohesiveness that makes a movie not just a collection of good ingredients, but a finished product.This is a movie about stupid people doing stupid things. There is no real plot; the characters careen about in their self-absorbed turbidity, digging themselves deeper and deeper into trouble. Each character seems totally incapable of self examination. The characters do not grow or change at all during the entire film. Black comedy is something the Coens are usually adept at. Unfortunately, in this film they seem more concerned with shock value and impressing the viewer with their sly wit. It feels like they are snickering with glee over their own intelligence at having imagined such sad, stupid, and shallow characters.Every character in the film is remarkably unlikable with the possible exception of John Malkovich's recently fired, drunken, former CIA employee crotchetiness. Clooney, who I usually think does a fantastic job, (see ""Syriana"" or ""Michael Clayton"") is almost unbearable he's so self absorbed and aware of the camera. He even appears to be mugging at times. Pitt's character is funny, but doesn't stick around long enough to be more than a footnote. The acting isn't bad overall, it just that the characters are so miserable that it's hard to appreciate it.This is a movie you can definitely watch just once. I know I'll likely get lit up for giving a relatively popular movie a negative review, but honestly, if Fargo is a 5, and No Country for Old Men is a 5, how can you put this movie in the same league as those films? Even 4 stars seems excessive for a movie as light as this one. I can't argue with 3 stars if you really liked the movie, but the reality is that I didn't like it at all and never will. Rent this one if you have to see it, but don't waste your money buying it.",2,Burn after watching,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,3032,"['First', 'off', 'reviewing', 'popular', 'movie', 'negatively', 'never', 'popular', 'choice', 'Disagree', 'like', 'reviews', 'are', 'opinion', 'based', 'opinion', 'loved', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'review', 'personally.The', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'usually', 'make', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'Fargo', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'are', 'five', 'star', 'films', 'book', 'Even', 'lesser', 'known', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'exception', 'boring', 'Lady', 'Killers', 'Coming', 'heels', 'No', 'County', 'Old', 'Men', 'expectation', 'level', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'was', 'high', 'Not', 'unfairly', 'high', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'award', 'winner', 'jut', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'quality', 'story', 'descent', 'acting', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'fairly', 'pointless', 'melodramatic', 'movie', 'characters', 'was', 'hard', 'empathize', 'want', 'see', 'succeed.No', 'not', 'awful', 'movie', 'impossible', 'watch', 'well', 'maybe', 'Clooney', 'ridiculously', 'camera-aware', 'mugging', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'up', 'Coen', 'usual', 'standards', 'elements', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'there', 'quality', 'name', 'actors', 'plot', 'highly', 'sarcastic', 'take', 'pumped-up', 'spy', 'thriller', 'Coen', 'typical', 'evocative', 'camera', 'work', 'What', 'missing', 'cohesiveness', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'collection', 'good', 'ingredients', 'finished', 'product.This', 'movie', 'stupid', 'people', 'doing', 'stupid', 'things', 'real', 'plot', 'characters', 'careen', 'self-absorbed', 'turbidity', 'digging', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'trouble', 'character', 'totally', 'incapable', 'self', 'examination', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'grow', 'change', 'entire', 'film', 'Black', 'comedy', 'something', 'Coens', 'are', 'usually', 'adept', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'concerned', 'shock', 'value', 'impressing', 'viewer', 'sly', 'wit', 'are', 'snickering', 'glee', 'own', 'intelligence', 'having', 'imagined', 'such', 'sad', 'stupid', 'shallow', 'characters.Every', 'character', 'film', 'remarkably', 'unlikable', 'possible', 'exception', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'recently', 'fired', 'drunken', 'former', 'CIA', 'employee', 'crotchetiness', 'Clooney', 'who', 'usually', 'think', 'fantastic', 'job', 'see', 'Syriana', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'so', 'self', 'absorbed', 'aware', 'camera', 'even', 'be', 'mugging', 'times', 'Pitt', 'character', 'funny', ""n't"", 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'more', 'footnote', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'overall', 'just', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'miserable', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'it.This', 'movie', 'can', 'definitely', 'watch', 'just', 'once', 'know', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'get', 'lit', 'up', 'giving', 'relatively', 'popular', 'movie', 'negative', 'review', 'honestly', 'Fargo', '5', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', '5', 'how', 'can', 'put', 'movie', 'same', 'league', 'films', 'Even', '4', 'stars', 'excessive', 'movie', 'as', 'light', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', '3', 'stars', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'reality', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'never', 'will', 'Rent', 'one', 'have', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying']",N/A

The film's nothing more than a mish-mash of unremarkable sequences.By about midway through the film, you know it's not going to amount to anything much. One of the characters reveals a strange home invention that is either meant to shock the audience into laughter, or reveal something odd about the character, because as yet he has no depth. It's like when it starts raining toads in ""Magnolia"" (1999). When the home invention scene fails, the Coens try for shock value with a repulsive scene in which John Malkovitch hacks to death poor Richard Jenkins.What is particularly annoying is that the performances of Malkovitch, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt and J K Simmons are simply amalgamations of characters they each played in earlier films.  Further, if you have seen the film, imagine if Tilda Swinton's character were removed completely - would this be consequential?""Burn After Reading"" has been touted as a quirky comedy/thriller.

John Malkovich stars as Osbourne Cox, who upon getting booted from the CIA, begins to write his memoirs, much to the chagrin of his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) who is having an affair with womanizing marshall Harry (George Clooney), who himself is seeing an avid internet dater (Frances McDormand) who, along with her dim-witted personal trainer co-worker Chad (Brad Pitt) stumble upon a disc and decide to get some cash out of Osbourne for it.  Got all that?  Yes, there's a lot going on in Burn After Reading to be sure, and while it all is a bit convoluted, it remains the most purely entertaining film from the Coen brothers since The Big Lebowski.

Weird echoes.The acting is well done, for what it is, and in a weird twist of fate, Brad Pitt actually fails to make it to the end of the movie.  How awesome is that?!?!!!

Instead, he or she should say, ""I like *this* piece of this artist, and I like that one by the other fellow.""The rationale is that artists, like brand names, should not be counted on to be consistent in their ability to please us, the viewers.  If we did, and they consistently delivered, that would mean they have ceased taking chances and risks.  In other words, they cease being artists.And that would leave us being mindless consumers who are predisposed to anything with their name on it.  In many parts of the world, these mindless consumers are also known as Label Wh*res.I love No Country For Old Men, but to compare one work of art with another would also be unfair to the leagues of apple and orange.What we have here is poor John Malkovich (playing Osbourne Cox) being victimized once again, by a throng of mediocre hoi polloi.  Instead of John Cusack and Cameron Diaz, it is now Cohen veteran Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt.  Coming across one of his possessions, they plot a nitwit ransom scheme to extort money out of this recently fired, ex-CIA employee.  Cox's friend, played by George Clooney overacts his comic seriousness across from his extramarital partner, Tilda Swinton's odious British expat wife of Cox's.  All this weaves in and out of government officials who have less clue than a pair of absolute beginners, the gym staff Pitt and McDormand.The most entertaining inference is the notion that the powers that be are so fragile in its checks-and-balances that a country and its government could be brought down by the incompetence of the people it is suppose to serve and protect.The combination of the characters beleaguering Malkovich's character, and the forces their lack of articulation invariably sets in motion, makes a viewer squirm in her seat, making her want to tear her hair out, and scream for just one capable person to take ownership of the plot.Osbourne Cox is the personification of such an outrage.And what happens to Cox in the end, is what Burn After Reading does to our outrage.I felt a trace of playwright Joe Orton's absurd comedy of errors, but honestly, given  the amount of talent, this could have been a more engaging film.  Instead, it feels more like Hollywood powerplayers getting together to give each other backrubs on some bartered budget.I originally gave it 2 stars.  But I added one additional star because the movie has inspired me to go make that special chair that Clooney's character whipped up in the basement.",3,"Whatever it is we learned from this, hopefully we learned not to do it again",1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,2590,"['was', 'once', 'told', 'aesthete', 'should', 'never', 'state', 'works', 'one', 'particular', 'artist', 'Instead', 'should', 'say', 'like', '*this*', 'piece', 'artist', 'like', 'one', 'other', 'fellow', 'rationale', 'artists', 'brand', 'names', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'counted', 'be', 'consistent', 'ability', 'please', 'viewers', 'did', 'consistently', 'delivered', 'would', 'mean', 'have', 'ceased', 'taking', 'chances', 'risks', 'other', 'words', 'cease', 'being', 'artists.And', 'would', 'leave', 'being', 'mindless', 'consumers', 'who', 'are', 'predisposed', 'anything', 'name', 'many', 'parts', 'world', 'mindless', 'consumers', 'are', 'also', 'known', 'Label', 'Wh*res.I', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'compare', 'one', 'work', 'art', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'unfair', 'leagues', 'apple', 'have', 'here', 'poor', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'playing', 'Osbourne', 'Cox', 'being', 'victimized', 'once', 'again', 'throng', 'mediocre', 'hoi', 'polloi', 'Instead', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'now', 'Cohen', 'veteran', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Coming', 'one', 'possessions', 'plot', 'nitwit', 'ransom', 'scheme', 'extort', 'money', 'recently', 'fired', 'ex-CIA', 'employee', 'Cox', 'friend', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'comic', 'seriousness', 'extramarital', 'partner', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'odious', 'British', 'expat', 'wife', 'Cox', 'government', 'officials', 'who', 'have', 'less', 'clue', 'pair', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'gym', 'staff', 'Pitt', 'McDormand.The', 'most', 'entertaining', 'inference', 'notion', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'so', 'fragile', 'checks-and-balances', 'country', 'government', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'down', 'incompetence', 'people', 'suppose', 'serve', 'protect.The', 'combination', 'characters', 'beleaguering', 'Malkovich', 'character', 'forces', 'lack', 'articulation', 'invariably', 'motion', 'viewer', 'squirm', 'seat', 'making', 'want', 'tear', 'hair', 'scream', 'just', 'one', 'capable', 'person', 'take', 'ownership', 'plot.Osbourne', 'Cox', 'personification', 'such', 'outrage.And', 'what', 'Cox', 'end', 'what', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'outrage.I', 'felt', 'trace', 'playwright', 'Joe', 'Orton', 'absurd', 'comedy', 'errors', 'honestly', 'given', 'amount', 'talent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'engaging', 'film', 'Instead', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'powerplayers', 'getting', 'together', 'give', 'other', 'backrubs', 'bartered', 'budget.I', 'originally', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'added', 'one', 'additional', 'star', 'movie', 'inspired', 'go', 'make', 'special', 'chair', 'Clooney', 'character', 'whipped', 'up', 'basement']",N/A

They've never missed in their casting choices, and once again we have a bunch of clueless crazies. Indeed, Brad Pitt took Johnny Suede to new heights and beyond. The always reliable Frances McDormand looks as if nothing could be more fun, and Clooney and Malkovich are so very intense, creating outrageously lovable idiots. Tilda Swinton is the only grounded character, with that glint of satiric bitchiness that is most enjoyable. Richard Jenkins is also grounded, though baffled by the insanity. I can't blab away the plot, as others did, but suffice it to say that this is a story about bad decisions taken way beyond comprehension. It's no end of fun, and if you pay attention, you'll be breathless when it's over. Terrific film, and another feather in the enigmatic hat of the Coen brothers. They cannot be labelled, out-guessed or pinned down in any genre; they succeed in all: ""Miller's Crossing"", ""O Brother..."", ""No Country..."",  and, especially, their first, ""Blood Simple"".

I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to warn others about this movie.SPOILER ALERT: The trailer and clips had almost all of the good clips, which happen in the first part of the movie. It starts out as off beat and quirky and moves along well. [Be warned, there is an exceptional use of the ""F"" word from the very first scene]. Then it just turns mean and violent. One of the main characters, unexpectedly, has his head blown off and another gets shot and then has a hatchet taken to him. Then, it has a weak ending, almost like a throw off scene. This movie is NOT what it appears in the trailer or previews.One way we judge a film is if we really like or ""root for"" any of the characters. In the end, there are no really likable characters in the movie and we didn't root for them. We just disliked them. Granted, this has a terrific cast.

They create characters that are at the same time very unique and yet, someone you feel you know from your daily life. Everyone in this film is someone you know, from the idiotic Brad Pitt character (full of aimless confidence) to the talkative, non-listening Frances McDormand character (""I need a can-do guy, and you're all defeated""). From the scheming doctor Tilda Swinton ([to child]""take your meds, open up!"") to her hilariously resigned divorce lawyer (""this where I'm obliged to ask my clients to ""give it an extra day"").The entire ""blackmailing the CIA agent"" plot in order to pay for Frances McDormand's character's plastic surgery was such a bungling and hilarious mess despite people getting hacked to death with hatchets and shot in the head that I was laughing all the way.When she went to the Russian Embassy and gave them the ENTIRE CD ROM they found(not a diminished copy) and said, ""This is just a taste."" I literally spit out what I was drinking at the time. I mean, what did she hope to achieve by turning the personal memoirs of a CIA Analyst over to the Russians? Everyone's reactions about this from John Malkovich's character through to the CIA big wigs kept me in stitches.I don't why people hated this film, I hope they weren't expecting a Michael Clayton or something like that. I saw many very intelligent actors and actresses supressing their intellects but not in a sad way. I haven't seen George Clooney's character this dumb since Brother, Where Art Thou.As for George Clooney's character, he is still a bit of a mystery. I have no idea what he wanted to achieve with all of his affairs and ""home projects."" I don't know why he finally used his weapon ""after 20 years of PP(People Protection) etc."" His sudden transformation after thinking the CIA was after him was almost out of character if I only knew what his character was.The over-dramatic soundtrack sounding at first like the Terminator theme of drum sticks on steel trash cans and the ""incoming data"" like blip of the scrolling credits can be disarming at first making you feel that you're stepping into a spy thriller (which, Frances and Brad's characters obviously thought they were) but it adds to the deep layer of satire that only the Coen Bros. are capable of.If you like cookie cutter characters with predictable plots, then this flick is not for you.

1204944,A6FIAB28IS79,B001IZNIZU,Samuel Chell,"[1, 2]","The same repeated four-letter word that I eventually found tiresome in ""District 9"" is uncommonly effective in this film, allowing us to look inside characters whose pasts otherwise would suggest their differences are insurmountable to one another.  Yet each of these characters--from a former Greek orthodox priest to a rock-brained, uncoordinated ""Hard Body"" employee (Pitt) to a middle-aged bimbo (Francis McDormand) whose life would be complete with $25,000 for cosmetic surgery to Princeton graduates (John Malkovich) and over-sexed government operatives (Clooney)  to physicians to CIA brass--are recognizable, pathetic, self-centered human beings seeking satisfaction in the very places that destroy them.  It's a fallen world--not merely in need of redemption but of enlightenment and knowledge that can't be taught, even in a language more rich and expressive than the profane one they all embrace.The closest character to a redemptive figure in this film, which I watched on Good Friday, is the former Greek orthodox priest (at a time when we hear of even higher percentages of deviant unholy celibates).  He alone acts for what he perceives to be the good of someone he genuinely cares about, and he alone would be the most likely candidate capable of receiving and reciprocating genuine love.  Yet in a world where selfishness and chance account for all human actions, the poor selfless priest doesn't have a prayer.  He's mistakenly identified as the wrong lover of the wrong woman, whom he tries to help, and he's spared from a fatal gunshot wound only because of the lousy aim of drunken ex-CIA agent John Malkevitch, who takes after him into the street with a tool and pounds him to death.Doubtless, many negative ratings reflect the disappointment of fans of Pitt and Clooney, who play, against type, mindless dolts and 3rd-rate wife-swappers respectively.  Moreover, the Coen Brothers go to great lengths with make-up (or lack of it) to show that, as with the mono-vocabulary, these are limited beings, more grotesque than holy (more grotesque, in fact, than the thin-waisted aliens of District 9).I'll admit that 5 stars is a bit generous, but the reviews of less than 4 stars stem more from extra-filmic concerns like Brad Pitt being snuffed with much film time remaining or George Clooney suddenly becoming decidedly non-genteel.  But this film is as much of a gem as--in some respects better than--""Fargo,"" more indebted to the master, Alfred Hitchock, than any other films in recent memory (it was Hitch who shocked and disappointed audiences throughout the world when he had his popular star erased in the shower scene half-way through the film).  But the shot setups, camera angles, lighting--they're all carefully planned and executed with the precision and cinematic know-how of Hitchock.And though I don't wish to question ""Fargo""'s unique achievement, ""Burn After Reading"" goes further than the quaint regionalisms and unlikely protagonists of ""Fargo""  just as it surpasses any of the recent comic-book, overkill, shoot-em-up juvenilia of Quentin Tarentino.  The Coen brothers simply refuse to make concessions to the audience in terms of satisfying and titillating them with formula fairy tale stuff.  Instead, they construct a vision of life that, for all of its grim but frequently very funny impact (how can you help but not recognize your worst, duplicitous self?), is a vision of the human carnival, of an existential world devoid of the Hollywood-scripted absolutes and deus ex machina that amount to no more than fantasy and projection.At the end of the tale, it is only Linda (McDormand) who realizes her dream.  We wish her well, knowing she's likely to be the worse for it.  But what none of us knows, including the characters and the head of the CIA, is how such a comedy errors--deadly, bloody, fatal ones--ever happened.  The CIA chief asks, ""What can we learn from this?""  Then, in his concluding remark, vows never to do it again. The only problem, he adds, is that he has no idea what they did.Indeed, the Coen brothers seem to be saying, if Grace were ever needed for a world that can't get its act together, the time was never more critical than now.",5,"Fun as Fargo, but don't get the Blu-ray because of Pitt and Clooney",1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,4198,"['same', 'repeated', 'four-letter', 'word', 'eventually', 'found', 'tiresome', 'District', '9', 'uncommonly', 'effective', 'film', 'allowing', 'look', 'inside', 'characters', 'pasts', 'otherwise', 'would', 'suggest', 'differences', 'are', 'insurmountable', 'one', 'characters', 'former', 'Greek', 'orthodox', 'priest', 'rock-brained', 'uncoordinated', 'Hard', 'Body', 'employee', 'Pitt', 'middle-aged', 'bimbo', 'Francis', 'McDormand', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'complete', '25,000', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'Princeton', 'graduates', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'over-sexed', 'government', 'operatives', 'Clooney', 'physicians', 'CIA', 'brass', 'are', 'recognizable', 'pathetic', 'self-centered', 'human', 'beings', 'seeking', 'satisfaction', 'very', 'destroy', 'fallen', 'world', 'not', 'merely', 'need', 'redemption', 'enlightenment', 'knowledge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taught', 'even', 'language', 'more', 'rich', 'expressive', 'profane', 'one', 'embrace.The', 'closest', 'character', 'redemptive', 'figure', 'film', 'watched', 'Good', 'Friday', 'former', 'Greek', 'orthodox', 'priest', 'time', 'when', 'hear', 'even', 'higher', 'percentages', 'deviant', 'unholy', 'celibates', 'alone', 'what', 'be', 'good', 'someone', 'genuinely', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'likely', 'candidate', 'capable', 'receiving', 'reciprocating', 'genuine', 'love', 'world', 'where', 'selfishness', 'chance', 'account', 'human', 'actions', 'poor', 'selfless', 'priest', ""n't"", 'have', 'prayer', 'mistakenly', 'identified', 'wrong', 'lover', 'wrong', 'woman', 'whom', 'help', 'spared', 'fatal', 'gunshot', 'only', 'lousy', 'aim', 'drunken', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'John', 'Malkevitch', 'who', 'street', 'tool', 'death.Doubtless', 'many', 'negative', 'ratings', 'reflect', 'disappointment', 'fans', 'Pitt', 'Clooney', 'who', 'play', 'type', 'mindless', 'dolts', '3rd-rate', 'wife-swappers', 'respectively', 'Moreover', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'make-up', 'lack', 'show', 'that', 'mono-vocabulary', 'are', 'limited', 'beings', 'more', 'grotesque', 'holy', 'more', 'grotesque', 'fact', 'thin-waisted', 'aliens', 'District', '9', '.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', '5', 'stars', 'bit', 'generous', 'reviews', 'less', '4', 'stars', 'stem', 'more', 'extra-filmic', 'concerns', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'being', 'snuffed', 'much', 'film', 'time', 'remaining', 'George', 'Clooney', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'decidedly', 'non-genteel', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'gem', 'respects', 'better', 'Fargo', 'more', 'indebted', 'master', 'Alfred', 'Hitchock', 'other', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'was', 'Hitch', 'who', 'shocked', 'disappointed', 'audiences', 'world', 'when', 'had', 'popular', 'star', 'erased', 'shower', 'scene', 'half-way', 'film', 'shot', 'setups', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', ""'re"", 'carefully', 'planned', 'executed', 'precision', 'cinematic', 'know-how', 'Hitchock.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'question', 'Fargo', 'unique', 'achievement', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'further', 'quaint', 'regionalisms', 'unlikely', 'protagonists', 'Fargo', 'just', 'recent', 'comic-book', 'overkill', 'shoot-em-up', 'juvenilia', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'simply', 'refuse', 'make', 'concessions', 'audience', 'terms', 'satisfying', 'titillating', 'formula', 'fairy', 'tale', 'stuff', 'Instead', 'construct', 'vision', 'life', 'grim', 'frequently', 'very', 'funny', 'impact', 'how', 'can', 'help', 'not', 'recognize', 'worst', 'duplicitous', 'self', 'vision', 'human', 'carnival', 'existential', 'world', 'devoid', 'Hollywood-scripted', 'absolutes', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'amount', 'more', 'fantasy', 'projection.At', 'end', 'tale', 'only', 'Linda', 'McDormand', 'who', 'dream', 'wish', 'well', 'knowing', 'likely', 'be', 'worse', 'what', 'none', 'knows', 'including', 'characters', 'head', 'CIA', 'how', 'such', 'comedy', 'errors', 'deadly', 'bloody', 'fatal', 'ones', 'ever', 'happened', 'CIA', 'chief', 'asks', 'What', 'can', 'learn', 'Then', 'concluding', 'remark', 'never', 'do', 'again', 'only', 'problem', 'idea', 'what', 'did.Indeed', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'seem', 'be', 'saying', 'Grace', 'were', 'ever', 'needed', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'act', 'together', 'time', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'critical', 'now']",N/A

It's a title that receives very little recognition and it regularly features in sales. Why is that the case?The movie is directed by the Coen brothers and stars Clooney, Pitt, McDormand, Malkovich and Swinton. What's not to like?I'm hard to please when it comes to humor, but several Coen brothers films hit the spot. It's clever dialogue rather than slapstick physical humor, and some of it is unpredictable. I can't laugh when I see a joke coming from a mile away wearing a T-shirt with ""This is funny, laugh now"" written on it. I like to be surprised.So what is surprising about Burn After Reading?Harry Pfarrer (Clooney) has no redeeming features. He's married, but sees other women at every opportunity. He's having an affair with Katie Cox (Swinton). Harry is shallow, paranoid and somewhat stupid and Clooney plays the character with his usual charm and good humor.If there is anyone dumber than Harry, it has to be Chad Feldheimer (Pitt), who works in a gym. Chad is a complete idiot in every way. His friend at the gym is Linda Litzke (McDormand), who is obsessed with undergoing cosmetic surgery to improve her appearance.Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is married to Katie and works as an analyst for the CIA. Most of his sentences include at least one profanity and he's borderline alcoholic. The story begins with a meeting in which Osborne is told that he will be demoted, but instead of accepting the situation, he quits. Katie is not pleased, even though she's on the verge of leaving him for Harry.There's not much of a plot. Chad acquires a CD containing the beginning of Osborne's memoir and believes it to be secrets of national importance. He thinks that Osborne is sure to give him a reward if he returns it and that leads to an amusing phone call. Linda decides that the Russians may be interested in the worthless CD and that they might reward her for the useless information.Everybody seems to be sleeping with everyone else and what could go wrong does go wrong. This is not a serious story in any way.There's a great cameo by J. K. Simmons who plays a CIA boss. He's utterly clueless about the significance of the events we witness because they are all meaningless. Watch his reaction at the end of the movie when he makes a decision about what further action to take.Burn After Reading is a good way to spend an hour-and-a-half. No analysis is necessary.

He is so angry that he quits, and begins writing his memoirs. A CD containing his writings falls into the hands of two gym workers, played by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand.

""Burn After Reading"" is a mildly amusing spy farce that gets by mainly on the strength of the stars, especially Brad Pitt, playing way against type. Everyone is in bed with each other, and only Frances McDormand seems less than madly paranoid. But that is only because she is oblivious to everything except her goal of plastic surgeries.Her target is suddenly in view when she and Chad (Pitt) find a computer disc containing the files of one Ozzy Cox, an alcoholic ex-CIA agent who decides to write his ""explosive memoir."" The clueless duo think Cox's disc actually contains government secrets, and decide to blackmail Ozzy. Clooney is having an affair with Ozzy's wife. Linda is using computer dating and hooks up with Clooney. Clooney and Pitt have an encounter that ties them to Linda in an unfortunate manner. Ozzy's wife is spying on Ozzy, but Clooney thinks they're following him. Pitt thinks the government is chasing him for the ""Secrets,"" and Ozzy is falling deeper and deeper into a drunk funk. Meanwhile at the CIA, Ozzy's disc has set things into motion that a hapless JK Simmons keeps getting debriefed on but can't keep track of.And if the head of the CIA can't follow them, it might just be hard for mere viewers. ""Burn After Reading"" is a labyrinthine 90 minutes with several spikes of wicked humor but also a caper-load of mugging. Malkoviich's Ozzy Cox is the same intense crank you've seen him do a million times, and Clooney is an obsessive womanizer with way too many tics. Pitt and McDormand make the most of their empty-headed schemers, and in a minor role, Richard Jenkins is likely the most sympathetic characther in the whole film.""Burn After Reading"" is not the epic upset to spy comedies likeNo Country for Old Menwas to westerns, but it will provide an interesting diversion for Coen Brothers fans.

They have been nominated for best picture for 'Fargo', created one of the greatest cult classics in 'The Big Lebowski and got Oscar gold with 'No Country For Old Men' The Coen Bros are the epitome of originally and dry comedy and know how to use their actors both well known and unknown. Then there is 'Burn After Reading'. The Coen Bros. do it again, great cast, very dry humor and pure originality. Still, with 'Burn After Reading' it's very hard to finish that movie satisfied, because you wonder if it made any sense at all.From what I was able to make out of it John Malcovich brilliantly portrays a recently fired government agent, who decides to write a book. His information, somehow ends up in the hands of two yokel gym instructors played brilliantly by Francis McDormand and Brad Pitt (In my opinion this is his greatest comedic role since True Romance) Now the movie has become a game to retrieve the disc of information while everyone is sleeping with everyone and everyone is looking over their shoulders thinking someone is watching them. Even in the end when this case is brought to light to the head of this mysterious organization which is pretty much in the background of the whole film he can't even figure out what the hell is going on.I had high hopes for this movie. I did feel the cast did a great job, which is why I gave this movie two stars. I have become a big fan of Tilda Swinton since I saw her in Narnia. I feel she has great potential to become a real legend in her field. She already won an Oscar along side George Clooney. George Clooney, I really didn't get in this movie. I mean he knows how to work his role, but in this film I really didn't understand what he was there for.

As the brothers Coen admit, it was written specifically for some of their favorite actors, so you have to appreciate it on the level of an exercise in great acting.Otherwise, there isn't much of a plot -- or a point.

Bush's relationship to the intelligence community. To be fair, one would have to pick over every minute of the film to get the full scope, but I'll note the big sweep here.McDormand's character has a single minded desire for unnecessary plastic surgery. This is a metaphor for Bush's unnecessary war in Iraq. It speaks to the possiblity that many of the events of that last six years were all for Bush's vanity. There are jokes aplenty regarding how she makes herself understood ( a glaring Bush failing) and many other small moments in the film that are indirect goofs on our President's personality.The ""only one she can count on"" is Brad Pitt's character. Pitt's is more complicated - his character has attributes of the US military and current American youth in general and will do whatever she wants no matter how nonsensical. He simply goes where he is ordered and dies in the line of duty, so to speak.The gym manager is another complicated metaphor for both the American public and the GOP - he, too, gets mauled for Bush/McDormand's insane demands.McDormand's character gets exactly what she wants by the film's end and walks away scott-free.Obviously, the Coens spent a lot of time discussing their views of recent events and the current zeitgeist with each other, and decided that ""gym culture"" was an accurate metaphor for how the nation has been run.They claim in the special features that the film is not political.It isn't - they don't offer any solutions and say so through JK Simmon's CIA officer "" I guess all we learned is not to do it again"". There is no other agenda than to portray as humorously as possible a series of sad events, events that correspond, however absurdly, to our own sad state of affairs.Malkovich's is the only character who simply is who he is: the old guard within CIA who does his job without prejudice or fear of retribution for being ""politcally unreliable"".And he is crucified for it, and says so.He screams at one point early on ""THIS IS POLITICAL!"", perhaps addressing the audience.The blackmail he endures at McDormand's insistance is a metaphor for all that the intelligence community has withstood at the Bush administration's hands.He responds to the insane events in the film repeatedly, before losing it himself:""What the ****?!""Weren't the thoughtful and informed among us thinking the same thing over the last six years or so?",5,"""Burn..."" as absurdist metaphor",1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2626,"['***SPOILER', 'ALERT', '***I', 'was', 'hoping', 'other', 'reviewer', 'someone', 'sharper', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'here', ""'ll"", 'have', 'mention', 'film', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'think', 'brilliant', 'allegory', 'goof', 'W.', 'Bush', 'relationship', 'intelligence', 'community', 'be', 'fair', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'pick', 'over', 'minute', 'film', 'get', 'full', 'scope', ""'ll"", 'note', 'big', 'sweep', 'here.McDormand', 'character', 'single', 'minded', 'desire', 'unnecessary', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'metaphor', 'Bush', 'unnecessary', 'war', 'Iraq', 'possiblity', 'many', 'events', 'last', 'six', 'years', 'were', 'Bush', 'vanity', 'are', 'jokes', 'aplenty', 'regarding', 'how', 'understood', 'glaring', 'Bush', 'failing', 'many', 'other', 'small', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'indirect', 'goofs', 'President', 'personality.The', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'count', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'Pitt', 'more', 'complicated', 'character', 'attributes', 'US', 'military', 'current', 'American', 'youth', 'general', 'will', 'do', 'matter', 'how', 'nonsensical', 'simply', 'where', 'ordered', 'dies', 'line', 'duty', 'so', 'speak.The', 'gym', 'manager', 'complicated', 'metaphor', 'American', 'public', 'GOP', 'too', 'mauled', 'Bush/McDormand', 'insane', 'demands.McDormand', 'character', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'end', 'walks', 'away', 'scott-free.Obviously', 'Coens', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'discussing', 'views', 'recent', 'events', 'current', 'zeitgeist', 'other', 'decided', 'gym', 'culture', 'was', 'accurate', 'metaphor', 'how', 'nation', 'been', 'run.They', 'claim', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'not', 'political.It', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'solutions', 'say', 'so', 'JK', 'Simmon', 'CIA', 'officer', 'guess', 'learned', 'not', 'do', 'again', 'other', 'agenda', 'portray', 'as', 'humorously', 'possible', 'series', 'sad', 'events', 'events', 'correspond', 'however', 'absurdly', 'own', 'sad', 'state', 'affairs.Malkovich', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'simply', 'who', 'old', 'guard', 'CIA', 'who', 'job', 'prejudice', 'fear', 'retribution', 'being', 'politcally', 'unreliable', '.And', 'crucified', 'so.He', 'screams', 'one', 'point', 'early', 'THIS', 'POLITICAL', 'perhaps', 'addressing', 'audience.The', 'blackmail', 'McDormand', 'insistance', 'metaphor', 'intelligence', 'community', 'withstood', 'Bush', 'administration', 'hands.He', 'responds', 'insane', 'events', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'losing', 'What', '****', 'Were', ""n't"", 'thoughtful', 'informed', 'thinking', 'same', 'thing', 'last', 'six', 'years', 'so']",N/A

When you find yourself thinking: What is it all about? Where is this going? 50 minutes into the movie, it is a sign that it is not that good. My husband gave up after that, but I (a patient viewer as I am), kept watching till the end, hoping that something good would happen. No luck there. There was no cohesive plot, no moral, no point.People who give this movie 4 and 5 stars must be either star-struck or huge fans of Coen brothers.I am sure glad that I didn't go to the movie theater to watch this film and didn't buy it either.
