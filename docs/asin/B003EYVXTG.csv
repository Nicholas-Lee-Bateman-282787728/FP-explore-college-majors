She appears to have let his sensibility have a large role in Winter's Bone, and I think in this instance it was a good decision.For me, the strongest element was Granik's choice to stay intensely and consistently focused on the main character and her milieu. The viewer is never distracted by extraneous elements or stylistic sops thrown in to appease Hollywood conventionality. I was riveted throughout the film, even as the outcome of the main unseen character became evident, the denouement.Credit goes to the filmmakers for studiously avoiding the showing of the beating of one of the characters - we do see the aftermath, and that is brutal enough. Also the scene involving a murder victim and the prolonged attention to the corpse is shot indirectly, and is all the more horrific as a result. As the ancient Greeks knew, violence is best implied off stage, and all the more effective as a result. Granik's camera had better ways to address violence.In addition, the dysfunctional male hill culture is portrayed without condescension, as is the omnipresence of way too many guns. We're left to draw our conclusions about the impoverished, backward way of life and its struggling denizens amidst one of the most lethal drug epidemics to have ravaged the poor, white working class.",5,a finely focused artistry,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1453,"['Ms.', 'Granik', 'film', 'director', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'select', 'one', 'America', 'better', 'writers', 'dark', 'side', 'rural', 'life', 'Daniel', 'Woodrell', 'source', 'film', 'have', 'let', 'sensibility', 'have', 'large', 'role', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'think', 'instance', 'was', 'good', 'decision.For', 'strongest', 'element', 'was', 'Granik', 'choice', 'stay', 'intensely', 'consistently', 'focused', 'main', 'character', 'milieu', 'viewer', 'never', 'distracted', 'extraneous', 'elements', 'stylistic', 'sops', 'thrown', 'appease', 'Hollywood', 'conventionality', 'was', 'riveted', 'film', 'even', 'outcome', 'main', 'unseen', 'character', 'became', 'evident', 'denouement.Credit', 'filmmakers', 'studiously', 'avoiding', 'showing', 'beating', 'one', 'characters', 'do', 'see', 'aftermath', 'brutal', 'enough', 'Also', 'scene', 'involving', 'murder', 'victim', 'prolonged', 'attention', 'corpse', 'shot', 'indirectly', 'more', 'horrific', 'result', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'knew', 'violence', 'best', 'implied', 'off', 'stage', 'more', 'effective', 'result', 'Granik', 'camera', 'had', 'better', 'ways', 'address', 'violence.In', 'addition', 'dysfunctional', 'male', 'hill', 'culture', 'portrayed', 'condescension', 'omnipresence', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'guns', ""'re"", 'left', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'impoverished', 'backward', 'way', 'life', 'struggling', 'denizens', 'amidst', 'one', 'most', 'lethal', 'drug', 'epidemics', 'have', 'ravaged', 'poor', 'white', 'working', 'class']",N/A

1339491,A1TUZL12O7X1A9,B003EYVXTG,Alexander G.,"[0, 0]","This movie gives us a look at the lives of meth sellers and poor folks in the Ozarks. We see the overarching influence of poverty in peoples' lives, both meth dealers who even in spite of their prominence locally, still live in decrepit, relatively poor surroundings.The central figure in the movie, a tough 17-year-old named Ree (Jennifer Lawrence in a star-making performance) is responsible for her catatonic mother, 12-year-old brother Sonny (Isaiah Stone) and six-year-old sister Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson) since her father is away from the house most of the time, usually owing to meth. However he has recently missed a court date and if he does not show up, he will lose his house. Therefore it is incumbent on Ree to find him or the family will be put out of their house. In trying to track him down, Ree has to deal with some unpleasant characters, most especially local meth kingpin Thump (Ron Hall) and Merab (Dale Dickey), a woman with connections to Thump. She also has to deal with her father's brother Teardrop (a fantastic John Hawkes) who keeps things close to his chest and may fall into the violence and drug habits which plague some in the area.The performance from Lawrence is fantastic. She conveys a very determined woman who is not cowed by some terrifying and legally ominous circumstances and who cares about her family enough not to shrink from the responsibility of taking care of her depressed mother and the younger siblings who rely on her. Lawrence will be a big star although I would bet most of the roles offered to her will not cast a shadow on this role. This is a meaty, juicy role and she sucks all the juice out of it, conveying thoughtfulness, toughness, and the ability to teach her siblings what they need to know in an unsympathetic world.The plot is quite well elucidated and we understand the role of all the characters we meet. The writing is spare and minimalist from a novel by Daniel Woodnell. The screenplay is co-written by director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini who convey a bleak, hostile environment in the Ozarks of Missouri. The acting was almost totally done by locals from the area where the movie was filmed.

1339498,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003EYVXTG,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","`Winter's Bone' has me straddling the fence with my own opinion, because I find myself completely torn as to how I really feel about it.  It is, in most respects, a very good film.  But (and there is that pesky `but') there are elements of this film, key elements at that, that seem off-kilter.  Often referred to as that little Indie that could, `Winter's Bone' has achieved a lot of praise and accolades this Awards season; in fact, it's sitting pretty for some key Oscar nominations, including Actress, Screenplay and Picture.  For me though, this film kind of boils down to one person; Debra Granik.  With a script that can become repetitive and obtuse, to acting that runs the gamut from unapologetically stereotypical to downright sincere and believable (so, in other words, uneven), it all comes together thanks to Granik's marvelous direction.  She understands the chills needed in the atmosphere to get under the audiences skin and create something unforgettable out of a story that is, to put it bluntly, rather forgettable.  `Winter's Bone' has a lot of fans, and I am kind of one of them.  As much as I rag on some of the films generalities, I did enjoy it and certainly would recommend it.  Jennifer Lawrence has some very good moments as the determined Ree, even if I found her handling of some lesser scenes to be awkward and unbelievable.  John Hawkes is the star of the show, for he really creates someone phenomenally centered and conflicted and haunted from start to finish.  It's the dark and spooky climate the makes the movie though, and Granik manipulates it with stellar results.  While it doesn't emotionally connect like it claims to (it is notably cold and distant, but I feel that was intentional and even commendable, to a degree) it does leave an impression thanks to Granik's attention to detail.",4,Chewing the fat...,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,1827,"['Winter', 'Bone', 'straddling', 'fence', 'own', 'opinion', 'find', 'completely', 'torn', 'how', 'really', 'feel', 'most', 'respects', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'pesky', 'are', 'elements', 'film', 'key', 'elements', 'seem', 'off-kilter', 'referred', 'little', 'Indie', 'could', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'achieved', 'lot', 'praise', 'Awards', 'season', 'fact', 'sitting', 'pretty', 'key', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'Actress', 'Screenplay', 'Picture', 'film', 'kind', 'boils', 'down', 'one', 'person', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'script', 'can', 'become', 'repetitive', 'obtuse', 'acting', 'gamut', 'unapologetically', 'stereotypical', 'downright', 'sincere', 'believable', 'so', 'other', 'words', 'uneven', 'together', 'thanks', 'Granik', 'marvelous', 'direction', 'chills', 'needed', 'atmosphere', 'get', 'audiences', 'skin', 'create', 'something', 'unforgettable', 'story', 'put', 'bluntly', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'lot', 'fans', 'am', 'kind', 'one', 'As', 'much', 'rag', 'films', 'generalities', 'did', 'enjoy', 'certainly', 'would', 'recommend', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'determined', 'Ree', 'even', 'found', 'handling', 'lesser', 'scenes', 'be', 'awkward', 'unbelievable', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'star', 'show', 'really', 'someone', 'phenomenally', 'centered', 'conflicted', 'haunted', 'start', 'finish', 'dark', 'spooky', 'climate', 'movie', 'Granik', 'stellar', 'results', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'connect', 'notably', 'cold', 'distant', 'feel', 'was', 'intentional', 'even', 'commendable', 'degree', 'leave', 'impression', 'thanks', 'Granik', 'attention', 'detail']",N/A

[I put the 'fiction' qualifier in there because my favorite film overall was Lucy Walker'sWaste Land, a documentary.]  'Bone' deserved its Oscar nominations and Spirit Award wins.  There's a grittiness and realness present in this film that's lacking from a lot of Hollywood product.  Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini's outstanding screenplay - adapted from Daniel Woodrell's superb novel of the same name - indelibly documents the extent of the impact that the methamphetamine epidemic has had on rural communities.  It does that not only in terms of rendering the primary circle of addiction in stark relief, but also by depicting the wider, secondary circles of mistrust, paranoia and broken families it engenders.Director/co-writer Granik has tabbed an outstanding set of actors to depict this flat, colorless, frightening world.  It's now well-documented that Jennifer Lawrence shocked the daylights out of everyone with her performance as Ree.  Anyone who says they saw that coming is fabricating.  Excellent screenplay and direction notwithstanding, Bone's make-or-break rests on Ms. Lawrence's shoulders.  To say she nailed it is an understatement.  She buried that nail so deep, she shot right to the very heart of the Hollywood A-List.  To this viewer, it's clear that Lawrence's performance was enhanced greatly by the great work of John Hawke.  His 'Teardrop' is the single best thing about this uniformly excellent production.  Ree and Teardrop on the screen together make for the film's standout scenes.That's only topped by whatever scenes Dale Dickey appears in.  She's the first line of defense in local kingpin Thump Milton's rings of protection.  In countenance, physique and cadence, Ms. Dickey is pitch-perfect in every way.  She's downright menacing.

Everyone Ree meets tries to help her in their own way and they are all touched by her plight, even though they don't want her to dig any deeper to find out where her father is.There is menace and violence in this society which clings to the edges of civilization, but there is also humanity (seen in the treatment of animals, apart from the squirrels who are killed for food, not sport). I'm glad the film ended the way it did because I was expecting some blood-splattered finale that just never eventuated.

1339509,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003EYVXTG,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[3, 8]","One of the most surprising indie films I've seen from 2010 is Winter's Bone (2010). It's a dark, gritty, character-driven drama about a 17-year old girl scrambling to take care of her sick mother and younger siblings in rural Missouri. Her father is missing, probably dead or in trouble, and she is thrown into taking care of her family with no money or resources to do so. The appreciation of this film is in the slow revealing of the suspenseful complex story, and the details of the lives of the characters within it. The film is written and photographed with a realism and texture that takes us right into the cold, barren, winter life of poor southerners trying to survive. I give the film 3.5 stars out of 5.Having watched this film once, and then a second time with the audio commentary on, I'm struck by the incredible attention to detail and care that went into constructing this film. It just goes to show that sometimes less is more when it comes to production budgets for movies. This film was made for approximately $2 million, which amazes me when I see what they got for it. Winter's Bone reminds me a lot of another recent Sundance Film Festival winner with a low production budget: Frozen River (2008). Both films are set during winter, and explore strong female characters at the centers of the ""tough"" stories. Both films are excellently written and carefully crafted by their female writers/directors. And both films are wonderfully photographed by their directors of photography. Winter's Bone was shot in digital on the Red Camera, an impressive display of the new technology that is changing the film industry.The incredible cast of Winter's Bone is what really brings this story to life. Every detail in their words, their clothing, their make-up, and in their faces is expressed with passion and commitment. While many of the characters stand out and shine on their own, sometimes in just a few minutes of screen time, what struck me the most was how as an ensemble they all brought the film to the same level of excellence. They all deliver Oscar-worthy performances for acting, but will probably be overshadowed precisely because of the sheer quantity of competition between themselves in this one film. Lead actress Jennifer Lawrence will probably be nominated for Best Actress, but beyond her performance, we will have to see.Do yourself a favor, and watch Winter's Bone. It's a testament to the great indie films that are still being made in our times of $100 million blockbusters that mostly lack soul, depth, and craft. I realize the material for this film isn't necessarily a ""fun"" escape, but cinema isn't only about laughing or crying. Sometimes a great movie just shows you the way something is.

1339511,AO4WFALWQYTW0,B003EYVXTG,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[32, 43]","Imagine if you relatives, close and distant, where to settle within the proximity to each other, did drugs to the point of excess, made and sold Methamphetamine, used firearms in treating any nagging conflict between each other, and still were relatively poor. Winter's Bone contains many characters that are conflicted by the above conditions, and as far as the film lacks any observable redeemable condition. They all are family, but in their midst it would be better to be a stranger, or best never to come in contact.Winter's Bone centers on Ree Dolly who in the absence of her father and the sickness of her mother, has to keep after her little sister and brother. Life is not easy as Ree's family lacks many of the basic necessities of life that her family and neighbors benefit from, such as food and hay for the horses. Her neighbor always pitches in to help her out with such basic needs, but isn't without her own intrusiveness about the affairs of the family. Despite the ardous conditions of life on the field, they live contently until an incident threatens to alter matters for the worst. It seems that their father who has been arrested multiple times for his illegal production and utilizing of Methamphetamine has put the house on bail and failed to appear for his hearing. If the family does not find him in time, they will lose their property. Ree sets out to find her father before they are thrown out of their house; a task she must be complete in less than a week.Finding her father should not be the issue as the people he associates himself are fellow family members, but these people are not willing to reveal anything as it may be used against them in a legal context. Their unwillingness infuriates Ree as these are not only the only sources she can trace toward her father, but also because many of these people are close relatives of her father, such as Teardrop who is his brother. The family members are so coldly removed from each other that Ree must remember them that they are family, and that this must count for some level of trust. The Dolly family are so emotionally distant that a distasteful or insulting act by one member could entice close relatives to physically harm him. Everyone of may have inherited the surname, but their safety lies in their actions. This families safety and freedom does not lie in the hand of the Police, considering the amount of illegal activities they commit, but in the hands of the more powerful members of the family. No one dares to cross paths with the ""Chief"" of the Dolly family, as his large army of minions has enough power to crush any member of the family that he wishes. The Dolly family is not unlike the Mafia where one person rules, the Don, and the inferior men are continuously trying to ascend in rank. Unlike the Mob , however, a  large majority of the Dolly family are forever condemned to remain inferior. The treatment of the woman is deplorable as it is implied that their only concerns should be within the kitchen and the bedroom.Jeniffer Lawrence's portrayal of Ree is central to the film's success as her presence makes the title character seem so empowered and determined to solve this mystery. She stares in the camera with such confidence that the idea that she has raised herself and her siblings seems convincing; her demeanor also suggests that her mother's sickness is nothing new but it has been an ongoing condition. Lawrence is especially brilliant in some  very masculine moments of the film, such as a scene involving skinning of squirrels and teaching her siblings in using a rifle. Much credit is also due to Director/screenwriter Debra Granik who shows Ree's inability to solve this case on her alone, and eventual surrender in the face of all the hardship that the Police and her family hurl in her direction. Granik has no intent to show Ree as a cowardly character, rather suggesting that without her family's help she is quite helpless and must concede defeat.This is a deftly created product where the insubstantial plot succeeds in seeming much more complex than it turns out to be. Winter's Bone owes its success to its approach which familiarizes the audience with few admirable characters who trying to accomplish this not so easy task among the numerous villainous family members who are willing to do anything to prevent Ree from finding her father. The film is so captivating in its unique mood and atmosphere that its virtually nonexistent plot is only recognized near the conclusion.

Ree Dolly, seventeen years old and living in the Ozarks of southern Missouri, must find her father who has jumped bond. Unless she finds him, she will lose her home and land which he put up for bond. He's a methamphetamine (crank) cooker turned snitch and Reese is determined to find him dead or alive so that she can keep her home. If she can prove he's dead, then that becomes a reasonable excuse for him not showing up for his bond hearing and she will not lose her home.Ree's mother is mentally ill and Ree has a younger brother and sister for whom she is responsible. The love she has for them shines throughout this film. The viewer is struck with the poverty of the Ozarks and the two-way sword of family.

After all, it's a Hollywood elitist's perfect vision of Southern hillbillies as inbreeding, meth-cooking, camo-wearing white trash.  There's a satellite dish in every junked-up, clothesline-strung yard, hinting that the menfolk gotta have their pro-wrestling matches and porn flicks, but won't buy their women dryers, if not washers.  There's not a blade of grass in sight, so no wonder the family's horse is going hungry since the hay ran out.  Everything is so bleak there's not even a Confederate flag to brighten the gloom.  It's hard to believe this is the United States, since there's seemingly no government welfare, homestead-protection laws, or rules regarding conduct of the courts or police.  The whole premise of the story is that the protagonist's pa has put up the family's home as a surety bond--without his spouse's co-signature--and thus has subjected the wife and kids to eviction within a week of an assumed bail skip.  Whatever hinterland twilight zone this is, even the family's timber-rich land isn't enough to cover bail for a meth crime, since some nameless person had to lay down a crumpled wad of cash to spring pa.  And, apparently, so many folks have cut off one of their hands to fool the law into thinking they're dead that only two cropped paws will convice the cops!The characters are depicted as backwoods primitives, and yet a twelve-year-old boy doesn't know how to aim and fire a gun, cut up deer meat, or skin and butcher a squirrel.  The seventeen-year-old heroine doesn't know how to properly hang garments on a line or fry potatoes in a skillet (but odds are neither does the director!).  The former even believes that, if she joins the Army, her underage sibs can come along.  Moreover, there's no indication that her actions are driven by pride or independence, no hint that she'd rather eat squirrel than deign to seek food stamps.  She's evidently just a desperate and dumb high-school dropout who's not on dope ""yet"" (to quote her).Most of the characters are mean, ill-bred, and inconstant.  Some have Southern accents, and some don't.  A few of the extras look noirishly odd, but this absurdist tale is not noir--as at least one critic has claimed.

This could have easily been filmed in southeastern Ohio or the hills outside of Cincinnati; I've spent time in both (circa 1970's), and have known my share of speed freaks.But, what I wasn't expecting was the way the film started haunting me, a good hour after I'd watched it. That, to me, is a hallmark of a great film. Not to mention how it stirred up some long-buried memories.Jennifer Lawrence deserves all the accolades that have been bestowed upon her for this role. And John Hawkes was outstanding! I've been a fan of his since ""The Perfect Storm"".But I must give a special shout-out to Dale Dickey. Her ""Merab"" was chilling and real!

Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[130, 145]","Adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, WINTER'S BONE immediately sparked comparisons to last year's Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker.  Both films received limited runtime in theaters.  But I must say this is by far the superior movie in just about every aspect imaginable, unless you count overwrought machoism, slanted anti-war sentiments, and explosions as a category.  Don't get me wrong, The Hurt Locker was a decent film for what it was.  But it won't leave the kind of lasting impression like this story will.When you hear the word ""backwoods"", you might get the immediate impression of inbred, buck-toothed hillbillies wearing overalls and drinking moonshine.  This story doesn't succumb to exploiting certain exaggerated stereotypes just to grab your attention.  But these characters are definitely a little rough around the edges, to say the least.Filmed in the Ozarks of Missouri, this is a simple but riveting dramatic tale about family, danger, and perseverance.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17-year-old girl forced to grow up way too fast.  With her mother desperately ailing and her father somewhere hiding from the law, she struggles to support her younger brother and sister.  To make matters worse, a bail bondsman notifies her that her dad put up their home as his bail bond, then skipped out on court.  In order to track her father down, Ree is forced to enter a seedy, violent realm of paranoid drug pushers and users.  Many of them happen to be distant family members.  Family ties or not, none of them are too anxious to help her out.  The risks and desperation mount as she inches closer to the truth.The best part of this film is the character development and the acting.  It is so refreshing to see the young cast perform their roles with such controlled precision.  Especially Lawrence.  She puts many established Hollywood actors to shame here, I can't wait to see more of her work.WINTER'S BONE is slow paced, and might not appeal to many casual movie goers.  But it does have some moments of heightened tension that will leave you holding your breath.  It explores a certain drug culture and meager lifestyle that is rarely touched upon in movies.  Plus it makes some poignant, thought-provoking points about family devotion and the human spirit.It also was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.

I have spent the last 26 years working in law enforcement and the emergency medical field in southwest Missouri, and the reality of meth(crank) is all to pervasive, but this is not a blighted wasteland. The rural areas are primarily agricultural, and the majority of meth people I have dealt with,(and there have been hundreds) are involved with meth because they became addicted from recreational use, or they don't want to work for a living. Don't get me wrong, the reality of meth on the family is devastating. Total loss of all the family has and complete breakdown of the family itself, but this is a choice made by people involved to use and manufacture meth, not that there is no way far a family to make an honest living in the Missouri ozarks.

1339535,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003EYVXTG,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 10]","""Winter's Bone,"" adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a stark, raw, and gritty masterpiece of storytelling, a thoroughly absorbing detective story that goes above and beyond the reliable conventions of mystery solving. It's a quiet, harsh, and unflinching societal drama set deep within the Ozarks, a world of cold forest lands, small houses that look slopped together from spare parts, cars perpetually hoisted on cinderblocks, and distrustful mountainfolk who all seem to be related to some degree. In these desolate backlands, we find seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who has taken her mother's place as a homemaker for her younger brother and sister. Her mother is still there, but only in body; her mind is somewhere off the beaten path, having strayed after an emotional trauma she could never come to terms with.Ree's father, Jessup, was arrested for cooking meth, which seems to be what most people do around these parts. Why? It certainly can't be for the money, considering the abject poverty in which some of them live. Whatever the case, Ree learns from the local sheriff that her father skipped bail and has gone missing. Worse yet, he put his own house up as a way to meet his bond, apparently having no other assets at his disposal. He now has one week to turn himself in. If he doesn't, Ree and her family will be thrown out of the house. Ree, with remarkable understated determination, vows that she will find him. Thus begins a door-to-door manhunt, Ree visiting the homes of Jessup's known associates. It's a journey that will prove more dangerous than it may first seem; these people are just as wary of their own kind as they are of outsiders, perhaps even more so. Family means nothing. It's all about survival.Ree definitely knows how to survive. She does the best she can with her siblings - feeding them, clothing them, educating them, showing them how to hunt and prepare food with what little she has to work with, including welfare and the occasional helping hand from neighbors. She keeps them as happy as she can, and indeed, they seem unaware of how disadvantaged they truly are. If they are aware of it, then they don't seem all that bothered by it, not as long as they have Ree to keep them in line. So selfless is this young woman that one can't help but wonder where she learned it from. Certainly not from her mother, who can do little more than stare vacantly into the distance, thinking whatever she thinks. I guess some of us are naturally inclined to be self sufficient. Maybe we need more people like her in our lives, if not for friendship, then just for the satisfaction of aspiring to be like her.As she journeys forward, she crosses paths with her uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes), a meth dealer who may or may not have something to do with Jessup's disappearance. He's intimidating and mysterious, distrustful and bitter, scarred and hopeless - simultaneously Ree's greatest obstacle and greatest ally in getting to the bottom of things. Hawkes, in the tradition of great actors like Al Pacino and Marlon Brando and even contemporary figures like Johnny Depp and Viggo Mortensen, completely disappears into his role, turning out a flawless balancing act between fearsome and forlorn. Teardrop is a hardened man who I seriously doubt has ever been happy, or at the very least, contented; the words themselves may be foreign concepts to him. Watching him as he progresses with Ree, I was torn between being frightened of him and feeling very sorry.Jennifer Lawrence, at just nineteen years old, gives one of the year's best performances, and I would be greatly disappointed if she weren't recognized with an Oscar nomination. The determination she brings to her character shows not the slightest trace of conventional Hollywood heroism; she doesn't make herself into a larger-than-life caricature of the strong willed young woman, someone who will sermonize endlessly and make a spectacle of herself. She's an ordinary person in an extraordinary situation. She does what she does not to prove a point, but merely because she has no other choice. Rarely do you see films with characters so convincing, so engaging, so in command of dialogue and emotion.The film's pacing is superb. The final thirty minutes alone build the kind of suspense that would rival even the best of Alfred Hitchcock's films, Ree's journey having taken a violent turn. It all builds up to a late night boat ride through a swamp, and while I won't reveal what happens, I will say that the scene is frightening in a way that most horror movies could only hope to be. That it's so terrifying is a testament to Anne Rosellini and Debra Granik (the director), who wrote the screenplay in such a way that we can actually feel something for the characters. Without that emotional connection, there would be little for the audience to react to; the film would be a sequence of events, and nothing more. ""Winter's Bone"" is a bleak, absorbing, resonant, tightly wound treasure of a film, one of the best I've seen this year.",5,A Girl Searches for Her Father,1283472000,"09 3,

1339538,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B003EYVXTG,Christopher Engel,"[1, 4]","In this film, you get to see (in case you haven't already) that poor people and ultra-rural communities with real-life problems still exist outside of the typical film world. They stop scenes constantly just to show you, from the local music to the local problems and the local populace itself.It's a lot like a stylized documentary. It's kind of like a voyeuristic journey into a place you may or may not know--or care, which is important--exists.But there is no story. There is nothing interesting happening most of the time besides showing us the land and the people, all of which are certainly unique to film, but have nothing to do with the story. In fact, you could steal this plot, put it in another context entirely, and I guarantee you with absolute certainty that critics would actually, for once, think there's another point besides the setting.This film is slow. Staggeringly slow. Pretentiously slow, perhaps to mirror the abundance of vapid nothingness that happens in these communities--and you know that's the point, because you'll notice no one talks about the story in their reviews. They talk about the setting, maybe the acting, or the fact that it's eye-opening (maybe it is for some people who get off on watching really, really poor people deal with typical problems). It's easy to forget that there's a story at all, somewhere in there.Typically, this is just a saying, but I actually did fall asleep during the film. That's not a good sign. And don't get me wrong, I can appreciate very good filmmaking when it's there. I like to look behind the meanings of classic films, and I typically enjoy them.But there is no meaning to be found here. It's a blueprint of a film that does its job getting the &#34;Look, everyone, this place exists! These people exist! Isn't that incredible!?&#34; but doesn't seem to care at all about &#34;So, how do we make this scene interesting for people who already know there's another world outside their own?&#34;Viewer ignorance is assumed from the very start. The film presumes you don't know anything, and that it doesn't matter what the actual story is, so long as it reflects the place and its inhabitants, which would be a lot more interesting if I wasn't presumed to be an idiot about that.This is not a good film when it comes to cohesive storytelling. It absolutely, undeniably falls apart in its pacing and total inability to tell a story. But, and this is key, it does something different from any film I've ever seen, and its plans from the start are to show you this new world of backwater poverty and its problems. It truly is a stylized documentary.It's a film meant to be analyzed until it bleeds, but not actually meant to be watched.It's voyeurism of a setting it assumes will awe and amaze you just by its very existence. But that's all it ever tries to do. And, since it never comes together, it deserves praise for what it *does* do rather extraordinarily, but also needs to be harshly criticized for where it fails in its literally sleep-inducing pacing, pretentious beliefs about the audience, and its near-nonexistent storytelling.I would recommend this only to people who love to feel smart and enlightened about something or another during film, who like to talk about the acting and the excellent portrayal of the setting, and feel content with just that. In truth, this is an animated textbook more than a story.A critic's wet dream in the departments in which critics focus, and a viewer's feeling of enlightenment *if* they had no idea from the beginning that this strange, bizarre type of place exists. But that's it. If what everyone's raving about doesn't hype you up, the film won't do anything to help you out in feeling otherwise.An outstanding documentary and a highly-competent look into the dirt-poor backwoods, but in no way a complete film.",1,"If you want to know what ""half a film"" means, here's where you go.",1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,3839,"['film', 'get', 'see', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'poor', 'people', 'ultra-rural', 'communities', 'real-life', 'problems', 'still', 'exist', 'typical', 'film', 'world', 'stop', 'scenes', 'constantly', 'just', 'show', 'local', 'music', 'local', 'problems', 'local', 'populace', 'itself.It', 'lot', 'stylized', 'documentary', 'kind', 'voyeuristic', 'journey', 'place', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'care', 'important', 'exists.But', 'story', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'happening', 'most', 'time', 'showing', 'land', 'people', 'are', 'certainly', 'unique', 'film', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'fact', 'could', 'steal', 'plot', 'put', 'context', 'entirely', 'guarantee', 'absolute', 'certainty', 'critics', 'would', 'actually', 'once', 'think', 'point', 'setting.This', 'film', 'slow', 'Staggeringly', 'slow', 'Pretentiously', 'slow', 'perhaps', 'mirror', 'abundance', 'vapid', 'nothingness', 'communities', 'know', 'point', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'one', 'story', 'reviews', 'talk', 'setting', 'maybe', 'acting', 'fact', 'eye-opening', 'maybe', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'off', 'watching', 'really', 'really', 'poor', 'people', 'deal', 'typical', 'problems', 'easy', 'forget', 'story', 'somewhere', 'there.Typically', 'just', 'saying', 'actually', 'did', 'fall', 'asleep', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'can', 'appreciate', 'very', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'when', 'there', 'like', 'look', 'meanings', 'classic', 'films', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'them.But', 'meaning', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'blueprint', 'film', 'job', 'getting', '34', 'Look', 'everyone', 'place', 'people', 'exist', ""n't"", 'incredible', '34', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', '34', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'make', 'scene', 'interesting', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'world', 'own', '34', 'Viewer', 'ignorance', 'assumed', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'presumes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'actual', 'story', 'so', 'long', 'place', 'inhabitants', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'presumed', 'be', 'idiot', 'that.This', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'when', 'cohesive', 'storytelling', 'absolutely', 'undeniably', 'apart', 'pacing', 'total', 'inability', 'tell', 'story', 'key', 'something', 'different', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'plans', 'start', 'are', 'show', 'new', 'world', 'backwater', 'poverty', 'problems', 'truly', 'stylized', 'documentary.It', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'analyzed', 'not', 'actually', 'meant', 'be', 'watched.It', 'voyeurism', 'setting', 'assumes', 'will', 'awe', 'amaze', 'just', 'very', 'existence', 'ever', 'do', 'never', 'together', 'praise', 'what', 'do', 'rather', 'extraordinarily', 'also', 'be', 'harshly', 'criticized', 'where', 'literally', 'sleep-inducing', 'pacing', 'pretentious', 'beliefs', 'audience', 'near-nonexistent', 'storytelling.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'feel', 'smart', 'enlightened', 'something', 'film', 'who', 'talk', 'acting', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'setting', 'feel', 'content', 'just', 'truth', 'animated', 'textbook', 'more', 'story.A', 'critic', 'wet', 'dream', 'departments', 'critics', 'focus', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'enlightenment', '*if*', 'had', 'idea', 'beginning', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'type', 'place', 'exists', 'what', 'everyone', 'raving', 'about', ""n't"", 'hype', 'up', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'help', 'out', 'feeling', 'otherwise.An', 'outstanding', 'documentary', 'highly-competent', 'look', 'dirt-poor', 'backwoods', 'way', 'complete', 'film']",N/A

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 6]","Winter's Bone, adapted by independent director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a small, low budget film with a courageous lead character.  This is one of those small films that features strong performances particularly by newcomer Jennifer Lawrence.In a rural part of the country, a teenage girl, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), raises her family which includes her younger brother and little sister.  While most girls her age are attending high school, she has to assume the role of sister and parent.  Life is grueling and tough for Ree who cares for her siblings even as her mother is depressed and dysfunctional and her father, who has had scrapes with the law, is missing from a bond hearing.  Unfortunately the family's house has been put up as collateral for his bail and is in danger to be taken by the bail bondsman.  Ree has to rely on the kindness and donations of food and supplies from neighbors, and when her home is about to be repossessed, her whole family is in danger of having their fragile world destroyed.  Threatened with her family's survival and determined not to lose her home, she sets out to find her father by questioning friends and family.  It seems that there is a little family blood everywhere, and people might know more than they let on.  Her uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes), is a menacing, uncooperative person.  She follows leads that are dead ends and wild goose chases.  She is at the end of her rope and desperate. What can she do?  Is her father dead or on the run?  Her search leads to some really bad people who are local crime lords, and her punishment at the hands of those she thought were friends is graphic and ruthless.  Her situation is nearly an impossible one for anyone much less a teenager.  Then help from an unlikely source begins to shed light on the fate of her father as her family's future hangs in the balance.Family is all important to Ree.  She is put in what seems to be a hopeless situation with no options.  Undeterred, she will not let her family be broken up.  She has to not only act and think like an adult, but to grow up fast and also teach her brother and sister about the basics of life including hunting and cooking.  She cherishes her siblings and despite her dad's criminal background and what it has done to the family, she clings to his clothing and belongings especially his guitar which also serves as a symbolic bond with her uncle.  You ask yourself just what would you do in this situation?  How would you survive?  You respond to her plight by watching how she reacts to her circumstances.The lack of a budget does not hinder the film due to its subject matter and focusing on the individual characters.  This is a very linear narrative with no parallel action.  Some of the dialogue which reflects the local dialects is at times hard to understand.  The unknown faces lend a very authentic feel as if these people really live this life.  The rural countryside is filmed as a very foreboding presence and is itself a powerful character. The film employs frequent handheld camerawork that lends an immediacy and documentary feel which work in the film's favor.  Even the film's colors are a darker hue which adds to the somber tone.Lawrence really impresses in one of her first starring roles on film.  The story rests on her shoulders, and she is more than up to the task.  John Hawkes is believable as her uncle, and what's fascinating is his character's development and his dramatic changes over the course of the story.It is a kind of downer of a film as the odds are stacked against Ree, and while Winter's Bone is not for everyone with its solemn, serious themes, for those willing to immerse themselves in an intimate, realistic tale of loyalty and survival and a young girl who bravely carries on, it is an inspiration.",4,A Girl's Indomitable Spirit in WINTER'S BONE,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,3840,"['Winter', 'Bone', 'adapted', 'independent', 'director', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'Anne', 'Rosellini', 'novel', 'Daniel', 'Woodrell', 'small', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'courageous', 'lead', 'character', 'one', 'small', 'films', 'strong', 'performances', 'particularly', 'newcomer', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence.In', 'rural', 'part', 'country', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Ree', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'family', 'younger', 'brother', 'little', 'sister', 'most', 'girls', 'age', 'are', 'attending', 'high', 'school', 'assume', 'role', 'sister', 'parent', 'Life', 'grueling', 'tough', 'Ree', 'who', 'siblings', 'even', 'mother', 'depressed', 'dysfunctional', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'scrapes', 'law', 'missing', 'bond', 'hearing', 'Unfortunately', 'family', 'house', 'been', 'put', 'up', 'collateral', 'bail', 'danger', 'be', 'taken', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'Ree', 'rely', 'kindness', 'donations', 'food', 'supplies', 'neighbors', 'when', 'home', 'be', 'repossessed', 'whole', 'family', 'danger', 'having', 'fragile', 'world', 'destroyed', 'Threatened', 'family', 'survival', 'determined', 'not', 'lose', 'home', 'out', 'find', 'father', 'questioning', 'friends', 'family', 'little', 'family', 'blood', 'everywhere', 'people', 'might', 'know', 'more', 'let', 'uncle', 'Teardrop', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'menacing', 'uncooperative', 'person', 'leads', 'are', 'dead', 'ends', 'wild', 'goose', 'chases', 'end', 'rope', 'desperate', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'father', 'dead', 'run', 'search', 'really', 'bad', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'local', 'crime', 'lords', 'punishment', 'hands', 'thought', 'were', 'friends', 'graphic', 'ruthless', 'situation', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'one', 'anyone', 'much', 'less', 'teenager', 'Then', 'help', 'unlikely', 'source', 'shed', 'light', 'fate', 'father', 'family', 'future', 'hangs', 'balance.Family', 'important', 'Ree', 'put', 'what', 'be', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'options', 'Undeterred', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'family', 'be', 'broken', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'act', 'think', 'adult', 'grow', 'up', 'fast', 'also', 'teach', 'brother', 'sister', 'basics', 'life', 'including', 'hunting', 'cooking', 'siblings', 'dad', 'criminal', 'background', 'what', 'done', 'family', 'clothing', 'belongings', 'especially', 'guitar', 'also', 'symbolic', 'bond', 'uncle', 'ask', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'How', 'would', 'survive', 'respond', 'plight', 'watching', 'how', 'circumstances.The', 'lack', 'budget', 'not', 'hinder', 'film', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'focusing', 'individual', 'characters', 'very', 'linear', 'narrative', 'parallel', 'action', 'dialogue', 'local', 'dialects', 'times', 'hard', 'understand', 'unknown', 'lend', 'very', 'authentic', 'feel', 'people', 'really', 'live', 'life', 'rural', 'countryside', 'filmed', 'very', 'foreboding', 'presence', 'powerful', 'character', 'film', 'frequent', 'handheld', 'camerawork', 'immediacy', 'documentary', 'feel', 'work', 'film', 'favor', 'Even', 'film', 'colors', 'are', 'darker', 'hue', 'somber', 'tone.Lawrence', 'really', 'one', 'first', 'starring', 'roles', 'film', 'story', 'shoulders', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'believable', 'uncle', 'what', 'fascinating', 'character', 'development', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'course', 'story.It', 'kind', 'downer', 'film', 'odds', 'are', 'stacked', 'Ree', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'not', 'everyone', 'solemn', 'serious', 'themes', 'willing', 'immerse', 'intimate', 'realistic', 'tale', 'loyalty', 'survival', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'bravely', 'inspiration']",N/A

This time Odysseus is a seventeen-year-old girl, Ree Dolly, who is touchingly portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. Ree lives in the Missouri Ozarks, in a hard pocket of rural poverty.Several of the people in her life, including close relatives, hold the law in contempt, deal drugs, and are quick to violence. I contend that her foes, which include ignorance, brutality, and a twisted code of silence, are as monstrous as any confronted by the ancient Greek hero.Her father is missing. So Ree must try to raise two much younger siblings by herself. She must also care for her mother, who is mentally incompetent. (Ree is the one who believes she ""must"" do these things.) Her father, before he vanished, put the family house and surrounding land up for bond so he could stay out of jail on drug charges. Apparently, the father's main problem was crank, the drug of choice for many in Ree's world.If she loses the property, as she will if the father skips bail, Ree has nothing. She is determined to find her father, so she starts asking questions. She is asking people who despise snitches and have the self-control of a very hungry lion. Miraculous, it seems to me, is how this film captures the glimmer of respect in the eyes of these lowlifes when they recognize Ree's courage.Simply put, the film is brilliant. The cinematography is splendid, capturing the spirit of a wintry world of rusting abandoned cars in the yard and burnt-out shacks. The shacks burned down when meth labs exploded.

Boy was I disappointed, this movie was way over rated and I almost fell asleep. The only scene that made me go ""wow!""was the scene where she has to help hold her fathers arm while they cut it. I had a hard time understanding what they were saying so I had to use subtitles. The acting could have been a lot better, I wasn't blown away by the acting. The storyline was good but just never got there, unlike the book which was amazing, it misses a lot what the book had. And ever time she would go meet someone to ask about her father I felt that I was re watching the first meeting. It just didn't live up to the book and the emotion it had. The movie was boring and the acting was predictable. Jennifer tried to make it emotional  by screaming and yelling cuss words. Most of the movie it looked as if she had not interest, like if she didn't care. I don't think this movie lived up to the hype at all.PlotWith an absent father and a withdrawn and depressed mother, 17 year-old Ree Dolly keeps her family together in a dirt poor rural area. She's taken aback however when the local Sheriff tells her that her father put up their house as collateral for his bail and unless he shows up for his trial in a week's time, they will lose it all. She knows her father is involved in the local drug trade and manufactures crystal meth, but everywhere she goes the message is the same: stay out of it and stop poking your nose in other people's business. She refuses to listen, even after her father's brother, Teardrop, tells her he's probably been killed. She pushes on, putting her own life in danger, for the sake of her family until the truth, or enough of it, is revealed.Living in the Ozark back country, seventeen year old Ree Dolly acts as the primary caregiver to her mentally ill mother, and her two younger siblings, twelve year old Sonny and six year old Ashlee. Her father, Jessup Dolly, is generally absent from their lives, he who earns a living primarily by running a methamphetamine lab. Without money from Jessup, Ree is barely able to make ends meet, and depends on the kindness of their neighbor, Sonya, to do so. Ree learns that her father is scheduled for a court appearance for his illegal activities, and he has skipped bail, putting their house and property up as bond. No one seems to know where Jessup is. Ree has to try and find Jessup to make sure that he shows up for his court appearance, otherwise they risk losing their home. As Ree goes on her quest, she finds that people seem to know more about his whereabouts than they are letting on, including her uncle Teardrop of who she is scared. Rumors abound that Jessup is dead, but a dead father without a body does not help her cause. But Ree's persistence in finding out what happened to Jessup makes her come face to face with the code of silence for which some are willing to kill.",2,Don't Understand The Hype,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,3068,"['So', ""'m"", 'really', 'happy', 'rented', 'movie', 'instead', 'buying', ""'m"", 'hunger', 'games', 'fan', 'so', 'when', 'would', 'watch', 'interviews', 'would', 'mention', 'movie', 'lot', 'decided', 'why', 'not', 'such', 'amazing', 'reviews', 'Boy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'rated', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'only', 'scene', 'made', 'go', 'wow', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'help', 'hold', 'fathers', 'arm', 'cut', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'so', 'had', 'use', 'subtitles', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'was', ""n't"", 'blown', 'away', 'acting', 'storyline', 'was', 'good', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'there', 'book', 'was', 'amazing', 'lot', 'what', 'book', 'had', 'ever', 'time', 'would', 'go', 'meet', 'someone', 'ask', 'father', 'felt', 'was', 're', 'watching', 'first', 'meeting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'book', 'emotion', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'acting', 'was', 'predictable', 'Jennifer', 'tried', 'make', 'emotional', 'screaming', 'yelling', 'cuss', 'words', 'Most', 'movie', 'looked', 'had', 'not', 'interest', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'absent', 'father', 'withdrawn', 'depressed', 'mother', '17', 'year-old', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'family', 'together', 'dirt', 'poor', 'rural', 'area', 'taken', 'aback', 'however', 'when', 'local', 'Sheriff', 'father', 'put', 'up', 'house', 'collateral', 'bail', 'up', 'trial', 'week', 'time', 'will', 'lose', 'father', 'involved', 'local', 'drug', 'trade', 'manufactures', 'crystal', 'meth', 'everywhere', 'message', 'same', 'stay', 'stop', 'poking', 'nose', 'other', 'people', 'business', 'listen', 'even', 'father', 'brother', 'Teardrop', 'probably', 'been', 'killed', 'putting', 'own', 'life', 'danger', 'sake', 'family', 'truth', 'enough', 'revealed.Living', 'Ozark', 'back', 'country', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'primary', 'caregiver', 'mentally', 'ill', 'mother', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'Sonny', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'Ashlee', 'father', 'Jessup', 'Dolly', 'generally', 'absent', 'lives', 'who', 'living', 'primarily', 'running', 'methamphetamine', 'lab', 'money', 'Jessup', 'Ree', 'barely', 'able', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'kindness', 'neighbor', 'Sonya', 'do', 'so', 'Ree', 'father', 'scheduled', 'court', 'appearance', 'illegal', 'activities', 'skipped', 'bail', 'putting', 'house', 'property', 'up', 'bond', 'one', 'know', 'where', 'Jessup', 'Ree', 'try', 'find', 'Jessup', 'make', 'sure', 'up', 'court', 'appearance', 'otherwise', 'risk', 'losing', 'home', 'Ree', 'quest', 'people', 'seem', 'know', 'more', 'whereabouts', 'are', 'letting', 'including', 'uncle', 'Teardrop', 'who', 'scared', 'Rumors', 'abound', 'Jessup', 'dead', 'dead', 'father', 'body', 'not', 'help', 'cause', 'Ree', 'persistence', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Jessup', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'code', 'silence', 'are', 'willing', 'kill']",N/A
1339548,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003EYVXTG,DanD,"[4, 8]","Debra Granik's WINTER'S BONE is one of the better films of 2010.  It's an intimate portrait of rural Missouri, revolving around seventeen-year-old Ree, whose meth-manufacturing father has left her to care for two younger siblings and a sick mother.  Ree's father Jessup has gone missing, but he put his property up for bond.  Meaning, if Ree doesn't find her father within a week--either that, or proof that he is dead--she looses the house and the land.  Unfortunately, her father's extended family seems inclined to let sleeping dogs lie, to the extent that Ree finds herself in genuine danger.  Her only accomplice, if you can call him that, is her uncle Teardrop, who may be as dangerous as everyone else around her.As Ree, Jennifer Lawrence carries this film on her more-than-capable shoulders; she is the rock of the film, anchoring it down so tightly that even the other stellar performances--especially John Hawkes as Teardrop--pale by comparison.  A lot of the cast aren't even professional actors, which lends the film an extra air of authenticity (that, and the fact that it was shot on location).  WINTER'S BONE is, without a doubt, a small production; and while that can sometimes ruin a movie, here it helps.  The script is good though not wholly memorable; the real grit here lies in the actors' performances, without which this film would've been a mediocre idea and best forgotten.  As is, it's nominated for 4 Academy Awards, and goes down as one of the best films of 2010 (a year in which quite a few good movies were made).",5,"A haunting, intimate film.",1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,1543,"['Debra', 'Granik', 'WINTER', 'BONE', 'one', 'better', 'films', '2010', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'rural', 'Missouri', 'revolving', 'seventeen-year-old', 'Ree', 'meth-manufacturing', 'father', 'left', 'care', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'sick', 'mother', 'Ree', 'father', 'Jessup', 'gone', 'missing', 'put', 'property', 'up', 'bond', 'Meaning', 'Ree', ""n't"", 'find', 'father', 'week', 'proof', 'dead', 'house', 'land', 'Unfortunately', 'father', 'extended', 'family', 'inclined', 'let', 'sleeping', 'dogs', 'lie', 'extent', 'Ree', 'genuine', 'danger', 'only', 'accomplice', 'can', 'call', 'uncle', 'Teardrop', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'dangerous', 'everyone', 'else', 'her.As', 'Ree', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'film', 'more-than-capable', 'shoulders', 'rock', 'film', 'anchoring', 'down', 'so', 'tightly', 'even', 'other', 'stellar', 'performances', 'especially', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Teardrop', 'pale', 'comparison', 'lot', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'professional', 'actors', 'film', 'extra', 'air', 'authenticity', 'fact', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'WINTER', 'BONE', 'doubt', 'small', 'production', 'can', 'sometimes', 'ruin', 'movie', 'here', 'script', 'good', 'not', 'wholly', 'memorable', 'real', 'grit', 'here', 'actors', 'performances', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'mediocre', 'idea', 'best', 'forgotten', 'As', 'nominated', '4', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'down', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010', 'year', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'movies', 'were', 'made']",N/A

Winter's Bone--starring Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes--is supremely acted, sublimely scripted and a deservedly-so Oscar contender; a true slice of American life. But, just how big is that slice of Americana?Frankly, I can't decide which genre is beginning to bore me more:  rednecks or ghetto blacks. Both claim to be representative of the ""real America.""  For the life of me, I have to go many miles and far out of my way to run into either. But, I'm sure that somewhere in these great, golden plains of ours there are older sisters saddled with the responsibility of raising their younger siblings in rundown trailers on land cluttered with abandoned cars and pick-up trucks and--to be sure--there are older siblings who (in time-honored survival training) teach their younger counterparts how to shoot a double barrel shot gun and skin a squirrel for supper. But, Holy American Flag, if such dramatic depictions were really the broad stroke of Ameican life, we'd have more congressional (population-based) representation in states like Montana, Wyoming, South and North Dakota, etc. No.  Most Americans live in throbbing (for good or bad) urban centers.So, while I enjoyed Winter's Bone and highly recommend it as an artistic achievement and a film to be consumed and appreciated, I wish our film makers would cut back on exporting American myths and legends in their art and portray in their films what is the ""real America"" to most Americans: middle-class, day-to-day survival in a city or suburb not far away from a natural park or rednecks or ghetto blacks.

Everyone keeps talking about how bleek and dark the film is, but that's really only because of the setting, back drop, and weather throughout.  The story itself is actually quite sappy, corny, and laughable.  To start with, we have a violent, drug addicted uncle who for the first half of the movie is abusive towards our main actress, he's violent towards her, attempts to get her to snort some meth, and even appears as if he just might molest his 17-year-old niece....but then.....presto...by the end of the film he's bring little baby chicks to the other children and he's sweet as pie.  Awww, he's even called ""tear drop"", because deep down he's a good guy.Then, we have our bail bondsman.  An evil, slimey critter during the first half of the film who then (out of the goodness of his bail bondsman heart) gives our actress a sack -o- cash at the end, which will allow her to dip that squirrel meat in caviar for the rest of her life!!  We additionally have a group of sea hag women who beat, slap, and kick our main actress...drag her into a barn where other violent meth dealers are hanging out.  They, out of the goodness of their meth dealer hearts...let the girl go despite the fact she can implicate them all in a murder if she keeps snooping around.  Then, later, the sea hags return and are sweet as pie and could not be more helpful really.The only charactor who didn't pull a 180 and become a good decent person, was...of course...the cop.  What a shocker, an evil sheriff who has no decency in him whatsoever.  So, the meth dealers are really good folk but the cops are bad. It's no surprise the Academy loves this tripe, cough Crash cough. It's essentially a Disney tale of a girl looking for her father, and a town who initially resists her every effort...but then...they go soft and provide her all the help she needs to become rich and we all ride off into the sunset holding hands smiling.

Her name is Marideth Sisco, a homely, white-haired, rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot, which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country, but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere, there are good and bad people in the country, just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie; not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie, you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair, even at 17.  And some dirt; she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness, cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a ""must see"" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times, as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example, ""Teardrop"", the brother-in-law of the main character, sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.

At first, the movie, co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, appears to concern itself with the spartan existence of a dirt-poor family in the Missouri Ozarks, but it turns into a far more personal story of one girl's intractable dedication to her family and how she faces life-threatening challenges in keeping her family home together. This is much more a tale of survival than spiritual uplift because 17-year-old Ree Dolly has to care for her two younger siblings while contending with a near-catatonic mother and a meth-making father who has apparently disappeared.Even though she harbors dreams of entering the military to secure the $40,000 promised in the recruiting ads, Ree has to deal with the harsh reality that her father has put up their house as collateral for his bail. If he doesn't show up for a trial in a week's time, dead or alive, they will lose everything. She is determined to find his whereabouts from his criminal relatives and associates despite the fact that she gets the same constant warning to mind her own business or face the consequences. In fact, her stubbornness is at such odds with tribal ties and local customs that she faces revelations she could not possibly be prepared to handle. While Ree remains undaunted in her search for the truth, she also discovers how she cannot break entirely free of her surroundings.Just as she did with an unknown Vera Farmiga as a coke-addicted mother in 2004'sDown to the Bone, Granik extracts a sharply realistic, emotionally precise performance out of Lawrence. For example, when she listens to the soldier tell her to stay home to care for her family, she registers her character's resignation in a most economically searing manner. In smaller roles, John Hawkes etches a menacing presence as Teardrop, Ree's meth addict uncle who brutally warns her that her father may be dead, as does Dale Dickey as a plain-spoken woman who turns out to have more in common with Lady Macbeth. Michael McDonough's stark cinematography captures the bleakness of the rough, depressing terrain. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray includes a robust commentary track from Granik and McDonough, an informative 45-minute making-of feature, an alternate opening scene, and four deleted scenes.",4,"Lawrence Soars in a Haunting, Mirthless Regional Morality Tale",1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2570,"['Having', 'made', 'strong', 'impression', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'younger', 'guilt-ridden', 'self', 'Guillermo', ""Arriaga'sThe"", 'Burning', 'Plain', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'brings', 'such', 'primal', 'haunting', 'stillness', 'performance', 'singlehandedly', 'dispirited', 'tone', 'director/co-writer', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'small-scale', 'regional', '2010', 'film', 'first', 'movie', 'co-written', 'Granik', 'Anne', 'Rosellini', 'concern', 'spartan', 'existence', 'dirt-poor', 'family', 'Missouri', 'Ozarks', 'far', 'more', 'personal', 'story', 'one', 'girl', 'intractable', 'dedication', 'family', 'how', 'life-threatening', 'challenges', 'keeping', 'family', 'home', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'tale', 'survival', 'spiritual', 'uplift', '17-year-old', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'care', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'contending', 'near-catatonic', 'mother', 'meth-making', 'father', 'who', 'apparently', 'disappeared.Even', 'dreams', 'entering', 'military', 'secure', '40,000', 'promised', 'recruiting', 'ads', 'Ree', 'deal', 'harsh', 'reality', 'father', 'put', 'up', 'house', 'collateral', 'bail', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'trial', 'week', 'time', 'dead', 'alive', 'will', 'lose', 'everything', 'determined', 'find', 'whereabouts', 'criminal', 'relatives', 'associates', 'fact', 'same', 'constant', 'warning', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'face', 'consequences', 'fact', 'stubbornness', 'such', 'odds', 'tribal', 'ties', 'local', 'customs', 'revelations', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'prepared', 'handle', 'Ree', 'undaunted', 'search', 'truth', 'also', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'break', 'entirely', 'free', 'surroundings.Just', 'did', 'unknown', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'coke-addicted', 'mother', ""2004'sDown"", 'Bone', 'Granik', 'sharply', 'realistic', 'emotionally', 'precise', 'performance', 'Lawrence', 'example', 'when', 'soldier', 'tell', 'stay', 'home', 'care', 'family', 'character', 'resignation', 'most', 'economically', 'searing', 'manner', 'smaller', 'roles', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Teardrop', 'Ree', 'meth', 'addict', 'uncle', 'who', 'brutally', 'father', 'may', 'be', 'dead', 'Dale', 'Dickey', 'plain-spoken', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'Michael', 'McDonough', 'stark', 'cinematography', 'bleakness', 'rough', 'depressing', 'terrain', '2011', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'robust', 'commentary', 'track', 'Granik', 'McDonough', 'informative', '45-minute', 'making-of', 'feature', 'alternate', 'opening', 'scene', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

If he doesn't show, sis, her younger brother and sister and vegetablized mom are out on the street (or in the woods as it applies here). So she sets out to find his old haunts, friends and family (very little difference there) so she can track him down.This is a powerful film. And it's lean. No fancy sets or special effects. It's all writing and acting. Jennifer Lawrence plays the lead. She's a nice girl, but she's street smart, tough and nobody's fool. She confronts all manner of people unflinchingly to get the answers she needs. John Hawkes is one of her dad's cousins who knows the kind of trouble she's getting into but helps anyway. Garrett Dillahunt plays the local cop who really screws things up. These are just a few of a really fine cast that infuse nearly every scene with a sense of menace.They bring the ""everyone's related, trailer trash"" thing to the fore and do not even attempt to make it politically correct. These are dirty, nasty, drug making, drug selling, drug using, mean spirited people who are no strangers to death and killing. Most of the people she talks to are related to her to some degree or another but would kill her if they had to.Most of it takes place outdoors, during the winter, or in these nasty shacks. That alone puts the viewer on edge. Add to that all the other assorted foulness and this becomes a very scary movie.I love these kinds of movies because they remind me of how much can be done in film with so very little. The right script, actors and director and you have a gem like this. Try putting this on next Halloween instead of your favorite horror movie and see how well you sleep that night.",4,I'll Stay out of Missouri Thank You,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1917,"['one', 'scariest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""n't"", 'even', 'horror', 'movie', 'set', 'Missouri', 'Ozarks', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'who', 'track', 'down', 'dad', 'due', 'court', 'drug', 'charges', 'used', 'house', 'collateral', 'bond', ""n't"", 'show', 'sis', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'vegetablized', 'mom', 'are', 'street', 'woods', 'here', 'out', 'find', 'old', 'haunts', 'friends', 'family', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'there', 'can', 'track', 'down.This', 'powerful', 'film', 'lean', 'fancy', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'writing', 'acting', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'lead', 'nice', 'girl', 'street', 'smart', 'tough', 'nobody', 'fool', 'manner', 'people', 'unflinchingly', 'get', 'answers', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'one', 'dad', 'cousins', 'who', 'kind', 'trouble', 'getting', 'anyway', 'Garrett', 'Dillahunt', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'really', 'things', 'up', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'really', 'fine', 'cast', 'infuse', 'nearly', 'scene', 'sense', 'menace.They', 'bring', 'everyone', 'related', 'trailer', 'trash', 'thing', 'fore', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'make', 'politically', 'correct', 'are', 'dirty', 'nasty', 'drug', 'making', 'drug', 'selling', 'drug', 'using', 'mean', 'spirited', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'strangers', 'death', 'killing', 'Most', 'people', 'talks', 'are', 'related', 'degree', 'would', 'kill', 'had', 'to.Most', 'place', 'outdoors', 'winter', 'nasty', 'shacks', 'alone', 'viewer', 'edge', 'Add', 'other', 'assorted', 'foulness', 'very', 'scary', 'movie.I', 'kinds', 'movies', 'remind', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'right', 'script', 'actors', 'director', 'have', 'gem', 'Try', 'putting', 'next', 'Halloween', 'instead', 'favorite', 'horror', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'sleep', 'night']",N/A
1339577,A1CHM200OEN65X,B003EYVXTG,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[2, 5]","I have a soft spot for female heroines who fight bravely and sacrificially despite overwhelming odds. ""Winter's Bone"" follows such a character, 17-year old Ree, played with understated power by Jennifer Lawrence--a deserved Best Actress nominee at this year's Oscars.Ree lives in the Ozarks of Missouri, where she is raising her younger brother and sister, while their mother sits lifeless and emotionally paralyzed in a chair. Ree is resourceful. She teaches the kids to hunt, to skin a squirrel, and to look out for family. They are miserably poor, scraping by day to day, but things get worse when Ree gets a visit from the local police. The officer explains that Ree's father has put up their property to post bail, after his arrest for cooking meth, and if he doesn't appear at his court date Ree's home and land will be taken away. Refusing to show fear, Ree insists she will find her father and she sets out to do just that. Soon, though, she realizes her relatives scattered throughout the mountains are reluctant to let her stick her nose into their business. The tension mounts as we realize she is putting herself in greater danger by poking around. But what else can she do? If she doesn't do so, she and her siblings will be without a home or livelihood.Jennifer Lawrence plays the role to perfection, exhibiting a gritty survival instinct and backbone, yet revealing understandable fear and reservation. It's a fine line, and she walks it well. The relatives are scary people, and the script gives them believable dialogue for the setting and social status they inhabit. Ree's character finds financial and emotional support from an unexpected source, an uncle known as Teardrop--played by John Hawkes, and also deservedly receiving an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor.The movie simmers with tension and violence, but shows very little of it until the latter third, during which Ree gets her answers--leading to a bittersweet redemption. It's a movie as cold and tough as its title, and it stayed with me for days. Reminiscent of other small, indie films such as ""Frozen River,"" this movie deserves the recognition it is receiving. While I don't know if it qualifies as a Best Picture, it certainly stands tall on a strong script, great acting, and reminders that poverty and drugs are a scourge not only in inner cities but in reclusive settings as well.",4,Cold and Tough,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,2372,"['have', 'soft', 'spot', 'female', 'heroines', 'who', 'fight', 'bravely', 'sacrificially', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'character', '17-year', 'old', 'Ree', 'played', 'understated', 'power', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nominee', 'year', 'Oscars.Ree', 'Ozarks', 'Missouri', 'where', 'raising', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'mother', 'lifeless', 'emotionally', 'paralyzed', 'chair', 'Ree', 'resourceful', 'kids', 'hunt', 'skin', 'squirrel', 'look', 'out', 'family', 'are', 'miserably', 'poor', 'scraping', 'day', 'day', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'Ree', 'visit', 'local', 'police', 'officer', 'Ree', 'father', 'put', 'up', 'property', 'post', 'bail', 'arrest', 'cooking', 'meth', ""n't"", 'appear', 'court', 'date', 'Ree', 'home', 'land', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Refusing', 'show', 'fear', 'Ree', 'will', 'find', 'father', 'out', 'do', 'just', 'Soon', 'though', 'relatives', 'scattered', 'mountains', 'are', 'reluctant', 'let', 'stick', 'nose', 'business', 'tension', 'mounts', 'realize', 'putting', 'greater', 'danger', 'poking', 'around', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'siblings', 'will', 'be', 'home', 'livelihood.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'role', 'perfection', 'exhibiting', 'gritty', 'survival', 'instinct', 'backbone', 'yet', 'revealing', 'understandable', 'fear', 'reservation', 'fine', 'line', 'walks', 'well', 'relatives', 'are', 'scary', 'people', 'script', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'setting', 'social', 'status', 'inhabit', 'Ree', 'character', 'financial', 'emotional', 'support', 'unexpected', 'source', 'uncle', 'known', 'Teardrop', 'played', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'also', 'deservedly', 'receiving', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor.The', 'movie', 'simmers', 'tension', 'violence', 'very', 'little', 'latter', 'third', 'Ree', 'answers', 'leading', 'bittersweet', 'redemption', 'movie', 'cold', 'tough', 'title', 'stayed', 'days', 'Reminiscent', 'other', 'small', 'indie', 'films', 'such', 'Frozen', 'River', 'movie', 'recognition', 'receiving', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Best', 'Picture', 'certainly', 'tall', 'strong', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'reminders', 'poverty', 'drugs', 'are', 'scourge', 'not', 'only', 'inner', 'cities', 'reclusive', 'settings', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The harsh, poverty stricken and historically insular Ozark community is unflinchingly depicted.  The families who in the past were moonshiners have become ""cookers"" of crank and meth.  Their clannish tendencies have progressed to an almost mafia mentality of secrets and coverups.  Young Ree Dolly is only 17 but has been left to care for 2 young siblings and a mentally ill mother.  Her father, a well known ""cooker"", has disappeared after putting up the family home and land as collateral for his bond.  Ree sets out to find him despite being met with hostility and violence from everyone including her own uncle.

Her life has more burdens than most young wormen could handle. She does not play it as a martyr or with a negative attitude. She plays it as just too busy staying alive to do anything but what she must do. She is one of those stars who has the capability to be working well into her 70s and 80s.

And what do those diverse places share? Drugs! Pot-growing, methamphetamine cooking, crack and crank, drug selling, attended with desperation and violence. Drug addiction is not just a big city problem, and in fact it's not a problem limited to the outcasts, misfits, deadbeats, and indocumentados. There are plenty of big shot and fat cat users whose buying power fuels the gang wars of Mexico and funds the Taliban. And the 'moral turpitude' of the narcotics business isn't any more characteristic of liberals than of reactionaries, Blue States than Red, atheists than fundamentalists. In fact, statistics suggest that the fastest growing drug problem in the USA is meth addiction in socially conservative small towns in parts of the country that are supposed to be apple-pie wholesome and old-fashioned in values, towns where your image of the American Dream would include a white steepled church.""Winter's Bone"" is about an impoverished 'community' in the Missouri Ozarks, where all the men are up to their tailbones in drugs not only using them but 'cooking' them. Even those on the the ""other team"" -- the sheriff, the bail bondsmen, etc. -- in a sense depend on drugs indirectly, and exhibit the same angry out-for-themselves immorality. Jessup Dolly, a tough customer even by the standards of his hard-bitten hill-folk clan, has disappeared just a few days before his scheduled trial for drug production. The problem is that he posted bail using the title to his shabby house and the scrub forest lot around it. His seventeen-year-old daughter, Ree, is informed that if Jessup skips his court appointment, the family will be evicted from their home. Ree's mother is already suffering a psychotic withdrawal, and there are two younger children in Ree's care as well. Ree goes looking for her father, despite the warnings of her closest kin and neighbors that finding him will be mortally dangerous. Ree turns out to be determined, intrepid, tough -- a ""Dolly bred and buttered"" as she says. What she finds eventually is not pleasant.But ""Winter's Bone"" is not just about drug violence and a brave girl solving a mystery. Really it's more about concepts of loyalty, honor, and family cohesiveness. Nearly everyone in Ree's world is related to her by blood, and ""blood"" is supposed to be thicker than money or law. Ree learns that it isn't, and then again it is. ""Honor"" in her language means absolute solidarity against all outsiders. Ree's survival depends on the degree to which her neighbors are certain that she's ""a girl who won't tell nothing to nobody.""Actress Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree Dolly perfectly. John Hawkes is equally convincing as Jessup's fierce, scrawny older brother. Honestly, everyone in the cast of this film is ""real"" in his or her role. There's not a fleck of sentimentality or caricature in their performances. Good dialogue, good camera work, good editing produce a film that deserved the ""Best Picture"" award it won at the 2010 Sundance Festival.That's well and good, but my own 5-star enthusiasm for this film results from its realism as a fictional documentary of one portion of the America ""we"" live in.

1339590,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003EYVXTG,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","WINTER'S BONE is as quiet and insidious as a stem cell carcinoma. Based on the successful novel by author Daniel Woodrell who explains the choice of title explain at the back of his book: ""The `Winter's' part of the title is obvious, and the `Bone' part comes from slang. It can be stated wryly, sarcastically, even tenderly, when throwing a sop to someone, `Oh, give him a bone.' In this case, it is winter itself giving a gift, a bone, to Ree Dolly. The season knows she has earned it, and the term suggests the double-edged aspect of the gesture and is suited to the novel,""  writer Anne Rosellini and writer/director Debra Granik have adapted this story for film and in doing so have presented one of the finest artistic successes of the year.The setting is contemporary Missouri Ozarks where people barely survive, especially during the winter.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in a stunningly sophisticated  performance) is seventeen years old, living in a shack with her clinically depressed mother and her brother and sister: her father Jessup is missing, having been arrested for his dealings in making Crank (crystal meth) - the only source of income for many of the folk in the area, folk who also are users - and posted bail using his house and land as collateral.  Ree has a tough time as the only responsible person for her family and when the local sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) visits to inform Ree that Jessup has skipped town and that if he doesn't show up for his court date, Ree's home and land will be absconded, Ree is devastated.  Ree seeks advice from her many relatives who adamantly refuse to help her out of fear of discovery of involvement in the drug business: Ree sets out to find her father.  She turns to every member of her family (it would seem that most everyone in this pitiful area is blood) she is turned down for help - especially from her father's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) who hesitantly warns her that her father is dead.  She finally gains some assistance through her perseverance only to discover that that Jessup is dead and she is forced to dredge his body from the river to cut off his hands to prove to the court that her father is dead and the threat of evacuation is nullified.The casting of this film is a little miracle: down to the smallest role each actor is exactly right in creating the sullen and desperate atmosphere of this story.  There are rare moments when the tale is not grim, moments such as the gathering of banjo and guitar players in a Pickin' Session to accompanying the singing of a Marideth Sisco.  The cinematography by Michael McDonough  and the musical choices made by Dickon Hinchliffe  recreate the desolation of this pitiful community of people living on the edge in the Ozarks.  But towering above all of this is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence who will undoubtedly now rise to prominence.

1339591,ATYVBUA5E1IDW,B003EYVXTG,Graham,"[6, 10]","Ozark-noir. It's a new genre. Winter's Bone is the reason why. This second film from Debra Granik is an atmospheric, lean, nasty mystery set among the trailers, dilapidated houses, and broken down cars of an unfortunate Ozarks mountain community. Our hero is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (imbued with fearlessness and gravitas by 20 year old Jennifer Lawrence), who we see taking care of her two young siblings and mentally damaged mother. She hunts for squirrels, teaches her brother and sister how to shoot, and generally works to hold their world together. We quickly understand that this is a girl with experience and responsibility far beyond her age. She has been forced to grow up much too fast and the trials she endures through the course of Winter's Bone only reinforce this sad fact. Ree's dad, a local meth cook, has disappeared after posting the bond for his latest arrest. He put up the family home and land as collateral. Ree must find him and make sure he appears in court, or they will lose everything. She sets out on a nightmarish journey of the community and the network of drug dealers, criminals, and miscreants that inhabit it. It becomes increasingly clear what awaits the girl at the end of her journey, and although armed with this vile knowledge, audiences will be unable to look away.Winter's Bone pulls no punches - this is a hard film full of hard people living what look to be very hard lives. It should come as no surprise that it can be hard to watch at times. For those used to the world of noir consisting solely of the seedy nightclubs and alleys of L.A., the setting and mood of Winter's Bone will provide a sharp rebuke. This is the most atmospheric movie of the year and the oppressive, cold gloom settles on the characters, the rusted out cars, and the dilapidated trailers like the thick fog of the Ozarks. This bleakness extends beyond the direction and setting to the characters and performances. Jennifer Lawrence is a revelation here, establishing her character Ree as a force to be reckoned with even though she is just a teenager. She may be nave and unprepared for the danger that awaits her, but she will not yield and Lawrence captures this resolute attitude perfectly. It is a subtle and brilliant performance, but the real showstopper is Teardrop, Ree's frightening drug-addicted uncle, played by John Hawkes in a mesmerizing performance.As played by Hawkes, Teardrop's presence looms over the entire film, and it quickly becomes clear that he is rightly feared by just about everyone. Hawkes has made a career of playing sympathetic nice guys, most famously Sol Starr in Deadwood and more recently Dustin Powers in Eastbound and Down, but here Hawkes shuffles about, all 150 pounds of him, with a look that will chill you to the bone. It is the kind of performance that makes even the most casual observer sit straight up in rapt attention. I have a bad feeling, that Oscar is going to ignore John Hawkes come nomination day, but everyone who sees this film will know that his performance is one of the best committed to celluloid in recent memory.I want to go on, but it's probably best not to divulge any further plot points or details, lest I ruin this dark journey into the criminal world of the Ozarks. This is a brave film, led by two powerful performances and a heavy atmosphere of dread and gloom. You may not ""enjoy "" Winter's Bone in the traditional sense, but this is a film that, through the skill of the performances and quality of the direction, will demand and receive your respect and admiration. 5 out of 5 stars.",5,One of the best movies of the year is probably one you've never heard of,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,3576,"['Ozark-noir', 'new', 'genre', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'reason', 'why', 'second', 'film', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'atmospheric', 'lean', 'nasty', 'mystery', 'set', 'trailers', 'dilapidated', 'houses', 'broken', 'down', 'cars', 'unfortunate', 'Ozarks', 'mountain', 'community', 'hero', '17-year-old', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'imbued', 'fearlessness', 'gravitas', '20', 'year', 'old', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'see', 'taking', 'care', 'two', 'young', 'siblings', 'mentally', 'damaged', 'mother', 'squirrels', 'brother', 'sister', 'how', 'shoot', 'generally', 'hold', 'world', 'together', 'quickly', 'understand', 'girl', 'experience', 'responsibility', 'far', 'age', 'been', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'trials', 'course', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'only', 'sad', 'fact', 'Ree', 'dad', 'local', 'meth', 'cook', 'disappeared', 'posting', 'bond', 'latest', 'arrest', 'put', 'up', 'family', 'home', 'land', 'collateral', 'Ree', 'must', 'find', 'make', 'sure', 'court', 'will', 'lose', 'everything', 'out', 'nightmarish', 'journey', 'community', 'network', 'drug', 'dealers', 'criminals', 'miscreants', 'inhabit', 'increasingly', 'clear', 'what', 'girl', 'end', 'journey', 'armed', 'vile', 'knowledge', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'unable', 'look', 'away.Winter', 'Bone', 'punches', 'hard', 'film', 'full', 'hard', 'people', 'living', 'what', 'look', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'lives', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'used', 'world', 'noir', 'consisting', 'solely', 'seedy', 'nightclubs', 'alleys', 'L.A.', 'setting', 'mood', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'will', 'provide', 'sharp', 'rebuke', 'most', 'atmospheric', 'movie', 'year', 'oppressive', 'cold', 'gloom', 'settles', 'characters', 'rusted', 'cars', 'dilapidated', 'trailers', 'thick', 'fog', 'Ozarks', 'bleakness', 'direction', 'setting', 'characters', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'revelation', 'here', 'establishing', 'character', 'Ree', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'even', 'just', 'teenager', 'may', 'be', 'nave', 'unprepared', 'danger', 'will', 'not', 'yield', 'Lawrence', 'resolute', 'attitude', 'perfectly', 'subtle', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'real', 'showstopper', 'Teardrop', 'Ree', 'frightening', 'drug-addicted', 'uncle', 'played', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'mesmerizing', 'performance.As', 'played', 'Hawkes', 'Teardrop', 'presence', 'entire', 'film', 'quickly', 'clear', 'rightly', 'feared', 'just', 'everyone', 'Hawkes', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'sympathetic', 'nice', 'guys', 'most', 'famously', 'Sol', 'Starr', 'Deadwood', 'more', 'recently', 'Dustin', 'Powers', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'here', 'Hawkes', 'shuffles', '150', 'pounds', 'look', 'will', 'chill', 'bone', 'kind', 'performance', 'even', 'most', 'casual', 'observer', 'sit', 'straight', 'up', 'rapt', 'attention', 'have', 'bad', 'feeling', 'Oscar', 'going', 'ignore', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'come', 'nomination', 'day', 'everyone', 'who', 'film', 'will', 'know', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'recent', 'memory.I', 'want', 'go', 'probably', 'best', 'not', 'divulge', 'further', 'plot', 'points', 'details', 'lest', 'ruin', 'dark', 'journey', 'criminal', 'world', 'Ozarks', 'brave', 'film', 'led', 'two', 'powerful', 'performances', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'dread', 'gloom', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'traditional', 'sense', 'film', 'skill', 'performances', 'quality', 'direction', 'will', 'demand', 'receive', 'respect', 'admiration', '5', '5', 'stars']",N/A

The story which takes 90 minutes could easily have been told in fifteen if everyone didn't take thirty seconds to answer each other, not to mention the panning shots of the bleak landscape.  Yes on top of everything else, it's kind of 'artsy fartsy'.The story of 17 year old Ree Dolly trying to find her father because he has put their house up as collateral for his bond would make a great short story.  But as a full length film it's to empty (just like the scenery).  You would think that the 'true concern' of the extended Dolly family would be to see that Ree, her mother and two siblings (12 year old Sonny, and 6 year old Ashley) could survive the death of their father.  But even though they all know he's dead (they killed him for talking to the Sheriff) they want to ignore her and just act dumb.  Well acting dumb comes easy to these people but family should come first.Every house in the area is either a broken cabin or single wide trailer, with lots of dead cars and appliances all over the property, and Ree and her siblings have no way to get food unless they shoot it.  But the kids are way to well dressed and look like some one does their hair every morning, and we never find out why none of them go to school or that the truant officer never shows up.

Which is not to say that it isn't a good movie. In fact, it is impressive in many ways. Jennifer Lawrence, in her Oscar-nominated lead role, gives an amazing performance as 17 year-old Ree, the oldest daughter of an on-the-lam fugitive and a catatonic, inert mother. Ree must take care of her two younger siblings as she searches her Ozark mountain community in search of her father, who's due to appear in court. If he doesn't, the court will take over their house and evict the family. With the help of some friends and a morally ambiguous uncle (played by John Hawkes, in a role that also earned him an Oscar nomination), Ree tries to track down her father and preserve what little sense of family she has left. Her search yields disturbing and dangerous results, and Ree is forced to face choices and consequences appropriate for someone twice her age. This is a tale of lost innocence and survival.

1339606,A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B003EYVXTG,Jason Stein,"[7, 14]","How ""Winter's Bone"" slipped into the Best Picture category is the very reason the category was widened. Remember last year how ""The Blind Side"" was nominated for Best Picture? The funny thing is that we watched ""Winter's Bone"" before it was nominated (several months before, in fact). When I watched the film I was not familiar with the novel. My experience with novel-to-film adaptations is that the book is ALWAYS better than the film. Always.That being said, I felt the pacing of ""Winter's Bone"" is what really killed it for me. Bordering on boring. You know that this girl is taking care of her family and that her father has disappeared. The premise is compelling, but its execution by the director is aimless. If Martin Scorsese had directed, then this film would have been classic.The ending is anti-climactic, but offers the most memorable scene in the entire film. It's a strange paradox. You see, if you want to see a well made film about white trash and hillbillies then you must be familiar with ""Deliverance"" (1972). It is a classic. The pacing is spot on, the tension is great, the performances by all actors is superb, and it still shocks 40 years later. Did I mention that ""Deliverance"" was also nominated for Best Picture? Yep. ""Winter's Bone"" is forgettable, and that's its greatest sin.I also agree that the then 19 year old Jennifer Lawrence's performance was good for a beginner, but not Oscar-caliber. Just look at what Natalie Portman did for ""Black Swan"", plus all the years Portman spent honing her acting chops. Was Portman nominated for ""The Professional"" (1994)? Nope. Was she good? Yep.In closing, ""Winter's Bone"" was not the worst film of 2010, but neither was it one of the best. It just kind of sat there, and in the end, it was not emotionally compelling cinema. I did not care about the main character's plight because I did not care about the main character, and that is the writer/director's fault. I will not be re-watching ""Winter's Bone"" any time soon, nor will I be recommending that anyone watch this. Instead, I will always suggest ""Deliverance"" in place of ""Winter's Bone"" for your consideration.",3,I'm gonna make you squeal pig.,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,2139,"['How', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'slipped', 'Best', 'Picture', 'category', 'very', 'reason', 'category', 'was', 'widened', 'Remember', 'last', 'year', 'how', 'Blind', 'Side', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'funny', 'thing', 'watched', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'was', 'nominated', 'several', 'months', 'fact', 'When', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'novel', 'experience', 'novel-to-film', 'adaptations', 'book', 'ALWAYS', 'better', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'felt', 'pacing', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'what', 'really', 'killed', 'Bordering', 'boring', 'know', 'girl', 'taking', 'care', 'family', 'father', 'disappeared', 'premise', 'compelling', 'execution', 'director', 'aimless', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'had', 'directed', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'classic.The', 'ending', 'anti-climactic', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'strange', 'paradox', 'see', 'want', 'see', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'white', 'trash', 'hillbillies', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'familiar', 'Deliverance', '1972', 'classic', 'pacing', 'spot', 'tension', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'superb', 'still', '40', 'years', 'later', 'Did', 'mention', 'Deliverance', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Yep', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'forgettable', 'greatest', 'sin.I', 'also', 'agree', 'then', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'beginner', 'not', 'Oscar-caliber', 'Just', 'look', 'what', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'did', 'Black', 'Swan', 'years', 'Portman', 'spent', 'honing', 'acting', 'chops', 'Was', 'Portman', 'nominated', 'Professional', '1994', 'Nope', 'Was', 'good', 'Yep.In', 'closing', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'was', 'not', 'worst', 'film', '2010', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'just', 'kind', 'sat', 'there', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'cinema', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'main', 'character', 'plight', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'main', 'character', 'writer/director', 'fault', 'will', 'not', 'be', 're-watching', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'time', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'recommending', 'anyone', 'watch', 'Instead', 'will', 'always', 'suggest', 'Deliverance', 'place', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'consideration']",N/A

Unfortunately for Ree, her two kid siblings and her catatonic Ma, Dad put up the family shack and land for his bond. If he doesn't show, they lose what little they have. Set in the Missouri Ozarks, the film depicts the harsh living and harsher culture of the hill people who inhabit that part of the world. Men are vicious, women are horny-tough, kids grow up with no options but cooking meth, and the law exists only to the degree that the locals allow it to. To find her Dada and save the family home, Ree has to run counter to every unwritten, yet iron-clad, rule and assumption. The sense of risk, menace and distrust is palpable in every scene. Even family and neighbors can be counted on just so much for support.Jennifer Lawrence, as Ree, is a standout. Whether facing down the local sheriff or tenderly showing her brother and sister how to skin a squirrel, she is real and affecting.

And maybe longer.Winter's Bone, directed by Debra Granik, was adapted from a novel by Daniel Woodrell. It was made in the Ozarks, often in the homes of the people who live there. Shot digitally on a mingy budget, it could pass for state-of-the-art Hollywood --- just raw and unvarnished, like Hollywood never is.The story is simple; this is a straightforward thriller. Ree's father, Jessup Dolly, was busted a while back for cooking methamphetamine. To make bond, he put up his family's house and 300 acres of virgin timber. Now his court date is a week away --- and he's nowhere to be found. The local lawman drives out to warn Ree that the Dollys are in danger of losing their home.Ree's mother has suffered a breakdown and is of no help, either in caring for her children or finding her husband. That puts her daughter --- already burdened by the need to look after her younger brother and sister --- on a mission. And don't think for a minute she'll quit, even though her quest is a walk on a knife edge; she can't turn in her father, all she can do is ask for help in finding him so she can talk to him. And the only people who can help her? His relatives. Some of them make the most addictive drug on the planet. All of them don't understand why she can't remember she's a Dolly --- ""bred and buttered,"" as she says --- and just stop. As they say, ""Talking just causes witnesses.""In its dramatic revelations, its dark surprises, and its no-nonsense portrayal of The Way We Are, the film feels almost like a Greek tragedy --- or an American Western.There's a good reason this film won the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Films and the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at Sundance last winter, and why critic after critic is reaching deep into the superlatives lexicon to praise it as ""the American film of the year"" -- every detail is right. Jenny Lawrence, who plays Ree, comes from Tennessee. John Hawkes, last seen in Deadwood, is Jessup's brother; he's also from the region and looks so much like a member of The Band that it's eerie. Much of the cast is local and non-professional --- and, no offense, but they look like people who might make crank, who could scare you at traffic lights with a sidelong glance, who would quiet you with ""I already told you to shut up with my mouth"" and let their hands do the talking after that.I've never seen a movie that's both painful to watch and impossible to turn away from.

It proves something I discovered a while ago but forgot: If a movie is great, what it's about doesn't matter at all.There's no way in the world I'd ever watch a movie about meth cookers in the Ozarks. Never. Never. Never. Not if you gave me a hundred dollars and a bucket of Original Recipe KFC would I watch a movie about meth cookers, in the Ozarks or anywhere else. Drugs bore and annoy me, and so do squalid, dysfunctional families, and that's all this movie is about. I only watched it to see what Jennifer Lawrence is like, and this seemed like the one to watch since I planned to watch only one.I'd never heard of her until a week or so ago, and from her photos online I figured she was just another of the countless dumb-as-posts bimbos (of both sexes), with armies of publicists and stylists but no more talent or intelligence than a cockroach, who have taken over the entertainment industry in the United States. I'm delighted to be proved wrong, about her. She is amazing.With not the slightest hint that she is acting, she carries this whole movie on her young shoulders and makes a squalid, stupid, barely believable story absolutely fascinating. The other actors are good but not anywhere near her league; and, although the writing, direction, and everything else are top-notch, without her this movie would hardly be worth watching. But WITH her it is the best movie I've seen in years.Whoever won the Oscar over her proves that Oscar voters are idiots (unless it was Natalie Portman, in which case it was just an unfortunate collision of great performances.

I'm thinking that the working title for this film could have been something like, ""Cavalcade Of White Trash Tweaker Hillbillies On Parade In Their Natural Element"" or something like that. It was kind of like a National Geographic Special but one that's gone even further off-the-grid than usual, right here at home in the good ole USA where in the backwoods and hollers of the Ozark Mountains, meth is the new moonshine. Geez, I was seriously planning to buy a vacation home in the Ozarks but after watching this film, I better call my real estate guy there, Cletus, and tell him to forget it now because it really looks like before I move there I better become a tweaker or a meth cook first if I ever want to fit in with everybody else in the neighborhood and MAN, that fitting-in part ain't gonna be an easy thing to do because these people apparently hate and distrust strangers just about as much as they hate and distrust their own blood kin and in THIS movie anyway, (and the old Li'l Abner comics, I'm pretty sure) apparently everybody in the Ozarks is blood kin to EVERYBODY and don't nobody trust nobody NO HOW! What a fun bunch! Foreboding, beneath-the-eyebrow glares and sinister, kill-you-soon-as-look-at-you stares abound from every single stereotypical, white-trash, male or female extra on the screen!

""No."" ""Have you seen my father?"" ""No."" ""Have you seen my father?"" ""No."" which FINALLY, after WAAAAY too much of THAT, eventually turns into, ""Have you seen my father?"" BANG! POW! BOOM! WHAP! as the blood-kin-on-blood-kin, thumping-up party lustfully begins! ""Hey, I got your missing father right HERE! Take THAT! And THAT! And THAT! And THAT!""

Set in the Ozark mountains of Missouri, 17 year old Ree has to find her missing-in-action father and make sure he shows up for a court date; otherwise the bail bonds company will take the modest family house Ree's father put up as his bail collateral.Ree's search for her father puts her in contact with various dangerous types, most outright criminals and most, unfortunately, related to Ree. And everything is set against a social backdrop maybe one or two small steps above outright poverty.Despite the grim story and the grim setting, there are one or two rays of hope, a couple of sympathetic characters, and the small chance that things might just work out. I won't say any more, other than the movie isn't as relentlessly grim as the ads and trailers make it look. But it is mostly grim.

However today, I watched Winter's Bone and I gotta say: Jennifer Lawrence was born to act. She nails it in this movie like a pro; I am surprised she was nominated for her role in this movie and did not win. Winter's Bone the movie itself has a very dark tone and presence that is consistent throughout the movie. And honestly its nothing to be worried about it is not that the film is scary or anything like that, just one of my many observations of this movie. Although Jennifer Lawrence is the only person in this movie I recognize, the supporting cast did a wonderful job. The whole cast helped make this film realistic as possible and for a 1 hr 40 min movie, it works. The story line is good (and relatable for myself), and to conclude I definitely consider Winter's Bone a movie that is daringly different, and utterly enjoyable.5 StarsThank You for reading my reviews!!

1339627,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003EYVXTG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","Winter's Bone is one of those independent features released every year that gets massive notice from the general public and ends up on nearly every year-end list of best films. It takes place in the rural Ozark Mountains, showing a side of America we don't often see in films and uses gritty, unflinching realism in this stark setting while telling a genuinely exciting, plausible story.Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) is 17-years-old and responsible for the well-being of herself and her two younger siblings. Her mother sits in a catatonic state and her father Jessup, a meth cook, isn't around much. One day Sheriff Baskin (Garret Dillahunt) arrives to explain that Jessup has skipped bail and has put the family's house up for his bond. Ree vows to find him, but she lives in a town where almost everyone is involved in drugs and hardly anyone wants to talk. The effects of meth are apparent all through the area in both the rundown look of the houses and the weary, worn faces of its population. When even Jessup's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) refuses to help her find him, Ree must navigate her way through the male-dominated realm of the backwoods to find her father.Although it takes place in the ""backwoods,"" Winter's Bone avoids the stereotypes that generally characterize people in these areas although it seems that nearly every character is related in some way. The film demonstrates very strong characterization in that it doesn't stereotype these people but it doesn't beautify them either. All of the actors look and sound realistic for this setting. Even Ree, the determined protagonist, has only an average vocabulary and though pretty, looks like a girl that has more important things to do than worry about her appearance. Ree is one of the strongest female protagonists to grace the screen in some time. She's strong-willed and determined, but appropriately vulnerable. Roles like this one don't often come along for women, but Lawrence really makes Ree come convincing. She seems to really understand this character and she plays her with the perfect amount of bravado and realism.The film is really well-made, drawing you into the setting with the beautiful photography of absolute poverty-stricken areas and the use of a monotonous color palette. The film uses atmosphere very well to create a mood, but it doesn't emphasize atmosphere over plot. It's a family-drama that also operates as a mystery/suspense film. While I found the atmosphere created by director Debra Granik spellbinding, the plot is very suspenseful and very thrilling.There is one thing that I feel really elevates the greatness of this film that I've deliberately avoided mentioning and that is the revelatory performance by John Hawkes. I'm familiar Hawkes from several movies and television shows, but not until Winter's Bone did I realize the extent of this man's ability. I've read reviews where people will remark that they didn't even recognize an actor until the credits rolled, but I've never personally experienced that until seeing this film. Hawkes proves he's a chameleon and an actor capable of giving a dynamite performance. While this performance hasn't gone completely unnoticed by critics and audiences, it's been widely overshadowed by Jennifer Lawrence.  Hawkes not only brings a great amount of energy to the screen every time he's on it but he takes this character from despicable to ultimately likable. The scene between Teardrop and Sheriff Baskin is one of the most intense scenes of any film from 2010. It is this scene that summarizes why I think Hawkes should win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It's such an intense, captivating performance. When Teardrops asks the Sheriff ""Is this gonna be our time?"" It's a mesmerizing moment. Teardrop is a great role as written, but Hawkes brings something so powerful to it. It is Hawkes that made the biggest impression on me. While Lawrence is deserving of the overwhelming recognition she's received, I wouldn't call her performance a revelation. John Hawkes is simply that good.Winter's Bone is an exciting, suspenseful, and enlightening piece of filmmaking that has the capability to please even the most casual film-goer. Some of the most riveting cinematic moments of 2010 occur in this film. Despite the hype, Winter's Bone is not over-hyped...It's simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking, one of the best films of 2010, and it has my vote for the best supporting male performance of that year as well. This film is definitely worth your time.GRADE: A-",5,"One of the Best of 2010, With Some Stunning Performances",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,4528,"['Winter', 'Bone', 'one', 'independent', 'features', 'released', 'year', 'massive', 'notice', 'general', 'public', 'up', 'nearly', 'year-end', 'list', 'best', 'films', 'place', 'rural', 'Ozark', 'Mountains', 'showing', 'side', 'America', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'films', 'gritty', 'unflinching', 'realism', 'stark', 'setting', 'telling', 'genuinely', 'exciting', 'plausible', 'story.Ree', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', '17-years-old', 'responsible', 'well-being', 'herself', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'mother', 'sits', 'catatonic', 'state', 'father', 'Jessup', 'meth', 'cook', ""n't"", 'around', 'much', 'One', 'day', 'Sheriff', 'Baskin', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'explain', 'Jessup', 'skipped', 'bail', 'put', 'family', 'house', 'up', 'bond', 'Ree', 'find', 'town', 'where', 'almost', 'everyone', 'involved', 'drugs', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'talk', 'effects', 'meth', 'are', 'apparent', 'area', 'rundown', 'look', 'houses', 'weary', 'worn', 'population', 'When', 'even', 'Jessup', 'brother', 'Teardrop', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'help', 'find', 'Ree', 'must', 'navigate', 'way', 'male-dominated', 'realm', 'backwoods', 'find', 'father.Although', 'place', 'backwoods', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'stereotypes', 'generally', 'characterize', 'people', 'areas', 'nearly', 'character', 'related', 'way', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'characterization', ""n't"", 'stereotype', 'people', ""n't"", 'beautify', 'actors', 'look', 'sound', 'realistic', 'setting', 'Even', 'Ree', 'determined', 'protagonist', 'only', 'average', 'vocabulary', 'pretty', 'girl', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'do', 'worry', 'appearance', 'Ree', 'one', 'strongest', 'female', 'protagonists', 'grace', 'screen', 'time', 'strong-willed', 'determined', 'appropriately', 'vulnerable', 'Roles', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'come', 'women', 'Lawrence', 'really', 'Ree', 'come', 'convincing', 'really', 'understand', 'character', 'perfect', 'amount', 'bravado', 'realism.The', 'film', 'really', 'well-made', 'drawing', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'absolute', 'poverty-stricken', 'areas', 'use', 'monotonous', 'color', 'palette', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'well', 'create', 'mood', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'atmosphere', 'plot', 'family-drama', 'also', 'mystery/suspense', 'film', 'found', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'director', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'spellbinding', 'plot', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'very', 'thrilling.There', 'one', 'thing', 'feel', 'really', 'greatness', 'film', ""'ve"", 'deliberately', 'avoided', 'mentioning', 'revelatory', 'performance', 'John', 'Hawkes', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'Hawkes', 'several', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'not', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'did', 'realize', 'extent', 'man', 'ability', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'where', 'people', 'will', 'remark', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'actor', 'credits', 'rolled', ""'ve"", 'never', 'personally', 'experienced', 'seeing', 'film', 'Hawkes', 'chameleon', 'actor', 'capable', 'giving', 'dynamite', 'performance', 'performance', ""n't"", 'gone', 'completely', 'unnoticed', 'critics', 'audiences', 'been', 'widely', 'overshadowed', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Hawkes', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'amount', 'energy', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'despicable', 'ultimately', 'likable', 'scene', 'Teardrop', 'Sheriff', 'Baskin', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'scenes', 'film', '2010', 'scene', 'why', 'think', 'Hawkes', 'should', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'such', 'intense', 'captivating', 'performance', 'When', 'Teardrops', 'Sheriff', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'time', 'mesmerizing', 'moment', 'Teardrop', 'great', 'role', 'written', 'Hawkes', 'something', 'so', 'powerful', 'Hawkes', 'made', 'biggest', 'impression', 'Lawrence', 'deserving', 'overwhelming', 'recognition', 'received', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'performance', 'revelation', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'simply', 'good.Winter', 'Bone', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'enlightening', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'capability', 'please', 'even', 'most', 'casual', 'film-goer', 'most', 'riveting', 'cinematic', 'moments', '2010', 'occur', 'film', 'hype', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'not', 'over-hyped', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010', 'vote', 'best', 'supporting', 'male', 'performance', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

This is set in the Ozarks, and was filmed in the Branson/Springfield area. I live at the edge, where the Ozarks start to give way to the Mississippi Plain (Southeast Missouri). But the results are still the same, in rural Missouri as in other places I'm sure, there is little chance for advancement, so often the people and their kids turn to either a ""check,"" or other means, which often involves cooking meth. With or without kids present.This film really looks at a growing problem in rural America. Parents turning to other means to make money, and the kids are the ones in the middle. Often left parentless, or to be raised by grandparents or left with the state to care for. I have seen an increase in kids raised by grandparents because mom and dad are in prison because of meth. Sometimes parents cook meth with their kids present, and the chemicals that are used are extremely toxic. Often a house that has been used to cook meth must me gutted while wearing hazmat suits. So you can imagine what can happen to kids breathing in those fumes and playing on the carpet that those fumes soak into. Open sores, loss of hair, etc.These kids often grow up to perpetuate the problem, cook meth themselves with their own kids present. It is so bad that the state of Missouri has enacted a law requiring any over the counter drug with Ephedrine to require a doctor's prescription.The film looks at just how a meth cooker's kids can be caught in the middle. With her father gone, and their property put up for his bond, this family may lose their home. Which leaves the only member of the family, the 17 year old daughter to look after her two younger siblings, her mentally ill mother, to forage for food when needed, and to even play detective and search for her father in order to get him to show up to court so they can keep their property. But she may have bitten off more than she can chew, and there are others about who do not want her to find out where her daddy is.I have been to the houses you see, I saw a lot here from my teenage years, when at that time I hung out with some people I shouldn't have hung out with. I had friends like those in the movie, some of whom made it to better things, some of whom did not, and now live in flea infested trailers eeking out a living doing little more than odd jobs and cooking meth. Today I have many of these kids in my classroom. I see what can happen to kids when they've been done this way.So know when you watch this movie your seeking something ""real,"" as real as a film can portray it anyway.",5,This is where I live.

I find a variety of genres interesting and I try to keep an open mind.This movie is very gritty and hard to watch from start to finish. It is not a simple, typical story about backwoods redneck bumpkins. It has a very interesting story line. The teen doesn't have time to worry about herself - she has less than a week to find her felon father or lose the shack that she lives in with her younger siblings and mentally ill mother. She goes through several situations that a man should be dealing with, but she has no one to help her. You won't get any satisfaction in the end - there is no real happy ending. She is never rescued or comforted by a love interest.  I liked the movie because I felt like I was watching something real...it wasn't sugar-coated.

Forget all of the typical stories about rednecks living a hard life, smoking cigarettes, sleeping around, etc. These people are one gene above wild animals. They only have two speeds: #1.

WINTER'S BONE, set in the remote Ozark Mountains, hauntingly depicts this plague. The story focuses on 17-year-old Ree Dolly, whose father has disappeared after putting up the family home as bail collateral. Unless she can find him, Ree and her younger brother and sister will be without a roof over their heads.Ree's father is a ""cooker"" and her mother has been driven into a catatonic state. Ree is on her own in the hostile, clannish, and male-dominated community where she stumbles from trailer to trailer in her frantic search. Crank's ravages are everywhere, in the gaunt and grim faces, the harsh and sudden violence, the cruelty and hopelessness. Her father's only brother, Teardrop (flawlessly played by John Hawkes), holds a spoonful of the white powder out to her and asks, ""Gotten the taste for it yet?"" ""Not yet,"" she recoils.Aside from the down-home soundtrack, Winter's Bone is not easy to watch. Its gritty realism never lets up. The characters look like they climbed from Dorothea Lange's Depression and Dust Bowl images, only with a touch of meth-induced paranoia added to the hunger and despair. The dialogue is sparse, and not once in 100 minutes do we hear laughter or feel much hope for Ree's future. What makes it all bearable is the strength and determination of Ree, movingly played by 19-year-old Jennifer Lawrence.Winter's Bone is winning awards and earning rave reviews. The acclaim is well deserved. To achieve authenticity, director and co-writer Debra Granik and her team spent two years immersing themselves in the local community. Ree's younger sister is even played by a child who lives in the main house in which the movie is set. The film's power makes me want to see Granik's 2005 debut film, ""Down to the Bone,"" another award winner focused on drug addiction and featuring a strong female lead.Postscript #1: For an excellent critical review, I recommend the Feb. 20 analysis by ""Turfseer.""

I like how the actors seem so much like real people, from their non-glamorous looks to their gritty toughness. Jennifer Lawrence plays the part of 17-year old Ree Dolly who is faced with the care of her two younger siblings as well as their practically catatonic mother. Besides this, she also splits wood, looks after the animals and attends high school. The father of the family is missing. Like many others of this clan, he is embroiled in cooking meth.  Most of the cast of characters are quite gaunt and disheveled in appearance, and this, along with their grim and paranoid behavior adds to the believability of the situation. It seems that Ree's dad, Jessop, has gotten himself in deep trouble both with the law and with the clan, and Ree takes on tortuous task of finding him so that she can redeem their house and property which Jessop has ransomed to make bail before he disappeared. The obstacles she must surmount on the way, from the tight-lipped backwoods people to violence and risk of more serious injury would turn a lesser person away.

Driscoll,"[3, 7]","At times this two million dollar Best Picture Oscar nominee is a joyless albeit compelling journey, but for those who know thestorythat Daniel Woodrell adapted his amazing screenplay on, there is far too much vigor in these characters for it be written off as gloomy and not worth the casual film-goer's time.  The mortifying journey's destination is a lively reward indeed.Winter's Bone is without question one of the year's best movies in what amounts to be a very potent field of candidates.  It has been nominated for four Oscars altogether, one additional being the aforementioned adapted screenplay and the others being for performances by its lead Jennifer Lawrence and another for her co-star John Hawkes.  Both are worthy, but given the similar subtle cold determination in their characters I can't help but think it is much more than just things that tie these characters together, but the powerful style this film was intentionally created to possess.  There are very strong controllers behind the scenes here.  Those strengths and many more are directorial ones, and Debra Granik (Down to the Bone) might deserve the most credit of all.  She's been snubbed of an Oscar in my opinion.  The film's cinematography by Michael McDonaugh (who's also credited as a producer) as well as its editing also deserve tremendous praise.Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17 year old girl growing up in The Ozarks.  To say she's experienced a difficult life is an understatement.  Her father is arrested and jumps bond.  Her mother is likely a catatonic schizophrenic while Ree plays the role of surrogate mother to her two younger siblings.  Her father is soon about to cost them their home and he must be found to prevent an already horrible life from getting far worse.The obvious thing about this movie is the future stardom of Jennifer Lawrence.  She's going to be a big deal but in a good way.  The 20 year old is talented in ways that no actress of her generation has yet to display.  Her quiet and layered performance as Ree may not win her the Oscar but she sure does deserve it.  She's so deeply engaged in her character that in scenes where her face maintains a gaze of melancholy bravery, she manages to show us glimpses of what her character is feeling beneath it all.  I think of the fleeting look of joy while seeing a small country band at a birthday party play their fiddles and how badly I wanted to see her smile.  Her character's emotions are contained but apparent, as even her tears are inhibited before they finally see air.  She made Ree among the greatest heroes to appear in film in the last few years.  I hope Hollywood doesn't kidnap Lawrence and make her play superheroes but I fear it's too late.Perhaps the less obvious thing about Winter's Bone is that Debra Granik will go on to create more great movies, but I do suspect with confidence that will happen.  This film is certainly not to be missed.  Everything about it comes together beautifully to tell a very compelling story.

The rednecks in this film are not as over the top as the ones found in Deliverance, which makes them all the more believable and terrifying. This is mostly due to the great dead-eyed performance done by the entire cast. Everyone does a perfect job in their roles, with Lawrence and Hawkes shining particularly bright more then likely due to having the juiciest roles.The cinematography uses grey tones to really bring out the gritty feel that permeates virtually every location shot. The music fits well, though not particularly memorable (probably not the point of it). As I said, Lawrence gives a great performance, but I think she often looks too good to be mixed up with everyone else.

These are the ferociously proud and private poor of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and a Post Apocalypse tone sets the stage for a achingly tense odyssey of 17-year-old Ree Dolly to find the truth behind her father's disappearance into the dirt roads and primordial forest where meth-labs and violent secrets always stand just out of the camera's frame. Guns are drawn only once. There is one terrible beating. But the real violence is a viscous landscape in which dirty cops and family treason are second cousins in a No Exit land-mine riddled maze through which the amazing Jennifer Lawrence as Ree Dolly must fine a way to keep her mentally ill mother and beautiful little brother and sister and homestead alive. Lawrence's 100% real unforgettable performance is the center-of-gravity of a film that proves that American cinema about America can LOOK like a foreign film our own dark places are so unseen on TV.

Their homes are more like junk yards than homes and they live in a culture dominated by drugs and violence (or the threat of violence). Ree is a 17 year old young woman left with the responsibility of raising her 12 year old brother and 7 year old sister and taking care of her mother who suffers from depression and is there in body only.  The father has been in and out of trouble with the law for 'cooking crank' and spent time in prison. They live in a shack of a home with a 100 acres of woods behind.  One of the more poignant moments occurs early when Ree takes her brother & sister to school and as she's leaving she looks in the windows of the classrooms where her peers are learning to care for a baby or practicing ROTC drills or other things that a normal 17 year old girl would be doing in school. But Ree is no ordinary 17 year old no matter how you slice it. She's determined to make it (if only to survive) with the cards she's been dealt. When she finds out that her father used their property as collateral to post bail for his upcoming court appearance and they will lose the home in a week if he doesn't show, she becomes obsessed with finding him to protect the only material possession they have.  No one seems to know (or is willing to tell if they do) where her father is. Finding him is the plot of the story.  But it is also a social drama on this overlooked subculture in America. This is not a feel good, happy ending film. It's a very realistic and well done drama about people who seem to have very little hope in this world for a better life and spend their lives living on the fringe of society with drugs and their family feuds. The violence and the language are not overly graphic or gratuitous but caution in watching with anyone under 15-16.  Well done and well written film about this subculture.

Her mother has had a nervous breakdown, and her father has jumped bail for charges of making methamphetamine.  The 17 year old, Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), has had to grow up fast, and take on parenting her two younger siblings.  They are living on the edge - almost starving - when she learns from the local bail bondsman that her father put a lien on their home.  The sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs her that her father, Jessup, has not shown up for his scheduled court appearance, and she only has a week to find him.  Ree feels the overwhelming responsibility of making sure the family can keep the land and home, their only asset and place to live.  She steels her spirit and is determined to keep the house and property.Ree sets out to find her father, knowing her life could be in danger as well.  She has many confrontations, and a physical beating by the local farmers to keep her off her father's trail.  The worst thing in the community is to be a ""snitch"".  She hears rumors that her dad was killed in a methamphetamine brewing session that went wrong.  She does not believe it, but continues to confront her father's pals in his drugged life.

Even before her parents became unavailable the family was very poor (as almost all other people living in the area) but now Ree makes her family survive from day to day by all sorts of expedients, more and more desperate. And then suddenly she must face a new, completely unexpected and devastating blow... What follows is an incredible, heartbreaking and nervewrecking fight this seemingly defenseless and helpless girl will wage against all odds, with very little help, to save her family... And as Ulysses had to step down to Hades to find his way to Ithaca, so she will have also at one moment to go into the deep, cold darkness... I am not saying anything more.I was and still am in total awe of Jennifer Lawrence's performance in this film. It is not an accident that this was her big break - and once you watched this film you will realise that she simply HAD TO be chosen to play Katniss Everdeen in &#34;Hunger Games&#34; - because in this film she already played her, even if character's name was different.I also simply loved the fact, that this film, although definitely not &#34;Hollywoodian&#34; and very, very grim in its presentation of America's poorest people, contained also lots of very valuable lessons about how to win against even the most unfavorable odds. Ree is not only totally fearless and resolved - she is also clever and always thinks things over before acting. She is not a great speaker but the few words she says are always carefully weighted and measured, to make certain they hit right where she wants them to hit. She never panicks. She always has a plan. And she always, always keeps her calm and preserves her dignity - even when lying in the dirt, coughing blood...This uncorrupted dignity is actually the main source of her power. Unlike many of her teenage friends Ree didn't marry at a young age and she didn't get pregnant either, as so many young girls in the poorest neighborhoods. She NEVER touches to drugs - she even refuses to smoke a joint... She is also probably the only character on the screen who never drinks even one drop of alcohol. Totally focused on the survival of her family she seems to be completely celibate - although she is certainly not indifferent to men, as it is possible to see in scenes when she meets her very, very scary uncle Teardrop... Very ambivalent looks and conversations (and only looks and conversations - nothing more) between Ree and her uncle make some moments of this film more unsettling than most thrillers I saw...The vision of this poor mountainous society living almost totally outside the laws of the rest of the country is another treasure of this film. It is an extraordinary thing, that Ree, who is an extraordinary noble character, shows openly contempt to the policemen - because in this strange world even if you are not a criminal yourself, you simply never talk to cops. Ever.Some &#34;progressist&#34; critics called this film &#34;feminist&#34;, but I didn't see in this film any feminism at all. It is the story about human strength and dignity facing a world as cold and cruel as possible, with as much resolve and courage as one can imagine. Nothing more - but also nothing less.In conclusion, I will repeat just once more - I LOVED this film and I am going to watch it again soon, because this is one of the best movies to be made in the last years.

1339668,AE9IH4LOALC7M,B003EYVXTG,Matthew Allard,"[2, 5]","""Winter's Bone"" takes place in The Ozarks, a mountainous, wooded region of Missouri where the people are dirt poor and the meth business is prosperous. It's an unflattering portrayal, but brutally realistic.Jennifer Lawrence stars as Ree Dolly, a 17 year old who has to take care of her two younger siblings amidst the harsh environment of the Ozarks. We soon find out that Ree's father, Jesup, is a meth cooker. Jesup has gone missing, and he put the family's house and surrounding land up for bond; if he doesn't show up for his court date, the family will lose everything. Ree, then, has the arduous task of having to hunt him down. The first half hour of the film involves Ree trekking across the stark landscape, house to house, asking her neighbors if they know anything. Apparently, just showing up at a neighbor's doorstep is considered a great offense by quite a few in this area, and the line between friend and foe is never clear. She does eventually find an ally in her callous, yet ultimately caring uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes). Together, they try to figure out where her father might be or, if he's dead, what happened. Throughout all of this, Ree's younger siblings are shown lounging around the house, bored to tears. They jump on trampolines, climb on bails of hay, or just lie around to occupy their time, seemingly just waiting to grow up to either join the meth trade or the Army.Having recently seen ""True Grit"", it was impossible for me not to draw comparisons between the strong wills of the two female leads. But while Ree Dolly has all of the determination of Maddi Ross, she has none of the naivet&eacute;. No, Ree Dolly is hardened to the territory, and knows exactly how rough the people of her community really are. She has no qualms with telling people she's scared of them, despite never showing it on her face. Hats off to Jennifer Lawrence. Overall, ""Winter's Bone"" is an impressive film, if just in showing the ravages of methamphetamine on a rural area. The plot never really progresses in a satisfying way, and the climax (or lack thereof) left me a bit underwhelmed. However, in terms painting a picture of a culture I knew almost nothing about, it was very well done.",4,Unflattering; Brutally Realistic,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,2207,"['Winter', 'Bone', 'place', 'Ozarks', 'mountainous', 'wooded', 'region', 'Missouri', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'dirt', 'poor', 'meth', 'business', 'prosperous', 'unflattering', 'portrayal', 'brutally', 'realistic.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'stars', 'Ree', 'Dolly', '17', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'harsh', 'environment', 'Ozarks', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Ree', 'father', 'Jesup', 'meth', 'cooker', 'Jesup', 'gone', 'missing', 'put', 'family', 'house', 'surrounding', 'land', 'up', 'bond', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'court', 'date', 'family', 'will', 'lose', 'everything', 'Ree', 'then', 'arduous', 'task', 'having', 'hunt', 'down', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'Ree', 'trekking', 'stark', 'landscape', 'house', 'house', 'asking', 'neighbors', 'know', 'anything', 'Apparently', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'neighbor', 'doorstep', 'considered', 'great', 'offense', 'few', 'area', 'line', 'friend', 'foe', 'never', 'clear', 'eventually', 'find', 'ally', 'callous', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'caring', 'uncle', 'Teardrop', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Together', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'father', 'might', 'be', 'dead', 'what', 'happened', 'Ree', 'younger', 'siblings', 'are', 'shown', 'lounging', 'house', 'bored', 'tears', 'jump', 'trampolines', 'climb', 'bails', 'hay', 'just', 'lie', 'around', 'occupy', 'time', 'seemingly', 'just', 'waiting', 'grow', 'up', 'join', 'meth', 'trade', 'Army.Having', 'recently', 'seen', 'True', 'Grit', 'was', 'impossible', 'not', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'strong', 'wills', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'determination', 'Maddi', 'Ross', 'none', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'No', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'hardened', 'territory', 'exactly', 'how', 'rough', 'people', 'community', 'really', 'are', 'qualms', 'telling', 'people', 'scared', 'never', 'showing', 'face', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Overall', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'impressive', 'film', 'just', 'showing', 'ravages', 'methamphetamine', 'rural', 'area', 'plot', 'never', 'really', 'satisfying', 'way', 'climax', 'lack', 'thereof', 'left', 'bit', 'underwhelmed', 'However', 'terms', 'painting', 'picture', 'culture', 'knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done']",N/A

It is everything that is now, at least in pop music. This makes it all the more natural for the critical darling ""Winter's Bone"" to catch me just at the right moment, to become that annual indie movie I just can't shut up about, right?Here's the problem: Neo-folk, as best I understand it, is perhaps most significant for being a genre of music that has never, nor will ever, attempt to exist. When Fleet Foxes or The Decemberists put down ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" just long enough to pick up a banjo and a jug and sing a song about their heartfelt Christian beliefs or how hard it is to chop down a tree, we are to immediately assume they are speaking metaphorically.Not so with ""Winter's Bone"". It seems to get stuck halfway between literal and metaphorical and thus not only does it basically end up with neither, it also completely alienates itself from the genre which made it relevant in the first place. There's log cabins, the chopping of firewood, and bizarre masculine legal codes that only exist in westerns, but there's also trailers, crystal meth, and U.S. Army recruitment. Ya can't tell whether it wants to be ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""Precious"".And I guess it wants to be a bit of both. But the problem with that, and the reason this movie just isn't any good, is that when you bring the neo-folk concept out of a purely literary environment and cast the light of modern reality on it, it just doesn't mean anything anymore. The abstraction of purity juxtaposed with the supposedly ""impure"" contemporary doesn't make a statement as much as it makes a sigh. This movie does A LOT of sighing.This is the natural jumping-off point for me to touch on the rampant feminism of the film, so let's do so. Yes, all the sighing is probably a girl thing, and I probably just don't understand how significant sighing really is because I'm a dude. Let's just assume that's true. Even still, I refuse now and always will refuse to accept that I need any sort of double standard within my film criticism, irrespective of the gender or creed of the filmmaker. I'm not just gonna let this slide because it's a ""powerful"" feminist narrative and the world needs more of those (which is the position I assume most critics took when grading the film).What can I say, I'm an egalitarian.

Debra Granik's film ""Winter's Bone,"" based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a bleak, unforgettable folk tale about a teenage girl whose struggle for survival takes her to dark places few people ever have the misfortune to see.Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), a 17-yer-old girl in the Missouri Ozarks, has dropped out of school to care for her younger siblings and her severely depressed, catatonic mother. Deserted by her methamphetamine-cooking father Jessup, Ree manages to keep the family going until the day the sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) shows up at their cabin. Jessup has skipped bail, the sheriff tells her, and he put up the cabin as surety. Jessup has one week to show up in court, or the cabin is forfeit.""Winter's Bone"" is the story of Ree's desperate search for her father to prevent her family from being thrown out into the woods. This search, without going into plot points, costs her dearly. The Ozarks are already a place where people learn early to mind their business and not to go snooping in other peoples'. Add meth dealing to the picture, and the situation turns deadly. Ree finds scant sympathy from her neighbors and even her own extended family. Her scary Uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) makes it excruciatingly plain that her questions are unwelcome. Yet Teardrop's reaction is mild compared with that of the even scarier people he works for. ""We warned you,"" Merab (Dale Dickey), wife of the local meth boss, tells Ree. ""Why didn't you listen?""""Winter's Bone"" is a masterful film, seamlessly mixing delicate lyricism and white-knuckle suspense. The acting is superb down to the smallest bit part. Nineteen-year-old Jennifer Lawrence, in her first starring role, scarcely seems to be acting; she really seems to be this frail girl, armed only with courage and a fierce love of her family, facing down monsters. Blessed with an uncommonly smart, poignant music score from a number of Ozarks musicians, ""Winter's Bone"" is the best film so far this year, and it seems unlikely that any film will exceed it.It has already won major prizes at the Sundance and Berlin film festivals; here's hoping it can add an Oscar or two to the tally.",5,"A bleak, brilliant folk tale.",1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,2264,"['theme', 'innocence', 'unprotected', 'fighting', 'life', 'one', 'oldest', 'most', 'potent', 'fiction', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'film', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'based', 'novel', 'Daniel', 'Woodrell', 'bleak', 'unforgettable', 'folk', 'tale', 'teenage', 'girl', 'struggle', 'survival', 'dark', 'places', 'few', 'people', 'ever', 'have', 'misfortune', 'see.Ree', 'Dolly', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', '17-yer-old', 'girl', 'Missouri', 'Ozarks', 'dropped', 'school', 'care', 'younger', 'siblings', 'severely', 'depressed', 'catatonic', 'mother', 'Deserted', 'methamphetamine-cooking', 'father', 'Jessup', 'Ree', 'keep', 'family', 'going', 'day', 'sheriff', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'up', 'cabin', 'Jessup', 'skipped', 'bail', 'sheriff', 'put', 'up', 'cabin', 'surety', 'Jessup', 'one', 'week', 'show', 'up', 'court', 'cabin', 'forfeit', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'story', 'Ree', 'desperate', 'search', 'father', 'prevent', 'family', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'woods', 'search', 'going', 'plot', 'points', 'dearly', 'Ozarks', 'are', 'already', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'learn', 'early', 'mind', 'business', 'not', 'go', 'snooping', 'other', 'peoples', 'Add', 'meth', 'dealing', 'picture', 'situation', 'deadly', 'Ree', 'scant', 'sympathy', 'neighbors', 'even', 'own', 'extended', 'family', 'scary', 'Uncle', 'Teardrop', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'excruciatingly', 'plain', 'questions', 'are', 'unwelcome', 'Teardrop', 'reaction', 'mild', 'compared', 'even', 'scarier', 'people', 'warned', 'Merab', 'Dale', 'Dickey', 'wife', 'local', 'meth', 'boss', 'tells', 'Ree', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'masterful', 'film', 'seamlessly', 'mixing', 'delicate', 'lyricism', 'white-knuckle', 'suspense', 'acting', 'superb', 'down', 'smallest', 'bit', 'part', 'Nineteen-year-old', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'scarcely', 'be', 'acting', 'really', 'be', 'frail', 'girl', 'armed', 'only', 'courage', 'fierce', 'love', 'family', 'facing', 'down', 'monsters', 'Blessed', 'uncommonly', 'smart', 'poignant', 'music', 'score', 'number', 'Ozarks', 'musicians', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'best', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'unlikely', 'film', 'will', 'exceed', 'it.It', 'already', 'won', 'major', 'prizes', 'Sundance', 'Berlin', 'film', 'festivals', 'here', 'hoping', 'can', 'add', 'Oscar', 'two', 'tally']",N/A

The unlikely heroine is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger brother and sister on their dilapidated property in the Ozarks, rural Missouri. She does her best to impart to her siblings the skills they will need to survive on this hardscrabble land with barely enough food to eat and no functional parents. If that weren't hardship enough, the Sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs Ree that her father Jessup, who makes crystal meth, used the family property to guarantee his bail bond...and then skipped bail. If Ree can't find Jessup before his court date, the family will lose its home. So she sets out to track him down and finds herself in a perilous position with no one willing to help.Debra Granik co-wrote this screenplay and directed the film, which was shot in just 24 1/2 days on location in Missouri. The environment is very much a character and a strong presence in every single shot, thanks to cinematographer Michael McDonough. At first I found the unrelenting destitution and hardness heavy-handed, but it seemed natural after a while. The fact that the film takes place primarily outdoors helps. The electrifying focal point is Ree as portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. She's a young woman with a quiet determination, tough, unsentimental, but somehow confident in her ability to succeed. This spark of optimism is a bit of youthful naivet&eacute; in an otherwise cynical character, but it brings the audience to her like lightning to a rod. Ree is something to hear. It's her voice -what she says, not what she does- that is absolutely captivating.The DVD (Lionsgate 2010): Bonus features include an Alternate Opening (1  min), 4 Deleted Scenes, music credits (text), a theatrical trailer (2  min), and a music video for ""Hardscrabble Elegy: Composed and Performed by Dickon Hinchliffe"" (3 min). ""The Making of Winter's Bone"" (45 min) is behind-the-scenes footage, rehearsal footage, and includes some deleted scenes. There is no narration, just the clips strung together.

""Winter's Bone""  is set in poor rural Missouri which is even more bleak than the setting in ""Burning Plain"". Ree at 17 heads a family consisting of siblings of 12 and 7, a mother who is mentally ill and jail prone dad who's disappeared. He must show up for trial in a week or the family will forfeit the family home and property. Hell, it must only be worth $100 and that's if you set fire to everything. In any case, it's all they have. Ree sets out on foot (can't afford a vehicle) through the rural countryside to find clues about her dad's whereabouts. He's a meth cook and distributor but it's clear he got in trouble with the bad guys when he blabbered while in custody. Ree is determined to find him or his remains so the bond can be lifted and they can return to their life of eating dirt. It's unsettling to watch, but I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.I saw this film when it first opened and mentally nominated Jennifer Lawrence for an Oscar for her strong performance as Ree, the reluctant matriarch of a poor family in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.  John Hawkes was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for his role of Teardrop, Ree's uncle. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant especially Dale Dickey as Merab, the wife of the county drug lord. Old favorite Sheryl Lee shows up in a small but terrific performance as the ex-girlfriend of Ree's dad.

She has to look after her crazy-sick mother and two younger siblings; her father Jessup has vanished. We learn quickly that Jessup cooked crystal meth - the major means of support for many of the families in this area - and that he had been caught a couple of weeks previously, and put up his house and property for bond. Now he's disappeared, and the house and land will be taken away from the family if he can't be found, so it's up to Ree to find him. Unfortunately, even though nearly all of the exhausted, depressed and sullen people she comes across in her odyssey through the gloomy, blighted yet beautiful landscape of rocky hills and scrubby forests are related to her, very few of them are willing to give her so much as the time of day. Suspicious of the law, they're unwilling to even help one of their own stave off homelessness - and some of them are more than willing to show her what comes of asking too many questions.This is a really powerful and stark, unsentimental look at the underbelly of American rural life. Most of the characters here are really unpleasant, even downright hateful, prone to quick violence and selfish and paranoid in the extreme - at least, on the surface. One of the most brilliant facets of this excellent film, cowritten and directed by Debra Granik, is that it slowly reveals a modicum of humanity in most of these gruff exteriors - and also shows that for all of Ree's bearing as someone who stays away from drugs herself and is trying to keep her family going, she's just as much a part of this tragic and beat-down culture as the rest of them. It's sad but not surprising for example that she never even THINKS to go to any authorities to help find her father - even once she starts to suspect that he's been killed, and knows who the killers are likely to be. Even when she's been beaten half to death, she relies only on herself and, eventually, her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes), a frightening and clearly very violent man who nevertheless has a streak of decency as regards his own family, and a pride in helping out those who need it.Hawkes is getting a lot of justifiable praise for his performance, which should end up winning plenty of Supporting Actor awards as the year goes on, but the 19-year-old Lawrence does just as good a job in a much less show-offy role, always convincing as a determined and still vaguely hopeful young woman just on the cusp of learning that life isn't going to be good for her if she stays here.

She's just seventeen, and stuck running the household, with two younger siblings to feed and a catatonic mother to care for.  ""Don't never ask for nothing what ought to be offered"" is the motto of this resourceful and proud young woman.  She does a good job, given meager resources - but her father's been away a long time, out on bail for cooking crystal meth, and he put up the house and the land as collateral.  The only thing for it is to find him, and nobody wants to help, and she comes to see that knowing can be dangerous.For a small-scale, low-budget, independent feature, the film looks great: the desolate beauty of the landscapes, the delicate montages of the two innocent and largely unaware siblings engaged in resourceful play, the authentic settings, and the seasonal lighting.  The film as a whole is richly imagined, with strong performances and an unsettling mood.  The story is strong, managing to convey without exposition or voiceover the tension that exists in this region between a rich folk tradition and a stark economic necessity that has driven many of the locals to support themselves through the illegal drug trade, and the tension between familial loyalty and the need for self-preservation.  At times it felt like perhaps the screenplay undercut the realism - it aimed so deliberately at economy of exposition that the characters become something like vernacular poets, implausibly tending to convey a wealth of details with a minimum of words, rather than just being reticent  Still, the sense of mystery that drives Ree's exploration is sustained throughout, and kept me on the edge of my seat and caring throughout.  This isn't a masterpiece, but is solid storytelling that creates the right atmosphere, and makes the most of limited resources.Jennifer Lawrence immersed herself thoroughly in character as Ree, and her uncle ""Teardrop"" was brilliantly played by Tom Hawkes, who always seemed more vulnerable in other roles I've seen him in, such as Deadwood, but he's fierce here, and convinced me as someone you wouldn't want to mess with.  What I found perhaps most fascinating was the characterization of some of the other women in the story, who serve as gatekeepers to the clan leader, Floyd.  They seemed at first heartlessly vicious, but it struck me later they didn't like to be violent and saw their brutality as a kind of kindness, intended to protect.  A powerful film, that stands up well to similarly powerful films about surprisingly strong individuals facing impossible circumstances in the midst of destitution, such asTrouble the WaterandUndertow.",4,A riveting backwoods thriller - exploring the limits of family loyalty in the cold mountains of the Ozarks,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,2689,"['Ree', 'enough', 'deal', 'even', 'out', 'house', 'due', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'just', 'seventeen', 'stuck', 'running', 'household', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'feed', 'catatonic', 'mother', 'care', 'Do', ""n't"", 'never', 'ask', 'nothing', 'what', 'ought', 'be', 'offered', 'motto', 'resourceful', 'proud', 'young', 'woman', 'good', 'job', 'given', 'meager', 'resources', 'father', 'been', 'away', 'long', 'time', 'bail', 'cooking', 'crystal', 'meth', 'put', 'up', 'house', 'land', 'collateral', 'only', 'thing', 'find', 'nobody', 'help', 'see', 'knowing', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous.For', 'small-scale', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'feature', 'film', 'great', 'desolate', 'beauty', 'landscapes', 'delicate', 'montages', 'two', 'innocent', 'largely', 'unaware', 'siblings', 'engaged', 'resourceful', 'play', 'authentic', 'settings', 'seasonal', 'lighting', 'film', 'whole', 'richly', 'imagined', 'strong', 'performances', 'unsettling', 'mood', 'story', 'strong', 'managing', 'convey', 'exposition', 'voiceover', 'tension', 'region', 'rich', 'folk', 'tradition', 'stark', 'economic', 'necessity', 'driven', 'many', 'locals', 'support', 'illegal', 'drug', 'trade', 'tension', 'familial', 'loyalty', 'need', 'self-preservation', 'times', 'felt', 'perhaps', 'screenplay', 'undercut', 'realism', 'aimed', 'so', 'deliberately', 'economy', 'exposition', 'characters', 'become', 'something', 'vernacular', 'poets', 'implausibly', 'tending', 'convey', 'wealth', 'details', 'minimum', 'words', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'reticent', 'Still', 'sense', 'mystery', 'Ree', 'exploration', 'sustained', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'caring', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'solid', 'storytelling', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'most', 'limited', 'resources.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'immersed', 'thoroughly', 'character', 'Ree', 'uncle', 'Teardrop', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'always', 'seemed', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'other', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'such', 'Deadwood', 'fierce', 'here', 'convinced', 'someone', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'mess', 'What', 'found', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fascinating', 'was', 'characterization', 'other', 'women', 'story', 'who', 'serve', 'gatekeepers', 'clan', 'leader', 'Floyd', 'seemed', 'first', 'heartlessly', 'vicious', 'struck', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'violent', 'saw', 'brutality', 'kind', 'kindness', 'intended', 'protect', 'powerful', 'film', 'up', 'well', 'similarly', 'powerful', 'films', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'individuals', 'facing', 'impossible', 'circumstances', 'midst', 'destitution', 'such', 'asTrouble', 'WaterandUndertow']",N/A

1339691,A12FLZREV32JOP,B003EYVXTG,Noelle Eiram,"[13, 25]","Though Winter's Bone builds an atmosphere of dread, self-consciousness undermines its resonance.Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with her family in the Missouri Ozarks. Her drug dealing father, nowhere to be found, has put up their house and land as collateral for his bail. Ree vows to find him even as she cares for her younger siblings and mentally ill mother. She must face down hostile relatives to get to the truth behind her father's disappearance and, more importantly, save her home.Winter's Bone (an adaptation of Daniel Woodrell's novel ) feels like a cultural lesson in rural poverty. Close ups accompany tense moments. A shaky camera conveys the area's rawness. Winter is captured in rare beauty, with its dead leaves, barren trees, and back roads. Scenes of everyday survival (including wood chopping and squirrel hunting) are interspersed with Ree's search for her father. Unfortunately, the filmmakers' obvious (but largely successful) attempts at authenticity come across as manipulative. The unusual filmic setting is the foreground, which makes the characters somewhat secondary.Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Ree, but her character is difficult to identify with. A youth with troubles beyond anyone's years is not unrealistic, but Ree is nearly perfect. Unselfish, wise, understanding, tough, and above all determined, Ree is willing to sacrifice everything for her wards, without ever losing her temper with them. She has bouts of insecurity and navet&eacute;, but she is more admirable than interesting.The acting is quite good, though little liveliness is shown. Characters' pinched cheeks, chapped lips, and grim faces are realistic, but few leave an impression. In fact the only fascinating presence is Teardrop (John Hawkes), Ree's coke addicted uncle. Ambiguous and scary but loyal, Teardrop is not someone you want as an enemy.Overly poetic dialogue jars with the rest of the film's painstaking attempts at realism. Saintly Ree gives her brother advice such as ""don't ask for what ought to be offered,"" and notes that she is a ""Dolly, bred and buttered."" Also, Ree's search gets rather repetitive as she is told by person after person to give up her quest.Since images of barren trees and a haunting, gorgeous soundtrack evoke an ominous mood from the beginning, any darkness that lies within the community doesn't come as a shock. More surprising are the displays of genuine kindness.

Their mother has become handicapped and mute after years of methamphetamine abuse. Their father is released from jail and puts their house and property up for his bail hearing. The problem is that he disappears. This sends Ree on a search of the town for him, because without him, they will lose what little they have. Ree tries tracking him throuhg friends, and his drug buddies, a mistress and his own brothers. She knows what is at steak and feels the responsibility of her familys world on her very young shoulders.This is truly one of the best film's of 2010. Touching for the passion this girl has inside of her to save what family she has, and heartbreaking at the gravity of the situation and the lifestyle that these people live, you can't helped but feel a range of emotions while watching this film. From start to finish youre hands will be clenched to the seat as you wonder just how our ""hero"" will save her family from the impending reality that is quickly closing upon them. You forget that you're watching a film as the acting is beautifully portrayed. You could see any of these people in any unnamed, poor mid-western town.The cinematography is nothing short of absolutely breathtaking. Never sunny but always with a gloomy haze, the weather and landscapes reflect the desperation and depression lurking just underneath the eyes of Ree. The acting is top notch. In fact, you forget you're watching actors portraying characters.This is a movie that won't make for a great pick you up - but it's not meant to. It's meant to tell a story and that's exactly what it does. This is powerful film making. You want to make sure you check this film out.

1339702,A26255E0YUCEAC,B003EYVXTG,Quiero Cafe,"[2, 6]","First off, gotta say, yes there are such people.  It's hard for non-Southerners to accept that such seemingly broadly drawn characters really do exist - that there are people who have broken down cars and shootin-refrigerators in their front yard.  Yet, if I were to go outside and throw a rock I would be quite likely to hit something matching the squalor in this movie.Yet, the accuracy of the milieu is tertiary to the point of the movie proper - up to and including the fact that meth is the community vice and trade as opposed to moonshine or black market pantyhose.  I only mention it because most of the pro and con arguments I read are focused on this or that particular detail that the movie presents.  OMG, the hero is a girl.  I'm not even sure what movie people walk away having seen, since they can't penetrate the curtain and actually watch the film with open eyes.  In some ways the movie has a whole separate life as a test to reveal the mental furniture of the beholder.Pretty much everything great about the movie has been ground to meal by now - the superiority of the cast, the luminosity of the cinematography, the deliberate pacing and intrigue, the disturbing moments.  Yet I think one essential and primary element of the film is overlooked - that this is a movie about hope.  Ree casts herself fearlessly into the jaws of very nasty people not because she wants to, not to prove a point about herself, perhaps not even to accomplish the goal of saving her small family.  She does what she does because it is the only path she can see to take, and she meets the obstacles one by one with determination, yes, but mainly hope.  In the end, she believes in the underlying potential for simple human goodness in the older people she confronts far more than they would believe it in themselves.  I believe that that's what keeps us compelled to watch.  Far from being a ""bleak"" movie, as it's often described, it is a movie that asks us where our own courage and faith in humanity might be - perhaps makes us remember a time when we could have been Ree.

That rating means I thought this movie has a few good points and, *gasp!*, a good deal of bad points. And I'm not a cinema elitist who disregards every blockbuster ever made and thinks every indier-than-thou flick is by default great. I rate films out of honesty, and this is what I honestly think of Winter's Bone.First off I can't deny this film is gorgeously shot. There's some great and nifty camera work in the movie and the scenery is just pure eye candy. I loved the opening shots and ominous, dark tone... and then the characters started talking. Seriously, the dialogue is so overblown and tacky. I was laughing at pretty much 80% of the lines spoken in the film. How this was up for Best Screenplay is against me.What very little plot there is relies on the protagonist being ten times as stupid as the characters in most movies today. It's about a girl at risk of losing her home searching for her father. What feels like an hour of the film is devoted to silent footage of the protagonist walking through the woods. If you cut half of the ""walking through the woods"" out, the movie would be an hour long. And again, there was a lot of buildup but NO ENDING... it just ends.The actors do a pretty good job given the script, but this film is a massive bore.

A film this complex can only be appreciated if one can understand its rich wealth of subtext, motivation and family pride. Jennifer Lawrence's Ree isn't just looking for her dad. She has a desperate drive to hold on to her family home; her concern for her young siblings and ill mom are a powerful motivation. The almost animal-like behavior of the local folk is merely an age-old tradition of survival. These traditions are sacred, secrets abound, and we are along with Ree in her quest of discovery; her idea of family is more profound than most (since most of the folk are in-bred, referred to often). Ms Lawrence is riveting in her performance, a wisdom way beyond her years, a determination and zeal not willing to compromise and go quietly. She must certainly be deserving of an Oscar nomination. Excellent support from John Hawkes (her uncle, Teardrop) and the feisty Dale Dickey, a tough broad with more than she's telling. Debra Granik's direction is fine, with precision that flows seamlessly. Filmed in the Missouri Ozarks, many locals were used to fill other supporting roles, and they all succeed. The little kids were naturals, nothing forced or phony in their portrayals. The final resolution is a little unsettling, but wrought with a severity that almost unhinges Ree, but she stays strong to the bitter end.

Because the bail her dad put up was the deed to the Dolly house and land.  This would have left Ree and her two young siblings and her mentally ill mother homeless.The book showed in great detail a land wracked by poverty and ruined by crystal meth.  An insular society where the only code is not revealing anything to the outside world, especially law enforcement.  But a society where women, especially teen girls, are not allowed to snoop and pry into the doings of the men.  A society in which being beaten or killed for asking the wrong question is tolerated.  A world of grinding poverty, poor health care and terrible education.  And in the midst of all this, was the heroic Ree...smarter than everyone around her, but also forced to accept a role beyond her years.The book was atmospheric and well-written.  But it was slowly paced and ultimately a bit boring.Now the film version has come along, and it captures the book nearly perfectly.  Both the successes and the failures.  The film does an outstanding job of capturing the landscape and the desolation.  There are many movies that show bleak landscapes and somehow make them beautiful.  WINTER'S BONE shows an area that is deeply unattractive and does not try to show any hidden beauty or stark nobility.  It's cold and it's covered with trash.  You look at the land, and realize that no one COULD ever prosper there...the poverty we see has bled into the land.  This is very effectively captured throughout the movie.Ree Dolly, who is in every scene of the film, is played by Jennifer Lawrence.  She looks a little like a young, cherubic Renee Zellweger.  It's her first major role, and she is thoroughly committed and accomplished.  Her accent is perfect, and she captures the great intelligence of her character.  It's an intelligence that has been muted by circumstance.  And she's also very brave, because she knows she has no choice but to succeed in her quest, even at the risk of her own safety.  Most other roles are fairly small, but all are played well.  I particularly liked John Hawkes, who played Ree's Uncle Teardrop.  A mildly dangerous man who feels compelled to help out his kin.So there was much to admire in the film.  It certainly treated the book faithfully.  And thus, the movie was slowly paced and boring.  It was frankly hard to care much about most of the characters.  Even Ree is mostly compelling intellectually, not emotionally.  Everyone tends to move very slowly, and there are just a lot of scenes of Ree walking from place to place.  Again, we get a GREAT sense of the place...but if I just wanted to look at landscapes, I'd watch a Terrence Malick film.  I want some compelling story, purpose or character to draw me along...and to a large extent, that is just missing.  And as with the book, the ending is anti-climactic.  It fits the whole morose, slow-paced tone of the story...but it also results in a film that never raises our pulse.  Honestly, I simply struggled to remain awake to the end, even though the movie is only 98 minutes.Jennifer Lawrence may get a well-deserved boost to her career with WINTER'S BONE.  And often, a good performance is enough for me to recommend seeing a film...I think good acting needs to be seen and appreciated.  However, the film has too many other problems, and I'd recommend passing by this dark, dreary journey.",3,2.5 stars.  Jennifer Lawrence gives a nice performance but the movie bored me.,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,3690,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'read', 'Daniel', 'Woodrell', 'WINTER', 'BONE', 'found', 'much', 'admire', 'Set', 'most', 'destitute', 'portions', 'nation', 'Ozark', 'country', 'southern', 'Missouri', 'told', 'story', 'young', 'Ree', 'Dolly', '17-year-old', 'girl', 'desperate', 'efforts', 'find', 'missing', 'father', 'bring', 'court', 'bail', 'revoked', 'bail', 'dad', 'put', 'up', 'was', 'deed', 'Dolly', 'house', 'land', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'Ree', 'two', 'young', 'siblings', 'mentally', 'ill', 'homeless.The', 'book', 'showed', 'great', 'detail', 'land', 'wracked', 'poverty', 'ruined', 'crystal', 'meth', 'insular', 'society', 'where', 'only', 'code', 'not', 'revealing', 'anything', 'outside', 'world', 'especially', 'law', 'enforcement', 'society', 'where', 'women', 'especially', 'teen', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'snoop', 'pry', 'doings', 'men', 'society', 'being', 'beaten', 'killed', 'asking', 'wrong', 'question', 'tolerated', 'world', 'grinding', 'poverty', 'poor', 'health', 'care', 'terrible', 'education', 'midst', 'was', 'heroic', 'Ree', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'also', 'forced', 'accept', 'role', 'years.The', 'book', 'was', 'atmospheric', 'well-written', 'was', 'slowly', 'paced', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'film', 'version', 'come', 'book', 'nearly', 'perfectly', 'successes', 'failures', 'film', 'outstanding', 'job', 'capturing', 'landscape', 'desolation', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'show', 'bleak', 'landscapes', 'somehow', 'make', 'beautiful', 'WINTER', 'BONE', 'area', 'deeply', 'unattractive', 'not', 'try', 'show', 'hidden', 'beauty', 'stark', 'nobility', 'cold', 'covered', 'trash', 'look', 'land', 'realize', 'one', 'COULD', 'ever', 'poverty', 'see', 'bled', 'land', 'very', 'effectively', 'captured', 'movie.Ree', 'Dolly', 'who', 'scene', 'film', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'little', 'young', 'cherubic', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'thoroughly', 'committed', 'accomplished', 'accent', 'perfect', 'great', 'intelligence', 'character', 'intelligence', 'been', 'muted', 'circumstance', 'also', 'very', 'brave', 'choice', 'succeed', 'quest', 'even', 'risk', 'own', 'safety', 'Most', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'fairly', 'small', 'are', 'played', 'well', 'particularly', 'liked', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'played', 'Ree', 'Uncle', 'Teardrop', 'A', 'mildly', 'dangerous', 'man', 'who', 'compelled', 'help', 'out', 'kin.So', 'was', 'much', 'admire', 'film', 'certainly', 'treated', 'book', 'faithfully', 'thus', 'movie', 'was', 'slowly', 'paced', 'boring', 'was', 'frankly', 'hard', 'care', 'much', 'most', 'characters', 'Even', 'Ree', 'mostly', 'compelling', 'intellectually', 'not', 'emotionally', 'Everyone', 'move', 'very', 'slowly', 'are', 'just', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Ree', 'walking', 'place', 'place', 'Again', 'get', 'GREAT', 'sense', 'place', 'just', 'wanted', 'look', 'landscapes', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'film', 'want', 'compelling', 'story', 'purpose', 'character', 'draw', 'large', 'extent', 'just', 'missing', 'book', 'ending', 'anti-climactic', 'whole', 'morose', 'slow-paced', 'tone', 'story', 'also', 'results', 'film', 'never', 'pulse', 'Honestly', 'simply', 'struggled', 'remain', 'awake', 'end', 'even', 'movie', 'only', '98', 'minutes.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'may', 'get', 'well-deserved', 'boost', 'career', 'WINTER', 'BONE', 'often', 'good', 'performance', 'enough', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'think', 'good', 'acting', 'needs', 'be', 'seen', 'appreciated', 'However', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'problems', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'passing', 'dark', 'dreary', 'journey']",N/A
1339718,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003EYVXTG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Winter's Bone (Debra Granik, 2010)I watched Winter's Bone almost five months ago as I write the first words of this review. I have been trying to come up with something to say about it that does not somehow include far too many uses of the term ""wow"". I really haven't been doing a good job of it, so I just gave up trying. (Amusingly, it has now been another two months between the time I wrote those first three sentences and the time I am writing this fourth; I guess I hadn't stopped trying hard enough.) This is a movie of uncommon power and grace about people and situations who are uncommonly powerless and graceless, and that takes some doing indeed. Much of this, of course, is down to perfect casting; the film lists Kerry Barden and Paul Schnee as the casting directors in the credits, but as with Granik's previous film, Down to the Bone, I suspect she had a firmer hand in the casting than many directors do. In Down to the Bone, Granik chose as her female lead a young character actress who'd done mostly television work up to that point by the name of Vera Farmiga. The rest is history. Now, take that same story, replace the name of the film with Winter's Bone and the name of the actress with Jennifer Lawrence. Vera Farmiga has gone on to be a respected critical darling, and deservedly so; she makes every movie she is in better than it would otherwise be. Jennifer Lawrence has gone on to be a megastar in (as I write this) just three short years; she worked for scale ($3,000 a week) on Winter's Bone, and landed a cool ten million for Mockingjay. She's worth it, and every frame of film containing her in Winter's Bone attests to this.Plot: Ree (Lawrence) is a teenager in the rural Ozarks whose family has long been fractured; her father Jessup, a meth dealer, went missing a while back. Her mother is mentally challenged, which leaves Ree the putative head of the household, teaching her younger siblings survival skills and keeping what's left of the family together. They would have gone on like this indefinitely, most like, had not the county sheriff turned up on the family's doorstep one morning saying Jessup is due in court in a week's time. If he doesn't turn up, the family will lose their house, which Jessup put up as collateral last time he got out on bail. And thus, with the reluctant help of Jessup's slightly less dissolute brother Teardrop (Identity's John Hawkes), Ree embarks on a frustrating, and often dangerous, quest to determine the whereabouts of her father.The plot is good, the movie is perfectly-paced, and the closer that climax gets the more you know where this is going, but as with the best movies of this stripe, Granik teases you with the idea that ""nope, we're not gonna go there, and in the process we will save your sanity, your hope for the human race, and your kindness towards others."" Then she puts the goldfish bowl over your head and shatters it with a mallet, but that's all beside the point. So are the award-caliber performances turned in by any number of other actors in this movie, including Hawkes, Shelley Waggener (Punch-Drunk Love), Ronnie Hall (in his film debut), and Tate Taylor, best known these days as a director (The Help). All of those things are good, but all of them line up as a showcase for the fearsome acting talents of Jennifer Lawrence. Make no mistake: this movie is all about Ree, and Lawrence's performance never lets you forget that. Had it simply been her doing a reading of the character on a bare stage, with someone else feeding all the other characters' lines, I'm not sure it wouldn't have been just as powerful. She's that good here. Her choice of projects since hasn't been constantly good (viz. The House at the End of the Street), but, like Vera Farmiga, Jennifer Lawrence makes everything she appears in better than it would otherwise be. When she has a very good movie behind her, well, the result is something like Winter's Bone. This is one for the ages. ****",4,The Appalachian Mountain Daredevils.,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,3970,"['Winter', 'Bone', 'Debra', 'Granik', '2010', 'watched', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'almost', 'five', 'months', 'write', 'first', 'words', 'review', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'say', 'not', 'somehow', 'include', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'uses', 'term', 'wow', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'so', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'Amusingly', 'now', 'been', 'two', 'months', 'time', 'wrote', 'first', 'three', 'sentences', 'time', 'am', 'writing', 'fourth', 'guess', 'had', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'trying', 'hard', 'enough', 'movie', 'uncommon', 'power', 'grace', 'people', 'situations', 'who', 'are', 'uncommonly', 'powerless', 'graceless', 'doing', 'indeed', 'Much', 'course', 'down', 'perfect', 'casting', 'film', 'lists', 'Kerry', 'Barden', 'Paul', 'Schnee', 'casting', 'directors', 'credits', 'Granik', 'previous', 'film', 'Down', 'Bone', 'suspect', 'had', 'firmer', 'hand', 'casting', 'many', 'directors', 'do', 'Down', 'Bone', 'Granik', 'chose', 'female', 'lead', 'young', 'character', 'actress', 'who', ""'d"", 'done', 'mostly', 'television', 'work', 'up', 'point', 'name', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'rest', 'history', 'Now', 'take', 'same', 'story', 'replace', 'name', 'film', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'name', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'gone', 'be', 'respected', 'critical', 'darling', 'deservedly', 'so', 'movie', 'better', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'gone', 'be', 'megastar', 'write', 'just', 'three', 'short', 'years', 'worked', 'scale', '3,000', 'week', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'landed', 'cool', 'ten', 'million', 'Mockingjay', 'frame', 'film', 'containing', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'this.Plot', 'Ree', 'Lawrence', 'teenager', 'rural', 'Ozarks', 'family', 'long', 'been', 'fractured', 'father', 'Jessup', 'meth', 'dealer', 'went', 'missing', 'while', 'back', 'mother', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Ree', 'putative', 'head', 'household', 'teaching', 'younger', 'siblings', 'survival', 'skills', 'keeping', 'what', 'left', 'family', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'indefinitely', 'most', 'had', 'not', 'county', 'sheriff', 'turned', 'up', 'family', 'doorstep', 'one', 'morning', 'saying', 'Jessup', 'due', 'court', 'week', 'time', ""n't"", 'turn', 'up', 'family', 'will', 'lose', 'house', 'Jessup', 'put', 'up', 'collateral', 'last', 'time', 'got', 'out', 'bail', 'thus', 'reluctant', 'help', 'Jessup', 'slightly', 'less', 'dissolute', 'brother', 'Teardrop', 'Identity', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Ree', 'frustrating', 'often', 'dangerous', 'quest', 'determine', 'whereabouts', 'father.The', 'plot', 'good', 'movie', 'perfectly-paced', 'closer', 'more', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'best', 'movies', 'stripe', 'Granik', 'idea', 'nope', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'go', 'there', 'process', 'will', 'save', 'sanity', 'hope', 'human', 'race', 'kindness', 'others', 'Then', 'goldfish', 'bowl', 'head', 'shatters', 'mallet', 'point', 'are', 'award-caliber', 'performances', 'turned', 'number', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'including', 'Hawkes', 'Shelley', 'Waggener', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'Ronnie', 'Hall', 'film', 'debut', 'Tate', 'Taylor', 'best', 'known', 'days', 'director', 'Help', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'line', 'up', 'showcase', 'fearsome', 'acting', 'talents', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'Ree', 'Lawrence', 'performance', 'never', 'forget', 'Had', 'simply', 'been', 'doing', 'reading', 'character', 'bare', 'stage', 'someone', 'else', 'feeding', 'other', 'characters', 'lines', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'just', 'powerful', 'good', 'here', 'Her', 'choice', 'projects', ""n't"", 'been', 'constantly', 'good', 'viz', 'House', 'End', 'Street', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'everything', 'better', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'When', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'result', 'something', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'one', 'ages', '****']",N/A

Zwick,"[12, 16]","The milieu the characters of ""Winter's Bone"" inhabit is truly a world unto itself: a rural land where grinding poverty rules, where clannish ties run thick, where guns and hunting are an integral part of daily life, where acts of brutality and violence alternate with simple acts of charity and kindness, and where outsiders are viewed with suspicion and paranoia.In this richly atmospheric film of the Daniel Woodrell novel, Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a dilapidated shack with her mentally ill mother and a younger brother and sister, whom Ree is essentially raising.  When the sheriff comes to inform her that her father, who's been arrested for crank production, has put up the family's home and land as bail, Ree goes in desperate search of him to ensure that he doesn't skip out on his court date.  However, as the young woman journeys through the area seeking information as to his whereabouts, she finds herself involved in a situation fraught with far more mystery and danger than she could have imagined when she first set out.  All this leads to Ree having to decide between strictly adhering to the ""code of the hills"" - in which the ties of blood trump all else - or of violating it and doing what is right for herself and her immediate family.Writer/director Debra Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini immerse the audience so thoroughly in the Ozark setting that it takes us awhile to fully shake off the experience and to reorient ourselves to our own environment once the movie has ended.  It's a beautifully observed landscape of gnarled trees, car tires, chopped wood, rusted-out vehicles and hay bales, where the sounds of cattle lowing and coyotes howling compete with the twang of a banjo and country music songs playing mournfully on the radio.  Indeed, so cut off does this place seem from the outside world that many of the modern conveniences the rest of us take for granted - computers, cell phones, the internet - seem almost completely absent from the setting.In terms of storyline and drama, the filmmakers scrupulously avoid resorting to melodrama or clich&eacute;s to get their points across.  The events in the movie arise organically and naturally from the setting, and the understated performances add to the verisimilitude of the piece.  Lawrence carries the film with her insightful, dignified performance as Ree, a morally upright girl trying to do the right thing in a world almost totally devoid of resources and help.  Yet, it is Ree's determination to not give up and to try to make something decent out of her own life and the lives of her siblings that gives the film its overall tone of hope.Special note should also be taken of the stark, spare, haunting score by Dickon Hinchliffe that perfectly reflects the film's bleak and dreary background.""Winter's Bone"" is a harsh, unsparing film, but a memorable, mesmerizing experience all the same.",5,When setting becomes character,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,2919,"['milieu', 'characters', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'inhabit', 'truly', 'world', 'rural', 'land', 'where', 'grinding', 'poverty', 'rules', 'where', 'clannish', 'ties', 'run', 'thick', 'where', 'guns', 'hunting', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'daily', 'life', 'where', 'acts', 'brutality', 'violence', 'alternate', 'simple', 'acts', 'charity', 'kindness', 'where', 'outsiders', 'are', 'viewed', 'suspicion', 'paranoia.In', 'richly', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Woodrell', 'novel', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Ree', '17-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'dilapidated', 'shack', 'mentally', 'ill', 'mother', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'whom', 'Ree', 'essentially', 'raising', 'When', 'sheriff', 'inform', 'father', 'who', 'been', 'arrested', 'crank', 'production', 'put', 'up', 'family', 'home', 'land', 'bail', 'Ree', 'desperate', 'search', 'ensure', ""n't"", 'skip', 'out', 'court', 'date', 'However', 'young', 'woman', 'journeys', 'area', 'seeking', 'information', 'whereabouts', 'involved', 'situation', 'fraught', 'far', 'more', 'mystery', 'danger', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'when', 'first', 'set', 'out', 'Ree', 'having', 'decide', 'strictly', 'adhering', 'code', 'hills', 'ties', 'blood', 'trump', 'else', 'violating', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'herself', 'immediate', 'family.Writer/director', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'co-writer', 'Anne', 'Rosellini', 'audience', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'Ozark', 'setting', 'fully', 'shake', 'off', 'experience', 'reorient', 'own', 'environment', 'movie', 'ended', 'beautifully', 'observed', 'landscape', 'gnarled', 'trees', 'car', 'tires', 'chopped', 'wood', 'rusted-out', 'vehicles', 'hay', 'bales', 'where', 'sounds', 'cattle', 'lowing', 'coyotes', 'howling', 'compete', 'twang', 'banjo', 'country', 'music', 'songs', 'playing', 'mournfully', 'radio', 'Indeed', 'so', 'cut', 'off', 'place', 'seem', 'outside', 'world', 'many', 'modern', 'rest', 'take', 'granted', 'computers', 'cell', 'phones', 'internet', 'seem', 'almost', 'completely', 'absent', 'setting.In', 'terms', 'storyline', 'drama', 'filmmakers', 'scrupulously', 'avoid', 'resorting', 'melodrama', 'clich', 'eacute', 'get', 'points', 'events', 'movie', 'arise', 'organically', 'naturally', 'setting', 'understated', 'performances', 'add', 'verisimilitude', 'piece', 'Lawrence', 'film', 'insightful', 'dignified', 'performance', 'Ree', 'morally', 'upright', 'girl', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'world', 'almost', 'totally', 'devoid', 'resources', 'help', 'Ree', 'determination', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'try', 'make', 'something', 'decent', 'own', 'life', 'lives', 'siblings', 'film', 'overall', 'tone', 'hope.Special', 'note', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'taken', 'stark', 'spare', 'haunting', 'score', 'Dickon', 'Hinchliffe', 'perfectly', 'film', 'bleak', 'dreary', 'background', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'harsh', 'unsparing', 'film', 'memorable', 'mesmerizing', 'experience', 'same']",N/A

1339728,A387BD735MI50R,B003EYVXTG,R. Schultz,"[1, 3]","The jacket on this disc is misleading. The movie is characterized as a thriller and a mystery. It's neither. It's more of a Missouri Ozarks odyssey, with almost a documentary feel to it, vaguely reminiscent of John Sayles' ""Matewan."" However, this film isn't about miners. It' about ordinary mountain people and their struggle to survive.It reveals the seldom-explored lives of these people. However, far from this rural town being a benign and gently humorous Mayberry, this film reveals life in such mountain settings as being often difficult, decimated, and brutalized by the role that drug-dealing has come to play among the inhabitants as a way of sustaining themselves.The central character in this story is a 17-year-old girl who circulates among the distanced people of this enclave, looking for her father whom she suspects has been driven into hiding as a result of his ""cookin'"" - meaning his cooking of crystal meth. Meth seems to have taken the place of the more amusing moonshine that used to characterize mountain entrepreneurship. There's an urgency to the girl's search. Unless her father shows up for his court hearing, his bond will be forfeit and the girl and her family will lose their house, the one thing that secures them in place.This film is beautifully photographed. I especially appreciated seeing the strong, unvarnished women's faces that it features. These faces, allowed to be present without the concealments and erasures of botox or blush, tell the story of the hardships these women have suffered. They are intrinsically beautiful faces.The main failing of this film is that its plot doesn't make much sense. Perhaps something got lost in translation from the acclaimed book to the screen. The violence in the movie seems to be dragged in out of left field. It's as if the producers feared that a mere representation of a girl's quest for her father would be too boring. So they threw in some sudden, unmotivated mob violence against her. Why would her neighbors turn on her that way? Is it that they feared she would tell the town sheriff about their own complicity in the drug trade? Is it that they feared she would somehow betray the fierce loyalties that bind the people in this area? Maybe, but these hardly seem like adequate explanations for their threatening descent on her, like the villagers' descent on Dr. Frankenstein's castle with torches.Then the girl's reaction to the vicissitudes of her odyssey is a constant blank impassivity. Jennifer Lawrence registers neither fear nor fondness. So her character's courage ends up looking more like simple indifference. I don't know if this is due to bad acting or bad directing.But these flaws end up being relatively minor detractions from what is overall a beautiful, absorbing drama about the persistence of a rural refuge that few outsiders would otherwise get to visit.One final reason to get this DVD is the thread of traditional bluegrass music that runs through it, making up its score. It's a rare treat to hear raw, honest voices intoning these time-honored tunes in our age of generally over-produced, over-amplified video extravaganzas. Here music literally is brought back to its roots as a homespun, intimate activity - back to where the singer and the song are one. The entire expanded score for the film is available as a separate CD/record.",4,"Compelling, But Not a Mystery or a Thriller",1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,3349,"['jacket', 'disc', 'misleading', 'movie', 'characterized', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'more', 'Missouri', 'Ozarks', 'odyssey', 'almost', 'documentary', 'feel', 'vaguely', 'reminiscent', 'John', 'Sayles', 'Matewan', 'However', 'film', ""n't"", 'miners', 'ordinary', 'mountain', 'people', 'struggle', 'survive.It', 'reveals', 'seldom-explored', 'lives', 'people', 'However', 'far', 'rural', 'town', 'being', 'benign', 'gently', 'humorous', 'Mayberry', 'film', 'life', 'such', 'mountain', 'settings', 'being', 'often', 'difficult', 'decimated', 'brutalized', 'role', 'drug-dealing', 'come', 'play', 'inhabitants', 'way', 'sustaining', 'themselves.The', 'central', 'character', 'story', '17-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'distanced', 'people', 'enclave', 'looking', 'father', 'whom', 'been', 'driven', 'hiding', 'result', 'cookin', 'meaning', 'cooking', 'crystal', 'meth', 'Meth', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'more', 'amusing', 'moonshine', 'used', 'characterize', 'mountain', 'entrepreneurship', 'urgency', 'girl', 'search', 'father', 'up', 'court', 'hearing', 'bond', 'will', 'be', 'forfeit', 'girl', 'family', 'will', 'lose', 'house', 'one', 'thing', 'place.This', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'strong', 'unvarnished', 'women', 'allowed', 'be', 'present', 'concealments', 'erasures', 'botox', 'blush', 'tell', 'story', 'hardships', 'women', 'have', 'suffered', 'are', 'intrinsically', 'beautiful', 'faces.The', 'main', 'failing', 'film', 'plot', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'Perhaps', 'something', 'got', 'lost', 'translation', 'acclaimed', 'book', 'screen', 'violence', 'movie', 'be', 'dragged', 'out', 'left', 'field', 'producers', 'feared', 'mere', 'representation', 'girl', 'quest', 'father', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'boring', 'threw', 'sudden', 'unmotivated', 'mob', 'violence', 'Why', 'would', 'neighbors', 'turn', 'way', 'feared', 'would', 'tell', 'town', 'sheriff', 'own', 'complicity', 'drug', 'trade', 'feared', 'would', 'somehow', 'betray', 'fierce', 'loyalties', 'bind', 'people', 'area', 'Maybe', 'hardly', 'seem', 'adequate', 'explanations', 'threatening', 'descent', 'villagers', 'descent', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'castle', 'girl', 'reaction', 'vicissitudes', 'odyssey', 'constant', 'blank', 'impassivity', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'registers', 'fear', 'fondness', 'character', 'courage', 'up', 'looking', 'more', 'like', 'simple', 'indifference', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'due', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'directing.But', 'flaws', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'relatively', 'minor', 'detractions', 'what', 'overall', 'beautiful', 'absorbing', 'drama', 'persistence', 'rural', 'refuge', 'few', 'outsiders', 'would', 'otherwise', 'get', 'visit.One', 'final', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'thread', 'traditional', 'bluegrass', 'music', 'making', 'up', 'score', 'rare', 'treat', 'hear', 'raw', 'honest', 'voices', 'intoning', 'time-honored', 'tunes', 'age', 'generally', 'over-produced', 'over-amplified', 'video', 'extravaganzas', 'Here', 'music', 'literally', 'brought', 'back', 'roots', 'homespun', 'intimate', 'activity', 'back', 'where', 'singer', 'song', 'are', 'one', 'entire', 'expanded', 'score', 'film', 'available', 'separate', 'CD/record']",N/A

1339730,A6FIAB28IS79,B003EYVXTG,Samuel Chell,"[1, 11]","After high recommendations, I watched this film with a mixture of incredulity and disappointment.  John  Wayne saved ""True Grit"" for me, but even the controlled, memorable performance  of John Hawkes as the rough and inscrutable yet ultimately caring brother of the daddy being sought after by the young daughter-protagonist, Ree, can't rescue this film from its own excesses.Normally violent scenes of mid-life hillbilly families operating as blood-related (they ARE Southern country boys and girls after all) gangbangers would be the ideal material for that narrative sub-genre known as ""Southern Gothic,"" especially given the potential for black humor in the grotesque climactic scene in which a couple of conscience-stricken witches of the clan take Ree on an icy, night-time fishing expedition--equipped not with tackle but a power chain-saw and  in pursuit not of big ole catfish but the submerged hands of Ree's father--the evidence she requires to save her house and family.In this movie, the viewer has the impression that scenes like this, along with a family's ultra-violent beating of our heroine in distress (right out of ""The Lottery""), are played ""straight""--the menacing characters, hurt-inflicting ""set pieces,"" edited face-slaps, and scary camera angles served up, along with the detailed, candid glimpses of everyday life, merely to show us the way folks conduct themselves in the Ozark backwoods where moonshine distilleries have been replaced by stolid rustics cooking methamphetamine (and driving Caddies) along with ""Mafia-justice"" country-style.  (Wordsworth would be appalled.)  The filmmakers appear clueless to the enormous potential of this material to show the viewer so much more.Other Southern storytellers--Dickey (""Deliverance""), McCarthy (""That Is No Country for Old Men""), above all, Flannery O'Connor (not to mention Welty, Williams, Capote and Faulkner)--go much MORE ""over the top"" than this movie.  But for them every detail is integral with, or essential to, the careful construction of an epiphany in which the reader/viewer finally is led to a shocking, indelible moment of life-changing self-recognition.  Such revelatory moments, or ""epiphanies,"" James Joyce insisted, are the most significant, distinguishing feature of narrative art worthy of the name.In response to a student's question about a seemingly exclusive preference for movies made before 1990, I could respond: In the new millennium I've seen 2 outstanding, life-changing films: ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""That Is No Country for Old Men"" (from the brothers who brought Southern Gothic black comedy to northern Minnesota comes a movie guaranteed to make you think twice before spending another precious moment in a theater).  After films like these, a viewer becomes perhaps overly astringent in his demands of a great film.  (I almost envy those who insist that a film must simply ""entertain"" and not present the challenges of a Blake-like visionary artist.) There are no real epiphanies offered the spectator of this formulaic, ""True Grit meets Blood Simple,"" pastoral aberration. In the rite-of-passage skeletal plot, even Ree's coming of age is of little interest--she's plenty tough, savvy, initiated into the business of growing up and raising a family among white-trash neighbors-on-meth from the very beginning.  Eventually, she learns to place a little more trust in the bad guys who, after all, are her kin (notwithstanding they knocked off her snitching dad, a meth cooker who was at heart a good guy too).  We, in turn, learn to stay away from movies as full of cliches, character stereotypes, and unmotivated, pointless melodrama as this one.  Or, if like the filmmakers we become enamored of the undeniable fascination of some of the more realistic, detailed vignettes of these curious country folk and the stoic but connected life they share (mostly through song), we learn that one visit is enough.",3,"True Grit Meets Texas Chain Saw Massacre (but there's no ""Good Man Is Hard to Find"")",1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,3921,"['high', 'recommendations', 'watched', 'film', 'mixture', 'incredulity', 'disappointment', 'John', 'Wayne', 'saved', 'True', 'Grit', 'even', 'controlled', 'memorable', 'performance', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'rough', 'inscrutable', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'caring', 'brother', 'daddy', 'being', 'sought', 'young', 'daughter-protagonist', 'Ree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'film', 'own', 'excesses.Normally', 'violent', 'scenes', 'mid-life', 'hillbilly', 'families', 'operating', 'blood-related', 'ARE', 'Southern', 'country', 'boys', 'girls', 'gangbangers', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'material', 'narrative', 'sub-genre', 'known', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'especially', 'given', 'potential', 'black', 'humor', 'grotesque', 'climactic', 'scene', 'couple', 'conscience-stricken', 'witches', 'clan', 'take', 'Ree', 'icy', 'night-time', 'fishing', 'expedition', 'equipped', 'not', 'tackle', 'power', 'chain-saw', 'pursuit', 'not', 'big', 'ole', 'catfish', 'submerged', 'hands', 'Ree', 'father', 'evidence', 'save', 'house', 'family.In', 'movie', 'viewer', 'impression', 'family', 'ultra-violent', 'beating', 'heroine', 'distress', 'right', 'Lottery', 'are', 'played', 'straight', 'menacing', 'characters', 'hurt-inflicting', 'set', 'pieces', 'edited', 'face-slaps', 'scary', 'camera', 'angles', 'served', 'up', 'detailed', 'candid', 'glimpses', 'everyday', 'life', 'merely', 'show', 'way', 'folks', 'conduct', 'Ozark', 'backwoods', 'where', 'moonshine', 'distilleries', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'stolid', 'rustics', 'cooking', 'methamphetamine', 'driving', 'Caddies', 'Mafia-justice', 'country-style', 'Wordsworth', 'would', 'be', 'appalled', 'filmmakers', 'appear', 'clueless', 'enormous', 'potential', 'material', 'show', 'viewer', 'so', 'much', 'more.Other', 'Southern', 'storytellers', 'Dickey', 'Deliverance', 'McCarthy', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Flannery', ""O'Connor"", 'not', 'mention', 'Welty', 'Williams', 'Capote', 'Faulkner', 'go', 'much', 'MORE', 'top', 'movie', 'detail', 'integral', 'essential', 'careful', 'construction', 'epiphany', 'reader/viewer', 'finally', 'led', 'shocking', 'indelible', 'moment', 'life-changing', 'self-recognition', 'Such', 'revelatory', 'moments', 'epiphanies', 'James', 'Joyce', 'insisted', 'are', 'most', 'significant', 'distinguishing', 'feature', 'narrative', 'art', 'worthy', 'name.In', 'response', 'student', 'question', 'seemingly', 'exclusive', 'preference', 'movies', 'made', '1990', 'could', 'respond', 'new', 'millennium', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2', 'outstanding', 'life-changing', 'films', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'brothers', 'who', 'brought', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'black', 'comedy', 'northern', 'Minnesota', 'movie', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'spending', 'precious', 'moment', 'theater', 'films', 'viewer', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'astringent', 'demands', 'great', 'film', 'almost', 'envy', 'who', 'insist', 'film', 'must', 'simply', 'entertain', 'not', 'present', 'challenges', 'Blake-like', 'visionary', 'artist', 'are', 'real', 'epiphanies', 'offered', 'spectator', 'formulaic', 'True', 'Grit', 'meets', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'pastoral', 'aberration', 'rite-of-passage', 'skeletal', 'plot', 'even', 'Ree', 'coming', 'age', 'little', 'interest', 'plenty', 'tough', 'savvy', 'initiated', 'business', 'growing', 'up', 'raising', 'family', 'white-trash', 'neighbors-on-meth', 'very', 'beginning', 'Eventually', 'place', 'little', 'more', 'trust', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'kin', 'notwithstanding', 'knocked', 'off', 'snitching', 'dad', 'meth', 'cooker', 'who', 'was', 'heart', 'good', 'guy', 'too', 'turn', 'learn', 'stay', 'away', 'movies', 'full', 'cliches', 'character', 'stereotypes', 'unmotivated', 'pointless', 'melodrama', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'become', 'enamored', 'undeniable', 'fascination', 'more', 'realistic', 'detailed', 'vignettes', 'curious', 'country', 'folk', 'stoic', 'connected', 'life', 'share', 'mostly', 'song', 'learn', 'one', 'visit', 'enough']",N/A

You are no longer a casual spectator, you are there.  The setting wraps itself around you so strongly, you can almost identify the smells. Your heart will pound; a tear may fall. With some scenes you may feel the need to peek through your fingers, or to look away, but you're suddenly in too deep.  There's no going back!  You begin to realize that you are an outsider voyeuristically intruding on an often forgotten subculture; one with roots back to the 19th century; one that still makes its own rules; one where death is just a fact of life; one where illegal activities and brutality are the accepted code. You are mesmerized, and horrified at the same time. You feel like you are trespassing into a secret world, so close to all of us, yet so far away.Having spent some time in the Appalachians, hearing countless survival stories, I can attest that from Appalachia, westward, through the Ozarks, that the clans may change, but many rural mountain folk share the same demons of poverty, inferior education, health care and often pitiful living conditions.  Much of this is a self-fulfilling prophesy, as the mountain people generally do not like outside intrusions, and, as witnessed in this film, sometimes they don't even trust their own.  This was so authentically depicted in Winter's Bone, where survival overpowers loyalty.Your heart will break, as you witness 17 year old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) attempt to hold her family together.  She has two younger siblings depending on her, and a mother who has disengaged from her surroundings almost to the point of catatonia.  When Ree's dad goes missing, jumping bail, she begins the fight of her life to save their farmland.  She spirals deep into the 'old boys' illegal activities---cooking methamphetamine.  Secrets abound, threats erupt, and several of her own kin turn on her.  You will cry with Ree; you will cheer with Ree. There is no setback, short of death, that will keep her from her mission to save her family.  Her courage represents the best qualities of the mountain people, often seen in their spirited, women---those trying to avoid the strong hand of their predominately patriarchal culture.I watched this film a month ago, and I keep ruminating about it.  To me, this is the sign of a stellar production---one that stays with you, makes you think, and dares to remove you from your comfort zone.

Her neighbors and relatives offer her some help, but when Ree starts questioning the members of the small community about her father's whereabouts she is faced with a wall of lies and secrecy.Independent filmmaker Debra Granik's second feature film, after her directorial debut ""Down to the Bone"" (2004), is an adaptation of a Daniel Woodrell novel with the same name from 2006, and gives a realistic depiction of an American highland community where the residents are scared to silence by an extensive underworld of illegal met-amphetamine labs. With a camera that tracks every move the main character makes and a persuasive linear narrative, Debra Granik has created a thrilling and unpredictable social crime drama with a lurking atmosphere and a credible story co-written by Anne Rosellini. The overall acting is good and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Lawrence who previously appeared in Guillermo Arriaga's ""The Burning Plain"" (2008) is exceptional in her second lead role as a young woman struggling to save her family from being victimized by her father's criminal actions.

1339741,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B003EYVXTG,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","[In what follows I try to avoid ""spoilers"" and as a result don't give a very detailed account of the story.  Trust me that the narrative lines are clear!]A good story, well-acted, and economically told -- though I have a few reservations that keep it out of the 5-star range.  First, it is so beautifully shot that it makes the desolated backwoods of southern Missouri seem glamorous.  Maybe we're meant to feel the contrast between the beauty of the compositions and the desperateness of the lives, but when the broken-down houses and trailers look beautiful, things have gone too far.  I recently saw ""Mean Streets,"" and Scorsese resisted the temptation (if he ever felt it) to glamorize the setting.  Second, there's an undertow of sentimentality to the story that makes it finally less compelling than, say, ""True Grit,"" another movie about a resourceful young woman seeking to find out what happened to her father and having help from a less-than-perfect adult male.  That sentimentality isn't a matter of Jennifer Lawrence's character Ree's being very courageous and resourceful -- there's nothing wrong with that.  But her two younger siblings are picture-book adorable, and when her meth-addicted uncle presents them with baby chicks at the end of the movie, one feels that the hopefulness that the end of the narrative has signaled has been rather too heavily underlined.On the positive side, though, the script is good -- the characters are credibly (given their circumstances) reticent, and the working out of the plot avoids cliche and comes to an effective climax that is both gruesome and moving.  The characters too all seem to have a bit more depth than either their speech or actions reveal.  They are capable of surprising us, with acts of kindness and brutality, and the movie catches very well the sense of constriction of their lives, even in the rural setting: we soon pick up the limited geography of the place, as Ree tries to get her neighbors and relatives to reveal information about her father, a cooker of methamphetamine, who has dodged bail and thus threatened the property of his family, which he put up as collateral against a court appearance.  It's good too that the movie allows us to infer the connection between meth cooking and drug addiction, on the one hand, and obvious economic distress on the other, without having to spell it out for us in a preachy way.  The director trusts the audience there, as she did not with those baby chicks!The acting is fine.  I think this was the movie that brought Jennifer Lawrence to prominence, and she does a fine, understated job here.  The temptation is to make the character seem implausibly virtuous, and she avoids that, bringing a range of emotion to bear that convinces us that she is more than just a pasteboard exemplar of what's good.  John Hawkes is fine too, as the uncle who overcomes his reluctance to help her.  The action makes clear that it is Ree's persistence that wins over reluctant people to help her, even when the help is pretty minimal.  The women in the movie are particularly interesting, never posing any threat to the secretive, desperate men they live with, and yet always suggesting a sense of distance from these men and the worst that they do.  Well worth a look, then -- and you can pick it up pretty cheap even on Blu-ray.",4,true grit 2? certainly worth seeing,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,3336,"['[', 'what', 'try', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'detailed', 'account', 'story', 'Trust', 'narrative', 'lines', 'are', 'clear', ']', 'good', 'story', 'well-acted', 'economically', 'told', 'have', 'few', 'reservations', 'keep', '5-star', 'range', 'First', 'so', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'desolated', 'backwoods', 'southern', 'Missouri', 'seem', 'glamorous', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'meant', 'feel', 'contrast', 'beauty', 'compositions', 'desperateness', 'lives', 'when', 'broken-down', 'houses', 'trailers', 'look', 'beautiful', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'recently', 'saw', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Scorsese', 'resisted', 'temptation', 'ever', 'felt', 'glamorize', 'setting', 'Second', 'undertow', 'sentimentality', 'story', 'finally', 'less', 'compelling', 'say', 'True', 'Grit', 'movie', 'resourceful', 'young', 'woman', 'seeking', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'father', 'having', 'help', 'less-than-perfect', 'adult', 'male', 'sentimentality', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'character', 'Ree', 'being', 'very', 'courageous', 'resourceful', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'are', 'picture-book', 'adorable', 'when', 'meth-addicted', 'uncle', 'baby', 'chicks', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'feels', 'hopefulness', 'end', 'narrative', 'signaled', 'been', 'rather', 'too', 'heavily', 'positive', 'side', 'though', 'script', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'credibly', 'given', 'circumstances', 'reticent', 'working', 'plot', 'avoids', 'cliche', 'effective', 'climax', 'gruesome', 'moving', 'characters', 'too', 'seem', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'speech', 'actions', 'reveal', 'are', 'capable', 'surprising', 'acts', 'kindness', 'brutality', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'sense', 'constriction', 'lives', 'even', 'rural', 'setting', 'soon', 'pick', 'up', 'limited', 'geography', 'place', 'Ree', 'get', 'neighbors', 'relatives', 'reveal', 'information', 'father', 'cooker', 'methamphetamine', 'who', 'dodged', 'bail', 'thus', 'threatened', 'property', 'family', 'put', 'up', 'collateral', 'court', 'appearance', 'good', 'too', 'movie', 'infer', 'connection', 'meth', 'cooking', 'drug', 'addiction', 'one', 'hand', 'obvious', 'economic', 'distress', 'other', 'having', 'spell', 'out', 'preachy', 'way', 'director', 'audience', 'there', 'did', 'not', 'baby', 'chicks', 'acting', 'fine', 'think', 'was', 'movie', 'brought', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'prominence', 'fine', 'understated', 'job', 'here', 'temptation', 'make', 'character', 'seem', 'implausibly', 'virtuous', 'bringing', 'range', 'emotion', 'bear', 'convinces', 'more', 'just', 'pasteboard', 'exemplar', 'what', 'good', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'fine', 'too', 'uncle', 'who', 'reluctance', 'help', 'action', 'clear', 'Ree', 'persistence', 'over', 'reluctant', 'people', 'help', 'even', 'when', 'help', 'pretty', 'minimal', 'women', 'movie', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'never', 'posing', 'threat', 'secretive', 'desperate', 'men', 'live', 'yet', 'always', 'suggesting', 'sense', 'distance', 'men', 'worst', 'do', 'Well', 'look', 'then', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'even', 'Blu-ray']",N/A

It finally made it to Cherrydale Cinemas this week, and I have to say that all of the hype surrounding this film is justified. It is one of the best films of the year.It concerns a young girl, Ree Dolly, who lives deep within the Ozark Mountains. Day after day, she single-handedly takes care of her younger brother and sister, as well as her ill mother. On many occasions, she has to hunt for food in order to be able to feed her family. Ever so often, the neighbors help by giving the family leftovers from the night before. It is clear that this family is struggling, and that Ree is doing all that she can to provide.When the sheriff shows up at her doorstep and informs her that her father, a fugitive and a crystal meth dealer, has put her house up for bail bond, she has to race against all odds to find him. Everything is at stake, and so Ree sets out on a dangerous journey in order to save her family. From the time that Ree begins her journey into darkness until the shocking finale, we are driven to the edge of our seats. Not once will you take your eyes off of the screen. There are times when you want to look away, but you can't and you won't.The strength of this film lies in its authenticity. Most of the time, you feels as if you are watching a documentary feature, peering into the lives of these people. Everything from the performances, to the setting, to the minimalist score provides an eerie realism to the final product.Newcomer Jennifer Lawrence plays the part of Ree Dolly, and I should tell you that this performance is going to make her a star, possibly earn her a few nominations at awards ceremonies. She shows a confidence that many actresses lack these days. I'd put her in the same category as Ellen Page. It's a magical thing when the audience forgets that they are simply watching a performance. Ree becomes real to us because of Jennifer Lawrence's abilities as an actress.The same has to be said for the rest of the cast. I'm not sure how many of the actors had any experience prior to making this film, but they all shine in their respective roles. The direction from Debra Granik is simple and to the point. That's not to say that it lacks elegance, it only adds to the neo-realist vibe that the film sends out. The score is minimal, yet haunting. The cinematography is breathtaking. The cast and crew take us places that we have never been before to tell us a story that we will never forget.The film was adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell.",5,Best of 2010 Series: WINTER'S BONE,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,2629,"['year', 'winner', 'coveted', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'little', 'indie', 'called', 'WINTER', 'BONE', 'finally', 'made', 'Cherrydale', 'Cinemas', 'week', 'have', 'say', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'justified', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year.It', 'young', 'girl', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'who', 'deep', 'Ozark', 'Mountains', 'Day', 'day', 'single-handedly', 'care', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'as', 'well', 'ill', 'mother', 'many', 'occasions', 'hunt', 'food', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'feed', 'family', 'Ever', 'so', 'often', 'neighbors', 'help', 'giving', 'family', 'leftovers', 'night', 'clear', 'family', 'struggling', 'Ree', 'doing', 'can', 'provide.When', 'sheriff', 'up', 'doorstep', 'father', 'fugitive', 'crystal', 'meth', 'dealer', 'put', 'house', 'up', 'bail', 'bond', 'race', 'odds', 'find', 'Everything', 'stake', 'so', 'Ree', 'out', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'order', 'save', 'family', 'time', 'Ree', 'journey', 'darkness', 'shocking', 'finale', 'are', 'driven', 'edge', 'seats', 'Not', 'once', 'will', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'want', 'look', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", ""won't.The"", 'strength', 'film', 'authenticity', 'Most', 'time', 'feels', 'are', 'watching', 'documentary', 'feature', 'peering', 'lives', 'people', 'Everything', 'performances', 'setting', 'minimalist', 'score', 'eerie', 'realism', 'final', 'product.Newcomer', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'part', 'Ree', 'Dolly', 'should', 'tell', 'performance', 'going', 'make', 'star', 'possibly', 'earn', 'few', 'nominations', 'awards', 'ceremonies', 'confidence', 'many', 'actresses', 'lack', 'days', ""'d"", 'put', 'same', 'category', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'magical', 'thing', 'when', 'audience', 'are', 'simply', 'watching', 'performance', 'Ree', 'real', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'abilities', 'actress.The', 'same', 'be', 'said', 'rest', 'cast', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'actors', 'had', 'experience', 'prior', 'making', 'film', 'shine', 'respective', 'roles', 'direction', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'simple', 'point', 'not', 'say', 'elegance', 'only', 'neo-realist', 'vibe', 'film', 'out', 'score', 'minimal', 'yet', 'haunting', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'cast', 'crew', 'take', 'places', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'tell', 'story', 'will', 'never', 'forget.The', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Daniel', 'Woodrell']",N/A
1339748,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B003EYVXTG,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","If you're a fan of Jennifer Lawrence after seeing The Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook, you might be interested in seeing the film that put her on the map. She gained a Best Actress nomination for her performance in Winter's Bone, and after seeing it for the second time, I have come to the conclusion that it may be a better performance than her 2013 Oscar-winning effort. I say that because of the demands of the role, and not because anything was lacking in her Oscar-winning performance.Winter's Bone is an incredibly bleak story. Ree Dolly (Lawrence) is 17, and her very existence is a challenge. Her father is missing and about to stand trial for manufacturing crystal meth. Unfortunately, he put up their house as collateral for his bail, and it will be taken from her within a week if he fails to show up. Ree's mother rarely talks and is incapable of taking care of her and her young brother and sister. As a result, Ree is responsible for the entire family.In order to resolve her situation, she must find her father. There's also the chance that he's dead, and she would have to prove it to the authorities if that turned out to be the case. So, Ree sets off to discover the truth. The story takes place in the Ozarks, and everyone she questions is aggressive, dangerous, guarded, or a combination of all three. It's risky to even pursue her investigation with some of those she encounters also mixed up in the illegal drug trade.If you thought Lawrence was plucky in The Hunger Games, you'll be amazed by the things she has to deal with in Winter's Bone. This world is real, and director Debra Granik doesn't pull any punches. The result is a tense thriller, but it's not an action movie. The tension is more in the style of Hitchcock because we know that Ree is in danger the whole time.The other outstanding performance in the film comes from John Hawkes as Teardrop. He doesn't say much, but his character oozes menace every time he appears. He also earned an Oscar nomination, and it's hard to argue with that decision. If you saw him as Mark in The Sessions, you might find it difficult to believe that Teardrop is played by the same actor.Lawrence is off to a strong start with two Oscar nominations and a win by the age of 22.

But this film is a story about a 17 year old girl Ree Dolly in the Ozarks in Missouri played by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence who is really leads her family including younger brother Sonny and sister Ashlee. Her mother doesn't speak and suffers from mental illness where it leaves Ree on her own. When the Sherriff (played by Raising Hope's Garret Dillahunt) stops by looking for her father, he informs Ree that they could lose the property if he doesn't show up in court because he's on bond. Ree sets out to find him.In her journey in the Ozark winters, you see her determination to save her family and land. There is something that we don't see in films and that is poverty, drug addiction, and rural America. Ree wants a better life for her family and herself. She considers enlisting in the army in order to get money but learns it may not be her best choice. She is surrounded by tough-talking men and women with regards to her father's whereabouts. One of them is Dale Dickey who plays ""Merab Milton."" She might be a newcomer to the acting world but she shines here reminding you of Melissa Leo in some ways. Most of the cast appear to all be newcomers except for Sheryl Lee (Twin Peaks) who has a small role here. Jennifer Lawrence has a bright future in acting if she can deliver an Academy Award nominated performance in a small budget film.The DVD will show a 45 minutes behind the making of the film and the support from the locals in Forsyth, Tane and Christian Counties in Missouri. In one of the film's deleted scenes, Ree spends time in the cave where she reflects on her past relationship with her father. There is some folk music sung in the film.

1339757,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B003EYVXTG,The Guardian,"[9, 12]","`Winter's Bone', co-written and directed by Debra Granik, is a bleak and downbeat story of the marginalised underclass of dirt-poor rural white people in the Ozark Mountains; a welcome dose of realism in contrast to the usual fare of vacuous, glossy and lavish-budget Hollywood escapism/action movies. It's an uncompromising film with a simple plot line and features an astounding performance from the young Jennifer Lawrence as the female lead. You are likely to wake up the next day still thinking about this film, and its haunting images may linger long in memory.I know the Ozarks in NW Arkansas and southern Missouri, and the film's social detail is exactly right. This is a side of America rarely featured in film: life lived in the raw by an isolated population in the backwoods, predominantly unemployed/self-sufficient and semi-destitute, the wreckage of broken-down old cars and appliances rusting in the yards of tumbledown shacks barely fit for habitation; subsistence living far from a complex urban consumer-society in which they have no stake. There is no non-white tokenism in the film's cast, so in this detail it's also uncompromisingly true to life. These folks live by an ancient code of blood ties, extended family bonds and militant non-co-operation with the law; illegal `cooking' of and addiction to life-wrecking methamphetamine - known as `crank' - is common. Another realistic detail is that no-one in the film has a cellphone or a computer or can even aspire to owning one: those everyday gadgets of the global consumer-matrix are as alien in this environment as they might be to someone in the 16th century. The most hi-tech life ever gets out here is a rusty old pick-up truck, a chain-saw and a gun.Lawrence plays Ree Dolly, a 17-year old forced to grow up fast and take on the role of the only responsible adult in the rural shack they call home. Ree cares for her catatonic, mentally incapable mother and her younger brother and sister. She is told her estranged father, arrested for distilling crank, put up the family shack as a bail bond and subsequently disappeared: if he doesn't turn up for his court date, the family shack will be forfeit and Ree and her siblings ""...be thrown out into the fields, to live like dogs"" - bleak indeed.The film's simple, slow-paced plot principally involves Ree searching for her father, to find out if he's alive or dead and so save the family home (if she can prove he's dead, the bail will be annulled). In her search she demonstrates patience, resilience and determination and is in turn met by hostility, non-co-operation and eventually physical violence from the scattered community whose code of honor is that ""ya don't ask no questions, and ya don't never tell."" Her quiet and principled persistence eventually wins over some unlikely allies, and there is a resolution of sorts but hardly a `happy ending.'The film has many poignant and harrowing scenes, but Lawrence's performance throughout is truly outstanding and utterly convincing (she was raised in Tennessee in a similar rural environment to that portrayed in the film). The cast are mostly unknowns and portray to perfection the kind of people you'd cross the street to avoid and never, ever pick a fight with - the women as well as the men. There is no humor in the film, but the serious tone throughout is somehow right for the sombre subject matter. You will utterly, completely believe in the characters and in the story: in style it's more like documentary than fictional drama, with a welcome absence of melodrama and no attempt to emotionally manipulate the audience. So if it's lightweight entertainment and laughs you're after, you better steer clear of this film.`Winter's Bone' has received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for (though didn't win) a number of 2011 Academy Awards, and picked up both the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Films and the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The soundtrack is also excellent: genuine Ozark musicians playing mountain music on banjo and guitar. The film is very, very good, and I only drop it from 5 stars due to its rather bleak storyline and slightly less than satisfying (though not unbelievable) denouement. If you appreciate good, serious, quality film making you should definitely see it.",4,Life down to the bone in the Ozarks: gritty realism from Debra Granik's film with a star performance from Jennifer Lawrence,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,4328,"['Winter', 'Bone', 'co-written', 'directed', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'bleak', 'downbeat', 'story', 'marginalised', 'underclass', 'dirt-poor', 'rural', 'white', 'people', 'Ozark', 'Mountains', 'welcome', 'dose', 'realism', 'contrast', 'usual', 'fare', 'vacuous', 'glossy', 'lavish-budget', 'Hollywood', 'escapism/action', 'movies', 'uncompromising', 'film', 'simple', 'plot', 'line', 'features', 'astounding', 'performance', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'female', 'lead', 'are', 'likely', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'still', 'thinking', 'film', 'haunting', 'images', 'may', 'linger', 'long', 'memory.I', 'know', 'Ozarks', 'NW', 'Arkansas', 'southern', 'Missouri', 'film', 'social', 'detail', 'exactly', 'right', 'side', 'America', 'rarely', 'featured', 'film', 'life', 'lived', 'raw', 'isolated', 'population', 'backwoods', 'predominantly', 'unemployed/self-sufficient', 'semi-destitute', 'wreckage', 'broken-down', 'old', 'cars', 'appliances', 'rusting', 'yards', 'tumbledown', 'shacks', 'barely', 'fit', 'habitation', 'subsistence', 'living', 'far', 'complex', 'urban', 'consumer-society', 'have', 'stake', 'non-white', 'tokenism', 'film', 'cast', 'so', 'detail', 'also', 'uncompromisingly', 'true', 'life', 'folks', 'live', 'ancient', 'code', 'blood', 'ties', 'extended', 'family', 'bonds', 'militant', 'non-co-operation', 'law', 'illegal', 'cooking', 'addiction', 'life-wrecking', 'methamphetamine', 'known', 'crank', 'common', 'realistic', 'detail', 'no-one', 'film', 'cellphone', 'computer', 'can', 'even', 'aspire', 'owning', 'one', 'everyday', 'gadgets', 'global', 'consumer-matrix', 'are', 'alien', 'environment', 'might', 'be', 'someone', '16th', 'century', 'most', 'hi-tech', 'life', 'ever', 'out', 'here', 'rusty', 'old', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'chain-saw', 'gun.Lawrence', 'Ree', 'Dolly', '17-year', 'old', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'fast', 'take', 'role', 'only', 'responsible', 'adult', 'rural', 'shack', 'call', 'home', 'Ree', 'catatonic', 'mentally', 'incapable', 'mother', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'told', 'estranged', 'father', 'arrested', 'distilling', 'crank', 'put', 'up', 'family', 'shack', 'bail', 'bond', 'subsequently', 'disappeared', ""n't"", 'turn', 'up', 'court', 'date', 'family', 'shack', 'will', 'be', 'forfeit', 'Ree', 'siblings', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'fields', 'live', 'dogs', 'bleak', 'indeed.The', 'film', 'simple', 'slow-paced', 'plot', 'principally', 'Ree', 'searching', 'father', 'find', 'out', 'alive', 'dead', 'so', 'save', 'family', 'home', 'can', 'prove', 'dead', 'bail', 'will', 'be', 'annulled', 'search', 'patience', 'resilience', 'determination', 'turn', 'met', 'hostility', 'non-co-operation', 'eventually', 'physical', 'violence', 'scattered', 'community', 'code', 'honor', 'ya', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'questions', 'ya', 'do', ""n't"", 'never', 'tell', 'quiet', 'principled', 'persistence', 'eventually', 'unlikely', 'allies', 'resolution', 'sorts', 'hardly', 'happy', 'ending', ""'The"", 'film', 'many', 'poignant', 'harrowing', 'scenes', 'Lawrence', 'performance', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'was', 'raised', 'Tennessee', 'similar', 'rural', 'environment', 'portrayed', 'film', 'cast', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'portray', 'perfection', 'kind', 'people', ""'d"", 'cross', 'street', 'avoid', 'never', 'ever', 'pick', 'fight', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'humor', 'film', 'serious', 'tone', 'somehow', 'right', 'sombre', 'subject', 'matter', 'will', 'utterly', 'completely', 'believe', 'characters', 'story', 'style', 'more', 'documentary', 'fictional', 'drama', 'welcome', 'absence', 'melodrama', 'attempt', 'emotionally', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'So', 'lightweight', 'entertainment', ""'re"", 'better', 'steer', 'clear', 'film.', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'received', 'widespread', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'was', 'nominated', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'number', '2011', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'picked', 'up', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Dramatic', 'Films', 'Waldo', 'Salt', 'Screenwriting', 'Award', '2010', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'excellent', 'genuine', 'Ozark', 'musicians', 'playing', 'mountain', 'music', 'banjo', 'guitar', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'drop', '5', 'stars', 'due', 'rather', 'bleak', 'storyline', 'slightly', 'less', 'satisfying', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'denouement', 'appreciate', 'good', 'serious', 'quality', 'film', 'making', 'should', 'definitely', 'see']",N/A

Ree Holly (Jennifer Lawrence) is at home taking care of her mother, who takes happy pills and is menatlly out of it. She also cares for her two siblings. She is 17. She goes to school and chops wood too. Clarence Carter's ""Patches"" lived in a dream world compared to her. Her father is missing and it appears he will miss bail. The family farm has been put up for bond. Ree searches for her father, who made and sold Meth.The movie is shot on location in Southern Missouri, Jesse James country. It captures impoverished rural America. The accents are remarkably well done and not overdone like so many films. Jennifer Lawrence gives us an Academy Award performance. The movie also captures the independent spirit of the people, their general disdain of law enforcement, and their willingness to help each other in a time of crisis, in spite of a certain code of silence.Like many small isolated communities, most folk are somehow kin. Ree uses the kin card to elicit help. Her uncle, who refused to help her, eventually does so after Ree displays bravery and persistence. Remarkable performances by the entire cast, including the child actors. There are no super heroes walking tall or high action scenes.

1339760,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B003EYVXTG,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[5, 12]","This movie was recommended by a friend of mine.  She told me, not long after watching this movie that I needed to see it so she could have my take on it.  I must confess it took me a while to finally see it.  Notwithstanding, I finally rented the movie and this is review is an ode to her...The plot of this film is rather simple, yet compelling, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17 year old girl who lives with her younger brother and sister and her catatonic mother.  Her father is supposed to be at trial in a week and since he has bonded the home for his release from jail, it is imperative he appears.  In contrast, Jessup (the father) hasn't been seen in quite some time.  So now it is up to Ree to find her father in order to save her family's home.  Under the assumption that this scenario isn't interesting enough, Jessup is known for being a ""cooker"" which is a code word for an alchemist in making methamphetamines.This leads Ree on a rather interesting odyssey through the rural, poverty stricken Ozarks.  During this misadventure ""we the viewers"" meet many characters along the way.  Ree is able to form a bittersweet bond with her estranged uncle, her father's brother, who goes by the name Teardrop.  This title is manly due to the fact he has a tattoo under his eye.  I am going to end plot description and details here, for a person who wants to know more, stop reading my review and watch the movie.I believe I missed the boat on this motion picture.  I found it to be almost painful to watch. The film was unbelievably slow, watching Ree walk around and keeps asking people where her father was became very old, very fast.  The first forty minutes or so that is all that happened.  The characters were flat and numb.  I realize that is the filmmakers' intention to exploit, in a manner of speaking, the culture of people living in this part of America.  The methamphetamine angle was really nothing more than a red herring, which is too bad because this area would have been a nice place to explore.""Winter's Bone"" is labeled and promoted as ""thriller"".  I would go out on a limb and depict it as an edgy drama at best; there isn't anything thrilling about this movie.  I don't need non-stop action, most of the films I like need time to brew, and this film left me with a flat feeling.  In contrast, I need to give credit to the acting.  Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job.  She is nominated for an Oscar, as is John Hawkes who plays Teardrop.  This leaves me feeling a bit ambivalent, while I didn't really care about any of the characters in the movie; I felt the performances were gritty and realistic. Another positive was some of the principal photography, establishing shots and landscapes of the Ozarks were captured with a haunting beauty.Despite of nice cinematography and good acting, I found this movie to be a let down.  The pace was too languid, the sequences of events was also very tedious, which left me hoping the movie would just end. I reached a point where I honestly didn't care if the story was resolved.  Nevertheless, my opinion appears to be in the minority since this movie has been nominated for an Academy Award and has received a great deal of critical praise.  I am scratching my head, but this is coming from the same guy who is still bemused that Judi Dench won an Oscar for an ""Shakespeare in Love"" when she was only on the screen for five minutes.",2,Winter Bore,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,3399,"['movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'not', 'long', 'watching', 'movie', 'needed', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'take', 'must', 'confess', 'took', 'while', 'finally', 'see', 'Notwithstanding', 'finally', 'rented', 'movie', 'review', 'ode', 'plot', 'film', 'rather', 'simple', 'yet', 'compelling', 'Ree', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', '17', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'younger', 'brother', 'sister', 'catatonic', 'mother', 'father', 'supposed', 'be', 'trial', 'week', 'bonded', 'home', 'release', 'jail', 'imperative', 'contrast', 'Jessup', 'father', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'So', 'now', 'Ree', 'find', 'father', 'order', 'save', 'family', 'home', 'assumption', 'scenario', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'Jessup', 'known', 'being', 'cooker', 'code', 'word', 'alchemist', 'making', 'methamphetamines.This', 'leads', 'Ree', 'rather', 'interesting', 'odyssey', 'rural', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'Ozarks', 'misadventure', 'viewers', 'meet', 'many', 'characters', 'way', 'Ree', 'able', 'form', 'bittersweet', 'bond', 'estranged', 'uncle', 'father', 'brother', 'who', 'name', 'Teardrop', 'title', 'manly', 'due', 'fact', 'tattoo', 'eye', 'am', 'going', 'end', 'plot', 'description', 'details', 'here', 'person', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'watch', 'movie.I', 'believe', 'missed', 'boat', 'motion', 'picture', 'found', 'be', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'slow', 'watching', 'Ree', 'walk', 'keeps', 'asking', 'people', 'where', 'father', 'was', 'became', 'very', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'so', 'happened', 'characters', 'were', 'flat', 'numb', 'realize', 'filmmakers', 'intention', 'exploit', 'manner', 'speaking', 'culture', 'people', 'living', 'part', 'America', 'methamphetamine', 'angle', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'red', 'herring', 'too', 'bad', 'area', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'place', 'explore', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'labeled', 'promoted', 'thriller', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'depict', 'edgy', 'drama', 'best', ""n't"", 'anything', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'non-stop', 'action', 'most', 'films', 'like', 'need', 'time', 'brew', 'film', 'left', 'flat', 'feeling', 'contrast', 'need', 'give', 'credit', 'acting', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'Teardrop', 'feeling', 'bit', 'ambivalent', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'movie', 'felt', 'performances', 'were', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'positive', 'was', 'principal', 'photography', 'establishing', 'shots', 'landscapes', 'Ozarks', 'were', 'captured', 'haunting', 'beauty.Despite', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'good', 'acting', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'pace', 'was', 'too', 'languid', 'sequences', 'events', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'tedious', 'left', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'just', 'end', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'was', 'resolved', 'Nevertheless', 'opinion', 'be', 'minority', 'movie', 'been', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'received', 'great', 'deal', 'critical', 'praise', 'am', 'scratching', 'head', 'coming', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'still', 'bemused', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'screen', 'five', 'minutes']",N/A

1339766,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003EYVXTG,Turfseer,"[15, 31]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Wikipedia informs us that the classic 'hillbilly' stereotype began during the Great Depression. The image was one of ""the poor, ignorant, feuding family with a huge brood of children tending the family moonshine still."" Filmed in the Ozark Mountains, 'Winter's Bone' continues to advance the same stereotype--this time however, the 'hillbillies' are not making moonshine but rather cooking up the more deadly brew of methamphetamine.When we're first introduced to the film's protagonist, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), she's taking care of her almost catatonic mother and two much younger siblings. The family is so destitute that at one point they shoot squirrels and eat them. One wonders why no social services agency becomes involved with this family. After all, the local sheriff is quite familiar with the family's situation--that Ree, a 17 year old minor, is caring for the younger siblings and the mother is a virtual basket case. Wouldn't the sheriff have been obligated to report the family situation to social services so they could be placed in foster care? After all, if something happens to those kids and law enforcement was found to know about it, they could be held liable along with the county for not calling in various helpful authorities.The inciting incident occurs early on when a bail bondsman informs Ree that she has a week to find her meth-selling father who has used the family home as collateral to be released on bond. Ree seeks help from various relatives including 'Teardrop', her uncle, who at first wants nothing to do with finding brother Jessup, Ree's dad. Teardrop's strategy is to intimidate his niece, so that she won't get into trouble when the meth dealers get upset over her snooping around trying to find her father. It's established early on that people in town are scared of Uncle Teardrop due to his deep-seated anger management problem (Teardrop likes to smash car windows and refuses to get out of his own vehicle when ordered by the police).Ree eventually contacts other members of the community who she is supposedly distantly related to. One of these men is Thump who heads a group of meth-dealing bad guys.  He gets the word out that Ree should not be snooping around but she won't listen.  Because of the hillbilly code, he ends up sending the womenfolk to beat Ree up. Finally Teardrop levels with Ree, explaining that her father was killed because he was an informer. I had a hard time believing that Thump and his men didn't kill Ree outright as she was doing all that snooping around. You would think that meth dealers wouldn't give a hoot about some old hillbilly code about not hurting a woman. And then despite the fact that they outnumber Teardrop, Thump and his men somehow accept his word that Ree won't snitch. Unlikely. And then they capitulate and send the womenfolk to cut off Ree's father's hand, as proof that he's dead. And here his daughter accepts that? The point I guess is that people are so intimidated by meth dealers, that their spirit is completely crushed. So Ree makes a 'deal with the devil' in order to save the family. You've got to assume that law enforcement is so totally corrupt that they look the other way in every case. Here, Ree assumes the police know about what's happening and will take no action. So there's not one good person in law enforcement who might try to do something? So they're all completely intimidated and ineffectual? No higher authorities become involved in cases like these?Sure there are cases where people are intimidated and refuse to cooperate with law enforcement. But if everyone did that, the vast majority of criminals would get away with their crimes. So you have to buy this whole scenario and I have trouble doing that.The problem with 'Winter's Bone' is that most of the hillbillies are creepy, malevolent figures, reminiscent of some of the unpleasant characters in the film 'Deliverance'. Ree comes off as hardly heroic, refusing to rat out her father's killers in a desperate bid to save her family.  It's understandable but nothing to cheer about.  Similarly, we're asked to sympathize with Teardrop too as he's saved his niece from the clutches of murderers--but he too is complicit in his brother's murder.'Winter's Bone' was directed by Debra Granik, a Columbia film professor. She is to be admired for using some local talent during the filming and does a fine job in getting good work out of her director of photography and editors. Nonetheless, her big mistake was deciding to adapt the source material, a novel which apparently promotes the idea that there is a community in the Ozarks who are completely unlikeable and have little or no redeeming qualities, due to their association with the methamphetamine trade. Even if we accept the idea that there is an underclass of such people, how about humanizing those characters by giving them some kind of personality, instead of depicting them as suffering from a terminal case of uncontrollable hostility?",2,Meth replaces Moonshine in this updated tale of hillbilly stereotypes,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,5023,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers',

Unfortunately, my opinion is on the ""5-10%"" side of the fence for this mumble festival.  I honestly haven't seen a critically-cheered movie this tepid since the late 90's when ""Michael"" came out (remember John Travolta as a modern ""devil may care"" angel who comes to earth to help out a group of traveling nobodies?  Oh...the horror...the horror...).As others have mentioned, the cinematography is very good.  As a person who grew up in upstate NY (yes, rednecks DO live all 50 states), I found the beautiful scenes of the outdoors, contrasted by the dark, trailer-trash lifestyle of the characters to be quite realistic.  This gives the movie a 2nd-star for me.However, that's where the good stuff ends.BIG PROBLEM #1:  The movie is slow.Very slow.  Slow as molasses in January.  Slower than that elderly couple in the passing lane - doing 48 with the turn blinker left on for the past 22 miles.  Yes, a good tale takes time to spin - as a fan of Martin Scorsese's epics, I understand this and appreciate a well plotted story-line.  But this?  This is like watching for shooting stars on an overcast night: you're staring at the same background with little noticeable change.BIG PROBLEM #2:  The mumbling.I get it - the main character is meek, but strong.  In order to get the meek part across, the director has her speaking so low that she is practically unintelligible.  The same goes for the vast majority of conversations throughout the movie - making it difficult to understand what the heck is going on.  If the director wants to be ""authentic"" with barely understandable dialogue, why not make it a silent film with subtitles?Conclusion - the movie is plodding, the character interplay is incoherent, and so my overall rating is 2 bones out of 5.

1339777,AP3B615GM191G,B003EYVXTG,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","After Jennifer Lawrence's absolute explosion into super-stardom over the past couple of years, I wanted to go back and see the movie that gave her a start.  While I was expecting great things, I was disappointed by how bleak the proceedings were.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Winter's Bone&#34; is set in the deepest reaches of the Ozark Mountains, where everyone is related to another in some form, crystal meth is the business of choice, and the law even stays out of the way.  When the father of 17-year old Ree (Lawrence) does not make his bail and sets up his family to lose their house, Ree must venture into the most dangerous families in the mountains to locate him.Perhaps the biggest overall problem with this movie is that you almost need to have subtitles on to understand the dialogue (and I'm not hard of hearing whatsoever).  Besides Ree, everyone else either mumbles or talks in such a back-woods accent that it makes it very difficult to navigate many scenes.  For example, Teardrop (John Hawkes) has a key scene at one point with Ree, and it took me a couple of tries to fully understand what is going on.Another shortcoming is the fact that no one really gets to emote in this film besides Lawrence.  I know this is supposed to be a bleak movie, but I still believe that films need to give the audience some sort of overt dramatic material to really care about.  &#34;People just living their lives&#34; is supposed to be enough to carry this flick, but for me it isn't.About the only redeeming value of this movie for me was how it shows the life of some people in the Ozark Mountains.  Much like a more-recent &#34;Out of the Furnance&#34;, it is interesting (eye-opening?) to see that there are communities who create their own kind of law and justice.Thus, while I can see why this film rocketed Lawrence the individual to stardom, the overall film itself is no classic.  Even in what are supposed to be its most dramatic moments, it failed to really suck me into the story or make me care one way or the other.",2,Too Bleak (Even Though I Know That Is The Point),1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,2035,"['Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'absolute', 'explosion', 'super-stardom', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'movie', 'gave', 'start', 'was', 'expecting', 'great', 'things', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'bleak', 'proceedings', 'were.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Winter', 'Bone', '34', 'set', 'deepest', 'reaches', 'Ozark', 'Mountains', 'where', 'everyone', 'related', 'form', 'crystal', 'meth', 'business', 'choice', 'law', 'even', 'way', 'When', 'father', '17-year', 'old', 'Ree', 'Lawrence', 'not', 'make', 'bail', 'up', 'family', 'lose', 'house', 'Ree', 'must', 'venture', 'most', 'dangerous', 'families', 'mountains', 'locate', 'biggest', 'overall', 'problem', 'movie', 'almost', 'need', 'have', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'not', 'hard', 'hearing', 'whatsoever', 'Ree', 'everyone', 'else', 'mumbles', 'talks', 'such', 'back-woods', 'accent', 'very', 'difficult', 'navigate', 'many', 'scenes', 'example', 'Teardrop', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'key', 'scene', 'one', 'point', 'Ree', 'took', 'couple', 'tries', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'on.Another', 'shortcoming', 'fact', 'one', 'really', 'emote', 'film', 'Lawrence', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'bleak', 'movie', 'still', 'believe', 'films', 'need', 'give', 'audience', 'sort', 'overt', 'dramatic', 'material', 'really', 'care', '34', 'People', 'just', 'living', 'lives', '34', 'supposed', 'be', 'enough', 'carry', 'flick', 'only', 'redeeming', 'value', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'life', 'people', 'Ozark', 'Mountains', 'Much', 'more-recent', '34', 'Out', 'Furnance', '34', 'interesting', 'eye-opening', 'see', 'are', 'communities', 'who', 'create', 'own', 'kind', 'law', 'justice.Thus', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'rocketed', 'Lawrence', 'individual', 'stardom', 'overall', 'film', 'classic', 'Even', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'failed', 'really', 'suck', 'story', 'make', 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other']",N/A

Set in the rural Ozarks in southwestern Missouri, the story centers around 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in an amazing performance)who struggles to keep her family afloat in desperate circumstances. Ree's father Jessup is on the run from the law, having skipped bond, and has left Ree to care for her mentally ill mother as well as a younger brother and sister who are too young to fend for themselves. This is the least of Ree's problems however. The family home has been placed as collateral for Jessup's bond and if he does not turn up for the court appearance, Ree will lose everything.Driven to desperation, Ree decides to risk her own safety and track her father down (she calls it ""hunting"" in the movie). This proves to be a great challenge, and most of the movie actually focuses on Ree's attempts to get her neighbors and kin to reveal her father's whereabouts. This includes a taciturn uncle with a cruel streak, Teardrop (John Hawkes in a haunting performance). The fact that Ree's father was a ""cooker"" who cooked meth, and that this appears to be an important means of making money for the community which is portrayed in this film, makes things even more dangerous. There appears to be some sort of code of silence surrounding Jessup's whereabouts and fate, and the harder Ree pushes, the more walls she comes up against. The impenetrable veil of silence attests to the strong bonds within the community even when one of their own may lose everything.The movie is a harsh coming-of-age tale as the main character Ree plods through life with stoic determination, refusing to yield even when the situation appears hopeless. Jennifer Lawrence portrays her role with a high level of credibility, with her haunted eyes, and grim appearance. This is a difficult movie to sit through - there is hardly any light-hearted moments, even the scenes of Ree's younger siblings playing around some hay bales is portrayed in grayish and bleak hues. The effect of meth on some of the inhabitants in this region is shown through the gaunt appearances and the undertones of tension and barely suppressed anger/violence.The cinematography is achingly beautiful, so at odds with the grim portrayal of life in these parts. The music is amazing, and perfectly captures the spirit of a paradoxical community - one which sticks close together yet can also turn on each other.
