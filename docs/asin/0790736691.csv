That being said, children will enjoy Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers because once again good conquers evil.The makeup department did an excellent job getting the characters to look real and believable. The costume department did a wonderful job fitting the clothing to the character's personalities and the era of the film. Which I've learned makes a huge impact on kids these days.But what will really get the kids acting out scenes is when Sarah, the weapons specialist enters the halo-weapons system. Sarah enters a room that allows her to see all around the ship. With a few kicks from her feet and a few punches of her hands (directly into mid air), she is able to shoot missles at the offending ships.Overall, Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers wasn't a bad film for the average movie watcher, but for die-hard sci-fi fans, things could've been better.",3,The Series Is Much Better,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,1014,"['Babylon', '5', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'B-budget', 'movie', 'such', 'movies', 'lack', 'funds', 'quality', 'scenes', 'being', 'said', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Babylon', '5', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'once', 'again', 'good', 'conquers', 'evil.The', 'makeup', 'department', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'getting', 'characters', 'look', 'real', 'believable', 'costume', 'department', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'fitting', 'clothing', 'character', 'personalities', 'era', 'film', 'Which', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'huge', 'impact', 'kids', 'days.But', 'what', 'will', 'really', 'get', 'kids', 'acting', 'out', 'scenes', 'when', 'Sarah', 'weapons', 'specialist', 'halo-weapons', 'system', 'Sarah', 'room', 'see', 'ship', 'few', 'kicks', 'feet', 'few', 'punches', 'hands', 'directly', 'mid', 'air', 'able', 'shoot', 'missles', 'offending', 'ships.Overall', 'Babylon', '5', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'average', 'movie', 'watcher', 'die-hard', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'things', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better']",N/A

However, I was able to purchase it on Amazon Instant Video for the low price of $7.99!This film was one of several that could have taken place during the fifth season in that it was separate but continuous with the parent series in that The Station was one of the story locations and I had a chance to see the B5 regulars meet at least one of the future ""Crusade"" regulars (the scene where Zack convinced Dureena to ""check in her weapons"" was comedic gold!) while only Sheridan and Dureena met Galen. I also got to see another ""familiar Crusade face"" in a different role. While seeing her as a nameless character in this movie and later as a named regular character was a little confusing, I could understand Mr. Stracynski's casting decision. Good fictional characters can be well-written with a little luck and a lot of experience but compelling actors and actresses are very rare finds indeed!While I had to remind myself why this story and the one that came after it existed, the ending came as a complete shock as I watched and it served as a reminder of the topsy-turvy but predictive (as opposed to predictable) genius that is JMS.

Crusade was destroyed by TV network stupidity, not by the creator's vision or a lackluster script--a subject that I go into in my review of that box set.)I'm not sure who's at fault in The Legend of the Rangers, but this doesn't work very well as a standalone movie. If you love the universe already, you're going to watch this no matter what I tell you (and it's definitely worth seeing _once_). But if you're trying to catch up to learn what the shouting is all about... cast your eyes aside. This isn't the best of what the Babylon5 universe has to offer.It's important to remember that this was a pilot, so there's a lot more exposition than in an ordinary movie. The characters stand around with an uncomfortable amount of conversation in the ""As you know, this is What Has Gone Before,"" and make rather bald statements meant to convey ""This is my role in the show; don't you think I should keep the part?"" That makes any storytelling awkward -- a rule that applied equally well to the original Babylon 5 pilot, which had something like 18 characters to introduce in a 90-minute show. The Legend of the Rangers doesn't have quite as long a casting call, but it somehow (and not very smoothly) has to bring you up to date on the whole B5 history, and introduce the bad guys who our crew will be battling with, presumably, throughout the proposed Season One.The only character in the movie to bridge between old-and-new B5 stories is (the late, sigh) Andreas Katsulas as J'kar, who at this point has spent several years on his own universe walkabout. The movie switches from ""okay"" to ""darn, this is good after all"" in nearly every one of his scenes.Despite my criticism of the storyline, I think this might have made a good TV show. The premise of the rangers is still a very cool one -- spacefaring knights of the round table -- and we all do like to watch the ""captain with an attitude, who somehow engenders incredible loyalty among his crew."" (A bad guy says, ""A ranger wouldn't kill me."" ""Yeah, well, I've been having disciplinary problems lately,"" replies the ship captain.) If it had been approved, I would have given it a chance.Bottom line: worth watching once. Maybe twice.",3,It might have been a good series.

Several reviewers have explained the plot, so I won't repeat everything.The concept of space travel mixed with medieval knighthood chivalry (honor, courtesy, mutual respect, etc) is pleasant. However, the movie's Ranger Code of ""never retreating from a fight"" is downright stupid and extremely inefficient, especially for such a small force suffering from a lack of available starships.In the opening scenes of this movie, Ranger David Martell is serving as second in command aboard a starship, called the Enfalli, chasing raiders preying on alliance shipping lanes. When the raiders counterattack with a large force, the starship Enfalli is severely damaged and several crew members, including the captain, are killed. David assumes command and, with injured crew members and no weapons remaining to fight with, decides to retreat.When he returns to the homeworld of the Minbari (home of the Rangers), David is charged with violating the Ranger Code (of never retreating) and is threatened with expulsion. Ambassador G'Kar of the original Babylon 5 series, under instructions from the Alliance president, intercedes. David is given command of an outdated, haunted, starship called the Liandra, with his first task to escort a larger starship carrying a group of delegates, including ambassador G'Kar, to an undisclosed location. The two starships are attacked by unknown forces and, after the delegates are jettisoned using escape pods, the larger starship destroyed. The Liandra, damaged and with minimal weapons capability, retrieves the delegates and heads for home, chased by the attacking starships. The rest of the movie focuses on that trip home while evading the attackers.The addition of ambassador G'Kar (played by the late Andreas Katsulas), along with a quick visit to B5 towards the end of the movie, provides a fairly decent link to the original Babylon 5 series.By the way, ANYONE GOOD WITH TRIVIA? In the scene just after the starship Liandra enters the asteroid trail, who is the unknown crew member with bleached blond hair, beige shirt, and dark vest? He wasn't in the earlier scene where the Liandra's crew members introduced themselves (doesn't appear to be a ghost either), yet he can be seen in the background at several additional points in the movie.",5,Certainly Far Worse Movies Out There,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,2470,"['one', 'can', 'get', 'wacky', 'martial', 'arts-like', 'weapons', 'control', 'system', 'haunted', 'starship', 'complete', 'ghosts', 'movie', 'Babylon', '5', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'explained', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'everything.The', 'concept', 'space', 'travel', 'mixed', 'medieval', 'knighthood', 'chivalry', 'honor', 'courtesy', 'mutual', 'respect', 'etc', 'pleasant', 'However', 'movie', 'Ranger', 'Code', 'never', 'retreating', 'fight', 'downright', 'stupid', 'extremely', 'inefficient', 'especially', 'such', 'small', 'force', 'suffering', 'lack', 'available', 'starships.In', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Ranger', 'David', 'Martell', 'serving', 'second', 'command', 'starship', 'called', 'Enfalli', 'chasing', 'raiders', 'preying', 'alliance', 'shipping', 'lanes', 'When', 'raiders', 'counterattack', 'large', 'force', 'starship', 'Enfalli', 'severely', 'damaged', 'several', 'crew', 'members', 'including', 'captain', 'are', 'killed', 'David', 'command', 'injured', 'crew', 'members', 'weapons', 'remaining', 'fight', 'decides', 'retreat.When', 'homeworld', 'Minbari', 'home', 'Rangers', 'David', 'charged', 'violating', 'Ranger', 'Code', 'never', 'retreating', 'threatened', 'expulsion', 'Ambassador', ""G'Kar"", 'original', 'Babylon', '5', 'series', 'instructions', 'Alliance', 'president', 'intercedes', 'David', 'given', 'command', 'outdated', 'haunted', 'starship', 'called', 'Liandra', 'first', 'task', 'escort', 'larger', 'starship', 'carrying', 'group', 'delegates', 'including', 'ambassador', ""G'Kar"", 'undisclosed', 'location', 'two', 'starships', 'are', 'attacked', 'unknown', 'forces', 'delegates', 'are', 'jettisoned', 'using', 'escape', 'pods', 'larger', 'starship', 'destroyed', 'Liandra', 'damaged', 'minimal', 'weapons', 'capability', 'delegates', 'heads', 'home', 'chased', 'attacking', 'starships', 'rest', 'movie', 'trip', 'home', 'evading', 'attackers.The', 'addition', 'ambassador', ""G'Kar"", 'played', 'late', 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', 'quick', 'visit', 'B5', 'end', 'movie', 'fairly', 'decent', 'link', 'original', 'Babylon', '5', 'series.By', 'way', 'ANYONE', 'GOOD', 'WITH', 'TRIVIA', 'scene', 'just', 'starship', 'Liandra', 'asteroid', 'trail', 'who', 'unknown', 'crew', 'member', 'bleached', 'blond', 'hair', 'beige', 'shirt', 'dark', 'vest', 'was', ""n't"", 'earlier', 'scene', 'where', 'Liandra', 'crew', 'members', 'introduced', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'ghost', 'yet', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'background', 'several', 'additional', 'points', 'movie']",N/A

The story I thought was going to be told was not the story I saw.Frankly, I really had no idea what the thrust of the story was going to be, but since this was more a ""pilot"" from which more stories could be culled and more history could be chronicled, perhaps I would have liked it more had it actually had a run, like Crusade, the follow on series after B5 concluded, picking up the storyline and going with that to find the cure for the plague.I couldn't get vested in the characters, as they were left a little two dimensional, perhaps to be fleshed out had this become a series.Well, you see the trend in my report... it was a one off and no series materialised, so we got what we got, a little snapshot into the making of a handful of Rangers at one stage in their ""development"" or growth or training. But the production values were the standard for B5 universe stories; and the story, taken by itself, is not a bad one either. At least JMS is consistent -- and that does make this worthwhile in that sense.Was it a waste of time? No, not really. But it does lack in the depth of character and the immediacy elements.

I have yet to see anything on &quot;Star Trek&quot; which remotely comes close to the grandeur and broad canvass of J. Michael Straczynski's epic tale. Although I recommend viewing this film after seeing the first three seasons of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, newcomers to &quot;Babylon 5&quot; will not be left in the dark, watching this drama of miss opportunities, tragic errors, and the unrelenting, brutal war which ensues between the Minbari and humanity. Theodore Bikel is splendid as Lenonn, the leader of the Rangers. Ditto for Raynor Scheine as Dukhat, the Minbari leader of its Grey Council. And so are series regulars Bruce Boxleitner (Sheridan), Richard Biggs (Dr. Franklin), Mira Furlan (Delenn), Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar), and of course, Peter Jurasik (Mollari), in their respective roles. And in his few brief moments on screen, Michael O'Hare is quite good as Sinclair, revealing how his character will play a momentuous role in the subsequent history of Babylon 5.

105796,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,0790736691,Jon Norris,"[1, 1]","I was a fan of Babylon 5 from the very beginning. As a hardcore Amiga fan, I supported the series at first because the Amiga and Video Toaster/Lightwave made it possible. As the show ""found its legs,"" it cemented itself firmly in place as one of the best Sci-fi series ever.It is pretty obvious that this was an attempt to create a spin-off from the original series, like Crusade. Unfortunately, Crusade and this show both suffered from some problems which held them back.I like the Bab 5 universe, and feel that it is ripe for a run as good as the Star Trek franchise. The problem is writing. As much as I like MJS, I think the writing in his shows can be somewhat uneven.For example, in this movie, there are some great lines, usually delivered by G'Kar (as noted, Andreas Katsulas was an incredible actor who could elevate a shopping list to high art). On the other hand, some of the lines were kind of ""60s sitcom"" in their style and sophistication level. I think they would have played just fine up against the original Star Trek series, which suffered similar unevenness. Audiences have evolved in sophistication since then, however.While I, too think that the Ranger's attitude of ""no retreat"" is tactically insane, it is also just the kind of thing which could develop in an ""inbred"" elite, and similar short-sightedness has been witnessed in real cultures. I think that G'Kar deals with that whole issue nicely in one of the Council scenes, and it is a necessary plot device for the unfolding of the story.I also agree that  the ""virtual reality"" weapons system as shown is problematic. While technically not necessarily a bad idea, the execution was pretty unsophisticated, although we also have to remember that our understanding of such things as an audience have also moved forward since this was originally aired. Check out the Leap Motion device being used to play Fruit Ninja, and you will see that the concept could actually work quite well. People with highly trained reflexes (as in martial artists) can move exceptionally fast without conscious thought, and combining that with the independent limb action of a good drummer, the concept is quite reasonable for a manual weapons system. Also, such an interface would allow a wide variety of people to use the weapons, even with minimal training (as in an emergency).On balance, I still liked the movie, and wish MJS had been able to take it to a full series like Bab 5. We will never know how well it would have turned out. It is unfortunate that so much of the future and quality of entertainment is in the hands of bankers and other such types.

105802,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0790736691,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","I just started watching &quot;Babylon 5&quot; from the beginning, which means that I get to watch this 1998 television movie prequel from a different vantage point from those fans who watched the science fiction series from the beginning.  Which means that what little I had heard or seen about the series distorted my perceptions a bit since I and did not understand the relative importance of Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) versus  John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) during the first couple of seasons of the show.  The primary purpose of this prequel is to tell the story of the Earth-Minbari War that took place about a decade before &quot;The Gathering,&quot; the two-part &quot;movie&quot; that starts off the series.&quot;In the Beginning&quot; starts off on Centauri Prime, where outside the royal palace the city is burning. A young boy and girl intrude upon Emperor Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik), who gives the boy an opportunity to issue one order. &quot;Make it good,&quot; the old man advises, and the boy does, saying, &quot;Tell me a story!&quot; The Emperor does, going back to the start of the Third Age. This would be the year 2243, when a young Londo arrived at the Earth Dome as liaison to the Centauri delegation. Earth had recently won the Dilgar War and the government of Earth is now expanding its sphere of influence. Earth is having some success in its attempt to make treaties with the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, and now Earth is sending an expedition to make contact with the mysterious Minbari. Londo advises General Lefcourt to send only one ship and to be wary of the Minbari, but, of course, the military of Earth is nothing if not arrogant. Even not knowing the &quot;history&quot; of the series, it was clear that when Londo mumbles something about Earth not waking up the dragon it foreshadows hard times for Earth. Any and all doubts disappear when Lt. Cmdr. John Sheridan (Boxleitner) shows up and calls Captain Jankowski, the leader of the expedition, &quot;a loose canon.&quot;Before the Earth ships reach Mindari space we learn something about the warrior caste of these people and Lenonn, the leader of the Anla'shok (the Rangers). Lenonn is worried about the prophecies of Balen, which indicate that a time of crisis is coming during which the Anla'shok will play an important role. We also hear about the Vorlons for the first time. Then Captain Jankowski shows up and despite having been warned not to make first contact (which begs all sorts of questions about why this particular captain was sent with a fleet on an intelligence gathering mission) gets close enough for the Mindari to engage their senses. This begins a chain of events with tragic consequences, as both Jankowski and the Mindari prove equally adept at having no understanding of cross-cultural communication.The importance of this exchange is that this little encounter is the spark that ignites the Earth-Mindari war, and the importance of that war is that the forces of Earth are no match for the Mindari. It is ironic to watch &quot;In the Beginning&quot; today, a year after the war with Iraq, because it is hard not to see strong parallels between the one sided wars. The great strength of this story is the idea that there is nothing Earth can do to stop the Mindari from destroying the Earth and ending the human race, a far cry from the superiority of the species that is a constant in the vast majority of science fiction (e.g., the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.The problem is that just as the cause for the war was a bit far fetched (one of the first things you learn in encountering another culture is that symbols do not mean the same thing; e.g., do not hitch hike in central Africa because that gesture is their version of flipping somebody off), so is the end of the war, where a convenient bit of information pretty much pops out of nowhere. Still, on balance, there is a clear sense that in the universe of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; that humanity is occupying one of the lower rungs on the intergalactic totem pole, which is a decidedly different premise from what we are used to in the realm of science fiction series.  Those of us who start the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; experience at this point also get to watch those first season episodes knowing all about the &quot;hole&quot; in Commander Sinclair's mind.Ironically, while &quot;In the Beginning&quot; does a nice job of filling in the back story of the Earth-Mindari war, it also raises a new series of questions with regards to how we get from the end of this prequel to the start of the official &quot;Babylon 5&quot; series.  It might be just me but I think the Minbari should be a bit more proactive in their relationship with the humans given the big surprise of this storyline.  If it is big enougth to suddenly bring a war to a screeching halt, then it should lead to something more substantial in the diplomatic realm as well.",5,The official &quot;prequel&quot; to the saga of

In addition, Dulann should have been Captain hands down while Martell should have been washing dishes or mopping the floor/deck.2) In the plot in which they (his superiors and the Grey Council) made an issue of Martell's leaving the battle when he had no weapons to fight with was simply absurd.3) The enemy ships' tactics were moronic: The 2 enemy ships decided to leave the scene without finishing the job confident that the third one was more than enough.  Why??? And why the hurry anyway?Moreover, the second sophisticated enemy ship did not check for life signs (!) or explosives (!) and took the bait... after that the third sophisticated enemy ship did scan for life signs, but not for explosives such as grenades!  Give us a break!4) Have the Rangers been reduced to the point that there are no White Stars left and top dignitaries travel on ""space bricks"" escorted by 20-year-old junk, and all that without explanation?  The Valen was pathetic as far as ships go, while the Liandra was worse yet, and the Intestellar Alliance's top diplomats/representatives had to endure travel on these ships.  The year is 2264, so it's less than two years since Sheridan and Delenn left Babylon 5 for Minbar.  What in Valen's name happened???5) The alien crewmembers, except the Drazi, were rather interesting and quite promising, but the humans were just bad.Tirk, the Drazi, looks like the big orange fella from Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four.  Kit did not even look Japanese, the guy with the disguises belonged on a different show, not B5, while the girl/gunner was just sad...6) As much as Andreas Katsulas/G'kar tried, Dylan Neal was definitely a poor choice at best for Captain Martell.7) With so much as stake, they could have had Delenn or Sheridan (or even Vir or Lochley) along with G'kar.Overall, the story/plot is a good one (with the haunting being an attention-grabbing twist), the special effects are naturally better (technology has progressed), the dialogues were way below average (those responsible should be subjected to corporal punishment), the music was all right (though nothing compared to past scores), while the acting needs a lot of work as the cast carry out their performances rather poorly (one can tell that they are a bit uneasy), however, that is the usually case with most series in the beginning.  In short, The Legend of the Rangers is missing that B5 feel, and that pretty much says it all.  Please bring back Babylon 5!  You owe it to the fans!",3,I had no idea that Rangers cursed so much...,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,3573,"['Legend', 'Rangers', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'hope', 'was', 'successful', 'Babylon', '5', 'series', 'means', 'terrible', 'movie.The', 'year', '2264', 'young', 'Ranger', 'captain', 'discipline', 'problems', 'God', 'why', 'was', 'necessary', 'assigned', 'command', '20-year-old', 'derelict', 'ship', 'Liandra', 'ordered', 'escort', 'Valen-class', 'ship', 'carrying', 'number', 'Interstellar', 'Alliance', 'dignitaries', 'secret', 'location', 'When', 'two', 'ships', 'are', 'ambushed', 'three', 'unidentified', 'craft', 'Rangers', 'realize', 'great', 'evil', 'brewing', 'one', 'could', 'overshadow', 'Shadows', 'major', 'setbacks', 'are', 'relation', 'to:1', 'Captain', 'David', 'Martell', 'who', 'too', 'young', 'too', 'arrogant', 'too', 'obnoxious', 'be', 'likable', 'Moreover', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'anger', 'money', 'midst', 'crisis', 'Am', 'missing', 'something', 'here', 'anything', 'Ranger', 'let', 'alone', 'Ranger', 'captain', 'Tannier', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'acceptable/appropriate', 'Ranger', 'captain', 'Martell', 'proved', 'doubt', 'addition', 'Dulann', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Captain', 'hands', 'down', 'Martell', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'washing', 'dishes', 'mopping', 'floor/deck.2', 'plot', 'superiors', 'Grey', 'Council', 'made', 'issue', 'Martell', 'leaving', 'battle', 'when', 'had', 'weapons', 'fight', 'was', 'simply', 'absurd.3', 'enemy', 'ships', 'tactics', 'were', 'moronic', '2', 'enemy', 'ships', 'decided', 'leave', 'scene', 'finishing', 'job', 'confident', 'third', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'Why', 'why', 'hurry', 'anyway', 'Moreover', 'second', 'sophisticated', 'enemy', 'ship', 'did', 'not', 'check', 'life', 'signs', 'took', 'bait', 'third', 'sophisticated', 'enemy', 'ship', 'did', 'scan', 'life', 'signs', 'not', 'explosives', 'such', 'grenades', 'Give', 'break', '4', 'Have', 'Rangers', 'been', 'reduced', 'point', 'are', 'White', 'Stars', 'left', 'top', 'dignitaries', 'travel', 'space', 'bricks', 'escorted', '20-year-old', 'junk', 'explanation', 'Valen', 'was', 'pathetic', 'as', 'far', 'ships', 'go', 'Liandra', 'was', 'worse', 'yet', 'Intestellar', 'Alliance', 'top', 'diplomats/representatives', 'had', 'endure', 'travel', 'ships', 'year', '2264', 'less', 'two', 'years', 'Sheridan', 'Delenn', 'left', 'Babylon', '5', 'Minbar', 'What', 'Valen', 'name', 'happened', '5', 'alien', 'crewmembers', 'Drazi', 'were', 'rather', 'interesting', 'quite', 'promising', 'humans', 'were', 'just', 'bad.Tirk', 'Drazi', 'big', 'orange', 'fella', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Kit', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'look', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'disguises', 'belonged', 'different', 'show', 'not', 'B5', 'girl/gunner', 'was', 'just', 'sad', '6', 'As', 'much', 'Andreas', ""Katsulas/G'kar"", 'tried', 'Dylan', 'Neal', 'was', 'definitely', 'poor', 'choice', 'best', 'Captain', 'Martell.7', 'so', 'much', 'stake', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Delenn', 'Sheridan', 'even', 'Vir', 'Lochley', ""G'kar.Overall"", 'story/plot', 'good', 'one', 'haunting', 'being', 'attention-grabbing', 'twist', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'naturally', 'better', 'technology', 'progressed', 'dialogues', 'were', 'way', 'average', 'responsible', 'should', 'be', 'subjected', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'music', 'was', 'right', 'nothing', 'compared', 'past', 'scores', 'acting', 'lot', 'work', 'cast', 'carry', 'out', 'performances', 'rather', 'poorly', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'bit', 'uneasy', 'however', 'usually', 'case', 'most', 'series', 'beginning', 'short', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'missing', 'B5', 'feel', 'pretty', 'much', 'Please', 'bring', 'back', 'Babylon', '5', 'owe', 'fans']",N/A

But I had nothing else to watch!Yet I have to say, that I found it to be just right for light late Friday Night movie fare. You really can't expect them to top the Shadow War-- so everything that comes out of the Bab 5 Universe will always be overshadowed (Pun not intended)The ""We live for the One, We die for the One"" line was eye-rolling overkill. Fortunately, you can sense when the script is getting ready to barf it up and you can go: Yeah-Yeah, Rah-Rah, [Fast Forward] and not miss anything of value.And as for the Weapons Tech-- That bit actually made me LAUGH. In my mind, the mistake made was that they did not follow the general SCI-FI rule for Fighting Females. She should have been dressed in a MinBari leather Battle Bikini or something. Then the male half of the audience would have accepted the antics with quiet concentration. Hey-- it works for the Star Trek Universe!Beyond that, I was intrigued by the notion of a billion year old bad guy. Obviously, this TV movie was a pilot attempt that never bore fruit.

105806,A3X3TTEUMW9DQ,0790736691,"Mac Breck ""KoshN""","[13, 17]","I am generally among the first to defend a Babylon 5 universe show or movie in the face of the inevitable negative reviews, but this is the exception.  In most cases, the negative reviews come from either diehard trekkies/trekkers who reflexively hate everything in the Babylon 5 universe, or people who just don't ""get it.""  The latter reviews are usually littered with errors and misunderstandings.  In this case, the negative reviews of this DVD are 95% justified.  As one person said, ""Would've been better left off the shelves..."".  That pretty much sums it up.  It is extremely unfortunate that this is probably the last thing in the Babylon 5 universe that will ever be produced (meaning for TV or the movies).  Oh how I wish it would have ended on a better note.The Bad:The whole premise of the movie is flawed.  No Ranger Council would have a policy of death before retreat, in all circumstances.  That's utter lunacy.  Without that policy, the rest of the movie wouldn't have happened.  Indeed, it would have been better if this movie hadn't happened, because as it is, it's a pure Sci-Fi Channel Saturday Grade Z movie bad.  If the Babylon 5 universe on TV had ended with ""Crusade,"" as damaged by TNT-Atlanta meddling as ""Crusade"" was, that would have been far better, because there are some real gems in the ""Crusade"" 13-episode run.Regarding the ""Babylon 5 - The Legend of the Rangers"" DVD (movie title: ""To Live and Die in Starlight""), it's hard to tell at some points if the acting is bad, or if it's the script.  Actually, it's probably a lot of both.  For example, see the dojo scene with the captain, the crew and Tannier.  Yes, this is the same ""Tannier"" (same character/different actor) from B5's ""Learning Curve"" except that here, Tannier's a pompous idiot.  The part where Sarah is being held back, like a Yorkshire Terrier pup who is about to attack a fully grown German Shepherd Dog which has been trained as a guard dog, is visually, utterly laughable at the same time that the dialogue is painful to experience. Think, the cowardly lion from The Wizard of Oz  (""Lemme at `em."").  Later, Sarah's conniption fit in the VR weapons gizmo is even worse, and so bad that I have to FF past it or leave the room.Overall, this movie feels like something that's not really in the Babylon 5 universe, or that was set in the Babylon 5 universe but was written and produced by somebody without previous experience in that universe.  It just rings false.  Part of this is because, all of the Babylon 5 and Crusade CGI computer files were ""lost"" (We'll never know what really happened.) by Warner Brothers, and there's no time or budget to re-create 5+ years of creative work for one low-budget TV movie.  The only things the production team had from the past were the low-res stuff they'd given to Sierra for the aborted/never produced space combat flight simulator (""Into the Fire"").  That's why all previous Babylon 5 ships and the station itself are only seen briefly, and from mid to far distance (e.g. B5 barely rotates, and the planet Epsilon 3, around which B5 orbits, isn't there.), and why the featured ships are ALL never before seen designs.  Also, neither Foundation Imaging nor Netter Digital did the CGI for this movie.  It was done by Gajdecki Visual Effects (GVFX), an FX company without previous Babylon 5 universe experience, hence the Minbari Nial fighters shown flying backwards (aerodynamically=backwards for Minbari Nial Fighters).  Wish somebody would have caught that!The Good:Some of the characters/actors would make welcome additions to the Babylon 5/Crusade universe.  Captain Martel is, for the most part, pretty good, when he's not making his way through awful or connect-the-dots-for-the-crew/viewer dialogue.  He and Dulann have great chemistry together.  One of the best exchanges of the movie is when Dulann causes Martel to do a humorous doubletake.  Dulann is certainly a standout, and one of the best characters in the movie.  Na'Feel (though I cringe at the unfortunate name which is obviously too close to ""Dureena Nafeel"" from ""Crusade."") and Firell are also excellent in their roles.  Na'Feel is a Narn in the mold of the fiery Na'Toth of Babylon 5 fame, and that's a huge compliment.  Firell is more subdued, though with (I suspect) a wicked, understated sense of humor (Think of the Minbari seamstress who jabbed Zack with a needle when he was getting fitted for his Army of Light uniform.&lt;G>).Bottom Line:No matter what, DO NOT let this DVD be your or anybody else's FIRST viewing experience in the Babylon 5 universe, because you'll be doing that person a grave disservice.  This TV movie is NOT representative of the high quality of ""Babylon 5"" (the TV episodes or the movies) or ""Crusade.""  Watch any of ""Babylon 5"" or ""Crusade"" first.  Just don't START with this movie.",1,"1 Star, Barely.",1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,4831,"['am', 'generally', 'first', 'defend', 'Babylon', '5', 'universe', 'show', 'movie', 'face', 'inevitable',

And I agree; there was definitely the potential for this movie to become a pretty decent series.But it didn't.All we have to judge is what's on the screen.  All the guesses about where the show was going, how the actors would mature, and the overarching themes are moot.  Because what's on the screen is pretty bad.Sure, it may be average for a pilot.  It may even be good for a pilot.  Watching ""The Gathering"" after seeing a couple seasons of B5, you cut it a lot of slack.  We don't have that luxury with failed pilots, and it's just silly to say that we should enjoy ""Legend of the Rangers"" for what might have been.Pilot or not, this is a bad movie.Fact is, there's nothing fresh here.  It's formulaic, with characters who come not out of Central Casting, but out of Wardrobe.  Plot and dialogue were both flat and predictable.  The premise was weak, but not laughable.

105809,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,0790736691,Mark Baker,"[72, 78]","Ranger David Martell (Dylan Neal) has committed a horrid offense - staying alive.  The Ranger code strictly states that at no time shall a Ranger back down from a fight.  But with his ship out-gunned, David doesn't force a fight, thereby living to fight another day.A funny thing happens on the way to his court marshal.  Saner heads prevail, and he is allowed to stay in the Rangers.  He was in line to be given command of a new ship just coming off the assembly line.  He does still get to command a ship, but he is given command of a 20-year-old Minbari ship rumored to be haunted.His first assignment is to provide support for a larger ship taking a group of delegates to an undisclosed location.  Even with all the secrecy, they still fly into an ambush, and David and his crew must use every trick up their sleeve if they are going to survive this encounter with an ancient race.I had only watched this movie once, the day it first aired.  I was less then impressed.  I bought it mainly so I could complete my Babylon 5 collection.  The movie was actually better then I remembered.The story presented here is entertaining.  It had been long enough since I had seen it that I couldn't remember much about it and was pulled into the action again.  The acting by a group of unknowns is top notch, and the characters are interesting enough that I wish the series had been picked up so we could learn more about them.  Fan favorite Andreas Katsulas (who unfortunately passed away recently) returns as G'Kar, the only character from the original series to appear.  His performance, as always, is great.  And the dialog is witty.  I was laughing out loud at many of the lines.  This is some of the sharpest writing series creator J. Michael Straczynski (JMS) has done.  This is all supported by great special effects.Unfortunately, the flaws I remembered were still here.  If this had been the pilot for a new series, it would have worked well.  It introduces us to a new danger and sets a potentially interesting story in motion.  However, since this was all we got, it feels empty.  Adding to this is the sense we've done this before in the original series.  I'm sure a series would have gone in a new direction, but here ""The Hand"" just felt like a retreat of original series villains The Shadows.The almost fatal flaw of this movie, however, is the weapons systems.  I mean, seriously, what was JMS thinking.  In order for this ship to fire, the ammunitions officer must go into a virtual reality chamber and use Kung Fu moves.  I'm not kidding!  She has to punch and kick at pictures of the ships in order to fire the weapons.  While the visuals are unique and interesting, the idea that a ship would have a weapons system like that is laughable.  It pulls me right out of the movie.This movie was never popular with fans, and in keeping with that, this is a bare bones release.  We get the movie in widescreen and surround sound with nothing in the way of extras.  I'm a little disappointed.

Initially I was disappointed. The first third or so was weak, with the usually  insightful dialogue ending up sounding corny, cutesy kids annoying anyone  with a mental age of over two, the acting being below standard and the pace  lagging slightly. I also have problems with the characters. The way that  they all coveniantly meet up before being posted to Babylon 5 to go on an  adventure is lame and more worthy of Star Trek than intelligent drama, and  also begs the question as to why the characters did not comment on these  experiences during the series. The film also weakens itself by spreading  intself to thinly in an attempt to concentrate on too many characters. We  need to know more about certain revelations from Franklin's past (I shant  give it away), and both Ivonava and Sinclair need another scene each to  respectively conclude and introduce their roles in the film. The ending,  like the series ofetn does, begs many more questions, and we feel that a  lttle more conclusion would be appropriate. However, despite these  problems, whent he story gets going it is very good. The graphics are  spellbinding, if a little short, and the scenes in which Earth prepares to  be annihilated are some of the most powerful and emotive scenes in science  fiction history, a difficult task when we are dealing with such a  far-from-home concept. The scenes in which the humans fight for Earth under  a powerful musical score are equally as impressive.

105824,A16QODENBJVUI1,0790736691,Robert Moore,"[2, 3]","The mantra in Henrik Ibsen's play THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE is ""The minority is always right.""  Well, maybe in some things, but I believe the majority is right about THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS.  In fact, nearly all of the made for TV movies bearing the B5 label have been pretty bad.  I think there are at least three reasons for that.First, while B5 as a TV series was also heavily centered on talk, the movies ratchet this up to an even higher degree.  In fact, the movies -- and THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS is actually not the worst offender here, being topped by THE LOST TALES -- degenerate to almost nothing but talk. This would be OK if it were like THE GILMORE GIRLS or PUSHING DAISIES, where the talk is so brilliant that it becomes an end in itself, but on B5 it isn't even interesting talk.  At least not in the movies.Second, the way that B5 managed its success overall reminds me of something that Robert E. Lee said about Longstreet, on of his generals.  Lee said that unlike Stonewall Jackson, Longstreet's corps was very slow to get into battle, but that when it finally did, it hit very, very hard.  Likewise, B5 as a series was very, very slow to get going (it required nearly two seasons of preparatory episodes to really get into gear), but once it did it paid off in a big way.  Two rather dull seasons set up two very exciting seasons (with a largely slow Season 5 that possessed an exciting ending).  B5's strength was never the stand-alone episode, but the long, slow developing arc.  There was simply no way the show was going to succeed in stand-alone movies without some significant changes in format.Third, like most of the TV movies, RANGERS is a poorly budgeted affair.  For instance, although the special effects were infinitely better than when the series first started off, there were relatively few such shots, simply because they couldn't afford them.  It was also felt in the cast budget.  Most of the other B5 movies either had more characters from the B5 series or a couple of major guest stars.  RANGERS has next to no one from the series and no guest star of note.I could add a fourth reason that accounts for the particular failure of RANGERS:  bizarre lapses in judgment.  One of the featured reviews mentions the manner in which the weapons' systems are activated.  It truly is so strange that I can't even stand to think about it.While the B5 movies are never very good, at least in the others you can enjoy seeing old characters you know and miss.  It is like watching old friends.  But apart from G'Kar the familiar faces in this film are very minor characters indeed.  Seeing B5 without any of the well-known characters is like seeing, say, a Creedance Clearwater Revival reunion concert without John Fogerty as a member of the band.",2,I'm with the majority here -- not B5 at its best,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,2775,"['mantra', 'Henrik', 'Ibsen', 'play', 'THE', 'ENEMY', 'THE', 'PEOPLE', 'minority', 'always', 'right', 'Well', 'maybe', 'things', 'believe', 'majority', 'right', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'THE', 'RANGERS', 'fact', 'nearly', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'bearing', 'B5', 'label', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'bad', 'think', 'are', 'least', 'three', 'reasons', 'that.First', 'B5', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'also', 'heavily', 'centered', 'talk', 'movies', 'ratchet', 'up', 'even', 'higher', 'degree', 'fact', 'movies', 'LEGEND', 'THE', 'RANGERS', 'actually', 'not', 'worst', 'offender', 'here', 'being', 'topped', 'LOST', 'TALES', 'degenerate', 'almost', 'nothing', 'talk', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'were', 'THE', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'PUSHING', 'DAISIES', 'where', 'talk', 'so', 'brilliant', 'end', 'B5', ""n't"", 'even', 'interesting', 'talk', 'least', 'not', 'movies.Second', 'way', 'B5', 'managed', 'success', 'overall', 'something', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'said', 'Longstreet', 'generals', 'Lee', 'said', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'Longstreet', 'corps', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'get', 'battle', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'hit', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'Likewise', 'B5', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'slow', 'get', 'going', 'required', 'nearly', 'two', 'seasons', 'preparatory', 'episodes', 'really', 'get', 'gear', 'did', 'paid', 'off', 'big', 'way', 'Two', 'rather', 'dull', 'seasons', 'set', 'up', 'two', 'very', 'exciting', 'seasons', 'largely', 'slow', 'Season', '5', 'possessed', 'exciting', 'ending', 'B5', 'strength', 'was', 'never', 'stand-alone', 'episode', 'long', 'slow', 'developing', 'arc', 'was', 'simply', 'way', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'succeed', 'stand-alone', 'movies', 'significant', 'changes', 'format.Third', 'most', 'TV', 'movies', 'RANGERS', 'poorly', 'budgeted', 'affair', 'instance', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'infinitely', 'better', 'when', 'series', 'first', 'started', 'off', 'were', 'relatively', 'few', 'such', 'shots', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'was', 'also', 'felt', 'cast', 'budget', 'Most', 'other', 'B5', 'movies', 'had', 'more', 'characters', 'B5', 'series', 'couple', 'major', 'guest', 'stars', 'RANGERS', 'next', 'one', 'series', 'guest', 'star', 'note.I', 'could', 'add', 'fourth', 'reason', 'particular', 'failure', 'RANGERS', 'bizarre', 'lapses', 'judgment', 'One', 'featured', 'reviews', 'mentions', 'manner', 'weapons', 'systems', 'are', 'activated', 'truly', 'so', 'strange', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'think', 'it.While', 'B5', 'movies', 'are', 'never', 'very', 'good', 'least', 'others', 'can', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'old', 'characters', 'know', 'miss', 'watching', 'old', 'friends', 'apart', ""G'Kar"", 'familiar', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'characters', 'indeed', 'Seeing', 'B5', 'well-known', 'characters', 'seeing', 'say', 'Creedance', 'Clearwater', 'Revival', 'reunion', 'concert', 'John', 'Fogerty', 'member', 'band']",N/A

105829,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,0790736691,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[3, 4]","I have no idea what JMS had in mind when he put this one together. Babylon 5 is arguably the greatest science fiction television series ever made. While his other television movies met with varying degrees of success and his second B5 related series, Crusade, was killed before it can get really good all these productions still had some level of quality tied to them that still made it all worthy of being in the Babylon 5 universe. The Legend of the Rangers on the other hand feels like it was moving on the contrary to everything that made B5 great.Okay. The premise for this potential new series itself sounds very, very cool... from the outside. The problem is this little feature killed everything that would have made the premise cool. In the B5 series the Rangers had an iconic mystique about them. They were highly trained knights dedicated to their oath to live and die for The One. In this movie they have been reduced to an average military entity with no more nobility than any other average armed force. Essentially destroying everything that made the Rangers cool to begin with. What you end up with is just another military story told in space. Unfortunately that's already been done and done a lot better with shows like Space: Above and Beyond and Roughnecks: Chronicles of the Starship Troopers.They don't stop there either. They decided to change some designs to something completely different. Jumpgates look a lot different now, but the thing is why change it? The jumpgate effect from every other B5 show was perfectly fine. It's as if they wanted to liven it up or just show off some new CG effects. Either way it takes away from the B5 universe by changing something that has been common ground before and almost saying, ""Nope. What you saw all this time wasn't it. THIS is what it's supposed to look like.""Then there are the ship designs. The 'new' White Star ship definitely does not look right. The ship looks more like a Star Trek ship than a Minbari/Human ship like Excalibur. Hello? I think the Romulans want their blueprints back. Also the 'older' Minbari ship is another messed up design. Both the inside and outside of the ship doesn't conform to what we know to be Minbari. Don't even get me started on the floating 3D Minbari ship combat system. While it's a cool concept it's way out on left field in the B5 universe. Not only that it just doesn't make sense. If this is how the Minbari have done it how come they didn't use that on the White Star in the original series? Not to mention the logistical inaccuracies.Okay I spent a lot of time harping on the little geeky details on why it shouldn't be in the B5 universe. What about the actual story? Well you see the story would pretty much be the only this left to salvage this mess, but it doesn't. Like I said before what you have here is nothing fresh or new. It's not even something old yet well done. The characters don't really have strong motivations here and tend to be on the two-dimensional side. Andreas Katsulas makes an appearance as B5 series favorite G'Kar but even that was written a bit out of character. While you do find some clever scenes here and there it's just not enough to validate this show.Babylon 5 was a triumph. Crusade should have had a chance. Legend of the Rangers deserves to be lost. Even die hard B5 fans will find this one lacking. The average Sci-Fi fan with no prior B5 exposure will probably enjoy this enough as a military space featurette.

I guess Lorien just neglected to mention them.  Zog!  One of the main strengths of B5 was continuity and the Hand was the biggest continuity violation in the B5 universe, not the greatest basis for a new series.
