Daniel Hsia, the writer and director, has created a funny and strangely personal adventure of an American executive navigating the personal and professional idiosyncrasies of modern expat/Chinese culture. I can attest to this given I also was an expat executive in Shanghai. (Several scenes are shot in Vizcaya, the exact same housing complex I lived in from 2005 to 2008.) While it may not be as funny for those that haven't had similar experiences, there is still enough unique comedy scenes to make it an enjoyable romp for most. What makes it stand out from most of Hollywood's stereotypical coverage of life in China is that it takes conventional perceptions of China and turns them on its head.",4,And  you thought you knew what China was like ...,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,819,"['Shanghai', 'Calling', 'entertaining', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'very', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'expatriate', 'life', 'Shanghai', 'China', 'Daniel', 'Hsia', 'writer', 'director', 'created', 'funny', 'strangely', 'personal', 'adventure', 'American', 'executive', 'navigating', 'personal', 'professional', 'idiosyncrasies', 'modern', 'expat/Chinese', 'culture', 'can', 'attest', 'given', 'also', 'was', 'expat', 'executive', 'Shanghai', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'Vizcaya', 'exact', 'same', 'housing', 'complex', 'lived', '2005', '2008', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'funny', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'similar', 'experiences', 'still', 'enough', 'unique', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'most', 'What', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'stereotypical', 'coverage', 'life', 'China', 'conventional', 'perceptions', 'China', 'head']",Shanghai Calling(DVD9) (China Version)

487211,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,7880862595,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[10, 11]","SHANGHAI CALLING (Writ./Dir. Daniel Hsia, 2012, 100 minutes) is one of those movies that causes me to ache with anger and resentment at the fact that we miss these gems in the first place. I cannot understand the wasted hard work, the talent, that essentially goes down the drain from lack of an audience for such films.This jewel of a film, which should be seen by everyone, grossed just over $10,000 when it opened. That's right, this classic film grossed less than it costs to buy a crappy SUV.Oscar-worthy all around, this is the story of gorgeous corporate lawyer Sam Chou (Daniel Henney), a Chinese-American who is tapped to go to Shanghai by his firm. Since he is of Chinese descent - though 100% American - his firm thinks he'll be more effective. The odious task on which he embarks will not only warm your heart, it will open your eyes about Sino-American business practices.Arriving in Shanghai, Sam quickly learns that the American ""expat"" community understands what it really is: a group of immigrants. The ""mayor"" of the community is a charming and understated Bill Paxton; along the way, others will appear and make this film totally worthwhile and fun.I must say, not only Daniel Henney but this entire film was redolent of a fine Buster Keaton film. Being an aficionado and connoisseur, I felt the entire time as if BK had made this film. Henney has a Keatonesque talent for the smooth, elegant bumbling that endears an audience immediately. Since this is a true family comedy, there is no need for Henney's character to be a true shark. As a comic-dramatic actor, Henney is set free here in a way only Keaton understood/exploited properly.My favorite scene, one I urge you to watch for, is the caf&eacute; scene in which Sam meets a mysterious, wise stranger. That was so funny I found it hard to breathe. And let me add that the Chinese music in the soundtrack is incredibly upbeat and relevant - but it's fun, and I'd like to own the soundtrack along with the film.With the amazing talents of Eliza Coupe, Alan Ruck, Geng Le, Zhu Zhu, Jim Bennett, and Arran Hawkins.",5,"""It's time to get in touch with your culture ... by having sex with it!""",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,2086,"['SHANGHAI', 'CALLING', 'Writ./Dir', 'Daniel', 'Hsia', '2012', '100', 'minutes', 'one', 'movies', 'ache', 'anger', 'resentment', 'fact', 'miss', 'gems', 'first', 'place', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'wasted', 'hard', 'work', 'talent', 'essentially', 'down', 'drain', 'lack', 'audience', 'such', 'films.This', 'jewel', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'grossed', 'just', '10,000', 'when', 'opened', 'right', 'classic', 'film', 'grossed', 'less', 'buy', 'crappy', 'SUV.Oscar-worthy', 'around', 'story', 'gorgeous', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'Sam', 'Chou', 'Daniel', 'Henney', 'Chinese-American', 'who', 'tapped', 'go', 'Shanghai', 'firm', 'Chinese', 'descent', '100', '%', 'American', 'firm', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'odious', 'task', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'warm', 'heart', 'will', 'open', 'eyes', 'Sino-American', 'business', 'practices.Arriving', 'Shanghai', 'Sam', 'quickly', 'American', 'expat', 'community', 'what', 'really', 'group', 'immigrants', 'mayor', 'community', 'charming', 'understated', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'way', 'others', 'will', 'appear', 'make', 'film', 'totally', 'worthwhile', 'fun.I', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'only', 'Daniel', 'Henney', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'redolent', 'fine', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'film', 'Being', 'aficionado', 'connoisseur', 'felt', 'entire', 'time', 'BK', 'had', 'made', 'film', 'Henney', 'Keatonesque', 'talent', 'smooth', 'elegant', 'bumbling', 'audience', 'immediately', 'true', 'family', 'comedy', 'need', 'Henney', 'character', 'be', 'true', 'shark', 'comic-dramatic', 'actor', 'Henney', 'set', 'free', 'here', 'way', 'only', 'Keaton', 'understood/exploited', 'properly.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'urge', 'watch', 'caf', 'eacute', 'scene', 'Sam', 'mysterious', 'wise', 'stranger', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'found', 'hard', 'breathe', 'let', 'add', 'Chinese', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'incredibly', 'upbeat', 'relevant', 'fun', ""'d"", 'like', 'own', 'soundtrack', 'film.With', 'amazing', 'talents', 'Eliza', 'Coupe', 'Alan', 'Ruck', 'Geng', 'Le', 'Zhu', 'Zhu', 'Jim', 'Bennett', 'Arran', 'Hawkins']",Shanghai Calling(DVD9) (China Version)

And if it were for that alone it would be worth an evening's outing, but graced by a really top notch cast of fresh actors not well known  - yet - it becomes a tender little romp set in the spectacular beauty of Shanghai!The story is a predictable one:a young handsome Chinese American Lawyer (a very fine young actor hunk Daniel Henney) who was born in America and speaks no Chinese at all is sent by his major law firm in New York to gain access into the big business happening in Shanghai - home of the manufacturers who make everything used in this country it seems! Once in China he encounters Chinese  customs of which he is ignorant, a language he does not understand, an ex-pat mayor of Americatown (Bill Paxton), a beautiful single mom (Eliza Coupe, another one to watch) who  has moved to China to give her  daughter a new life and is in charge of finding homes for new businessmen, a gorgeous assistant (Zhu Zhu)who falls for him, and a crazy ex-pat (Alan Ruck)who teaches English as a sideline to womanizing. When our young lawyer seems to fail at everything he intends to do he engages a fix-it guy humorously called Awesome Wang (Geng Le) and gradually our lawyer finds a new outlook on his cultural heritage, rights some wrongs, and falls in love.Daniel Hsia directs and keeps the momentum  going throughout film - even when relying on the ubiquitous chase  scenes (here on bicycles).

It's a film we've all seen many times before and either works really well (like Outsourced, for example) or limps along as a string of predictable scenes waiting for an ending. Unfortunately, this starts out with a relatively good 20-30 minutes but rapidly gets worse with every passing scene.Everything shown in the trailer happens within the first 5 minutes of the film so we never get to explore the character before he's uprooted and moved. There's literally no context whatsoever about his life before the transition so it's difficult to really care how it affects him.There are several mini plotlines that aren't particularly engaging. There's an unlikely romance between our lawyer and his relocation agent, a case of industrial espionage where the Chinese are painted as technological innovators unfairly targeted by mean Americans, and something to do with his secretary and her desire to escape her poor family upbringing. And then there's Bill Paxton - a wealthy senior executive who for some reason also works as a bartender.What starts out as fairly light and entertaining starts to fall apart about half way where it becomes painfully predictable and the really, really weak dialog can't support the lack of characterization.

To be honest I quit after an hour and admitted life is too short to spend watching something so lacking on entertainment quality.

Films of this type I think, rely on the viewer's ability to see themselves in the same situation.  I could not relate to his situation.
