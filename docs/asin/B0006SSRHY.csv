I saw his first ""Tiesto in Concert"" and was pretty impressed with the stage light show and music. This DVD made me forget that one. The stage was amazing and the only that could have made it better would have been to see him live. I highly recommend anything Tiesto releases and this DVD is at the top of the list.",5,Simply AMAZING,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,445,"['DVD', 'will', 'blow', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Tiesto', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'thought', ""'d"", 'heard', 'seen', 'say', 'saw', 'first', 'Tiesto', 'Concert', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'stage', 'light', 'show', 'music', 'DVD', 'made', 'forget', 'one', 'stage', 'was', 'amazing', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'live', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anything', 'Tiesto', 'DVD', 'top', 'list']",N/A
873964,A2SQHMJ5SR992U,B0006SSRHY,Brian,"[4, 5]","I will agree with the general consensus that the dvd is hard to watch because of the short, fast scenes, especially at the beginning.  Also, the lack of any special features or a bonus disc is a let down.  Those are the reasons for which one star was deducted from my rating.Musically, it is a phenominal track selection and Tiesto's mixing is on point.  There are also some great performances, my favorite being Mason rocking that electric violin during Lethal Industry.  Also, hearing the crowd sing along to ""Love Comes Again"" makes you feel as if you are at the concert.  Tiesto varies it between his own tracks, other producers' tracks, and other producers' remixes and edits of his own songs.  It really strikes a nice balance.  The overall concert seems to be much better than the first one.  I saw him here in Charlotte about 5 weeks after the concert and his track selection was similar, so it brings back a lot of memories from that performance too.  The MC doesn't speak as much as during the first one, which is nice too.  I may have to get the European version for that extra disc.  I can't wait for In Search of Sunrise 4.",4,"Excellent musically, lacking visually",1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,1136,"['will', 'agree', 'general', 'consensus', 'dvd', 'hard', 'watch', 'short', 'fast', 'scenes', 'especially', 'beginning', 'Also', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'bonus', 'disc', 'let', 'down', 'are', 'reasons', 'one', 'star', 'was', 'deducted', 'rating.Musically', 'phenominal', 'track', 'selection', 'Tiesto', 'mixing', 'point', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'favorite', 'being', 'Mason', 'rocking', 'electric', 'violin', 'Lethal', 'Industry', 'Also', 'hearing', 'crowd', 'sing', 'along', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Again', 'feel', 'are', 'concert', 'Tiesto', 'own', 'tracks', 'other', 'producers', 'tracks', 'other', 'producers', 'remixes', 'edits', 'own', 'songs', 'really', 'nice', 'balance', 'overall', 'concert', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'saw', 'here', 'Charlotte', '5', 'weeks', 'concert', 'track', 'selection', 'was', 'similar', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'performance', 'too', 'MC', ""n't"", 'speak', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'one', 'nice', 'too', 'may', 'have', 'get', 'European', 'version', 'extra', 'disc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Search', 'Sunrise', '4']",N/A

The first concert was mostly focused on Tiesto mixing his music, which gets boring after a while. Seeing the crowds enjoying their time so much, combined with the great music of Tiesto, definetely makes the second DVD concert a great one.I loved how Tiesto ended the concert with his famous remix of ""Silence"", a classic.",5,Great DVD,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,412,"['really', 'good', 'Much', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'fans', 'more', 'often', 'first', 'concert', 'was', 'mostly', 'focused', 'Tiesto', 'mixing', 'music', 'boring', 'while', 'Seeing', 'crowds', 'enjoying', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'combined', 'great', 'music', 'Tiesto', 'definetely', 'second', 'DVD', 'concert', 'great', 'one.I', 'loved', 'how', 'Tiesto', 'ended', 'concert', 'famous', 'remix', 'Silence', 'classic']",N/A
