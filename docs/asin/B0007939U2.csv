I have absolutely NOTHING negative to say about this show, its such a bizarre and crazy show that you cant help but enjoy it. The English dub is also fantastically hilarious with its strangely amusing curse words that bring a smile to my face every time I hear it. The show also features great animation, (not surprising since it only has 3 episodes) when i ask people if they remember this show they say they dont, REALLY? its one of the craziest shows in the universe!

878373,AE5A9FB765HMF,B0007939U2,gex144,"[0, 0]","First off, I enjoyed this show.  It has the exploding neck collar idea that was later used in Battle Royale.  Since this show obviously predates Battle Royale, I thought that was cool.Secondly, people complain about the swearing.  Personally, that's what I think adds to the fun factor of this show.  The swearing is so over-the-top and unnecessary and overdone, you just gotta laugh at it.  This show has some great one liners, including, ""I'm downloading you straight into hell!"" and, ""You wouldn't recognize a goddamn vampire if one jumped up and bit you on the end of your ****ing dick.""  Now how can you not want to watch this show when you know that lines like that are in it?There are three episodes, and 3 main characters.  Each episode focuses on one of the three men who are prisoners who get collars put on them so that they act like police, going after criminals and doing what they're told by the higher-up, all for the sake of having their sentences reduced.  Each episode has all 3 characters doing a specific assigned mission, but each episode basically has one guy doing the most work, hence the main character for the episode.  I thought the first episode was the best, as each episode afterwards got more and more over-the-top unbelievable, and not in a cheesy way, mainly in ways where characters survive against too much unbelievable stuff, more and more suspension of disbelief is required, etc.  For example, in the last episode, the main character goes to a structure in space through an elevator connected from earth (the ground) all the way through the atmosphere and into space and to a connected space station.  Just that alone outta let you know how unbelievable it gets, but then there's the main character surviving in the elevator shaft after a conflict.  But despite all that, the show is still good fun.That said, the last episode didn't feel like a final episode.  All it did was get us familiar with the final character in the main trio.  There should've been one more where all three character become the focus, where they are all directly put into a big conflict that shakes the foundations of the series, such as going on an assignment to protect the guy who put the collars on them, or finding a way to get the collars off, or none of the above but still giving us something else.  But alas, it's not meant to be.  Was tempted to give this show 3 stars, but decided it was entertaining enough for 4, especially with the price it currently has, and for the great foul-mouthed lines.

The other two are A.D. Police and Geno Cyber.This dvd is about three men doing time and given the choice of serving their 100 years plus sentence or do odd jobs for the cyber police. There are a few conditions, they have to wear an electric collar and are given an alloted time to complete the job, or their neck is made redundant from the rest of their body. With the completion of each mission their sentance is reduced a few years.Sengoku, Goggles and Benten are so tough any mortal would kill to be able to take what is dished out to them. Sengoku has to deal with a systems programmer who hooked himself up to a computer 15 years earlier when his partner tried to kill him. His body is long dead but the computer still works and is finally taking revenge for happened long ago. It is Sengoku's job to sort out this mess before his time runs out.In the second episode Goggles gets to play with a new indestructible cyborg being tested for the army. The pain he endures from all manner of things is REALLY beyond any human endurance, but he wins out with a few seconds before the collar does it's work.The last episode sees Beten taking on a vampire, who can rejuvenate himself, with almost fatal consequences. The vampire thinks he is immortal, but he learns every quick that everything that exists must sooner or later come to an end, that is the law of the universe.As with most manga, this one is no exception, and I give it five stars as I am a manga nut. I would recommend it to any other manga junkie out there, and to tell them to get the others in the series as well. This would be a much welcomed addition to any collection, but overseas people should be aware of the titles as they are different in America.",5,Cyber City OEDO 808,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1865,"['America', 'dvd', 'different', 'name', 'known', 'Cyber', 'City', 'OEDO', '808', 'Australia', 'first', 'series', 'called', 'Cyber', 'Punk', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'A.D.', 'Police', 'Geno', 'Cyber.This', 'dvd', 'three', 'men', 'doing', 'time', 'given', 'choice', 'serving', '100', 'years', 'plus', 'sentence', 'do', 'odd', 'jobs', 'cyber', 'police', 'are', 'few', 'conditions', 'have', 'wear', 'electric', 'collar', 'are', 'given', 'alloted', 'time', 'complete', 'job', 'neck', 'made', 'redundant', 'rest', 'body', 'completion', 'mission', 'sentance', 'reduced', 'few', 'years.Sengoku', 'Goggles', 'Benten', 'are', 'so', 'tough', 'mortal', 'would', 'kill', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'what', 'dished', 'Sengoku', 'deal', 'systems', 'programmer', 'who', 'hooked', 'up', 'computer', '15', 'years', 'earlier', 'when', 'partner', 'tried', 'kill', 'body', 'long', 'dead', 'computer', 'still', 'finally', 'taking', 'revenge', 'happened', 'long', 'ago', 'Sengoku', 'job', 'sort', 'out', 'mess', 'time', 'second', 'episode', 'Goggles', 'play', 'new', 'indestructible', 'cyborg', 'being', 'tested', 'army', 'pain', 'manner', 'things', 'REALLY', 'human', 'endurance', 'out', 'few', 'seconds', 'collar', 'work.The', 'last', 'episode', 'sees', 'Beten', 'taking', 'vampire', 'who', 'can', 'rejuvenate', 'almost', 'fatal', 'consequences', 'vampire', 'immortal', 'quick', 'everything', 'must', 'sooner', 'later', 'come', 'end', 'law', 'universe.As', 'most', 'manga', 'one', 'exception', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'am', 'manga', 'nut', 'would', 'recommend', 'other', 'manga', 'junkie', 'there', 'tell', 'get', 'others', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'welcomed', 'addition', 'collection', 'overseas', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'titles', 'are', 'different', 'America']",Cyber City - The Final Collection

Was plesantly surprised.  **Minor Spoilers, nothing that will ruin your viewing**.  This short series focuses in on 3 criminals with rediculously long criminal records.  Well not so long, (I work in law enforcement and there are people you could literally run outside and wrap their criminal history printouts around the building, if you printed it on Dot Matrix paper...)  Anyway these 3 badassess are offered a reprieve.  Work for the police and get out of their space prison they are marooned on.  They all three accept.  The bad catch for them is they have collars on their necks like in The Running Man that will blow off their heads at any time.  The ""Probation Officer"" gives them missions they must complete, and complete in certain time limits he sets.  With theirs clocks ticking literally they have to go in and resolve back situations...and fast.  Each episode focus's in on a different of the three.  So each episode has a slightly different feel.  I bought mine for under 10 bucks off Amazon.  Recommend you not pay anymore than this, as this is rather short, around 60 minutes.
