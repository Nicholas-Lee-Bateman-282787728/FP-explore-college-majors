945210,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000BMY2ME,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","Paul Bernardo wasn't a nice guy.  Now we know that he didn't have very good taste, either.Mr. Bernardo liked this film so much, he even changed his last name to ""Teale,"" a slight variation on the name of the Kevin Bacon character in ""Criminal Law.""  I just read the book ""Invisible Darkness"" by Stephen Williams -- a slightly biased but excellent read by a very good crime writer -- and in that book, Mr. Williams described how this film was Mr. Bernardo's -- or is that Mr. Teale's? -- favorite film.  If you know anything about Mr. Bernardo, you might say, ""Not surprising.""Now, the cast in this film is top notch.  I am a Kevin Bacon fan -- I believe that he has done some excellent work throughout his career -- and Gary Oldman gave a performance of a lifetime in ""Dracula,"" even though Keanu Reeves did his best to pull him down.  (I'm teasing a bit.  Mr. Reeves wasn't half bad in that film.)  But the female lead and female supporting actors here?  I thought they were fine with what they had to work with, but I can't remember seeing them ever in anything else.The problem with ""Criminal Law"":  well OK; there are not just a few.  But for me, there was way too much exposition, particularly by the Kevin Bacon character just before he was going to do something nasty.  In my opinion, if you were a serial killer, you probably wouldn't have too much time for chit chat in most scenarios, since, well, your ""prey"" would be fighting back.  That prey wouldn't just be standing there listening to you ramble, as if you were accepting an Academy Award nomination, a nomination that surely no one in this borderline film ever received.To Mr. Bacon and Mr. Oldman I say:  ""Don't take it too hard.  After all, I'm not a professional film critic.  Not only that, you both have done fine work in your careers, so just let this one go.""  To Mr. Bernardo I say:  ""Keep your day job, which would probably be banging your head against the wall in a 6 foot by 10 foot cell in solitary.  With your picks in film, you'll surely never be a film critic.""",2,It's Criminal - I want my money back!,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,2042,"['Paul', 'Bernardo', 'was', ""n't"", 'nice', 'guy', 'Now', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'taste', 'either.Mr', 'Bernardo', 'liked', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'changed', 'last', 'name', 'Teale', 'slight', 'variation', 'name', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'Criminal', 'Law', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'Invisible', 'Darkness', 'Stephen', 'Williams', 'slightly', 'biased', 'excellent', 'read', 'very', 'good', 'crime', 'writer', 'book', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'described', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'Mr.', 'Teale', 'favorite', 'film', 'know', 'anything', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'might', 'say', 'Not', 'surprising', 'Now', 'cast', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'am', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'fan', 'believe', 'done', 'excellent', 'work', 'career', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'gave', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Dracula', 'even', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'did', 'best', 'pull', 'down', ""'m"", 'teasing', 'bit', 'Mr.', 'Reeves', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'film', 'female', 'lead', 'female', 'supporting', 'actors', 'here', 'thought', 'were', 'fine', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'ever', 'anything', 'else.The', 'problem', 'Criminal', 'Law', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'particularly', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'just', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'nasty', 'opinion', 'were', 'serial', 'killer', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'chit', 'chat', 'most', 'scenarios', 'well', 'prey', 'would', 'be', 'fighting', 'back', 'prey', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'standing', 'there', 'listening', 'ramble', 'were', 'accepting', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'nomination', 'surely', 'one', 'borderline', 'film', 'ever', 'Mr.', 'Bacon', 'Mr.', 'Oldman', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'hard', ""'m"", 'not', 'professional', 'film', 'critic', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'work', 'careers', 'so', 'just', 'let', 'one', 'go', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'say', 'Keep', 'day', 'job', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'banging', 'head', 'wall', '6', 'foot', '10', 'foot', 'cell', 'solitary', 'picks', 'film', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'never', 'be', 'film', 'critic']",N/A

Seeing how this is not available on DVD, and not even being sold by outside sellers tells me that they may never have released it on this format.  That, based on my memory of the quality of the Laser Disc release, does not surprise me in the least.I had this movie on Laser Disc purchased for me by an ex-girlfriend, and definitely shows to me her lack of fortitude in choosing movies based on their quality.  But, who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth.I thought this was the most asinine movie.  It was schlock full of loose strings, un-explaineable (though the tried) plot twists, and complete lack of plot logic. I thought a defense lawyer was supposed to defend you?  Right?  And I thought that all lawyers sign an ethics agreement to support and treat the client with all due respect.  Maybe I'm not using the right terms, but what the hell!Gary Oldman is a defense lawyer, and defends and gets a defendant off (Kevin Bacon) and supposedly, figures out Kevin is actually guilty of the former and a new crime, and suddenly becomes the defender of justice.  Maybe somebody better tell the screenplay writer, that defense lawyers defend the ""guilty"" and do not work for the State Prosecuter's Office, or even the Public Defender's office.  If he accepts the case, and then acts as the Detective, he is immediately guilty of injustice to his client, and the viewer will immediately turn off.However, for some reasons, I didn't turn it off.  I was immediately fascinated by the absurdity of this plot.  And the overacting.  And the stupidity!  Gary Oldman and the Lady Detective deserve the Overacting Raspberry award of the year!  Their on screen interactions were ludicrous and hilarious at the same time!Another reviewer mentioned that Gary Oldman has an American accent.  I actually didn't know he was British when I first saw this movie, and fascinated with how well he could imitate a British accent in his other movies.  Of course, I have since learned his country of origin, and am equally impressed with his American and British accents in many of his films.  He truly is a glorious actor.Even in this movie, he steals most of his scenes, and deserves credit for his wonderful acting.  But the movie is awful, and not even he can save it!If you want to laugh, try to find this on VHS, or even Laser Disc (I still have my copy) but DVD format seems to be up in the air at this time.

Chase realizes that Thiel not only is guilty, but has not given up his murderous ways; in fact, he is a serial killer.The plot is pretty simple; Chase realizes that he has unleased a killer whose mind has been unhinged by his mother's decision to abort him as a developing baby.  What does an ethical man do when he knows someone has used him in a horrific way?Tess Harper does her fine usual job (and looks good doing it) as detective Stillwell, and Joe Don Baker (detective Mesel) is good playing the character he usually plays, a gruff but effective supporting character.The true interest in the film is the main character's acting.  The staging is well done, the cinematography is fine.  The final scene illustrates the fact that there is often little separating the law from the crime.
