There are so many levels and layers to this gay cinematic gem that one viewing will not be enough.Whether viewed as a young man's struggle to find himself by connecting to those inner parts of himself, or rather as a spiritual journey that untimately helps him find truth and hope, this film speaks on several levels and languages.

1297344,A2SIBFTMWJY6ZS,B002WUVVJA,John C. Marshell Jr.,"[3, 5]","Best advice, rent it first, like I did.  After reading the description listed on Amazon, I thought this would be a very stimulating movie based on symbolism and a philosophy of action based creativity that built identity or expressed man's deepest nature, but the reviews were so bad, I decided to delay the purchase and rent it first.  Smart move.Even symbolism needs a structure, and the producer of this somewhat banal film fails to put much of what he is saying into any kind of context, so the symbols just sort of fall flat.  The imagination is left groping for a meaning.  His reluctance to use dialogue hurt his endeavor; it could have given the film's symbols (some of which are still opaque to me) a context for meaning.  Affectivity is an important part of symbolic interaction, but the acting and scenery produce largely a flat aspect in the viewer and prompt only questions rather than an expanse of the mind.  The ham-handed use of a television interview half-way through the film to answer the growing questions in the mind help with the viewing experience, but the sudden inclusion is jarring and moves the mind to a rational process that the use of symbols is suppose to supplant.  In short, it fails to do what it is suppose to do.There are some interesting philosophies that could have supported the theme of action and identity formation--Blondel's Action Theory, the Neo-Confucianism of Wang yang ming, some aspects of Buddhism and Taoism, Romanticism--but if he uses any of them, I missed it.  Fragmented identity and the need to seek wholeness seems to be the pulse of the film, but it is a theme at least as old as Saint Augustine, and the arid use of contemporary psychology does not have the same dynamic as The Confessions.In a more positive vein, the film makes some interesting use of ""science footage"" that reveals the cosmos, though the symbolism is a bit off.  Tom Macy is shot in some interesting ways with light which is aesthetically pleasing.  The nude scenes are very natural.  However, these small highlights hardly justify recommending the film for purchase.",2,Ugh,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,2097,"['Best', 'advice', 'rent', 'first', 'did', 'reading', 'description', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'stimulating', 'movie', 'based', 'symbolism', 'philosophy', 'action', 'based', 'creativity', 'identity', 'expressed', 'man', 'deepest', 'nature', 'reviews', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'decided', 'delay', 'purchase', 'rent', 'first', 'Smart', 'move.Even', 'symbolism', 'structure', 'producer', 'somewhat', 'banal', 'film', 'put', 'much', 'what', 'saying', 'kind', 'context', 'symbols', 'just', 'sort', 'fall', 'flat', 'imagination', 'left', 'groping', 'meaning', 'reluctance', 'use', 'dialogue', 'hurt', 'endeavor', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'symbols', 'are', 'still', 'opaque', 'context', 'meaning', 'Affectivity', 'important', 'part', 'symbolic', 'interaction', 'acting', 'scenery', 'produce', 'largely', 'flat', 'aspect', 'viewer', 'prompt', 'only', 'questions', 'rather', 'expanse', 'mind', 'ham-handed', 'use', 'television', 'interview', 'half-way', 'film', 'answer', 'growing', 'questions', 'mind', 'help', 'viewing', 'experience', 'sudden', 'inclusion', 'jarring', 'mind', 'rational', 'process', 'use', 'symbols', 'suppose', 'supplant', 'short', 'do', 'what', 'suppose', 'are', 'interesting', 'philosophies', 'could', 'have', 'supported', 'theme', 'action', 'identity', 'formation', 'Blondel', 'Action', 'Theory', 'Neo-Confucianism', 'Wang', 'yang', 'ming', 'aspects', 'Buddhism', 'Taoism', 'Romanticism', 'missed', 'Fragmented', 'identity', 'need', 'seek', 'wholeness', 'be', 'pulse', 'film', 'theme', 'least', 'as', 'old', 'Saint', 'Augustine', 'arid', 'use', 'contemporary', 'psychology', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'dynamic', 'Confessions.In', 'more', 'positive', 'vein', 'film', 'interesting', 'use', 'science', 'footage', 'cosmos', 'symbolism', 'bit', 'off', 'Tom', 'Macy', 'shot', 'interesting', 'ways', 'light', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'nude', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'natural', 'However', 'small', 'highlights', 'hardly', 'justify', 'recommending', 'film', 'purchase']",N/A

But I found, much to my surprise, that instead I rather enjoyed it.  Yes, it is everything the critics said about it:  messy, pretentious, self-indulgent, repetitive, slow-moving, nearly incomprehensible.  If you are looking for a straightforward film with a real plot, you had better avoid this one.  But there was something about it that I found appealing.The story (such as it is) deals with a young gay man struggling with writer's block.  Brian (Tom Macy) is unable to make progress on the follow-up to his first phenomenal best seller.  Unable to cope with his fear of failure, and against the advice of his best friend Joe (Andrew Roth), Brian turns to drugs for relief from his anxiety and depression.  The film focuses on the events surrounding the day Brian ""dies"", apparently committing suicide under the influence of the pills.  But is he dead?  Director Alex Pacheco moves backwards and forwards in time, presenting alternate versions of the different chapters in the story.It is all very confusing.  But I guess what I like about the film are the two leads.  Roth and Macy do a fine job with what little they have been given to work with.  And they are both very attractive and share a very erotic swimming/love sequence, which is quite effective in spite of (or maybe because of) not being particularly explicit.I don't really have a clue as to what Pacheco was trying to say, but I liked what I saw well enough to watch his film again.

The plot was awful, the acting was superbly awful and the direction was awful.  I don't even think this movie would be nominated for a Razzie because it was that bad.  So I ask the question...Does it take an A-List actor to make a gay film?
