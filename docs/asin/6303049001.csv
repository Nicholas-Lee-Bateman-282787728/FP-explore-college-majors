353092,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,6303049001,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[0, 0]","I watched Band of Angels by chance on a cable station that features old movies. When the movie began I expected the usual racism of happy slaves and general ridiculousness but was intrigued by the description of 'a tale of miscegenation in the old South'. At some points in the movie I got exactly what I was expecting but every time I was going to change the channel the movie surprised me with something deeper and better and more interesting. I read the reviews on this site and decided that this movie was neither completely politically correct nor completely racist but reflected the simmering tensions and guilts and hopes of its time, written in 1955 and made in 1957 and reflecting all of the hope and despair of the period just before the civil rights movement.Amantha Star has been raised as a Southern belle on her father's plantation where he treats his slaves kindly. She doesn't realize that she is the daughter of a mulatto slave and gets a nasty surprise at his funeral as her father never bothered with her manumission. And he is in debt so she and the population of the entire household are sold South. As well as being owned, rape is a constant danger to Amantha and the movie is more frank about the sexual problems of a slave woman than one would expect of a 1957 production. Nor are the other slaves very nice to Amantha or each other at all times which I thought was a realistic touch. Amantha is bought by Haimish Bond, a former slave trader now plantation owner whose former occupation is a secret and who tries to expiate his guilt by being kind to his slaves.Next there is Ra Rou, played by a very young Sidney Poitier and it is Poitier's scenes which raise this movie above the usual offerings of the time. Ra Rou has been raised as a son to Haimish and in a very powerful scene tells Amantha just why the kindness makes being owned even worse as where can one direct their hatred for being an object when the one imprisoning you is also the one who loves you. Poitier's character, more than any other character reflects the changes that are coming in the time the movie is made rather than the time the movie reflects.All in all, this was better than I expected though the movie does still refect the racism of its time, the Jim Crow south and the nascent civil rights movement. But it reflects some other things too - people's guilt yes, but also people's hope to do better. Mixed yes, but when in life are the good and the bad not mixed? Feminism is a problem as well in this film as it seems perfectly natural for the heroine to seek the protection of some man, even when she is offered her freedom and the possibility of taking care of herself. And the manner in which the rape of slave women is addressed is mixed. Ra Rou is Haimish's natural son as it turns out, but whether his mother was willing, or indeed whether Amantha's was entirely willing (and can a person who is owned even give consent?) is left to the viewer's questioning.Clark Gable is as handsome and charming as ever and I remember why I fell in love with him upon a first viewing of GWTW when I was six. Sidney Poitier gives an impassioned performance that lifts the entire production and Yvonne deCarlo is lovely and competent. This movie is well worth watching for the things it does say and the things it doesn't and reflects the tensions of the late fifties with precision.",4,A Step Along the Way in the Evolution of Civil Rights,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,3379,"['watched', 'Band', 'Angels', 'chance', 'cable', 'station', 'old', 'movies', 'When', 'movie', 'began', 'expected', 'usual', 'racism', 'happy', 'slaves', 'general', 'ridiculousness', 'was', 'intrigued', 'description', 'tale', 'miscegenation', 'old', 'South', 'points', 'movie', 'got', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'time', 'was', 'going', 'change', 'channel', 'movie', 'surprised', 'something', 'deeper', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'read', 'reviews', 'site', 'decided', 'movie', 'was', 'neither', 'completely', 'politically', 'correct', 'completely', 'racist', 'reflected', 'simmering', 'tensions', 'guilts', 'hopes', 'time', 'written', '1955', 'made', '1957', 'reflecting', 'hope', 'despair', 'period', 'just', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement.Amantha', 'Star', 'been', 'raised', 'Southern', 'belle', 'father', 'plantation', 'where', 'slaves', 'kindly', ""n't"", 'realize', 'daughter', 'mulatto', 'slave', 'nasty', 'surprise', 'funeral', 'father', 'never', 'bothered', 'manumission', 'debt', 'population', 'entire', 'household', 'are', 'sold', 'South', 'As', 'well', 'being', 'owned', 'rape', 'constant', 'danger', 'Amantha', 'movie', 'more', 'frank', 'sexual', 'problems', 'slave', 'woman', 'one', 'would', 'expect', '1957', 'production', 'are', 'other', 'slaves', 'very', 'nice', 'Amantha', 'other', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'realistic', 'touch', 'Amantha', 'bought', 'Haimish', 'Bond', 'former', 'slave', 'trader', 'now', 'plantation', 'owner', 'former', 'occupation', 'secret', 'who', 'expiate', 'guilt', 'being', 'kind', 'slaves.Next', 'Ra', 'Rou', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Poitier', 'scenes', 'raise', 'movie', 'usual', 'offerings', 'time', 'Ra', 'Rou', 'been', 'raised', 'son', 'Haimish', 'very', 'powerful', 'scene', 'tells', 'Amantha', 'just', 'why', 'kindness', 'being', 'owned', 'even', 'worse', 'where', 'can', 'one', 'direct', 'hatred', 'being', 'object', 'when', 'one', 'imprisoning', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'Poitier', 'character', 'more', 'other', 'character', 'changes', 'are', 'coming', 'time', 'movie', 'made', 'rather', 'time', 'movie', 'reflects.All', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'movie', 'still', 'refect', 'racism', 'time', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'south', 'nascent', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'other', 'things', 'too', 'people', 'guilt', 'yes', 'also', 'people', 'hope', 'do', 'better', 'Mixed', 'yes', 'when', 'life', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'not', 'mixed', 'Feminism', 'problem', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'heroine', 'seek', 'protection', 'man', 'even', 'when', 'offered', 'freedom', 'possibility', 'taking', 'care', 'herself', 'manner', 'rape', 'slave', 'women', 'addressed', 'mixed', 'Ra', 'Rou', 'Haimish', 'natural', 'son', 'out', 'mother', 'was', 'willing', 'indeed', 'Amantha', 'was', 'entirely', 'willing', 'can', 'person', 'who', 'owned', 'even', 'give', 'consent', 'left', 'viewer', 'questioning.Clark', 'Gable', 'handsome', 'charming', 'ever', 'remember', 'why', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'viewing', 'GWTW', 'when', 'was', 'six', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'impassioned', 'performance', 'entire', 'production', 'Yvonne', 'deCarlo', 'lovely', 'competent', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'things', 'say', 'things', ""n't"", 'tensions', 'late', 'fifties', 'precision']",Band of Angels VHS
353093,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303049001,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 7]","I find it comical that people are trying to defend this movie.  First of all, it is hilariously melodramatic to the point of camp comedy and the performances by everyone in the film are laughable.  Yvonne De Carlo is pretty yet obviously thinks that she is in a soap opera, and Clark Gable could never get the monologue right and walks around like a stiff breeze the entire film.  Sidney Poitier's character is a mess, but his performance is just as choppy, which is a shame since he also starred in `Edge of the City' this very year and delivered one of his finest screen performances.Strange.The concept of a white woman shielded from the fact that she is half black and then being ripped from her life and sold into slavery when her father dies is kind of bizarre and yet acceptable in the world of moviedom, but it never really translates well and the relationship that is born from Amantha Starr and her `master' Hamish Bond is unbelievable and kind of creepy to be honest.

353096,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,6303049001,Bert vanC Bailey,"[0, 0]","An unusual 1957 melodrama with a fairly good cast, the script for this is not free of a few groaners and a few characterizations that call for endurance. The viewers' introduction to Gable's character, for one, is of a US bully from the ""we-saved-the-world"" 1950s. Also, a very cliche'd sailor friend's drinking scene at Gable's mansion was teeth-grinding for this viewer, to say nothing of the fawning slaves who gather to sing their Mass'ahs praises.That now out of the way, there's more at work that to my mind saves this movie. Supported by Sidney Poitier and Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Clark Gable and Yvonne deCarlo play the lead pair, who openly ""live in sin"" and are otherwise reprehensible -- yet both are also portrayed sympathetically. Set in the 'Gone with the Wind' period, Gable plays an ex-slaver and cotton-grower who once prowled his plantation's slave shacks for his jollies. She is the shameful issue of a liaison with a slave on another plantation, and it's even suggested that she fools around on Gable while he's away on business.This movie's clearly no gem, but it's no dreck either (probably the main reason for my writing it is to correct some overstated disdain about it). However maudlin and overdone, its basic theme of the redemptive power of love is fairly well handled. The era and settings are unusual and atmospheric enough to hold interest, and the plot's entanglements only seldom strain credulity.This may well have been Yvonne De Carlo's highest profile film, and Gable does a fair job with an okay script from the era when the studios were struggling to survive. Sidney Poitier has a small but meaty role as an educated slave with a deep grudge. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. got his first speaking part in this film, and acquits himself smoothly with limited material. Max Steiner grinds out a spotty soundtrack that's effective in the chase scenes, though only just ...yet he never was a Miklos Rozsa or Bernard Herrmann.The Warnercolour's glorious, and the art direction is especially fine, with atmospheric scenes especially in the Gable character's New Orleans pied-a-terre and (less so) in his plantation mansion. Mind you, it's all 100% 1950s Hollywood, and very pristine and polished ...but let's not expect too much from an era when Edith Head primped up the women, and onscreen grime, sweat or facial stubble were as far off as the spaghetti westerns of the '60s -- or the cowboy noir, '3:10 to Yuma,' also from '57 ...come to think of it!'Fairly good studio film for the 50s, in short: its eventful, sometimes quirky plot, more than passable acting and some unusual settings render it quite watchable.3***",3,Intriguing '50s Gable-DeCarlo film,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,2638,"['unusual', '1957', 'melodrama', 'fairly', 'good', 'cast', 'script', 'not', 'free', 'few', 'groaners', 'few', 'characterizations', 'call', 'endurance', 'viewers', 'introduction', 'Gable', 'character', 'one', 'US', 'bully', 'we-saved-the-world', '1950s', 'Also', 'very', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'sailor', 'friend', 'drinking', 'scene', 'Gable', 'mansion', 'was', 'teeth-grinding', 'viewer', 'say', 'nothing', 'fawning', 'slaves', 'who', 'gather', 'sing', ""Mass'ahs"", 'praises.That', 'now', 'way', 'more', 'work', 'mind', 'movie', 'Supported', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Yvonne', 'deCarlo', 'play', 'lead', 'pair', 'who', 'openly', 'live', 'sin', 'are', 'otherwise', 'reprehensible', 'yet', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'Set', ""'Gone"", 'Wind', 'period', 'Gable', 'ex-slaver', 'cotton-grower', 'who', 'once', 'prowled', 'plantation', 'slave', 'shacks', 'jollies', 'shameful', 'issue', 'liaison', 'slave', 'plantation', 'even', 'suggested', 'around', 'Gable', 'away', 'business.This', 'movie', 'clearly', 'gem', 'dreck', 'either', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'writing', 'correct', 'overstated', 'disdain', 'However', 'maudlin', 'overdone', 'basic', 'theme', 'redemptive', 'power', 'love', 'fairly', 'well', 'handled', 'era', 'settings', 'are', 'unusual', 'atmospheric', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'plot', 'entanglements', 'only', 'seldom', 'strain', 'credulity.This', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'highest', 'profile', 'film', 'Gable', 'fair', 'job', 'okay', 'script', 'era', 'when', 'studios', 'were', 'struggling', 'survive', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'small', 'meaty', 'role', 'educated', 'slave', 'deep', 'grudge', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'got', 'first', 'speaking', 'part', 'film', 'smoothly', 'limited', 'material', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'out', 'spotty', 'soundtrack', 'effective', 'chase', 'scenes', 'only', 'just', 'yet', 'never', 'was', 'Miklos', 'Rozsa', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann.The', 'Warnercolour', 'glorious', 'art', 'direction', 'especially', 'fine', 'atmospheric', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Gable', 'character', 'New', 'Orleans', 'pied-a-terre', 'less', 'so', 'plantation', 'mansion', 'Mind', '100', '%', '1950s', 'Hollywood', 'very', 'pristine', 'polished', 'let', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'era', 'when', 'Edith', 'Head', 'primped', 'up', 'women', 'onscreen', 'grime', 'sweat', 'facial', 'stubble', 'were', 'far', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', ""'60s"", 'cowboy', 'noir', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'also', ""'57"", 'come', 'think', ""'Fairly"", 'good', 'studio', 'film', '50s', 'short', 'eventful', 'sometimes', 'quirky', 'plot', 'more', 'passable', 'acting', 'unusual', 'settings', 'render', 'quite', 'watchable.3***']",Band of Angels VHS

""Daniel""","[3, 5]","BAND OF ANGELS is the last film of the Clark Gable trilogy shot by Raoul Walsh between 1955 and 1957 which also includesThe Tall Men (Region One USA DVD)andKing & Four Queens. The movie is based on Robert Penn Warren'sBand of Angels (Voices of the South), a novel written in 1955. The sole extras of the DVD are a dubbed version in French language and a theatrical trailer. The quality of the images is near perfect and the sound pays tribute to a wonderful musical score composed by Max Steiner.BAND OF ANGELS, - I personally consider its racial implications as peripheral -, is a study of human reactions in front of a crisis. The main characters of the film will then all react in the same manner : by taking flight. Amantha Starr's attempts to run away constitute a sizeable part of the film, Hamish Bond, who doesn't manage to forget his heavy past, will not wait for the Confederate army to be hanged like his neighbors and Rau-Ru experiences the behavior pattern of a man who runs away from his conscience.Some will say that BAND OF ANGELS is slow and that the characters talk too much instead of acting. Maybe, maybe not. The best scenes of the films are not particularly bustling. Just think about the discussion in the garden between Hamish Bond and his old navy pal that starts in the peace of a southern night and ends up in a violent storm or about the scene of the duel between Hamish Bond and his neighbor Charles de Marigny.

One can see why.""Band of Angels"" has star power: Gable, who did not age well, is 56 here, and he looks ten years older, but he's still Gable. This is your one chance to see Sidney Poitier and Gable together. Yvonne DeCarlo is a great beauty.The film has glorious sets of the old South, lovely gowns, and a series of bodice-ripper scenes that some will find arousing.It has a tried and true bodice-ripper, romance novel plot: a woman falls in love with her rapist, and in this case, her owner: a slave trader who bought her at a slave auction.Many viewers will find this plot, though, icky, and Gable is too creaky here to ignite the kind of spark he could once ignite that will get us past the ick factor.The real problem with this movie is this: the movie thinks that it is a groundbreaking, truth-telling, realistic depiction of the horrors of the enslavement of African Americans. It's not, though. Rather, it is a tragic display of white denial.I know what you're thinking. ""This reviewer is politically correct!"" The thing is, I'm not politically correct at all. ""Gone with the Wind"" is one of my favorite movies.But ""Gone with the Wind"" has tremendous narrative and archetypal power that transcends its unrealistic portrayal of slavery.""Band of Angels"" has no such power.Its ""realistic"" and ""truth telling"" depiction of slavery includes the following:In the opening scene, two slaves are shown running away. They, like the other slaves in the movie, are very well dressed. Even GWTW has the decency to show slaves in ragged clothing.Read descriptions of how real slaves actually dressed. They dressed in rags, or in nothing at all.The runaways walk tall and quick. Their body movements announce that they consider themselves to be the equal of their captors.Again, even GWTW depicted the deferential walk and posture that slaves had to adopt. Read Richard Wright. Blacks in the South had to assume a different posture and walk just to survive, right up until the Civil Rights Movement.The runaway slaves' owner decides to punish them -- by having them pull weeds!  Read any honest history of slavery. Runaway slaves were punished with horrible tortures. ""Pulling weeds"" was not one of them.There is one bad white Southerner in the movie. Like most of the other men in the movie, he tries to rape Yvonne DeCarlo. She easily rebuffs him. Millions of real slaves were not so lucky.Most of the white Southerners in the movie are well meaning, and most of the slaves are happy. Carolle Drake, whose dignified performance is the best thing about the movie -- it is a real tragedy that this is the only film she ever made -- plays a slave woman who is in love with her owner. She is light skinned, and is allowed to be dignified. Other, darker slaves are shown as idiotic and animal-like, or as so overjoyed by the presence of their slave owner that they burst into spirituals.Sidney Poitier plays a slave who has been treated well by his master, Clark Gable.Poitier repays Gable for this excellent treatment by scheming for Gable's death. It is only when Gable reveals that he is Poitier's father that Poitier realizes his appropriate love for the man who owned him and raped his African mother.In the film's capstone scene, where Gable talks about the horrors of the slave trade, Gable describes savage Africans as doing most of the dirty work. Gable, poor, innocent white slave trader, physically fights against the Africans who are savaging their own people in order to supply him, Gable, with human cargo.For any decent person, watching this scene of white denial is gut wrenching.Finally, Yankees arrive. They are every bit as bad as the Yankees in GWTW. The poor, stupid slaves who welcome their arrival, Gable intones, are not intelligent enough to realize how lucky they had it under their beneficent Southern owners.Again, if you like seeing beautiful women in pretty costumes, and if you want to see Yvonne de Carlo's bodice ripped -- six or seven -- I lost count -- men in the film attempt to have their way with her -- and if ""woman falls in love with rapist"" plots are your cup of tea, and if you can ignore the nauseating denial that underlies this exercise, then you may enjoy this movie.Otherwise, it is more of sociological interest than aesthetic.",2,"Twisted, Grotesque Artifact of White Denial",1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,4848,"['Band', 'Angels', '1957Directed', 'Raoul', 'WalshStarring', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo',

Phelps,"[0, 0]","Band of Angels is a movie with a central theme comparable to a historical novel based on fact.Clark Gable's role as Hamish Bond is a two-fold character with a very valid message of whatwas in error during the Civil War both with the Confederacy and the Union.  The Confederacywas condemned for its enslavement of Negros and Indentured servitude of poor whites.  TheUnion did not have an unblemished record because it exploited Negro labor, and carpet-baggedthe South into poverty which really saw no relief until World War I and World War II.  This includesa prison system which exploited labor of prisoners for ill-gotten gain, with some remnants whichremain in existence today.  During the150th Anniversary of the Civil War which is supposedlycelebrated, I contend it should be a time of solemn regret over Americans killing Americans.I had ancestors who fought on both sides,and branches of my family tree died because the menwere killed and whole household wiped out by disease.  A DVD movie like Band of Angels cancause all of us to take the time to walk the battlefields - both North and South - to resolve never again -regardless of race, creed or gender - Americans shall not kill Americans again.

It grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.It is a captivating story about a young southern belle who was raised on a plantation in KY with everything that a young girl of privilege could ask for. Her father completely adores and dotes on her and she has known nothing but a life of ease that is until the death of her father. That is when everything that Amantha has ever known becomes unraveled and she is pitched headlong into a nightmare. It is cruely and heartlessly revealed that Amantha's mother was in fact a slave and although she looks white she is half black. Her father was deeply engrossed in debt unbeknownst to Amantha and most of his assets are having to be sold to pay his debts. And because of her mixed blood she too is seen as part of his &#34;property&#34; and is to be sold like all of the other slaves that he owned.She is forcefully removed from her home and sent to New Orleans where she is put up on the auction block like any other common slave. Amantha's being a very beautiful young woman and being able to pass for white means that she is a much sought after prize for whomever wins the bid for her. When the lears and calls for all of the &#34;merchandise&#34; to be shown so that they can know what they are bidding on begins Amantha is horrified and completely shamed. Enter Hamish Bond who quickly starts the bidding and outbids everyone else paying an amazingly exorbient price for her. When he takes her to his home naturally Amantha expects the worst. What she finds is a man haunted by his own past who doesn't try to force himself on her and showers her with kindnesses that most would never even think of giving a slave. However nice Hamish appears to be he still bought and paid for her and Amantha doesn't know if she can ever get past that no matter how handsome and generous a master he is he is still just that...her master.The Civil War soon breaks out and things get more difficult for both Hamish and Amantha. Also Hamish's past could be an insurmountable obstacle for their fledgling love.Are these two lost souls destended to be together or will the Civil War claim them both as it has countless others.Both Clark Gable and Yvonne De Carlo are wonderful in this film. Their chemistry leaps off the screen and you can't help but root for them. Sidney Poitier also appears as Rau-Ru another of Hamish's slaves who though Hamish has lavished on him and treated him more like a son that a slave Rau-Ru still harbors a deep resentment and even hatred for him as his master.It truly is a diamond in the rough and one not to be missed if you enjoy period movies with romance and a touch of action thrown in for good measure,5,Great movie that has largely been overlooked,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2747,"['one', 'rare', 'movie', 'gems', 'many', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'grabs', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.It', 'captivating', 'story', 'young', 'southern', 'belle', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'plantation', 'KY', 'everything', 'young', 'girl', 'privilege', 'could', 'ask', 'father', 'completely', 'known', 'nothing', 'life', 'ease', 'death', 'father', 'when', 'everything', 'Amantha', 'ever', 'known', 'becomes', 'unraveled', 'pitched', 'headlong', 'nightmare', 'cruely', 'heartlessly', 'revealed', 'Amantha', 'mother', 'was', 'fact', 'slave', 'white', 'half', 'black', 'father', 'was', 'deeply', 'engrossed', 'debt', 'unbeknownst', 'Amantha', 'most', 'assets', 'are', 'having', 'be', 'sold', 'pay', 'debts', 'mixed', 'blood', 'too', 'seen', 'part', '34', 'property', '34', 'be', 'sold', 'other', 'slaves', 'forcefully', 'removed', 'home', 'sent', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'put', 'up', 'auction', 'block', 'other', 'common', 'slave', 'Amantha', 'being', 'very', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'able', 'pass', 'white', 'means', 'much', 'sought', 'prize', 'whomever', 'bid', 'When', 'lears', 'calls', '34', 'merchandise', '34', 'be', 'shown', 'so', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'bidding', 'begins', 'Amantha', 'horrified', 'completely', 'shamed', 'Enter', 'Hamish', 'Bond', 'who', 'quickly', 'bidding', 'outbids', 'everyone', 'else', 'paying', 'amazingly', 'exorbient', 'price', 'When', 'home', 'naturally', 'Amantha', 'worst', 'What', 'man', 'haunted', 'own', 'past', 'who', ""n't"", 'try', 'force', 'showers', 'kindnesses', 'most', 'would', 'never', 'even', 'think', 'giving', 'slave', 'However', 'nice', 'Hamish', 'be', 'still', 'bought', 'paid', 'Amantha', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'ever', 'get', 'matter', 'how', 'handsome', 'generous', 'master', 'still', 'just', 'master.The', 'Civil', 'War', 'soon', 'out', 'things', 'get', 'more', 'difficult', 'Hamish', 'Amantha', 'Also', 'Hamish', 'past', 'could', 'be', 'insurmountable', 'obstacle', 'fledgling', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'destended', 'be', 'together', 'will', 'Civil', 'War', 'claim', 'countless', 'others.Both', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'are', 'wonderful', 'film', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'also', 'Rau-Ru', 'Hamish', 'slaves', 'who', 'Hamish', 'lavished', 'treated', 'more', 'son', 'slave', 'Rau-Ru', 'still', 'deep', 'resentment', 'even', 'hatred', 'master.It', 'truly', 'diamond', 'rough', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'enjoy', 'period', 'movies', 'romance', 'touch', 'action', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure']",Band of Angels VHS

I would have to compare it with &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; only I think Band of Angels is more thought provoking.The plot involves a pre-Civil War Southern belle (whose father has sent her to school in the north which should give you a hint) who returns to Kentucky when her father falls ill.  She arrives to see him being buried, and immediately afterwards hears first that her father was bankrupt and all the slaves will be sold and then that she herself is the child of a slave woman and therefore she too will be sold.  It seems her father had an affair with a mulatto slave and raised the child as if the mother had been white and married to him.  He has (somewhat unbelievably) concealed this from his child, who doesn't understand why her mother is buried outside the family cemetery.  Our beautifully-dressed belle ends up being literally sold down the river -- she leaves pleasant Kentucky to be sold on a New Orleans auction block. (The further south you got, the worse conditions were: the other slaves are probably going to end up on a mosquito-infested sugar cane plantation and face a much worse fate than she does, but the movie fails to make this point). It's an eye-opener how particularly shocking the slave auction is when an apparently white woman is being auctioned -- which gives a lot of insight into subliminal racism.Although a bit dated at parts (the music at the beginning, for example, and the scenes with the slaves singing like a choir), this is a very thought-provoking and yet entertaining movie.

353138,A1DZSBTVCJ883,6303049001,W. Walker,"[5, 6]","At last, available on DVD! We have quite a range of reactions to this film, from the greatest film ever to the worst film ever seen. I like to see it every now and then. In fact, I prefer it to the more polished ""Gone with the Wind"". Yes, Clark Gable is no longer the swaggering brawler, man of action and lady killer of the '30s. Here, we have a more mature and weathered Gable who has settled down to the genteel life of a southern plantation owner, after a financially successful life as a rough and tumble Yankee slave trader. Yet, he is still something of a rebel. He has a guilty conscience about his former life as a ruthless slave trader and wants to make partial amends by treating his large group of slaves decently. In fact, he plans to leave his estate to one. He tends to see the born southern aristocracy as decadently effete, as exemplified by his neighbor, who takes a liking to his recent light-skinned mulatto acquisition(Yvonne de Carlo,as Amantha). Clearly, Gable, as Hamish Bond, has no interest in supporting the recent unsettling changes on the political scene and impending Civil War. He recognizes that these events will probably end his idyllic life and that the lives of most of his slaves will likely be changed for the worse if they are liberated by Yankee troops. Perhaps he recognized that secession failed to solve the looming problem of a lack of new territories for the expansion of plantation slavery, thus depressing the value of young surplus slaves. Perhaps he also recognized that a separate South impeded the legal demands slave owners could make in recapturing slaves who escaped the Confederacy. On the other hand, Hamish refuses to support the cause of the Yankee troops who want to sell his soon-to-be harvested cotton. He risks execution in burning his crop and much of his equipment.Hamish rescues, in dramatic fashion, a beautiful cultivated mulatto(Yvonne de Carlo, as Amantha) from a fate she could not bear, although she initially shows no gratitude. He doesn't require than she become his mistress and in fact gives her a chance to escape his world, but she has a last minute change of heart and remains with him. Amantha has experienced two benevolent slave owners: her father and Hamish. This is in marked contrast to her treatment as a slave on the auction block.The dialogue makes it clear that Hamish and her father were rather exceptional in this regard. Thus, I don't buy the criticism that this film provides an unrealistically rosy picture of the typical lives of slaves. The film makes the viewer feel deeply the horror of a sudden change in status from a southern belle to a life-long slave. If you want a much more extreme example, read the book ""Skeletons in the Zaraha"", in which  shipwrecked Yankee sailors are transformed into barely living slaves of fearsome tribes or Arabs near the coast of northwest Africa.The relationship between Hamish and his slave and appointed successor Rau-Ru(Sidney Poitier) is another key element of this story. Rau-Ru hates the institution of slavery and Hamish even more for his rather successful attempt to make slavery agreeable to his slaves. The fact that Hamish has willed him as his successor does not change Rau-Ru's attitude. The last portion of the film deals mainly with the back and forth relationships between Rau-Ru, as a now Union soldier, and Hamish and between Amantha and Hamish and a certain Caucasian Union soldier.
