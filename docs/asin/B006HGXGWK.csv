It gets an A for effort and if it ever becomes a live action budgeted movie, it would be the most horrendous and most celebrated thing to ever hit the horror/gruesome thing to come out in theaters, I doubt most people can even keep there sanity after watching this version.

First off some chit stain typed the animation was ""primitive"", that would be too nice. Its misleading since when I read ANIMATION I think old school 2D Disney. Nope, this is horrible computer generated graphics. I mean its not even good,bad, its just bad. An arm will bleed into the head or other graphics just dont work. Here is a tip for voice casting too since this was made in some guys basement on a Commodore 64, when you cast an actor for a little boy, USE A WOMANS VOICE! That took me out of the movie right off. Oh and making a loud scary voice saying the same thing 20 times in a row is not scary its annoying.This was a waste of 15 bucks and just a horrible mess. We get it...you're into Satan.

1515513,A2BYFF97CPQT44,B006HGXGWK,C. Bennett,"[14, 16]","I'm going to start off this review by saying I don't really care for animation.Yes, I said it.  With the exception of a few of the films I grew up with, animated films do not interest me.So with that said, a film like Where the Dead Go To Die would typically go totally unnoticed by me, which is a real pity because it's depressingly wonderful.  It's surreal, violent, and at times outrageous.  When it first started the look of the animation got to me.  It's very primitive(think ReBoot.)  However as the film progressed I realized the look of the animation fit the tone perfectly...Some of the images presented in this movie are completely deranged, the fact that it's looks like a kids movie is completely jarring.I'm not going to go into too much detail about the film as I think it's best to go in knowing as little as possible, but I will tell you this...There is a talking dog who is interdimensional. A group of troubled kids.  Enough bestiality, murder, and all around violent material to offend the most seasoned gorehound.  Did I mention the talking dog?  He likes to convince children their unborn brother is the Anti-Christ.  I couldn't make this stuff up, I'm not that imaginative, so my only advice is to run out and pick this one up!Onto the disc itself.  Unearthed did a great job with this title.  The film looks and sounds great (there's also a blu-ray available)  It is presented in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 sound, some of the extras include..-Commentary with the director-Deleted scenes-featurettes-A Short-TrailersUnearthed Tends to put a lot of work into their releases and this one is no different!I mentioned earlier, going into this movie I was not a fan of animation...Now I realize there are some stories that are completely suited for this medium.  There's no way they could have pulled this off using actors.

1515514,A38M5MDKKKTB14,B006HGXGWK,"C. Fjerstad ""TROLL BLOOD""","[3, 4]","First I just want to say, I cannot believe how many people take the time to purchase or watch this film and they can't determine whether or not they are going to love or hate it before doing so. Just upon seeing the trailer, I knew it would likely be a disturbing one-of-a-kind experience that just might take things to a level of darkness I hadn't been to before - and it was exactly that. Who are these people complaining about horrible animation and a horrible story - did you NOT NOTICE the style of animation before you PURCHASED the movie? Did you not READ the synopsis before you purchased it? How do you not understand that the BUTCHERED style of animation goes perfectly in accompanying the BUTCHERED atmosphere, portraying the BRILLIANTLY INNOVATIVE (not terrible) plot concepts dealing with a BUTCHERED psyche. Hint to people who gave this one star: get better at knowing yourself. Get better at knowing what's for you, and what's not. This movie is a sheer masterpiece of it's own kind, I have never seen anything like it. It's perfect for what it is. For me personally, it is my FAVORITE FILM of 2012 thus far.This is what the Silent Hill film should have felt like. Perhaps not with such over-the-top, disturbing content and subject matter - but the atmosphere and creativity of this film is 100% dead on - couldn't possibly be more shocking, discomforting, confusing, or eerie. It just reminds me of the very first time I played the first couple of Silent Hill games - that's why I was talking about the film as well. Not many things that exist match this level of creative darkness.The actual subject matter truly takes it to the next level in a few areas as well - we'll just say brutal gore and sexual scenarios involving people who should not be in sexual scenarios with each other. That is the aspect that reminded me of Gummo and other similar films by similar filmmakers such as Harmony Korine or Larry Clark. Couldn't get much more offensive or disturbing.Now, one of the only flaws in the entire movie is a few of the voice actors are a little hard to deal with - but that's not enough to even force me to give it a 9 instead of a 10. This is a one-of-a-kind experience, and it's surreal - bad voice acting just adds to the absurdity of it.The concepts are extremely innovative and thought provoking - offering perspectives you most likely would not have thought of before involving God, death, and .... well, the damaged psyche.I would never recommend this to anyone - but, if you're looking for trouble, you will find it here.Props mr. ScreamerClauz ....
