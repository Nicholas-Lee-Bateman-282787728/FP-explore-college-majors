The interview parts are greatly inferior to ""The Story of UFO"" VHS (WHERE IS THAT DVD?!?!?) One thing that really bugs me though, and no one else has mentioned, is the fact that the idiots that put this thing together couldn't even find a correct photo to put on the cover!!!! Even looking at a thumbnail photo, it's obviously Paul Chapman next to Pete Way. I'm always suspicious of products that make mistakes such as this, fortunately, this one WAS worth it.

910985,A2Y5OSMCM4XX9N,B0009QZ48I,"Metaljim ""Jim C.""","[30, 30]","I read the other reviews here and took a chance on this DVD. I am very glad I did. I was 17 when I first got into UFO via their ""Phenomenon"" LP and have remained a loyal fan ever since. I bought this DVD with absolutely no interest in the review of the Strangers In The Night album, nor the opinions of the various commentators. No, I bought this to travel back in time. I was only 17 or 18 and had been a UFO fan for a little while, when I heard they were going to be on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. I stayed up the night they were scheduled to be on, with my handheld tape recorder at the ready. The show finally came on and I started taping away. I watched the show that night on my parents black and white television and it was the only time I ever saw that footage. For the next 30 years, the only evidence I had to prove that they'd really appeared on there was my horrible sounding cassette. So I bought this DVD from Caiman.com and it only took a couple of days before it was in my hands. My hands were shaking and my mind was reeling as I placed the DVD in my player. Would it play? Would it be the right gig? Would the songs really be complete? To make sure, I watched it from beginning to end. The reviewers do a decent job covering the long and complex history of UFO, referencing their discography with song clips and the occassional photo. So that part is ok, no problems. Now, to the bonus tracks! I watched, in order, in full color, the entire DKRC show I last saw when I was 17, 31 years ago. Amazing, simply amazing! Give Her The Gun, Space Child, Doctor Doctor, and Rock Bottom. The only footage I've seen from the Schenker-era four piece UFO. I have additional Schenker footage from '75 and '77,with Danny Peyronnel, then Paul Raymond, but had always assumed this DKRC was lost forever. Well, it's not! It alone is completely worth the price you pay for this DVD. As an added bonus, you get a look at the original line-up from the Beat Club 1971, performing an almost 7 minute Boogie For George. Splendid stuff, just splendid. The bonus footage concludes with a lip-sync version of Only You Can Rock Me, which is nice but not essential. If you are a long term fan, this is absolutely essential, no doubt. For a newer fan, it's still fairly essential, because it shows a wonderfully talented rock band doing what they do best, rocking a crowd. Wonderful stuff and I doubt you'll find many other archive releases with material this exciting. Just buy it!If I had one complaint, it would be the choice of footage. I have two short television performances from 1975 and 1977, that would have covered the Strangers In The Night album material much better. I give the producers kudos for exhuming the long lost DKRC tapes, but it's too bad these other two Schenker-era shows couldn't have been added as well. Then I would have been in heaven!",4,A trip back in time!,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2856,"['read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'took', 'chance', 'DVD', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'was', '17', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'UFO', 'Phenomenon', 'LP', 'have', 'remained', 'loyal', 'fan', 'ever', 'bought', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'interest', 'review', 'Strangers', 'Night', 'album', 'opinions', 'various', 'commentators', 'No', 'bought', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'was', 'only', '17', '18', 'had', 'been', 'UFO', 'fan', 'little', 'while', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'Don', 'Kirshner', 'Rock', 'Concert', 'stayed', 'up', 'night', 'were', 'scheduled', 'be', 'handheld', 'tape', 'recorder', 'ready', 'show', 'finally', 'came', 'started', 'taping', 'away', 'watched', 'show', 'night', 'parents', 'black', 'white', 'television', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'footage', 'next', '30', 'years', 'only', 'evidence', 'had', 'prove', ""'d"", 'really', 'appeared', 'was', 'horrible', 'sounding', 'cassette', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Caiman.com', 'only', 'took', 'couple', 'days', 'was', 'hands', 'hands', 'were', 'shaking', 'mind', 'was', 'reeling', 'placed', 'DVD', 'player', 'Would', 'play', 'Would', 'be', 'right', 'gig', 'Would', 'songs', 'really', 'be', 'complete', 'make', 'sure', 'watched', 'beginning', 'end', 'reviewers', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'covering', 'long', 'complex', 'history', 'UFO', 'referencing', 'discography', 'song', 'clips', 'occassional', 'photo', 'part', 'ok', 'problems', 'Now', 'bonus', 'watched', 'order', 'full', 'color', 'entire', 'DKRC', 'show', 'last', 'saw', 'when', 'was', '17', '31', 'years', 'ago', 'Amazing', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Give', 'Gun', 'Space', 'Child', 'Doctor', 'Doctor', 'Rock', 'Bottom', 'only', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Schenker-era', 'four', 'piece', 'UFO', 'have', 'additional', 'Schenker', 'footage', ""'75"", ""'77"", 'Danny', 'Peyronnel', 'then', 'Paul', 'Raymond', 'had', 'always', 'assumed', 'DKRC', 'was', 'lost', 'forever', 'Well', 'not', 'alone', 'completely', 'worth', 'price', 'pay', 'DVD', 'added', 'bonus', 'get', 'look', 'original', 'line-up', 'Beat', 'Club', '1971', 'performing', 'almost', '7', 'minute', 'Boogie', 'George', 'Splendid', 'stuff', 'just', 'splendid', 'bonus', 'footage', 'lip-sync', 'version', 'Only', 'Can', 'Rock', 'Me', 'nice', 'not', 'essential', 'are', 'long', 'term', 'fan', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'doubt', 'newer', 'fan', 'still', 'fairly', 'essential', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'rock', 'band', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'rocking', 'crowd', 'Wonderful', 'stuff', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'find', 'many', 'other', 'archive', 'releases', 'material', 'exciting', 'Just', 'buy', 'had', 'one', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'choice', 'footage', 'have', 'two', 'short', 'television', 'performances', '1975', '1977', 'would', 'have', 'covered', 'Strangers', 'Night', 'material', 'much', 'better', 'give', 'producers', 'kudos', 'exhuming', 'long', 'lost', 'DKRC', 'tapes', 'too', 'bad', 'other', 'two', 'Schenker-era', 'shows', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'added', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'heaven']",N/A
