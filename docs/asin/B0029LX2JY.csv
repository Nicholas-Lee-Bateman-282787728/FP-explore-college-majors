Willie wants desperately for someone to save him. That's when Gooby shows up. A big, loveable, scruffy creature (who may just be as frightened of the world as Willie is of space aliens) to provide comfort and companionship to a beleaguered young boy. ""Gooby"" is a fully featured theatrical production starring Matthew Knight as Willie and Robbie Coltrane as the voice of Gooby. This flawless DVD edition of a thoroughly entertaining family movie has a total running time of 99 minutes and is very highly recommended as an enduringly popular addition to community library DVD collections.",5,Very highly recommended as an enduringly popular addition to community library DVD collections,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,756,"['When', 'Willie', 'parents', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'youngster', 'convinced', 'place', 'fairly', 'evil', 'aliens', 'outer', 'space', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'harm', 'Willie', 'desperately', 'someone', 'save', 'when', 'Gooby', 'up', 'big', 'loveable', 'scruffy', 'creature', 'who', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'as', 'frightened', 'world', 'Willie', 'space', 'aliens', 'provide', 'comfort', 'companionship', 'beleaguered', 'young', 'boy', 'Gooby', 'fully', 'featured', 'theatrical', 'production', 'starring', 'Matthew', 'Knight', 'Willie', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'voice', 'Gooby', 'flawless', 'DVD', 'edition', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'family', 'movie', 'total', 'running', 'time', '99', 'minutes', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'enduringly', 'popular', 'addition', 'community', 'library', 'DVD', 'collections']",Gooby

Everywhere I have seen Gooby described, the word ""monster"" is used, but he is just a very large teddy bear.  My children were expecting a monster and got an oversized stuff animal.
