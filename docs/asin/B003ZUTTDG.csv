1378307,AVFERHF47H0YW,B003ZUTTDG,blakmira,"[3, 5]","Here we have a &#34;documentary&#34; in which some guy with the passion and metabolism of a rock claims to have suddenly woken up one day with the ability to see a nonstop parade of spirits, auras and all kinds of floating things. First off, I have no doubt that there is an &#34;ethereal&#34; spiritual realm that can't be seen with the naked eye in the everyday world. However, I believe anyone claiming to have 24/7 access to this realm is either lying and/or trying to perpetrate a fraud (especially if there is some financial profit to be gained, like selling a movie) -- but I am willing to give anyone a chance to prove otherwise.But check out his resume -- he's already been in the film business for eight years before he &#34;woke up&#34; and got the idea to cash in on this topic! What a fortuitous coincidence! Unfortunately, he has no spark, no lucidity, no epiphany or evidence that he's in awe of these bizarre ghosts he claims to see constantly or that he's even frightened. No NDE, no hallucinogenic shamanic trance experience, no sudden head trauma -- nothing that would have explained or facilitated this miraculous &#34;condition.&#34;Needless to say, as I watched this slack-jawed slacker and his girlfriend have the most mundane conversations about his sudden ability to see angels, orbs and ghosts, my fraud-detection antennae were on high alert. Even though I'm pretty good at reading liars, I'd also say they were both pretty darn bad actors (and yes, I believe she was definitely in on the script).Fast forward through a bunch of brain tests showing no &#34;abnormalities,&#34; talks with shrinks, a trip to Italy to take ridiculous photos with infrared Photoshopped fractal-things(!!!), &#34;enlightenment workshops&#34; and woodsy experiences, and at the end he's the same dullard he was at the beginning. Don't waste your time with this fraud.

1378308,A2RO8EN0LD5AQO,B003ZUTTDG,Christine,"[1, 1]",This guy is awesome and he has a great story. I'm glad he shared it. It's about time people do. He takes you on a metaphysical journey that only those who are gifted can experience. You get to see what he experiences first hand in his daily life and the challenges it brings. It's exactly what you or I would do. Then he shows you where he makes peace with his gift. I think this would help others in similar situations.,5,He is one cool dude,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,420,"['guy', 'awesome', 'great', 'story', ""'m"", 'glad', 'shared', 'time', 'people', 'do', 'metaphysical', 'journey', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'gifted', 'can', 'experience', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'first', 'hand', 'daily', 'life', 'challenges', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Then', 'where', 'peace', 'gift', 'think', 'would', 'help', 'others', 'similar', 'situations']",Wake Up
1378309,AREKMQY4P5BP0,B003ZUTTDG,"Elizabeth Bean ""ebean""","[52, 58]","Spiritual journeys can certainly happen to those least expecting it. Here is the perfect example on DVD. I will leave it to other reviewers here to add their insights and accounts, but what is important to me is that Jonas put it on the line, and shared what he was going through, without worrying about image. It's the honesty of his account on film that makes this a special documentary. Through the course of the documentary you will see a tremendous healing, of finally letting go of age old dogmas and attitudes, and joy at the start of a new life. Letting go resistance is at the base of a spiritual journey, and that's so evident in Jonas' honesty.I also want to share that Jonas' humor adds a special quality that lightens the early journey. After a screening of the documentary he did a Q&A; with over 600 in the audience. In reviewing where his journey was currently he mentioned several things, but I think the humor will give you an idea of what to expect in the film. He said he was careful now to avoid limiting or bad attitudes about anything...and in a nutshell, he realizes that all people are actually in the same swimming people, and he doesn't want to be the one peeing in the pool! He was infectiously kind to everyone, and now wise enough to know that everyone asking a question at the Q&A; is also himself asking about himself. That showed us his awakening continues after making this film. Isn't that how we make more sense of all the entities that cross our path for a moment or as a family member throughout a lifetime? Indeed.He said the journey has made him a softer and more loving man. You could sense that especially having seen the first years of his experiences in the documentary. The director showed us his love was there early on, but blocked and distracted by social stigmas, dogmas, family expectations, attitudes etc...well doesn't that sound like the early spiritual journey of everyone? The success of the film is that it makes a spiritual journey approachable to everyone, and most viewers should be able to relate to Jonas' transformation and perhaps set out to free their mind to create an amazing new lives even if that is their least expectation of themselves.",5,An Honest Account of a Spiritual Journey,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,2206,"['Spiritual', 'journeys', 'can', 'certainly', 'happen', 'least', 'expecting', 'Here', 'perfect', 'example', 'DVD', 'will', 'leave', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'add', 'insights', 'accounts', 'what', 'important', 'Jonas', 'put', 'line', 'shared', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'worrying', 'image', 'honesty', 'account', 'film', 'special', 'documentary', 'course', 'documentary', 'will', 'see', 'tremendous', 'healing', 'finally', 'letting', 'go', 'age', 'old', 'dogmas', 'attitudes', 'joy', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Letting', 'go', 'resistance', 'base', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'so', 'evident', 'Jonas', 'honesty.I', 'also', 'want', 'share', 'Jonas', 'humor', 'special', 'quality', 'early', 'journey', 'screening', 'documentary', 'did', 'Q', 'A', '600', 'audience', 'reviewing', 'where', 'journey', 'was', 'currently', 'mentioned', 'several', 'things', 'think', 'humor', 'will', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'said', 'was', 'careful', 'now', 'avoid', 'limiting', 'bad', 'attitudes', 'anything', 'nutshell', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'same', 'swimming', 'people', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'one', 'peeing', 'pool', 'was', 'infectiously', 'kind', 'everyone', 'now', 'wise', 'enough', 'know', 'everyone', 'asking', 'question', 'Q', 'A', 'also', 'asking', 'showed', 'awakening', 'making', 'film', ""n't"", 'how', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'entities', 'cross', 'path', 'moment', 'family', 'member', 'lifetime', 'Indeed.He', 'said', 'journey', 'made', 'softer', 'more', 'loving', 'man', 'could', 'sense', 'especially', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'years', 'experiences', 'documentary', 'director', 'showed', 'love', 'was', 'there', 'early', 'blocked', 'distracted', 'social', 'stigmas', 'dogmas', 'family', 'expectations', 'attitudes', 'etc', 'well', ""n't"", 'that', 'sound', 'early', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'everyone', 'success', 'film', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'approachable', 'everyone', 'most', 'viewers', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'Jonas', 'transformation', 'perhaps', 'set', 'out', 'free', 'mind', 'create', 'amazing', 'new', 'lives', 'even', 'least', 'expectation']",Wake Up
1378310,A3DV9WABIVDWGJ,B003ZUTTDG,"Mr. Rex ""Rex""","[0, 2]","Searching through what to watch either on a service like netflix or through your own rather extensive library (if you have one) can be a time-consuming task. I generally tend to prefer the off-the-beaten-track types of films that usually explore something different that isn't normally covered by the mainstream. I was looking through dvds and found this one. The reviews were both good and bad with more good than bad. The description I read was something to the effect of &#34;Man suddenly develops the ability to see ghosts, angels, and demons.&#34;... and that was it. I thought Hmmm.. it also seemed to fall into the documentary category so that got me even more interested.Got to watch it last night. I really enjoyed watching this film and here is why:(1) Topic that is not really covered anywhere else (that I know of) in a documentary style film. There are some variations but this one is unique.(2) Characters are not actors but real people having to deal with something outside their world view. The viewer tags along as the main character tries to make sense of his 'new life'. Who is this guy? Well for me, he was just a normal guy - a fact that I connected to right away. I could see genuine feelings in what was going on rather than acting. The guy doesn't claim to be an expert or even know what he is experiencing.(3) Didn't want to stop watching it. Rarely do I see a film that makes me want to keep watching it that is a documentary. I was really interested in what was going on.(4) Takes a different turn than expected but resonated with me quite well.I definitely recommend this film if you are interested in the paranormal subjects + spirituality. This one does something different that may have not sit well with those looking for sensationalism. For me, I could relate to what was happening and what the people were going through, even though I haven't had those experiences.Excellent film.",5,I really enjoyed watching this,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,1914,"['Searching', 'what', 'watch', 'either', 'service', 'netflix', 'own', 'rather', 'extensive', 'library', 'have', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'time-consuming', 'task', 'generally', 'tend', 'prefer', 'off-the-beaten-track', 'types', 'films', 'usually', 'explore', 'something', 'different', ""n't"", 'normally', 'covered', 'mainstream', 'was', 'looking', 'dvds', 'found', 'one', 'reviews', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'description', 'read', 'was', 'something', 'effect', '34', 'Man', 'suddenly', 'ability', 'see', 'ghosts', 'angels', 'demons.', '34', 'was', 'thought', 'Hmmm..', 'also', 'seemed', 'fall', 'documentary', 'category', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'interested.Got', 'watch', 'last', 'night', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'here', 'why', '1', 'Topic', 'not', 'really', 'covered', 'anywhere', 'else', 'know', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'are', 'variations', 'one', 'unique', '2', 'Characters', 'are', 'not', 'actors', 'real', 'people', 'having', 'deal', 'something', 'world', 'view', 'viewer', 'tags', 'main', 'character', 'tries', 'make', 'sense', ""'new"", 'life', 'Who', 'guy', 'Well', 'was', 'just', 'normal', 'guy', 'fact', 'connected', 'right', 'away', 'could', 'see', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'rather', 'acting', 'guy', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'expert', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'experiencing', '3', 'Did', ""n't"", 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'Rarely', 'do', 'see', 'film', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'documentary', 'was', 'really', 'interested', 'what', 'was', 'going', '4', 'different', 'turn', 'expected', 'resonated', 'quite', 'well.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'interested', 'paranormal', 'subjects', '+', 'spirituality', 'one', 'something', 'different', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'looking', 'sensationalism', 'could', 'relate', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'going', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'experiences.Excellent', 'film']",Wake Up

We have an unkempt and (from all of his out of state trips) likely unemployed loser, who claims to see demons, angels and extradimensional phenomena.  Anybody can claim anything.  From the interviews with apparent experts, it appears he is not a traditional nut case.  Okay, how about he is an out an out con artist?  And after visiting a wide range of self appointed gurus from a wide range of ""traditions"" what is the final verdict our bargain basement spiritual journeyman comes up with?  Religions are all pointing to the same direction, but the religions themselves are not the truth.  Gee, anybody ever hear that one before? How come nobody put this bozo on a lie detector?  I thank all of the gods, demons, angels, and extradimensional beings out there that I happened to catch this one on netflix, and it didn't cost me any extra (dimensional) money.
