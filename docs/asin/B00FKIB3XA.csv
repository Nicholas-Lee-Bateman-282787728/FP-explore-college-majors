1671826,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,B00FKIB3XA,JLR,"[21, 63]","Black Sabbath are one of the greatest rock bands of all time and even to this day, they still deliver a hell of a show. Their latest CD, ""13"", was a triumphant return to form after the middling Sabbath and Ozzy records in the 1990s and early 2000s. When news came out that ""Black Sabbath Live...Gathered in Their Masses"" was coming on Blu-Ray, I was psyched because I heard a lot of good things about their Melbourne concert. It also helped that my mother was a huge Sabbath fan and wanted me to buy this for her for Christmas. I was excited......until I saw the price.I mean, $30 for a Blu-Ray disc completely devoid of extras? Are you kidding me? And that's if you're a Prime member. The original price is actually $40 (and if Amazon is sensible, they'd prevent that price from happening). As one Amazon.com reviewer pointed out, it's ridiculous that they charged a bare-bones 190-minute Blu-Ray for $30, but Rush's ""Clockwork Angels"" Blu-Ray, which is longer and loaded with special features, is only $20. Even more offending is that the DVD version costs half. Why would you buy $15 more for a Blu-Ray that has no more special features or extras than the DVD version? Does Vertigo/Republic honestly think that this will encourage buyers to upgrade to Blu-Ray? You're better off wasting money on buying ""13"" three times.Some will defend the price because the Blu-Ray has better picture and audio quality. Bullocks. If it was $5 more, it'd be one thing, but $15? By comparison, the DVD version of Rush's ""Clockwork Angels"" was only a mere $2 less. You only spend $15 more if it was in a deluxe box-set, not on a single Blu-Ray with zero extra content.One customer commented that you just wait til the prices go down. If so, then I'll do it. But if prices do not go down by the time Christmas comes, then I'm just going to purchase the DVD version. What an insult to the fans and to the customers.",1,$30 for a bare-bones Blu-Ray?
