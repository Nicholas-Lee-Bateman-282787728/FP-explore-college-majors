Amat ""Mugetsu""","[0, 1]","I'm having difficulties putting my finger on just what exactly about this movie I despise...Lets see, could it be that the male lead has the mannerisms of a neurotic Napoleon Dynamite?Or maybe how the ""Oh so hot!"" female lead is so ""EDGY"" and has a cool name like Galaxy,and awesome fake tattoos which she feels the need to show off by rolling up her sleeve?I'm pretty sure everyone in this production was so enamored with this girl, they forgotshe was way to clean to be a geocacher or a Carnie...oh wait she's not a carnie, she's aSplinter head...way edgier, a hustler, a scam artist...a thief...hmm...But i digress,Maybe, it was that for a movie clearly made to entertain college kids, the only likeablecharacters were the adults? WAIT! I think we may have hit on something here...Could it be that it's because all the young people in this film save for the male leadand his admittedly funny best friend ""MMM...this sandwhiches are sooo tasty!"" all areinsufferable ******bags whom can only communicate with each other through thick sarcasmand insulting quips?For example, at a certain point in the film the male lead is called to do somethinghe has clearly never done before and is understandably apprehensive. A nearby pair of""oh so edgy"" girls, never having met him or seen him before, feel the need to spoutemasculating insults at him. Completely oblivious that they are in optimal position tohave their heads soccer kicked into broken necks...I've also noticed that other low score reviews complaining about the lame profanityhave been down voted...hmm I wonder by who?

1315522,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0030IUQ7Q,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 1]","This is an Indy flick that is too self conscious. It's trying to be wow and now but it all seems too obvious.Here's the scoop. Justin is a nice guy in up-state New York. He's kind of a schlub. He has no particular talents or aspirations. He works for a buddy who owns a lawn care service, but he's pretty much confined to mowing duties. His dad's dead. He lives with his mom and is afraid to lose her to a local cop who has eyes on her. He gets smitten with Galaxy who is working with a carnival that is passing through. They sort of hook up and various adventures ensue.This is a very uneven film. Some of the performances (Rachel Taylor, Dean Winters and Chris McDonald) are decently written and acted. Others (Tom Middleditch and Lea Thompson) just aren't happening. Justin (Middleditch) goes through no transformation. Though he has one shining moment (through a fluke) he's the same aimless dweeb at the end as he is in the beginning. Why should Galaxy want to be with him? Some of the plot developments didn't allow me to suspend my disbelief. The grandpa was unbelievable. Pamela Shaw, as the aunt, was a cardboard cutout. It just seemed to miss the mark at most every turn.This was decently shot and edited. The music was okay. But in the end, I couldn't do much more than shrug my shoulders. Had I not seen it, I couldn't say I'd missed anything important. This isn't a bad watch.

I don't think my husband and i spent more than a few minutes not laughing at this delightfully funny comedy. The actors were perfect and believable and the setting made it even funnier. Loved the geocaching parts as well it tied everything together nicely and taught me a little about something i didn't even know existed. This will have you laughing til the end.

1315526,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0030IUQ7Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","Sort of a cross between ""Adventureland"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""Splinterheads"" is a tremendously appealing indie comedy about a spastic, perennially put-upon doofus named Justin (Thomas Middleditch) who falls victim to some unscrupulous carnies who come to town.  One of them is a beautiful young con artist who goes by the stage name Galaxy (played by the radiant Rachael Taylor), who has a domineering boyfriend (the wonderful Dean Winters from ""Rescue Me""), and who sees qualities in Justin that others, including the lad himself, cannot.  (A ""splinterhead,"" apparently, is a worker at a carnival who specializes in roping in easily spotted suckers from the crowd).Middleditch hits all the right notes in making the bumbling, stuttering, well-meaning Justin a wholly likable and wholly relatable figure.  Ditto for the rest of the cast, which includes Jason Rogel as his even dorkier best buddy, Wayne; Christopher McDonald as the town's petty and overzealous sheriff; Edmund Lyndeck as Justin's 116-year-old great-grandfather; Lea Thompson as his mom; and Jason Mantzaukas and Lennon Parham as a third-rate magician and his devoted assistant.Writer/director Brant Sersen nicely captures the flavor of the rural, small town environment in which the film's set, and while he may make amusing caricatures out of his characters, he never feels the need to dehumanize or talk down to them - or to us, for that matter.  The humor always remains sharp and observant, and the movie provides some pretty solid laughs throughout.Check it out.",4,surprisingly endearing little comedy,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,1538,"['Sort', 'cross', 'Adventureland', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Splinterheads', 'tremendously', 'appealing', 'indie', 'comedy', 'spastic', 'perennially', 'put-upon', 'doofus', 'named', 'Justin', 'Thomas', 'Middleditch', 'who', 'victim', 'unscrupulous', 'carnies', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'One', 'beautiful', 'young', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'stage', 'name', 'Galaxy', 'played', 'radiant', 'Rachael', 'Taylor', 'who', 'domineering', 'boyfriend', 'wonderful', 'Dean', 'Winters', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'who', 'qualities', 'Justin', 'others', 'including', 'lad', 'can', 'not', 'splinterhead', 'apparently', 'worker', 'carnival', 'who', 'roping', 'easily', 'spotted', 'suckers', 'crowd', '.Middleditch', 'right', 'notes', 'making', 'bumbling', 'stuttering', 'well-meaning', 'Justin', 'wholly', 'likable', 'wholly', 'relatable', 'figure', 'Ditto', 'rest', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Rogel', 'even', 'dorkier', 'best', 'buddy', 'Wayne', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'town', 'petty', 'overzealous', 'sheriff', 'Edmund', 'Lyndeck', 'Justin', '116-year-old', 'great-grandfather', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'mom', 'Jason', 'Mantzaukas', 'Lennon', 'Parham', 'third-rate', 'magician', 'devoted', 'assistant.Writer/director', 'Brant', 'Sersen', 'nicely', 'flavor', 'rural', 'small', 'town', 'environment', 'film', 'set', 'may', 'make', 'amusing', 'caricatures', 'characters', 'never', 'need', 'dehumanize', 'talk', 'matter', 'humor', 'always', 'sharp', 'observant', 'movie', 'pretty', 'solid', 'throughout.Check', 'out']",Splinterheads
1315527,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B0030IUQ7Q,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[3, 5]","I was not a huge fan of the other amusement park/carnival film made last year, and even though this was one had a much lower budget, it comes across as more believable.The story follows some small-town lifers as their paths cross with a traveling carnival crew in life changing ways. The premise mixes a small bit of romantic comedy with white-trash drama, but through the course of humorous and sobering events, the lives of our two unlikely leads become intertwined - possibly for the long term. In comparison to Adventureland, this ending is much more palatable and believable.The picture quality is actually solid throughout, including the various night and indoor sequences. The sound is an average 5.1, with a couple challenges. The special features center on the character I cared about the least (the Amazing Steve magician guy) as it shows a couple shorts; one of him practicing holding his breath for the movie stunt, and one of him changing his name - legally. Both skippers. The Gag Reel lasts a few more minutes and has some funny outtakes. There are optional Spanish subtitles for the film.Some fun performances from known actors (Dean Winters, Chris Macdonald, Lea Thompson and the Transformers gal Rachel Taylor) and a few unrecognized newcomers (Middleditch, Rogel). Some nice filming locations in rural New York coupled with a decent script and crisp picture make for a recommendable watch. As a side note, one of the film's central themes is geocaching, so if you enjoy that past time - you will dig this film.
