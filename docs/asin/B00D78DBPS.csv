We have the whole collection from The Princess and the Pauper to the newer fairy editions. Of course, no one can do magic like Barbie and Barbie Mariposa and the Fairy Princess is no exception. Mairposa has already had her share of adventures. but its not over yet for this sparkling fairy. This time around, she is named the Royal Ambassador of Flutterfield. Her job is to help ensure peace with the Crystal Fairies, but she makes a few mistakes and not everything goes according to plan. Even  though she befriends the princess Catania, she finds herself banished from fairyland. Of course that doesn't stop Marisposa from rushing to their aid when a dark fairy threatens all of fairyland.Even as an adult. I just loved this movie. The colors are striking and vibrant and the cast of characters are instantly endearing. I especially love Marisposa's little sidekick Zee who stands by her side no matter how much trouble she gets into. There is lots of action and adventure, which the underlying message that even if you're different, you can still be friends. My younger daughter loved it and would watch it six times a day if I let her and even my teenager grudgingly admits she enjoyed it.

1654089,A1KA6VB86QW121,B00D78DBPS,T-Square,"[0, 0]","Mariposa is back! This time as the Royal Ambassador of Flutterfield sent to bring friendship to rival kingdom Shimmervale. Here, despite her best efforts, she is greeted with antipathy and suspicion by its residents and King. This is only made worse when Mariposa's wings (made bigger and better in her first movie adventure) become a liability; clumsily knocking over the king's tea and turning her chilly welcome into a rather hot one. But when her mission of peace seems destined to fail, she is befriended by Princess Catiana, the one voice of reason in a kingdom overrun by paranoia and distorted perceptions over the Butterfly Fairies of Flutterfield. Together, these fairy princesses work against all odds to promote peace and understanding.Looming in the background, the real threat; a terrible dark fairy, threatens to undo Shimmervale by turning all their magic glowing crystals, the source of their livelihood, into dark, lifeless stones. This storyline, brought about by the king's refusal to offer her a small crystal years earlier, runs parallel to Mariposa's quest for understanding and illustrates another instance where a little friendship can make a big difference. Here, for the gift of a single crystal to a stranger, the king could have made a powerful friend rather than a powerful enemy. It takes Mariposa and Catiana to undo this oversight and restore peace.This of course doesn't justify the evil deeds of the Dark Fairy or her attempts to destroy Shimmervale because her denied request for a magic crystal years ago. And while she may have gone overboard in the revenge department (without which we wouldn't have a story) it's not a matter of ""Give me what I want or else"" but the failure of a king to show common courtesy to a stranger with the smallest act of kindness, the kind of gesture that would have made Mariposa feel welcome and at home in a foreign land.This illustrates the bottom line of the story; fear is bad, friendship is good. Treat a stranger with friendship and, more often than not, it will be returned in kind. Suspicion and hatred, same thing. Barbie's quote at the end of the credits is ""The best way to make a friend is to be a friend"" and that sums it up to perfection.
