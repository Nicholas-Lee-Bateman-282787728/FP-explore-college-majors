At one point they have a racecar driver put a BMW through its paces on a course, then the two guys try to duplicate what the driver did with a '70's Lincoln and then a '70's Buick.Occasionally insightful as they whip super cars around a test track (in slow motion).

1660754,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,B00DRU8VRY,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[0, 0]","Pretty much every year a couple of the Top Gear presenters get together to do some sort of tie-in to the main show, but outside of a series. Much like the May and Hammond 'At the Movies'. Here we have Jeremy Clarkson and James May and they are out to find an answer to the question of what is the worst car in the history of the world.Now things start off with a range of truly terrible cars being trotted out and their faults mercilessly exposed and these cars are from fairly.... non mainstream manufacturers may we say. The boys soon ditch this schtick however as they point out that while the terrible cars they started discussing were bad they were at least cheap. So they turn their attention to lemons made by manufacturers that should have known better. All sorts of famous makes are lampooned for the car in their range that just didn't hit the spot. Again the chaps are brutally honest.At the end they select one car and a special fate is reserved for it. And no that doesn't mean a piano falls on it like Top Gear usually do with Morris Mariners (and no the worst car in the world is not that - it wasn't a spoiler!).If you like Top Gear and the personalities and the style of the show this is a safe buy.",4,Another special in the Top Gear production line,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1216,"['Pretty', 'much', 'year', 'couple', 'Top', 'Gear', 'presenters', 'get', 'together', 'do', 'sort', 'tie-in', 'main', 'show', 'series', 'Much', 'May', 'Hammond', ""'At"", 'Movies', 'Here', 'have', 'Jeremy', 'Clarkson', 'James', 'May', 'are', 'find', 'answer', 'question', 'what', 'worst', 'car', 'history', 'world.Now', 'things', 'start', 'range', 'truly', 'terrible', 'cars', 'being', 'trotted', 'faults', 'mercilessly', 'exposed', 'cars', 'are', 'fairly', 'non', 'mainstream', 'manufacturers', 'may', 'say', 'boys', 'soon', 'ditch', 'schtick', 'however', 'point', 'out', 'terrible', 'cars', 'started', 'discussing', 'were', 'bad', 'were', 'least', 'cheap', 'turn', 'attention', 'lemons', 'made', 'manufacturers', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'sorts', 'famous', 'are', 'lampooned', 'car', 'range', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'spot', 'Again', 'chaps', 'are', 'brutally', 'end', 'select', 'one', 'car', 'special', 'fate', 'reserved', ""n't"", 'mean', 'piano', 'Top', 'Gear', 'usually', 'do', 'Morris', 'Mariners', 'worst', 'car', 'world', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'spoiler', '.If', 'Top', 'Gear', 'personalities', 'style', 'show', 'safe', 'buy']",Top Gear The Worst Car in the History of the World
