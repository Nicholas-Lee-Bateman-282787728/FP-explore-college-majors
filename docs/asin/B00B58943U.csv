The story was really good, the acting and special effects were very well done.  From the description it sounded like it might be a cheap movie with no plot.  We were quite surprised.  The only problem that I had is that they messed with the sound volume too much and you have to watch it with your finger on the volume.  When they talk it is quiet and during the action/horror scenes it was very loud.The scary scenes were done very well and we did get a few jumps here and there.  A lot of times I said ""that part was pretty cool"".  I would recommend it.  It is even good for mid to late teenagers, probably not for kids younger than high school age.Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!",4,Great for a low budget film!,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,781,"['wife', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'anticipated', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'description', 'sounded', 'might', 'be', 'cheap', 'movie', 'plot', 'were', 'quite', 'surprised', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'messed', 'sound', 'volume', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'watch', 'finger', 'volume', 'When', 'talk', 'quiet', 'action/horror', 'was', 'very', 'loud.The', 'scary', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'get', 'few', 'jumps', 'here', 'there', 'lot', 'times', 'said', 'part', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'would', 'recommend', 'even', 'good', 'mid', 'late', 'teenagers', 'probably', 'not', 'kids', 'younger', 'high', 'school', 'age.Give', 'shot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Curandero: Dawn Of The Demon

1622043,A331S5N5PNSOV0,B00B58943U,"N. Pawar ""thestoneman""","[2, 2]","This is a low budget b-horror movie (from mexico I suppose based on the location).  While it's not high brow stuff for what it is, it's a decent horror/drama movie.  There's shades of a lot of older horror movies from the direction and gore similar to the grindhouse genre and lucio fulci's movies.  I personally can't stand watching fulci movies (to me the plot drags too much) but this one was somewhat better paced and decently watchable.  I guess you could call it a hybrid movie because it takes a lot of the older conventions in this genre and lumps them together; it works in this case and the practical effects are top notch for this budget (there was zero cgi from what I could tell).Personally, I find a lot of these plots, situations, and actions (in these types of movies) preposterously hilarious and this movie delivers them intentionally or unintentionally.  Early on in the movie police officers won't enter their police station because of the bloodbath that took place, so the main character ""purifies"" the station and to prove it is purified he takes a bucket of body parts from the bloodbath and dumps them down the steps; it doesn't sound really funny but it was to me.  Then all of a sudden (in the middle of a gunbattle) when the main character is scared out of his mind, he suddenly takes a gun, becomes an expert marksman, and kills most of the attacking bad guys with assault rifles without cover single shot per guy!  They go to visit don chi chi, the leader of a mythra cult, in a graveyard and he's a just sitting on top of a crypt to keep ""an enemy"" at bay and apparently he lives on a chair on top of a grave marker.  There is a lot of this kind of humor in this movie; preposterous and ridiculous situations.You basically have a mexican ""preacher"" (or maybe practitioner of folk magic is a better definition) who has to bring a serial ritualistic (?) murderer and his cult to justice (pretty much).  Lot's of gore, some decent action, and the plot is somewhat different than most horror movies I've seen.You can either watch it with subtitles or dubbed.  The dubbing and transcription for the english subtitles are pretty well done (I usually watch movies with english subtitles even when they're speaking english).  They're dubbed with a bit of a ""spanish"" accent so it feels more authentic than just pulling in people without accents to do the dubbing work (this movie takes place in mexico).",4,Not bad for what it is; Fulci-esque.  4.3 stars.,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,2425,"['low', 'budget', 'b-horror', 'movie', 'mexico', 'suppose', 'based', 'location', 'not', 'high', 'brow', 'stuff', 'what', 'decent', 'horror/drama', 'movie', 'shades', 'lot', 'older', 'horror', 'movies', 'direction', 'gore', 'similar', 'grindhouse', 'genre', 'lucio', 'fulci', 'movies', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'fulci', 'movies', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'was', 'somewhat', 'better', 'paced', 'decently', 'watchable', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'hybrid', 'movie', 'lot', 'older', 'conventions', 'genre', 'lumps', 'together', 'case', 'practical', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'budget', 'was', 'zero', 'cgi', 'what', 'could', 'tell', '.Personally', 'find', 'lot', 'plots', 'situations', 'actions', 'types', 'movies', 'preposterously', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'intentionally', 'unintentionally', 'Early', 'movie', 'police', 'officers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enter', 'police', 'station', 'bloodbath', 'took', 'place', 'main', 'character', 'purifies', 'station', 'prove', 'purified', 'bucket', 'body', 'parts', 'bloodbath', 'dumps', 'down', 'steps', ""n't"", 'sound', 'really', 'funny', 'was', 'Then', 'sudden', 'middle', 'gunbattle', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'scared', 'mind', 'suddenly', 'gun', 'expert', 'marksman', 'most', 'attacking', 'bad', 'guys', 'assault', 'rifles', 'cover', 'single', 'shot', 'guy', 'go', 'visit', 'don', 'chi', 'chi', 'leader', 'mythra', 'cult', 'graveyard', 'just', 'sitting', 'top', 'crypt', 'keep', 'enemy', 'bay', 'apparently', 'chair', 'top', 'grave', 'marker', 'lot', 'kind', 'humor', 'movie', 'preposterous', 'ridiculous', 'situations.You', 'basically', 'have', 'mexican', 'preacher', 'maybe', 'practitioner', 'folk', 'magic', 'better', 'definition', 'who', 'bring', 'serial', 'ritualistic', 'murderer', 'cult', 'justice', 'pretty', 'much', 'Lot', 'gore', 'decent', 'action', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'different', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen.You', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'dubbed', 'dubbing', 'transcription', 'english', 'subtitles', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'usually', 'watch', 'movies', 'english', 'subtitles', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'speaking', 'english', ""'re"", 'dubbed', 'bit', 'spanish', 'accent', 'more', 'authentic', 'just', 'pulling', 'people', 'accents', 'do', 'dubbing', 'work', 'movie', 'place', 'mexico']",Curandero: Dawn Of The Demon

Potty mouthed detective Magdalena (Gizeht Galatea) goes back to her home town to find Don Carlos, a curandero. What she gets is his son, also named Don Carlos (Jos&eacute; Carlos Ruiz). Don Carlos is a bit of a skeptic, but also has visions of demons as he touches items. His twofold nature wasn't utilized to it comic potential.This twosome follows the trail of the evil Castaneda as they try to figure up what he is up to.This film was made in 2005. While it has blood and gore, it lacks the killing and mutilation scenes common in the American counterpart. For some strange reason, the film tosses in a guy (Ernesto Y&aacute;&ntilde;ez)  who is the only person in Mexico who believes in Mithraism. I didn't get his connection.The film is slow developing and half way into the production you realize it is not getting better. Still, it had some interesting scenes which involve confrontations between Castaneda and Don Carlos that are in part a vision. Without these scenes the film would be a total waste.The film is dubbed in both English and Spanish with English having a good translation. Not on my recommended list.
