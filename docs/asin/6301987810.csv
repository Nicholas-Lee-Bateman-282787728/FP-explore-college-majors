289164,AVQLXZ04FK0UV,6301987810,"Classic Movie Fan ""Classic Movie Fan""","[1, 1]","First, this DVD played flawlessly for me.  So those who complain about DVD quality either have a defective disc or -- more likely -- the wrong settings on their players.  The quality of the print is related to the quality of the film as it was first produced, so, no, it isn't crisp and clear.  I am glad this was filmed in B&W; instead of color.  The story comes forth more in this format.WARNING:  A few spoilers appear below.I really like this movie.  it is one of my favorites. One must pay attention to the details or it won't make a lot of sense.  It is a ""watch it more than once"" film to really appreciate all the fine acting.  All the actors in this film do a great job -- the character actors are all pros.  One sees them in a lot of films from the 50s and 60s.  Kevin McCarthy, Walter Matthau, George Kennedy, Leif Erickson, Walter Abel, Jack Weston, etc.  They are all believable in their roles.  What more do you want?  Harry Rhodes' doing a police report for Peck is superb.  You believe he really is a police officer.  (How many producers and directors in 1965 cast a black actor as a police officer?)  Diane Baker and Peck do a great job, as usual.Yes, the plot is confusing and there are continuity slip ups, like when Peck talks to Abel's widow and says he has never heard of Unidine when in a flash back he said ""I don't work for Unidine anymore . . .""  (This is after he recovers his memory.)The score by Quincy Jones is wonderful.  It is romantic and promising when it needs to be so one can identify with poor Peck who has lost his memory but still maintain hope that he and Baker will somehow get together.Director Dmytryk did not dumb down the plot for the audience.  Too bad so many new movies hit one over the head with plot points instead of respecting the intelligence of the audience to figure it out.Peck's character's anti-nuclear weapon position doesn't come forth until the end of the film -- but his willingness to be killed instead of revealing the secret of a ""no fallout radiation"" nuclear weapon is a powerful statement which provokes thought about the use of nuclear devices in general.Some films are just ""watch and be entertained.""  And that's a good thing.  This isn't one of them.Having to pay attention to ""get it"" is sometimes the way to go. Try it.

289165,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6301987810,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 3]","When the lights suddenly go out in a New York skyscraper at dusk, two things happen. Charles Calvin, noted world peace advocate, falls to his death from his 27th floor office. It's a long way down. And David Stillwell (Gregory Peck) finds himself wandering around the building, convinced he's an accountant at Garrison, Ltd., but not sure where he is. People he doesn't know seem to recognize him, yet the only person he knows is his boss, Sylvester Josephson (Kevin McCarthy), the man David is sure hired him as an accountant two years earlier. All the while people are moving around holding candles or flashlights, trying to decide if they should try walking down 27 flights of stairs or join the Braille party (it's played in the dark by touch) in a boardroom. Stillwell makes it to his apartment. He finds the refrigerator bare and a thug holding a revolver. The next day (having beaten the thug and dragged him out), David realizes he has no memory of the last two years. He winds up hiring Ted Caselle, a private investigator (Walter Matthau), to find out what's going on. All David knows is that there is an attractive young woman (Diane Baker) who shows up whenever people around him get killed. As time goes by, there are more and more corpses. There's also a shadowy presence referred to as ""The Major,"" a man we later learn has the improbable name of Crawford Gilcuttie. The Major seems to be a man prepared to protect his power, his business interests and his prospects.""Unconscious amnesia can exist for an hour or two, sometimes on rare occasions a day or two. But two years? Impossible!"" says a doctor David went to for help. A couple of days later, David begins to remember...Mirage is a nifty piece of thriller/murder entertainment. It works as well as it does because of a clever story of conspiracy, egomania and cold-blooded killing. Mirage is not as stylish as Charade, just about as well-crafted as Spellbound (including the amnesia but without the psychobabble), more intriguing than Arabesque...and just as nice a murderous, vicious puzzle as the three of them.Unfortunately, there are few sparks between Diane Baker, the female lead, and Peck. But Peck does have old-fashioned star quality, and it easily carries him and the movie through. The movie depends on Peck...but also on two other actors. Kevin McCarthy and Walter Matthau. McCarthy plays an opportunistic, weak business executive more full of ""ciao, baby"" than ethics. He was a fine actor, at 94 he still is, and never was able to get beyond star-quality character roles. Matthau is Matthau, likeable, skeptical, unique. This was the last non-lead movie part he played (although he gets an end-of-credits billing that's as big as Peck's). The two perk things up every time we see or hear them. So do the three killers with unpleasant personalities who are after David. They're played by a chortling Jack Weston, a ruthless George Kennedy and an ancient, complaining House Jameson.Peck centers the movie. Matthau and McCarthy give it a lot of juice. Only one thing really dates Mirage. When David Stillwell visits a doctor's office, the receptionist looks at him and says, ""Go right in. The doctor is waiting to see you."" Been a long time since that's happened.The movie is available in DVD as one of six in the Gregory Peck Film Collection set. The DVD has no extras. The movie was shot in New York City, and all those wet, crowded streets, financial district towers and tenements look just fine.",4,Falling 27 floors isn't all that bad.

Mirage was a bit better, because I understood for the most part what was going on.I've wanted to see this film for some time. I enjoyed Diane Baker in Marnie and The Horse in the Grey Flannel Suit, and I love Gregory Peck. The story sounded quite good, etc. So when I saw it at our favourite rental haunt I wanted to bring it home.While I won't say that I was wildly let down by this film, I cannot really say it was great. I didn't think it was particularly Hitchcock-y, as the box said.For the first while, it was O.K. being in the dark about what was going on, but when it goes on for an hour and twenty minutes and still no hint as to what is happening, that's gone too far. Diane B. wasn't really a big part and all the good people get killed. The character of Calvin was a bit fuzzy. Was he at heart really good or really bad? Perhaps I just missed something.I felt that overall the filming was very good and tight - I liked the way the film would cut from the present to things Gregory's character was remembering. It was strange to see tacky 60's hairdos and clothes in black and white. There wasn't anything too gory, but there was some language that I didn't appreciate.Not sure really what else to say about this film...

The plot is repetitive at times, but director Edward Dmytryk soaks the entire film in a feeling of claustrophobic creepiness, and  Gregory Peck and Walter Matthou give excellent performances.After a blackout at the building where he works, David Stillwell (Peck) is greeted by a woman he doesn't recognize, goes down to a sub-basement that doesn't exist, his job doesn't exist, and finds that his apartment apparently hasn't been lived in. Oh, the head of his company also plunges to his death that very night. And a mysterious gunman is suddenly trying to kill and/or capture him.But when David goes to talk to the police and a shrink, he realizes something shocking -- he can't remember anything of his life until two years ago. And after hiring a private eye (Matthau), he discovers that apparently a conspiracy is erasing all signs of his prior existence.... and yes, more hit men have been sent after him, at the command of the mysterious ""Major.""""Mirage"" is a good film, though not quite good enough to stand among the titans of the suspense movie like ""Charade"" or ""The Man Who Knew Too Much."" Edward Dmytryk's talent is in making the entire film feel like a long nightmare, in which everything is dangerous and/or uncertain. And he peels away the layers of conspiracy and delusion with a slow, deft hand, tricking us with misconceptions and half-truths at every turn.However, it also can be rather repetitive (how many times can Shela appear, say vague sinister stuff, and then vanish?) and has some moments that are just too convenient (a small child randomly appears so Peck and his girlfriend can hide in her apartment).But if the movie is flawed, Gregory Peck's performance is not. He starts the performance as a nice, slightly confused man, but his performance gradually mutates into a wild-eyed, harrowed man who can't run or hide. You really feel sorry for him, especially when it starts making him look a little insane -- and even frames him for homicide.Diane Baker's role is basically that of a designated love interest, but Walter Matthau is delightful as a quirky, oddball detective who defies all tropes. I was actually rather sad when Matthau exited the film, because he was so much fun.

The problem is: He doesn't know he has a secret, because he is suffering from amnesia.  Thus begins this psychological thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, set in New York City in the mid 1960s.Peck, feeling that he's lost his grip on reality, and needing to actualize his existence, starts down the path of reconstructing his life.  Because he has amnesia, he can't remember having any friends.  He visits a psychiatrist (played with passion and intelligence by Robert Harris) and hires an easy-going private eye (Walter Matthau) to investigate who he really is, and find out his identity.  Early on, he runs into old flame, Sheila, played by the beautiful and underrated Diane Baker (fresh off of Hitchcock's dark ""Marnie"").  She turns out to be even more of a cipher than Peck, refusing clues to his queries about his identity.  ""I want to remember who I am!"" Peck rages at Baker.  Her tortured reply singularly sums up his bizarre and paradoxical world: ""Not remembering is the only thing keeping you alive!""So, as you can see, this is a neat twist on the amnesia flick, and I'm going to stop here, because I don't want to give any more of the plot of ""Mirage"" away.  The intelligent script by Peter Stone (Charade) moves alternately fast-and-furious/ slow-and-langorous. ""Mirage"" is chock full of great performances:  George Kennedy and Jack Weston give two of the best portrayals of sociopathic, ruthless hired killers ever; Leif Erickson stars as ""The Major,"" an equally ruthless industrialist bent on prying the secret loose from Peck's clouded mind; Kevin McCarthy is glib and smarmy as the sycophantic Josephson and Walter Abel is suave and conflicted as Peck's mentor, Charles Calvin.Director Edward Dmytryk -- best known for his masterwork ""The Caine Mutiny,"" and blacklisted during the McCarthy years -- directed ""Mirage"" really tight: There are no dissolves; every cut is literally a cut, and the breakneck pace of the chase scenes further establishes Peck as a man alone, being kept on a long leash.  Dmytryk broke with tradition by editing even the flashback scenes with straight cuts, and it works beautifully.Notching the tension up even further is Quincy Jones' jazzy and urbane soundtrack, which draws on the ""crime jazz"" genre created by Elmer Bernstein and Henry Mancini and looks forward to Jones' own soundtrack for ""In the Heat of the Night.""That ""Mirage"" isn't even currently in any release is perplexing.

This is an intriguing and taut film of psychological suspense that those who enjoy the films of Alfred Hitchcock will like.",4,A MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE...,1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,1537,"['suspenseful', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'redolent', 'Hitchcock', 'centers', 'David', 'Stillwell', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'remembers', 'very', 'little', 'psychiatrist', 'little', 'help', 'there', 'psychiatrist', 'David', 'being', 'trouble', 'law', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'sort', 'fake', 'psychiatric', 'defense', 'something', 'psychiatrist', 'part', 'then', 'hires', 'Private', 'Detective', 'Ted', 'Casselle', 'engagingly', 'played', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'discover', 'just', 'who', 'really', 'When', 'David', 'being', 'followed', 'two', 'hard', 'bitten', 'thugs', 'unlikely', 'names', 'Lester', 'Willard', 'menacingly', 'played', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'events', 'film', 'start', 'really', 'heat', 'up.As', 'David', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'disturbing', 'past', 'trying', 'reinstate', 'present', 'David', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'enmeshed', 'life', 'death', 'struggle', 'sort', 'woman', 'named', 'Sheila', 'played', 'fresh', 'faced', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'life', 'warnings', 'danger', 'even', 'least', 'paranoid', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'heed', 'almost', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'were', 'being', 'played.As', 'David', 'remember', 'more', 'past', 'places', 'people', 'events', 'were', 'bring', 'present', 'state', 'David', 'danger', 'deception', 'closer', 'home', 'thought', 'intriguing', 'taut', 'film', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'who', 'enjoy', 'films', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'will', 'like']",Mirage VHS

I had to rent the VHS from Scarecrow Video, and because it was their only copy -- and long out of print -- they made me put down a $100 deposit on the tape.That's how much I love this movie.The movie has a palpable sense of vertigo about it (pun intended) where accountant David Stillwell suddenly realizes that two years of his life are missing.  He sets out to fill in what his amnesia has removed, and all sorts of dangerous situations result.  The Hitchcockian direction by Edward Dmytryk, the performances by Peck, Baker, Matthau, Weston, Kennedy & Erickson, the Herrmannesque score by Quincy Jones, the eerie black & white photography, the imaginative staging, the use of sound effects, the unforgettable images of watermelons...
