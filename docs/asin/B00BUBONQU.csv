1639102,ACT23DA95IX31,B00BUBONQU,Book-Movie-Music Lover,"[9, 11]","This movie is a real ""sleeper"" - and I mean that in the sense that not too many people seem to know about it, not that it is a movie that will put you to sleep.I rented it, not expecting too much, but was delightfully surprised. It is well-written, with solid and believable dialogue. All of the characters are absolutely lovable, which is unusual in a film. You just feel for everyone and all of the things they are going through. And everyone's acting is first-rate. No real screw-ups in that department.The only downside is that it takes a bit of work during the beginning of the movie to figure out who everyone is, how they are related, and how their lives intersect. However, once you've gotten that figured out, the rest of the movie is just really enjoyable and engaging.Hats off to everyone who was involved in it. Definitely worth a look!",4,Charming and Delightful,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,848,"['movie', 'real', 'sleeper', 'mean', 'sense', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'know', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'put', 'sleep.I', 'rented', 'not', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'delightfully', 'surprised', 'well-written', 'solid', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'are', 'absolutely', 'lovable', 'unusual', 'film', 'just', 'feel', 'everyone', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'everyone', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'real', 'screw-ups', 'only', 'downside', 'bit', 'work', 'beginning', 'movie', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'everyone', 'how', 'are', 'related', 'how', 'lives', 'intersect', 'However', 'once', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'figured', 'out', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'Definitely', 'look']",The Wedding Party
