1065381,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000OU0826,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This is a dark farce that doesn't amount to much more than a one trick pony.Here's the scoop. Scott Speedman and Wes Bentley play Dexter and Royce, a couple of junkies who are trying to bury their friend Matilda's (Taryn Manning) body because they think she's overdosed. During the near burial they witness the ritual killing of a guy by the hands of a Satanist cult. Add to that the fact they are into a local thug for $8,000.00 with the clock ticking fast and you're off to the races.As I mentioned, this is a farce. The various factions need to get things done quickly. The cultists need to off the stoners. The stoners need to crack a safe for the money to get the thug off their case. They run all over Ontario and sometimes there are near misses, while other times they connect with dizzying results. Other characters, who are only peripherally involved, enter the fray at various levels with ....weird results. This starts out as a lot of fun. Speedman and Bentley play well off each other. Most of the other characters are written well, but it starts to get tired after awhile. Royce's utter stupidity and constant misquotes turn from funny to bothersome about half way through things. The fact that Dexter doesn't haul off and whack him is curious further still. And when the ""little people's"" Medieval Reenactment Troupe enters the picture, all bets are off.I enjoyed this enough. The acting, directing, music etc. are all decent. And I liked the characters. There just doesn't seem to be much up or down in it all. It's a series of set pieces where the dynamic is nearly flat. And the end. Unless I read this wrong, it seemed to be saying it's better to go through life as a drug addict. Didn't get that. This is a decent, likable movie. Just don't expect much out of it.",3,Weird is the Operative Word Here,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,1782,"['dark', 'farce', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'trick', 'pony.Here', 'scoop', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'play', 'Dexter', 'Royce', 'couple', 'junkies', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'bury', 'friend', 'Matilda', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'body', 'think', 'overdosed', 'near', 'burial', 'witness', 'ritual', 'killing', 'guy', 'hands', 'Satanist', 'cult', 'Add', 'fact', 'are', 'local', 'thug', '8,000.00', 'clock', 'ticking', 'fast', ""'re"", 'races.As', 'mentioned', 'farce', 'various', 'factions', 'need', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'quickly', 'cultists', 'need', 'off', 'stoners', 'stoners', 'need', 'crack', 'safe', 'money', 'get', 'thug', 'off', 'case', 'run', 'Ontario', 'sometimes', 'are', 'near', 'misses', 'other', 'times', 'connect', 'dizzying', 'results', 'Other', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'peripherally', 'involved', 'enter', 'fray', 'various', 'levels', '.weird', 'results', 'out', 'lot', 'fun', 'Speedman', 'Bentley', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'well', 'get', 'tired', 'awhile', 'Royce', 'utter', 'stupidity', 'constant', 'misquotes', 'turn', 'funny', 'bothersome', 'way', 'things', 'fact', 'Dexter', ""n't"", 'haul', 'off', 'whack', 'curious', 'further', 'still', 'when', 'little', 'people', 'Medieval', 'Reenactment', 'Troupe', 'picture', 'bets', 'are', 'off.I', 'enough', 'acting', 'directing', 'music', 'etc', 'are', 'decent', 'liked', 'characters', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'where', 'dynamic', 'nearly', 'flat', 'end', 'read', 'wrong', 'seemed', 'be', 'saying', 'better', 'go', 'through', 'life', 'drug', 'addict', 'Did', ""n't"", 'get', 'decent', 'likable', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much']",N/A

1065383,A2M8O1WZRXMRQ9,B000OU0826,Jose Jones,"[0, 1]","I'm always interested to see what Wes Bentley (an actor who basically disappeared after hitting it big with ""American Beauty"") is up to, and I was particularly intrigued by the idea of him doing a comedy.  I'm used to just about every film, even tiny ones, opening somewhere in New York.  When ""Weirdsville"" was released, I looked it up online and found that it was playing in one theater... in Kansas.  That's truly stretching the idea of a theatrical release.""Weirdsville"" is a dark comedy about two drug addicts (as much heroin addicts as potheads) by the names of Royce (Wes Bentley) and Dexter (Scott Speedman).  They owe money to a drug dealer, and when they cannot pay him back he employs them as dealers.  But Royce's girlfriend accidentally ODs on the dealer's drugs and they decide to bury her at an abandoned drive-in, where Royce once worked.  Unfortunately for them, Royce's old boss is there as well performing a Satanic sacrifice.  The Satanists believe they've brought Royce's girlfriend, Matilda (Taryn Manning), back to life and now need her to complete their sacrifice.Royce and Dex also have their eyes on a safe locked away in someone's house.  And there's a gang of little people running around who do medieval reenactments.  Yeah, it's one of THOSE movies.One long night.  Lots of misadventures and odd connections between the characters and a plot that closes in on itself.I found the most entertaining part of this movie to be Bentley, who seems very comfortable playing a scatter-brained druggie who is as dumb as he is screechy.  There are times where he infuses a stoner's sense of disregard that lifts the movie into something very funny.Allan Moyle manages to put together sequences that are visual feasts.  But, oddly, he doesn't work the same magic when filming the simple scenes, and I often found that the comic timing in the film was off.  There were clearly some funny moments in Willem Wennekers' screenplay that Moyle didn't understand or couldn't pull off.  It leads to a bit of awkwardness.Moyle assembles a fine cast here.  I loved Greg Bryk's performance as the head Satanist as a put-upon priss.  Bryk seemed to get the tone of the material just right -- as did Bentley -- though you can't say that of everyone involved.In the end, ""Weirdsville"" is more amusing than ever really sustainably funny.  The actors do a good job, but it felt like it could have used a little more to it.But I would recommend seeing it.  Especially if you like watching drug addicts too stupid to be scared bounce from one crazy catastrophe to the next.",3,A mildly amusing black comedy starring Wes Bentley.,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,2573,"[""'m"", 'always', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'actor', 'who', 'basically', 'disappeared', 'hitting', 'big', 'American', 'Beauty', 'was', 'particularly', 'intrigued', 'idea', 'doing', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'used', 'just', 'film', 'even', 'tiny', 'ones', 'opening', 'somewhere', 'New', 'York', 'When', 'Weirdsville', 'was', 'released', 'looked', 'up', 'online', 'found', 'was', 'playing', 'one', 'theater', 'Kansas', 'truly', 'stretching', 'idea', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Weirdsville', 'dark', 'comedy', 'two', 'drug', 'addicts', 'much', 'heroin', 'addicts', 'potheads', 'names', 'Royce', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Dexter', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'owe', 'money', 'drug', 'dealer', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'pay', 'back', 'dealers', 'Royce', 'girlfriend', 'accidentally', 'ODs', 'dealer', 'drugs', 'decide', 'bury', 'abandoned', 'drive-in', 'where', 'Royce', 'once', 'worked', 'Unfortunately', 'Royce', 'old', 'boss', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'performing', 'Satanic', 'sacrifice', 'Satanists', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'Royce', 'girlfriend', 'Matilda', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'back', 'life', 'now', 'need', 'complete', 'sacrifice.Royce', 'Dex', 'also', 'have', 'eyes', 'safe', 'locked', 'away', 'someone', 'house', 'gang', 'little', 'people', 'running', 'around', 'who', 'do', 'medieval', 'reenactments', 'Yeah', 'one', 'THOSE', 'movies.One', 'long', 'night', 'Lots', 'misadventures', 'odd', 'connections', 'characters', 'plot', 'itself.I', 'found', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'movie', 'be', 'Bentley', 'who', 'very', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'scatter-brained', 'druggie', 'who', 'as', 'dumb', 'screechy', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'stoner', 'sense', 'disregard', 'movie', 'something', 'very', 'funny.Allan', 'Moyle', 'put', 'together', 'sequences', 'are', 'visual', 'feasts', 'oddly', ""n't"", 'work', 'same', 'magic', 'when', 'filming', 'simple', 'scenes', 'often', 'found', 'comic', 'timing', 'film', 'was', 'off', 'were', 'clearly', 'funny', 'moments', 'Willem', 'Wennekers', 'screenplay', 'Moyle', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'bit', 'awkwardness.Moyle', 'assembles', 'fine', 'cast', 'here', 'loved', 'Greg', 'Bryk', 'performance', 'head', 'Satanist', 'put-upon', 'priss', 'Bryk', 'seemed', 'get', 'tone', 'material', 'just', 'right', 'did', 'Bentley', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'everyone', 'involved.In', 'end', 'Weirdsville', 'more', 'amusing', 'ever', 'really', 'sustainably', 'funny', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'it.But', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Especially', 'like', 'watching', 'drug', 'addicts', 'too', 'stupid', 'be', 'scared', 'bounce', 'one', 'crazy', 'catastrophe', 'next']",N/A

But if you want to laugh yourself silly while scratching your head at the insanity at the same time, then this is the movie for you. Weirdsville is by the Director of Empire RecordsEmpire Records (Remix! Special Fan Edition), Allan Moyle and it has Scott Speedman as one of the stars (Michael from UnderworldUnderworld (Widescreen Special Edition)). It is about a few druggy friends who owe a local dealer way too much money, and they have no way to pay him back. While they're trying to figure out how to stay alive, one of them over doses and dies. The guys decide to bury her body and are discovered by Satanists... this leads to a high speed chase, an armed robbery, a group of little people who are into Medieval Recreation Battles and kicking Mooney butt and all other kinds of insanity.Allan Moyle has managed to again deliver a great movie about little to nothing (like Empire Records) that leaves you feeling entertained. The sequences that are interspersed throughout the film that show events from the characters point of view that have just used drugs are nothing short of brilliant. The visuals are amazing. This movie does not really glamorize drug use but shows how twisted it really is. However, they juxtapose this view against the greater picture of how twisted the world at large is.If you liked Gramma's Boy, Empire Records, Clerks, or if you just want a good laugh then grab this movie and enjoy.Highly Recommended.",4,"A simple, complicated Stoner Comedy",1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,1574,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'next', 'great', 'independent', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'change', 'way', 'look', 'world', 'keep', 'looking', 'want', 'laugh', 'silly', 'scratching', 'head', 'insanity', 'same', 'time', 'then', 'movie', 'Weirdsville', 'Director', 'Empire', 'RecordsEmpire', 'Records', 'Remix', 'Special', 'Fan', 'Edition', 'Allan', 'Moyle', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'one', 'stars', 'Michael', 'UnderworldUnderworld', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'few', 'druggy', 'friends', 'who', 'owe', 'local', 'dealer', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'have', 'way', 'pay', 'back', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stay', 'alive', 'one', 'doses', 'dies', 'guys', 'decide', 'bury', 'body', 'are', 'discovered', 'Satanists', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'armed', 'robbery', 'group', 'little', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'Medieval', 'Recreation', 'Battles', 'kicking', 'Mooney', 'butt', 'other', 'kinds', 'insanity.Allan', 'Moyle', 'managed', 'again', 'deliver', 'great', 'movie', 'about', 'little', 'nothing', 'Empire', 'Records', 'feeling', 'entertained', 'sequences', 'are', 'interspersed', 'film', 'show', 'events', 'characters', 'point', 'view', 'have', 'just', 'used', 'drugs', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'visuals', 'are', 'amazing', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'glamorize', 'drug', 'use', 'how', 'twisted', 'really', 'However', 'juxtapose', 'view', 'greater', 'picture', 'how', 'twisted', 'world', 'large', 'is.If', 'liked', 'Gramma', 'Boy', 'Empire', 'Records', 'Clerks', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'laugh', 'then', 'movie', 'enjoy.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

1065386,A1Q1V4F9610DB5,B000OU0826,Music Lover in Omaha,"[4, 4]","Actually, I wasn't going to review this film for a couple reasons.  One was that it was pretty obscure and the other was that I really had a hard time deciding if I really liked it or not, but then I realized that this blonde in WEIRDSVILLE was Taryn Manning, who was also in two films that I blasted here at AMAZON.COM.  Well, fair is fair and I am forgiving of THE CULT and THE BREED.  While Taryn isn't the main reason I liked this film, I did think she did a good job, even though she spent a good part of the movie as a corpse.  The heroes of this movie were Wes Bentley and Scott Speedman.  They were in trouble with a loan shark but also had the problem of disposing of the aforementioned corpse and these two brilliant fellas decide to bury her at a drive in theater.  For a couple losers already near the bottom, things go downhill pretty fast but in a glorious ending, things all work out. I thought they did okay, but in my opinion, the film was stolen by Maggie Castle, the girl in the Satanist cult and by Greg Bryk, who was terrific as the leader of the satan worshipers.  I don't think I've ever seen a less menacing group of devil worshipers in a movie, but at least his prayers were answered in the end.  I guess.  I give this one 3 stars.  My expectations weren't too high for WEIRDSVILLE and it was pretty much what I expected.  Funny for the most part but not just downright hilarious.  My advice here is give this one a chance, maybe rent it and you might want to buy it.  Shoot, you might even become a Taryn Manning fan, but if you do avoid THE CULT and THE BREED.  now I'm going to watch banshee staring (who else) Taryn Manning.",3,Moving up with Taryn Manning,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,1653,"['Actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'review', 'film', 'couple', 'reasons', 'One', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'obscure', 'other', 'was', 'really', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'deciding', 'really', 'liked', 'not', 'then', 'realized', 'blonde', 'WEIRDSVILLE', 'was', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'two', 'films', 'blasted', 'here', 'AMAZON.COM', 'Well', 'fair', 'fair', 'am', 'forgiving', 'THE', 'CULT', 'THE', 'BREED', 'Taryn', ""n't"", 'main', 'reason', 'liked', 'film', 'did', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'spent', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'corpse', 'heroes', 'movie', 'were', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'were', 'trouble', 'loan', 'shark', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'disposing', 'aforementioned', 'corpse', 'two', 'brilliant', 'fellas', 'decide', 'bury', 'drive', 'theater', 'couple', 'losers', 'already', 'bottom', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'pretty', 'fast', 'glorious', 'ending', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'thought', 'did', 'okay', 'opinion', 'film', 'was', 'stolen', 'Maggie', 'Castle', 'girl', 'Satanist', 'cult', 'Greg', 'Bryk', 'who', 'was', 'terrific', 'leader', 'satan', 'worshipers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'less', 'menacing', 'group', 'devil', 'worshipers', 'movie', 'least', 'prayers', 'were', 'answered', 'end', 'guess', 'give', 'one', '3', 'stars', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'high', 'WEIRDSVILLE', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'Funny', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'just', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'advice', 'here', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'maybe', 'rent', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'Shoot', 'might', 'even', 'become', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'fan', 'do', 'avoid', 'THE', 'CULT', 'THE', 'BREED', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'banshee', 'staring', 'who', 'else', 'Taryn', 'Manning']",N/A
