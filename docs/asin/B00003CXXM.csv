539491,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00003CXXM,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[1, 1]","These Bourne movies rock my world. You know THE BOURNE IDENTITY and subsequent sequels are so bad. The Bourne movies are so bad they got James Bond to change almost everything about himself except his name. And James Bond probably didn't change his name because he at least has the same initials as Jason Bourne. Seriously they knocked it out of the park with the Bourne films. Don't know which is 'the best' one. Hard to say. Nobody's better than Paul Greengrass (director of the sequels) at doin the realer than real life thing, but Bourne Identity is the first and has the most engrossing story to tell. And 'Shaky cam' is cool, but in much smaller doses than are invariably used. They go over board with the shaky cam. But not here. All that goes overboard is Bourne as he gets shot up and falls off a boat, floats in the sea to be rescued by Italian fishermen, and then goes on a balls-out --- kicken mission to find out who in the world he is. On the way, goes all over cinematic Europe, picks up a pretty German girl, outwits everybody and their mother, and puts on the ground all that get in his way including other elite assassin agents from his own unit. You very quickly understand this dude is like the ultimate bad ---. But here's the kicker -he feels bad about it. This 'action thriller' adventure hero -or make that anti-hero?- has a conscience. Interesting. He actually thinks that it's wrong to kill people as a tool of the government. The Bourne movies are all a step up in action/spy thriller film making.

539493,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B00003CXXM,AbeStreet,"[3, 5]","I saw the 1988 mini-series of THE BOURNE IDENTITY (BI)when it originally aired.  I thought it was a great production and could have been released on the big screen.  That film version stuck much closer to the original novel.  Richard Chamberlin was in his early 50's when the film was made.  In the novel I got the impression that Bourne was in his 30's in the early 70's and a Vietnam War vet.  If you adjust the story to fit in with the 1988 setting of the first film Chamberlin is roughly the same age as Bourne would have been in 1988 if you use the book as a baseline for Bourne's age.  I only bring this up because to remain faithful to the book Bourne needs to be a Vietnam vet and there is no way you can make a present day movie and have Bourne be a Vietname era vet.  He would be in his 60's and that would detract from the original story line.  So, I knew from the start when I found out that Matt Damon would be starring as Bourne that either the producers were going to set the film in present day and drastically alter the story line or, as I hopped they would do, set the story in the early 1970's and stick to the original story line.  Of course the producers chose the present day option and in doing so made a horrible mistake. Spoilers are listed in the comparison between this movie and the book.1.  In the book the physician that saves Bourne after he washes up on shore.2.  In the book Bourne kidnaps his female companion.  In the film he politely asks to use her & her car.  This really undercuts the tension between these two characters as they fall in love.3.  In the book Bourne transfers his money from bank to bank.  In the film Bourne carries it around in a bright red bag that is sure to draw attention to himself.4. In the book Bourne tracks down his identity even as he tracks down the world terrorist Carlos.  In the film Bourne seems to have clues brought to him by the bumbling assasins that can't hit their mark and Carlos is never in this movies storyline.5.  In the book the secret orginization Treadstone and it's founder David Abbott are key elements of the story.  The relationship between Abbott and Bourne is critical to understanding why the world's intelligence agencies want Bourne dead.  In the movie Treadstone is never fully explained and nor is the relationship between Bourne and Abbott.I could go on and on with the differences.  However, I do think the producers deserve some credit, especially after seeing what THE SUM OF ALL FEARS (TSOAF) producers did to that book.  They kept the story in Europe.  Bourne still had amnesia.  He outwits his persuers.  All in all it is not a bad film.  I just think that if a studio is going to make a movie based on a novel they should have a little bit more of the novel in it.The 1988 film will be released on DVD in August 2002 so If you want to see a BI that sticks faily close o the book check that one out.",3,Fair attempt at bringing a great novel to the screen!,1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,2903,"['saw', '1988', 'mini-series', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'BI', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'production', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'version', 'stuck', 'much', 'closer', 'original', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Chamberlin', 'was', 'early', '50', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'novel', 'got', 'impression', 'Bourne', 'was', '30', 'early', '70', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'vet', 'adjust', 'story', 'fit', '1988', 'setting', 'first', 'film', 'Chamberlin', 'roughly', 'same', 'age', 'Bourne', 'would', 'have', 'been', '1988', 'use', 'book', 'baseline', 'Bourne', 'age', 'only', 'bring', 'up', 'remain', 'faithful', 'book', 'Bourne', 'be', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'present', 'day', 'movie', 'have', 'Bourne', 'be', 'Vietname', 'era', 'vet', 'would', 'be', '60', 'would', 'detract', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'knew', 'start', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'would', 'be', 'starring', 'Bourne', 'producers', 'were', 'going', 'set', 'film', 'present', 'day', 'drastically', 'alter', 'story', 'line', 'hopped', 'would', 'do', 'set', 'story', 'early', '1970', 'stick', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'course', 'producers', 'chose', 'present', 'day', 'option', 'doing', 'so', 'made', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'Spoilers', 'are', 'listed', 'comparison', 'movie', 'book.1', 'book', 'physician', 'Bourne', 'up', 'shore.2', 'book', 'Bourne', 'female', 'companion', 'film', 'politely', 'use', 'car', 'really', 'tension', 'two', 'characters', 'fall', 'love.3', 'book', 'Bourne', 'money', 'bank', 'bank', 'film', 'Bourne', 'around', 'bright', 'red', 'bag', 'sure', 'draw', 'attention', 'himself.4', 'book', 'Bourne', 'down', 'identity', 'even', 'down', 'world', 'terrorist', 'Carlos', 'film', 'Bourne', 'have', 'clues', 'brought', 'bumbling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'mark', 'Carlos', 'never', 'movies', 'storyline.5', 'book', 'secret', 'orginization', 'Treadstone', 'founder', 'David', 'Abbott', 'are', 'key', 'elements', 'story', 'relationship', 'Abbott', 'Bourne', 'critical', 'understanding', 'why', 'world', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'want', 'Bourne', 'dead', 'movie', 'Treadstone', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'relationship', 'Bourne', 'Abbott.I', 'could', 'go', 'differences', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'producers', 'deserve', 'credit', 'especially', 'seeing', 'what', 'THE', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'TSOAF', 'producers', 'did', 'book', 'kept', 'story', 'Europe', 'Bourne', 'still', 'had', 'amnesia', 'persuers', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'think', 'studio', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'should', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'novel', 'it.The', '1988', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'August', '2002', 'so', 'want', 'see', 'BI', 'faily', 'close', 'book', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A

539497,A1A4DEENGHK51T,B00003CXXM,Alan Attebery,"[10, 10]","I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw ""The Bourne Identity."" Having never read the book or seen the TV miniseries, I knew little about the premise. In addition, I wasn't sure how well Matt Damon would do playing an action hero.What I saw was an excellent movie with a great cast and terrific acting.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesiac who knows his name only because it was on a passport he found with his picture on it. He doesn't know where he has been, where he lives, or what he does for a living. The only thing he knows is that he found a safety deposit box that belongs to him with tens of thousands of dollars of money, several more passports, and a gun. Oh yeah.... and people keep trying to kill him.Although the movie starts a little on the slow side (which was necessary to set up the premise), once it gets started it keeps going with barely a chance to catch your breath.Another reason to like this movie: the director did not mess it up by inserting a pointless and unneeded love sequence. Yes, you know the two main characters will get together at some point. However, once we see that they are going to get together, we don't see them going at it. No scenes of them falling into bed together, and no scenes of them waking up together the next morning. More movies need to comprehend the idea of less is more.This DVD Collector's Edition also contains several great extras. One of my favorites is the alternate ending which was apparently filmed and then, wisely, scrapped. In addition, you can view four deleted scenes which had been, also wisely, scrapped, and an extended farmhouse scene.

Two reviewers called it &quot;boring&quot; and took to timing the lengths of the action sequences.I suppose these types of reviews are inevitable in this day and age of non-stop violent video games and those ridiculous John Woo conflagurations.This film is however anything but boring. I don't exactly recall then the book was first published but I read it when it was new and felt it raised the bar for spy stories. Remember that this book is at least 25 years old. Updating the story and making changes to better fit a film format is not only understandable but should be expected, even demanded.Anyway, I rate this movie as excellent in almost every way. While it may not be exactly like the novel ( why would anyone want that anyway?) I think it reflects the spirit of the novel wonderfully.I was very impressed with Damons portrayal of the amnesiac assasin and the director played out the scenario of discovery as well as anyone could ever hope for. I thought the action scenes were exactly what I would have wanted to show the skill and programming of a Treadstone killer. No these were not over-choreographed John Woo silliness that go on and on. Bourne gets the job done quick, the other guy is down NOW.Look carefully at the sequences. When Bourne was threatened or went into action he did it automatically amost robotically like he was eexecuting a subroutine and came right out of it when it was over. I thought this was perfectly done and helped the viewer understand better what the Treadstone project was.The apartment scene in Paris is one of my favorites. I loved seeing Bourne and Marie acting like two high school kids alone for the first time disvcovering each other and not sure what to do next, thne Bourne popping into his killer/fighter mode instantly, put the attacker down then get the girl out. Potente for her part played it out so well, from being coyly interested to fear, to fright, to shock and then recovery. Very realistic in my opinion. Just the way you might expect a real person to react in that situation.I though the chase scene was likewise realistic, and I loved it when they parked the mini after alluding the last policeman. Watch Marie's range of facial expressions when Bourne is telling her what they have to do next. I loved it. Potente did a marvelous job of communicating real feelings with just her face a few short syllables.Director Liman also did an excellent job of brining out the mystery slowly, where each answer only led to more questions. It kept the viewer guessing all along.This movie was extremely well done and a fine tribute and introduction of the Bourne saga to the big screen.Ignore those shallow reviews that only want more kicks, punches and rounds expended and fight scenes laid out like a line dance at a disco. Leave that brainlesss nonsense to John Woo movies. This is a thinking persons spy movie.Plus I loved the ended. Wonderful.

In it are a handful of passports under different names, a pile of money in various currencies and a gun.Meanwhile, we learn that Bourne is some kind of CIA operative from an off-the-books mission gone awry. His boss (Chris Cooper, the rigid neighbor from ""American Beauty"") now wants him dead. So the chase begins, with Bourne's only help coming from a young German woman named Maria (Franka Potente). She's got a car and a venturesome spirit, but the more they find out about his former self, the less either of them likes it.The movie has all those welcome spy-movie accoutrements: a train speeding through a snow-covered tunnel, some sinewy cat-and-mouse games in Paris, topped off by an A-plus car chase, even a chilling spy vs. spy confrontation in the French countryside with an agent known as the Professor (""Croupier's"" Clive Owen).That said, the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots, spy-on-the-run picture. Director Doug Liman, best known for ""Swingers,"" not only treats his story with intelligence, but he makes some refreshingly off-beat choices. For one, he casts lovely Julia Stiles as a Paris go-fer for the CIA. In a more conventional movie, she would've played Potente's role.Damon isn't a typical hero either. His boyishness brings a different slant to the role. One of the movie's more winning aspects is watching Damon watch himself as he discovers all the things he somehow knows how to do (at times, it suggests Tobey Maguire's wonder when he first tries out his powers in ""Spider-Man""). In one amusing scene at a diner, within five minutes of being seated, Damon tells Potente that the waitress is left-handed; the guy at the counter may be fat but he knows how to handle himself; and the likeliest place to find a gun, if needed, is in the glove compartment of the truck outside. Not only doesn't he know how he knows these things; he can't imagine why he would know them.Potente, who first turned critics' heads in the German film, ""Run Lola Run,"" is becoming an intriguing presence in American movies. She suggests Lili Taylor with a sexier edge, yet she has a grounded kind of beauty that makes her credible. As a bonus, she brings a European quality to her role that somehow seeps into the rest of Liman's film.She's not precisely what we expect. Neither is Damon. Neither is ""The Bourne Identity.""",4,Expect the Un-Expected,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,2969,"['Bourne', 'Identity', 'fine', 'bit', 'spy-thriller', 'escapism', 'loosely', 'based', '1980', 'best-seller', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'unconscious', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'two', 'bullets', 'back', 'being', 'plucked', 'rough', 'waters', 'coast', 'Marseilles', 'fishing', 'boat', 'out', 'idea', 'who', 'what', 'small', 'capsule', 'carrying', 'Swiss', 'bank-account', 'number', 'was', 'doing', 'implanted', 'butt.However', 'body', 'remembers', 'Making', 'way', 'Zurich', 'check', 'out', 'only', 'clue', 'multilingual', 'martial-arts', 'expert', 'Which', 'what', 'safety-deposit', 'box', 'only', 'things', 'are', 'handful', 'passports', 'different', 'names', 'pile', 'money', 'various', 'currencies', 'gun.Meanwhile', 'learn', 'Bourne', 'kind', 'CIA', 'operative', 'off-the-books', 'mission', 'gone', 'awry', 'boss', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'rigid', 'neighbor', 'American', 'Beauty', 'now', 'dead', 'chase', 'Bourne', 'only', 'help', 'coming', 'young', 'German', 'woman', 'named', 'Maria', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'got', 'car', 'venturesome', 'spirit', 'more', 'find', 'out', 'former', 'self', 'less', 'it.The', 'movie', 'welcome', 'spy-movie', 'accoutrements', 'train', 'speeding', 'snow-covered', 'tunnel', 'sinewy', 'cat-and-mouse', 'games', 'Paris', 'topped', 'off', 'A-plus', 'car', 'chase', 'even', 'chilling', 'spy', 'vs.', 'spy', 'confrontation', 'French', 'countryside', 'agent', 'known', 'Professor', 'Croupier', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'said', 'film', 'greatest', 'asset', 'how', 'much', 'not', 'just', 'connect-the-dots', 'spy-on-the-run', 'picture', 'Director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'best', 'known', 'Swingers', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'intelligence', 'refreshingly', 'off-beat', 'choices', 'one', 'lovely', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Paris', 'go-fer', 'CIA', 'more', 'conventional', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'played', 'Potente', 'role.Damon', ""n't"", 'typical', 'hero', 'boyishness', 'different', 'slant', 'role', 'One', 'movie', 'more', 'winning', 'aspects', 'watching', 'Damon', 'watch', 'things', 'somehow', 'how', 'do', 'times', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'wonder', 'when', 'first', 'out', 'powers', 'Spider-Man', 'one', 'amusing', 'scene', 'diner', 'five', 'minutes', 'being', 'seated', 'Damon', 'Potente', 'waitress', 'left-handed', 'guy', 'counter', 'may', 'be', 'fat', 'how', 'handle', 'likeliest', 'place', 'find', 'gun', 'needed', 'glove', 'compartment', 'truck', 'outside', 'Not', 'only', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'would', 'know', 'them.Potente', 'who', 'first', 'turned', 'critics', 'heads', 'German', 'film', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'becoming', 'intriguing', 'presence', 'American', 'movies', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'sexier', 'edge', 'yet', 'grounded', 'kind', 'beauty', 'credible', 'bonus', 'European', 'quality', 'role', 'somehow', 'seeps', 'rest', 'Liman', 'film.She', 'not', 'precisely', 'what', 'expect', 'Damon', 'Bourne', 'Identity']",N/A

(2)The story begins with trained assassin who lost his memory. (3)It has Matt Damon (4)It is PG-13, so perhaps it's not violent enough.But what made ""The Bourne Identity"" so good is exactly the above, with the addition of stunning visual, fast-paced story, and Franka Potente.Even though we are exposed to many of the premise with a guy (or woman) who wakes up and can't remember who he or she is, but realize that he or she possesses superhuman abilities, hence go on a journey to find out what happened. ""The Bourne Identity"" is not so different, but without wasting too much time on the actualy ""search"", troubles come one after another for the hero. In another word, nothing in the 118 minutes feel redundant (with the exception of the love scene).The dialogues are clever, the action is slick without going over the top. Every actors delivered an adequate job for the characters they are given. And one big surprise for Matt Damon who normally comes accross as the whiney wimpy guy is actually believable as an ex-assassin.The DVD is a neat package itself.

539505,A15S44J4NHU4LS,B00003CXXM,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[11, 19]","Action was great.  Bad guys were funny.  Like zombies from a bad chinese ghost film.  They rise up after being knocked down with their whole body straight. (imagine the lines as being the body: ""_"" (fallen) -> ""/"" (rising) -> ""|"" (up))  I found it humorous that they had Clive Owen play another assassin with his vehicle of choice being, naturally, a BMW.  I didn't expect Julia Stiles to play such a minor role as the Paris liaison.  I found that the screenplay varies from the book in almost all the aspects, from beginning to end.In the novel:* There is a rivalry between Bourne and Carlos (another master assassin, aka the Jackal).* The novel is set up to segue into the sequel with the introduction of Mo Povic (a shrink, and eventually family friend).* Marie is raped in the novel and rescued by Bourne, thus engendering and solidifying their relationship.  (Much more exciting in the novel, Bourne actually kidnaps Marie.  She finally gets a chance to escape and turns him over to bad people.  But she gets into trouble and Bourne rescues her.  Romantic, huh?)* Bourne takes months to recover after being fished out of the ocean.* Marie's a really smart American financial analyst.In the movie:* Marie plays a nomadic hippie, if you will.  She's out of cash, doesn't have a place to go.  She's got nothing to do.  There's absolutely no reason for her to stay with Bourne if not for his red bag full of cash.  Yet she does.* Bourne doesn't repay the ship crewman (it wasn't even explained in the film that he's supposed to be a doctor who nurses him back to health and helps him try to recover his memory).* Bourne recovers from his injuries in about 2 weeks.* Marie is clearly German (swears in German too).The movies strong points are the action scenes where we see Damon's training put to good use.  In an interview with Jay Leno, Damon explains how he trained for months on a vicious Filipino martial arts style.  It looks great and brutal on screen.  As for his acting, his sudden fits of anger seem affected (to the point of being soapish - e.g. he says something in anger and tosses his head to one side for effect).  The writers also try to inject humor into Damon's character but it doesn't always work.  It comes off as incongruous to someone who has lost all memory of himself.  I love Franka Potente in Run, Lola, Run (one of my favorite films).  In this film, however, she's lackluster and her presence isn't important.  She clearly trusts Bourne from the beginning (though she's not supposed to).I guess I had the expectation that this film would be super-""cool"".  It wasn't, but was nonetheless enjoyable as an action film.  I would recommend reading the book if anything I said above interests you.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3.5 (bourne comes off sounding dorky, characters aren't well evolved)E (Erotica) - 0.5 (n/much - Potente is capable of more, but not in this film.)A (Action) - 4.5 (nice hand combat scenes, decent car chase scene)P (Plot) - 3 (screenplay is an oversimplification of the novel)",3,Which part of this screenplay is based on the book?,1024272000,"06 17, 2002",2002,3067,"['Action', 'was', 'great', 'Bad', 'guys', 'were', 'funny', 'zombies', 'bad', 'chinese', 'ghost', 'film', 'rise', 'up', 'being', 'knocked', 'down', 'whole', 'body', 'straight', 'imagine', 'lines', 'being', 'body', '_', 'fallen', '>', '/', 'rising', '>', '|', 'found', 'humorous', 'had', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'play', 'assassin', 'vehicle', 'choice', 'being', 'naturally', 'BMW', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'play', 'minor', 'role', 'Paris', 'liaison', 'found', 'screenplay', 'book', 'almost', 'aspects', 'beginning', 'end.In', 'novel', '*', 'rivalry', 'Bourne', 'Carlos', 'master', 'assassin', 'aka', 'Jackal', '*', 'novel', 'set', 'up', 'segue', 'sequel', 'introduction', 'Mo', 'Povic', 'shrink', 'eventually', 'family', 'friend', '*', 'Marie', 'raped', 'novel', 'rescued', 'Bourne', 'thus', 'engendering', 'solidifying', 'relationship', 'Much', 'more', 'exciting', 'novel', 'Bourne', 'actually', 'Marie', 'finally', 'chance', 'escape', 'bad', 'people', 'trouble', 'Bourne', 'Romantic', 'huh', 'Bourne', 'months', 'recover', 'being', 'fished', 'ocean', 'Marie', 'really', 'smart', 'American', 'financial', 'movie', '*', 'Marie', 'nomadic', 'hippie', 'will', 'cash', ""n't"", 'have', 'place', 'go', 'got', 'nothing', 'do', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'stay', 'Bourne', 'not', 'red', 'bag', 'full', 'cash', '*', 'Bourne', ""n't"", 'repay', 'ship', 'crewman', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'explained', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'doctor', 'who', 'back', 'health', 'try', 'recover', 'memory', '*', 'Bourne', 'recovers', 'injuries', 'about', '2', 'weeks', '*', 'Marie', 'clearly', 'German', 'swears', 'German', 'too', '.The', 'movies', 'strong', 'points', 'are', 'action', 'scenes', 'where', 'see', 'Damon', 'training', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'interview', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Damon', 'how', 'trained', 'months', 'vicious', 'Filipino', 'martial', 'arts', 'style', 'great', 'brutal', 'screen', 'acting', 'sudden', 'fits', 'anger', 'seem', 'affected', 'point', 'being', 'soapish', 'e.g', 'something', 'anger', 'head', 'one', 'side', 'effect', 'writers', 'also', 'try', 'inject', 'humor', 'Damon', 'character', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'off', 'as', 'incongruous', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'memory', 'love', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'film', 'however', 'lackluster', 'presence', ""n't"", 'important', 'clearly', 'trusts', 'Bourne', 'beginning', 'not', 'supposed', '.I', 'guess', 'had', 'expectation', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'super-', 'cool', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'nonetheless', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'anything', 'said', 'interests', 'you.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '3.5', 'bourne', 'off', 'sounding', 'dorky', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'evolved', 'E', 'Erotica', '0.5', 'n/much', 'Potente', 'capable', 'more', 'not', 'film', 'Action', '4.5', 'nice', 'hand', 'combat', 'scenes', 'decent', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'P', 'Plot', '3', 'screenplay', 'oversimplification', 'novel']",N/A

The Canadian is smart enough to help Jason find his real identity, is able to stand by his side because she knows he has integrity.

I hadn't ever heard of the books at the time, but a friend of mine was all about them and so we went to the movies and he was disappointed and I was engrossed.  Apparently, the movie was A LOT different than the novels, (I've still yet to read the books), but it didn't matter much to me (or the movie going public).  Even my friend had to admit after he had time to settle that the film, as a whole, was pretty much everything it promised to be.Slick, gritty and engrossing, `The Bourne Identity' springboards a great trilogy that only got more established and more entangled with each new thread.  Now, I have not seen the new Bourne film (with the overrated Renner) but it's not really a Bourne film, so it doesn't count.  Damon is superb in the role, perfectly guarded and mysterious while maintaining his genuine charm throughout.  He is a true movie star here, balancing skill with charisma to create a character we want to watch.  Damon understands shading Bourne's amnesia and he does so in a way that feel genuine.  In fact the whole mystery is worked out rather brilliantly here (and in the subsequent films).For fans of action films, this is a must see.  Compared to the sequels, this film doesn't pack as much of a punch.  It lacks the chaotic energy that Greengrass brought to the series (although I applaud this films use of editing far more than the spastic cuts in `Supremacy') but it grounds the story and tells us something very intriguing and very impactful.

He also sold me on the all-important case of 'amnesia' that drives the film.I also thought Damon was eye-openingly good in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' especially given it was essentially the polar opposite of the celebrated South Boston poster boy he portrayed so perfectly in 'Good Will Hunting.'Then, I try to imagine buddy Ben Affleck in each of these roles.

539512,AAPWD1KRDMQHA,B00003CXXM,"""ann_septimus16""","[11, 19]","""The Bourne Identity"" is one of those movies that starts, plays out, and ends all so self-containedly that once you walk out of the theatre, the world of the film evaporates.  Everything is so compact and perfectly contained that it leaves the viewer with no lasting impressions or even a real memory of it.  There are no deep psychological or philosophical issues at work in the script, and none of the action is really impressive enough to warrant discussion later.  Just think of this as Matt Damon's bid to be placed on the ever-increasing list of 'actors starring in forgettable spy flicks' alongside Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Will Smith.  ""The Bourne Identity"" is just more insulting in its mediocrity because of its origins - the book that this movie is ostensibly based on is actually quite interesting.Sadly, when considered wholly, this movie is so much less than a sum of its parts.  The acting is very good, the script isn't completely dumb (if not exactly brimming with witty dialogue), and the camerawork and the locations are gorgeous.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, if looking a bit too much of a callow kid to be a hard-edged CIA assassin, is convincing and engaging as a man who has too many locked secrets in his head and has lost his key.  Franka Potente, most famous for her athletic role in ""Run, Lola, Run"" is a nice change from the stereotypical token love interest in movies such as these.  Not pretty in a conventional sense and trying hard to be the 'feisty partner' that other movies have dictated that she be, but not quite succeeding, Potente actually makes an impact with her anomalous appearance.  The big disappointments come with Julia Stiles and Clive Owen, both billed on the poster, and both receiving little more than cameo appearances.  Stiles spends her four scenes attached to a computer keyboard, and Owen has only about five lines and some moaning to do.  A sad waste of fine actors, even if their bits are well performed.The real downfall of ""Bourne"" lies in its plot, though.  It's not so much the gross story line, which we've seen over and over again with different actors righting different villainous plots, but the smaller details that just bring a sense of unreality to the proceedings.  A man with two bullet holes in his back lowering himself by his arms down a building?  Julia Stiles as the head of a Parisian safe-house?  Excuse me while I go put logic out of its misery forever.  It's not so much the fact that we are told to check our brains at the door, but that all the proceedings are done with a seriousness that makes one think that a brain might actually be needed.Forget about ""The Bourne Identity"".",2,"""I have this condition""... redux with explosions",1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,2663,"['Bourne', 'Identity', 'one', 'movies', 'out', 'so', 'self-containedly', 'once', 'walk', 'theatre', 'world', 'film', 'Everything', 'so', 'compact', 'perfectly', 'contained', 'viewer', 'lasting', 'impressions', 'even', 'real', 'memory', 'are', 'deep', 'psychological', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'work', 'script', 'none', 'action', 'really', 'impressive', 'enough', 'warrant', 'discussion', 'later', 'Just', 'think', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'bid', 'be', 'placed', 'ever-increasing', 'list', ""'actors"", 'starring', 'forgettable', 'spy', 'flicks', 'alongside', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'just', 'more', 'insulting', 'mediocrity', 'origins', 'book', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'based', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting.Sadly', 'when', 'considered', 'wholly', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'script', ""n't"", 'completely', 'dumb', 'not', 'exactly', 'brimming', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'camerawork', 'locations', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'looking', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'callow', 'kid', 'be', 'hard-edged', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'convincing', 'engaging', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'many', 'locked', 'secrets', 'head', 'lost', 'key', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'most', 'famous', 'athletic', 'role', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'nice', 'change', 'stereotypical', 'token', 'love', 'interest', 'movies', 'such', 'Not', 'pretty', 'conventional', 'sense', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', ""'feisty"", 'partner', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'dictated', 'be', 'not', 'quite', 'succeeding', 'Potente', 'actually', 'impact', 'anomalous', 'appearance', 'big', 'disappointments', 'come', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'billed', 'poster', 'receiving', 'little', 'more', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Stiles', 'four', 'scenes', 'attached', 'computer', 'keyboard', 'Owen', 'only', 'about', 'five', 'lines', 'moaning', 'do', 'A', 'sad', 'waste', 'fine', 'actors', 'even', 'bits', 'are', 'well', 'performed.The', 'real', 'downfall', 'Bourne', 'plot', 'though', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'gross', 'story', 'line', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'over', 'again', 'different', 'actors', 'righting', 'different', 'villainous', 'plots', 'smaller', 'details', 'just', 'bring', 'sense', 'unreality', 'proceedings', 'man', 'two', 'bullet', 'holes', 'back', 'lowering', 'arms', 'down', 'building', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'head', 'Parisian', 'safe-house', 'go', 'put', 'logic', 'misery', 'forever', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'are', 'told', 'check', 'brains', 'door', 'proceedings', 'are', 'done', 'seriousness', 'one', 'think', 'brain', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'needed.Forget', 'Bourne', 'Identity']",N/A
539513,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00003CXXM,Anthony Hinde,"[139, 159]","I'll be honest, I haven't read the Robert Ludlum novel, nor do I remember seeing the original film staring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. So I'm not able to point out differences or inconsistencies, if indeed there are any. Having said that, I can't imagine its predecessors topping Doug Liman's version of ""The Bourne Identity."" This is the sort of film I like to watch pretty often and each time I find something new to enjoy.The plot, while nothing very original, provides a useful framework around which we get to enjoy some of the most believable action sequences I've seen. Let's face it, an assassin suffering from amnesia is not going to lead a dull life, particularly not after his ""friends"" decide he's gone rogue. There's only so many ways you can film stunts and action sequences like a car chase but Liman has  managed to somehow make the many action scenes seem fresh. I particularly liked seeing what looked like a mini-minor out driving the police using skill and good planing, rather than a high-powered engine or death-defying jumps.Most of the movie follows Jason Bourne, (Matt Damon), as he tries to reclaim his life and survive to see each new day. In this way, the audience is allowed to discover the pieces of the puzzle along with him. On the way he forms an unequal partnership with Marie Kreutz, (Franka Potente). It is good to see a female lead portrayed without either weakness or an unrealistic macho streak. Hopefully, this film will launch Franka's Hollywood career because she has more than earned her stripes in German cinema.Jason and Marie inevitably bond but despite not taking a major part of the narrative, I felt their stop-start romance suited the film. Perhaps a woman with no home makes a good match for a man with no past. I also liked the several times the couple tried to split up, to  get Marie out of Bourne's troubles but I especially liked the realism when they finally managed to part. The plot really doesn't need her but it seems Liman used Marie as a means of reminding Bourne that there is more to life than survival.To some it would be nice to wake up one day and discover you were a sort of superman; able to speak half a dozen languages, had tens of thousands in a Swiss bank account and could out-fight Bruce Lee. His boss said it best when he described Jason as a $30,000,000 weapon. But more than advanced skills, Jason was gifted with intelligence and the experience of years of spy craft, even if he couldn't remember it. The thoughtful approach taken to achieve each objective, even on the spur of the moment, made the film almost educational. Hey, read a map before running from the police, use distraction and decoys to sidetrack you opponent, use the resources around you and think laterally. It's all good stuff for budding spies.While Matt Damon played the part with little emotion, deliberately I assume, some of the smaller roles were outstanding. Each seemed to wring so  much depth from so few minutes of screen time that I felt like watching a spin-off movie for each of them. Probably the most affecting was the performance of Clive Owen, a fellow assassin who dies describing his constant headaches and bitter loneliness. Also of note is Julia Stiles, the overworked safe-house administrator; she exudes competence while comlaining of limited resources. All of these performnce gems must be a credit to Liman's direction.It would be easy to dismiss ""The Bourne Identity"" as just another action flick. The action was great, but the true heart of the film was Jason's odyssey to reclaim his soul from the depths of a CIA black-ops hell. He used to be an amoral machine, doing his job without questioning the rightness of his work, just like the rest of them. But amnesia gave him the chance to step back from the abyss and evaluate his fate, eventually choosing to tear a new path into the future. The moral? Perhaps it's that ""freedom"" is more important than ""patriotism.""",4,"Jason's not paranoid, he's just in a tough spot.",1051660800,"04 30, 2003",2003,3953,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'novel', 'do', 'remember', 'seeing', 'original', 'film', 'staring', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', ""'m"", 'not', 'able', 'point', 'out', 'differences', 'inconsistencies', 'indeed', 'are', 'Having', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'predecessors', 'topping', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'version', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'sort', 'film', 'like', 'watch', 'pretty', 'often', 'time', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'enjoy.The', 'plot', 'nothing', 'very', 'original', 'useful', 'framework', 'get', 'enjoy', 'most', 'believable', 'action', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Let', 'face', 'assassin', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'not', 'going', 'lead', 'dull', 'life', 'particularly', 'not', 'friends', 'gone', 'rogue', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'film', 'stunts', 'action', 'sequences', 'car', 'chase', 'Liman', 'managed', 'somehow', 'make', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'seem', 'fresh', 'particularly', 'liked', 'seeing', 'what', 'looked', 'mini-minor', 'driving', 'police', 'using', 'skill', 'good', 'planing', 'rather', 'high-powered', 'engine', 'death-defying', 'jumps.Most', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'reclaim', 'life', 'survive', 'see', 'new', 'day', 'way', 'audience', 'allowed', 'discover', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'way', 'unequal', 'partnership', 'Marie', 'Kreutz', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'good', 'see', 'female', 'lead', 'portrayed', 'weakness', 'unrealistic', 'macho', 'streak', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'launch', 'Franka', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'more', 'earned', 'stripes', 'German', 'cinema.Jason', 'Marie', 'inevitably', 'bond', 'not', 'taking', 'major', 'part', 'narrative', 'felt', 'stop-start', 'romance', 'suited', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'woman', 'home', 'good', 'match', 'man', 'past', 'also', 'liked', 'several', 'times', 'couple', 'tried', 'split', 'up', 'get', 'Marie', 'Bourne', 'troubles', 'especially', 'liked', 'realism', 'when', 'finally', 'managed', 'part', 'plot', 'really', ""n't"", 'need', 'Liman', 'used', 'Marie', 'means', 'reminding', 'Bourne', 'more', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'discover', 'were', 'sort', 'superman', 'able', 'speak', 'dozen', 'languages', 'had', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'could', 'out-fight', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'boss', 'said', 'best', 'when', 'described', 'Jason', '30,000,000', 'weapon', 'more', 'advanced', 'skills', 'Jason', 'was', 'gifted', 'intelligence', 'experience', 'years', 'spy', 'craft', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thoughtful', 'approach', 'taken', 'achieve', 'objective', 'even', 'spur', 'moment', 'made', 'film', 'almost', 'educational', 'Hey', 'read', 'map', 'running', 'police', 'use', 'distraction', 'sidetrack', 'opponent', 'use', 'resources', 'think', 'laterally', 'good', 'stuff', 'budding', 'spies.While', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'played', 'part', 'little', 'emotion', 'deliberately', 'assume', 'smaller', 'roles', 'were', 'outstanding', 'seemed', 'wring', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'felt', 'watching', 'spin-off', 'movie', 'Probably', 'most', 'affecting', 'was', 'performance', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'fellow', 'assassin', 'who', 'describing', 'constant', 'headaches', 'bitter', 'loneliness', 'Also', 'note', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'overworked', 'safe-house', 'administrator', 'competence', 'comlaining', 'limited', 'resources', 'performnce', 'gems', 'must', 'be', 'credit', 'Liman', 'direction.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'just', 'action', 'flick', 'action', 'was', 'great', 'true', 'heart', 'film', 'was', 'Jason', 'odyssey', 'reclaim', 'soul', 'depths', 'CIA', 'black-ops', 'hell', 'used', 'be', 'amoral', 'machine', 'doing', 'job', 'questioning', 'rightness', 'work', 'just', 'rest', 'amnesia', 'gave', 'chance', 'step', 'back', 'abyss', 'evaluate', 'fate', 'eventually', 'choosing', 'tear', 'new', 'path', 'future', 'moral', 'Perhaps', 'freedom', 'more', 'important', 'patriotism']",N/A

The day Jason Charles Bourne came punching and shooting into our theatres was the day that spy films stopped being silly affairs with hidden gadgets, shiny tuxes, and fast women. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is hard, rainy, real, and ruthless.Jason Bourne does not wear a tuxedo, nor does he drive an Alfa Romeo. Throughout the course of the film, the amnesia-afflicted super spy wears whatever borrowed clothes he can, and drives anything he can hot-wire. He never uses gadgets, choosing instead to deliver beat downs with magazines or ballpoint pens, treating CIA-trained assassins like so many bad puppies. His ingenuity and resourcefulness, coupled with his badassery, killer fighting styles, and Matt Damon's pure coolness makes Bourne one of the most memorable characters in spy cinema.Backing upMatt Damon's incredible performance is a talented cast.Franke Potentegives an excellent performance as Marie Kreutz, a woman roped into a world of CIA operations and shady assassins. Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are fantastic as the CIA officials deep into the shades of grey. Clive Owen's assassin The Professor is a highlight, as is Julia Stiles technician Nicky Parsons. Never showy, always compelling, Liman's cast is diverse and memorable.Speaking of memorable, let us talk a little about the action. Consider for instance, a scene where Bourne takes on a paid killer with nothing but a ballpoint pen. Or where he takes a Mini through the streets of Paris, down a stair case, on the sidewalk, and through traffic. The action in IDENTITY is riveting, brutal, fast-paced, and shot in that shaky--cam style that lends the film a documentary feel. Unlike so many other films, the shaky-cam serves the action well, and when combined with Tony Gilroy's fast-paced, convoluted plots, you have a smart and gripping action thriller.In conclusion, The Bourne Identity is a must-see for fans of spycraft, smart films with a tinge of political, or good ol', non-CGI action. It's realism and relevancy, coupled with a great cast and Matt Damon's charismatic and cool performance elevate the material and make The Bourne Identity one helluva ride. 4/5 bullet ridden stars!P.S.

Damon is great in the action scenes, going on auto-pilot has he opens a can of ""whup-ay"" on anyone that messes with him.  There are great chases and all the stuff we want from this type of film.

I like Chris Cooper.  I was ready to like this film.  But how could I?  It was really boring.I'm not usually a person who notices interpersonal onscreen chemistry, but there is NO chemistry between Damon and Potente; as a matter of fact, if you told me they hated each other during filming, I'd believe it.  Secondly, the plot is implausible.  We never really know why Cooper wants to kill Damon.  Would you train a guy who could do all this stuff, and then just wipe him out if one mission went wrong?  Finally, and most egregiously, the action is just plain boring.  The car chase from the trailer is the movie's best action sequence, and it takes place in the middle of the film.  There is nothing very exciting after that.  I had hoped for great scenes of Europe, and what we see of locations in Prague and Paris are beautiful, but they are infrequent.  Julia Stiles and Chris Cooper are utterly wasted.DVD extras are good.

The man who digs a couple of bullets out of his back finds something else beneath the skin of his bottom: a small capsule with a laser that displays the name of a Swiss bank and an account number. It was the flashing of another laser embedded in his wet suit that had alerted the crew of the fishing boat to his presence in the water.He does not know who he is. Thus begins one of the most amazing adventure and chase stories in 21st century films. Even for someone who read the book, it is thrilling. There are enough differences (although the sense of it is maintained) that even though I remembered the book pretty well, I didn't always know what was going on here. When Jason Bourne discovers his passport in the lock box which was connected to that bank account number, he discovers another half dozen, some with the name Bourne and some with at least one other name. The pictures are all of the face he has been seeing in the mirror. There is also a great deal of money in several currencies (the setting is apparently pre-Euro), a gun or two, and some communications devices.So is he a spy? For whom? He clearly has incredible fighting skill, as he discovers when a couple of Zurich police hassle him for sleeping in the park. And a trip to the U.S. Embassy makes it clear there's something very fishy about all of this. He escapes with his life, but only just, and bribes a young woman to give him a ride to Paris.The entire story is really one long chase, but the little red car zipping through all obstacles in Paris is probably the most amazing car chase scene I have ever seen in any movie. (Well, until the next film; I seem to remember there's a pretty amazing one there, too. Bourne tops Bourne?)I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will warn you that you may have to play this one two or three times to follow everything; the pace is just that rapid and the tale that convoluted. Much high-tech spy equipment, much ado about plenty.

In this loosely adapted version of best-selling mystery author Robert Ludlum, Damon plays the lead part of Jason Bourne, and man who awakes from shock aboard a Portuguese fishing boat with two gaping bullet holes in his back and a terrific case of amnesia. As he lands with some evidence of some puzzling leads in port, he follows the lead and slips into a nightmare world where everyone is chasing him and he has no idea of what is going on.Along the way he enlists the support of an existentially challenged twenty-something woman in search of her life, and the two of them fend their perilous way through the maze of inexplicable violence and mind-boggling subtexts. Thus, discovering through a passport that his name is Jason Bourne, an American living in a sumptuous upstairs flat in Paris, Bourne and the soon to be main squeeze are assaulted by an assassin. And in the midst of all this pounding, he discovers more and more about his assailants, his own mysterious combat capabilities, and finally himself.The cinematography is excellent, and adds to the lure of the film, as does the young main squeeze, a relatively unknown actress (Franka Potente) whose only other screen credit is for ""Run Lola Run"". One suspects we will be seeing more of her soon. The sets are realistic, and some of the chase scenes are extremely well choreographed, filmed and spliced together in some of the most exciting and memorable heart-pounders in recent memory.  The sporting cast is excellent and quite believable, the plot is a bit sticky but plausible, and as sheer entertainment it is a great afternoon's entertainment. I expect we will soon see a sequel or two, as the Bourne character is certainly an appealing and exciting film figure.

Director Doug Liman's (GO, SWINGERS) first attempt at an action thriller is fairly good with some spectacular stunt work and an OK performance from Franka Portene (RUN LOLA RUN). Julia Stiles also has what is basically a glorifed cameo and Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lecter also co-stars.

To give you a brief idea of the storyline- a man wakes up in the ocean (Matt Damon's character) has absolutely NO idea where he is, realizes he doesn't remember anything from the past two weeks prior to the incident, meets an attractive young woman while in the city, and they both spend the entire time running from the police around Germany and France.While it's a pretty easy plotline to follow, it unfortunately does contain some unsatisfyingly dry and quiet moments that feel really tacked on and unnecessary, dragging the overall score down a few notches.Also, I was never really sure whether Damon's character had superhero strengths, or whether these devastating moves of his were just your typical far-fetched action segments on the part of the Hollywood directors.  I'm not necessarily complaining about it- just wondering if those power moves he was delivering to the bad guys had an explanation of some sorts, or were we not supposed to acknowledge Damon's amazing power?Lots of shooting, fighting, and yes, even some romance scenes take up a good portion of The Bourn Identity.

He's a little too much of a ""pretty boy"" and seemed way too young.  The other agents, those assigned to kill him, were much more believeable.  Now, I haven't read the book, but I've heard plenty about it.  The Professor, the assassin that completed Bourne's failed mission, was supposed to be his equal, if not superior, in skill.  However, the Professor was done away with in about 5 minutes, by Bourne.  And lastly, I can't stand when a character gets kicked, punched, sprayed with glass, etc., and never has the slightest bruise or cut.  He falls down several flights of stairs and doesn't even get an ankle sprain.  I understand Bourne is a top agent, but he's not armor plated.

If every element from Ludlum's  novel were left in this would be a five hour movie. The book was that complex and jam-packed.Director Doug Liman has retained the basic feel of the book and left the heart of the story in tact. He didn't try to glamourize the grittier aspects simply because he had a big budget with which to work. There is almost a low-key atmosphere which somehow makes all the action seem more real to the viewer. We see Paris and all the other countries only as background to the dark storyline we hope can have some kind of happy resolution as the film goes along.Franke Potente is perfect as a girl who has no real roots herself, and what begins as a business proposition escalates into love, even if it must be a life on the run with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Damon proves he can really act in this film and does a great job as Bourne, a guy who has no idea who he is but has all the instincts of someone not quite part of everyday society.A Swiss bank account and a dozen passports, along with a large sum of cash and a weapon, tells him something about what kind of life he has led, if not who he is exactly. He ponders the mystery in a Paris cafe with Marie (Potente) while instinctively making note of all the liscence plates of the vehicles parked outside. Why he does so, he doesn't know.The romance that blossoms between Bourne and Marie becomes one more reason Bourne must find the answers to his identity as international assasins come after them at every turn. There is a moment in the film when he tries to make her leave him for safety because he loves her, and it is for that same reason she stays.This is a gritty movie with a heart. The action sequences as Bourne's instincts kick in are terrific and the human elements are not lost along the way, which is a credit to Director Liman and the two stars, especially Damon, who separtated himself from a big pack and proved he had talent here.We are left with a good feeling at the end of this film as both the action and romance are given their moments. I read this many years ago so perhaps the fact it was not fresh in my mind helped me enjoy it more.

So in terms of just a movie the Bourne Identity is awesome!!!  Everything fits together really well and there were no holes.  For a spy movie that's very rare.  But this movie had very little flaws.  While it's hard to say anything about the movie without giving away the bigger picture, I can say both Matt Damon and Franka Potente played their roles extremely well.  Matt Damon was convincing as a martial arts expert/spy while Franka Potente was believable as an innocent beautiful bystander just trying to help...  And when I say beautiful I mean BEAUTIFUL.  What a gorgeous lady she is, on and off the camera!  And her beauty exudes in this film.There are other good things about this movie besides the credible acting!  There were some great fight scenes, which Matt Damon was quite good in.  The plot was superb with very little/to no holes in it.  It was both intriguing and suspenseful and had and ambiance about it that's hard to describe.  The superb cinematography was partially responsible for this but what I think added to the feel and really brought this movie to life was the musical score!  It did everything a good score does.  It brought you to the edge of your seat when it wanted you there or calmed you down when it was time to be calm.  From the opening credits the music presented suspense and mystery!  If you get a chance check out the score!  It's awesome to listen to by itself!  On top of this, the movie has one of the most fun car chases with Matt Damon behind the wheel of an old school Mini!  While in the background is an awesome song by Paul Oakenfold called ""Ready Steady Go"" from his new CD Bunkka.All in all this movie was great but there is a problem with it.  Though, it's only a problem if you make it one.  The novel by Robert Ludlum for which the movie is named is quite different.  With the exception of the basic premise of Jason Bourne and who he is, the two stories have few things in common.  If you're a fan of the book you will be disappointed in how different it is.  On the flip side if you can watch the movie impartially, chances are it will take on it's own existence and will be enjoyable.  As I stated previously, I hadn't read the book before I watched the movie.  Though the movie did inspire me to read it.  This kept me impartial while watching the movie.  The book was very awesome but it was so unbelievably different that I recognize both as there own entity.If you're a fan of the book don't expect too much from this movie and I'm sure you will enjoy it for what it is, an action packed suspense mystery!  If you like the movie, then check out the book.  But be forewarned, the book is old school!  Some of the references to technology will make you chuckle if you're young or make you reminisce if you're older.",5,Not the book...

Martin,"[0, 3]","I finally watched this movie on DVD and frankly, I don't see what all the hype and fuss was about when this movie was in theaters.The movie,basically, is about Jason Bourne, apparently a government assassin, trying to find out his true identity. There were several things in the movie that I think left it disjointed and rather confusing. Throughout the movie a government program known is Treadstone is referenced. It's hinted that Bourne is part of this program, but even in the end it's never truly explained what this program is, or how Bourne is a part of it.

From the very beginning it locks you into this story of a CIA agent/assasin (Matt Damon) by the name of Jason Bourne. Bourne has no memory of his name, history, or profession. He was floating in the ocean with two holes in his back when group of men found him. He was thought to be dead by his superiors. As the story unfolds, he befriends a German traveler (Franka Potenta) who helps him in his quest to discover his identity. I will say that the action scenes in this movie are spectacular from the fight scenes to the car chases. The use of martial arts within the movie were pretty impressive and exhilirating to watch. Jason Bourne, while trying to find his identity, had to fight off attempts by his boss (Chris Cooper) to kill him and cover up his ""failed mission"".The use of technology in this movie is just superb. The computer gadgetry was top-notch. Bourne had a bank account implanted into his hip. Even once during the movie they were sitting in a cafe and he surveyed the place and gave feedback to Marie (Potente) within minutes. Even stating that two waitresses were left-handed and the best place to find a gun was in the cab of the truck outside. All of this and he still didn't know who he was. The action takes you from Switzerland to Paris and is a thrill-ride throughout. This movie just never loses you from the word ""Go"". The action is non-stop and Matt Damon does an excellent job of acting out the personality of Bourne with passion and convincibility-if I can say that. He looked like he could have boyish-charm, but deep inside he was a ""30 million dollar"" killing machine.I feel that Doug Liman did an awesome job in developing the story and the characters. It doesn't hurt that he had some great actors too. I think that Franka Potente is an up-and-coming star in the making. She's already got me saying ""shizer!"".

539572,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00003CXXM,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 1]","Just about every Alfred Hitchcock film involved an innocent and everyday man caught up in some plot where he doesn't know what is going on or how to save himself from it.  The Bourne Identity modernises this method.  There's more action, and instead of an everyman in the lead role, we instead have a deadly assassin who doesn't know what he is because he has amnesia as a result of being shot and left for dead.  We follow Jason Bourne as he tries to figure out who and what he is while simultaneously trying to stay alive.There are a lot of things to like about this film.  The mystery is interesting - we know more about Jason than he does himself, because we see his (former) employers at work, but that only helps keep the plot moving.  I especially like how the action scenes leap out of nowhere - the film turns from exposition or mystery solving to violent, brutish action in seconds.  Finally, the acting and characterisation by the main characters is great - Matt Damon is good as always.  He has a Harrison Ford-like quality of being able to appear frightened and highly competent simultaneously.  He is joined by Franka Potente (little known in America except from ""Run Lola Run"") who does a very good job in the thankless role of the innocent girl caught up for the ride.The film straddles the line between mystery-thriller and action film.  The two parts blend seamlessly.  Unfortunately, there are a number of little things that pull the film's overall enjoyability down.  Most annoying is the plot surrounding the assassination attempts on an ex-dictator.  Firstly, the dictator is portrayed as a scenery-mashing, bug-eyed monster in a performance that is jarringly out of place in a film of subtlety.  Secondly, there is confusion surrounding the second assassination attempt.  We see in the newspaper the next day that it was successful, but we know (because we saw it) that it wasn't.  What's the dictator's game?  Is he faking his death to escape further attempts?  Is there a cut scene later on where we would have seen him assassinated?  The story leaves this dangling, and it's annoying.  Secondly, when Bourne bribes an official, he uses American money.  Since the action takes place in Paris, why doesn't he use Euros?  Because some people in an American audience wouldn't recognise them?  In a movie that prides itself on being smart, this is a glaring error.  Thirdly, there seems to be no rationale for the CIA to be trying to assassinate Bourne (as opposed to capturing him to find out what happened).While you're watching the film, most would not notice these problems, but upon thinking about it afterwards, you feel like the film was only good and not great.  Another example - if the car chase had taken place in New York instead of Paris, and had Bourne's car been a Lincoln Towncar instead of a Mini, the car chase would not be very interesting.  But it's only on hindsight that these questions arise.  All-in-all, it's a fun and interesting movie, of high quality, as evidenced in the performances of Damon and Potente.The DVD has a few extras like deleted scenes and a director's commentary.  The sound and video are good (as expected).",3,"Great fun, but with some plot inconsistencies",1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,3173,"['Just', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'involved', 'innocent', 'everyday', 'man', 'caught', 'up', 'plot', 'where', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'save', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'method', 'more', 'action', 'instead', 'everyman', 'lead', 'role', 'instead', 'have', 'deadly', 'assassin', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'amnesia', 'result', 'being', 'shot', 'left', 'dead', 'follow', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive.There', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'like', 'film', 'mystery', 'interesting', 'know', 'more', 'Jason', 'see', 'former', 'employers', 'work', 'only', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'especially', 'how', 'action', 'scenes', 'leap', 'nowhere', 'film', 'exposition', 'mystery', 'solving', 'violent', 'brutish', 'action', 'seconds', 'Finally', 'acting', 'characterisation', 'main', 'characters', 'great', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'good', 'always', 'Harrison', 'Ford-like', 'quality', 'being', 'able', 'appear', 'frightened', 'highly', 'competent', 'simultaneously', 'joined', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'little', 'known', 'America', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'thankless', 'role', 'innocent', 'girl', 'caught', 'up', 'ride.The', 'film', 'line', 'mystery-thriller', 'action', 'film', 'two', 'parts', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'number', 'little', 'things', 'pull', 'film', 'overall', 'enjoyability', 'down', 'Most', 'annoying', 'plot', 'surrounding', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'ex-dictator', 'Firstly', 'dictator', 'portrayed', 'scenery-mashing', 'bug-eyed', 'monster', 'performance', 'jarringly', 'place', 'film', 'subtlety', 'Secondly', 'confusion', 'surrounding', 'second', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'see', 'newspaper', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'successful', 'know', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'What', 'dictator', 'game', 'faking', 'death', 'escape', 'further', 'attempts', 'cut', 'scene', 'later', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'assassinated', 'story', 'dangling', 'annoying', 'Secondly', 'when', 'Bourne', 'bribes', 'official', 'American', 'money', 'action', 'place', 'Paris', 'why', ""n't"", 'use', 'Euros', 'people', 'American', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognise', 'movie', 'being', 'smart', 'glaring', 'error', 'Thirdly', 'be', 'rationale', 'CIA', 'be', 'trying', 'assassinate', 'Bourne', 'opposed', 'capturing', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'most', 'would', 'not', 'notice', 'problems', 'thinking', 'afterwards', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'example', 'car', 'chase', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'instead', 'Paris', 'had', 'Bourne', 'car', 'been', 'Lincoln', 'Towncar', 'instead', 'Mini', 'car', 'chase', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'only', 'hindsight', 'questions', 'arise', 'All-in-all', 'fun', 'interesting', 'movie', 'high', 'quality', 'evidenced', 'performances', 'Damon', 'Potente.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'sound', 'video', 'are', 'good', 'expected']",N/A

Hollywood directors seem to forget this sometimes, but lots of explosions and fight scenes really aren't enough to satisfy audiences today.  You've got to tell a good story and deliver some well-developed characters if you want to make a worthwhile film,The strength of this film is revealed by the fact that it actually makes an amnesia plotline succeed.  When we meet Jason Bourne, he is being pulled out of the sea by local fisherman and remembers nothing about his past - including how he got there and who put two bullets in his back.  Most intriguingly, though, he has some kind of implant housing information about a bank account in Zurich.  The mystery deepens once he discovers the contents of his bank lockbox: tens of thousands of dollars, various passports, and a handgun.  In keeping with some unusual talents he has inherited from whoever he used to be, he is able to act instinctively once unknown assailants come after him, eventually escaping Zurich with the help of a young woman named Marie (Franka Potente).  The two travel to Paris, where Bourne's attempt to stir up the old memory banks is rudely interrupted by an assassin crashing in to his apartment and trying to kill him.  Determined more than ever to get to the bottom of his personal story, he and Marie become fugitives, surviving several near misses with authorities as they struggle to figure out what the heck is going on.  When I say authorities, I don't mean law enforcement officers; the guys hunting him down want to clean up a dirty intelligence operation that went awry.  Bourne, having failed in his mission, has become a liability, and the high-level desk jockeys back in DC are in full CYA mode.This really is an impressive thriller, with a tight plot and fascinating leading characters - even though it's never absolutely clear to me why Marie stays with a man who stands a very good chance of getting her killed.  Granted, there is a little romance thrown into the mix, but it never gets in the way of the action.  Franka Potente is an amazing actress who should be as famous here as she is in her native Germany, and this is a great opportunity for American audiences to see her in action.If you want to make a compelling political thriller, it certainly makes sense to seek out the work of Robert Ludlum, one of the premiere writers in the genre.

When we first meet up with the movie's nameless protagonist (played masterfully by Matt Damon, who is becoming one of those actor who can charm the camera merely by sleeping---which, in fact, he does in this film)he is clad in a wetsuit, drifing unconscious in the ocean.He is picked up by a Portuguese fishing trawler and discovers he was 60 miles off the coast of Marseilles in the Mediterranean, but how he came there is a mystery. Indeed, everything is a mystery to our hero, for he has amnesia: he can't even remember his own name.He does remember a lot of other things, though: he discovers he can speak German, French, Italian, and Portuguese fluently; he can disarm and subdue two policemen in seconds; he knows how to drive a Mini Cooper *very* offensively; and he's a natural at staking out the opposition. Oh, and he has a laserlight pointer embedded in his hip, with the address of a Zurich bank and a numbered Swiss bank account.A trip to Zurich raises more questions than answers though, as Damon finds a bank-box with a slew of fake passports (one of which has the name ""Jason Bourne"", his picture, and his 'residence' in Paris), a bundle of money in different denominations, and a gun. Worse still, he has now raised the attention of the police, and is now pursued by them and a series of well-trained and motivated killers who want Bourne dead.To say anything more would spoil the fun of ""Bourne"", but it is rousingly well paced and intelligently directed. In a sense, ""Bourne"" is more Bondian than the Bond films, which are slick productions but often try too hard. ""Bourne"" also boasts excellent acting all around: Damon is great as a man literally searching for his identity while struggling for his very survival, Brian Cox racks up his third great character performance in a year (including his role as General Stryker in ""X-Men 2"" and his performance in ""The Ring""), and Chris Cooper is excellent as a CIA spook.And then there is Franka Potente, one of the most beautiful women in film today, who was the white hot core of the eclectic ""Run Lola Run."" Potente, who plays a gypsy who helps Bourne, works perfectly with Damon, and the two have great chemistry together. Potente can say more with a quirk of her mouth and a single look than most actresses can with 5 pages of script.The movie has everything you would want from a spy film: good villains, thrilling fight sequences, and a ripping chase through the streets of Paris in a vintage, beat up Mini Cooper. But best of all is Liman's ability to create a very real sense of menace and danger that is ratcheted up with every passing minute. Liman is very good at crafting this mounting atmosphere of peril, and shares much in common with Ridley Scott, particularly a solid feel for juicing up the danger-factor of otherwise innocnet locales.Spymaster John Le Carre once wrote a book called ""The Perfect Spy"".

539584,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00003CXXM,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[2, 2]","In ""The Bourne Identity,"" audience favorite Matt Damon gets his hands dirty in an role that allows him retain all of his nice guy attitude but also kick tail with the best of secret agents ever portrayed on film.Already having been made into a 1988 TV miniseries, this movie takes some liberies with the cold war plot of the original Ludlum novel but, its still one excellent thriller.A man (Damon) is found floating more dead than alive in the sea by an Italian fishing crew. The captain, who knows a thing or two about surgery, tends to the man's wounds and removes two bullets and a microchip from his back.After he recovers, the man realizes he has amnesia, with no clue to his identity other than a Swiss bank account found in the chip.With no other leads to follow, the man travels to Switzerland and learns that the account is for a safety deposit box. The box contains an exorbitant amount of money, a gun and several passports and identities, one of which is Jason Borne.Deciding to assume the Borne identity, the man barely has time to ponder his next move before a military squad and policemen ambush him.As perfectly cast as Damon is for this role, the real star of the film is director Doug Liman, who hits all the right notes in setting up the drama and delivering with ""pulse-pounding high-octane action scenes."" Now if that isn't on the next run of commercials I don't know what is.When Bourne begins his escape from his pursuers via a fire escape, Liman doesn't just settle on the quick hop down. Bourne has to scale down the building and Liman pans the camera at just the right angles to show that this isn't something you'd want to try at home...that is, assuming if you lived in a 12-story high-rise.Since no espionage thriller is complete without a romance no matter how trite it may be, Bourne has to meet some unattached female in some manner.While on the run, he meets Marie Krutz (Franka Potente), coincidentally enough, an unattached female in need of some cash. Well, cash Bourne has and he offers Marie $10,000 for a ride to Paris. Guess he doesn't trust the Metro either?Thankfully Marie is not portrayed as the cliched tagalong sidekick and actually significantly helps Bourne in his search for his true identity.Bourne maps out this exhaustive plan for securing some information from a hotel only to have Marie get it by flirting with the hotel attendant.It turns out that Bourne's pursuers are none other than the CIA, or rather a CIA division spearheaded by Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper), who wants Bourne dead while keeping his supervisor (Brian Cox) in the dark as to the real reason he wants Bourne out of action.Rather than prolong the mission any longer than necessary, Cooper sends three assassins to terminate Bourne and tie up the loose ends of the last mission Bourne was sent out to accomplish.Liman introduces the assassins perfectly, having each of them speak as little as possible, and only putting them on camera enough to remind the audience that they are a prevalent threat ... right until Bourne encounters them, at which point they become as threatening as Freddie Prinze Jr.Not that Bourne has it easy escaping the local authorities either. In one of the film's best moments, he and Marie race through the streets of Paris in a mind blowing car chase the likes of which haven't been seen on the big screen in quite some time. Meaning it's done in a manner that won't require audiences to suspend their disbelief to enjoy it.The film's conclusion is a bit unsatisfying but makes sense given the way the story plays out.Recommended.",4,A top notch action thriller,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,3579,"['Bourne', 'Identity', 'audience', 'favorite', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'hands', 'dirty', 'role', 'retain', 'nice', 'guy', 'attitude', 'also', 'kick', 'tail', 'best', 'secret', 'agents', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'film.Already', 'having', 'been', 'made', '1988', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'movie', 'liberies', 'cold', 'war', 'plot', 'original', 'Ludlum', 'novel', 'still', 'one', 'excellent', 'thriller.A', 'man', 'Damon', 'found', 'floating', 'more', 'dead', 'alive', 'sea', 'Italian', 'fishing', 'crew', 'captain', 'who', 'thing', 'two', 'surgery', 'man', 'wounds', 'two', 'bullets', 'microchip', 'back.After', 'man', 'amnesia', 'clue', 'identity', 'other', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'found', 'chip.With', 'other', 'follow', 'man', 'Switzerland', 'account', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box', 'box', 'exorbitant', 'amount', 'money', 'gun', 'several', 'passports', 'identities', 'one', 'Jason', 'Borne.Deciding', 'assume', 'Borne', 'identity', 'man', 'barely', 'time', 'ponder', 'next', 'move', 'military', 'squad', 'policemen', 'ambush', 'him.As', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Damon', 'role', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'who', 'right', 'notes', 'setting', 'up', 'drama', 'delivering', 'pulse-pounding', 'high-octane', 'action', 'scenes', 'Now', ""n't"", 'next', 'run', 'commercials', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'is.When', 'Bourne', 'escape', 'pursuers', 'fire', 'escape', 'Liman', ""n't"", 'just', 'settle', 'quick', 'hop', 'down', 'Bourne', 'scale', 'down', 'building', 'Liman', 'camera', 'just', 'right', 'angles', 'show', ""n't"", 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'try', 'home', 'assuming', 'lived', '12-story', 'high-rise.Since', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'complete', 'romance', 'matter', 'how', 'trite', 'may', 'be', 'Bourne', 'meet', 'unattached', 'female', 'manner.While', 'run', 'Marie', 'Krutz', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'coincidentally', 'enough', 'unattached', 'female', 'need', 'cash', 'Well', 'cash', 'Bourne', 'Marie', '10,000', 'ride', 'Paris', 'Guess', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Metro', 'Thankfully', 'Marie', 'not', 'portrayed', 'cliched', 'tagalong', 'sidekick', 'actually', 'significantly', 'Bourne', 'search', 'true', 'identity.Bourne', 'out', 'exhaustive', 'plan', 'securing', 'information', 'hotel', 'only', 'have', 'Marie', 'get', 'flirting', 'hotel', 'attendant.It', 'out', 'Bourne', 'pursuers', 'are', 'none', 'other', 'CIA', 'rather', 'CIA', 'division', 'spearheaded', 'Ted', 'Conklin', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'Bourne', 'dead', 'keeping', 'supervisor', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'dark', 'real', 'reason', 'Bourne', 'action.Rather', 'mission', 'longer', 'necessary', 'Cooper', 'three', 'assassins', 'terminate', 'Bourne', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'last', 'mission', 'Bourne', 'was', 'sent', 'out', 'accomplish.Liman', 'introduces', 'assassins', 'perfectly', 'having', 'speak', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'only', 'putting', 'camera', 'enough', 'remind', 'audience', 'are', 'prevalent', 'threat', 'right', 'Bourne', 'point', 'become', 'as', 'threatening', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.Not', 'Bourne', 'easy', 'escaping', 'local', 'authorities', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'Marie', 'race', 'streets', 'Paris', 'mind', 'blowing', 'car', 'chase', 'likes', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'quite', 'time', 'Meaning', 'done', 'manner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'require', 'audiences', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'it.The', 'film', 'conclusion', 'bit', 'unsatisfying', 'sense', 'given', 'way', 'story', 'out.Recommended']",N/A

Both versions are available so it is up to the viewer as to which to choose.  This is not a director's cut of the film since there is a message (or a disclaimer) that Doug Liman did not participate.  Prior to the start of the extended version is a discussion with the producer and writer as to why the extended version was issued and why, after September 11, the decision was made to tone down the film by removing explosions from the ending.  I found the discussion a bit long-winded and skipped out of it to the movie.The changes to the film relate the action in a flash back.  Jason is in Greece searching for Marie when he gets a positive identification from a tourist and is drinking a bottle of Orangina when he topples over.  Cut to the start of the theatrical version of the film.  I have not read any of Robert Ludlum's books so I do not know how they compare to the movie.  However, a direct translation of the books to the screen is not possible: there is far too much to include.I saw the Bourne Identity the weekend it was released and liked it from the start.  The intent of the film was to make a fast paced action movie but without creating sensational stunts that did not advance the story.  Still the fight sequences and the chase in the streets of Paris are extraordinary.  More important is the chemistry between the amnesic Jason and Marie, the hard-up German girl who agrees to give him a ride from Zurich to Paris.  As we get closer to knowing who and what Jason Bourne is, it is the developing relationship between Marie and Jason that holds our attention.After watching the film to just about the very end, you can switch to the alternate ending. The new ending has Jason Bourne waking up with Brian Cox, who had ordered the murder of Chris Cooper's character.  Mr. Cox seems rather avuncular in this scene and informs Jason of where Marie is but lets him know that Treadstone is not more and he can do the odd killing job if he wants to.  The alternate ending is a little too neat for me and I don't think it adds anything to the film; interesting but not necessary.Of the extra features, there is an interesting look at Robert Ludlum through interviews with the author and some of his friends.  We also get a look at some of the stunts, a professional diagnosis of why Jason Bourne developed amnesia and interviews.

539592,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00003CXXM,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[3, 8]","Director Doug Liman deserves an academy award nomination for The Bourne Identity.  Alas, it will probably not happen because this stupendous film is not perceived as ""serious"" by the Hollywood snob elite.  Liman is a master of creating breath taking camera shots.  His talent is similar in this regard to the late StanleyKubrick.  The choreographed fighting scenes and highlights of Europe compel your rapt attention.  You will not be tempted to move your eyes away from the screen even for a split second. I have no idea if the film version is loyal to Robert Ludlum's novel, but this current interpretation is mind boggling effective and beautifully written.  The only thing required of the viewer is to suspend one's logical faculties.  This is not an intellectual Ipcress File or The Spy who Came in From the Cold.  Think James Bond with a dash of Our Man Flint, and allow yourself to be swept away by super spy and assassin, Jason Bourne.Matt Damon surprisingly succeeds as Bourne in this non stop escapist spy thriller.  He easily steps into the role of a CIA controlled agent who has lost his memory.  Why does he have couple of bullet holes in his back?  The lethal talents remain, but is he a good or evil man?  People are trying to either capture or murder him.  One thing leads to another, and our protagonist finds out that he might be a Jason Bourne who resides in Paris.  He also runs into Marie (Franka Potente) who helps Bourne escape from one especially threatening predicament.  And yes, there is the required chemistry exuded by the two lovers during their adventures together.  We learn that a CIA boss (Chris Cooper) relentlessly pursues Bourne to save his own skin.  Bourne failed to successfully carry out a mission and almost certainly will prove to be an embarrassment, if not even a career destroyer of his bosses.  There is never a dull moment in The Bourne Identify.  The remaining cast selection is near perfect.  Damon's youth virtually guarantees that he will be in many more action films.

The CIA believes he has failed a mission he was sent to accomplish in Europe.  When they learn he is alive, they quickly use a league of agents to hunt down Bourne before time runs out on the clock, and the men involved with the screw up get in real trouble.  The plot gets very detailed throughout the film, but this is the basic idea.Though there are some nice fight scenes and a great car chase in the film, the plot is always moving along, so there is little need for an abundance of action to keep things rolling.  I love films like this, cause when there is action, it actually holds some meaning when it occurs.  Bourne and the woman he accompanies (who the CIA is also after) share a great chemistry - both as characters and as actors.  The remainder of the cast is solid, and includes stars such as Julia Styles and Clive Owen - both who actually player lesser characters in the film, though nice to see.Best thing about this film is the non-stop running of Bourne.  He rarely gets time to stop for a breather, therefore making this film a very easy one for the viewer to stay alert to.  There is a detailed plot that takes a lot to follow every step of what's going on, but it is just as easy to watch if you prefer to sit back and enjoy the ride.Compared to James Bond in a sense, Bourne actually feels much more realistic.

First, the film utilizes an excellent cast. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the thinking man's action hero, bringing a complexity to the role that flies in the face of the typical cocky, wisecracking American action hero. Veteran actors like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox bring gravitas to their supporting roles, and Franka Potente brings an international, quirky sex appeal to her role as Jason's love interest.As great as the performers are, the script and direction also really deliver.

We need no more than to know that a Government Agency has a network of agents who can be used for black bag missions often involving ""taking out"" some person(s) to protect the nation. Bourne is one such agent, who has been shot and has, thereby, lost his memory, has become, to himself, a man without an identity. The Agency knows his identity, however, and when he surfaces in his search for who he is, they (for very vague reasons of security for the Agency from prying Congressional eyes), set out to liquidate him. He meets a girl along the way, and, of course, they fall in love.

Its cinematic success has launched two equally thrilling sequels to date, featuring Matt Damon as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne.A young man in a wet suit, with two bullet holes in his back, is rescued by the crew of a fishing boat in the Mediterranean Sea.  The young man recovers aboard the vessel, but has no memory of who he is or how he came to be in the water.  His only clue is the number of a Swiss bank account implanted in a metal tube in his hip.The man travels to Zurich and reaches the bank.  His account number provides him access to a safety deposit box, filled with a variety of foreign currencies, a small pile of passports, and a handgun.  The top passport is an American one, in the name of Jason Bourne, with an address in Paris.  The young man goes to the American Embassy in Zurich, where the staff unexpectedly tries to apprehend him and the young man unexpectedly displays astonishing fighting skills in escaping the Embassy.Outside the Embassy, Bourne bribes a rootless young German female named Marie (played with subtle depth by Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris.  Along the way, the two will bond over the mystery of Bourne's identity.  The mystery will deepen in Paris as Bourne realized he is the target of a murderous agency effort to clean up a mistake and as he realizes that keeping Marie alive is now a personal misssion.""The Bourne Identity"" features fast-moving, almost breathless action, lots of spy high-tech and technique, and enough convoluted mystery for at least three movies (and counting).  Matt Damon nicely underplays Bourne as a confused but driven man, aware that the clock is ticking in a game he doesn't fully understand.  The movie narrative proceeds on parallel tracks, as Bourne flees across France, while his nominal CIA boss (played with understated urgency by Chris Cooper) and another CIA chieftain (played with sweaty near-panic by Brian Cox) throw both CIA operatives and law enforcement in his path.  Clive Owen has a nice cameo as another CIA assassin; Julia Stiles is introduced in her recurring role as a Paris operative.  The climax of the movie is Bourne's dramatic entrance into a CIA safe house in Paris, there to learn the truth about his identity.""The Bourne Identity"" is very highly recommended as the thrilling introduction to the Bourne series.  The Extended Edition features a new beginning and ending to the movie designed to the events of 9/11, which somewhat pre-empted the Cold War context of the movie.  This DVD version also features some nice extras on the making of the movie.",5,"Bourne, Jason Bourne....",1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,2676,"['2002', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'absolutely', 'thrilling', 'loose', 'adaption', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', '1980', 'spy', 'novel', 'cinematic', 'success', 'launched', 'two', 'equally', 'thrilling', 'sequels', 'date', 'featuring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'former', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'Jason', 'Bourne.A', 'young', 'man', 'wet', 'suit', 'two', 'bullet', 'holes', 'back', 'rescued', 'crew', 'fishing', 'boat', 'Mediterranean', 'Sea', 'young', 'man', 'recovers', 'vessel', 'memory', 'who', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'water', 'only', 'clue', 'number', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'implanted', 'metal', 'tube', 'hip.The', 'man', 'Zurich', 'bank', 'account', 'number', 'access', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box', 'filled', 'variety', 'foreign', 'currencies', 'small', 'pile', 'passports', 'handgun', 'top', 'passport', 'American', 'one', 'name', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'address', 'Paris', 'young', 'man', 'American', 'Embassy', 'Zurich', 'where', 'staff', 'unexpectedly', 'apprehend', 'young', 'man', 'unexpectedly', 'astonishing', 'fighting', 'skills', 'escaping', 'Embassy.Outside', 'Embassy', 'Bourne', 'rootless', 'young', 'German', 'female', 'named', 'Marie', 'played', 'subtle', 'depth', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'drive', 'Paris', 'way', 'two', 'will', 'bond', 'mystery', 'Bourne', 'identity', 'mystery', 'will', 'deepen', 'Paris', 'Bourne', 'realized', 'target', 'murderous', 'agency', 'effort', 'clean', 'up', 'mistake', 'keeping', 'Marie', 'alive', 'now', 'personal', 'misssion', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'fast-moving', 'almost', 'breathless', 'action', 'lots', 'spy', 'high-tech', 'technique', 'enough', 'convoluted', 'mystery', 'least', 'three', 'movies', 'counting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'nicely', 'underplays', 'Bourne', 'confused', 'driven', 'man', 'aware', 'clock', 'ticking', 'game', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'movie', 'narrative', 'proceeds', 'parallel', 'tracks', 'Bourne', 'France', 'nominal', 'CIA', 'boss', 'played', 'understated', 'urgency', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'CIA', 'chieftain', 'played', 'sweaty', 'near-panic', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'throw', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'law', 'enforcement', 'path', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'nice', 'cameo', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'introduced', 'recurring', 'role', 'Paris', 'operative', 'climax', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'dramatic', 'entrance', 'CIA', 'safe', 'house', 'Paris', 'learn', 'truth', 'identity', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'thrilling', 'introduction', 'Bourne', 'series', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'new', 'beginning', 'ending', 'movie', 'designed', 'events', '9/11', 'somewhat', 'pre-empted', 'Cold', 'War', 'context', 'movie', 'DVD', 'version', 'also', 'nice', 'extras', 'making', 'movie']",N/A

Starring Matt Damon as a guy with no past and no identity, ""The Bourne Identity"" strives to be a thinking man's action flick and only ends up being another mediocre shoot-'em-up, with Damon's earnest performance as one of the few highlights.A man (Matt Damon) is found floating in the ocean, and is picked up by a rickety fishing boat. He has no memory of who he is, or why there are a couple of bullets lodged in his back. He sets out on a journey to find out who he is, uncovering a gun, the name Jason Bourne, and a lot of money in Zurich. Unfortunately, very deadly people seem to creeping out of the woodwork to kill him.He picks up a rather clueless traveller (Franka Potente), who agrees to drive him to where he wants to go. (Why doesn't he drive himself?) But as Bourne keeps uncovering clues about his past, he learns that his past is as an assassin -- and it seems to be his old boss who now wants him dead, gone and forgotten. Only Bourne doesn't plan to go down without a fight. (Or a sequel film)Don't worry, James -- ""Bourne Identity"" doesn't threaten the Bond franchise. It feels like a bunch of loosely strung-together action scenes with a lot of cinematic flourishes. ""Wow! Check out THIS cool scene!"" director Doug Liman seems to be constantly saying. But unfortunately it makes for a rather dull action flick -- and definitely not a smart or suspenseful one.The scriptwork and direction are pretty mediocre. Liman adds little to the proceedings, although some of the camerawork -- such as the car bumping down a staircase -- is fairly thrilling. Unfortunately, he uses his little tricks too often, and soon you'll be craving something a little slower and more complicated, rather than a string of action flourishes.And the script itself feels half-baked. More character development and ""quiet moments"" between action scenes would have brought everything to life. But the few moments of character development are hurried, so we can see Damon beat up a few more thugs. Suspense? Not much at all -- the Bourne identity is painfully obvious.Matt Damon does seem to be giving it his best as Bourne. While his acting is so-so, and his character feels incomplete, he does look like he's giving it his all. Franka Potente is forgettable as the token love interest; all Marie does is go to bed with Bourne, and react to every crisis by tottering around with her eyes and mouth wide open. And Julia Stiles fans had better not blink, or they might miss her role.""The Bourne Identity"" strains to be a smart, sexy, tightly-wound thriller, but only becomes an an average wad of summer shoot-'em-up brain candy.

My only grumble is that we never get to see Potente in any state of undress, not even undergarments!  But that hardly sinks the movie in and of itself, mind you.The fight scenes are mostly economical and entertaining---in part because Matt Damon employs the rarely-seen and reality-based Filipino martial art of Kali (explosive close quarters elbows, knees, trapping and grappling) as opposed to the usual absurd Hollywood bastardizations of Tae Kwon Do (fancy spinning jump kicks and other transparently useless fluff).  Liman shows a refreshing and admirable self-restraint in these stock action sequences, from the fight scenes to the requisite car chase to the one LARGE EXPLOSION near the end---unlike most action directors, he smoothly blends those formulaic elements into the story without turning them INTO the story itself.  Bang bang, chop socky whack, kaboom kabam---then he moves on instead of dwelling on the special effects.The soundtrack is excellent and adds a lot to the movie's atmospherics---it made me glad to have invested in a decent home theatre sound system with a good subwoofer.All in all, excellent light escapist entertainment when you want it.",4,Smart and very well-crafted...,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,1825,"['usually', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'action', 'flicks', 'occasionally', 'Hollywood', 'manages', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'so', 'well-made', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'can', 'easily', 'overlook', 'stock', 'characters', 'cliches', 'unavoidable', 'fundamental', 'lack', 'originality', 'substance', 'surprise.Here', 'have', 'very', 'capable', 'original', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'who', 'did', 'excellent', 'indie', 'film', 'Swingers', 'two', 'very', 'capable', 'leads', 'always-sympathetic', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'strangely', 'fetching', 'Franke', 'Potente', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'gorgeous', 'stage', 'set', 'Europe', 'specifically', 'Prague', 'standing', 'Zurich', 'parts', 'Paris', 'Paris', 'only', 'grumble', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'Potente', 'state', 'undress', 'not', 'even', 'undergarments', 'hardly', 'movie', 'mind', 'you.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'economical', 'entertaining', '-in', 'part', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'rarely-seen', 'reality-based', 'Filipino', 'martial', 'art', 'Kali', 'explosive', 'close', 'quarters', 'elbows', 'knees', 'trapping', 'grappling', 'opposed', 'usual', 'absurd', 'Hollywood', 'bastardizations', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'fancy', 'spinning', 'jump', 'kicks', 'other', 'transparently', 'useless', 'fluff', 'Liman', 'refreshing', 'admirable', 'self-restraint', 'stock', 'action', 'sequences', 'fight', 'scenes', 'requisite', 'car', 'chase', 'one', 'LARGE', 'EXPLOSION', 'end', 'most', 'action', 'directors', 'smoothly', 'formulaic', 'elements', 'story', 'turning', 'INTO', 'story', 'Bang', 'bang', 'chop', 'socky', 'whack', 'kaboom', 'kabam', 'instead', 'dwelling', 'special', 'effects.The', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'lot', 'movie', 'atmospherics', '-it', 'made', 'glad', 'have', 'invested', 'decent', 'home', 'theatre', 'sound', 'system', 'good', 'subwoofer.All', 'excellent', 'light', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'when', 'want']",N/A

I've never read any of Ludlum's books nor am I likely to after watching this film.I found this movie to be a wild kaleidoscope of utter confusion, solved in the final few minutes with no degree of satisfaction.  But.  It is incredibly absorbing in that we're strung along for the bulk of the film, learning very little along the way, and yet there is a high interest in what happens to this poor little putz who can't remember who he is or what he's done to deserve so many attempts on his life.  I actually found the reason behind the need to kill Bourne a bit dopey.  Bourne was never the problem; the old farts in charge of Treadstone were the problem.  Anytime you construct something that elaborate and unwieldy, you are doomed.  Too many people to keep track of, too many lies, too much of a paper trail.  When things go wrong, as they inevitably do, the first impulse is to lie, cover-up, or dispose of those perceived of as threats; no one wants to get caught, and yet they put themselves into a predicament where that's the only outcome.  Very little of that is entertaining because it's expected.  The only surprise for me was that I liked this movie in spite of the fact I hate these kinds of conspiracies.Kudos to Matt Damon for creating a believable and sympathetic character.

He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life. After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity. With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller. It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences. What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging. The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes.From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works. Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry. Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond/M:I route with a new love interest in every installment. Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does. Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or M:I).For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris. I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up. Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, &quot;Hey, it's Julia Stiles!&quot;) in a role that could have been played by just about anyone. But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.",4,A solid spy thriller.,1064620800,"09 27, 2003",2003,2820,"['Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'afloat', 'sea', 'several', 'bullets', 'back', 'salvaged', 'fishing', 'boat', 'awakens', 'discover', 'memory', 'previous', 'life', 'shore', 'find', 'true', 'identity', 'assistance', 'pretty', 'German', 'woman', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Bourne', 'run', 'covert', 'assassins', 'trying', 'kill', 'top', 'government', 'agents', 'trying', 'cover', 'tracks.The', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'interesting', 'summer', 'thriller', 'certainly', 'not', 'all-out', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'previews', 'might', 'lead', 'believe', 'are', 'terrific', 'action', 'sequences', 'What', 'truly', 'film', 'work', 'Damon', 'first', 'bid', 'action', 'star', 'completely', 'convincing', 'engaging', 'movie', 'nicely', 'dark', 'past', 'know', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'discovery', 'certain', 'point-of-view', 'Franka', 'Potente', ""n't"", 'useful', 'love', 'interest', 'level', 'presence', 'works', 'Not', 'only', 'fine', 'actress', 'Damon', 'share', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'return', 'sequel', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'Bond/M', 'route', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'installment', 'Take', 'note', 'Hollywood', 'steadiness', 'consistent', 'relationships', 'are', 'always', 'appreciated.The', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'premise', 'similar', 'Long', 'Kiss', 'Goodnight', 'movie', 'story', 'seriously', 'aspires', 'work', 'thriller', 'character-oriented', 'drama', 'Once', 'Bourne', 'past', 'revealed', 'not', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'bit', 'momentum', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'believably', 'suprisingly', 'somewhat', 'quiet', 'fashion', 'compared', 'say', 'Bond', 'Triple', 'X', 'M', '.For', 'action', 'fans', 'enough', 'here', 'keep', 'satisfied', 'standout', 'setpieces', 'being', 'excellent', 'martial', 'arts', 'fight', 'set', 'eerily', 'empty', 'apartment', 'exhilarating', 'car', 'chase', 'streets', 'Paris', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'auto', 'chases', 'set', 'Paris', 'Ronin', 'Transporter', 'one', 'favorite', 'even', 'also', 'shortest', 'least', 'attractive', 'car', 'mini', 'compared', 'Audi', 'Ronin', 'BMW', 'Transporter', 'are', 'few', 'disappointments', 'here', 'there', 'particularly', 'Bourne', 'showdown', 'Professor', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'considering', 'huge', 'build-up', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'also', 'film', 'presence', 'rather', 'distracting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Hey', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'quot', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'just', 'anyone', 'end', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'rarely', 'over-the-top', 'megalomaniacal', 'here', 'even', 'tone', 'establishes', 'likeable', 'characters', 'good', 'storytelling']",N/A

Now that they have grown up they want to go from the cerebral to the action oriented in one bound.  Right now you could go to the theater and find  Ben Affleck playing a C.I.A. Analyst in The Sum of All Fears or you could check out the adaptation of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon as the lead.  I can't speak for the latter but you might want to wait and rent this one.Matt Damon plays the title role of Jason Borne.  Borne has a lot of special talents unfortunately he has to learn about them one at a time because, well, he has lost his memory.  It seems that he was pulled out of the ocean with two bullets in him as well as a nice little micro-chip.  The men on this ship thought he was dead but much to their surprise he is still alive and after some quick surgery, healing rather rapidly.  He doesn't know who he is or how he came to be in the ocean.  He does know that he seems to speak multiple languages fluently and that this chip is leading him to an address of a bank in Zurich.After getting to this bank, the man discovers that he appears to have multiple identities of which Jason Borne seems the most comfortable.  He also has quite a bit of cash, some weapons, and after being attacked...a good deal of fighting skills he was unaware of possessing.  Borne is forced on the run to discover his identity.  Unfortunately the longer he is on the run, the more people with similar skills pop up trying to kill him.  It seems that a major governmental agency is not happy having supposedly dead agents reappear without contacting them.First off  I must admit that I have never read the original book so I cannot comment as to how accurate an adaptation this movie is.  That being said, I will state this is a very uneven movie.  The action sequences are first rate and engrossing.  The speed of them can keep you riveted on the edge of your seat.  That's the good news.The bad news is that the rest of the movie moves as a snails pace and doesn't sustain the suspense in the slightest.  If anything the middle sequences slow the movie considerably.  Also, the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere.  The beginning makes some sense for story purposes but the end just happens with no particular climactic moment.  One minute the movie is going along and the next...it just stops dead in its tracks.  It almost leaves you wanting more with the earnest hope that something else will happen to explain the movie.Matt Damon does do a good job in the title role.  He is very believable as someone who has lost all touch with himself and suddenly finds people all converging with his face in their scope.  He is pretty phenomenal in the action sequences and they were quite surprising in their ferocity.  This movie is full of action but make no mistake, it is definitely PG-13 oriented as most of it is bloodless.Most of the rest of the actors have meaningless characters and could have been done by anyone.  Character actor Chris Cooper, Lone Star and The Patriot, is wasted as the ""villain"" and Julia Stiles, Save the Last Dance, is almost non-existent in her role.Did I hate the movie?  Not particularly but I was not totally entertained.

This is a suspense/thriller/action/spy movie that's character driven with a really great movie team in Director Doug Limon (Go, Swingers, The O.C.), Screen Writer Tony Gilroy (Deloris Claiborne, Devil's Advocate, and The Cutting Edge) and the Author of the novel `The Bourne Identity', Robert Ludlum as one of the executive producers along with Frank Marshall (all the `Indiana Jones' movies, all the `Back to the Future' movies, and The Sixth Sense) as executive producers.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne a man trained and conditioned to disappear by a Black Ops Division of the CIA but something has gone wrong. Unconscious and wounded he was rescued by a fishing boat off the coast of France with out his memory; two bullet holes to the back and a numbered Swiss Bank account  are his only clues to his identity. Of course, his former employer is now also looking for him and things get complicated.In comes Marie (Franka Potenta) a young women who gives Jason Bourne a ride to Paris. This is first and foremost an action film but there is no denying the chemistry that exists between the characters of Jason and Marie so it's interesting to see the dynamics of Action, Suspense, and Romantic Hope!I won't go into the movie as it's more fun to watch and see for your self but it was a great action movie with wonderful performances throughout. I will say Chris Cooper (Lone Star, American Beauty, and Seabiscuit) plays the Black Ops director and gives a glowing performance. Can you tell I really like Chris Cooper?The direction in this movie was superb. Doug Limon did an excellent job of telling this story and setting the mood with innovative camera work that gave you a feel for each character and scene. When the character was off kilter he made you feel off kilter with his careful, deliberate direction. I will have to make an effort to see more of Doug Limon's films.This movie was energetic, polished, and had a visual style unique to the genre of action adventure with a lot of great writing, direction, and performance!",4,"Matt Damon and Franka Potenta, can it get any sexier?",1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,2037,"['Okay', 'suspense/thriller/action/spy', 'movie', 'character', 'driven', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'team', 'Director', 'Doug', 'Limon', 'Go', 'Swingers', 'O.C', 'Screen', 'Writer', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'Deloris', 'Claiborne', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'Cutting', 'Edge', 'Author', 'novel', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'Frank', 'Marshall', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movies', 'Back', 'Future', 'movies', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'executive', 'producers.Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'man', 'trained', 'conditioned', 'disappear', 'Black', 'Ops', 'Division', 'CIA', 'something', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Unconscious', 'wounded', 'was', 'rescued', 'fishing', 'boat', 'coast', 'France', 'out', 'memory', 'two', 'bullet', 'holes', 'back', 'numbered', 'Swiss', 'Bank', 'account', 'are', 'only', 'clues', 'identity', 'course', 'former', 'employer', 'now', 'also', 'looking', 'things', 'get', 'complicated.In', 'Marie', 'Franka', 'Potenta', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'ride', 'Paris', 'first', 'foremost', 'action', 'film', 'denying', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'Jason', 'Marie', 'interesting', 'see', 'dynamics', 'Action', 'Suspense', 'Romantic', 'Hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'see', 'self', 'was', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'will', 'say', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Lone', 'Star', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Seabiscuit', 'Black', 'Ops', 'director', 'glowing', 'performance', 'Can', 'tell', 'really', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'direction', 'movie', 'was', 'superb', 'Doug', 'Limon', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'setting', 'mood', 'innovative', 'camera', 'work', 'gave', 'feel', 'character', 'scene', 'When', 'character', 'was', 'off', 'kilter', 'made', 'feel', 'off', 'kilter', 'careful', 'deliberate', 'direction', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'effort', 'see', 'more', 'Doug', 'Limon', 'films.This', 'movie', 'was', 'energetic', 'polished', 'had', 'visual', 'style', 'unique', 'genre', 'action', 'adventure', 'lot', 'great', 'writing', 'direction', 'performance']",N/A

Considering that Jason has amnesia and doesn't even remember his own name, you can hardly blame him for the mayhem that follows - he's just acting out of self-preservation.  With the help of Marie, he slowly begins to uncover details about his past, including the fact that that he was a highly trained CIA assassin involved in high level operations.  But now the CIA is trying to eliminate him - why?  While on the run from his own government, Bourne slowly makes a transition from confused amnesiac to an efficient combat machine, and at the end shows real touches of being sympathetic and human, even if this isn't entirely credible given his professional resume.  In fact throughout the story he comes across as genuinely concerned for the people close to him, and even while keeping the trained operatives at bay he's presented as a sympathetic character who isn't motivated by revenge or blood-lust, and any violence he causes only happens because there seems to be no alternative.As far as action films go, there's something refreshing about the way that The Bourne Identity has made the transition from Robert Ludlum's popular book to the big screen, despite significant changes to the original.  The plot features a spy thriller narrative reminiscent from the days of the Cold War (although with a post-Cold War setting here), and raises compelling questions immediately from the outset, as viewers share Jason's desperate questions to discover who he is, why he has bullet wounds in his back and details of a numbered Swiss bank account in his hip.  The chase scenes and suspense rarely disappoint, and even though the body count in the film is reasonably high, gore isn't the central interest, and even the fight sequences are for the most part about efficiency rather than eye candy - there's no unnecessary bullets or explosions, and the end result makes the action more believable.  The extended car chase early in the film is one of the best you'll see in the business. Parents should be forewarned about several instances of profanity and blasphemy, but fortunately these don't dominate the film, and even the chemistry between Bourne and his counterpart is muted and relatively tasteful.It's not suitable for children, but mature adults will find some decent entertainment here.  Much of it might be considered cliche and generic, but The Bourne Identity does a good job of it.  Fans of action thrillers will enjoy something that is fast and furious without becoming larger than life or over the top, and with a sympathetic fugitive that is just as much a man as a machine, and who has a real conscience.  This might not redeem the film from all its flaws, but it does go some ways to making it stand out from the average. - GODLY GADFLY",4,"Imagine waking up not knowing who you are, and then discovering people are trying to kill you",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,2886,"['Jason', 'Bourne', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'So', 'extended', 'chase', 'film', 'action', 'movie', 'Considering', 'Jason', 'amnesia', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'own', 'name', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'mayhem', 'just', 'acting', 'self-preservation', 'help', 'Marie', 'slowly', 'uncover', 'details', 'past', 'including', 'fact', 'was', 'highly', 'trained', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'involved', 'high', 'level', 'operations', 'now', 'CIA', 'trying', 'eliminate', 'why', 'run', 'own', 'government', 'Bourne', 'slowly', 'transition', 'confused', 'amnesiac', 'efficient', 'combat', 'machine', 'end', 'real', 'touches', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'human', 'even', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'credible', 'given', 'professional', 'resume', 'fact', 'story', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'people', 'close', 'even', 'keeping', 'trained', 'operatives', 'bay', 'presented', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'motivated', 'revenge', 'blood-lust', 'violence', 'only', 'be', 'alternative.As', 'far', 'action', 'films', 'go', 'something', 'refreshing', 'way', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'made', 'transition', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'popular', 'book', 'big', 'screen', 'significant', 'changes', 'original', 'plot', 'spy', 'thriller', 'narrative', 'reminiscent', 'days', 'Cold', 'War', 'post-Cold', 'War', 'setting', 'here', 'compelling', 'questions', 'immediately', 'outset', 'viewers', 'share', 'Jason', 'desperate', 'questions', 'discover', 'who', 'why', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'back', 'details', 'numbered', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'hip', 'chase', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'rarely', 'disappoint', 'even', 'body', 'count', 'film', 'reasonably', 'high', 'gore', ""n't"", 'central', 'interest', 'even', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'efficiency', 'rather', 'eye', 'candy', 'unnecessary', 'bullets', 'explosions', 'end', 'result', 'action', 'more', 'believable', 'extended', 'car', 'chase', 'early', 'film', 'one', 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'business', 'Parents', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'several', 'instances', 'profanity', 'blasphemy', 'fortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'film', 'even', 'chemistry', 'Bourne', 'counterpart', 'muted', 'relatively', 'tasteful.It', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'mature', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'here', 'Much', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'cliche', 'generic', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'good', 'job', 'Fans', 'action', 'thrillers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'something', 'fast', 'furious', 'becoming', 'larger', 'life', 'top', 'sympathetic', 'fugitive', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'man', 'machine', 'who', 'real', 'conscience', 'might', 'not', 'redeem', 'film', 'flaws', 'go', 'ways', 'making', 'stand', 'out', 'average', 'GODLY', 'GADFLY']",N/A

He is in a wetsuit and has been shot twice in the back.  He also has an implanted device in his hip that gives the name and address of a bank in Zurich.  The man (Jason Bourne) doesn't remember who he is or how he came to be in the water.  His only clue is the numbered bank account.  So he heads off to Switzerland.  From there everything else follows; he finds money, six passports and a gun.  So who am I and what do I do?  Well my first guess would be that your a spy, but in the movies it's never that simple.There are a couple of incidents that don't ring true: 1)how he crosses the border into Switzerland on a train without a passport is not explained, 2) how Marie manages to park behind the bank when no else is parked there,3)having been on the fishing boat for three weeks his hair looks like he had it cut yesterday (in fact it looks that way through the whole movie),  4)when he drives with Marie overnight to Paris (say twelve hours), sleeping in the car, when he awakes, he clean shaven, no stubble at all (and once again not a hair out of place)and 5) he doesn't seem at all surprise when he beats the crap out of two Swiss Police on his first night in Zurich.",5,Without a Doubt one of the best Spy Thrillers Ever Made,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1804,"['kind', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'John', 'Huston', 'proud', 'have', 'made', 'read', 'original', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'book', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'found', 'one', 'books', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', 'remember', 'staying', 'up', 'night', 'just', 'finish', 'movie', 'as', 'true', 'book', 'anyone', 'could', 'want', 'constantly', 'keeping', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'ending', 'type', 'will', 'satisfy', 'just', 'everyone', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'second', 'ending', 'kind', 'throw', 'away.A', 'short', 'synopsys', 'man', 'found', 'floating', 'Mediterranean', 'fishing', 'boat', 'wetsuit', 'been', 'shot', 'twice', 'back', 'also', 'implanted', 'device', 'hip', 'name', 'address', 'bank', 'Zurich', 'man', 'Jason', 'Bourne', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'water', 'only', 'clue', 'numbered', 'bank', 'account', 'Switzerland', 'everything', 'else', 'money', 'six', 'passports', 'gun', 'who', 'am', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'Well', 'first', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'spy', 'movies', 'never', 'are', 'couple', 'incidents', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', '1', 'how', 'border', 'Switzerland', 'train', 'passport', 'not', 'explained', '2', 'how', 'Marie', 'park', 'bank', 'when', 'else', 'parked', 'there,3', 'having', 'been', 'fishing', 'boat', 'three', 'weeks', 'hair', 'had', 'cut', 'yesterday', 'fact', 'way', 'whole', 'movie', '4', 'when', 'Marie', 'overnight', 'Paris', 'say', 'twelve', 'hours', 'sleeping', 'car', 'when', 'clean', 'shaven', 'stubble', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'hair', 'place', '5', ""n't"", 'seem', 'surprise', 'when', 'crap', 'two', 'Swiss', 'Police', 'first', 'night', 'Zurich']",N/A

539647,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B00003CXXM,guillermoj,"[3, 5]","I did not see this movie when it first came out as I am getting tired of the summer extravaganzas that try to outdo one another with how many more explosions they can generate than what is playing in the next theatre. Notwithstanding,  I decided to give it a shot as I loved the energy and pacing of director Doug Liman's ""Go,"" and also liked the comedic edge and freshness that he brought to his debut (""Swingers""). I was still somewhat apprehensive as taut and original action thrillers are very hard to come by as most current movies couple the violence with buddy comedy elements that take away from a genre that has only been successfully executed by Steven Spielberg in his wildly entertaining ""Minority Report"". But I digress.Since I hate it when reviewers give too much away, I will only say that Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne (or is he?), a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. The scene itself is very exciting and draws you into it's web. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. What follows gets very complicated and keeps you on the edge of your seat as other summer extravaganzas seem to fail to. Like its summer ""cousins"", the movie has action scenes, guns, explosions, an awesome car chase (that relies more on execution than on how many cars can explode), a potential love interest, and many of the usual suspects, BUT it entertains and I did not feel like checking my watch every 5 minutes. Is it Oscar material? Heck no, but within its own genre its one of the year's best.Matt Damon, who I never quite appreciate, would seem to be miscast to play this type of character, but he is actually quite perfect is he tones it down and makes Jason Bourne almost seem like an everyman who slowly discovers that he has skills he never knew he had. The casting department should be proud of itself as it cast Franka Potente (from ""Run Lola Run"") as the main female protagonist. The actress is not your cookie cutter beauty nor has the marquee appeal that I am sure the producers would have liked to have a ""name"" for the role; but someone realized that her acting chops and international background would give the movie some grounding as her character is supposed to be a European gypsy woman who I could not see being played by say Julia Roberts.The director does a great job in both action and character driven scenes and manages to bring excitement to a gray winter European exteriors and drab interior settings. With the exception of the first fight sequence (which is makes Damon look like he has superhero powers) and later what would seem to be a physically impossible shoot out, everything feels real and the violence is not stylized. The story is incredibly well paced and even the smaller roles are well cast. The only exception is Julia Stiles, who I hope was only a victim of some scenes winding up on the cutting room floor, as she's a talented actress who brings not a thing to this movie.In a nutshell, this movie is about international intrigue and one man's refusal to be a pawn in some sinister, global chess game. Many things feel improbable but never less than engrossing. Also, the basic premise is not played for laughs (which I enjoyed as I am sick of tongue in cheek homages that use humor as a cop out) and the plot (once fully exposed)  for once does not involve a ""brilliant"" psychopath with either a desire to take over the world or get even for ______ (fill in the blank with your favorite clich&eacute;).

Directed by Doug Liman (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), this visually pleasing spy thriller boasts excellent fight scenes, chase scenes, and suspense. Matt Damon does an outstanding job as Bourne.

Franka Potente, as Marie, does a fine job as the girl who gives Bourne a ride to Paris. Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Chris Cooper provide excellent acting support.

The director also directed &quot;Swingers&quot; and &quot;Go&quot;, and his indy-film background shows through in quite a few scenes where the tension is heightened by the use of handheld cameras and shooting in real locations without a crew.Damon is just outstanding as an amnesiac with a growing sense of dread about himself and his abilities, and Franka Potente has the presence and intelligence to bring off the character of the girl that helps him at first for money, and then later out of a combination of curiosity, tenacity, and aimlessness (she really doesn't have anything better to do).

I mean, they even have the same initials! Some might say that it is just being cliched to compare the two, but in my mind, it truly works. Where Bond is suave and impressionable, Bourne is direct and doesn't really care what people think of him. Of course they are similar, but if one keeps a cool head and doesn't get too critical, both franchises can be enjoyed without any trouble. The film definitely departs from the source material, but not to its discredit. The film manages to transcend the genre by taking the places and names from the books and create its own original story. It follows the baseline of the books, but crafts a world for our main character which is plausible and modern enough to not even appear dated. The performances are all top-notch; as it should be, the persona Damon creates as Bourne is by far the best role in the film. I would say its absolutely one of his best roles - what one would call a tour-de-force performance. However, ample support is supplied from the rest of the cast also. Potente is especially good, and even though Cooper just seems pissed off all the time, it really is a testament to his acting abilities if one watches his other movies and understands his immense range. Something that only just recently came to me about these films is the diversity of the cast. There is Bourne, who is a definite loner, even when he's with Marie. He can never get over the changes that his experiences have forced him to make, and he is therefore incredibly tortured by conflicting emotions and thoughts all the time. So no matter who he interacts with, the focus is always on Bourne. He functions in all situations the same, and deals with everybody (except Marie) more or less the same. He is what he is, and you either love him or hate him - no gray area. Then we have those who are tracking and/or trying to kill him, and they have their own separate part of the movie that only sometimes interacts with Bourne. Because of all this, everything is literally on Damon's shoulders to carry the movie, and that is why he is so great. Just like Bourne, Damon has to stand out. If he doesn't, then his role means nothing, and the viewer doesn't care about what happens. This is much like what happens in ""Unknown"", the fairly recent Liam Neeson vehicle, which has a very similar storyline to the Bourne films. The movie also fits in rather nicely with the other two, and creates a viable trilogy. One might say that they prefer Liman's directing simply due to the fact he doesn't use choppy editing like Greengrass did, but I understand the need for both methods in their element and could not imagine either one to be any different. As with all three of the Bourne films, the action is astonishingly simple once one gets used to it, and anyone is more than welcome to freeze-frame and follow the choreography. Some have said that the way these films compose the action sequences is unnecessarily fast and showy. I disagree. The films' choreography is a symbol for the character of Bourne. The action is literally so fast it's over before you even realize, much like it is from Bourne's side of things. Due to his amnesia, he doesn't understand what he's doing either, per se. It's a reflex for him to react the way he does. He just does it, without hesitation or remorse, which is exactly why he's so good as an agent. I will say that for me, the franchise's only disadvantage is for anyone who's never seen the films before. When I first watched the films, I didn't really understand it either. It was all too complicated for me at the time. But after watching all three of the Damon films (haven't seen Legacy yet) several times once I got older, I have progressively understood what is going on within each one. Once I understand what's going on, it's a piece of cake to invest myself in the story and characters. But for those who are beginners like I was at one time, the films probably seem horrible. That's when I would say to stick with them for the long haul - watch them all again, if you have to. I love these films, and I would strongly recommend them to anyone.

There were a number of key action sequences, including a car chase involving a Mini taking on French police, and the wildest stairway descent I've ever seen on film.

(One of these days, maybe Damon will do a comedic turn to match Jeff Bridges' brilliant, hilarious riffing as The Dude in the otherwise ridiculous ""The Big Lebowski."")This is a tight, cool little action thriller with a lot of good, quasi-realistic fighting (so much more satisfying than bombastic Hollywood overkill, or the increasingly ludicrous flying and wirework that comes out of the Chinese martial-arts world).  The whole action sequence in the embassy is just perfectly rendered (even though it doesn't contribute much to the story).  So is the fight in the apartment.  Way to go!Damon as Jason Bourne is pretty cool and convincing, and it would be nice if he could become the 'new James Bond,' but I doubt that will happen because: 1) the whole existential-loner-without-a-cause trip is just not as much fun as blowing up Doctor No or Ernst Blofeld; and 2) let's face it, 'Jason Bourne' just isn't nearly as cool a name as James Bond.The one real problem with the movie is that the ostensible 'cause' of Bourne's amnesia is so rigged, so artificially constructed in order to place itself beyond reproach or criticism, that it's just not satisfying, and certainly not a good solution to the puzzle.  Then again, the puzzle is never really so important to this movie; it's all about the good performances, the tight filming, and those cool fights.[BONUS OPINIONATED BLATHER:  The DVD extras contain some peculiar hand-wringing about 9/11, and the idea that our country's CIA-sponsored international subterfuge and so-called ""Black Ops"" were once considered evil, but are now just hunky-dory.  This is problematic.  I am certainly no apologist for terrorists, and I believe in a clear-eyed and strong approach to confronting global terrorism (hey, listen, like it or not, we DO need a CIA); but it's important to recognize that our whole ""Black Ops""-style policy was a large contributing factor to the current mess as it grows and spreads.  Let's at least own up to that, and acknowledge the complexity of things -- and as we work to make ourselves safer in the world, we might also try working harder to make ourselves less hated.

The story is unluckily not entirely clear. He forgot his identity. Fine. He did not forget his physical training. Fine because that kind of training has been ingrained so deeply that it has become an instinct of sorts. But how did he remember he had a bank account in Zurich and the number of the bank account, and what's more why did not the CIA close the account since the operation  had failed and the agent was supposed to be dead? This leads to more questions, but that is not really important for the action, though we like it absolutely clean. The message however is not altered at all. The CIA is able to train agents that have become plain robots and that can only succeed blindly in their mission or die or kill themselves if the first two options do not go through. These killing robots are in the hands of bureaucrats who are mostly incompetent and these bureaucrats are in the hands of  politicians who are first and foremost rotten liars. The objective is simple: control the world with puppets who can be anything, democratic tyrants or tyrannical democrats, no matter which or their reverses, provided they serve well, otherwise they die and the human killing robots get into the picture. When this film came out the US were starting to get engaged in the war on terrorism. The picture of this CIA is pretty terroristic to me. We know now, several years later that it was not that competent in gathering information, though it did gather some, but we also know that the politicians who used the information they got were pretty liars and making the incomplete information they got say whatever they wanted it to say. Is that very democratic? At the end of the film, when the politician is engaged in some new lie to the Senate, we are just relieved because the killing robot agent, Jason Bourne, has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into. But the story cannot be finished because the CIA cannot let him live just like that out of the goodness of their heart, for one simple reason: they do not have a heart. In other words, the cold war is maybe finished, but the terroristic spying agencies, politically correctly named intelligence agencies, are still thriving and well.

On his quest for answers he realizes he has certain talents that normal folks don't normally wield.  Damon's ability to really get the viewer inside the characters head is great here because unlike normal action films you can really get into this one.  Also his calm under pressure convinces you that this character was once something very feared.  The plot itslef is decent.  A nice conspiracy thriller with a few twists here and there.  unfortunately the film doesn't hide the solution too well and if you pay close enough attention, and have seen enough thrillers, you can figure it out.  The action scenes are well done and while not too ridiculous are well choreographed and Damon shows he really mastered the role.  The supporting cast doesn't employ many big names and this is a good thing.  The provide a great web of mystery as the plot unfolds and we even get to see Julia Stiles in an uncharacteristic role.

It closes the gap between what's totally impossible and what could be somewhat believable (with a little imagination that is).The characters captured my interest immediately due to the perfect casting.  You feel like these are real people.They try to keep the main character sort of impersonable.  You rarely see him eat anything, no big sex scenes.  All of this is consistent with making him appear to be almost super human.It is quite funny at times as the girlfriend tries to comprehend what she has gotten herself into.

Its direction is inspired, its pace is quick and fun, and Matt Damon does an awesome job.However, having read the book long ago, I just can't get over what the writers did to the character of Marie. In the book, she is a brilliant, savvy financial banker, whose assistance is vital to Bourne discovering the truth about his origins. After she decides to trust him (because of her own keen observations and despite the fact that he does not trust himself), she would never leave him to his own devices. In the movie, she is basically... Well, not the most intelligent of women, a ""free spirit"" who is far less loyal than he.The movie's changes also include a liberal slant in the plotline (i.e. government is corrupt and its goals evil) foreign to the original Bourne, wherein the CIA acted in good faith based on the best information they had, and Bourne was a truly good man who because of weird circumstances believed he was truly evil. In this version, Bourne never even discovers his real name, let alone his true self. He's just ""on [his] own side now."" And the truth behind his killer instincts is left unclear.However, had I not read the book, these would be very small drawbacks. Indeed, they didn't keep me from enjoying the movie immensely. Its foreign locales, clever plot, and nonstop action make for a truly entertaining experience.Oh, as for the extras on the DVD, they don't add much. The Moby video is interspersed with so many clips from the movie it's like watching the flick all over again, and the documentary doesn't reveal anything fascinating.

In short this film delivers.The plot is excellent. Like Roger Zelazny's Amber Chronicles and Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun, the protagonist wakes in critical condition unable to remember himself, immediately confronting death while piecing together the puzzle of his own shattered identity. Meantime a hostile world seeks Jason Bourne's destruction.Loosely based on the inspired works of fiction by former US Marine Robert Ludlum, the Bourne Identity portrays the CIA MKUltra program of creating ""Manchurian Candidates"" (through a smorgasbord of hypnosis, martial arts training, and torture). Ie, hypno-programmed robot assassins: ""It's like behavioral software"". But in Jason Bourne's case the software has crashed: ""You're a malfunctioning thirty million dollar weapon"". The movie is also a mute commentary on the bitter heartlessness of the modern intelligence state, and the moral twilight of CIA Clandestine Services.Fished from the sea, healed by a wise old man, aided by a beautiful maiden, assaulted by ghouls, seeking to escape a labyrinth of unknown dangers, the hero triumphs. That's the Bourne Identity. Pure heroic myth depicted in great cinema.This is a dynamic movie with nine lives. What's more it has a happy ending.

It grossed $121 million in the U.S. theatres, and so many thought it was a failure, as it was hoped to be more of a blockbuster and bring in closer to what its total *worldwide* gross was - $214 million. Although $121 million is hardly a failure.

539689,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,B00003CXXM,Josef Bush,"[2, 3]","It may be Mat Damon himself.  Surely the leading man in a film of this kind is important, but at first glance, Damon has none of the obvious traits.  He isn't killer handsome.  Neither has he the body of a circus ariealist.  What he's got, it seems to me, is the ability to remind you of a younger brother who enlisted in the Navy and somehow wound up in the Seals.  Nobody had any idea.  One minute he's the hot-shot of the High School Baseball team, the next minute you're watching him get decorated dressed in whites.  You're so proud of him, even if you don't know what it is he does, precisely, and all your family loves him.So, as I say, no International Lounge Lizard with nouveau riche tastes, or a necklace of Euro-Trash beauties around his neck.But, when the movie begins and they haul him out of the sea, nearly dead, you see it.  And as he recovers from his wounds, it becomes clearer.  He's one of the brightest and the best; clean as a whistle, sharp as a tack.  Dad's favorite boy, memory clouded, somehow, and on a mission even he doesn't remember.  And whithout making any judgment about it, you've got a great deal invested in him; in seeming him safe and his enemies identified and routed.  Therefore, when the action begins, and it does immediately, one watches him negotiate the thorny mazes of predicaments of incredible complexity and menace, with ingenuity and dispatch.  One of the best demonhstrations of what he can do happens when he arrives in Paris, after getting his money and passports out of a Swiss bank.  ANd himself and a German girl of some sort with a car, out of the American Embassy trap.  Well, an assassion crashes into his Paris apartment before either of them can catch a breath, and there's a life and death flght which ends when the failed assassin thorws himself out of the window and dies on the sidewalk below.  That is the prelude to as brilliant and harrowing a demonstration of trick driving as I've ever seen, as Borne and the girl drive her Cooper Mini through the mazes and tangles of fast, congested Parisian traffic, followed by police cruisers and motorcycle mounted cops.  Thrilling!  And that's just the first third of the film.Rather than describe the remainder of the story in detail, I will say, instead, that the director does not allow the project to make any fatal mistakes.  He doesn't flirt with us; doesn't try to seduce us into liking the movie with mugging or stupid action jokes.  He doesn't use kids that way.  Or animals.  Or any people.  There are no faux literary pretensions anywhere.  Although there are people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in the film, there's no ethnic or racial humor.  There are no shameful and insincere attempts to conjure up a facile moral to the story by juggling religioius symbols.  The sexual attraction of the hero and heroine to one another isn't either lewd or tricky, but grows inevitably out of the inter-reliance that builds between them as they cling to life and avoid discovery.  What attracts her is his freshness, frankness, fearlessness and his determination to protect her from enemies that are really his alone.  Their care for each other becomes as artless and as inevitable as sunrise.The sound track is good and the intercut POP music is as one would expect it, but the music is never distracting.Seems to me I've watched this show 3 times now, and it looks better and better every time.  The complex entity that IDENTITY is has been handled with such deftness and skill that no shot or sequence appears to have been derived from any shot or sequence in any other film.

A James Bond on Steroids like character that seems to have made the Bond series get more intense with the likes of Daniel Craig as Bond.There is definate passionate action here.  We see a man who is washed out at sea, with amnesia, wondering who he is and why.  Quickly he has an identity, yet too many in the form of multiple passports, and tons of cash, when he goes to a bank vault in Switzerland, that is the only form of information he has on him when he is rescued.  Things go from the darkness of not knowing who you are to a mad rush to escape seeming capture.  Not only that, he has all these amazing skills, martial arts, technical skills, ability to size up things where ever he goes.  What does it all mean?Additionally, as he escapes from one place where armed US Marines are chasing him, he happens along a young woman who is actually a drifter with no real place to go.  He has money, identification, but who is he, and he has an address, lets go there.  We flash back and forth from Bourne on the run and CIA headquarters, where his handlers are wondering where he had been for weeks, now he is run amok.Although a very violent movie from the perspective of fighting and shootings, the movie is simply not bloody or full of gore.  So, you can focus on the action and story, not the gore.  Clive Owen plays a very serious focused asset of the CIA. He is like Bourne, trained to kill.  He says very few words, and comes across as rather intense.Franka Potente does a great job of his unwitting accomplice who gets more and more afraid, yet intrigued as she finds herself a part of international intrigue.Damon, having played in a variety of less action type roles, really pulls off this one.

Other than the title of the movie and the name of the main character, there is very little resemblance between the outstanding novel and this very standard Hollywood action movie.

There are several highly successful spy movies that have figured out how to keep things fresh for audiences; such as, James Bond, Spy Game, Mission: Impossible.  When it came time for the release of yet another spy movie, this time based on a classic Robert Ludlum novel, people were excited, that is until it was discovered that this adaptation would not have much in common with the source material, then skepticism set in.  However, unlike most cases where a movie tries to be as different from the book as possible this one works and was hugely successful, wowing audiences from day one.""The Bourne Identity"", based on the first book in the ""Jason Bourne Trilogy"" by Robert Ludlum, is about a man who is found in the ocean and has apparently been shot and doesn't remember who or what he is and who or what did this to him.  Now this man must embark on a quest to not only discover who he is, but what he is.  He has martial arts abilities, highly aware of his environment, and is constantly haunted by memories that don't make sense.  Now, the people he worked for at the CIA believe he went rogue, and want to bring him in for questioning or silence him for good.  But upon discovering his name is Jason Bourne, and that he is now wanted by the very people he worked for, though he doesn't remember why, Jason is going to take the fight to the CIA and clear his name once and for all.Superbly crafted thrill ride that never lets up until the credits roll.  Though it is drastically different from the novel it is based upon, ""The Bourne Identity"" still retains the spirit of the novel and sets itself apart in a way that doesn't alienate fans of the novels, but also doesn't require you to have read any of them either.  Excellent cast that is lead by Matt Damon, in a role that no one thought would fit him, but he proves otherwise.  Perfect direction from director Doug Liman (director of Mr. & Mrs. Smith).

She was constantly in the way and almost making you want something to happen to her character.It almost seems like the producers thought if they put a girl who isn't all that cute and has mediocre acting skills then there's no way she could out shine Matt Damon and boy did it work.

The fight sequences are fantastic and this is where you start to give a little respect because all the fights are perfect but I think they could of used a little bit more of them, maybe two or three.The plot kind of reminds you of the Replacement Killers when Chow Yun-Fat wasn't able to assassinate the cop because the guys son was right there with him when he tried to do it but Chow wasn't trained by the government and definitely not as dangerous or exciting.

This latest offering does not disappoint - it's gripping from start to finish. Damon in particular has a knack for drawing the audience in to his frantic, frightening world, and this enables us to empathise with his plight. Clever and fast-paced, it still has enough character development for us to feel some degree of emotion for the leads by the closing credits.In the same way that 'Enemy of the State' made us realise how easy it could be for corrupt government organisations to find almost anyone (and eliminate them if considered enough of a threat), this movie shows us how advanced communication technology is today, and how important it is to have the right checks and balances for groups with this much power.

Fraught with intense action scenes and rich character development, this movie resounds with the passion of a high speed thriller that will bear many viewings.  I must admit to some trepidation about Matt Damon in an action role given his past roles, this trepidation doesn't bear out though, as he performs admirably in the role of a CIA assassin who has lost his memory.The premise:Jason Bourne is a CIA assassin who is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat.  He has two bullets in his back, an odd little laser device with a Zurich address and no memory as to who he is.  After two weeks on the fishing boat, he heads for Zurich and the search to who he really is.  Once he starts on this quest, he finds that he has some absolutely amazing skills and is almost immediately defending himself from being killed in several different ways.  He is then fortunate enough to find Marie, who he pays to drive him to Paris.  The quickly developed relationship between these two characters is quite beautifully filmed.What ensues is clearly one of the best spy/action thrillers to come out in some time.

I suppose it is too much to expect a movie to capture all the intrigue, maneuverings, clandestine subterfuges and treacheries that Ludlum wrote into the books - and it is probably proper that the movie really doesn't try.  It never could capture 10% of the first book in the length of the video - let alone the whole series -- but still this well worth seeing.

The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural ""Bourne"" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre.

539718,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00003CXXM,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 5]","In the commentary on the DVD, Matt Damon admits that this production's intention was to make a gripping film, not one that is faithful to the book.  Director Doug Liman who did ""Swingers"" in 1996 & ""Go"" in 1999 accomplishes that with flying colors.  Tony Gilroy who was the screenwriter for ""Devil's Advocate"" and ""Dolores Claiborne"" works with W. Blake Herron to produce a screenplay that takes Ludlum's novel as a starting point.  The film is fast paced, moves quickly, is gorgeously photographed on location in Prague and Paris, and is a handsome DVD package to add to your collection.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne surprises us with his action ability while showing the perplexity of someone suffering from amnesia, thrown in an ever-changing situation where his past literally threatens his every moment.  Chris Cooper who just won the best supporting actor Oscar for ""Adaptation"" and has played increasingly interesting roles in ""Horse Whisperer,"" ""October Sky,"" & ""American Beauty,"" does an excellent job as the manager of a secret program called Treadstone that networks assassins worldwide.  He becomes increasingly agitated until his assassination clears the way for Jason's ultimate freedom.  Franka Potente who played Johnny Depp's girlfriend in ""Blow"" and is a major German filmstar does a great job as the gypsy-like Maria who is enlisted by Bourne and becomes his willing accomplice.  Clive Owen who was so noticeable in ""Gosford Park"" doesn't have a lot of lines, but has one of the film's most memorable moments in his death scene in the wheatfield.  Julia Stiles isn't asked to do much, but is interesting in her supporting role as Nicolette who runs Treadstone's Paris office.  This is a film like a roller coaster.  The DVD's deleted scenes are interesting with the one with the psychologist being one I felt could have easily added to the film.

539720,A2O91YORQH16L5,B00003CXXM,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[2, 5]","As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.The two Bourne movies, namely The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.In the first move, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Profesosr') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great!Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally.",5,The Power of Observation keeps Bourne ahead of his predators...,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,4092,"['strategy', 'consultant', 'whenever', 'go', 'movies', 'watch', 'movies', 'home', 'often', 'take', 'opportunity', 'seek', 'out', 'possibilities', 'using', 'teach', 'life', 'survival', 'participants', 'seminars', 'workshops.The', 'two', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'namely', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'loosely', 'based', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'work', 'included', 'Rheinmann', 'Exchange', 'Osterman', 'Weekend', 'Holcroft', 'Covenant', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'made', 'great', 'movies.In', 'first', 'move', 'opening', 'scene', 'unconscious', 'young', 'man', 'pulled', 'out', 'Mediterranean', 'coast', 'fishing', 'boat', 'one', 'stormy', 'night', 'Thinking', 'young', 'man', 'dead', 'curious', 'fisherman', 'scalpel', 'two', 'bullets', 'back', 'microchip', 'hip', 'chip', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'wet', 'hero', ""n't"", 'dead', 'amnesia', 'then', 'Zurich', 'bank', 'vault', 'name', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'played', 'Mark', 'Damon', 'addition', 'baffling', 'pile', 'different', 'passports', 'picture', 'large', 'chunk', 'cash', 'US', 'Embassy', 'Marie', 'played', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'fact', 'someone', 'kill', 'Armed', 'bag', 'money', 'superb', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'Marie', 'side', 'Paris', 'clues', 'identity', 'past', 'life', 'middle', 'two', 'assassination', 'plots', 'one', 'assassin', 'was', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', ""'The"", 'Profesosr', 'masterminded', 'rouge', 'elements', 'CIA.In', 'second', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'continuing', 'first', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'recovering', 'Goa', 'India', 'Marie', 'spots', 'mysterious', 'dark-glassed', 'man', 'wrong', 'clothes', 'jogging', 'Marie', 'shot', 'ensuing', 'chase', 'next', 'scene', 'shows', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'deputy', 'director', 'Pamela', 'Landy', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'conducting', 'sting', 'operation', 'fish', 'out', 'mole', 'CIA', 'something', 'wrong', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'highly-classified', 'Treadstone', 'project', 'apparently', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'even', 'evidence', 'Bourne', 'what', 'happened', 'botched', 'operation', 'So', 'Bourne', 'sets', 'out', 'clear', 'name', 'remaining', 'part', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'outsmarting', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'played', 'menacingly', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Kirill', 'tracking', 'down', 'rogue', 'elements', 'CIA', 'shady', 'connections', 'Russian', 'mob', 'who', 'have', 'jointly', 'framed', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'observe', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'around', 'note', 'notice', 'exceptions', 'details', 'environment', 'constantly', 'stay', 'ahead', 'predators', 'same', 'time', 'stay', 'mentally', 'physically', 'anticipate', 'dangers', 'get', 'precarious', 'situations.For', 'example', 'remember', 'scene', 'second', 'movie', 'had', 'jogged', 'beach', 'observed', 'dark-glassed', 'man', 'clothing', 'behaviour', 'somehow', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'environment', 'ability', 'stay', 'calm', 'size', 'up', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'come', 'up', 'super-quick', 'innovative', 'solutions', 'escape', 'capture', 'well', 'demonstrated', 'movies.For', 'example', 'remember', 'scene', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'jumped', 'down', 'several', 'storeys', 'dead', 'body', 'cushion', 'blasting', 'gun', 'assassins', 'running', 'up', 'staircase', 'scene', 'second', 'movie', 'where', 'improvised', 'weapon', 'rolled', 'newspapers', 'explosive', 'escape', 'using', 'magazine', 'stuffed', 'burning', 'toaster', 'quickly', 'engineered', 'gas-filled', 'room', 'Wow', 'was', 'great', 'Naturally', 'am', 'also', 'fascinated', 'many', 'unique', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'one', 'tight', 'environment', 'second', 'movie', 'car', 'chases', 'cat', 'mouse', 'games', 'etc', 'movies.Additionally', 'what', 'like', 'movies', 'total', 'absence', 'super-duper', 'gadgets', 'commonly', 'found', 'such', 'spy-thriller', 'movies', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'used', 'only', 'sheer', 'human', 'ingenuity', 'creativity', 'outsmart', 'enemies.To', 'end', 'review', 'must', 'add', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movies', 'experientially', 'as', 'well', 'educationally']",N/A

He just doesn't know his name or anything else about himself.So far so good.

539729,A3V6LISO8439YS,B00003CXXM,"Logan Rapp ""Student / Writer unpublished""","[1, 2]","I was both excited and skeptical upon learning of the cast and crew for this film. Matt Damon would have been one of my top choices for Jason Bourne, but I never would have considered Doug Liman to direct this - a new up-and-coming director, so you could forgive me on that end.The Bourne Identity is incredibly solid. The visuals give us a very Cold War sense of the world and we see it through Jason's eyes - confusing, dangerous and at a number of times saddening. Damon does incredibly well using subtlety to understate his dual identities clashing with each other - his nature versus his training. However, Damon does not overact this and we are not hit over the head as many spy flicks have done in recent years (can you even call James Bond a spy flick anymore?).The plot is fast-paced, and while you can say there are holes in it, we find ourselves not processing what just happened and trying to see what's going to happen next.

Well, I did it once again and was disappointed. That does not make this a bad movie, just a movie that has very little in common with the book, so I was confused nearly from the beginning of the movie.A man with two bullet holes is discovered floating in the ocean. When the man wakes up he has no memory. Why is he in the ocean? Who shot him? Who is he? He follows clues, including a clue to a bank account implanted under his skin, and learns that he may be Jason Bourne. However, he also learns that he may be someone else. He also learns that he may be an assassin.The remainder of the movie has Matt Damon trying to keep alive and periodically killing people to do so. However, while his nemesis in the original Robert Ludlum novel was Carlos the Jackal, and he did his very best to avoid killing the spies from his side sent to kill him because they thought he might be a traitor, in the movie there is no Carlos and everyone with a gun he encounters is out to kill him. In substitute for Carlos the Jackal is Treadstone, which was a secret project to field highly trained assassins.The action in this movie is reasonably good, with the requisite chases and fights. However, given that Jason Bourne was a highly trained and expensive assassin, I kept thinking that Treadstone would try harder to find and recover him rather than continually sending people with guns after him. But, just like watching a movie after reading the book, some action movies should not be analyzed, just watched.Jason Bourne was written by Ludlum as a tormented man who hated the thought that he might be an assassin, in spite of the mounting evidence that he was a ruthless murderer. Jason Bourne in this movie is a cold-blooded killer. He is not tormented, just efficient. I struggled to see how Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) could take a liking to Jason. Jason did show mercy to a family and its children, but there was so little emotion in his face when he protected them that I wondered how emotionally involved he was in saving them.As an action movie ""The Bourne Identity"" is above average. However, I thought Jason Bourne was too cold-blooded. I thought Bourne's motivations for killing were thin initially. After killing the first agent or two the others were definitely out to get him, but you have to wonder how much of that was his own doing. ""The Bourne Identity"" has lots of action, but very little compassion; lots of adrenaline, but very little heart.

The principal reason seems to be its faithlessness to the decades-old Robert Ludlum novel. Well, I believe Ludlum was an executive producer of the film, and think that he helped migrate the book into a slick script, which provides plenty of screen satisfaction.At last, someone got the idea, that of an amnesiac spy, to the screen, as the first in what was a book trilogy, and will hopefully produce at least one movie sequel. A lukewarm version of ""Identity"" played on television years ago (think of the results if it starred Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith!). This version stylishly updates the story to today.I felt that I saw another dimension to talented actor Matt Damon as the action anti-hero of the film, and thought his onscreen chemistry with Franka Potente worked brilliantly. Couple it with a fine performance from Chris Cooper, a jolting assassination, and one of the finest chase sequences I've seen on film....its a winner!The DVD features are somewhat average, although anything filmed this slickly has a lot of interesting background material.

He has been shot twice and has a laser implanted in his hip with the number of a Swiss bank account. He doesn't remember his name or who he is. Slowly however he discovers that he has skills. And oh boy does he have SKILLS.The gist of the movie is described by others on this page so I will avoid repetition. However the reasons I like this movie are as follows:Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is cool calm and collected. I never would have pegged him for an action star but he carries his role admirably. You feel his confusion, his surprise and his disgust when he finds out who he is. He is also the calmest and most professional spy/protagonist I have seen in a long time.The charaters modus operandii is refreshingly different. He reads a map to escape from a building, and values precision and speed over haste and unnessesary force (read hails of bullets).The female lead (Franke Potente rocks) is a solid individual. Most Hollywood action female leads are as follows; Screaming Ninny, Brave Toughy, or Spunky Girl. Here we have none of that, she is afraid but overcomes it, listens to directions, accepts her mistakes and provides a refreshing counterpoint to Damons paranoid spy, sometimes solving problems more simply and clearly than he can.The action sequences are fast moving and original with no unneccesary gunshots.The car chase is physically possible.Humor is sweet and not overdone.Peripheral characters are fleshed out enough to be interesting but not too much to distract from the main story.In a nutshell.

539744,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,B00003CXXM,"mark twain ""25354""","[23, 104]","Like I say, I guess it serves me right for renting a movie like this in the first place.See, Bourne is found by a bunch of Mediterranean-type fishermen, floating in the sea with a few bullets in him, plus a mini laser embedded in his thigh which, when cut out and turned on by the fishing boat's answer to Bones McCoy, displays a scanning-laser-written bank name, location and account number.  Kind of a lot of trouble to go to for information that could be more compactly stored on a folded piece of plastic, but I guess those guys at the CIA know what they're doing, right?  I mean, to judge from this movie, most of their crack staff appears to be about 17 years old.  You know, there's the kid in the home office who's coming on all seasoned about what blown agents normally do in situations like Bourne's.  I was thinking maybe he should've finished off his curriculum at Varsity High and got his diploma before he was recruited by the CIA, but what do I know.  And then there's his prom date, the girl who's stationed in Paris and acts like she's real competent and hardboiled while she looks like she should be popping pimples on her chin and worrying about taking her driving test.  I mean, do they take us for complete dundering [people]?  Apparently so.  Like in the scene where the CIA section head gives a boiler room pep-talk to the staff about Bourne's whereabouts.  He says, ""He's located... here"" and he puts a red push pin into a small map of France, pushing it into the place where Paris would be.  Hey, thanks, chief.  That's a big help.  Right after this he gives the assembled twelve year olds some rah rah BS and says, ""I wan't you to get everybody up, up, get them all up we got to move, up, up"" and as he says this he bodily hoists a corpulent black man to his feet.  It is clear from the man's expression that he has no idea why he is being brought to his feet or what he is supposed to do.But anyway, back to Bourne.  So Bourne, when he comes to on the fishing boat with the swarthy sailors, he don't remember nothing, see.  Got amnesia from those bullets in his back or something.  Now, time out for a second here.  Raise your hand if you have ever in your life known anyone who has ever had amnesia.  Right, just as I thought.  If it weren't for hack writing, we'd never even know the condition existed.  But to judge from movies if you were to walk into a room and do eeny meeny miny moe every third guy wouldn't know his own name.  Its a real scourge of our time, this amnesia.  Just like multiple personality disorder - what is usually totally erroneously referred to as schizophrenia.  Yeah, it seems that psychiatrists working in nut farms will rarely come across one legit case of MPD in twenty years.  But I guess if they were working in tinseltown, they'd find the disease as common as grass.Well, not to worry, Matt Damon gets a clean bill of health in that regard.  No trace of any heterogenous personality emanations.  He's the same drink of water he always is, and about as colorful and interesting.But, meanwhile, back on the fishing boat, you see these swarthy foreign sailors unaccountably have a soft spot for American-sounding guys with a bunch of lead and laserbeams in them and not the slightest clue.  But as Bourne explains, his habits have stayed with him.  And indeed, before our eyes he begins doing pull-ups from the mainsail or whatever.  I guess for him doing pull-ups is like a reflex action.  Funny.  I do my fair share of pull-ups and I always have to force myself.  Note to Hollywood writer: exertion does not come natural.  But anyway, so this Rocky-esque training sequence on the fishing boat was real inspiring though.  They really should have developed it more, like with Matt Damon clad in a sweat suit running laps around the tiny ship, then working out by punching the [heck] out of the freshly netted fish, till they all fall out of the net, right back into the drink with the fishermen all looking admiringly on.  Thought bubble for random fisherman: ""And to think he doesn't even know who the frig he is.""  Real inspiring.  Goosebumps.  Actually, I wish I could somehow arrange to get hit on the head in just such a way as to make me forget this movie.

539745,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00003CXXM,Martin Asiner,"[3, 9]","Watching THE BOURNE IDENTITY brings to mind numerous previous spy films in which an agent may be a turncoat and has to be brought in from the cold.  In order for this genre to resonate the audience has to empathise with the agent so that they can feel his concern and his peril.  Car chases, explosions, and exotic locales ought to be used to further cement the relation between viewer and hero, rather than divert the former in accepting the derring-do of the latter. What director Doug Liman presents is a non-stop action thriller that tries so hard to thrill that credibility goes out the window early on.Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is a surprisingly youthful amnesia victim plucked from the ocean by Italian sailors.  He has two bullets lodged in him, yet after only two weeks he is able to do heavy physical lifting.  In a nutshell, these rapidly healed bullet wounds suggest the film's major weakness: the audience is asked to take Bourne's physical presence as reason enough to overlook some pretty big holes placed there by logical slugs.  Bourne does not even know that he speaks Italian, Dutch, French, or German until he faces native speakers of those languages.  His mastery of the martial arts is closer to the fighting of THE MATRIX than to any legitimate style.There is a scene in which Bourne and a local woman (Franka Potente) are interrupted in a moment of passion by a hired assassin who battles Bourne in a manner more than suggestive of Robert Redford in a like situation from THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, complete right down to a knife sticking out of the assassin's shoe.  Further, the ongoing but futile attempts of the CIA to track what they deem as a turncoat agent seem a pale comparison to a similar hunt from DAY OF THE JACKAL.  What all these logical gaffes suggest is that to create a spy thriller a director need not do more than have a youthful and handsome hero, an equally attractive female lead, numerous hand to hand clashes, and frequent use of exotic locale.  The directors of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and DAY OF THE JACKAL could offer Doug Liman some useful tips on how to do just that.",3,Matt Seeks his Own Identity,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,2122,"['Watching', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'mind', 'numerous', 'previous', 'spy', 'films', 'agent', 'may', 'be', 'turncoat', 'be', 'brought', 'cold', 'order', 'genre', 'resonate', 'audience', 'empathise', 'agent', 'so', 'can', 'feel', 'concern', 'peril', 'Car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'exotic', 'locales', 'ought', 'be', 'used', 'further', 'cement', 'relation', 'viewer', 'hero', 'rather', 'divert', 'former', 'accepting', 'derring-do', 'latter', 'What', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'non-stop', 'action', 'thriller', 'so', 'hard', 'thrill', 'credibility', 'out', 'window', 'early', 'on.Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'surprisingly', 'youthful', 'amnesia', 'victim', 'plucked', 'ocean', 'Italian', 'sailors', 'two', 'bullets', 'lodged', 'yet', 'only', 'two', 'weeks', 'able', 'do', 'heavy', 'physical', 'lifting', 'nutshell', 'rapidly', 'healed', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'suggest', 'film', 'major', 'weakness', 'audience', 'asked', 'take', 'Bourne', 'physical', 'presence', 'reason', 'enough', 'overlook', 'pretty', 'big', 'holes', 'placed', 'there', 'logical', 'slugs', 'Bourne', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'Italian', 'Dutch', 'French', 'German', 'native', 'speakers', 'languages', 'mastery', 'martial', 'arts', 'closer', 'fighting', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'legitimate', 'style.There', 'scene', 'Bourne', 'local', 'woman', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'are', 'interrupted', 'moment', 'passion', 'hired', 'assassin', 'who', 'Bourne', 'manner', 'more', 'suggestive', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'like', 'situation', 'THREE', 'DAYS', 'THE', 'CONDOR', 'complete', 'right', 'down', 'knife', 'sticking', 'assassin', 'shoe', 'Further', 'ongoing', 'futile', 'attempts', 'CIA', 'track', 'what', 'deem', 'turncoat', 'agent', 'seem', 'pale', 'comparison', 'similar', 'hunt', 'DAY', 'THE', 'JACKAL', 'What', 'logical', 'gaffes', 'suggest', 'create', 'spy', 'thriller', 'director', 'need', 'not', 'do', 'more', 'have', 'youthful', 'handsome', 'hero', 'equally', 'attractive', 'female', 'lead', 'numerous', 'hand', 'hand', 'clashes', 'frequent', 'use', 'exotic', 'locale', 'directors', 'THREE', 'DAYS', 'THE', 'CONDOR', 'DAY', 'THE', 'JACKAL', 'could', 'offer', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'useful', 'tips', 'how', 'do', 'just']",N/A
539746,A16ZO8OSVK30QL,B00003CXXM,Martin Miller,"[1, 2]","THE BOURNE DOUBLE FEATUREThe Bourne Identity is a non-stop, action, suspense, thrill ride.In my opinion it is an excellent movie. (****) The director, Doug Liman , did an excellent job on this movie.The fighting and chase scenes were done so perfect. The fighting style that Matt Damon used reminded me of THE MATRIX, perfectly smooth and fast.My favorite fighting scene was when Bourne goes to his home in Paris and the other Black OP assassin swings and smashes through the glass window attacking him. Awesome hand-to-hand combat. When the assassin finds out he can't win by hand-to-hand he whips out a small arrow head blade, trying to get the upper hand. When Bourne sees this, he evens the odds, with a mere ball point pen and stabs the assassin quite a few times with his fighting technique. The assassin ends up losing and commits suicide.My favorite chase scene was the Paris Pursuit. (In the scene index) He tells Marie (Franka Potenta) that this is her last chance to go on her own, but she decides to stay and buckles up for the ride of her life.So, on this rainy day in Paris Bourne is driving a Mini Cooper, which in fact made this car famous, and out runs the Paris Police by dodging and doing 360s around other vehicle.The only way this scene worked was the fact that the streets were totally wet. They were so perfectly wet that it made this scene one of the best scenes in the movie.Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates action movies like me.The BOURNE SUPREMACY was also a great film. (***.5)In my opinion it was not as good as the first one because it had a different director (Paul Greengrass) and only one great scene.I think the director did a bad job on filming the chase and fighting scenes. It was like watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where the camera was bouncing rapidly. And didn't capture the action very well.It was still a great film because, Bourne actually remembers and learns everything he had lost when he first got amnesia. Also, finishes the story.The best scene was the Death Chase, when he`s running from the Russian Police in a taxi cab he had stolen. Smashing into every vehicle, out running the Police and at the same time the assassin, who killed the love of his life, is chasing him too.When Bourne saw him he leads him down an underground tunnel with a lot of traffic. While smashing each other into the cement walls, Bourne then does a 360, grinding into the assassin's SUV. Bourne takes out his hand gun and blows out the front driver-side tire, causing the SUV to pull right in front of Bourne sideways. Bourne then puts the petal-to-the-metal and rams the SUV into a cement pillar.Now both vehicles are completely totaled. Bourne gets out of the cab limping towards the SUV, pointing his gun at the assassin and sees his pursuer lying on the steering wheel covered in his own blood. It looks to me like he was still alive and breathing. All Bourne does is just walk away.If I was Bourne I would have put a bullet in his head and called it a day. But it could have been a perfect story for another movie, making these films into THE BOURNE TRILOGY.Overall, I recommend seeing both of these films back-to-back to understand the entire story.",5,the bourne double feature,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,3208,"['BOURNE', 'DOUBLE', 'FEATUREThe', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'non-stop', 'action', 'suspense', 'thrill', 'ride.In', 'opinion', 'excellent', 'movie', '****', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'movie.The', 'fighting', 'chase', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'perfect', 'fighting', 'style', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'used', 'reminded', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'perfectly', 'smooth', 'fast.My', 'favorite', 'fighting', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Bourne', 'home', 'Paris', 'other', 'Black', 'OP', 'assassin', 'swings', 'smashes', 'glass', 'window', 'attacking', 'Awesome', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'When', 'assassin', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'hand-to-hand', 'out', 'small', 'arrow', 'head', 'blade', 'trying', 'get', 'upper', 'hand', 'When', 'Bourne', 'odds', 'mere', 'ball', 'point', 'pen', 'stabs', 'assassin', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'fighting', 'technique', 'assassin', 'up', 'losing', 'commits', 'suicide.My', 'favorite', 'chase', 'scene', 'was', 'Paris', 'Pursuit', 'scene', 'index', 'Marie', 'Franka', 'Potenta', 'last', 'chance', 'go', 'own', 'stay', 'buckles', 'up', 'ride', 'life.So', 'rainy', 'day', 'Paris', 'Bourne', 'driving', 'Mini', 'Cooper', 'fact', 'made', 'car', 'famous', 'Paris', 'Police', 'dodging', 'doing', '360s', 'other', 'vehicle.The', 'only', 'way', 'scene', 'worked', 'was', 'fact', 'streets', 'were', 'totally', 'wet', 'were', 'so', 'perfectly', 'wet', 'made', 'scene', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie.Overall', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'action', 'movies', 'me.The', 'BOURNE', 'SUPREMACY', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'film', '***.5', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'different', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'scene.I', 'think', 'director', 'did', 'bad', 'job', 'filming', 'chase', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'was', 'watching', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'where', 'camera', 'was', 'bouncing', 'rapidly', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'action', 'very', 'well.It', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'Bourne', 'actually', 'remembers', 'learns', 'everything', 'had', 'lost', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'amnesia', 'Also', 'story.The', 'best', 'scene', 'was', 'Death', 'Chase', 'when', 's', 'running', 'Russian', 'Police', 'taxi', 'cab', 'had', 'stolen', 'Smashing', 'vehicle', 'running', 'Police', 'same', 'time', 'assassin', 'who', 'killed', 'love', 'life', 'chasing', 'too.When', 'Bourne', 'saw', 'down', 'underground', 'tunnel', 'lot', 'traffic', 'smashing', 'other', 'cement', 'walls', 'Bourne', 'then', '360', 'grinding', 'assassin', 'SUV', 'Bourne', 'out', 'hand', 'gun', 'out', 'front', 'driver-side', 'tire', 'causing', 'SUV', 'pull', 'right', 'front', 'Bourne', 'sideways', 'Bourne', 'then', 'petal-to-the-metal', 'SUV', 'cement', 'pillar.Now', 'vehicles', 'are', 'completely', 'totaled', 'Bourne', 'cab', 'limping', 'SUV', 'pointing', 'gun', 'assassin', 'pursuer', 'lying', 'steering', 'wheel', 'covered', 'own', 'blood', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'breathing', 'Bourne', 'just', 'walk', 'away.If', 'was', 'Bourne', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'bullet', 'head', 'called', 'day', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'story', 'movie', 'making', 'films', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'TRILOGY.Overall', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'films', 'back-to-back', 'understand', 'entire', 'story']",N/A

Sometimes all you need is a good, solid lead, some nice action, and a well-kept pace in order to be entertained. Thankfully, the movie provides all of those attributes.""The Bourne Identity"" is about Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), who is found floating in offshore waters by some fisherman, taken aboard their boat, and then recovers from two weeks at sea and two gunshot wounds. The recovery is quick, and Bourne is soon back on land, attempting to find out who he is, all the while people are trying to kill him. And he manages to hitch himself with a European drifter girl named Marie (played by Franka Potente, of ""Run Lola Run"" fame).Unfortunately for us, and the reason why I say that the movie has no real ""plot"", is that any possibility of mystery and intrigue is zapped out of the story by a few factors. 1: From the title alone, and then a passport seen relatively early on, *we* know Bourne's identity well before he does. 2: We also are clued-in to who is trying to kill him, long before he starts to get an idea, as the action cuts back and forth to his adversaries quite often. And 3: as we know who he is, what his job used to be, who his adversaries are, and what *they* are doing to try to catch him, the potential plot of ""mystery"" is completely removed. All we are left with is the possibility of suspense during some of the action scenes.Ah, but do those fulfill the purpose admirably. Even though we either already know what's going, or can pretty easily guess, once the story leads us into one of its many action scenes, all bets are off. The suspense comes into focus. The tension arises. And the fighting (Matt Damon must have taken some professional lessons) is great to watch, if a tad bloody. There is one scene in particular in which Bourne outwits an assassin, and it simply teems with nervous excitement as to how he'll resolve the conflict.""The Bourne Identity"" may suffer from an overexposure of its more mysterious elements, but it stands up well under the wonderful talents of Matt Damon and Franka Potente. They have good chemistry, and the director is smart to keep a primary focus on them. The story moves along at a strong pace, and feels sure of itself.

539749,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXXM,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","""The Bourne Identity"" is a well-crafted, reasonably intelligent spy thriller that is akin to the classics made in the 1960s and 1970s. It has high energy moments, like an elaborate auto chase through the streets of Paris, but it eschews the flashy, over-produced special effects of movies like `XXX' in favor of greater focus on the characters and the story. While the plot has a number of hard to believe elements to it, it's still intriguing enough to keep an audience well entertained.The crew of a fishing vessel discovers an unconscious man [Matt Damon] floating in the water off the coast of France. He has two bullets in his back and an odd little gadget sewn into his hip. The man recovers physically but is plagued by amnesia. Using the gadget, the captain learns that their passenger has a numbered bank account in Switzerland. Later, after making his way to Zurich, the confused victim finds out he is John Borne, American resident of Paris. It's more complicated than that, though, because he also uncovers several other passports. Is he Borne, is he someone else, or is he all of these identities? At the American Consulate, he learns one more thing: He is a wanted man whom some group wants to assassinate. Enlisting the aid of a German girl, Marie [Franka Potente], he makes his way to Paris. There, both he and Marie are in even greater danger. He establishes that he was a CIA agent, and, as his memory slowly returns, he comes to understand that he was anything but a nice guy.Damon does a great job of playing an action hero. It's an interesting role for him, almost but not quite as multi-layered as his part in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley'. He and Potente make an excellent on screen couple, both in the action scenes and the romantic ones.The movie was directed by Doug Liman, who also did the cult classic ""Swingers"" and the wonderful [and little seen] ""Go"". He brings a modern feel to an old genre. Adding to the film's appeal is the excellent photography, which was done on location in Paris, Prague, Switzerland and Greece.",4,"Well made, interesting spy thriller",1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,2046,"['Bourne', 'Identity', 'well-crafted', 'reasonably', 'intelligent', 'spy', 'thriller', 'akin', 'classics', 'made', '1960s', '1970s', 'high', 'energy', 'moments', 'elaborate', 'auto', 'chase', 'streets', 'Paris', 'flashy', 'over-produced', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', 'XXX', 'favor', 'greater', 'focus', 'characters', 'story', 'plot', 'number', 'hard', 'believe', 'elements', 'still', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'keep', 'audience', 'well', 'entertained.The', 'crew', 'fishing', 'vessel', 'unconscious', 'man', '[', 'Matt', 'Damon', ']', 'floating', 'water', 'coast', 'France', 'two', 'bullets', 'back', 'odd', 'little', 'gadget', 'sewn', 'hip', 'man', 'physically', 'plagued', 'amnesia', 'Using', 'gadget', 'captain', 'passenger', 'numbered', 'bank', 'account', 'Switzerland', 'Later', 'making', 'way', 'Zurich', 'confused', 'victim', 'out', 'John', 'Borne', 'American', 'resident', 'Paris', 'more', 'complicated', 'though', 'also', 'several', 'other', 'passports', 'Borne', 'someone', 'else', 'identities', 'American', 'Consulate', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'wanted', 'man', 'whom', 'group', 'assassinate', 'Enlisting', 'aid', 'German', 'girl', 'Marie', '[', 'Franka', 'Potente', ']', 'way', 'Paris', 'Marie', 'are', 'even', 'greater', 'danger', 'was', 'CIA', 'agent', 'memory', 'slowly', 'returns', 'understand', 'was', 'anything', 'nice', 'guy.Damon', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'action', 'hero', 'interesting', 'role', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'multi-layered', 'part', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'Potente', 'make', 'excellent', 'screen', 'couple', 'action', 'scenes', 'romantic', 'ones.The', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'cult', 'classic', 'Swingers', 'wonderful', '[', 'little', 'seen', ']', 'Go', 'modern', 'feel', 'old', 'genre', 'Adding', 'film', 'appeal', 'excellent', 'photography', 'was', 'done', 'location', 'Paris', 'Prague', 'Switzerland', 'Greece']",N/A

539753,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B00003CXXM,M. Dog,"[1, 2]","This film seemed to vanish quickly, so easily confused with about a dozen lesser films about spies and rampant covert operations. That's a shame, because this one is a cut above the rest that may have to wait a few years to get its due.If you like spy films, or just well made action films that don't fizz at the end, you really should add this one to your collection. It's from the Robert Ludlum book, all about a highly and expensively trained covert agent suffering from amnesia. What this film has going for it is the following:Director, Doug Liman, demonstrates an expert hand at action sequences. When master killing machine, Jason Bourne, senses something isn't right, Liman's expert film making begins to ratchet up the tension almost subconsciously. By the time the action comes, the viewer has been expertly brought to the edge of his seat. These action sequences build to a perfect climax of violence that is always satisfying. The fight scenes are among the finest I have seen in any recent film. There is nothing in this director's resume to suggest this, but trust me; he knows what he's doing. All the action has real weight and danger, which is an almost specialized talent for directors. Think Walter Hill. Thing Sam Peckinpah.This movie also has brilliant, believable performances all around.First and foremost among them, Matt Damon simply does everything right in this role. In an action film, often the lead isn't called upon to do a lot of top drawer acting, which is fine. Being believable in an action scene is talent enough, in my book. But in this role, Matt Damon is required to do some old-school, plain old acting, and he more than meets the challenge. See, the hook of this film is the main character, Jason Bourne, is waking up from an amnesia fog and slowly discovers his immense, instinctive prowess as a killer/agent. So the actor must make a shift now and then from moments of confusion and innocence to complete mastery of any physical situation. In addition, the character is slowly coming to the conclusion that the memories he has of his passed life, he no longer wants. In short, he does not want the life he is remembering. Damon is very touching in these scenes, and his acting is very, very solid. His performance here, and in The Talented Mr. Ripley, is so good it makes you wonder why he hangs around Ben Afleck.Franka Potente, the actress who plays his romantic interest, is such an incredible actress. She is simply a pleasure to watch, and she always brings such authenticity to her roles. She is no model turned actress, this one. She demonstrated her action/acting chops in Run, Lola, Run, a few years ago, and it was a brilliant move casting her here. She is simply beautiful in a very unique way, and she can act the socks of the current crop of female leads. Potente always looks in place in al her roles, and it's a damn shame she doesn't get more work.Finally, the smaller parts shine as well. My favorite being the assassin sent to kill Bourne, played with black-eyed menace by Clive Owen. It's a very small part, but crucial, and Owen makes the most of it. Also, the always reliable Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are on board as the sinister, competent bosses of the covert operations.This is really a great addition to any action DVD collection. -Mykal Banta",5,A thirty million dollar killing machine with a bad memory,1084579200,"05 15, 2004",2004,3313,"['film', 'seemed', 'vanish', 'quickly', 'easily', 'confused', 'dozen', 'lesser', 'films', 'spies', 'rampant', 'covert', 'operations', 'shame', 'one', 'cut', 'rest', 'may', 'have', 'wait', 'few', 'years', 'get', 'due.If', 'spy', 'films', 'just', 'well', 'made', 'action', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'fizz', 'end', 'really', 'should', 'add', 'one', 'collection', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'book', 'highly', 'expensively', 'trained', 'covert', 'agent', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'What', 'film', 'going', 'following', 'Director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'expert', 'hand', 'action', 'sequences', 'When', 'master', 'killing', 'machine', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'something', ""n't"", 'right', 'Liman', 'expert', 'film', 'making', 'begins', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'almost', 'subconsciously', 'time', 'action', 'viewer', 'been', 'expertly', 'brought', 'edge', 'seat', 'action', 'sequences', 'build', 'perfect', 'climax', 'violence', 'always', 'satisfying', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'finest', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'film', 'nothing', 'director', 'resume', 'suggest', 'what', 'doing', 'action', 'real', 'weight', 'danger', 'almost', 'specialized', 'talent', 'directors', 'Think', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'Thing', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah.This', 'movie', 'also', 'brilliant', 'believable', 'performances', 'around.First', 'foremost', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'simply', 'everything', 'right', 'role', 'action', 'film', 'often', 'lead', ""n't"", 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'lot', 'top', 'drawer', 'acting', 'fine', 'Being', 'believable', 'action', 'scene', 'talent', 'enough', 'book', 'role', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'required', 'do', 'old-school', 'plain', 'old', 'acting', 'more', 'challenge', 'See', 'hook', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'waking', 'up', 'amnesia', 'fog', 'slowly', 'discovers', 'immense', 'instinctive', 'prowess', 'killer/agent', 'actor', 'must', 'make', 'shift', 'now', 'then', 'moments', 'confusion', 'innocence', 'complete', 'mastery', 'physical', 'situation', 'addition', 'character', 'slowly', 'coming', 'conclusion', 'memories', 'passed', 'life', 'no', 'longer', 'short', 'not', 'want', 'life', 'remembering', 'Damon', 'very', 'touching', 'scenes', 'acting', 'very', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'here', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'so', 'good', 'wonder', 'why', 'Ben', 'Afleck.Franka', 'Potente', 'actress', 'who', 'romantic', 'interest', 'such', 'incredible', 'actress', 'simply', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'always', 'such', 'authenticity', 'roles', 'model', 'turned', 'actress', 'one', 'demonstrated', 'action/acting', 'chops', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'brilliant', 'move', 'casting', 'here', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'very', 'unique', 'way', 'can', 'act', 'socks', 'current', 'crop', 'female', 'leads', 'Potente', 'always', 'place', 'al', 'roles', 'damn', 'shame', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'work.Finally', 'smaller', 'parts', 'shine', 'as', 'well', 'favorite', 'being', 'assassin', 'sent', 'kill', 'Bourne', 'played', 'black-eyed', 'menace', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'crucial', 'Owen', 'most', 'Also', 'always', 'reliable', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'are', 'board', 'sinister', 'competent', 'bosses', 'covert', 'operations.This', 'really', 'great', 'addition', 'action', 'DVD', 'collection', '-Mykal', 'Banta']",N/A

539755,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00003CXXM,Mel Odom,"[1, 2]","When he's first fished out of the ocean, the man who becomes known as Jason Bourne doesn't know who he is.  The fishing ship's surgeon removes two bullets from his back and a computer-coded device with a Swiss banking account number from his hip.  As he recovers, Bourne finds out that he has incredible abilities but no idea how he got them.  In Zurich, he finds a safe-deposit box with several passports all bearing his picture but in different names.  There's also a small fortune in cash from bills issued in a dozen different countries and a pistol.  Within minutes of his arrival in the bank, an espionage team is hot on his heels.  Bourne is a man on the run, trying to escape an unknown enemy that wants him dead.  All he wants is to know who he is, but when that knowledge points in the direction of him being an assassin, all he wants is out.  Unfortunately, the hounds are upon him.  To live or die, he has to kill or be killed.Matt Damon (GOOD WILL HUNTING, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY) plays Jason Bourne with surprising ease.  He offers a laid-back performance that is deceptively intense and exactly what is needed by the fast-paced plot.  Franka Potente (BLOW) stars as Marie Kreutz who ends up falling in love with Bourne.  Brian Cox (MURDER BY NUMBERS, THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, THE GLIMMER MAN) turns in a quiet but creepy performance as a CIA director putting the pressure on Bourne's handler to find Bourne and put him down.Although not as tech-oriented as a James Bond film, THE BOURNE IDENTITY moves through the action paces at a brisk trot and finishes, as it should, with an all-out sprint.  Still, the move and counter-move between hunted and hunters is great and will keep the audience on the edge of his or her seat.  The European settings are beautiful, and the camerawork and use of color absolutely make those scenes stand out even more.  Franka Potente should do more American filmwork because she came across as sexy, intelligent, and vulnerable.  Although there are many layers to this plot, the writing and presentation were excellent, allowing the audience to catch up to speed at a moment's notice even when the newest plot twist changed the whole movie around at times.Since this is the first movie of a projected trilogy featuring the title character, there were some plot holes left open.  Viewers will want to know why CIA handler Ted Conklin referred to Jason Bourne as a $30 million weapon, and find out exactly what behaviorial software Bourne has been exposed to.  However, based on the premiere movie, most viewers will be content to return to the second installment of the trilogy and wait.  One thing that appeared to be missing from the typical spy fare was the gadgetry and computer applications.  But Robert Ludlum wrote THE BOURNE IDENTITY over twenty years ago, and computers weren't prominent at the time.Audiences that love James Bond films or movies that offer a hint of mystery with a full serving of action, intrigue, and danger will enjoy THE BOURNE IDENTITY.",4,Man on the Run,1024876800,"06 24, 2002",2002,3029,"['When', 'first', 'fished', 'ocean', 'man', 'who', 'known', 'Jason', 'Bourne', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'fishing', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'removes', 'two', 'bullets', 'back', 'computer-coded', 'device', 'Swiss', 'banking', 'account', 'number', 'hip', 'Bourne', 'out', 'incredible', 'abilities', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'Zurich', 'safe-deposit', 'box', 'several', 'passports', 'bearing', 'picture', 'different', 'names', 'also', 'small', 'fortune', 'cash', 'bills', 'issued', 'dozen', 'different', 'countries', 'pistol', 'minutes', 'arrival', 'bank', 'espionage', 'team', 'hot', 'heels', 'Bourne', 'man', 'run', 'trying', 'escape', 'unknown', 'enemy', 'dead', 'know', 'who', 'when', 'knowledge', 'points', 'direction', 'being', 'assassin', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'hounds', 'are', 'live', 'die', 'kill', 'be', 'killed.Matt', 'Damon', 'GOOD', 'WILL', 'HUNTING', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'THE', 'TALENTED', 'MR.', 'RIPLEY', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'surprising', 'ease', 'laid-back', 'performance', 'deceptively', 'intense', 'exactly', 'what', 'needed', 'fast-paced', 'plot', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'BLOW', 'Marie', 'Kreutz', 'who', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Bourne', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'MURDER', 'BY', 'NUMBERS', 'THE', 'LONG', 'KISS', 'GOODNIGHT', 'THE', 'GLIMMER', 'MAN', 'quiet', 'creepy', 'performance', 'CIA', 'director', 'putting', 'pressure', 'Bourne', 'handler', 'find', 'Bourne', 'put', 'down.Although', 'not', 'as', 'tech-oriented', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'action', 'paces', 'brisk', 'trot', 'finishes', 'should', 'all-out', 'sprint', 'Still', 'move', 'counter-move', 'hunted', 'hunters', 'great', 'will', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'seat', 'European', 'settings', 'are', 'beautiful', 'camerawork', 'use', 'color', 'absolutely', 'make', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'should', 'do', 'more', 'American', 'filmwork', 'came', 'sexy', 'intelligent', 'vulnerable', 'are', 'many', 'layers', 'plot', 'writing', 'presentation', 'were', 'excellent', 'allowing', 'audience', 'catch', 'up', 'speed', 'moment', 'notice', 'even', 'when', 'newest', 'plot', 'twist', 'changed', 'whole', 'movie', 'around', 'times.Since', 'first', 'movie', 'projected', 'trilogy', 'featuring', 'title', 'character', 'were', 'plot', 'holes', 'left', 'open', 'Viewers', 'will', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'CIA', 'handler', 'Ted', 'Conklin', 'referred', 'Jason', 'Bourne', '30', 'million', 'weapon', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'behaviorial', 'software', 'Bourne', 'been', 'exposed', 'However', 'based', 'premiere', 'movie', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'content', 'return', 'second', 'installment', 'trilogy', 'wait', 'One', 'thing', 'appeared', 'be', 'missing', 'typical', 'spy', 'fare', 'was', 'gadgetry', 'computer', 'applications', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'wrote', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'computers', 'were', ""n't"", 'prominent', 'time.Audiences', 'love', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'movies', 'offer', 'hint', 'mystery', 'full', 'serving', 'action', 'intrigue', 'danger', 'will', 'enjoy', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY']",N/A

A body is pulled from the ocean with a couple of bullet holes in the back.  Amazingly, the man is still alive.  He is treated by the ship's physician and slowly brought back to health.  The only problem is that he lost his memory.  The physician finds a metal nugget in the man that projects a bank safety deposit box number.With no clue as to who he is, the man goes to the bank and is able to get to the box with his thumbprint as his identification.  Inside the box he finds a slew of passports, currency and weapons.  Each of the passports is under different names.  He uses the one that says Jason Bourne and when he uses it for travel, the immigration computer sets off a whole bunch of alarms to some CIA operatives that very much want him dead.At a US embassy, Jason eludes his assassins (through some highly refined combat techniques and climbing skills) and asks for a ride from a lady he saw at the embassy.  She takes him, unknowingly putting herself in danger.  The two of them need to unravel Jason's mystery as to who he is, why he has the skills that he has, and why are the government agents trying to kill him.Jason and the woman (Marie) head to Paris to an address that Jason lived at.  There Jason is attacked by a hitman who has photos of both Jason and Marie that were taken back at the embassy.  Suddenly Marie realizes that she is stuck with Jason fighting unknown enemies, just to stay alive.The movie is quite different than the book of the same name but is excellent nonetheless.  Matt Damon appears well cast and all the CIA operatives are excellent as well (Julia Styles plays one of them).  The actress that plays Marie does a passable job and there seems to be a good chemistry that evolves between her and Damon.A non-stop roller coaster ride with some great car chases thrown in.

As in all covert agent movies, Bourne is being hunted by his superiors to eliminate him since he failed in his mission.  Damon has the right amount of boyish exuberance and masculine machismo to infuse life and credibility into his unbelievable predicament.  Franka Potente is a good foil and companion for Damon in her role as his reluctant sidekick; her transformation from coquettish flirt to persistent helper is well done.  Clive Owen in a small role as an assassin has a very good scene in which he extols the life of the undercover agent just before he bites the dust. Academy award winner Chris Cooper joins such notables as Al Pacino (Recruit), James Caan (Eraser) as the superior who will go to any lengths to tidy up a mess.

539765,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00003CXXM,Michael Crane,"[3, 3]","I was in the mood to watch an entertaining action flick that hopefully had some brains behind it, so I decided to pop &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; into my DVD player (that, and the previews for the sequel looks really good, so I wanted to see this right away).  What I got was exactly what I expected, and then some.  This is a very exciting and sharp movie that is a lot of fun to watch.  There's lots of intense action to be enjoyed from this film.Jason Bourne has a serious problem on his hands.  When he is left for dead and his body is discovered by fishermen, he awakes and realizes that he cannot remember who he is.  His memory is gone and he has no idea why or how he's there.  And even though he doesn't know who he is, he is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat and is a deadly weapon who can take down just about anyone.  When he tries to uncover his past and his identity, he finds people around every corner trying to kill him.  Turns out that he is in reality an agent/assassin for the U.S. government (a very secret branch of defense).  Since Bourne had failed his mission, they cannot afford to have him found out by others, so they know he must be terminated.  Well, Bourne isn't going to take that lightly.  He will take them head on and bring the fight to their doorsteps in order to find out who he is and why they want him dead.This really was a good time.  I haven't been terribly impressed with some of the latest action blunders, so it was nice to see something that was entertaining and was actually smart at the same time.  Another plus is that the film doesn't try to be overly goofy, as a lot of other action flicks tend to be at times.  Granted, there is humor, but it's evenly spread out and is never overused.  Not only does the film have incredible action and fight scenes, but it also has a smart script and great character interaction.  The movie also shows that Matt Damon can be one heck of an action star.  I thought he could never pull it off, but he sure proved me wrong.  He's very believable in his role and he's able to pull of the action scenes with real authenticity.The DVD has a few extras to offer.  First off, the movie looks very good and the sound is also terrific.  Extras that can be found on this DVD include commentary from the director, an alternate ending and an extended &quot;farmhouse&quot; scene, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a great music video by Moby, and some really neat DVD-ROM extras.  I didn't care much for the alternate ending, so I'm glad that they just stuck with what is in the movie.  All in all, not a bad package.&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; can be enjoyed by those who want a smart and clever action movie that delivers.  There's a great script, a fantastic cast, and some out-of-this-world chase/fight scenes.  This was definitely a great time for me and I'm glad I finally got around to watching it.  If you haven't checked it out yet, then I really recommend it, especially if you're an action fan. -Michael Crane",4,"&quot;Everything I found out, I want to forget...&quot;",1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,3010,"['was', 'mood', 'watch', 'entertaining', 'action', 'flick', 'hopefully', 'had', 'brains', 'decided', 'pop', 'quot', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'quot', 'DVD', 'player', 'previews', 'sequel', 'really', 'good', 'wanted', 'see', 'right', 'away', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'then', 'very', 'exciting', 'sharp', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'lots', 'intense', 'action', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'film.Jason', 'Bourne', 'serious', 'problem', 'hands', 'When', 'left', 'dead', 'body', 'discovered', 'fishermen', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'memory', 'gone', 'idea', 'why', 'how', 'there', 'even', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'very', 'skilled', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'down', 'just', 'anyone', 'When', 'uncover', 'past', 'identity', 'people', 'corner', 'trying', 'kill', 'out', 'reality', 'agent/assassin', 'U.S.', 'government', 'very', 'secret', 'branch', 'defense', 'Bourne', 'had', 'failed', 'mission', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'others', 'know', 'must', 'be', 'terminated', 'Well', 'Bourne', ""n't"", 'going', 'take', 'lightly', 'will', 'take', 'head', 'bring', 'fight', 'doorsteps', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'why', 'want', 'dead.This', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'terribly', 'impressed', 'latest', 'action', 'blunders', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'something', 'was', 'entertaining', 'was', 'actually', 'smart', 'same', 'time', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'overly', 'goofy', 'lot', 'other', 'action', 'flicks', 'tend', 'be', 'times', 'Granted', 'humor', 'evenly', 'spread', 'out', 'never', 'overused', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'have', 'incredible', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'also', 'smart', 'script', 'great', 'character', 'interaction', 'movie', 'also', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'heck', 'action', 'star', 'thought', 'could', 'never', 'pull', 'off', 'sure', 'proved', 'wrong', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'able', 'pull', 'action', 'scenes', 'real', 'authenticity.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'offer', 'First', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'also', 'terrific', 'Extras', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'DVD', 'include', 'commentary', 'director', 'alternate', 'ending', 'extended', 'quot', 'farmhouse', 'quot', 'scene', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'great', 'music', 'video', 'Moby', 'really', 'neat', 'DVD-ROM', 'extras', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'alternate', 'ending', ""'m"", 'glad', 'just', 'stuck', 'what', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'package.', 'quot', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'want', 'smart', 'clever', 'action', 'movie', 'delivers', 'great', 'script', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'out-of-this-world', 'chase/fight', 'scenes', 'was', 'definitely', 'great', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'out', 'yet', 'then', 'really', 'recommend', 'especially', ""'re"", 'action', 'fan', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

539769,A3CTMZUJ423ETM,B00003CXXM,"Michael Simpson ""ttlms""","[5, 5]","I don't have time to review this exhaustively, but want to be as thorough as I can.  I'm also working under the assumption that you are interested in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" as well as this, the first movie in one of the best trilogies ever made.  Opinions as to which movie is the best are well within the limits of personal taste; for me, this movie is the second best behind ""The Bourne Ultimatum""; however, like the Beethoven symphonies, one of a great set has to be the least.TBI starts in the middle of the sea; the Mediterranean, we find out soon enough.  An Italian fishing boat finds a body left for dead in the middle of the night.  The ship's surgeon is skilled and equipped sufficiently to remove some bullets and, in the process, fish out a diode that blinks what appears to be a Swiss bank number.  The man, an American (Matt Damon, of course) regains consciousness, realizing that for the time being, he is among friends.  He is able to remember how to speak, dress, play chess, read, and other daily skills, but has no idea how he ended up in the Mediterranean, much less shot, wearing a wetsuit, or anything else; he cannot even remember his name.  Eventually, the fishermen leave him ashore with a small stipend to get to the Swiss bank, where the man finally learns what his name must have been -- Jason Bourne -- but not much help with who he is, except that he has a ton of cash, a portfolio of fake passports, and a gun.  Except for the gun, he takes the treasure on his journey to find out more about Jason Bourne, no longer able to find buddies like the fishermen -- the Swiss police and the American Embassy security are both interested in detaining him, if not worse.  His last friend is Maria, who gives him a ride to Paris for $10,000 so he can  put together clues from his last known address.  Meanwhile, some American federal agency (CIA? FBI? NSA? the issue doesn't press front and center) is trying to fix something that went wrong with Bourne.  By ""fix"", we get the idea that keeping Bourne alive is not a high priority with the feds.TBI was the only Bourne movie directed by Doug Liman, rather than Paul Greengrass.  So we don't have the latter's hand-held camera sequences, and that's good and bad.  The hand to hand combat scenes are a little less intense, but easier to watch.  The car chase in Paris is top-notch.My favorite part about TBI, and the other Bourne movies (or this new species of action movies, in general), is the dichotomy between the policy wonks, surrounded by their computer geeks in monitor-loaded command centers capable of generating impossible intelligence (apparently every intersection in Europe is now covered by a remote camera, no matter how remote) and the rubber-hits-the-road robot assassins, each receiving his assignments by way of a video cell-phone that was probably a bit hipper in 2002 than I'm remembering.  For me, TBI belongs to Conklin (Chris Cooper), Bourne's trainer and supervisor, and apparently the one with the most to lose now that Jason is making noise all over Europe.  He reports to another fine spook, Abbott (Brian Cox), but Conklin just gets me with his short-sleeve dress shirts and ties that make him look like an aluminum-siding salesman.  I got the idea Conklin never did grasp the depth of the hole he'd fallen into, especially when he told Abbott ""We will burn for this,"" and Abbott has an expression on his face like Tonto thinking ""Whaddya you mean we, Kimosabe?""Besides Abbott and Costello (I mean Conklin), there are some other good supporting performances, with not a lot of lines, from the other assassins.  Of course, we know none of them can be as good as Jason, but cleaning up Jason involves some messy work.

His handlers think he is a rogue agent and call in all ""assets"" to take him out. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a classy, realistic film. By realistic, I mean not only the various sets in Paris and Switzerland and on a trawler in the Mediterranean, but the fact that Damon, when he is zapping some bad guy, usually finds himself in a hell of a fight. The bad guys are GOOD! That goes to make this a more believeable thriller than, say, MI III, where the bad guys are push overs and our hero is amazing. Damon does a great acting job as a believeably tough guy who can think fast on his feet. There is a sweet, understated love interest with Franka Potente, a fresh screen face, not too beautiful, which also lends to realism, who plays a stranger whom Damon befriends. Adapted from Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name, the screenplay is tight and keeps the viewer wondering, along with Damon, who he is and how he will survive. In essense, this is a chase-and-run flick, with the CIA (again) as the bad guys. They give a good account of themselves, however, but Damon was apparently trained to be the best.

539773,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00003CXXM,Mike Stone,"[0, 2]","It can be quite disappointing when an actor with screenwriter's talent gets himself tangled up in a genre picture.  Even more disappointing is when said genre picture proclaims itself to be a suspense thriller but turns out to be little more than a punch-and-kick actioner.  With ""The Bourne Identity"", little Matty Damon grows up, and it turns out that he has a little Steven Seagal in him.That's not to say that ""The Bourne Identity"" is nothing more than schlocky summer fare.  It can be, at times, quite engaging and provoking.  It's premise -- CIA-trained super-assassin on the run from his former bosses, hampered by severe amnesia -- has a lot of potential for questioning the archetypal hero's persona, and tackling issues of identity.  It further proves the notion, also espoused by ""Fargo"" and ""Insomnia"", that the limited palette of beautiful snowy locales (Switzerland and France here) can be an intense and impressive backdrop for a thriller.  And it has a stab at the one storytelling device that I'm a sucker for every time: the unreliable narrator.Damon, plays Jason Bourne, a character that is cold and calculating, but ever ready to spin himself out of his shell and knock the baddies around.  Some of the movie's best psychological moments actually come in these action scenes.  Bourne doesn't know a thing about his previous life, and seeing him realize that he's a lethal fighting machine, right at the moment when he needs it most, is quite thrilling.  Damon does a fine job in these scenes, pulling off both the tormented hero and athletic wunderkind portions of his character.  However, I would have liked to see him inject some more humour into the role.  The opportunities were surely there.  He plays paranoid and coiled the whole time, and after awhile it got grating.One of the film's fatal flaws is that casts, and then wastes, a heap of wonderful actors.  Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles, all actors who've proven time and again that they can deliver interesting and complex performances, are asked to play mere plot devices here.  Cooper is the go-for-broke assassin team leader.  Cox is the worrisome bureaucrat.  Stiles is the prodigious tech-op.  None plays anything resembling a full-fledged character, although all are game in their attempts to flesh one out.  Most disturbing is the work turned in by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.  He was always terrifying on HBO's ""Oz"" (as gang leader Adebisi).  But here he is terribly over the top and ludicrous as a recently deposed African dictator.  So much so that the friend with whom I saw the film leaned over to me, after Adewale's first appearance, and asked if we'd accidentally paid to see ""Coming to America 2"".The one supporting actor who fulfills his/her role nicely is the thinking man's uber-babe, Franka Potente.  The star of ""Run Lola Run"" plays Marie, who in the hands of a lesser actress would have been little more than a cipher of a love interest.  But Potente injects her with tenderness and vulnerability, while also being sexier than I've ever seen her.  She and Damon have a few truncated love scenes, and what they share together is always sensual, without ever being blatant.Director Doug Liman, whose work I admired in ""Swingers"" and found problematic in ""Go"", two movies more concerened with clever dialogue than swift fists, would seem an unlikely fit for a spy thriller.  But he does his best to lay back and let the story take shape.  The opening scene is played almost perfectly, giving the audience as little information as possible, but still allowing them to figure out that the floating body found by fisherman just off Marseilles has an even more terrible story to tell than first expected.  His camera work, for the most part, manages to capture the stunning and stark beauty of his locales.  Unfortunately Liman also, at times, feels the need to play with his new big-budget toys.  So we get a lot of flashy digital information flittering its way across the computer screen.  There's nothing more effective at taking the audience out of a visceral action sequence.  And during the lesser of those action sequences, Liman shows that he too has a bit of Steven Seagal in him (one such sequence has a quick succession of limbs bending in directions they weren't designed to go).  Alas, his editing and choice of close-ups sometimes caused problems: is that Bourne's leg being broken, or the operative sent to kill him?  It got quite confusing at times.In the end, Bourne degenerates from being a perfect, but still humanly flawed, killing machine, to a capital-A, capital-H Action Hero.  Which is far from Damon or Liman's strengths.  I suspect that their instincts should have provided some room for doubt, but the audience never gets the impression that Bourne is in any real danger.  So a film that is still better than your average cookie-cutter spy picture becomes a minor disappointment for all the potential it wastes.",3,The Bourne Misstep,1024272000,"06 17,

Robert Ludlum's ingenious original story--he made Jason Bourne COMPLETELY alone, hunted by the police and his own colleagues alike, without even memory to help him--is given swift, streamlined treatment by director Doug Liman, with plenty of explosions, assassinations, car chases and double-crosses to keep us on the edge of our seats. Matt Damon gives an assured, charismatic performance as Bourne, his weathered baby face giving the character a certain poignancy without detracting in the slightest from his credibility. He's nobody's male ingenue anymore!

And it's interesting to see Chris Cooper, normally typecast as a nice guy, give such a thoroughly creepy performance as Bourne's treacherous CIA boss.

He also has no memory of who he is. After spending some time on the boat to recooperate, Bourne heads for Zurich to find out who he really is. Almost immediately he is forced to defend himself, and he soon discovers that he possesses the skills of a very dangerous man. With nowhere to go, he turns to the aid of poor German traveler named Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. Racing to unlock the secrets of his own identity, he discovers that he is an elite government agent. His CIA superior (Chris Cooper), sees Bourne as a rogue agent, and dispatches assassins to kill Bourne. Now the government's top agent, has become its number one target...I had extremely low expectations going into &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. Matt Damon has never done anything action related, and there have been many spy thrillers made over the years. I was pleasantly surprised. The action sequences are amazing, the fights are choreographed extremely well, there are tons of twists and turns to keep you guessing, the suspense is nail-biting at times, and the romance between Matt Damon and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente is great. Not to mention the fact that Damon is quite convincing and pulls the role off like he is a veteran action star. This film literally has everything that it takes to make a great movie. As far as the spy criteria goes, I was very pleased as well. The character Jason Bourne does not have any gadgets or gizmos to help him out. He must rely on his hands and his brain to get him out of jam after jam. This results in and excellent cat-and-mouse chase for the whole film. As you can see, the film does have a lot to offer. However, the reason that I cannot give it a five star rating, is due to the fact that it can be slow moving at times, which affects the overall pace of the film.

Cooper and especially Cox are my favorite. I enjoy the relationship between Bourne and Marie. Call me a romantic mush but how could they not have went with the alternative ending. The theatrical ending never made sense to me. It came off stiff and implausible. Bourne has been searching the globe for the woman he loves. When they finally reunite, they act as if they're old friends catching up, giving each other nice generic hugs. The alternative ending makes more sense. The raw passion and hunger they feel for each other comes through. It marks the incredible ordeal they've both endured. He was so incredible in that screen, he really acted a man who wanted to devour his woman.For those who are not romantic like me, the Bourne Identity mainly focuses on the spy thriller that is heavily character driven and it will not disappoint.

This is a popular, widely-seen film, and I would have to say that it is one of THE greatest action films ever made. It almost has too much action; it verges on the edge of being one of those roller-coaster movies made for people who have short attention spans. It also has a tad too much exposition for my tastes: I don't need the filmmakers to dot every ""i"" for me; I can figure things out. A further quibble is the amnesia thing, a hoary old device used in really bad TV shows by lazy writers. But the two leads are a great couple and there is much chemistry. Doug Liman does a fantastic directing job here; too bad he did not helm the later installments, which I found almost unwatchable because of all the shaking cameras and split-second cuts.

539791,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00003CXXM,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[0, 0]","First off, when I first heard that they were making a movie version of Robert Ludlum's novel, I had mixed feelings. I had read and thoroughly enjoyed the book many years ago and knew that it had been adapted into a TV movie back in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, although I have to confess that I never did get around to seeing it for fairly obvious reasons.So why the mixed feelings? Partly because, for a variety of reasons, movies rarely if ever live up to the novels on which they are based. Maybe this is because we have our own rigidly set perceptions of what the characters look like or because we are already familiar with the plot. Sometimes studios rewrite the plots of our favourite novels and the movie adaptation ends up being so dissimilar to the book that everything that was good about it has either been lost in the editing, or changed to the story's detriment.In the case of The Bourne Identity, the novel is a pretty substantial affair, full of plots and sub-plots, which would be pretty hard to cram into a mere 2 hours, without making significant changes. The Bourne Identity's script was reportedly written and re-written countless times. It took two years to shoot and, during this time, Matt Damon completed two other movies (Ocean's Eleven and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron). With this kind of background it is almost a wonder that this film was ever completed and as a result pre-release expectations were none too high. However, against all odds, Doug Liman (Go, Swingers) has produced a slick and competent thriller.Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac found drifting in the Mediterranean sea after being pumped full of lead and left for dead. After being rescued by a fishing boat and nursed back from to health our hero sets off from Marseille with the intention of trying to rekindle his lost memories. Along the way, much to his bemusement, he not only finds himself pursued by shadowy would-be assassins, he discovers that he has skills and instincts that suggest that he himself may also be a ruthless trained killer.So cue some great action sequences; several impressive fight scenes and an excellent car chase through Paris and enough of the original novel's twists and turns to keep the audience interested. Plus, throw in Franka Potente as an interesting female lead and unwilling companion, Clive Owen and Brian Cox in good supporting performances and two hours slip seamlessly by.

In his first role as an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease.As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an Italian fishing boat. The ""hey, this is a story about espionage"" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and until now, so does the audience.If there is one misstep in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a ""how will he survive?"" thriller rather than a ""who am I?"" mystery.A love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress Franka Potente) gives Bourne a ""partner in crime"" to play off of for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development. An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the action.The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling into the Mediterranean Sea.Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film is a winner for older teens and adults.Nappaland.com Recommends: Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a worthy discovery.After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward:---What do you think prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about Bourne's moral compass?---How would you feel if you suddenly couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to discover your identity?---When faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew.

539804,A33TBHM3O9AY17,B00003CXXM,No one of consequence,"[2, 3]","I just watched this one within the last week, and I must say I was duly impressed.  This offering is fast-paced, high tech, very sexy - a wild ride from beginning to end.  I found it rather reminiscent of a James Bond movie, but much grittier and without a clearly defined enemy - at least early on.  One of the elements I most enjoyed was heavy sense of mystery that pervades the first half of the movie.Matt Damon does a slightly above-average acting job as Jason Bourne, who doesn't even know his own name or identity when he is dragged half dead out of the Mediterranean by the crew of a French fishing boat.  The only clue about his past is a micro-laser embedded in his hip, which reveals the name of a bank in Zurich, along with a numbered Swiss account.  Weeks later, still no closer to overcoming his amnesia, he is put ashore and makes a beeline for Zurich, where he finds a safe deposit box containing a stack of passports in various names (one of which is Jason Bourne), as well as lots of cash and a gun.Still quite confused but unsuspecting of any trouble, he heads to the American embassy with hopes of getting some answers.  His reception there, however, is less than cordial, and suddenly he finds himself the object of an intense manhunt for reasons he cannot begin to fathom.  To make matters worse, his pursuers obviously would rather see him dead than alive.  Thus begins a non-stop, pulse pounding race across Europe as Bourne tries both to stay alive and find out who he is and why so many people are after him.Ultimately Bourne does figure out the answers to all his questions, but not before leaving in his wake a string of dead would-be assassins, along with a bunch of stymied police and covert operatives.  Unfortunately, he doesn't like what he finds out, and its clear that his past will never leave him alone.  This leaves the stage wide open for the sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"", which should hit the theaters quite soon.Overall I thought this movie was extremely riveting and entertaining.

A Swiss bank account number tattooed on this body leads him to discover he is Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) but no other facts are unearthed, except for knowing he has remarkable and terrifying talents. Besides finding out his name, he also finds in his Swiss box money, false passports, and a gun. With the help of a German gypsy, Marie (Franka Potente), he goes on a trail to find out his real identity. Unfortunately for him, assassins have a new target... him!""The Bourne Identity"" most certainly falls into the category of a spy thriller, a new venture for Matt Damon who is the star of the movie. Throughout the movie I was very impressed with his spectacular fight scenes, obvious that he had training in kickboxing, karate, and firearms, using the skills like a 'born' natural (no pun intended :). His acting is also well done, from his expressions, emotions, and even showing the lack of both. Franka Potente is also a good love interest in the movie. She displays both nervousness and strength in her character. Other notable stars are Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, and Julia Stiles, though their roles are very small.Of course the movie has spectacular action and fighting scenes, mesmerizing you throughout the film. From car chase scenes and foxes and hounds chases to hand to hand combat fighting and gun fighting, you will be tense with excitement and suspense! One of the interesting things about the movie is the car chase scene. Well, we all have seen probably numerous car chase scenes with the hero in a cool sports car, Matt Damon as Jason Bourne drives a mini cooper! Now that was interesting! But some of the fight scenes are a bit violent, especially the end, hence the PG-13 rating.The movie is not all action, there is actually a pretty neat plot! The story is based on Robert Ludlum's 1980 bestseller so you can rely on ""The Bourne Identity"" having an intricate plot with lots of twists and turns. But one thing that disappointed me was the conclusion. The end was a bit confusing, making you wonder what in the world had been going on? Maybe it was me or the ending didn't seem to make sense. But I think the filmmakers are just making way for the sequel which I expect since ""The Bourne Identity"" is only the first in a trilogy. The other two sequels are ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".So, if you are looking for a movie with lots of action and thrills, I highly recommend you ""The Bourne Identity"" which I'm sure will satisfy!",5,"""The Bourne Identity"": A spy thriller in a class all its own",1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,2637,"['man', 'found', 'almost', 'dead', 'two', 'bullet', 'holes', 'back', 'what', 'more', 'mysterious', 'when', 'consciousness', 'memory', 'gone', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'number', 'tattooed', 'body', 'discover', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'other', 'facts', 'are', 'unearthed', 'knowing', 'remarkable', 'terrifying', 'talents', 'finding', 'out', 'name', 'also', 'Swiss', 'box', 'money', 'false', 'passports', 'gun', 'help', 'German', 'gypsy', 'Marie', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'trail', 'find', 'out', 'real', 'identity', 'Unfortunately', 'assassins', 'have', 'new', 'target', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'most', 'certainly', 'category', 'spy', 'thriller', 'new', 'venture', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'star', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'spectacular', 'fight', 'scenes', 'obvious', 'had', 'training', 'kickboxing', 'karate', 'firearms', 'using', 'skills', ""'born"", 'natural', 'pun', 'intended', 'acting', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'expressions', 'emotions', 'even', 'showing', 'lack', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'also', 'good', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'nervousness', 'strength', 'character', 'Other', 'notable', 'stars', 'are', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'roles', 'are', 'very', 'small.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'action', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'foxes', 'chases', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'fighting', 'gun', 'fighting', 'will', 'be', 'tense', 'excitement', 'suspense', 'One', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'Well', 'have', 'seen', 'probably', 'numerous', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'hero', 'cool', 'sports', 'car', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'mini', 'cooper', 'Now', 'was', 'interesting', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'violent', 'especially', 'end', 'hence', 'PG-13', 'rating.The', 'movie', 'not', 'action', 'actually', 'pretty', 'neat', 'plot', 'story', 'based', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', '1980', 'bestseller', 'can', 'rely', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'having', 'intricate', 'plot', 'lots', 'twists', 'turns', 'one', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'was', 'conclusion', 'end', 'was', 'bit', 'confusing', 'making', 'wonder', 'what', 'world', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'Maybe', 'was', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'just', 'making', 'way', 'sequel', 'expect', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'only', 'first', 'trilogy', 'other', 'two', 'sequels', 'are', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', '.So', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'thrills', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Bourne', 'Identity', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'satisfy']",N/A

It is a thriller and the characters are so rich and well drawn.A man is dragged from the sea. He has two bullet wounds and a &quot;chip&quot; embedded into his body. These are removed; the man recovers from this ordeal. He does not, however, remember anything, His name, where he is from from and his entire identity has been lost. He takes the chip and goes in search of himself. In a bank in Zurich he finds his identity- Jason Bourne and several other passports and lots of money. Enough information for Jason Bourne to change his identity whenever he needs to. But what does this mean?  It appears to mean that many people are after Jason Bourne, that he has information that many people want or they want this information to die!! Around every corner is danger and there is no one that he can trust. He meets up with two CIA analysts who appear to be trustworthy, but are they really?  He travels all over Europe and changes identities at every turn. He meets very interesting people at every turn. His life is full of risk and danger.  Jason Bourne is an important person with so much hidden information that he doesn't remember. But as time goes on, the people he meets share some of what he is missing, and he is beginning to put the pieces together.  He begins a love affair, and he thinks this is what he has been looking for. Why can't he be happy as a single man leaving the &quot;spy&quot; profession and finding his true love?The movie stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, and he does a credible job. The action filming is wonderfully done. The car chases and the flights on foot and in trains are very real and I felt I was amongst them. I was part of the action!! Franke Potente plays Jason Bourne's love interest. Chris Cooper is the enemy and as always is a star- a cruel man who completes his job. The scenery is fantastic and brilliant. What I did miss in this movie that was not transposed from the book, is the storyline of Carlos, The Jackal. This is an important part of the book, and is not in the movie at all. Jason Bourne and Carlos have much admiratiion for each other even though they are sworn enemies. This is a significant loss, and the movie does not have the drama, background and richness of the book.  This is, however, a movie to be enjoyed- I understand the sequel, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is out this week.

Nonetheless, if you want to own an edition of ""The Bourne Identity"" on DVD, this is the one to have. Since I can't give a 3.5, I'll round up to 4 stars, because I genuinely enjoyed the story.  As a longtime Robert Ludlum fan, I viewed this film with a skeptical eye; so many of Ludlum's brilliant books have been butchered onscreen in the past.  But Matt Damon and Franka Potente won me over; they are a great pair onscreen, and they play true to the characters in Ludlum's story, albeit a little on the younger side. They have a nice chemistry and they do not overplay their roles...they grow on the viewer in the same way that they grow on each other, over time. Admittedly, some liberties are taken with the original story, but nothing violates the spirit of Ludlum's work. Director Doug Liman has a crisp, spare style that keeps things moving briskly. I did find that the robotic affectations of the assassins were a little bit overplayed and distracting, and Clive Owen's time onscreen is way too brief and truncated.  Likewise, I would have liked a little bit more screen time for Chris Cooper, one of the best character actors in movies today. But this film belongs to Damon, and he delivers.  He is understated, but intriguing; gentle, but suddenly and explosively violent; conflicted, but decisive when the situation demands it.

Wiklanski ""reading rider""","[3, 6]","I'll be the first to admit that this review is less to do with these specific Bourne movies and more related to the Blu Ray conversion however I feel that one needs to understand the issues with these discs before addressing the movies themselves. Let me cut to the chase, do NOT buy these discs! They will frustrate and annoy you every time you attempt to watch them, allow me to explain.I have a Samsung Blu Ray player with updated firmware (don't get me started on that process) connected via HDMI cable to Samsung LCDTV, generally Blu Ray discs work fine on this set up, there are occasions when on other discs the movies will pause for a brief second and then continue however these Bourne movies were impossible to watch. To begin with they seem to feature their own unique controls meaning that trying to scan forward or backward would cause the disc to lock and seemingly stall, never did get the movie to scan properly. Then there were the issues with the movie in general, the picture repeatedly froze, in car chases and in Chapter 11 (and multiple points thereafter) while they are sitting talking in the car, the sound was then out of synch with the picture and more freezing and stalling, it was so bad that I ejected the discs and watched the old DVD versions of the movies. Utterly unacceptable, beyond annoying!As for the movies themselves, what this experiment did show the dramatic improvement of the Blu Ray versions, the picture was much crisper, the colors richer and more saturated and certainly less noise in the picture, also the sounds was much better, more full and dynamic, too bad that the technology rendered the discs unwatchable.The irony is that I had ""upgraded"" from an HDDVD when that format lost out and I had this movie on HD, there were NO problems, same outstanding picture and the player had none of the issues that I attribute to Blu Ray. For whatever reason I believe that Blu Ray is simply not ready yet, too many glitches, I don't want to have to constantly monitor my firmware to watch a movie! That same kind of updating madness is what got me to migrate from a Windows PC to a Mac!The bottom line is this, the movies are fantastic! Honestly one of my favorite trilogies and WHEN the disc is working the picture and sound really are phenomenal, the problem is in the ""when"", it is frustrating and unacceptable to deal with these glitches, yes, the movies are being returned to Amazon and a formal letter of complaint is being registered with Universal Home Entertainment.

It covers all the standard spy genre staples without getting too clich&eacute;d (no outrageous spy gizmos a-la Bond), it tells an interesting story that isn't too overused, but formulaic enough to not be too stimulating, and provides ample excuses to bring on car chases and explosions.Matt Damon adds a star to this flick, his presence always seems to raise the bar of any film he's in. It may not stretch his acting abilities, but it is fun to see him in the role of an action hero, even though his character doesn't remember he is. That amnesia is part of what makes Bourne work as a character. He isn't that confident, self-assured spy you usually get, he's confused and frightened by his physical and mental abilities.

This is the only one directed by Doug Liman, who performs masterfully behind the camera; although he is the executive producer for the two follow-on films. This is of course based on the Robert Ludlum novel; and having read the novel many years ago, I do see some familiar reference points...the plotline, however, has been radically changed and updated. Please, no whiny complaints that this is not a faithful adaptation of a favorite novel. The screenplay, as written by Tony Gilroy, is intelligent and portrays a compelling and mostly believable espionage story. The only part that strained my credulity meter a bit was the clandestine obfuscation and confusion regarding the CIA black ops operation called &#34;Treadstone&#34;. Perhaps it will be clearer to you than it was to me. Matt Damon was an inspired choice as the title character, Jason Bourne; as was Franka Potente, as his partner and love interest, Marie. Don't know what film some other reviewers were watching, but I saw excellent chemistry between the two...the romantic aspects are downplayed in favor of character development and action...which is fine w/me.

After all, rarely is the remake even watchable, much less on a par with the original.This is one of the exceptions. The new version of The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman of Go fame, contains all the fluff factor of an awful remake yet remains watchable in a turn-your-brain-off way.

Obligatory love interest Marie is played by indie darling Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), and a well-cast batch of supporting characters keep the acting level higher than one normally gets from this sort of thing while never quite taking themselves too seriously.

I had originally hoped to see this when it came out in the theaters, but the multiple bad reviews I read and the two friends I had who disliked it made me take a pass on it.  Now, I am mystified why people disliked it.  I thought it was a first rate spy thriller.  I had only one serious complaint (a scene in which our hero jumps off an extremely high point holding a corpse underneath him to break the fall:  sorry, a corpse isn't a parachute and wouldn't have kept his body from being crushed by impact).  By and large, it was a thoroughly satisfying spy flick.I never read the Robert Ludlum novel or saw the first version of the film, but I love the premise:  a man is found floating in the Atlantic with two bullets in his back and a tiny canister in his right hip, a canister that contains information about a Swiss bank account.  Gradually, the man, played by Matt Damon, learns that he possesses a perplexing range of skills with languages, fighting, using a gun, being preternaturally aware of his surroundings, and driving a car.  With the help of a young German woman, fetchingly played by RUN LOLA RUN's Franka Potente, he heads off to Paris from Switzerland, where, as they say, the plot thickens.  I like the way that Matt Damon manages to exude a profound sense of self-confusion while learning that his fighting and survival skills were off-the-chart.  He will accidently get into a fight, leaving two or three people severely injured, and he would be profoundly completely rattled by what he had been able to do.I don't want to exaggerate the merits of the film.  It isn't a masterpiece; it is a highly enjoyable spy flick.  Everything is executed well, and of the supporting cast Chris Cooper stands out as Bourne's ""control"" in Washington, DC.

539844,A1JIPFV4OL520T,B00003CXXM,Robert Wynkoop,"[2, 2]","Wow! Where was I when this flick came out?  It is a great spy movie equal to the best of the classic Cold War spy movies.  I guess I soured on spy movies after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  In their quest for new villains, Hollywood made big business the new boogey-man.  Oh, um . . . unless you are a foaming at the mouth liberal, big business does not make a very good villain.  How many post-Cold War movies I have seen where some corporate evil businessman attempts to wreak havoc on human kind for the sake of profit.  What is totally unbelievable about these movies is that very rarely can a leader move hundreds, if not thousands of people to do his bidding without an ideology behind it.  People just will not kills thousands of people, put the human race at risk, let alone putting ones own life at risk so some greedy corporate suit can make more money.  History has shown that people seldom will risk their lives so their boss can make more money, but they will willingly lay down their own lives for a religious or political ideology to motivate them.  Hitler got men to kill millions in order to purify the white race; Moslem extremists get young people to strap bombs on themselves and blow up innocent women and children in order to reclaim Palestine and kill Jews; The Crusaders willing gave up their wealth and lives to liberate the Holy Land from the Moslem occupiers. It takes ideology to motivate people.The Bourne Identity avoided this pitfall by focusing in on a event that one could believe in- the CIA attempting to kill and African despot who was going to publicly  identify CIA operatives.

Despite the only faint resemblance to the original novel (which I read during my sophomore year of high school and absolutely loved!!), the occasionally painfully lame dialogue between Bourne and his lady friend, and the Jackie Chan (I'm not a fan) action/fight scenes, this movie had enough brass to keep me interested in the theaters and then over the weekend on DVD.

And can the very same person be a cold-blooded murderer in one incarnation, then become a virtual humanitarian when all memory of that previous life somehow gets wiped away? These provocative questions are raised, though never adequately explored, in `The Bourne Identity,' a fairly standard man-on-the-run spy thriller based on the best selling novel by Robert Ludlum. Written by Tony Gilroy and directed by Doug Liman, `The Bourne Identity' tells the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA hit man who has been suffering from amnesia ever since his bullet-riddled body was plucked floating out of the Mediterranean Sea. Initially unaware of his secret agent status, Jason - together with Marie, a young woman he picks up in Switzerland and hires to drive him to Paris - tries to piece together the clues to his identity and purpose. Essentially we are back in old Hitchcock territory, where the story's hero is being chased by all sorts of nefarious figures even though he himself has not a clue as to who these people are or why it is they are so anxious to put an end to him.`The Bourne Identity' might have been a more interesting film had it attempted to explore some of the more subtle implications of its morality play situation. Instead, the filmmakers concentrate almost exclusively on the superficial aspects of its spy thriller premise. There are brief flashes where Jason ponders the deeper issues of a troubled conscience, but they are quickly thrown over for the usual cat-and-mouse accoutrements of this odd-man-out scenario. And, frankly, despite the novelty of the Paris setting and some impressive stunt and action scenes scattered along the way, nothing in the film really much engages the audience's sympathy or interest. Matt Damon does a solid job conveying the underlying sweetness of Bourne's character, but nothing in his demeanor or behavior can convince us that he is a government-generated killing machine. What's missing from this story is any attempt to show how this character, whom we have come to view as compassionate and loving, could ever have done the things he is said to have done. That analysis would have lent the film that extra bit of depth it so sorely lacks in its current form.The film is at its most interesting when it shows how Bourne, because he is himself a product of CIA training, can use the very tools his mentors gave him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and even outwit the professionals at their own game.The film features a relatively impressive car chase through the streets of Paris (though it pales in comparison to the ones in `Ronin'). But I can't believe that filmmakers are STILL using that old standby - the one where some workers just happen to be transporting a piece of glass across the street just so the careening cars can come crashing through it.

The Bourne Identity strongly delivers.  Matt Damon is able to convince us that he's a human killing-machine who is suddenly laboring with a conscience and the small problem of not remembering who he is.  The fight scenes are great; the problem-solving skills are pretty good; and the car chase scene is quite memorable.  It would be impossible to condense all the detail of Bourne's novel into a two-hour flick, but the film does a good job of capturing its spirit.The film makes good use of its European setting, taking us from Italy to Switzerland and finally to France.  It was great seeing Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) make the leap to American cinema.  She doesn't get to shine to her full potential -- but she's an exciting new face, and her presence adds to the international dimension of the film.  (As an aside, if you are looking for an action film that isn't just another action film, ""Run, Lola Run"" is a lot of fun.)What the film doesn't do is push against the boundaries of its genre.

Maybe it was the quick tempo or the technical spy jargon that is thrown pell-mell at the viewer in the first few scenes, but in any case I was quickly confused. By the time I caught up with what Jason Bourne might have been and who he was trying to be, I had lost my desire to care.  When the film appeared again a few months later on Cable TV, however, I  forced myself to watch it more intensely. Whether it was the manner I employed or merely because I had been previously exposed, the second impression became a more rewarding experience: I was able to follow an intriguing, rather than distorted, plot; the European locations took on more relevance as they richly enhanced the authenticity of the story; and the action served as a prism through which I could better understand the character of Jason Bourne.  Eventually I realized that this is not, as I had initially believed, merely a movie peppered with special effects and computerized production to provide immediate visual stimulation.  It is all that, but it is also a film of multi-layered substance, not least of which is its complex, sympathetic main character, who, gifted in intelligence and expertly trained, must overcome all odds. Opposed alike by those he was sent to destroy as well as by his own leaders, he must survive by battling, not with special James Bond-like gadgets from another world, but, more believably, with his wits and guile. His amnesia prompts him to search for his identity, but that quest also forces him to question his very role as a hired assassin, perhaps, with the support of a woman he has serendipitously met, regaining his sense of humanity along the way.  We are ultimately, therefore, treated to a riveting, fast-paced, yet thought-provoking, odyssey.  Matt Damon, appearing more comfortable and confident than usual, ably plays the part of Bourne, complemented by brilliant supporting performances from Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brain Cox, and  Clive Owen, who, with only a few lines, brings a ton of presence to the ""Professor"" character.In the end, I was fortunate that I gave this movie a second chance.

There's no bracing stupidity on display here.Unfortunately, while this approach dodges typical action bombast, it also manages to avoid much in the way of excitement. Moment to moment, the film is elegantly directed; individual action scenes impress, as does the naturalistic acting, and there are scenes of reasonable suspense.But despite this, most of the film feels vaguely dull. There's just not enough story here. In the interests of style and believability, the filmmakers have stripped their tale so lean that there's not much reason to care what happens their characters, or down the backstretch even why Bourne and his CIA handlers behave as they do.The Bourne Identity is extremely well-crafted, and probably the best film that could have been made from this script, but for all its cool, the end result is tepid.

539877,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B00003CXXM,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[1, 1]","XXXXXThis movie is loosely based on the 1980 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).Do you like action-packed mystery-thrillers?  If you do, then this movie is a must-see.The viewer along with the main character in this movie, later revealed to be Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), suffers from amnesia, not knowing his own identity (thus the movie's title) or anything about his past.  As the movie progresses, both the viewer and Bourne discover one major thing: he posses a lethal survival skill-set that's light years above that of the average Joe.  The other things Bourne discovers about himself make him unhappy with him, at one point saying:""Everything I find out [about myself], I want to forget.""Once the viewer discovers that the premise of this entire movie is about discovering identity, then it can only hold the viewer's attention in one way: through action.  It is on this that the movie delivers especially with respect to incredible fight sequences.  One character summarizes the majority of the movie when he says that Bourne leaves a""trail of collateral damage from Zurich to Paris.""It is at the movie's end that all is revealed.Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  If not for his fine performance, I think this movie would have probably been a flop.  I also found that the background music and sometimes gritty photography to be impressive.This movie spawned two sequels: ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007).The only problem with this movie is that the idea of Bourne constantly trying to discover his identity can become tedious.  True, the action sequences attempt to take away from this tedium but I found myself getting a bit restless as the movie proceeded.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.In conclusion, this movie introduces us to a new action hero and his name is Jason Bourne!!(2002;  1 hr 50 min (excluding end credits);  wide screen;  20 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",4,Bourne to Survive,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,2109,"['XXXXXThis', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', '1980', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', '1927', '2001', '.Do', 'action-packed', 'mystery-thrillers', 'do', 'then', 'movie', 'must-see.The', 'viewer', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'later', 'revealed', 'be', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'suffers', 'amnesia', 'not', 'knowing', 'own', 'identity', 'thus', 'movie', 'title', 'anything', 'past', 'movie', 'viewer', 'Bourne', 'discover', 'one', 'major', 'thing', 'lethal', 'survival', 'skill-set', 'light', 'years', 'average', 'Joe', 'other', 'things', 'Bourne', 'discovers', 'make', 'unhappy', 'one', 'point', 'saying', 'Everything', 'find', 'out', '[', ']', 'want', 'forget', 'viewer', 'premise', 'entire', 'movie', 'discovering', 'identity', 'then', 'can', 'only', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'one', 'way', 'action', 'movie', 'delivers', 'especially', 'respect', 'incredible', 'fight', 'sequences', 'One', 'character', 'majority', 'movie', 'when', 'Bourne', 'trail', 'collateral', 'damage', 'Zurich', 'Paris', 'movie', 'end', 'revealed.Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'effectively', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', 'fine', 'performance', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'flop', 'also', 'found', 'background', 'music', 'sometimes', 'gritty', 'photography', 'be', 'impressive.This', 'movie', 'spawned', 'two', 'sequels', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', '2004', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', '2007', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'idea', 'Bourne', 'constantly', 'trying', 'discover', 'identity', 'can', 'become', 'tedious', 'True', 'action', 'attempt', 'take', 'away', 'tedium', 'found', 'getting', 'bit', 'restless', 'movie', 'proceeded.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2004', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'many', 'extras', 'including', 'alternate', 'ending.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'new', 'action', 'hero', 'name', 'Jason', 'Bourne', '2002', '1', 'hr', '50', 'min', 'excluding', 'end', 'credits', 'wide', 'screen', '20', 'scenes', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",N/A

And what an update it is.  I felt as if I were watching it for the first time.  Rather than a boring synopsis of the plot, let's focus on the Blu Ray's quality.  The video in its 1080p with a 2.35:1 pull down does leave letterboxes bars top and bottom which doesn't bother me in the least.  Colors are clear and crisp and, most important, clean. In my opinion the video transfer is really quite good and saw not one problem with it.  The DTS-HD Audio, however, stands out as being just excellent with wide use of all the surrounds for very discreet channel usage.  Often, and especially for the rear channels, the audio on discs is more akin to the older Dolby Digital mixes where the left and right rears really produced the same audio. Not on the Bourne Identity sound mix.  Each channel was fed its own discreet audio which really made the movie more immersive for the viewer.  A fine workout is called for the sub channel as well.Being the first film of the trilogy, I didn't expect much from this older film but I was very wrong as both video and audio quality was superb.In addition, there are no filler previews for other films or completely unnecessary extras.  And there are a ton of pertinent extras to choose from.  The alternate beginnings and endings were unfinished in post production and, therefore, their color grading and final post production results were never realized as you can see the blowout whites and artifacting in these two extra clips but they are interesting and pertinent to watch.  The other deleted scenes could all have been included in the movie as an extended version as they did not seem to me to be pointless scenes, yet their non inclusion doesn't affect the movie that is here.Other additional features are an interesting interview with Robert Ludlum and go back to how he got started as a writer as well as an interview with the screenwriter.  From a previous DvD release, a behind the scenes feature on some of the most captivating fight scenes you will see in any movie and how it was choreographed as well as a great many more relevant extras to boot.I strongly recommend Bourne Identity as an update to your collection.post script.  Just noticed that the plastic cover  is stamped on the back 'Made in Mexico'.  I have no idea whether that is relevant or not but, as I said, this is an excellent blu ray dvd.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Bourne Identity on Blu Ray,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,2948,"['bought', 'part', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Trilogy', 'package', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Amazon', 'local', 'Frys', 'jumbo', 'store', 'had', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'sale', '19.99', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'upgrading', 'original', 'Bourne', 'DVDs', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'versions', 'what', 'update', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'Rather', 'boring', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'let', 'focus', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'quality', 'video', '1080p', '2.35:1', 'pull', 'down', 'leave', 'letterboxes', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', ""n't"", 'bother', 'least', 'Colors', 'are', 'clear', 'crisp', 'most', 'important', 'clean', 'opinion', 'video', 'transfer', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'saw', 'not', 'one', 'problem', 'DTS-HD', 'Audio', 'however', 'out', 'being', 'just', 'excellent', 'wide', 'use', 'surrounds', 'very', 'discreet', 'channel', 'usage', 'Often', 'especially', 'rear', 'channels', 'audio', 'discs', 'more', 'akin', 'older', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'mixes', 'where', 'left', 'right', 'rears', 'really', 'produced', 'same', 'audio', 'Not', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'sound', 'mix', 'channel', 'was', 'fed', 'own', 'discreet', 'audio', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'immersive', 'viewer', 'fine', 'workout', 'called', 'sub', 'channel', 'well.Being', 'first', 'film', 'trilogy', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'older', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'wrong', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'was', 'superb.In', 'addition', 'are', 'filler', 'previews', 'other', 'films', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'extras', 'are', 'ton', 'pertinent', 'extras', 'choose', 'alternate', 'beginnings', 'endings', 'were', 'unfinished', 'post', 'production', 'therefore', 'color', 'grading', 'final', 'post', 'production', 'results', 'were', 'never', 'realized', 'can', 'see', 'blowout', 'whites', 'artifacting', 'two', 'extra', 'clips', 'are', 'interesting', 'pertinent', 'watch', 'other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'movie', 'extended', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'non', 'inclusion', ""n't"", 'affect', 'movie', 'here.Other', 'additional', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'interview', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'go', 'back', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'writer', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'screenwriter', 'previous', 'DvD', 'release', 'scenes', 'feature', 'most', 'captivating', 'fight', 'scenes', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'choreographed', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'many', 'more', 'relevant', 'extras', 'boot.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'update', 'collection.post', 'script', 'Just', 'noticed', 'plastic', 'cover', 'stamped', 'back', ""'Made"", 'Mexico', 'have', 'idea', 'relevant', 'not', 'said', 'excellent', 'blu', 'ray', 'dvd.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

The smart thriller is one that has good characters, good action, a good story, and most importantly - it does not force me to strain my disbelief. The Bourne Identity is such a film.Matt Damon does a fine job playing the part of Jason Bourne, and after two movies now I can't see another actor playing the part. He  brings a believability to the role that the last string of James Bond movies sadly lacks.This movie creates a character we would think the ultimate spy would be. While he is intelligent, he does not rely on gadgets or technology. He is quick with his wits and his fists and he is always cool while under fire or in danger. He is an ultra-professional and meticulous in his attention to detail.I found the martial arts in this film refreshingly different and interesting to watch. Nobody goes flying into walls or gets knocked out with a chop to the neck. The fights are lengthy, brutal, and exciting to watch. The director also takes care to keep the camera back so we can actually see the actors doing the moves, something many modern movies are relutant to do because it's easier to do close-ups and fancy editing when an actor doesn't really have the skills.Matt Damon, along with a fine ensemble cast, carries the movie and leaves us wanting more when it's finally over.

539882,AHNT97DWEAQUY,B00003CXXM,"Sumbudy ""buriedatlantis""","[8, 9]","Doug Liman has crafted an immensly watchable spy thriller with The Bourne Identity. If you're a fan of the book, unlearn what you have learned and enjoy the movie for what it is. Matt Damon shows us again that he is a gifted actor in giving the character of Jason Bourne a life that other actors may have just sleepwalked through. It must truly stink waking up one day and not know who you are. But to find that you can kick the stuffing out of two armed cops without breaking a sweat? That must be simply disturbing and Damon pulls it off without seeming to break a sweat himself.And let us not forget outstanding supporting work from Franke Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen and the always dependable Brian Cox. These guys elevate this movie from what would have been an entertaining action flick into a great action flick.The DVD is... okay, I guess. It's always nice to see some deleted scenes. The alternate ending isn't as alternate as it could have been (same result, different type of execution). The making of featurette is just that, a bit of a fluff piece that touches on some stuff, but never really goes deeper. The commentary by Liman is nice and imformative. He answers some stuff you may have been thinking about, like why is Julia Stiles in such a small role in the movie (when they were actually shooting the movie, she wasn't quite a name yet).Not exactly the best in the special features department, but the movie looks and sounds great.

My companion complained of it being too visually ""dark,"" (the sun never shines), but I felt mid-winter dreariness in Europe was at least no worse than say Michigan at the same time of year.Matt Damon is amnesiac, Jason Bourne, who was left for dead floating in the sea with two bullets in his back, was saved by some good hearted fishermen.  The audience (but not Jason) quickly learns he is an assassin for a mysterious government agency code named ""Treadstone,"" and he has failed to accomplish a mission.  Jason is marked for assassination by the agency to protect its existence.  The chase is on!  He finds he has a Swiss safety deposit account with a sheaf of passports and millions of dollars in various currencies.  He meets a penniless girl, Marie (Franke Potente) who with a certain amount of ambivalence, agrees to drive him to Paris for $20,000.  Jason is in the classic ""you can run, but you can't hide"" situation.The film keeps up a fast pace with a wonderful car chase and has a ""startle"" scene beyond compare.  (Jason and Marie are taking a quiet breather in a safe apartment when an assassin crashes through a large window almost on top of them.  I think I self-levitated about three feet out of my seat!).  Ms. Potente is a delight as Marie; quirky, funny, highly nervous interspersed with deep resigned calm.  Her presence brightened every scene.  Matt Damon is miscast as a trained assassin.  He comes off as an All American Boy too young for the role.  There are loose ends that are never satisfactorily explained or even commented upon. (Why discard a warm jacket only to shiver through the next five scenes?  Why not replace the bright red bank bag that stands out like a signboard while running around Zurich?)  The biggest problem with the film is the only one who is mystified is Jason Bourne.  The audience knows exactly who he is and who is chasing him from the beginning of the film.  The manner in which he failed his mission seems unlikely and falls flat.If expectations are not too high, I recommend this as a good summer film.

539885,A266S48N5Y6BU5,B00003CXXM,"""swingoutsisterguy""","[0, 6]","I saw this film over the 4th of July weekend. My buddy wanted to see it and I had mixed feelings about seeing it.After we left, I was wondering ""What happened to my $[money]?""Let's clear one thing up, Matt Damon is no action hero. The only people on that list should be: Harrison Ford, Will Smith, Sigourney Weaver and Bruce Willis, et al. Second of all, this was not as action packed as I expected it to be. My buddy was really hyped up about the film; before, during and after. I was slightly dumbfounded.The car chase scene was good, not great. I do not know why they, the media, hyped it up. I have seen better car chases in Mad Max movies. The ""girl"" was annoying. Her overly laid back attitude was not becoming of an action film. She tended to slow things down. But I guess you need a female to spice up this ""action packed"" film.The movie starts out in the Meditteranean Sea. Our hapless hero, Matt Damon, is resuced by a fishing boat. He is alive despite the bullets in his back. He finally wakes up and does not know who or what he is. Then when they dock, he is homeless. He finds himself sleeping on a bench, the suspense is building, and then attacks two police officers just because they ask him for papers. Then he finds himself being chased by the authorities. He goes to the American Embassay and sees a woman being harrassed by the people behind the partition (just like at the DMV). He eventually hires her to drive him to Paris for $20,000. Reluctantly, why?, she takes the money. He goes to a bank, not knowing why he has to, and discovers his identity, or identities. He starts to question who and what he is while being attacked and hunted by other CIA operatives.But the highlight of the whole boring ordeal is that car chase scene. I waited for the action to take place, but it never did. The only action scene worth mentioning was the fight scene between Matt and somebody attacking him in his Paris apartment.Then there was the scene out in the snow, on the property of the friend of the girl. That is where Matt seems to have a revelation about what he is.Near the close of the film, there is another assassin getting reading to take out his target. What I was confused about is that the target is the guy who has been sending out men to kill Jason Bourne. I still was not too sure as to why he was killed. In the spy business, it is ""kill or be killed."" He was doing his job by dispatching men to kill Jason. But I guess since he failed the entire mission, killing a French speaking African (I think-but then again it was never too clear), then his death is justified. He became the target. Then the movie ends. Of course not without Jason finally getting the girl.Overall, this movie was a disappointment. Definately not worth the price of a adult ticket. I would not see this movie again. James Bond films are a lot more fun and have significantly more action than this ""spy-thriller"".I recommend you wait for the DVD or video.",3,DAMON IS NO ACTION HERO!!!,1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,2957,"['saw', 'film', '4th', 'July', 'weekend', 'buddy', 'wanted', 'see', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'seeing', 'it.After', 'left', 'was', 'wondering', 'What', 'happened', '[', 'money', ']', 'Let', 'clear', 'one', 'thing', 'up', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'action', 'hero', 'only', 'people', 'list', 'should', 'be', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'et', 'al', 'Second', 'was', 'not', 'action', 'packed', 'expected', 'be', 'buddy', 'was', 'really', 'hyped', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'slightly', 'dumbfounded.The', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'media', 'hyped', 'up', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'car', 'chases', 'Mad', 'Max', 'movies', 'girl', 'was', 'annoying', 'overly', 'laid', 'back', 'attitude', 'was', 'not', 'becoming', 'action', 'film', 'tended', 'slow', 'things', 'down', 'guess', 'need', 'female', 'spice', 'up', 'action', 'packed', 'film.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Meditteranean', 'Sea', 'hapless', 'hero', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'resuced', 'fishing', 'boat', 'alive', 'bullets', 'back', 'finally', 'up', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'Then', 'when', 'dock', 'homeless', 'sleeping', 'bench', 'suspense', 'building', 'then', 'attacks', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'just', 'ask', 'papers', 'Then', 'being', 'chased', 'authorities', 'American', 'Embassay', 'woman', 'being', 'harrassed', 'people', 'partition', 'just', 'DMV', 'eventually', 'drive', 'Paris', '20,000', 'Reluctantly', 'why', 'money', 'bank', 'not', 'knowing', 'why', 'identity', 'identities', 'question', 'who', 'what', 'being', 'attacked', 'hunted', 'other', 'CIA', 'highlight', 'whole', 'boring', 'ordeal', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'waited', 'action', 'take', 'place', 'never', 'did', 'only', 'action', 'scene', 'mentioning', 'was', 'fight', 'scene', 'Matt', 'somebody', 'attacking', 'Paris', 'apartment.Then', 'was', 'scene', 'out', 'snow', 'property', 'friend', 'girl', 'where', 'Matt', 'have', 'revelation', 'what', 'is.Near', 'close', 'film', 'assassin', 'getting', 'reading', 'take', 'out', 'target', 'What', 'was', 'confused', 'about', 'target', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'sending', 'out', 'men', 'kill', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'still', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'killed', 'spy', 'business', 'kill', 'be', 'killed', 'was', 'doing', 'job', 'dispatching', 'men', 'kill', 'Jason', 'guess', 'failed', 'entire', 'mission', 'killing', 'French', 'speaking', 'African', 'think-but', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'never', 'too', 'clear', 'then', 'death', 'justified', 'became', 'target', 'Then', 'movie', 'course', 'not', 'Jason', 'finally', 'getting', 'girl.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Definately', 'not', 'price', 'adult', 'ticket', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'have', 'significantly', 'more', 'action', 'spy-thriller', 'recommend', 'wait', 'DVD', 'video']",N/A

The fight scenes were very good although at times you could tell that the film speed was advanced in order to make it look faster.  It was also a theme that has been explored before (with Jackie Chan's 'Who Am I') with some success.  With all that aside it was still an enjoyable movie.  A movie about assassins and the CIA.  About someone's personal struggle between good and evil and about a fledgling romance and wanting to be a better person.  It was also about betrayal.  This is a decent way to spend a few hours.

539889,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B00003CXXM,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 0]","As many of you probably already know, The Bourne Identity is the first of the three installments of the Bourne film trilogy. It is loosely based on the Novel by Robert Ludlum of the same name. I had already watched this film long before I realized that it was based on a novel and that there were actually three total books involving the Bourne character, all of which would soon have their own film adaptations. With all of that said, I was initially surprised on how good this film really was. I had my doubts that Matt Damon would be able to pull off a character like Jason Bourne. For some reason, Matt Damon just doesn't come to my mind when you think action star, but he really pulled it off here. Not only Damon, but the supporting cast is good as well, with Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Julia Styles all having good performances. But what I loved about this movie was the pacing. This film has very few slow parts in it, but yet it isn't just all over-the-top action either. There's a very good balance to the film. And during the more action-packed sequences, it isn't just senseless action for the sake of action, there's a purpose behind it. The main reason for this is simply because this a good story, and it keeps the audience entertained. There's more than just one storyline happening throughout the film as you get to follow the Jason Bourne character as he tries to find out just who he really is. I really don't have many negative things to say about this film. The only thing I would change would be the last action sequence in the film involving the Bourne character jumping off a staircase and shooting someone. I really thought that was completely unrealistic. Another thing that has really nothing to do with the movie, it's about the packaging of this DVD. This is supposed the the Extended Edition with a bunch of special features. But in reality, there's not a lot of difference in this edition and the regular one. There's a few more little featurettes and an alternate beginning and ending (which I didn't care too much for), and a few little other things, but nothing real special. Heck, this isn't even a 2-disc DVD! So, if you already have this movie and not this edition, then you're not missing much. But if you're thinking about purchasing this film for the first time, I highly recommend it to any fan of not only the action genre, but anyone who just wants to see a well-paced, well written story that will keep you entertained.",4,A great-paced action film with a good story,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,2482,"['many', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'first', 'three', 'installments', 'Bourne', 'film', 'trilogy', 'loosely', 'based', 'Novel', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'same', 'name', 'had', 'already', 'watched', 'film', 'long', 'realized', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'were', 'actually', 'three', 'total', 'books', 'involving', 'Bourne', 'character', 'would', 'soon', 'have', 'own', 'film', 'adaptations', 'said', 'was', 'initially', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'had', 'doubts', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'reason', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'action', 'star', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'Damon', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'all', 'having', 'good', 'performances', 'what', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'pacing', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'slow', 'parts', 'yet', ""n't"", 'just', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'either', 'very', 'good', 'balance', 'film', 'more', 'action-packed', 'sequences', ""n't"", 'just', 'senseless', 'action', 'sake', 'action', 'purpose', 'main', 'reason', 'simply', 'good', 'story', 'audience', 'entertained', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'storyline', 'happening', 'film', 'get', 'follow', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'character', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'really', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'negative', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'change', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'action', 'sequence', 'film', 'involving', 'Bourne', 'character', 'jumping', 'off', 'staircase', 'shooting', 'someone', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'thing', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'bunch', 'special', 'features', 'reality', 'not', 'lot', 'difference', 'edition', 'regular', 'one', 'few', 'more', 'little', 'featurettes', 'alternate', 'beginning', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'few', 'little', 'other', 'things', 'nothing', 'real', 'special', 'Heck', ""n't"", 'even', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'So', 'already', 'have', 'movie', 'not', 'edition', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'missing', 'much', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'not', 'only', 'action', 'genre', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'see', 'well-paced', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained']",N/A
539890,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00003CXXM,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[1, 1]","Director:  Doug LimanCast:  Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Gabriel Mann, Walton Goggins, Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles.Running Time:  119 minutesRated PG-13 for violence and some language.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a cold blooded assassin, but he doesn't know it. He can kill anyone with just a glance, yet he doesn't even recognize his own name. Left for dead when a hit goes wrong, Jason is rescued from his watery grave in the sea and stitched up by Italian fishermen. Set loose in Europe, Jason tries to put the pieces of his life together (including his rapidly emerging ability to inflict violence when prompted) as it becomes clear that this dangerous and mysterious man is suffering from amnesia. Bourne is helped by Marie (Franka Potente from ""The Princess and the Warrior"" and ""Run Lola Run""), a German woman desperate for cash, who takes Jason out of the dangerous hive of Paris to safety, but soon finds herself in deeper trouble than Bourne. On their tail are two dueling government agents (Brian Cox and Chris Cooper from ""American Beauty"") who would like nothing more than a dead Bourne, and a team of assassins who are sent out to finish the job.The poster for `The Bourne Identity' screams: `Matt Damon Is Jason Bourne.' Honestly, they couldn't be more right. In perhaps his biggest star performance to date, Damon conquers his new film with the authority of a Schwarzenegger, and the sleekness of a Brosnan. His performance is elaborate, moving back and forth from a man who doesn't understand what he's capable of, to a man who uses his capabilities to answer all of his questions. With his natural physicality, Damon can play the role easily. But with his ever-searching actor instincts, Damon finds shades within Jason Bourne to play with; just enough to help elevate the movie into territory Bond stopped trying to reach for three decades ago. Damon's chemistry with Potente is also a treat, as the film never veers too much into romantic territory, but leaves enough room for the heat between the two to seep through. They work very well together.  The real star of the picture is director Doug Liman, formerly of the anemic 1996 comedy ""Swingers"" and the appealing 1999 caper ""Go"". There is nothing in those two films that would suggest that Liman is capable of handling a spy thriller. And that's the beauty of `The Bourne Identity.' It's a story (here based on the best selling series by Robert Ludlum) that's been in play many times before, and Liman takes the challenge head on. Directing with a dazzling flair for tension and action set pieces, Liman conducts his ""Bourne"" very simply and efficiently. There are minimal explosions, no godforsaken quips from the lips of the characters, and the film is one of the fastest paced in recent memory.Liman is helped by fantastic European locations (shot crisply by Oliver Wood), an exhilarating score by John Powell (""Shrek""), and a swift script by Tony Gilroy and W. Blake Herron, but you can easily tell Liman's heart and dedication is really into the story and the characters. His heart is into the action as well, with the film containing many impressive hand-to-hand combat scenes that feel fresh and real, a mid-movie car chase that spells doom for any fingernails in the audience, and a climactic shootout that has Bourne literally riding another bad guy down the middle of a staircase. Wild, unpredictable moments like these are scattered throughout the film, and they make the ride that much more pleasurable. Liman has a clear vision for ""The Bourne Identity"", and his mission is accomplished.",4,The Bourne Identity  (2002),1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3636,"['Director', 'Doug', 'LimanCast', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'Julia', 'Stiles.Running', 'Time', '119', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language.Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'cold', 'blooded', 'assassin', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'kill', 'anyone', 'just', 'glance', 'yet', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'own', 'name', 'Left', 'dead', 'when', 'hit', 'wrong', 'Jason', 'rescued', 'watery', 'grave', 'sea', 'stitched', 'up', 'Italian', 'fishermen', 'Set', 'loose', 'Europe', 'Jason', 'put', 'pieces', 'life', 'together', 'including', 'rapidly', 'emerging', 'ability', 'inflict', 'violence', 'when', 'prompted', 'clear', 'dangerous', 'mysterious', 'man', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'Bourne', 'helped', 'Marie', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Princess', 'Warrior', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'German', 'woman', 'desperate', 'cash', 'who', 'Jason', 'dangerous', 'hive', 'Paris', 'safety', 'soon', 'deeper', 'trouble', 'Bourne', 'tail', 'are', 'two', 'dueling', 'government', 'agents', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'American', 'Beauty', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'more', 'dead', 'Bourne', 'team', 'assassins', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'finish', 'job.The', 'poster', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'screams', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Is', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'right', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'star', 'performance', 'date', 'Damon', 'new', 'film', 'authority', 'Schwarzenegger', 'sleekness', 'Brosnan', 'performance', 'elaborate', 'moving', 'back', 'forth', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'capable', 'man', 'who', 'capabilities', 'answer', 'questions', 'natural', 'physicality', 'Damon', 'can', 'play', 'role', 'easily', 'ever-searching', 'actor', 'instincts', 'Damon', 'shades', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'play', 'just', 'enough', 'help', 'elevate', 'movie', 'territory', 'Bond', 'stopped', 'trying', 'reach', 'three', 'decades', 'ago', 'Damon', 'chemistry', 'Potente', 'also', 'treat', 'film', 'never', 'veers', 'too', 'much', 'romantic', 'territory', 'enough', 'room', 'heat', 'two', 'seep', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'real', 'star', 'picture', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'formerly', 'anemic', '1996', 'comedy', 'Swingers', 'appealing', '1999', 'caper', 'Go', 'nothing', 'two', 'films', 'would', 'suggest', 'Liman', 'capable', 'handling', 'spy', 'thriller', 'beauty', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'story', 'here', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'series', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'been', 'play', 'many', 'times', 'Liman', 'challenge', 'head', 'Directing', 'dazzling', 'flair', 'tension', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'Liman', 'Bourne', 'very', 'simply', 'efficiently', 'are', 'minimal', 'explosions', 'godforsaken', 'quips', 'lips', 'characters', 'film', 'one', 'fastest', 'paced', 'recent', 'memory.Liman', 'helped', 'fantastic', 'European', 'locations', 'shot', 'crisply', 'Oliver', 'Wood', 'exhilarating', 'score', 'John', 'Powell', 'Shrek', 'swift', 'script', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'W.', 'Blake', 'Herron', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'Liman', 'heart', 'dedication', 'really', 'story', 'characters', 'heart', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'containing', 'many', 'impressive', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'scenes', 'feel', 'fresh', 'real', 'mid-movie', 'car', 'chase', 'doom', 'fingernails', 'audience', 'climactic', 'shootout', 'Bourne', 'literally', 'riding', 'bad', 'guy', 'middle', 'staircase', 'Wild', 'unpredictable', 'moments', 'are', 'scattered', 'film', 'make', 'ride', 'much', 'more', 'pleasurable', 'Liman', 'clear', 'vision', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'mission', 'accomplished']",N/A

He's somehow very good at anticipating trouble, and equally proficient at encountering and escaping.  Clues #2 & #3.  Of course, viewers are shown scenes of CIA honchos flustered by Jason's ""loose canon"" status.  Huge Clue #4.  What could Jason be????  The biggest flaw of this ""suspense-thriller"" is that we already know most of the answers within minutes of the opening.  Additionally...and I believe the lack of a soundtrack creates this problem...despite the action, there's not much thrill to this movie.  Assassins come after Jason and his new gal pal, and we pretty safely figure they'll escape them, and most of the bad guys will either die or be knocked out.  So, we're left with an amnesiac who can't figure out what seems obvious to viewers--even though he's got CIA-instilled intelligence instincts!!  He dodges repeated attempts on his life, and winds his way to a safe, open-ended ending that I will not reveal.Bottom line:  The film garners two stars in that there is a uniqueness and a curiosity to the story.

539895,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00003CXXM,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[1, 1]","Movie - 4.0When this movie initially came out, I was very reluctant to see it. I had this weird and stupid bias against Matt Damon for whatever reason I can't even remember now, but that's in the past. Once I got wise, though, my very first viewing of this film (as well as the rest of the trilogy) came in the form of their BD releases. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised, especially for this being the first of three parts in an overall story. The film begins with the discovery of a man in the ocean by a group of fishermen; a man with two bullet holes in his back, a Swiss bank account number in his hip, and no memory of who he is. He can fluently speak foreign languages and is apparently a master in firearms and fisticuffs, but still can't remember his name or how he ended up where he did. In reaching the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport. The name inside: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Also in the box are multiple other passports, all with the same picture, but different names. And so, Bourne embarks on a journey to find out who he really is, meeting a gypsy woman named Marie (Franka Potente), in which they face assassins and conspiracy coverups with only each other to depend on.For me, this movie not only re-defined the spy-thriller genre (James Bond should thank this franchise because I think his recent incarnation was really influenced by it), but it made me a huge fan of Matt Damon. It's a gritty, more realistic, and down-to-earth depiction that relies less on flash and pizazz and tells a very humanistic story. If I were to break it down, I would say the appeal comes from about a third in the writing, a third in the acting, and a third in the score. The writing succeeds a lot in terms of subtlety; it doesn't explain a whole lot, but leaves enough for the audience to understand and empathize Bourne without ever getting ahead of him. This, in turn, is brilliantly performed by Damon who's portrayal is just as subtle as the writing; he's cool, calm, and collected, yet carries a certain degree of violence and ferocity when his training kicks in. And then there's the music; John Powell creates a very engaging score with three particularly crucial elements that, in my opinion, really drive the film: Bourne's main theme (which adds a sense of mystery and intrigue), a lot of percussion pieces (which sound great for action sequences), and the trademark whirring effect (that foreshadows Bourne's time to kick ass). The Bourne Identity is a very well-made spy-thriller that, as director Doug Liman puts it, ""is made with a lot of European sensibilities,"" making this a very refreshing take for the time it was made. Not only does it provide the mystery and action of a spy movie, but the additional cerebral aspect makes it that much more enjoyable. And it only gets better in the sequels.Video - 4.0- Video codec: VC-1- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1The Bourne franchise makes its first entry onto high definition with a pretty good transfer. I say ""pretty good,"" which may seem a bit generous considering a couple of gripes I have with it, but all in all, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. Let's start with the good. General detail and sharpness look great, capturing some excellent scenic shots, revealing a decent amount of line delineation between clothes and objects, and showing some of the finer features on peoples' faces and hair during closeup shots. Colors are vivid, albeit slightly de-saturated, with lots of reds and orange being at the forefront of the spectrum. The red bank bag that Bourne wears around the beginning of the film tends to especially stand out, along with the occasional random red object in the background. The jacket he also wears in the beginning and the one big explosion that the movie has literally explodes orange when it does happen. Skin tones are very lifelike with great variation from person to person and reflect accordingly depending on the lighting of the scene. Black levels aren't super-deep, but do enough to help accentuate the intrigue during darker scenes or nighttime shots. The film also supports a nice, light layer of grain and never gets in the way.The two bad things? Contrast and damage. Contrast is generally a tad on the low side giving the movie a kind of murky look with even daytime shots looking a little on the dim side. The detail is still good enough, but compared to other movies I've seen with low contrast that still manage to have a pristine picture, this one doesn't really hold up. Throughout the course of the movie, there are also various instances of dirt and even one or two moments where scratches from print damage popped up for a split second. They're not terribly obvious, but they are noticeable. In the end, though, Oliver Wood's photography looks great and really helps to maintain a very earthy, yet exotic look to the cityscapes, indoor sets, and wider-viewed shots. My favorite parts to look at are the snowy streets of Zurich for it's variation in color around the city, the shootout at the farmhouse for its detail, and the nighttime shots around the end of the movie for the blacks.Audio - 4.5Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1- French: DTS 5.1- Spanish: DTS 5.1Subtitles- English SDH, French, SpanishWhile the video portion of this disc isn't quite perfect, the audio comes much closer. As I mentioned about the music being an integral part of the film, interestingly enough, the movie opens with the Universal credits, but doesn't play the Universal theme. Instead, it's starts out silent and fades into the sound effects, then into the main title theme of Bourne. General immersion is excellent with the score having a pulse of its own through a lot of the drumming beats and tense string pieces. And then, of course, there's that trademark whirring effect, which when played, really enhances the mood of whatever is acting out on screen. Directionality and separation dominate the sound field when action sequences take precedent, though dialogue thankfully remains clear regardless of how loud a crash, gunshot, or broken window gets.In particular, I was very pleased with how well-isolated the effects were in the scene where Bourne is fending off the first Treadstone assassin. When the guy breaks in, it was completely quiet beforehand, and then all hell broke loose. But even then, when Bourne and Marie are being pursued by the French police, the car chase sequence does a bit of the opposite by having a very lively mix of automotive chaos and snazzy Euro-techno that almost felt like a scene out of The Transporter. I would say this scene utilizes the rear speakers best with some very aggressive effects as some of the cars come buzzing around tight corners and others start crashing into one another. And then towards the end of the film when Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character, we get a great example of the middle road. It's isolated enough like the first assassination attempt when Bourne blows up a tanker providing some real pounding LFEs, but then it also feels very immersive when he fires another shot and the birds in the field start flying around. To sum it up, The Bourne Identity has a great sound design and mix. The actual sound quality has a lot of depth to it, with both the high and low ends displaying great dynamic range. As a whole, it's not quite reference material, but I would liken that more to the nature of the film itself having a lot of quieter moments. But rest assured, though, that the sequels will definitely fix that right up.Extras - 4.5- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)This is a very informative track with a wealth of information that covers a wide variety of aspects from the writing, casting, filming, set designs, editing, scoring; you name it. Essentially, what I found most interesting were the comments Liman had about the heart of the story and its presentation; namely, how he wanted to bring a sense of grit and realism to the spy-thriller genre, making it a drama, first, and an action film, second. He goes into great detail about the depiction of Bourne and how he and Damon collaborated to make the character feel subtle and empathetic, yet strong and determined throughout the circumstances of the story. In fact, Liman really stressed the parallels between the Kali fighting style that Bourne uses and how its core philosophy of energy conservation and quick, brutal efficiency ties into Bourne's overall demeanor. He later goes on to talk about character motivations and how Damon and Potente did particularly good jobs at humanizing the character of Bourne in such a way that, I feel, had a gradual impact on the look and feel of other modern spy-thrillers succeeding this one (here's looking at you, Bond). Oddly enough, there were a few very large dead spots, but for the most part, when Liman talks, he really lets loose.- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)Tells us a little bit about the famed author of the series, Robert Ludlum, namely, things like: how he made the transition from theater actor to novelist, how he tied those theater experiences into his writing, how a lot of the locales he came up with were inspired by post WWII-Europe, how he saw conspiracy in authority, and finally how he came to adopt the trend of 3-word titles for all of his works (""The [whatever] [whatever]"").- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)Talks about the origin of Bourne's name, Ludlum's personality in general and how it was reflected through the character of Bourne, some of the differences between the movie and novel (such as the omission of Carlos the Jackal), how The Bourne Identity boosted his status as an author, and then the eventual progression that was a result from Identity's success.- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)This piece covers a pretty huge chunk of Jason Bourne's story arc between the first and second movie. If you've seen all the films by this point, then it's an excellent breakdown of the character, his motivations, and the themes they wrote into the plot. If by some chance this is your first time seeing Identity, do no watch this feature, as it will contain some major spoilers for Supremacy.- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)Starts with a brief introduction by the 3 guys listed below and mentions how the movie had to be adjusted after the events of 9/11 for the sake of changed sensibilites. They were concerned about the ""datedness"" of the subject material and how it would make audiences react. The alternate opening basically would have turned the whole movie into a flashback and tying up in present day at the end. They say they were pretty happy with the ending you see in the final cut (and so am I).- Introduction with Producer Frank Marshall, Co-Writer Tony Gilroy, and Actor Brian Cox (3:33)- Alternate Opening (2:16)- Alternate Ending (4:56)- Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)Listed below are the individual scenes:- Wombosi on the Private Jet (0:59)- Bourne and Marie by the Side of the Road (2:29)- Psychologist Discusses Bourne (1:46)- Bourne and Marie Practice on Subway (1:42)- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)Liman actually makes a quick reference to this in the commentary. He said this scene was left in the European version of the film, but then went on to say it was cut from the American version for ""timing reasons."" As if 58 seconds really makes that big of a difference in theater showings per day...- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)A pretty generic EPK-style feature that tells you how Bourne is different from your average spy-thrill title. It has very badly-edited interviews that are short and whose sporadic nature doesn't really tell you much at all. I recommend you avoid this if you're looking for actual depth and quality.- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)Mostly recycled information talking about Ludlum's transition from theater to writing. It offers a little more retrospect after the fact, but it's too short and not much more than you can hear about in the other features above.- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)Talks about the essence of Bourne and how the movies had to be adapted for modern times, as opposed to the Cold War mentality they originally had when it started in the '80s.- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)Some interviews with Damon and Potente about the characters they play, how they interpreted their motivations, and the transition they had to make when filming Supremacy. Damon said that Bourne's actions are what he feels develops the character, while Potente praises how non-clich&eacute; her character was and how the chemistry between Bourne and Marie is sporadic throughout the relationship.- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)Talks about the actual medical condition of the amnesia Bourne suffers in the plot. The psychologist basically says that Bourne suffers from Selective Dissociative Amnesia, but retains a Kinesthetic Memory of how to perform all of his trained skills. He also goes on to point out that the presence of Marie's character was a big help in portraying memory recovery.- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)An interview with an officer of the CIA who talks about the overt and covert operations they actually do perform and how accurate the depiction of Bourne and all the training technicalities were.- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)Shows how the choreography was staged with stunt coordinator Nick Powell.- Moby ""Extreme Ways"" Music Video (SD; 3:38)A music video to the ending credits song.- U-ControlThere are 3 different interactive applications you can play along with the film:- Treadstone FilesA kind of gimmicky computerization that simulates certain parts of the movie to feel like you're looking through a high-tech dossier. It shows a bunch of trivial factoids and statistics about the characters, the locations, Treadstone, and all kinds of other information.- Bourne OrientationPiP that plays like Warner Bros.' Maximum Movie Mode where the current scene and an older scene that may or may not contain interviews will split into 2 individual screens of their own and essentially rehash important plot points.- Picture in PictureA true PiP application that opens up a little box in the corner of the screen with additional interviews not seen in the special features. Altogether, it equates to about 25 minutes and is divided into 8 chapters of the scene selection. Some of the material covered includes: the action and how Damon wanted to do his own stunts, filming in Paris, Liman casting Damon as Bourne and what it was like working with him, the relationship between Bourne and Marie, a more in-depth analysis of Marie's character, and a short look at the other Treadstone agents through an interview with Clive Owen. It's a little disappointing there aren't more interviews, but it's pretty well-worth the information.Overall - 4.5For the starter of the bunch, The Bourne Identity is a very entertaining refresher into, what was then, a faltering spy-thriller genre. This Blu-ray disc looks pretty good with only a couple of minor problems, the sound is fantastic considering there's more drama than action, and the special features are very informative. It's a shame Ludlum never got to see this, but the people that knew and vouched for him are pretty happy with the way it turned out. The Bourne franchise has certainly changed the genre (just look at how Daniel Craig's Bond movies have shaped up) and for the better. If you haven't seen this yet, definitely pick it up, then wait to be amazed by its sequels.",5,The Bourne Identity (Blu-ray),1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,15622,"['Movie', '4.0When', 'movie',

No. You have seen many movies of the same sort and yet, this movie is very good of its kind and extremely enjoyable. The movie moves in a fast pace and there is no dull moment. Matt Daemon portrays Jason Bourne - a young man trying to search his identity after being found at sea with nothing but two bullets in his back and a capsule containing bank details in his leg. He is surprised to discover certain &quot;survival&quot; abilities in himself and a lot of hostile reactions - all seem like pieces of a puzzle he has to build up. Jason Bourne starts his long journey to find who he is accompanied by a girl he meets along the way. Although the part could have easily been made up to be a typical &quot;macho&quot; role Matt Daemon is able to convey the confusion of Jason Bourne struggling to find his identity and is both charming and fragile. Franke Potante is adorable with her slight accent and the European scenery is indeed a change and gives the movie a somewhat &quot;refined&quot; and even &quot;sophisticated&quot; touch. The movie is not too violent and the romance between the couple is quite convincing. I fell in love with both of them in the hotel hair cutting scene.

539901,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXXM,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is, in a good sense, a very old-fashioned spy film, and for that same reason it would be hated by many viewers.  A film about an amnesiac person involved into a chain of intrigues and plots is nothing new if you only remember &quot;Long Kiss Good Night&quot;; the difference is, the pace of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is, for modern audience, a little too slow, and except for the presence of character actor Brian Cox, it has nothing in common with Lenny Harlin's ridiculously pumped up action scenes.The story is all too basic.  A guy who lost his memory played by Matt Damon is found on the stormy sea by Italian fishermen, and he seeks for his identity.  On his way through Eupope, he attactes unwelcome guests coming to elinimate him, but with unexpected physical and mental skills he fends off every attack made on him.  So, who is he?  Anyone?This is so easy a question, so don't bother.  The point is, there are actions that might be seen in the spy films made in 1970s or before.  Sure, there are car chases, and surveillance system using computers, but the actions are all, as I said, old-fashioned.  And the fact is we have seen so many explosions and CGIs during the 90s (like &quot;Total Recall&quot; and any action flick you name), so the style of &quot;The Bounre Identity&quot; looks too old and stale.  But folks, originally, spies are supposed to be low-profile, so there's nothing wrong with understated handling of actions.  And the photography captures the atmospher of traditional European sceneries, in town and country.But there are some complaints I have to make, and one is that the film is too, a way too, predictable.  Though Matt Damon is cast well, usually excellent actors like Chris Cooper and Clive Owen are all wasted as the characters that should be given more substance.  They look like desposable villains from episodes of any spy/action TV series, who are nothing but cypher.And the other, and bigger complaint is the way of using female players, especially Franka Potente, &quot;Lola &quot; of &quot;Run Lola Run.&quot;  There is nothing that reminds us of the energetic existence of the red-haired runner, but she is just a secondary role nobody really cares.  This is typical of Hollywood film when they use European actresses -- see &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; for instance -- and there again, they did it.  And if you brink your eyes, you will miss the lovely Julia Stiles (what is she doing here?).As a whole agreeable, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is, however, a kind of spy film that critics love, but not exactly all audiences.  But critics are those professinal people who have seen many older films, and that will explain.",3,"Good or Bad, This Spy Film Is Too Old-Fashioned",1045008000,"02 12, 2003",2003,2714,"['quot', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'quot', 'good', 'sense', 'very', 'old-fashioned', 'spy', 'film', 'same', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'hated', 'many', 'viewers', 'film', 'amnesiac', 'person', 'involved', 'chain', 'intrigues', 'plots', 'nothing', 'new', 'only', 'remember', 'quot', 'Long', 'Kiss', 'Good', 'Night', 'quot', 'difference', 'pace', 'quot', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'quot', 'modern', 'audience', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'presence', 'character', 'actor', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'nothing', 'common', 'Lenny', 'Harlin', 'ridiculously', 'pumped', 'up', 'action', 'scenes.The', 'story', 'too', 'basic', 'guy', 'who', 'lost', 'memory', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'found', 'stormy', 'sea', 'Italian', 'fishermen', 'identity', 'way', 'Eupope', 'unwelcome', 'guests', 'coming', 'elinimate', 'unexpected', 'physical', 'mental', 'skills', 'attack', 'made', 'So', 'who', 'Anyone', 'so', 'easy', 'question', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'point', 'are', 'actions', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'spy', 'films', 'made', '1970s', 'Sure', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'surveillance', 'system', 'using', 'computers', 'actions', 'are', 'all', 'said', 'old-fashioned', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'explosions', 'CGIs', '90s', 'quot', 'Total', 'Recall', 'quot', 'action', 'flick', 'name', 'style', 'quot', 'Bounre', 'Identity', 'quot', 'too', 'old', 'stale', 'folks', 'originally', 'spies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'low-profile', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'understated', 'handling', 'actions', 'photography', 'atmospher', 'traditional', 'European', 'sceneries', 'town', 'country.But', 'are', 'complaints', 'have', 'make', 'one', 'film', 'too', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'cast', 'well', 'usually', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'are', 'all', 'wasted', 'characters', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'more', 'substance', 'look', 'desposable', 'villains', 'episodes', 'spy/action', 'TV', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'nothing', 'cypher.And', 'other', 'bigger', 'complaint', 'way', 'using', 'female', 'players', 'especially', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'quot', 'Lola', 'quot', 'quot', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run.', 'quot', 'nothing', 'energetic', 'existence', 'red-haired', 'runner', 'just', 'secondary', 'role', 'nobody', 'really', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'when', 'use', 'European', 'actresses', 'see', 'quot', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'quot', 'instance', 'there', 'again', 'did', 'brink', 'eyes', 'will', 'miss', 'lovely', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'what', 'doing', 'here', '.As', 'whole', 'agreeable', 'quot', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'quot', 'however', 'kind', 'spy', 'film', 'critics', 'love', 'not', 'exactly', 'audiences', 'critics', 'are', 'professinal', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'older', 'films', 'will', 'explain']",N/A

Besides his name he seems to have forgotten all professional discipline as he spills his guts over what he's discovered so far, all of it indicating he is or was some sort of secret agent on a dangerous mission.  It seems to bother his conscience, an interesting after effect of his accident.Among some papers that a bad guy leaves behind they discover one which conveniently explains the whole plot up to that point (a deus ex machina) which I won't spoil for you.  The rest of the movie involves the CIA, assorted hit men who come after him, at least one really wild gun battle and a big smooch scene.

Matt Damon, who plays Jason Bourne, aka several other names, finds himself unable to remember who he is and at the same time aware that he's got a few 'skills' that seperate him from the rest of normal society.Set on location in Switzerland and France, this well-paced story moves right along. Along with Damon there is Franka Potente who he meets as he attempts to speak with someone at the U.S. embassy in Zurich. Offering her money to drive him to Paris in search of his identity, she accepts with reservations. And so the chase begins. Other agents like Bourne are called into action to find him and a series of chases and assasination attempts ensues.The characters playing these Bourne-like agents aren't really delved into, which is a shame. This also calls to mind the major weakness in the story- the U.S. government controllers who are after him. The role of 'controller' is stereotypically played throughout and it's perhaps the only weakness in the movie.The Bourne Identity isn't great movie-making; what it is is good entertainment.

In many respects, Bourne (Matt Damon)is the anti-Bond; he begins as an assassin but, robbed of his memory and hunted because of an assassination he failed to carry out, Bourne tries to stay alive as other assassins are sent to eliminate him. In the meantime, he tries to discover who he is and why they're trying to kill him. He meets Marie (Franka Potenta from &quot;Run, Lola, Run&quot;)and forces her to drive him to the apartment where he lived. While she's frightened, she's drawn to this mysterious and hurt soul.Director Doug Liman (&quot;Go&quot;) and screenwriters Tony Gilroy (&quot;Proof of Life&quot;, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;) & W. Blake Herron (the forthcoming &quot;Mr. Ripley's Return&quot;) have fashioned a marvelous spy thriller with a number of marvelous set pieces including the infamous carchase with the minis. Visually striking with strong performances by tne entire cast, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is a great way to spent an evening.I wouldn't, however, recommend the re-release unless you haven't purchased the film previously. The alternate opening isn't quite finished and the alternate ending was available on the previous version on DVD. The biggest drawback, though, is the fact that this edition doesn't have an audio commentary track by director Liman. While there are a number of extras (they are highlighted in the amazon.com list of new features) here that are new, this really isn't all that different from the previous version.

The book has rich character development, suspense, plot, and non-stop-action. It's one of those books you will not be able to put down, and you may skip a meal or two to finish it in one sitting, so find a cumfy chair. Two subsequent books: The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum by Robert Ludlum are both good, but not as good as the first. Ludlum books have a style that I enjoy, but I've decided that it's as if they're written to formula, so more than one Ludlum book a year makes them less enjoyable. One Ludlum book a year is very nice to read. The 1988 tv-miniseries version of this movie with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith was OK, but I thought that Bourne lacked the skills portrayed in the book, although he did have some of the brains. The 2002 movie with Matt Damon is just the opposite with Bourne having all of the skills (here's a guy you do not want to meet in a dark alley, or even a crouded policeman's shooting range), but none of the brains. In 2002 the female sidekick shows that no smarts at all is enough to stay alive, whereas in the book anyone without 100% amazing training gets wiped out very fast -- and the need for both honed skill and brains is what gives you the respect for the book Bourne.

This one is exciting, well paced, and very enjoyable.Someone (Bourne) is found floating at sea, with two bullets in his back and a mysterious message surgically implanted. He wakes up with no idea who, where, or even what he is. He has some skills - languages, and more ominous skills that seem to scare even him. And people are trying to kill him.OK, the ""amnesia"" plot has been used until it's almost used up. This is really a chases'n'action film, and needed something to get it started. Once the amnesia premise jump-starts the movie, it moves forward very well by itself. Matt Damon did a good job in the title role, except maybe for being too much of a nice guy for the history that eventually catches up to him.I don't normally pay a lot of attention to DVD extras. This has one nice extra, though: a choice of two start and end scenes. The theater edition was good enough, but the extra version was more interesting. It was also more conducive to sequels.If you want a spy/action flick, try this one out. I don't think it will ever become a classic, but it's still good.//wiredweird",4,Fast-moving and exciting,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1160,"['spy-film', 'business', 'alive', 'well', 'setbacks', 'one', 'exciting', 'well', 'paced', 'very', 'enjoyable.Someone', 'Bourne', 'found', 'floating', 'sea', 'two', 'bullets', 'back', 'mysterious', 'message', 'surgically', 'implanted', 'up', 'idea', 'who', 'where', 'even', 'what', 'skills', 'languages', 'more', 'ominous', 'skills', 'seem', 'scare', 'even', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'him.OK', 'amnesia', 'plot', 'been', 'used', 'almost', 'used', 'up', 'really', 'chases', ""n'action"", 'film', 'needed', 'something', 'get', 'started', 'amnesia', 'premise', 'jump-starts', 'movie', 'forward', 'very', 'well', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'maybe', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'nice', 'guy', 'history', 'eventually', 'up', 'him.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'pay', 'lot', 'attention', 'DVD', 'extras', 'one', 'nice', 'extra', 'choice', 'two', 'start', 'end', 'scenes', 'theater', 'edition', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'extra', 'version', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'conducive', 'sequels.If', 'want', 'spy/action', 'flick', 'try', 'one', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'become', 'classic', 'still', 'good.//wiredweird']",N/A

Damon pulls off a character that is smart but lost, composed but confused, lethal but child like. From the minute the fishermen fished him out of the Mediteranian Sea & finds out he can't recall who he is. Then finding out thru a capsule implanted in his body...only a bank account in Zurich. Once Bourne gets to the Bank of Zurich all hell breaks loose. Franka Potente as Maria, the German gypsie, is very good.
