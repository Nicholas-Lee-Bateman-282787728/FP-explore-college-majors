784832,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0000VAFNQ,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 1]","When the people of today rave about cinematic failures like Twilight, you can't help but wonder, ""What the hell is wrong with you people?"" Why aren't you people watching 'real' vampire films that are actually entertaining, like the Underworld trilogy? You mean to tell me you'd trade awesome characters who are armed to teeth for emo pansies like the Twilight characters? Shame, shame. There were some people (Including moronic critics) who said that the Underworld series is boring, and yet they raved about Twilight. Here's my opinion for why I think the Underworld series is infinitely superior to Twilight in every way.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Centuries ago, a conflict began between aristocratic vampires called Death Dealers and Lycans (Werewolves who can become human again) which still continues into modern societies. We are then introduced to the sexy Death Dealer, Selene who centuries ago was turned into a vampire by the leader of the vampires; Viktor, who raised her like his daughter. And then after an intense gun battle scene, we are introduced to Michael Corvin, who is being hunted by the Lycans over the fact his bloodline goes back to the Corvinus (The father of both vampire and Lycan bloodlines) line, which means he is the only person in existence who can be both a vampire and a Lycan. So when Selene investigates why the Lycans are after Michael, both are pulled into a dangerous adventure full of hidden secrets, forbidden love, and a lot of intense, bloody action scenes. The plot for the most part is good, but it doesn't seem to go as far as it could have.MUSIC: The music in this film is great, and never fails to set the mood and entertain. I have no gripes with this area.ACTION: This film is loaded with many gun and sword fights, which come with many explosions and lots of blood and gore. Any action fan should have no problem enjoying this film because it rocks. You won't find this action in a pansy, emo, sappy, teen drama vampire tale like Twilight! A true splendor of awesome bloody violence.ACTING: Some people said the acting and dialogue in this film is bad. What bad acting and dialogue? These actors are great, unlike the 1-dimensional, cardboard actors of Twilight. Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and pulls of her role as a vampire action heroine very well. I have no gripes with the other actors either, as they perform their roles superbly as well.OVERALL: Forget cinematic monstrosities like Twilight which are an insult to vampire films, and watch Underworld instead! This is an awesome action epic that both girls and guys alike can get into. If you're an action fan or a fan of 'real' vampire films and you're tired of the stupid Twilight craze, pick this one (Along with the other two) up as well.THE GOOD: Lots of bloody mayhem, great acting, great music, and a fairly good plot.THE BAD: Plot doesn't go as far as it could have.",5,AN ENTHRALLING VAMPIRE EPIC  9 OUT OF 10,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,2879,"['When', 'people', 'today', 'rave', 'cinematic', 'failures', 'Twilight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'What', 'hell', 'wrong', 'people', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'people', 'watching', ""'real"", 'vampire', 'films', 'are', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'Underworld', 'trilogy', 'mean', 'tell', ""'d"", 'trade', 'awesome', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'armed', 'teeth', 'emo', 'pansies', 'Twilight', 'characters', 'Shame', 'shame', 'were', 'people', 'Including', 'moronic', 'critics', 'who', 'said', 'Underworld', 'series', 'boring', 'yet', 'raved', 'about', 'Twilight', 'Here', 'opinion', 'why', 'think', 'Underworld', 'series', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'Twilight', 'way.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Centuries', 'ago', 'conflict', 'began', 'aristocratic', 'vampires', 'called', 'Death', 'Dealers', 'Lycans', 'Werewolves', 'who', 'can', 'become', 'human', 'again', 'still', 'modern', 'societies', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'sexy', 'Death', 'Dealer', 'Selene', 'who', 'ago', 'was', 'turned', 'vampire', 'leader', 'vampires', 'Viktor', 'who', 'raised', 'daughter', 'then', 'intense', 'gun', 'battle', 'scene', 'are', 'introduced', 'Michael', 'Corvin', 'who', 'being', 'hunted', 'Lycans', 'fact', 'bloodline', 'back', 'Corvinus', 'father', 'vampire', 'Lycan', 'bloodlines', 'line', 'only', 'person', 'existence', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'vampire', 'Lycan', 'So', 'when', 'Selene', 'why', 'Lycans', 'are', 'Michael', 'are', 'pulled', 'dangerous', 'adventure', 'full', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'forbidden', 'love', 'lot', 'intense', 'bloody', 'action', 'scenes', 'plot', 'most', 'part', 'good', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'have.MUSIC', 'music', 'film', 'great', 'never', 'fails', 'set', 'mood', 'entertain', 'have', 'gripes', 'area.ACTION', 'film', 'loaded', 'many', 'gun', 'sword', 'fights', 'come', 'many', 'explosions', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'action', 'fan', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'enjoying', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'action', 'pansy', 'emo', 'sappy', 'teen', 'drama', 'vampire', 'tale', 'Twilight', 'A', 'true', 'splendor', 'awesome', 'bloody', 'violence.ACTING', 'people', 'said', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'film', 'bad', 'What', 'bad', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'are', 'great', '1-dimensional', 'cardboard', 'actors', 'Twilight', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'great', 'actress', 'pulls', 'role', 'vampire', 'action', 'heroine', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'gripes', 'other', 'actors', 'either', 'perform', 'roles', 'superbly', 'well.OVERALL', 'Forget', 'cinematic', 'monstrosities', 'Twilight', 'are', 'insult', 'vampire', 'films', 'watch', 'Underworld', 'instead', 'awesome', 'action', 'epic', 'girls', 'guys', 'alike', 'can', 'get', ""'re"", 'action', 'fan', 'fan', ""'real"", 'vampire', 'films', ""'re"", 'tired', 'stupid', 'Twilight', 'craze', 'pick', 'one', 'other', 'two', 'up', 'well.THE', 'GOOD', 'Lots', 'bloody', 'mayhem', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'music', 'fairly', 'good', 'plot.THE', 'BAD', 'Plot', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'have']",N/A

Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF""","[3, 10]","Yet another addition to the ever-expanding library of films that serve generous heapings of steaming visuals but with little or no seasoning such as, oh, plot, excitement, suspense, character, or heaven forbid, depth.The premise is actually interesting: Vampire and Werewolves are not friendly with each other.  This movie suggests that it's a conflict dating back centuries.  Okay, I'm willing to buy that, as long as the dialogue and characters aren't culled from a horror-genre parts bin.  Give me something hand made!Selene is a vampire, trained to hunt and kill the lycans (werewolves, why not just call them that?).  Then one day she hunts down a lycan she happens to fall in love with.  Ah, is that a wiff of Romeo and Juliet I smell?  No.  Nothing of interest happens there; they talk about a lot of stuff, none of it very exciting.  There are some people in long, flowing leather jackets waking through double-doors over and over and over again in slow-mo.  Whoa!  Then there's some Matrix-esque stuff that doesn't resemble the Matrix.  In the end, she kills the head lycan dude, just like in a video game, by cutting him in half with a ninja sword, he takes forever to actually sever in half and die, and the whole Women's Liberation movement takes one step backwards as Kate Beckinsale tries to look murderous.It's a pity we've reached a point where our &quot;subculture genre&quot; is becoming infused with mainstream trappings.  I suppose it's analogous to Metallica's &quot;Black Album,&quot; but really it's more to do with the marketing to youngsters who imagine themselves on the fringes of &quot;the norm&quot; as we used to call it and dress like they're different and shunned.

784835,A39J0B2XU8LH9T,B0000VAFNQ,AKO-1Critic4U,"[1, 5]","First, let me say the ""UNDERWORLD"" is a contemporarry film for the times we live in. Our world literally falls into the dubious camp of Lycan or Vampyre. It just depends on how you view yourself.Having just completed reading the novelization of ""UNDERWORLD"", I can truthfully say that it surpasses the movie version par excellence revealing the holes in the script and directing.It is not enough to display the fact that history repeats itself time and time again in this film but more important the real interactions between lead actor Scott Speedman and lead actress Kate Beckinsale which came across in the film like a polite Japanese bowing ceremony. It was atrocious to say the least.I thought the meaning of going to the theatre was sadly to be entertained at the very best. Was'nt there supposed to be passionate kissing and heart-rending embraces plus holding of hands or a head snuggling against a shoulder? Could it be that the dirctor Len Wiseman wanted Kate Beckinsale all to himself and that alone prevented a good movie from being a fine art film.The allure of this movie ranged from the brilliant choreography, the fast paced action and excellent dialogue. Guns blazing in tune with the riveting story only brings the point home. The titanic fight scene between Viktor and Michael could have been more dramatic like the novel or the ""Matrix"".Will there be a UNDERWORLD2?

Vampires Vs Werewolves! Yes the first reaction when seeing the preview was ""ok this will be a matrix clone in vision"" but still sparked my interest. Then after seeing the movie and after the huge disappointment with the Matrix Reloaded this movie was for me what the Matrix sequel should have been. From the very start of the movie you are sucked in the world and war of the Vampires and Lycans. Those who are not into such need not apply as this is a movie for fans who crave this type of story line. What was really great about this movie is the set up that is obvious of the huge back story that they will be able to elaborate on come the sequel. I do believe that this movie will have a HUGE cult following on DVD and the follow-up will be a fantastic success hopefully spawning more stories of the characters developed in this 1st installment. If you are a fan of Vampires and Werewolves you will be very happy with the final turn out of Underworld. Everyone in the movie plays their parts as they should. The look, sound and over all feeling are well played out and a great treat to fans of this sort of genre. Worth the purchase and you will be craving more afterwards.***On the techincal note for HDTV owners and Surround Sound systems.Both the picture and the sound get a BIG 5 out of 5.All the blacks are deep and rich. The sharpness and over all picture is fantastic for us HDTV owners.Sound wise even though no DTS track is offered the Dolby 5.1 mix offered is pushed to the max and will make your system thunder.

784841,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B0000VAFNQ,Amazon Customer,"[8, 14]","I've been racking my brains trying to think of something positive to say about ""Underworld"", and I can think of three. Kate Beckinsale looks good in black latex, Scott Speedman has an air of vulnerability that suits his part, and there's an interesting story reversal at the end where we become less sure who the good guys are. That's it. And it's not enough to justify the cost of a DVD or a ticket.The whole thing is just so derivative, mostly of ""The Matrix"" trilogy but also to a certain extent of the ""Blade"" movies. But it doesn't have the moments of flair that either of them have. It uses some of the characters from horror films, but it's not a horror film at all. After all, in horror films we identify usually with the human victims. Here the fact that vampires and werewolves kill humans is barely even mentioned. In fact there's not much point to them being vampires or werewolves given that their main weapons in the war against one another are good old fashioned guns and - ultimately - fist fights.The basic premise of ""Underworld"" is that for centuries a war has been raging between vampires and werewolves, known in this movies as lycans because they don't have to wait for the full moon to change form, and they can run on walls and ceilings like the creatures in ""Alien"", another movie that this one shamelessly rips off.As the movie opens one of the vampires Selene (Kate Beckinsale) realises that the lycans seem to have an interest in one human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), that seems to go beyond the next dinner engagement. The lycans want his blood, because they have a cunning genetic plan. Rescuing Michael, Selene falls in love with him, although we have absolutely no idea why or when this happens. We only realise it because people keep saying so.As the initially bewildered Michael, Speedman is one of the best casting choices. Regular television viewers may recognise him from ""Felicity"" as the eponymous heroine's long time boyfriend, and his more sympathetic side he's a good departure from the usual guys we find in this kind of movie.The current leader of the vampires is a creep called Kraven (Shane Brolly). The name alone tells you he can't be trusted. He allegedly killed the lycan leader Lucian (Michael Sheen) many years ago. He didn't of course. He's actually in cahoots with him. Finding herself not getting the support from her leader that she needs Selene awakens the creature that made her a vampire, one of the vampire elders Viktor (Bill Nighy). The scene is set for an all out war.On the basis of this movie, director Len Wiseman seems to have no idea of pacing and no idea of how to make characters sympathetic. No-one cares who lives or dies. Lacking that foundation it doesn't really matter what's happening on the screen. Things might be moving fast, but all you can do is wait for the end to come. Some reviewers have been impressed by ""Underworld's"" visual style, which mostly consists of making everything very dark and very blue. Hard to believe that cinematographer Tony Pierce Roberts also shot Merchant Ivory's `Room With a View"".In terms of special effects, the werewolf transformations, which are achieved in a digital cartoon-like style, are a little strange and rough edged.

I was pleasantly surprized by the film.  I'm glad I finally saw it.THE CONS---------Both the vampires and lycans seemed too human and not power enough.  The vampires don't seem to be able to fly or move very quickly or see in the dark.  The lycans seem to be more dangerous as humans than as wolves.  Both seem to need guns and special bullets to get by.Neither genre seemed to carry the usual atmosphere.  Vampires are usually erotic while werewolves are usually portrayed as chaotic.The film has so many twists and turns that in the end I didn't really care who lived and who died (except I did care about the human).PROS----The dark sinister atmosphere of the photography is downright creepy.I quickly stopped viewing this as a horror film and began seeing it as a &quot;who done it&quot;.

Underworld and Underworld Evolution move the story further in time while the third movie tells the history of how we got here.The story is about two races of beings, the upper class Vampires and the worker class Werewolves. In the old times, the races lived together in harmony, now they are at war. This story focuses on ""a human"" who we later learn has characteristics of both races and his blood is valuable to both races. Of course, our lead character (Kate Beckinsale) needs the help of a sleeping vampire lord. A very impressive movie with stunning visual look.

The film has a distinctly European feel, not only in the locations, but also direction but moves at a good pace, keeping the viewer awake and for the most part enthralled. A little heavy on the Matrix style fight sequences, with the usual ammunition flying in all directions, it is however, more than a reworked vampire tale of good vs evil, or eveil vs evil (whichever you take) - with a reasonably original storyline in what one has to say, is a highly competetive, and previously visited genre. Without giving too much away, the art direction is gothic but modern and the new Sfx meets old world macabre well, even if there aren't too many suprises along the way. A major plus is the non cliched and well defined beginning middle and end, and the very well handled &quot;human touch&quot; portrayed by the main characters in their fantasy roles.

Even both of the Vampires movies had attractive characters even if only a few.  But the makers of this film make it their primary focus.The acting is for the most part cheesy or bad, the actors are good looking, the plot has truck sized holes, and the it all has a slick and stylized look.But I am not saying that it is bad, it is a fun action flick.It is all based off an age old war between the werewolves and the vampires.  Years ago the werewolves were slaves to the vampires, but by their legends they broke free and a war started.  Now they are both out for the extinction of their enemy.  The Lycans(werewolves), are losing the war, the werewolves are getting desperate because they know they are losing and face being wiped out by their former masters.  so they are looking for a solution in the form of an individual, the decendent of some special individual.  Kate Beckinsale is a vampire assasin(death dealer), who is caught up in the political machinations of her family.The movie has some good if improbable action sequences.  I often wondered how many bullets her gun was capable of holding.  The costumes and the sets were spectacular.  The characters were pretty and looked the roles that they were assigned.The bad was primarily the acting.  A few of the actors were flat out terrible.  Beckinsale looks right for the role, but that is where it ends.  She seems unenthusiastic in her delivery, making her character wooden.  The plot might make sense to hardcore sci fi fans or gamers, but a lot is left either poorly explained or not explained at all.  I remember there being a lot of debate over it on the message boards.Three stars for the production quality but lopsided final project.

It's kind of like the endless barrage of `Resident Evil' movies out there right now.  Like, why are these still being made?  The first film in each series was decent enough and yet not good enough to even warrant a sequel, let alone a third, fourth, whatever number they are on now.  Really, the fact that these movies are making money (are they?) is confusing to me.But that's somewhat beside the point.`Underworld' is an intriguing (sort of) concept that pits vampires against werewolves in a sort of mafia meets Victorian England setting where they scour the subways and kill each other.  Basically there is a war between the two, a war that has been going on for centuries.  These two species couldn't be more different (or more clich&eacute;d) and so we can see why they don't get along.  The Lycans (werewolves) are interested in a med student named Michael Corvin, and so obviously he becomes the interest of the Vampires as well, especially Selene.Here's the thing; `Underworld' can verge on boring in parts and cheesy in the rest of them.  While Beckinsale looks amazing in a skin tight leather jumpsuit, and the scene where she shoots out the floor is pretty awesome, the action scenes are not that impressive, the CGI can lean towards campy and the chemistry between the two leads couldn't be staler.  The film is dressed up rather nicely, with some really nice production and costume design (Les Wiseman knows his way around a set, that's for sure) but the start to finish production is just off to me.  I walked out of the theater shrugging my shoulders and wishing that I had seen something else.Style over substance is a real issue here, but sadly the style isn't exciting enough to make up for the lack of real story development.",2,Why is this `a thing'?,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,1801,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'baffled', 'series', 'still', 'going', 'kind', 'endless', 'barrage', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'movies', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'yet', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'even', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'let', 'alone', 'third', 'fourth', 'number', 'are', 'now', 'Really', 'fact', 'movies', 'are', 'making', 'money', 'are', 'confusing', 'me.But', 'somewhat', 'beside', 'point.', 'Underworld', 'intriguing', 'sort', 'concept', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'sort', 'mafia', 'meets', 'Victorian', 'England', 'setting', 'where', 'scour', 'subways', 'kill', 'other', 'Basically', 'war', 'two', 'war', 'been', 'going', 'centuries', 'two', 'species', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Lycans', 'werewolves', 'are', 'interested', 'med', 'student', 'named', 'Michael', 'Corvin', 'so', 'obviously', 'interest', 'Vampires', 'well', 'especially', 'Selene.Here', 'thing', 'can', 'verge', 'boring', 'parts', 'cheesy', 'rest', 'Beckinsale', 'amazing', 'skin', 'tight', 'leather', 'jumpsuit', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'floor', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'can', 'lean', 'towards', 'campy', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'staler', 'film', 'dressed', 'up', 'rather', 'nicely', 'really', 'nice', 'production', 'costume', 'design', 'Les', 'Wiseman', 'way', 'set', 'sure', 'start', 'finish', 'production', 'just', 'walked', 'theater', 'shrugging', 'shoulders', 'wishing', 'had', 'seen', 'something', 'else.Style', 'substance', 'real', 'issue', 'here', 'sadly', 'style', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'real', 'story', 'development']",N/A

It is definitely not the best effort that could have been made either, but in the end, all's well that ends bloody.In true line with the gothic film vein, this one is set in a nameless city, where it seems like the rain never stops.  Seriously, if it's not raining, it looks like it just finished (London perhaps?).  Nice setting to an interesting film.  The backstory, different as it sounds, is nicely creative.  Vampires have been battling werewolves (Lycans) for the better part of the past 1400 years.  What happens to that stalemate when one of each race begin a romance?  It's not quite that simple, actually.What could have been an interesting take on the Romeo and Juliet syndrome turns into a tale of slaughter and deep-seated hatreds, new species, and downright bloody action.  Not necessarily a bad idea, though, but it had potential for so much more.  Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman portray their parts quite nicely, though, decent acting all around.  The writing was surprisingly good, though not great, but certainly keeping it out of the basement otherwise known as the B-movie category.  The plot twists and turns many a time in this tale, keeping you on your toes and bringing in new elements every step of the way.  In the end, you know what's going to happen most likely, it's how you get there that makes it worthwhile.Overall, sure I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars.  It's never really boring, the acting and writing were not bad at all, and the cinematography was well done, too.  Really, nothing to complain about, except maybe the lack of that big punch or shot of adrenaline that would have really made this movie a huge hit.",4,"Not the best, but worth the watch",1080086400,"03 24, 2004",2004,1744,"['Underworld', 'definintely', 'dark', 'definitely', 'vampire', 'vs.', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'definitely', 'gothic', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'effort', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'end', 'well', 'bloody.In', 'true', 'line', 'gothic', 'film', 'vein', 'one', 'set', 'nameless', 'city', 'where', 'rain', 'never', 'Seriously', 'not', 'raining', 'just', 'finished', 'London', 'perhaps', 'Nice', 'setting', 'interesting', 'film', 'backstory', 'different', 'nicely', 'creative', 'Vampires', 'have', 'been', 'battling', 'werewolves', 'Lycans', 'better', 'part', 'past', '1400', 'years', 'What', 'stalemate', 'when', 'one', 'race', 'begin', 'romance', 'not', 'quite', 'simple', 'actually.What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'take', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'syndrome', 'tale', 'slaughter', 'deep-seated', 'hatreds', 'new', 'species', 'downright', 'bloody', 'action', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'idea', 'had', 'potential', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'portray', 'parts', 'quite', 'nicely', 'decent', 'acting', 'around', 'writing', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'keeping', 'basement', 'otherwise', 'known', 'B-movie', 'category', 'plot', 'twists', 'many', 'time', 'tale', 'keeping', 'toes', 'bringing', 'new', 'elements', 'step', 'way', 'end', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'most', 'likely', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'worthwhile.Overall', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'give', '4', '5', 'stars', 'never', 'really', 'boring', 'acting', 'writing', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'cinematography', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'Really', 'nothing', 'complain', 'maybe', 'lack', 'big', 'punch', 'shot', 'adrenaline', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'huge', 'hit']",N/A

784856,A22STM4RYG2QCC,B0000VAFNQ,Anthony L.,"[0, 0]","Underworld, while rooted in an eternal strife between vampires and lycanthropes - something that in itself is more rooted in roleplaying games that actual history, is a film with Shakespearean and Copollan themes. At the heart of the story is a Montague versus Capulet rivalry so old that the original cause has been forgotten by all but a few. This is where the Romeo and Juliet influences cease. Underworld, as the title suggests, is mostly symbollic of the criminal underworld of organized crime. There is tradition, hierarchy, turf, consolidations of power, and treaties between enemies.Kate Beckinsale is a death dealer, a play on vampire hunters, but with a twist: she hunts werewolves. Following the ganster themes in the film, Beckinsale is a soldier for her family. Beckinsale's performance is mostly soulless, but so is that of the rest of the cast. This is perhaps where Underworld remains faithful to our established perception of vampires and werewolves. The lycanthropes are passionate and tempermental, and are savage in the way they fight and kill. Contrast this to the vampires who are cool, aloof, distance... a bit dull.I don't believe that this is the result of bad acting on the part of the vampire cast - even if there are a couple of actors who don't shine particularly bright. The existential treatment given to vampire personalities has been established in earlier vampire franchises, namely The Hunger and Kindred: The Embraced. Vampires in Underworld have a kind of royal tradition, so making the nobles somewhat reminiscent of the Windsors helps the film.What I enjoy about Underworld is the fast paced action and that aforementioned blend of vampire and mobster movies. I anticipated combat involving tooth and nail, literally; and I was pleasantly surprised at the deeply involved (and exciting) gun fights. The pressures put upon Beckinsale and others because of tradition and habit are the kind that are found in Scorsese and Coppola crime dramas. Make no mistake however, you won't be seeing a revised Godfather or Goodfellas. set to a hypergothic vampiric themes. Rather, what you will get is a vampire film that takes itself seriously and strives for originality. Whether it achives orginality however, is up to the viewer.I remember and loved Frank Langella's Dracula back when it was a new movie. So, I have my own expectations about vampire films in general. I still found much to enjoy in this movie. If Underworld represents a new generation of vampire films along with Blade, then I am very excited for the future of the genre.I'm giving Underworld a four-star rating for the quality of the DVD, its extras, as well as the quality audio production done in the film. I also enjoyed the visual work of the film. Underworld is a darker movie, certainly darker than Copolla's Dracula in terms of color and light. The film's colors are muted, making the film more dramatic. As a side note, those interested in seeing how color and light add tension to a film should see Mamoru Oshii's landmark film, Avalon. The only complaint I have for Underworld is the less-than-convincing CG work done on transformed werewolves. It's still better than what the previous decade of horror films brought, though I don't feel it stands up to An American Werewolf in London, and I certainly don't feel it measures up in the age dominated by films like The Lord of the Rings and the new Star Wars prequals.",4,A genre-blending film that adds to the vampire theme,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,3424,"['Underworld', 'rooted', 'eternal', 'strife', 'vampires', 'lycanthropes', 'something', 'more', 'rooted', 'roleplaying', 'games', 'actual', 'history', 'film', 'Shakespearean', 'Copollan', 'themes', 'heart', 'story', 'Montague', 'versus', 'Capulet', 'rivalry', 'so', 'old', 'original', 'cause', 'been', 'forgotten', 'few', 'where', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'influences', 'cease', 'Underworld', 'title', 'mostly', 'symbollic', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'organized', 'crime', 'tradition', 'hierarchy', 'turf', 'consolidations', 'power', 'treaties', 'enemies.Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'death', 'dealer', 'play', 'vampire', 'hunters', 'twist', 'werewolves', 'Following', 'ganster', 'themes', 'film', 'Beckinsale', 'soldier', 'family', 'Beckinsale', 'performance', 'mostly', 'soulless', 'so', 'rest', 'cast', 'perhaps', 'where', 'Underworld', 'faithful', 'established', 'perception', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'lycanthropes', 'are', 'passionate', 'tempermental', 'are', 'savage', 'way', 'fight', 'kill', 'Contrast', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', 'cool', 'aloof', 'distance', 'bit', 'dull.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'result', 'bad', 'acting', 'part', 'vampire', 'cast', 'even', 'are', 'couple', 'actors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'shine', 'particularly', 'bright', 'existential', 'treatment', 'given', 'vampire', 'personalities', 'been', 'established', 'earlier', 'vampire', 'franchises', 'namely', 'Hunger', 'Kindred', 'Embraced', 'Vampires', 'Underworld', 'have', 'kind', 'royal', 'tradition', 'making', 'nobles', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Windsors', 'film.What', 'enjoy', 'Underworld', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'aforementioned', 'blend', 'vampire', 'mobster', 'movies', 'anticipated', 'combat', 'involving', 'tooth', 'nail', 'literally', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'deeply', 'involved', 'exciting', 'gun', 'fights', 'pressures', 'put', 'Beckinsale', 'others', 'tradition', 'habit', 'are', 'kind', 'are', 'found', 'Scorsese', 'Coppola', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Make', 'mistake', 'however', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'revised', 'Godfather', 'Goodfellas', 'set', 'hypergothic', 'vampiric', 'themes', 'Rather', 'what', 'will', 'get', 'vampire', 'film', 'seriously', 'strives', 'originality', 'orginality', 'however', 'viewer.I', 'remember', 'loved', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Dracula', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'movie', 'So', 'have', 'own', 'expectations', 'vampire', 'films', 'general', 'still', 'found', 'much', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Underworld', 'new', 'generation', 'vampire', 'films', 'Blade', 'then', 'am', 'very', 'excited', 'future', 'genre.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'Underworld', 'four-star', 'rating', 'quality', 'DVD', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'quality', 'audio', 'production', 'done', 'film', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'visual', 'work', 'film', 'Underworld', 'darker', 'movie', 'certainly', 'darker', 'Copolla', 'Dracula', 'terms', 'color', 'light', 'film', 'colors', 'are', 'muted', 'making', 'film', 'more', 'dramatic', 'side', 'note', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'color', 'light', 'add', 'tension', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'Mamoru', 'Oshii', 'landmark', 'film', 'Avalon', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'Underworld', 'less-than-convincing', 'CG', 'work', 'done', 'transformed', 'werewolves', 'still', 'better', 'what', 'previous', 'decade', 'horror', 'films', 'brought', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'up', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'up', 'age', 'dominated', 'films', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'new', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequals']",N/A

This film doesn't have the scares of other films that include either a vampire or a werewolf or both. It is without any kind of apology a dark, gothic action film.Underworld's story owes alot to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and White Wolf Gaming's Werewolf: Rage and Vampire the Masquerade. Any fans of those two pen-and-paper urban gothic role-playing game would see alot of similarities in Wiseman's film. The film starts off pretty quickly and doesn't really let up until the final scene. There are a few scenes sprinkled throughout the film to let the viewer catch its breath. These scenes would be just as good as the action sequences if not for the scenery-chewing of Shane Brolly's Kraven. Looking like a stereotypical Euro-trash vampire, Brolly's Kraven doesn't know the meaning of understated acting. Some have mentioned that Bill Nighy's vampire elder Viktor does the same, but I thought Nighy's performance was very convincing and very in-character.The person who really holds the film together was Kate Beckinsale. Who knew that she could be convincing as an action-heroine. Her petite form and soft-spoken demeanor actually gives her ass-kicking character some sex-appeal and both fuses well together. It didn't hurt that she pretty much spent almost the entire lenght of the film in some outfit that was all black, and either leather or latex or a combination of both. Ms. Beckinsale is both hot and dangerous in this film.The action sequences owes alot of The Matrix and the other imitators that showed up after the release of that film. Unlike, most Matrix imitators, Underworld doesn't overuse the slo-mo, 360-degree shots that the Wachowski Brothers' film made popular. The FX work for the werewolf change is done well, but sometimes when the Were's arrive on the scene in large groups it still has a certain artificial look to them. But overall, the film's FX work was good enough to avoid scrutiny.Len Wiseman has already announced that Underworld 2 will be made once everyone involved in the first film get their schedules straightened out. The ending of this film really needs a sequel to continue the story that really just started with this film.

Okay, bad enough, really but I still had an open mind, even though I knew of NO ONE who gave it a good review. Well, tut to them, I would see it anyway though it was against my better judgement. Really, I had to work up the courage to watch this one. Blatantly, it was a waste of courage. I should have listened to my inner monolgoue and gone with my gut. This movie STINKS. There was no dialogue. You could easily go ten minutes without a single word being spoken which was fine considering the caliber of the actors, but when they *did* finally speak, it was completely predictable. I had delivered the line on the couch 30 seconds before it was spoken on screen. That is not a good sign, my friends. The costumes were nice but very overdone; yes, even clothing can become cliche and worn out. Can you say Matrix? I knew you could. Same for the special effects, the feel, the darkness of the movie, the character types, the cinematography... heck, *everything*. Oh yeah, but cleverly the writers added the extra depth and dimension of... Vampires and Werewolves! ...Waitaminnut. Thay had those in Matrix, too! So never mind, nothing original in here at all, not one iota. Except maybe for that STUPIDEST of stupid invention lovingly monickered 'sunshine bullets'. The heck?? The poster/money shot wasn't even cool. The female vampire drowned... DROWNED! Vamps don't even BREATHE, for crying out loud! They reflect, too. I could have handled reflections, actually, but the drowning part? NO. Guess they have souls and are not undead in this movie which, I thought, was the very definition of a vampire. Silly me. And for heaven's sake, don't look for anything but wooden performances from the lead actors. The vampie lead chick was uninspiring. The lead werewolf -Romeo, I guess- was unlikable, static, and did not nurture any kind of response from me other than boredom. Ho hum. There are a couple of points that were not so bad. One, the old vampire dude. He was kinda cool. Two, the silver injection for werewolves. Not bad. The only thing that keeps this from getting one star is the fact the editing wasn't bad. The rest, however, is old and tired and stinky...

If you don't know what an RPG is, it's a role-playing game like Dungeons and Dragons.  The whole plot, the setting, the characters and the way they interact with each other are lifted from the rule books.Is this a bad thing?  No, not really.  It's a good story, though a bit contrived.  But there aren't many good vampire movies being made these days.  Blade was okay, but after the vampire club scene at the beginning, the rest of the movie was anticlimactic.  Bram Stoker's Dracula was a joke with Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves competing for the worst fake British accent oscar.  Dusk 'till Dawn was fun, but not great.  I think the last really good vampire movie was Dracula, the one from the late 70's with Frank Langella and Lawrence Olivier.  That's not a lot of good vampire movies in the last 25 years.This movie was a solidly good one from an action movie standpoint.  The weakest point was the love story between Kate Beckinsale's character and a newly created werewolf, one that was sort of the werewolf version of Neo in the Matrix or Paul Atreidies of Dune.  There really wasn't much of a spark between them.  I understand Kate's character being portrayed as cold and distant early on in the film, but she never really warmed up later to her so-called ""love interest"".I enjoyed the action and definitely enjoyed Kate Beckinsale running around in tight black Matrix-esqe fetish gear (sorry, I did).  Her repeated entrance through the front door of the vampire's mansion became rather repetitive, and it's use to show off all the pretty goth vampires hanging around being terribly decadent got a bit boring.

And even that showing of power was ""weak"" for lack of a better term.The lycans, on the other hand, were awesome!!!  Being a huge fan of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, series I often sided with the vamps and looked down on the whining, wimpy lycans but I definitely was cheering the lycans on in this movie.  Their leader, Lucien, was definitely running things and as his story was revealed, we learned that underneath all the fangs and fur was a real romantic.

Now the wolves are stalking humans, in search of...something.The trailer for this looked amazing.  Even the film itself looked great.  The lighting, the design, the actors and their clothes are all gorgeous.  There's just no substance beneath it all.  The characters are flat and there is not nearly enough story to fill out the two hour running time.  Some of the acting is quite poor as well; Shane Brolly, who plays the current vampire lord, is particularly bad.  I would have liked to have seen more of Sophia Myles as his hopeful first lady.  Not only did she seem competent, but it would have added a much-needed subplot.What there was of a story didn't make sense to me, although I can't say why without giving away what happens later in the film.UNDERWORLD is less a horror film (it isn't ever scary) than a stylish action movie in horror dressing.  People are executing incredible acrobatic displays all over the place and bullets are constantly flying.  It is as if John Woo had decided to shift into the supernatural genre.  Nor is it a ""Romeo & Juliet"" story.  If there is any romance, it involves a triangle among three of the vampires, but it is left by the wayside.

The feel and visuals were excellent and consistant through the film.What I did not like was the way it was all put together.  Many of the scenes were filmed from odd angles, and the editing tended to be crude, wasting a lot of time between scenes, where a shorter edit, while not removing anything, would move the picture along a little faster.In viewing the attached specials, it becomes clear why this is so.  the creators have a wonderful vision and know what they want to show us, but this is a young crew.  Even their experienced cinematographer has never worked on a movie of this type.  The result is that their vision is hampered by a lack of experience.

Traditionally, vampires would tear the werewolves apart with their bare hands!  This probably did not work with the idea in the movie that the number of werewolves was dwindling, as they would have to outnumber the vampires something like 3 to 1 to even be considered a threat.Anyways, like I said, too many gunfights.  I desired far more hand to hand combat, a la ""Blade"", but if there's going to be so many gunfights they could have made them at least a bit more acrobatic, as opposed to the characters just standing in place and firing their weapons at each other.The one redeeming grace in this movie is the visuals.  The moody shades of blue and grey, the Lycan transformations, and the gothic costumes worn by the vampires all help to establish the dark feeling of war between two supernatural races.

I absolutely loved it and just had to get the extended edition, which adds much to the originally wonderful movie.This vampire/werewolf horror story just oozes with unique twists, spectacular action, awesome environments, and mostly great acting.Beckinsale, as Selene, looked terrific, acted terrific, and really made the movie what it was. She played her action scenes well and made it look like she was an veteran action heroine.She played her parts with plenty of eye candy, flair, and grace to spare. A truly awesome performance on her part.Her love interest, Scott Speedman, was also great and he generated a great deal of believable emotion and reality in his transformation parts and his 'what the f is going on' parts.Likewise, the main 'bad guy' Lucian was casted and played superbly. The twists with his story and character are what really made this movie much more than your cliched horror film. The fact that this movie had an intricate history and actual plot behind its characters made you side with its actors that much more. I loved Lucian at the start when he was a 'bad guy' and i loved him even more at the end when he became a 'tragic hero' in his own little way. And the ending, with its slow silent face to face shot and fitting background music, really hit the mark. There were so many words spoken and emotions put out in that awesome wordless exchange.From its great plot that was ever surprising, to its beautiful settings, scenary, and gothic environments, and to the vicious, growling, and awesome looking werewolves, this was a fun movie to watch.Underworld did not become a sleeper success and best selling dvd for no reason.

As I LOVE vampire movies, this sounded so promising...a sexy, high-style love story between a vampire girl and werewolve boy. Well, the PR people deserve a bonus for coming with THAT hogwash! Be forewarned: this isn't ""Buffy"" and there is no romance here at all. I don't think the characters hardly touched, let alone have a ""love affair"". One minor character appears to have had an interspecies romance in the far past, but it's not gone into.

What plot there is, is nearly incomphrensible.

784904,AB34G6VKP28L,B0000VAFNQ,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","Mythology dates legends of vampires all the way back into ancient Rome, when the goddess Lamia was believed to punish those unfaithful to her by robbing them of their children in the night, and draining their blood. In the centuries since, vampires have both been hated and feared, but in recent times, also featured as empathetic heroes in comic books and film franchises. Underworld is the most successful.A war has been raging for centuries between the lycans (a particular set of werewolves) and Vampires. Among the black-clad vampire warriors known as Death Dealers trained to defeat the enemy is Selene (Kate Beckinsale). Driven by an intense hatred for the werewolves that slaughtered her family in the middle ages, and a desire to please Viktor (Bill Nighy), her mentor and one of the three remaining elders, currently in a century-long hibernation, she relentlessly tracks and slays the enemy one by one. The lycans have taken a recent interest in a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), and the vampires desire to know why. Soon it will be the eve of the Awakening, when the vampires will gather to awaken Marcus, the next chosen elder meant to rule. The current leader of the coven is power driven Kraven (Shane Brolly), who seeks to pursue Selene as his future queen, but is jealously guarded by the equally determined Erika (Sophia Myles).Lucian (Michael Sheen), ruler of the Lyrons, has been rumored to be dead for centuries, slain at Kraven's hand, but Selene becomes convinced he still lives. Michael is forced to be taken into confidence when he is repetitively hunted by werewolves, unraveling a dangerous train of events that lead to slaughter, destruction, betrayal, and torment as the coven is split apart through mistrust and rivalry. What results is an exciting two hours spent delving into the underground and the rivalry between feuding clans. If nothing else, the film is original and exciting. It features strong leading women, as well as memorable male counterparts, which makes it appeal to female audiences. It also doesn't overdo the gore factor, and is light on profane language. There are currently two versions of this film released to the general public. The R-rated edition is twenty minutes shy of the Unrated's full length, but the longer version gives a much more dynamic structure to the subplot involving Kraven and Erika. Because of this, and because the content isn't spiked too much, I am fonder of the longer version.The brilliance on the part of the filmmakers is not the open ending, but the obscure references to the past history of the characters.

While some horror purists may take exception to the folklore surrounding the vampires and werewolves portrayed in the move, I think the minor changes are logical and work well, with the exception that the vampires are a lot weaker than they should be.No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the centuries long struggle between vampires and werewolves. On the surface, the vampires appear to have the upper hand with squads of ""Death Dealers"" (including Kate Beckinsale)  hunting down the werewolves. The twist comes when the werewolves appear to become interested in human target, for purposes other than eating him.The movie has a great dark atmosphere that gives a gothic feel even though it is set in the current time (except for the flashbacks).

It's a very stylish `monster' movie, though - a little unusually - humans are neither the heroes nor the victims. (The film doesn't stop for 'lunch').Beckinsdale plays Selene, our 'heroine' and the 'good' vampire. She's a Death Dealer - a vampire soldier - in a war against werewolves that has lasted for around a thousand years. As time has passed, the weapons used by both races have been updated - there are no stakes or crossbows in sight, while the traditional silver bullet has been modified. The current battles are being waged with throwing stars, guns and grenades - all enhanced to target the specific weaknesses of the intended victim. However, tradition hasn't been entirely sacrificed - vampires are still stylish and pale, while the vampire clan still lives in an old-fashioned, classy mansion. (Like the weapons, however, it does incorporate some 'modern' aspects). Selene very much looks to Viktor for guidance - Viktor is one of the vampires' three elders and something of a father figure to Selene. However, as the film opens, he is in hibernation and the day-to-day running of the vampires' affairs are in Kraven's hands. Kraven, somewhat power-hungry, also has designs on Selene - however, she ins't even remotely interested - she regularly disobeys his instructions and doesn't believe a great deal of what he has to say.Werewolves have officially been on the defensive for around 600 years, since Kraven killed their greatest leader, Lucien. However, they have never been fully defeated and, from early in the film, it seems the vampires have been lulled into a false sense of security. As well as the updated weapons, werewolves - or lycans, as they're known throughout the film - can now transform at will and no longer have to wait on the full moon. They appear to be in full control of their actions and can also heal more quickly while in wolf form. Where the vampires are pale and stylish, the werewolves are more animal-like and live underground. However, this hasn't stopped them performing 'medical research', with a particular interest in a family called Corvin. As the film opens, a couple of werewolves are stalking Speedman's character, a doctor called Michael Corvin. Selene, who's been on patrol and sees what's happening, is puzzled by this - it's clear the werewolves aren't just hunting for food. Her interest develops much further as the film progresses to the point of romance. This brings her a great deal of trouble when it becomes apparent the werewolves have 'turned' Michael. (It's also brought the comparisons with 'Romeo and Juliet' - a romance between two warring houses). As a result of the romance, she learns a great deal more about the origins of war and the night she was sired by Viktor.This is a very enjoyable and stylish film, with some very impressive special effects.

I anxiously await the release of this DVD.The movie, as most of you probably know, is about a war that has been going on between werewolves and vampires. And it is THIS that is the primary focus of the plot (as opposed to the vampire and werewolf lore itself). The werewolves have been researching their bloodlines and discovered a human who shares a common ancestor with both the werewolves and the vampires. The werewolves seek out this human, and this is noted by Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who decides to make it her mission to discover the importance of this particular human.Unfortunately, the writers decided not to delve too deeply into vampire and werewolf lore. I was pretty disappointed by the fact that the supernatural abilities of these supernatural beings were not really emphasized. Instead, the writers chose to merely stick guns in the hands of the vampires and werewolves. In addition, the mythology was slightly different from what I've read and seen before in previous vampire and werewolf books and movies. I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but if you are going to change things from what people are used to, then it should be explained in slightly more detail.This aside, the movie was still pretty incredible. The plot was exceptional, which is not necessarily always the case with most action movies, and the action kept me entertained throughout the movie's entirety. The effects were great, and the creepy lighting added to the atmosphere of the film.  The make-up and costumes were also outstanding, as was the acting.  I anxiously await the sequel (and based on how the movie ended, there WILL be a sequel)!The extras on this DVD look awesome!  I am really interested in checking out the stunts, make-up, and effects featurettes.  I am also intrigued to listen to the writer's commentary.  Over all, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in vampires, werewolves, and pretty much anything occult or gothic.

Watch this movie and you'll find out how.  Where this movie goes wrong is by trying to include too much plot content involving too many characters and presented to the audience all in the wrong order.  By the end of the movie you actually understand what is going on, but just spent the whole movie not really sure of which side you were routing for.  The thing I hated about this movie is that it actually had solid potential and the story was even a good one.  The movie was very stylish and had above average special effects and decent action scenes.That there was one of the big problems in the movie.  They spent too much time making the movie look good and stylish.  The producers were aiming for a cultish flavored hit and at least with me failed.  Watching the main chick vampire spend half the movie simply strutting tomboyishly around with an attitude that left a frost behind her, just doesn't do it for me.  By the end I could give a crap if she lived or died, in fact I found myself not caring about any of the characters let alone like any of them.  I will say that had they told the story in a different order, and from the beginning at least hinted behind some of the plot reasons for why this war was raging, I could probably have enjoyed it a whole lot more, only due to the fact that I'd know roughly who was good and who was bad.This movie tries to be one part American Werewolf in Paris, one part Blade, one part The Matrix and turns out a stale example of mediocrity.

The funny thing is that it's the similarities to VTM that are this otherwise shallow and hokie movie's redeeming features. See this film is entertaining, it's not horrible, but it's not great either. It's certainly better than any other vampire movie I've seen of late, which is sad really... It's just disturbing to me that the only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was watching for subtle not-so-unintentional similarities to Vampire the Masquerade.The irony is that having been a rabid White Wolf addict-fan for the last thirteen years I have had my level of expectations for vampire movies and literature raised so high that even White Wolf themselves can't always meet the expectations because so much of their past work has been beyond excellent. Its difficult for anything to live up so such expectations without ripping off the World of Darkness completely, and while I don't think that was the intention of this film they did come pretty close to doing that, and I really hate to say it, but if they had just ripped off more elements of Vampire the Masquerade and Werewolf the Apocalypse the movie, including the brilliant narrative of the White Wolf writing staff, and we would have had a masterpiece of a vampire movie, up there with Interview with the Vampire. Instead all we have is a few (like 60 according to White Wolf's lawyers) points of similarities mixed in with Romeo and Juliet, minus the tragic ending, and without any real character development, or decent dialogue, plus characters who don't realize that when you're pumped full of silver nitrate you're supposed to be dead, as in no getting up... I think the lesson that needs to be learned from this movie isn't &quot;don't rip of Vampire The Masquerade&quot; it's &quot;For crying out loud you know you want to, just make Vampire: The Masquerade into a movie!&quot; There's more than enough material to go on there, you could even make a 13 volume movie series based off the clan novels, I mean really they're great!

784929,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B0000VAFNQ,Daniel K.,"[1, 2]","Underworld, an action flick starring Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman can be called diverting entertainment.  Though the plot of the film is rather incomprehensible, the film has enough style to be atleast watchable.  Director Len Wisemen who is recently engaged to Beckinsale) creates a nice setting to the film, with the appropriate tone.  The action scenes are pretty good, as well the visual effects which are passingly cool including the transformation of humans into werevolves.Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire.  The film takes place in London.  There are mainly two striving groups, the vampires and the lycans a.k.a. werewolves.  Scott Speedman plays a human who has been bitten and has transformed into a lycan.  Unfortunately Beckinsale and Speedman fall in love, which is intolerable since they are sworn enemies.Underworld is mild for the genre, since it isn't overly graphic, though there still is an abundant amount of violence.  Mainly including much gunplay, impalements, bitings (some of which are bloody), whippings and fights among vampries/lycans.  There isn't much profanity, just a few instances of the ""f"" and ""s"" word.  Underworld is rated R for Strong Violence/Gore and Some Language.  As for the acting, well it wasn't totally believe or convincing but then again you don't expect oscar-worthy acting in a film like this.  I saw it in theatres, sadly not during opening weekend.

I was channel surfing the other night and came across the movie on HBO and figured it wont hurt to watch it and if anything I'll fall asleep.  I was up till 5am making sure i saw the end. The movie is very intersting and keeps you glued. The emotions and attitudes of the characters are believable. The computer graphics are obvious but they look good. The storyline is a bit up in the air. It seems that the writers just wanted to get some information out about vampires and werewolves and their histories together. Aside from that the movie played well and kept me awake when i expected to fall asleep.

784931,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B0000VAFNQ,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[136, 165]","Boiled down to the fine little dish of steak tar-tar that it is, ""Underworld"" is the answer to the two horror flick questions you had as a kid:1) If Dracula and the Wolfman went mano a mano and fang-to-claw, which one would do the thrashing?2) If Dracula and the Wolfman checked into a cheap motel, got roaring drunk on a case of Night Train, and had a baby, what would it look like?You get the answer to #1 early and often, which is pretty much what this Transylvania Station is all about.  And by the end of ""Underworld"" you get #2 as well---and trust me, when it's hopping about like an ugly green Mini-Hulk (right down to its one-size-fits-all-monster trunks) you'll wish you hadn't.You want to know what you're getting when you lace up your thigh-high attitude boots and strap on that trenchcoat for a little midnight fun in Len Wiseman's uber-stylish little monster mash ""Underworld""?Think West Side Story: only here, instead of the Jets and the Sharks angling for a rumble on the other side of the tracks, we have Vampires and Werewolves.  Oh, and in ""Underworld"" nobody breaks into song.  Both sides just want to rumble, and the girls just wanna have fun. In the meantime, while not the sharpest stake in the vamp-hunter kitbag, ""Underworld"" finds its groove, and serves up a bloody two hours of unabashed techno-cool that drinks you dry, trashes the apartment and howls at the moon.We get dropped into the middle of a war that Celine (the impossibly tasty Kate Beckinsdale)---our supple full-body-suit clad vampiric Death Dealer and narrator---tells us has been ""raging for centuries.""On one side of the tracks: the sneering, brutally hip Euro-trashy leather-trenchcoat & hip-sunglasses wearing uber-high-maintenance Vampires.  They have posh high-rent neo-Victorian digs, drive around the streets in Jaguars and Maseratis, and have managed to switch up the silver bullets in their glocks and MP-5 submachine guns for something more lethal: liquid silver nitrate, which makes it tougher for their hairy buddies to pull the bullets out.  Advantage: Vampires.On the other side of the tracks: the Salvation Army surplus-wearing tear-your-scalp-off-and-wear-it Werewolves---erm, I mean Lycans, short for Lycanthropes.  The Lycans are strictly low-rent, hang out together in what looks like an abandoned public lavatory, and take a bath once every full moon whether they need it or not.  Whereas their blood-sucking cousins from the East Side look like they'd be hanging at crazy underground raves when they're not boring each other to tears talking like the Merovingian, the Lycans are strictly the mosh-pit set.  Oh, and from what I could tell, there's not a single werewolf girl.  C'mon guys---haven't ya heard of ""Ginger Snaps""?  Bummer.  Advantage: Vampires.That said, the boys have been pumping the rent money they've saved up into super-science research, giving them bullets that encase super-photoelectric magnesium charges (perfect for giving that oncoming vamp a little taste of Club Med sunlight).  They also have the upper hand in figuring out how they can mix the bloodlines, bringing the war between Vamp and Lycan to an end.  Advantage: Lycans.And finally, mixing it up with our fanged-kissin' cousins, we have perplexed med student Michael Corvin (played by the annoying Scott Speedman who cashes a check) stalked by Lycan heavies and tagged by Selene, who wants to know why the werewolf army is so eager to get their hands on him.And that, pretty much, is ""Underworld"": two hours of movie built around jaw-droppingly gorgeous set-pieces and bouts of total war between locked-and-loaded squads of Things that go Bump in the Night.Just a note: you'll want to get the Unrated Extended DVD: it fleshes things out, beefs up some supporting characters, and ends with an extended battle sequence---and it's loaded down with plenty of extras you can sink your fangs into.Plus, the sleeker transfer shows off Wiseman's technical mastery in spades.  Wiseman uses sound-stages and CGI to anchor the film's look, and tethers all of it to the fog-shrouded cobbled streets and ancient alleys of Prague: the City itself takes on a bleak and brooding character.  The movie looks gorgeous: whether it's the gloomy red-velvet and dark mahogany halls of the mansion, the sleek, sterile Underground, or the industrial ruins of the Lycans, Wiseman and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts make every scene tell.  The sequence where a locomotive full of vampire diplomats chugs into a deserted rail-station---with the baying of werewolves in the distance---is jaw dropping.""Underworld"" also gets the most out of its talented stable of actors.  There are three centers of gravity in the film: Beckinsdale, who doesn't need her bodysuit to command her lines (though I'm glad she wore it).  The Lycan overlord Lucien (the gifted Welsh actor Michael Sheen) steals every scene he's in, and brings complexity and command to a role that could have been a throwaway in lesser hands.  Finally, there's the Vampire King Viktor, played by the great Bill Nighy (who also played Shaun's Jag-loving stepdad in ""Shaun of the Dead"").  Nighy is a kind of demonic embodiment of immortal Puritan rage, and acts like a champ through all that make-up.Even the supporting actors turn in strong roles: Shane Brolly (Kraven) whines and pouts and lisps and turns in a convincing performance as a spineless worm; Sophia Myles (Erika) comes off as a naughty little vampire cat-girl; Kevin Grevioux owns this film and puts the smack down as Uber-Werewolf Raze; and Hungarian actress Zita Gorog rocked my world---without uttering a single line.In the end, this batwinged black-lipstick wearing looker of a flick charged into the goth club of my choice, served me an extra-bloody steak tartar , smacked me around, bought me drinks, and talked Shakespeare after.  Would a Lycan by any other name be just as hairy?",4,West Side (Transylvania) Story,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,5880,"['Boiled', 'down', 'fine', 'little', 'dish', 'steak', 'tar-tar', 'Underworld',

784933,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0000VAFNQ,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[2, 7]","Have you ever read the appendix of an epic novel?  You know the pages near the back of a classic novel like DUNE or LORD OF THE RINGS where a lot of extra information lies.  It let's you in on a thing that happened before the story and tells of kings and queen who ruled the area before the action of the actual story take place.  The new film UNDERWORLD plays like the appendix of a novel.  There's lots of extra information and yet very little substance in and of itself.UNDERWORLD tells the story of Selene (Kate Beckensale, Pearl Harbor), a vampire, and Michael (Scott Speedman, Duets) a human being chased by the vampire's sworn enemies, a band of Werewolves. Selene job in her vampire clan is to kill said Werewolves, she's known as a death eater.  You see there is a war brewing between the werewolves and the vampires.  It's kind of an undead Hatfield and McCoy story.Or is it? UNDERWORLD suffers from an intriguing concept and little substance.  There is this huge back-story, that finds its way into the movie and I bet it's figured out pretty concisely.  There talk of history, and legend, and generations of vampire's and werewolves.  But that's all.  Compelling characters take a back seat, to loud and almost obnoxious action sequences and subplots running left and right with nowhere to go.In fact the only reason the film focuses on Beckensale is because she's the big name star.  She comes and goes at the whim of the screenplay.  In fact I think there was a 20-minute segment near the end that she isn't even in.  The major plot of this film plays like an overlong subplot in a much more epic film or maybe even a two-part episode of a fantasy television series.In fact that's the only way a film like Underworld can work.  The film is crying out for some focus.  There's a story dying to come out.  It's right there on the surface, and instead of focusing on Selene and her fight to save Michael.  It is bogged down by this silly and overdeveloped history of the war between vampire's and werewolves.  You know what.  This movie would make a great television or comic book series.  It just doesn't work as a stand-alone film.And yet I can't say I hated UNDERWORLD.  It looks too good.  Its visual style lies somewhere between BATMAN and MINORITY REPORT.  It's set in one of those futuristic cities that are dirty and disgusting, and full of horror.  A city where the sun never shines and humans are food for the children of the night.  If you like really neat eye candy this is the film for you.It seems like the filmmakers took the lets see how much cool stuff we can jam into the film approach, and most of it works on a purely surface level.  It's only after you realize that if you removed most of the cool scenes you'd have nothing worth watching and that's when the Action sequences begin to grate on you.I longed for a much better, more fully realized picture than I got with UNDERWORLD.

I simply want to state that this film is destined to become a cult classic. Some of its many strong points include virtually non-CGI Lycans (even a scene where Lycans are running toward the camera on the walls of a corridor was done with stunt men and digitally erased cables); desaturated color, using digital technology, that provides this film with an amazingly beautiful Gothic look; and some fantastic action sequences that, although occasionally derivative, fit the storyline very well and do not seem forced in the least.It's a shame that this extended/recut version of Underworld was not shown in theatres, because the edited theatrical release that generated critical trashing almost assuredly hurt the studio financially. Although I cannot compare the two versions, I can tell you that if audiences had seen this ""Unrated Extended Cut,"" Underworld would have been a critical and financial success, and deemed a major milestone in Gothic cinema.I do not wish to hype this film, but I do believe you will find it to be a valuable addition to your film library.",5,A cult classic,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,1378,"['did', 'not', 'see', 'Underworld', 'theatres', 'was', 'always', 'wary', 'due', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'yet', 'curious', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'When', 'purchased', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Instead', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'delighted', 'Read', 'other', 'reviews', 'synopsis', 'simply', 'want', 'state', 'film', 'destined', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'many', 'strong', 'points', 'include', 'virtually', 'non-CGI', 'Lycans', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'Lycans', 'are', 'running', 'camera', 'walls', 'corridor', 'was', 'done', 'stunt', 'men', 'digitally', 'erased', 'cables', 'desaturated', 'color', 'using', 'digital', 'technology', 'film', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'Gothic', 'look', 'fantastic', 'action', 'sequences', 'occasionally', 'derivative', 'fit', 'storyline', 'very', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'forced', 'least.It', 'shame', 'extended/recut', 'version', 'Underworld', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'theatres', 'edited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'generated', 'critical', 'trashing', 'almost', 'assuredly', 'hurt', 'studio', 'financially', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'versions', 'can', 'tell', 'audiences', 'had', 'seen', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Underworld', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'financial', 'success', 'deemed', 'major', 'milestone', 'Gothic', 'cinema.I', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'hype', 'film', 'do', 'believe', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'valuable', 'addition', 'film', 'library']",N/A

Although there might be some slight inconsistencies (I think they squeazed two nights into one long night without pause) the pacing of the story keeps you from worrying about it. The movie takes a more secular or mundane route for explaining the existence of vampires and werewolves. For not being a big budget movie, they did well with what they had. It is a bit bloody, but considering the subject matter it is rather tame, and is handled more cinematically, than graphically.As for the question of what a vampire/werewolf would look like, I think you have to consider he was not in werewolf form when he was bitten and he was given enzymes to keep him from transforming to a werewolf, hence, the form would not be very wolf like until the individual in question could have the enzymes take their course. Remember, that character had never fully transformed into a wolf form, therefore, his structure would not be fully changed.All in all I thought it was a well done movie, and you would never know that it was made with a fraction of the money spent on the Matrix's second movie!

The effects were super, but that was the main impact...""wow what amazing effects"".  You feel like breaking out in a chorus of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is.  Special effects alone cannot make a movie great.Underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate.  A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that.  With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing.  Instant Cult Status.The movie grabs you from the opening and never lets up with the pace.  Firm direction and with a driving score, the movie reaches for perfection.  You have a 1000-year-old war between Lycons and Vampires, and it's all coming to a head.  It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines!  She is an amazing talent.  I first adored her work in Cold Comfort Farm as Robert Post's child Flora.  When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humor with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is.  With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.A gloomy, atmospheric ambiance to the whole movie is maintained all the way through, adding a strong foundation for the otherworld premise.

784949,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0000VAFNQ,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[5, 6]","'Underworld' chronicles the centuries old fight between the Vampires and the Werewolves.  That is a revelation in itself, as most adaptation of the two monsters don't have them at odds in warfare with each other.  Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, one of the Death Bringers, that take the fight to the werewolves.  While tracking a couple of werewolves one night, she notices that they seem to be tracking a particular human named Michael Corvin (played by Scott Speedman).  Her suspicions aroused, she begins to investigate, and things suddenly start going terribly wrong.'Underworld' is a nice twist on the old vampire and werewolve stories.  The vampires are not the typical vampires found in many gothic movies.  For one, while immortal in the sense that they can potentially live forever, they are still vulnerable to death by violent means, and it doesn't mean a stake through the heart.  The werewolves are also more complex than the usual blood lust lycanthropes as they are frequently portrayed.This movie also borrows from other sources, and blends them quite well.  There is a getaway scene in a car that is reminiscent of 'Terminator 2,' a showdown in the later stages of the movie that brings 'Aliens' to mind, and some early action scenes that are clearly inspired by 'The Matrix.'  On the upside, these influences create a movie that is visually exciting in terms of action and very suspenseful at points.  On the down side, the movie can be a bit predictable at times.The acting in the movie was adequate, but nothing special.  Beckinsale knows how to handle herself in a vampire/werewolf movie, and appears to making a habit of it (see 'Van Helsing' and the in production sequel to this movie).  Speedman didn't have that large a part until the end of the movie, and consequently, he really didn't have to act much.As for my gripes about the movie, I'll start with the similar appearance of many of the characters.  Several of the characters had such similar clothing, makeup, and physical characteristics, it was often difficult to tell them apart.  This made a few scenes rather confusing.  In addition, while the movie does a great job of being mysterious in the beginning, some of the revelations are a bit of a let down in their timing throughout the movie.  Some of the anticpated plot twists are really an anticlimax.Overall, its a very enjoyable movie.  Vampire fans should enjoy it, but those that prefer introspective vampires such as LeStat from Anne Rice's novels, might not like this.

Here, The Vampires are aristocratic libertines presiding in opulent lairs while the Lycans are more or less street thugs residing under the city.Subsequently, the Lycans formulate a plan to mix vampire and werewolf DNA to create a master warrior who would destroy the vampires once and for all. Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, sets his sights on a mortal named 'Michael' to be transformed into this champion for them. It is seen that this warrior represents the ""son"" ""Lucian"" never had, who himself falls in love with 'Selene', an attractive lycan-hunter, which stirs contention with Kraven, lord of the Vampire castle who stands as vampire ruler, whose reign is less than acceptable to Emperor Viktor, once he is awakened by Selene and becomes aware of the potentially dangerous situation brewing with the Lycans, which can effectively end their existence.Armed with silver nitrate bullets, Selene and a handful of vampires go forth to decimate these werewolves, before they reach them and tear them to pieces. One of the more gorey scenes involves a massacre within a train.Confused by the changes he is experiencing and impelled by his growing fascination with this shadowy underworld as well as an infatuation for Selene, Michael returns to the castle where he was kept prisoner after being kidnapped by Selene, and eventually is captured by Lucian, wherein his resident geneticist ""Singe"" begins experimenting to complete the matamorphosis into the Vampire-Werewolf synthesis.Viktor wages elegantly with the furious amalgamated warrior, and in an unexpected twist, Selene goes sword to sword with Viktor, ending with a most interesting strike.The film is repleat with enjoyable dark environments, leather-clad accoutrement, impressive transmogrifications, an original and compelling plot, with constant action-adventure {not horror}, in a general ""Buffy""/VanHelsing-like vain, although the premise is superior to those presentations.

784954,A3VQLTB724O77W,B0000VAFNQ,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[3, 4]","Underworld is a stylish, gory, action filled horror movie, based on three premises.  The first is Vampires vs. Werewolves--an intriguing idea.  The second is that the audience has been raised on videogames and wants that kind of constant action--debatable as to whether this is helpful or not, but it sure keeps the movie going so you don't really have time to think.  The third, and most unfortunate, is that The Matrix is ripe for plucking.I admit to enjoying Underworld quite a bit, but the entire look of the movie (except, of course, the Werewolf transformations, which were inspired by The Howling) was hauntingly familiar--it's all Matrix, from the costuming to the choreography, the cinematography, the lighting....superbly done, but blatantly stolen.  And with costuming and set design, I suppose that's forgivable, but relying on Matrix for more than that derailed the initial premise too much.Within the first ten minutes I asked myself a question I'd return to over and over: &quot;Why are vampires and werewolves in human form shooting at each other--and missing?&quot;  I really wasn't expecting so much gunplay (and martial arts) in a Vampire/Werewolf movie, and I think the film was the worse for it.  We've seen it all before, it advanced the plot not at all, and seemed grossly out of place for the genre.  The real interest in Vampires vs. Werewolves would be how they physically matched up--and when the film did develop this, it was really unique, with Vampires more agile but incapable of flight or shapeshifting, and Werewolves slower but vastly more powerful.  I personally had no interest in who could outshoot the other, and couldn't quite understand why that played such a huge part in the film.  Furthermore, another unfortunate question popped up:  &quot;How do those guns contain a seemingly infinite number of bullets?&quot; {See premise 2, above--only once in the movie did someone run out of bullets, only a few times was there reloading, but billions and billions of bullets, and lots and lots of missing...this was dumb as far back as Rambo.}Plotwise, though, the Vampires vs. Werewolves idea worked well, and was developed in an interesting and unexpected fashion.  Acting was quite good, with a touch of overacting to be expected from such a topic, and the casting excellent.  Kate Beckinsale, as Trinity, er, no sorry, as the vampire Selene, and Scott Speedman as Neo, oops, I mean Michael, are both gorgeous and convincing.  I was taken aback a bit by Beckinsale's resemblance to Michael Jackson at his most feminine, though...Anyway, in spite of its flaws, it's certainly entertaining and worth watching, at least once.",4,Vampires Can't Shoot,1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,2659,"['Underworld', 'stylish', 'gory', 'action', 'filled', 'horror', 'movie', 'based', 'three', 'premises', 'first', 'Vampires', 'vs.', 'Werewolves', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'second', 'audience', 'been', 'raised', 'videogames', 'kind', 'constant', 'action', 'debatable', 'helpful', 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'going', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'time', 'think', 'third', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'Matrix', 'ripe', 'plucking.I', 'admit', 'enjoying', 'Underworld', 'quite', 'bit', 'entire', 'look', 'movie', 'course', 'Werewolf', 'transformations', 'were', 'inspired', 'Howling', 'was', 'hauntingly', 'familiar', 'Matrix', 'costuming', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'lighting', '.superbly', 'done', 'blatantly', 'stolen', 'costuming', 'set', 'design', 'suppose', 'forgivable', 'relying', 'Matrix', 'more', 'derailed', 'initial', 'premise', 'too', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'asked', 'question', ""'d"", 'return', 'quot', 'Why', 'are', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'human', 'form', 'shooting', 'other', 'missing', 'quot', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'so', 'much', 'gunplay', 'martial', 'arts', 'Vampire/Werewolf', 'movie', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'worse', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'advanced', 'plot', 'not', 'seemed', 'grossly', 'place', 'genre', 'real', 'interest', 'Vampires', 'vs.', 'Werewolves', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'physically', 'matched', 'up', 'when', 'film', 'did', 'develop', 'was', 'really', 'unique', 'Vampires', 'more', 'agile', 'incapable', 'flight', 'shapeshifting', 'slower', 'vastly', 'more', 'powerful', 'personally', 'had', 'interest', 'who', 'could', 'outshoot', 'other', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'played', 'huge', 'part', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'unfortunate', 'question', 'popped', 'up', 'quot', 'How', 'do', 'guns', 'contain', 'seemingly', 'infinite', 'number', 'bullets', 'quot', 'See', 'premise', '2', 'above', 'only', 'once', 'movie', 'did', 'someone', 'run', 'bullets', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'reloading', 'billions', 'billions', 'bullets', 'lots', 'lots', 'missing', 'was', 'dumb', 'far', 'back', 'Rambo', 'Plotwise', 'though', 'Vampires', 'vs.', 'Werewolves', 'idea', 'worked', 'well', 'was', 'developed', 'interesting', 'unexpected', 'fashion', 'Acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'touch', 'overacting', 'be', 'expected', 'topic', 'casting', 'excellent', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Trinity', 'er', 'sorry', 'vampire', 'Selene', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Neo', 'mean', 'Michael', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'convincing', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'bit', 'Beckinsale', 'resemblance', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'most', 'feminine', 'Anyway', 'spite', 'flaws', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once']",N/A

From there it is all downhill,with the denouement being launched by resurrecting to life a dead old leader of the vampires, who is angry at the fact since it is a few days before his scheduled time (or did I misunderstand that?)Well, that is my take on the going-ons, such as they were, but-naturally- I do not expect any  vampirologist to agree nor, yet, any werewolfen.

The menus are cool, with short clips from the movies, or animated scenes, like the main menu where it takes you on the top of buildings. I cannot say much of the special features since I only have a DVD player, not a DVD-ROM, thus, I cant access all. The commentary is fantastic though, from the director, and 2 writers... I didnt expect that one of the writers was &quot;Raze&quot;(or whats his name) in the movie - the black guy with very cool and deep voice. What is disappointing is the featurette, which is the same as the preview commercial of the movie - which is also in the DVD! Other than that, the quality of it all is cool.If I am to give a say about the movie itself, its kinda interesting with the notion of a vampire vs. werewolf thing, BUT they kinda made it too Bladish or too modern that killed the mystique of both races - especially the vampires. The vampires got reflections in mirrors, and they didnt show parts when they actually killed people to feed. Its like they just showed people with fangs armed with guns. And it kinda go slow at some parts too, but I cant blame them since its the first of a trilogy, and the first movie usually takes more dragging parts to introduce the plots and characters. Other than the vampires appearing very non-vampiric and too weak(they cant win without guns, how could they have been the superior race?!), I think the movie got a deep story with a lot of twists and turns, and almost all characters have their own agendas... which makes it so interesting and making you want to know what happens on the next installment.

There are the kinds that instantly establish directors as critically-acclaimed and immensely talented, and then there are movies like &quot;Underworld.&quot; Len Wiseman's vampires vs. werewolves flick had so much promise, and just about all of it is squandered.The vampires and Lycans have been at war for centuries, for reasons that are revealed later in the movie. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the vampires whose sole duty and purpose is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (a &quot;death dealer,&quot; har har) with guns that shoot silver bullets. The Lycans, in turn, fire ultraviolet bullets that can kill the vampires. Whatever.Enter Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a young human who is being followed by the Lycans. Selene is intrigued by why he's important to the Lycans, but unfortunately he's been bitten by one, and is now in danger of becoming one. To uncover the answers about why Corvin is important, Selene will uncover the truth about both the Lycan and vampire races -- and secrets about her own past.There hasn't been a halfway decent vampire flick in uncounted years, or a decent werewolf flick in even longer. Looks like that  Taking &quot;Underworld&quot; even semi-seriously is hard to do; it's like the unwanted illegitimate child of &quot;Matrix&quot; and &quot;Blade,&quot; without the appeal of either. The special effects are okay, but the story and action (not to mention the near-nonexistant romance) are as cold and clammy as a vampire's kiss.Wiseman's clumsiness is shown vividly in the action scenes, which are all cloned from &quot;Matrix&quot; -- lots of bullets, swirling leather and antigravity jumps. And some humor might have elevated this film to action camp, but heroes and villains alike are so earnest that they almost come across as goofy. There are plenty of gaping plot holes that could have been avoided (why do vampires spend all their time lounging around?), but Wiseman apparently doesn't bother to try spackling them shut.Kate Beckinsale, a talented young actress, is horribly wasted here. Most of her time is spent pouting and wearing how-can-she-move leather. Her chemistry with Speedman is nil, which is good, since the romance between them is also virtually nonexistant. Speedman does what he can, but he doesn't have much to work with. Bill Nighy alone gets to chew the scenery as senior vamp Viktor.Relentlessly hokey and humorless, &quot;Underworld&quot; is an effort to elevate style over substance. In the end, it doesn't have either.

Some of the supporters are obvious gothic horror film freeks who like anything with wowzer special affects.  Some of the detracters just can't enjoy a film that is'nt ""highly acclaimed"".Well, I fall between these two extremes.  Here's my take on this highly watchable ""horror/action/gothic/Matrix"" wanna-be;-Obviously ""The Matrix"" series (and it's financial success) had allot to do with this getting made.  I would call this the horror equivelent to ""The Matrix"" series.-Now some are crying fowel. But this film gets criticized for the exact thing that ""The Matrix"" does; THE STORY HAD INFINITE BUT FAILED POTENTIAL.-Actually, I think if ""The Matrix"" stopped at the first film, it would have been more impressive.  ""Underworld"" has a less flawed story than the 2 ""Matrix"" sequals.-Say what you will, the special affects are pretty cool.  This is how this film got most peoples attention in the first place.-Miss Beckinsale is quite fetching in her costume... hey, you can't argue!-The vampires (other than Kate) seemed a little too whimpy.  For the most part, they get trounced.-The stories biggest flaw: Using guns to do most of the fighting.  These are supernatural creatures,  LET THEM DUKE IT OUT!!-I did not know that vampires could act in a consious manner with their brains detached from their bodies.  Just nit-picky I guess.-I really enjoyed this film on a visual level.  They obviously were going for allot of ""posed"" imagry.-Most reviewers are correct when they say you don't care much for either side.  HOW COULD YOU!!  THEY ARE, BY DEFINITION, SCARY MONSTERS THAT EAT US!!-The DVD is adequate for the ""not-the-directors-unrated-cut-super-special-edition"".  For what I paid (NOT $15) I'm happy.The bottom line:  I actually was very afraid to buy this based on the mixed reviews.  So, I waited for a really good sale.  I'm happy with my purchase.  Not a great film but entertaining.  It will be fun to watch around Halloween.  Given the premise, most people with a fair imagination could have come up with much more dynamic and quality alternative story-line.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[6, 8]","UNDERWORLD is the kind of film that studios -- during the late 70s and 80s -- considered 'throwaways': horror films given a certain degree of mythology meant to attract little more than the teen audience willing to spend a few bucks for a few scares.  The influence of STAR WARS, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg on the film industry, however, largely has caused the industry to reinvent the horror (monster, not slasher) film as &quot;an event film&quot;: cast some modest to big name actors, throw in heavier doses of backstory and mythology, and viola!  You've got art!Of course, vampires are enjoying a reasonable rebirth as of late.  INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE had the critics up in arms, while BLADE (I &amp; II) really catored more to the 18-45 demographic in terms of violence, music, and action.  Even television got into the act with KINDRED: THE EMBRACED, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and the stellar BBC mini ULTRAVIOLET.  As with the vast vampire subculture, there's plenty of blood here for good stories.In that estimation, UNDERWORLD feels underdone.  It's full of big ideas -- a centuries old unknown war between Vampires and Werewolves for dominance, Vampire covens ruled by reawakened members of the undead, DNA sequencing to try and create a hybrid between the two species, a Romeo &amp; Juliet spinoff love story -- that needed to be cooked a while longer in order to determine which ingredients would produce the best dish -- including Kate Beckingsale whose behind looks absolutely spectacular in leather.Despite the studio's rush to greenlight a sequel, UNDERWORLD played to solid (not great) box office receipts, and this viewer only hopes that the creative folk will peel back some layers of the mythology they've created in order to deliver a product that feels less 'rushed' and far more 'important.'",2,Underdone,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,1831,"['UNDERWORLD', 'kind', 'film', 'studios', 'late', '70s', '80s', 'considered', ""'throwaways"", 'horror', 'films', 'given', 'certain', 'degree', 'mythology', 'meant', 'attract', 'little', 'more', 'teen', 'audience', 'willing', 'spend', 'few', 'bucks', 'few', 'scares', 'influence', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'industry', 'however', 'largely', 'caused', 'industry', 'reinvent', 'horror', 'monster', 'not', 'slasher', 'film', 'quot', 'event', 'film', 'quot', 'cast', 'modest', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'throw', 'heavier', 'doses', 'backstory', 'mythology', 'viola', ""'ve"", 'got', 'art', 'course', 'vampires', 'are', 'enjoying', 'reasonable', 'rebirth', 'late', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'A', 'VAMPIRE', 'had', 'critics', 'up', 'arms', 'BLADE', 'amp', 'II', 'really', 'catored', 'more', '18-45', 'demographic', 'terms', 'violence', 'music', 'action', 'Even', 'television', 'got', 'act', 'KINDRED', 'EMBRACED', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'ANGEL', 'stellar', 'BBC', 'mini', 'ULTRAVIOLET', 'vast', 'vampire', 'subculture', 'plenty', 'blood', 'here', 'good', 'stories.In', 'estimation', 'UNDERWORLD', 'underdone', 'full', 'big', 'ideas', 'centuries', 'old', 'unknown', 'war', 'Vampires', 'Werewolves', 'dominance', 'Vampire', 'ruled', 'reawakened', 'members', 'undead', 'DNA', 'sequencing', 'try', 'create', 'hybrid', 'two', 'species', 'Romeo', 'amp', 'Juliet', 'spinoff', 'love', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'cooked', 'while', 'longer', 'order', 'determine', 'ingredients', 'would', 'produce', 'best', 'dish', 'including', 'Kate', 'Beckingsale', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'leather.Despite', 'studio', 'rush', 'greenlight', 'sequel', 'UNDERWORLD', 'played', 'solid', 'not', 'great', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'viewer', 'only', 'creative', 'folk', 'will', 'peel', 'back', 'layers', 'mythology', ""'ve"", 'created', 'order', 'deliver', 'product', 'less', ""'rushed"", 'far', 'more', ""'important""]",N/A
784965,AKZMP6OOE89GV,B0000VAFNQ,Elite14,"[5, 6]","Wow. This movie was a surprise. I went and saw it in the theaters with a couple of friends on a Saturday night when we had nothing to do. I didn't expect much. I hadn't heard of the director. It's got the guy from Felicity in it (Scott Speedman). And it looked like a Blade rip-off. I thought the premise sounded cool &amp; I love Kate Beckinsale. But, I thought it wasn't going to be very good regardless. Was I ever wrong!!!Now don't get me wrong....this isn't the type of flick that wins oscars. And it's not even a movie that everyone seems to like. There is just something about the story, how it was shot, the characters, and the look &amp; style of the film that appeals to me.The story of vampires vs. werewolves is an interesting one. Apparently there has been a war between the two covents for centuries. And it's been happening right under our noses. Kate Beckinsale plays a &quot;Death Dealer&quot;. Basically she is a hunter of werewolves. Thought to have almost been driven to extinction, the lycons (werewolves) have been living in the sewers and plotting a way to eliminate the vampires. When the lycons try to capture a human (Speedman), Selene (Beckinsale) tries to figure out why. Much action and killing insues.This is a combination of a Blade &amp; Matrix rip-off. Not so much in storyline or plot as in style and how the action scenes are shot. The special effects are done pretty well. They tried to use practical effects as much as possible, to keep the budget down and make it look more realistic. I found this to be a plus. The storyline is quite interesting, espcially when Selene awakens Viktor, the oldest and most powerful vampire.The acting here is decent, with Beckinsale doing the best job of the bunch. I know some other reviewers would disagree with that comment, but she did what she could with what she had. This movie is not about award-winning acting. It's about killer gunfights and looking good while in them. This film has style and sleekness dripping from it. The movie never gets slow, even though it clocks in at a little over 2 hrs.I know some people weren't impressed with this movie at all. But, I just went to the theater expecting nothing and got everything I could ask for my seven dollars. I can tell I probably like this movie more than some people would. But, if you are looking for a fun way to spend the evening, you could not go wrong renting this movie. I highly recommend this for a purchase, but if you are unsure give it a rental and then decide for yourself. I just hope they make a sequal.The DVD features are kind of disappointing, however. The featurettes are ok, but nothing great. There are also two commentaries, trailers, &amp; a music video.

784970,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0000VAFNQ,Erica Anderson,"[19, 23]","I have been a big vampire mythology fan for as long as I can remember. I love a good vampire movie. I'm not expecting Masterpiece Theater, I just want to be entertained, and entertained I was with ""Underworld"". I missed out seeing the movie when it was in the theaters but I'm glad that I did now that I have seen the extended cut. I'm not really a fan of Kate Beckinsdale film work but she does a great job as death dealer (i.e vampire) Selene. Selene is trying to figure out why the Lycans (i.e werewolves), the vampires' enemies, what they want in Michael Corvin (played by Scott Speedman of ""Felicity"" fame). The Lycans and death dealers are at war and have been for centuries. I loved the dark, moody atmosphere of the entire film. I thought it was amazing how the werewolves were actually costumes as opposed to resorting to the cheesy CGI most movies relies on nowadays (which I think is way too much). Kate Beckinsdale looked great in that skintight leather outfight and short dark hair. She reminded me a lot of Toni Halliday, the singer from the modern rock band Curve. The film is very sleek and stylish. I can definitely see where the comparisons of the movie to other films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade"" comes in (like on the fight sequences) but ""Underworld"" still holds its own. There really wasn't much of a plot the one big flaw I found with the film but I didn't care. It was a non-stop thrill ride for me. The acting was a bit on the overstated side but like I said, this ain't Masterpiece Theater. If you want Masterpiece Theater, then go watch some (awful) Merchant Ivory film. ""Underworld"" is a fun, non-stop rollercoaster ride (or at least I thought). The bonus features on the dvd is awesome. I especially dug the ""Fangs Vs. Fiction"" segment and watching the cast of the film talk about making the film. I loved the outtake reel. It is always interesting for me to see the actors goof up on their lines in movies. You don't see that very often except as bonus footage on dvds. I liked the 48 page comic book and the sketchings on the entire film.

784971,A3L2U581LL17EB,B0000VAFNQ,Eric,"[0, 0]","As an introductory film to hopefully a larger, more epic and expansive series, Underworld fulfills its requirements adequately. There's enough action, blood, and tight latex outfits to satisfy a genre fan's thirst and the execution is decent enough that I look forward to the sequels, but there's the unmistakable sense of promise left unfulfilled.Set in an unnamed city, the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a &quot;Death Dealer,&quot; a vampire whose job is to hunt down the remaining Lycans, aka Werewolves. According to vampire history, most of the werewolves should have been wiped out in past wars, but a subway venture reveals there is still a formidable-sized population of werewolves. Against the wishes of her master, Kraven (Shane Brolly), Selene investigates further and discovers that the werewolves are particularly interested in a human named Michael (Scott Speedman).After an encounter with head werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen), Michael is bitten but saved by Selene, who grows infatuated with this human. Why, is never made clear, other than the fact that he prevents her from drowning. As Selene pries deeper into the mystery surrounding Michael, she uncovers a conspiracy involving both vampires and werewolves that could tip the balance of the war.As most people have already said, by far the movie's most memorable image is the sight of Kate Beckinsale in tight latex. For those who find her a hot babe (like me), Underworld might just be worth watching for her alone. Hell, if she'd shown some nudity, I would have even bumped my rating up 1/2. Alas, she's still great eye-candy.The picture itself is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's lots of shootouts and fight scenes that are well-staged and filmed and reasonably exciting. The werewolf effects are excellent and the transformation scenes are some of the slickest, most convincing I've seen on-screen, certainly better than anything seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London. Beckinsale, in addition to being a delectable hottie, makes for a kick-ass, first-rate female action hero.But on the other hand, Underworld is a grim, joyless picture, accentuated by its deadly serious performances and occasionally laughably earnest dialogue. Much like the Blade films, a lot of what the characters have to say is hard to take seriously, the mythology hampered by the fact that it's being juxtaposed with CGI-infested action scenes (though, admittedly, any five minutes of Blade has a much worse problem with this than all of Underworld).Underworld is neither scary nor suspenseful. Selene never really gets herself into any combative situation she can't get herself out of, usually because most of the opponents she fights aren't nearly as skilled as her. Though there are plentiful werewolf effects, I think I would have preferred more scenes of Lycans skulking around in their hulking bodies rather than watching them in human form.Undoubtedly, Scott Speedman must be one of the worst examples of a romantic leading man I've seen. He and Beckinsale have no chemistry, and considering it's her affection for him that spurs her to &quot;betray&quot; her own kind, this is a pretty damning flaw. It's also during her scenes with Speedman that Beckinsale is at her least convincing; she won me over as a kick-ass vampiress, but I had a hard time believing she was in love with this bland nobody named Michael.Directed by first-timer Len Wiseman (who apparently stole Beckinsale's heart on-set, enough that she left Michael Sheen for him), Underworld is slickly-crafted and boasts a strong, pervasive atmosphere. Maybe with more passionate performances, more well-orchestrated thrills, and some bare skin from Kate, the sequel will be an unqualified success.** 1/2 out of *****",3,"Could be better, but not unenjoyable.",1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,3777,"['introductory', 'film', 'hopefully', 'larger', 'more', 'epic', 'expansive', 'series', 'Underworld', 'requirements', 'adequately', 'enough', 'action', 'blood', 'tight', 'latex', 'outfits', 'satisfy', 'genre', 'fan', 'thirst', 'execution', 'decent', 'enough', 'look', 'forward', 'sequels', 'unmistakable', 'sense', 'promise', 'left', 'unfulfilled.Set', 'unnamed', 'city', 'gorgeous', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Selene', 'quot', 'Death', 'Dealer', 'quot', 'vampire', 'job', 'hunt', 'down', 'remaining', 'Lycans', 'aka', 'Werewolves', 'According', 'vampire', 'history', 'most', 'werewolves', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'past', 'wars', 'subway', 'venture', 'reveals', 'still', 'formidable-sized', 'population', 'werewolves', 'wishes', 'master', 'Kraven', 'Shane', 'Brolly', 'Selene', 'further', 'discovers', 'werewolves', 'are', 'particularly', 'interested', 'human', 'named', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Speedman', '.After', 'encounter', 'head', 'werewolf', 'Lucian', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Michael', 'bitten', 'saved', 'Selene', 'who', 'infatuated', 'human', 'Why', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'other', 'fact', 'drowning', 'Selene', 'deeper', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Michael', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'could', 'tip', 'balance', 'war.As', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'far', 'movie', 'most', 'memorable', 'image', 'sight', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'tight', 'latex', 'who', 'find', 'hot', 'babe', 'Underworld', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'Hell', ""'d"", 'shown', 'nudity', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'bumped', 'rating', 'up', '1/2', 'Alas', 'still', 'great', 'eye-candy.The', 'picture', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag', 'one', 'hand', 'lots', 'shootouts', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-staged', 'filmed', 'reasonably', 'exciting', 'werewolf', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'are', 'slickest', 'most', 'convincing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'on-screen', 'certainly', 'better', 'anything', 'seen', 'Howling', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Beckinsale', 'addition', 'being', 'delectable', 'hottie', 'kick-ass', 'first-rate', 'female', 'action', 'hero.But', 'other', 'hand', 'Underworld', 'grim', 'joyless', 'picture', 'accentuated', 'deadly', 'serious', 'performances', 'occasionally', 'laughably', 'earnest', 'dialogue', 'Much', 'Blade', 'films', 'lot', 'what', 'characters', 'have', 'say', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'mythology', 'hampered', 'fact', 'being', 'juxtaposed', 'CGI-infested', 'action', 'scenes', 'admittedly', 'five', 'minutes', 'Blade', 'much', 'worse', 'problem', 'Underworld', '.Underworld', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'Selene', 'never', 'really', 'combative', 'situation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'usually', 'most', 'opponents', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'skilled', 'are', 'plentiful', 'werewolf', 'effects', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'scenes', 'Lycans', 'skulking', 'around', 'hulking', 'bodies', 'rather', 'watching', 'human', 'form.Undoubtedly', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'examples', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Beckinsale', 'have', 'chemistry', 'considering', 'affection', 'quot', 'betray', 'quot', 'own', 'kind', 'pretty', 'damning', 'flaw', 'also', 'scenes', 'Speedman', 'Beckinsale', 'least', 'convincing', 'won', 'over', 'kick-ass', 'vampiress', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'was', 'love', 'bland', 'nobody', 'named', 'Michael.Directed', 'first-timer', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'who', 'apparently', 'stole', 'Beckinsale', 'heart', 'on-set', 'left', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Underworld', 'slickly-crafted', 'strong', 'pervasive', 'atmosphere', 'Maybe', 'more', 'passionate', 'performances', 'more', 'well-orchestrated', 'thrills', 'bare', 'skin', 'Kate', 'sequel', 'will', 'be', 'unqualified', 'success', '**', '1/2', '*****']",N/A

What was more surprising was to see how many low ratings this movie has received here at Amazon.I think part of the backlash is resentment over some overt 'borrowing' of material from other films.  Significant elements of Underworld's storyline have been recycled from Blade II.  The Matrix's influence on the visual style was unmistakeable and--in 2004--no longer looks fresh and original.  What's more, several of the action gags seemed oddly familiar (a leather-clad female diving head first through a tiny window (Matrix).  A bad guy stabbing through a roof with an arm-sword to get the good guys (T2).  Monsters who choose walls and ceilings in lieu of terra firma when traversing a hall (Aliens)).The underdeveloped love sub-plot didn't work for me either.  In this respect, the storyline was a little too lean and mean for its own good.  If the filmmakers expected the audience to buy off on the romance between the female vampire lead and the human, they needed to lay a better foundation.  In fairness, there were other motivations for her to do some of the things she did, but they didn't justify all of her actions (or risks) absent a romantic interest in the human (which again was underdeveloped).The creature effects for the werewolves were very good.  The one disappointment was with the hybrid vampire/werewolf.  It was supposed to have been a super monster, but it looked much less menacing than even the standard-issue werewolves.  And while it initially appeared to have physical prowess vastly superior to even the toughest vampire, that misrepresentation was quickly put to rest in the subsequent action.  After the built-up anticipation, the payoff was a bit of a letdown.Despite the negatives I've just listed, I find myself giving Underworld a thumps-up recommendation.  A tight script yields a film that hits the ground running and pretty much never stops.  If by some chance you've not seen the earlier-referenced films (alien abduction?), you might actually be blown away by this movie.  Regardless, it's worth checking out.  While Underworld may not be ground breaking, the sum of the parts add up to a fun evening in front of the home theater system.

For centuries she, and her group, the deathdealers, have been riding the world from lycons, werewolves. The war has been raging since God knows when. Now, nobody can even remember when the war began or what caused it. But everyone has the same intentions: kill the other group. For years, lycons have been growing scarce, which means that the vampires are winning. But now, the lycons are resurfacing to track an unknown human. Michael Corvin, a hospital worker, is apparently their target--but not for food. From this storyline we can get a sense that both groups want to find out more about him. Along the way there are many cool stunts, excelent history, and even a connection to science. Each person bitten, the curse of either the vampire or the werewold would get passed on like a virus. But what if a human was bitten by a werewolf . . .and a vampire? What would happen then?

He has information about an attack his people are planning against her more technologically and economically advanced society.  The soldier's commander needs her to &quot;soften up&quot; the prisoner so they can find out the details of the attack.The prisoner knows he is going to die in this interrogation cell, but he doesn't mind, because his people's uprising will bring down the &quot;superpower&quot; of his supposedly more civilized captors.The prisoner refuses to talk.  So this soldier, who has always thought of herself as the protector of her people, tortures him.  Without a moment's hesitation.  She repeatedly twists the prisoner's wounded shoulder until the pain makes him talk.This isn't a digital movie from a prison in Iraq, it's the horror film Underworld.  The soldier is Selene, a vampiric &quot;death-dealer&quot; torturing a Lycan (werewolf) prisoner.  The vampires and Lycans have been fighting for centuries and now use guns that shoot deadly silver and ultraviolet light (sunlight) at each other.Watching Underworld proves one thing - -  what's going on in the world at the time you see a movie determines what you see in it.Underworld is more interesting than I thought it would be.  For one thing, the special effects and makeup are more believable than the cartoonish CGI in movies like The Hulk, Spider-Man, and Van Helsing.  (Speaking of Van Helsing, Kate Beckinsale should take a break from vampire movies.  She's a very good actor.  See Laurel Canyon and Cold Comfort Farm.)After the vampires' equivalent of James Bond's Q designs the gun that shoots molten silver to use against the werewolves, Selene practices with it by shooting busts of William Shakespeare at the firing range.  As the liquid silver flows down Shakespeare's cheek, it looks like he's crying.The film might be saying that this decadent vampire society, which sees itself as more intellectual, more cultured, more &quot;human&quot; than the sewer-dwelling Lycans, has rejected  everything that makes civilization (and therefore themselves) worth preserving.  Or the film might be saying &quot;Old Europe&quot; and its culture aren't relevant any more - - bring on the guns and Armageddon.  Or it might be that the screenwriter was forced to take a boring Shakespeare class in high school and this is his revenge.It doesn't matter what the makers of Underworld and a lot of other movies in the last decade meant to say.  What they have said to a generation is that previously accepted rules of behavior are &quot;inoperative&quot; if they inconvenience us.  Individuals have always tortured and committed atrocities.  But if atrocity is condoned by our leaders, supposedly in a good cause, the world will turn (as Anthony Burgess warned us) quite horrorshow.",3,Shooting Shakespeare,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,2898,"['woman', 'paramilitary', 'garb', 'over', 'kneeling', 'male', 'prisoner', 'soldier', 'nation', 'threatened', 'prisoner', 'allies', 'information', 'attack', 'people', 'are', 'planning', 'more', 'technologically', 'economically', 'advanced', 'society', 'soldier', 'commander', 'quot', 'soften', 'up', 'quot', 'prisoner', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'details', 'attack.The', 'prisoner', 'going', 'die', 'interrogation', 'cell', ""n't"", 'mind', 'people', 'uprising', 'will', 'bring', 'down', 'quot', 'superpower', 'quot', 'supposedly', 'more', 'civilized', 'captors.The', 'prisoner', 'talk', 'So', 'soldier', 'who', 'always', 'thought', 'protector', 'people', 'moment', 'hesitation', 'repeatedly', 'prisoner', 'wounded', 'shoulder', 'pain', 'talk.This', ""n't"", 'digital', 'movie', 'prison', 'Iraq', 'horror', 'film', 'Underworld', 'soldier', 'Selene', 'vampiric', 'quot', 'death-dealer', 'quot', 'torturing', 'Lycan', 'werewolf', 'prisoner', 'vampires', 'Lycans', 'have', 'been', 'fighting', 'centuries', 'now', 'use', 'guns', 'shoot', 'deadly', 'silver', 'ultraviolet', 'light', 'sunlight', 'other.Watching', 'Underworld', 'one', 'thing', 'what', 'going', 'world', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'what', 'see', 'it.Underworld', 'more', 'interesting', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'special', 'effects', 'makeup', 'are', 'more', 'believable', 'cartoonish', 'CGI', 'movies', 'Hulk', 'Spider-Man', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Speaking', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'should', 'take', 'break', 'vampire', 'movies', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'See', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'Cold', 'Comfort', 'Farm', 'vampires', 'equivalent', 'James', 'Bond', 'Q', 'gun', 'molten', 'silver', 'use', 'werewolves', 'Selene', 'practices', 'shooting', 'busts', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'firing', 'range', 'liquid', 'silver', 'down', 'Shakespeare', 'cheek', 'crying.The', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'saying', 'decadent', 'vampire', 'society', 'more', 'intellectual', 'more', 'cultured', 'more', 'quot', 'human', 'quot', 'sewer-dwelling', 'Lycans', 'rejected', 'everything', 'civilization', 'therefore', 'preserving', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'saying', 'quot', 'Old', 'Europe', 'quot', 'culture', 'are', ""n't"", 'relevant', 'more', 'bring', 'guns', 'Armageddon', 'might', 'be', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'forced', 'take', 'boring', 'Shakespeare', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'revenge.It', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'makers', 'Underworld', 'lot', 'other', 'movies', 'last', 'decade', 'meant', 'say', 'What', 'have', 'said', 'generation', 'previously', 'accepted', 'rules', 'behavior', 'are', 'quot', 'inoperative', 'quot', 'inconvenience', 'Individuals', 'have', 'always', 'tortured', 'committed', 'atrocities', 'atrocity', 'condoned', 'leaders', 'supposedly', 'good', 'cause', 'world', 'will', 'turn', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', 'warned', 'quite', 'horrorshow']",N/A

Part horror/action film, this film manages to have a interesting and original storyline, fine cinematography and a good performance by Kate Beckinsale. Despite its strengths, it sometimes lacks &quot;bite&quot;.In a film inspired by THE MATRIX and THE CROW, this movie easily seperates itself from because it's about vampires and werewolves. The storyline has the two battling an ancient war for over a 1000 years. Vampire hunteress Selene(Beckinsale) rescues a ill-fated human named Michael(Scott Speedman) from Lycans, a.k.a werewolves. She then stumbles upon a conspiracy by the Lycans, who have turned Michael into one of them, in order to exterminate the vampires. Selene struggles to keep Michael from becoming a Lycan, but gets help from an ancient vampire, Victor, who isn't all he seems. Then of course there's a battle between the two races.I liked the story, but this film just plays by the numbers. This film has a dark and gloomy atmosphere, which I like, yet the film fails to be more gritty. Horror fans will be dissapointed with the lack of blood this film offers, but many may be glad with just the story, which has surprising twists and turns. The special effects aren't all that special, since there's nothing groundbreaking about it. The action wasn't really productive either, just grade B stuff. I felt sometimes this really was a low budget actioner, but it's still stylish now and then.&quot;Underworld&quot; was a film basically filled with a bunch of familar ideas which rewrites what we think of vampires and werewolves.

For Selene (Kate Beckinsale), this is a night like many others where she will seek out Lycans (werewolves), and eliminate them in accordance with a centuries old blood feud between the two mythical races.With the Lycans thought to be on the verge of extinction the vampires are preparing to form a new coven by merging with a powerful overseas clan. Towards this end, members of both houses plan to awaken one of their two great leaders to guide the vampires into a new era of prosperity. Selene is troubled by the plans, as she believes that the Lychans are massing in greater numbers under the leadership of their leader Lucian (Michael Sheen), whom the vampires believe died centuries ago.Further complicating matters is Selene&#65533;s concern that the present leader of the vampires Kraven (Shane Brolly), may not be willing to release the power he now holds and that the Lichens interest in a mortal named Michael (Scott Speedman), may indeed be the key to a larger threat to her people.Selene is forced to defy Kraven and leave the safety of the vampire mansion to locate Michael before the Lychan hordes are able to and use him for their sinister plans. While the action in &#65533;Underworld&#65533; is loud, it never seems to have the intensity that it should, as the sense of urgency and tension seems to be missing. The cast is good, but they do not display much emotional depth and this hinders the efforts of the audience to form a connection with the characters and care for their fates.That being said, &#65533;Underworld&#65533; does a fantastic job with breathing new life into the vampire genre. Director Len Wiseman bathes the viewers in images of eerie translucence that combine various color hues to create a look that enhances the action by surrounding it in an otherworldly ambience.Writers Kevin Grevioux and Danny McBride are to be commended for breathing new life into the genres as he gives us a tale that entertains yet expands upon the traditional lore of the creatures and if for nothing else, that alone makes &#65533;Underworld&#65533; pure entertainment and a must see film for fans of the genre.3 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach[...]",3,"While flawed, Underworld does offer some entertainment.",1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,2270,"['Perched', 'ledge', 'high', 'dark', 'rain', 'soaked', 'city', 'woman', 'companion', 'watch', 'wait', 'Selene', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'night', 'many', 'others', 'where', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'Lycans', 'werewolves', 'eliminate', 'accordance', 'centuries', 'old', 'blood', 'feud', 'two', 'mythical', 'races.With', 'Lycans', 'thought', 'be', 'verge', 'extinction', 'vampires', 'are', 'preparing', 'form', 'new', 'coven', 'merging', 'powerful', 'overseas', 'clan', 'end', 'members', 'houses', 'plan', 'awaken', 'one', 'two', 'great', 'leaders', 'guide', 'vampires', 'new', 'era', 'prosperity', 'Selene', 'troubled', 'plans', 'Lychans', 'are', 'massing', 'greater', 'numbers', 'leadership', 'leader', 'Lucian', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'whom', 'vampires', 'believe', 'died', 'centuries', 'ago.Further', 'complicating', 'matters', 'Selene', '65533', 's', 'concern', 'present', 'leader', 'vampires', 'Kraven', 'Shane', 'Brolly', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'willing', 'release', 'power', 'now', 'Lichens', 'interest', 'mortal', 'named', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'key', 'larger', 'threat', 'people.Selene', 'forced', 'defy', 'Kraven', 'leave', 'safety', 'vampire', 'mansion', 'locate', 'Michael', 'Lychan', 'hordes', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'sinister', 'plans', 'action', '65533', 'Underworld', '65533', 'loud', 'never', 'have', 'intensity', 'should', 'sense', 'urgency', 'tension', 'be', 'missing', 'cast', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'display', 'much', 'emotional', 'depth', 'efforts', 'audience', 'form', 'connection', 'characters', 'care', 'fates.That', 'being', 'said', '65533', 'Underworld', '65533', 'fantastic', 'job', 'breathing', 'new', 'life', 'vampire', 'genre', 'Director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'viewers', 'images', 'eerie', 'translucence', 'combine', 'various', 'color', 'hues', 'create', 'look', 'action', 'surrounding', 'otherworldly', 'ambience.Writers', 'Kevin', 'Grevioux', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'breathing', 'new', 'life', 'genres', 'tale', 'yet', 'expands', 'traditional', 'lore', 'creatures', 'nothing', 'else', 'alone', '65533', 'Underworld', '65533', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'fans', 'genre.3', '5Gareth', 'Von', 'Kallenbach', '[', ']']",N/A

784981,ABYTU7EFC5E1Y,B0000VAFNQ,"gene park ""Gene Park:  Freelance Writer/Adven...","[143, 263]","""Underworld"" has been horribly misrepresented.  It's advertising campaign promised a ""Romeo and Juliet"" love story set among a war between werewolves and vampires.  Instead, the filmmakers have given us a ""Matrix""/""Crow""/""Blade"" rip-off that is light on action, heavy on melodramatics, and big on style.Kate Beckinsale is Seline, a death-dealing vampire who has the sole purpose of hunting down the vicious lycans (calling them werewolves would be too nerdy).  Apparently, a war between the two species has been raging for centuries.  The battle strategies of these supernatural beings are most bizarre.  Instead of planning their next attack, the vampires choose to sit around their mansion drinking and looking posh while the lycans wrestle each other in the sewers.  Enter Scott Speedman as Michael, a medical intern who's being hunted by the werewolves for reasons that aren't revealed until the end of the film.  Of course, Seline reaches him first, but not before the clueless chump is bitten by a werewolf.This film is much more ""Matrix"" than anything else, and I'm not just talking about the leather outfits or the blazing gun battles or the jumping up really high in the air.  The stories of the two films are identical.  Instead of rebels and machines chasing Neo we have vamps and wolves chasing Speedman.  The problem is that ""Underworld"" is presented on a much lesser scale.  The action scenes are sparse and lack any originality.  At one point they become downright stupid as a vamp soldier fights a werewolf with two whips.  He gets eaten in a few seconds.  Maybe he should have tried two pitchforks or maybe even two unripe bananas. Between the blood and bullets, we are introduced to the various characters of the vampire and lycan clans.  I was much more interested during these moments, mostly because whenever I became bored with the talking heads I turned my attention to the stylish cinematography, the real star of this film.  If anything else, ""Underworld"" makes for great eye candy.  A warning to anyone looking for an epic, forbidden romance set between the travesties of violent conflict: the filmmakers equate the idea of a love story to Beckinsale giving Speedman a peck on the lips.  That's it.  There is no chemistry whatsoever between the two actors.  They barely come into contact with each other.Don't you think it's so cool how vampires and werewolves are totally evil, legendary monsters.  Screenwriter Danny McBride doesn't.  His reinterpretations of these classic beasts are of the lamest, failing at almost every point to use their full potential.  Instead of coming out during a full moon, the lycans can change whenever they want.  Silver bullets only work if you use about a hundred of them.  And the wolves are the more formidable of the two species.  The so-called-vampires aren't even really vampires.  They have reflections, don't drink blood, and run away like panicked deer at the first sign of danger.  Without guns, the lycans tear them apart like wet tissue paper.  It seems like the only reason McBride calls them vampires is so that there is an excuse for their gravity-defying stunts.  After having vampires updated with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the ""Blade"" films it's a letdown that this is the best McBride could imagine.Had ""Underworld"" made its debut a decade ago, it may have been the groundbreaking hit that ""The Matrix"" was.  Having come out now only makes it a rehash of things we've seen before.  Still, the style of the film and some interesting characters save it from being a straight-to-video type disaster.Grade:  C  or 2 stars out of 4.",2,Underwhelming 'World' Lacks Bite,1064620800,"09 27, 2003",2003,3611,"['Underworld', 'been', 'horribly', 'misrepresented', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'promised', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'war', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'Instead', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'given', 'Matrix', '/', 'Crow', '/', 'Blade', 'rip-off', 'light', 'action', 'heavy', 'melodramatics', 'big', 'style.Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Seline', 'death-dealing', 'vampire', 'who', 'sole', 'purpose', 'hunting', 'down', 'vicious', 'lycans', 'calling', 'werewolves', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'nerdy', 'Apparently', 'war', 'two', 'species', 'been', 'raging', 'centuries', 'battle', 'strategies', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'are', 'most', 'bizarre', 'Instead', 'planning', 'next', 'attack', 'vampires', 'choose', 'sit', 'around', 'mansion', 'drinking', 'looking', 'posh', 'lycans', 'wrestle', 'other', 'sewers', 'Enter', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Michael', 'medical', 'intern', 'who', 'being', 'hunted', 'werewolves', 'reasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'end', 'film', 'course', 'Seline', 'first', 'not', 'clueless', 'chump', 'bitten', 'werewolf.This', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'Matrix', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'leather', 'blazing', 'gun', 'battles', 'jumping', 'up', 'really', 'high', 'air', 'stories', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'identical', 'Instead', 'rebels', 'machines', 'chasing', 'Neo', 'have', 'vamps', 'wolves', 'chasing', 'Speedman', 'problem', 'Underworld', 'presented', 'much', 'lesser', 'scale', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'sparse', 'lack', 'originality', 'one', 'point', 'become', 'downright', 'stupid', 'vamp', 'soldier', 'werewolf', 'two', 'whips', 'eaten', 'few', 'seconds', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'two', 'pitchforks', 'maybe', 'even', 'two', 'unripe', 'bananas', 'blood', 'bullets', 'are', 'introduced', 'various', 'characters', 'vampire', 'lycan', 'clans', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'moments', 'mostly', 'whenever', 'became', 'bored', 'talking', 'heads', 'turned', 'attention', 'stylish', 'cinematography', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'anything', 'else', 'Underworld', 'great', 'eye', 'candy', 'warning', 'anyone', 'looking', 'epic', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'set', 'travesties', 'violent', 'conflict', 'filmmakers', 'equate', 'idea', 'love', 'story', 'Beckinsale', 'giving', 'Speedman', 'peck', 'lips', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'two', 'actors', 'barely', 'come', 'contact', 'other.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'cool', 'how', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'are', 'totally', 'evil', 'legendary', 'monsters', 'Screenwriter', 'Danny', 'McBride', ""n't"", 'reinterpretations', 'classic', 'beasts', 'are', 'lamest', 'failing', 'almost', 'point', 'use', 'full', 'potential', 'Instead', 'coming', 'out', 'full', 'moon', 'lycans', 'can', 'change', 'whenever', 'want', 'Silver', 'only', 'work', 'use', 'hundred', 'wolves', 'are', 'more', 'formidable', 'two', 'species', 'so-called-vampires', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'vampires', 'have', 'reflections', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'blood', 'run', 'away', 'panicked', 'deer', 'first', 'sign', 'danger', 'guns', 'lycans', 'tear', 'apart', 'wet', 'tissue', 'paper', 'only', 'reason', 'McBride', 'vampires', 'so', 'excuse', 'gravity-defying', 'stunts', 'having', 'vampires', 'updated', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Blade', 'films', 'letdown', 'best', 'McBride', 'could', 'imagine.Had', 'Underworld', 'made', 'debut', 'decade', 'ago', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'groundbreaking', 'hit', 'Matrix', 'was', 'Having', 'come', 'out', 'now', 'only', 'rehash', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Still', 'style', 'film', 'interesting', 'characters', 'save', 'being', 'straight-to-video', 'type', 'disaster.Grade', 'C', '2', 'stars', '4']",N/A
784982,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0000VAFNQ,General Zombie,"[2, 3]","Ah, what can you say about 'Underworld'? Most notably, it needs more action.  The biggest action scene is at the very beginning, and then we've gotta whole lot of plot for a very long time.  The action scenes are, of course, your standard John Woo knockoff, particularly this opening one.  This isn't really a criticism on my part-- If you're gonna knock of a particular action director, Woo is the way to go.  It's also hurt by the fact that the opening action scene is by far the best one in the film.  Ya gotta pace yourself, Underworld!  Still, their just isn't enough killing.  The story elements are amusing in their way, but the balance is way off.Almost equally important, 'Underworld' could really use a sense of humor.  This movie is so silly and yet it takes itself completely seriously which makes it all the more ridiculous.  If it had a bit of intentional, perhaps self-parodic humor I think I could take the whole thing quite a bit more straight-facedly.The best thing about `Underwold' is the way it looks.  The thing only cost like 23 million, and it looks completely gorgeous and totally creates the alternate, neo-gothic world that is 'Underworld'.  This film is a classic indictment of the excessive use of CGI in Hollywood, particularly for sets-- Not only does this film cost a fraction of what something like 'Revenge of the Sith' costs, it also looks WAY better.  It actually looks *real*, cause it mostly is.  It has some CGI stuff, but it holds well to my personal rule that you should always use practical, real world effects when they can do the job.  The werewolves themselves don't look so hot, but they're the only really disappointment, and the whole thing is really quite stunning considering the cost.  It's an intensely blue colored affair, but it fits the film and feels appropriate, so that's fine.  Another minor visual concern is that the film fails to differentiate between the visual nature of the vampires and the werewolves sufficiently.  More specifically, the human form werewolves lack any real particular style; they just kinda wear ratty old coats, for the most part.  The vampires are, of course, your Blade/Matrix style black leather neo-gothic night club vampires, the variant which has become utterly dominant in modern vampire cinema.  It disturbs me to think that there are probably a lot of people my age and younger who just think that this is the way vampires are, period.  Not that I particularly care for classically styled vampires or anything, I just fear they lack any perspective.  Anyway...Performances tend to be wildly over the top, as is de rigeur for modern vampire films.  Bill Nighy is especially fun as the head vampire.  Everyone is pretty hammy, but he really takes it to another level.  Kate Beckinsale is fairly bland, formless protagonist, but, on the other hand, she does spend most of the film in a leather body suit. (This fact which I believe has been mentioned in every review of 'Underworld' yet written, so far be it for me to break tradition.)  I should note that the music is generally overwrought and often irritating.  They used that glass harp or maybe just distant, squealing string sound like a trillion times here and it really gets on my nerves.I found the plot to be vaguely incomprehensible for most of the film, but it all came together eventually, so perhaps this was intentional.  Frankly, I wasn't terribly concerned with the plot.  This is a film you mostly just stare at, impressed half the time, snickering the other half.  The former impression is superior, obviously, but they both work, so it's not a total loss.Grade: C+",3,"Silly, but amusing",1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,3625,"['Ah', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""'Underworld"", 'Most', 'notably', 'more', 'action', 'biggest', 'action', 'scene', 'very', 'beginning', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'whole', 'lot', 'plot', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'course', 'standard', 'John', 'Woo', 'knockoff', 'particularly', 'opening', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'criticism', 'part', ""'re"", 'gon', 'knock', 'particular', 'action', 'director', 'Woo', 'way', 'go', 'also', 'hurt', 'fact', 'opening', 'action', 'scene', 'far', 'best', 'one', 'film', 'Ya', 'got', 'ta', 'pace', 'Underworld', 'Still', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'killing', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'amusing', 'way', 'balance', 'way', 'off.Almost', 'equally', 'important', ""'Underworld"", 'could', 'really', 'use', 'sense', 'humor', 'movie', 'so', 'silly', 'yet', 'completely', 'seriously', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'had', 'bit', 'intentional', 'perhaps', 'self-parodic', 'humor', 'think', 'could', 'take', 'whole', 'thing', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'straight-facedly.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Underwold', 'way', 'thing', 'only', 'cost', '23', 'million', 'completely', 'gorgeous', 'totally', 'alternate', 'neo-gothic', 'world', ""'Underworld"", 'film', 'classic', 'indictment', 'excessive', 'use', 'CGI', 'Hollywood', 'particularly', 'sets', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'cost', 'fraction', 'what', 'something', ""'Revenge"", 'Sith', 'costs', 'also', 'WAY', 'better', 'actually', '*real*', 'cause', 'mostly', 'CGI', 'stuff', 'well', 'personal', 'rule', 'should', 'always', 'use', 'practical', 'real', 'world', 'effects', 'when', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'werewolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'hot', ""'re"", 'only', 'really', 'disappointment', 'whole', 'thing', 'really', 'quite', 'stunning', 'considering', 'cost', 'intensely', 'blue', 'colored', 'affair', 'film', 'feels', 'appropriate', 'fine', 'minor', 'visual', 'concern', 'film', 'differentiate', 'visual', 'nature', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'sufficiently', 'More', 'specifically', 'human', 'form', 'werewolves', 'lack', 'real', 'particular', 'style', 'just', 'kinda', 'wear', 'ratty', 'old', 'coats', 'most', 'part', 'vampires', 'are', 'course', 'Blade/Matrix', 'style', 'black', 'leather', 'neo-gothic', 'night', 'club', 'vampires', 'variant', 'become', 'utterly', 'dominant', 'modern', 'vampire', 'cinema', 'think', 'are', 'probably', 'lot', 'people', 'age', 'younger', 'who', 'just', 'think', 'way', 'vampires', 'are', 'period', 'Not', 'particularly', 'care', 'classically', 'styled', 'vampires', 'anything', 'just', 'fear', 'lack', 'perspective', 'Anyway', 'Performances', 'tend', 'be', 'wildly', 'top', 'de', 'rigeur', 'modern', 'vampire', 'films', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'especially', 'fun', 'head', 'vampire', 'Everyone', 'pretty', 'hammy', 'really', 'level', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'fairly', 'bland', 'formless', 'protagonist', 'other', 'hand', 'spend', 'most', 'film', 'leather', 'body', 'suit', 'fact', 'believe', 'been', 'mentioned', 'review', ""'Underworld"", 'yet', 'written', 'far', 'be', 'break', 'tradition', 'should', 'note', 'music', 'generally', 'overwrought', 'often', 'irritating', 'used', 'glass', 'harp', 'maybe', 'just', 'distant', 'squealing', 'string', 'sound', 'trillion', 'times', 'here', 'really', 'nerves.I', 'found', 'plot', 'be', 'vaguely', 'incomprehensible', 'most', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'eventually', 'so', 'perhaps', 'was', 'intentional', 'Frankly', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'concerned', 'plot', 'film', 'mostly', 'just', 'stare', 'impressed', 'time', 'snickering', 'other', 'half', 'former', 'impression', 'superior', 'obviously', 'work', 'not', 'total', 'loss.Grade', 'C+']",N/A

I watched it while I was scanning a book for a publisher, and it was a good minor distraction from the mechanical drudgery of picking and placing paper into the scanner, since there wasn't that much plot to follow, so if I missed anything, it didn't matter.The movie opens with a commentary by &quot;Selene&quot;, a &quot;Death Dealer&quot; mentioning &quot;Lycans&quot; and a &quot;war&quot;, and the next two thirds of the picture are essentially Matrix-style gunfights and chases, peppered with occasional respites when the director and scriptwriter seem to run out of &quot;Ok, what can we shoot at or blow up next?&quot; ideas.After about two-thirds of the picture, you finally get to find out what's actually going on, who is fighting whom, and why the previous hour-and-fifteen-minutes of bang-bang-boom-boom has been happening.  By that time, you may not care.Cinematically, it's &quot;Matrix&quot; meets &quot;Clothing by Leather Masters&quot;, shot in a uniformly gray-blue color scheme that leaves every battlefield in the movie looking like every other.The only saving grace in this whole pointless and uninvolving exercise are the shots of Kate Beckinsale's face.

Slight over-acting in spots by Speedman, but overall he plays very well off of the rest of the cast.The directing is just as superb.

For those expecting a love story, look somewhere else. ""Underworld"" does indeed translate the background of Shakespeare's tragedy into sci-fi terms: the feuding Montagues and Capulets have become vampire and werewolf clans, and Romeo and Juliet themselves are supernatural killing machines. The difference between the 14th century Italian and 21st century gothic tales is that ""Underworld"" is composed of characters too tough and serious to ever express love. If Selene (vampire) and Michael (werewolf) are hiding their emotions, they are doing so in a manner too subtle to catch my attention. Luckily, numerous dialogues between Selene and her vampire kin have been placed to fill in the blanks as to her apparent affections, since the entire cast has caught on to what viewers will miss. By the time they make physical contact - an unexpected scene lasting under a minute - this element of the movie is no longer surprising or interesting.

Underworld is just that. The documentary on werewolves and vampires is enlightening enough, you can get the DVD just for that. If you're a budding filmmaker or comic book fan/artist, the sketches and making of features are very educational. That alone gives the film three stars.The film itself, is simply trying-hard kewl. Having been a massive consumer of graphic novels, comic books and cheesy sci-fi/action/adventure/fantasy films from pre-pubescence to adulthood, I lowered my ""standards"" (if there's any) and expected some rip-roaring fanboy fun ala Riddick and Van Helsing (see my reviews). Boy, was I disappointed. The convoluted story aside (a staple in the comic-book genre), I was turned-off by the director's penchant for pretentious poses and making the camera linger so the audience can appreciate how cool his shots are (it is cool and has great lighting, in fairness, but does he have to be so obvious?). It seems he was trying very hard to out-Blade Blade and out-Matrix The Matrix. Too bad, the plot was kind of interesting yet his storytelling made it as hazy as a Transylvanian fog.  The revelation that reveals the true relationship of vampires and Lycans was also interesting but somehow became anti-climactic because of the numerous and heavy-handed foreshadowings, to make sure the viewer gets it.

Without some fleeting half-creativity the entire film is an all out rip-off of the ultra-far superior BLADE (1&amp;2), and borrows some inspiration from THE MATRIXes.The direction is slipshod.  Obviously lensed by a first timer working with an amateur script.  I can't believe they are already filming not one but TWO sequels.  Totally unnessesary.Check out the flick DOG SOLDIERS instead.

Hyde is right in stating that the movie is an ACTION movie with horror overtones, but unfortunately it is TOO much on the action front. Not that I totally dislike action flicks, but if I go to see a movie billed as a horror movie, that is what I expect.Cast/Characters : Beckinsale is a tremendous actress, but not in this role. The word mousey comes to mind, no matter how much black leather she wears or how many guns she carries around. Give her some Shakespeare and see her true calling.Story/Plot : I enjoyed the whole concept of the movie, that the battle has been waged for many years. It's always good to have the bad guys duking it out. Also making everything modern worked well, too.Pace : Very poor pace on this film. You would have this long, drawn out dramatic scene and just when it built up to it's peak BAM!, scene change. Far too much jumping from situation to situation.....even I got lost a few times in the movie.

This story jumps us right into the middle of a centuries old conflict and weaves it's way back into the past to bring the viewer up to speed. The premise is unique and it works. A refreshing break from the traditional genre that has been overworked to the point of boredom. &quot;Underworld&quot; jump starts the outdated story to the future using modern technology to jolt the carnage from two insatiable groups of killers. The twists of politically motivated schemes boil down to the same ole' motivation; love and power. Familial conflict and monsterous actions even for the undead make for an interesting storyline. But in the end, the story runs out of gas, for trying to show the many fascinating, and grotesque transformations and mutilations. Too much emphasis is placed on the visual and the storyline is left to unravel and then the obligatory underdog David slays Golieth ending. This movie is so close to being a new classic that could have built a franchise to rival any available.

In brief: a blood-feud war between vampires and werewolves; the viral strains of these outcasts and the possible intermingling of abomination-breeds; the historical elements detailing the cause of the conflict: although not exactly new or original, the alchemic combination of these ideas suggest vast potential, and practically beg for an expert treatment such as that given the recent blockbuster phenomenon of Lord of the Rings.  Alas, this film comes off rather a harrowing example of squandered opportunities and inept direction, the dismal end-result of rigorous conformity to the ethic of 'style over substance.'A breakdown of the major faults:STORY: The core concepts are modern-era mythic (always a plus) and brim with melodramatic possibility, but the actual script execution is muddled and/or obtuse, structural information delivered either too sparsely or without the necessary passion; the dialogue flat, unoriginal and uninspired, and so, so deathly serious.  The Vampires come off as lethargic [perhaps the result of conqueror's indolence?] weaklings [inexcusable for supposed 'immortals'] who have to rely on gunplay to dispatch their enemies - all in all a nice excuse to ape the Matrix to the hilt.DIRECTION/CINIMATOGRAPHY: Technically, this film is a murky mess, with all the usual suspects included: MTV editing, sloppy framing and the occasionally horrid angle-confusion, an enormous overuse of digital grading.  Nearly the entire film is colored in nighttime blue, which becomes increasingly dull and stullifying as the story grinds towards its predictable peak (at least the Wachoski Bros. are aware of the power of contrasting colors); when coupled with the aggrandizing camera shots, the excess of shadow, the choppy editing to 'excite' (and hide), alongside some laughable moments of CGI, Underworld is a textbook example of how to attempt an epic via style over substance - and ultimately fail in engaging the participant.ACTION: Blood-pumping? Nail-biting? Jaw-dropping? Sorry, none of the above.  I couldn't help but play ""spot the influence"" to overcome the threatening sleep-tides of ennui.  A snippy smattering of the famous action sequences Underworld blatantly rips off: The Matrix (obvious), The Matrix Reloaded (Trinity bullet-time flip), Terminator 2 (chase scene), X-Men 1 (Beckinsale's inexplicable swoon/car crash), Equilibrium (face slide), Blade 2 (final showdown).  And even when the film is not engaging in full-blown celluloid plagiarism, the action sequences suffer from weak pacing, poor editing and some absolute incompetence regarding weaponry and combat-tactics.  The scene where a nameless vamp takes on a lycin with two bullwhips is a prominent example.  Instead of using the whips to debilitate his foe (uprooting a leg, dislocation of an arm, spinning the whip around the neck to choke or at least attempt dominance of), the vamp simply swings both whips around in an impressive but ultimately futile grandstanding display of practice-strokes, and pays the price accordingly.  It looks cool, but fails to elect any sort of tension or violent 'rush' -again, style over substance.ACTING: Some actors/actresses are able to overcome the shoddy character-building or trite dialogue of a mediocre script by way of sheer charisma or craft-experience.  Kate Beckinsale, reported to be a talented actress, is not one of those rare paragons of dramatic impersonation.  There's little required for Beckinsale other than the twin stoic reliance of serious/slightly pouty; she isn't given the time or dialogue to sell her tragic past, and the chemistry between her and Speedman is nearly non-existent.  Her character is essentially her leather outfit, cute bob haircut, and twin firepower skills - in other words, style over substance.  Scott Speedman's doctor/lychin, meanwhile, remains passive throughout, thrown into one situation after another like any stereo-archetypical ""chosen one"", a rote mold made all the more boring by the Matrix Reloaded's expert deconstruction of the savior/slave role.  The fellow who plays Victor chews the scenery with gusto and adds a much-welcome dollop of humor to this bleak affair, while 'Kraven' tries to do the same and his howlingly-bad performance jars the viewing experience.I always give credit where credit is due: the film looks marvelous given its relatively measly budget of $23 million, and several of the core concepts were initially promising.  The potential was there.  But the astonishingly poor execution from those involved rendered this vampire tale flatline on delivery.  If you must, eat fistfuls of garlic before braving a view of *Underworld* - the subsequent hyper-jolt might actually make this more the sum of its incompetent parts.",2,"Interesting Concepts,

Nothing here is going to illuminate the human condition or discuss any sort of heavy philosophy that much of good science fiction is renowned for. Ignoring that, and rating this movie purely in the escapism genre, we thing it rates fairly highly. It will be interesting to see if an audience develops for this film. The thing was absolutely crushed by negative reviews (a pity because Beckinsale is really so good in this film) and it did not do well at the box office. If it had just a little more going for it then we might feel more confident about it achieving a kind of cult status. As it is, we think the merits of the film might go unrecognized. It will do little to change the genre.WHO SHOULD WATCH:For those of you looking for more excitement and less deep thought, Underworld is a fine, fine choice. Don't watch the Blade films. Ignore the myriad marshal-arts inspired works. This is a movie of real worth that delivers given the limitations of the super-action genre. It feels much more like The Crow than anything else and people who enjoyed that film we feel will like this a great deal as well.WHO SHOULD AVOID:Provocative philosophy is wholly absent here. Movies that deal in this style and that subject matter are firmly in the domain of The Matrix and The Ghost in the Shell among others. This is the sort of movie that improves with a couple of beers to urge along the suspension of disbelief and allow for that immersive joy that some action movies are able to deliver. Another segment of audience that should avoid this film is that particular group that enjoys the romantic vampire. There is no romantic vampire here. None. Gone are the seductions, the languid coolness, and the deviousness of popularized vampires of the Bram Stoker come Anne Rice world. These vampires shoot guns. They're not very devious. There is a certain formality and decadence to the culture that reminds one of decaying Rome, which is a strong selling point to the overall plot and should've been explored more, but that is the only similarity to those pulp-fiction vampires.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM",4,A very good super-action offering,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,2139,"['movie', '100', '%', 'action', 'Nothing', 'here', 'going', 'illuminate', 'human', 'condition', 'discuss', 'sort', 'heavy', 'philosophy', 'much', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'renowned', 'Ignoring', 'rating', 'movie', 'purely', 'escapism', 'genre', 'thing', 'rates', 'fairly', 'highly', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'audience', 'develops', 'film', 'thing', 'was', 'absolutely', 'crushed', 'negative', 'reviews', 'pity', 'Beckinsale', 'really', 'so', 'good', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'going', 'then', 'might', 'feel', 'more', 'confident', 'achieving', 'kind', 'cult', 'status', 'think', 'merits', 'film', 'might', 'go', 'unrecognized', 'will', 'do', 'little', 'change', 'genre.WHO', 'SHOULD', 'WATCH', 'looking', 'more', 'excitement', 'less', 'deep', 'thought', 'Underworld', 'fine', 'fine', 'choice', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Blade', 'films', 'myriad', 'marshal-arts', 'inspired', 'works', 'movie', 'real', 'worth', 'delivers', 'given', 'limitations', 'super-action', 'genre', 'much', 'more', 'Crow', 'anything', 'else', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'feel', 'will', 'like', 'great', 'deal', 'well.WHO', 'SHOULD', 'AVOID', 'Provocative', 'philosophy', 'wholly', 'absent', 'here', 'Movies', 'deal', 'style', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'firmly', 'domain', 'Matrix', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'others', 'sort', 'movie', 'couple', 'beers', 'urge', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'allow', 'immersive', 'joy', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'able', 'deliver', 'segment', 'audience', 'should', 'avoid', 'film', 'particular', 'group', 'romantic', 'vampire', 'romantic', 'vampire', 'here', 'None', 'Gone', 'are', 'seductions', 'languid', 'coolness', 'deviousness', 'popularized', 'vampires', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'come', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'world', 'vampires', 'shoot', 'guns', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'devious', 'certain', 'formality', 'decadence', 'culture', 'one', 'decaying', 'Rome', 'strong', 'selling', 'point', 'overall', 'plot', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'explored', 'more', 'only', 'similarity', 'pulp-fiction', 'vampires.READ', 'THE', 'ENTIRE', 'REVIEW', 'AT', 'INCHOATUS.COM']",N/A
785005,A319SKSB556033,B0000VAFNQ,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[7, 15]","Take Blade and add most of The Crow and The Matrix and you have this. The latter two I didn't particularly enjoy and Underworld was just as dull and messy as the trailer made it out to be.Amidst a clutter of cliched sets, impossible to differentiate from each other, and heavily overused lightning and rain (I'm sure there are OTHER ways of creating a gothic atmosphere) an uninteresting and meandering plot slowly fizzles to life. Apparently Vampires and Werewolves have been fighting for years but a couple of them want the war to end. But with no indication of who is good and bad and the lack of a clearly defined hero there's no way to engage with the characters and no reason to care what happens to them.The SFX are of the jumping thru the air in slow motion while spinning and shooting and doing the laundry variety. Nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. It wasn't interesting the first hundred times I saw it and this movie is no exception.As you might expect from a movie of this sort, the music is nothing but someone murdering a thrash metal guitar. It's just noise and chaos that matches the incoherent blur onscreen. Many elements of this film lead to exciting possibilities but they've all been thrown away in favor of easy trash. Technically efficient it may well be but Underworld is a failure on every other level.And what's with the title. At no point in the entire movie is there interaction with the 'real' world. Just a load of running around in sewers and darkly lit mansion corridors. The sense of having an insight into a world that is not meant to be seen by human eyes is non-existent. Even the kidnapped human acts as if the discovery of Vampires and Werewolves is nothing to out of the ordinary.Highlyclichedlookinggothicmovieworld would have been a more appropriate title.The one star is purely for Kate Beckinsdale in a leather outfit.I have the DTS Region 3 edition of this movie.

785009,A2TOX3E4WZ8BSQ,B0000VAFNQ,"Ivan K. Samuelson ""Bolski""","[2, 3]","Underworld, for those not in the know, is a Vampires vs. Werewolves (Lycans) movie. My first initial reaction to it when I saw the previews on TV were, &quot;Oh no! Not another Matrix ripoff!&quot;The scene where Kate Beckinsale's character shoots through the floor to drop down to the floor below it, as well as the shoot out in the subway, scream &quot;Matrix&quot;. The sad thing is that those two scenes alone almost do an injustice to the movie for those that have not truely given it a chance. Other than those two scenes, the movie itself is NOT a Matrix ripoff. It only borrows some ideas from the Matrix series.I'm glad that I finally went and purchased the DVD and watched the movie. It was refreshing and a twist in the plot had me going.Underworld has a story line to it, unlike Matrix Reloaded (which I still enjoyed, BTW). Rather than throwing in a lot of action and trying to weave a story into it, this movie has a story with the action supporting the story. The darkness of the sets helps to bring out the broodishness of the war between the two factions. In many respects, it reminded me of The Crow and the first two Batman movies, giving a Gothic feel to it, which sets the tone for the movie.For fans looking for a fast-paced action movie, you might want to look elsewhere. This movie is more about a war between two factions that hate each other. At first, you are given the belief that there is no known reason for the war except that there is an extreme hatred between Vampires and Lycans, but clues are given as the movie advances and the real reason will eventually be revealed, and for me, it was out of left field! Who do you root for? The Vamps or the Lycans? You decide!The only problem I have is that the Vampires cast reflections! For me, that is such an integral part of the Vampire lore, but I can overlook it in this case. Also, it might seem weird with Vampires and Lycans shooting at each other, but the ammunition is not your standard grade of ammo. It's actually ingenious with the types of ammo they came up with for this movie. Why shouldn't the Vampires and Lycans be with the times?

And yet there is something that floats over the whole thing, that survives the animal horror that animates these pictures and bleak places. Two species have been fighting for centuries and the salvation of both is in a new blood line that will cross the two different ones. Peace can only come from crossing the bloodlines of the two rivals, the two enemies, the two antagons. And that works, in the film of course, because in reality if it were that simple...! It has been noticed that when a civil war starts we never know when it will stop. It took some thirty years for the latest episode of the Irish civil war to come to maybe an end and that was only the last episode of a war that was started by the invasion and conquest of Ireland by the English three or four centuries ago. And I will not speak of the Bosnian or Kosovar conflicts, nor of the opposition between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq and in the world. But that's the optimistic final scene of a film that targets teenagers when war comes to an end because the two bloodlines have been mixed in the veins of a new leader.

Well of course she falls for this guy and the plot gets more intense as it moves along between betrayal, power struggles and internal conflict which brings the film to an interesting (and bloody of course) end.

So a movie pitting the two against each other was just to much for me to resist! Was I disappointed?Hell, no!Despite all the bad rap this movie got as a horror clone to ""The Matrix,"" fighting sequences, guns, the Vampire's black dress, especially, Selene's, this movie is it's own film. Filled with action, great effects, good story line, & fast paced, ""Underworld"" put a stake right through my heart! Especially good was Michael Sheen's character, ""Lucian,"" feral, but sophisticated, he stole the show as the leader of the Lycans. Also particularly good was Bill Nighy's, ""Viktor,"" one of the three leaders of the Vampire clan. His character was at once commanding, intelligent, & sublimely evil, all that you could want from a Vampire!Kate Beckinsale's main character, ""Selene,"" was very well done in portraying hard determination of hunting Lycan's without mercy. Digging out Kraven's plans to take over the Vampire clan using Lycans, but also an undeniable vulnerability toward Scott Speedman's other main character, ""Michael Corvin."" Michael Corvin was descended from the original immortal, Alexander Corvinus, who the Lycans feel will end the long war between them & the Vampires, by combing the cells of the two species into a super hybrid.Also in this Blu-ray version there is about an extra five minutes of footage that really helps flesh things out.I do have some complaints though. Scott Speedman's, ""Michael Corvin"" character was the weakest link in the chain acting wise, but I suppose in retrospect this was intended, for he had not a clue what was happing to him. Shane Brolly's character, ""Kraven"" was shrill & shallow, one wonders how he could orchestrate a coup over the Vampire clan, but also in retrospect, his character seems to fit in with the movie the more times it's viewed. I was disappointed in the lack of tooth & fang Vampire, Lycan confrontation, opting instead for guns & technology, but then again, retrospect wise, we don't fight our wars with sticks & stones anymore, so why should the Vampires & Lycans? One more thing, where are the female Lycans? Not nary a one to be seen in this film? With all this hairy tooth & fang machismo ""Rin Tin Tin"" going on, I think these male werewolves would enjoy a little soft furry support from a hot Lassie???All in all though, this movie satisfies the horror fan in me, there is some flaws, but only enough for me to fault this movie very little.

785017,A24D0DENA8N7GH,B0000VAFNQ,James Sadler,"[5, 8]","I really wanted to like this movie, a lot. First, it has Kate Beckinsale, who I have loved and followed ever since she appeared in ""Cold Comfort Farm"" (hopefully my wife understands). She's pretty, personable, and, in this film, very sexy looking. But for whatever reason the director fails to take advantage of her presence.As far as plot goes, apparently vampires and werewolves, or as they are called in the film, lycans, have been at war for centuries. Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire who specializes in hunting and killing lycans. Early in the movie, she discovers that lycans are tracking a human, Scott Speedman, but can't figure out why (and guess what, she's a very high tech vamp).  Her curiosity causes her to come into conflict with the present leaders of the vampires and to, naturally, meet and fall in love with Speedman.As the story progresses, she uncovers a plot to overthrow the current vampire hierarchy and, in the one clever twist to the plot, also learns that she may have more in the common with the lycans than she thought.The film is beautifully shot in a blue tint, but for some reason, its almost constantly raining throughout the film. Apparently vampires don't have to worry about black mold problems in their homes. There also seem to be problems with the passage of time. It seems obvious that all the action is taking place over several days, but its always night throughout the film and we never get any indication that daylight has come and gone.It is also apparent that all the action is taking place in an old, unnamed European city (Budapest in reality), but apparently Americans are studying medicine there with no language difficulties. Speedman appears to be a med student and works at a hosptial with other Americans.The special effects are, well, not too special and the overall plot is just trying to be way too clever for its own good. The filmmakers clearly want to keep us guessing about exactly what is going on throughout the movie, but its obvious in watching the actors who is going to turn out to be a bad guy (a relative term in a film about werewolves and vampires). Moreover, other than Beckinsale, most of the acting is pretty bad.There are also plenty of illogical moments, particularly given the wealth of vampire lore with which most viewers would be familiar. At one point Speedman saves Beckinsale from drowning and essentially resusitates her. Excuse me, but aren't vampires pretty much immortal and capable of being killed by only a limited number of means? Last time I checked, drowning was not among them. And other than Beckinsale and a few other key characters, these have got to be some of the wimpiest vampires to appear on celluloid.The film also seems to strain against its budget, esspecially in the special effects department.

785022,A1RMGC6CMJBNTU,B0000VAFNQ,Jason Koenig,"[4, 11]","Think a film about a war between vampires and werewolves sounds cool?  Think again.The vampires in UNDERWORLD have no supernatural powers to speak of, beyond the fact that they're immortal and have superhuman strength.  Instead of using stealth, cunning, and teeth they fight with lots and lots of guns.The werewolves don't fare much better.  In addition to being immortal and having superhuman strength, the werewolves (called ""lycans"" in the film, short for lycanthropes) have the ability to change their form regardless of whether or not the moon is full.  However, the change is little more than cosmetic, as they don't get any stronger.  They grow sharp claws and teeth, but can't hold a gun in wolf form so it's pretty much a wash.  Their preferred method of fighting is - you guessed it - lots and lots of guns (in human form).So basically UNDERWORLD takes a really cool concept, removes everything cool about it, and gives us a standard issue post-MATRIX shoot-em-up.  Only problem here is we don't know which side to root for as neither side has any agenda regarding the fate of humans - in fact neither side has any use for humans at all (the vampires drink cloned blood in bags, the werewolves just eat whatever).  So although we'd like the protagonists to survive, we couldn't care less about whatever cause they're fighting for, if any.2 stars for impressive effects and Kate Beckinsale in tight leather.

First of all, this is a great DVD from a picture and surround sound viewpoint, allowing you to enjoy the great special effects, stunts, and delightfully gloom sets. Seeing the Widescreen really made it more impressive than a first viewing on satellite TV. Some of the stunts (and costumes) will remind you of the Matrix.The plot moves quickly and tells a old story with some really enjoyable and intriguing twists on vampires and werewolves. The story is suspensful, as you work to figure out who is good and bad, but the twists are also logical which makes them all the more fun. There is some mild gore and a good bit of nicely stylized violence, but the violence never overwhelms the action and the acting nor does it seem overdone or gratuitous. Overall, I thought this was a good blend of action, horror and suspense. My wife and I have shown it several times to friends, and we enjoy it more and see more details each time we see it. We really hope that a sequel does appear, because this movie was a lot of fun.

If you love vampires or werewolves this one has them both in spades! Add a ton of action and yes romance thrown into the mix and you have Underworld.The Death Dealers (vampires) are pitted against the Lycans (werewolves) in a literal age old blood feud with one fraction fighting to destroy the other at all costs. Both have major strategic strong points and weaknesses the werewolves are strong and viral, the vampires are equally strong and with increasing weaponry tech seem to be slowly gaining the upper hand on the werewolves. Thus leading the Lycans to search for the original strain of their origin a direct descendant of the Corvinus clan to strengthen them and help them gain the upper hand on the vampires once and for all.  They finally track down a human Michael Corvin who is indeed a direct descendant from the Corvinus line. But when the lycans go to kidnap him a death dealer named Selene sees them and nabs him first wondering what the Lycans could possibly be wanting with this particular human. She takes him back to the coven and things go majorly awry for them all from there. The vampires are not happy with Selene for bringing this outsider into their inner sanctum and they are even more enraged when Selene takes it upon herself to awaken one of the Vampire Elders Viktor to seek his guidance in what to do about the plot that she has stumbled upon with the Lycans.Along the way Selene and Michael begin to have feelings for one another and plots are uncovered that turn both of their worlds upside down and test loyalties with all involved.Think of it kind of like Romeo and Juliet with fangs and fur - and a better ending!Kate Beckinsale is just awesome in this as Selene. She totally proved to everyone that she could kick butt and take names with this one. (I so want one of those long leather trench coats with the vampire knotwork on the back like she wears soooo bad LOL.)This truly is one that is both thrilling, romantic, and just an all around great action packed fun ride. I loved it from the first time I saw it, and it remains one of my all time favorites that I find myself re-watching again and again. This is one movie that my husband and I agree on we both adore it.If you haven't seen this one yet I highly recommend it!

Pretty much, the vampires and the werewolves are having a war that has lasted for centuries. The werewolves have a plot to create a hybrid species between the vampires and werewolves, which will be stronger than both. Although the real plot is more complicated than that, thats it in a nutshell. I really thought the storyline was interesting all the way through, and the acting was pretty good.

This movie really didn't pay any homage to old Vampire/Werewolf mythology, it didn't really have much action, and the Romeo & Juliet thing is not really expressed and there's only one kiss between the two main people.

785052,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0000VAFNQ,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 2]","I watched this movie on cable, and when I went to pro.imdb.com to see if it had been released to theaters or was a direct to DVD release, I was surprised to see that it had opened in the theaters with twenty million, made fifty million total in the U.S., and added another forty-five million in DVD/Video rentals! I honestly thought, given what I perceived to be some imperfections, that it may have been a direct to DVD release.While watching the film I was impressed by the lighting, the cinematography, costumes (although why Selene was often dressed like Catwoman didn't make much sense), artwork - in other words, the things that make a film look good. I was also intrigued by the concept of a vampire/werewolf hybrid.However, if I hadn't read in the movie guide that this was a film about hybrids, I would have been lost. Vampires and werewolves looked the same to me. Perhaps there was a bulging of teeth that the vampires had that the werewolves didn't - truthfully, I don't remember. What I do remember was Lucian - as a human - biting another human and turning him.There is an interesting twist in the storyline that I didn't see coming, and so I give praise to the writer(s) for that. However, the story sagged in many places.This is a story about werewolves and vampires. Why did it look like they were cowboys and Indians, having long drawn out shoot-outs? Vampires and werewolves have extraordinary powers: *use them*! I understand that the vampires were shooting with silver bullets, which are anathema to werewolves and perhaps their best weapon (in that movie) against them, and that the werewolves MAY have been shooting the bullets made of concentrated daylight (neat idea - but it wasn't developed at all), but still: battles between vampires and werewolves would have made for more exciting action. When a werewolf attacked Viktor, and he caught it by its throat, there was real tension. The first real tension I experienced, in fact, regarding the feud between werewolves and vampires. That tension came far too late in the film. During the gunfights, there was no tension. For me, gunfights lost their appeal somewhere after The Lone Ranger.Also, Selene goes to great risk to save Michael, whom she apparently loves, but aside from the fact that she's hot, and he's hot, I have no idea why they liked each other. Sure, this is a ""monster movie"", but if there's going to be a love interest that is *really* the center of the story (think about it - if Selene didn't have feelings for Michael, there wouldn't have been a story to tell), then we need to know more about it.All of my complaining aside, I did enjoy the film; especially the intriguing plot twist and the climax. Interestingly, there wasn't much of a d&eacute;nouement - just a climax. I guess the d&eacute;nouement was Selene's voice-over telling us that there would be a sequel although, of course, she didn't use those words. And there will be a sequel.The hybrid concept was terrific - and the result of that experiment was, for lack of better description, really cool. For that reason alone I'll see the sequel. I just hope it's not another round of cowboys and Indians.",3,"Vampires and werewolves, not cowboys and Indians",1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,3159,"['watched', 'movie', 'cable', 'when', 'went', 'pro.imdb.com', 'see', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'had', 'opened', 'theaters', 'twenty', 'million', 'made', 'fifty', 'million', 'total', 'U.S.', 'added', 'forty-five', 'million', 'DVD/Video', 'rentals', 'honestly', 'thought', 'given', 'what', 'perceived', 'be', 'imperfections', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release.While', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'impressed', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'why', 'Selene', 'was', 'often', 'dressed', 'Catwoman', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'artwork', 'other', 'words', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'good', 'was', 'also', 'intrigued', 'concept', 'vampire/werewolf', 'hybrid.However', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'movie', 'guide', 'was', 'film', 'hybrids', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'Vampires', 'werewolves', 'looked', 'same', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'bulging', 'teeth', 'vampires', 'had', 'werewolves', 'did', ""n't"", 'truthfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'What', 'do', 'remember', 'was', 'Lucian', 'human', 'biting', 'human', 'turning', 'him.There', 'interesting', 'twist', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'so', 'give', 'praise', 'writer', 's', 'However', 'story', 'sagged', 'many', 'places.This', 'story', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'Why', 'did', 'look', 'were', 'cowboys', 'Indians', 'having', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'shoot-outs', 'Vampires', 'werewolves', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'powers', '*use', 'them*', 'understand', 'vampires', 'were', 'shooting', 'silver', 'bullets', 'are', 'anathema', 'werewolves', 'perhaps', 'best', 'weapon', 'movie', 'werewolves', 'MAY', 'have', 'been', 'shooting', 'bullets', 'made', 'concentrated', 'daylight', 'neat', 'idea', 'was', ""n't"", 'developed', 'still', 'battles', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'exciting', 'action', 'When', 'werewolf', 'attacked', 'Viktor', 'caught', 'throat', 'was', 'real', 'tension', 'first', 'real', 'tension', 'experienced', 'fact', 'regarding', 'feud', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'tension', 'came', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'film', 'gunfights', 'was', 'tension', 'gunfights', 'lost', 'appeal', 'somewhere', 'Lone', 'Ranger.Also', 'Selene', 'great', 'risk', 'save', 'Michael', 'whom', 'apparently', 'aside', 'fact', 'hot', 'hot', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'liked', 'other', 'Sure', 'monster', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'center', 'story', 'think', 'Selene', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'feelings', 'Michael', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'story', 'tell', 'then', 'need', 'know', 'more', 'it.All', 'complaining', 'aside', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'twist', 'climax', 'Interestingly', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'just', 'climax', 'guess', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'was', 'Selene', 'voice-over', 'telling', 'would', 'be', 'sequel', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'words', 'will', 'be', 'sequel.The', 'hybrid', 'concept', 'was', 'terrific', 'result', 'experiment', 'was', 'lack', 'better', 'description', 'really', 'cool', 'reason', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'see', 'sequel', 'just', 'hope', 'not', 'round', 'cowboys', 'Indians']",N/A

But this is an action-thriller and details like that often suffer so one expects it.  The only real problem I had with the film was the way it felt like it was setting up a larger story.  With the success of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies one can certainly believe that such an attempt could be possible.  We shall see.  One thing I really liked was they way the two societies were portrayed.  While equally intelligent the vampires acted like aristocrats while the werewolves were far more bestial.

The execution wasn't.""Underworld"" drops you into this story without so much as a compass to guide you. Important elements in the standard vampire and werewolf mythos - what hurts them, what powers do they have (and apparently the vampires have none!) - are drastically modified, which is fine it itself. But most of these changes are never explained or addressed. You could figure it out on your own if it were not inconsistently applied even within the movie!Kate Beckinsale is capable and solid and certainly was the perfect choice for the role as it was (probably) originally conceived. But the writing is so sparse that her character is two-dimensional at best. Her Selene is beautiful but not attractive because there is not much of anyone there to care about. Her motivation for hunting the Lycans (and please note the spelling kids - it's based on the word 'lycanthrope') is given not in flashbacks but in brief expository dialogue delivered to the thinnest character in the film - her human 'love interest'. Their relationship is inexplicable.The movie partially redeems itself with the finale, which is clever and sometimes even original.

785066,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0000VAFNQ,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","Six years before ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" fully revealed the origins of a war between vampires and lycans, we were flung head-long into the fray with 2003's surprise hit ""Underworld"".""Underworld"" follows Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire who is a member of an elite group of lycan hunters known as ""Death Dealers"". As the centuries-old blood feud between the two races rages on, Selene and her fellow vampires believe that the lycans' days are numbered. However, when an unsuspecting human (Scott Speedman) becomes the focal point of the conflict; everything Selene believes about the war, her heritage, and her mission may change forever.Upon its release ""Underworld"" presented audiences with a new take on vampires and lycans (typically known as werewolves). Long gone are the days of Bela Lugosi's undeniably iconic ""Dracula"" or Lon Chaney, Jr's ""The Wolf Man"". Now, we are presented with vampires decked out in sleek, leather outfits, packing modern-day weaponry and martial arts influenced fighting styles. Plus, lycans that have never looked as menacing or believable as they do in this film.Not to mention, the lycans' transformations (a nearly seamless blend of CGI and practical effects) are some of the best committed to film to this day. One thing is for sure, these are supernatural beings and monsters for the new, post-""Matrix"" generation of moviegoers.Written by Danny McBride (""Underworld: Rise of the Lycan"") the film wastes little time jumping into both the main crux of the story (i.e. the specifics of the two races, the war, and so on) and the fast-paced, hard-hitting action sequences. For the most part the story does a terrific job in balancing the plot with the action, interspersed with brief tidbits of the history between the two races. However, at times the plot feels a little too rushed in order to keep the momentum going, resulting in some uneven, almost jumbled aspects to the story.That being said, in the end those moments are overshadowed by the fact that Danny McBride did an excellent job of crafting a story that introduced us to a complicated war between supernatural beings. While the director, Len Wiseman (""Live Free or Die Hard"") skillfully guided the story to cinematic life complete with style, an eerie atmosphere that blended the familiar with the supernatural, and a terrifically cast group of actors and actresses.Speaking of the cast, let's begin with actress Kate Beckinsale (""Pearl Harbor"") as the leather-clad vampire Selene. Kate's performance was generally stoic and emotionless, which makes sense given she is portraying a member of the so-called undead. However, there were some brief glimpses of newfound emotions boiling to the surface and Kate's handling of Selene's bewilderment to the aforementioned was completely natural and effortless.Also, seeing a female vampire doing a majority of the action was an interesting change of pace for this type of film, but a welcome one at that. Kate handled herself in the action sequences in such a strong, confident manner that she quickly solidified her character as one not to be messed with.Actor Scott Speedman (""Dark Blue"") was good in the role of Michael, the human that the lycans are focused upon. However, I did find that occasionally his acting felt a little forced. Perhaps he was over-rehearsed so that the scenes couldn't flow naturally for him. Even so, acting wise I don't believe he is up to par with some of the other, more accomplished cast members.Of course, the fact that a vampire/werewolf movie actually has acting that was good enough to set standards for the entire cast is surprising in itself (at least in my estimation). That alone should indicate that this film is not just another one of your typical, run-of-the-mill monster films where the acting is the last thing on anyone's mind. This film's cast actually seemed to take pride in getting their characters right and making them interesting to the audience, while still holding true to the archetypes being portrayed.Speaking of those cast members that set the aforementioned acting bar; aside from Kate Beckinsale, we have the two talented actors chosen to play the respective leaders of the two races, actors Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen.As the vampire king, Viktor, veteran actor Bill Nighy (""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"") commands both respect and fear with his portrayal that was at times endearing, but could then be utterly cold, calculating and undeniably evil. His layered performance elevated the character of Viktor from being just another one-dimensional despot to a complicated being that was very real despite his supernatural disposition.The ever-reliable actor Michael Sheen (""Frost/Nixon"") as Lucian, leader of the lycans, brought a quiet strength to the role that belied the ferocity lurking just beneath the surface. His performance was laced with such subtle malevolence, so that whenever his character would snap and unleash the inner beast it was almost startling; despite the fact you knew it had to happen at some point.With such generally strong performances, fast-paced action and stunts, and solid storytelling, ""Underworld"" is without a doubt an excellent monster movie in every sense. The film successfully brings a centuries-old war between supernatural beings to life in a way that is interesting and above all, entertaining.""Underworld"" is rated R for violence and

785071,A3BO9FLATQULV5,B0000VAFNQ,K. A. Jones,"[0, 1]","HelloI've watched all three movies in SD and HD on the Dish. We have the newest title on BD and after reading the reviews of both BD and DVD version I decided to grab this in Blu-Ray. The reviews I've read both pro and casual pretty much sum up my thoughts, this is a very good transfer in both image and sound. Let me break it down into two groups....Image and visual - With the ""Underworld"" series don't expect a dazzeling colorful display. Instead it's a world of darks and grey with a touch of gothic appeal. While for some that may not be such a good thing it does show a great deal of contrast involving blacks against skin tones. And this is where this movie shines above all others. It has a great blend with surprising detail in this contrast especially with Kate Beckinsale dressed in black leather, with pitch black hair and a pale skin face. But it's all thruout the movie from the buildings, stone, chains, the rainy weather; the whole Underworld experience really shows up well with it's black & grey theme.Sound - I was really surprised how well the DD 5.1 track did on this. Most will say, ""oh well it's a gun battle here and there and what do you expect"". Well that's just it, there's allot more. It's basically everywhere from the rain falling, to metal locks turning, splashes of water while running thru it, chains clanging and so on. One particular scene involved one Vampire with two whips lashing out at a Werewolf coming at him. It was if the whips were snapping back & forth side-to-side. And yes there are gun battles and plenty of them. The low end gets about an average workout but this is not Saving Private Ryan. It would've been extra icing if there was a DTS track.Overall I would grade this close to ""Reference Quality"" for showing off BD and Sound. The high level of contrast with blacks and skin detail makes this a BD Standout. Sound wise a excellent choice for those who enjoy action and want it loud.

Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for untold centuries.  Very few even remember how the blood feud started.  But the crossing of a Vamp with a Lycan has always been forbidden.  Or has it?UNDERWORLD is action-packed from the get go; you jump right in and it never lets up.  Epic battles, high-speed chases, gun fights, impossible stunts, blood and gore (although less than you would think), and fantastic transformations keep you on the edge of your seat.  The directing/cinematography/editing are excellent, cutting away from anything truly disgusting before you really see it; leaving the rest to your vivid imagination.  The acting is impressive, with Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and Michael Sheen all giving scene-stealing performances.  The rest of the cast, including Bill Nighy, are equally good in there respective roles.  And let me just say, the costuming for UNDERWORLD is marvelous:  gorgeous dresses, fabulous leathers, skin-tight cat suits.  I'd like to go shopping were the Vamps do!UNDERWORLD includes all the universal Vampire and Werewolf lore - sunlight kills Vamps, silver kills Lycans, you become a Vampire or a Werewolf from a bite.  Not too many surprises in this area (although these precepts are taken to new heights), making it easier to keep up with the plot.  But added to the standard lore is the theory that there is a line of humans who carry a gene that enables them to survive a bite from BOTH a Vampire and a Lycanthrope.  And this is what the Lycans are looking for.Even if you aren't a fan of monster flicks, you will enjoy UNDERWORLD.  It makes for a great popcorn evening at home.  It is clearly too intense for the youngest members of the family, but tweens and up should be just fine.So, what DO you get, when you cross a Vampire with a Lycanthrope?

785075,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B0000VAFNQ,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[1, 1]","I just watched Underworld for the about the sixth or seventh time today and having watched all four numerous times, knowing the back story as well as I do now between Sofia and Michael, I am able to see so much more the story unfolded. I love the stylish production. When Selene, the female vampire of a coven somewhere near 1700 years old, finds a human and realizes the vampire's arch nemesis, Lucian is alive when she had been told all of her life he was dead (the rules are strict about delving into the past in Selene's world) she very much wants to know what the Lycans want from him. There appears to be nothing particularly different about him but the caretaker of their coven has been anything but vigilant with nightly bawdy parties and a total lack of oversight. This leaves Selene feeling uncomfortable and she senses a terrible danger ahead. Michael played very well by the sexy Scott Speedman, is the center of this story as this faction wants to merge the humans and Lycans biologically which was supposed to create a doubly strong, powerful entity and perhaps stop the thousand year war between these two very different races of beings. I am a great fan of Kate Beckinsale and I think she plays a brilliant part in a sometimes complex, but well directed movie. Bill Nighy, a delightful English actor who has played many wonderful parts plays Viktor, the elder whom Selene feels forced to ""wake up"" from his 300 or so year sleep is a viscious charactor who originally put this war in motion when *****SPOILER ALERT***** (for the five of you out there who hasn't yet seen it) he killed his daughter in an extremely barbaric way in the early days when the Lycans (werewolves) are basically used and abused by the vampires as slaves. The story, as I said is not just brilliant, but there is a beautiful love story between Lucian and his vampire wife, Sofia. When she dares get pregnant, Viktor, who is perhaps the very definition of rascism, will never let this hybrid child come to term and kills Sofia as noted above, in front of a chained and horrified Lucian. And so Lucian starts this terrible war.There are four movies in this series. Best watch Underworld: Rise of the Lycans first although it was the third made in the series. Then go back and watch Underworld, Underworld Evolution and then Underworld Awakening although the last movie does not include Scott Speedman, which is sad. These movies are the story of the development of both races and the thrill of living a little bit inside their cruel, dark worlds. I thought I wouldn't like Rise of the Lycans which is set back many years and explains what happened and how these two races became such mortal enemies. But the powerful love story was simply done brilliantly and it is my second favorite in the series.If you haven't indulged in this intelligent, stylish, very goth set of movies yet, I highly recommend you rent and watch or just buy the whole thing in a bundle. I never get tired of the Underworld movies. Definitely NOT for children. This is true ""adult"" entertainment. All movies send you on a fantastic thrill ride as the twists and turns just keep coming.

One thing is for sure, this movie is in no way a horror film.  Take any standard action yarn, replace the good guys with vampires and the bad guys with werewolves.  Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.  Finally, blend in a betrayal and a cover-up and you basically have the storyline.  There's nothing new here.The two supernatural enemies really don't even use their powers against each other that much.  The ""death dealer"" vampires have more guns than a cult in Waco.  They don't even get close to ripping open the necks of their enemies. The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from ""Fight Club"" in the city's subway tunnels.Don't think that this flick isn't enjoyable, though.  It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.  I just wish that the vamps and wolves could have used their powers a little more than their guns.  The betrayal and cover-up mentioned earlier does actually make you pull for one side of the conflict a little more than the other, but in the end, you just want to see these folks beat the heck out of each other until someone yells, ""Uncle!""If you want real vampire or werewolf action, check out a movie like ""Interview With The Vampire""(better yet, read the book), or ""Silver Bullet""(again, the book is better).

To put it straight to the point: if you loved The Crow, but thought of how much more could have been in that Goth classic, then get into this right away.Yeah, almost everyone had black trenchcoats on, there's a constant gloomy atmosphere (which I loved), and although Kate Beckinsale looks killer sexy in the black latex ..., she is a much better female hero of the movie than say, Angelina Jolie runnning around in the Tomb Raider movies.The effect as far as the battle between vampires and werewolves was excellent.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[4, 6]","I missed this one when it was in the theaters and was patiently awaiting its arrival on the DVD racks and to say the very least, I was not disappointed by it.  ""Underworld"" is an outstanding, sleek action thriller with extremely dark undertones that I highly enjoyed watching.  The only detractor for me was the prosthetics and CGI used for the Lycans (werewolves).  Outside of that minor detractor, this films scores on all points, from the overall dark atmosphere to the story telling and to the acting.While I've seen and read that the professional critics and many others have pretty much panned this movie, if you've not seen it yet, I urge you to give it an open minded try as I believe you will be as surprised by it as I was!  As far as stories go that involve vampires and werewolves, ""Underworld"" takes a completely new, intriguing and compelling approach that will hopefully spawn a sequel.Prior to ""Underworld,"" the only movie I've ever seen Kate Beckinsale in was ""Pearl Harbor"" and I thought her performance in that film was, just what it was, a supporting role that was noticeable but not notable.  Her performance as the lead in an action film of this magnitude is, to say the least, incredible.  She is an extremely gorgeous woman and given the makeup and costumes she's wearing in this film, they only serve to greater enhance her beauty.  Her future performances are definitely to be looked forward to with anticipation.This highly conceptual story was written by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman and Danny McBride and directed by Len Wiseman.  All of which deserve high praise for their efforts in creating this new spin in the Vampire/Werewolves genre.  The score for the film greatly enhances the overall dark feeling of the movie!The Premise:Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire who is one of the lead warriors in the battle between the vampires and the Lycans (werewolves).  Known as a death bringer by the Lycans, she makes a disturbing discovery while on a mission to bring death to some of the Lycans, a discovery that will lead her down the path to of a highly adventuresome story that is extremely rich in its telling...I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films from this particular genre.

I didn't really know what to expect from the movie when I went to see it in theatres. I saw the preview and thought it looked interested, so when time came for it to be released, I found myself at the AMC 24 checking it out. And let me just say I am extremely glad I did. ""Underworld"" was more than a pleasant surprise, and in turn became one of my favorite movies of 2004. If you're into action, love stories, vampires, werewolves, or all of the above, then this movie was made for you to enjoy.""Underworld"" follows Celine (Kate Beckinsdale), a sexy vampire whose in the midst of a war with the Lycans. The goal of both the Lycans and the Vampires, is to exterminate the other side. No one really knows why the war was started, or how long it's been going on, all they really know is the other race is the enemy, and it's their job to get rid of them. However quickly into the movie, you'll discover that there is foul-play going on between Vampire and Lycan leaders, furthering the depth of the plot. Celine's romance with a human, recently turned Lycan does nothing to help the matter. Start to finish I found the movie very interesting, especially the fight scenes and special effects. There's plenty for action and horror fans a like to find in this movie, and that's why it's a recommended must see to any of those people. The Unrated extended cut is the essential version of the movie, as it further develops characters in the movie, and has an extended final fight sequence. The ending is kind of a cliff-hanger, so can we expect an Underworld 2? One can only hope.All in All there's no reason to not buy the DVD if you liked the movie, especially the Unrated extended cut. If you liked it before, I think you will be more than satisfied with the purchase of this DVD. If you didn't catch it in theatres, then this is a great opportunity to get a great movie.

785113,A2GAINX7PJLP2W,B0000VAFNQ,Magin,"[4, 4]","I am a sucker for vampire movies.  Ever since we &quot;learned&quot; that vampires aren't the slow, lurching beasties of Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee films, it's been a film genre that guarantees some good eye-candy.  So I watch all the vampire movies I can find, and even go so far as to buy a few here and there.Also, I am a huge dork, and am not afraid to admit it.  I watch movies with flawed premises, shrink-wrapped babes, and extremely expensive cars/guns/computers.So, on the dork front, this movie's a winner.  Kate Beckinsale is a hot shrink-wrapped vampire chick who drives an expensive car, carries some exotic weaponry and for no good reason has some high-quality survailance equipment.  There are swords for no good reason, and dark, moodily-lit sets.  Very cool.With all that coolness going on, the movie didn't really need a plot, or any depth, or even much action.  The actors weren't terrible; they just weren't given much to work with.  The plot seemed to involve an attempt to justify the existence of vampires and werewolves based on not dying of Black Death, and finding someone with the exact same blood as that one lucky fellow -- who, luckily, has a very similar name.  It also involves a &quot;Death Dealer&quot; (possibly the lamest pseudo-badass job title ever imagined) who decides that the guy she's supposed to kill isn't all that bad after all, and she'd really rather kill vampires anyway.  Said decision is made for virtually no reason at all.I do give the film credit for dovetailing the flashbacks and recollections to piece together the backstory in a reasonable way.  The pacing of that series of revelations is a little off, but there's not much story to tell, so you really can't expect a smooth ride.  Unfortunately, the &quot;twists&quot; were painfully easy to predict, so the editing and directing of those scenes gets a bit overlooked, even though it's quite good.So, there are problems with the way the movie works.  Fine.  I don't care, so long as it looks nice.  And &quot;Underworld&quot; looks very nice most of the time.  Cool stunts, neat effects, decent sets, solid (though cliche) costuming, and all the guns you could ever want.But don't get me started on the guy with the whips.List of things I'm tired of, that appeared in &quot;Underworld.&quot;1) Young, hip, good-looking doctors with long hair and five-o'clock-shadow.2) &quot;Oops!  I didn't notice my head had been cut off!&quot;3) Rain.4) Vampires being huge, whimpering wusses.5) Wondering exactly how many rounds were in that magazine, anyway.Buy it if you're like me, and into things that look neat.

785116,A1B05INWIDZ74O,B0000VAFNQ,M. A. Ramos,"[1, 1]","Underworld starts out with a long action sequence. Things do slow down enough for us to learn that our hero is a vampire by the name of Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale, who has devoted her unlife to destroying lycanthropes. Selene stumbles upon a conspiracy between the vampire leader, Kraven, and the werewolf leader, Lucian, which involves a human named Michael, who is a host to a strain of some strain of plague that is never explained. Fearing that Kraven's actions may place the vampires in jeopardy, Selene does the unthinkable; she awakens the ancient vampire noble, Viktor so he can stop Kraven.In the middle of the movie we move away from some of the action and we get our characters doing a lot of talking, plotting, and running through dark wet streets. We get all of our back-story of how the vampire/werewolf war got started in the first place via flashbacks. And there's a forbidden romance budding between Selene and Michael.The movie looks sufficiently offbeat to be interesting, although the muted colors and lack of anything resembling bright light becomes does get a little old. Be nice to see what the vampires did when the sun was up. Kate Beckinsale does look dangerous and sexy in a skintight leather suit, but there is not much acting for her to do in this film. Scott Speedman doesn't need to do anything more than exude a primal wildness, which he succeeds at. And everyone else has to appear sinister.Even though, I found Underworld be an entertaining view. The big battle at the end is fun, although the final scene seems to be an introduction for a sequel. So get your popcorn, and watch the movie.

It is a very competent, if stagecrafty, vampire film.  It features lots of atmosphere and dramatic, gothic filmogaphy.  It takes place in a setting that is half Prague and half London - underground scenes, castle scenes and even a chase or two.  Stunts and costumes are excellent - the film uses costumes and stunts rather than CGI for it's effects - for a result that is, as someone else remarked, half Dracula and half Matrix.The premise isn't completely original, but is well worked out, making vampires and lycans (werewolves) a kind of medical accident arising in the depth of the plague years developing a complex hierarchical society with vampires at the to and the werewolves at the bottom.  This somehow impacted, and lycans and vampires are at war, with the werewolves at a disadvantage.In the midst of a hunt Selene (Kate Beckensale) finds that a nest of werewolves is determined to capture a human - Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Her investigation puts her at odds with her coven's leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and the ensuing events reveal something so menacing that vampire and lycan are threatened.In essence this is a pure action film not a horror film.  There are gestures at romance and the politics of the night but the primary movement is set scene - chase scene - fight scene.  While the acting is generally competent - Beckensale is quite good, and Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are excellent as lycan and vampire elders - it isn't spectacular.  Certainly not good enough to make what director Ken Wiseman thought might be 'the greatest vampire story ever told.'Seen purely as what it is, 'Underworld' is an enjoyable, fast-paced film that presents in interesting vision of life in the darkness.  Held against an arbitrary standard of greatness or a belief that it is the deconstruction of the vampire mythos, it falls short.

I saw it in the movie theater when it first came out, then bought the dvd and novelization and just recently purchased the new unrated extended cut dvd.The extended cut has some new added/recut scenes and, although I would've loved for it to be longer, I felt that it did add more dimension to some of the characters. Some of the new scenes include more backstory on Michael Corvin, a love scene between Kraven and Erika and an extended battle at the finale. The scene after Selene's car fell in the river has been recut and there are some minor additions that are barely noticeable (unless you've seen the theatrical cut a few times).The new special features are also a big plus. I enjoyed &quot;Fang vs. Fiction&quot; and the entertaining commentary by director Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, to name a few.I have already posted a longer review on the theatrical cut dvd and it goes without saying that I enjoy this film immensely. It's simply the kind of action film that you could watch over and over again.Kate Beckinsale as Selene is simply mesmerizing. Who would've thought that the young British actress who started out in costume dramas/comedies like the BBC's &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; could successfully transform herself into a credible action heroine.  The rest of the cast is also outstanding and the story is completely engrossing.I would recommend this extended cut dvd to fans of &quot;Underworld&quot; particularly if they already do not have the original theatrical cut.

Underworld kept me watching, however, when less gory films like ""The Unseen"" would have had me turning the television off. First of all, I liked the premise of Vampire death squads hunting down Werewolf dens, and I understood the backstory without a problem.The film's look is suitably dark, decrepit, and nasty; the Lycans live in an underground bunker that looks like it was transported from the battle of Stalingrad, while the Vampires stand around a gated mansion looking like mid-70's rock stars.Kate Beckinsale plays Selena, a death-dealer who suspects the vampire left to run her coven, Craven (bad name) is conspiring with the werewolves.  She is loyal to Viktor, the sleeping leader of her coven.  Meanwhile, Lucian, the leader of the Lycans pursues a human who holds the key to a genetic transformation that will free the werewolves from the domination of the Vampires.Underworld moves quickly enough that the sheer silliness of the plot doesn't impede the action, and Kate Beckinsale is eye candy enough to make compelling viewing.  The last act of the movie, however, a battle between Viktor, played by Bill Cighy (whom I last saw in ""Love Actually) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid, leaving Kate Beckinsale to grimace for the last ten minutes of the film, is less climactic than the film needs.This film has interesting tones of racism that impelled me to keep watching, because the driving engine of Underworld isn't gore or blood splashing or reviving corpses, or bullets splaying, but Romeo as a werewolf and Juliet as a vampire, which is funny and sad.

Star Kate Beckinsale looks very stylish in various tight shiny black outfits and if you had to choose between her Selene or Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity - I find Selene a more interesting character.There's a LOT that goes unexplained in this movie.  It takes as a given that you understand a little bit of monster lore - sunlight is deadly to vampires, silver just as deadly to werewolves and both of them can transmit their condition from a bite.  Beyond that it stumbles pretty badly into some new monster mumbo-jumbo.  It seems there are some humans who carry the strain of a virus which make it possible to withstand the bites of both where previously the bite of a vampire would kill someone previously bitten by a werewolf.  There are also some ""super-Vampires"" called ""The Elders"".  There are three elders, but two are always required to be in hibernation while one gets to be awakened for reasons that are never explained.The film opens with an extended action sequence and other than a brief prologue voiceover that tells you that the war between vampires and lycans has gone on for over a thousand years, you don't know anything about the characters, so the extended fight in a subway feels more impersonal than a video game.The final act involves one ""surprise"" after another.  Hidden secrets and treacherous alliances that seem to have been going on for centuries are all revealed over about 2 or 3 days - the keepers of the secrets suddenly become less good at keeping them once the cameras started rolling.I could reveal more about the plot, but that would cut seriously into your enjoyment should you decide to watch ""Underworld"".

785122,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B0000VAFNQ,Martin Asiner,"[3, 5]","Vampire and werewolf movies usually come in two flavors: one has great special effects with minimal character development while the other is the reverse.  When Bela Lugosi hammed it up in DRACULA, his rich, Hungarian cadences resonate even today.  Lugosi did not need any effect more special than a dark, creepy castle in which to lay in his coffin.  In UNDERWORLD, director Len Wiseman presents a milennia long epic struggle between vampires and lycans (werewolves) in what should have been a riveting tale of a blood feud heightened by some truly outstanding special effects.  The problem with UNDERWORLD and films that emphasize sight and sound over characterization is that the balance between the two is a subtle one and that if one is to dominate, then that one should be the latter.  One can always tell when this balance is out of whack.  If at any time, the viewer has a hard time distinguishing between one set of species and another, then he is pretty sure that the intent of the film is to dazzle the eye rather than engage the mind.  Kate Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire killer of werewolves.  In her hunting for the lycans, she wears an expression that is as ossified as any that Clint Eastwood has worn.  She neither frowns, smiles, nor shows the slightest interest in the rather interesting events engulfing her.  In fact, she is more an expressionless  female version of another vampire hunter (Wesley Snipes) in the BLADE series.  Her male lead is Scott Speedman, who plays Michael, a normal human being whom the lycans relentlessly pursue.  The plot revolves around why the lycans want him and what the vampires can do to prevent him from falling into their lupine clutches.I quibble over the wasted potential of a plot that combines ROMEO AND JULIET, BLADE, and centuries-old conspiracy storylines.  The only interesting point of the plot was the unexpectedly engaging character of Lucian (Michael Sheen), who as the bearded leader of the lycans, first horrifies us, then causes us to feel some sympathy for a species that is simply reacting to prevent its own destruction by a competing one.  There are too many scenes of gratuitous violence, with both lycan and vampire using modern technological firearms to blast away at each other as if they were no more than urban gangbangers delighting in drive by shootings.  Further, there were several scenes in which I had some difficulty separating a vampire gunslinger from his lycan counterpart.  Beckinsale and Speedman are attractive actors who were clearly instructed by the director to vent their inner demons in over the top gravity defying leaps and bounds.  Lugosi, by contrast, never had to amble faster than a slow and dignified gate.  UNDERWORLD promises to be the kind of movie that will initially do well at both the both office and the video market.  But in years to come, the vampire film that will continue to fascinate a new generation of viewers will still be the one that has the Transylvanian count intoning: ""Come here, Van Helsing.""",3,UNDERWORLD--Underdeveloped Characterization,1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,3021,"['Vampire', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'usually', 'come', 'two', 'flavors', 'one', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'minimal', 'character', 'development', 'other', 'reverse', 'When', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'hammed', 'up', 'DRACULA', 'rich', 'Hungarian', 'cadences', 'resonate', 'even', 'today', 'Lugosi', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'effect', 'more', 'special', 'dark', 'creepy', 'castle', 'lay', 'coffin', 'UNDERWORLD', 'director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'milennia', 'long', 'epic', 'struggle', 'vampires', 'lycans', 'werewolves', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'riveting', 'tale', 'blood', 'feud', 'heightened', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'special', 'effects', 'problem', 'UNDERWORLD', 'films', 'emphasize', 'sight', 'sound', 'characterization', 'balance', 'two', 'subtle', 'one', 'one', 'dominate', 'then', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'latter', 'One', 'can', 'always', 'tell', 'when', 'balance', 'whack', 'time', 'viewer', 'hard', 'time', 'distinguishing', 'one', 'set', 'species', 'then', 'pretty', 'sure', 'intent', 'film', 'dazzle', 'eye', 'rather', 'engage', 'mind', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Selene', 'vampire', 'killer', 'werewolves', 'hunting', 'lycans', 'expression', 'as', 'ossified', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'worn', 'frowns', 'smiles', 'slightest', 'interest', 'rather', 'interesting', 'events', 'engulfing', 'fact', 'more', 'expressionless', 'female', 'version', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'BLADE', 'series', 'male', 'lead', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'who', 'Michael', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'whom', 'lycans', 'relentlessly', 'pursue', 'plot', 'around', 'why', 'lycans', 'want', 'what', 'vampires', 'can', 'do', 'prevent', 'falling', 'lupine', 'clutches.I', 'quibble', 'wasted', 'potential', 'plot', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', 'BLADE', 'centuries-old', 'conspiracy', 'storylines', 'only', 'interesting', 'point', 'plot', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'engaging', 'character', 'Lucian', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'who', 'bearded', 'leader', 'lycans', 'first', 'horrifies', 'then', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'species', 'simply', 'reacting', 'prevent', 'own', 'destruction', 'competing', 'one', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'lycan', 'vampire', 'using', 'modern', 'technological', 'firearms', 'blast', 'away', 'other', 'were', 'more', 'urban', 'gangbangers', 'delighting', 'drive', 'shootings', 'Further', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'had', 'difficulty', 'separating', 'vampire', 'gunslinger', 'lycan', 'counterpart', 'Beckinsale', 'Speedman', 'are', 'attractive', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'clearly', 'instructed', 'director', 'vent', 'inner', 'demons', 'top', 'gravity', 'defying', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'Lugosi', 'contrast', 'never', 'had', 'amble', 'faster', 'slow', 'dignified', 'gate', 'UNDERWORLD', 'be', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'initially', 'do', 'well', 'office', 'video', 'market', 'years', 'come', 'vampire', 'film', 'will', 'continue', 'fascinate', 'new', 'generation', 'viewers', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'one', 'Transylvanian', 'count', 'intoning', 'Come', 'here', 'Van', 'Helsing']",N/A

I think that critics have a tendency to believe that every movie should give food for thought, whereas I believe that some films that only offer good entertainment should be given a chance, too. At that time, and after some gruelling exams, I was in the mood for some uncomplicated fun, and ""Underworld"" gave me just that.I hadn't heard from the director, Len Wiseman, but I must say he did an excellent job with this dark action film that features vampires and werewolves (lycans) fighting a 1000 year war against each other and amid the humans. The story is entertaining and original, something that you will appreciate even more if you have the chance of watching this dvd with the extended cut.One of the main characters in ""Underworld"" is Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire and a Deathdealer (that is, someone who hunts and kills lycans). Selene discovers some lycans hunting a mortal, Michael (Scott Speedman), and gets curious. Why are them after him? Of course, everything the lycans want, Selene will have, so she decides to find Michael.

785128,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0000VAFNQ,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[5, 8]","For several hundred years, vampires and lycans (werewolves) have fought a long war. Most of the vampires don't understand why they are at war, but believe that they have nearly wiped out the lycans, or have they?  Thus begins the 2003 film &quot;Underworld&quot;, which was under the direction of Len Wiseman in his directorial and authorial debut.  He co-wrote the film's story with Kevin Grevioux and Danny McBride, who also both played the characters Raze (a fierce lycan) and Mason respectively and were two of the film's associate producers.  The lead character in the film, a vampire soldier named Selene, is played by the actress Kate Beckinsale, who is remembered for playing the leading female character in the melodramatic 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.As a soldier, Selene is known as a Death Dealer.  She and her fellow Death Dealers are armed with machine guns that fire silver bullets.  The lycans are similarly armed, but use ultraviolet light-emitting bullets instead.  Whereas most of the lycans appear to have fighting skills, most of the vampires seemingly spend their time lounging about.  The film begins with a skirmish between Selene, who is accompanied by another Death Dealer, and two lycans who she discovers are following a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Michael escapes, but Selene becomes engrossed with understanding why the lycans are so interested in him.  With total disregard to leading vampire Kraven's (Shane Brolly) disapproval, Selene captures Michael, but the leading lycan, named Lucian (Michael Sheen), also catches up with him and bites him.  Hence, Michael begins to transform into a lycan, but Selene's continued interest in him develops into something else.  She also discovers a lot more about her own history, the history of vampires and lycans, Lucian's plans, and the leading vampire in which she places the greatest trust, Viktor (Bill Nighy).Though the plot of &quot;Underworld&quot; is thin, it is unique in its portrayal of the relationship between the two popular mythological creatures of vampires and werewolves. The on-screen fights, special effects and action are entertaining, and the dark and nearly achromatic cinematography used nearly throughout the film's 121 minutes maintains an infernal atmosphere.  The off-screen action is also interesting as Michael Sheen is Kate Beckinsale's former boyfriend with whom she conceived a child several years ago, and she is now Len Wiseman's fianc&eacute;e.  Memorable on-screen scenes include the opening skirmish, Selene with Michael, skirmishes with Lucian, raising Viktor, and the last 30 minutes (or so) of the film.  Notable special effects include the werewolf transformations, Michael's transformations and the extra-human abilities that the vampires and werewolves have.  The most annoying character in the film is Kraven.Overall, I rate &quot;Underworld&quot; with 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded to 4 stars.

Rise up, beautiful sun, and make the jealous moon invisible.""One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a ""Death Dealer"", an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being ""loosely"" based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like

785139,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0000VAFNQ,Mitch Weaver,"[0, 0]","&quot;Underworld&quot; focuses on a war that has been going on for centuries between vampires and werewolves. For the most part, werewolves have become extinct. They have been hunted over the centuries by vampire soliders called Deathdealers. The werewolves however, have discovered a way to turn the war in their favor, by finding a human named Michale Corbin ( Scott Speadman). Michael has the genes necessary to survive a bite from both a werewolf and a vampire, which would help to create a species that would be deadly to the vampires. Things get even worse, when the lead Deathdealer Selene ( Kate Bekinsale) begins to fall in love with Michael. Now it is up to Selene to keep Michael safe from the werewolves so that both Michael and her species can survive.There has been a lot of mixed reviews when it comes to this film, and the general consensus is that &quot;Underworld&quot; had promise but did not live up to the hype. However, I think &quot;Underworld&quot; lived up to the hype and then some. The best thing about this film, is that it offers the one horror battle that we have always wanted to see - vampires vs werewolves. The film pulls it off rather effectively, by demonstrating the hatred the two societies feel for each other. The reason the film pulls you in, is because both sides have valid reasons to be angry. You have a hard time choosing who to root for. The action and special effects in this film are first rate. There are plenty of Matrix like shoot-outs, and state of the art special effects to make the werewolves look rather terrifying. Scott Speadman and Kate Beckinsale are especially good as well, and bring the classic Romeo and Juliet element to the film. They have very good chemistry together.Watching the two groups of classic movie monsters fight it out, really makes Underworld a terrifying thrill ride that will leave you begging for more after the film has ended. Every element of this film was great, from the outstanding plot and special effects, to the awesome action sequences and the forbidden love between a vampire and a werewolf.

It had one main thing going for it and that was the storyline of what would happen if a vampire and werewolf mixed together? A supermonster would be created. Half vampire and half werewolf sounds half crazy but very interesting. That is exactly the problem I had with the film. Let me explain as best I can. You see, this movie builds up this ever-impending fight between the vampires, in particular the ancient vampires, and the werewolves. The werewolves are tired of being slaves to the vampires, so they have come together and organized to make a super race of werewolves that can annihilate the vampires. Well, you can't wait to see it happen and then you do but you want more and you get the end of the movie. On top of getting to see the vampire/werewolf hybrid, you get a little disappointed when you see him fight; he's not so mighty is all I'll say.I want a sequel to this movie. Now I'm not a sequel nut but this movie definitely could use a sequel. I want to know more about the supermonster that was created in the movie.

That&#65533;s about all you can say for Underworld. A kind of new idea (though still quite cliched) but this film turned out to be a Blade/Matrix wannabe. Everyone wears tight black leather with long black trench coats and guns with weird bullets. And so begins the vampire vs. werewolf war! For hundreds of years the vamps and lykens (werewolves) have been at war. The head of each group have been at each others throat forever and now the fight is more important than ever. The lykens are searching for a human that holds the blood that can be used to mix both species to create a very powerful beast. That&#65533;s most of the plot right there. The rest of the movie looks to be a way to show off special effects and just how many times they can open the double doors with one motion (which is a lot!). Kate Beckinsale did do a show a good performance but that&#65533;s about it. The movie really fell short of my expectations.

I'll start with the negative.This movie has Kate Beckinsdale in it.  Kate Beckinsdale is HOT.  I sat through Serendipity just because she was in it.  I enjoyed Van Helsing even more than I would've because Kate was so beautiful as Queen of the Gypsies.  But in Underworld, Kate looks, well, just not very hot.  She's still beautiful, but the whole pale, bad haircut, bodysuit look just doesn't do anything for her.  So that's a big strike against the film right there.Onto the positive:  The film has an interesting premise though it doesn't really explore any new ground with it.  These vampires are pretty standard vampires.  Ditto, the werewolves.  But there are some cool action sequences, a nice gothic feel, and solid acting.Here's the BIG COMPLAINT:  Like so many series books now, this movie doesn't end.  It's just a setup for the next film.  I don't mind a few dangling plot threads, but this movie pretty much stops in the middle of the story.  The ending scene is as ""To be continued . . ."" as if I were watching a TV cliffhanger.I HATE CLIFFHANGERS!  I cannot stress this enough.  When I pay seven bucks to see a movie, I want a whole movie.  Not just the beginning of the movie.  I want a set up, a conflict, and a resolution.

Really though, we've seen much worse crap than this in horror/action crossovers and despite the above-listed major problems, there are some genuinely fun moments, to laugh at if nothing else. I thought it was hysterical that thrown out as an afterthought at one point, it is mentioned that vampires don't really drink from humans anymore but subsist on artifical plasma.

In an attempt to bring the war to a close, a vampire named Kraven and the lycan elder, Lucian, create a hybrid, a cross between the lycan and vampire species.Underworld has a lot of suspense in it. When the main character, a vampire named Selena, realized her enemies, the werewolves, were after a human, she had no idea as to why. She had to go gather evidence to help her figure out what was going on.Romance plays a pretty big role in Underworld. Love between the vampire and lycan species was forbidden by vampire laws. The vampires feared a blend of the species. So when Lucian, the werewolf, asked a vampire to marry him, his soon-to-be bride was killed. That's how the war began. Centuries later, Selena finds herself in the same situation when she falls for Michael, the hybrid.The action scenes in Underworld are stunning. There are many life-or-death situations for the characters. The part with the most action and over all best graphics would be when the hybrid, Michael changes for the first time and fights the vampire, Viktor.Underworld is a great movie and highly recommended for fans of werewolves and vampires. The creators of the movie did a great job bringing the fictional characters to life.

Man was this different!It was very well acted and the action sequences were terrific.  There were no ""impossible"" last minute saves or other unbelievable situations.  Everything was built up perfectly and the movie got better and better as it went along.  There were some intriguing plot twists and it was suspenseful just trying to figure out who the real bad guys were and who the good guys were.  That was another point I liked, it actually presented the story, especially towards the end, from a different perspective and that potentially changed your feelings towards the characters.  Very solid!!! VERY SOLID!Of course Kate Beckinsale is a fabulous babe and her performance would have been awesome even if she wasn't hot....but what the heck, she IS hot and that just makes it all the better.  The casting for this movie was just about 100% which makes a huge difference in the quality of a film.  If the wrong actors play the wrong roles...the movie is screwed before it even starts.This is the kind of film to watch several times and really get into it which makes it very well worth owning in my opinion.What can I say?

The action was ripped off from the matrix.  If you have the chance to do something new and different take that chance.  This was Len Wiseman first movie which to say for a freshman is was decent.  My biggest complaint had to do with a plot that was thin.  I am a huge fan of the Vampire and Werewolf genera.  Comparing Underworld to other great movies Underworld falls horribly short to say the least.  Characters weren't well developed or even interesting.  I wanted more related to historical content, much more then providing me with a blurry flashback.  Ok if you like action then this movie will deliver but remember that action doesn't make for a great movie.  It's probably worth your time but not going down in my book as a top ten.  What is worst is this movie was set up for a sequel.  I beg those involved to not waste money of a sequel which will one day be found buried deep in the 4.99 DVD bin.  Also I watched it at the Wynnsong 16 in Knoxville which had it turned up loud enough to hurt my ears and also there was a loud reverberating sound coming from the direction of the screen which was taken care of by saying to me that maybe next time I'll be different.

I'm not sure it is one of the best movies of this type ever made, but it is VERY good.It starts out by prefacing the war between the Lycans and Vampires over the centuries and brings you into the modern day world.  There appears to be some hope in combining the blood lines of each species to create a super species, stronger together than each alone.  This movie also explores, very nicely I might add, how the ""war"" unfolded and kind of reminded me of the ""Seventh Sign"" where the flashbacks deal with what is happening in the current day.This movie is filled with deceptions, decadence and subplots galore.  There is a power struggle between the two leading Vampire females for control of the coven.  There is struggle between the Lycan warriors.  There is a power struggle between Craven, the current vampire coven leader and Victor, the resurrected ancient vampire leader.  There is enough action to keep it moving along nicely.The music was very dark, brutal and a true showing of what goth music is all about.  Although the theatre I was in had it almost too loud, a pair of light plugs might have been in order.All in all, I don't see why people are knocking this film.  Maybe they got them selves overhyped.  Some critics have also compared this to the Matrix: Reloaded.  They couldn't be more wrong.

I COULDN'T DO THAT IF EVEN IF I TIED MY HANDS AND HAD TO TYPE WITH MY ......""TOUNGE"".Alright...with all joking aside, this movie was done very well.  Len Wiseman did a fantastic job at giving the audience a belivable movie.  I will not however give this movie five stars.  Basically because of the plot flaws.  I have watched just about every movie that has come out on werewolves, vampires and even mummies ( i know mummies aren't in this movie, but still) my point is, that any true die-hard fan of vampires and werewolves would have wanted the writer and director to have stayed closer to the basic storyline that myself and many other people grew up with.  OKOKOKOK!!  just give me a second to explain before you blindly say that my review was NOT helpful.Werewolves are supposed to be extrememly allergic to silver.  The way that this movie shows us....i know people in real life who are more allergic to silver than these ...things.  Basically if i shoot a werewolf with a silver bullet, he will whine and cry but he will live as long as he can take them out before a couple hours pass.  If anything else this just gives werewolves a greater edge than what they had before.  Vampires also are not looked at as the damned or evil spawn, but rather people infected with a virus.  Basically meaning that they have a reflection in a miror, and that UV is not as effective as you would think.  The werewolves divise a way to shoot UV bullets.  But when these UV bullets hit a vampire...they just say OW and kinda stumble around.  The same for the vampires...they divised a bullet that has liquid silver nitrate inside...so that when the hit a werewolf the silver goes straight through there bloodstream....but like i said before silver isn't as effective...so instead of instant death...you have the good old slow antagonizing death.There are a few more plot flaws in this story, but the truth is that i can't really tell you them, because you will hate me for it later.  I can't tell you too much about the movie...because just like the trailer says....who will you choose.  I can tell you that there is a good race and a bad race, you just need to figure that out on your own through the movie.  Enjoy :)",4,OK OK OK.....

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 3]","A skin tight leather clad Kate Beckinsale stars in this derivative mess which tells the story of a thousand year plus war between vampires and werewolves. Beckinsale is a vampire, or a ""death-dealer"", who hunts werewolves down. One night she discovers a group of them chasing a seemingly normal young man (Scott Speedman), followed by a plethora of derivative action scenes, campy over-acting, and one too many loose ends and plot holes. On the outside, Underworld is a stylish thriller that boasts a very attractive female lead, although Beckinsale's true acting talents aren't entirely put to use. Speedman is wasted as the hapless sap who just happens to be the right guy at the wrong time. The special effects (especially the werewolf transformations) are phenominal; these effects have come a long way since The Howling. Other than that though, Underworld is just a mess.

I use inverted commas because, as it turned out, it was not so much a documentary as a wanna-be Blair Witch-style promo for Underworld. It was slick, cheesy, manipulative and deceptive, and it gave me a low opinion of Underworld, which I decided I would never bother to see.Flash-forward a few years: I see a cheap double set of Underworld and Underworld Evolution, and, being in the mood for something spectacular and stupid, I buy it. I get more than I bargain for. While Underworld doesn't pretend to be anything more than a ""ride"", it's the best movie of this type that I've seen in a while. It doesn't treat the audience like kids, it has a unique vision well executed, and it has some fine performances (Michael Sheen in particular is a nice find).Although it is not a straight rip-off, it is not unfair to describe Underworld as ""Matrix with werewolves and vampires"". They do have similar looks (bluish tinge instead of green), lots of long black leather coats, and gunfights with rubble flying everywhere. But the setting and story are quite different, and there is less CGI. (Unfortunately, like the Matrix, the sequel is ruined by a bad script.)The story is an interesting update on the horror archetypes, with emphasis more on action than horror. (The special bullets are a surprisingly neat idea.) There are a couple of weak performances on the vampire side, but Beckinsale, Nighy and Sheen are good, and Speedman is okay in a part which doesn't have much depth written into it. There are a couple of misjudgements in the direction of the performances, but these are small things that most people won't notice, and it's still damned impressive for a first-time director.One thing, and it's not really a complaint, more a question of accuracy in advertising: The vampires aren't particularly ""vampiry"" - you know, that whole ""living on human blood"" thing. It would hardly affect the movie if they were called Atlanteans, say, or Illuminati, instead of vampires. This isn't really a negative, but it may annoy people who expect to see traditional vampires in this film.EDIT: Since this review, the third film, Rise of the Lycans, has come out. The critics hated it, but I loved it. First-time director Patrick Tatopoulos did a terrific job (he did FX on the first two movies). The result was very dark, intense and claustrophobic, but enjoyable because of the production value and the acting. In particular, it was great to see Nighy and Sheen back and chewing the scenery. Nighy was awesomely over-the-top (""You have betrayed me... to be with an a-ni-mal!""), and as for Sheen, wow, is that really the same guy who played Tony Blair? So I'd rank Lycans at least equal with the first film, and much better than the second and fourth ones.",4,Actually pretty good!,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,2830,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'caught', 'late-night', 'documentary', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'use', 'inverted', 'commas', 'because', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'documentary', 'wanna-be', 'Blair', 'Witch-style', 'promo', 'Underworld', 'was', 'slick', 'cheesy', 'manipulative', 'deceptive', 'gave', 'low', 'opinion', 'Underworld', 'decided', 'would', 'never', 'bother', 'see.Flash-forward', 'few', 'years', 'see', 'cheap', 'double', 'set', 'Underworld', 'Underworld', 'Evolution', 'being', 'mood', 'something', 'spectacular', 'stupid', 'buy', 'get', 'more', 'bargain', 'Underworld', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'ride', 'best', 'movie', 'type', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', ""n't"", 'treat', 'audience', 'kids', 'unique', 'vision', 'well', 'executed', 'fine', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'particular', 'nice', 'find', 'not', 'straight', 'rip-off', 'not', 'unfair', 'describe', 'Underworld', 'Matrix', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'do', 'have', 'similar', 'looks', 'bluish', 'tinge', 'instead', 'green', 'lots', 'long', 'black', 'leather', 'coats', 'gunfights', 'rubble', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'setting', 'story', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'less', 'CGI', 'Unfortunately', 'Matrix', 'sequel', 'ruined', 'bad', 'script', 'story', 'interesting', 'update', 'horror', 'emphasis', 'more', 'action', 'horror', 'special', 'bullets', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'neat', 'idea', 'are', 'couple', 'weak', 'performances', 'vampire', 'side', 'Beckinsale', 'Nighy', 'Sheen', 'are', 'good', 'Speedman', 'okay', 'part', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'depth', 'written', 'are', 'couple', 'misjudgements', 'direction', 'performances', 'are', 'small', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'still', 'damned', 'impressive', 'first-time', 'director.One', 'thing', 'not', 'really', 'complaint', 'more', 'question', 'accuracy', 'advertising', 'vampires', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'vampiry', 'know', 'whole', 'living', 'human', 'blood', 'thing', 'would', 'hardly', 'affect', 'movie', 'were', 'called', 'Atlanteans', 'say', 'Illuminati', 'instead', 'vampires', ""n't"", 'really', 'negative', 'may', 'annoy', 'people', 'who', 'expect', 'see', 'traditional', 'vampires', 'film.EDIT', 'review', 'third', 'film', 'Rise', 'Lycans', 'come', 'out', 'critics', 'hated', 'loved', 'First-time', 'director', 'Patrick', 'Tatopoulos', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'did', 'FX', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'result', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'intense', 'claustrophobic', 'enjoyable', 'production', 'value', 'acting', 'particular', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Nighy', 'Sheen', 'back', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'Nighy', 'was', 'awesomely', 'over-the-top', 'have', 'betrayed', 'be', 'a-ni-mal', 'Sheen', 'wow', 'really', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'So', ""'d"", 'rank', 'Lycans', 'least', 'equal', 'first', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'fourth', 'ones']",N/A

What had previously been just good movies, became GREAT movies, and all because of just a few minutes here and a few minutes there of extra footage. It completely changed the flow of the film;fleshed it out and made it more complete.This is what has happened with Underworld-the inclusion of extra footage and deleted scenes into the original movie has completely changed it. Not only does it look great, but it made the story great. The characters have a history that is understandable and interestingly written. It was a real movie instead of just a stylish goth fantasy.

Centered in the middle of the war is Selene (Beckinsale), a beautiful vampire warrior, or ""Death Dealer"" as she calls herself. She exists solely to slaughter a band of werewolves known as ""Lycans"" that her clan has been battling for centuries. Although she is aligned with the vampires, Selene falls for a human turned werewolf named Michael Corvin (Speedman) after she discovers a Lycan plot to kidnap him. When the Lycans try to make their next move on Michael, Selene is there to fend off their vicious assault. As Selene races to save Michael and unravel the Lycan plot, Selene then discovers a secret that has terrifying repercussions for both tribes -- a secret which threatens to tip the balance of power in favor of the werewolves who have been on the losing of the struggle for centuries. And as far as Selene goes, she must decide if her future with Michael is worth betraying her own people.In conclusion, ""Underworld"" has it all!

The director was out of his depth and the plot and script were silly.This could have been a cool, gothy flick, with fans applauding any shameless MATRIX ripoffs. It could have gone for a campy appeal, relying on some interesting special effects to hold it up. Instead, it is unintentionally campy, humorless and the action sequences overall were boring.The plot, some sort of zero sum political battle between Werewolves and Vampires, when in the end they should all just get along, is a stinker. We have Werewolves versus Vampires, Vampires versus Vampires, and Big Movie versus Audience Apathy. In the end, neither Movie nor Audience win. And as for Werewolves versus Vampires, who cares?The political plotline is uninteresting, all betrayals will be telegraphed before you get the DVD out of the packaging, and the script is mainly the same two or three conversations/arguments ocurring over and over.The first action scene--in the subway--was cool. But the rest of the movie doesn't live up to it. One of the biggest problems with the action sequences was the almost total absence of innocent and oblivious Humans. The neat thing about the first MATRIX was that you were in on a secret while society-at-large was filled with a bunch of unhip squares, totally unaware of all the neato things and swell drama happening around them. If you are going to have cool action scenes in a movie like this, you want to have chaos and battles with a bunch of rubes getting in the way. More realistic that way. The gloomy Eastern European cityscape is cool, but it's not enough.Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress, and works hard to carry this thing, but in the end the overly-obvious attempt to set up a sequel looks a little desperate. I'm surprised that they are still going ahead with one, apparently due to start filming in September 2004.

It's also obvious that if it wasn't for Blade, I'd have a real problem with vampires and werewolves using guns.  I surprisingly didn't think it was a big deal seeing gunbattles between mythological creatures.  Hell, why not.So, it's vampires versus werewolves in an ultra-gothic cityscape were a petite Kate Bekinsale plays a 'Death Dealer'; essentially a werewolf hunter.  Uncovering a nefarious werewolf plot centered around an oblivious Scott Speedman and an apparent vampire traitor, the Death Dealer attempts to uncover the truth behind her tragic past and the fate of the two species.The Werewolves:  What can I say?  The werewolves were the best part of this film.  Not only do they live underground (...), but they also have the ability to change into their wolf form at will.  No freakin' out at the full moon, here.  They also came across like true warriors fighting for their own personal honor.  I also liked the twist surrounding the Lycan leader that sort of balanced both sides.The Vampires:  You know, I kind of laugh when I think about the motives behind the filmakers regarding how they handled the vampires.  In MY opinion, this movies actually TRIES to make fun of vampires and the whole neo-gothic subculture in general.  Think about it.  What did you see everytime Beckinsale's character stormed into Vampire HQ?  A bunch of guys just lounging around drinking wine and trying to 'out-attitude' everyone else.  In fact, most of the vampires came off as total wankers.  This theory was further confirmed when Viktor was 'awakened'.  This ancient vampire king was a total bad(...).  And he just looks around at his descendents like they're the biggest lot of sissies he's ever seen.  He didn't seem too happy with the current state of modern vampirism.  One of my favorite scenes was when he took on a Lycan bare-handed showing the sissie-vamps how a werewolf is to be dealt with.Underworld makes a strong attempt at neo-noir but falls short in its reliance on pointless action and an even more pointless love interest.

The audience that knows the rules and behaviors of Vampires and Werewolves, because they don't go into detail about that in the movie.  Not everyone will love it, but to those people who love vampire, werewolf, myth movies, (myself included), it was great!!!One of the first to combine the unlikely combinations of Vampires vs. Werewolves ( or Lycon as in the movie ).  The story was true to many beliefs (Vampires are stuck-up upper class, and werewolfs are more savage) and explored a plot line that revolves around inter-species connections.It was fanastic, the movie was very well done, with the color palette being a mix of dark blues, and gloomy atmospheres.  It was something out of movies like 'From Hell' and 'Interview from a Vampire'.  The actors were of course not all that good, but hey, what actors are really good in movies now a days? The heroine, Celine was good for the part in looks, and her counterpart, Micheal was not a bad match either.  They seemed compatable, but not to flashy in the romantic department, which was nice for the action-lovers, but a little lacking for a vampire movie.Whatever you are looking for in this movie, its there and i, along with hopefully many other fans, will be looking for a sequel or two to this mysterious and cryptic story.",5,Amazing action and in-depth story.,1073865600,"01 12, 2004",2004,1392,"['want', 'begin', ""'Underworld"", 'not', 'everyone', 'hightly', 'specific', 'certain', 'kind', 'audience', 'audience', 'rules', 'behaviors', 'Vampires', 'Werewolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'movie', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'love', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'myth', 'movies', 'included', 'was', 'great', 'One', 'first', 'combine', 'unlikely', 'combinations', 'Vampires', 'vs.', 'Werewolves', 'Lycon', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'true', 'many', 'beliefs', 'Vampires', 'are', 'stuck-up', 'upper', 'class', 'werewolfs', 'are', 'more', 'savage', 'explored', 'plot', 'line', 'inter-species', 'connections.It', 'was', 'fanastic', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'color', 'palette', 'being', 'mix', 'dark', 'blues', 'gloomy', 'atmospheres', 'was', 'something', 'movies', ""'From"", 'Hell', 'Vampire', 'actors', 'were', 'course', 'not', 'good', 'hey', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'movies', 'now', 'days', 'heroine', 'Celine', 'was', 'good', 'part', 'counterpart', 'Micheal', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'match', 'seemed', 'compatable', 'not', 'flashy', 'romantic', 'department', 'was', 'nice', 'action-lovers', 'little', 'lacking', 'vampire', 'movie.Whatever', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'i', 'hopefully', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'sequel', 'two', 'mysterious', 'cryptic', 'story']",N/A

It does not contain a solid style, nor does it contain fluidity.The story (promised by the commercials) is about a Romeo and Juliet-like vampire and warewolf flick, but the delivery simply had vampires who hunt warewolfs (and vice versa).The vampires were very boring and looked bored.  They all just sat around a loung, inside a fancy Victorian-age mansion and were wearing clothing suitable for the victorian age (with the exceptional trench coat and leather jacket.  I would have liked seeing the outfits if only the film did not cut away from that scene after two seconds.The warewolves live underground and constantly beat eachother up.  I did not bother asking for a reason.Somewhere in the film's ""plot"" is a conspiracy that dates a few thousand years back and makes the vampires look like bad guys.  How can you choose sides between vampires who carry a reflection in the mirror and DO NOT drink blood (throughout the entire film) and warewolves and beat up the vampires as if they were mere humans?To sum up my review (and you may notice that I did not give away the plot, but simply something of the ""story"") there is only one vampire in the film.  He is a ressurected elder who sucks blood, weilds a sword, dresses appropriately, takes initiative, and has, get this: super human strength!This was a horrid film, and to top it off it was actually LACKING style, predictable, and boring.P.S.Why would vampires fire pistols (automatic ones at that) when they can move quicker than the eye can see?",1,This film is not befitting a rating,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,1699,"['had', 'walked', 'movie', 'theatre', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'had', 'only', 'teriffic-looking', 'costumes.The', 'story', 'not', 'unoriginal', 'rather', 'unintentional', 'drivel', 'not', 'contain', 'solid', 'style', 'contain', 'fluidity.The', 'story', 'promised', 'commercials', 'Romeo', 'Juliet-like', 'vampire', 'warewolf', 'flick', 'delivery', 'simply', 'had', 'vampires', 'who', 'hunt', 'warewolfs', 'vice', 'versa', '.The', 'vampires', 'were', 'very', 'boring', 'looked', 'bored', 'just', 'sat', 'around', 'loung', 'fancy', 'Victorian-age', 'mansion', 'were', 'wearing', 'clothing', 'suitable', 'victorian', 'age', 'exceptional', 'trench', 'coat', 'leather', 'jacket', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seeing', 'outfits', 'only', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'cut', 'away', 'scene', 'two', 'seconds.The', 'warewolves', 'live', 'underground', 'constantly', 'beat', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'asking', 'reason.Somewhere', 'film', 'plot', 'conspiracy', 'few', 'thousand', 'years', 'back', 'vampires', 'look', 'bad', 'guys', 'How', 'can', 'choose', 'sides', 'vampires', 'who', 'carry', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'DO', 'NOT', 'drink', 'blood', 'entire', 'film', 'warewolves', 'beat', 'up', 'vampires', 'were', 'mere', 'humans', 'sum', 'up', 'review', 'may', 'notice', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'simply', 'something', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'vampire', 'film', 'ressurected', 'elder', 'who', 'blood', 'sword', 'appropriately', 'initiative', 'get', 'super', 'human', 'strength', 'was', 'horrid', 'film', 'top', 'off', 'was', 'actually', 'LACKING', 'style', 'predictable', 'boring.P.S.Why', 'would', 'vampires', 'fire', 'pistols', 'automatic', 'ones', 'when', 'can', 'move', 'quicker', 'eye', 'can', 'see']",N/A

785173,A1XFJV5ACZUQ2V,B0000VAFNQ,"nom de plume ""euphoricblasfemi""","[2, 9]","Ok. Let me just say it & get it out of the way - WORST MOVIE EVER!!There was so much potential with this movie - what happened?? Did the Editors go nuts and cut everything with substance? Did the producer/director come upon a good idea for a movie, and forget to hire a writer???Let me address the problems I had with this movie:1) No character development~! THe main female character kept the SAME expression on her face the ENTIRE movie! {""ooh, he's cute (angry face)"" or ""damn, i've been betrayed! (same angry face)""}The main male character simply reacted - no background, no character at all. He could have just as easily been added in the last 5 minutes of the movie. THe one character (who was a werewolf) in the movie that starts getting some background and depth - they kill off immediatly. Its almost as if someone was standing by saying ""no wait - we can't have that - people may start to be able to enjoy the movie! Kill him off quick!!""2) No story! No depth! No sense!! BY the end of the movie, you are wondering what the heck is going on! And by the time you find out - it's still no real explanation - just something thrown at you at the last moment, just to give you an easy answer - even though it doesn't even make sense. During the last epic battle - which is inevitable in this type of movie (i've got NO problem with that, i expected a formulaic type of movie - it's just everything else!) - you don't even know who to route for anymore. And not only that, it's been so slow and painful that you don't care!! You start to think - someone DIE already - JUST END THE PAIN!!3) Vampires are wussies! Now what's up with that? They can jump from a 30 story building to the ground without messing up their hair; or jump vertically 20 feet and cling to a ceiling - but if attacked, and without a gun, they run. And not just run - but run SLOWLY.4) Dude's hair! A minor complaint - but still very annoying. You literally never see the main male character's face - his hair is always covering it!! While I have no problem with a grunge look, or in the midst of a fight/heat of the moment mussed hair - for cripes sake - he works at a hospital, and his hair's all over the place!5) Some bad acting. Not the whole movie, but it's there. In a movie with a strong lead role, strong story, or *some* kind of strength somewhere - it would have gone unnoticed. However - with nothing more than a cool premise, it stood out as just more more thing to ensure this movie would never make it to the ""good flick"" category.6) Vampire girlie's clothes. While very cool, and while there WERE three outfits, they were so similar that she may as well have only had one. Variety? Hello? Just because she's a vamp doesn't mean she can only dress in one outfit, have one look on her face, or only one stomping walk. (angry look, angry clothes, angry walk) This may seem like a minor complaint, as is the one about the main male character's hair. But again, along with everything else, it gives the overbearing impression that this movie never had a writer - or, if a script was written, it was so badly mangled, edited and changed as to make it completely unrecognizable as a story.7) NO ENDING. Oh please - leaving it open for a sequel?? THE PAIN NEVER ENDS.I'd like to add that this movie had really great special effects. The werewolves changing, and the wire-work on the vampires was not only well done, but i'd even go as far as saying they were terrific! WHY oh WHY didn't they put that kind of effort and skill into the script?????In closing, I have to say I was incredibly disappointed in this movie. I expected formulaic. I expected predictable (boy, was i not let down there!) I even expected it to not get any Emmy nominations. But let me tell you - this movie would make any bad movie look good.Do yourself a favor.

I suspect between this movie and the colossal vampire story output by Anne Rice it was inevitable that any number of people would want to take this theme and idea in every direction imaginable.  This particular outing is not highbrow.This one is action packed.  From the beginning we&#8217;re shooting 30 -40 -50 rounds out of a single 8-9 bullet clip in a pistol.  Then, how some of the bullet victims can appear to squeeze their sphincter and have the bullets crawl out of the holes they&#8217;ve made in heads and bodies leaves me a bit curious, but it is kind of exciting.  I had to get used to the idea that some die and some don&#8217;t, and I never really figured out why because the movie was moving so quickly, and was exciting, so I just forgot to care why.  And I think that is what this movie is shooting for&#8230; exciting.  Unlike many &#8220;shoot &#8216;em up&#8221; fun-arcade like movies, this one actually has a story line.  A PLOT!  Actually there are a few subplots going on as well. Mind you, the story isn&#8217;t written by Jane Austen.How about this&#8230; there is enough &#8220;plot&#8221; left over to demand Volume II.  Let&#8217;s raise the Pom-Poms for sequels.  Think Kate Beckinsale in tight black shiny leather and superhuman strength.  But ladies, don&#8217;t cringe away from this one so quickly.  There is some kind of epic love thing going on here as well and plenty of &#8220;love story novel cover&#8221; type objects of affection.So, you know it is a vampire vs. werewolf shoot &#8216;em up story with a love story subplot.

785176,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B0000VAFNQ,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[5, 12]","There's barely an original moment in Underworld, and sadly those parts that are derived from elsewhere in motion picture history (that is, all of it), are derived without wit or feeling for their antecedents or the genre.I have a feeling this film would never have been made were it not for the Matrix. It basically is the Matrix, only with werewolves and vamps, and a blue wash over all the cinematography rather than a green one. So we have a hard-arsed chick in a tight patent-leather cat suit toting a sub-machine gun in each hand in a subway station, driving performance sports cars absurdly fast, performing aerial flips and other acrobatics. Only she's a vampire. With a laptop. We have perpetual rain: we have the trademark Wachowski straight-down shot of rain falling away from the camera onto parked cars in a narrow alley. There's a big final punch-up between two indestructible foes in a great big puddle.But while it rips off the Matrix's visuals, Underworld has neither the wit - the tongue-in-cheek film noir; the fairly well spec'd cod philosophy - nor any of the style: Kate Beckinsale is no Carrie Anne Moss, having about as much sex appeal as a Tupperware lunchbox, and I'm afraid to say the all-important fight choreography *really* blows.The bits that are original, sadly, tend to foul up the rest of the picture. To wit: pitting the ""lycans"" (nice try, by the way, to make werewolves sound hip. Didn't work) against vampires misses the fundamental point of both genres, which is the need-to-sleep-with-the-light-on-afterwards factor: they're supposed to GET US. And DRINK OUR BLOOD. In Underworld they're knocking six shades of hell out of each other (with guns... GUNS?? VAMPIRES WITH GUNS? What the hell is going on?), so rather than being terrifying, it plays out more like a moodily lit feature-length episode of the World Wrestling Federation. You don't really care who wins as long as there is damn good fight. But, as noted, the fight choreography is Woe Ful than Wo Ping.There's zero chemistry between any of Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy or the other one and Kate - it's understandable, fellahs; it's hard to love an airtight plastic container.Sophia Myles plays a decidedly plot-functional blonde vamp-girl who pops up at critical moments to push the narrative along, but doesn't end up having much to do with anything. I think she's rather petulantly sent to her room just before the climax, and you never see her again. Since she was about the most interesting part of the picture, that's a pity. For my money, Myles would have been a better female lead than Beckinsale.A special ""opportunity knocks"" award should go to Bill Nighy, who's been underachieving in British TV dramas since 1979 or so, never showing up in anything of note, who finally snags a peach of a part in Love Actually, and now you can't get the old buzzard off your screen - a fading rock star there; a sleazy Tory MP in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet; a lecherous 19th Colonel in He Knew He Was Right and a now a thousand year old vampire uber-lord in Underworld, and ALL of them portrayed as exactly the same character! Even Kevin Costner would be impressed with that!Not sure what he would have made of the rest of the film, however.Olly Buxton",2,Silly and derivative,1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,3237,"['barely', 'original', 'moment', 'Underworld', 'sadly', 'parts', 'are', 'derived', 'elsewhere', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'are', 'derived', 'wit', 'feeling', 'antecedents', 'genre.I', 'have', 'feeling', 'film', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'were', 'not', 'Matrix', 'basically', 'Matrix', 'only', 'werewolves', 'vamps', 'blue', 'wash', 'cinematography', 'rather', 'green', 'one', 'have', 'hard-arsed', 'chick', 'tight', 'patent-leather', 'cat', 'suit', 'toting', 'sub-machine', 'gun', 'hand', 'subway', 'station', 'driving', 'performance', 'sports', 'cars', 'absurdly', 'fast', 'performing', 'aerial', 'flips', 'other', 'acrobatics', 'Only', 'vampire', 'laptop', 'have', 'perpetual', 'rain', 'have', 'trademark', 'Wachowski', 'straight-down', 'shot', 'rain', 'falling', 'away', 'camera', 'parked', 'cars', 'narrow', 'alley', 'big', 'final', 'punch-up', 'two', 'indestructible', 'foes', 'great', 'big', 'puddle.But', 'Matrix', 'visuals', 'Underworld', 'wit', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'film', 'noir', 'fairly', 'well', 'spec', ""'d"", 'cod', 'philosophy', 'style', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Carrie', 'Anne', 'Moss', 'having', 'as', 'much', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Tupperware', 'lunchbox', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'say', 'all-important', 'fight', 'choreography', '*really*', 'blows.The', 'bits', 'are', 'original', 'sadly', 'tend', 'foul', 'up', 'rest', 'picture', 'wit', 'pitting', 'lycans', 'nice', 'try', 'way', 'make', 'werewolves', 'sound', 'hip', 'Did', ""n't"", 'work', 'vampires', 'fundamental', 'point', 'genres', 'need-to-sleep-with-the-light-on-afterwards', 'factor', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'GET', 'US', 'DRINK', 'OUR', 'BLOOD', 'Underworld', ""'re"", 'knocking', 'six', 'shades', 'hell', 'other', 'guns', 'GUNS', 'VAMPIRES', 'WITH', 'GUNS', 'What', 'hell', 'going', 'so', 'rather', 'being', 'terrifying', 'out', 'more', 'moodily', 'lit', 'feature-length', 'episode', 'World', 'Wrestling', 'Federation', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'who', 'as', 'long', 'damn', 'good', 'fight', 'noted', 'fight', 'choreography', 'Woe', 'Ful', 'Wo', 'Ping.There', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'other', 'one', 'Kate', 'understandable', 'fellahs', 'hard', 'love', 'airtight', 'plastic', 'container.Sophia', 'Myles', 'decidedly', 'plot-functional', 'blonde', 'vamp-girl', 'who', 'up', 'critical', 'moments', 'push', 'narrative', 'along', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'having', 'much', 'do', 'anything', 'think', 'rather', 'petulantly', 'sent', 'room', 'just', 'climax', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'picture', 'pity', 'money', 'Myles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'female', 'lead', 'Beckinsale.A', 'special', 'opportunity', 'knocks', 'award', 'should', 'go', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'been', 'underachieving', 'British', 'TV', 'dramas', '1979', 'so', 'never', 'showing', 'up', 'anything', 'note', 'who', 'finally', 'peach', 'part', 'Love', 'Actually', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'old', 'buzzard', 'screen', 'fading', 'rock', 'star', 'there', 'sleazy', 'Tory', 'MP', 'Auf', 'Wiedersehen', 'Pet', 'lecherous', '19th', 'Colonel', 'Knew', 'Was', 'Right', 'now', 'thousand', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'uber-lord', 'Underworld', 'ALL', 'portrayed', 'exactly', 'same', 'character', 'Even', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'would', 'be', 'impressed', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'rest', 'film', 'however.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A
785177,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0000VAFNQ,Only-A-Child,"[3, 4]","The ""Underworld"" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original.  Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget ""mainstream movie"" I have seen in years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in ""The Untouchables"", you see an illustration of why less is better; and ""Underworld"" expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a ""Godzilla"" film.Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint.  She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: ""This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a reflective rubber suit and you have something to anchor your movie"". All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story.  I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to-can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.Then again, what do I know?

785178,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B0000VAFNQ,OverTheMoon,"[2, 7]","In an unknown city, vampires and werewolves have been waging a battle that has lasted for thousands of years. The vampires are growing weaker and the werewolves are growing stronger which causes werewolf hunter and vampire, Kate Beckinsale, to suspect that something is brewing when she witnesses the werewolves chase after a human who may have something special about him. So this sitcom plot develops with bloodlines and bad guys turning good guys and good guys turning bad guys and the story just becomes a very tedious episode of Dallas as we learn more about the characters' roots and their connections with surprise twists like - ""Bobby, I'm pregnant"" or ""J.R shot my dad"". Underworld simply has no direction whatsoever. It is not until the last few minutes of the movie that all is revealed but by then you don't really care and are more than laughing at how seriously this film takes itself for all its ridiculousness.Underworld looks good most of the time but the Matrix sound effects only bring the film's style down a notch. Neo and Trinity with fangs this is not. As a competitor to films like Dark City and The Crow it doesn't even touch on the plot or gothic look of these movies. The dream sequences in Underworld are directly ripped from the same effect as Frodo seeing the eye when he puts on the ring of power. Now and again blaring plot holes surface that slap you across the face. Vampires have reflections? A lot of the film does not make sense.So how does it work out in terms of popcorn fodder? Well Blade or Blade II is certainly leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Underworld kept my attention for all of it, but still I think I have forgotten most of it by the time I came to write this review. It is simply a no-brainer with elements that you have all seen too many times before.

785181,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B0000VAFNQ,Paperbackstash,"[0, 2]","Underworld is a sleek, stylish action/horror flick that did pretty well at the box office. It touted an appetizing lead and promised mucho action, slow mo movements, and an intriguing tale. While it did deliver on all this (and more), it didn't get my horror heart a pumping, mainly for the very reasons it boasted.Don't get me wrong, sleep directing and beautiful cinematography usually go hand in  hand with a good movie, no matter what the genre. This is a good nod in the movies direction. I just couldn't find much substance under this shiny pearl. From point A to point Z, we have fighting,  quarreling, fighting, plot, combating, plot, and fighting some more. Much like the Matrix and Blade, the film focuses primarily on kicking skills over chilling skills. If you have vampires and lycanthropes in the mix, it's always a good idea to attempt some fear too.As the plot unfolds, there is an old war between the fangs and the furries. Selene, who is the beautiful vampire assassin, finds out there is going to be an attempt by the sneaky werewolves to kidnap Michael Corvin, a human. This may help cease the war finally, but not in the way Selene wants it to end. Naturally she interferes, but her blood starts heating at the sight of the werewolf bitten human. Another plot obstacle is that she begins going against her people in her decisions.The story itself sounds good on paper and could have looked terrific on screen. Instead they chose to not pay enough attention to plot development. Action and plot intermingling has to be done carefully, or else you just get an all out action fest without much point, or an interesting story that doesn't have enough fight scenes to satisfy action hounds. It's a hard situation to beat, and frankly they didn't succeed here in the way I'd have liked. If the story were more developed, if I had cared more about some of the characters, and if more menace had been mixed with bite, I would have been a much happier camper.Also, since one of the driving forces behind the plot is supposed to be a romantic love mess between Selene and the mortal, it was poorly unexplored. We gets hints here and there of this and that, but nothing in the face that shows us how truly valuable the love is to either. It's almost an afterthought and behind the scenes kind of deal. If this had been played up more in the story, I'd be delighted.As with any movie of this form, weapons are galore. It's not just the moves the audience gets to drool over, it's the artillery. Our eyes get treated with supernatural critters being slayed with silver blade and bullets filled with such yummy substances as silver nitrate. Pretty cool stuff. The action sequences were fine as they stood; plenty of blustering and quarreling made stylish. Some of the scenes were heart racing and visually strong, I must give the movie credit for that.For the acting, Kate Beckinsale was a great advertising tool. I'm sure many teenage (and adult) boys were itching to see the flick just to see the hot foreign actress in tight, black leather. To her credit, she does act well, but her character is relatively lifeless. I didn't see as emotion as I would have liked. It's spoken of what she goes through, and shown, but I didn't get the fear/drama/sadness from her personality alone. As an assassin that's determined and strong, she comes through here with shining colors. Lucian was the best of them all, as he had more character development and was someone I actually gave a damn about. He had a purpose, a motivation, and reasoning behind this was fulfilled. Way to go there. Bill Nighy as the resurrected ancient did his role very well.While I didn't warm up to everything here, I have to get credit to the directing. Positively breathtaking. The film has a purposeful blue hue cast over it, painting it a gorgeous gothic shade. Doom and gloom is easily felt during each frame. The effects of Underworld were nothing short of amazing. Werewolves looked most convincing, without using much CGI. The blood and gore were plentiful enough to obtain an R rating, so this was a plus as well. The soundtrack is strong and pleasing to the ears, a great match.Since we're dealing with vamps and wolves here I'd have preferred more fang versus claw. Instead we get weapons and guns, which in a way doesn't quite fit. Overall a movie that's shiny and sparkly but also lackluster. Could have been better than it was.

The story is weak, contrieved and full of umbelievable elements.Having said that, I have to say this:When I first heard about the movie, I thought &quot;Now that's a great idea... werewolves vs. vampires&quot;. But when the film actually began, I discovered I was wrong.For me, the problem lies in the fact that this movie does not know what it is. Is it a horror film? Is it an action movie? Is it Sci-Fi? It tries to be &quot;The Matrix&quot; with it's there's-a-higher-plot-behind-this-plot approach. I don't think it works nearly half as well. The story seems quite simple in the beginning with the old narrated explanation formula that sets the story. Then the film goes on forever and new complications keep on coming (and they get to be more and more unbelievable). The screenwriter thought he was constructing a grandiose story... but instead of this he created a pompous story... that's all.Then comes the image. Most of the time, it has this annoying effect of flashlighting which supposedly gives the film a &quot;thunder-like&quot; thing thoughout the entire film. This is not new and has been used many times before with great effect. The problem here is exactly that every effect is overdone...Then comes the looks. The film has this I've-seen-this-cool-before look that obviously comes from (you guessed it) &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Maybe they used the same wardrobe... duh! But the thing that annoys me most is (for instance) the fact that the mansion where the vampires live seems like a lobby of a big disco... (laughs) nice-looking people sitting there doing nothing.Then comes the characters... there's simply no one there for you to like!!! They are always full of (too) serious faces expressing the oh-so-big crisis and hidden agendas behind it all. And the story starts to be so pompous that you don't care about what happens next.Then comes the ludicrous aspects of the screenplay... werewolves and vampires are engaged in a battle that is centuries old (all this backstory is stupid)... they have lots of technology and weapons (James Bond-like gadgets) and keep on loudly blowing everything that comes in the middle... and yet they are a veeeery secret thing that we humans do not know about. They blow everything and no one ever asks what's going on... Hmmm... ok.... and the cars... They destroy a Jaguar just to have a Maseratti on the next scene....It's all too cool to be believable. Keep your copies of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Blade&quot; instead. At least these films have much better characters!And it is 2 hours long!!!!Go check &quot;AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON&quot;, &quot;THE HOWLING&quot;, &quot;FRIGHT NIGHT&quot; and &quot;NEAR DARK&quot; instead... just to name a few.",1,I DID NOT LIKE IT.....

The vampires live in big mansions, the werewolves live in the sewers. Both sides have adapted to using modern technology in their quest to rid the Underworld of the other. Along the way, the Lycans are looking for a human that may hold the key to shifting the war in their favor.On the positive side, this movie looks cool. The background, costumes, scenery, and music portray a dark, gothic world. The weapons are also sleek and stylish.On the other hand, the acting is usually stale, and the plot gets bumpy and disjointed.

It takes the classic Hatfields and McCoys story line and substitues vampires and lycans(werewolves) for the two families.  The vampire elders ensure this by forbidding their people to learn any history.  I must say though the weapons that each side use are much more impressive than backwoods shotguns.  Each side has highly engineered weapons that target the others weakness.  The vampires have bullets containing silver nitrate of which the werewolves cannot surive.  Similarly the werewolves have ultraviolet bullets that are lethal to the vampires.The plot hinges around the revenge that the werewolves seek on the upper class vampires.  Kate Beckinsale gives a good performance as the central ""death dealer"" of the vampires.  In the beginning diligently carries out her duty to hunt down and kill the werewolves, but as the story progresses she will learn of betrayals on many levels.  In the midst of this she falls in love with a ""human"" Michael Corvin who holds the key to everything.  Meanwhile, Lucian, is rallying the werewolves to defeat the vampires while conducting some odd genetic expirements.  One of the differences between this and other vampire/werewolf movies is that genetics is used to explain these creatures rather than myth and lore.The effects and sound of the movie are great.

Vulgar, lacking in brainpower and inspiration (unlike the wonderful old mad doctors and madmen, who made you think they were more reasonable than the ""sane"" people around them), the horror film has been hijacked just like the good values of a religion giving way to the rages of fanatics and fundamentalists. But, I found Underworld to be an exception. Fast paced, an attempt at a sensible story, and it contains conflict that one can relate to from all opposing characters. At some point, you almost wonder who is right and who is wrong. Great looking film (with focus as sharp as a tack), especially well done considering that it is night throughout most of the movie. Except for the dialogue often being buried and hard to understand without blasting your ears into deafness, the sound  mix is, otherwise, fantastic.

While it's not a groundbreaking film, it's a highly entertaining one, and one that, for me, is something I can rewatch several times per year.The filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can't see what's going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting.

And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by ""The Matrix"", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie.The only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there's not a single joke in the entire thing!

Perhaps it is my own lack of imagination that has led me to believe there aren't many angles left to explore for this genre, but this movie version of Kazimieras G. Prapuolenis' comic strip ""Underworld"" may have just proven me wrong, having explored whatever angles were left. I've never read the comic strip, so I can't say whether or not the movie sticks with the strip; but the movie is riveting nevertheless.Underworld had my attention from the very beginning all the way to the end. Considering the fact that this story could easily have enough material for a mini-series, the director masterfully and mercifully edits the story and footage; crafting a well-made movie without lulls or unnecessary scenes, which keeps the story moving at all times. There is a Romeo & Juliet type surprise, but it will not be evident for most of the movie.One of the great things about this movie is that it has a dark, Gothic feel to it that pervades the cinematography of entire movie, which provides the perfect setting for a vicarious ride into the Underworld.Now for the story: the Lycans are werewolf rebels, the Vampires are immortal overlords and there is a great deal of lamentatious history between the two of them. There are over five hundred years of animosity between the Lycans and Vampires, most of which is covered in parts of the movie's dialog or storyline.Seline (Kate Beckinsale) is jaded and nonconforming; yet she is incredibly beautiful and soon discovers a softness underneath her hard exterior. Believing that the Lycans murdered her family when she was a child, Seline devotes herself to exterminating all Lycans from existence with extreme prejudice alongside the other members of her Lycan-killing vampire clan, the Death Dealers.One day, she encounters a situation where a human becomes involved in the struggle. Up to this point no human has ever been made aware of the happenings in the Underworld. Having been bitten by a Lycan, the human, named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), is purposefully left alive. He has been targeted by the Lycans for reasons unknown to him or the vampires. But the Lycans know, thanks to the dark master of the Lycan horde, Lucian. Lucian is known only through legend and thought to have died long ago, but he is back; and he has a deviously diabolical plot to get revenge on the vampires. In particular, his undying and justifiably livid grievance is with Viktor (Bill Lighy), a brazen, arrogant, and stoic supreme Vampire overlord who has been in a medically induced slumber for two hundred years. You will find out what that grievance is in the movie.There is also connection between the character Kraven (Shane Brolly) and Lucian that I will not divulge. But he is a power hungry, aristocratic vampire with ambitions of securing a place of power within the hierarchy vampire elders; and is willing to do whatever it takes to do it.So how did all the contention start? Watch the movie and find out.Although some may feel that the relationship between Seline and Michael was not explored deep enough, I think it was developed just enough; further development of their relationship would have made the film too long. Aside from that minor quip, which is not my complaint, I think most people who watch it with an open mind will enjoy the movie. For some, this has the making of a cult classic, and I think I may just be one of them (and I do not particularly like this genre).",5,Romeo and Juliet of the Underworld,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,3504,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'much', 'vampire', 'movie', 'buff', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'own', 'lack', 'imagination', 'led', 'believe', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'angles', 'left', 'explore', 'genre', 'movie', 'version', 'Kazimieras', 'G.', 'Prapuolenis', 'comic', 'strip', 'Underworld', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'proven', 'wrong', 'having', 'explored', 'angles', 'were', 'left', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'strip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'movie', 'sticks', 'strip', 'movie', 'riveting', 'nevertheless.Underworld', 'had', 'attention', 'very', 'beginning', 'way', 'end', 'Considering', 'fact', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'enough', 'material', 'mini-series', 'director', 'masterfully', 'mercifully', 'story', 'footage', 'crafting', 'well-made', 'movie', 'lulls', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'story', 'moving', 'times', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'type', 'surprise', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'evident', 'most', 'movie.One', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'dark', 'Gothic', 'feel', 'cinematography', 'entire', 'movie', 'perfect', 'setting', 'vicarious', 'ride', 'Underworld.Now', 'story', 'Lycans', 'are', 'werewolf', 'rebels', 'Vampires', 'are', 'immortal', 'overlords', 'great', 'deal', 'lamentatious', 'history', 'two', 'are', 'five', 'hundred', 'years', 'animosity', 'Lycans', 'Vampires', 'most', 'covered', 'parts', 'movie', 'dialog', 'storyline.Seline', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'jaded', 'nonconforming', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'soon', 'discovers', 'softness', 'hard', 'exterior', 'Believing', 'Lycans', 'murdered', 'family', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Seline', 'exterminating', 'Lycans', 'existence', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'other', 'members', 'Lycan-killing', 'vampire', 'clan', 'Death', 'Dealers.One', 'day', 'situation', 'where', 'human', 'involved', 'struggle', 'Up', 'point', 'human', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'aware', 'happenings', 'Underworld', 'Having', 'been', 'bitten', 'Lycan', 'human', 'named', 'Michael', 'Corvin', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'purposefully', 'left', 'alive', 'been', 'targeted', 'Lycans', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'vampires', 'Lycans', 'know', 'thanks', 'dark', 'master', 'Lycan', 'horde', 'Lucian', 'Lucian', 'known', 'only', 'legend', 'thought', 'have', 'died', 'long', 'ago', 'back', 'deviously', 'diabolical', 'plot', 'get', 'revenge', 'vampires', 'particular', 'undying', 'justifiably', 'livid', 'grievance', 'Viktor', 'Bill', 'Lighy', 'brazen', 'arrogant', 'stoic', 'supreme', 'Vampire', 'overlord', 'who', 'been', 'medically', 'induced', 'slumber', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'grievance', 'movie.There', 'also', 'connection', 'character', 'Kraven', 'Shane', 'Brolly', 'Lucian', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'power', 'hungry', 'aristocratic', 'vampire', 'ambitions', 'securing', 'place', 'power', 'hierarchy', 'vampire', 'elders', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'do', 'it.So', 'how', 'did', 'contention', 'start', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.Although', 'may', 'feel', 'relationship', 'Seline', 'Michael', 'was', 'not', 'explored', 'deep', 'enough', 'think', 'was', 'developed', 'just', 'enough', 'further', 'development', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'Aside', 'minor', 'quip', 'not', 'complaint', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'making', 'cult', 'classic', 'think', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'particularly', 'genre']",N/A

For some reason nothing gets me into a movie like a good werewolf.  If you're like me and you love supernatural critters onscreen, then this is the flick for you.A sort of industrial remake of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Underworld"" pits warring clans of vampires and werewolves against one another in a dark, stormy, goth-chic world straight out of ""The Matrix"" or its far superior predecessor ""The Crow.""  Our Juliet is the vampires' chief assassin, while Romeo is a hapless med student bitten by our heroine's furry foes.Yes, this is a movie that stresses style and visual spectacle far above plot and substance.  So what?  You came to see a movie about a hot vampiress in leather shooting up a bunch of werewolves, you can't expect Oscar material here.  That said, there are some refreshingly unexpected plot twists, and the line between protagonist and antagonist often becomes blurred -- or flipped completely.  There are no good guys or bad guys here: you can choose whichever beastie you like to root for.

785205,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B0000VAFNQ,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","I don't know about you guys, but I love the Underworld series. This series, along with Blade is what made me a fan of vampires films. Before then, I wrote them off because most of them are love stories. What I failed to realize it that they should be love stories, and I had a misconception of what vampires were all about. Abraham (""Bram"") Stroker's original Dracula novel from 1897 was a love story through and through. Even Underworld is a love story at heart. The same argument could be made for Blade, since his love for his mother, and hatred for the monsters that stole her from him is what drove his quest for vengeance. Underworld is more like a Gothic Romeo and Juliet. The difference, and it's a big one, is that the second sexiest actress in the world stars as Selene. The first being Scarlett Johansson. And not only is the lead sexy, but the co-stars are two of my favorite British actors. I love Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy is amazing. If Simon Pegg and Ian McKellen were in this, I don't know what I would do will all of that British awesomeness. Yes, I love the cast, but the action is pretty good in this movie as well. Comparisons to The Matrix have been made countless times. I don't blame anyone for doing so. Over the course of the franchise, Underworld has found its niche, and moved away from such comparisons.The finale  in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. I do happen to love werewolves as well. They are only my favorite movie monsters in cinema history. In fact, I just recently watched An American Werewolf In London because I did not feel right calling myself a fan of the beast, not having seen ""The Best Werewolf Movie Of All-Time"". That said, I don't think they were at their best in this one. They moved too slow to me. I appreciate prostetics over CGI, but make it more believable at least. There is no way a real werewolf would walk straight at someone that slowly if they were shooting at, or whipping it. I can't hold that against the film too much though, because that's only of sign of Underworld's lower budget, especially compared to its sequels. Van Helsing, while it isn't the best film, has some of my personal favorite werewolves. That said, I still enjoyed the R&J-esque; story, and how it combined the already connected lores.The story is aided wonderfully by the dark tone and visuals. The gothic look was used perfectly. The vampires' home was a particularly well done set piece. As was the final set where the last fight took place. Speaking of that particular fight, I think it was a tad too short, but the choreography was nicely paced. It allowed you to see every detail, but it didn't move too slowly. I can say that for the entire film actually. The pacing is great, and the lack of quick-cuts allow to to become immersed in the Underworld universe. As a fan of the entire series, I may be biased. I can admit that I see the films' flaws, but still find much more to love in them. I don't blame anyone for not liking these movies, but I don't get the hate. I think it's a lot better than the reception it has received, and certainly worth a watch for anyone who likes vampires or werewolves. Also, you see how easy it is to write a review for vampire/werewolf love stories without bashing Twilight? Yes, it's very easy indeed. I think Twilight is just a female's version of this story. Even though the lead is a female, it is still a movie, or series that caters to a large male audience. And there isn't much that needs to be said for the picture and audio quality of the Blu-rays. Each film in the series is pretty much reference quality.

The idea of a whole separate &quot;underworld&quot; co-existing with ours, wherein vampires and lycans battle each other is pretty neat, but it's hard to imagine a movie doing LESS with the concept.

And that's a reason to watch just about anything. The question is, is there anything else about this movie worth watching? I'm not entirely sure whether I can give a definitive answer to that question, but I'm leaning towards ""no"".The plot-- what there is of it-- revolves around Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire from a clan who've been at war with a clan of werewolves (known as the Lyken, because in Hollywood, everything is cooler if you shorten it), heade dby the enigmatic Lucian (Michael Sheen) for a long, long time. And, well, I'd have to go well into the second half of the movie to give you more of a plot summary than that, because it takes this movie forever to actually come up with a plot. (When it does arrive, it's a rather loose definition of the term anyway.) The main thing you need to know is that a human medical student, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), gets in the way.Perhaps I'm giving the movie short shrift, and when it was originally conceived, there was a much stronger, more coherent storyline. Still, that's not what we ended up getting.

785209,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B0000VAFNQ,Robert Graves,"[1, 2]","This is very ambitious film about vampires and werewolves. Apparently, vampires and werewolves (or ""lycans"" - apparently ""werewolf"" was too mundane a moniker for the filmmakers) have been warring with each other for centuries, right up to the present day. We get to see plenty of flashbacks throughout this historical war, and this sub-story is the best part of the movie. The rest consists of the modern-day adaptation of these creatures - vampires that make artificial blood, perform genetic experiments, and have computerized storage for the undead. In some respects this is interesting, since if these creatures did exist they would probably adapt in this way. But I was far more interested in the backstory, of which we see too little.There's a weak love story, brought down by Kate Beckinsale's knock-off matrix performance - we've already seen the pouty, emotionless hot brunette in latex, haven't we? - and an interesting twist involving who the real bad guys are. But for the most part it's harmless action, peppered with peaks of an interesting story that's not fully developed. I recommend renting, not buying. It's not going to have much repeat watchability. Although the concept is interesting, it's not pulled off in a convincing way. It could have been much better with a more dynamic female lead, a bad guy who wasn't such a weanie (Michael Sheen as Lucian).",3,Underachiever,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,1374,"['very', 'ambitious', 'film', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'Apparently', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'lycans', 'apparently', 'werewolf', 'was', 'too', 'mundane', 'moniker', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'been', 'warring', 'other', 'centuries', 'right', 'up', 'present', 'day', 'get', 'see', 'plenty', 'flashbacks', 'historical', 'war', 'sub-story', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'rest', 'modern-day', 'adaptation', 'creatures', 'vampires', 'make', 'artificial', 'blood', 'perform', 'genetic', 'experiments', 'have', 'computerized', 'storage', 'undead', 'respects', 'interesting', 'creatures', 'did', 'exist', 'would', 'probably', 'adapt', 'way', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'backstory', 'see', 'too', 'little.There', 'weak', 'love', 'story', 'brought', 'down', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'knock-off', 'matrix', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'pouty', 'emotionless', 'hot', 'brunette', 'latex', 'have', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'twist', 'involving', 'who', 'real', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'harmless', 'action', 'peppered', 'peaks', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'recommend', 'renting', 'not', 'buying', 'not', 'going', 'have', 'much', 'repeat', 'watchability', 'concept', 'interesting', 'not', 'pulled', 'off', 'convincing', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'dynamic', 'female', 'lead', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'weanie', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Lucian']",N/A

Yes, I only give it three stars but this is average in my book and this film is average. It's no Interview with the Vampire, but compared to modern- day vampire movies, average is a great compliment. It had what we modern- day viewers love, a whole lot of weapons and fast movement and loud noises that will leave you deaf. The leather I think was a little cliche but oh well. Kate Beckingsale was actually quite good in this film compared to her paper- thin performance on Van Helsing. She pulled off being a no- nonsense, semi- feeling vampire and she fought well. The others actors were fine as well, but Kate Beckingsale is truly the only one who shines.The plot is simple. Vampires against werewolves. Or so it seems. At the end of the movie you see there's a deeper meaning to the the head werewolf but I won't blow it away. But for the main body of vampires and werewolves it's just a main battle for power and dominance. Sounds cool.But the movie lost two stars because of the hardly- there romance that was to be promised between the vampire Beckingsale and the man she's trying to save who eventually ends up a werewolf. The romance everyone was talking about was not there whatsoever between those two. Matter of fact, this movie is hardly emotional. It's cold and the characters are all stone- faced for the good part of the movie. So don't bother buying a box of tissues or anything. That's fine with me though, but when they say there's a romance I expect to see something brewing! Another problem was I didn't think they made the plot as great as it could have been. Maybe it's just me, but I was expecting more than what was given, and a little more depth to the characters.Overall nonetheless, it was worth seeing once, and at least this movie respected the myth of vampires and werewolves, unlike so many other films.

Except, this is also a tale of vampires and werewolves.Selene (Beckinsale) is a &quot;death dealer&quot;, a vampire soldier who dedicates her life to killing the Lycans (the werewolves). On one of her stakeouts, she spots two Lycans following a human, Michael Corvis (Speedman) for reasons unknown to her. After a confrontation with the Lycans, she starts discovering many secrets about the war amongst the two races and about Michael.Now, how can a movie about vampires *and* werewolves go wrong? I really don't know, but this movie manages to disappoint. Mind you, it's a fine movie. It's fun, it's got good action scenes, it's got good f/x, but there's something missing. Maybe the story or the character development could have been handled somewhat differently (a little more back story, perhaps?). The acting is another thing; Beckinsale is pretty good in this, but the role offers very few moments to shine. Speedman is barely on this side of being a wooden totem, and the rest of the cast tend to over act whatever few lines they have (and what's with the voice of the big, black Lycan?).The look of the film is quite good. Very dark and moody. The costumes are very Matrix-y (as well as some of the f/x) but their given proper use. The transformation of the Lycans is not as good as it could have been, but it doesn't really take from the film.In my opinion, this movie could have been made better with a little bit more back story and better character development (we get where Selene is coming from, but the rest? Only Lucian (Sheen), the head Lycan receives a bit of explanation).The movie's ending lets the door open for a sequel, and talks are supposed to have been going on about not only one but two new movies, one of them being a prequel.

Zwick,"[5, 8]","Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. would be turning over in their respective graves if they could get a gander at ""Underworld,"" a tale about a war between vampires and werewolves that turns this potentially interesting conflict into one long, unending shootout.Gone are the days when Count Dracula and Barnabas Collins defined for us the image of a vampire.  No longer are these ""creatures of the night"" the suave, well-dressed aristocrats who inexorably - often reluctantly - seduced unsuspecting bystanders into baring their necks to fulfill the need for human blood.  The vampires in ""Underworld"" can't be bothered with such mundane and hokey paraphernalia as coffins, crosses, or cloves of garlic - not even with turning into bats at the first hint of trouble.  These modern day vampires talk on cell phones, drive fancy sports cars, use personal computers and fight with all the high tech weaponry modern technology and a limitless studio budget can provide.  With all this fun gadgetry to choose from, what's the point in being a vampire anymore?  The result of this is that ""Underworld"" plays more like an over-the-top gangster action film that just happens to feature supernatural elements than a horror film rooted in centuries' old traditions.The werewolves are even less interesting than the vampires in this film.  Not only are both camps indistinguishable from one another in looks and appearance, but the werewolves actually come across as surprisingly ludicrous and unconvincing in the few scenes in which they undergo their lycanthropic transformations.  Special effects have become so impressive in recent years that even they have a hard time exciting an audience anymore.  A case in point:  when oh when are action film directors going to jettison that most annoying of all action movie clich&eacute;s - gun battle scenes filmed in slow motion?  ""Underworld"" has them in spades and they quickly become tiresome and boring.  Even the typical urban gothic look of the film - replete with rain-soaked city streets and a perpetual thunderstorm taking place in the background - reminds us instantly of dozens of other, mostly superior outings like ""The Crow,"" ""Darkman,"" ""Batman"" etc.""Underworld"" should have stayed below the ground where it belongs.",2,makes one yearn for the good old days,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,2260,"['Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'would', 'be', 'turning', 'respective', 'graves', 'could', 'get', 'gander', 'Underworld', 'tale', 'war', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'conflict', 'one', 'long', 'unending', 'shootout.Gone', 'are', 'days', 'when', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'defined', 'image', 'vampire', 'No', 'longer', 'are', 'creatures', 'night', 'suave', 'well-dressed', 'aristocrats', 'who', 'inexorably', 'often', 'reluctantly', 'seduced', 'unsuspecting', 'bystanders', 'baring', 'necks', 'fulfill', 'need', 'human', 'blood', 'vampires', 'Underworld', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'such', 'mundane', 'hokey', 'paraphernalia', 'coffins', 'crosses', 'cloves', 'garlic', 'not', 'even', 'turning', 'bats', 'first', 'hint', 'trouble', 'modern', 'day', 'talk', 'cell', 'phones', 'drive', 'fancy', 'sports', 'cars', 'use', 'personal', 'computers', 'fight', 'high', 'tech', 'weaponry', 'modern', 'technology', 'limitless', 'studio', 'budget', 'can', 'provide', 'fun', 'gadgetry', 'choose', 'what', 'point', 'being', 'vampire', 'anymore', 'result', 'Underworld', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'gangster', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'feature', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'horror', 'film', 'rooted', 'centuries', 'old', 'traditions.The', 'werewolves', 'are', 'even', 'less', 'interesting', 'vampires', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'camps', 'indistinguishable', 'one', 'looks', 'appearance', 'werewolves', 'actually', 'come', 'surprisingly', 'ludicrous', 'unconvincing', 'few', 'scenes', 'undergo', 'lycanthropic', 'transformations', 'Special', 'effects', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'impressive', 'recent', 'years', 'even', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'exciting', 'audience', 'anymore', 'case', 'point', 'when', 'oh', 'when', 'are', 'action', 'film', 'directors', 'going', 'jettison', 'most', 'annoying', 'action', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'gun', 'battle', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'slow', 'motion', 'Underworld', 'spades', 'quickly', 'become', 'tiresome', 'boring', 'Even', 'typical', 'urban', 'gothic', 'look', 'film', 'replete', 'rain-soaked', 'city', 'streets', 'perpetual', 'thunderstorm', 'taking', 'place', 'background', 'instantly', 'dozens', 'other', 'mostly', 'superior', 'outings', 'Crow', 'Darkman', 'Batman', 'etc', 'Underworld', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'ground', 'where']",N/A

Still, to be disappointed on top of that was a big letdown. I love monsters. I love vampires. I love werewolves. I would have accepted this movie a bit more if they had left out the references to these classic fiends and created a whole different type of demonic bad guy that *should* use guns.Insistance on using these two familiar and well loved creatures of the night was nothing more than a hook to draw in an audience; beyond that the people/creatures had no resemblnce whatsoever to the two legendary monsters. The mere idea of these supposedly vicious and blood/flesh hungry beasties running around shooting special guns at each other for no other reason than &quot;we are at war&quot; is as ludicrous as a starving man shooting a cow and not eating it.Okay, the premise? Vampires and werewolves are at war, and we don't find out why until the end, which is nonclimatic and doesn't make any sense. There is one person on the earth that contains blood that the werewolves want, the vampires see the lycans chasing the human so they chase him down too. Yawn. That's it.What I didn't like about the movie? Other than what I mentioned above, the plot was so thin you could read a newspaper through it. The script was horrible, and while the premise of a battle between vampires and werewolves would be very cool, you need to include some TEETH! It was as if the scriptwriters could not make up their minds whether to make anaction-shoot-em-up movie or a horror movie, and wound out with less than the sum of both.In particular is a scene when Selena (Kate Beckinsale) drives her car into the water with Michael (Scott Speedman). He &quot;rescues&quot; her after she hits her head on the windshield and gets knocked out, pulls her from thewater, gives her CPR, after which she coughs out a little water and comes to. HELLO! Vampires are dead. They are not alive. They don't breathe. They don't have heartbeats. They can't be knocked out, and they can't drown. And after all this, Selena tells Kraven &quot;He saved my life.&quot; Riiiiiiiight. What life? You're undead!Another problem with the vampires was that they seem to have forgotten they can change into bats and fly away. Instead, they just stand there and let the werewolves chew them.With the werewolves, only Michael changes with the full moon (of course) but the other werewolves are changing back and forth like a malfunctioning traffic light. The special effects were mediocre; the turning of the werewolves was really no better han &quot;American Werewolf In London&quot;, and all the fighting was so &quot;A-La-Matrix&quot; that for a moment I was confused as to which movie I was really watching.Okay, so what DID I like about the movie? The acting was actually verye good. Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, and especially Bill Nighy played their roles very well. The acting alone is the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. It is a visually stylish movie as far as dress and scenery. I liked the idea of vampires and werewolves descending from one anscestor. I thought that Viktor's tomb was very cool, and the visual effects of the awakening of Viktor were pretty slick. I am glad that I rented before buying on this one. It just got scratched off my purchase list.

785226,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B0000VAFNQ,Scott,"[9, 12]","I saw the previews for this film and it looked awesome. I couldn't wait to see it, but could never find anyone interested enough to go with me. I finally rented it and was fairly disappointed.The storyline sounds incredible. Werewolves (called ""Lycans"" in the film to make them sound cooler) vs Vampires? How much cooler can you get? Unfortunately, the coolness factor doesn't expand beyond the concept. Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires. Unfortunately, the only way you'd know this is by the occasional glimpse of teeth and shot of a full moon. They fight the entire movie with guns. I felt like I was watching a bad splice of The Matrix and Blade. What is the purpose of showing these two historical enemies fighting if they're going to be running behind each other with Uzis?Almost no typical vamp/wolf lore was explored. The ONLY thing the vampires do to show they're vampires if bare their fanged teeth and can jump from big heights. They don't shy away from the sun, turn into bats, suck blood, or anything else which makes vampires cool. The film even refers to them at one point as ""bats"" yet you never see it.Scott Speedman provides a forgettable performance for all of his 15-20 lines in the movie. The ending is VERY anticlimactic and is just a very watered down gun fight that would have been too boring to make it's way into The Matrix. I had to watch this film over 4 days because I kept falling asleep. What's more, the lycans looked absolutely ridiculous when they changed. The werewolves from ""The Howling"" 20 years ago had better make up.In regards to the DVD, I had a few problems with it.  The film is very dark, mostly shot at night, in tunnels, or in the rain.  The sound was also poorly reproduced on the DVD.  I was constantly having to change the volume.  I would raise it for speech, and as soon as the action started, the sound would jump and I would have to lower it.  I realize something blowing up should sound louder, but not this loud, and the differences shouldn't be so high where I have to keep my finger on the volume button the whole film.The extras on the DVD were fairly boring.  Some throwaways like trailers, teasers for other films, and a storyboard comparison, which no one ever cares about.  It also featured a montage of scenes from the movie set to music called ""Sights and Sounds.""  I don't know what this was or if it was supposed to be entertaining.The featurettes contain a fairly poor ""Making Of"" special, a commentary with the director, and a special on the visual effects.Overall, Underworld is a great concept, but the addition of guns and high tech weapons, as well as the idea to turn this into an action film instead of horror, ultimately cause it to fail.  The relationship between Beckinsale and Speedman is never explored beyond a single kiss, even though the film leads you to believe this is another ""Romeo and Juliet"" story...",2,Deceiving Trailer = Boring Film,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,2907,"['saw', 'previews', 'film', 'looked', 'awesome', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'anyone', 'interested', 'enough', 'go', 'finally', 'rented', 'was', 'fairly', 'disappointed.The', 'storyline', 'incredible', 'Werewolves', 'called', 'Lycans', 'film', 'make', 'sound', 'cooler', 'vs', 'Vampires', 'How', 'much', 'cooler', 'can', 'get', 'Unfortunately', 'coolness', 'factor', ""n't"", 'expand', 'concept', 'Yes', 'film', 'feature', 'Lycans', 'battling', 'Vampires', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'way', ""'d"", 'know', 'occasional', 'glimpse', 'teeth', 'shot', 'full', 'moon', 'fight', 'entire', 'movie', 'guns', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'bad', 'splice', 'Matrix', 'Blade', 'What', 'purpose', 'showing', 'two', 'historical', 'enemies', 'fighting', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'running', 'other', 'Uzis', 'Almost', 'typical', 'vamp/wolf', 'lore', 'was', 'explored', 'ONLY', 'thing', 'vampires', 'do', 'show', ""'re"", 'vampires', 'bare', 'fanged', 'teeth', 'can', 'jump', 'big', 'heights', 'do', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'sun', 'turn', 'bats', 'suck', 'blood', 'anything', 'else', 'vampires', 'cool', 'film', 'even', 'refers', 'one', 'point', 'bats', 'yet', 'never', 'see', 'it.Scott', 'Speedman', 'forgettable', 'performance', '15-20', 'lines', 'movie', 'ending', 'VERY', 'anticlimactic', 'just', 'very', 'watered', 'down', 'gun', 'fight', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'boring', 'make', 'way', 'Matrix', 'had', 'watch', 'film', '4', 'days', 'kept', 'falling', 'asleep', 'What', 'more', 'lycans', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'changed', 'werewolves', 'Howling', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'better', 'make', 'up.In', 'regards', 'DVD', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'mostly', 'shot', 'night', 'tunnels', 'rain', 'sound', 'was', 'also', 'poorly', 'reproduced', 'DVD', 'was', 'constantly', 'having', 'change', 'volume', 'would', 'raise', 'speech', 'as', 'soon', 'action', 'started', 'sound', 'would', 'jump', 'would', 'have', 'lower', 'realize', 'something', 'blowing', 'up', 'should', 'sound', 'louder', 'not', 'loud', 'differences', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'high', 'where', 'have', 'keep', 'finger', 'volume', 'whole', 'film.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'were', 'fairly', 'boring', 'throwaways', 'trailers', 'teasers', 'other', 'films', 'storyboard', 'comparison', 'one', 'ever', 'also', 'featured', 'montage', 'scenes', 'movie', 'set', 'music', 'called', 'Sights', 'Sounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'entertaining.The', 'featurettes', 'contain', 'fairly', 'poor', 'Making', 'special', 'commentary', 'director', 'special', 'visual', 'effects.Overall', 'Underworld', 'great', 'concept', 'addition', 'guns', 'high', 'tech', 'weapons', 'as', 'well', 'idea', 'turn', 'action', 'film', 'instead', 'horror', 'ultimately', 'cause', 'fail', 'relationship', 'Beckinsale', 'Speedman', 'never', 'explored', 'single', 'kiss', 'even', 'film', 'believe', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'story']",N/A
785227,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0000VAFNQ,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","I suppose the one-line review of Kate Beckinsale's pseudo-horror star vehicle, ""Underworld,"" would be, ""If you're going to see one movie this year about vampires fighting werewolves in a gothic metropolis, make it this one.""  Which could reasonably be interpreted as damning with faint praise.Len Wiseman's first directorial effort results in a visually polished, darkly handsome film.  Set in the present day in an anoymous gothic city, peopled with beautiful-yet-dangerous creatures of the night who live in fantastic mansions and drive hot Europena cars, ""Underworld"" offers plenty of visual thrills.  The aforementioned Beckinsale, clad in a uniform of black leather that makes Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman suit look bulky, stalks the night as Selene, the top Death Dealer for the vampires.  What does it say about the 2001 monstrosity ""Pearl Harbor"" that Beckinsale gives a more convincing performance as a vampire than she did as a WWII nurse?Using a host of flashbacks, examinations of powerfully-illustrated history texts, and voice-over exposition, the film tells us that the vampires have been at war with the werewolves, or ""Lycans,"" for centuries.  Apparently, the lycans used to be the vampires' servants, but then got uppity.  There's also a smidgen of a ""Romeo and Juliet"" romance that played a role, but that's not the focus of this story.  While the war is sometimes fought with fangs and claws, it's also fought with guns and high-tech ammunition.  They stop fighting long enough to mutter ominous portents about ""returns,"" and ""prophecies,"" and ""the war.""  Nobody is having much fun being a vampire or a werewolf.And that ultimately is what ""Underworld"" boils down to - not that much fun.  It looks great, but despite the special effects (which are very convincing), there's just not that much point to it all.  Allegedly, Selene has a ""romance"" with a human, Michael (Scott Speedman), who is fated to play an important role in the war.  And there's also Viktor, a ""hibernating"" elder vampire who gets brought back to life by Selene ""a century ahead of schedule.""  There are a few delicious moments as god-of-camp Bill Nighy (""Love Actually"") sinks his teeth into the Viktor role, but there could have been so much more here.While ostensibly a movie in the ""horror"" genre, it's really more of an action film.  There are no moments of genuine terror, and most of the potentially scary moments dissolve into hastily-cut action scenes.  This isn't a criticism, just an observation about a movie that was hyped (at least to me) as a horror film.There's a bit much going on with the names in ""Underworld.""

I was really into the movie up to the part where Celine (Kate Beckinsale) runs in to save Michael (Scott Speedman). At that point the movie adds extra twists which are totally unnecessary and becomes very confusing. Also, the story gets totally lost among the twists and becomes just a movie where two people are uselessly fighting. The character Craven just disappears even though he seemed like a rather important character. The werewolf leader, Lucien, just dies without any fight and the connection between him and Craven remains unexplored. To make things worse the movie just cuts off rather than concluding.

They've created a deep and dark universe where Vampires and Werewolves have been warring for centuries and filled it with interesting characters. The setting seems Londonish with hints of Eastern Europe with a dash of Blade Runner. There's lot of rain and underground tunnels to stalk through. And there are several corners for death to lurk around.The Vampires are decadent, the Werewolves gritty and their conflicts both high-tech and hard punching. Fight scenes are both stylized and horrific. Not a lot of gore but enough for me to give it 4 stars. It's not for everybody. But if you liked Blade, The Crow and the first two Alien movies, you'll probably like this one. Underworld has been compared to The Matrix and there are some things similar but not enough for it to seem derivative. It's possible to see several influences in Underworld but it has enough fresh material to be a very new on the Vampires vs Werewolves battles.I didn't realize this was a starting point for a trilogy but this movie works as either the first episode or as a stand-alone story. Underworld is the story of the Vampire Death Dealer Selene. Played wonderfully by Kate Beckinsale, Selene is driven, ruthless, tough and more vulnerable than she knows. This is her tale of self-awakening and a changing of the world for the Vampire and Werewolves Clans.Just about everything works in this movie. There's a good mix of background, lots of action, great characters and a premise that hangs together. The mythology is well described and seems to be thought out very well. Every character has an agenda and no one is to be trusted too much. It's definitely worth a look.

They don't have the superhuman powers normally posesses by vampires. They are strong, but where are the super senses? The stealth? In one scene one of the vampires stands in a beam of sunlight (?) and looks into a dark hole in the wall, unable to make out the werewolf hiding in the darkness. What's wrong with this picture? The beautifully sculpted Beckensale is hypnotic to watch in her skin-tight leather outfit. She does a good job acting the part and leading the film but she needs to play paintball a few times to learn how to move her hands like a real experienced gunfighter. The pistols she uses seem to have an unlimited suply of ammunition. They're fully automatic and can blast away for about a minute without a fresh magazine.

They could have just called it ""Vampires vs Werewolfs"", because essentially this just takes the idea from Aliens vs Predators and transposes it for use with two of the best known gothic horror icons.Where it lets itself down is the lack of character development. Yes it has plenty of action. You certainly won't be dissapointed on that front. After a while though you know when you see a lot of people walking purposefully, that they are going to end up in one hell of a fight with or without guns and it happens over and over.

The Vampires and Werewolves ""at each others necks"" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones, teaming up and feeding on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly.Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? And without the war there would have been no action-packed thriller about this war called Underworld.The effects are great in this flick. There's suspense. The DVD comes in a brilliant HD transfer with terrific 5.1 sound. What more could one ask for? How about a sequel/prequel?...Due out about a week from this writing....Hence, my decision to do this belated review.This DVD documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter marrying a Wolfman several centuries back. Flash back to the present and Kate Beckinsale is a death dealer/Vampire that hunts the last of the Lycan. Scott Speedman is a mortal (for now) that holds the key to end the war, and he takes some licks (and a couple bites...key words: a couple) protecting that key.All in all a very well done story that will likely spawn many more modern day Vampire versus Werewolf movies to come...like Van Helsing, and, oh, the sequel!...Underworld: Evolution!The sequel holds much promise actually. All of the key characters are back played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel (looks like kind of a prequel too).Underworld: Evolution apparently continues the story of the war between the Death Dealing Vampires and The Howling, and also traces the beginnings of the fight between the two mythical, legendary monsters. But that'll have to be another review entirely.So if you've not already, get Underworld into your collection, or at least view it before seeing the next installment.

I've read many reviews of this film, and most have butchered it saying that it is a ripoff action film of 'The Matrix' or 'Blade', and that its characters and plot are very weak. This is only partly true. If you watch the film with very high expectations, then yes, you may think of it that way. However, if you accept that it's a film from first-timers Len Wiseman and Danny McBride, and give it some leeway, it can be very entertaining. The one thing I must say is that this film isn't as much of an action film as the creators lead you to believe. Sure, there are action scenes, but they don't overshadow the plot. The action scenes work within the plot, instead of vice versa.The only notable performance is Kate Beckinsale's. She is excellent as the vampire Selene, and she looks really hot in the tight leather outfit. Other acting in the film is average.The action scenes in the film are amazing. The big shootouts come at the beginning and end of the film, but there are little action snipits throughout. The reason people have tagged this as a ripoff of 'The Matrix' is that the creators decided to use stop-motion camera styles in some areas. Slow-mo is used in some of the action scenes, and I have to say that it only makes them better.Bogged down by all its negative reviews, 'Underworld' has nevertheless become another one of my favorite films. The film really is very good, despite what many critics have said. The key to enjoying this movie is to not expect much from it.

This is not your typical vampire versus werewolves movie.  This movie has a lot of the action.  So if you are expecting a horror or science fiction film, then you may be disappointed.  If you enjoy a good action movie, with some awesome special effects, then this is the movie for you.Selene is a beautiful vampire who has a major dislike for the Lycans (the werewolves).  She spends a great deal of time tracking and killing them.  Selene hatred of the Lycans stems from the fact they are responsible for killing her family, or so she thinks.  After an intense gun battle, Selene is trying to figure out why the Lycans are after a human named Michael.  The werewolves it turns out, have discovered a way to turn the war in their favor, by finding a human named Michael Corbin ( Scott Speadman). Michael has the genes necessary to survive a bite from both a werewolf and a vampire, which would help to create a species that would be deadly to the vampires.  She tracks this Micheal, but not before he is bitten by a Lycon.  Now he will become a Lycon, but Selene is drawn to him, and feels she must help Michael.What I enjoyed about this movie is the use of the advanced technology used to during the fights.  They use high tech firearms, computers, and fancy cars.  The vampires even come up with a special bullet to kill the Lycans.  Kate Beckinsale is GREAT as Selene.  Even though he was a bad guy I was loving Raze.  What can I say?  I have a weakness for handsome black men with bald heads, and deep voices.One of my favorite scenes is of Selene jumping off the building.  The way she jumps, lands, and then starts to walk without missing a step is just phenomenal!!!  I watch that scene about a 100 times because it's so amazing to me.  I enjoyed the movies plot twist, the dark themes, the action, this is a very stylish film.  The werewolves transforming and the way they run along the walls talk about WOW!!!  This is another movie where you find yourself actually rooting for the vampire instead of hating them.This is an excellent movie, and the ending certainly left room for a sequel.  Every time I watch this movie, I discover something I missed during prior viewings.  After watching the film, you have to watch the extras.  Normally I don't pay too much attention to the extras, but for this movie I had to see Featurettes.

I was hesistant to see this in theatres mainly because of them and I am (in a way) angry I listened to them.  Namely because this film would have been so cool to see on the big screen.  Visually, it's a feast of inspiration and a story that is literally told from a visual standpoint as well as a literal standpoint.  Bearing in mind the director has taken an age old concept and shaken it up a bit.The premise is pretty simple, Vampires and Werewolves are at war with each other based on age old principles carried down from their ancestors.  One side believes one thing, the other side believes another.  All the while, they fight for something neither side really knows what or &quot;who&quot; they're fighting for.  This premise is sort of an analogy based upon our religious natures as humans.  For example, we have one side of humanity that says there is &quot;a god&quot; and one side that says there's just &quot;God,&quot; and the possiblity that neither side is right and that God simply is just folklore.  What we see in &quot;Underworld&quot; is a story of the persecution and the revelation of what real truth is.  The price you pay for that truth and possibilites of retribution.  Politics smear the facts, lies are told over centuries of war and doubt and Lycans are hunted, while Vampyre are thwarted.  Sounds familiar with what is going on our world I am afraid.  The problem is most people don't see things like that through a movie like this.  Most just see a movie like this as a simple action flick with really cool special effects.  This story is so much more than that.Keep in mind when watching this film that the story is simply not just about Vampyre and Lycans but an analogy of things to come in our own world.  Much of this story shows how truth is often betrayed and manipulated over the cost of stepping out of the boundaries to a brave new world.  If you go into this movie thinking the female vampire and the male lycan are &quot;in love&quot; or have a steamy romance, you're far from the mark of this movie.  Someone wrote once this movie was a modern day &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; told from a Vampire/Werewolf perspective-WRONG AGAIN!  This movie has none of that!  Watch this movie and just open your mind to something different and beautiful and read into it as much as you can.

785248,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0000VAFNQ,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 4]","""Underworld"" takes two staples of horror - the vampire and the werewolf - and matches them against each other in an action-movieesque power struggle, with a strong romantic element at its heart.  I'll admit that from the trailers I didn't know if this would work - the love angle sounded fine, but I thought if you're going to have a vampires vs. werewolves war, why give them so much heavy firepower that it's going to change it from a horror movie into a straight-out action movie?  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.  While the firepower and the swords do allow ""Underworld"" to function as a first-rate action film, they do not, in my opinion, hold the movie back from being a whale of a horror movie as well.  Of all the martial arts/swirling swords/blazing guns and black leather horror out there that have formed their own little genre (""Blade"" trilogy, ""The Crow"" movies, etc.), this and the ""Resident Evil"" movies sit atop the mountain.  ""Underworld"" far surpassed any expectations I had for it.A centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves (known as Lycans in the ""Underworld"" mythos) forms the scenario and the launching point, with the vampires currently in the winning position but with new developments in the wings for both clans that may shift the balance.  The lead vampire is Selene (the gorgeous and perfectly attired Kate Beckinsale), a ruthlessly efficient 'Death Dealer' (vampire assasin) out to avenge the deaths of her previous (human) family at the hands of rogue Lycans, and she's brought into contact with a mortal named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who may be the key to creating a perfect vampire/werewolf hybrid that would be more powerful or dangerous than either species.  The romantic story that slowly builds is never forthright but obvious nonetheless; it's 'felt' far more than 'seen' through the movie.  A labyrinth of power alliances and ancient secrets sets the balance of the war - and several of the cast of characters's places within it - spinning.The pantheons of werewolves and vampires remain credible horror creatures, their use of modern weaponry and martial arts fighting techniques (the latter mostly just for the vampires) serving not only to make the show more appealing for action fans but to differentiate the characters from those in previous great vampire and/or werewolf movies (""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the ""Ginger Snaps"" movies, the Hammer movies, ""Dracula's Curse"", etc.)  And ""Underworld"" and ""Blade"" and such are actually helping the whole genre by Not retreading the ground that's been done so effectively before (although occsionally a werewolf or vampire movie like the just-mentioned ""Dracula's Curse"" will come along and work the traditional territory and still be fresh and awesome) but by forging out new screen territory for these classic creatures to operate in.  Fellow horror fans will be happy to know that the action isn't confined to machine guns and swords - the Lycans are lethally effective in the fang-and-claw department, and both sides make use of more olden weapons (whips, cudgels, etc.), sometimes modified a bit for the creature's attributes.  I.E. a Lycan can wield a far bigger and heavier cudgel or mace far more effectively than even the strongest human ever could.  I'd like to see these weapons get more screentime in the sequel(s), just as I think it might not be a bad idea to take another classic race of monsters (maybe gargoyles or goblins?) and put a new spin on them.  To keep going and be just as great as the first one they're going to have to add in some new characters beyond Selene et al., and there's no reason not to go beyond the established races of vampire, werewolf, and human.Great characterization, impressive performances all around and high production values help ""Underworld"" live up to its full potential.  Horror fans, action fans (especially those inclined towards great, larger-than-life martial arts action), fantasy fans who don't mind their fiction dark and violent, and any fans of rip-roaring adventurous movies where the love angle isn't just a cool subplot but an essential focus, have Got to see this one, and especially to see this extended version.

To be fair, the lavish digital imagery suggested by the trailer is deployed with impressive restraint, and the film is distinguished from most other effects-intensive offerings by its determination to tell a story.  The problem is that the story it chooses to tell is convoluted, unmotivated and, in the end, not a particularly thrilling one.  What starts as a promising detective-tale-with-love-interest collapses under the weight of its own backstory and the apparent need to lay the ground work for a sequel. A tale of night-stalking monsters, blood disorders and forbidden love is surely ripe for a psycho-sexual subtext, but Danny McBride's screenplay seems content to make a few passing references to black slavery and leave it at that.  He was clearly more concerned with writing chase sequences involving a variety of expensive vehicles and cramming in enough ""acting"" roles for all his old stuntman buddies.  As director, Len Wiseman's adman pedigree is far too obvious.  He delivers one or two interesting shots, but generally relies on an aesthetic owing too much to rock videos, computer games and ""The Matrix"" ever to be truly engaging in its own right.  Still, the whole package shows enough promise to keep me interested in what these guys do next.

One of my friends said to me ""I wanted more 'Interview...' and this is totally unfair. The trailer told you what this film was about. It's about a war between vampires and Lycans (warewolves). It has guns, fighting and a love story subplot. It's Romeo & Juliet with fangs -- but it's great.Every vampire film slightly re-defines what the vampire is. Underworld has nice visual ideas and it is easy to find yourself taken in by this world. The characters take themselves seriously and the short dramatic scenes that are there are fine.

785258,A3OMPSEVL59ZDK,B0000VAFNQ,"Sylo ""Sylo""","[3, 7]","The Trailer was inspired, the posters were eye candy, the concept was brilliant. The only strike against it's add campaign was the horrific title the movie chose as its monicker. So where did this little-movie-that-could go wrong? Lets investigate shall we.Set Design: No problems from this angle. Besides being a bit cliched everything felt right at home.They were dark set pieces that helped set the mood for the battle of the century. Vampires Vs. Werewolves!! ""Only in America"".Cinematography: Everything is pretty much soaked in this blue-gray color. It has been done many times before. I wish that just one of these movies would just show some color, it's dark, I get it.Writing: Here, ladies and gentlemen, is the first strike. Many of the lines that these poor thespians must speak are, to say the least, atrocious. It was almost comedic how many cliched lines were just spewed forth. And their was no farce to support these lines, they are spoken with the most serious of tones it becomes almost like a running gag. Unfortunately this is not a comedy and the audience never ""gets"" the joke. Terrible job.Acting: Strike two! You must care for all of these characters for one reason and for one reason alone: they look really cool in black. Kate runs around emotionless and dull, motivated but strangely lifeless. The rest of this cast just follows the acting 101 lesson of basic emotions. ""Grrr I'm angry."" ""Sniffle I'm sad."" They breathe no life into any part of this sad sad production. Not one vampire ever acts like a vampire. Not one werewolf ever acts  like a werewolf. This shoulda been ""Humans in black leather Vs. Humans without shirts."" Much like the Matrix Reloaded we are merely  teased with the prospect of a true supernatural war of  fantasies most inventive creations.Direction: This movie had a director? Strike three. The plot goes into all the good cliches of having these creatures really interested in science and technology, yet never show some of the good old methods of killing. These scenes try to fill up the spaces between the times of talking and when things go boom. The action scenes never become exciting. While cloning the matrix it never tries to find its own voice, instead it becomes  the echo of the tried and true nature of todays action where wire-fu and guns equal big box office.  Even equilibrium created the ""gun-kata"" which made it very enjoyable to watch.I have no vendetta against movies that take inspiration from alot of todays most popular films.

Even as a kid, I had to wonder if vampires and the mythical werewolves ever had ... problems with each other.  It's an age old thing, really.  Vampires symbolize ageless, immortal power, sensuality, and dark gracefulness.  They are that element of human nature that is dark refinement, ageless refined, sexually eloquent power.  The werewolf is pure, insane, beastful rage released.  It is that element of human nature that symbolizes rage, brutality, enforcement - aggression and violence.  So it's very cool to have a movie playing off the symbolic equivalents of the differing psychologies of the audience members.  Some people in the audience for this movie are obviously vampiric, others show a wolfish element.It's a great ride, too, with very Matrix-esque action sequences that pull you along at great speed, catapulting you into this ""underground"" world.My one complaint was that the ""wolves"" are not very... well, wolfish.  They are more like deformed mutants, really!  I was very let down with that, since I was expecting a full, head on contest between real werewolves and vampires.  It's more akin to say that this movie is like the vampires versus the weird mutated humans who don't look wolfish at all.  The sad part is I've seen humans that DO look like wolves (A ""wolfish"" grin, etc.) so I think they could've done better.Still, it sure is fun, and a good action ride!

All this is quite interesting, as is the history of the war, and the way the vampires are ruled in shifts.

As expected, the movie ends with a perfect opening for a sequel, something that we have become really used to with action movies of late, because the producers are always looking for sequel opportunities and the extra money that comes along with that.The acting is good here, and Kate Beckinsdale is beautiful, but it is not enough to make you forget that there is something missing in this movie: wall to wall action and a couple of hours of entertainment.

Selene, a vampiress, is a member of the ""death dealers"" (trust me, after watching this celluloid fart, you'd wish you were dead) soldiers who fight the fight against the werewolves. She becomes intrigued & falls in love with a male human, when she comes across Michael, trying to aid one of the wounded werewolves. Unfortunately, Mikey gets bitten and its only a matter time before he has a serious pubic hair problem, at the light of the next full moon. If Selene bites Michael, there may be a cure but its in the form of eternal damnation as a vampire/werewolf half breed (maybe Harry Potter can help?).There's also a bunch of pointless plot-cockblocking about the sqwabbling between both families. The atmosphere to the film is set in modernday but comes across as if its in late thirties Germany (at one point, I was waiting for Mike Meyers' ""Saturday Night Live"" character Dieter to show up. ""Touch my monkey!""). The characters aren't very interesting, and most of them are in a tense bitchy mood thru out the course of the film. Kate Beckinsale tries to hard to be the hero and is more annoying than the rest of the cast (I hated her ""I'm doing the right thing"" type of attitude). She does look hot in the circulation stopping, skin tight leather outfit she wears. Thats pretty much how I got thru this movie. What really sucks about ""Underworld"" is ""The Matrix"" inspired crap that unveils thruout the film (including the ten story drop to the ground Beckinsale does at the beginning of the film. When I saw that I knew I was in trouble). The film did enough money at the box-office to make a sequel, but if you see ""Underworld"" you would wish it was the end of the world.

Seriously, I've seen better acting in porn. Shane, my good man, I sincerely hope your poetry is better than your acting. Really, I mean that.As for the rest of the film-it's excellent.

If you're a regular person (meaning not an indie film twit) who enjoys a good horror / gothic / action flick, this is the best one of the year. The costumes are incredible, Kate Beckinsdale is delicious-looking, the stage armory is flawless (except for the endless-firing-without-reloading thing, but I can forgive one friggin' oversight), the gothy cinematography is superb even if it does resemble a cologne commercial at times, and I absolutely love how they managed to give the city in this film that whole ""generic dark gothic city in Europe"" feel. It works and works well. And the mansion the vampires are living in.... I have a thing for gothic mansions, and that's one of the best ones I've ever seen in a movie.I love this film despite the could-be-better acting.

Unfortunately, the film's first reel contains the best footage (which was mined thoroughly for the trailer), and the final hour and a half lead the viewer through a somewhat convoluted history of the blood feud between the vampire clan and the lycans.  The filmmakers clearly had a vision here, but they waited too long to introduce the exposition as to why the feud exists in the first place, and by the time they did, I had largely lost interest.  At one point, I looked at the counter on my DVD player and realized that, after 45 minutes, I still did not have a clear idea of what motivated these two supernatural clans to go after each other.  At that point, I began to question my own motivation for watching the film...Unlike other movies in the vampire tradition where vampires are being hunted for the sake of human survival (e.g., Blade), we do not learn until much later in the film why it is that these two groups hate each other so much.  Sadly, by the time we find out, we don't really care.The only redemption for this movie is that Kate Beckinsale is stunning as the vampire death-dealer Selene.

I myself found the film to be better than I expected.  UNDERWORLD is an extraodinary BLADE-esque horror/thriller with similarities to both BLADE and THE MATRIX.  Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire ""Death Dealer"".  Her job is to eleminate any and all Lycans (werewolves), who have been at war with the vampires for a millenia.  But her determination wavers when she meets a newly-made Lycan (Scott Speedman) who has been unsuspectingly drawn into this ages-old battle.  Things aren't as they seem, or so Selene soon discovers; and thus begins one of the greatest battles of all history.  UNDERWORLD belongs in the rows of horror wonders.  It is outstanding.  The direction is terrific and occasionally artful; the soundtrack is good; the acting is great; and the effects are terrific.  The story is also an awesome idea and is brought out well.  There's also a very cool Lycan transformation scene reminiscent of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  The only way to know how good the film is is to watch it.

Except for them, you get nothing particularly special about it -- the actions are not new, the acting is not good, and most of all the story is very slow-moving and uninvolving.""Underworld"" is, some say, the Romeo and Juliet story in vimpire/werewolf version.  This account is quite misleading.  It is about Ms Beckinsale's Selene, deadly assassin with guns among the vampire clan.  They are fighting the bloody war so long with the now-outnumbered werewolves (Lycans, they are called), so no one remembers the original cause of the war.  So, Selene is told to kill, and she kills.  So far so good.And the opening subway gun-shooting scenes are reasonably done.  And Scott Speedman's doctor named Michael enters as the possible target of the Lycans.  Selene only seems aware of the fact that Michael has some secret he doesn't know, but the leader of the Lycans (Michael Sheen) is desperately after.  Now the plot is going to thicken.But it doesn't.  Soon we get confused because of the very clumsy storytelling, i.e. talk, talk, talk, which includes many monologues, intricate relations of characters, and some ritualsa and traditions about the dynasty of old, sleeping vampires.  Some are intrigued by these webs of facts, but I must say ... Isn't this supposed to be Romeo and Juliet?The director Len Wiseman unaccountably doesn't show any interest in the relations between Beckinsale and Speedman.  This misguided choice kills any potential power they might have been given; instead, we start to lose interest in them.  How should we care these uninteresting characters?If you have seen ""Blade"" ""Blade 2"" or the first ""Crow"", don't expect the actions, which lack originality.  Not that they are bad -- far from it.  But the fact remains that we have seen more exciting and unique ones in them, and to make matters worse, for all the inclusion of creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, the werewolves are not convincing.We got good production designs including the cobbled streets of Budapest; we got credible and often very sinister atomospher.  Still we need more power, or elegance, or humor, or anything here, which might heighten the tension between the two clans.  We need danger, and only in danger Beckinsale's death dealer starts to shine.",3,"Reasonable Vampre/Werewolf Flick, but Lacks Originality",1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,2347,"['Underworld', 'two', 'great', 'things', 'beautiful', 'images', 'elegant', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Period', 'get', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'acting', 'not', 'good', 'most', 'story', 'very', 'slow-moving', 'uninvolving', 'Underworld', 'say', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'story', 'vimpire/werewolf', 'version', 'account', 'quite', 'misleading', 'Ms', 'Beckinsale', 'Selene', 'deadly', 'guns', 'vampire', 'clan', 'are', 'fighting', 'bloody', 'war', 'so', 'long', 'now-outnumbered', 'werewolves', 'Lycans', 'are', 'called', 'so', 'one', 'original', 'cause', 'war', 'So', 'Selene', 'told', 'kill', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good.And', 'opening', 'subway', 'gun-shooting', 'scenes', 'are', 'reasonably', 'done', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'doctor', 'named', 'Michael', 'enters', 'possible', 'target', 'Lycans', 'Selene', 'only', 'aware', 'fact', 'Michael', 'secret', ""n't"", 'know', 'leader', 'Lycans', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'desperately', 'Now', 'plot', 'going', 'thicken.But', ""n't"", 'Soon', 'get', 'confused', 'very', 'clumsy', 'storytelling', 'i.e', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'many', 'monologues', 'intricate', 'relations', 'characters', 'ritualsa', 'traditions', 'dynasty', 'old', 'sleeping', 'vampires', 'are', 'intrigued', 'webs', 'facts', 'must', 'say', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'unaccountably', ""n't"", 'show', 'interest', 'relations', 'Beckinsale', 'Speedman', 'misguided', 'choice', 'kills', 'potential', 'power', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'instead', 'start', 'lose', 'interest', 'How', 'should', 'care', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'Blade', 'Blade', '2', 'first', 'Crow', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'actions', 'lack', 'originality', 'Not', 'are', 'bad', 'far', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'exciting', 'unique', 'ones', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'inclusion', 'creature', 'designer', 'Patrick', 'Tatopoulos', 'werewolves', 'are', 'not', 'convincing.We', 'got', 'good', 'production', 'designs', 'including', 'cobbled', 'streets', 'Budapest', 'got', 'credible', 'often', 'very', 'sinister', 'atomospher', 'Still', 'need', 'more', 'power', 'elegance', 'humor', 'anything', 'here', 'might', 'heighten', 'tension', 'two', 'clans', 'need', 'danger', 'only', 'danger', 'Beckinsale', 'death', 'dealer', 'shine']",N/A

I had read so many negative reviews and heard so many people say that it was a rip-off of ROMEO AND JULIET, that I just wasn't expecting much. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when the final credits started to roll and I was left sitting in my seat thinking, &#34;What? It's over already?&#34;As many have already stated, the film is about a vampire death-slayer (vampires who hunt wearwolves) who falls in love with a human who has been bitten by her most hated enemy, the werewolf overlord who was supposed to have been killed centuries before. The film starts off somewhat slow then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down, then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down. The entire movie is paced this way. Some find it irritating. However, I felt that it added to the mood of the movie, the pace of the film accompanying the transformations that the characters undergo both physically and psychologically.The lighting and costumes seemed to fit the dark underworld that is the setting for most of the film. The only time the tones lightened up were in flashbacks to centuries before when the wearwolves and vampires weren't at war, suggesting a more pleasant era.The characters in the movie aren't allowed to develop much, except through narrative. However, I didn't find that this took anything away from the movie.Much like all franchises (as UNDERWORLD is sure to become), this film sets up everything that is to come in the next. This isn't a thinking person's movie nor is it a full blown action piece; in the style and tone the movie has more of a literary feel than anything else. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough conflict between the wearwolves and the vampires; so much time is spent on setting the tone, mood, and narrative that there wasn't much time left for action. Nevertheless, I still found that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.",4,Better Than Expected,1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,2001,"['watching', 'UNDERWORLD', 'first', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'had', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'say', 'was', 'rip-off', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Therefore', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'final', 'credits', 'started', 'roll', 'was', 'left', 'sitting', 'seat', 'thinking', '34', 'What', 'over', 'already', '34', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'film', 'vampire', 'death-slayer', 'vampires', 'who', 'hunt', 'wearwolves', 'who', 'love', 'human', 'who', 'been', 'bitten', 'most', 'hated', 'enemy', 'werewolf', 'overlord', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'centuries', 'film', 'off', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'then', 'fighting', 'frenzy', 'then', 'down', 'then', 'fighting', 'frenzy', 'then', 'down', 'entire', 'movie', 'paced', 'way', 'find', 'irritating', 'However', 'felt', 'added', 'mood', 'movie', 'pace', 'film', 'accompanying', 'transformations', 'characters', 'undergo', 'physically', 'psychologically.The', 'lighting', 'costumes', 'seemed', 'fit', 'dark', 'underworld', 'setting', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'time', 'tones', 'lightened', 'up', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'centuries', 'when', 'wearwolves', 'vampires', 'were', ""n't"", 'war', 'suggesting', 'more', 'pleasant', 'era.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'develop', 'much', 'narrative', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'took', 'anything', 'away', 'movie.Much', 'franchises', 'UNDERWORLD', 'sure', 'become', 'film', 'up', 'everything', 'come', 'next', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'person', 'movie', 'full', 'blown', 'action', 'piece', 'style', 'tone', 'movie', 'more', 'literary', 'feel', 'anything', 'else', 'My', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'conflict', 'wearwolves', 'vampires', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'setting', 'tone', 'mood', 'narrative', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'time', 'left', 'action', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'found', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again']",N/A

785287,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B0000VAFNQ,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[3, 5]","Synthesize elements from famous film franchises like ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade"" to forge a bullet-riddled, revisionist vampires-vs.-werewolves urban war epic, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect from the exciting, new, fantasy chiller ""Underworld"" (*** out of *****) starring ""Pearl Harbor"" beauty Kate Beckinsale. This supercharged but synthetic British horror thriller with R-rated heaps of blood & gore and a touch of Shakespeare plays fast and loose with vampire lore. Not only do the vamps refrain from shape shifting into bats, but also these pale-faced bloodsuckers can stare at their reflections in the mirror! Were that not enough these fangsters don't have to shack up for the day in their caskets. On the other hand, rookie director Len Wiseman and stuntman-turned-scenarist Danny McBride adhere to the lycanthrope legend with no radical departures.Action-packed from the outset, this darkly-lensed, tragic melodrama laid in a rain swept contemporary setting provides enough different things along the way with a couple of major plot revelations to boost ""Underworld"" above its formulaic origins. For example, the vampires load their automatic weapons with silver nitrate slugs, while the werewolves pack cartridges filled with ultra-violet light to literally let daylight through their sworn enemies. The special effects sequences that depict the transformation from man into werewolf look super cool, and the sight of these scary creatures hauling butt on the walls in pursuit of their prey make for vivid, memorable images. One especially clever scene shows a werewolf as he uses his bodily powers to pop the bullets out of his wounds!Although it runs a little over two hours, ""Underworld"" maintains enough momentum in its melodramatic narrative and features strong enough villains that it entertains you without giving you nightmares. Surprisingly, though it looks like it should have descended from a graphic novel, ""Underworld"" boasts no previous source material aside from an original story penned by black stuntman-turned-actor Kevin Grevioux, former ""Stargate"" art director Wiseman, and McBride himself. When the bullets aren't thudding noisily in your ears, ""Underworld"" features a deafening, industrial-strength, orchestral soundtrack written by ex-Tangerine Dreamer Paul Haslinger with songs written by David Bowie and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciate. Get ready to rock out!Kate Beckinsale plays a super-sexy leather-clad vampire warrior named Selene who cannot kill enough werewolves to satisfy her thirst for vengeance. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a no-holds-barred civil war for centuries, and the vampires finally appear to have gotten the upper hand over the Lycans. According to Selene, these hideous Lycans wiped out her entire family and would have killed her too had it not been for vampire elder Viktor (Bill Nighy of ""Hitler's S.S.: Portrait in Evil"") who saved her life and turned her into a vampire. Meanwhile, as Viktor rests in his tomb, his hand-picked prot&eacute;g&eacute; Craven (Shane Brolly of ""Impostor"") appears to have turned traitor to his own kind. Secretly, Kraven has been negotiating a truce behind the scenes with the Lycans who are trying to develop a serum which will enable Lycans and vampires to mate.Naturally, when Selene awakens Viktor and reveals Kraven's insidious plot, all hell breaks loose. Furthermore, it doesn't help matters that the apparently whipped Lycans are far from whipped as Selene learns in an opening shoot-out in a subway tunnel. No, human society doesn't know about the millennium war happening right under their noses, because the vampires and werewolves conceal themselves so well. In fact, the vampires maintain their own blood bank, so they don't have to bleed humans dry. Once a rebellious Selene resurrects Viktor to punish the treacherous Kraven, the action really slams into high gear.Despite Kraven's assurances to the contrary that the werewolves have been eliminated as a threat, Selene sets out to convince Viktor that the werewolves are staging a comeback. Nothing can stop our hardnosed heroine from proving her point, even if she must turn against her own breed. Apparently, the Lycans have found a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman of ""Duets"") who can assimilate both vampire and werewolf DNA so as to reproduce. Complications arise when Michael saves Selene's life, and she finds herself attracted to him. In ""Underworld,""Director Len Wiseman, who served as art director not only on the theatrical ""Stargate"" but also ""Independence Day,"" makes the most of his threadbare $20-million production so that ""Underworld"" can compete with the films that inspired it. Set amid gloomy, Gothic castles where the elitist vampires huddle in their fight against evil, ""Underworld"" stresses adrenaline-laced action with just enough time out for the exposition to keep audiences on track about who's who. While the characters aren't as substantial as they could be, each shows a different side as the plot approaches its climax. Selene changes from a mindless werewolf killer from the get-go when she learns the truth about her family and the heroic vampire who saved her from sure death. Tucked away in the flashbacks is another story that revolves around the villainous Viktor that explains his hatred of all things Lycan.Surprisingly, for a British-produced movie, ""Underworld"" ignores sex, nudity, and romance in favor of bloodletting and mutilation. Although it cannot compare with ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld""manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production. The fact that the Brits were able to produce their own variation on these popular, special effects laden spectacles is reason enough to watch it. Unfortunately, like the vampires here who refuse to countenance interspecies breeding, nearly 90 per cent of American film critics have staked out this well-made thriller because they feel it offers nothing new and lacks the polished production values of those other film franchises. Truth is that getting a large scale action film like ""Underworld"" made in England by Englishmen amounts to something like a miracle.While it doesn't look as polished as ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld"" still ranks a good horror thriller that you can sink your teeth into and enjoy for its vitality.",4,"""Underworld"" Theatrical Review",1227657600,"11 26,

785288,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B0000VAFNQ,V. Berk,"[1, 2]","Underworld is a film that continues to water down vampires as most of us know them.  This process began with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, but these stories still retained the horrific true nature of vampires even with a more relatable, human face.  Now we come to this day where between Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which I did enjoy) and Twilight (hate with burning passion) we have films in the middle of this watered down vampire genre that many have grown used to.  There's the good humanized vampires (Anne Rice), the bad (Twilight), and then there's the ones that just fall right dab in the middle and that would be where I'd place Underworld.The movie itself starts off with our heroine Selene doing her best to try and look like The Crow or an extra from The Matrix while she gives us a monologue on how the vampires and werewolves (which for some reason this movie has titled ""Lycans"").  She explains that she's a ""Death Dealer"" meaning that she hunts down the remaining Lycans.  Instantly we have her and another guy (we'll guess that in their exchange of head nodding he's also a Death Dealer) jumping down from the top of buildings and landing without harm on the concrete below...how convenient it is that no one saw them.We then somehow get this character of Michael Corvin involved as some...truly boring individual.  So when the vampires discover the Lycans have been following him so they soon send Selene to investigate it.  Selene and Corvin of course end up being together and escape the Lycans.  Does this mean we finally get a Vampire+Human buddy action film?  Of course not!  As awesome as that could have been Corvin has been bitten by a Lycan and monster 101 dictates he shall soon become one.  Now we realize the true plot intent of this movie is to be some strange, leather clad Romeo & Juliet.The rest of the plot...quite frankly bored me to tears.  Nothing in this movie ever paused itself to try and make sense!  They kept twisting subjects around and around, showed weird aspects of vampire society that may seem cool to eyes but they never really got any elaboration other than ""here's this cool thing, now let's try for something completely different.""  It just wasn't a coherent storyline.Vampirism just isn't shown well in this movie.  Remember the days of Dracula, or even the adaptation of Interview with the Vampire some years back?  That should remind you vampires, and their bite are more sexual than anything else.  In Underworld there is zero sensuality in this act and it pretty much is only shown for the blood.Kate Beckinsale is really attractive, but looks just can't save this film.  There is no chemistry between the leads and most of the cast seems bored.  No one really gets my attention in this film because they are all so very bland.  When the plot gets chugging along it has far too many characters to keep track of and when we finally discover the true villain of the film we are greeted to the most anti-climactic final confrontation I have seen in recent cinema.Now I will grant it the film does have some really good sets that obviously had quality work put into them, but that can't save the fact that the plot is a mess and the characters are unremarkable.  The director is essentially trying to knock-off Blade, The Matrix, and The Crow off all while in the same movie and it clearly shows in his awkward style as he tries desperately to replicate techniques that worked well in previous films of the genre.  So if you want a somewhat fun action movie this show is for you, but don't be expecting anything new, or for that matter even anything all that entertaining.",2,Surprisingly dull and unoriginal,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,3627,"['Underworld', 'film', 'water', 'down', 'vampires', 'most', 'know', 'process', 'began', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'stories', 'still', 'retained', 'horrific', 'true', 'nature', 'vampires', 'even', 'more', 'relatable', 'human', 'face', 'Now', 'come', 'day', 'where', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Twilight', 'hate', 'burning', 'passion', 'have', 'films', 'middle', 'watered', 'down', 'vampire', 'genre', 'many', 'have', 'grown', 'used', 'good', 'humanized', 'vampires', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'bad', 'Twilight', 'then', 'ones', 'just', 'fall', 'right', 'dab', 'middle', 'would', 'be', 'where', ""'d"", 'place', 'Underworld.The', 'movie', 'heroine', 'Selene', 'doing', 'best', 'try', 'look', 'Crow', 'extra', 'Matrix', 'monologue', 'how', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'reason', 'movie', 'titled', 'Lycans', 'Death', 'Dealer', 'meaning', 'remaining', 'Lycans', 'Instantly', 'have', 'guy', ""'ll"", 'guess', 'exchange', 'head', 'nodding', 'also', 'Death', 'Dealer', 'jumping', 'down', 'top', 'buildings', 'landing', 'harm', 'concrete', 'how', 'convenient', 'one', 'saw', 'them.We', 'then', 'somehow', 'get', 'character', 'Michael', 'Corvin', 'involved', 'truly', 'boring', 'individual', 'So', 'when', 'vampires', 'discover', 'Lycans', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'so', 'soon', 'send', 'Selene', 'investigate', 'Selene', 'Corvin', 'course', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'together', 'escape', 'Lycans', 'mean', 'finally', 'get', 'Vampire+Human', 'buddy', 'action', 'film', 'course', 'not', 'As', 'awesome', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Corvin', 'been', 'bitten', 'Lycan', '101', 'dictates', 'shall', 'soon', 'become', 'one', 'Now', 'realize', 'true', 'plot', 'intent', 'movie', 'be', 'strange', 'leather', 'clad', 'Romeo', 'Juliet.The', 'rest', 'plot', 'quite', 'frankly', 'bored', 'tears', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'ever', 'paused', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'kept', 'twisting', 'subjects', 'showed', 'weird', 'aspects', 'vampire', 'society', 'may', 'seem', 'cool', 'eyes', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'elaboration', 'other', 'here', 'cool', 'thing', 'now', 'let', 'try', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'coherent', 'storyline.Vampirism', 'just', ""n't"", 'shown', 'well', 'movie', 'Remember', 'days', 'Dracula', 'even', 'adaptation', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'years', 'back', 'should', 'remind', 'vampires', 'bite', 'are', 'more', 'sexual', 'anything', 'else', 'Underworld', 'zero', 'sensuality', 'act', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'shown', 'blood.Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'really', 'attractive', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'most', 'cast', 'bored', 'one', 'really', 'attention', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'bland', 'When', 'plot', 'chugging', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'keep', 'track', 'when', 'finally', 'discover', 'true', 'villain', 'film', 'are', 'greeted', 'most', 'anti-climactic', 'final', 'confrontation', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'cinema.Now', 'will', 'grant', 'film', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'sets', 'obviously', 'had', 'quality', 'work', 'put', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'fact', 'plot', 'mess', 'characters', 'are', 'unremarkable', 'director', 'essentially', 'trying', 'knock-off', 'Blade', 'Matrix', 'Crow', 'while', 'same', 'movie', 'clearly', 'awkward', 'style', 'desperately', 'replicate', 'techniques', 'worked', 'well', 'previous', 'films', 'genre', 'So', 'want', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'action', 'movie', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'anything', 'new', 'matter', 'even', 'anything', 'entertaining']",N/A

In fact, I read plenty of professional reviews trashing this film prior to seeing it.  I was just looking forward to a fun movie to forget about the stresses of life for about 2 hours.  And to that effect, ""Underworld"" succeeds extraordinarily.  It's true that oscar material it ain't, but damn was it entertaining.  Underworld is the quintessential ""guilty pleasure"" movie.  I walked out of the theatre with a big smile and feeling not a little guilty for being so entertained by such a ""stupid"" movie.Regardless, Underworld sports some of the most stylish cinematography I have ever seen in any movie.  Every action and backdrop is meticulously crafted for maximum suaveness.  The film depicts an alternate, dark world just slightly out of kilter with ours, so that we get to see something different from everyday life without the ""world"" being too farfetched.  The action sequences are all taut and well done.The movie provides some good new ideas for the vampire and werewolf mythologies.  I especially loved the idea of vampires using laptops, cell phones, and automatic weapons to keep up wtih times.  I mean, we would expect them to, no?  Unfortunately, some old favourites of vampire lore were not presented in the film.  Apparently vampires have reflections in mirrors, and breathe according to this movie.  And not enough emphasis was put on the blood-drinking nature of vampires in general, which was so central to films like ""Interview with the Vampire"" (the greatest vampire flick of all time).The werewolf effects were not spectacular, but they were sufficient.  The director had to good sense of relegating our canine friends mostly to the dark, knowing that in full light, CGI characters look absurdly fake.Yes, I went to see Underworld primarily for Kate Beckinsale, and I was not disappointed.  She was hella, hella hot in this movie.  Well, she's just beautfiul in general, but there's something about the blue vampire-eyes and ultra-chic costumes that makes her a delight to watch.  This is certainly a whole other side to Kate compared with Serendipity.  She makes a very satisfying action hero.  I think Kate Beckinsale's Selene is the first of those independent female ""girl-power"" action heros that I actually like.  I'll take her over any of those Charlie's Angels any day, that's for sure.Plot holes?  Yes, Underworld is overflowing with them.  But who cares?  The plot is indeed woefully convoluted, but includes many clever twists to keep the audience guessing and amused.

785292,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000VAFNQ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[14, 21]","You're probably thinking, ""how does he get ""Romeo & Juliet""? This tale of cross species lovers has elements that borrow from Shakesphere. The themes are so universal that they could also apply to the prejudice that whites and blacks (or Asians)might face if they intermarried during the Civil War or anytime before the Civil Rights Movement. The first time I saw it I really, really disliked it. Why? It seemed as if it was too deriative. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say. When I went back to watch it again with a a friend I really enjoyed ""Underworld"" for what it is.Selene (Kate Beckindale)is a Deathdealer--her job is to hunt down and kill Lycans (Werewolves). It seems the two species have been at war for thousands of years. At one time the Lycans were slaves watching over their masters the Vampires while they slept and protecting them in times of turmoil. That changed due to some pivotal event in the past.Things change when Selene while on a hunt for two Lycans discovers they were hunting a mortal (Scott Speedman). They weren't doing it for food or sport. Instead Lucian (Michael Sheen)has some special purpose for this human. When Selene begins to suspect that Kraven (Shane Brolly)who leads the vampires might have betrayed her kind, she takes it upon herself to discover who this human is and what his importance might be to the Lycans.Stylish and well directed by Len Wiseman from a story conceived by Wiseman (a former art director on ""Stargate SG1"", writer Danny McBride (""The Outer Limits"" and a stunt co-ordinator/actor on many film projects) andactor/stuntman Kevin Grevioux (who also appears in the film as a Lycan), ""Underworld"" may borrow its look from ""The Matrix"" but the themes in the story are as old as the Greek tragedies. Is it a deep film? Hardly. Combining the story, stunts and a sharp visual sense makes ""Underworld"" more than the sum of its influences.This deluxe set includes the unrated extended cut of the film. What that amounts to a new subplot involving the vampire Erika (Sophia Myles), back story information on Scott Speedman's character Michael and an extended grand finale involving the fight between the werewolves and the vampires. Featuring a new commentary track with stars Beckinsale, Speedman and director Wiseman, this edition is closer in final form to the film Wiseman wanted released. It had to be recut for reasons of pacing and theatrical exhibition. In addition to the original featurettes on the single disc DVD, we also get a 50 minute documentary ""Fang vs. Fiction"" discussing the history and lore of vampires and werewolves. There's also outtakes and some additional featurettes on the making of the film.The transfer of the Extended Edition looks marvelous. Once again, it appears to be a high definition transfer and, while there's is occasional edge enhancement and halos, the overall look of the film is terrific. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound will give your speakers a work out as well. I prefer the two commentary tracks on the original DVD with the theatrical cut but the commentary track here along with the additional footage which adds more to the plot, documentary and featurettes makes ""Underworld The Extended Edition"" a must for fans of the film. While the look of the film borrowed quite a bit from ""The Matrix"" (which, in turn, borrowed from ""Dark City""), Wiseman manages to make the overall look integral to this film. Overall, ""Underworld"" is quite an achievement for a first feature film. Evidently in November of this year Wiseman, Beckinsale and McBride will begin work on the first sequel for Screen Gems for a release set for mid-2005.",4,"Interesting variation on ""Romeo & Juliet""",1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,3628,"[""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', 'how', 'get', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'tale', 'cross', 'species', 'lovers', 'elements', 'borrow', 'Shakesphere', 'themes', 'are', 'so', 'universal', 'could', 'also', 'apply', 'prejudice', 'blacks', 'Asians', 'might', 'face', 'intermarried', 'Civil', 'War', 'anytime', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'really', 'really', 'disliked', 'Why', 'seemed', 'was', 'too', 'deriative', 'Hindsight', '20/20', 'say', 'When', 'went', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'friend', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Underworld', 'what', 'is.Selene', 'Kate', 'Beckindale', 'Deathdealer', 'job', 'hunt', 'down', 'kill', 'Lycans', 'Werewolves', 'two', 'species', 'have', 'been', 'war', 'thousands', 'years', 'one', 'time', 'Lycans', 'were', 'slaves', 'watching', 'masters', 'Vampires', 'slept', 'protecting', 'times', 'turmoil', 'changed', 'due', 'pivotal', 'event', 'past.Things', 'change', 'when', 'Selene', 'hunt', 'two', 'Lycans', 'discovers', 'were', 'hunting', 'mortal', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'were', ""n't"", 'doing', 'food', 'sport', 'Instead', 'Lucian', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'special', 'purpose', 'human', 'When', 'Selene', 'suspect', 'Kraven', 'Shane', 'Brolly', 'who', 'vampires', 'might', 'have', 'betrayed', 'kind', 'discover', 'who', 'human', 'what', 'importance', 'might', 'be', 'Lycans.Stylish', 'well', 'directed', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'story', 'conceived', 'Wiseman', 'former', 'art', 'director', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'writer', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'stunt', 'co-ordinator/actor', 'many', 'film', 'projects', 'andactor/stuntman', 'Kevin', 'Grevioux', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'Lycan', 'Underworld', 'may', 'borrow', 'look', 'Matrix', 'themes', 'story', 'are', 'as', 'old', 'Greek', 'tragedies', 'deep', 'film', 'Hardly', 'Combining', 'story', 'stunts', 'sharp', 'visual', 'sense', 'Underworld', 'more', 'sum', 'influences.This', 'deluxe', 'set', 'unrated', 'extended', 'cut', 'film', 'What', 'new', 'subplot', 'involving', 'vampire', 'Erika', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'back', 'story', 'information', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'character', 'Michael', 'extended', 'grand', 'finale', 'involving', 'fight', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'Featuring', 'new', 'commentary', 'track', 'stars', 'Beckinsale', 'Speedman', 'director', 'Wiseman', 'edition', 'closer', 'final', 'form', 'film', 'Wiseman', 'wanted', 'released', 'had', 'be', 'recut', 'reasons', 'pacing', 'theatrical', 'exhibition', 'addition', 'original', 'featurettes', 'single', 'disc', 'DVD', 'also', 'get', '50', 'minute', 'documentary', 'Fang', 'vs.', 'Fiction', 'discussing', 'history', 'lore', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'also', 'outtakes', 'additional', 'featurettes', 'making', 'film.The', 'transfer', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'marvelous', 'Once', 'again', 'be', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'occasional', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'halos', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'terrific', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'will', 'give', 'speakers', 'work', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'prefer', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'original', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'commentary', 'track', 'here', 'along', 'additional', 'footage', 'more', 'plot', 'documentary', 'Underworld', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'must', 'fans', 'film', 'look', 'film', 'borrowed', 'quite', 'bit', 'Matrix', 'turn', 'borrowed', 'Dark', 'City', 'Wiseman', 'make', 'overall', 'look', 'integral', 'film', 'Overall', 'Underworld', 'quite', 'achievement', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Evidently', 'November', 'year', 'Wiseman', 'Beckinsale', 'McBride', 'will', 'begin', 'work', 'first', 'sequel', 'Screen', 'Gems', 'release', 'set', 'mid-2005']",N/A

One of the great things about Underworld is that it takes  Vampire and Werewolf lore and fleshes it out, avoiding tired cliches, leaving us with a very fresh story.One could call this movie an action movie, but even though there is quite a bit of good action, it is at its heart a great story. There are unexpected twists and turns, and the writers go out of their way to avoid many of the pitfalls of using tired Hollywood cliches. For example, there is an attraction between a Vampire character and a Werewolf, but it never deteriorates into cheesiness. We are left wondering what happens after the movie ends as opposed to being tortured with loves scenes that would have been out of place in a flick such as this.Those who don't have much of a taste for action movies and monsters might hate Underworld, and those who think Anne Rice's universe is the only one that matters might hate it as well (because it breaks tired vampire cliches), but those looking for a fresh monster story will love it. If you liked Van Helsing, this movie is right up your alley.Understand that Underworld is not perfect, but it entertains. The story does drag at times when the action sequences seem to go on forever. The fight scenes start to blur into one big fight. But I was left wanting more. The worldbuilding was great. Anytime I walk away from a movie wanting to know more about the world, I give kudos to the writers. Underworld did this for me.A side note: some compare this to the Matrix? Other than a few minor fight scenes where the action flipping is similiar, this comparison is unfounded and unfair to both films. Underworld never comes off as trying to be Matrix-y. It is a modern action trend to have Matrix-like fighting scenes, but a good thing about Underworld is that they did not turn every fight scene into a fight scene from the Matrix. The use of modern fight cliches was limited.Underworld is worth seeing, and those who love it and get it will really love it. Those who want cliches or the Matrix part 4 will hate it.Total Score (out of 100) = 6527 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.7 (out of 10). Acting.

Instead I got a movie with very good action scenes but, more importantly, a very interesting plot.  In fact, much of the plot is an appropriation of Romeo and Juliet- down to the complexity with which the two families are characterized (more so on the vampire side).  At the same time, Underworld seems to be the first to effectively bring to screen the image of the Neo-vampire.  We see vampires that have &quot;civilized&quot; themselves to the point that they use only synthetic blood for feeding and prey on humans only at a minimal rate.  The entire weaving of the gothic structures and modern city-scape has been done before- but in few movies so well as in this one.

785301,A3IF373S0789NA,B0000VAFNQ,x_bruce,"[5, 5]","I liked the original Underworld but to the degree of it being a 3 1/2 versus this version, which does a much better job at maintaining continuity and fleshing out the storyline so that many questions from the original were answered, and one backstory made the character's intentions much more viable.I found a lot of silly plot holes in the theatrical version of Underworld and to some degree wonder who directed this film as Len Wiseman borrowed very heavily, particularly from The Matrix franchise. There are others but beyond seeing Neo make a guest appearence, Underworld was tainted by how heavily it followed it's Matrix leanings.The good news is the increased depth in characters. Intentions are better explained, and not in a super talky way, nor a non-stop video montage, both typical of the gothic horror genre.While the Romeo and Juliet theme is a bit stronger in this version of the film it was unavoidably obvious from the theatrical version, though there are signs Wiseman is more than adept at cloning genres with the occasional 'art film' dual themes played out over 2 or 3 minutes.That's one thing about film that people can easily forget. Adding, removing or editing a more concise segment or two can make the film vastly more enjoyable past the bullets and blood.Kate Beckensdale does a fine job as an action starlet, something punctuated by her work in The Aviator, another stretch from the costumed period pieces she'd been known for. Both films show her to be comfortable in any genre. Underworld does for Beckensdale what Fight Club did for equally well rounded and beautiful Helena Bonham Carter.Both roles were breakthrough in that they were so out of character as to be potential career blunders. Thankfully for screengoers both actresses aquitted themselves nicely, Beckensdale even more than Bonham Carter, as Carter's role was a scene stealing, tremendous character. Here, Kate Beckensdale is the lead actor and has substantially more screen time to make or break her performance.The only odd thing about Underworld not fixed were the various British actors sounding like East End thru high society London, the additions of Eastern European laced English coming from figures one might expect to see in a Czeck or Polish film, along with the 2004 style U.S. male actor, Scott Speedman for example, who sounds nearly stupid and inarticulate at times. Having seen him in other films such as the indie, low budget or B film, ""The 24th Day"" - youu choose the adjective, wasn't exactly mainstream though his performance was explosive and so much in character in than Underworld. The film has the gothic, European look with characters that work until you hear SoCal actors subtracting from the mood. In the Director's cut, Speedman's character is given 3 dimensions and the film benefits, but they whole unknown town theme is lost by the hodegpoge of three or four English speaking styles. It still doesn't work, although the new version explains more about Spendman's character, which sheds light on a lot of his behavior in the film.The new version proves, at least to my satisfaction, that good old filmaking skills are required beyond special effects, be they physical or CGI. The premise needs to be good, the script needs to be acceptable, the actors need to know their craft and the director needs to have a vision. Underworld isn't the first film to have been damaged in the editor's hands. See Blind Horizon - great cast, overworked premise and literally, hijacked film. When the editor is the person doing the film's voice over track you know there's trouble. When the director is a ghost, you know better or worse, the film wasn't his any longer. And finally, when the editor starts discussing the remaking of the film by resequencing segments and changing genre from mystery to action film, you know there are some serious problems. Oh, and when you see some of the deleted scenes and think, ""hmm, this looks like it was better than the film I just watched"" you know something very bad happened.And while that wasn't the case with the original Underworld versus the new cut, it certainly was missing a lot of important things, like exposition, depth of character and overall, better flow to the film than the original release.Verdict - Underworld Directors Cut is a better film than the original. It's pace is as quick as before but more gets through, and in this case, more is better. If you sat on the border about this film as I had it might bring you into the fan's camp. Most important, the film loses nothing from it's original release.As for buying it in a lavish 2 CD box? The first DVD has a good selection of extras, many similar or the same to the original release. DVD 2 has several new and interesting/insightful video that help explain how various areas of the film were made. There is considerable extras from the original release's already generous extras.If extras motivate you, there's plenty new mateirial to enjoy. If you loved the original, you might be curious and want to at least rent, though some stores don't include extra discs from what I've heard, and the extras are worthwhile. Most of all, if you were like me and felt something was missing from the theatrical release then this is worth a view, and quite possibly, a purchase.My rating is not quite a five star film, but it's a steady 4, perhaps higher as I watch it more. There is no doubt it is a better film than Underworld and if you haven't purchased the original this is certainly the way to go.The only question I have is whether they could have featured both cuts as they did in the new Alien series. Those discs are so dense with information you'd have to book a day to get through them, which brings me to my question. Why couldn't the original Underworld cut been available on this release?Greed, I suspect. Why stop at a measly two editions when there's the Platinum Superbit with 12:1:1 stereo and five different encoders built in so every computer known to mankind can play it back and make some money at the software end as most of these technologies are sold independently at $15 a codec.Am I jaded? You bet I am. Art is still product and if the CD/DVD companies are good at, and it certainly isn't creativity on the music side, the film side will squeeze the last penny from you given the chance. Still think I'm jaded? How about this...Batman Begins is already being released in one and two DVD collections with close to the same price, but one with extra features. I haven't seen it but it wouldn't surprise me at all if the second disc was unnecessary and only made to differentiate which version had more stuff on it. Still not convinced? How many releases of Aliens were there already before this new crop of re-edited and original?Be that the case. I'd reccomend this over the feature release version.",4,A much better cut than the original,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,6840,"['liked', 'original', 'Underworld', 'degree', 'being', '3', '1/2',

785302,A2J3MR64L567OK,B0000VAFNQ,Yossarian,"[3, 5]","Underworld looked fairly light and cheesy in the previews, so I avoided a theater trip and just rented the DVD.  I was mistaken.  It's actually an entertaining romp that is mostly eye candy but does have some interesting acting in it.  The somewhat goofy premise is as follows:Long ago, a human was born whose body was able to rapidly alter itself to resist environmental conditions.  This allowed him to survive a plague that destroyed his village.  His children inherited that trait.  One was bitten by a bat and spawned a race of vampires, while another was bitten by a wolf and spawned a race of werewolves (a.k.a. lycans).  A third did neither and hence the trait also survived in 'normal' humans.  This divergence of races was long ago forgotten, and vampires and werewolves are now at one another's throats (har har) over a millenia of real and imagined slights.  Kate Beckinsale plays a melodramatically-named 'Death Dealer', a vampire devoted to fighting lycans, who falls in love with a lycan candidate.  Unbeknownst to all but a few tricky lycans, that candidate is a descendent of the 'human' strain of the original sire of all three races, and has the potential to become a hybrid vampire/lycan.  Much mayhem and throat biting commences.Now, it's pretty obvious from the get-go that logic needs to get chucked out the window.  Similarly, there's about as many sparks flying between Beckinsale and her love interest as there is between the mayonnaise and bologna in a bad deli sandwich.  However the film does a surprisingly, almost effort-savingly good job of representing the various packs of night critters involved.  The lycans impressively shape shift into massive, combat-oriented werewolves whenever angered (quite similar to another underappreciated recent film, 'Dog Soldiers'), and while the vampires don't do a lot of typically vampiric things like mind control or turning into packs of rats, they at least manage the 'gaunt and world-weary' thing well.  You also get a sense of the hide-bound nature of their world, which is based on the endless rule of centuries-old elders and ancients, with newer vampires stuck in an immortality bereft of change or advancement.  There are some great action sequences, a lot of fine back stabbing, and generally a great deal of enthusiasm on all sides when the fur starts flying.  It really is almost enough to make up for the paper-thin plot and makes for a perfect summer movie..grab some popcorn and just enjoy the ride.On a side note, the general plot and themes seem to have been basically lifted wholesale from an entire book/RPG system of vampires v. werewolves that has been published by White Wolf for decades, to such an extent that I thought White Wolf had sponsored the film.  Apparently not, given the fact they're suing over it (see the 'quotes and trivia' link in the product description above).
