1653861,A16TTO0XISBJF0,B00D6I7GC8,Budas Root,"[0, 1]","This is a well-made and often audacious film.  Its prickly willingness to make everything sordid and ugly -- while fleshing this out with exhilarating editing, music and camerawork -- carried me through several enthralling watches, along with Brady Corbet's uncanny performance.  But, though I still can't stop watching Corbet work his rancid spell (no one is doing ""sexy young creep"" better right now), I have begun to see him and the film as rather self-indulgent and a bit flailingly pointless.  It's sort of fin-de-siecle art fifteen years too late, it doesn't need the unwieldy meta-subject of how visual culture deludes and tricks the brain (duh), and it should be less in awe of the tawdry sex which it loves to be aghast at.  In other words, Ulrich Seidl among others has given sharper and more challenging films about some of these same subjects.  In other other words, it panders to a high-minded viewership who can take comfort in calling its desperate characters ""sociopaths"" when that's not really what they are at all -- just young, sad, lonely, down and out, and speaking two different languages ... er, three, counting the universal one.  In other other other words, not being able to trust a film's good reviews has become for me an indication not to fully trust a film.  But I wouldn't bet against myself watching it several more times over the next few months.  It's just that kind of spicy noodle -- empty calories maybe, but tasty as all get out.",3,Mixed emotions,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1467,"['well-made', 'often', 'audacious', 'film', 'prickly', 'willingness', 'make', 'everything', 'sordid', 'ugly', 'fleshing', 'out', 'exhilarating', 'editing', 'music', 'camerawork', 'carried', 'several', 'enthralling', 'watches', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'uncanny', 'performance', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'Corbet', 'work', 'rancid', 'spell', 'one', 'doing', 'sexy', 'young', 'creep', 'better', 'right', 'now', 'have', 'begun', 'see', 'film', 'rather', 'self-indulgent', 'bit', 'flailingly', 'pointless', 'sort', 'fin-de-siecle', 'art', 'fifteen', 'years', 'too', 'late', ""n't"", 'need', 'unwieldy', 'meta-subject', 'how', 'visual', 'culture', 'deludes', 'brain', 'duh', 'should', 'be', 'less', 'awe', 'tawdry', 'sex', 'be', 'aghast', 'other', 'words', 'Ulrich', 'Seidl', 'others', 'given', 'sharper', 'more', 'challenging', 'films', 'same', 'subjects', 'other', 'other', 'words', 'high-minded', 'viewership', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'comfort', 'calling', 'desperate', 'characters', 'sociopaths', 'when', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'are', 'just', 'young', 'sad', 'lonely', 'down', 'speaking', 'two', 'different', 'languages', 'er', 'three', 'counting', 'universal', 'one', 'other', 'other', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'trust', 'film', 'good', 'reviews', 'become', 'indication', 'not', 'fully', 'trust', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'bet', 'watching', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'just', 'kind', 'spicy', 'noodle', 'empty', 'calories', 'maybe', 'tasty', 'get', 'out']",Simon Killer
1653862,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00D6I7GC8,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 9]","When it comes to making cinematic thrillers, there are a few ingredients required.  First (and foremost), you have to have a premise that works like a thriller - something that brings the audience to the edge of their seat and keeps them there for the length required in order for them to reasonably accept the experience as a thrill.  Second, while it helps to have characters, it helps even more to have characters one can relate to; without that connection - without caring about the protagonist and what he (or she) endures - there's little attachment to the events, and, as such, the emotional impact is lost.  And lastly it's important that it all be put together in such a way as to entice the audience to want to know more - to hang with the story as it unfolds - so that the climax feels like it was destined to be.Sadly, SIMON KILLER has none of this.  Still, the filmmaker wants you to believe there's a story here worth being told, and I don't think there is.  Certainly, there isn't one worthy of 106 minutes.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Simon (played with obvious psychosis by Brady Corbet) is a recent college grad and failed boyfriend working out his issues abroad when he inserts himself into the life of a young, exotic socialite named Victoria (Mati Diop).  Seemingly out of nowhere, he hatches a somewhat harebrained scheme for the two of them to blackmail some of her wealthy sex partners so they can live a life of leisure profiting from the sins of others.Let me say this for SIMON KILLER because I genuinely don't have much more that I can say about it: as a viewer, you have to buy in to a storyteller's hogwash from the very first frame in order for this to be a journey worth taking.  By that what I'm specifically underscoring is that Simon is deeply, deeply flawed but you're apparently not supposed to know that until the very end.  The problem is I knew it from the get-go, so every psychological step along the way that writer/director Antonio Campos probably believed was one big reveal after another wasn't any big reveal for me.  Given the fact that the formula was blatantly obvious, I suspect I knew this was a weird trip I wasn't all that interested in, and, consequently, I give it low marks.Were the performances worthwhile?Well, given the fact that I saw through the veil held up narratively, I didn't think so.  All nuance is gone when you know that you're watching a tragically flawed narrator go about his business not being honest with himself, nor those around him, nor the attending audience.  When you know you're being misled, then it's hard to follow the forced tangents and curiously uninteresting side jaunts put in front of you by even the most accomplished filmmaker.  As such, I'd call SIMON KILLER a massive failure.Will you?Well, now that you've read my review (assuming you have), you'll likely see through it, too.  That's the risks in reading a review once you've been suitably warned.  I can only speak for myself when I say that nothing felt like it was unfolding organically between the first and last frames of the film, and, as such, I wasn't captivated by it.  Instead, I saw this as the glorification of a flawed psychotic who probably didn't need my attention.SIMON KILLER (2012) is produced by IFC Films, FilmHaven Entertainment, and BorderLine Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  As for the technical specifications?  Meh.  The film is shot so obtusely (no doubt on purpose) that I had a hard time actually watching it without fast-forwarding through the overwrought sequences of `forced artistic merit' such as Simon walking down an unending street listening to blaring music on his iPod.  (Yeah, yeah, I get that it's a metaphor; it's just that it isn't a very good one.)  Plus, it's frequently ought of focus and rarely, if ever, are characters logically assembled in the frame.  (Again, I get that it's a metaphor, and I'd repeat my concern if I felt it was needed.)  Also, it has to be one of the worst miking jobs I've had the misfortune of sitting through, which came as a special surprise given the obvious highbrow nature of the storytelling.  Suffice it to say that, artistically, this just wasn't my cup of tea.  For those who think it worthy, then you can explore the special features, which include a short on Antonio Campos, some behind-the-scenes tidbits, and others.(NOT REALLY) RECOMMENDED.  As I often admit, I've no doubt that there's an audience for SIMON KILLER.  Art festivals, film aficionados, and academics will likely warm up to its pervasively chilling atmosphere and its storytelling pace that has all the effect of a good Ambien.  Writer/director Antonio Campos is likely still patting himself on the back for this twist ending, one he thinks audiences probably couldn't see coming.  I've got news for you, Antonio: if this is the best you can do, then SIMON KILLER had one foot in the grave before you even captured a scene on film.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of SIMON KILLER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1,Seriously Flawed Individuals Make For

1653863,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D6I7GC8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 6]","Despite an advertising campaign that might suggest that this is a pulse pounding thriller, writer/director Antonio Campos has fashioned a slow burn character study in ""Simon Killer.""  What's particularly unusual about this presentation, however, is that we don't know very much about the central figure even though we spend every moment of the film with him.  As bits and pieces of his personality and story emerge, we're never really sure of the whole truth.  Is he a likable misfit?  A needy loner looking for love?  A obsessive type that won't let go?  Or is he something inherently more disturbing?  As portrayed by Brady Corbet, in easily his most compelling performance to date, Simon is an enigma.  He has many layers, but you're never sure you want to peel off his mild mannered exterior.  His choices are questionable as are his motivations, but what exactly drives him?  ""Simon Killer,"" in an intriguing choice, leaves you to make up your own mind about a lot of these questions.  Through the course of the film, my opinion continued to evolve until the final scene.  And the movie has a haunting quality that caused it to remain in my thoughts long after I'd finished it.  To me, that always means they got something right!The movie begins as Corbet has arrived in Paris.  A recent college graduate, he is still hurting from a break-up with his childhood sweetheart.  He seems to need the time away to purge some unpleasant experiences from his memory.  In letters and calls, we learn that he has disappointed his parents and became rather confrontational with his girlfriend.  But we really only hear hints of what transpired from his perspective.  After spending much time alone, he starts to seek out the attention of the local ladies.  And he befriends a professional who works at a local sex club.  Their relationship is surprisingly tender as she responds to his yearning.  When he doesn't leave Paris as planned, the two grow closer.  He has some thoughts and ideas about her leaving the sex trade, so they enact a scheme to make that happen.  As the movie progresses, we see the repercussions of this decision.  It's as if his poor choices embolden him with newfound confidence, but I won't reveal where that leads.  While I've tried to be purposefully vague, the DVD cover gives even more away.It's probably best just to let the movie unravel at its own pace, it's mysterious element is one of its strongest attributes.  As I mentioned, this is NOT an in-your-face thriller.  It is a deliberately paced film that has an underlying creepiness instead.  Corbet is absolutely fantastic here.  Having been a child actor, he's made some bold choices in his career including ""Mysterious Skin,"" ""Funny Games,"" and ""Melancholia.""  Clearly he wants to be an actor as opposed to a star and has hand-picked challenging roles on the indie film scene.  This, though, is his best.  The movie also contains explicit nudity and sex (in case that scares you off), but the movie is geared toward an adult arthouse crowd.  ""Simon Killer"" is most definitely not for everyone.  But it creates and sustains a oddly creepy vibe that had me hooked.  There isn't a lot of action or thrills, instead this is a slow burn mood piece for the right audience.  I didn't have particularly high expectations, but I actually loved it.

1653865,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B00D6I7GC8,SJreviewsEverything,"[5, 7]","Told almost as a modern-day version of the novel In a Lonely Place, Simon Killer places us with a young American man fresh upon arrival in Paris (or so he says). He is struggling with getting over his ex, and falls in love with a French prostitute, also with (literal) scars. As seen in the trailer (so no spoilers), the two devise a scheme to blackmail her clients for cash. This doesn't quite work out.The narrative, though, is secondary to the extraordinary and wholly disturbing vision that is presented to us. The sex scenes, while erotic, are almost joyless, with Simon's lovers' heads often out of the shot, giving us a view of Simon leering at their nude bodies, or forcing them to turn around and face the opposite way, further dehumanizing his sexual partners.The unique experience of this film is further developed through the contrast of highly cinematic, ""fake""-feeling camera work with exceptionally neorealistic dialogue and acting. The very long shots feel as if we could be there watching live, but with the slight disconnect of a perfectly framed angle, or smooth turns bridging opposite characters or ends of the room.The focal point of the film, of course, is Simon himself, delivered in a fantastic performance by Brady Corbet (who you may recognize from Thirteen). He is nearly impossible to take your eyes off of, and gives a remarkably rich and believable portrayal of a womanizer, criminal, and yes, killer.Simon Killer is also extraordinary in how much it takes us by surprise - we rarely get films, either studio or independent, which places us with your everyday man who has the potential to kill. Recalling earlier events, I can now look back and see how we were given clues that Simon could be a criminal all along, but an audience is often unwilling to accept that our narrator, our door to this experience, is capable of such terrible acts. We share in his experience but don't want to bear the guilt of his actions. The film lets off a chilling conclusion and a sense of fluidity, that these events have likely happened before and will probably happen again.Simon Killer is a shining (?) dark spot in a year of film that was largely optimistic and happy-go-lucky. It offers a very fresh take on the traditional narrative and gives us an unforgettable cinematic experience.",5,Fantastic but definitely not for everyone,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2305,"['Told', 'almost', 'modern-day', 'version', 'novel', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'Simon', 'Killer', 'young', 'American', 'man', 'fresh', 'arrival', 'Paris', 'so', 'struggling', 'getting', 'ex', 'love', 'French', 'prostitute', 'also', 'literal', 'scars', 'seen', 'trailer', 'spoilers', 'two', 'devise', 'scheme', 'blackmail', 'clients', 'cash', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out.The', 'narrative', 'though', 'secondary', 'extraordinary', 'wholly', 'disturbing', 'vision', 'presented', 'sex', 'scenes', 'erotic', 'are', 'almost', 'joyless', 'Simon', 'lovers', 'heads', 'often', 'shot', 'giving', 'view', 'Simon', 'leering', 'nude', 'bodies', 'forcing', 'turn', 'around', 'face', 'opposite', 'way', 'further', 'dehumanizing', 'sexual', 'partners.The', 'unique', 'experience', 'film', 'further', 'developed', 'contrast', 'highly', 'cinematic', 'fake', '-feeling', 'camera', 'work', 'exceptionally', 'neorealistic', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'very', 'long', 'shots', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'there', 'watching', 'live', 'slight', 'disconnect', 'perfectly', 'framed', 'angle', 'bridging', 'opposite', 'characters', 'ends', 'room.The', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'course', 'Simon', 'delivered', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'who', 'may', 'recognize', 'Thirteen', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'remarkably', 'rich', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'womanizer', 'criminal', 'yes', 'killer.Simon', 'Killer', 'also', 'extraordinary', 'how', 'much', 'surprise', 'rarely', 'get', 'films', 'studio', 'independent', 'everyday', 'man', 'who', 'potential', 'kill', 'Recalling', 'earlier', 'events', 'can', 'now', 'look', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'were', 'given', 'clues', 'Simon', 'could', 'be', 'criminal', 'along', 'audience', 'often', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'narrator', 'door', 'experience', 'capable', 'such', 'terrible', 'acts', 'share', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'bear', 'guilt', 'actions', 'film', 'off', 'chilling', 'conclusion', 'sense', 'fluidity', 'events', 'have', 'likely', 'happened', 'will', 'probably', 'happen', 'again.Simon', 'Killer', 'shining', 'dark', 'spot', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'optimistic', 'happy-go-lucky', 'very', 'fresh', 'take', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'unforgettable', 'cinematic', 'experience']",Simon Killer

However, this is not the Paris of French film-makers,it is a foreshortened version, bodies decapitated by the screen cut. Campos is a product of Borderline,the talented film-maker collective behind last year's Sundance hit Martha Marcy May Marlene. Simon Killer is his follow-up to Afterschool.Technically advanced,strange angles,oppressive,close-up character study,moving pans,drenched in colour screens,abrupt musical intros,the unreliable narrator with sociopathic tendencies.Playing a creepy character as in Funny Games.Simon (Brady Corbet) claims to be a graduate in neuroscience,concerned with how the brain processes peripheral vision,yet he doesn't know what `nystagmus' is,a condition of Marianne,one of his pick-ups.He is a compulsive liar.His emails to his ex are all in his voiceovers, even hers to him.He also towards the end tells the passport control officer he's studying French literature, like the last girl he met.In truth Simon is alone in Paris looking for sex,full of deadly cunning,cut adrift from empathy or values. Ripley comes to mind,but even he would never stoop so low as to get his prostitute girl friend to film and blackmail customers.Chronicling the downward spiral of this inept protagonist,Campos subverts noir expectations,he is ably abetted by Mati Diop, touching as Victoria,who Simon moves in with and battens onto.He believes his lies until Mati peels away at them towards the end as he has gorged his confidence to launch into a new relationship as her spark dims. The sex is true to life.Simon treats women as objects to his own narcissim.There are languorous camera movements and surprising focal points in many scenes e.g.when he's picked her up in the bar and they've gone to a private area to talk as the camera pans away from them as if to widen the perspective.Simon is portrayed as both pathetic and vulnerable,his mother's `fox'and violently unstable,emotionally immature,'I always saw myself as more of a lion'.Simon is set in his ways,hiding darker impulses.Colours are drab,cameras set at waist level,cutting off torsos.Beneath the frail exterior,manic behaviour is prone to burst forth.The tourist manipulator,adapting to very person he meets, trying to bring a new self into identity, but full of motiveless malignity,deriving his drive for manliness by wrenching emotion from others.Simon grows into a monster as foretold in the title.Corbet quits himself well of this American psycho in Paris.Enjoyable film with urgent soundtrack.",4,Oppressive excellence,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,2606,"['Americans', 'Paris', 'film-makers', 'who', 'are', 'returning', 'inspirational', 'source', 'writers', 'once', 'did', 'twenties', 'However', 'not', 'Paris', 'French', 'film-makers', 'foreshortened', 'version', 'bodies', 'decapitated', 'screen', 'cut', 'Campos', 'product', 'Borderline', 'talented', 'film-maker', 'collective', 'last', 'year', 'Sundance', 'hit', 'Martha', 'Marcy', 'May', 'Marlene', 'Simon', 'Killer', 'follow-up', 'Afterschool.Technically', 'advanced', 'strange', 'angles', 'oppressive', 'close-up', 'character', 'study', 'moving', 'pans', 'drenched', 'colour', 'screens', 'abrupt', 'musical', 'intros', 'unreliable', 'narrator', 'sociopathic', 'tendencies.Playing', 'creepy', 'character', 'Funny', 'Games.Simon', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'be', 'graduate', 'neuroscience', 'concerned', 'how', 'brain', 'peripheral', 'vision', 'yet', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'nystagmus', 'condition', 'Marianne', 'one', 'pick-ups.He', 'compulsive', 'liar.His', 'ex', 'are', 'voiceovers', 'even', 'hers', 'him.He', 'also', 'end', 'passport', 'control', 'officer', 'studying', 'French', 'literature', 'last', 'girl', 'truth', 'Simon', 'alone', 'Paris', 'looking', 'sex', 'full', 'deadly', 'cunning', 'cut', 'adrift', 'empathy', 'values', 'Ripley', 'mind', 'even', 'would', 'never', 'stoop', 'so', 'low', 'get', 'prostitute', 'girl', 'friend', 'film', 'blackmail', 'customers.Chronicling', 'downward', 'spiral', 'inept', 'protagonist', 'Campos', 'noir', 'expectations', 'ably', 'abetted', 'Mati', 'Diop', 'touching', 'Victoria', 'who', 'Simon', 'battens', 'onto.He', 'lies', 'Mati', 'away', 'towards', 'end', 'gorged', 'confidence', 'launch', 'new', 'relationship', 'spark', 'dims', 'sex', 'true', 'life.Simon', 'treats', 'women', 'objects', 'own', 'narcissim.There', 'are', 'languorous', 'camera', 'movements', 'surprising', 'focal', 'points', 'many', 'scenes', 'picked', 'up', 'bar', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'private', 'area', 'talk', 'camera', 'away', 'widen', 'perspective.Simon', 'portrayed', 'pathetic', 'vulnerable', 'mother', ""fox'and"", 'violently', 'unstable', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'always', 'saw', 'more', ""lion'.Simon"", 'set', 'ways', 'hiding', 'darker', 'impulses.Colours', 'are', 'drab', 'cameras', 'set', 'waist', 'level', 'cutting', 'off', 'torsos.Beneath', 'frail', 'exterior', 'manic', 'behaviour', 'prone', 'burst', 'forth.The', 'tourist', 'manipulator', 'adapting', 'very', 'person', 'trying', 'bring', 'new', 'self', 'identity', 'full', 'motiveless', 'malignity', 'deriving', 'drive', 'manliness', 'wrenching', 'emotion', 'others.Simon', 'grows', 'monster', 'foretold', 'title.Corbet', 'well', 'American', 'psycho', 'Paris.Enjoyable', 'film', 'urgent', 'soundtrack']",Simon Killer
