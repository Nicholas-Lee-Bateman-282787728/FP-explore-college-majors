649482,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JPF3,Alistair McHarg,"[0, 7]","Some movies are so bad they're good; Plan 9 From Outer Space leads the category.  But others, like this one, are so bad they're bad.  Don't be misled by the presence of Jennifer Garner and Juliette Lewis who, under the right conditions, can deliver worthy performances.  This glossy, over inflated Dockers commercial simply lacks any redeeming qualities at all.  Catch and Release is a sloppy conglomeration of exhausted cliches, uninteresting, unlikable, and poorly drawn characters with the depth of wax paper, wrapped in a sequence of events far too ramshackle to deserve the word ""plot.""With some films, determining the root cause of catastrophe presents an interesting exercise; here there is no challenge at all.  Susannah Grant, who wrote and directed this tribute to vacuous superficiality, claims all the shame.  Can this be the same Susannah Grant that wrote Erin Brockovich?  Did she get lucky?  Maybe Erin Brockovich wasn't such a good movie after all.  Maybe Steven Soderbergh and Julia Roberts worked deep into the night rewriting.  One must wonder because Catch And Release is so poorly written that quotes from great writers appearing on the side of tea boxes provide the only relief.  Traditional elements of good writing such as memorable characters worth caring about, interesting situations driving profound spiritual growth, wit, humor, surprise, and fresh perspectives on familiar human situations are all absent from this picture.But enough about Ms. Grant's writing, such as it is.  Let's turn our attention to her directorial debut.  Admittedly, there is no Olivier or Brando in this cast, and even in Scorsese's hands Timothy Olyphant would still be outmatched by a brick of Velveeta cheese in the acting department.  (Let's be silent about silent Kevin Smith, he seems to be doing a bad Jack Black impression, who in turn is doing a bad John Belushi impression.  Sam Yeager, by contrast, might easily be mistaken for an errand boy or prop.)  But Garner is pretty good and Lewis quite good. (Lewis is playing a part that would have been handled so much better by Laura Dern.)  So whence the train wreck?  There are many moments in this film when one feels like one is watching a beginner's acting class, with well-meaning talentless kids going over the same soulless lines they've skimmed 100 times before, unable to bring even an iota of conviction to the task.A great director can get a wonderful performance out of an average actor doing mediocre material.  But to create a movie like this you need a horrible director coaxing horrible performances out of average actors burdened with appalling material.  At least with a Dockers commercial the pain is over in 60 seconds.",1,Do Not Catch This Recent Release,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,2701,"['movies', 'are', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'good', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'category', 'others', 'one', 'are', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'bad', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'presence', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'who', 'right', 'conditions', 'can', 'deliver', 'worthy', 'performances', 'glossy', 'inflated', 'Dockers', 'commercial', 'simply', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Catch', 'Release', 'sloppy', 'conglomeration', 'exhausted', 'cliches', 'uninteresting', 'unlikable', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'depth', 'wax', 'paper', 'wrapped', 'sequence', 'events', 'far', 'too', 'ramshackle', 'deserve', 'word', 'plot', 'films', 'determining', 'root', 'cause', 'catastrophe', 'presents', 'interesting', 'exercise', 'here', 'challenge', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'tribute', 'vacuous', 'superficiality', 'shame', 'Can', 'be', 'same', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'wrote', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Did', 'get', 'lucky', 'Maybe', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'good', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'worked', 'deep', 'night', 'rewriting', 'One', 'must', 'wonder', 'Catch', 'Release', 'so', 'poorly', 'written', 'great', 'writers', 'appearing', 'side', 'tea', 'boxes', 'provide', 'only', 'relief', 'Traditional', 'elements', 'good', 'writing', 'such', 'memorable', 'characters', 'caring', 'about', 'interesting', 'situations', 'driving', 'profound', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'wit', 'humor', 'surprise', 'fresh', 'perspectives', 'familiar', 'human', 'situations', 'are', 'absent', 'picture.But', 'enough', 'Ms.', 'Grant', 'writing', 'such', 'Let', 'turn', 'attention', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Admittedly', 'Olivier', 'Brando', 'cast', 'even', 'Scorsese', 'hands', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'outmatched', 'brick', 'Velveeta', 'cheese', 'acting', 'department', 'Let', 'be', 'silent', 'silent', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'be', 'doing', 'bad', 'Jack', 'Black', 'impression', 'who', 'turn', 'doing', 'bad', 'John', 'Belushi', 'impression', 'Sam', 'Yeager', 'contrast', 'might', 'easily', 'be', 'mistaken', 'errand', 'boy', 'prop', 'Garner', 'pretty', 'good', 'Lewis', 'quite', 'good', 'Lewis', 'playing', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'So', 'train', 'wreck', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'one', 'feels', 'one', 'watching', 'beginner', 'acting', 'class', 'well-meaning', 'talentless', 'kids', 'going', 'same', 'soulless', 'lines', ""'ve"", 'skimmed', '100', 'times', 'before', 'unable', 'bring', 'even', 'iota', 'conviction', 'task.A', 'great', 'director', 'can', 'get', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'average', 'actor', 'doing', 'mediocre', 'material', 'create', 'movie', 'need', 'horrible', 'director', 'coaxing', 'horrible', 'performances', 'average', 'actors', 'burdened', 'appalling', 'material', 'least', 'Dockers', 'commercial', 'pain', '60', 'seconds']",N/A

649484,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPF3,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","Yes, you heard me right; make sure you catch this movie before letting it go altogether.  I had absolutely no expectations going into this movie.  Wait, I take that back; I expected to abhor this movie.  Judging from the previews I just knew that this would be a huge waste of time.  I've never been much of a fan of Jennifer Garner in general, but after watching her beautifully restrained performance in `Juno' I decided that just maybe I should give this film a try.  I was still very hesitant but within the first few frames I was hooked.The film opens at the funeral for Grady Douglas.  Grady is leaving behind friends, family and Gray, his fianc&eacute;.  Gray, obviously lost and distraught, moves in with Grady's two friends Dennis and Sam, hoping to instill some stability.  That transition is made difficult by the presence of Grady's `other' friend Fritz.  Gray has never understood Fritz and makes it very obvious that she dislikes him, but soon she realizes that all she thought Fritz was is not the man he truly is and she begins to understand why Grady felt so highly of Fritz.The story is a bit uneven and the romance that spawns between Gray and Fritz seems a tad unrealistic, but like I mentioned, this film is still worth `catching'.  When a surprise guest arrives in the form of Grady's ex-flame Maureen things get a little sticky but eventually the five (Gray, Fritz, Dennis, Sam and Maureen) find themselves, their real selves, amidst all the turmoil and tragedy.Performance wise this movie belongs to Kevin Smith.  I know what you're thinking but I'm totally serious.  As Sam he is both funny and charming and in the end he has some of the most endearing moments in the film.  I was impressed with his performance mostly because it's much more mature than anything you'd expect from him.  I love Juliette Lewis and her performance here is her zany self, all over the place yet surprising ly emotionally grounded.  The film seems bored with Dennis so Sam Jaeger's performance winds up forgettable.  I've always felt that Timothy Olyphant is extremely creepy looking and sadly this takes away from his performance.  When he stares at Jennifer it just gives me the creeps.  Fiona Shaw has a nice turn here as the Grady's mother.  She comes across bitter and cold yet in the end shows a nice layer of emotional purity.Garner also delivers nicely here.  The script at times trips her character up by giving her arch's that are unbelievable and even in moments unlikable, but Garner manages to waltz through them well.  Her performance in `Juno' is still by far her finest acting moment, but this has it's moments as well.  The opening scene at the funeral alone is flawlessly done.  There is so much genuine emotion in her reaction, so much sincerity within her performance there that I was sucked into the film immediately.`Catch and Release' wants us to know that even though we think we know someone we may not really but it's okay.  We can survive and, in the end, learning of their mistakes can help us define the person we're meant to become.This is far from a perfect film but it's sweet and enjoyable and is bound to make you feel warm inside, and that in itself is worth fishing for.",3,"Catch it, then release it; just make sure you catch it first...",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3210,"['Yes', 'heard', 'right', 'make', 'sure', 'catch', 'movie', 'letting', 'go', 'altogether', 'had', 'absolutely', 'expectations', 'going', 'movie', 'Wait', 'take', 'back', 'expected', 'abhor', 'movie', 'Judging', 'previews', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'waste', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'much', 'fan', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'general', 'watching', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Juno', 'decided', 'just', 'maybe', 'should', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'hesitant', 'first', 'few', 'frames', 'was', 'hooked.The', 'film', 'opens', 'funeral', 'Grady', 'Douglas', 'Grady', 'leaving', 'friends', 'family', 'Gray', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Gray', 'obviously', 'lost', 'distraught', 'moves', 'Grady', 'two', 'friends', 'Dennis', 'Sam', 'hoping', 'instill', 'stability', 'transition', 'made', 'difficult', 'presence', 'Grady', 'other', 'friend', 'Fritz', 'Gray', 'never', 'understood', 'Fritz', 'very', 'obvious', 'soon', 'thought', 'Fritz', 'was', 'not', 'man', 'understand', 'why', 'Grady', 'felt', 'so', 'highly', 'Fritz.The', 'story', 'bit', 'uneven', 'romance', 'Gray', 'Fritz', 'tad', 'unrealistic', 'mentioned', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'catching', 'When', 'surprise', 'guest', 'form', 'Grady', 'ex-flame', 'Maureen', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'sticky', 'eventually', 'five', 'Gray', 'Fritz', 'Dennis', 'Sam', 'Maureen', 'find', 'real', 'selves', 'turmoil', 'tragedy.Performance', 'wise', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', ""'m"", 'totally', 'serious', 'Sam', 'funny', 'charming', 'end', 'most', 'endearing', 'moments', 'film', 'was', 'impressed', 'performance', 'mostly', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'anything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'love', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'performance', 'here', 'zany', 'self', 'place', 'yet', 'surprising', 'ly', 'emotionally', 'grounded', 'film', 'bored', 'Dennis', 'so', 'Sam', 'Jaeger', 'performance', 'up', 'forgettable', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'looking', 'sadly', 'away', 'performance', 'When', 'Jennifer', 'just', 'creeps', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'nice', 'turn', 'here', 'Grady', 'mother', 'bitter', 'cold', 'yet', 'end', 'nice', 'layer', 'emotional', 'purity.Garner', 'also', 'nicely', 'here', 'script', 'times', 'trips', 'character', 'up', 'giving', 'arch', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'moments', 'unlikable', 'Garner', 'waltz', 'well', 'performance', 'Juno', 'still', 'far', 'finest', 'acting', 'moment', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'opening', 'scene', 'funeral', 'alone', 'flawlessly', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'reaction', 'so', 'much', 'sincerity', 'performance', 'was', 'sucked', 'film', 'immediately.', 'Catch', 'Release', 'know', 'even', 'think', 'know', 'someone', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'okay', 'can', 'survive', 'end', 'learning', 'mistakes', 'can', 'help', 'define', 'person', ""'re"", 'meant', 'become.This', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'sweet', 'enjoyable', 'bound', 'make', 'feel', 'warm', 'inside', 'worth', 'fishing']",N/A
649485,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JPF3,Andy Orrock,"[1, 2]","It's hard not to like Jennifer Garner, but she makes it hard for her many fans here - a likable young lady stuck in a lukewarm movie.Compare this to13 Going On 30 (Special Edition)- Gary Winick made a tight, no-compromises comedy there and had great supporting players like Mark Ruffalo (a mark of excellence in whatever he's in), the underrated Judy Greer and Andy Serkis.  Susannah Grant wroteErin Brockovichand the screenplay forIn Her Shoes, which I really liked...so she deserved this director's shot.  It felt loose and flabby though.  While not unpleasant, it didn't stick with me at all.  I was put off by Kevin Smith's one-trick pony character (we get it, you like to eat) and thought the others didn't get a chance to establish themselves in the script.  This became more apparent the next night when we watchedDil Chahta Hai- these Bollywood films dedicate significant time letting you get to know each of the characters in the film.  While I don't want my average viewing to be 2 hours 45 mins, I wouldn't mind a bit more development.  For example, we barely know Sam Jaeger's Dennis, even though he was Garner's deceased fianc&eacute;'s business partner (what business were they even in?) and long-time friend.  So, when he opens up and declares his [ultimately unrequited] love for Garner's character, we don't know what to think.I'm confident Ms. Grant will do better the next time out.

649494,A2QHYTS231GJB3,B00005JPF3,Christie W.,"[3, 6]","I didn't have high expectations for this movie but it was actually pretty good.  My biggest complaint is the raunchy sex scene in the very beginning that was distasteful- I understand its point, to see Fritz's personality but I think it could've been done better in another way.Jennifer Garner, though the bigger name of the movie and the main character, is not the stand-out performance.  Kevin Smith, as a fount of endless quotes (from boxes of tea), is hilarious as Sam.  I personally have never seen any of his movies but he was great here- so real, silly, believable, and fun!  He was the most multi-faceted character of the bunch- on one hand grieving for his best friend and trying to comfort his fiance and on the other talking/eating/drinking/fishing/overall goofing off self  (oh he also seemed to roam around in his pj's a lot...) The little boy, Mattie, is also very cute and has some great, very funny scene-stealing moments.  I won't ruin the surprise for you.The romance, though it moves to the next level a little prematurely, was sweet.  Fritz (Timothy Olyphant), depicted as a lothario of sorts, is actually a kind man and a true friend.  As Gray says it makes sense that she falls for him because this was the man Grady was able to be himself with and she is too.  (I agree with another reviewer that it would've been nice for ""them"" to show Grady in a flashback- to see how Gray was with him or to zoom in on his picture so we have an idea of what he looks like- to compare to the kid if nothing else.)A movie worth renting if nothing else (I don't think it's a movie you'll watch more than once).  It's a cute romance with some sad, real overtones about life, death, love, friendship.  But it still leaves you with a smile on your face and that's the point of chick flicks... for the most part (cute guys don't hurt the mix, either).",4,A pleasant surprise,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,1854,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'raunchy', 'sex', 'scene', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'distasteful-', 'understand', 'point', 'see', 'Fritz', 'personality', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'better', 'way.Jennifer', 'Garner', 'bigger', 'name', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'fount', 'endless', 'quotes', 'boxes', 'tea', 'hilarious', 'Sam', 'personally', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movies', 'was', 'great', 'here-', 'so', 'real', 'silly', 'believable', 'fun', 'was', 'most', 'multi-faceted', 'character', 'bunch-', 'one', 'hand', 'grieving', 'best', 'friend', 'trying', 'comfort', 'fiance', 'other', 'talking/eating/drinking/fishing/overall', 'goofing', 'off', 'self', 'also', 'seemed', 'roam', 'around', 'pj', 'lot', 'little', 'boy', 'Mattie', 'also', 'very', 'cute', 'great', 'very', 'funny', 'scene-stealing', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'surprise', 'you.The', 'romance', 'next', 'level', 'little', 'prematurely', 'was', 'sweet', 'Fritz', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'depicted', 'lothario', 'sorts', 'actually', 'kind', 'man', 'true', 'friend', 'Gray', 'sense', 'was', 'man', 'Grady', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'too', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'show', 'Grady', 'flashback-', 'see', 'how', 'Gray', 'was', 'zoom', 'picture', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'like-', 'compare', 'kid', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'renting', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'cute', 'romance', 'sad', 'real', 'overtones', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'friendship', 'still', 'smile', 'face', 'point', 'chick', 'flicks', 'most', 'part', 'cute', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'mix']",N/A

Overall PQ 4/5 and AQ 4/5. The Film is a 3/5.As a budding fan of Jennifer Garner, I was hoping for a solid film where she could engage us, as the girl next door, caught up in a love dramedy. After viewing the film,it's clear she, as well as the other actors did what they could to convey the plight and life situation of these characters. The film never rally takes off-it hovers on the edge of comedy, drama and self-discovery, but to me, just seemed to be a half-hearted attempt to elicit sympathy and empathy, from the audience.I love romantic comedies, but this one seems like a series of vignettes-never really arriving. The end seems oddly compensatory, and we never really feel as though Jennifer Garner's character finds herself or stands on her own. I was sorely disappointed, that the setting itself was the best character in the film.****Spoiler Alert***The story arc feels very ""catch and release""-the story has its moments, like when Jennifer Garner's character realizes that her fiance has been cheating on her, and the part where she is told that her fiance's friend is in love with her. But no storyline is actually pursued. Things are said and done, but the pieces feel slightly ""off"". The film has no beginning, middle and end-it just kind of drifts.

Screenwriter Susannah Grant (In Her Shoes) presents a potentially involving premise about the artificially named Gray Wheeler, a young woman whose fianc&eacute; Grady dies in a freak boat accident just before they were to wed. As a first-time director, Grant has trouble pacing the story in any compelling manner, and unexpected dramatic turns seem buried in the casually meandering plot. Word to the wise: Always be wary of movies that have theatrical releases in January since that means the studio has concluded they are not award-worthy material.After the requisite mourning scene, Gray spends most of the rest of the story sorting out her late fianc&eacute;'s estate in idyllic Boulder, Colorado, and hanging out with his trio of friends, all of whom hold some kind of torch for her. A not entirely surprising development occurs with the arrival of Maureen, a spacey massage therapist from LA with her hyperactive three-year old son in tow. The supporting cast is game, though there is such an unrelenting therapy vibe about their scenes that the camaraderie among Grady's friends feels forced and free of honest conflict. With his cold-eyed stare and insinuating manner, Timothy Olyphant (HBO'sDeadwood) plays the elliptical Fritz, who has moved to LA to become a womanizing director of TV commercials and yet holds the answers to many of Gray's questions. Sardonic filmmaker Kevin Smith plays best friend Sam with shaggy dog appeal (though the running gag about the quotes from Celestial Seasonings teabag boxes grows tiresome), while Sam Jaeger has the thankless role of the secretly smitten Dennis.Playing her standard self-absorbed ditz, Juliette Lewis does not call in her performance, but her freshness as an idiosyncratic actress has definitely faded. There are a couple of funny comedy scenes - the first as Gray listens to Fritz's ardent sex act behind a shower curtain and the second a comical massage session between Sam and Maureen (which looks lifted from the one between Barbra Streisand and Robert De Niro inMeet The Fockers). The rest is sheer pabulum about the effects of grief executed in a by-the-numbers style absent of any black comedy or any realistic edge. The most noteworthy aspect of the production is John Lindley's superb cinematography which nicely captures the pastoral Colorado settings. In fact, he provides relatively technical insights along with Grant on one of two commentary tracks in the 2007 DVD. The other track with Smith and Grant conversing is more entertaining though admittedly less connected with the scenes over which they speak in the movie.",2,Toothless Pabulum About a Young Woman's Grief Has Very Few Sunny Spots,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,2859,"['Beautiful', 'not', 'intimidating', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'can', 'be', 'pleasing', 'screen', 'presence', 'proven', 'knack', 'comedy', 'most', 'lugubrious', '2007', 'dramedy', 'character', 'so', 'sketchily', 'developed', 'much', 'charm', 'neutralized', 'process', 'Screenwriter', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'potentially', 'involving', 'premise', 'artificially', 'named', 'Gray', 'Wheeler', 'young', 'woman', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Grady', 'freak', 'boat', 'accident', 'just', 'were', 'wed.', 'first-time', 'director', 'Grant', 'trouble', 'pacing', 'story', 'compelling', 'manner', 'unexpected', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'seem', 'buried', 'casually', 'meandering', 'plot', 'Word', 'wise', 'Always', 'be', 'wary', 'movies', 'have', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'January', 'studio', 'concluded', 'are', 'not', 'award-worthy', 'material.After', 'requisite', 'mourning', 'scene', 'Gray', 'most', 'rest', 'story', 'sorting', 'out', 'late', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'estate', 'idyllic', 'Boulder', 'Colorado', 'hanging', 'out', 'trio', 'friends', 'whom', 'hold', 'kind', 'torch', 'not', 'entirely', 'surprising', 'development', 'arrival', 'Maureen', 'spacey', 'massage', 'therapist', 'LA', 'hyperactive', 'three-year', 'old', 'son', 'tow', 'supporting', 'cast', 'game', 'such', 'unrelenting', 'therapy', 'vibe', 'scenes', 'camaraderie', 'Grady', 'friends', 'feels', 'forced', 'free', 'honest', 'conflict', 'cold-eyed', 'stare', 'insinuating', 'manner', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', ""HBO'sDeadwood"", 'elliptical', 'Fritz', 'who', 'moved', 'LA', 'become', 'womanizing', 'director', 'TV', 'commercials', 'yet', 'answers', 'many', 'Gray', 'questions', 'Sardonic', 'filmmaker', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'best', 'friend', 'Sam', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'appeal', 'running', 'gag', 'quotes', 'Celestial', 'Seasonings', 'teabag', 'boxes', 'tiresome', 'Sam', 'Jaeger', 'thankless', 'role', 'secretly', 'smitten', 'Dennis.Playing', 'standard', 'self-absorbed', 'ditz', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'not', 'call', 'performance', 'freshness', 'idiosyncratic', 'actress', 'definitely', 'faded', 'are', 'couple', 'funny', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'first', 'Gray', 'Fritz', 'ardent', 'sex', 'act', 'shower', 'curtain', 'second', 'comical', 'massage', 'session', 'Sam', 'Maureen', 'lifted', 'one', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Fockers', 'rest', 'sheer', 'pabulum', 'effects', 'grief', 'executed', 'by-the-numbers', 'style', 'absent', 'black', 'comedy', 'realistic', 'edge', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'aspect', 'production', 'John', 'Lindley', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'nicely', 'pastoral', 'Colorado', 'settings', 'fact', 'relatively', 'technical', 'insights', 'Grant', 'one', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', '2007', 'DVD', 'other', 'track', 'Smith', 'Grant', 'conversing', 'more', 'entertaining', 'admittedly', 'less', 'connected', 'scenes', 'speak', 'movie']",N/A

That's not her strongpoint. Her wardrobe was hideous. But just getting back to the movie it was not something we'd recommend. We recommended HOLIDAY recently with Cameron Diaz & Kate Winslet - that was adorable. But a couple high points of ""CATCH"" were Grady's mother coming round at the end and Kevin's character getting together with Juliette Lewis (she WAS great!). As a romantic comedy it was horrible. As a romance it was very so-so. As a drama it was light. I wanted to see something exciting happen with everyone, some windfall of money Grady'd left to all of them, or some sizzling emotional scenes with Olyphant & Garner. Garner does deserve credit for portraying a miss-perfect waspy  princess very well. I felt much of the plot was unrealistic.

649508,AVEVNXZGYY2CE,B00005JPF3,GadgetChick,"[12, 13]","I went into watching this with no idea what to expect. I haven't really seen Jennifer Garner in much of anything (wasn't an Alias fan) but I like Kevin Smith and I think Timothy Olyphant is really cute :) so I decided to give it a chance.This is actually a very sweet, heartfelt little movie. It doesn't contain many earth-shattering revelations about the Meaning of Life but it is head and shoulders above most romantic comedies, in my opinion. It does bring up some interesting points in answer to the question, ""How well do we really know the people we love?"" I thought that Garner's characters' struggles with the aftermath of her fiance's death - the big secret he concealed from her, dealing with her ex-future-mother-in-law, the roommate who blames himself for her fiance's death, the roommate who is in love with her, the friend who was complicit in her fiance's dishonesty who she's now attracted to, the ""other woman,"" etc. - were realistically-portrayed and entertaining to watch.Garner was delightful in this role and I thought portrayed the emotions and mental struggles of her character very authentically. Kevin Smith was great - you forget what a good actor he can be because his own movies get so bogged down in substituting volume of dialogue for quality. In this he actually brings a lot of subtle humor and heart to his role, which in his hands would probably have not been handled nearly as deftly. Timothy Olyphant is deliciously sexy and he also brings a lot of subtle light and shading to his role, and plays the romantic hero in a bit of a different way than you usually see. The movie did have some interesting points about how much we blind ourselves to the faults of the people we love. One of my favorite scenes was very near the end, when Gray is talking about a perfect day on the river she shared with her fiance. At the end of the day, driving home, he says he needs to tell her something, and she asks if it will make her happier or less happy. When he says ""less happy"" she tells him not to tell her. I think we all have a tendency to choose blissful ignorance over painful knowledge where are loved ones are concerned, and can make ourselves be happy with that even when we know we're choosing not to know the whole truth about them.All in all, this is not a real ""feel-good"" picture although the ending is happy. It's not a tortured indie but nor is it a brainless mush of a rom-com that we've all seen a hundred million times. I liked it because it was serious and dealt with tough subjects but was uplifting overall. I hate brainless movies, but I also dislike how depressing many ""serious"" movies are. I don't need any more reasons to lose faith in my fellow man; if I want to see man's inhumanity to man all I have to do is turn on the evening news. I liked ""Catch and Release"" because it was not a dumb movie but it was not depressing either.

649513,A21XG7UVD2ABKS,B00005JPF3,Jack R. Tallent,"[4, 8]","Catch & Release is a prime example of Form Over Substance movie making. It has all the right ingredients for the type of movie it attempts to be, but ends up being rather grotesque because it lacks a soul.What kind of movie is it trying to be? Think ""The Big Chill"" and you're pretty close. A group of friends are brought together by the tragic death of a mutually loved one, and undergo a time of revelation and growth.Except the characters in C&R; fail to convey at any time any amount of credible human sentiment. This creates a rather jarring experience for the viewer, as the tone of the film tells us that we should indeed be experiencing something touching. The end result is every bit as charming as reanimated corpses smiling at you and sharing.This brings me to the annoyance of ""The Poignant Soundtrack."" Its the equivalent to throwing up a coat of paint on a building that needs some real work. Walk by on the street and it looks okay if you don't look too carefully. This film definitely did not earn its soundtrack.Of the many things that did not work in this film, perhaps the worst offender was Kevin ""Silent Bob"" Smith as Sam. Besides not being the greatest actor, he was tasked with implementing a few pieces of half-hearted business which were part of this film's thin veneer. They saddled Sam with this Celestial Seasonings bit, which needed to be better written for it to work (as it was it was a botched detail that went nowhere.) Also, Sam's dialog peppered with the word ""Sir"" came off as wooden and weird, rather than being quirkily real as was no doubt the intent. Even the film's title is part of a half-finished detail of the film (it relates to fly fishing, but has nothing to do with anything, really.)The end result of all this is that you have only contempt for characters you are supposed to empathize with, and you feel disgusted by the whole affair.One high point of the film is the cinematography, specifically the outdoor scenes which are quite beautiful.",2,Not Good!,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,1992,"['Catch', 'Release', 'prime', 'example', 'Form', 'Over', 'Substance', 'movie', 'making', 'right', 'ingredients', 'type', 'movie', 'be', 'up', 'being', 'rather', 'grotesque', 'soul.What', 'kind', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'Think', 'Big', 'Chill', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'close', 'group', 'friends', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'tragic', 'death', 'mutually', 'loved', 'one', 'undergo', 'time', 'revelation', 'growth.Except', 'characters', 'C', 'R', 'fail', 'convey', 'time', 'amount', 'credible', 'human', 'sentiment', 'rather', 'jarring', 'experience', 'viewer', 'tone', 'film', 'should', 'indeed', 'be', 'experiencing', 'something', 'touching', 'end', 'result', 'bit', 'as', 'charming', 'reanimated', 'corpses', 'smiling', 'sharing.This', 'brings', 'annoyance', 'Poignant', 'Soundtrack', 'equivalent', 'throwing', 'up', 'coat', 'paint', 'building', 'real', 'work', 'Walk', 'street', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'carefully', 'film', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'earn', 'soundtrack.Of', 'many', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'film', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'offender', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Smith', 'Sam', 'not', 'being', 'greatest', 'actor', 'was', 'tasked', 'implementing', 'few', 'pieces', 'half-hearted', 'business', 'were', 'part', 'film', 'thin', 'veneer', 'saddled', 'Sam', 'Celestial', 'Seasonings', 'bit', 'needed', 'be', 'better', 'written', 'work', 'was', 'was', 'botched', 'detail', 'went', 'nowhere', 'Also', 'Sam', 'dialog', 'peppered', 'word', 'Sir', 'came', 'off', 'wooden', 'weird', 'rather', 'being', 'quirkily', 'real', 'was', 'doubt', 'intent', 'Even', 'film', 'title', 'part', 'half-finished', 'detail', 'film', 'fly', 'fishing', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'really', 'end', 'result', 'have', 'only', 'contempt', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'empathize', 'feel', 'disgusted', 'whole', 'affair.One', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'cinematography', 'specifically', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'beautiful']",N/A

Instead, it's a mature romantic-comedy with none of the stereotypical atmosphere of the aforementioned films. It's written and directed by Susannah Grant, who wrote ""Erin Brockovich"" and has a much more adult feel to it but is still not perfect, with a contrived script and an unfortunately happy ending. Jennifer Garner plays Gray, whose fianc&eacute;e is killed in a boating accident days before their wedding. Now, with no money to stay in her house she moves in with her fianc&eacute;e's best friends Dennis (Sam Jaeger) and Sam (Kevin Smith, yes as in Silent Bob). Also staying in the house is Fritz (Timothy Olymphant), a friend of her fianc&eacute;e's whom she despises and not just because he had sex with with a woman at the funeral. Just as Gray begins to mourn the loss of her beloved, she discovers that he's the father of a young boy and has been paying child support payments. Not only that, but he's also rich with a million dollars in his bank account. Pretty soon, without money, the mother of the child Maureen (Juliette Lewis, who was the it-girl of the nineties and has only had bit parts over the last few years) shows up...Oh and Gray begins having a surprise affair with Fritz. A lot of things happen in a very short amount of time in this film. Another thing I noticed is that every time a character has a private conversation with another, there's always the wrong person eavesdropping around the corner...Which is, of course, a romantic-comedy stereotype. But this movie has a lot of high-points too! I love the fully fleshed out characters, who all seem incredibly realistic (although their actions are sometimes not). All the quirks that real people you know have, that never show up in movies, show up here. Such as quoting endless quotes they've seen on the back of tea boxes. You know? Things like that. While Garner is oober-charming and Olymphant is perfect, as the semi-sleazy love interest and Lewis signals a career comeback with her ditzy young mother performance it's Kevin Smith that steals the show. Smith once said that he couldn't act and that's why he played Silent Bob. Well, I hope that Smith appears in more movies because he can act and he is hilarious! It's obvious that Grant gave Smith some freedom with his character, because if you've ever seen Smith being interview you'll notice his vocal facility and his choice of words (such as saying 'sir' the way other people would say 'dude') is very similar to that of his character Sam. The verbal comedy is funny enough, but some of his facial expressions are absolutely hilarious as well. ""Catch and Release"" obviously isn't perfect and I think the casual moviegoer probably will like their typical romantic-comedies more than this one, but I think if you appreciate that Grant was trying to make a more adult-oriented rom-com than you'll enjoy this movie quite a bit.

Hayes ""bibliophile""","[0, 0]","Wedding days are meant to be happy, but for Gray Wheeler (Jennifer Garner) that happiness is marred when her fianc&eacute;, Grady, dies right before the wedding.  On the day of his funeral, she has a wedding cake in the refrigerator, and she is turning away the wedding flowers at the door.After his death, Gray finds she cannot afford the house they bought together so recently that her fianc&eacute; hadn't even moved in yet.  She moves into the house he shared with two roommates, his friends Sam (Kevin Smith) and Dennis (Sam Jaeger) as well as a third friend who has come from out of state for the wedding and stayed for the funeral - Fritz (Timothy Olyphant). She works at rebuilding her life from the ashes of her tragedy - only to find that Fate isn't done with her yet. In settling his finances, she learns that there was an aspect of his past that he never told her about.  His not so distant past.  Feeling more than a little betrayed, she comes face to face with this living breathing reminder that her late fianc&eacute; was not perfect.His friends, who are also her friends, are very supportive of Gray, especially Fritz. He's a very enigmatic sort of guy, but he's there for her.  He helps her to deal with this curveball that's been thrown into her life. She doesn't even realize she's falling for him, which causes other problems, cause Dennis is in love with Gray too. Gray is determined, though, not to get hurt again, and isn't willing to put her heart on the line for anything, or anyone.  What will it take to get her to live again?I'll be honest, I watched this movie because Timothy Olyphant was in it, and I'm a huge fan of his.  But I'm really glad I did.  It was sweet and poignant and romantic, and it was fun to see another facet of Timothy.  I can see some similarity to Raylan Givens (Justified) in Fritz, but not enough to mar his portrayal in any way. The supporting cast is really good.  Juliette Lewis as the unexpected fly in the ointment was quirky and funny.  She played a masseuse with more heart than brains, and a bent for natural foods. I loved the interaction between her and Kevin Smith. Kevin shows in his portrayal of Sam that he can do more than humor, and I loved his constant recitation of the sayings he gleaned from the tea company he works for - an obvious take-off on Celestial Seasonings.  Sam Jaeger's Dennis had me wondering sometimes about his obsession with Gray, as obsessive characters sometimes do, but it was well done and human.  Perhaps we can see the ending coming--it is a romance, after all--but I think the development was handled well, and was not forced or rushed.

It's better thanBecause I Said So (Widescreen Edition), but nowhere near as good asMusic and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition).What's wrong with the script? Well, nothing, if you like bad TV sitcoms. Like ""M*A*S*H"" at its worst, ""Catch & Release"" takes likable characters and forces them to deliver overwritten lines that are always just a little too clever for their own good.In other words, ""Catch & Release"" left me cold -- and confused. Just how does Jennifer Garner's character know so little about the man she was going to marry? Why is this mourning widow so eager to hook up with a shallow pretty boy like Timothy Olyphant? Why is Juliette Lewis such a flake? Why doesn't anyone ever discipline the little brat? And why doesn't anyone ever have to go to work? These characters all have plenty of time for intimate confessions, sex, farmers markets, sex, fishing, sex, peace gardens and yes, sex... but just when do they earn a living?The movie does work, however, as an informercial.

649525,A3WIOO9L0DNGZ,B00005JPF3,Kevin Major,"[2, 4]","Catch and Release is, in a word, boring.  The main plot - a woman learning and coping with the knowledge that her dead fiance is not the man she thought he was - should have been enough meet for a quality writer to carve out a satisfying story.  Instead, Catch and Release is a sloppy brew of grief, romance, comedy, and tragedy without any focus to speak of.Jennifer Garner's performance was bland.  It seems as though she has two emotions: confusion, and on-the-verge-of-crying.  The perpetual pout she exhibits does nothing but emphasize her lack of acting chops.  It's as though the director found that one emotion she can display with some ability and told her to hold that look throughout the film.The supporting cast is largely useless.  While they all serve some purpose in driving a particular plot element home, as people they're primarily two-dimensional.  There's the funny guy who is really a bit emotionally troubled.  There's the guy secretly in love with Garner but isn't the man for her.  It's as though each character's personality and motivation came from an index card rather than from something more organic.Character growth, unsurprisingly, is virtually non-existent.  The only character to really change is Kevin Smith's.  Given that he's primarily comic relief and all-but-ignored during the last quarter of the film, it strikes me as odd that he'd be the one to truly show some change.  The rest all move away, but never really move on.  Maybe that's the point, but given the lack of subtlety and artistic vision in this film, I sincerely doubt it.  That's not the worst of it, however.The engine of the plot mainly seems to be sitcom-esque misunderstandings.  A half-heard conversation here, a rude note left on the counter here, and the plot moves one notch forward.  It would be bearable if comedic hijinks stemmed from these convenient mistakes, but instead the characters are left temporarily wounded.  If that wasn't enough, it's all largely predictable.This movie follows a clear formula.  The scenes alternate between Garner's attempts to cope with her new life and the secondary character's similar attempts to grow up and/or move on from their own hangups and insecurities.  After each scene, overly-emotional college rock is played in an attempt to hammer home the emotional point.  It's all rather transparent and, by the end of the movie, nauseating.  It's also an obvious attempt to pull at the viewer's heartstrings, but suffers because of it.  Indeed, it seems like something a first year theater student would try.  In trying to portray the movie and characters as being 'in' with the college crowd, the director proves that they are anything but.In the end, Catch and Release is flawed from the first minute.  With Garner's perpetual pout, a boring script, no sense of pacing, and obvious attempts at convincing the viewer that, no, seriously, this is a cool film for college students, this film doesn't even deserve a rental.

649529,A30922VZC14CT0,B00005JPF3,Kurt Stefan,"[10, 16]","**** Warning!  Major Spoilers in this Review! ****This is the kind of movie that gives romantic comedies a bad name. Each situation in this trite and forgettable piece is contrived to the nth degree. There isn't a moment of genuine emotional honesty in the film. What we get is the director choosing to insert a sappy alt-lite song every five minutes to underline how her characters are feeling. Apparently, all of them are feeling drowsy and folksy, because that is what every soporific musical interlude sounds like.The plot starts with Jennifer Garner mourning the passing of her fianc&eacute;. We know she's upset because she tells us in a pointless voice-over. Then she runs from the room of mourners to shut herself in the bathroom and get in the tub. Why? Because the writer obviously thought this would be cute somehow. It just comes off as stupid. While in the bathtub, one of her late fianc&eacute;'s ""friends"" comes in with a caterer, and to show his grief, he bangs her on the sink while she repeats ""sock it to me"" several times. Why? Guess the writer thought this would be quirky and amusing. It's not, just weird and inappropriate and bad writing. This kind of behavior would never in a million years happen at a funeral. As played by Timothy Olyphant, we get no real insight into the character. Timothy appears quite incapable of registering much emotion. Maybe this was a directorial choice, if so, it was a bad one. When Garner reveals herself, they just look at each other like they are trying to figure out why the writer/director even inserted this scene. Failing to find a logical answer, Garner departs. Cue music.Garner later moves in with two other friends of her dead hubby-to-be, the underused Sam Jaeger and horribly miscast Kevin Smith. Apparently, there was another directorial/writer choice to have Kevin eating or drinking something in almost every scene he appears in. Morbid obesity is funny isn't it? Naturally Timothy Olyphant moves in for awhile too. His prior actions at the funeral are dismissed because he's from L.A. and works in the entertainment industry. Guess that was supposed to be funny and a dig at the world that unleashed this movie on an unsuspecting public. Garner doesn't believe he cares that his friend died at all, and we, the hapless viewers, are forced to concur after witnessing his every action while in the house. So naturally, because this is a poorly written excuse for a rom-com, Garner ends up in bed with him, accompanied by another musical interlude. What the hell? But it's okay, because it turns out that Tim really is grieving his friend's loss. How do we know? Because the writer has been kind enough to give him a line saying ""I miss him too"". Great, that explains why he banged a caterer, and then his deceased ""friend's"" fianc&eacute; a week later. Makes perfect sense to me. Oh, and he's from L.A. of course.There are numerous other scenes where characters are unable to talk to one another like real human beings, instead they stare at one another ""meaningfully"" (or not, with this direction it's difficult to tell), or simply wander off during the pseudo-conversation, while the director cues up another syrupy, breathy voiced soft-rock ballad to show how much each character is hurting. Yecchhh.Later in the film, another twist is revealed in the form of massage therapist Juliette Lewis in a blond bimbo wig, with a child. Surprise! The kid may be the late fianc&eacute;'s. And let's turn the fianc&eacute;'s mom into a villainess (albeit temporarily; remember this is a badly written film, we know she'll come around by the end of the flick for a heartwarming conclusion with more elevator music swelling), who gets to snarl that the child will never see a penny of her late son's money. Grrrrr.I felt bad for most of the actors, they can do better. If Jennifer Garner ever gets a good part (let's all try to forget Elektra), she could be on her way to a real career. Sam Jaeger also seems very likable and it would be nice to see him in a better written part. The twist he is involved in late in the film is simply a throwaway that goes absolutely nowhere. The woman playing the mother also has some dignity about her, though the writing tries to crush that. And Juliette Lewis, well, what the hell has happened to her career? Kevin Smith needs to stick to the View Askew universe, he really can't act outside it. It's a real shame that this movie obviously had these talents, and a decent budget, and one good song which plays near the end (Death Cab For Cutie), but couldn't find anything better to do with them.The end of the film devolves into a feel good stew of stupidity as Kevin hooks up with Juliette, Jennifer runs to L.A. to hook up with Tim (leaving poor Sam behind, in the real world she would have and should have chosen him), and the mom gives Juliette money because her son would have wanted it that way. Don't slip in my vomit. In more capable hands, this could have been an affecting and honest drama, or a deft black comedy, instead of this mush of misplaced romance and fluctuating tones, all set to music.Hopefully this is the last film from this writer director I will ever have to suffer through.",2,Throw It Back!,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,5201,"['****', 'Warning', 'Major', 'Spoilers', 'Review', '****This', 'kind',

649532,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPF3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 10]","Jennifer Garner is one of the great weepers of her generation.  She cried more on ""Alias"" than any secret agent in the history of secret agents if not more than all of the other secret agents in history put together (All those times you have seen James Bond shaken if not stirred have you ever seen him cry?).  No matter how illogical it was that a secret agent would be weeping in the middle of an assignment, when Garner gets going it is always affective and at the start of ""Catch and Release"" her character, Gray Wheeler, has good reason to be crying.  At his bachelor's party her fiance did something risky and got himself killed, so on her wedding day she is wearing black and crying because nobody remembered to stop the florist from delivering flowers for the wedding that has become a funeral.The strange thing about Gray's situation is that the only friends and family that are surrounding her during this horrible time are those of her dead fiance.  He had two really good friends, Dennis (Sam Jaeger) and Sam (Kevin Smith), and because she cannot afford the rent in her new home she moves in with them.  To be clear, Dennis and Sam are really good friends to Gray, but it strikes me as rather strange that she does not have any gal pals around.  Also on the scene is Fritz (Timothy Olyphant, whose eyes sure look different when he is not playing Seth Bullock on ""Deadwood""), whose role in the film is clear since he appears second in the billing.  In addition to the fact that Gray's life has exploded in her face, Fritz immediately dig himself a big hole before she even sees his face for the first time in the film, and then he adds a basement to it before finding time to do a storm cellar before continuing to tunnel towards China.  You have to ask yourself why on earth Fritz is hanging around where he clearly is not wanted?Writer-director Susannah Grant, who did the screenplays for ""Ever After"" and ""In Her Shoes,"" has an answer to that question as insult gets added to injury as Gray's dead fiance continues to unravel her happily ever after from beyond the grave.  One of the strengths of the story is that while Dennis and Sam are trying to support Gray in her hour of need, they have their own problems because of the death of their friend, and she is compelled to provide some support in return.  The title of the film comes into play when Gray, rebelling against the idea that she is ""perfect,"" confesses to a string of imperfects and holds forth on why catch and release fishermen are not good people.  This theory throws into question what is happening in this film since clearly Gray would be the fisherman and Fritz the catch.Watching this film this afternoon was strange because the film was enjoyable, Garner and Olyphant have chemistry, Smith has some nice funny moments, there were some interesting aspects to the situation, and yet in the end it was not a fulfilling experience.  I was willing to round up on ""Catch and Release"" because it was an enjoyable enough afternoon, but unfortunately neither my wife nor I cried at the end of the movie and what is the point of a romantic comedy if you are not crying when the credits start to role?  If there is one thing that Cameron Crowe has taught us it is that you need either a great line (e.g., ""You had me at hello"") or a great visual image (e.g., holding a boom box over your head) to seal the deal.  The end game of this early 2007 release has neither and just proceeds to the requisite happy ending because that is what is required.  A romance that has Jennifer Garner crying at the start should have me in tears by the end, or at least cheering, and this one provoked neither response.",3,This romantic comedy reduced Jennifer Garner to tears but not us,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,3675,"['Jennifer', 'Garner', 'one', 'great', 'weepers', 'generation', 'cried', 'more', 'Alias', 'secret', 'agent', 'history', 'secret', 'agents', 'not', 'more', 'other', 'secret', 'agents', 'history', 'put', 'together', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'James', 'Bond', 'shaken', 'not', 'stirred', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'cry', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'illogical', 'was', 'secret', 'agent', 'would', 'be', 'weeping', 'middle', 'assignment', 'when', 'Garner', 'going', 'always', 'affective', 'start', 'Catch', 'Release', 'character', 'Gray', 'Wheeler', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'crying', 'bachelor', 'party', 'fiance', 'did', 'something', 'risky', 'got', 'killed', 'so', 'wedding', 'day', 'wearing', 'black', 'crying', 'nobody', 'remembered', 'stop', 'florist', 'delivering', 'flowers', 'wedding', 'become', 'funeral.The', 'strange', 'thing', 'Gray', 'situation', 'only', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'surrounding', 'horrible', 'time', 'are', 'dead', 'fiance', 'had', 'two', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'Dennis', 'Sam', 'Jaeger', 'Sam', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'rent', 'new', 'home', 'be', 'clear', 'Dennis', 'Sam', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'Gray', 'rather', 'strange', 'not', 'have', 'gal', 'pals', 'Also', 'scene', 'Fritz', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'eyes', 'sure', 'look', 'different', 'when', 'not', 'playing', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'Deadwood', 'role', 'film', 'clear', 'second', 'billing', 'addition', 'fact', 'Gray', 'life', 'exploded', 'face', 'Fritz', 'immediately', 'big', 'hole', 'even', 'face', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'then', 'basement', 'finding', 'time', 'do', 'storm', 'cellar', 'continuing', 'tunnel', 'towards', 'China', 'have', 'ask', 'why', 'earth', 'Fritz', 'hanging', 'around', 'where', 'clearly', 'not', 'wanted', 'Writer-director', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'who', 'did', 'screenplays', 'Ever', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'answer', 'question', 'insult', 'added', 'injury', 'Gray', 'dead', 'fiance', 'unravel', 'happily', 'ever', 'grave', 'One', 'strengths', 'story', 'Dennis', 'Sam', 'are', 'trying', 'support', 'Gray', 'hour', 'need', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'death', 'friend', 'compelled', 'provide', 'support', 'return', 'title', 'film', 'play', 'when', 'Gray', 'rebelling', 'idea', 'perfect', 'string', 'imperfects', 'forth', 'why', 'catch', 'release', 'fishermen', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'people', 'theory', 'question', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'clearly', 'Gray', 'would', 'be', 'fisherman', 'Fritz', 'catch.Watching', 'film', 'afternoon', 'was', 'strange', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'Garner', 'Olyphant', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Smith', 'nice', 'funny', 'moments', 'were', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'situation', 'yet', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'fulfilling', 'experience', 'was', 'willing', 'round', 'up', 'Catch', 'Release', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'afternoon', 'unfortunately', 'wife', 'cried', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'point', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'are', 'not', 'crying', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'role', 'one', 'thing', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'taught', 'need', 'great', 'line', 'e.g.', 'had', 'hello', 'great', 'visual', 'image', 'e.g.', 'holding', 'boom', 'box', 'head', 'seal', 'deal', 'end', 'game', 'early', '2007', 'release', 'just', 'proceeds', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending', 'what', 'required', 'romance', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'crying', 'start', 'should', 'have', 'tears', 'end', 'least', 'cheering', 'one', 'provoked', 'response']",N/A

It's disappointing, then (albeit not surprising) that she is also the creative mind behind this cheery failure of a film.I say it's not surprising, because ""Catch and Release"" sashays about in pastel prettiness to the same cutesy beat that thrummed behind those other, better films, the only difference being that those films actually had intriguing characters, powerful plot lines, and moments of real emotional impact.  What does ""Catch and Release"" have?  Kevin Smith.  Spouting trite wisdom which he reads off of boxes of herbal tea.Okay.  It has more than that.  It has Jennifer Garner, a woman who is virtually impossible not to like.  She plays the lead, Gray Wheeler, a poor lass whose fiance has ingraciously kicked the bucket (in an irritatingly vague way) days before the wedding.  Now comes the time of healing.  The time for friends to cheer her up with watery platitudes.  The time for fly fishing.Wheeler is supposed to be another tormented feminine protagonist, a woman whose strengths gradually reveal themselves through the bedrock of her turmoils, like tender green shoots pushing past cracked sidewalk.  Brockovich had to fight against a heartless company and about ten glass ceilings.  Bullock's Gwen valiantly battled alcoholism and a selfish enabler of a boyfriend.What must Wheeler battle?  Secrets.  Her dead beau, apparantly, had a few.  And guess what?  They are boring.  And unoriginal.  (No, he wasn't an undercover agent for SD6.  Nor gay.  Nor a superhero.)  Also, because Wheeler's dead-hubby-to-be is a non-entity in the film, it's virtually impossible to care about his secrets and how they impact Ms. Wheeler.  The task is made even more difficult by the ambiguous mourning statements made by everyone which do little to show us what kind of man the deceased was, and just what he meant to everyone.In the meantime, Wheeler hangs out a lot with her male friends, one of whom is sweet and has been pining for her since day one, and one of whom is a bad-boy-by-proxy (he has sex during the funeral!).  Guess which one she ends up with?Oops.  Did I ruin the movie?  No, I did not.  And that's the sad part.  Instead of being about Wheeler's recovery from the traumatic loss of her lover and the slightly-less-traumatic discovery of his secrets, this movie is all about Wheeler bagging another man.

""BobTheCopywriter""","[54, 63]","Okay, most of the time a film tries to be part comedy, part drama and part buddy picture, what it ends up being is a total wreck! Catch and Release beats the odds by being all the above while avoiding total wreck status. It's that rarest of things, a film that reveals you don't have to be married or be blood to grieve for somone you love and how many emotions grieving can reveal... including humor.There is that chick-flick quality that will have guys begging off, but fortunately for me Kevin Smith acting in a film he didn't direct was enough to convince me to go. The man can actually act, and not just in his own films. Unlike other films where a nonactor tries to step up, Kevin Smith was not a blank space on the screen. He held his own and then some. There's even a certain degree of self parody of his profound-statement-delivering Silent Bob charater.Moving on from Kevin, everyone else also did an excellent job. Jennifer Garner (Alias), Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood), Julliette Lewis, Sam Jaeger, Fiona Shaw and everyone else turned in strong performances as people trying to come to terms with the grief of losing a best friend, a fiancee, a provider and a son.I found myself laughing at the horrible yet comic realism.From what I understand this is Susannah Grants major motion picture directorial debut, but it didn't feel like it. Already an extremely well proven screen writer, this may be Susannah's first movie directing job, but with this many laughs and this much emotion, I know it won't be her last.",4,"Surprise, grief can be funny & Kevin Smith can ACT!",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1522,"['Okay', 'most', 'time', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'drama', 'part', 'buddy', 'picture', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'total', 'wreck', 'Catch', 'Release', 'odds', 'being', 'above', 'avoiding', 'total', 'wreck', 'status', 'rarest', 'things', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'married', 'be', 'blood', 'grieve', 'somone', 'love', 'how', 'many', 'emotions', 'grieving', 'can', 'reveal', 'including', 'humor.There', 'chick-flick', 'quality', 'will', 'have', 'guys', 'begging', 'off', 'fortunately', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'acting', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'was', 'enough', 'convince', 'go', 'man', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'not', 'just', 'own', 'films', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'nonactor', 'step', 'up', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'not', 'blank', 'space', 'screen', 'held', 'own', 'then', 'even', 'certain', 'degree', 'self', 'parody', 'profound-statement-delivering', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'charater.Moving', 'Kevin', 'everyone', 'else', 'also', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Alias', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Deadwood', 'Julliette', 'Lewis', 'Sam', 'Jaeger', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'everyone', 'else', 'turned', 'strong', 'performances', 'people', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'grief', 'losing', 'best', 'friend', 'fiancee', 'provider', 'son.I', 'found', 'laughing', 'horrible', 'yet', 'comic', 'realism.From', 'what', 'understand', 'Susannah', 'Grants', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'directorial', 'debut', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Already', 'extremely', 'well', 'proven', 'screen', 'writer', 'may', 'be', 'Susannah', 'first', 'movie', 'directing', 'job', 'many', 'laughs', 'much', 'emotion', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last']",N/A
649562,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPF3,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 8]","**1/2The romantic comedy, ""Catch and Release,"" written and directed by Susannah Grant, isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is too bound up in stereotypes and conventional thinking to register much of an impact on the viewer.  In a weird sort of inverse formula, the harder the movie strives to be unconventional and daring, the more tame and ordinary it becomes.The problems begin early on with a premise that feels woefully contrived and manufactured from the get-go.  The appropriately named ""Gray"" Wheeler is a bride-to-be whose fiance, Grady,  is killed in some sort of boating accident literally on the eve of her wedding, which, with remarkable practicality, is quickly converted into a funeral.  Gray is forced to pick up the pieces of her shattered life with the help of her fiance's three emotionally underdeveloped buddies, one of whom she stumbles upon having sex with one of the caterers at the dead friend's reception.  Despite Gray's initial revulsion at the callousness of his actions, the romantic comedy formula makes it imperative for her to eventually fall in love with Fritz, an action that is made less objectionable by the fact that Grady had been harboring some deep dark secrets from his intended wife, including the existence of a son he never told her he had.  The storyline, too clever by half even at the outset, has a gimmicky quality that, try as it might, the movie is never quite able to overcome.""Catch and Release"" does have some good things going for it.  The fresh and novel Boulder, Colorado setting provides a lush and colorful backdrop for the story, and Jennifer Garner has a sexy girl-next-door quality that almost compensates for the bland passivity of her character.  Unfortunately, Timothy Olyphant makes for a rather innocuous love interest as the initially callow Fritz, while the surrounding players emerge as little more than underdeveloped stereotypes thrown in for grinding plot purposes and/or tepid comic relief.  Moreover, the screenplay relies too heavily on musical montage sequences to carry the emotional weight of the piece, when what we really need is for the characters themselves to be performing that task.The movie also makes a key strategic miscalculation by not showing us Grady before his death, the consequence of which is that we never get a true sense of the void he has left in the lives of those who loved him.  Since we are forced to accept this void on faith, the movie is unable to generate the emotional impact it might otherwise have had on us.Well-meaning and relatively intelligent as far as romantic comedies go, ""Catch and Release"" wants desperately to rise above the confines of its genre, but it never finds a way to cut itself loose from its moorings.  It ultimately chooses to play it safe rather than taking a chance at being daring, and thereby ruins its chances of soaring much above the ordinary.",2,never achieves the realism it strives for,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,2907,"['**1/2The', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Catch', 'Release', 'written', 'directed', 'Susannah', 'Grant', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'too', 'bound', 'up', 'stereotypes', 'conventional', 'thinking', 'register', 'much', 'impact', 'viewer', 'weird', 'sort', 'inverse', 'formula', 'harder', 'movie', 'be', 'unconventional', 'daring', 'more', 'tame', 'ordinary', 'problems', 'begin', 'early', 'premise', 'woefully', 'contrived', 'manufactured', 'get-go', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Gray', 'Wheeler', 'bride-to-be', 'fiance', 'Grady', 'killed', 'sort', 'boating', 'accident', 'literally', 'eve', 'wedding', 'remarkable', 'practicality', 'quickly', 'converted', 'funeral', 'Gray', 'forced', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'shattered', 'life', 'help', 'fiance', 'three', 'emotionally', 'underdeveloped', 'buddies', 'one', 'whom', 'having', 'sex', 'one', 'caterers', 'dead', 'friend', 'reception', 'Gray', 'initial', 'revulsion', 'callousness', 'actions', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula', 'imperative', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'Fritz', 'action', 'made', 'less', 'objectionable', 'fact', 'Grady', 'had', 'been', 'harboring', 'deep', 'dark', 'secrets', 'intended', 'wife', 'including', 'existence', 'son', 'never', 'told', 'had', 'storyline', 'too', 'clever', 'half', 'even', 'outset', 'gimmicky', 'quality', 'try', 'might', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'able', 'overcome', 'Catch', 'Release', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'fresh', 'novel', 'Boulder', 'Colorado', 'setting', 'lush', 'colorful', 'backdrop', 'story', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'sexy', 'girl-next-door', 'quality', 'almost', 'compensates', 'bland', 'passivity', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'rather', 'innocuous', 'love', 'interest', 'initially', 'callow', 'Fritz', 'surrounding', 'players', 'emerge', 'little', 'more', 'underdeveloped', 'stereotypes', 'thrown', 'grinding', 'plot', 'purposes', 'and/or', 'tepid', 'comic', 'relief', 'Moreover', 'screenplay', 'too', 'heavily', 'musical', 'montage', 'sequences', 'carry', 'emotional', 'weight', 'piece', 'when', 'what', 'really', 'need', 'characters', 'be', 'performing', 'task.The', 'movie', 'also', 'key', 'strategic', 'miscalculation', 'not', 'showing', 'Grady', 'death', 'consequence', 'never', 'get', 'true', 'sense', 'void', 'left', 'lives', 'who', 'loved', 'are', 'forced', 'accept', 'void', 'faith', 'movie', 'unable', 'generate', 'emotional', 'impact', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'had', 'us.Well-meaning', 'relatively', 'intelligent', 'as', 'far', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'Catch', 'Release', 'desperately', 'rise', 'confines', 'genre', 'never', 'way', 'cut', 'loose', 'moorings', 'ultimately', 'play', 'safe', 'rather', 'taking', 'chance', 'being', 'daring', 'thereby', 'chances', 'soaring', 'much', 'ordinary']",N/A

I have to say that it doesn't actually do any of those categories justice at all.What it is about:  Gray (Jennifer Garner) has just lost her fianc&eacute; to some sort of accident days before their wedding.  She has no money so she moves in with her fianc&eacute;s 2 best friends Sam (Kevin smith) and Dennis (Sam Jaeger).  One of her fianc&eacute;s childhood friends from LA Fritz (Timothy Olyphant) arrives for the funeral and also moves in staying for some indefinite amount of time.  Days following the funeral Gray learns that her fianc&eacute; has a child and that he had been cheating on her.  This leads Gray into a new romance with Fritz.What is good about it:I have to admit that there were a number of times I was about to cry during this movie.  When Gray learns about her fianc&eacute;s betrayal, when she learns about the depth of his betrayal, and when her almost mother-in-law makes some incredibly tacky moves --- I have to say Jennifer Garner does the wounded look quiet well.  The pain she feels is real and I think it translates well to the audience.Kevin Smith was also very funny in the film.  I think he acted like himself but it was still a good performance.  His screen time was basically the comic relief of the film.Julliete Lewis also does a superb job as the quirky massage therapist Chinese method studying grass eating Californian.What is bad about it:It just didn't feel right.  The way Gray moves on to Fritz and so soon...I just wasn't feeling it.  I thought they were good together and I can see how she would be attracted to him but right away?  It doesn't make sense.  Also there was a lot of cavalier treatment about grief and depression which was blown off by the characters in this movie.  And where are Gray's friends?  Are her only friends her fianc&eacute;s friends?  There was just a lot of holes in the movie that distracted me from enjoying the film.Conclusion:If you are looking for a romantic comedy this really isn't the movie for you -- it is more sad then funny. Despite the fact that this movie doesn't fit any category the acting is great and the story is compelling.  However the holes in the movie are very distracting and take away from the film.  If you can just let it go you will enjoy the movie a lot.  If you don't think you can let that go you might want to wait for the DVD before seeing this movie.",3,Catch on Dvd,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,2472,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Catch', 'Release', 'trying', 'be', 'chick', 'flick', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romance', 'drama', 'have', 'say', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'categories', 'justice', 'Gray', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'just', 'lost', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'sort', 'accident', 'days', 'wedding', 'money', 'so', 'fianc', 'eacute', '2', 'best', 'friends', 'Sam', 'Kevin', 'smith', 'Dennis', 'Sam', 'Jaeger', 'One', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'childhood', 'friends', 'LA', 'Fritz', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'funeral', 'also', 'moves', 'staying', 'indefinite', 'amount', 'time', 'following', 'funeral', 'Gray', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'child', 'had', 'been', 'cheating', 'Gray', 'new', 'romance', 'Fritz.What', 'good', 'have', 'admit', 'were', 'number', 'times', 'was', 'about', 'cry', 'movie', 'When', 'Gray', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'betrayal', 'when', 'depth', 'betrayal', 'when', 'almost', 'mother-in-law', 'incredibly', 'tacky', 'moves', 'have', 'say', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'wounded', 'look', 'quiet', 'well', 'pain', 'real', 'think', 'well', 'audience.Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'think', 'acted', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'performance', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'basically', 'comic', 'relief', 'film.Julliete', 'Lewis', 'also', 'superb', 'job', 'quirky', 'massage', 'therapist', 'Chinese', 'method', 'studying', 'grass', 'eating', 'Californian.What', 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'way', 'Gray', 'Fritz', 'so', 'soon', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'thought', 'were', 'good', 'together', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'right', 'away', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Also', 'was', 'lot', 'cavalier', 'treatment', 'grief', 'depression', 'was', 'blown', 'off', 'characters', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'Gray', 'friends', 'Are', 'only', 'fianc', 'eacute', 's', 'friends', 'was', 'just', 'lot', 'holes', 'movie', 'distracted', 'enjoying', 'film.Conclusion', 'are', 'looking', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'really', ""n't"", 'movie', 'more', 'sad', 'then', 'funny', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fit', 'category', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'compelling', 'However', 'holes', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'distracting', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'can', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'let', 'go', 'might', 'want', 'wait', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'movie']",N/A

649573,A2CZXIEBCR4YCY,B00005JPF3,The Opinionista,"[4, 5]","I expected this movie to be another light romantic comedy and was quite surprised by it.The movie is deeper than one expects dealing with loss, grief, love, and finding oneself.I thought most of  the performances were excellent especially those by Kevin Smith as Sam, and Juliette Lewis.  I have never seen Kevin Smith in anything else, but he gives a touching, warm performance; possibly the best acting in the film.The actor who plays Fritz was one of the flaws of the movie, I thought he was lightweight or superficial.  Another reviewer mentioned he has a Pepsodent smile, but I would go farther and say his whole performance was like a Pepsodent commercial.Some reviewers have criticized the speed of the relationship between Gray and Fritz.  I was not shocked by it because I think that there was already an underlying problem in Gray and Grady's relationship.  The fact that it takes them 6 years to tie the knot in the absence of health or financial problems, indicates there was some kind of commitment issue.  This is confirmed by Grady's parallel relationship with Juliette Lewis' character.  Gray turns to Fritz out of grief for Grady's loss, and anger over the realization that she really did not know him; she also discovers the force of a new love; discovers feelings that she no longer felt for Grady, possibly passion.  Listen well to her monologue to Grady during the garden ceremony.  It is very telling.Other reviewers have criticized the fact the we never see Grady and that this takes away from the story.  Perhaps it would have been better to have a more defined image of Grady.  I think this was an artistic decision to really focus the story on Gray and Grady's friends.  I was not too disturbed by it.I give this movie 4 stars because I would have wanted to see a better Fritz.  It would have given more weight to the movie; and also there are some holes in the movie like Gray's family and friends (totally non-existent).But all in all it's worth catching.....and keeping.",4,A Nice Catch,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,1999,"['expected', 'movie', 'be', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'it.The', 'movie', 'deeper', 'one', 'dealing', 'loss', 'grief', 'love', 'finding', 'oneself.I', 'thought', 'most', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Sam', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'anything', 'else', 'touching', 'warm', 'performance', 'possibly', 'best', 'acting', 'film.The', 'actor', 'who', 'Fritz', 'was', 'one', 'flaws', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'lightweight', 'superficial', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'Pepsodent', 'smile', 'would', 'go', 'farther', 'say', 'whole', 'performance', 'was', 'Pepsodent', 'commercial.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'speed', 'relationship', 'Gray', 'Fritz', 'was', 'not', 'shocked', 'think', 'was', 'already', 'underlying', 'problem', 'Gray', 'Grady', 'relationship', 'fact', '6', 'years', 'tie', 'knot', 'absence', 'health', 'financial', 'problems', 'was', 'kind', 'commitment', 'issue', 'confirmed', 'Grady', 'parallel', 'relationship', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'character', 'Gray', 'Fritz', 'grief', 'Grady', 'loss', 'anger', 'realization', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'also', 'force', 'new', 'love', 'discovers', 'feelings', 'no', 'longer', 'felt', 'Grady', 'possibly', 'passion', 'Listen', 'well', 'monologue', 'Grady', 'garden', 'ceremony', 'very', 'telling.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'Grady', 'away', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'more', 'defined', 'image', 'Grady', 'think', 'was', 'artistic', 'decision', 'really', 'focus', 'story', 'Gray', 'Grady', 'friends', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'disturbed', 'it.I', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'better', 'Fritz', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'weight', 'movie', 'also', 'are', 'holes', 'movie', 'Gray', 'family', 'friends', 'totally', 'non-existent', '.But', 'worth', 'catching', '..and', 'keeping']",N/A
649574,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPF3,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[12, 16]","""Catch and Release"", the new romantic comedy starring Jennifer Garner, Timothy Olyphant, Juliette Lewis and Kevin Smith is a pleasant surprise. January is generally the time of year many studios tend to do two things; they dump films they don't have confidence in and know are terrible, trying to earn a few bucks before the inevitable DVD release and they also open Oscar contenders in wider release. As a movie fan who lives in Los Angeles, where Oscar contenders are released in December, January is a wasteland for filmgoers. So, it was a very pleasant surprise to see ""Catch and Release"", a new, very well-made romantic comedy.Gray (Jennifer Garner) mourns the death of her fiancee on the day she was supposed to be married. As she stands among the group of friends and family wishing her and her once and future mother-in-law (Fiona Shaw) their condolences, she watches a delivery truck deliver the flowers for her now cancelled wedding. Feeling claustrophobic, she retreats to the bathroom and hides in the tub, closing the shower curtain. A few moments later, Fritz (Timothy Olyphant), one of her fiancee's friends, a movie director from Hollywood, rushes into the bathroom with a girl and they proceed to have sex, unaware of Gray's presence. As Fritz basks in the afterglow, she appears and stares at him with disgust. Later, she finds Fritz is rooming with Dennis (Sam Jaeger) and Sam (Kevin Smith), her fiancee's roommates and business partner, reluctant to return to Hollywood after a movie deal fell through. Unable to afford the rent on her new apartment, she moves in to her boyfriend's room. Soon, Gray begins to learn things about her fiancee that she didn't know. Maureen (Juliette Lewis), a massage therapist from Los Angeles, with a small son, arrives looking for the deceased; he is the father of her child and she is curious why his monthly support check has stopped. All of these people come together to form an uneasy relationship, helping each other cope with the loss of their friend. As the days pass, Gray and Fritz begin to run into each other and begin spending time together. But Gray is reluctant to call it a relationship and let Sam and Dennis know they are a couple.Writer/ Director Susannah Grant, whose previous credits as a writer include ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Pocahontas"", creates a richly detailed look at these people's lives. As a premiere directorial effort, she shows a lot of natural talent. The film occasionally veers a little too much into sitcom territory, but overall, ""Catch"" is a remarkably well-made romantic comedy.Pretty much everything that works in this film is something that shouldn't or wouldn't work in the hands of a less talented director. Grant gets a lot of credit for using some of these things and and making them work. As the film begins, we see Gray (Garner) standing in the middle of a crowded room, watching other people try to give solace to her once and future mother-in-law (Shaw) and she watches people approach her in dread, clearly uncomfortable. These images are probably enough, but Grant has Garner provide some voice over further illuminating the character's feelings and thoughts. The voice over works; in a few short moments, we come to know quite a bit about her. Throughout ""Catch"" the voice over returns occasionally, helping to provide more information throughout the story. As we meet the individual characters, we should like some of them and dislike others. Grant does a better job than that, providing each character with both good and bad character traits. In other words, many of the characters are more human because of this. These characters come alive and seem more like someone you might meet on the street.Garner does a very good job of portraying Gray. As a young woman who now has found her life has completely changed course, she is naturally going through a rough time. As we watch this journey, Garner brings both Gray's good qualities and bad qualities to life. She clearly cared for her dead fiancee, but also cares for her friends and tries to help them cope as she tries to cope with the loss. When she finds out about Maureen (Lewis), she is initially shocked, angered and confused. But when she meets the woman and sees her son, she begins to realize she can't completely shut them out of her life, for her fiancee's sake, because they are inexplicably intertwined. The relationship with Fritz also builds naturally. Gray and Fritz basically run into each other as each goes through their day. They hang around a bit, get to know each other and start looking for ways to hang out together.As she gets to know this man she once disliked, she learns about his good qualities and they share a relationship. But she wants to keep it a secret. How can she let Sam and Dennis know she is in a relationship with another one of their friends, so soon after her fiancee died? Throughout the film, Garner gives Gray little nuances which help her seem like a real woman.Timothy Olyphant is also very good as Fritz, the film director who has returned to Boulder and decides to stick around for a while after his next film project falls through. He has no reason to rush home. His character starts out as a less than likable figure, but over the course of the film, he rediscovers a love of photography and begins to take pictures of his friends, appreciating them with a new eye. As Gray begins to learn about Maureen, Fritz tries to protect her from the truth, something that ends up backfiring on him. As their relationship builds, it is nice to see the feelings he has for Gray intensify, so much so that he is hurt when she continues to try to keep their relationship a secret.Dennis (Jaeger) and Sam (Smith) provide a sort of yin and yang chorus to all of the other craziness in their lives. Dennis is the fiancee's business partner, roommate and friend. They own a fly fishing expedition company and in fact, Gray's fiancee died on such a trip, his bachelor trip, days before the wedding. Jaeger does a better job of creating a real personality for his character. He is clearly distraught by the death of his friend and business partner, but is also conflicted by Gray's next choice. During the story, Dennis makes an ill fated attempt to date a girl who is more of a replacement for the real love of his life, someone he can't have. Smith plays Sam, the portly friend who seems to have little direction in life. Smith appears in a bathrobe and t-shirt through much of the film and also seems to have been directed to try to inject some humorous moments throughout and these veer a little too far into sitcom territory. An episode with a blender and a waffle iron seems plucked out of a bad ""Three's Company"" episode. This wouldn't matter in a more typical comedy, but in ""Catch"", the remainder of the characters are much more realistic, so he seems out of place.Juliette Lewis plays Maureen, a massage therapist from Los Angeles who has a love child with Gray's former fiancee. I have never been a huge fan of Lewis, but Maureen is a very well-rounded character. When she arrives in Boulder, she has no idea about the death everyone else is dealing with, she is simply looking for her son's father, to see why he has stopped sending the support money he used to send. As she learns about the situation, Sam and Dennis become more involved in her life, because she is hanging around and needs some help with her son. She also knows Fritz, who lives in Los Angeles, and knew about their affair. She becomes a reluctant member of the group and fits into the oddball assortment well.In so many romantic comedies, the writer's go to painstaking lengths to think of witty things for the characters to say and the lines are delivered with all the subtlety of a stand up comedian backed by a drummer with cymbal crashes. Grant has created some great dialogue, but she directs the cast to be more natural. For instance, when Gray and Fritz are walking around, Fritz says ""I owe you an apology"". ""Just one?"". ""For the funeral"". Gray responds ""Yeah, if it hadn't been for you, that would've been one great day."" This is good dialogue and it works even more because of the delivery from the actors.""Catch and Release"" is a surprisingly good romantic comedy. The relationship builds in a realistic way and the twists and turns seem natural and believable. How many romantic comedies can we say that about? How many films released in January can we say that about?Not many.",4,A Surprisingly Good Romantic Comedy.,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,8465,"['Catch', 'Release', 'new', 'romantic', 'comedy',

While this was a far better chick flick than many other movies my wife has chosen, and there were some touching scenes, there were several things that bugged me ...WHAT I LIKED:1. While I'm a big fan of Jay and Silent Bob, their vulgarity can get a little wearisome. Kevin Smith has some hilarious--without profanity!-- moments in this picture! Even my wife, who was found Dogma revolting, found Kevin funny in this movie (Kevin, if ya read this, keep going for the supporting humorous roles ... you're awesome!)2. Jennifer Garner is developing herself as an actress ... she seems to get better each movie I see her in.3. The scenery. Loved the mountains and the river.OKAY .... AND NOW ...WHAT BUGGED ME.1. Timothy Olyphant looks too much like Billy Bob Thornton's son for me ... found that rather distracting. Plus, his chacter seemed to be in a fantasy-land ... ""oh, I've got all the money in the world, and I can take off as much time from work as I want"". I'm okay with characters being somewhat unrealistic in these chick flicks, but this was too much ...2. Okay, their romance was FAR TOO fast. Her fiance just died! Gimme a break! If the gender's were reversed, and it was the female that died, and the guy hopped into a relationship that fast, critics would be screaming ""Men!"" ... and all the characters in the movie would run around analyzing the guy by telling him he's in a rebound relationship that means nothing, etc, etc.3. Where's Grady?!? No flashbacks, no nothing that would give us reason why these people connected with him so deeply.4. What's up with the unrequited love subplot between Sam Jaeger's and Garner's character? That made no sense, never really resolved itself, added little to the storyline ... should have been deleted. Plus, Garner's character throwing herself at Mr. Filthy Rich (see #1, above) seemingly arbitrarily over Jaeger's character made her look like a gold digger.5.Juliette Lewis' charcter was fingernails-on-a-chalkboard annoying. I would have chosen anyone other than her to play that role.6. Does Garner's character have other friends? Is she such a wallflower that she has to move in with her fiance's roomates?

I am probably the only one to blame for picking it up without reading comments first. Man is the only animal who stumbles over and over again on the same stone they say...The bad things about this film ? Slow, predictable, not even funny except for three or four dialogs towards the last third of the film (yeah, you have to bear with the first 2/3 for that). The actors are not too credible in their roles. Personally, the ones I found the most annoying are Kevin Smith, for whom you feel pity at times, but also becomes irritating with his silly stunts and his ""sans-Gene"", and the L.A. playboy, who eventually ""gets the chick"". That one really was an annoyance, with his ""cool"" mimics and his forced pepsodent smile, all around the film.

The L.A. playboy lives in a nice house on the pacific coast, but apparently is nothing but a bum and spends his time with his pepsodent/crest smile (oh I already mentioned that didn't I ?) playing with his dog and taking pictures of the occupants of the house. The mother of Garner's fiance is rich and doesn't do anything. The other guy living in the house doesn't seem to have a job either. This gives an overall sensation of unreal, and probably contributes to the slowness of the action.Now to the good parts: If you like Jennifer Garner (or Julia Roberts, if not watch ""Mystic Pizza""), you'll be delighted. She has the starring role.  And if you're into fairy tales (prince charming, Cinderella and such), you will enjoy the end of the film. The only guy that gets dumped all the way is the one that thought he could someday conquer Garner's heart...There are many better ways of spending almost two hours of your time. So I suppose you could just skip this one, unless you're a fan of Jennifer Garner or any of the other actors (?) in this pasty film.",2,Do any of these people EVER work ?,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,2106,"['other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'end', 'film', 'am', 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'blame', 'picking', 'reading', 'comments', 'first', 'Man', 'only', 'animal', 'who', 'over', 'again', 'same', 'stone', 'say', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'Slow', 'predictable', 'not', 'even', 'funny', 'three', 'four', 'dialogs', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'yeah', 'have', 'bear', 'first', '2/3', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'credible', 'roles', 'Personally', 'ones', 'found', 'most', 'annoying', 'are', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'whom', 'feel', 'pity', 'times', 'also', 'irritating', 'silly', 'stunts', 'sans-Gene', 'L.A.', 'playboy', 'who', 'eventually', 'chick', 'one', 'really', 'was', 'annoyance', 'cool', 'mimics', 'forced', 'pepsodent', 'smile', 'film', 'Oh', 'physical', 'therapist', 'was', 'also', 'pathetic.Another', 'thing', 'found', 'striking', 'was', 'nobody', 'film', 'really', 'worked', 'only', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'job', 'five', 'minutes', 'Same', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'others', 'Dunno', 'L.A.', 'playboy', 'nice', 'house', 'pacific', 'coast', 'apparently', 'nothing', 'bum', 'time', 'pepsodent/crest', 'smile', 'oh', 'already', 'mentioned', 'did', ""n't"", 'playing', 'dog', 'taking', 'pictures', 'occupants', 'house', 'mother', 'Garner', 'fiance', 'rich', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'guy', 'living', 'house', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'job', 'either', 'overall', 'sensation', 'unreal', 'probably', 'contributes', 'slowness', 'action.Now', 'good', 'parts', 'like', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'not', 'watch', 'Mystic', 'Pizza', ""'ll"", 'be', 'delighted', 'starring', 'role', ""'re"", 'fairy', 'tales', 'prince', 'charming', 'Cinderella', 'such', 'will', 'enjoy', 'end', 'film', 'only', 'guy', 'dumped', 'way', 'one', 'thought', 'could', 'someday', 'conquer', 'Garner', 'heart', 'are', 'many', 'better', 'ways', 'spending', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'So', 'suppose', 'could', 'just', 'skip', 'one', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'other', 'actors', 'pasty', 'film']",N/A
649580,ANOBZWKE25SBY,B00005JPF3,Tracy Vest,"[51, 63]","Gray (Jennifer Garner) thought that she and her fiance Grady would be getting married this weekend, but instead she's attending his funeral. Already destroyed at the loss of what could have been, she's devastated to learn that Grady had a secret life that he kept from her including a million dollar estate and a toddler love child. When the mother of said child comes looking for Grady, she must confront the past in order to have a future. Juliette Lewis gives her all as the slightly trampy quasi-Earth mother.As Gray comes to terms with his betrayal, she turns to his roommates for solace and a place to stay since she can no longer afford the house they were renting. Through this quasi-extended family, she discovers the Grady she never knew, as well as the Gray that she is now becoming, and finds herself getting closer to his lothario friend Fritz (Timothy Olyphant), as friends Sam and Dennis also experience difficulty dealing with the loss of their friend.Writer/director Susannah Grant, best known as the scribe behind ""Erin Brokovich"" and ""In Her Shoes,"" has created a poignant story of love, loss, and forgiveness. Kevin Smith shows a serious side as well as provides comic relief as Sam, the inspirational comment writer (okay, typist) for ""Constant Comment Teas."" Veteran British actress Fiona Shaw, hysterical as the horny headmistress of the tony boarding school in ""Three Men and a Little Lady,"" dons an American accent and gives a heartwarming performance of a mother who just wants her son back. And Juliette Lewis is a bit chiched in the role of flighty masseuse Maureen, who apparently doesn't own a pair of flat shoes.Though some might find the romance between Gray and Fritz develop a little too quickly, I thought it was handled tastefully given the love-hate relationship between them and how thin the line between the two can be (though the ending was a bit rushed). Missing from the film was Grady himself - a couple flashbacks with him would have added depth to the relationship between Gray and Grady and given us a chance to find out what made him such a touchstone for the five lead characters.The disc's special features are minimal - just lots of movie trailers and commentary - nothing to write home about.",4,Great date flick,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2243,"['Gray', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'thought', 'fiance', 'Grady', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'married', 'weekend', 'instead', 'attending', 'funeral', 'Already', 'destroyed', 'loss', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'devastated', 'learn', 'Grady', 'had', 'secret', 'life', 'kept', 'including', 'million', 'dollar', 'estate', 'toddler', 'love', 'child', 'When', 'mother', 'said', 'child', 'looking', 'Grady', 'must', 'confront', 'past', 'order', 'have', 'future', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'slightly', 'trampy', 'quasi-Earth', 'mother.As', 'Gray', 'terms', 'betrayal', 'roommates', 'solace', 'place', 'stay', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'afford', 'house', 'were', 'renting', 'quasi-extended', 'family', 'Grady', 'never', 'knew', 'as', 'well', 'Gray', 'now', 'becoming', 'getting', 'closer', 'lothario', 'friend', 'Fritz', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'friends', 'Sam', 'Dennis', 'also', 'experience', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'loss', 'friend.Writer/director', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'best', 'known', 'scribe', 'Erin', 'Brokovich', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'created', 'poignant', 'story', 'love', 'loss', 'forgiveness', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'serious', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'relief', 'Sam', 'inspirational', 'comment', 'writer', 'okay', 'typist', 'Constant', 'Comment', 'Teas', 'Veteran', 'British', 'actress', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'hysterical', 'horny', 'headmistress', 'tony', 'boarding', 'school', 'Three', 'Men', 'Little', 'Lady', 'American', 'accent', 'heartwarming', 'performance', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'son', 'back', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'bit', 'chiched', 'role', 'flighty', 'masseuse', 'Maureen', 'who', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'own', 'pair', 'flat', 'shoes.Though', 'might', 'find', 'romance', 'Gray', 'Fritz', 'develop', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'thought', 'was', 'handled', 'tastefully', 'given', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'how', 'thin', 'line', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'rushed', 'Missing', 'film', 'was', 'Grady', 'couple', 'flashbacks', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'depth', 'relationship', 'Gray', 'Grady', 'given', 'chance', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'made', 'touchstone', 'five', 'lead', 'characters.The', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'minimal', 'just', 'lots', 'movie', 'trailers', 'commentary', 'nothing', 'write', 'home']",N/A
