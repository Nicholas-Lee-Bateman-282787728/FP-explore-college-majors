1176822,ACYWXDA8A8OW1,B001CK7ONI,julian,"[0, 0]","To all the die-hard VeggieTales fans, this movie may be different from what you'd be expecting. This movie is pretty detached from the original VeggieTales formula, there aren't many elaborate musical numbers, no witty satire of biblical stories, there aren't even any religious references, like, at all. A very glaring detachment from what I expected.These changes seem to show Big Idea's effort to market the VeggieTales franchise to the mainstream theatrical audience. It very much shows in this regard, this is easily one of the more visually striking VeggieTales productions. The lighting effects, the cinematic angles, and the animations are all very aesthetically pleasing. Those looking for a religious movie for their children should looks elsewhere, there is none of that in this film.Unfortunately, the writing isn't as impressive as the movie's visuals or previous installments of the franchise. The movie stars the Pirates who don't do anything, a trio of insecure cabin boys who find themselves as unlikely heroes on an adventure; trying to overcome their doubts of their own self worth in the process. It's a story you've heard many times before; however, the story does beg to be mildly heartwarming at times thanks to the plight of the central Pirate(Who is NOT Larry by the way).I very much liked the Jonah movie better. That movie at least knew it's audience and what would please them and made it's movie accordingly,  so, while no masterpiece, jonah made for a much more memorable film.But with all it's shortcomings, I can't bring myself to hate this film. So, in the end, Pirates who don't do anything may be a forgettable movie, but it's a harmless one.

No, this one is about three vegetables who defy all odds to become heroes. In ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie.""George, Sedgewick (both Phil Vischer) and Elliot (Mike Nawrocki) were simple cabin boys working at a pirate-themed restaurant when they find a ball that sends them back in time to the 16th century. While there, they are told by a princess that they must save her brother from an evil pirate. Though they know they're not heroes, they accept and end up on an adventure of nutritious proportions.In this day of incredible computer-aided animation and scripts written to keep audiences laughing, it is easy to get caught up in the quality of the production and the non-stop barrage of jokes while losing sight of another objective that a good movie for kids might--or even should--attempt to achieve: communicating the value of virtues. It is rare that a movie can pull off all three, and I have to believe that effectively communicating values (without preaching) is the most difficult of the three.The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything comes close on all three counts. The animation is good, but it does not amaze. The story has moments of laughter and emotion, but you don't end up caring about many of the characters. And it makes it clear that doing the right thing and being willing to make sacrifices for others is important and worth the effort. In the end, kids will have been entertained while having important principles reinforced. This is truly a movie for kids from start to finish, rather than a cute story with mature humor thrown in from time to time to keep things interesting for parents who might not be able set their prurient interests aside for a couple of hours.Now if I could just get those freaky cheese curls off my mind...",4,VeggieTales is Cute and Entertaining Fun for the Whole Family,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,1887,"['Avast', 'ye', 'maties', 'be', 'tale', 'pirates', ""n't"", 'one', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'ones', 'now', 'No', 'one', 'three', 'vegetables', 'who', 'defy', 'odds', 'become', 'heroes', 'Pirates', 'Who', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Do', 'Anything', 'VeggieTales', 'Movie', 'George', 'Sedgewick', 'Phil', 'Vischer', 'Elliot', 'Mike', 'Nawrocki', 'were', 'simple', 'cabin', 'boys', 'working', 'pirate-themed', 'restaurant', 'when', 'find', 'ball', 'back', 'time', '16th', 'century', 'there', 'are', 'told', 'princess', 'must', 'save', 'brother', 'evil', 'pirate', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'heroes', 'accept', 'end', 'up', 'adventure', 'nutritious', 'proportions.In', 'day', 'incredible', 'computer-aided', 'animation', 'scripts', 'written', 'keep', 'audiences', 'laughing', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'quality', 'production', 'non-stop', 'barrage', 'jokes', 'losing', 'sight', 'objective', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'might', 'even', 'should', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'communicating', 'value', 'virtues', 'rare', 'movie', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'three', 'have', 'believe', 'effectively', 'communicating', 'values', 'preaching', 'most', 'difficult', 'three.The', 'Pirates', 'Who', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Do', 'Anything', 'close', 'three', 'counts', 'animation', 'good', 'not', 'amaze', 'story', 'moments', 'laughter', 'emotion', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'many', 'characters', 'clear', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'being', 'willing', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'others', 'important', 'worth', 'effort', 'end', 'kids', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'entertained', 'having', 'important', 'principles', 'reinforced', 'truly', 'movie', 'kids', 'start', 'finish', 'rather', 'cute', 'story', 'mature', 'humor', 'thrown', 'time', 'time', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'parents', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'set', 'prurient', 'interests', 'aside', 'couple', 'hours.Now', 'could', 'just', 'get', 'freaky', 'cheese', 'curls', 'mind']",N/A

That's the world of the new VeggieTales release.  And it's a full length film.The movie opens in the 17th century.  We are on a ship that is being captured by pirates.  While brave Prince Alexander tries to fight them off, he is ultimate captured.  Unfortunately, the pirates are being led by Robert the Terrible.  Not only is he the king's banished brother, but he has also used mechanics to create arms and legs (well, one leg and one peg leg), making him the most fearsome pirate around.  The one thing he wants most is his brother's throne, and he intends to use the prince and princess to get it.Unfortunately for him, Princess Eloise and the butler Willory (Archibald Asparagus) have escaped capture.  And they use a contraption the King has created to send a plea for help.Fast forward to the present day.  At the Pieces of Ate Dinner Theater we meet Elliot, Sedgwick, and George (Larry the Cucumber, Mr. Lunt, and Pa Grape.)  They work as Cabin Boys (waiters), but long to be in the show.  Unfortunately, Elliot has a list of things he is afraid of, Sedgwick is just plain lazy, and George lacks self-confidence.And these three misfits are the ones the plea for help finds.  Before they really know what is happening, they find themselves on board the ship with Willory and Princess Eloise on a quest to rescue Prince Alexander.  Can they become heroes to complete the quest?  Or will their flaws spell doom for everyone?Aside from the characters I mentioned, most of the main characters are new.  But keep an eye open for blink and you'll miss then cameos from many of the regulars, including Bob the Tomato.  Also look for the appearance of the Grape family.  I guess they aren't gone for good.This movie really is a tale of two halves.  I found the first half slow and predictable as it set things up.  While the second half was still predictable, this is where the fun really started.  The jokes came much faster and really hit their target.This is also the least overt Christian film from the Veggies.  There is still a clear moral about what it takes to be a hero and there is a strong allegory to things (although don't take it too far or you'll wind up with very, very bad theology.)As you would expect, this move is 100% kid friendly.  The fearsome pirates drink Root Beer and Ginger Ale.  Their sword fights never produce a single wound.  Frankly, I got quite a kick out of this.In keeping with the Veggie's roots, this isn't the top notch animation you would normally see.  But it is keeping with their last few efforts, so long time fans will know what to expect.This is not the best effort from VeggieTales, but it is fun and the franchise's many fans will certainly enjoy it.",4,"""What Kind of B Movie Am I In?""",1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,2844,"['Imagine', 'world', 'where', 'vegetables', 'sail', 'seven', 'seas', 'most', 'fearsome', 'pirate', 'one', 'arms', 'legs', 'albeit', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'legs', 'world', 'new', 'VeggieTales', 'release', 'full', 'length', 'film.The', 'movie', '17th', 'century', 'are', 'ship', 'being', 'captured', 'pirates', 'brave', 'Prince', 'Alexander', 'fight', 'off', 'ultimate', 'captured', 'Unfortunately', 'pirates', 'are', 'being', 'led', 'Robert', 'Terrible', 'Not', 'only', 'king', 'banished', 'brother', 'also', 'used', 'mechanics', 'create', 'arms', 'legs', 'well', 'one', 'leg', 'one', 'peg', 'leg', 'making', 'most', 'fearsome', 'pirate', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'brother', 'throne', 'use', 'prince', 'princess', 'get', 'it.Unfortunately', 'Princess', 'Eloise', 'butler', 'Willory', 'Archibald', 'Asparagus', 'have', 'escaped', 'capture', 'use', 'contraption', 'King', 'created', 'send', 'plea', 'help.Fast', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'Pieces', 'Ate', 'Dinner', 'Theater', 'meet', 'Elliot', 'Sedgwick', 'George', 'Larry', 'Cucumber', 'Mr.', 'Lunt', 'Pa', 'Grape', 'work', 'Cabin', 'Boys', 'waiters', 'long', 'be', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'Elliot', 'list', 'things', 'afraid', 'Sedgwick', 'just', 'plain', 'lazy', 'George', 'self-confidence.And', 'three', 'misfits', 'are', 'ones', 'plea', 'help', 'finds', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'find', 'board', 'ship', 'Willory', 'Princess', 'Eloise', 'quest', 'rescue', 'Prince', 'Alexander', 'Can', 'become', 'heroes', 'complete', 'quest', 'will', 'flaws', 'spell', 'doom', 'everyone', 'Aside', 'characters', 'mentioned', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'new', 'keep', 'eye', 'open', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'then', 'cameos', 'many', 'regulars', 'including', 'Bob', 'Tomato', 'Also', 'look', 'appearance', 'Grape', 'family', 'guess', 'are', ""n't"", 'gone', 'good.This', 'movie', 'really', 'tale', 'two', 'halves', 'found', 'first', 'half', 'slow', 'predictable', 'set', 'things', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'still', 'predictable', 'where', 'fun', 'really', 'started', 'jokes', 'came', 'much', 'faster', 'really', 'hit', 'target.This', 'also', 'least', 'overt', 'Christian', 'film', 'Veggies', 'still', 'clear', 'moral', 'what', 'be', 'hero', 'strong', 'allegory', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'far', ""'ll"", 'wind', 'up', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'theology', 'would', 'expect', 'move', '100', '%', 'kid', 'friendly', 'fearsome', 'pirates', 'drink', 'Root', 'Beer', 'Ginger', 'Ale', 'sword', 'fights', 'never', 'produce', 'single', 'wound', 'Frankly', 'got', 'quite', 'kick', 'this.In', 'keeping', 'Veggie', 'roots', ""n't"", 'top', 'notch', 'animation', 'would', 'normally', 'see', 'keeping', 'last', 'few', 'efforts', 'so', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'expect.This', 'not', 'best', 'effort', 'VeggieTales', 'fun', 'franchise', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy']",N/A

1176835,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001CK7ONI,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 3]","Several years ago when Big Idea Productions hadn't gone bankrupt and Phil Vischer was still the man who everyone thought was running the company, he wrote a script for a motion picture that featured characters from the Big Idea universe, but in a non-Biblical story.  The movie was about the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything and was written several years before production even started on PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.  Unfortunately, Big Idea went bankrupt and the movie was forgotten and could have been a lost relic.  But thank goodness it wasn't and Vischer and Big Idea came together once again for THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING.The movie begins aboard a ship under attack by pirates in the 17th Century.  Led by Robert the Terrible, the banished brother of the King, the pirates capture Prince Alexander.  Robert is furious at his brother and intends to use the Prince as a pawn to win the King's throne. Alexander's sister, the Princess Eloise, and their butler Willory escape from the pirates and use a device the King has created (a nod to THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA hear) to call for help.Meanwhile in the present day, Elliot (Larry the Cucumber), Sedgwick (Mr. Lunt), and George (Pa Grape) are servers at the Pieces of Ate Dinner Theater.  The place is a popular entertainment destination for families and the trio all dream of eventually working not serving food, but as starring members of the cast in the show.  Taking a cue from THE WIZARD OF OZ, the three friends each have different issues that they struggle with.  None of the three are exactly where they would like to be in life and things seem headed downhill for them, especially when they mess up an audition for the cast.But then the mysterious device sent from the King selects these three to help.  Very rapidly the trio finds themselves traveling through time, fighting evil pirates, dodging flesh-eating cheese curls, and running from gigantic rock monsters.  It's one dangerous adventure after another and Elliot, Sedgwick, and George each have their face their own internal struggles and work as a team in order to rescue the Princess, defend the King, and save the Kingdom.THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING is a highly entertaining movie.  It is from Big Idea and features VeggieTales characters, but it is unlike any VeggieTale production to date.  For starters, the VeggieTales characters aren't actual characters in the movie. Instead, they play characters other than themselves.  For instance, normally Larry the Cucumber portrays all kinds of other different characters in a story, but everyone knows it's just Larry playing the parts, especially with the winks and nods to the 4th wall.  That doesn't happen in THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING. Instead, Larry plays Elliot and it is Elliot who is one of the heroes of the story.  It's basically what most actors do in each project they take on, but in this case it's the characters of VeggieTales who are the actors acting in a film that's not about them.  Larry, Mr. Lunt, and Pa Grape portray the major characters, but most of the cast of VeggieTales can be seen in the film in supporting roles or cameos.The movie is also significant because it is one of the least overtly Christian/Biblical of all the Veggie Tales shorts, DVDs, and movies so far.  The film is full of allegorical elements that are taken from Biblical scripture and Christianity, but the story is not a Bible story and never takes on a preachy tone.There are some that say the animation is good, but not amazing.  That's not accurate. Historically, Big Idea was making thirty minute shorts a couple years before Pixar came to the forefront.  The company was at one time on the cutting edge of CGI animation and was one of the first to break through the ""new frontier"" that is now so commonplace.  However, Big Idea is a very different company than Pixar and once their universe was created and the characters were established, there was no huge need to advance more rapidly.  Pixar and other animation studios like them continually push the envelope of CGI animation to make their features look more and more lifelike.  In the Big Idea universe, that's not necessarily. Yet, for the universe it is, THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING pushes at the boundaries of that universe, with extremely bright and vibrant colors, and has the characters doing all sorts of things they have never done before, e.g. sword fighting.The first half of the movie does move a bit slow, but once the trio travel back through time the pace quickens and doesn't stop until the end.  Also, true to VeggieTale humor there are all kinds of sight gags, one-liners, and allusions that are sure to make children laugh and their parents and other adults smile.",5,"A Story With Allegorical
