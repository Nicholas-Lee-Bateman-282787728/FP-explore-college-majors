1570397,AI1QOZ8AMDR3Q,B008MIYKS0,Bruce Burke,"[0, 0]","If you grew up during the early to mid 1960's everyone saw Peter Gunn. The classy P.I. who also worked well with police Lt. Jacobi on some cases. I have not had time to watch all these yet but I can say the picture quality is the best I have seen to date compared to earlier releases on other disc sets and tapes and the sound quality is better too. Also to own every episode made in this set is a definite plus. I always double-check episode title listings and seasons against the ep guides episode listing sheets-they are definitely all here. Being a half hour detective show means these stories move quickly and have plenty of action, style, and romance throughout the series. Be aware this show was on tv in 1958 through 1961 the era where the crime shows and westerns ruled the networks. The difference in this show is that Blake Edwards created the style of Peter Gunn very well played by Craig Stevens, the stories are fast-paced, and the music is the best plus done by Henry Mancini. If you grew up in that time zone and only saw a few shows, you need to buy this set. As a whole you will not be dissapointed in this episode set.  My only one dissapointment  is that  there was one Peter Gunn Movie made and it was in color simply called &#34;GUNN...NUMBER ONE&#34; done in the late 1960's starring Craig Stevens who did this after the series ended for the movie theaters and it also starred Ed Asner, Albert Paulsen' and Sherry Jackson and this movie is not included in this set.I only hope that it becomes available in the near future. That movie score was also done by Henry Mancini. Another one shot picture of Peter Gunn was made for tv several years later that starred Peter Strauss as Gunn but that was it. Still I rate this set a 5 for it's quality, pricing, completeness of episodes and many exciting shows with a great cast.",5,Peter Gunn The Complete Series,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,1842,"['grew', 'up', 'early', 'mid', '1960', 'everyone', 'saw', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'classy', 'P.I', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'well', 'police', 'Lt.', 'Jacobi', 'cases', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'yet', 'can', 'say', 'picture', 'quality', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'compared', 'earlier', 'releases', 'other', 'disc', 'sets', 'tapes', 'sound', 'quality', 'better', 'too', 'Also', 'own', 'episode', 'made', 'set', 'definite', 'plus', 'always', 'double-check', 'episode', 'title', 'listings', 'seasons', 'ep', 'episode', 'listing', 'sheets-they', 'are', 'definitely', 'here', 'Being', 'half', 'hour', 'detective', 'show', 'stories', 'move', 'quickly', 'have', 'plenty', 'action', 'style', 'romance', 'series', 'Be', 'aware', 'show', 'was', 'tv', '1958', '1961', 'era', 'where', 'crime', 'shows', 'westerns', 'ruled', 'networks', 'difference', 'show', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'created', 'style', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Craig', 'Stevens', 'stories', 'are', 'fast-paced', 'music', 'best', 'done', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'grew', 'up', 'time', 'zone', 'only', 'saw', 'few', 'shows', 'need', 'buy', 'set', 'whole', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'episode', 'set', 'only', 'one', 'dissapointment', 'was', 'one', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'Movie', 'made', 'was', 'color', 'simply', 'called', '34', 'GUNN', 'NUMBER', 'ONE', '34', 'done', 'late', '1960', 'starring', 'Craig', 'Stevens', 'who', 'did', 'series', 'ended', 'movie', 'theaters', 'also', 'starred', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Albert', 'Paulsen', 'Sherry', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'not', 'included', 'set.I', 'only', 'hope', 'available', 'near', 'future', 'movie', 'score', 'was', 'also', 'done', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'one', 'shot', 'picture', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'was', 'made', 'tv', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'starred', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'Gunn', 'was', 'Still', 'rate', 'set', '5', 'quality', 'pricing', 'completeness', 'episodes', 'many', 'exciting', 'shows', 'great', 'cast']",N/A

A little tweaking of the screen brightness and contrast may be needed but otherwise the picture quality is quite good (and the sound is fine).I have been surprised at how some TV shows from that era have not survived the passage of time gracefully (i.e. their picture quality is not good) but ' Peter Gunn ' was recorded on some medium that has held up well.For people not familiar with that TV era you will want to be aware that the frequent use of guns is pretty much the norm when dealing with ' the bad guy '. Peter Gunn, and his friend Sgt Jacobi, pull their pistols fairly often so if a quick (and noisy)  solution is not your cup-of-tea then be forewarned.One thing that I did not remember (I was fairly young when ' Peter Gunn ' was on-the-air) is how much 1950s jazz is featured (at least so far in the first few shows that I have watched). The series gives a real ' film noir ' sense ... Peter Gunn is ALWAYS immaculately dressed in a suit-and-tie regardless of whether he is listening to his girlfriend singing at ' Mother's ' or having it out with ' the bad guy ' (read  noisy).I was rather nervous when ordering ' Peter Gunn ', not sure of what I was going to receive, but that is behind me now .... it's very enjoyable.",5,The ' Peter Gunn ' DVD collection (' The Complete Series ' ) Is Very Good,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1378,"[""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'late', '1950s', 'liked', 'then', 'DVD', 'collection', 'will', 'please', 'little', 'tweaking', 'screen', 'brightness', 'contrast', 'may', 'be', 'needed', 'otherwise', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'sound', 'fine', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'how', 'TV', 'shows', 'era', 'have', 'not', 'survived', 'passage', 'time', 'gracefully', 'i.e', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'good', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'was', 'recorded', 'medium', 'held', 'up', 'well.For', 'people', 'not', 'familiar', 'TV', 'era', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'frequent', 'use', 'guns', 'pretty', 'much', 'norm', 'when', 'dealing', 'bad', 'guy', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'friend', 'Sgt', 'Jacobi', 'pull', 'pistols', 'fairly', 'often', 'so', 'quick', 'noisy', 'solution', 'not', 'cup-of-tea', 'then', 'be', 'forewarned.One', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'was', 'fairly', 'young', 'when', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'was', 'on-the-air', 'how', 'much', '1950s', 'jazz', 'featured', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'real', 'film', 'noir', 'sense', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'ALWAYS', 'immaculately', 'dressed', 'suit-and-tie', 'regardless', 'listening', 'girlfriend', 'singing', 'Mother', 'having', 'out', 'bad', 'guy', 'read', 'noisy', '.I', 'was', 'rather', 'nervous', 'when', 'ordering', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'receive', 'now', 'very', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Blake Edwards' creation was the coolest private eye anyone had ever seen on the home screen. Casting was inspired with Craig Stevens as Gunn, looking hip in expensive wardrobe, stylishly coordinated. His haircut - based on Cary Grant's hair style - was much admired and emulated. Stevens once said, &#34;Basically it was a crew cut that was parted. Lola Albright was Edie Hart, his sexy, sultry girlfriend singing old standards backed up by an ultra hip combo at Mother's on the waterfront of an unnamed city. Herschel Bernardi's portrayal of police Lieutenant Jacoby was also something new on the tube. Jacoby and Gunn had a love-hate relationship that crackled on screen. Of course, the glue that kept it all together was and still is some of the hippest progressive jazz ever written and recorded by Henry Mancini. It made him in the music business. In season one Hope Emerson played Mother as a bold, brassy and well-connected old broad. Season's two and three she was replaced by another character actress, Minerva Urecal. Adding to mix were the myriad Gunn informants - a host of fabulously off-center out of main stream types portrayed by great supporting actors of that era. Edwards ran a tight ship as creator producer-writer-director with his hardworking staff writers and directors to turn out the half-hour black and white noir gems. The Timeless Video Group has made the entire series shine in sound and visuals.
