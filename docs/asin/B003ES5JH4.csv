He absolutely loves both of seasons.If you're a 'Party Down' enthusiast, owning the DVDs makes viewing far more fun.  Closed captions are available so you don't miss a single, muttered-under-the-breath word.  And, being able to rewind and fast-forward, enjoying particular scenes over & over again... Season Two on DVD is pure gold.If you also loved Party Down, I recommend Season Two.  It's a little more relaxed and a little more tangled than Season One, and the second season brings more depth, angst, and hilarity to the premise and its conclusion.",4,Another great purchase for Party Down fans,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,634,"['special', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'set', 'purchased', 'husband', 'birthday', 'absolutely', 'seasons.If', ""'re"", ""'Party"", 'Down', 'enthusiast', 'owning', 'DVDs', 'viewing', 'far', 'more', 'fun', 'Closed', 'captions', 'are', 'available', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'single', 'muttered-under-the-breath', 'word', 'being', 'able', 'rewind', 'fast-forward', 'enjoying', 'particular', 'scenes', 'over', 'again', 'Season', 'Two', 'DVD', 'pure', 'gold.If', 'also', 'loved', 'Party', 'Down', 'recommend', 'Season', 'Two', 'little', 'more', 'relaxed', 'little', 'more', 'tangled', 'Season', 'One', 'second', 'season', 'more', 'depth', 'angst', 'hilarity', 'premise', 'conclusion']",N/A

So i watched it every week,and i just love this in every aspect. It has humor that is just over the top while still carrying a story that is deep. I enjoyed it thoroughly and i hope they make another season,which i don't think they will. Or at least a movie.

1338461,AKV1L9JL3L5TS,B003ES5JH4,"D. Bisciglia ""Swerd Murd""","[16, 16]","After seeing Season 1 and the way it ended, I figured there was no way Season 2 could live up to its pedigree.It does.  Oh, it does.The biggest change this season is a reversal of Ron and Henry's roles...which may seem jarring at first, but it's done so well you can hardly complain.  Seeing Henry have ""Ron moments"" is hilarious, through and through...and seeing screw-up/doesn't-care Ron is similarly awesome.  Constance (Jane Lynch) is no longer a recurring cast member (she has a guest appearance on the Season Finale) but her replacement, Lydia (Megan Mullaly) is even better imo.  While Constance was just a bit too stupid and insane to really be believable, Lydia is that overly-nice Mom type and adds quite an amusing dynamic to the group.  She has a few accidently-racist lines that catapulted me into laughter.Season 2 definitely feels a bit different than Season 1, especially at the beginning (first 4 episodes), but it's in no way a bad change.  Sadly, the series was cancelled by the powers that be, probably due to the fact that the show is on a network known for receiving the left-over scraps that HBO passed on.  It also aired new episodes at night on Friday if I remember correctly--did they want the show to fail or something?But yeah--this season's season finale is actually the series finale.  That said, it ends on an amazingly positive, wrapped-up note that gave me that feel-good warmth that only a genuinely well-told story can give you.Not to say I wouldn't lie, cheat, steal, and murder to get even one episode of a Season 3.I've watched this show start to finish loads of times--probably approaching the 30s now, and I still find new things I didn't notice and it's still funny.  This is comedy at its absolute finest.",5,A brilliant conclusion to the best American comedy series ever.,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,1747,"['seeing', 'Season', '1', 'way', 'ended', 'figured', 'was', 'way', 'Season', '2', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'pedigree.It', 'Oh', 'does.The', 'biggest', 'change', 'season', 'reversal', 'Ron', 'Henry', 'roles', 'may', 'seem', 'jarring', 'first', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'hardly', 'complain', 'Seeing', 'Henry', 'have', 'Ron', 'moments', 'hilarious', 'seeing', ""screw-up/doesn't-care"", 'Ron', 'similarly', 'awesome', 'Constance', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'longer', 'recurring', 'cast', 'member', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Season', 'Finale', 'replacement', 'Lydia', 'Megan', 'Mullaly', 'even', 'better', 'imo', 'Constance', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'stupid', 'insane', 'really', 'be', 'believable', 'Lydia', 'overly-nice', 'Mom', 'type', 'quite', 'amusing', 'dynamic', 'group', 'few', 'accidently-racist', 'lines', 'catapulted', 'laughter.Season', '2', 'definitely', 'bit', 'different', 'Season', '1', 'especially', 'beginning', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'way', 'bad', 'change', 'Sadly', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'powers', 'be', 'probably', 'due', 'fact', 'show', 'network', 'known', 'receiving', 'left-over', 'scraps', 'HBO', 'passed', 'also', 'aired', 'new', 'episodes', 'night', 'Friday', 'remember', 'correctly', 'did', 'want', 'show', 'fail', 'something', 'yeah', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'actually', 'series', 'finale', 'said', 'amazingly', 'positive', 'wrapped-up', 'note', 'gave', 'feel-good', 'warmth', 'only', 'genuinely', 'well-told', 'story', 'can', 'give', 'you.Not', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'lie', 'cheat', 'steal', 'murder', 'get', 'even', 'one', 'episode', 'Season', '3.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'show', 'finish', 'loads', 'times', 'probably', 'approaching', '30s', 'now', 'still', 'find', 'new', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'still', 'funny', 'comedy', 'absolute', 'finest']",N/A

I'm going  to say a lack of advertising killed off this series.  Sadly, the TV series Firefly died for the same reasons, too. Both due to a lack of advertising.  Seems, when Hollyweird wants something to fail, they just don't pay for the advertising.  If ratings were low, many times it does't accurately reflect how good a show is, but how poorly advertised it is.
