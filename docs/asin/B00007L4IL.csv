It's the fabulous Irish band live from Wembley stadium in London on their tour for In Blue. It includes a lot of favorite from the band, i.e. Runaway and So Young, and also many others. It's a great DVD with lots of fun moment and cool extras! A MUST HAVE FOR ANY CORRS FAN OR COLLECTOR(like myself).",5,The always fabulous Corrs deliver a great show.

730891,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B00007L4IL,Irishgal,"[6, 6]","I don't buy recordings of concerts. Very often, they are so staged and over-dramatized that the music is lost amongst the theatrics. This DVD, however, is proof that great concerts can be immortalized on film -- and if you want to experience a great show, the Corrs are a sure bet.Recorded at London's Wembley Arena in December 2000, this show is packed with energy, adrenaline, audience participation, and, of course, great music. On this DVD, you can experience the passion of 'Only When I Sleep' and 'Runaway', the mysticism of 'Dreams' and 'Forgiven Not Forgotten', the energy of 'No More Cry' and 'So Young', and the overall greatness of 'Breathless' and 'What Can I Do'.The Corr siblings are amazing performers, and it really shines through at this concert. They are passionate about their music, yet sing with a professional gracefulness lacking in many acts. When Andrea Corr laments about lost love, you believe her, but she doesn't need to smash guitars or take off all her clothes to get her point across. This is a show that I WOULD watch with my parents -- there is nothing hard or obscene about it.The special features are a nice bonus for those wishing for something a little extra. ""Access All Areas"" is a half-hour documentary behind the scenes of a day in the life of the band, from rehearsals to performace, as well as their thoughts on performing, writing, and traveling as a group. The special camera angles are a great way to view your favorite band member throughout a song -- for instance, I can watch Caroline Corr play the drums without interrupting shots of her siblings. The bonus track, 'Happy XMas (War Is Over)' is a classic holiday song played with a gentleness the John Lennon would've admired.One of my biggest regrets about living in the United States is that I have not been able to experience the Corrs live. This DVD has allowed me to ""attend"" a concert and feel the passion, excitement, and fun that goes into a live show -- all without leaving my living room.",5,Experience the Corrs,1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,1999,"['do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'recordings', 'concerts', 'Very', 'often', 'are', 'so', 'staged', 'over-dramatized', 'music', 'lost', 'theatrics', 'DVD', 'however', 'proof', 'great', 'concerts', 'can', 'be', 'immortalized', 'film', 'want', 'experience', 'great', 'show', 'Corrs', 'are', 'sure', 'bet.Recorded', 'London', 'Wembley', 'Arena', 'December', '2000', 'show', 'packed', 'energy', 'adrenaline', 'audience', 'participation', 'course', 'great', 'music', 'DVD', 'can', 'experience', 'passion', ""'Only"", 'When', 'Sleep', ""'Runaway"", 'mysticism', ""'Dreams"", ""'Forgiven"", 'Not', 'Forgotten', 'energy', ""'No"", 'More', 'Cry', 'Young', 'overall', 'greatness', ""'Breathless"", ""'What"", 'Can', ""Do'.The"", 'Corr', 'siblings', 'are', 'amazing', 'performers', 'really', 'concert', 'are', 'passionate', 'music', 'yet', 'sing', 'professional', 'gracefulness', 'lacking', 'many', 'acts', 'When', 'Andrea', 'Corr', 'lost', 'love', 'believe', ""n't"", 'need', 'smash', 'guitars', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'get', 'point', 'across', 'show', 'WOULD', 'watch', 'parents', 'nothing', 'hard', 'obscene', 'it.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'nice', 'bonus', 'wishing', 'something', 'little', 'extra', 'Access', 'Areas', 'half-hour', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'day', 'life', 'band', 'rehearsals', 'performace', 'as', 'well', 'thoughts', 'performing', 'writing', 'traveling', 'group', 'special', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'great', 'way', 'view', 'favorite', 'band', 'member', 'song', 'instance', 'can', 'watch', 'Caroline', 'Corr', 'play', 'drums', 'interrupting', 'shots', 'siblings', 'bonus', 'track', ""'Happy"", 'XMas', 'War', 'Is', 'Over', 'classic', 'holiday', 'song', 'played', 'gentleness', 'John', 'Lennon', 'would', ""'ve"", 'admired.One', 'biggest', 'regrets', 'living', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'experience', 'Corrs', 'live', 'DVD', 'allowed', 'attend', 'concert', 'feel', 'passion', 'excitement', 'fun', 'live', 'show', 'leaving', 'living', 'room']",N/A

And most of the songs in 'In Blue' were to pop for my taste. It doesn't sound too natural to me. The show could have done better with another approach. But it's already in the past, so there's no need to argue.Nonetheless this is a successful for most of the fans. The sisters dressed pretty.

730893,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00007L4IL,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 6]","The thought that there are better Corrs concerts out there on DVD is certainly encouraging because ""The Corrs - Live in London"" (a.k.a. ""The Corrs at Christmas"") is pretty good.  There are some clips on the documentary of the Corrs performing at Lansdowne Road that makes it clear how this one is different.  Obviously the audience is not as big, even at Wembley Arena, but the stage is a lot bigger which means the group is spread out much more for this gig (I assume fans know how the Corrs line up on stage so those who want to be on the Sharon side or the Jim side or in the middle with Andrea and Carolyn can purchase tickets accordingly).  The other difference is that the digital photograph shows up great on my television set.The 116-minute set includes songs from their third album, ""In Blue,"" and is directed by Hamish Hamilton, who would also do the group's Dublin concert in 2002 (he has also done multiple concert films for U2 and Robbie Williams).  There are some points where the director pointedly reminds you he is around, when the images turn to black and white or the close ups of Andrea Corrs became a bit too close, but for the most part you can just enjoy the concert.  Ultimately, you do not even have to really watch this one because just listening to it is pretty good, but special mention must be made that they make it real easy for you to sing along on this one because the subtitles are labeled ""Lyrics,"" and you have probably caught enough concert DVDs where that is not an option, so appreciate this one.The group's most recognizable songs are here with ""Runaway,"" Breathless,"" and ""So Young,"" along with their covers of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" and Tin Lizzy's ""Old Town.""  But the tracks I kept replaying as soon as I heard them were when Andrea picks up her tin whistle and the Corrs go to town on the instrumental numbers ""Joy of Life"" and ""Paddy Cathy.""  After all, the sound of the Corrs is the blend of Irish music with contemporary pop-rock, and those two pieces represent the high energy points in the concert.  I have been to Irish fest in Milwaukee several times and once this type of infectious music gets into your blood you are pretty much hooked for life.  There is also an unplugged section where Carolyn gets out from behind her drum kit and joins her siblings down stage for several numbers.When you get to the bonus features you can pick your favorite member to watch during the performances of ""Dreams,"" ""Radio,"" and ""Breathless"" (or watch each in turn).  It is interesting to watch how animated Sharon is while singing versus playing her violin, but I must admit watching Carolyn wail away on the drums is captivating.  There is a documentary that gets the group to sit down long enough to talk about their music and touring and a video of the group doing an unplugged version of John Lennon's ""Happy X-Mas (War is Over),"" which they give a simple elegance by virtual of their soft harmonies.  For me that last part is key, because ever since I started listening to the Smothers Brothers I have had a special fondness for sibling harmonies, and the Corrs certainly fit that bill.",5,The Coors in concert at Wembley Arena in London,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,3131,"['thought', 'are', 'better', 'Corrs', 'out', 'there', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'encouraging', 'Corrs', 'Live', 'London', 'a.k.a', 'Corrs', 'Christmas', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'clips', 'documentary', 'Corrs', 'performing', 'Lansdowne', 'Road', 'clear', 'how', 'one', 'different', 'Obviously', 'audience', 'not', 'as', 'big', 'even', 'Wembley', 'Arena', 'stage', 'lot', 'bigger', 'group', 'spread', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'gig', 'assume', 'fans', 'know', 'how', 'Corrs', 'line', 'up', 'stage', 'so', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'Sharon', 'side', 'Jim', 'side', 'middle', 'Andrea', 'Carolyn', 'can', 'purchase', 'tickets', 'accordingly', 'other', 'difference', 'digital', 'photograph', 'up', 'great', 'television', 'set.The', '116-minute', 'set', 'songs', 'third', 'album', 'Blue', 'directed', 'Hamish', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'would', 'also', 'do', 'group', 'Dublin', 'concert', '2002', 'also', 'done', 'multiple', 'concert', 'films', 'U2', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'director', 'pointedly', 'around', 'when', 'images', 'turn', 'black', 'white', 'close', 'ups', 'Andrea', 'Corrs', 'became', 'bit', 'too', 'close', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'just', 'enjoy', 'concert', 'Ultimately', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'really', 'watch', 'one', 'because', 'just', 'listening', 'pretty', 'good', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'make', 'real', 'easy', 'sing', 'along', 'one', 'subtitles', 'are', 'labeled', 'Lyrics', 'have', 'probably', 'caught', 'enough', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'where', 'not', 'option', 'so', 'appreciate', 'one.The', 'group', 'most', 'recognizable', 'songs', 'are', 'here', 'Runaway', 'Breathless', 'So', 'Young', 'covers', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Dreams', 'Tin', 'Lizzy', 'Old', 'Town', 'tracks', 'kept', 'replaying', 'as', 'soon', 'heard', 'were', 'when', 'Andrea', 'up', 'tin', 'whistle', 'Corrs', 'go', 'town', 'instrumental', 'numbers', 'Joy', 'Life', 'Paddy', 'Cathy', 'sound', 'Corrs', 'blend', 'Irish', 'music', 'contemporary', 'pop-rock', 'two', 'pieces', 'represent', 'high', 'energy', 'points', 'concert', 'have', 'been', 'Irish', 'fest', 'Milwaukee', 'several', 'times', 'once', 'type', 'infectious', 'music', 'blood', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'hooked', 'life', 'also', 'unplugged', 'section', 'where', 'Carolyn', 'out', 'drum', 'kit', 'siblings', 'down', 'stage', 'several', 'numbers.When', 'get', 'bonus', 'can', 'pick', 'favorite', 'member', 'watch', 'performances', 'Dreams', 'Radio', 'Breathless', 'watch', 'turn', 'interesting', 'watch', 'how', 'animated', 'Sharon', 'singing', 'versus', 'playing', 'violin', 'must', 'admit', 'watching', 'Carolyn', 'wail', 'away', 'drums', 'captivating', 'documentary', 'group', 'sit', 'down', 'long', 'enough', 'talk', 'music', 'touring', 'video', 'group', 'doing', 'unplugged', 'version', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Happy', 'X-Mas', 'War', 'Over', 'give', 'simple', 'elegance', 'virtual', 'soft', 'harmonies', 'last', 'part', 'key', 'ever', 'started', 'listening', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'have', 'had', 'special', 'fondness', 'sibling', 'harmonies', 'Corrs', 'certainly', 'fit', 'bill']",N/A
