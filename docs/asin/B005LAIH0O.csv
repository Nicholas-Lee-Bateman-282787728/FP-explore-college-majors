The movie had so much potential and had such a big following from just the trailer and of course when a trailer is that good there is always a little let down, but i don't think anyone expected for a let down like this. The movie is seriously set up like a show on national geographic exploring the art of exorcism and getting your first period, it captures that part perfectly, and it is just so boring. Yes exorcism movies typically have a lot of talking and stuff like that but this was unbearable, all it was, was talking and trying to be scary, which at some points was actually pretty funny. There was like 5 times during the whole movie that i jumped, the rest i sat there in my seat struggling to stay awake and to not yawn so loud. The camera was very shaky and i had a hard time seeing certain things or concentrating on certain things during the movie cause it was shaky or moving too much. And the ending, made the whole movie a horrible waste of time. the worst ending i have ever seen next to the ending of The Mist. If you like those dumb scary movies then this is the perfect movie for you! but this movie lives up to no expectations to any horror fans, i expected something way better from such a good trailer.",1,This movie..,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1298,"['honest', 'opinion', 'movie', 't', 'just', 'completely', 'horrible', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'had', 'big', 'following', 'just', 'trailer', 'course', 'when', 'trailer', 'good', 'always', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'expected', 'let', 'down', 'movie', 'seriously', 'set', 'up', 'show', 'national', 'geographic', 'exploring', 'art', 'exorcism', 'getting', 'first', 'period', 'part', 'perfectly', 'just', 'so', 'boring', 'Yes', 'exorcism', 'movies', 'typically', 'have', 'lot', 'talking', 'stuff', 'was', 'unbearable', 'was', 'was', 'talking', 'trying', 'be', 'scary', 'points', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'was', '5', 'times', 'whole', 'movie', 'i', 'jumped', 'rest', 'i', 'sat', 'there', 'seat', 'struggling', 'stay', 'awake', 'not', 'yawn', 'so', 'loud', 'camera', 'was', 'very', 'shaky', 'i', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'certain', 'things', 'concentrating', 'certain', 'things', 'movie', 'cause', 'was', 'shaky', 'moving', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'made', 'whole', 'movie', 'horrible', 'waste', 'time', 'worst', 'ending', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'next', 'ending', 'Mist', 'like', 'dumb', 'scary', 'movies', 'then', 'perfect', 'movie', 'movie', 'up', 'expectations', 'horror', 'fans', 'i', 'expected', 'something', 'way', 'better', 'such', 'good', 'trailer']",N/A

Despite how the majority feels about this movie, I thought it was a pretty good movie. I found it to be alot more interesting than The Last Exorcism. What amazes me is that The Last Exorcism recieved positive reviews from the media(I assume because it was the first found footage movie concerning Exorcism). Heck, I liked this movie even more than the third Paranormal Activity(and I love those movies).  I've seen quite a few 'found footage' movies since Blair Witch Project came out years ago and, believe me, I've seen far far worse movies. I'll admit, I didn't like how the movie ended either but, given thought about it, that was a worthy conclusion to the story. I suppose viewers would've wanted to see someone else become possessed with their eyes rolling back in their head and then the camera fading to black or something to that effect(leaving things open for a second movie) or actually seeing the demon appear itself? Still, It was an entertaining movie to me. It held my interest through til the end and that's all that really matters. I'd recommend it but I guess it all really depends on your taste in movies.

What they discover will be more shocking than anything they could have imagined as they enlist the help of two newly-ordained exorcists to help free her mother from demonic possession. THE DEVIL INSIDE exacerbates an already unlikely scenario using the popular ""found footage"" technique, which works as a disadvantage just as much as it aids in the realism on screen. It is difficult to accept that the governing bodies in the hospitals and churches would allow a cameraman to enter, let alone the fact that he would jeopardize his well-being for the sake of the film. The style does produce some truly unnerving moments, however, particularly in the disturbing basement exorcism in which contortionist Pixie Le Knot performs several gut-wrenching maneuvers. The story quickly loses focus and asks way too much of its audience as we near the final third of the film, at which point it becomes entirely unbelievable. The filmmakers then have the audacity to hock the film's website for updates on the case, as if anyone would visit after being left with such a jumbled and inconclusive ending.

The movie was released in early January and I went to see it the day it came out.  What a mistake.  This is another one of those shaky-cam movies that are all the fashion these days in the horror business.  The plot is really unoriginal and very predictable.  If you have seen several recent horror films over the past few years, you can probably predict what is going to happen while this movie unfolds.  The ending has to be the lamest I have ever seen.  The audience groaned through out the theater when I saw it and apparently that was the typical reaction at many other screenings.  Don't pay attention too much to the cover art.

To get possessed by a demon there are two ways for this to happen, first you have to open yourself up to the demon through witchcraft, satanism, sorcery, new age spiritualism ect, if your doing that your obviously not a Christian and you will become possessed but to engage in black magik the only way to move in the supernatural is to be in communion with it. Now one other way is through the bloodline there is bible scripture to back this up, don't have the verse off hand but if you reply back and want it, I can provide it later, do if your ancestors or parents or grandparents and do on, we're involved in the activities listed above and never because a christian afterwards and never broke the curse or bondage to the demons they had been in communion with, that demon has legal right to possess the desensdents through the bloodline, look at paranormal activity 3 (spoiler Alert for PA3 if you havent watched that movie please dont read)there was a lot of truth in that movie about a demon been passed down through the family because the mother was a witch that ""thought"" she had control of the demon when she was only a puppet. That's why the demon kept falling the family. The Last Exorcism had a lot of truth to it as well because it was a satanic cult involved and the ending was not the greatest but it was more believable the. This movie The Devil Inside, u actually liked the movie until the 3rd act and I hated the Idea of the demon passing from person to person as a contagious disease, that is a stupid idea and is not an accurate look at possession, if that were to be the case we would all be possessed, I don't like from any of these movies how the powers of darkness are stronger than God in these movies, rubbish I have encountered demons before and they have no authority over me and I'm not scared of them, I have also encountered possessed people before and the only way for them to be free from that possession is through salvation through Jesus Christ and months of counseling and prayer for delivering the demons from them, not ""exorcising"" them. In the book ""he came to set the captives free"" I think that's the right title a lady was a head of the largest witch coven in Europe and she became a Christian, it took several months of prayer and fasting with a minister that does counseling to be delivered of several hundred demons, this sometimes can take a long time.

Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[5, 9]","Initially, from watching previews and hearing the buzz about ""The Devil Inside,"" the film appeared to put a twist on the exorcism film genre, and that would have been a good thing, because these types of films have been done to death in recent years. But as it turns out, the film stumbles out of the gate, and just when it finally gets going, it abruptly comes to one of the worst endings in recent memory.The plot is a familiar one; a young girl becomes interested in having an exorcism performed on her mother, who has been locked away in an institution for two decades. She inlists the help of a few clergymen, who of course go against the wishes of the church to help a total stranger. Not surprisingly, the woman is in fact occupied by evil spirits, and when the priests and camera/film crew (sound familiar?) attempt to film the exorcism, things go terribly wrong.The camera angles attempt to add suspense and intrigue to the film, but just end up giving the viewer a headache. The best ""action"" scenes in the film are filmed in such poor lighting and so cluttered that it is impossible to tell what is going on. The acting is an absolute abomination, as the cast fails to scare the audience or to emote in any way to the tragic and shocking events that are taking place.The horror film genre has had two awful years in a row now, with ""Insidious"" being the only half-decent attempt at modern horror in that span. If ""The Last Exorcism"" was a lame attempt to combine ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" with ""Paranormal Activity,"" then this film is a muddled, half-hearted attempt to cash in on that concept yet again. What do they usually say about horror films that are not released during, or at least close to October? They say that the film never should have made it out of the cutting room to begin with.

It seems that with each passing year, the Devil picks another young nubile lady to claim as his own and another young priest must get with his inner Father Merrin to try and save her.  In keeping with this new trend, Paramount has delivered to the public The Devil Inside.Here we meet Isabella de Rossi whose mother Maria murdered three clergy members during a routine exorcism gone bad. Found insane by a jury, Maria is sentenced to spend the rest of her days in a mental hospital. But, for some odd, unexplained reason, the Vatican has her moved out of the States and shipped overseas to Rome in what has to be the only case in history where the Church has the power over the Court System to do so.  Convinced that her mother is not crazy and is in fact under demonic control, Isabella teams up with a documentary filmmaker and goes to Italy where she meets two rogue priests who want to help her case. Of course the Vatican, in all it's hypocrisy, has no desire to actually help out does everything it can to sweep Maria under the rug. But than things turn for the worse and the Devil begins to not only target Maria but also Isabella's team as well.Once again we are led to believe that what we are seeing is a true story which means that this is found footage. Of course it is never once explained who actually found the footage or why anyone thought that the public needed to see it in the first place. There is no score which, for me, really hampered the movie's overall effect. And of course we get the usual cliche moments that we come to expect from a exorcism movie: the speaking in various languages, the use of a double jointed contortionist, superhuman strength, and the usual camera drop to let us know when the movie is over and this time it's a really big drop.  While its no Emily Rose, it is light years beyond the bad The Rite and the worst The Last Exorcism.  As for the controversial ending, I didn't mind it do much as wanted a little more. There were still several loose ends left that I guess will be explained in the sequel which I'm sure is in the making such as what one priest supposedly did that was so bad that God won't forgive him. Also, if this was a true story why are we just now hearing about it?  Too many things happen in full public view such as an American priest attempting to drown a baby in a baptism or Isabella's attack on one of the doctors in the hospital near the end that would have newspapers all over the world flocking to Rome to put their own spin on the story. But my biggest complaint is that I found the movie very predictable in terms of how it would play out and was found to be correct. Still, I'll recommend it if you have about 90 minutes to kill and nothing better to do.

I loved every minute of The Devil Inside, and that includes the ""controversial"" ending.  Did it end the way I would have wanted it to end?  No, but neither does Gone With the Wind, so boo hoo.  Never have I seen such a crybaby reaction to a movie scene, with scores of people heaping one-star calumny on an entire film - which some will actually admit they liked up until that point - purely because a director actually did something bold (the ending is not a cop-out) and threw viewers a wicked curveball at the very end.  Some of the criticism in the media is to be expected because William Brent Bell did not allow those pampered prima donnas to preview the film before it hit theaters, but I would hope that viewers can see fit to give this film a chance.  It's not as if the ending doesn't make perfect sense.The Devil Inside is presented as a documentary of twenty-something Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) and her attempt to find closure regarding her mother's possible possession.  Some twenty years earlier, Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) murdered two priests and a nun as they were performing the rite of exorcism upon her.  Isabella hopes to learn whether her mother was really possessed or if she just went insane.  This takes her and her film crew to Rome, where Maria Rossi was mysteriously transferred after her acquittal of murder by reason of insanity.  It's definitely not normal for an insane murderer in America to be shipped off to a Roman Catholic mental institution just outside the shadow of the Vatican.  Isabella also takes the opportunity to visit the newly established Vatican school for exorcism, which leads her to two young exorcists who do not agree with the Church's policy of ignoring so many cases featuring all the hallmarks of actual demonic possession.The exorcism scenes on display here are extraordinarily impressive - short and powerful.  A female contortionist who can twist her body into unimaginable positions makes for a much more realistic possession visual than a head-spinning, spider-walking Linda Blair.  These are some intense scenes with a pretty convincing vessel of unholy malevolence spewing out untold evil, and the supernaturally dangerous consequences of any exorcism attempt play out most dramatically as the film works its way toward what I consider its pretty bold and courageous ending.  The fact that our exorcists are Church-trained priests operating outside the narrow confines of Vatican policy only raises the thrill factor up a notch.I know the whole documentary-style horror movie is in the process of being done to death, but I think The Devil Inside is an example of the genre done right.  The fact that the demon-spawned horrors and the exorcisms are presented so well gives the film a necessary dose of realism, and that is why The Devil Inside may inspire chills, creeps, obviously some boos at the end - but not laughter or ridicule.  It's definitely one of my new favorite horror films.",5,One of the best exorcism-based horror films in years,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,3074,"[""'re"", 'darned', 'right', ""'m"", 'going', 'defend', 'film', 'best', 'exorcism', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'loved', 'minute', 'Devil', 'Inside', 'controversial', 'ending', 'Did', 'end', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'end', 'No', 'neither', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'so', 'boo', 'hoo', 'have', 'seen', 'crybaby', 'reaction', 'movie', 'scene', 'scores', 'people', 'heaping', 'one-star', 'calumny', 'entire', 'film', 'will', 'actually', 'admit', 'liked', 'up', 'point', 'purely', 'director', 'actually', 'did', 'something', 'bold', 'ending', 'not', 'cop-out', 'threw', 'viewers', 'wicked', 'curveball', 'very', 'end', 'criticism', 'media', 'be', 'expected', 'William', 'Brent', 'Bell', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'pampered', 'prima', 'donnas', 'preview', 'film', 'hit', 'theaters', 'would', 'hope', 'viewers', 'can', 'see', 'fit', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'not', 'ending', ""n't"", 'make', 'perfect', 'sense.The', 'Devil', 'Inside', 'presented', 'documentary', 'twenty-something', 'Isabella', 'Rossi', 'Fernanda', 'Andrade', 'attempt', 'find', 'closure', 'regarding', 'mother', 'possible', 'possession', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'Maria', 'Rossi', 'Suzan', 'Crowley', 'murdered', 'two', 'priests', 'nun', 'were', 'performing', 'rite', 'exorcism', 'Isabella', 'learn', 'mother', 'was', 'really', 'possessed', 'just', 'went', 'insane', 'film', 'crew', 'Rome', 'where', 'Maria', 'Rossi', 'was', 'mysteriously', 'transferred', 'acquittal', 'murder', 'reason', 'insanity', 'definitely', 'not', 'normal', 'insane', 'murderer', 'America', 'be', 'shipped', 'off', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'mental', 'institution', 'just', 'shadow', 'Vatican', 'Isabella', 'also', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'newly', 'established', 'Vatican', 'school', 'exorcism', 'two', 'young', 'exorcists', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'Church', 'policy', 'ignoring', 'so', 'many', 'cases', 'featuring', 'hallmarks', 'actual', 'demonic', 'possession.The', 'exorcism', 'scenes', 'display', 'here', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'impressive', 'short', 'powerful', 'female', 'contortionist', 'who', 'can', 'twist', 'body', 'unimaginable', 'positions', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'possession', 'visual', 'head-spinning', 'spider-walking', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'are', 'intense', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'vessel', 'unholy', 'malevolence', 'spewing', 'out', 'untold', 'evil', 'supernaturally', 'dangerous', 'consequences', 'exorcism', 'attempt', 'play', 'out', 'most', 'dramatically', 'film', 'way', 'what', 'consider', 'pretty', 'bold', 'courageous', 'ending', 'fact', 'exorcists', 'are', 'Church-trained', 'priests', 'operating', 'narrow', 'confines', 'Vatican', 'policy', 'only', 'thrill', 'factor', 'notch.I', 'know', 'whole', 'documentary-style', 'horror', 'movie', 'process', 'being', 'done', 'death', 'think', 'Devil', 'Inside', 'example', 'genre', 'done', 'right', 'fact', 'demon-spawned', 'horrors', 'exorcisms', 'are', 'presented', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'necessary', 'dose', 'realism', 'why', 'Devil', 'Inside', 'may', 'inspire', 'chills', 'creeps', 'obviously', 'boos', 'end', 'not', 'laughter', 'ridicule', 'definitely', 'one', 'new', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films']",N/A

And if this was inspired by true events then where is the proof? It wasn't in the news and they didn't mention the people's real names that were involved in such an incident/s so overall it's some damn good acting because they even said in the credits that they hired contortionists to do the body twisting scenes - that one scene where the woman dislocated her arm is pretty hard to watch and where is the proof that people really died from these things if they're inspired by real life true events. - I do love that DVD cover though that shows the nun as if she's blind or possessed (but whoever heard of a possessed nun?) and it gives a creepiness to the actual effect of the overall film. It draws your attention to it.There's another movie out there called The Rite with Anthony Hopkins in it where this was supposed to have happened to a priest but I never saw anything in the news on it either and I don't know if these two movies were derived from the same story lines. The movie The Rite claims in it that the vatican had over 500,000 (half a million) reported cases of demon possession in the last year and they have an exorcism school at the vatican now, if this is true then why is it not reported in the news?

The young woman is befriended by two young priests who are rogue exorcists - they perform exorcisms which the church does not sanction.  You can pretty much fill in the blanks for the rest.

It advertised itself as the most terrifying movie of the year, sadly that was not the case. The movie starts off with nothing out of the ordinary, an eerie phone call to the police Marria Rossi(Suzan Crowley) admitting that she killed three people. Followed by the police entering the home where the victims were killed during and exorcism being performed on her. The police then head downstairs to where the victims were killed, they find nothing way out of the ordinary in terms of gruesomeness but at the same time not completely boring. Fast forward, the daughter after twenty years goes to find her mother in an asylum in Rome(the film location is a plus). Where it transitions into a terrible documentary hand held camera for the rest of the movie. The daughter goes on several unauthorized exorcisms to find an answer to what happened. The film eventually climaxes with an extremely predictable and clich&eacute;d ending finding myself asking ""was that it?"". The acting was sub-par accompanied by lax special effects leaving me somewhat unamused most of the movie.

'The Devil inside' is a great example; a number of Amazon reviews give this latest pseudo documentary/demon possessed flick the highest possible grade. If you stopped after reading those, you might be ready to move The Godfather down on your all time best list. However, there are just as many viewers who apparently only gave 'Devil inside' one measly star because the site makes a rating mandatory. After perusing these blistering pans, I wondered if the producers of the Police Acadamy sequels might be holding their chins a little higher lately.At the risk of appearing wishy-washy, I came down right about the middle. Unlike most moviegoers, I still have an affinity for the Fake Doc style. When used properly (Blair Witch, the first 3 Paranormal Activity films) it's still a terrific way of creating tension through a transferred feeling of realism. 'Devil' begins promisingly enough, with enough suspense, gore, and potential in the first 5 minutes to make me wonder what all the naysayers had been thinking. Unfortunately, the rest of the film's first act drags. The main character's mother is locked up in an asylum in Italy after murdering three people during an attempted Exorcism. Naturally, the evil-inhabited lunatic's lovely young daughter wants answers to the bizarre slaughter and decides to investigate, heading to Vatican City with requisite skeptical cameraman in tow.Knowing these basics, those who have seen more than one of these kinds of movies can probably predict the ensuing content. Daughter and camera guy attend Exorcism with 2 rebel priests. Shocks and weirdness abound. Daughter convinces the maverick do-gooders to take a look at mom, resulting in occurances that would instantly land on every country's newspaper front page instantly while becoming the most twittered/Googled event in history in the real world.There are some genuinely scary moments in 'Devil inside', as well as the usual reliance on shock value. But not nearly enough. Much of the dialogue is laughable, and the characters' decision-making during an obvious time period of extreme stress wouldn't be believable in a Jean Claude Van Damme flick. The acting is mostly decent, but any goodwill the film may have engendered is thoroughly erased by an abysmal ending. As reliable as the genre has been since 'The Exorcist', a true masterpiece, 'The Devil inside' suggests that it may be time for young filmmakers and eager producers to set their next fright films in a locale other than H-E-double hockey sticks.",2,Demonic posession jumps the shark,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,2574,"['Very', 'few', 'movies', 'get', 'huge', 'range', 'opinions', 'horror', 'films', 'Devil', 'great', 'example', 'number', 'Amazon', 'give', 'latest', 'pseudo', 'documentary/demon', 'possessed', 'highest', 'possible', 'grade', 'stopped', 'reading', 'might', 'be', 'ready', 'move', 'Godfather', 'down', 'time', 'best', 'list', 'However', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'apparently', 'only', 'gave', ""'Devil"", 'one', 'measly', 'star', 'site', 'rating', 'mandatory', 'perusing', 'blistering', 'pans', 'wondered', 'producers', 'Police', 'Acadamy', 'sequels', 'might', 'be', 'holding', 'chins', 'little', 'higher', 'risk', 'appearing', 'wishy-washy', 'came', 'down', 'right', 'middle', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'still', 'have', 'affinity', 'Fake', 'Doc', 'style', 'When', 'used', 'properly', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'first', '3', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'films', 'still', 'terrific', 'way', 'creating', 'tension', 'transferred', 'feeling', 'realism', 'begins', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'enough', 'suspense', 'gore', 'potential', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'naysayers', 'had', 'been', 'thinking', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'film', 'first', 'act', 'drags', 'main', 'character', 'mother', 'locked', 'up', 'asylum', 'Italy', 'murdering', 'three', 'people', 'attempted', 'Exorcism', 'Naturally', 'evil-inhabited', 'lunatic', 'lovely', 'young', 'daughter', 'answers', 'bizarre', 'slaughter', 'decides', 'investigate', 'heading', 'Vatican', 'City', 'requisite', 'skeptical', 'cameraman', 'tow.Knowing', 'basics', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'one', 'kinds', 'movies', 'can', 'probably', 'predict', 'ensuing', 'content', 'Daughter', 'camera', 'guy', 'attend', 'Exorcism', '2', 'rebel', 'priests', 'Shocks', 'weirdness', 'abound', 'Daughter', 'maverick', 'do-gooders', 'take', 'look', 'mom', 'resulting', 'occurances', 'would', 'instantly', 'land', 'country', 'newspaper', 'front', 'page', 'instantly', 'becoming', 'most', 'twittered/Googled', 'event', 'history', 'real', 'are', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'moments', ""'Devil"", 'inside', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'reliance', 'shock', 'value', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'laughable', 'characters', 'decision-making', 'obvious', 'time', 'period', 'extreme', 'stress', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'believable', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'flick', 'acting', 'mostly', 'decent', 'goodwill', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'engendered', 'thoroughly', 'erased', 'abysmal', 'ending', 'As', 'reliable', 'genre', 'been', ""'The"", 'Exorcist', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'Devil', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'eager', 'producers', 'set', 'next', 'fright', 'films', 'locale', 'other', 'H-E-double', 'hockey', 'sticks']",N/A

I know I'm almost a year late on the band wagon but what I find just so f***ing offensive about this film is that if they even put a little bit more effort into at least the ending then it would've been a better movie.I'd be willing to ignore some of the stupid crap they did throughout the short running time, such as the characters whining about each other over things we never get to see and have to just go along with, I'm willing to accept the stupid 'demon jumping' crap that's like a wannabe zombie infection thing with demons, I'm willing to accept the half assed acting and the fact that a rogue priest is suddenly s***ing his britches over fear of punishment by the Catholic Church, EVEN THOUGH HE'S ALREADY EXORCISED LIKE SIX PEOPLE. Yes, I'd be willing to let all this bulls*** slide if they didn't put up a giant middle finger for the ending.There was some good potential with this film, the main character's plight about saving her mother for example, her mom got locked up years ago and she wanted answers, especially because there was no other family for her. Also a daughter seeing her mom who's gone completely insane is sad, people who's parents have gone through dementia can probably relate to that. Also two priests that became rogue exorcists was a neat-o concept, it took the old boring exorcist formula and made it more interesting, it actually gave the film momentum instead of most wanna be Exorcist movies where it's a priest reflecting on his faith or whatever crap for half the movie.Even an abrupt ending could've worked if done better. How about say, they kidnap the mom, bring her to their house or something, and she winds up killing them all and is loose on the streets of Italy. A little more open ended instead of ""GOOGLE THE F***ING ENDING BECAUSE WE STOPPED GIVING A S***"", has more of that creep factor with ""oh snap a possessed woman is wandering the streets"", or at least have the cast die trying instead of all of them being wiped out when they're caught with their pants down.Just, f***ing, pathetic.

Now, onto the movie review.While this isn't the greatest exorcism movie I've ever seen, it's certainly better than the Last Exorcism (I think the decision to make a PG-13-rated found-footage exorcist flick didn't help it). This film explores not only tried-and-true ideas about demonic exorcism (both from actual medical and spiritual points-of-view, but also from-in subtle ways-hollywood films), but also some other ideas that have never been tried in movies, which helps get expounded later in the film.I have to say, they did seem to try to go into excess a bit in the beginning with the jump factor. A couple times felt more like ""was that at all necessary?"" rather than anything realistic. Nonetheless, it helped set the mood for the grittier jumps and deeper chills. And so did the tension between secular mindsets of science versus religiosity. The tension's not only the debate, but also between the cameraman and the team itself, but that seems to help add variety to the people in the film. I remembered reading a book about exorcisms that said the same thing one of the exorcists in this film said, that no two are the same, that they can take minutes or years. The ones in this films take minutes, but if you're in the right mood, the effects last hours.There's also revelations on hypocrisy within the church like being ashamed to acknowledge anything about demons and possessions (making it sound like the Vatican's more of a secular church than somewhere that believes the Bible itself, something that wouldn't surprise me), trying to sound kind and polite about someone ""possibly"" being possessed and using religious cliches at the same time (talk about hypocritical to sound like they'll help then subtly turn someone away for not making the right grounds). So, you may end up rooting for the team as they do what they feel they need to do, no matter the differing opinions. Then, when you think the primary exorcism is done with... things get extremely intense and hard to turn from and the darker ideas start to take place.The ending is where most diverge and either like the movie or abhor it. Personally, it felt right, like change one element or another and it would have been too easy to do or convenient, instead, the scenario stayed in step with the movie's own character. Honestly, I wished it would have presented some hope, but since it's not my decision-making that causes a film, I have no say. Overall, this did have some very effective scares and thought-provoking elements in it that made feel more realistic than several other found-footage films I've seen in the past.",4,Within details,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2782,"['could', 'be', 'other', 'reviews', 'try', 'make', 'useless', 'war', 'who', 'disagree', 'simply', 'view', 'movie', 'not', 'browbeater', 'convince', 'anything', 'Now', 'movie', 'review.While', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'exorcism', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'better', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'think', 'decision', 'make', 'PG-13-rated', 'found-footage', 'exorcist', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'tried-and-true', 'ideas', 'demonic', 'exorcism', 'actual', 'medical', 'spiritual', 'points-of-view', 'also', 'from-in', 'subtle', 'ways-hollywood', 'films', 'also', 'other', 'ideas', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'tried', 'movies', 'get', 'expounded', 'later', 'film.I', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'seem', 'try', 'go', 'excess', 'bit', 'beginning', 'jump', 'factor', 'couple', 'times', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'necessary', 'rather', 'anything', 'realistic', 'Nonetheless', 'helped', 'set', 'mood', 'grittier', 'jumps', 'deeper', 'chills', 'so', 'did', 'tension', 'secular', 'mindsets', 'science', 'versus', 'religiosity', 'tension', 'not', 'only', 'debate', 'also', 'cameraman', 'team', 'help', 'add', 'variety', 'people', 'film', 'remembered', 'reading', 'book', 'exorcisms', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'one', 'exorcists', 'film', 'said', 'two', 'are', 'same', 'can', 'take', 'minutes', 'years', 'ones', 'films', 'take', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'right', 'mood', 'effects', 'last', 'hours.There', 'also', 'revelations', 'hypocrisy', 'church', 'being', 'ashamed', 'acknowledge', 'anything', 'demons', 'possessions', 'making', 'sound', 'Vatican', 'more', 'secular', 'church', 'somewhere', 'Bible', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'trying', 'sound', 'kind', 'polite', 'someone', 'possibly', 'being', 'possessed', 'using', 'religious', 'cliches', 'same', 'time', 'talk', 'hypocritical', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'help', 'then', 'subtly', 'turn', 'someone', 'away', 'not', 'making', 'right', 'grounds', 'So', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'rooting', 'team', 'do', 'what', 'feel', 'need', 'do', 'matter', 'differing', 'opinions', 'Then', 'when', 'think', 'primary', 'exorcism', 'done', 'things', 'get', 'extremely', 'intense', 'hard', 'turn', 'darker', 'ideas', 'start', 'take', 'place.The', 'ending', 'where', 'most', 'diverge', 'movie', 'abhor', 'Personally', 'felt', 'right', 'change', 'one', 'element', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'easy', 'do', 'convenient', 'instead', 'scenario', 'stayed', 'step', 'movie', 'own', 'character', 'Honestly', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'presented', 'hope', 'not', 'decision-making', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'Overall', 'did', 'have', 'very', 'effective', 'scares', 'thought-provoking', 'elements', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'realistic', 'several', 'other', 'found-footage', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past']",N/A

The three dead people were two priests and a nun all who were performing an exorcism on Maria. Isabella Rossi is now an adult and the daughter of Maria. She wants to finally know what is wrong with her mom and why is she was taken from the USA and is in a medical institution in Italy under the authority of the Catholic Church...This is a story about a young woman searching for the truth about her mom and trying to ultimately help her recover and come home to the USA. It has a choppy storyline and the filming of the movie is poor for many reasons. Too many scenes are in the dark and the camera filming is jumpy the entire movie. Such filming gives me a headache.The script is written like it is the story about a documentary and the acting is about as poorly portrayed. This film had so much potential to be a much better film but it seemed to me that the director did everything possible to be cute with the filming and make it over dramatic that it simply missed its mark. That includes the black screen when all of the lights and the camera go out in the middle of the exorcism. Who wants to look at a black screen while watching a movie in the one scene that the entire movie is about?So much potential and so little expert directing that the result is a poorly done movie that is just dull.

This went from &#34;could be great&#34; to &#34;good Lord&#34; around the halfway mark; a 4 star opening and a 0 star finish.  What a shame.This film is presented as a documentary following the main character Isabella (Fernanda Andrade).  This tactic has been adopted by Grave Encounters and The Last Exorcism, though neither included testimonials or expert opinions of individuals that weren't involved in the story.Twenty years ago this Isabella&#8217;s mother brutally murdered some of her congregation members during a church group exorcism (her own exorcism).  After being found innocent (insanity plea) she is sent away to a very special facility specializing in exorcisms in Italy operated by the Vatican.  Just like a show on the History Channel we hear Isabella&#8217;s testimonials and experiences as well as those of medical professionals and priests on the topic of mental illness and/or demonic possession.The Vatican denies all involvement in exorcism but evidently has a graduate school program dedicated to the age-old practice just like in The Rite.  Exorcism stock footage is observed and followed by open forum diagnosis of the &#8220;patient.&#8221;  The priestly &#8220;students&#8221; are just like uber-academics; they think they know everything, they&#8217;re irritatingly argumentative and they&#8217;re suspiciously passionate about their work.  Being an attractive young girl with a life Isabella responds to them appropriately: like they&#8217;re a bunch of good-intentioned, awkward geeks.  They give her some useful input, though, on coming to one&#8217;s own terms with that which is mental illness and that which is possession.  How will I know, she asked.  Annnnnnd, cue the clich&eacute;:  &#8220;You&#8217;ll know it when you see it.&#8221;Isabella visits her mother&#8217;s special facility and the doctor denies the possibility of possession in lieu of abnormal mental function.  When visiting hours come, she is warned to make no mention of God, religion, fate or the like, as these things elicit violent outbursts.  Mom is quite sedated, wearing vacant expressions that randomly trade out for discomforting tones, a healthy compliment of different voices (as if harboring multiple personalities) and self-destructive commentary.  I was just waiting for her to do something messed up at any moment.Back with the young exorcists they analyze the footage of her visit, during which Isabella's mother seemed to know something she couldn&#8217;t possibly have known.  We also learn that these rogue exorcists are performing exorcisms without the church&#8217;s support.  To help her mother she must learn about exorcisms, not in a class but in person.  Possession scenes are complete with painful contortions, blood in all the wrong places and threats in multiple languages.I feel like this film started out with so much promise.  I liked the semi-satirical documentary approach.  I liked that we got to know the characters through their own narrative via video log entries as much as by their actions.  I really thought I was finally in for a good possession movie.  Lord knows, it&#8217;s been a while.  But almost as soon as the possession scenes begin the film slowly falls apart until &#34;the ending that wasn't there.&#34;I don&#8217;t recommend this movie and to be specific as to why would spoil the film for those who wouldn&#8217;t heed my warning anyway.",2,"So much promise squandered!

1466467,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B005LAIH0O,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[2, 4]","The Devil Inside follows Isabella Rossi as she tries to find out what caused her mother, Maria Rossi, to kill three people; according to her father, Isabella's mother committed these murders while possessed by a demon and during her exorcism. Isabella documents her journey to Rome where she meets two priests and personally experiences several exorcisms. The Devil Inside is a missed opportunity to create a truly terrifying possession film simply because it was too generic- simply because it never tried to be different. It doesn't help that it's also riddled with flaws.The Devil Inside has a very simple story: Isabella tries to find out whether her mom was actually possessed, or is her mom actually mentally ill? It really isn't anything special or new, which is a problem. The bigger problem was the failure to create an immersive world, or have engaging dialogue/conversations. The exorcisms in this film didn't feel intense or frightening- I didn't feel sad for the possessed character, and it really didn't focus on the possessed characters at all (it probably would've had more impact and significance if it did.) The ""twisted body, popping bones"" possessions have gotten old, and have lost their effectiveness. It's not really a scary film, either. All of the jump-scares are literally loud shouts. And, the ending was extremely unfulfilling; it just ends without any closure. I realize filmmakers occasionally have trouble finishing up their films, and finding an ending that will be universally loved, but rushing the ending and telling people to visit a website isn't the answer (recent examples would be ""Insidious"" and ""The Pact""- although I liked these endings/third acts, I understand why many found them underwhelming)And, when I say ""too generic"", I mean it follows the same structure we've seen in found-footage films for the past few years. The same type of dialogue; characters get mad at each other, the main character complains about being filmed although she agreed to be documented, etc. Then, there is the finale, which is similar to those in [Rec] and Paranormal.Activity; the lights go out, characters panic, someone suddenly appears and scares everyone, etc. ([Rec], however, did this right since it build tension.) It's basically the same film/structure we've seen plenty of times before.Overall, The Devil Inside is not a scary film; it lacks the character and innovation to create a truly terrifying and impacting possession film. If you still plan on watching this film, I strongly recommend you avoid the trailer as it gives away most of the film. As of 12/31/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, I highly recommend streaming before directly paying for this film (I.e.

Also since ""The Blair Witch Project"" and more recently the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise more and more horror films have tried to be creative by presenting their material in first person/documentary style filmaking often with varied results.Exorcism movies have become much more popular in the past few years, especially the psuedo documentary style some display though ""The Last Exorcism"" was the worst of them in my opinion and you again always have to take this ""real story"" presentation with a grain of salt. Such is the case with ""The Devil Inside"", where we start in 1989 with footage showing police going through a house after three clergy members were murdered and a woman confessed to the murders via a 911 call.If it stopped there we would've had a short movie but flash foward 20 years later, now we see the daughter of the killer who wants answers for why her mom did what she did years back. What follows is the usual jump out of your scares, the daughter's own questioning about whether its in her genes to snap and go mad like her mom. There's also the great debate throughout about whether its demonic possession or simply a degenerative mental disorder.While it may have sounded like I was slamming the film and its by no means great it does provide a few good jolts, the acting is at least acceptable and it does have some good elements to its story. For those wanting more than one exorcism in an exorcism film you get your fill here, so fans rejoice.

Let me begin by saying that some of it was so shaky, I actually started feeling sick on the stomach.  I was expecting to like it, but . . .On October 30, 1989, Maria Rossi called the police to tell them she just killed 3 people.  They were actually 2 priests and a nun, trying to perform an exorcism on Maria.  They were, obviously, unsuccessful.Maria was subsequently found not guilty due to insanity and later transferred to an asylum. Although the archdiocese stated they did not authorize Maria's exorcism, they somehow got involved and had her transferred to their facility in Italy.  Daughter Isabella later states that Mom started changing when Isabella was age 6.It is now December 2009 and Isabella is in her early 20s.  She sets off to the Vatican's school for exorcism, to learn more about the subject, and intends to stop by and see mom at the Centrino Mental Hospital.  Isabella also meets some guys who perform exorcisms for the church, but also perform some ""unauthorized"" ones on the side.  It seems the church only authorizes exorcisms where there is proof of possession, but the proof often is not displayed until an exorcism is performed.  These individuals (priests, I think), try to help the poor possessed folks the church turns down.Like I said, the jerkiness of the film made it real hard to watch.  I do not recommend it.

I agree with the controversy of it was not for everyone because it wasnt a PARANORMAL ACTIVITY (yes, I brought out the big boy) type of scare, but more of a physcological thrill as it makes you wonder if being possessed is really being possessed or if it is a mental illness. There were just a few problems with the movie....Number 1: I thought this was about MARIA ROSSI? That's what the trailer said, that's what it said in the beginning. But In the movie, she is hardly there at all. We see her what, twice? Through the movies entirety. The rest of it is trying to prove whether or not she's possessed. The other exorcism with the double jointed girl was very interesting (If not disgusting) but I didnt care about her, I wanted to see Maria.Number 2: The nun on the case. Dont buy the movie for her. She's in the movie for like 5 seconds. I'm so sick of people being like ""Ooo I love this case! It looks creepy! Let's get it"". She's not a huge character. Get over it.Number 3: The reason why my review had 3 stars. THE ENDING. Yes, I am one of the many that hated the ending. I was so into the movie at that point that I was hoping that we'd see the priest actually exercise them and see the demons continue to fight over their human hosts, but instead, it's almost as if the director got bored and decided, ""Well, screw it!"" and just killed them off. I did not check out the website on the credits because I bought the movie to learn about the case of Maria Rossi, not to have to go to a website to learn.

1466483,A2V8KPLWKROTKV,B005LAIH0O,Marco,"[0, 3]","The Devil Inside is both the latest exorcism movie and the latest found footage from an incomplete documentary film to hit cinemas, which smashed the US box office when it opened in January to the tune of $33 million dollars. Not bad considering it cost less than a million to make and eventually went on to gross 83 times that worldwide and hasn't even opened in the UK until today.The setting for our press screening of the film was a suitably spooky Round Chapel in Hackney, which provided incredible acoustics for the film and having actual nuns and priests acting as Ushers and singing hymns in Latin added to what was already a great, Gothic setting for the screening. Odd considering the fact the film begins with the same tagline that is splashed across all the posters, `The Vatican does not endorse this movie'.Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) travels from America to Rome to visit her Mother whom she has not seen since she was declared insane and mysteriously sent to an asylum in Vatican City after murdering three members of her local church that were trying to perform an Exorcism on her. Isabella's life has been haunted ever since and she finally wants to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding her Mother and determine whether she is insane or is in fact possessed.She attends a class on Exorcism where she meets Fathers Ben and David who are both ordained exorcists and rebels against the strict rules the Catholic Church now has in place around performing an exorcism; in essence it is the very last resort and can only be taken into consideration if all forms of mental illness can be absolutely ruled out.Isabella meets her Mother (Suzan Crowley) and it's clearly the woman she meets is not the one she called `Mommy' as a little girl. She speaks in several different voices and languages, has upside down crosses scratched into her arms and gums, possesses super human strength and knows dark secrets about Isabella that she never shared with her. Is she possessed? The church doesn't think so, but Isabella, Ben and David certainly do and take it upon themselves to perform an exorcism, which does not go to plan.Made as a mockumentary, with a camera crew following Isabella on her trip, The Devil Inside sounds like just another exorcism movie that will draw a crowd off that alone. However, I was pleasantly surprised (and terrifyingly shocked) by the result. The Exorcist aside, I am not a fan of exorcism movies. Since starting writing for What Culture I have given caustic reviews to other movies that have attempted to take on the exorcism as a subject matter - The Rite and The Last Exorcism, classing them as clich&eacute;d and above all ineffective. And while on second viewing I found the latter of the two had some virtues (The Rite is a film I wish never to be in a fourty mile radius of) and used the mockumentary/ lost footage style of filmmaking to some effect I was left wanting, ultimately because it didn't offer any new insight into exorcism. The Devil Inside, however, does just this.I really enjoyed learning about the ways in which patients are now carefully studied and all aspects of mental illness taken into consideration before an exorcism is even considered. It paints a picture of the new Catholic Church, jaded in bureaucracy, for better or worse. It was also an excellent tool to make us root for this crew of people fighting against the odds of a huge organisation to do what they felt was right and free a woman from her inner turmoil.Apart from this original and new to me - at least - information on the Catholic Church's stance on exorcism the film is also exceptionally well made. Characters are well constructed, their motivations clearly laid out and the plot excellently set. The latter is well paced and unfolds in the style of a classic horror narrative, with a healthy dose of shocks, some gruesome, some unnerving, some just clever visual tricks that are nicely interspersed. The shaky camera is used to great effect and actually adds a real sense of realism to the exorcism scenes. But the real success is the sense of mood that is created and maintained. It's atmospheric, edgy. They manage to make Rome very gothic and devoid of any real beauty. It looks dark and grey and miserable. The sun is absent from this Rome.In the Eli Roth produced The Last Exorcism they started to play with the way a victim contorts their body in ways that boggle the mind, turn the stomach and cause a viewers face to scrunch up. As of course William Friedkin did in the original with the classic - and oft-comically lampooned - head turning scene. And here they take it a step further. Apart from there now being multiple occasions of extreme contortion, the execution is far more effective and cringe-inducing to the point I had to look away.The cast are solid, with particular mention going to Suzan Crowley who plays the possessed mother. Crowley's performance is as haunting as it is terrifying; her facial expressions, the way she throws her voice and the way she moves her body are deeply convincing and very affecting. Fernanda Andrade also holds her own in the leading role; she's expressive and very genuine. It's a performance of great restraint, but when she is called upon to be vulnerable or aggressive she comes through with great aplomb.The ending is rather abrupt and lacks creativity; it does feel like the filmmakers ran out of steam and couldn't find a good ending so decided to choose a smash-grab-get out while the audience are still reeling from the events that have come before, which is in keeping with the `lost footage' genre that this sits in. I'm not sure whether this is a shame or a virtue. While they dodge the exorcism movie clich&eacute;, they fall into the `lost footage film' clich&eacute; and ultimately pull short of doing something really creative. This is the film's greatest flaw.The ending aside, however, The Devil Inside is a thoroughly successful movie as both a horror film and a mockumentary. It is consistently edgy, atmospheric and horrific, offering some truly gruesome moments, all perfectly executed by the filmmakers and delivered with class by the actors",5,Best exorcism film since the

I have 2 relatives & 1 family friend that have been possessed in the past, one of whom has never recovered. Yes, they all have been evaluated by doctors/psychiatrists/religious figures of various religions, & misdiagnosed many times before exorcisms were attempted. The acting in this movie was terrible. The priests were cartoonish & provided no believability to their roles. The depiction of an exorcism was decent. Sometimes a person can be afflicted with slight alterations in their behavior in the beginning. As a result it can take months/years to properly diagnose them as being possessed. Often they are misdiagnosed as someone with a mental disorder. The reverse is also true, sometimes someone who is assumed to be possessed actually has a mental disorder. The film insinuated that fact. The actual symptoms/descriptions of the possessed were fairly decent, yet every case differs. Not every afflicted person has the same symptoms. One of my relatives that was possessed used to try to bite anyone who came near him. He would start foaming from the mouth, speaking inaudible words, & try to literally tear your ear off or bite your neck. He would shriek at the site of anything religious/spiritual regardless of which religion it was from. An actual exorcism can take moments to years to complete. Often it requires multiple sessions & the entity can repossess someone months & even years later. I liked the fact that they attempted to showcase the psychological/physical strains everyone goes through. These situations can be incredibly painful, emotional, & exhausting for everyone involved. This movie is a suspenseful drama, not a horror film. It is worth a rental but don't expect great acting or proof of evil.

The Priests both were very good actors, and believable.Role players: such as the camera man, did act a bit and had to do little to convince the viewer of much emotion. I'd say the real actor is the possessed mother, wow, very hard to pull off all that intense rage...Direction: if anything the direction was seamless, and the exorcisms were very realistic and quite frightening; the smutty talk in another language made it sickening and the blood splattered and sprayed.Production and effects, looked to be as professional as the paramount name suggests, this is not a B rated film, it had a low budget, but you as the viewer never once noticed it that way.I believed in the exorcists and put this at the top of these types films here on Amazon...",5,"If you ich for watching a Exorcist film, about exorcists...",1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,1788,"['need', 'get', 'over', 'ourselves', 'was', 'one', 'hell', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'captivating', 'beginning', 'Starting', 'real', 'news', 'cast', '911', 'call', 'supposedly', 'made', 'Marie', 'Rossi', 'was', 'brilliant', 'way', 'bringing', 'plot', 'story', 'line', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'More', 'research', 'did', 'Maria', 'Rossi', 'showed', 'was', 'creative', 'fiction', 'based', 'real', 'UK', 'murderer', 'same', 'name', 'pseudo', 'documentary', 'style', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'director', 'producer', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'seamlessly', 'not', 'draw', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'camera.Story', 'became', 'very', 'fresh', 'when', 'Isabella', 'confront', 'mother', 'twists', 'writing', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'such', 'exorcist', 'priest', 'invoking', 'evil', 'spirit', 'hurting', 'baby', 'baptism', 'cops', 'get', 'involved.Plot', 'rather', 'original', 'girl', 'find', 'meet', 'long', 'lost', 'demon', 'possessed', 'mother', 'who', 'supposedly', 'killed', 'people.Acting', 'lead', 'girl', 'was', 'great', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'part', 'lonely', 'girl', 'Rome', 'Priests', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'believable.Role', 'players', 'such', 'camera', 'man', 'did', 'act', 'bit', 'had', 'do', 'little', 'convince', 'viewer', 'much', 'emotion', ""'d"", 'say', 'real', 'actor', 'possessed', 'mother', 'wow', 'very', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'intense', 'rage', 'Direction', 'anything', 'direction', 'was', 'seamless', 'exorcisms', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'quite', 'frightening', 'smutty', 'talk', 'language', 'made', 'sickening', 'blood', 'splattered', 'sprayed.Production', 'effects', 'looked', 'be', 'as', 'professional', 'paramount', 'name', 'not', 'B', 'rated', 'film', 'had', 'low', 'budget', 'viewer', 'never', 'once', 'noticed', 'believed', 'exorcists', 'put', 'top', 'types', 'films', 'here', 'Amazon']",N/A

But I was mostly curious about the movie's ending, which has been called ""the worst ending of all times"".""The Devil Inside"" (2012 release; 83 min.) is another one of those ""fake documentary"" movies along the lines of The Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity, which is fine by me as I happen to generally like those movies. The plot matters little. All you need to know is that Isabella is investigating/making a documentary about her mother, who 20 years earlier murdered three clericals, supposedly while being possessed. Her mother is now in a mental institution in Rome, and so Isabelle goes out to Rome, where she gets to know several priests who are exorcist experts. To tell you more of the plot would be pointless.Couple of comments: for the most part, the movie plays the ""less is more"" card, and pretty effectively at that. However, as has been commented by many other reviewers, I can only echo that the ending indeed is ""as bad as promised"", and just negates the previous 80 minutes in the movie, which is really a shame. You'll just have to see for yourself why. On the plus side, most of the movie is shot in and around Rome and Vatican City, which definitely adds some character to the movie. As  furthern aside, what is with the cover of the DVD jacket? It doesn't even have a real connection with the movie, and surely as about the ugliest cover I've seen in a long time.

Though there are the basic irritants such as the hand held camera documentary style that is begining to get pretty old by now, and the fact that while the acting is pretty good it feels a little bit off the mark at times, it does contain some genuinly realistic possession and exorcism sequences that did manage to get under my skin. No floating bodies here. Nearly no silly deep demon voices, and no cheesy special effects. What you do see is extra special detail paid to what it might be like to witness an actual authentic exorcism. I have seen probably more than 2000 horror films in my lifetime, and have seen everything from the Christopher Lee vampire films to the most taboo horror films such as the very sick and twisted fact based movie 'Cannibal' about a man who puts and add out on the internet looking for someone who is willing to be killed and then systematicaly eatin by him, who then finds a willing subject. So I have seen it all, and I must say this movie did manage to creep me out several times. This is not groundbreaking to any extent but much of it did seem to cross the borders into a rather realistic and often unsettling little movie about exorcism, the catholic church' position on it, and the more realistic look at what real demon posession might be like.

The acting, the production values, the plots, and special effects are really low budget and it shows. I'm not sure why or how these films became so popular. You could shoot one with a few friends on the weekend and call it a movie. My problem is not that they exist. My problem is that movie theaters and film companies charge full price to see them. Granted, I only watch them for free on Amazon Prime or on Netflix, but lots of other people spend the $11 (or more) to go see them at the theater. They can, I guess, be fun for teenagers. However, I find it hard to believe that anyone above 12 actually finds these movies scary. I've sat through a lot of boring air time watching these movies. Essentially almost nothing happens for over an hour and then they try to pack a scare or two in the last 30 minutes. I can only assume that the makers of these films are laughing all the way to the bank. I sincerely hoped The Last Exorcism would be The Last exorcism or that Paranormal Activity would end all activity when it comes to these kinds of movies, but, alas, no. I suspect as long as people keep paying for them, they will continue to be cash cows for the film studios.Here's the thing, I want to be scared. I want a movie to actually make me turn on the lights, but these movies are don't supply any real scares. I'm not a slasher fan (aside for Silence of the Lambs, which was truly disturbing). I like the supernatural stuff. The reality is that exorcisms have been done a lot better in lots of other movies. The bottom line is that I didn't have to watch any of these movies (hence the title of my review), but I figured I should give them a fair chance by actually trying to sit through a few of them. I have to tell you, it's pretty hard.Pet peeve: When people give movies like this 4 or 5 stars.

""The Devil Inside"" was theatrically released and hit the No. 1 at the box office, displacing Tom Cruise's ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol."" While the commercial success of ""The Devil's Inside"" proves the popularity of the found footage genre, the film itself is a huge disappointment because, simply put, the film is just boring.""The Devil Inside"" begins with a murder case involving Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley), who apparently killed two priests and a nun during the exorcism performed on her. Twenty years later, her daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) travels to a hospital in Rome, where Maria was locked in. Isabella attempts to find the truths about the murder with a help from young priests Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth), who perform an unauthorized exorcism.""The Devil Inside"" is not scary. That itself is not a real problem. ""The Last Exorcism"" was not particularly scary, but it at least had a few interesting characters. In ""The Devil Inside"" you have none. We relate to none of the characters that keep talking, and then yelling. The storyline seems contrived. Some of the questions are left unanswered (for the sequel, perhaps).Actors are so desperate trying to look real that it is obvious they are acting. The acting is amateurish, and so is writing.  The abrupt ending (with a brief note from the filmmakers) has been already criticized. What really amazed me is the end credit that rolls so slowly. In short, we feel short-changed.Apparently the film was really shot in Rome.

Whatever possessed the makers of this film to think this was a good project hopefully has been driven out of them by the bad press, bad box office but, more importantly, a good priest performing an exorcism rite. Perhaps the entire inspiration for this film is the fact that the filmmaker bit the inside of his lip and noticed it resembled an inverted cross and the entire film sprang from that.This faux documentary focuses on Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade from The Glades: The Complete First Season and Sons of Anarchy: Season Three)as she and a film crew try to uncover what happened when an exorcism involving her mother went horrible wrong resulting in the murder of three people. The film crew discovers a pair of priests (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth)who are willing to assist them in their pursuit of the truth which, ultimately, results in an attempted exorcism of Isabella's mother (Susan Crowley).The problem with the film isn't the acting nor the production values (although it was produced for a reported $1 million) but, instead, the weak writing/direction itself. There is the germ of a good idea here and it's different enough from all the other films about possession to make for a better film in someone else's hands (and clearly there's enough interest in the material itself as the film made $52 million in theaters).The faux documentary genre has worn thin with increasingly pathetic films. This is the type of junk that I would expect to see on the grammatically challenged Syfy channel.The DVD image quality is, as one would expect, a bit rough but that's part of the look of these type of films. Audio sounds fine with some nice directional use of the 5.1 mix particularly during some of the more action driven sequences.Nothing worthwhile in the special features department although if you do go to the website listed at the conclusion of the film there are some youtube videos that look as cheap an inauthentic as the film itself.""The Devil Inside"" has an interesting idea but poor execution. The actors do a fine job with what they are given to work with and the practical/visual effects aren't bad. I doubt that ""The Devil Inside"" will scare most folks and it doesn't threaten to displace the better horror movies that tackle the same theme.
