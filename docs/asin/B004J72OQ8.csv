It is amazing to see how such a person could accomplish so much in his lifetime giving all the credit to St. Joseph.,4,St. Andre the Humble Servant,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,239,"['book', 'documentary', 'St.', 'Andre', 'life', 'was', 'humble', 'man', 'slight', 'stature', 'huge', 'devotion', 'St.', 'Joseph', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'person', 'could', 'accomplish', 'so', 'much', 'lifetime', 'giving', 'credit', 'St.', 'Joseph']",God's Doorkeeper: St. Andre of Montreal
1411405,AEWA3I5LUA0I4,B004J72OQ8,Peter Dalton,"[1, 1]","The DVD describes the life of Saint Andre Bessette, and his ministry to the down and out of Canada. He was canonised with Saint Mary of the Cross MacKillop, Australia's first saint on Sunday 17th October, 2010. He is the first Canadian man to be canonised by the Roman Catholic Church. He was the doorkeeper to the Holy Cross monastic order in Montreal. He was a very compassionate man. The culmination of his life was the building of Saint Joseph's Oratory, a shrine to the Holy Family on Mont Royal in Montreal. It is widely known that many miraculous healings have been attributed to the virtue of this great man. The DVD also describes 'the red doors', a place of outreach for the homeless, for the vulnerable, and for ex-inmates of Canada's justice system. I strongly recommend this DVD for its insight into  Canadian social justice.",5,God's Doorkeeper: Saint Andre Bessette.,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,838,"['DVD', 'life', 'Saint', 'Andre', 'Bessette', 'ministry', 'down', 'Canada', 'was', 'canonised', 'Saint', 'Mary', 'Cross', 'MacKillop', 'Australia', 'first', 'saint', 'Sunday', '17th', 'October', '2010', 'first', 'Canadian', 'man', 'be', 'canonised', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'was', 'doorkeeper', 'Holy', 'Cross', 'monastic', 'order', 'Montreal', 'was', 'very', 'compassionate', 'man', 'culmination', 'life', 'was', 'building', 'Saint', 'Joseph', 'Oratory', 'shrine', 'Holy', 'Family', 'Mont', 'Royal', 'Montreal', 'widely', 'known', 'many', 'miraculous', 'healings', 'have', 'been', 'attributed', 'virtue', 'great', 'man', 'DVD', 'also', ""'the"", 'red', 'doors', 'place', 'outreach', 'homeless', 'vulnerable', 'ex-inmates', 'Canada', 'justice', 'system', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'insight', 'Canadian', 'social', 'justice']",God's Doorkeeper: St. Andre of Montreal

For everyone familiar with the magnificient St. Joseph's oratory in Montreal, and devotees of the Saint Joseph and St. Andre, this is THE DVD to purchase.This documentary is very detailed and it has interviews with many people,amongst them the Archbishop of Montreal, many who knew the saint either personally or had, at one time in their lives, come across him.It takes us from his childhood days, the personal losses and hardships that he had to face as an orphan, as a young man and until he found his home amidst the members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, again not without difficulties. We learn about the begining of his ministry that would see coutless miracles. We are given a portrait of this man of small stature who was a giant of spirituality and true humility, his down-to-earth personality, wit and sanctity, who daily walked hand-in-hand with St. Joseph.Moreover the interviews with the individuals  mentioned above retell the miracles the he performed in their lives and that in itself is worth purchasing this DVD.A very prominent part of this documentary is given to a group that strives to live the spirituality of this amazing man in ministering to the homeless and the poor.Another wonderful aspect is that the makers have incorporated clips from the Saint's cannonization Mass and the celebratory Masses that were  held both in Rome and Montreal.It also contains many black and white movie clips of the saint from the 1920's (its so cool to see a saint in the'flesh'!)which include scenes from his funeral.A story of total trust in the providence of God, and the assistance of the great Saint Joseph amidst life's long battles, disappointments, and yes even joy. This documentary shows us that heaven is just a prayer awayAll in all, a very useful tool in evangelization or merely to get to know our latest friend in the communion of the saints.",5,Opening heaven's door on earth,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,1985,"['Finally', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'documentary', 'life', 'Canada', 'first', 'male', 'saint', 'North', 'America', 'newest', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'magnificient', 'St.', 'Joseph', 'oratory', 'Montreal', 'devotees', 'Saint', 'Joseph', 'St.', 'Andre', 'DVD', 'purchase.This', 'documentary', 'very', 'detailed', 'interviews', 'many', 'people', 'amongst', 'Archbishop', 'Montreal', 'many', 'who', 'knew', 'saint', 'personally', 'had', 'one', 'time', 'lives', 'come', 'him.It', 'childhood', 'days', 'personal', 'losses', 'hardships', 'had', 'face', 'orphan', 'young', 'man', 'found', 'home', 'members', 'Congregation', 'Holy', 'Cross', 'again', 'not', 'difficulties', 'learn', 'begining', 'ministry', 'would', 'see', 'coutless', 'miracles', 'are', 'given', 'portrait', 'man', 'small', 'stature', 'who', 'was', 'giant', 'spirituality', 'true', 'humility', 'down-to-earth', 'personality', 'wit', 'sanctity', 'who', 'daily', 'walked', 'hand-in-hand', 'St.', 'Joseph.Moreover', 'interviews', 'individuals', 'mentioned', 'retell', 'miracles', 'performed', 'lives', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'DVD.A', 'very', 'prominent', 'part', 'documentary', 'given', 'group', 'live', 'spirituality', 'amazing', 'man', 'ministering', 'homeless', 'poor.Another', 'wonderful', 'aspect', 'makers', 'have', 'incorporated', 'clips', 'Saint', 'cannonization', 'Mass', 'celebratory', 'Masses', 'were', 'held', 'Rome', 'Montreal.It', 'also', 'many', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'clips', 'saint', '1920', 'so', 'cool', 'see', 'saint', ""the'flesh"", 'include', 'scenes', 'funeral.A', 'story', 'total', 'trust', 'providence', 'God', 'assistance', 'great', 'Saint', 'Joseph', 'amidst', 'life', 'long', 'battles', 'disappointments', 'yes', 'even', 'joy', 'documentary', 'heaven', 'just', 'prayer', 'awayAll', 'very', 'useful', 'tool', 'evangelization', 'merely', 'get', 'know', 'latest', 'friend', 'communion', 'saints']",God's Doorkeeper: St. Andre of Montreal
