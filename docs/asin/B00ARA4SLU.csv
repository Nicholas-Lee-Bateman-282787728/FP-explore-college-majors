Peering into old Hollywood and the stars of yesteryear always delights with its  speculative nature. ""Hitchcock"" starts off with the director already inhabiting his celebrity, so you will not be watching a bio of the man. Anthony Hopkins who plays the title role never sold Hitchcock to me. And, being that I could not even find a hint of facial connection to the famed director, the loss was even greater. Of course Hopkins is a great actor, but the performance was contrived to the point where I felt it was a ""I will now do my Hitchcock imitation"", which isn't all bad, it just is what it is. Hitch's wife Emma played by the talented Helen Mirren was in counter a charming, possibly unrealistic, encapsulating portrayal of a lesser known figure.Watching the origins of the Psycho film play out before you is like putting puzzle pieces together. What shape goes where? Unfortunately there's a little too much TV movie style assembly which detracted from any theatrical magic happenings. There is a bulls-eye Anthony Perkins portrayal, a cardboard Vera Miles incarnation (intentional?) and a Janet Leigh physical upgrade (Scarlett Johanson) topped with a dead on hairdo. A standout is Hitch's secretary who has just the right glossy eye rolls and bewildered demeanor. Finally the (Paramount) picture head antagonist role safely keeps the caricature alive and well. If you want it all to fit, it will. If your missing pieces just push anything together to get this flexible bit of fun working.Psycho (the book) apparently derived some weird ideas from Hitch's dream mentor in the film, serial killer Ed Gein, which trickles in through the film in an attempt at creativity that falls flat on it's face. One of those ""just not necessary"" moves the slows the cinematic movement to a near kill.If you can get past it's scripty deliveries and hindering insertions, ""Hitchcock"" is an effective period piece that quickly whips figures into shape while holding just as fast to it's rather purposely morose intentions. Its a capable showing of entertainment and the endeavor is commendable, enabling me to toss out my, ""for The Birds"" title in favor of a more ""review-esque"" film title from one of Hitch's less notables.",3,"""I Confess""",1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,2344,"['hear', 'name', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'check', 'out', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'odd', 'entertaining', 'Peering', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'yesteryear', 'always', 'delights', 'speculative', 'nature', 'Hitchcock', 'director', 'already', 'inhabiting', 'celebrity', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'bio', 'man', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'title', 'role', 'never', 'sold', 'Hitchcock', 'being', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'find', 'hint', 'facial', 'connection', 'famed', 'director', 'loss', 'was', 'even', 'greater', 'course', 'Hopkins', 'great', 'actor', 'performance', 'was', 'contrived', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'will', 'now', 'do', 'Hitchcock', 'imitation', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'what', 'Hitch', 'wife', 'Emma', 'played', 'talented', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'was', 'counter', 'charming', 'possibly', 'unrealistic', 'encapsulating', 'portrayal', 'lesser', 'known', 'figure.Watching', 'origins', 'Psycho', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'putting', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'together', 'What', 'shape', 'where', 'Unfortunately', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'TV', 'movie', 'style', 'assembly', 'detracted', 'theatrical', 'magic', 'happenings', 'bulls-eye', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'portrayal', 'cardboard', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'incarnation', 'intentional', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'physical', 'upgrade', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'topped', 'dead', 'hairdo', 'standout', 'Hitch', 'secretary', 'who', 'just', 'right', 'glossy', 'eye', 'rolls', 'bewildered', 'demeanor', 'Finally', 'Paramount', 'picture', 'head', 'antagonist', 'role', 'safely', 'caricature', 'alive', 'well', 'want', 'fit', 'will', 'missing', 'pieces', 'just', 'push', 'anything', 'together', 'get', 'flexible', 'bit', 'fun', 'working.Psycho', 'book', 'apparently', 'derived', 'weird', 'ideas', 'Hitch', 'dream', 'mentor', 'film', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'film', 'attempt', 'creativity', 'flat', 'face', 'One', 'just', 'not', 'necessary', 'slows', 'cinematic', 'movement', 'near', 'kill.If', 'can', 'get', 'scripty', 'deliveries', 'hindering', 'insertions', 'Hitchcock', 'effective', 'period', 'piece', 'quickly', 'figures', 'shape', 'holding', 'just', 'fast', 'rather', 'purposely', 'morose', 'intentions', 'capable', 'showing', 'entertainment', 'endeavor', 'commendable', 'enabling', 'toss', 'out', 'Birds', 'title', 'favor', 'more', 'review-esque', 'film', 'title', 'one', 'Hitch', 'less', 'notables']",Hitchcock
1616179,A315R030KOP73P,B00ARA4SLU,Alexander Miley,"[0, 2]","That was my first thought after viewing this film. A large part of 'Hitchcock's' troubles lie in the fact that the team behind it could not find a singular voice. Is this a docu-drama on the making of Psycho? A commentary on Hitchcock's strange mental state? A torrid romance picture about he and his wife, Alma, and their marriage difficulties? Or was it just another episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents? No, 'Hitchcock' decided it wanted to be all of these things.The trouble with this lack of focus is the movie couldn't go very deep in any regard. I gleamed little detail from the production around Psycho or even about Hitchcock himself. The script was soft from beginning to end, and albeit easily watchable, my final take was of disappointment. The acting is fine, however. Helen Mirren could be called the British Meryl Streep because she is absolutely thrilling in any project she partakes in. Jessica Biel was particularly interesting to watch as Vera Miles; I would almost be willing to tag her as the scene-stealer in 'Hitchcock.' Scarlett Johansson was bland and forgettable and Anthony Hopkins take on the formidable Hitchcock was overbearing at times, playing to almost comedic effect, which certainly did not help the loose focus of the movie. After the smoke clears and the dust is settled, 'Hitchcock' proves to be just another cinema dud.

Anthony Hopkins, literally transforms himself and Helen Mirren gives the movie the depth as Alma Reville,the neglected but supportive partner of the often jealous Hitchcock. Alma was not just his wife but his creative partner as she gave creative inputs that the classic shower scene with Janet Leigh be scored with piercing violins by Bernard Herrmann.Hitchcock was a famous director but decides to gamble his reputation and talent by placing his bets on a movie that no one wanted to finance, so he ended financing it himself.We get some details that went into its making but I wish there were many more, the voyeurism of Hitchcock and his eventual acceptance of his wifes creative talent were good scenes.

1616184,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00ARA4SLU,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I'm a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock.  I think most people are, or even if they aren't they can certainly appreciate the impact he's had on film in general.  Fewer names are as known as Hitchcock's, and fewer films are as associated with that name as `Psycho'.  So, when you have a film devoted to exposing what went on behind the scenes of the filming of that monumental film, you have my attention.Sadly, this doesn't all work out like I had expected.The film shuffles a few angles to try and compose a well-rounded look at Hitch and his process, but it doesn't all come together like it thinks it does.  Opening with a shot of Ed Gein killing his brother and then having Hitchcock infamously narrate the proceedings, `Hitchcock' opens with promise.  Moving from there to the aftermath of success from Hitchcock's `North by Northwest' and the struggle to find something new and exciting, we see him set his sights on `Psycho', a novel inspired by Gein's killings and something far too violent and grisly for Paramount to accept.  So, Hitchcock decides to fund it himself, and he goes to work.  We see his relationship with his wife, Alma, and her need to more recognition and purpose and the fact that her friend Whitfield Cook continually tries to woo her.  We see his onset antics, his paternal relationship with Leigh and his vile contempt for Vera Miles.  We see him fight with his inner demons as well as the studio, and yet it all feels so thankless.That is really the only word that comes to mind when I think of this film.  It's thankless.  Nothing really stands out as noteworthy, other than those sets and costumes.  The performances are uniformly decent, but no one really stands out other than maybe Mirren, who shades Alma in a way that feels lived in.  Johansson, Biel, Collette and D'Arcy are barely there at all, Huston is certainly a stereotype with little meat to hold him together and Hopkins looks too much like DeVito's Penguin to make much of a real impact.  The interwoven storylines, particularly those involving Gein, serve as an interesting concept and yet don't really add much to the overall film itself.  I felt like Hitch was never really explored.  All of the horror stories revolving around his domineering, egotistical and sexist ways was never presented as anything more than a fleeting possibility.  It is far too sentimental a film to have much bite.I loved the idea of it being a comedic take on the man, full of cheeky fun and insight and yet it just felt bland and uninteresting.",2,Doesn't do the man justice...,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,2518,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'can', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'impact', 'had', 'film', 'general', 'Fewer', 'names', 'are', 'as', 'known', 'Hitchcock', 'fewer', 'films', 'are', 'associated', 'name', 'Psycho', 'So', 'when', 'have', 'film', 'devoted', 'exposing', 'what', 'went', 'scenes', 'filming', 'monumental', 'film', 'have', 'attention.Sadly', ""n't"", 'work', 'had', 'expected.The', 'film', 'few', 'angles', 'try', 'compose', 'well-rounded', 'look', 'Hitch', 'process', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'Opening', 'shot', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'killing', 'brother', 'then', 'having', 'Hitchcock', 'infamously', 'narrate', 'proceedings', 'Hitchcock', 'opens', 'promise', 'Moving', 'there', 'aftermath', 'success', 'Hitchcock', 'North', 'Northwest', 'struggle', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'exciting', 'see', 'set', 'sights', 'Psycho', 'novel', 'inspired', 'Gein', 'killings', 'something', 'far', 'too', 'violent', 'grisly', 'Paramount', 'accept', 'So', 'Hitchcock', 'fund', 'work', 'see', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Alma', 'need', 'more', 'recognition', 'purpose', 'fact', 'friend', 'Whitfield', 'Cook', 'continually', 'woo', 'see', 'onset', 'antics', 'paternal', 'relationship', 'Leigh', 'vile', 'contempt', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'see', 'fight', 'inner', 'demons', 'as', 'well', 'studio', 'yet', 'feels', 'thankless.That', 'really', 'only', 'word', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'film', 'thankless', 'Nothing', 'really', 'out', 'noteworthy', 'other', 'sets', 'costumes', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'decent', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'other', 'maybe', 'Mirren', 'who', 'Alma', 'way', 'lived', 'Johansson', 'Biel', 'Collette', ""D'Arcy"", 'are', 'barely', 'there', 'Huston', 'certainly', 'stereotype', 'little', 'meat', 'hold', 'together', 'Hopkins', 'too', 'much', 'DeVito', 'Penguin', 'make', 'much', 'real', 'impact', 'interwoven', 'storylines', 'particularly', 'involving', 'Gein', 'serve', 'interesting', 'concept', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'overall', 'film', 'felt', 'Hitch', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'explored', 'horror', 'stories', 'revolving', 'domineering', 'egotistical', 'sexist', 'ways', 'was', 'never', 'presented', 'anything', 'more', 'fleeting', 'possibility', 'far', 'too', 'sentimental', 'film', 'have', 'much', 'bite.I', 'loved', 'idea', 'being', 'comedic', 'take', 'man', 'full', 'cheeky', 'fun', 'insight', 'yet', 'just', 'felt', 'bland', 'uninteresting']",Hitchcock
1616185,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00ARA4SLU,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","Alfred Hitchcock has become a larger than life figure. The shooting and production of what is perhaps his Magnum Opus -Psycho, has become the stuff of cinema legend. And, as with most legends, the truth is often obscured by myths or fables. Sadly, this is what happens with HITCHCOCK, the otherwise very enjoyable and light film from directorSacha Gervasi, who gives us a stellar cast and excellent cinematography.Anthony Hopkinsis almost unrecognizable in heavy prosthetics and a fat-suit. The Oscar winning thespian absolutely NAILS Hitchcock's eccentric mannerisms and quirks, and the accent is spot on. Hopkins brings Hitch's signature dark humor and wit to the film (""Try the finger sandwiches, ma'am. They're real fingers.""), and boosts it with his chameleonic talent. This is one of cinema's greatest actors, and he is having a great time here.Helen Mirrengives a excellent, and at times comedic, performance, a worthy counterpart to Hopkins's scene-stealing Hitchcock.Scarlett Johanssonplays a fine scream queen, but is far too pretty and not ""60's"" enough to play Hitchcock's Blonde Janet Leigh. But still not a bad performance at any rate. Jessica Biel and Danny Huston play their roles well, but it is James D'Arcy who absolutely _mesmerizes_ as Anthony Perkins; perfectly capturing Tony's nervous, boy-next-door charms while harbouring his darker, troubled psyche.On the whole, it is HITCHCOCK's fine, distinguished cast that elevates this above your average biopic. Good performances all round, and shoutouts and kudos to Sir Anthony and James D'Arcy! Other pros include great, retro cinematography, a good score and a light, airy, entertaining pace and tone. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with touches of black humour and odes to other Hitchcock films. The costumes and makeup (especially Hopkins's getup) are top notch, nabbing a deserved Oscar nod.Let's talk cons.So very little of what ""happens"" in this movie ABOUT the shooting of Psycho in 1960 is true. The infamous and utterly brilliant Shower Scene takes the brunt of the blows. Lies and myths abound, from Hitch's usage of cold water to make Leigh scream, to Saul Bass's direction of the scene, to Hitch himself wielding the knife, to even worse; tales of voyeurism, cruelty, obsession, and various odious behaviours. This is simply untrue, and pictures such as HITCHCOCK and THE GIRL paint an inaccurate portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock, arguably the greatest director that cinema has ever seen, or indeed, ever will see.The screenplay isn't even as ""revealing"" or ""eye-opening"" or ""deep"" as it should be, or thinks it should be, but the result is a light-hearted biopic rather than a heavy one. Another point that I did not like was the inclusion of the scenes with horrific serial killer Ed Gein (basis for Leatherface, Hannibal Lecter, Buffalo Bill, and worse). They didn't really fit the tone of the story, and all the ""demons"" they tried to give Hitchcock came off as cheesy.But that's not to say I didn't enjoy the film. I did immensely! We need more biopics of classic film directors, and the light-hearted, breezy approach that Sacha Gervasi takes should be applauded, even if the inaccuracies shouldn't. Anthony Hopkins and his distinguished supporting cast give superb performances, and the result is a film, that if not up to Hitch's usual standards, should still be an enjoyable night at the movies.

Perhaps even liked more than &#34;Hitchcock,&#34; although it is closer than I thought it would be.Toby Jones gave an amazing performance as Afred Hitchcock in &#34;The Girl,&#34; which wasn't completely surprising after I watched the movie &#34;Infamous,&#34; a film that I recommend over both of these by a bit.  In &#34;Infamous,&#34; Mr. Jones outdid Philip Seymour Hoffman in &#34;Capote&#34; and as Capote, which was a surprise to me.  At any rate, I wanted to compare Anthony Hopkins interpretation of Mr. Hitchcock to Mr. Jones', and surely neither disappoints.  While I have an opinion on who &#34;won,&#34; it was so close really that it doesn't matter.This film though is a more sympathetic take on Hitchcock than &#34;The Girl.&#34;  In that film, Mr. Hitchcock's legacy takes quite a beating, although Mr. Jones played him so well that it was still really good.  Here, Mr. Hitchcock is surely treated with more respect, although he is still shown as a flawed character.  Which film did I like better?  Well, once again, I have an opinion but it is so close it doesn't matter.One minor compaint:  the character listing seems to bury Toni Collette, although it prominently features Scarlett Johansson.  In my opinion, Ms. Collette is a better actress -- she really doesn't get the kudos that she so often deserves -- and this bothered me a bit.  However, Ms. Johansson, whom I've been a little hit-and-miss on over her career (I still like her the best in &#34;The Horse Whisperer&#34; and &#34;Lost in Translation&#34;), was actually an excellent casting choice here.I highly recommend both of these films about Mr. Hitchcock.

Today she would be credited as a writer on the movie, at the very least. But Alma was content with her life.  She did exactly as she pleased and was an admired and talented woman.  Only the insiders knew about her but they valued her.  Mirren convinced me she was this character.Anthony Hopkins successfully recreates Hitchcock.  He both looks and sounds like him.  But there aren't any big surprises with his role. He is pretty much everything you already knew about Hitchcock. However, he does it very well but the movie wouldn't have been very interesting had it been just he playing Hitchcock.There is a great deal of humor in the movie too but it is that low key British humor so you have to be attuned to it.  For example, when the screenwriter interviews with Hitch, he is late as he just left his daily appointment with his shrink.  Hitch doesn't think much of this info UNTIL the young man mentions the things he is talking about in it, especially about his mother. Hitch hires him on the spot and the next thing we know, he is seeing the shrink too! (The mother, Mrs. Bates, is key to the film PSYCHO, which is when the movie is set.) Hitch also interviews Anthony Perkins for the role of Norman Bates and that has its humorous moments as well. He tells Hitch he'd like to do PSYCHO as he doesn't want to get typed by the romantic parts he currently is playing for the studio. (The joke here is that after PSYCHO no one could ever see Perkins again as anyone but Norman Bates.) As they talk about Perkins' inner psyche, it turns out he too has a lot of issues about his mother.  After this talk, Hitch correctly guesses Perkins is bisexual or gay (this was true. Although married and with children, Perkins also was attracted to men and contracted HIV-AIDS and died of it at the height of the AIDS crisis). Norman Bates is supposed to be gay even though that is never said straight out in the film.Scarlett Johannssen and Jessica Biel nail Janet Leigh and Vera Miles respectively.  Everyone looks remarkably like their real life counterparts.If this were not a year awash in fabulous films, I might think this would do well on the awards circuit.  Mirren may even so.

In fact, it came out in general release and disappeared shortly thereafter. Fortunately, I got to see it before it disappeared from theaters.The focus if this story is the making of Hitchcock's Psycho. Even for the Master of Macabre this film was viewed as a horrific mistake from inception. No one thought it would make much of a movie and that sentiment was shared by Hitchcock's biggest supporter former film editor Alma Reville/Mrs. Hitchcock. Eventually, his wife did come around to share his vision.As a lover of film and a one-time seven year old whose Grandma took her to see Psycho first run, I thought this was a wonderful premise for a movie. While I had already read the book on which this movie was based, I thought this movie might have better explained the challenges Hitchcock faced while attempting to make Psycho. However, what impressed me was Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hitchcock. While that might have evolved into a parody of the original, Hopkins really stood up to the task of being Hitchcock. The subtle nuances and the gait were there. Hopkins did a remarkable job of transforming himself into the character. Helen Mirren, based on all reports re: Alma, was excellent as the skeptical spouse who bought into her husband's vision which became his obsession.I enjoyed this film a lot.

I found myself hearing Hopkins and not Hitchcock.  There wasn't much magic or stylish attributes that are typical of the actual Hitchcock movies.  Nothing was really revealed about Hitchcock's life other than this short time period of the late '50's, early '60's.  We didn't get to see him as a family man or his rise to exceptional director.  I wanted to know more about him, not just the battle to get Psycho to the screen.  What was nice was learning more about his wife, Alma, portrayed wonderfully by Helen Mirren.  The other lead actors, Scarlett Johansson  and Jessica Biel were spot on and deftly cast. In particular, Scarlett Johansson as Jamie Lee Curtis' mother was outstanding and captured the spirit of Janet Lee.

1616230,A30E2YL894IX7Y,B00ARA4SLU,D. Doppes,"[19, 23]","***** Spoiler Alert**********4 1/2 stars- a great filmHaving read many of the more famous movie critics pick this film apart, I still had a great desire to see this film. The subject matter and actors made this a must see for the 2012 film season in my book. The first problem was the limited amount of theaters showing the film. I actually had to wait for it to show up at a discount theater, which is where I viewed the film today. The long wait and the negative reviews were all brushed aside as I saw Alfred Hitchcock before my eyes- courtesy of Anthony Hopkins.Hopkins no doubt, spent endless hours learning how to speak and act like Mr. Hitchcock. It wasn't just his voice that comes across as authentic, its also some of his poses and glances. I had even heard some rumblings about the choice of Hopkins to play the famous director. There is no doubt that this selection was the right one. Its easy to try and find problems with someone who is portraying an icon. But make no mistake Hopkin's delivers in his best role in recent memory.Many of us grew up watching Hitch on his tv program reruns. As a nice touch in the film it starts and ends like one of his television shows- with Hitchcock's classic comments about what we are going to see and what we have just witnessed. The film shows us the behind the scenes making of Psycho and all that went right and wrong in the process. What to do when Paramount doesn't want to finance your new film? A disgruntled actress at the end of her contract has to co-exist with Mr.Hitchock. There are problems with the Hitchcock marriage. Many things are going on and yet, Hitchcock with the help of Alma (Hellen Mirren)pull things together their way.Hellen Mirren  is incredible as Mrs.Hitchock- Alma. She should be up for an oscar and would deserve the victory if it comes here way. Having to deal with the demands of being married to the most famous director in the world and having her own dreams weighs on her mind. She strives to find a balance between the two. And its her help that was the extra push for many of Hitchcock's films. One of the best scenes in the film is when Mirren tells Hitchock how it is in a frustrated outburst. It lasts for several moments as Alfred stands and stares without a word to say. One of those signature scenes that you will always remember an actor/actress for. And this was Mirren's moment.Not to be forgotten are some of the supporting actors/actresses. Scarlet Johannson plays Janet Leigh very effectively. And she delivers on another great moment and one of films great scenes- the shower scene of Psycho. I don't know if it was rehearsed many times or on one take, but it was really well done. Vera Miles was played by Jessica Beil. Although she didn't have a lot of scenes, she was good as the actress who disappointed Hitchcock for having a family, when Hitch wanted to make her a star.So I would suggest watching the film with an open mind. Especially if you have read some of the reviews that I did.  If you are a Hitchcock fan this is a no-brainer. You will love the behind the scenes take on Mr.Hitchcock and his wife. And just how many drinks did he have during the film? The best scene in the film for me is almost at the very end. When the crowd is watching his finished masterpiece. He listens outside the door and conducts the screams like the maestro that he was.

I found his performance uneven and a few times his voice sounded more like Hannibal Lector than Hitchcock.  Having seen most of Hopkins' films, this is the first time in decades I wasn't wowed by his performance.  Helen Mirren steals the show as Alma Hitchcock, the woman behind the man who never got the credit she rightfully deserved.  Mirren is strong and subtle, while Hopkins overacts and turns Hitch into somewhat of a caricature.

It affords another opportunity for Anthony Hopkins to give one of his bravura performances in the central role.  In truth, he does not look much like Hitch, but he captures the voice inflections very well.  As Alma Reville, Helen Mirren does not have too much to do, other than to demonstrate her loyalty to her husband, despite his unhealthy obsessions with his leading ladies.  In this film, it is Janet Leigh (played with calm authority by Scarlett Johansson).  The film suggests that much of the violence in PSYCHO stemmed from Hitchcock's own sexual frustrations; there is one sequence in particular, showing the director scaring the understudy to death as he performs the stabbing in the now-legendary shower scene.  Another interesting aspect of the film is the link drawn between the protagonist of Bloch's novel - that provided the source for PSYCHO - and Hitchcock's stage of mind at the time of filming it.  On this view, PSYCHO is one of his most personal films.  The film begins and ends with the music from ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, in a move designed to appeal to nostalgia buffs.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Alfred Hitchcock is rightly regarded as one of the greatest movie directors of all time, and ""Psycho"" is rightly regarded as one of his greatest films.So how better to tell the story than with a light, tongue-in-cheek tale about Hitchcock's marital woes and battles with the studio? ""Hitchcock"" is a fun movie with some genuinely brilliant acting, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, and it does show us how even the greatest have to fight for their art. But it also shies away from any kind of depth.In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins) had another runaway success with ""North by Northwest,"" but is bothered by a reporter's implication that his best work is behind him. While the studios offer him their best (such as adapting ""Casino Royale""), Hitchcock wants to reclaim the raw artistic thrill of his younger days. So he decides to adapt a bestselling horror novel, ""Psycho.""His wife Alma (Mirren) quickly warms to the idea, despite wanting to do her own writing projects with her friend Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston). But the studio balks, forcing Hitchcock to finance the movie with his own money.But Alma is soon annoyed by studio meddling and Hitchcock's constant ogling of the beautiful blonde Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). Hitchcock begins to suspect that Alma is having an affair with Whit, and the stress takes a toll on both his health and the movie shoot. At the same time, he is plagued with insecurities about the movie's future, and whether it will sink his career.Hitchcock is a man who is still something of an enigma today, but ""Hitchcock"" doesn't really try to explore him in any depth. Instead, it dances between the Hitchcocks' marital problems and the trials of making a movie that no studio wants anything to do with -- and it does it with a wry, witty touch that borders on comedy without ever quite crossing the line.The writing tends to be airy and clever, especially when the writers dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (""By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,"" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work). In fact, he's at his most charming when he's lighthearted, such as the little stabby dance he does outside the theater on opening night.However, I felt that ""Hitchcock"" avoided handling its story with any depth. The marital spat is cleared up too quickly and cleanly, and his controlling nature towards the ""Hitchcock blondes"" is briefly touched on but never really explored. And Hitchcock's conversations with an imaginary Ed Gein seemed strangely out of sync with the tone of the overall movie.But Hopkins plays Hitchcock as a genial, witty man with some darker sides, and he mimics Hitchcock's speech and body language nicely. On the flipside, Mirren plays Alma as a fiery, intelligent woman who is content to remain in her husband's shadow, but also wants to be appreciated for it. And James D'Arcy and Scarlett Johansson do fine smaller roles as Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.""Hitchcock"" is not a bad movie, just a lightweight one -- excellent acting, a somewhat flimsy story, and plenty of behind-the-scenes woes for a now-beloved movie.

Helen Mirren as his wife shows she was emotionally involved with another man but took her husband to task for being too obsessive with his lead actresses. The couple worked best together as she was an editor of her husbands films and the music of the shower scene was shown to be her idea. Scarlett Johannson as janet leigh was well cast but she should have been seen more involved in the movie. She was what drove the original film. Hardly any time was spent on the acting of Bates and the addition of Hitchcock talking to a ghost of Bein was odd. The film was in limited release so many people did not get to see this.

Perhaps it's his overly deliberate line readings or the artificiality of the latex prosthetics or the vivid memory I have of the real filmmaker, but some combination of those factors prevented me from fully accepting Hopkins as Hitchcock. That's a shame since Helen Mirren, who plays Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville, which if this story is to be believed, was the master filmmaker's muse and confidant, is quite effective in conveying the stringent manner of her influential character while revealing Alma's aching vulnerability in having to live in her husband's considerable shadow. Loosely based on Stephen Rebello's meticulously researched 1990 bookAlfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the screenplay has been adapted by John J. Laughlin (Black Swan) to focus more on the relationship between Hitchcock and Alma rather than the production ofPsychoitself.Director Sacha Gervasi takes the same granular approach that Simon Curtis did withMy Week With Marilynand Steven Spielberg did with ""Lincoln"", i.e., focus on a specific time period in the subject's life and let those events speak to what motivated the character throughout his or her life. However, unlike those films, Gervasi doesn't adequately reveal what made the rule-breaking filmmaker a genius in his field. The challenging production of ""Psycho"" is handled superficially, even the shower scene is given a cursory glance with lackadaisical intercutting of other characters showing how anger manifested itself in Hitchcock. There are also imaginary interludes that show him receiving advice from convicted serial killer Ed Gein, the real-life inspiration for Norman Bates, on how to stage the more gruesome scenes. What does receive a lot of attention is Hitchcock's relationship with Alma and how instrumental her sharp editing skills were in distilling the more memorable moments of the film.Her sense of self-worth is shaken enough by Hitchcock's self-absorption that she is easily seduced by the unbridled attention of smarmy screenwriter Whitfield Cook who wants to collaborate with her on his next big-screen project. Meanwhile, casting Janet Leigh in the film unexpectedly brings out the director's tender side as castmate Vera Miles reflects a barely concealed bitterness for having been a Grace Kelly-like Hitchcock prot&eacute;g&eacute; now reduced to a supporting role to complete her contract. Neither Gervasi nor Laughlin can seem to make all these intertwining storylines resonate beyond a reasonable evocation of the period. Beyond Hopkins and Mirren, there are good albeit underdeveloped performances from Scarlett Johansson as Leigh and Jessica Biel as Miles, neither of whom bears much resemblance to their real-life counterparts. James D'Arcy, however, manages to capture Anthony Perkins' callow nervousness in just a few brief minutes of screen time. All in all, it's an interesting piece of film trivia that falls short of its goal of being something more.",3,"Evocative Yet Superficial Look at Hitchcock When He Struggled for Relevance with ""Psycho""",1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,3112,"['fine', 'actor', 'acumen', 'vocal', 'mimicry', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'somehow', 'mark', 'impersonating', 'legendary', 'director', '2012', 'biopic', 'Perhaps', 'overly', 'deliberate', 'line', 'readings', 'artificiality', 'latex', 'prosthetics', 'vivid', 'memory', 'have', 'real', 'filmmaker', 'combination', 'factors', 'prevented', 'fully', 'accepting', 'Hopkins', 'Hitchcock', 'shame', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'Hitchcock', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Reville', 'story', 'be', 'believed', 'was', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'muse', 'confidant', 'quite', 'effective', 'conveying', 'stringent', 'manner', 'influential', 'character', 'revealing', 'Alma', 'aching', 'vulnerability', 'having', 'live', 'husband', 'considerable', 'shadow', 'Loosely', 'based', 'Stephen', 'Rebello', 'meticulously', 'researched', '1990', 'bookAlfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Making', 'Psycho', 'screenplay', 'been', 'adapted', 'John', 'J.', 'Laughlin', 'Black', 'Swan', 'focus', 'more', 'relationship', 'Hitchcock', 'Alma', 'rather', 'production', 'ofPsychoitself.Director', 'Sacha', 'Gervasi', 'same', 'granular', 'approach', 'Simon', 'Curtis', 'did', 'withMy', 'Week', 'Marilynand', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'Lincoln', 'i.e.', 'focus', 'specific', 'time', 'period', 'subject', 'life', 'let', 'events', 'speak', 'what', 'motivated', 'character', 'life', 'However', 'films', 'Gervasi', ""n't"", 'adequately', 'reveal', 'what', 'made', 'rule-breaking', 'filmmaker', 'genius', 'field', 'challenging', 'production', 'Psycho', 'handled', 'superficially', 'even', 'shower', 'scene', 'given', 'cursory', 'glance', 'lackadaisical', 'intercutting', 'other', 'characters', 'showing', 'how', 'anger', 'manifested', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'also', 'imaginary', 'interludes', 'show', 'receiving', 'advice', 'convicted', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'real-life', 'inspiration', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'how', 'stage', 'more', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'What', 'receive', 'lot', 'attention', 'Hitchcock', 'relationship', 'Alma', 'how', 'instrumental', 'sharp', 'editing', 'skills', 'were', 'distilling', 'more', 'memorable', 'moments', 'film.Her', 'sense', 'self-worth', 'shaken', 'enough', 'Hitchcock', 'self-absorption', 'easily', 'seduced', 'unbridled', 'attention', 'smarmy', 'screenwriter', 'Whitfield', 'Cook', 'who', 'collaborate', 'next', 'big-screen', 'project', 'Meanwhile', 'casting', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'out', 'director', 'tender', 'side', 'castmate', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'barely', 'concealed', 'bitterness', 'having', 'been', 'Grace', 'Kelly-like', 'Hitchcock', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'now', 'reduced', 'supporting', 'role', 'complete', 'contract', 'Gervasi', 'Laughlin', 'can', 'seem', 'make', 'intertwining', 'storylines', 'resonate', 'reasonable', 'evocation', 'period', 'Beyond', 'Hopkins', 'Mirren', 'are', 'good', 'underdeveloped', 'performances', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Leigh', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Miles', 'neither', 'whom', 'bears', 'much', 'resemblance', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'however', 'capture', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'callow', 'nervousness', 'just', 'few', 'brief', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'interesting', 'piece', 'film', 'trivia', 'short', 'goal', 'being', 'something', 'more']",Hitchcock
1616249,A3A8P8IBH7L1WW,B00ARA4SLU,Edward,"[0, 4]","The planning and completion of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ""Psycho"" is the subject of the new movie ""Hitchcock"", directed by Sacha Gervasi and starring Anthony Hopkins as the legendary director with Helen Mirren as his long-suffering wife Alma Reville. How much of the picture is authentic and how much fantasy can only be guessed, John McLaughlin's script cleverly imagining Hitchcock haunted by the legend of Ed Gein, author Robert Bloch's protoype for Norman Bates; but Hopkins really bears no resemblance to Hitchcock (the sly charm isn't there) and Scarlett Johansson looks nothing like his specially-billed star Janet Leigh. Because Alma was always a background presence (and her lack of recognition becomes an important plot element here), Helen Mirren's lack of resemblance is not really that essential. According to Janet Leigh in the book she wrote recalling her experience of the filming, the set of ""Psycho"" was light-hearted and friendly, but you would never guess that from ""Hitchcock"", because the mood appears to be consistently unhappy. For instance in one scene Hopkins in the role of Hitchcock mocks the talent of John Gavin, a surprising revelation considering that Gavin is still alive. Hitchcock's dismissive attitude towards Vera Miles is explained to a curious Janet Leigh: he had slated Miles to play the lead in ""Vertigo"" but shortly before shooting was to commence Miles got pregnant (by her then-husband, a baby-faced Tarzan), leaving Hitchcock Madeleine-less, Judy-less, and furious. Writer Joseph Stefano, designer Saul Bass, even star Anthony Perkins only appear briefly, the latter significantly naming ""Rope"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" as his two favorite Hitchcocks. And judging from this screenplay, you would never know that the Hitchcocks had a grown daughter, one who was given a small role in ""Psycho"": Patricia Hitchcock is never mentioned. Fans hoping for an inside look at the technical aspects of ""Psycho"" will probably be disappointed. The shower bath scene is handled rather perfunctorily, and it's not clear that it took up so much of the shooting schedule; there is only a brief scene of Marion Crane ""driving"" in front of a rear-projection screen, Hitchcock yelling insults at the character from behind camera; and the melon contest, with casaba the winner, would have been interesting but is ignored. The fact is ""Hitchcock"" never gets deeply involved in the production so that basically this is just a brisk, somewhat gossipy story of a classic filming.",3,Dreaming up a nightmare,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2504,"['planning', 'completion', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1960', 'film', 'Psycho', 'subject', 'new', 'movie', 'Hitchcock', 'directed', 'Sacha', 'Gervasi', 'starring', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'legendary', 'director', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Reville', 'How', 'much', 'picture', 'authentic', 'how', 'much', 'fantasy', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'guessed', 'John', 'McLaughlin', 'script', 'cleverly', 'imagining', 'Hitchcock', 'haunted', 'legend', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'author', 'Robert', 'Bloch', 'protoype', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Hopkins', 'really', 'resemblance', 'Hitchcock', 'sly', 'charm', ""n't"", 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'nothing', 'specially-billed', 'star', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Alma', 'was', 'always', 'background', 'presence', 'lack', 'recognition', 'important', 'plot', 'element', 'here', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'lack', 'resemblance', 'not', 'really', 'essential', 'According', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'book', 'wrote', 'recalling', 'experience', 'filming', 'set', 'Psycho', 'was', 'light-hearted', 'friendly', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'Hitchcock', 'mood', 'be', 'consistently', 'unhappy', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'role', 'Hitchcock', 'talent', 'John', 'Gavin', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'considering', 'Gavin', 'still', 'alive', 'Hitchcock', 'dismissive', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'explained', 'curious', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'had', 'slated', 'Miles', 'play', 'lead', 'Vertigo', 'shortly', 'shooting', 'was', 'commence', 'Miles', 'got', 'pregnant', 'then-husband', 'baby-faced', 'Tarzan', 'leaving', 'Hitchcock', 'Madeleine-less', 'Judy-less', 'furious', 'Writer', 'Joseph', 'Stefano', 'designer', 'Saul', 'Bass', 'even', 'star', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'only', 'appear', 'briefly', 'latter', 'significantly', 'naming', 'Rope', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'two', 'favorite', 'Hitchcocks', 'judging', 'screenplay', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'Hitchcocks', 'had', 'grown', 'daughter', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'small', 'role', 'Psycho', 'Patricia', 'Hitchcock', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Fans', 'hoping', 'inside', 'look', 'technical', 'aspects', 'Psycho', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'shower', 'bath', 'scene', 'handled', 'rather', 'perfunctorily', 'not', 'clear', 'took', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'only', 'brief', 'scene', 'Marion', 'Crane', 'driving', 'front', 'rear-projection', 'screen', 'Hitchcock', 'yelling', 'insults', 'character', 'camera', 'melon', 'contest', 'winner', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'ignored', 'fact', 'Hitchcock', 'never', 'deeply', 'involved', 'production', 'basically', 'just', 'brisk', 'somewhat', 'gossipy', 'story', 'classic', 'filming']",Hitchcock

I read the book that this was based on and greatly enjoyed it.  So I rushed to see this film when it was playing in the movies last December (which wasn't all that easy since it was playing in very few theaters.)  I considered the film to be enjoyable, but not great.The main problem is that the film slows to a crawl when it gets into an (imaginery?) affair between Hitchcock's wife Alma and an author that she is collaborating on a book with.  We are then asked to believe that when Norman Bates is stabbing Marion Crane in the shower, it is really Hitchcok stabbing Alma for her alleged infidelity.  I have read many book on Hitchcock and I have never read anything about Alma and another man, so I assume it to be made up for artistic purposes.  However, it really slows down the film.  While watching the film, I started to wonder about what Hitchcock's daughter Pat and her children thought of this film.  I imagine not very much. (Hitchcock's affinity with serial killer Ed Gein, the basis for Norman Bates, probably also could not have sat well with them.)The acting is fine.  Anthony Hopkins really became Hitchcock for me.  Helen Mirren is also excellent, although I believe he to be a little too glamorous for Alma.  Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel were also fine as Janet Leigh and Vera Miles.  The actor who played Anthony Perkins was truly impressive catcing Perkins twitchy mannerisms both as Norman Bates and Perkins himself.  I also liked much of the dialogue that many of us who lived in that period could appreciate.  I especially enjoyed Alma telling Hitchcock to perhaps make Psycho as a musical and to send the script to Doris Day.  (I'm not sure how many of today's younger audiences would know who Doris Day was.  Perhaps they also don't know who Hitchcock was, considering the film's low grosses.)Anyway, this is a well-acted and enjoyable film.

I often give talks illustrated with clips from Hitch&#8217;s films, and it doesn&#8217;t matter if the audience is made up of high school students, teachers, writers, psychotherapists, or film buffs, they all react to classic suspenseful scenes like the out-of-control carousel from Strangers on a Train, the discovery of the farmer&#8217;s body in The Birds, the chase across the faces of Mt. Rushmore in North By Northwest, or the voyeuristic scenes from Psycho. The Psycho film is the centerpiece of the new biopic Hitchcock which not only showcases the director&#8217;s fears and foibles, but also his manipulation of women, collaborators, the press, and Alma Reville, his wife, co-writer, editor, script girl, and mother of his daughter, Patricia. This film places a little too much emphasis on the &#8220;McGuffin&#8221; of having Paramount Studios be unwilling to bankroll a black and white movie, when the truer story is how Hitch wanted to make more money off his films, and by being his own banker/producer, he reaped a huge profit. But you don&#8217;t have to be a film buff to delight in all the great work by the actors personifying Hitch, Alma, Janet Leigh, Tony Perkins, Vera Miles, composer Bernard Hermann and screenwriter Josef Stefano.

Now we explore the great suspense maker through the machinations of the making of PSYCHO as the reason for exploring the strange body and mental habitus of Hitchcock. While not all of the data gathered for this film written by John J. McLaughlin based on Stephen Rebello's book `Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho' which in turn was based on the derring-do of filming Joseph Stefano's screenplay adapted from the Robert Bloch book PSYCHO which happened to be `inspired' by the serial killer Ed Gein, there certainly is a potpourri of ideas on which to let a cast a sterling actors dabble.The setting is 1959 and Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins, flab enhanced) and his wife, Alma (Helen Mirren) are at the top of their creative game as filmmakers despite the fact that the various studios are suggesting that Hitchcock should retire. But Hitchcock has another film in his head - PSYCHO - and despite the fact that everyone including Alma believes the film cannot be made with the current censorship and because the story is tasteless Hitchcock decides to bankroll his own film and proceed. All of Hitchcock's characteristics surface - his propensity for blond actresses (he even spies on them while they are dressing), his involvement with the lurid story of Psycho to the point of visualizing Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) to bolster his rabid love of the story, his misplaced mistrust of Alma's friendship with writer Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), and his demand that the entire cast and crew of the closed set film are sworn to silence about the movie's content. Hitchcock engages blond curvaceous Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Anthony Perkins (James D'Arcy) for the leads, includes Vera Miles (Jessica Biel) for a bit part, and constantly fights for the film to be completed and released - which as we know, happened - due in large part to Hitchcock's own shenanigans about marketing.Though the real theme of the film is a love story between Hitchcock and Alma, the entire crew at Paramount Pictures becomes involved: Hitchcock's secretary Peggy Robertson (Toni Collette), Lew Wasserman (Michael Stuhlberg), Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow), Saul Bass (Wallace Langham), composer Bernard Hermann (Paul Schackman), writer Joseph Stefano (Ralph Macchio), among others. Hopkins gives us a fascinating portrait of Hitchcock and the rest of the cast fill their parts well. But in the end we are left wondering which film will be the basis of the next probable biopic of Alfred Hitchcock. Sacha Gervasi directs with some very generous asides to Hitchcock's mannerisms we all know well. Grady Harp, March 13",4,`You may call me Hitch.

The movie opens and closes with Anthony Hopkins in his eponymous role, but taken from the TV show Alfred Hitchcock hosted, introducing both the movie ""Hitchcock"" and it's focus on ""Psycho"" and tying up loose ends at the finish.  In this aspect of Alfred Hitchcock, Hopkins is breaking the fourth wall, but only to a point.  Along the way, the ""actual"" serial killer (who inspired the book and then the movie, ""Psycho"") appears as a hallucinated muse who guides Hitchcock along in the filming, although the movie is so sloppy in drawing boundaries, very often it appears that Hitchcock was harboring a mass killer.This is no more of a biography of Alfred Hitchcock than ""The Master"" was a biography of L. Ron Hubbard, or Scientology.  But the latter was a much more polished work, and far better done.  As a piece of cinematography, alone, this film is an insult to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, but at least it gives some long overdue public credit to Hitchcock's apparently long suffering wife, Alma.  And it's entertaining, if nothing else.When it comes to portraying famous people some of us remember remember seeing alive,  Anthony Hopkins is far less convincing as Hitchcock than Meryl Streep was as Julia Child.  His fat suit isn't proportioned correctly, so Hopkins holds his arms out to his sides; tilts his head back, and half-purses his lips to impose an effect that isn't quite successful.  The camera looking up from waist level helps, somewhat, but how many people are filmed from the waist, looking up?  Any quick watch of Julia Child's PBS cooking show illustrates there's a big gap between her reality and Meryl Streep's portrayal, but Streep captured her essence with far less effort than Hopkins, thus Hopkins' antics end up deflating rather than inflating his character.As far as the other characters go, Jessica Biel was even less successful at portraying Vera Miles than Hopkins was in playing Hitchcock, but James D'Arcy pretty much nails Anthony Perkins.So, like a lot of films these days, you just have to go in expecting entertainment, in this case a Hitchcock themed entertainment, and not put too much into it, or try to get too much out of it.  It's fairly decent fresh popcorn, not fine dining.  I'll probably watch it again, but renting it to stream, not buying it.",3,"Fun, Light Entertainment With A Hitchcock Theme.

I wonder how many of today's audience members have even heard of Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma.The story is all really conjecture with no one to support or deny it. This is basically a the story of a man and a woman for whom the passion has gone out of their marriage. Well, nothing lasts forever. He thinks she's cheating on him and he is jealous. She dislikes the fact that he is sexually attracted to his leading ladies. Well, the women tend to be young, glamourous actresses. This is an elderly couple. Wouldn't it be natural?Anthony Hopkins, complete with rubber nose and padding, neither looks nor sounds anything like Alfred Hitchcock. Helen Mirren looks nothing like Alma. Imelda Staunton in THE GIRL is a much closer match and Imelda's restrained performance strikes me as much closer to the real woman than Mirren's histrionics.The Movie if full of innacuracies and spends very little time discussing the making of the movie. Most of the movie is speculation about the Hitchcock's marriage.Here's an example: When they are photographing Marion's flight in the car, the vehicle shown is a light blue 1955 Ford Tudor (2 doors) sedan. Did anybody bother to screen PSYCHO before they set up this shot? Marion left town in a 1955 Ford, but it was a FORDOR (4 doors) sedan in BLACK.The famous ""gray"" dress in the original B&W; movie was really light blue, according to Rita Riggs who was the wardrobe director. In this recreation, the dress has gone back to dark grey.I didn't get all the references to Ed Gein. I don't believe Hitch was obsessed with Gein. He knew he was ""only making a movie"".I liked Scarlett Johanson as Janet Leigh. Scarlett doesn't have Janet's classical beauty, but she has a earthy sexiness, and Janet is shown as a sweet girl, which she was in real life. Jessica Biel, who plays the elegant Vera Miles is strikingly gorgeous and a good choice for the part, but has little to do. The actor who plays Anthony Perkins will make you do a double take, but he only has about two lines of dialogue.I find it telling that the credits name all the people standing around the set as to who plays what participant in PSYCHO, even when they have no dialogue, yet never once do you hear or see the name PATRICIA HITCHCOCK! Ms. Hitchcock, if you will remember, had the supporting part of Caroline, Marion's co-worker at the real estate office. I'd love to know what Pat thinks of this movie. It can't be anything good.Meanwhile, read the book: ALFRED HITCHCOCK AND THE MAKING OF PSYCHO.If you purchase PSYCHO, THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION, you will find an excellent documentary about the making of PSYCHO containing interviews with Janet Leigh, Assistant Director Hilton Greene and Screenwriter Joseph Stefano, among others. This documentary contains all you need to know about the making of PSYCHO from inception to completion.It's much better than this silly self-indulgent picture.Oh, by the way, Toby Jones and Imelda Staunton are head and shoulders better than Hopkins and Mirren as the Hitchcocks in THE GIRL, even if the story is not.",2,Poppycock,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,3131,"['scriptwriters', 'must', 'be', 'running', 'ideas', 'subjects', 'Hollywood', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'today', 'audience', 'members', 'have', 'even', 'heard', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'wife', 'Alma.The', 'story', 'really', 'conjecture', 'one', 'support', 'deny', 'basically', 'story', 'man', 'woman', 'whom', 'passion', 'gone', 'marriage', 'Well', 'nothing', 'lasts', 'forever', 'cheating', 'jealous', 'fact', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Well', 'women', 'tend', 'be', 'young', 'glamourous', 'actresses', 'elderly', 'couple', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'natural', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'complete', 'rubber', 'nose', 'padding', 'anything', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'nothing', 'Alma', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'much', 'closer', 'match', 'Imelda', 'restrained', 'performance', 'strikes', 'much', 'closer', 'real', 'woman', 'Mirren', 'histrionics.The', 'Movie', 'full', 'innacuracies', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'discussing', 'making', 'movie', 'Most', 'movie', 'speculation', 'Hitchcock', 'marriage.Here', 'example', 'When', 'are', 'photographing', 'Marion', 'flight', 'car', 'vehicle', 'shown', 'light', 'blue', '1955', 'Ford', 'Tudor', '2', 'doors', 'sedan', 'Did', 'anybody', 'bother', 'screen', 'PSYCHO', 'set', 'up', 'shot', 'Marion', 'left', 'town', '1955', 'Ford', 'was', 'FORDOR', '4', 'doors', 'sedan', 'BLACK.The', 'famous', 'gray', 'dress', 'original', 'B', 'W', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'light', 'blue', 'according', 'Rita', 'Riggs', 'who', 'was', 'wardrobe', 'director', 'recreation', 'dress', 'gone', 'back', 'dark', 'grey.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'references', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Hitch', 'was', 'obsessed', 'Gein', 'knew', 'was', 'only', 'making', 'movie', '.I', 'liked', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Scarlett', ""n't"", 'have', 'Janet', 'classical', 'beauty', 'earthy', 'sexiness', 'Janet', 'shown', 'sweet', 'girl', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'who', 'elegant', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'strikingly', 'gorgeous', 'good', 'choice', 'part', 'little', 'do', 'actor', 'who', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'will', 'make', 'do', 'double', 'take', 'only', 'about', 'two', 'lines', 'dialogue.I', 'find', 'telling', 'credits', 'name', 'people', 'standing', 'set', 'who', 'what', 'participant', 'PSYCHO', 'even', 'when', 'have', 'dialogue', 'yet', 'never', 'once', 'do', 'hear', 'see', 'name', 'PATRICIA', 'HITCHCOCK', 'Ms.', 'Hitchcock', 'will', 'remember', 'had', 'supporting', 'part', 'Caroline', 'Marion', 'co-worker', 'real', 'estate', 'office', ""'d"", 'love', 'know', 'what', 'Pat', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'good.Meanwhile', 'read', 'book', 'ALFRED', 'HITCHCOCK', 'THE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'PSYCHO.If', 'purchase', 'PSYCHO', 'THE', 'COLLECTOR', 'EDITION', 'will', 'find', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'making', 'PSYCHO', 'containing', 'interviews', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Hilton', 'Greene', 'Screenwriter', 'Joseph', 'Stefano', 'others', 'documentary', 'need', 'know', 'making', 'PSYCHO', 'inception', 'completion.It', 'much', 'better', 'silly', 'self-indulgent', 'picture.Oh', 'way', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'are', 'head', 'shoulders', 'better', 'Hopkins', 'Mirren', 'Hitchcocks', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'even', 'story', 'not']",Hitchcock

It is well shot, has a tight story and fantastic performances delivered with an utter joy that is impossible to miss. It is not perfect, being that it is based upon a real person and real events, but so much of the spirit and wit of Alfred Hitchcock is found here that the liberties taken are easy to excuse. I have not enjoyed watching a ""bio pic"" of this kind in years and Anthony Hopkins has finally come alive again in his role as good ol' ""Hitch"". I cannot remember how long ago it was that I was able to watch Anthony Hopkins and forget that I was watching Anthony Hopkins. Here he exudes sheer glee and an intuitiveness about his character in every scene that pays off in spades. Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles, and James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins are used sparingly but very effectively and Helen Mirren is spectacular as Hitchcock's faithful yet long suffering wife Alma Reville.The story centers on the period in Hitchcock's life when he was making his horror masterwork ""Psycho"". The book, based on the demented murders committed by Ed Gein, was making a slowly rising stir at the time and Hitchcock was looking for something truly new. He was a legend in his own time, but he was tired of television and even more tired of listening to the studios demanding he make more of the same types of films that he had already directed for them. Finding absolutely no support from studio executives who feared the brutal murder and transvestitism in ""Psycho"" would cause an uproar in the movie going public, Hitch funded the movie himself and delivered, with many setbacks, what is now known as his most popular film ever.It takes a few moments to get onboard with the way the movie is presented. It delves into the mindset of Hitchcock in visually disturbing ways and does not follow the typical ""Based On True Events"" style we are used to. This, however, works in the movie's favor. The presentation forces the audience to think and participate in the story instead of letting it roll over them. Hitchcock was especially good at getting the audience involved and a movie about his methods and life should feel the same way. The director, Sacha Gervasi, layers the story, plot, and character elements in a way that brings us into the film and makes us more than viewers.

1616283,A366S12KCZ280V,B00ARA4SLU,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[1, 2]","Alfred Hitchcock certainly had a stellar career as a movie director becoming quite possibly the greatest director of all time. If not the greatest then with no question one of the greatest. His body of work is an endless list of outstanding films that are far too many to mention. His film career spanned around 50 years from the mid 1920's to 1976 when he made his last movie. Out of all the great films that were made by Hitchcock there is one in particular that will always stand out among those he made.The movie ""Hitchcock"" is all about that one film that would become the highpoint in Hitchcock's career. ""Psycho"". It was something radically different from what Hitchcock had directed in the past and there were many who were sure Hitchcock had lost his mind in wanting to make such a gristly story into a movie. As the movie tells however Hitchcock was at a point in his career where he thought people were losing interest in the kind of movies he was making. That of course is not to say he was making bad movies. Far from it. Before ""Psycho"" Hitch had made ""North By Northwest"", certainly one of his better classic films starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Sensing however that the public was starting to look for something different in movies Hitchcock wanted to change direction in the kind of movies he was making.Hitch had read a book about the real story of Ed Gein, a murderer of at least 2 known women and who also robbed graves for body parts. In addition to Norman Bates from ""Psycho"" Ed Gein would become the inspiration for the character Leatherface from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and Jame Gumb from ""Silence Of The Lambs"". Hitchcock anyway had the inspiration for his next movie. The trick now was getting others to go along with his next project which would not only include Paramount Pictures but his own wife Alma as well. It would not be easy to do and that is what ""Hitchcock"" is about, what Hitchcock had to do in order to make what would become one of the most popular movies ever made. Of course while ""Hitchcock"" is about making the film ""Psycho"" it is at the same time a look behind the scenes in Hollywood at how the movie industry works and how deals are made to casting the right actors for the parts to getting script approval which includes dealing with the censors (my favorite scene in ""Hitchcock"" is when Hitch is talking with a person who is questioning about the shower scene and if the young lady will be naked in the shower. Hitchcock reply with ""No she will be wearing a shower cap"". Certainly a classic Hitchcock comeback.) to dealing with nervous studio heads wanting to see daily shots of what is being filmed. Indeed Hitchcock had to put up with a lot in trying to make ""Psycho"" but of course in the end the film is a total triumph for Hitch revitalizing his career and changing how movies would be made in the future as well.Of course there is another Hitchcock that this movie is about. Alma. This is as much about her as it is about Alfred. Alma had to put up with a lot with the filming of ""Psycho"". Alma always knew she was an important part in Alfred life, even when he would have an infatuation with whichever leading lady he was working with at the time. ""Psycho"" with its leading lady Janet Leigh would prove different though. Of course in the beginning Alma thought making ""Psycho"" was a big mistake for Alfred to make. In time though she would come around to the project and become the biggest supporter in its making, including going along with coming up with the funds themselves to make ""Psycho"" which would put both of them in a financial hardship without knowing if it would all pay off. In the meantime the pressure is mounting and Alfred's latest infatuation with Janet Leigh becomes to much for Alma and puts a strain on their marriage. A strain to the point her attention turns to a male friend of hers who is a writer and asks her for help with his latest project. When Alfred finds out about this it is his turn to become jealous of what is going on. Of course all works out well in the end for the Hitchcocks. Even though you know how the story will end and the success that ""Psycho"" will become it is still a compelling movie to watch as you see what went on behind the scenes as one of the greatest horror films was being made.There two reasons why this movie is so interesting to watch. One is Anthony Hopkins in the lead role as Hitchcock. While not I feel a spot on impersonation of Alfred Hitchcock, Hopkins still gives one of his best performances since ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and it doesn't take long as you watch the film to forget it is Hopkins playing Hitchcock and start believing it is Hitchcock himself up there on the screen. The other reason the film is so good is Helen Mirren as Alma. In some ways this is more her movie then Alfred's and certainly rates among one of Helen's greatest acting roles.I give this movie high recommendation for anyone to watch whether you are a fan of Hitchcock, horror movies or like films about the workings of Hollywood itself. This is a movie anyone can get into and get lost in the story about one of the most important movies that almost wasn't made but in the end was.",5,The Movie About The Movie,1377475200,"08 26,

Just some thoughts on this movie...Hitchcock (2012) is a story that centers around the period of time that Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma were working on the horror mega classic Psycho (1960).  The cast is high caliber.  Anthony Hopkins plays Alfred Hitchcock.  He does a good job being Hitchcock.  Helen Mirren plays Hitch's wife Alma.  She too does a good job.  Other cast members include Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles, James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, and Ralph Macchio as Joseph Stefano.  Scarlett Johansson is pretty much a carbon copy of Janet Leigh in this movie.This movie is good, not great, but good.  It's great to see a movie made that centers around the greatest director of all time (in my opinion), Alfred Hitchcock.  Psycho was a huge hit, controversial, and groundbreaking for its time.  This movie delves into the behind the scenes drama that took place while getting this movie made.  For those of you not familiar with his work, check out some of his movies.  Start with Psycho, then maybe Vertigo (1958), The Birds (1963), North By Northwest (1959), Rear Window (1954), Strangers On A Train (1951), Rebecca (1940), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), and Notorious (1946).",4,Hitch,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,1282,"['full', 'description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'Just', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'Hitchcock', '2012', 'story', 'centers', 'period', 'time', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'wife', 'Alma', 'were', 'working', 'horror', 'mega', 'classic', 'Psycho', '1960', 'cast', 'high', 'caliber', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'Hitchcock', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Hitch', 'wife', 'Alma', 'too', 'good', 'job', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'Joseph', 'Stefano', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'pretty', 'much', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'great', 'see', 'movie', 'made', 'centers', 'greatest', 'director', 'time', 'opinion', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'controversial', 'groundbreaking', 'time', 'movie', 'scenes', 'drama', 'took', 'place', 'getting', 'movie', 'made', 'not', 'familiar', 'work', 'check', 'out', 'movies', 'Start', 'Psycho', 'then', 'maybe', 'Vertigo', '1958', 'Birds', '1963', 'North', 'Northwest', '1959', 'Rear', 'Window', '1954', 'Strangers', 'Train', '1951', 'Rebecca', '1940', 'Shadow', 'A', 'Doubt', '1943', 'Notorious', '1946']",Hitchcock

1616297,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00ARA4SLU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 9]","Hitchcock is the second film of 2012 to depict the great director following the HBO film The Girl, which set its sights on the making of The Birds and Hitch's obsession with Tippi Hendren. Hitchcock primarily focuses on his relationship with his wife Alma Reville and uses the making of Psycho as background noise. Both films attempt to explore Alfred Hitchcock's dark side, but Hitchcock is much lighter on its feet and doesn't seem like a hit piece the way The Girl did. Oddly enough though, this film's subject matter and structure more closely resemble a television film that wouldn't have been out of place on HBO. I attribute the theatrical release of Hitchcock to the stars involved and Oscar hopes. I'm not saying Hitchcock isn't a good film, but it has neither the depth that makes for a great biopic nor the trashy exploitation that made The Girl so provocative.Hitchcock opens somewhat comically at the farmhouse of Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) as he murders his brother with a shovel before the tumescent Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) himself directly addresses the camera. From there, a reporter at the premiere of his latest film North by Northwest asks Hitchcock if he thinks he's past his prime, which sets him obsessively looking for his next project. After Hitch reads Robert Bloch's novel Psycho he decides to film it, despite receiving little support from those around him. His wife Alma (Helen Mirren), portrayed as his closest confidant and creative partner, eventually warms to the idea but Hitch is still unable to convince the studio and decides to finance the film himself. He then begins assembling the cast, which the film suggests was based entirely on Alma's suggestions. The all-star cast is chock-full of familiar faces, not all of whom are obvious choices for their roles, particularly when it comes to Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Biel, and James D'Arcy playing Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and Anthony Perkins respectively. Toni Collette (as Hitchcock's trusted assistant) and Danny Huston (as a writer friend of Alma's, who provokes insecurity in Hitch) also co-star.While it appears to be a behind-the-scenes biopic of the making of Psycho, the film's main focus is the relationship between Hitch and Alma. This is fine except, with a running time of less than 100 minutes, it fails to dedicate enough time or substance to either topic. The behind-the-scenes stuff offers up no new (or, at least, obscure) information and the relationship is portrayed very superficially. It treads lightly across Hitchcock's perverse obsession with his leading ladies and makes half-hearted attempts to explore the jealousies and insecurities that made the man tick (often showing Ed Gein as a recurring figure within Hitch's psyche as he takes on the film and his own inner demons), unfortunately the writing is persiflage that burrows to the core of the man about as thoroughly as his Wikipedia page. In one scene Hitchcock tells Alma ""all men are potential murderers...and for good reason."" It's a good line; but it doesn't have the impact it seems to expect it will.Hopkins effectively disappears behind the prosthetics to portray Hitchcock, with his own voice emerging sporadically through the accent. He does a fine job but the screenplay renders his performance into little more than an impersonation that fails to convey any humanity in the character. He seems to be enjoying the role and he's fun to watch, but it won't win him any awards. A scene of Hitchcock standing outside the theater door as Psycho premieres, acting as a macabre conductor of his audiences emotions is one of the most revealing scenes. It's terrific, but it's too little too late. The supporting players do a fine job but their characters are so two-dimensional they're unable to do anything truly dynamic. Johansson doesn't greatly resemble Janet Leigh but is appropriately elegant, charming, and spunky. D'Arcy meanwhile is under-utilized as he instantly nails the timid, fidgety nature of Anthony Perkins. Appearing in only a few scenes, he remarkably resembles the man and, from the moment he appears onscreen, captures his essence. Because Helen Mirren plays a real person that existed more behind the scenes than others, it allows her more room for interpretation and, as such, she gives arguably the film's strongest performance. There are times when her performance alone keeps the film from crumbling under the weight of its own ambition. She gives the relationship between Hitch and Alma a sense of reality that didn't appear on the page.While not a very memorable film, Hitchcock does offer a good bit of behind the scenes fodder. Some of the most enjoyable scenes come from Hitchcock fighting with the censors over trivial issues such as showing a toilet flushing onscreen. The filming of the infamous shower scene is treated with insouciance and ends much too quickly, but is amusing in the way it becomes unintentionally sexy because of Johansson. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, as evidenced by some amusing tongue-in-cheek references to Psycho (during editing, an issue arises over Leigh allegedly blinking), this film itself (the comment about Leigh's breasts), and a final shot that almost suggests an attempted continuity with The Girl.Hitchcock is a well-made film with performances that hold your attention, but I wish it had been able to offer a little something more. If screenwriter John J. McLaughlin had redirected the focus of his script to either the making of Psycho or Hitch and Alma's marriage and kept the focus there, a more effective film could have come from it.  Ultimately Hitchcock attempts a balancing act and suffers for it. While it builds a foundation on an intriguing subject and portrays it an entertaining way; it just doesn't do its subject justice. For a film about such a remarkable man, Hitchcock is almost remarkably unremarkable.",3,A Film About a Remarkable Man That is Remarkably Unremarkable,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,5892,"['Hitchcock',

1616309,A1CYV655X6LBVK,B00ARA4SLU,Kendrick,"[1, 2]","The opening scene of Hitchcock met with erupting laughter from the theater audience. Ed Gein--the inspiration for the novel Psycho--killed his brother with a shovel to the head in a most comedic way; after which the camera panned to Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) who speaks directly to the audience and prepares them to go behind the scenes of the making of the Psycho movie. The film captures a slice of Hitch's (a nickname) life, limiting itself to his efforts to bring Psycho to the big screen--from casting and screenplay-drafting to its debut.Hitch's strained relationship with his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), also an accomplished director, takes central stage, relegating the actual filming of Psycho to a supporting role.At first, we do not realize there is any problem between Hitch and Alma, other than the fact that they sleep in separate beds yet in the same room. (I'm not sure whether this is a nod to historical idiosyncrasy or a throwback to the I Love Lucy days of censorship where even insinuations of the marriage bed was forbidden.) But Alma decides to help a man named Whit Cook with his screenplay and is increasingly enthralled by him, driven away by Hitch's obsession with finding the perfect blond to fantasize over. Alma and Hitch eventually discover that their fantasies are illusions and Alma invests all of herself back into the Psycho production.Alma had a fantasy of romance that involved the a melding of two creative minds as they typed away on the back porch of an idyllic beach house while sipping wine. This fantasy is crushed when she finds him with a young woman in their hideaway. Hitch's fantasy fails when he can't catch the perfect blond who has beauty and mystery that can last indefinitely. Janet Leigh (the lead female of Psycho played here by Scarlett Johansson) is a Hitchcock admirer, but keeps her distance and remains professional in their work relationship. We also learn that Vera Miles (another actress in Psycho played by Jessica Biel) was originally a ""Hitchcock girl,"" but decided to get married and have a child.In both these cases, Hitchcock as a love story, drama, and romantic comedy offers a stunningly realistic portrayal of love in marriage. Hitch and Alma are old and unattractive, looking for something fresh and novel, but end up discovering that such a wild goose chase results in only the bitter taste of disappointment. This is refreshing and presents a perspective on romance that runs counter to the common Hollywood line.But Hitchcock goes beyond a mere love story--though it would have been a good enough movie had it stuck to just that. The film is also a study of Hitchcock's philosophy of film, or at least an inquiry into why thrillers and horror movies have such a wide appeal (the very appeal Hitchcock played on so often in his movies). The answer may lie less in the ability of the filmmaker as it does in our innate human resonance with murder.In the opening scene described above, Hitch observes that brother has been killing brother since Cain and Abel. This biblical allusion acts as an anchor for the rest of Hitchcock. Hitch describes this human fascination with gruesome death a number of times throughout the film. More chillingly, Ed Gein makes an appearance in the film on several occasions; first as Hitch's psychiatrist, then offering advice and insights much like an alter ego.On one hand, this may be a tribute to Hitchcock's artistry of enmeshing himself into the twisted psyche of his characters; yet there is a literal parallel between Hitch and Gein. This reaches a climax in the infamous shower scene of blood-curling-screams-and-flashing-knife fame. Janet Leigh is failing to impress and Hitch decides to take the knife into his own hands, which gets the response from Janet that he desires: terror. As Hitch slashes the air with the knife, a variety of characters take Janet's place in rapid succession: the Paramount Pictures representative that has been giving him a hard time; Whit Cook, the scoundrel wooing his wife.Hitchcock was refreshing in its originality, depth, appropriate exploration of mature themes, and a surprisingly biblical worldview.

The script gives them lots to play with, and play they do; their relationship is quite believable and touching as well. Gervasi directs very well, top notch in fact and unexpectedly coming from the guy who did the Anvil movie. It was great, but who knew he could direct a straight feature so tightly? A name to watch.I found the story entertaining and informative, and loving Hitch but not knowing this whole tale gave me plenty to think about. Hopkins gives a great performance, but Mirren is even finer as Alma. Their connection is real and carries the film easily, and the nice turns by Johanssen and Biel add to the fun.As for the blu-ray, it looks good, decent transfer, and over an hour of extras, a few docs, etc. But one scary thing Fox did here, which likely heralds a new era of scamosity, is package the BD and dvd together. You can't just buy either, which sucks for dvd viewers, and frankly the whole dvd/BD combo is a rip and is now standard; how many blu-ray viewers still want a dvd?

In that sense, it's a movie about the making of a movie; one that happens to be considered one of the best, or at-least most groundbreaking, in cinema history. America was full of prudes back in 1959, so the famous shower scene, which is quite tame compared to the movie murders of today, shocks the theater audience to screams, as intended. Psycho went on to become Alfred Hitchcock's most successful film.

1616330,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00ARA4SLU,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","With the success of the EVIL DEAD remake I wonder if young movie goers will understand the shock and outrage that came about with the initial release of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. In 1960 this film stunned audiences around the world with what was then extreme footage. Compared to today's films it was nothing but that's the thing about classic films. To watch them and to get out of them what the film maker intended you have to place yourself back at that time rather than view it from today's standards.But apparently there was plenty going on behind the scenes with the creation of PSYCHO as well and that is the story behind the new DVD release HITCHCOCK. Not only that the film is also a love story of a great director and the woman that helped him reach the pinnacle of his career. The two themes work side by side to tell an interesting story that holds your interest from start to finish.The film opens with Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) looking for a new project having just finished with the release of NORTH BY NORTHWEST to rather tame reviews. His wife Alma (Helen Mirren) is trying to get him to work with an old friend, Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), who has a new book in the making. But Hitchcock is searching for something no one expects, no one has seen. Eventually he comes across something other studios are bypassing, a popular book called PSYCHO.Based on the true life story of Ed Gein, a small town man who seemed rather easygoing but who was cannibalizing corpses and using body parts to decorate his home, Hitchcock sees something unique here. The problem is no studio will back the picture with the funds necessary to make it. Discussing this at home Hitchcock and Alma decide to make the picture using their own funds. If the film is a success they can thumb their noses at the studio heads. If it fails, they lose all.The production story told here revolves around Hitchcock's obsession with the blonde haired beauties that always took center stage in his films. While he never touched, he often found himself entranced by their beauty to the extent that he often times ignored the one woman who supported him from the start of his career to its end.On the love story side we are witness to Alma's seemingly friendly interest in Whitfield. Working together in his secret beach house their efforts are truly platonic. Problems arise when Hitchcock finds Alma spending more time working there than on his project. His suspicions increase the more she's away to the point he actually becomes jealous, much the same feelings Alma has as he ogles the blondes in his films. Beneath the anger both have about their particular situations there is a deep love that lasted until their deaths.The film is an interesting look behind the scenes of what became the biggest hit that Hitchcock had in his long career, a success he never exceeded. The main thing that makes it work is the performances by both lead actors here. Mirren offers a woman who loves her husband deeply yet feels ignored both by him and those who don't realize just how much she contributed to his success and she does it in both subtle and non-subtle ways. Hopkins turns in another outstanding performance as well. Where he could have simply done a caricature of Hitchcock he instead gives us the nuances that the man was known for but also displays the complexity and insecurity behind the genius that was there.The movie was released but sparingly so to theaters and has received little push on the DVD market as well. That's sad because my guess is there are few young people today who know exactly who Hitchcock was and the amazing films he made. Ask and if you're lucky they may know PSYCHO but not the other films he is known for. This movie would make a great starting point to get them interested in the man and his films.

This new video is set during the time of the filming of ""Psycho"", which of course is a horror masterpiece, so unlike what passes for ""horror"" at theatres today.Anthony Hopkins plays the role, and he is an actor that can completely remove ""himself"" from a role to the point that you don't know who is playing the part without reading the credits!

The other being ""The Girl"" (HBO) which I haven't seen, but Hitchcock was certainly an interesting character.  This film, set during the development of ""Psycho,"" focuses primarily on his relationship with his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren).  Hitchcock (an appropriately corpulent Anthony Hopkins) loves making movies and after the success of ""North by Northwest"" is anxious to start his next project.After reading about the serial killer Ted Gein, Hitchcock decides to make a movie with a similar theme.  This horrifies the studio (Paramount) and the censors.  Eventually Hitch (he liked to be called Hitch as he tells his newest star Janet Leigh, ""drop the cock"") has to finance the picture on his own.  The most interesting thing about this movie is Alma who was an excellent filmmaker herself, but had subjugated herself to work with her husband.  Ms. Mirren steals the scenes she's in as the no nonsense professional.I remember Janet Leigh being interviewed several times and memory suggests Scarlett Johansson hits the perfect note as Hitchcock latest blond beauty.  Directed by Sacha Gervasi, the film seems to get off track at times.  This is particularly noticeable when Hitchcock's subconscious images of Gein (Michael Wincott) starts talking to him.Although the movie only runs 98 minutes, it feels a bit bloated.  Still the movie includes a good impersonation by Hopkins that includes Hitchcock's famous wit.

1616360,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00ARA4SLU,Paul Allaer,"[49, 53]","""Hitchcock"" (2012 release; 98 min.) is based on Stephen Rebello's non-fiction book 'Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho'. As the movie opens we see that Hitchcock is enjoying the success of 1959's North by Northwest movie, and is now pondering his next project. Paramount Pictures would like for him to do another North By Northwest-like movie, but Hitchcock is itching for something different and challenging. He stumbles upon the book Psycho, and decides that will be his next project. Paramount resists of course, and Hitchcock in the end finances the movie pretty much by himself. But the REAL story of ""Hitchcock"" is not Psycho, or not even Alfred Hitchcock himself, but instead Alma Reville (a/k/a Mrs. Hitchcock) and her relationship with Alfred and other people in her life. In that sense, the movie is really mistitled, and a more appropriate title would be ""Mr. & Mrs. Hitchcock"". I don't know to what extent the movie is a correct reflection of historical facts, but I was quite surprised to learn of the active role that Alma played in (i) rewriting the script for Psycho when rewrites where needed and the original writer was unavailable, (ii) stepping in as a director when Hitchcock fell ill for a few days, and (iii) re-editing (along with Hitchcock) the film after the initial cool reception (it was her Alma's insistence that the now infamous musical score for the shower scene was added).Several comments: the acting in the movie is superb throughout. I felt a bit sorry for Anthony Hopkins as he has the impossible task of bringing an iconic character like Hitchcock to life, but Hopkins did pretty well. However, the scene-stealer par excellence is Helen Mirren as Mrs. Hitchcock: she truly brings the film to life. At one point, when Hitchcock suspects her of having an affair with another writer, Alma dresses down Hitchcock (figuratively), and it is one devastating scene and the highlight of the film.Kudos as well to Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel, in the choice supporting roles of Janet Leigh and Vera Miles, respectively. Johansson is just ravishing. I don't know why but I had very little expectations going into this movie. I shouldn't have worried, as the movie simply flew by in no time and I enjoyed this a lot more than I ever expected.",4,"Presenting ""Mr. & Mrs. Hitchcock"": the Mrs. wins",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,2282,"['Hitchcock', '2012', 'release', '98', 'min', 'based', 'Stephen', 'Rebello', 'non-fiction', 'book', ""'Alfred"", 'Hitchcock', 'Making', 'Psycho', 'movie', 'see', 'Hitchcock', 'enjoying', 'success', '1959', 'North', 'Northwest', 'movie', 'now', 'pondering', 'next', 'project', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'North', 'Northwest-like', 'movie', 'Hitchcock', 'itching', 'something', 'different', 'challenging', 'book', 'Psycho', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'project', 'Paramount', 'resists', 'course', 'Hitchcock', 'end', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'REAL', 'story', 'Hitchcock', 'not', 'Psycho', 'not', 'even', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'instead', 'Alma', 'Reville', 'a/k/a', 'Mrs.', 'Hitchcock', 'relationship', 'Alfred', 'other', 'people', 'life', 'sense', 'movie', 'really', 'mistitled', 'more', 'appropriate', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Hitchcock', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'extent', 'movie', 'correct', 'reflection', 'historical', 'facts', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'learn', 'active', 'role', 'Alma', 'played', 'i', 'rewriting', 'script', 'Psycho', 'when', 'where', 'needed', 'original', 'writer', 'was', 'unavailable', 'ii', 'stepping', 'director', 'when', 'Hitchcock', 'fell', 'ill', 'few', 'days', 'iii', 're-editing', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'initial', 'cool', 'reception', 'was', 'Alma', 'insistence', 'now', 'infamous', 'musical', 'score', 'shower', 'scene', 'was', 'added', '.Several', 'comments', 'acting', 'movie', 'superb', 'felt', 'bit', 'sorry', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'impossible', 'task', 'bringing', 'iconic', 'character', 'Hitchcock', 'life', 'Hopkins', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'However', 'scene-stealer', 'par', 'excellence', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Mrs.', 'Hitchcock', 'truly', 'film', 'life', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Hitchcock', 'having', 'affair', 'writer', 'Alma', 'down', 'Hitchcock', 'figuratively', 'one', 'devastating', 'scene', 'highlight', 'film.Kudos', 'as', 'well', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'choice', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'respectively', 'Johansson', 'just', 'ravishing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'expectations', 'going', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'movie', 'simply', 'flew', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'more', 'ever', 'expected']",Hitchcock

In fact if I remember correctly the series was called ""Alfred Hitchcocks Bed Time Stories:.Well, between the books and the television show my fascination with Alfred Hitchcock began early on.Brilliant, one of a kind, a maverick and a deeply flawed human being. However he was in every way a true master of movie making and an editor beyond reproach. The latter something I especially liked seeing included in ""Hitchcock"" because it's really there - in the editing room where movies are made.Hundreds and often thousands of hours of film are whittled down to a seamless ninety  minutes of magic.Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as ""Hitch' his movements, voice syntax are spot on. The makeup spectacular and the transformation is brilliant. Oddly there were many times I could hear Hannibal Lechter in the voice and see Him in ""Hitches"" slow turning gaze and the even slower closing eyes.Perhaps because the real Hitchcock carried and expressed himself much like the fictional Lechter I don't know. However,  I do know Hopkins is a national treasure and that there is no trace of Lecter in any of his post ""Silence"" films.

I didn't know very much about Alma, his wife, but Helen Mirren as always does a good job of playing the  ""woman behind a successful man.""  I had no idea that she was a film maker in her own right and she certainly brought that talent to light in the scenes where she takes over on the set when Hitchcock becomes ill.  The other stars I didn't like so much. Scarlet Johannsen as Janet Leigh--well there's no comparison as far as I'm concerned. However she was portrayed as  the girl next door type in the movie like the scene when Janet hands over a bag of candy corn ""for Mr. Hitchcock"" and Alma says, ""Thank you for being professional, Janet.""  I guess Alma thought that Ms. Leigh was unlike the other blond leading ladies that ""Hitch"" adored!  The man who played Anthony Perkins aka Norman Bates was kind of insipid in his role.  But it was interesting to hear him during the interview with Hitchcock as he poured out his inner thoughts of who he was and how he related to the role of Bates.  I wasn't familiar with Whitfield Cook, either, and there really doesn't seem to be much out there about his career as a screen writer.  In the film, that is made evident as Hitchcock didn't think much of him either as well as being jealous of him.  That's another aspect of this film that I liked.  In all the scenes with Hitchcock present one sees how his mind works and how he fantasizes his thoughts about people and situations.

It did not seem like a film, I would enjoy, but the actors, Anthony Hopkns ( who by the way, bears a remarkablee likeness in speech, walk, actions and looks ) and Helen Mirren as his wife, Alma.What we have in this film, is the personal side of life of Hitchcock and his wife. At one point Alma tells someone that Hitch worked for her, she was the boss. She is, in fact, the unheralded writer and fixer of his scripts. She was beautiful and sexy, and, even though it appears their marriage had grown sexless, they were devoted to each other.The film is also about the making of films in the 'old' days of the studio systems of x-rating and looking at every aspect of the film. Hitchcock was having a dry period in filming, and found a script he liked about a serial killer, which turned into 'Pyscho'. The studio hated the idea, Alma found the subject gross, but Hitchcok was adamant. He had to mortgage their belived home and pool. It says a great deal that Alma agreed to this.

With som much schlock out there, it's nice to pop a Hitchcock film into the DVD player and spend an afternoon with the master of suspense. That's why I wanted to see this movie.Hitchcock, the man, was complicated and flawed, a man obsessed with a certain image of womanhood that he used again and again in his movies. And he was a bear of a director. Anthony Hopkins brings Hitchcock to life and does a marvelous job of capturing his essence. Helen Mirren as the wife shows the other side of Hitchcock that few of us were privy to-- a woman who understood the man she was married to, awoman who probably would have had her own successful career in Hollywood in another time, and a woman who was partnered with a man of genius who gave strength to that genius.This is the tale of Psycho-- how it came about, how it came to be made. Hopkins captures the man obsessed with his falling star and his need to save himself financially by re-inventing himself and the movies in the process. Constrained by the movie censors, he crafts one of the most suspenseful horror tales captured on film and he does it masterfully. But that mastery doesn't come easily and that's what this movie reveals-- the man behind the movie and the woman behind the man.Watching his movies and then listening to the behind-the-scenes commentary by associates and his daughter, it's easy to get a feel for the man. But this movie does a better job of revealing the real man-- flawed and driven by ego, reined-in by a wife who may be more partner now than wife, Hitchcock does a great job of showing us that genius is sometimes born of desperation and that fear of failure touches even the great.",5,Good evening,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1782,"['love', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'are', 'much', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'poem', 'story', 'well-crafted', 'captivating', 'stylistic', 'som', 'much', 'schlock', 'there', 'nice', 'pop', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'DVD', 'player', 'spend', 'afternoon', 'master', 'suspense', 'why', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie.Hitchcock', 'man', 'was', 'complicated', 'flawed', 'man', 'obsessed', 'certain', 'image', 'womanhood', 'used', 'again', 'again', 'movies', 'was', 'bear', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hitchcock', 'life', 'marvelous', 'job', 'capturing', 'essence', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'wife', 'other', 'side', 'Hitchcock', 'few', 'were', 'privy', 'woman', 'who', 'understood', 'man', 'was', 'married', 'awoman', 'who', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'own', 'successful', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'partnered', 'man', 'genius', 'who', 'gave', 'strength', 'genius.This', 'tale', 'Psycho', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'made', 'Hopkins', 'man', 'obsessed', 'falling', 'star', 'need', 'save', 'financially', 're-inventing', 'movies', 'process', 'Constrained', 'movie', 'censors', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'horror', 'tales', 'captured', 'film', 'masterfully', 'mastery', ""n't"", 'come', 'easily', 'what', 'movie', 'man', 'movie', 'woman', 'man.Watching', 'movies', 'then', 'listening', 'behind-the-scenes', 'commentary', 'associates', 'daughter', 'easy', 'get', 'feel', 'man', 'movie', 'better', 'job', 'revealing', 'real', 'man', 'flawed', 'driven', 'ego', 'reined-in', 'wife', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'partner', 'now', 'wife', 'Hitchcock', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'genius', 'sometimes', 'born', 'desperation', 'fear', 'failure', 'touches', 'even', 'great']",Hitchcock

1616400,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00ARA4SLU,Steven Aldersley,"[8, 8]","I don't know much about Alfred Hitchcock, other than the movies he left us with. That's why I was so interested in seeing this biographical drama. When I found out that Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren were involved, I was tempted to see ""Hitchcock"" the week it opened in theaters. I missed that opportunity, and the remainder of its run had one evening showing per day, so I eventually decided to wait for the Blu-ray. Reviews have been disappointing, but, as always, I trusted my instincts and decided to make up my own mind.Hopkins doesn't try to mimic Hitchcock's voice exactly, but he does employ the deliberate mode of speech that most of us are familiar with. The makeup isn't entirely convincing either, but it's good enough to get the job done. Hopkins plays the director quite seriously, and I felt that Hitchcock's playful nature was a little underused.What the movie attempts to do is take us back to the making of Psycho, which was released in 1960. Paramount's bosses were seeking something similar to North by Northwest, which had been released in 1959, but Hitchcock wanted to try something new. We learn how the project was chosen, and the sacrifices that Hitchcock and wife Alma made to make it happen. It's an interesting look at a brief time in a career which spanned more than half a century.The movie gets a lot of things right; It looks and feels like 1960, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel manage to resemble film stars of that era, and the casting in general is excellent.I've been thinking about why reviews were so negative, and I've come to the conclusion that it is a movie which will appeal to a very specific audience. It's not a gripping drama, and there isn't much excitement. This is a story intended for movie buffs or fans of Hitchcock. If you want to know more about his character, and how movies are made, this has something for you. Character studies are hard to get right, and the movie is far from perfect. But I was engrossed for 90 minutes, and enjoyed learning how some of the events came to pass. The marketing for Psycho was inventive, and contributed to its early success. Some of that story is shown here.The biggest source of conflict in the movie is Hitchcock's relationship with Alma. We learn something about their home life, and ultimately how important she was to his success. There's an explosive scene, just over an hour into the movie, in which Mirren's performance is elevated from good to great. It reminded me somewhat of the scene in Doubt, where Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman finally confront each other.Seeing ""Hitchcock"" makes me want to watch Psycho again, and I will do so in the near future. I've also been watching the excellent Bates Motel, starring Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore, and would recommend that as a good companion piece to Psycho if you're a fan.""Hitchcock"" works for its intended audience, but many people will find it lacking. It's a quiet movie, focusing on characters and details, rather than intensely dramatic scenes. I'm not sure what moviegoers were expecting. Perhaps they were hoping for a detailed look at Hitchcock's entire career? Lincoln fell flat for some viewers for similar reasons. If you enjoy seeing good acting, and have any interest in the man, ""Hitchcock"" is worth your time.Overall score 4/5 (for it's intended audience)",4,"Better than reviews would suggest, if you are part of its target audience",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,3342,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'other', 'movies', 'left', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'interested', 'seeing', 'biographical', 'drama', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'were', 'involved', 'was', 'tempted', 'see', 'Hitchcock', 'week', 'opened', 'theaters', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'remainder', 'run', 'had', 'one', 'evening', 'showing', 'day', 'eventually', 'decided', 'wait', 'Blu-ray', 'Reviews', 'have', 'been', 'disappointing', 'always', 'trusted', 'instincts', 'decided', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind.Hopkins', ""n't"", 'try', 'mimic', 'Hitchcock', 'voice', 'exactly', 'employ', 'deliberate', 'mode', 'speech', 'most', 'are', 'familiar', 'makeup', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'convincing', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Hopkins', 'director', 'quite', 'seriously', 'felt', 'Hitchcock', 'playful', 'nature', 'was', 'little', 'movie', 'attempts', 'do', 'take', 'back', 'making', 'Psycho', 'was', 'released', '1960', 'Paramount', 'bosses', 'were', 'seeking', 'something', 'similar', 'North', 'Northwest', 'had', 'been', 'released', '1959', 'Hitchcock', 'wanted', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'learn', 'how', 'project', 'was', 'chosen', 'sacrifices', 'Hitchcock', 'wife', 'Alma', 'made', 'make', 'happen', 'interesting', 'look', 'brief', 'time', 'career', 'spanned', 'more', 'century.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'feels', '1960', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'manage', 'resemble', 'film', 'stars', 'era', 'casting', 'general', 'excellent.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'why', 'reviews', 'were', 'so', 'negative', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'very', 'specific', 'audience', 'not', 'gripping', 'drama', ""n't"", 'much', 'excitement', 'story', 'intended', 'movie', 'buffs', 'fans', 'Hitchcock', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'character', 'how', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'something', 'Character', 'studies', 'are', 'hard', 'get', 'right', 'movie', 'far', 'perfect', 'was', 'engrossed', '90', 'minutes', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'how', 'events', 'came', 'pass', 'marketing', 'Psycho', 'was', 'inventive', 'contributed', 'early', 'success', 'story', 'shown', 'here.The', 'biggest', 'source', 'conflict', 'movie', 'Hitchcock', 'relationship', 'Alma', 'learn', 'something', 'home', 'life', 'ultimately', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'success', 'explosive', 'scene', 'just', 'hour', 'movie', 'Mirren', 'performance', 'elevated', 'good', 'great', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'scene', 'Doubt', 'where', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'finally', 'other.Seeing', 'Hitchcock', 'want', 'watch', 'Psycho', 'again', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'near', 'future', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'watching', 'excellent', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'starring', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'would', 'recommend', 'good', 'companion', 'piece', 'Psycho', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Hitchcock', 'intended', 'audience', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'lacking', 'quiet', 'movie', 'focusing', 'characters', 'details', 'rather', 'intensely', 'dramatic', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'moviegoers', 'were', 'expecting', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'hoping', 'detailed', 'look', 'Hitchcock', 'entire', 'career', 'Lincoln', 'fell', 'flat', 'viewers', 'similar', 'reasons', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'good', 'acting', 'have', 'interest', 'man', 'Hitchcock', 'time.Overall', 'score', '4/5', 'intended', 'audience']",Hitchcock

wife) and Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock.Hitch has the desire to make a new more shocking movie as he feels the need to change his approach to win a larger audience.In Psycho the famous scene is the shower scene where Marion Crane(Scarlett Johansson/Janet Leigh) is killed off in the first half hour.We also see Vera Miles(Jessica Biel)playing Marion's sister.She remains in contract to Hitch although he feels she let him down by becoming pregnant 2 weeks before the making of Vertigo.Anthony Hopkins plays Hitch as a grumpy soul but not unlikeable,liking his chocolate cakes and shots of whiskey,to the annoyance of Alma.He also is shown to get `visits' from Ed Gein,the psychopath killer,upon whom Robert Bloch's Psycho is based.He seems to have imaginary conversations with him.Not an impersonation more an impression,Hopkins bulks large,stands imperious he seems like a cross between Churchill and Tommy Cooper(""Hitch to you.Hold onto the cock""to Janet Leigh).Alma played with intelligence and humour by Mirren is shown to be Hitch's main creative partner(lifelong) and support.She also has a writer friend, Whit(Danny Huston)she is doing a script with,which causes Hitch to have sleepless nights as he fears she'll leave him.To compound problems the film is 2 days behind schedule and is $60,000 over budget,and Hitch is having trouble with the MPAA censor about nudity and stabbing,who threatens to deny it a certificate.He also becomes ill with stress and collapses and Alma stands in for his director's role for a day or two.Only Hitchcock believed in this project,nobody else did.He can't get finance for the film and has to mortgage his house and swimming pool to pay for it.Alma asks him ""why this film?"".She also helps the stillborn film gain shape in the cutting room.We remember the version of The Girl on TV which showed Hitch making The Birds where he comes across as goulish and predatory.This is not like that.It's kinder without the rough edges.It plays upon some of the gossip where he gets too close to his leading ladies(spying on Vera Miles) and Alma allows these flirtations, which are a fantasy.I liked that pairing of two superb actors,Mirren and Hopkins,who have never worked together.Johansson is excellent as the malleable Leigh.I didn't think the Ed Gein `visits' worked.So,there's no character development,but Hitch is shown as a master shaman who depended a lot on his wife's input to each film.No images from the actual film Psycho are shown.James Darcy's Anthony Perkins is the best but most underused impersonation.Worth a look,with some good music.So no shocks,but good fun.",4,""" Compared to Orson Welles, he's a sweetheart""",1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,2740,"['Hitchcock', 'entertaining', 'film', 'based', 'time', 'making',

The film showed us how Hitchcock immersed himself into the production, balancing his professional and personal life.The film was masterfully written and directed utilizing the famous Hitchcock wit, sexual innuendos, profile, music, and asides.How great is this film? Consider the fact that Jessica Biel accepted a tertiary female billing just to be in it. James D'Arcy played an excellent Anthony Perkins and Scarlett Johansson did not disappoint as Janet Leigh. This is a must for Hitchcock fans as it shows ""the master"" in a good human light. The climax scene of Hitchcock in the theater viewing the audience during the showing of his film was worth the price of the DVD alone.I was however disappointed to find out the script writers missed on a factual point.

1616414,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00ARA4SLU,The People's Critic,"[2, 3]","Movies about the movies are generally fascinating, and this genre has really never gone out of style. 2012's best picture Oscar went to The Artist, a film about the emergence of sound in film. Robert Altman's excellent film The Player satirizes the studio system as a backdrop to a murder mystery. The list of films like this dates back to the origin of the motion picture itself. While a common genre to make, these films often find a smaller niche audience and Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock will be no exception.Hitchcock opens with a charming homage to Alfred Hitchcock's television program, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Anthony Hopkins plays the iconic director, and his bravura for capturing Hitchcock's eccentricities without appearing overly melodramatic keeps the film afloat through its sprawling middle section (which is curiously similar to the sprawling middle section of the man himself). It can be a double-edged sword to be a director who takes on a film project about a brilliant director. Gervasi's film is rather unimpressive in its form. It is constructed rather typically and while telling a story about some brilliant editing, it fails to really practice what it preaches. This film is also not a career spanning project; instead, it commences in medias res as the aging director searches for a project that will validate his position as a master of suspense who is not outgrowing his art form. That aforementioned project is 1960's Psycho.The battle to get Psycho made is an interesting story and one worthy of the legacy of films about films. Hopkins dispels some of the tainted oddity that surrounds the reputation of Hitchcock by revealing the passion that lies underneath. Additionally, the film showcases his symbiotic relationship with his wife, Alma (Helen Mirran), a previously unsung heroine who put up with a lot and always stood by the flawed auteur. However, the film does tend to be a bit too ""inside"" for the casual filmgoer. It is almost imperative to have a working knowledge of Psycho to truly enjoy the film. Moreover, there are multiple winks at the audience for those who come in to the theater already knowing some of the behind the scenes stories like Hitchcock's battle with Bernard Herrmann about the score or what images were truly spliced into the famous shower montage.Nonetheless, Hitchcock does sail on in a relatively entertaining way. There is a bit of a lull as the film shifts focuses from Hitchcock to Alma's friendship with Whitfield Cook (Danny Houston). This side-story is pivotal, but it is dwelled on and overly represented. Hitchcock's infamous curiosity with his leading ladies is explored as Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Vera Miles (Jessica Biel) arrive on the set. This story of the director at work is much more compelling and deserves to be showcased a bit more than it is. This obsession that Hitchcock had with his lead actresses on set was also examined in HBO's The Girl, which debuted on the network earlier this year. In that film, Toby Jones plays Hitchcock with a malevolent and sinister air. Hopkins provides a slightly softer, warmer (yet still faintly obtuse) view of his behavior. Hitchcock is far from the comprehensive, authoritative source on the life of its subject. That film is yet to be made and perhaps never will be. However, it is not without its charm and is sure to please fans, although it may fail to create new ones.

1616415,AL0NIWIIDUJI5,B00ARA4SLU,Thomas Capers Jones,"[0, 0]","Like many people I've seen most of Hitchcock's films and enjoyed them.  But I knew very little about him.  This film is an interesting biography of Hitchcock during the creation of the script and the filming of &#34;Psycho&#34; which was his most famous film.The acting is great but the story is only good.  Hitchcock had trouble convincing Paramount that Psycho would be successful.  Many people thought the story too strange and too brutal.  In any case it did get filmed and it did become a success.Much of the movie deals with the relationship between Hitchcock and his wife, a gifted director in her own right who helped get Psycho back on track.  Their marriage was somewhat rocky but so are many marriages.The supporting cast who played Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins did a good job too.  There were also strange &#34;flashbacks&#34; involving Ed Gein, the murderer whose life was more or less the origin of the Psycho story.  The actor who played Gein did a good job in a very unrewarding role.Overall the film was interesting but not as interesting as perhaps it might have been.  No doubt if Hitchcock himself had directed it the story would have been more powerful.  Even so it held my interest and I learned things about Hitchcock that I had not known about before.One scene was very funny at the end.  Hitchcock was giving a monologue about lacking inspiration for his next film.

1616416,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00ARA4SLU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 17]","2012 was a big year for Alfred Hitchcock; all of the projects and plans were exciting, two movies, DVD box sets, more.. As a major fan of the iconic director - my website, thornhillatthemovies.com gets its name from the character played by Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest"" - anytime my idol is recognized is cause to rejoice. The first project, ""The Girl"" is an HBO Film based on actress Tippi Hedren's experiences making ""The Birds"". The more I heard about this film, the less I wanted to see it. During a press conference promoting the project, which apparently takes a very critical look at Hitchcock's strangeness and proclivities, she talked about his mental and physical abuse, his harassment, and the terrible experience making the film. About a month later, an interview by Robert Osborne with the actress was featured before a special one-night screening of ""The Birds"" in movie theaters. In both instances, she is getting paid to talk about what a terrible experience she had. The thought of this just turns me off, much like so much reality television. Why perpetuate bad memories and experiences and put them in the public eye? What good does it do after so much time has passed? The only reason is to make money and put you in the spotlight. Anyone who knows anything about Hitchcock knows he was a strange man with some darkness and we know the broad strokes about the filming of ""The Birds"".""Hitchcock"" directed by Sacha Gervasi (writer of ""The Terminal"") and starring Anthony Hopkins as the Master of Suspense, Helen Mirren as his longtime wife and collaborator, Alma Reville, Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles and Toni Collette as Peggy Robertson, Hitchcock's longtime assistant, is another story entirely.From the moment the trailers first started playing in the multiplex, two things were clear; ""Hitchcock"" would concentrate on the filmmaker's life while making ""Psycho"", a turning point and very important time in the filmmaker's life and it would have a certain `tongue-in-cheek' quality the filmmaker himself would appreciate and embrace.These are the best aspects of the film.For a filmmaker who worked fifty plus years and created some of the most memorable films ever, a feature length film could and should never cover his entire life or career. It's smart for ""Hitchcock"" to concentrate on a relatively short period of time, giving us as much insight and detail as possible.""Psycho"" represented a turning point in the director's career. Still reeling from the critical and box office failure of ""Vertigo"", a very personal film, the director turned to subject matter he knew well and made ""North by Northwest"", which was a huge hit. And the studios wanted more of the same. But Hitchcock was bored with the formula and wanted to make something that would provide a challenge. When he found the inspiration, a true-crime book called ""Psycho"", no studio wanted to make the film with him, so he made it ""on the cheap"", shooting the film in black and white, with many crew members from his television show and paid for it himself. When the film was completed, he made a deal with Paramount, a deal which would ultimately make him even wealthier and, in a way, ensure his legacy. ""Psycho"" represents a turning point in his cinematic style and his attitude toward the business of filmmaking.If you go to YouTube and search `Hitchcock' and `Psycho', one of the options you will be able to see is Hitchcock's original trailer for ""Psycho"". They didn't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing. He decided that no one should be admitted to the theater after the film started. Why? To build curiosity and suspense for the shocking twist about thirty minutes in. For the trailer, he wanted to do something different and decided to stay away from clips. Hitchcock was easily the most famous and recognizable director of the time, he was a star, a selling point, so he takes us on a tour of the set, visiting the Bates' house on the hill, the motel's office and room #1. Inside the room, he  points at the shower ""Oh, you don't want to even think about what happens in there."" That type of thing. It is very clever and very tongue-in-cheek. One of the trailers for ""Hitchcock"" features Hopkins in character, sitting in a recording studio, presumably doing a radio ad. Instead he begins talking about how cell-phones and texting during the film can make you go ""Psycho"". It's a very clever nod to the filmmaker's own promotions and a memorable way to get the word out about this new biopic.There are some good and some bad things about ""Hitchcock"". Basically, the bad things are that the film doesn't really go into enough detail or go far enough.The cast is good and they seem to relish the opportunity to play these famous people. Hopkins does a very good job as Hitch. Wearing a body suit and the suit and ties the director made famous, he adopts the man's mannerisms and speech patterns. Anyone who makes films like ""Vertigo"", ""Frenzy"", ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"", ""The Trouble with Harry"", ""The Birds"", etc. and makes them as well as Hitchcock did, has to have some darkness, some weirdness. And Hitchcock certainly had both, which has been well documented. Hopkins and Gervasi portray some of these points, hint at some and avoid others entirely giving the portrayal an interesting depth you only wish went a little further. He stares out of his bungalow window at a blonde woman who walks across the lot at the same time every day. Both Peggy and Alma know about his desire for blondes, so they seem to accept his longing stares. He casts Vera Miles (Biel) as Marion's sister, a brunette, to use up her contract and provide a slap on the hand for some of her personal choices. But they could have gone further, explored and explained more making the performance great.This is the first time in a while Hopkins has actually portrayed a character. In so many recent films, he seems to be simply reading his lines or doing another riff on Hannibal Lecter. This is sad because Hopkins is such a great actor and it is difficult to watch him do less than great work. In this film, he dons a body suit and make-up to help transform into the director. But he also adopts the distinctive speech patterns and mannerisms of the famous icon. The portrayal is more real and interesting than a lot of his recent work. It is also a little irreverent, and something you think Hitchcock might have given his stamp of approval..The relationship between Hitch and his wife, Alma (Mirren) is also nicely illustrated. The film gives us a glimpse at Alma's lifelong role as a silent creative partner - they first worked together on silent films in the `20s - .providing input into every aspect of the creative process from choice of material to editing. Mirren does a nice job of illustrating her fatigue and weariness of her involvement.Mirren also has the opportunity to portray different aspects of her role as a wife to one of the most celebrated, famous men in the world. She modestly enjoys what the fame and money brings them, but also tries to keep centered and grounded. At times, she even seems to wish she could live a simpler life. But when the film's budget spirals out of control, and her lifestyle is threatened, she becomes aggravated and testy. Mirren is a great actress and this is good work. But there is a layer missing that would make it great work.Scarlett Johansson plays Janet Leigh and James D'Arcy (""Cloud Atlas"") plays Anthony Perkins, the stars of the film within the film. Both were rising, if unspectacular, actors when cast by Hitchcock. Remember, he was footing the bill, so he wanted people who were cheap. And each portrays their `greenness' to the whole idea of Hollywood. Johansson has more screen time and more opportunity to paint shades of the naivet&eacute; Leigh might have had. There is a nice scene depicting Leigh and Perkins on the set, walking towards the camera. Perkins comments how this film will be a nice change of pace for them both, from all of the romantic fluff the studios usually cast them in. It will make them sit up and notice. This is a telling moment because Perkins would become typecast and his most memorable and successful roles would always be as madmen, crazy people and really intense and driven characters.Toni Collette is good as Peggy Robertson, Hitch's longtime secretary and collaborator. There is a hint of the influence she had on the director's career - if Alma was the final word, Peggy was the first - but again, it just doesn't seem to go far enough. One reason is that she simply doesn't have enough screen time.I wish Gervasi had dug a little deeper. There are a few moments when we watch Hitchcock observing Ed Gein (Michael Wincott), the man who would become the inspiration for Norman Bates, as he performs some of the terrible acts that would provide inspiration for ""Psycho"". Hitchcock stands nearby, watching, commenting to us about the action, as though he is reading the book and picturing these scenes in his mind. But we don't get an idea of why this material was so inspirational to the director. Unless it was purely for the shock value.The tongue-in-cheek nature of the film is good, and fitting, and the details the filmmakers provide about Hitch's life and filmmaking method are interesting. But balance between the two is never achieved and results in an uneven, marred portrait of the Master of Suspense.",3,Hitchcock-lite,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,9464,"['2012', 'was', 'big', 'year',

I was very interested in seeing this not only for that but also because I am a big Anthony Hopkins fan and thought he would be a good choice for this role.

The film, as a whole, focuses on Alfred Hitchcock and his often unheard-of wife Alma, working on the kerfuffle that was the 1960 classic Psycho.Much in the vein and constraints of a TV drama, the film is surprisingly effective as a film being extremely yet darkly hilarious and convincing with Anthony Hopkins' excellent (yet facially uneven resemblance) take on Hitchcock's witty, sardonic banter. A fine piece of filmmaking his work is and this underrated biopic that is which, in a strange way, kind of embodies a Simpsons Treehouse of Horror madness and disturbing attitude about murder, voyeurism, obsession, and mendacity. While the film was not intended as a comedy, the film is intentionally bizarre and melodramatic to a point where how Hitchcock decided to deal with the MPA (Motion Picture Association, the pioneers of American film censorship).Its rather uneven charm and irony make for an engaging film that might make me want to see The Girl, another film about Hitchcock but working on The Birds starring Toby Jones and Sienna Miller.""",4,"Forget the nay-sayers, Hitchcock is one entertaining biopic.

For me, it was a lot of fun watching Anthony Hopkins and Helen Miren in their roles.  It also was great seeing Michael Wincott back as the killer, Ed Glein.  I knew a good bit about Psycho the novel, and a little on the making of the movie.  This film just filled in the pieces for me.My complaint isn't with the film, but rather with how the DVDs were packaged.  If you own a regular DVD player, the only way to see the film is to buy the Blue Ray Edition with the regular DVD included.  You therefore pay a higher cost for the movie.  Then, when you search for extras on the DVD, the only thing you find are trailers for other movies.  All the extras are on the Blue Ray Edition, and you can't watch a Blue Ray disc in a regular DVD player, so you're screwed.I won't fall for this type of marketing again.  I'll simply wait a year or two for the price to come down and then purchase it.

1616437,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00ARA4SLU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","An unusual film ""Hitchcock"" is a bit of biography, a bit of a ""making of"" and quite a bit of fiction surrounding the Hitchcock's classic 1960 film ""Psycho"". If taken with a grain of salt, ""Hitchcock"" is an enjoyable mixture of fact and fiction that hinges on the performances of Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife (and uncredited collaborator) Alma and Danny Huston as Whitfield Cook a writer who worked with the Hitch's during the 1940's. All three give great performances and Hopkins focuses less on imitating Hitchcock and more on developing his character as he begins to see serial killer Ed Gein while preparing and shooting ""Psycho"".The introduction of an affair that Alma may or may not have had with Cook (those events supposedly occurred in the late early 50's nearly a decade before ""Psycho"" as Cook was working on ""Strage Fright"" and ""Strangers on a Train""). According to Hitchcock biographer Patrick McGillian Cook may have been gay (based on information obtained from his journals--Cook reportedly was involved with Sumner Elliot much later in life).Even if ""Hitchcock"" is far from factual, it manages to be an enjoyable romp.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a top notch transfer from Fox. Colors pop and detail is extremely sharp.The audio is quite good as well and is provided in English, Spanish, French with subtitles in English and SpanishFans who pick this up for the DVD should be aware that none of the special features are included on the DVD included in the Blu-ray combo pack.The Blu-ray has some nice special features including: a deleted Scene, a variety of featurettes focusing on ""Hitch and Alma"", Danny Elfman (who provides a very good score that compliments the Herrmann bits and pieces included from ""Psyho"")as well as featurettes that focus on the cast and director Sacha Gervasi's decision to make the film.The most informative extra is the commentary by director Gervasi with author Stephen Rebello who's book on the making of ""Psycho"" provided the basis for this fictionalized account on the making of the film.While not exactly 100% factual, ""Hitchcock"" isn't unlike other Hollywood biographies in how it takes liberties with the facts to create a good drama.

1616441,AP3B615GM191G,B00ARA4SLU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 3]","While some movies are made to attract the widest audience possible, others instead try to find a niche.  ""Hitchcock"" is most definitely a ""niche film"" primarily appealing to those interested in the Master himself, ""Psycho"" buffs, or just fans of the movie-making process in general.For a basic plot summary, ""Hitchcock"" falls into third main plotlines: First and foremost is Hitchcock's (Anthony Hopkins) tumultuous relationship with wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren).  Second, is his fascination with serial killer Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) that leads him to stand firm behind ""Psycho"" even when the major film studios want nothing to do with it.  Third, are the interactions between him and the cast of Psycho, primarily Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson), Vera Miles (Jessica Biel), and Anthony Perkins (James D'arcy).For fans of Hitchcock the director, this film sheds some potential light on what must have been churning through his mind while making the motion picture he ultimately became best known for.  His obsession with murder and his total devotion to his work are adeptly portrayed in the movie by director Sacha Gervasi, leading of course to a roiling home life that inevitably creeps into his movie-making ways.  Even just seeing the larger-than-life Hitch (played marvelously by Hopkins) come to life on the big screen is a treat for fans of his work.Another interesting avenue this film explores in-depth is the process by which a movie gets made in Hollywood.  Hitchcock is constantly in need of money, battling the censors, and struggling to meet deadlines.  On a more micro level, his interactions with the main players of ""Psycho"" lend greater understanding into why the film ultimately became such a huge success.Overall, then, being a big Hitchcock fan for many years, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie.
