1496391,A96JD9312DHWC,B005OK0YNY,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[4, 4]","The Rozen Maidens are a series of living dolls engaged in a contest, The Alice Game. The winner gets to become Alice,  a girl without blemish and without equal. Perfect. They also get to see father. The losers are forced to give up their  ability to commune with a medium at best and are turned into junk at worst. A young boy with a serious social phobia is always on his computer, collecting oddities and checking out supposedly cursed or magical items. He sends them back before having to pay, getting to experience the gimmick without the cost. When he receives a letter asking ""Will you wind it,"" he checks yes and finds himself suddenly thrust into the job of a medium, with a connection to a living doll.On the surface, this anime sounds like one that would involve a lot of battles and would mainly delve into combat. The dolls do fight, mainly with one of their number specifically, but seldom do the fights really push The Alice Game. Mainly you deal with the boy, his growing connection to a group of Rozen Maidens and his fear of the world and the concern his sister has for him.At first, our main character and his Rozen Maiden have issues with one another, but they grow closer with the passage of time. Other Maidens are introduced through a series of episodes, and some bring specialized tools or gifts that allow us to delve more deeply into the main boy's psyche. This helps explain what transpired and it also does something different with a storyline in an anime and I enjoyed that.This is not to say the show is all seriousness with fighting on the side. Many of the episodes are dedicated to humor. Even in the serious ones, pieces are reserved for humor. For example, The Maidens watch a show about a pet detective on TV almost each episode, ""dolls watching a puppet show,"" and it is pretty funny stuff. I actually would have liked a few episodes of it, honestly, because it was funny and graphic.This is a good 5/5 as long as you know what type of show it is and do not expect a lot of fighting outright. You get to know the characters and their connections to each other, and hints of a greater destiny for our main are hinted at in the latter half of the series.An enjoyable watch, noting of course the length of the series only hits at about 5 hours, with 12 episodes.",5,The Alice Game,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2295,"['Rozen', 'Maidens', 'are', 'series', 'living', 'dolls', 'engaged', 'contest', 'Alice', 'Game', 'winner', 'become', 'Alice', 'girl', 'blemish', 'equal', 'Perfect', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'father', 'losers', 'are', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'ability', 'commune', 'medium', 'best', 'are', 'turned', 'junk', 'worst', 'young', 'boy', 'serious', 'social', 'phobia', 'always', 'computer', 'collecting', 'oddities', 'checking', 'out', 'supposedly', 'cursed', 'magical', 'items', 'back', 'having', 'pay', 'getting', 'experience', 'gimmick', 'cost', 'When', 'letter', 'asking', 'Will', 'wind', 'yes', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'job', 'medium', 'connection', 'living', 'surface', 'anime', 'one', 'would', 'involve', 'lot', 'battles', 'would', 'mainly', 'delve', 'combat', 'dolls', 'do', 'fight', 'mainly', 'one', 'number', 'specifically', 'seldom', 'do', 'fights', 'really', 'push', 'Alice', 'Game', 'Mainly', 'deal', 'boy', 'growing', 'connection', 'group', 'Rozen', 'Maidens', 'fear', 'world', 'concern', 'sister', 'him.At', 'first', 'main', 'character', 'Rozen', 'Maiden', 'have', 'issues', 'one', 'grow', 'closer', 'passage', 'time', 'Other', 'Maidens', 'are', 'introduced', 'series', 'episodes', 'bring', 'specialized', 'tools', 'gifts', 'allow', 'delve', 'more', 'deeply', 'main', 'boy', 'psyche', 'explain', 'what', 'transpired', 'also', 'something', 'different', 'storyline', 'anime', 'enjoyed', 'that.This', 'not', 'say', 'show', 'seriousness', 'fighting', 'side', 'Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'dedicated', 'humor', 'Even', 'serious', 'ones', 'pieces', 'are', 'reserved', 'humor', 'example', 'Maidens', 'watch', 'show', 'pet', 'detective', 'TV', 'almost', 'episode', 'watching', 'puppet', 'show', 'pretty', 'funny', 'stuff', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'few', 'episodes', 'honestly', 'was', 'funny', 'graphic.This', 'good', '5/5', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'what', 'type', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'lot', 'fighting', 'outright', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'connections', 'other', 'hints', 'greater', 'destiny', 'main', 'are', 'hinted', 'latter', 'half', 'series.An', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'noting', 'course', 'length', 'series', 'only', '5', 'hours', '12', 'episodes']",Rozen Maiden Season 1 Collection
