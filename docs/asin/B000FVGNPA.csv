996682,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,B000FVGNPA,applewood,"[32, 32]","Any fan of Trucks will want this recording, but also any fan of good music too. What I like about this guy and this band is their open and sincere and high approach to music and culture and us as listeners (shows in how they relate to the audience and how they price this DVD).This recording is well if modestly done. Nothing flashy here, just 6 guys playing well together. I was a bit surprised to have the show start with a few short interviews introducing the band and their approach to the music. Then for the next 2+ hours we get the full uninterupted concert. And I loved the show! And I was also glad to have had the reminder of the intention behind it.I'm a big fan of Trucks but was more impressed by the rest of the band as well, the varied selection of tunes, the skill they played and interplayed with, and the general way they approach their task. As Trucks says in the intro these guys play as it is their church, and that includes us and the collective intention of the best the world has to offer.This is the way to approach music; from the sacred, with humility, playfulness, joy, inclusiveness, and the love of doing it right.",5,As Good As It Gets,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,1144,"['fan', 'Trucks', 'will', 'want', 'recording', 'also', 'fan', 'good', 'music', 'too', 'What', 'like', 'guy', 'band', 'open', 'sincere', 'high', 'approach', 'music', 'culture', 'listeners', 'shows', 'how', 'relate', 'audience', 'how', 'price', 'DVD', '.This', 'recording', 'well', 'modestly', 'done', 'Nothing', 'flashy', 'here', 'just', '6', 'guys', 'playing', 'well', 'together', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'have', 'show', 'start', 'few', 'short', 'interviews', 'introducing', 'band', 'approach', 'music', 'Then', 'next', '2+', 'hours', 'get', 'full', 'uninterupted', 'concert', 'loved', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'have', 'had', 'reminder', 'intention', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Trucks', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'rest', 'band', 'as', 'well', 'varied', 'selection', 'tunes', 'skill', 'played', 'interplayed', 'general', 'way', 'approach', 'task', 'Trucks', 'intro', 'guys', 'play', 'church', 'collective', 'intention', 'best', 'world', 'offer.This', 'way', 'approach', 'music', 'sacred', 'humility', 'playfulness', 'joy', 'inclusiveness', 'love', 'doing', 'right']",The Derek Trucks Band - Songlines Live!

996688,A1EZHHHUFALJUQ,B000FVGNPA,guitar19,"[8, 9]","Derek Trucks guitar prodigy, nephew of Allman Brothers drummer (Butch Trucks) is truely an incredible musician/guitarist. I have seen Derek Trucks live a couple times with his band and the Allman Brothers. Its been a long time seen I have ever seen a young guitarist in their prime. Derek has the passion any aspiring guitarist would have he shows his raw emotion, talent, and love for the guitar on songlines live. His band which formed in 1997 has members ranging from all over the world including Derek Trucks(guitar), Todd Smallie(bass), Yonrico Scott(drums, percussion), Kofi Burbridge(keyboards), Mike Mattison(vocals), and Count M'Butu(congas & percussion). This concert was shot live at The Park West in Chicago, Illinois January 28, 2006. This DVD is filled with great music from the opening song Joyful Noise to the closing Up Above My Head. My personal favorites include Crow Jane, Volunteered Slavery, Key To The Highway, All I Do, Sailing On, and Anyday. These songs have alot of different aspirations. Their are a couple bonus features which include behind songlines, life on the road, and derek trucks side projects which include the Allman Brothers, and Eric Clapton's 2006 tour. I highly recommend this to any guitarist/musician.

996689,A11ZW62AAM10NU,B000FVGNPA,Guitar Fan,"[2, 2]","These guys are all extremely talented and impressive. That is the first thing that stands out. The second thing is their ability to combine very diverse styles. Third is their unique way of combining multiple styles. Also in there is the surprise at Mike Mattison's ability to sing with completely different voices and styles and have complete conviction on each. I'm primarily a guitar fan and Derek Trucks is one of the few newer guitarists who can really deliver and connect with music in a passionate way. This is a good DVD and definitely a great price, but even with all of that, I just expected a little more from it. It could be me, but I just didn't connect with the music as much as I thought I would and I found myself skipping ahead 4 or 5 times. I love long instrumental jams and this has plenty of that and as I said earlier, when Mike steps up to sing, he really delivers, but I enjoyed their stuff on Crossroads 2007 far more. They just seemed to have a higher energy and dynamic there. I like hard rock, blues, some jazz, 70's era fusion (Jeff Beck, Al Dimeola, John McLaughlin etc), older Funk and R & B grooves and I like things mixed up in extended jams, so I did find this DVD to be enjoyable because these guys mix some of those and other styles in their own way, but some of the other influences seemed to lower the pulse of some of the jams. Jam bands put certain genres as the jam's musical core and bring the other stuff into it and I think that the core style is key to how well I connect with it. I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars at best ....

I've had this DVD for awhile, I'm just catching up on my reviews. Hands down, IMHO, Derek is well ahead of the pack of the great young guitar players out there today. Everyone marvels at his slide work, as they should, but he has shown that he can use his fingers on his fret board as well. He will only improve with age and that could be scary to the competition.Eric Clapton agrees with me too. He expressed that, (paraphrased) ""Derek Trucks has more licks and slide moves than most people who have had played for 5 times as long as he has"", in an interview with a local radio station, when he appeared here last fall.

I hadn't even thought about him lately until I spotted this DVD on sale at an area book/music store. The price was great, so I thought I'd give it a shot.What a band! This DVD is astounding! If you like a little funk and soul, stirred with some Southern Rock, and shaken with a generous shot of the blues and a dash of world music, then you are bound to like Songlines Live. I can't recall the last time I saw a music DVD where the band is so tight and the music so fluid as it it here (Well, maybe Boz Scaggs Greatest Hits Live).Some of the vocals are great and some I didn't care for, but I was never disappointed when Trucks and his band cut loose. My favorite here is the band's rendition of Key to the Highway. If you are familiar with Derek and the Dominoes' version (Eric Clapton's band), well Derek Trucks and his band just put them to shame. Trucks' play on that will make you forget you ever heard Clapton's version.This is one DVD that's going to get a lot of play at my house.
