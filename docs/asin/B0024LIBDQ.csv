1250127,A3MGKU008K95W9,B0024LIBDQ,"Christopher ""chris c""","[1, 2]","Decent film but lacks the charm and budget of Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. It has the distinct feel of a made for TV production even though it was a theatrical release. This was a Brittish, not a Hollywood, production; so perhaps that has something to do with it. Maybe it is unfair to compare the two films but in reality what I wanted was a worthy sequal with the same charm and tone of that first film and this film, while it tries, misses. The plot moves a bit slowly and the underwater sequences, at least on my home theatre, are very dark and murky (perhaps it's the print as the trailer actually looks better than the film). Robert Ryan as Nemo doesn't do much in the role. Chuck Conners is wooden but it seems as though the role was written that way. Overall it could have been much better but it isn't bad unless you compare this film to it's predecessor.",3,Wanted it to be better,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,874,"['Decent', 'film', 'charm', 'budget', 'Disney', '20,000', 'Leagues', 'Sea', 'distinct', 'feel', 'made', 'TV', 'production', 'even', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'Brittish', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'perhaps', 'something', 'do', 'Maybe', 'unfair', 'compare', 'two', 'films', 'reality', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'worthy', 'sequal', 'same', 'charm', 'tone', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'misses', 'plot', 'bit', 'slowly', 'underwater', 'sequences', 'least', 'home', 'theatre', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'murky', 'perhaps', 'print', 'trailer', 'actually', 'better', 'film', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'Nemo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'role', 'Chuck', 'Conners', 'wooden', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'way', 'Overall', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', ""n't"", 'bad', 'compare', 'film', 'predecessor']",Captain Nemo and the Underwater City

I almost forgot about a scene in the movie where Captain Nemo(Robert Ryan) and his second-in-command were walking in his fantastic undersea city and one of the beautiful female citizens just happens to walk into this scene wearing no panties; literally bottomless and with a child no less(I believe this scene was talked about on certain talk shows of the day).  This movie is a must see for those who enjoy science fiction movies.  I highly recommend it.,5,fantastic movie; must see for sci-fi fans,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,579,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'movie', 'was', 'finally', 'put', 'DVD', 'that', 'many', 'who', 'remember', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'now', 'almost', 'forgot', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'second-in-command', 'were', 'walking', 'fantastic', 'undersea', 'city', 'one', 'beautiful', 'female', 'citizens', 'just', 'walk', 'scene', 'wearing', 'panties', 'literally', 'bottomless', 'child', 'less', 'believe', 'scene', 'was', 'talked', 'certain', 'talk', 'shows', 'day', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'who', 'enjoy', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'highly', 'recommend']",Captain Nemo and the Underwater City
1250129,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0024LIBDQ,Einsatz,"[5, 5]","This movie begins with a terrific storm at sea....abandon ship!  The raging wind and rain abruptly give way to the eerie stillness of six bodies sinking beneath the sea (artfully shot by my favorite cinematographer, Alan Hume).  These people are quickly rescued and brought to the titled city, Templemir, home of the infamous Captain Nemo (played with supreme gruffness by Robert Ryan).  They soon learn that they are expected to become permanent guests.  Several of the guests refuse to accept this and almost immediately plot their escape, one, a claustrophobic, with grim results.  Also on hand are two greedy brothers interested in the abundance of gold found everywhere in the domed city.  Rounding out the six survivors are a senator (played by Chuck Connors), and a mother and her young son (plus a cat in a box).  Besides a fabulous tour of the place, including a walk through the underwater garden and fish pens, there's also a couple of minor scuffles with a huge monster called Mobula (basically a very big manta ray with an attitude).Nothing scary, the excitement level is kept to a minimum.  There's a confusing rant by Nemo against war but in the same breath, he levels threats of death to anyone who opposes him.  There's greed, backstabbing, destruction, and petty jealousy, it's all handled adequately; this is not a great movie.  It's a fun movie.  I've always had a fondness for it and others like it, basic adventure films.  I waited a long time to find a copy so it's definitely a keeper.",4,Beware Mobula!,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1509,"['movie', 'terrific', 'storm', 'sea', '.abandon', 'ship', 'raging', 'wind', 'rain', 'abruptly', 'give', 'way', 'eerie', 'stillness', 'six', 'bodies', 'sinking', 'sea', 'artfully', 'shot', 'favorite', 'cinematographer', 'Alan', 'Hume', 'people', 'are', 'quickly', 'rescued', 'brought', 'titled', 'city', 'Templemir', 'home', 'infamous', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'played', 'supreme', 'gruffness', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'soon', 'learn', 'are', 'expected', 'become', 'permanent', 'guests', 'Several', 'guests', 'refuse', 'accept', 'almost', 'immediately', 'plot', 'escape', 'one', 'claustrophobic', 'grim', 'results', 'Also', 'hand', 'are', 'two', 'greedy', 'brothers', 'interested', 'abundance', 'gold', 'found', 'everywhere', 'domed', 'city', 'Rounding', 'out', 'six', 'survivors', 'are', 'senator', 'played', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'mother', 'young', 'son', 'cat', 'box', 'fabulous', 'tour', 'place', 'including', 'walk', 'underwater', 'garden', 'fish', 'pens', 'also', 'couple', 'minor', 'scuffles', 'huge', 'monster', 'called', 'Mobula', 'basically', 'very', 'big', 'manta', 'ray', 'attitude', '.Nothing', 'scary', 'excitement', 'level', 'kept', 'minimum', 'confusing', 'rant', 'Nemo', 'war', 'same', 'breath', 'levels', 'threats', 'death', 'anyone', 'who', 'greed', 'backstabbing', 'destruction', 'petty', 'jealousy', 'handled', 'adequately', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'fun', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'fondness', 'others', 'basic', 'adventure', 'films', 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'find', 'copy', 'definitely', 'keeper']",Captain Nemo and the Underwater City
