1515718,A14GILA5IVI2Z3,B006IRQU44,KATELAND,"[0, 0]","This series explores the lifes of fugitives who are on the run. Wife killers, and serial killers. Some have been on the run from the law for 8 years it tells of there adventures. One of them hid away in Mexico, took odd jobs and relaxed in shady bars there. Another headed for a tropical island paradise. And thought they had got away with it. But you will see what tripped them up, and how they were hunted down. Two more of the series is about unexpecting women who marry men they didnt really know at all. Such as, one of the husbands was a Bigamist. And another was a Cuban Spy. As with all the True Crime Series, i enjoyed this one of VOLUME 3 as well.

I enjoy mainly British series such as &#34;Waking the Dead&#34; and &#34;Silent Witness&#34; both well written and characterised by the actors.
