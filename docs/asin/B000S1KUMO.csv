1084831,A3801HUY8KOMU0,B000S1KUMO,Abedsbrother,"[0, 0]","There are a lot of descriptions of what the movie is about, so I'll just tell you whether you should see it or not. I have not read the book, so I cannot make pronouncements of accuracy or faithfulness to the text. I'll be honest: I watch CSI: NY, and liked Claire Forlani's role on that show, and I was looking to see what else she had done. This popped up near the top of my searches. I don't really care that perhaps the demonstrated use of guns in the film may or may not have been incorrect. I'm just looking for involving entertainment; and one or two wooden acting performances won't spoil it for me.That said, I did not feel that anybody was particularly 'wooden' (contrary to other user reviews). Most people were serviceable in their roles; not outstanding, but not a bother either. Forlani and Oliver Hudson had good on-screen chemistry, and Josie Davis was also good. Carolina Moon DOES move at quite a leisurely pace, and most of the action between the scary parts consists of conversation, so if you are looking for super-powers and supernatural battles, or fisticuffs with the occasional gun drawn, you will be disappointed for the most part. The flashes of 'special' sight are used sparingly, and as a result have great impact. This is not an adventure film; it is more of a character study.I was reminded (in a vague way) of some of Tom Selleck's Jesse Stone movies. Not of the characters, the plots, or even the resolutions, but of the overall feel of the film. The countryside looks glorious, and the sun shines brightly - but there is menace lurking quietly in the shadows.First time viewers should be warned if they think this is a family film. Little is shown on screen; but, there are events that happen off-screen that include the beating of a child (10 - 12 years old) (not spanking, but whipping) by her father, as well as rape and murder of several characters (all seen in the flashes of the 'special' sight, so they are very brief, but can catch you unawares). I repeat, nothing is shown on- screen; but there was a director (Scorsese?) who said that the human imagination is more powerful than the most gruesome depiction on screen could be. Be warned!These are all peripheral considerations, though. Carolina Moon was for me a tense and moving picture that I will return to again to watch the characters, even though I now know the outcome. Special props to Forlani, Hudson, and their supporting cast for keeping their acting straight-forward, and for some directing which never gets in the way of the story.

Tory has psychic abilities and when Hope Lavelle goes missing, Tory knows she is dead and where the body can be found. This ability has got her into trouble previously. This murder proves to be one of a series of killings of young girls and Tory's father is an obvious suspect.

It is definitely a a romantic "" Who done it?"" film.  Although it tends to focus more on the romance it is one of the better made-for-television films that I have seen.It starts out when 2 girls Tori Bodeen and Hope LaVelle are playing together in a pond.  Tori comes from a poor family who rents the cabin on the property that belongs to Hope's family.  Both are about 10 years old.  Tori is also gifted.  She telepathic and can see the present and the past, but not the future.  Hope has an identical twin sister, Faith, but they couldn't be more different.  Cade, Hope's brother who is about 2 years older, has a crush on Tori.  Tori and Hope have agreed to meet.  That evening Tori gets a vision and her father, Han, beats her so badly that she can barely move.  That night Hope is raped and murdered and Tori sees it in her mind as if she was actually there.  About a week later Tori and her family move.  18 years later, Tori returns to her hometown, Progress, NC.  Tori meets Cade.  Hope's mother, Margaret, is the only one who doesn't believe in Tori's gift.  People start getting murdered.  Cade and Tori fall in love.  Tori opens a her store and eventually she befriends Faith who has had an on-again off-again relationship with Tori's cousin Wade for years.  Han escapes from prison.  All the clues lead to Han, but Tori can see inside his head and there is nothing going on inside the head of the person committing the murders.  Even Tori's mother and her store clerk end up getting murdered.  Cade and Tori get engaged.  Tori keeps getting clues from Hope while she is dreaming as to who the killer might be.  Wade and Faith finally get together in a serious relationship.  Ultimately Tori gets confronted by the killer and she uses her knowledge of his fears to distract him long enough for Cade, who shows up just after Tori saves herself, to get the gun away from him.  With the killer in custody Hope can finally rest in peace.The acting is good.  The plot is interesting and the film is romantic because of the relationship between Cade and Tori.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes romantic mysteries and made-for-television films.  There isn't much nudity or a great deal of violence, but there is some intrigue and if a person allows themselves to get into the story and not think about the end, then it is a very good film.",5,A Romantic Mystery,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2419,"['movie', 'based', 'Nora', 'Roberts', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'definitely', 'romantic', 'Who', 'done', 'film', 'focus', 'more', 'romance', 'one', 'better', 'made-for-television', 'films', 'have', 'seen.It', 'starts', 'out', 'when', '2', 'girls', 'Tori', 'Bodeen', 'Hope', 'LaVelle', 'are', 'playing', 'together', 'pond', 'Tori', 'poor', 'family', 'who', 'cabin', 'property', 'Hope', 'family', 'are', '10', 'years', 'old', 'Tori', 'also', 'gifted', 'telepathic', 'can', 'see', 'present', 'past', 'not', 'future', 'Hope', 'identical', 'twin', 'sister', 'Faith', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Cade', 'Hope', 'brother', 'who', '2', 'years', 'older', 'crush', 'Tori', 'Tori', 'Hope', 'have', 'agreed', 'meet', 'evening', 'Tori', 'vision', 'father', 'Han', 'so', 'badly', 'can', 'barely', 'move', 'night', 'Hope', 'raped', 'murdered', 'Tori', 'mind', 'was', 'actually', 'there', 'week', 'later', 'Tori', 'family', 'move', '18', 'years', 'later', 'Tori', 'hometown', 'Progress', 'NC', 'Tori', 'Cade', 'Hope', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tori', 'gift', 'People', 'start', 'getting', 'murdered', 'Cade', 'Tori', 'fall', 'love', 'Tori', 'store', 'eventually', 'Faith', 'who', 'had', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'Tori', 'cousin', 'Wade', 'years', 'Han', 'prison', 'clues', 'lead', 'Han', 'Tori', 'can', 'see', 'head', 'nothing', 'going', 'head', 'person', 'committing', 'murders', 'Even', 'Tori', 'mother', 'store', 'clerk', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'murdered', 'Cade', 'Tori', 'get', 'engaged', 'Tori', 'getting', 'clues', 'Hope', 'dreaming', 'who', 'killer', 'might', 'be', 'Wade', 'Faith', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Ultimately', 'Tori', 'confronted', 'killer', 'knowledge', 'fears', 'distract', 'long', 'enough', 'Cade', 'who', 'up', 'just', 'Tori', 'get', 'gun', 'away', 'killer', 'custody', 'Hope', 'can', 'finally', 'rest', 'peace.The', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'interesting', 'film', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Cade', 'Tori', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'romantic', 'mysteries', 'made-for-television', 'films', ""n't"", 'much', 'nudity', 'great', 'deal', 'violence', 'intrigue', 'person', 'get', 'story', 'not', 'think', 'end', 'then', 'very', 'good', 'film']",N/A

Finally some feel-good romance in with the gangsta wannabe's and teen drama, and her books always have a good plot, so not the transparent norm.  As for the movie itself, well ""based off"" is right as there are several things altered or switched around, but they did a pretty good job getting the feeling across, though it did feel a little rushed in places.  My question however is: as I don't like to watch movies on my computer, is it permissable to burn them onto dvd and watch them on my tv (I don't have Tivo)?  I think offering digital media is great as it will allow us access to movies we'd normally not be able to purchse, but to be honest, I'm little hesitant to buy something that would be gone if my pc ever went kuput and I didn't have a hard copy of it.
