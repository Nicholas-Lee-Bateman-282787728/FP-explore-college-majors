Alfred Molina portrays a former Cuban aristocrat/political prisoner - Juan Raul Perez - who has just been freed from jail. He has one goal; making it to America to find his wife (portrayed by Anjelica Huston) and daughter. But on the same boat is Dottie Perez - played by Marisa Tomei - who is trying to make it back from the wrong side of the tracks.And the hijinks kicks into gear when an official for U.S. Immigration believes they- Juan and Dottie - are married, which sets in motion a number of events where the ""Perez Family"" takes on a whole new meaning. With wit and a play on the politics of the time, director Mira Nair delivers a well-paced movie where romance takes a unique twist for those who truly value living life (with personal freedom) to the fullest each day.",4,The Search for the Meaning of Family,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,1205,"['1995', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'gotten', 'second-life', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'box-office', 'failure', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'Company', 'made', 'around', '[', ']', 'was', 'nowhere', 'covering', '[', ']', 'production', 'cost.Based', '1991', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'author', 'Christine', 'Bell', 'backdrop', '1980', 'Mariel', 'boatlift', 'quest', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'beginning', '.but', 'twist', 'last', 'name', 'Perez', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'former', 'Cuban', 'aristocrat/political', 'prisoner', 'Juan', 'Raul', 'Perez', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'freed', 'jail', 'one', 'goal', 'making', 'America', 'find', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'daughter', 'same', 'boat', 'Dottie', 'Perez', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'back', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks.And', 'hijinks', 'gear', 'when', 'official', 'U.S.', 'Immigration', 'they-', 'Juan', 'Dottie', 'are', 'married', 'motion', 'number', 'events', 'where', 'Perez', 'Family', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'wit', 'play', 'politics', 'time', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'well-paced', 'movie', 'where', 'romance', 'unique', 'twist', 'who', 'truly', 'value', 'living', 'life', 'personal', 'freedom', 'fullest', 'day']",Perez Family VHS

It's also directed by one of the least recognized and gifted directors of our time, Mira Nair.Nair is best known for movies dealing with Indian culture like &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; and last year's &quot;Monsoon Wedding,&quot; but here she strays from her normal interests and makes a movie about Cubans who come to the United States seeking political asylum.  Specifically, the movie centers around Dottie Perez (Tomei) and Juan Raul Perez (Molina), who are of no relation to each other except for the fact that they come to the United States with a heart full of dreams which are quickly shattered.  Dottie is smitten by John Wayne and comes with the hopes of someday sleeping with him.  Juan was incarcerated in a Cuban prison for 20 years and comes hoping to find the wife and daughter he has not seen in that time.  They both come to Miami on the same boat, and circumstances force them to act as if they were a &quot;family&quot;.  This arrangement soon becomes more than just a strategic plan, as they quickly develop romantic feelings for each other.The acting in this movie is surprisingly good.  I had gotten so used to seeing Marisa Tomei doing her New York accent in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; that I didn't think she'd be able to be convincing as a Cuban refugee.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Alfred Molina was also very good, and so was Anjelica Huston who played his estranged wife.  I also thought the movie had a great musical score.I would have given this movie five stars if it wasn't for the fact that I wasn't really satisfied with the way the movie ended.  Though I won't give away the ending, I'll say that it was entirely too simplistic.  Though, that's just a minor flaw.

479805,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6305812322,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[2, 5]","Mira Nair is, without a doubt (in my opinion), one of the finest contemporary filmmakers today.  I am not just talking finest Indian filmmakers--I mean filmmaker in any language, context, culture or genre.  Nair has a real knack for storytelling, through a glowing combination of luscious cinematography, compelling and believeable direction and great pacing.  Unfortunately, if you see THE PEREZ FAMILY, this wonderful gift she has is not front and center.  In fact, it's not even off to the side in the background.  This might be (partly) due to the fact that Nair's attempt in telling the story of the Marielitos of the 1980s (boat people who crossed the waters from Cuba to the United States, in lieu of Castro's dictatorship) deals much with a culture with which she is unfamiliar.  For me, this film and story seemed cartoonish (at best) and very unappealing.Juan Perez (Alfred Molina) has just been released from prison and is arriving in Florida, after being locked up for twenty years, away from his beautiful wife, Carmela (Angelica Houston) and daughter, Teresa (Trini Alvarado).  He is hoping that time hasn't dulled his wife's vigilance, as she awaits his return.  On his journey to the United States, he encounters Dottie Perez (Marisa Tomei), who is filled with stars in her eyes and rumba in her hips.  Together, they form a ""family"" of sorts, along with a little vagabond they encounter and a mute old man, who is very prone to climbing trees and (in the words of Juan) ""looking for Cuba.""  My reaction to all this:  ""QUE?!!!""  (translation:  ""What???!!"")  Okay, for starters, the main problem I had was with Marisa Tomei.  I know they call what she does ""acting"" for a reason.  Granted,  British actor Sir Anthony Hopkins played Pablo Picasso (Spaniard), Peter Sellers played Inspector Clouseu (French), but Marisa Tomei (a beautiful actress of Italian descent) playing sultry Cubana, Dotty, was too much of a stretch for me.  For starters, the accents were so fake!  I have a Cuban aunt, in Florida, and believe you and me, they were overdoing it in this film.  They sounded like they had had some bad novacaine shots at times, and it wasn't good.  Also, the stereotypical depiction of Cubans was on the insulting side.Skip this film and see the films that really put Mira Nair on the map, as a filmmaker.

Both Juan Perez (Alfred Molina) and Dottie (strangers to one another) leave Cuba in a boatlift to come to the USA.

479808,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6305812322,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 4]","I remember seeing this a couple of years ago. I was drawn to this film by the cast list and in fairness I should have spotted that this film about Cubans had very few Cuban or even Latino actors in it. Anyway, aside from that the plot has historical context but I am not familiar enough with it to say if it was accurate or not, although I really don't think it matters very much. The film tries to fizzle with Latin spirit while at the same time delivering a rather convoluted romantic drama of sorts. It partly works but the writing isn't great and the film failed to really engage me as it just seemed a little forced as if it had been a good idea once but had had so many knobs added to it that it got a little daffy. After an hour it settles into the formulaic mould it was in all along, the historical context forgotten and the clich&#65533;s allowed to flow. If you can't see where this is going then I salute your ability to blindly accept what is given to you.Talking of clich&#65533;s, the casting of so few Hispanic/Cuban/Latino actors was a mystery to me. Surely it would have been possible to get closer than Italian, which is what quite a few of the main characters appear to be. Tomei was the name that drew me to this film but in turns her role is good and bad. She has an important role and it was necessary for her to be feisty etc but she overdoes it a little bit - hammy up her Latin clich&#65533; at the start for all she is worth; she gets better though. Molina is another strange choice but he does well in his role and carries some dignity through the film - it's not his fault that the script gets silly in trying to keep him and Huston apart. Huston is OK but her subplot seems added on to make the ending more palatable to the audience (god forbid anyone should be hurt). For this same reason, Palminteri is wasted. Cruz is good and Chowdhry is quite funny, but why Gallo even bothered is beyond me - pre-fame I suppose. SNL's Cleghorne plays a cop and, in the spirit of ethnic clich&#65533;s, pushes the `oh-no-she-didn't' eye-rolling, `talk to the hand', neck moving black character for all she is worth - when she does it as a joke it is OK but here it just felt like laziness - especially for such a minor character.Overall, any Hollywood film with Latinos/Cubans/Hispanics in it is going to force the rhythm for all it is worth and here is no different. It starts out boasting historical context and spice, falls into a rather convoluted series of plot twists that end up taking the film down a rom-com road to a solution that, although badly delivered, unthinkable and out-of-nowhere, was obvious from about 30 minutes into the film.",3,Marisa Tomei is an absolute delight and the movie is decent too.,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2666,"['remember', 'seeing', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'drawn', 'film', 'cast', 'list', 'fairness', 'should', 'have', 'spotted', 'film', 'Cubans', 'had', 'very', 'few', 'Cuban', 'even', 'Latino', 'actors', 'Anyway', 'aside', 'plot', 'historical', 'context', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'enough', 'say', 'was', 'accurate', 'not', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'tries', 'fizzle', 'Latin', 'spirit', 'same', 'time', 'delivering', 'rather', 'convoluted', 'romantic', 'drama', 'sorts', 'partly', 'writing', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'failed', 'really', 'engage', 'just', 'seemed', 'little', 'forced', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'once', 'had', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'knobs', 'added', 'got', 'little', 'daffy', 'hour', 'formulaic', 'mould', 'was', 'along', 'historical', 'context', 'forgotten', 'clich', '65533', 's', 'allowed', 'flow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'going', 'then', 'salute', 'ability', 'blindly', 'accept', 'what', 'given', 'you.Talking', 'clich', '65533', 's', 'casting', 'so', 'few', 'Hispanic/Cuban/Latino', 'actors', 'was', 'mystery', 'Surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'get', 'closer', 'Italian', 'what', 'quite', 'few', 'main', 'characters', 'appear', 'be', 'Tomei', 'was', 'name', 'drew', 'film', 'role', 'good', 'bad', 'important', 'role', 'was', 'necessary', 'be', 'feisty', 'etc', 'little', 'bit', 'hammy', 'Latin', 'clich', '65533', 'start', 'worth', 'better', 'Molina', 'strange', 'choice', 'well', 'role', 'dignity', 'film', 'not', 'fault', 'script', 'silly', 'trying', 'keep', 'Huston', 'apart', 'Huston', 'OK', 'subplot', 'added', 'make', 'ending', 'more', 'palatable', 'audience', 'god', 'forbid', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'hurt', 'same', 'reason', 'Palminteri', 'wasted', 'Cruz', 'good', 'Chowdhry', 'quite', 'funny', 'why', 'Gallo', 'even', 'bothered', 'pre-fame', 'suppose', 'SNL', 'Cleghorne', 'cop', 'spirit', 'ethnic', 'clich', '65533', 's', 'oh-no-she-did', ""n't"", 'eye-rolling', 'talk', 'hand', 'neck', 'moving', 'black', 'character', 'worth', 'when', 'joke', 'OK', 'here', 'just', 'felt', 'laziness', 'especially', 'such', 'minor', 'character.Overall', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'Latinos/Cubans/Hispanics', 'going', 'force', 'rhythm', 'worth', 'here', 'different', 'out', 'boasting', 'historical', 'context', 'spice', 'rather', 'convoluted', 'series', 'plot', 'twists', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'film', 'down', 'rom-com', 'road', 'solution', 'badly', 'delivered', 'unthinkable', 'out-of-nowhere', 'was', 'obvious', '30', 'minutes', 'film']",Perez Family VHS

She played her character in such an exaggerated manner that it almost felt cartoonish, although I felt she improved as the movie progressed.

479810,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,6305812322,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[0, 0]","This movie didn't have much of an interesting story, but I'll have to say that Marisa Tomei stole the show for at least, being tasty eye candy on the screen.  How often do you get a chance to see a sexy girl showing armpit hair, huh? On her, it was very sexy!As a DVD, the picture quality of this film is very good, but the story kinda dragged, about people coming to America from Cuba back in 1980.  It is no where's near the intensity of the directionless refugees that came to America as portrayed in ""Scarface"", but it did offer a more disturbing depiction of refugees coming here hope to have a better life than what they had.Even though Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" was even more depressing, I still enjoyed that story better than this ""moving slowly, going nowhere"" Cubans coming to America, half-hearted effort kind of film.And, as I read of other reviews on this film, I just don't see the beauty of Angelica Huston as other people do.  To me, she looks like a ""guy"" trying to be a woman.  She did nothing for me at all. I just don't see much of an appeal for her.  No offense.At least I will say this though.  The DVD video quality is pretty decent.  I don't think that I would bother to upgrade to Blu-Ray. For the sake of the weakness of this movies story, I think this DVD is good enough.I probably wouldn't watch this film again unless a friend or someone in my family saw it on my shelf, and asked to watch it. So, I guess I'll keep it as DVD shelf fodder.
