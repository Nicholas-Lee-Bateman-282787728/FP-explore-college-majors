I was shocked at the number of people I know who have never heard of the book or the movie.  Big thing is the moral or message of the story is the same.  overdoing will make you never want to do something again.,4,nice movie,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,271,"['Usual', 'ok', 'movie', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'shocked', 'number', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'book', 'movie', 'Big', 'thing', 'moral', 'message', 'story', 'same', 'overdoing', 'will', 'make', 'never', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'again']",N/A

Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson costars in this as the straight man in this zany picture, just thought you should know,he's funny also.Highly Recommended.",5,What A Fun Zany Classic Film .,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,813,"['got', 'be', 'zany', 'film', 'i', 'ever', 'saw', 'i', 'caught', 'TCM', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'couple', 'weeks', 'i', 'just', 'loved', 'quite', 'funny', 'same', 'premise', '1985', 'film', 'starring', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'John', 'Candy', 'writing', 'alittle', 'sharp', 'good', 'way', 'joy', 'watch', 'guy', 'uncle', 'alot', 'money', 'catch', 'spend', 'million', '30', 'days', 'can', 'do', 'i', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'catch', 'TCM', 'buy', 'vhs', 'tape', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'do', 'hope', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'future', 'classic.The', 'Cast', 'picture', 'excellent', 'direction', 'great', 'too', 'Eddie', ""'Rochester"", 'Anderson', 'costars', 'straight', 'man', 'zany', 'picture', 'just', 'thought', 'should', 'know', 'funny', 'also.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

And it's nice to see and hear and feel what a couple in love looks like before they marry.  Monty has to spend a million dollars two months before his 30th birthday and he can't tell his friends or his fiance about it.  If he succeeds, he will earn 7 million dollars in inheritance.  How Monty does succeed in spending one million against all odds is the really fun plot.  There wasn't a dull moment in this film, and it's nearly fingernail-biting suspense in the last six minutes of the film, too.  Helen Walker plays Monty Brewster's stunningly beautiful if serious fiance in this utterly zany extravaganza.

Most times the original is the better and this for sure is the better.Its about 3 GIs who were just out of the WW2 army and one has been notified that he has inherited money. Not just money, but millions with one catch, he must spend one million dollars within 3 months and not tell anyone why or having any assets when it is spent. Seems easy???? not so but hold on, you will laugh like you have never laughed before and Eddie &#34;Rochester&#34; Anderson will keep you laughing from beginning to end.

1094844,A5JJCPUHAONPK,B000UE2XH4,Old Film Lover,"[0, 1]","I looked forward to seeing this movie, which I'd never seen before, but couldn't get past about the 20-minute mark, because the DVD started skipping wildly at that point. There is nothing wrong with my player, as all my other new DVDs play well on it. But this DVD is not from one of the major DVD producers (Warner, etc.); it's from a minor company called Henstooth.Based on experience, I never buy DVD-Rs because they always skip or freeze in my standard DVD player. But this DVD is not supposed to be a DVD-R; it is advertised as a regular DVD, so I expected no problem. But it acted just like a DVD-R.To be fair to the company, I may have just been unlucky. I didn't try to seek a replacement (as I would have, had it been a Warner or Fox or MGM DVD); I just assumed I'd been sold a disguised DVD-R, and washed my hands of the matter, and took my refund. So I'm not bashing Henstooth. All I can say is that my only purchase from them so far is a DVD that is unplayable, and this makes me hesitant to order one of their DVDs again. If someone from Henstooth sees this review, and replies indicating that they will send me any number of replacements until I get one that plays, and if I eventually obtain a working DVD of this film, then I will see what I can do about writing a review of the actual contents of the film, the image quality, etc.",1,My Brewster's Millions DVD Was Unplayable,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,1347,"['looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', '20-minute', 'mark', 'DVD', 'started', 'skipping', 'wildly', 'point', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'player', 'other', 'new', 'DVDs', 'play', 'well', 'DVD', 'not', 'one', 'major', 'DVD', 'producers', 'Warner', 'etc', 'minor', 'company', 'called', 'Henstooth.Based', 'experience', 'never', 'buy', 'DVD-Rs', 'always', 'skip', 'freeze', 'standard', 'DVD', 'player', 'DVD', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'DVD-R', 'advertised', 'regular', 'DVD', 'so', 'expected', 'problem', 'acted', 'just', 'DVD-R.To', 'be', 'fair', 'company', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'unlucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'seek', 'replacement', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'been', 'Warner', 'Fox', 'MGM', 'DVD', 'just', 'assumed', ""'d"", 'been', 'sold', 'disguised', 'DVD-R', 'washed', 'hands', 'matter', 'took', 'refund', ""'m"", 'not', 'bashing', 'Henstooth', 'can', 'say', 'only', 'purchase', 'so', 'far', 'DVD', 'unplayable', 'hesitant', 'order', 'one', 'DVDs', 'again', 'someone', 'Henstooth', 'review', 'replies', 'indicating', 'will', 'send', 'number', 'replacements', 'get', 'one', 'eventually', 'obtain', 'working', 'DVD', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'writing', 'review', 'actual', 'contents', 'film', 'image', 'quality', 'etc']",N/A

O'Keefe and Walker make a great couple in this light comedy with great support work by mostly B actors and the great Gail Patrick.  As a fantasy film it clearly touches most of the problems and benefits of being thrust into having to spend money (with restrictions).  The pacing is good throughout and keeps your interest right up to the frantic conclusion.
