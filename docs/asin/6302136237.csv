297818,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,6302136237,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","The fifties was the last great era for movie musicals, movies that featured some of the best music made for movies as well as adapting music to fit the film. Musicals seem to fall out of favor as times changed leaving a few classics in the sixties and the rare occasional film later on, but the fifties featured the best.One film that fell into this category but not quite was STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER. While featuring some great music, it wasn't the song and dance style seen in most films. Instead this movie was a biographical picture about the life and times of composer John Phillips Sousa, a man whose marches everyone had heard even if they don't recognize the name. Sure you hear it mention every Fourth of July but would you really know the name otherwise?The film doesn't go back to his birth but to the birth of his music. It opens with Sousa about to retire from the Marines in the hope of beginning his own band in order to make more money. As played by Clifton Webb, Sousa seems pretty stiff but we soon see him open up and become more accessible. Between trying to sing a ballad for his wife he's written hoping to steer clear of marches, she knows he can't sing well and speeds it up showing how this song will be a march as well.He also opens up when a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; named Willie Little (Robert Wagner) invites him to hear his songs played in public. What he doesn't tell Sousa is that it's at a music hall where the crowd is more interested in hearing and seeing the dancing girls. Once he sees the girl Little has brought him to see he stays as well. She later performs a number for Sousa and his wife in their home and while he offers her criticism he takes her on to learn more about performing.Sousa's career flourishes and his band achieves great success. Throughout the film we are treated to hearing some of his greatest pieces including Semper Fidelis which became the Marine Corps hymn, Washington Post March and of course Stars and Stripes forever. Each song is easily identifiable and you'll love hearing them performed in this film.The film is much like many bio pics done in that time period, relying less on facts and more on drama and trying to involve viewers in the lives of those on screen. Its not that it twists the facts around or distorts them completely, but to try and compress an entire life into 90 minutes doesn't leave lots of time for details. For instance the invention of the Sousaphone isn't factual here nor is the character of Willie Little. But they do move the story along.Perhaps I got a bit more enjoyment out of this film having played trombone in band back in high school and having played some of these songs there. Perhaps it's the patriotic feeling that many of Sousa's songs inspire each time they are heard. Or maybe it's just because the film seen here is entertaining without being salacious or sleazy that makes it such a treat.This new blu-ray edition also includes several items that fans will enjoy. Most are background on the real John Phillips Sousa but also discuss movies in that time period that were made and the music he wrote. These are just extra treats for those who appreciate his contribution to music. All in all this is a great film to add to your collection if you love his music and musical films of the fifties.",4,A CELEBRATION OF SPIRIT,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3312,"['fifties', 'was', 'last', 'great', 'era', 'movie', 'musicals', 'movies', 'featured', 'best', 'music', 'made', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'adapting', 'music', 'fit', 'film', 'Musicals', 'seem', 'fall', 'favor', 'times', 'changed', 'leaving', 'few', 'classics', 'sixties', 'rare', 'occasional', 'film', 'later', 'fifties', 'featured', 'best.One', 'film', 'fell', 'category', 'not', 'quite', 'was', 'STARS', 'AND', 'STRIPES', 'FOREVER', 'featuring', 'great', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'song', 'dance', 'style', 'seen', 'most', 'films', 'Instead', 'movie', 'was', 'biographical', 'picture', 'life', 'times', 'composer', 'John', 'Phillips', 'Sousa', 'man', 'marches', 'everyone', 'had', 'heard', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'name', 'Sure', 'hear', 'mention', 'Fourth', 'July', 'would', 'really', 'know', 'name', 'otherwise', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'birth', 'birth', 'music', 'Sousa', 'retire', 'Marines', 'hope', 'beginning', 'own', 'band', 'order', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'played', 'Clifton', 'Webb', 'Sousa', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'soon', 'see', 'open', 'up', 'become', 'more', 'accessible', 'Between', 'trying', 'sing', 'ballad', 'wife', 'written', 'hoping', 'steer', 'clear', 'marches', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'well', 'speeds', 'up', 'showing', 'how', 'song', 'will', 'be', 'march', 'well.He', 'also', 'up', 'when', 'young', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'named', 'Willie', 'Little', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'hear', 'songs', 'played', 'public', 'What', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Sousa', 'music', 'hall', 'where', 'crowd', 'more', 'interested', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'dancing', 'girls', 'Once', 'girl', 'Little', 'brought', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'number', 'Sousa', 'wife', 'home', 'criticism', 'learn', 'more', 'performing.Sousa', 'career', 'flourishes', 'band', 'great', 'success', 'film', 'are', 'treated', 'hearing', 'greatest', 'pieces', 'including', 'Semper', 'Fidelis', 'became', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'hymn', 'Washington', 'Post', 'March', 'course', 'Stars', 'Stripes', 'forever', 'song', 'easily', 'identifiable', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hearing', 'performed', 'film.The', 'film', 'much', 'many', 'bio', 'pics', 'done', 'time', 'period', 'relying', 'less', 'facts', 'more', 'drama', 'trying', 'involve', 'viewers', 'lives', 'screen', 'not', 'facts', 'distorts', 'completely', 'try', 'compress', 'entire', 'life', '90', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lots', 'time', 'details', 'instance', 'invention', 'Sousaphone', ""n't"", 'factual', 'here', 'character', 'Willie', 'Little', 'do', 'move', 'story', 'got', 'bit', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'having', 'played', 'trombone', 'band', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'having', 'played', 'songs', 'there', 'Perhaps', 'patriotic', 'feeling', 'many', 'Sousa', 'songs', 'inspire', 'time', 'are', 'heard', 'just', 'film', 'seen', 'here', 'entertaining', 'being', 'salacious', 'sleazy', 'such', 'treat.This', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'also', 'several', 'items', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Most', 'are', 'background', 'real', 'John', 'Phillips', 'Sousa', 'also', 'discuss', 'movies', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'made', 'music', 'wrote', 'are', 'just', 'extra', 'treats', 'who', 'appreciate', 'contribution', 'music', 'great', 'film', 'add', 'collection', 'love', 'music', 'musical', 'films', 'fifties']",N/A

There is precious little about Sousa himself, but Clifton Webb is sturdy and reliable as always and believably married to Ruth Hussey.  The plot really centers around the beautiful Robert Wagner and Debra Paget, who can't keep their hands off of each other during the movie - and why not?  It's fun to watch!  Interestingly, Ruth Hussey has a very liberal opinion of sex and encourages them to make out all they want, while Clifton is a bit of a priss until he finds out they are really married.  Fox went all out with large production shots with lots of extras and glittering costumes, and the Blu-Ray disc is quite stunning - crisp, detailed, with vivid color and an extraordinarily stable image.  The movie has a big production number, ""Springtime in New York,"" staged by Nick Castle and it turns out this and another stage song were really written by Alfred Newman and Ken Darby, not Sousa.  And - this was a big discovery - there is a nearly exact precedent set for 1954's ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" with one of Sousa's marches being interpreted by the Scots and the Swiss, just as ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" was done by members of the Donahue family in the latter film.  There is also a stirring ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" performed by the African American group, the Stone Mountain Choir, that's dropped into the movie, leaves a lasting impression, and then all black characters disappear.  Did I use the word ""plot"" earlier?  This purported biography barely has one.  Narration is read by Casey Adams (the actor from ""Niagara,"" later known as Max Showalter) stringing along bits of Sousa's life, but key plot points center around the mutual admiration between Sousa and Wagner's character, whether or not the band will find an audience in the South, playing for President Benjamin Harrison and other quick fade-outs.  There is a stirring patriotic ending (with Wagner on crutches - again; remember ""With A Song in My Heart""?) and coming into the then-present day (1952) with our troops marching, marching, marching to the great Sousa's title tune.  This is first-class Fox, my favorite studio.

297837,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,6302136237,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[73, 78]","This is an amusing little yarn on Sousa and his music.  Being only about 90 minutes long the movie does not attempt to be comprehensive with his life, but concentrates instead on creating a portrait of him.  Clifton Webb has Sousa's somewhat stiff, yet humorous personality down pretty well.  The episodes depicted in the movie are brief vignettes, loosely based on some actual events.  The Marine Corps probably did treat their March King in a rather off-hand manner as shown in the movie.  Sousa did make the Marine Band from a 3rd rate emsemble into one of the best military bands in the country, and the Marines could not really offer him anymore than what they had already given him.The truth is Sousa saw an opportunity to market himself to a growing American audience that was starting to become more sophisticated in its musical tastes.  He would perfect the band tour concept.  Others had done it before him, but Sousa would make himself into a super-star, and truly traveled the world.  The movie accurately shows his formation of his own Sousa band after leaving the Marines in 1892.  Where the movie strays a bit is with the silly sideline romance.  Here we have the typical 1950s guy meets girl thing going on.  It's cute, but kind of takes away from the subject matter.  Its also hard to say whether this is a musical or not?  There is a lot of singing and show numbers presented, based, supposedly on Sousa's music.  We do get to hear some good versions of ""Semper Fidelis"" which is played ad noseum!I would have liked this movie a lot more if it had been a little more serious and showcased some more of Sousa's music.  He really did write more than just 10 marches you know!  Plus countless classical transcriptions, overtures, songs, novely items and arrangements of old American folk music.  Sousa was our most prolific composer, his music typifies an era that is no more in this country.  The Sousa band didn't march as much as shown in the movie.  The band was intended as a symphonic ensemble.  Sousa had enough marching from his Marine days!  His band was certainly accomplished, and had some very fine players in it.  To say as Americans often do that it was the best in the  world is a bit of Yankee over-statement.  Compared to most bands in the US, yes, the Sousa band was among the best.  Abroad in Europe there were many fine military bands that were just as good.  Sousa knew this, and he was careful not to over-step his bounds.  He received many fine praise from European audiences, and this must have pleased him very much indeed.  Sousa knew that the Coldstream Guards in London, The Garde Du Corps in Berlin and many others were just as good, lacking only the showmanship and Sousa's ability to market himself and his band and music.The movie shows the warm relationship Sousa had with his wife, who always supported him and his music.  ""Stars and Stripes"" came into Sousa's mind whilst returning from abroad after he had learned that his manager had died in the States. The movie cleverly marches us into the Sousa legend at the end which is probably just as good an ending as any.  This is an old style movie with a lot of cute touches in it.  It provides a musical fastasy of Sousa and his times.  You can get an idea of who the March King was by watching it, but in order to get a truer picture I would suggust Paul E.

Score by John Philip Sousa and AlfredNewman. Make up by Ben Nye. Produced by Lamar Trotti.Starring Clifton Webb(as John Philip Sousa) Debra Paget, RobertWagner, Ruth Hussey, Finlay Currie, George Chakaris and Roy Gordon asPresident Benjamin Harrison.The biography of famous American composer John Philip Sousa coveringthe period from the Presidency of Benjamin Harrison to the end of theSpanish American War which inspired Sousa to compose his greatest workThe Stars and Stripes Forever. The film concludes with his playing itfor the first time at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.Since Sousa was not a drunk, a drug addict, adulterer or any of theother problems that seem to beset the modern musician and since Sousabasically went from success to success with nary a set back, the filmlacks much in the way of any real drama. Sousa writes songs. They areall incredibly popular. He forms a band which was apparently the GayNineties version of the Beatles and tours successfully. And that is it.A fictional young couple--Wagner and a staggerly gorgeous Paget--areadded to provide a little drama both with the usual travails of younglove and the Spanish American War.Mostly however the film is simply a very light albeit pleasing 90minutes spent with wonderful music, likable actors and littlehistorical touches that indicate what an elevated level the Classic Ageof Movies operated on. The film makes casual references verbal and/orvisual to Sgt Quirck(from WHAT PRICE GLORY), the Chicago World's Fair,the Bowery, the five American Presidents Sousa played for, the variousmusical styles of the period, the Civil War, Queen Victoria, KaiserWilhelm etc etc and assumes that the viewer is educated enough tounderstand and/or recognize them. Besides watching with wonder the ideathat a Marching Band could take the world by storm(the Beatlescomparison is very apt), this is everyone's big chance to see BenjaminHarrison portrayed for the first and probably last time in a movie.No Stairway to Heaven but again pleasant viewing.Recommended.",5,A glorious patriotic historical musical like they are not allowed to make any more,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,2121,"['STARS', 'AND', 'STRIPES', 'FOREVER', '1952', 'Directed', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'Based', 'thebook', 'John', 'Philip', 'Sousa', 'Score', 'John', 'Philip', 'Sousa', 'AlfredNewman', 'Make', 'up', 'Ben', 'Nye', 'Produced', 'Lamar', 'Trotti.Starring', 'Clifton', 'Webb', 'John', 'Philip', 'Sousa', 'Debra', 'Paget', 'RobertWagner', 'Ruth', 'Hussey', 'Finlay', 'Currie', 'George', 'Chakaris', 'Roy', 'Gordon', 'asPresident', 'Benjamin', 'Harrison.The', 'biography', 'famous', 'American', 'composer', 'John', 'Philip', 'Sousa', 'coveringthe', 'period', 'Presidency', 'Benjamin', 'Harrison', 'end', 'theSpanish', 'American', 'War', 'inspired', 'Sousa', 'compose', 'greatest', 'workThe', 'Stars', 'Stripes', 'Forever', 'film', 'playing', 'itfor', 'first', 'time', 'Brooklyn', 'Navy', 'Yard.Since', 'Sousa', 'was', 'not', 'drunk', 'drug', 'addict', 'adulterer', 'theother', 'problems', 'seem', 'beset', 'modern', 'musician', 'Sousabasically', 'went', 'success', 'success', 'nary', 'set', 'back', 'filmlacks', 'much', 'way', 'real', 'drama', 'Sousa', 'songs', 'areall', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'band', 'was', 'apparently', 'GayNineties', 'version', 'Beatles', 'tours', 'successfully', 'it.A', 'fictional', 'young', 'couple', 'Wagner', 'staggerly', 'gorgeous', 'Paget', 'areadded', 'provide', 'little', 'drama', 'usual', 'travails', 'younglove', 'Spanish', 'American', 'War.Mostly', 'however', 'film', 'simply', 'very', 'light', 'pleasing', '90minutes', 'spent', 'wonderful', 'music', 'likable', 'actors', 'littlehistorical', 'touches', 'indicate', 'what', 'elevated', 'level', 'Classic', 'Ageof', 'Movies', 'operated', 'film', 'casual', 'references', 'verbal', 'and/orvisual', 'Sgt', 'Quirck', 'WHAT', 'PRICE', 'GLORY', 'Chicago', 'World', 'Fair', 'Bowery', 'five', 'American', 'Presidents', 'Sousa', 'played', 'variousmusical', 'styles', 'period', 'Civil', 'War', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'KaiserWilhelm', 'etc', 'etc', 'viewer', 'educated', 'enough', 'tounderstand', 'and/or', 'recognize', 'watching', 'ideathat', 'Marching', 'Band', 'could', 'take', 'world', 'storm', 'Beatlescomparison', 'very', 'apt', 'everyone', 'big', 'chance', 'see', 'BenjaminHarrison', 'portrayed', 'first', 'probably', 'last', 'time', 'movie.No', 'Stairway', 'Heaven', 'again', 'pleasant', 'viewing.Recommended']",N/A

They played it on TV in the 1990s but they obviously sped up the recording to fit in more commercials- what an insult, especially for a musical.  Well, it is not really a musical because the music was restricted to performances of Sousa's band and his shows- that is the characters did not sing and dance thorough any depiction of their lives.In one sense the film is typical Hollywood, but it had a nice, comfortable turn-of the-century flavor that was very appealing, the characters were all very likable, the the story was much more than just links between the musical performances of Sousa's work.
