What a laugh. Steve Guttenberg tries to do a drama? Gee whiz. It is very, very difficult to take him as a serious actor, but I like him better in comedies. For a while, The Bedroom Window kinda of works for me, but it eventually falls apart the moment when Sylvia acknowledges Henderson during the ballet show as if he is just a harmless, albino dude before getting killed. That is the moment where I went, ""What the f...?"" Afterwards, it pretty much collapses under its own weight. The last 15 minutes of the film are as absurd as it gets. Obviously, it is impossible for Terry Lambert to escape what had happened during the killing of Sylvia, and all witnesses will be pointing at him. So, basically, he is screwed, no matter what. Oddly enough, the cops don't pursue him hard enough, allowing him free to do whatever he wants. Interestingly, I didn't think there was any evidence linking Terry to other murders as far as forensics went. So what if he was spotted at the bar? It doesn't make a difference. Yeah...the contact lenses, brilliant. Maybe he got drunk and slept with them on? It does happen, you know? Or perhaps he got a pair of glasses too? What a stupid film. That is actually the moment in court where Steve attempted to turn a drama into a comedy piece which also killed the film.

Being a huge fan of Hitchcock's works and other suspense movies like ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Body Double"", I found this movie pretty good. I personally think Steve is a decent actor, just limited in roles suited to him. This role was suited to him as was ""Cocoon"". Purest may not be impressed by this movie, but those not so demanding should find this worth their while.The story in a nutshell is Guttenberg is sleeping with the bosses wife so when she sees an attempted murder she can't report it so Steve does instead. Since it is a man reporting they are more suspicious of him thinking either he's a voyuer or worse yet perhaps the perpetrator. Things get tense as he tries to prove his innocence and the real culprit is aware of the bosses wife and him. Is this a ripoff of the Hitchcock movie. A little, but the update and slight story change make it interesting and different enough that I found it entertaining.By the way don't buy this DVD from a scalper for a ridiculous price.

480766,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6305840113,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 5]","Sitting down to watch a suspense film with a title like ""Bedroom Window"" led my movie addled brain to start looking for connections to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" And they are there, from the crime witnessed through a window with limited information to the directing of Curtis Hanson that relies heavily on techniques that were used throughout ""Rear Window."" You know, shot of voyeur watching somebody suspicious, cut to suspicious guy doing something, cut back to voyeur for reaction shot. The Hitchcock references do not stop there however, rather the entire film is a cornucopia of homages. We have a psycho killer who lives at home with his faceless, controlling mother. Plus the main storyline is that of a man, a Wrong Man if you will, who falls under the hostile eye of the police for a crime he did not commit. So yes, you have seen it all before, but I happily gobbled it up all over again, and then realized that what I had just consumed was actually better than most of Hitchcock's oeuvre.The plot is one of those that motors along solely because nothing ever goes right. All of the twists are perfectly thought out and it makes for a delightfully messed up tale, but it all totally unrealistic because, come on, who is ever really that unlucky? Terry (Steve Guttenberg) is having an affair with his boss' blonde, accented wife when she spies an assault outside his apartment. The next day a different girl turns up dead a few blocks away but Sylvia (Isabelle Huppert) can't go to the police because that would expose their little tryst. So Terry, trying to be a hero, takes her place and reports the crime. Soon after he is convinced that he has found the real killer himself which leads to him chasing this man, Carl Henderson (Brad Greenquist), around town until his suspicions are verified. One thing leads to another and the next thing you know Carl is running free and Terry is the main suspect. Of course it is all his fault, trying to impress the lady and all that, but this film makes a strong case for not doing your civic duty.I really have almost all good things to say about this film. It is basically a movie about lying, and how the lies build upon themselves until your normal life is obliterated and you're wanted for murder. But we've all been in similar situations before which is what makes this film so powerful. The courtroom scene in which Wallace Shawn plays a defense attorney who dances rings around the mealy mouthed Terry has no more style than a typical ""Law and Order"" episode, but is just as engrossing. I was surprised to see Carl Lumbly show up as one of the lawyers because I was under the impression that his career began and ended with ""Alias."" Brad Greenquist does a superb job at being the frighteningly anguished suspected killer as he comes off as a Good Little Nazi with red hair. As a counterpoint to Spike Lee this film could have been called ""Don't Do the Right Thing"", as it may win you the approval of some girl and the police but ultimately it is a bad investment. Soon all parties involved think that they can dictate your next move to you only so that a few days later they can start to wonder if it was really you who did the killing. Hanson has done marvelous work since, but ""Bedroom Window"" sits near the top of his career. It has Hitchcock on the brain, but so do we, and Hanson knows how to tap into our darkest fears and serve up a pulpy thriller that gripped me from the first scene. ***3/4",4,A Forgotten Gem From Curtis Hanson,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,3457,"['Sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'suspense', 'film', 'title', 'Bedroom', 'Window', 'led', 'movie', 'addled', 'brain', 'start', 'looking', 'connections', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'are', 'there', 'crime', 'witnessed', 'window', 'limited', 'information', 'directing', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'heavily', 'techniques', 'were', 'used', 'Rear', 'Window', 'know', 'shot', 'voyeur', 'watching', 'somebody', 'suspicious', 'cut', 'suspicious', 'guy', 'doing', 'something', 'cut', 'back', 'voyeur', 'reaction', 'shot', 'Hitchcock', 'references', 'do', 'not', 'stop', 'there', 'however', 'rather', 'entire', 'film', 'cornucopia', 'homages', 'have', 'psycho', 'killer', 'who', 'home', 'faceless', 'controlling', 'mother', 'main', 'storyline', 'man', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'will', 'who', 'hostile', 'eye', 'police', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'So', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', 'happily', 'gobbled', 'up', 'over', 'again', 'then', 'realized', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'consumed', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'most', 'Hitchcock', 'oeuvre.The', 'plot', 'one', 'motors', 'along', 'solely', 'nothing', 'ever', 'right', 'twists', 'are', 'perfectly', 'thought', 'out', 'delightfully', 'messed', 'up', 'tale', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'come', 'who', 'ever', 'really', 'unlucky', 'Terry', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'blonde', 'accented', 'wife', 'when', 'assault', 'apartment', 'next', 'day', 'different', 'girl', 'up', 'dead', 'few', 'blocks', 'away', 'Sylvia', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'police', 'would', 'expose', 'little', 'tryst', 'So', 'Terry', 'trying', 'be', 'hero', 'place', 'crime', 'Soon', 'convinced', 'found', 'real', 'killer', 'chasing', 'man', 'Carl', 'Henderson', 'Brad', 'Greenquist', 'town', 'suspicions', 'are', 'verified', 'One', 'thing', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Carl', 'running', 'free', 'Terry', 'main', 'suspect', 'course', 'fault', 'trying', 'impress', 'lady', 'film', 'strong', 'case', 'not', 'doing', 'civic', 'duty.I', 'really', 'have', 'almost', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'basically', 'movie', 'lying', 'how', 'lies', 'build', 'normal', 'life', 'obliterated', ""'re"", 'wanted', 'murder', ""'ve"", 'been', 'similar', 'situations', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'powerful', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'rings', 'mealy', 'mouthed', 'Terry', 'more', 'style', 'typical', 'Law', 'Order', 'episode', 'just', 'engrossing', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'show', 'up', 'one', 'lawyers', 'was', 'impression', 'career', 'began', 'ended', 'Alias', 'Brad', 'Greenquist', 'superb', 'job', 'being', 'frighteningly', 'anguished', 'suspected', 'killer', 'off', 'Good', 'Little', 'Nazi', 'red', 'hair', 'counterpoint', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'may', 'win', 'approval', 'girl', 'police', 'ultimately', 'bad', 'investment', 'Soon', 'parties', 'involved', 'think', 'can', 'dictate', 'next', 'move', 'only', 'so', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'can', 'start', 'wonder', 'was', 'really', 'who', 'did', 'killing', 'Hanson', 'done', 'marvelous', 'work', 'Bedroom', 'Window', 'top', 'career', 'Hitchcock', 'brain', 'so', 'do', 'Hanson', 'how', 'tap', 'darkest', 'fears', 'serve', 'up', 'pulpy', 'thriller', 'gripped', 'first', 'scene', '***3/4']",N/A
480767,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6305840113,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","If you consider The Bedroom Window as among writer-director Curtis Hanson's training wheels, you might find it as interesting - and a little disappointing - as I do.The setup is clever and the potential for a harrowing ride includes violence, misdirection and one first-rate acting job by Isabelle Huppert. The downside is the last third of the movie and the bland, soft-sided performances by Steve Guttenberg and Elizabeth McGovern.Terry Lambert (Guttenberg) is a young man with a puppy-like personality. He's endearing, reasonably smart, and wants to do the right thing if it doesn't cost too much. Sylvia Wentworth (Huppert) is a beautiful, sophisticated woman who sees no particular reason why she can't have an eager lover, e.g. Terry, on the side as well as a wealthy husband. Terry can't believe his good luck. And Sylvia's husband is Terry's boss. Late one evening from Terry's bedroom window, Sylvia sees a young woman being assaulted by a murderous and odd-looking man. He runs off when he looks up and sees Sylvia. Terry decides he can use Sylvia's description of the man to give to the police when Sylvia says she cannot afford to be involved. Terry does...and finds himself far more involved with the police, with a trial and with a serial killer than he expected to be. The trial takes place and Sylvia attempts to coach Terry when the defense attorney (Wallace Shawn) springs a trap. The killer notices...and now he knows the real person who can identify him. He decides to go after Sylvia.  So far, so good.We'll skip a bit here. For the last act, Denise (McGovern) who was the victim of the assault, contacts Terry and convinces him they must catch the killer. Now the plot loses its cleverness and becomes much more routine. We have plain old Hollywood suspense, a chase, near misses and with the cavalry (the police) arriving in the nick of time. Will Terry and Denise, a wise but vulnerable barmaid, find happiness? It might happen.While Guttenberg gives a pleasant enough performance, there's not much there for us to identify with, except his good fortune with Huppert. He's just a nice guy. McGovern has limitations as an actress. Sometimes she's very good, as when she pursues Terry to get his help. Other times she's almost embarrassing, as when she's trying to play a floozy in order to interest the killer.Huppert, on the other hand, gives us an expert portrayal of a beautiful woman of the world, amused by life and amused by Terry, but pleasantly surprised by the comforts he brings to her bed. She doesn't love Terry. That would be far too middle-class for Sylvia. And as Terry finally understands, she has a core of realism about life. She's not about to jeopardize her life and station to help anyone. It's a marvelously subtle performance, given with a tone of voice, a glance, a frown.For the soon to be writer/director of L. A. Confidential, a near-perfect movie of corruption, underhanded humor, matter-of-fact brutality and clever plotting, I'm more than happy to give Hanson the benefit of the doubt with The Bedroom Window.",4,Isabelle Huppert is to die for.

Not enough to ruin the movie for you, in part because of Guttenberg's surprisingly well delivered dramatic role...no comedy this time. He really does a great job...he acts just like an average guy in this situation would. In other words, he is very believable in this role. The supporting cast  are not notable with the acception of Elizabeth McGovern. She delivers her role, and that's all. And, sorry, but trying to portray her as a sex pot is on the same scale as trying to portray Mother Theresa as a Hell's Angel's' biker mama. It ain't happenin. The flaws mentioned by other reviews seem harmless to the films entertainment value. But, there is one flaw that really glares...trying to squint blind sides you into almost losing the thread of the plot. It is this(if you have never seen this movie...close your eyes). Our serial killer gets the address of his victims by peeking at their open wallets lying on a table or bar top in a cocktail lounge. He leaves the bar, drives to their home, arriving ahead of them, where he then waits to spring an ambush. The movie opens with him attacking Elizabeth McGovern. The movie comes to it's dramatic close with him lying in wait for a DISGUISED Elizabeth McGovern, after sneaking a peek at her wallet while she absurdly slithers and teases the men in the bar wearing her disguise...impossible black leather skimpy out fit, blonde wig and all. What's wrong with this picture? Since it would be impossible to get a photo ID  showing her in her blonde wig and false eyelashes in time to bait the killer into attacking her disguised persona, and since the killer had attacked her before as her real self, wouldn't he have noticed she was the same women? If not her face, at least going to the same address should have caused him to smell a trap.. He sees the same photo ID, and the same address, and doesn't get. It. He pushes ahead with his plan to attack her blonde self. Maybe he was so engrossed in her jungle tempstress routine to be paying attention. Sure. That's it. That's the reason.

It actually begins in a very promising way-Terry Lambert (Steve Guttenberg) is having an affair with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert).  She witnesses an attack on a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) outside Terry's bedroom window, but he agrees to report it to the police as if he saw it so that their relationship will remain secret.  His story (and the film's) begins to fall apart until eventually he is on the run for crimes he didn't commit.With ""L.A.

480772,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,6305840113,Genevieve Hayes,"[0, 3]","The set-up sounds as though it was lifted straight from ""Rear Window"": while cheating on her husband, Sylvia (Isabelle Huppert) sees a woman being attacked from her lover, Terry's (Steve Guttenburg), bedroom window. However, after the first 10 - 15 minutes, ""The Bedroom Window"" diverges from the ""Rear Window"" formula and becomes its own story. Seeing that Sylvia doesn't want her husband to know that she is cheating on him but still wants to do the ""right thing"", Terry offers to report the attack to the police and pretend that he was the witness. As you would expect, things don't go to plan and soon the police suspect Terry of being the attacker and of killing several other women. It is now up to Terry to clear his name and to stop the real attacker from striking again.After a slow-moving first half-hour, which primarily consists of Steve Guttenberg driving around Washington D.C. and staring at people, ""The Bedroom Window"" actually shapes up to be a reasonably good film. I liked the fact that the film starts off as a ""Rear Window"" clone and then takes the story in a different direction (if I wanted to see ""Rear Window"" again, I'd watch that, or at the very least, ""Disturbia"") and the turns that the story does take are interesting, albeit somewhat predictable.Essentially this is a B-grade film that was probably released straight to video. However, it is directed by Curtis Hanson, who later went on to direct ""L.A. Confidential"", and who does a far better job at paying homage to Hitchcock than Brian DePalma did in his much over-rated ""Obsession"". Furthermore, although the high-point of his career was the ""Police Academy"" films (and with good reason, too), Steve Guttenberg is still pleasant to watch, and the second half of the film was exciting enough to make this film worth my time.",3,Above average homage to Hitchcock,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,1809,"['set-up', 'sounds', 'was', 'lifted', 'straight', 'Rear', 'Window', 'cheating', 'husband', 'Sylvia', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'woman', 'being', 'attacked', 'lover', 'Terry', 'Steve', 'Guttenburg', 'bedroom', 'window', 'However', 'first', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'Bedroom', 'Window', 'Rear', 'Window', 'formula', 'own', 'story', 'Seeing', 'Sylvia', ""n't"", 'want', 'husband', 'know', 'cheating', 'still', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Terry', 'report', 'attack', 'police', 'pretend', 'was', 'witness', 'would', 'expect', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'plan', 'soon', 'police', 'suspect', 'Terry', 'being', 'attacker', 'killing', 'several', 'other', 'women', 'now', 'up', 'Terry', 'clear', 'name', 'stop', 'real', 'attacker', 'striking', 'again.After', 'slow-moving', 'first', 'half-hour', 'primarily', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'driving', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'staring', 'people', 'Bedroom', 'Window', 'actually', 'up', 'be', 'reasonably', 'good', 'film', 'liked', 'fact', 'film', 'off', 'Rear', 'Window', 'clone', 'then', 'story', 'different', 'direction', 'wanted', 'see', 'Rear', 'Window', 'again', ""'d"", 'watch', 'very', 'least', 'Disturbia', 'turns', 'story', 'take', 'are', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'predictable.Essentially', 'B-grade', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'released', 'straight', 'video', 'However', 'directed', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'direct', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'who', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'paying', 'homage', 'Hitchcock', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'did', 'much', 'over-rated', 'Obsession', 'Furthermore', 'high-point', 'career', 'was', 'Police', 'Academy', 'films', 'good', 'reason', 'too', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'still', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'exciting', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'time']",N/A

Most people who wear contact lenses also have glasses by their nightstand. That was not even hinted at as that would blow a hole through the plot so big you wouldn't be able to watch the movie on your 13"" TV screen. And this must have been the era when the push for more gratuitous male nudity was on. I distinctly remember a lot of talk about that back in the 80s and 90s. Anyway women and men are naked often in this movie. All the main characters except the cuckold husband are naked at some point. The setting is amazingly Baltimore.

It may not be all their fault. Both were saddled with a pre-L.A. Confidential. Curtis Hanson. Up to this point, Hanson's previous directing credits included such immortals as ""The Arousers"" and ""Losin' It,"" He had no business at the helm of a Hitchcock rip-off. (Was Brian DePalma unavailable?) Curtis' copycat pacing was as wrong-headed as his care and feeding of the actors -- (an area in which he seemed to favor starvation.)Hanson's screenplay, however, isn't half bad. It's about a Baltimorean (Guttenberg) who pretends to witness a crime to conceal his affair with his boss's wife (Huppert), and then becomes a suspect in the case himself. Cherubic Elizabeth McGovern as the victim teams with Guttenberg to trap the real rapist, who gets off scot-free on one of those pesky technicalities. To bait the psycho killer, McGovern disguises herself as a floozy and slithers off to a working man's bar on the wrong side of Baltimore. She looks like a cross between a female impersonator and Alvin the Chipmunk as she wiggles on her bar stool. She makes an utter fool of herself. Where was Hanson, for instance, when she licked her forefinger and caressed the tip of the pool cue? Even Carl Lumbly as a detective -- the same Carl Lumbly who played a detective on ""Cagney & Lacey"" every week -- doesn't come off convincingly here.Of course, we have to suffer through more romance when McGovern recovers her libidinal urges in the company of the scintillating, hopelessly attractive, Nautilus-improved Guttenberg.

480783,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6305840113,trebe,"[0, 0]","Written and directed by Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential), The Bedroom Window (1987) is a nicely paced suspense thriller that has the feel of an 80's made for cable movie, as a man having an affair with his boss's wife, attempts to help the police, and then finds himself suspected of murder.  Although the plot seems somewhat predictable and goofy, the strong acting performances help to sell the story, and there are a couple of twists that keeps things interesting.Architect Terry Lambert (Steve Guttenberg) has become romantically involved with Sylvia Wentworth (Isabelle Huppert) the wife of his boss Colin Wentworth (Paul Shenar).  At 2am Sylvia is in Lambert's second floor apartment, when she sees a man attacking a woman on the street below.  The man is frightened away, but Sylvia gets a good look at him.  The following morning, the couple learn that another woman was found murdered nearby, but because the situation, Sylvia does not want to come forward.  Paul was in the bathroom and saw nothing, but he still phones the police, claiming to have seen the attack.  Based on what Sylvia has told him, he provides a description of the attacker to detectives Quirke (Carl Lumbly) and Jessup (Frederick Coffin).Lambert's lie has some unexpected results, as he is called into police headquarters to view suspects in a lineup, and meets Denise (Elizabeth McGovern), the woman attacked in front of his home.  Lambert doesn't identify anyone, but becomes suspicious of Carl Henderson (Brad Greenstreet), who was included in the lineup.  He follows Henderson to a bar, and when a woman in the bar later turns up dead, Lambert finds himself drawn in even deeper in a web of intrigue and suspicion that eventually turns on him.While much that happens is far-fetched, the smooth presentation and lively character interaction, helps to make events more plausible.  Terry Lambert isn't malicious, but is totally caught up in his lie.  Lambert's eventual partnership with Denise is entirely expected, but the depth and spunk of Elizabeth McGovern's character is a pleasant surprise, as Denise often takes the lead.  Guttenberg and McGovern are simply fun to watch together.  The versatile Guttenberg has a completely different type of relationship with Isabelle Huppert (The Piano Teacher), as Sylvia refuses to back up his story.  With the focus mostly on Terry and Denise, deranged killer Henderson, remains mostly in the background, and is a bit underdeveloped.  He isn't very subtle or sophisticated, but he is efficient and really lucky as well.With the rather mild Steve Guttenberg as the lead, and the killer on the periphery, the film doesn't have the violent edge or dark tone, of some thrillers.  Denise and Terry are engaging characters, who at times approach trapping a murderer like a game.  Curtis Hanson's film may lack a sense of seriousness, but is still very entertaining.  The conclusion while predictably dramatic, doesn't go completely over the top.With its romantic elements, and minimal violence, The Bedroom Window is perfect for Lifetime or other similar cable channel.  The acting performances are good, and the story has a certain familiarity and a few surprises.
