1352591,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B003L77GN8,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 1]","Having totally messed up his life in Shelby, ex-baseball pitcher Kenny Powers has fled to Mexico. Here he ekes out an existence raising fighting chickens, until he is recognised by the coach of the local struggling baseball team and drawn back into the game. At the same time, he is on a personal quest to track down the enigmatic 'Eduardo Sanchez' and to put his life back together, with the help of his old sidekick Stevie.For its second season, Eastbound and Down abandons most of the previously-established cast and setting and heads south of the border. Here it's business as usual, as Powers attempts to get himself back to fame and glory but constantly sabotages his prospects with his crass humour, narcissism and total lack of concern for other human beings.The first season of Eastbound was a success due to the premise and many of the individual gags and ideas being quite funny, with some genuinely solid character development taking place under the avalanche of fairly low-brow humour. The second season at first looks like it's going to continue this trend, with the show's embracing of a new setting (and culture) being a fairly brave move. It would have been easier to have stayed in Shelby and simply churned out six more episodes of the same. However, by a few episodes into this second season, it does feel like the move to Mexico was pointless. The show doesn't make much of its setting (beyond a few lazy gags, though nothing too offensive; HBO has a lot of Mexican viewers) and the structure of the second season is pretty much a retread of the first.Once again, Kenny is responsible for many of his own problems but, having apparently learned nothing from the events of the first season, enjoys much less of the viewer's sympathy this time around. Again, he is surrounded by friends and allies who want him to succeed, but his constant poor treatment of them and failure to make the most of the good opportunities that come his way makes you wonder why they bother. Crucially, the show is simply not as funny as the first season. Smile-inducing gags are rare, whilst genuine laugh-out loud moments are extremely few and far between.As before, Danny McBride is watchable and is able to make the viewer cringe in horror at his antics, but is less sympathetic this time around. Most of the cast, new and recurring alike, do good work with limited material, with Don Johnson being particularly amusing in his ability to dish out really terrible advice and make it sound plausible. Efren Ramirez is terribly under-used as Kenny's new neighbour, unfortunately, and oddly the double-act of Deep Roy and Joaquin Cosio, initially established as recurring enemies, disappear quite quickly despite their great comic potential.This latter issue probably best sums up Eastbound and Down's second season (**): a great deal of potential, but little of it fulfilled. If you were a huge fan of the first season, there's enough here to just about scrape by, but otherwise a disappointment. The show is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and the USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",3,Disappointing compared to the first season.,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3073,"['Having', 'totally', 'messed', 'up', 'life', 'Shelby', 'ex-baseball', 'pitcher', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'fled', 'Mexico', 'Here', 'out', 'existence', 'raising', 'fighting', 'chickens', 'recognised', 'coach', 'local', 'struggling', 'baseball', 'team', 'drawn', 'back', 'game', 'same', 'time', 'personal', 'quest', 'track', 'down', 'enigmatic', 'Sanchez', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'help', 'old', 'sidekick', 'Stevie.For', 'second', 'season', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'abandons', 'most', 'previously-established', 'cast', 'setting', 'heads', 'south', 'border', 'Here', 'business', 'usual', 'Powers', 'attempts', 'get', 'back', 'fame', 'glory', 'constantly', 'prospects', 'crass', 'humour', 'narcissism', 'total', 'lack', 'concern', 'other', 'human', 'beings.The', 'first', 'season', 'Eastbound', 'was', 'success', 'due', 'premise', 'many', 'individual', 'gags', 'ideas', 'being', 'quite', 'funny', 'genuinely', 'solid', 'character', 'development', 'taking', 'place', 'avalanche', 'fairly', 'low-brow', 'humour', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'looks', 'going', 'continue', 'trend', 'show', 'embracing', 'new', 'setting', 'culture', 'being', 'fairly', 'brave', 'move', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'have', 'stayed', 'Shelby', 'simply', 'churned', 'out', 'six', 'more', 'episodes', 'same', 'However', 'few', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'feel', 'move', 'Mexico', 'was', 'pointless', 'show', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'setting', 'few', 'lazy', 'gags', 'nothing', 'too', 'offensive', 'HBO', 'lot', 'Mexican', 'viewers', 'structure', 'second', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'retread', 'first.Once', 'again', 'Kenny', 'responsible', 'many', 'own', 'problems', 'having', 'apparently', 'learned', 'nothing', 'events', 'first', 'season', 'much', 'less', 'viewer', 'sympathy', 'time', 'around', 'Again', 'surrounded', 'friends', 'allies', 'who', 'want', 'succeed', 'constant', 'poor', 'treatment', 'failure', 'make', 'most', 'good', 'opportunities', 'come', 'way', 'wonder', 'why', 'bother', 'Crucially', 'show', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'season', 'Smile-inducing', 'gags', 'are', 'rare', 'whilst', 'genuine', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'moments', 'are', 'extremely', 'few', 'far', 'between.As', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'watchable', 'able', 'make', 'viewer', 'cringe', 'horror', 'antics', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'time', 'around', 'Most', 'cast', 'new', 'recurring', 'alike', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'limited', 'material', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'being', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'ability', 'dish', 'out', 'really', 'terrible', 'advice', 'make', 'sound', 'plausible', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'terribly', 'under-used', 'Kenny', 'new', 'neighbour', 'unfortunately', 'oddly', 'double-act', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'Joaquin', 'Cosio', 'initially', 'established', 'recurring', 'enemies', 'disappear', 'quite', 'quickly', 'great', 'comic', 'potential.This', 'latter', 'issue', 'probably', 'best', 'sums', 'up', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'second', 'season', '**', 'great', 'deal', 'potential', 'little', 'fulfilled', 'were', 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'season', 'enough', 'here', 'just', 'scrape', 'otherwise', 'disappointment', 'show', 'available', 'now', 'UK', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A

1352598,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B003L77GN8,G. Denick,"[2, 2]","Belligerent, brash, and completely unhinged- this is Kenny Powers at his finest. If you're not familiar with the show, be warned: This program is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. If you are not familiar with Danny McBride's perpetual typecasting (I wonder if he's even acting at this point in his career, or just being himself?), watch this show at your own mortal peril. As an FYI, the Blu-ray video quality is superb (and the packaging is hilarious).Amazingly, the second season of Eastbound and Down manages to maintain the standard of hilarity that the first one established, and even SURPASSES it. This is particularly impressive, considering that this season could not rely upon the crowd-pleasing presence of Will Ferrell, prancing about his BMW dealership in a white wig.One must be careful, however- if you watch too much of this show in one sitting, Kenny Powers' attitude WILL rub off on you! And you absolutely cannot show up to the office spouting off whatever's on your mind, a la Kenny Powers. This outrageous character has absolutely no filter, and no comprehension of what socially acceptable behavior is. And that's a big part of what makes Eastbound and Down so ridiculously funny. Danny McBride was quite possibly born to play this role. And every time you begin to think this guy couldn't be any more of a self-centered low life, he starts to redeem himself, and show that he just might be human after all. His tough exterior, brash behavior, and dismissal of anyone who doesn't happen to be named ""Kenny Powers"" is really nothing more than an elaborate, psychological self-defense mechanism- but that doesn't make it any less funny and delightful.From fleeing to Mexico to ""rekindling"" his career in a really, really bad baseball league, this is Kenny Powers at his best and worst. He befriends little people and giants alike, and then makes mortal enemies of them. He finds his estranged father, and then loses him again. He shoots Stevie in the leg with a pistol, and convinces Stevie that it was probably his own damn fault. This is an epic, hilarious, soul-searching journey embarked upon by Kenny Powers in a foreign land.

The eagerly awaited second season consists of seven episodes and, like the first season, can be viewed in one sitting, which makes a season more like a thematic sequel than an actual show. In the last episode of the first season, Kenny Powers left behind the girl he loved, April (Katy Mixon) and his hometown of North Carolina for greener pastures...This is why season 2, picking up right where season 1 left off, finds Kenny in Mexico.Kenny, sporting cornrows, is in Mexico and using the alias Steve. This is more out of necessity than want, as he's been living off of the credit cards of poor Stevie Janowski (Steve Little). Kenny enjoys his life in Mexico, making money as a cockfighter with a new sidekick Aaron (Deep Roy) and becoming friends with his neighbor Catuey (Efren Ramirez). Still struggling to get over April, Kenny finds a new love interest in the form of Vida (Ana de la Reguera). The setting is different, but it's still the same Kenny Powers. Depressed as ever, Kenny sees his chance for a comeback by playing for the Mexican baseball team the Charros, owned by the very rich Sebastian Cisneros (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and coached by the nurturing Roger Hernandez (Marco Rodr&iacute;guez). As Kenny begins to settle into his existence in Mexico, Stevie appears at his doorstep and reminds Kenny off all that he left behind.The seven episodes are spread across two discs (with Ch. 7-10 on disc 1 and Ch. 11-13 on disc 2) and feature Jody Hill and David Gordon Green sharing directorial duties. Both directors know McBride and the material well and don't stray from the tone established by the other when handling their directorial duties. Despite its Mexico setting, season 2 was filmed in Puerto Rico and the locale is frequently beautiful, as well as being a good substitute for Mexico. Kenny Powers is as strong a protagonist as ever and McBride relishes in this character, once again turning his colorful use of profanity into an art form. The new additions to the cast are good too, particularly Deep Roy (who once played the Oompa-Loompas in Tim Burton's Charlie & the Chocolate Factory) who is surprisingly funny and vulgar while  Rodriguez brings a distinct warmth to his role as the Coach.All the episodes are written by Shawn D. Harwell, Jody Hill, and Danny McBride and it's been said that season two is substantially weaker than season one in the writing department. It's true that the writing is not as strong, but it doesn't seem like an issue of the writer's running out of ideas. In fact, credit must be given to them for not allowing Powers to be a one-dimensional character, which he could be very easily. There's still a knack for un-p.c. humor written around well-placed emotional material. The jokes take aim at anything possible, including a well-placed rant against 3D and while some jokes are not as funny as season one, the writing remains effective. The final scenes are pretty predictable, but still feel rather poignant. Some have said the tone has grown darker as well and it has, but perhaps only a notch above the first season. Any misgivings about this season aside, Eastbound & Down remains one of the best comedies on TV.There are two surprise celebrity appearances, which are quite amusing. For those reading here, they'll remain a surprise. Eastbound & Down has been renewed for a third season, which McBride has said will be the final run for Kenny Powers. It's sad that such a brilliant show will end after such a short time, but it's best to end it on a high-note. This second season may not be as effective and creative as the first season, but most viewers will be happy enough with it to simply want HBO to bring on season three. It's the same Kenny Powers, the same mean-spirited humor, and the same raunchy material that made audiences embrace this character in the first place. Season two falls short of being brilliant, but it's a worthy companion to a great show.GRADE: B+",4,A Worthy Second Season to a Great Show,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,4194,"['first', 'season', 'premiered', '2009', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'main', 'character', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'wonderfully', 'vulgar', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'have', 'developed', 'more', 'just', 'cult', 'following', 'HBO', 'series', 'widely', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'cable', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'second', 'season', 'seven', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'sitting', 'season', 'more', 'thematic', 'sequel', 'actual', 'show', 'last', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'left', 'behind', 'girl', 'loved', 'April', 'Katy', 'Mixon', 'hometown', 'North', 'Carolina', 'greener', 'pastures', 'why', 'season', '2', 'picking', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'season', '1', 'left', 'off', 'Kenny', 'Mexico.Kenny', 'sporting', 'cornrows', 'Mexico', 'using', 'alias', 'Steve', 'more', 'necessity', 'want', 'been', 'living', 'credit', 'cards', 'poor', 'Stevie', 'Janowski', 'Steve', 'Little', 'Kenny', 'life', 'Mexico', 'making', 'money', 'cockfighter', 'new', 'sidekick', 'Aaron', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'becoming', 'friends', 'neighbor', 'Catuey', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'Still', 'struggling', 'get', 'April', 'Kenny', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'Vida', 'Ana', 'de', 'la', 'Reguera', 'setting', 'different', 'still', 'same', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'Depressed', 'ever', 'Kenny', 'chance', 'comeback', 'playing', 'Mexican', 'baseball', 'team', 'Charros', 'owned', 'very', 'rich', 'Sebastian', 'Cisneros', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'coached', 'nurturing', 'Roger', 'Hernandez', 'Marco', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'Kenny', 'settle', 'existence', 'Mexico', 'Stevie', 'doorstep', 'Kenny', 'left', 'behind.The', 'seven', 'episodes', 'are', 'spread', 'two', 'discs', 'Ch', '7-10', 'disc', '1', 'Ch', '11-13', 'disc', '2', 'feature', 'Jody', 'Hill', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'sharing', 'directorial', 'duties', 'directors', 'know', 'McBride', 'material', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'stray', 'tone', 'established', 'other', 'when', 'handling', 'directorial', 'duties', 'Mexico', 'setting', 'season', '2', 'was', 'filmed', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'locale', 'frequently', 'beautiful', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'good', 'substitute', 'Mexico', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'strong', 'protagonist', 'ever', 'McBride', 'character', 'once', 'again', 'turning', 'colorful', 'use', 'profanity', 'art', 'form', 'new', 'additions', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'particularly', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'who', 'once', 'played', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'vulgar', 'Rodriguez', 'distinct', 'warmth', 'role', 'Coach.All', 'episodes', 'are', 'written', 'Shawn', 'D.', 'Harwell', 'Jody', 'Hill', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'been', 'said', 'season', 'two', 'substantially', 'weaker', 'season', 'one', 'writing', 'department', 'true', 'writing', 'not', 'strong', ""n't"", 'seem', 'issue', 'writer', 'running', 'out', 'ideas', 'fact', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'not', 'allowing', 'Powers', 'be', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'easily', 'still', 'knack', 'un-p.c', 'humor', 'written', 'well-placed', 'emotional', 'material', 'jokes', 'take', 'aim', 'anything', 'possible', 'including', 'well-placed', 'rant', '3D', 'jokes', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'season', 'one', 'writing', 'effective', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'still', 'feel', 'rather', 'poignant', 'have', 'said', 'tone', 'grown', 'darker', 'well', 'perhaps', 'only', 'notch', 'first', 'season', 'misgivings', 'season', 'aside', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'TV.There', 'are', 'two', 'surprise', 'celebrity', 'appearances', 'are', 'quite', 'amusing', 'reading', 'here', ""'ll"", 'remain', 'surprise', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'been', 'renewed', 'third', 'season', 'McBride', 'said', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'run', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'sad', 'brilliant', 'show', 'will', 'end', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'best', 'end', 'high-note', 'second', 'season', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'effective', 'creative', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'enough', 'simply', 'want', 'HBO', 'bring', 'season', 'three', 'same', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'same', 'mean-spirited', 'humor', 'same', 'raunchy', 'material', 'made', 'audiences', 'embrace', 'character', 'first', 'place', 'Season', 'two', 'short', 'being', 'brilliant', 'worthy', 'companion', 'great', 'show.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

Henning,"[0, 0]","Season 2 of ""Eastbound & Down"" finds Kenny Powers (Danny McBride) south of the boarder running his own posse, and involved in some petty crime.Powers is tracked down by his faithful sidekick, former school band teacher, Stevie Janowski (Steve Little). Stevie joins the adventure and wanders deeper into the Kenny Powers Domain of crazy living, and the two have their own local romances.Baseball isn't a priority for Powers and it is only when he is seen at a local game, as a drunken spectator, that he catches the attention of the team manager. Powers always the centre of his own universe quickly becomes an over the top spectacle when he joins the team. Yet it is his sheer decadence, on and off the field, which humours and entertains the viewer.Powers also tracks down his father in Mexico and his expectations and experiences with his dad help the viewer to understand some of the complexities of Kenny.An opportunity to return to professional baseball in the U.S. is offered to Powers, based on his form in the Mexican League, and suddenly there is a pathway back to the big leagues for him.Back home in Shelby North Carolina much has changed as April Buchanon (Katy Mixon) has left school teaching, and her personal circumstances are designed to cause the viewer stun.Season 2 certainly presents the viewer with a whole new Kenny Powers story!Nicholas R.W.
