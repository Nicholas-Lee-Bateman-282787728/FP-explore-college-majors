1650404,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B00CS5RBPM,Adam,"[1, 2]","There's a lot to say for, &#34;Home Run&#34; particularly the powerful message of God's healing and forgiveness, as the film deals with the issue of alcoholism in an honest way and highlights the work of the ministry Celebrate Recovery. Some of the baseball scenes ae decently handled and star Scott Elrod turns in a solid performanceThat said, the film does have problems. At nearly two hours, the film at least half an hour too long with padding and a plot that seemed to ramble. The baseball parts often didn't make sense as the movie's understanding of how things like all-star team voting, suspensions (and appeals), as well as releasing a player didn't seem to work. Indeed these elements were used to force the plot along. At the same time, it felt like other things were happening that we weren't seeing on screen that may have made the story make more sense. This is backed up by the fact that the movie novelization is more than 400 pages long. The producers didn't do a job of narrowing this down to a good cinematic story.The film had a good message, but if it doesn't use its medium well that makes it harder for the message to get out.",3,A Movie That Doesn't Reach The Fences,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,1149,"['lot', 'say', '34', 'Home', 'Run', '34', 'particularly', 'powerful', 'message', 'God', 'healing', 'forgiveness', 'film', 'deals', 'issue', 'alcoholism', 'honest', 'way', 'highlights', 'work', 'ministry', 'Celebrate', 'Recovery', 'baseball', 'ae', 'decently', 'handled', 'star', 'Scott', 'Elrod', 'solid', 'performanceThat', 'said', 'film', 'have', 'problems', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'least', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'padding', 'plot', 'seemed', 'ramble', 'baseball', 'parts', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'understanding', 'how', 'things', 'all-star', 'team', 'voting', 'suspensions', 'appeals', 'as', 'well', 'releasing', 'player', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'Indeed', 'elements', 'were', 'used', 'force', 'plot', 'same', 'time', 'felt', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'were', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'screen', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'story', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'backed', 'up', 'fact', 'movie', 'novelization', 'more', '400', 'pages', 'long', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'narrowing', 'down', 'good', 'cinematic', 'story.The', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'message', ""n't"", 'use', 'medium', 'well', 'harder', 'message', 'get', 'out']",N/A

The cast of characters were believable and likable.  Anyone who has battled a stronghold in their life would probably tell you that they couldn't do it on their own.  This was the baseline for the story.  Cory, the main character, realizing that he couldn't stop drinking was the beginning of his recovery.  God gave him the strength to do what he couldn't do on his own, but I loved at the end how when he drives by the bar he slows his truck and you see him shake his head.  He still battles the temptation to do it.  It didn't completely go away, but God gives him the strength to keep on going and not turn into that old temptation.

Good acting  by the leads, better than average production values and a compelling story just a bit bogged down by predictability.  Most stories like this are told because they are success stories.

Part of the story is very contrived.  Famous ex boyfriend comes back to small town...problems arise, flirting and resistance from the ex girlfriend.3.  The reaction from the son seemed fake and forced.4. Things didn't seem to resolve between the brothers.Things I did like:1.  I thought for sure this was going to be about re-kindling an old romance/instantly re-igniting a family once forgotten...It was nice it didn't SEEM like they just started right where they left out and he had an insta-family.2.

He took those feelings of abandonment and disappointment into his adult life which led him to make choices which were not the best for him or his career.Meeting the right people while coaching a little league baseball team in his home town helped him to learn to forgive, trust in God, and acknowledge his abuse of alcohol. He was able to then move on in his life which brought him love, acceptance, redemption, and hope.It is a family movie but I am not sure young children will understand the major theme. I think watching it with older children, middle school and high school children could lead to a family discussion about the theme of the movie and the choices we make and consequences they have in our lives.I feel it is a movie worth watching.

Reed,"[0, 0]","I think it's fair to acknowledge up front that this is a Christian movie and that if you're someone who's ardently anti-Christian you probably won't like this movie. And parents should be warned that there is at times some fairly frank discussion of sexual addiction and some intense anger/violence (not graphic violence, but the intensity of the actors could make it scary for young kids).The movie does have a great message about the healing power of God's love and the way it can fulfill you where earthly pleasures cannot, and that this is the major problem with the emptiness that so many would say they feel in their lives. The plot is mostly about abuse and addiction and why it occurs (addiction not just to alcohol and drugs). Most of the movie is spent with the main character unwilling to admit that he has a problem with alcohol but it does portray a number of other individuals (through the context of his 12-step program) who have recognized they have a problem and that becoming a born-again Christian has been a major step in their recovery. Is the movie a bit simplistic in seeming to imply that this single step alone is sufficient and that these individuals won't fall back on their old ways? Sure, although there is a hint at the very end that Cory will struggle from time to time (when he comes back  to Okmulgee at the very end, he drives very slowly past the bar).The plot is well done and the actors did a great job of portraying the characters. Much like &#34;Courageous&#34;, there are few flaws in the script or plot, a rarity in indie-developed Christian movies. Scott Elrod portrays Cory as a likable person but with serious issues. He does a terrific job with Cory's addiction, the roots of his issues, his anger, and eventual transformation. When he finally breaks and admits he has a problem, you really feel it. If I had to pick one issue, it is that the movie speeds too quickly past his transformation and acceptance of Christ after his admission of his addiction where it might have spent some time on it.Too bad Hollywood can't do more movies like this.",5,"Great movie, well worth viewing",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2090,"['think', 'fair', 'acknowledge', 'up', 'front', 'Christian', 'movie', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'ardently', 'anti-Christian', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'times', 'fairly', 'frank', 'discussion', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'intense', 'anger/violence', 'not', 'graphic', 'violence', 'intensity', 'actors', 'could', 'make', 'scary', 'young', 'kids', '.The', 'movie', 'have', 'great', 'message', 'healing', 'power', 'God', 'love', 'way', 'can', 'fulfill', 'where', 'earthly', 'pleasures', 'can', 'not', 'major', 'problem', 'emptiness', 'so', 'many', 'would', 'say', 'feel', 'lives', 'plot', 'mostly', 'abuse', 'addiction', 'why', 'addiction', 'not', 'just', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'Most', 'movie', 'spent', 'main', 'character', 'unwilling', 'admit', 'problem', 'alcohol', 'portray', 'number', 'other', 'individuals', 'context', '12-step', 'program', 'who', 'have', 'recognized', 'have', 'problem', 'becoming', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'been', 'major', 'step', 'recovery', 'movie', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'seeming', 'imply', 'single', 'step', 'alone', 'sufficient', 'individuals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fall', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'Sure', 'hint', 'very', 'end', 'Cory', 'will', 'struggle', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'back', 'Okmulgee', 'very', 'end', 'very', 'slowly', 'bar', '.The', 'plot', 'well', 'done', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'Much', '34', 'Courageous', '34', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'script', 'plot', 'rarity', 'indie-developed', 'Christian', 'movies', 'Scott', 'Elrod', 'Cory', 'likable', 'person', 'serious', 'issues', 'terrific', 'job', 'Cory', 'addiction', 'roots', 'issues', 'anger', 'eventual', 'transformation', 'When', 'finally', 'problem', 'really', 'feel', 'had', 'pick', 'one', 'issue', 'movie', 'speeds', 'too', 'quickly', 'transformation', 'acceptance', 'Christ', 'admission', 'addiction', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'it.Too', 'bad', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'movies']",N/A

It presents the consequences of allowing such a course to take control of a person's life and those that are close to them.  Additionally, it presents a twelve-step recovery program, &#34;Celebrate Recovery&#34;, which is Christian based; along with testimonials of people who went through diverse life challenges and how God changed their life.  Although their lives are not perfect now, their lives are better-off because of God in their life.Although the main character of the film does present his testimony at the end of the film, the film does not present his conversion experience (e.g. sinner's prayer, or praying with the CR leader on the scene where he confessed to the leader that he could not stop drinking and stop the cycle).  As time passes by, more faith-based films are doing this, and to me, this is falling short of scripture:... &#34;if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&#34; (Rom. 10:9-10).If it were not for this, I would give the film five stars.
