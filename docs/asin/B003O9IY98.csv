Simeone,"[12, 16]","Why is it that every great family oriented movie that is released, with a clean story, potentially great for the kids, winds up with someone who dies in the movie?  I reviewed this movie for a possible family night gathering, where my brothers, mother, and 2 young nieces would be watching this for an evening of family entertainment.  The movie had scenery that was out of this world!  The acting was great!  The story was slow, very slow, but clean, and a welcome change of pace.  I thought for sure, hands down, this movie was a winner, until the mother dies!  The boy ends up screaming his guts out in tears, they have the funneral where they carry her away in a coffin, and so on.  There is no way that I would show this movie to 2 young girls, and explain to them that this is an evening of joyful family entertainment.  The movie is great, the scenery, breath-taking, story is slow, but clean.  It even rebounds after the death of his mother, with a great ending.  I would give this 6 out of 5 stars, if it wasnt for the death in the middle, which knocked the wind out of the entire movie. It's a real shame.  The movie had so much potential!  The death scene and funeral really took the movie on a 90 degree turn down a different path.  Amazing!  I had to settle for 3 stars because of this.They say hind-sight is 20/20.  Well, in my opinion, what would have made this movie a 5 star movie:  The author of the book, or the people who did the screen write for the movie should have had the mother come down with a serious illness that needed an operation.  It might even seem that only a miracle could save her.  Send her off to a hospital on the mainland, leaving the boy with the husband, leaving them bond together into a stronger relationship.  Then the boy visits his mother, and his passion for her inspires her to want to recover.  The operation she undergoes saves her, and she returns back to their island home, united, together, as one family.There is so much death in this world.  When I bring my family together, especially 2 young girls, for a night of family oriented entertainment, the last thing I want to see on the big screen is more death and tragedy!  Why?  Again, this movie had all the makings of a beautiful family movie; one for all to see and get absorbed into.  The movie changed after the death scene; changed in mood, changed in atmosphere, everything changed.  Toward the end, it was like watching a different movie.",3,"Great Movie Potential, but great disappointment",1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,2452,"['Why', 'great', 'family', 'oriented', 'movie', 'released', 'clean', 'story', 'potentially', 'great', 'kids', 'up', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'possible', 'family', 'night', 'gathering', 'where', 'brothers', 'mother', '2', 'young', 'nieces', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'evening', 'family', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'had', 'scenery', 'was', 'world', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'slow', 'very', 'slow', 'clean', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'thought', 'sure', 'down', 'movie', 'was', 'winner', 'mother', 'boy', 'up', 'screaming', 'guts', 'out', 'tears', 'have', 'funneral', 'where', 'carry', 'away', 'coffin', 'so', 'way', 'would', 'show', 'movie', '2', 'young', 'girls', 'explain', 'evening', 'joyful', 'family', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'great', 'scenery', 'breath-taking', 'story', 'slow', 'clean', 'even', 'death', 'mother', 'great', 'ending', 'would', 'give', '6', '5', 'stars', 'death', 'middle', 'knocked', 'wind', 'entire', 'movie', 'real', 'shame', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'death', 'scene', 'funeral', 'really', 'took', 'movie', '90', 'degree', 'turn', 'down', 'different', 'path', 'Amazing', 'had', 'settle', '3', 'stars', 'this.They', 'say', 'hind-sight', '20/20', 'Well', 'opinion', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'author', 'book', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'screen', 'write', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'mother', 'come', 'down', 'serious', 'illness', 'needed', 'operation', 'might', 'even', 'seem', 'only', 'miracle', 'could', 'save', 'Send', 'off', 'hospital', 'mainland', 'leaving', 'boy', 'husband', 'leaving', 'bond', 'together', 'stronger', 'relationship', 'Then', 'boy', 'mother', 'passion', 'inspires', 'want', 'recover', 'operation', 'back', 'island', 'home', 'united', 'together', 'one', 'family.There', 'so', 'much', 'death', 'world', 'When', 'bring', 'family', 'together', 'especially', '2', 'young', 'girls', 'night', 'family', 'oriented', 'entertainment', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'more', 'death', 'tragedy', 'Why', 'Again', 'movie', 'had', 'makings', 'beautiful', 'family', 'movie', 'one', 'see', 'get', 'absorbed', 'movie', 'changed', 'death', 'scene', 'changed', 'mood', 'changed', 'atmosphere', 'everything', 'changed', 'end', 'was', 'watching', 'different', 'movie']",A Shine of Rainbows [Region 4]

In today's media, we expect too much! We assume movies have to be loaded with heavy information, sarcasm, irony, difficult scenery and so on. But in reality, good stories that touched a man's heart throughout centuries, have been those with simple messages!This particular movie touched my heart with its simplicity more than any other heavy loaded movie could ever do! It really just kind of went into my cold heart and turned everything upside down with the innocence and purity of a childlike perspective!This movie is the first ever that made me cry through the entire half! Those were tears of a breakthrough for me. Mostly because I could resonate with the main character, the orphaned boy. While I am not an orphaned myself, I have been too attached to my mother. In the movie the boy falls in purest love with his new mom, a very kind-hearted woman who adopts him. And just like the boy, I never had a good relationship with my father. Basically, the story is that of letting go of attachment with one person, and healing a relationship with another. This concept nailed it on the head for me! I could have never even imagined that I could actually be closer to my father than I thought!Watch this movie to understand what I mean by all this. I would not want to spoil too much. If you watch the movie, and it does not speak to you in a any way, please don't write harsh reviews on how there are cliches or unrealistic situations, because miracles DO happen and life brings amazing surprises to those who are opened to it!Because of this film, I decided to post-pone my graduation until next fall. Instead, I am going to spend my Spring semester with my father back in the state where he and my mom live. I used to blame him for many things, thinking it was always his fault that we were never too close. But now I see that he may have actually been there for me more than I realize. No matter how the situation will unravel, I will be opened to the relationship aspect with him and to get the most out of it as possible!I would encourage anyone who've had a difficult relationship with their father, or were orphaned at some point in their life, or even parents who have difficulties connecting to their children, to watch this movie with an opened mind!

1356153,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B003O9IY98,David Bower,"[3, 3]","This is a foreign film in the very best sense of the word; it approaches life and living in a way outside of the typical mold of domestic productions. This made the movie very intriguing for us and quickly captured our imaginations with its fresh newness.A Shine of Rainbows is a fascinating film in many ways; first of all it is a tender love story of a woman's love for her adopted son and his growing love for her as the mother he needed and wanted so badly. Secondly the setting on the rugged Irish coast establishes a harsh environment in which this love must grow; one can feel the bite of the wind and taste the saltiness in the air.It makes the viewer feel as if they had personally experienced the location and could imagine how the orphan, Tomas, played by John Bell, felt when first taken to this remote place.The acting is uniformly high caliber and always contributes to the progress of the story. My wife and I were both greatly impressed by Bell's acting and quickly identified with him and sympathized with his plight.The role of the mother, Marie, is beautifully played by Connie Nielsen; her gentle portrayal of the mother reminds one of a beautiful, delicate flower growing amidst the rocks of that harsh Irish coast. The role of the father, Alec, is effectively played by Aidan Quinn.This is a moving story which both of us enjoyed. It can have an impact on the viewer which will last; I know it did for us. It introduced us to an area and a way of life that is totally different from anything either of us have ever known; that alone made it a worthy way to spend the evening.

I really enjoyed ""The Blind Side"", I was annoyed by ""Flipped"" so that's where I'm coming from reviewing THIS film which takes place in Ireland, has rainbows, an orphan, and a baby seal. It is written and directed by Vic Sarin and stars Connie Nielsen, Aidan Quinn, and John Bell.First, I recommend putting up the subtitles so you don't miss anything because even though they are speaking English, they are using very strong accents and refer to one of the main characters as ""himself"" in odd situations we normally wouldn't use it in. John Bell plays Tom&aacute;s, an orphan boy picked on in school for helping an imprisoned pigeon. Maire played by Connie Nielsen arrives to adopt him like a colorful angel and whisks him away from the city to the island of Corrie where there are sheep, seals, caves to play in, and giant stones that have legends. The only person not keen on this arrangement is Maire's husband, Alec (often referred to as ""himself""). Alec does not warm up to Tom&aacute;s whom he considers a weakling since the kid is shy and stammers.Conflicts occur, an animatronic baby seal needs to be fed, Tom&aacute;s needs to come out of his shell, his mother gets sick, rainbows fall out of the sky and are sparkly, and once again, did I mention there was a cute baby seal? It is clearly a family film and based on a book. You can watch this with your kids and all enjoy it, but there is one scene where the kid is basked in the glow of a sparkly rainbow that made me groan (went a little too far, folks). I didn't even mind the fake baby seal, it was still cute. The story is filled with clich&eacute;s, but they seem to be overlooked in light of the fact that the story takes place in the sixties in Ireland, a fantastical land where anything can happen. John Bell is an obvious newcomer to film, he can pore on the hysterics in an emotional scene, but in regular everyday scenes comes off as REALLY stiff and the stammering is unnatural. He has potential though so he just needs to keep at it.If you need to rent a family movie one night and your kids like seals, try this one. Otherwise I don't really recommend it, it's ok to good, not great.Bonus Features:A making-of featurette that lasts over forty minutes long and shows audition footage of the kids and behind-the-scenes with making of the animatronic seal, the giant rocks, the difficulties with weather, and budget meetings.

At first I thought it was going to be the cliche-ridden Christian film about a mother who loves her son, a father who isn't quite comfortable around him, and how the two men find love.While I wouldn't call this a blatant Christian film, I was correct on the other points.A Shine of Rainbows is about how Maire (Connie Nielsen) wants to adopt a boy. Her husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn) sends her off to make the choice. At the orphanage, Maire finds and selects Tomas (John Bell) a boy who is tenderhearted and nervous around men.The home life is a challenge as Maire does everything she can to make Tomas feel welcomed and loved while Alec is unsure of having such a ""weak"" boy.In time, Tomas makes friends and they go off on adventures. He makes friends with an orphaned seal and they created a special bond.The actors are fine in their roles. It's good to see Aidan Quinn out of the woodwork, and the locations were fantastic (the isles of Ireland).Then the cliches come in full force and I don't want to spoil for you.

It is so visually appealing and real I could smell the salt air and the scratchiness of their sweaters.The acting by Aidan Quinn, Connie Nielsen and John Bell (Tomas) was stellar. The only one I am familiar with is Aidan and thought his silent, strong, loving, desperate, character, Alec was brilliantly played.Connie Nielsen's Marie was amazing. She is beautiful, mesmerizing and full of heart. She is everything you would wish for if you were a child like Tomas in need of love.  I was unaware of the many films I have seen with her. Her impact from this movie will make me remember her forever.John Bell's Tomas was unbelievable. My heart ached for him. He is like Oliver Twist, full of heartbreak, tears, fears and completely capable of love even after being in an orphanage and teased. He is a gentle soul who Marie falls completely in love with.There is so much to say about this movie but I don't want to give anything away. While I saw where the movie was headed 20 minutes in, it is the journey to the end that makes this a must see.My throat ached from sobbing through much of the movie. Not because the storyline is heartbreaking but because the acting was so strong, you felt all the emotions of the characters even when it had nothing to do with the lines of a script.There is so much to love about this movie. The love of Marie and Alec! The love of Marie and Tomas. The way Marie sees the world and how she shares herself with others. The magic of a mother's love even when you are not biologically bound to them.

It starts out with Tomas, a little red haired orphan, dealing with the typical trials of being the outcast because he's not perfect. Tomas has a stutter and he was sure no one would ever want to adopt him.  But along comes Maire O'Donnell (Connie Nielson), a free spirited Irish woman who takes Tomas into her home and her heart. Because of illness, she has been unable to have children of her own, but she opens her heart up to the orphaned boy and the two of them build a bond that has nothing to do with blood.For Maire's husband Alec (Aiden Quinn), acceptance isn't quite so easy. He distracts himself from his new son and delays signing the adoption papers. Tomas is afraid he will never bond with Alec, but in the meantime he is busy discovering all the wonders of the small island in Ireland. He makes new friends, helps to save a baby seal that is stranded on the shore, and learns about the magic of rainbows. Things are looking up for Tomas for the first time in his life. But then tragedy strikes and Tomas finds himself alone once again. His only hope at happiness is to convince a grieving Alec that he needs him more than he thinks.""A Shine of Rainbows"" is one of those movies that requires a box of tissues to be on hand at all times. Its a movie that will touch your soul on so many levels--a beautiful story about the power of love and family.Directed by Emmy-nominated director Vic Sarin, the whole family will enjoy this touching story about acceptance and self-discovery.

1356175,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B003O9IY98,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[8, 8]","Set on Corrie Island, Ireland in the early 1960's, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS is the story about an orphan boy named Tomas who is adopted by a woman named Maire (Connie Nielsen) and her husband Alec (Aidan Quinn). Tomas (John Bell) has always been a bit of an outcast. He sees the beauty in what others consider mundane, but also has difficulty speaking.  He is vilified by the other boys because he is not normal. Maire and Alec are unable to have a child of their own and Maire selects Tomas to be her son. Life on Corrie is much different than at the orphanage on the mainland, but Tomas adapts to it well. He has people who love him, he is surrounded by beauty and nature, and he begins to overcome his speaking problem. Maire adores Tomas and he loves her and shortly after arriving begins calling her Mum. Alec likes the boy and shows little moments of affection, but he can't quite bring himself to call Tomas his son (most clearly evidenced by his refusal to sign Tomas's adoption papers). A tragedy occurs and Tomas new life rushes toward oblivion.I had never heard of A SHINE OF RAINBOWS until about a year ago when I saw a trailer for it on the DVD of I AM. The trailer really intrigued me.The acting in the movie is amazing. Aidan Quinn plays a role different from many he has played in the past. Connie Nielsen is superb as Maire and gives an Oscar-worthy performance. However, it is the young John Bell as Tomas who is the standout star of the film. If this was a major movie marketed in America, Bell would have won all sorts of awards and accolades. Just as A SHINE OF RAINBOWS revolves around Tomas, the other actors in the film seem to take their cue from Bell and all of them give great performances.The other thing that is so remarkable about A SHINE OF RAINBOWS is the cinematography. Color plays a major element in the film. Shot a different way, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS could have had a very different tone and mood. However, director and writer Vic Sarin brought the story to life by filling it with the perfect balance of color. I realize that this use of color is symbolic (representing the love and hope that is brought into Tomas life), but it could have either been overused or not used enough. In short, it's one of the best shot movies I have seen in a long time.Some might find the overall plot of A SHINE OF RAINBOWS to be clich&eacute;d. I realize the overall plot is one that is used rather frequently. However, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS has such strong characters and is shot so well, that it mostly avoids the clich&eacute;s of similarly plotted films.Conflicts occur, an animatronic baby seal needs to be fed, Tom&aacute;s needs to come out of his shell, his mother gets sick, rainbows fall out of the sky and are sparkly, and once again, did I mention there was a cute baby seal? It is clearly a family film and based on a book. You can watch this with your kids and all enjoy it, but there is one scene where the kid is basked in the glow of a sparkly rainbow that made me groan (went a little too far, folks). I didn't even mind the fake baby seal, it was still cute. The story is filled with clich&eacute;s, but they seem to be overlooked in light of the fact that the story takes place in the sixties in Ireland, a fantastical land where anything can happen. John Bell is an obvious newcomer to film, he can pore on the hysterics in an emotional scene, but in regular everyday scenes comes off as REALLY stiff and the stammering is unnatural. He has potential though so he just needs to keep at it.Overall, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS has a somewhat predictable plot, but the film's strong acting and splendid cinematography make it a must see film.The DVD features a promo for FoxFaith films, a trailer for the movie LIKE DANDELION DUST, and a 48-minute documentary entitled ""So Many Colours: The Making of A SHINE OF RAINBOWS.""  The documentary is narrated by producer Tina Pehme and features some interviews with director Vic Sarin. The short documentary provides a good overview of the filming process from location scouting, auditioning, casting, actual filming, and the creation of the animatronic seal named Smudge.",5,Simply a Gorgeous Movie,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,4140,"['Set', 'Corrie', 'Island', 'Ireland', 'early', '1960', 'A', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'story', 'orphan', 'boy', 'named', 'Tomas', 'who', 'adopted', 'woman', 'named', 'Maire', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'husband', 'Alec', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Tomas', 'John', 'Bell', 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'outcast', 'beauty', 'what', 'others', 'consider', 'mundane', 'also', 'difficulty', 'speaking', 'vilified', 'other', 'boys', 'not', 'normal', 'Maire', 'Alec', 'are', 'unable', 'have', 'child', 'own', 'Maire', 'Tomas', 'be', 'son', 'Life', 'Corrie', 'much', 'different', 'orphanage', 'mainland', 'Tomas', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'surrounded', 'beauty', 'nature', 'overcome', 'speaking', 'problem', 'Maire', 'Tomas', 'shortly', 'arriving', 'begins', 'calling', 'Mum', 'Alec', 'boy', 'little', 'moments', 'affection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'call', 'Tomas', 'son', 'most', 'clearly', 'evidenced', 'refusal', 'sign', 'Tomas', 'adoption', 'papers', 'tragedy', 'occurs', 'Tomas', 'new', 'life', 'rushes', 'oblivion.I', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'A', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'year', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'AM', 'trailer', 'really', 'intrigued', 'me.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'amazing', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'role', 'different', 'many', 'played', 'past', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'superb', 'Maire', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'However', 'young', 'John', 'Bell', 'Tomas', 'who', 'standout', 'star', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'movie', 'marketed', 'America', 'Bell', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'sorts', 'awards', 'accolades', 'Just', 'A', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'Tomas', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'seem', 'take', 'cue', 'Bell', 'give', 'great', 'performances.The', 'other', 'thing', 'so', 'remarkable', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'cinematography', 'Color', 'major', 'element', 'film', 'Shot', 'different', 'way', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'tone', 'mood', 'However', 'director', 'writer', 'Vic', 'Sarin', 'brought', 'story', 'life', 'filling', 'perfect', 'balance', 'color', 'realize', 'use', 'color', 'symbolic', 'representing', 'love', 'hope', 'brought', 'Tomas', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'overused', 'not', 'used', 'enough', 'short', 'one', 'best', 'shot', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time.Some', 'might', 'find', 'overall', 'plot', 'A', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'realize', 'overall', 'plot', 'one', 'used', 'rather', 'frequently', 'However', 'A', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'such', 'strong', 'characters', 'shot', 'so', 'well', 'mostly', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'similarly', 'plotted', 'films.Conflicts', 'occur', 'animatronic', 'baby', 'seal', 'be', 'fed', 'Tom', 'aacute', 'come', 'shell', 'mother', 'sick', 'fall', 'sky', 'are', 'sparkly', 'once', 'again', 'did', 'mention', 'there', 'was', 'cute', 'baby', 'seal', 'clearly', 'family', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'can', 'watch', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'kid', 'basked', 'glow', 'sparkly', 'rainbow', 'made', 'groan', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'folks', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'fake', 'baby', 'seal', 'was', 'still', 'cute', 'story', 'filled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'seem', 'be', 'overlooked', 'light', 'fact', 'story', 'place', 'sixties', 'Ireland', 'fantastical', 'land', 'where', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'John', 'Bell', 'obvious', 'newcomer', 'film', 'can', 'pore', 'hysterics', 'emotional', 'scene', 'regular', 'everyday', 'scenes', 'off', 'REALLY', 'stiff', 'stammering', 'unnatural', 'potential', 'so', 'just', 'keep', 'it.Overall', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'plot', 'film', 'strong', 'acting', 'splendid', 'cinematography', 'make', 'must', 'see', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'promo', 'FoxFaith', 'films', 'trailer', 'movie', 'LIKE', 'DANDELION', 'DUST', '48-minute', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'So', 'Many', 'Colours', 'Making', 'A', 'SHINE', 'OF', 'RAINBOWS', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'producer', 'Tina', 'Pehme', 'interviews', 'director', 'Vic', 'Sarin', 'short', 'documentary', 'good', 'overview', 'filming', 'process', 'location', 'scouting', 'auditioning', 'casting', 'actual', 'filming', 'creation', 'animatronic', 'seal', 'named', 'Smudge']",A Shine of Rainbows [Region 4]
