For one, the dvd is missing the show when Vanessa lied about her were abouts when she went to Baltimore,MD to see the 'Ratchess' and got stranded there. Two, when Vanessa got drunk with her friends from playing the alphabet game. And three, when all the men were pregnant. Those were the most memorable to me. So in my opinion they should have had more than 10 episodes. There were alot of good ones they missed.",4,"Good, but missed a few..",1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,482,"['liked', 'picked', 'shows', 'dvd', 'were', 'missing', 'few', 'one', 'dvd', 'missing', 'show', 'when', 'Vanessa', 'lied', 'were', 'abouts', 'when', 'went', 'Baltimore', 'MD', 'see', ""'Ratchess"", 'got', 'stranded', 'there', 'Two', 'when', 'Vanessa', 'got', 'drunk', 'friends', 'playing', 'alphabet', 'game', 'three', 'when', 'men', 'were', 'pregnant', 'were', 'most', 'memorable', 'So', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', '10', 'episodes', 'were', 'alot', 'good', 'ones', 'missed']",The Best of the Cosby Show

This set has most of the episodes that I remember from the series run.  Don't expect superb picture quality, but it looks at least as good as the original broadcasts.  There are no bonuses.  Episodes are in broadcast order.  For example, the first is from season 1, then you get one or two from each of the seasons that followed, in chronological order.",4,Nice sampling,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,485,"['nice', 'sampling', 'better', 'Cosby', 'episodes', 'liked', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'purchase', 'watch', 'entire', 'season', 'sets', 'set', 'most', 'episodes', 'remember', 'series', 'run', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'superb', 'picture', 'quality', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'bonuses', 'Episodes', 'are', 'broadcast', 'order', 'example', 'first', 'season', '1', 'then', 'get', 'one', 'two', 'seasons', 'followed', 'chronological', 'order']",The Best of the Cosby Show

Like millions of other families, every Thursday night when this came on, my family and I would get around the TV and watch it.Why is ""The Cosby Show"" so groundbreaking?It is really the first accurate depiction of an African-American family. Prior to ""The Cosby Show,"" African-American sitcoms always had the buffoon character with unrealistic storylines. But ""The Cosby Show"" refused to pander to the lowest common denominator. And by doing so they became the Number One Sitcom in the country. ""The Cosby Show"" said that the black family was no different from the white family or the Asian-American family or the Latin-American family. Maybe the main message of ""The Cosby Show"" was that in the end we all have the same problems and the same goals.It's really hard to say who my favorite character is on ""The Cosby Show."" The entire cast is so likeable. Watching them was like watching old friends. If I had to pick, of course first would be Dr. Huxtable (played by the Cos, of course.) Because even when the kids did something wrong he was fair but very funny. And, coming in at a close second is Denise (Lilakoi Moon, more commonly known as Lisa Bonet.) Denise was always such a free spirit. And, of course I adored Mrs. Huxtable (Phylicia Rashd.)
