I recently picked up this DVD on a whim and I guess you can't go home again.  While I am impressed with the story still a few things got in the way of me fully enjoying it now.As I said I think the story, which follows the novel by Peter Beagle almost faithfully, is very good.  Disney films at the time this was released (early 1980's) I thought somewhat talked down to children.  That is not the case here and the story deals with love, sacrifice and even death.  I think that has much to do with the source novel which was written for aduilts, not children.  The cast and voice acting was very good, especially Mia Farrow.The good story aside I did have a few issues with this film.  The first is the animation by Rankin/Bass which I now think is sub par and at times even sloppy.  Second the DVD transfer is very bad, and as another reviewer mentioned, it looks like they used a VHS tape as the source of the transfer.  Finally the movie has a few musical bits that probably worked for me when I was 10 but had me cringing at 34.

Even though the DVD does not have the special features it touts on the backcover, I was just happy to have the film on DVD -I thought they would never release it!The Last Unicorn is about an immortal unicorn who leaves her enchanted forest after learning the rest of the unicorns have vanished from the Earth. On her quest she meets many memorable characters: gypsywoman Mommy Fortuna, Molly Grue, Shmendrick the Magician- to name a few.  Molly, Shmendrick and the unicorn ban together, Molly and Shmendrick on their own emotional quests, and journey to King Hagard's castle where the unicorns are being held captive. Along the journey she is almost captured by The Red Bull, King Hagard's demon that holds the rest of the unicorns hostage. If she is captured, their quests ends, so Shmendrick changes her into a human girl so they can get past the bull and enter King Hagard's castle. As an immortal creature she never had to deal with mortal concerns, and as the beautiful woman Amalthea she begins to understand what it means to be human: the serach of identity, love, conflict, empathy. She learns of regret and thankfulness, of life and loss. Like the hobbits from ""Lord of the Rings,"" the unicorn concludes her journey, but is forever changed by the friends she made the experiences she had. The forest will always be her home, but she no longer like the rest of the unicorns, for they will never know what it is to be human.This film is deeper than any animated film has a right to be. It works on several levels, and the older I become the more I see in it.  The plot is complex and almost all of the character's are three-dimensional. The characters are voiced by some great acting talent: Alan Arkin (Shmendrick), Jeff Bridges ( Prince Leer), Mia Farrow (The Unicorn)- to name a few. The musical score is very befitting.

A butterfly tells her that the red bull has taken them, all of the unicorns and herded them off and covering there footprints. But where they have gone he can not say, and so the unicorn starts her long journey to find them. Along the way she meets a wizard and a woman who travel with her to find the red bull of king haggard and the unicorns. When they are attacked by the red bull there is no way to escape but to change the unicorn into a beautiful lady. As they say in king haggard's castle the lovely unicorn captures the heart of the prince but as the 2 fall in love the unicorn becomes more and more human!

The screenplay was adapted from the original novel by the original author and really knows how to draw the audience in and make them a part of the fantasy.The voice acting in this movie outshines the animation.  With voices from the likes of Christopher Lee, Mia Farrow, Jeff Bridges, Angela Lansbury and many other well-known names, the characters in this story come to life and in an amazing and magical way.  This cast could not have been better selected and the songs and orchestrations provided by America really help to highlight the tone and theme of the movie.The animation is traditional for the Rankin Bass studios.  It shines in action and detail scenes but, can be choppy and slow in other areas.  This still does not detract from the story and will probably go unnoticed by the audience as they are drawn into the film.The commentary track and other features are really amazing.  Peter Beagle, the author of the original novel and screenplay really highlights the way in which the story was developed and demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of animation and the animating process despite it not being his particular field of expertise.If someone enjoys this film, the blue ray release will not disappoint.  The image quality is superb and the audio is flawless.  It also has both the original theatrical release audio as well as an edited ""family"" track that cuts out one or two curse words used.

How can they possibly screw them up in this way?  And how can they do this over and over AND OVER?  To make this mistake once as a quick way to make a quick buck during all the hype over LOTR made sense, but here's a film that no one is going to buy unless they are already a fan.  Why give it the same lousy treatment?In fact, if they were in such a rush, why not just somehow duplicate the german DVD?  It seems like it would actually have been MORE work to do the terrible job they did.And like The Hobbit, what really blows my mind is the lowsy artwork.  The hobbit in particular had fantastic cover artwork, etc. thanks to the magnificient talent of Topcraft (that would go on to become studio ghibli, surprise!), but instead it got a truly bad cover (don't worry, they're busy doing the same sort of facelift to all the children books you grew up loving too!).  The last Unicorn suffers the same exact fate.  Due to Amazon being a global store, you can just go to the bottom of the page, click on germany and type Last Unicorn right into the search engine.  When you see how great that cover looks, you'll never want to look at this one again.I really don't understand what gives.  During the mid 70's through the very early 80's, some strange, and even intelligent animation was coming out--animation that was more literate and less song and dance.  Anyone remember the Mouse and his Child animated film?

352867,A79ZS4YI5U6XR,6303047564,deborah,"[3, 11]","I really felt like this movie wasted my time without giving anything worthwhile in return. Because it's by Arthur Rankin of Rankin-Bass, I hoped for a truly classic story, like Rudolph or Year Without a Santa Claus, and all of the endearingly unforgettable elements that go with it (like Heat Miser and Snow Miser, or the Island of Misfit Toys). Instead, this is a drawn-out, poorly-architected story that poses as a fairy tale, and is like someone's stoned or drunken epic hallucination. It's not appropriate for young children, with a scary roaring ghostly bull and a couple of other random ugly monsters, but it's not a strong enough story to win the interest of an adult.The Last Unicorn searching for the other unicorns (since they're immortal - what happened to them?) is a premise with so much possibility. But this movie just blew it with a combination of burlesque (a hippie butterfly who sounds like Cheech singing clues to the unicorn, ""Schmedrick the Magician"" who can't ever make his spells come out right, etc.) and plain crummy plot development. The unicorn accidentally gets turned into a naked blonde woman with a striking cartoon-y resemblance to Stevie Nicks, and after falling in love with the prince in the castle where she, Schmedrick and Maggie (a good-hearted outlaw picked up from an incompetent outlaw band in the forest) are hoping to find the other unicorns, she wants to forget she was a unicorn at all.But the story keeps right on wasting time with a skeleton that can't stop laughing when it's asked for magical answers, the dreamy cynicism of the castle's gruesome ""king"", and the ramblings of a pirate-y cat.It just goes on and on, but not in any meaningful way. The unicorn lost my interest and sympathy when she never seemed to care about the people who were trying to help her, the magician also kept on refusing to try at crucial moments, and the ending - where she is turned back into a unicorn and has freed the lost others - is not satisfying. You never see her meet the other unicorns or return to her forest to resume protecting the ordinary animals abandoned there, nor does she say thank you or goodbye to the prince.

If you know my name, tell it to me.""The Butterfly: [quoting Romeo & Juliet] ""Your name is a golden bell hung in my heart. I would break my body to pieces to call you once by your name...!""Unicorn: ""Say it, if you know.""The Butterfly: ""Rumpelstiltskin! Gotcha!""During her quest, she meets ""Mama Fortuna"", a witch-hag with a tree stump for a hat, who is accompanied by an ogre-like henchman and a bumbling wanna'-be ""magician"" named ""Schmendrick"" {which I have come to call occultniks}.Schmendrick: ""I am Schmendrick the magician, last of the red hot swamis.""Fortuna runs a travelling carnival sideshow which features a satyr, harpie, and a manticor, among other creatures of legend for the awe and gawkings of villagers. She feels she hits bank when she discovers and captures the unicorn for display, who warns her that the harpie will one day take her due, and can see through the spell placed upon these others who amount to nothing more than an old toothless lion and a monkey.Mommy Fortuna: ""The harpy's as real as you are, and just as immortal. And she was just as easy to catch, if you want to know.""Unicorn: ""Do not boast, old woman. You death sits in that cage, and she hears you.""Mommy Fortuna: ""Oh, she'll kill me one day or another. But she will remember forever that I caught her, and I held her prisoner. So there's my immortality, eh?""Unicorn: ""Let me go. And let her go to. I cannot bear to see her caged. We are two sides of the same magic... The harpy and me, we are not for you.""Schmendrick decides to help the unicorn and eventually accompanies her in her escape and quest to the dark castle. A country wench 'Molly Grue' joins them, regretful that the unicorn did not visit her when she was ""new"", yet becomes her servant nonetheless.Molly: ""Where were you twenty years ago? Ten years ago? Where were you when I was new? When I was one of those innocent young maidens you always come to? How dare you! How dare you come to me now, when I am this!""At The Castle, the unicorn is transformed into 'Lady Amalthea' {Mia Farrow} and meets King Haggard {Christopher Lee}, Prince Lir {Jeff Bridges}, along with a talking pirate cat and an obnoxious though entertaining skeleton with a penchant for wine. Amalthea falls in love with Prince Lir, which keeps her from changing back into the unicorn for awhile. As the mortal Lady Amalthea, the transformed unicorn feels her magic diminishing, the longer she remains a woman, and can feel her new body ""dying all around her"".The group gather the clues and finally reach the other unicorns where both Schmendrick and Prince Lir battle The Red Bull.The Skull: ""To get to the Red Bull's chamber, you must go through time. A clock isn't time; it's only gears and springs. Pay it no mind.""The Cat: ""When the wine drinks itself, when the skull speaks, when the clock strikes the right time, only then will you find the funnel that leads to the Red Bull. There be a trick to it, of course.""The Last Unicorn features an ""all-star"" cast, and the folkish music of 'America', which actually works quite well here.Overall, it seems the Last Unicorn is a ""coming of age"" tale, the journey of a girl into womanhood until finally finding her purpose in life.Unicorn: [now a woman] ""I am afraid of this mortal body... more afraid than I was of the Red Bull.""Unicorn: ""Once, I can't remember, I was long ago, someone strange. I was innocent and wise, and full of pain. Now that I'm a woman, everything has changed. Once, when I was searching, somewhere out of reach, far away, in a place I could not find, or heart obey.

Simply, the movie has been ""sped up"" by 4%, which is what happens when movies are put on video in Europe due the difference in frame rate. It looks like what the geniuses who released this DVD did was, take the 4% faster overseas version (meaning the audio pitch is higher), and simply use that without first trying to ""reconvert"" it back to our system to get the correct time/speed. But wait, this is equally lame, we shouldn't need to convert from a previously converted format, as the U.S. format ""is"" the original format.Bottom line, this release is not any kind of remaster, it was simply stolen from a European release that wasn't even that good. The best quality DVD version ever released for this movie (to date of this review) was the German release, the quality will blow you away. The only drawbacks for viewing in the U.S. is, you would need a multi-format DVD player for playback (though your PC drive will work), and, you would have the 4% speed hike. Most people won't notice the speed increase, but in music it is more noticeable.Get the German DVD if you can, it has both 2.0 and 5.1 audio, and pristine video quality in true widescreen. And it has the originally UNEDITED audio. Wonder if Lion's Gate will actually do it right for the Blu-Ray release.***** AMENDED FOR BLU-RAY REVIEW, READ BELOW:DO NOT waste your money on the U.S. blu-ray release, Lionsgate dropped the ball again, the quality is awful: colors are faded, and there is so much grain it makes no sense....the good news is, the German blu-ray on the Concorde label looks like it was made yesterday, and that is no exaggeration...the colors will blow you away, but even better is the clarity and detail, it's jaw dropping, even the background forest scenes are razor sharp. AND THERE IS NO GRAIN. And, Blu-ray high definiton video doesn't have the 4% speed issues that standard definiton DVD's have. Also, The German Blu-ray is region free, so it will play on U.S Blu-ray players, except for the extras, which will not play at all as they are standard defintion.Below are the links for the German Blu-ray, and the German 3D version of the Blu-ray; to help navigate through the german language, I found it helpful to match the pages with same U.S. amazon pages to see what options I needed to use to buy it:http://www.amazon.de/letzte-Einhorn-Blu-ray-Arthur-Rankin/dp/B005FUO7D6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1364742928&sr;=8-3http://www.amazon.de/Einhorn-Version-magnetischem-3D-Wackelbild-Blu-ray/dp/B0094M6DTC/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1364742928&sr;=8-5",1,...this review is for QUALITY of the 25th Anniversary DVD release & Blu-Ray,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,2671,"['original', 'run', 'time', 'movie', '92', 'minutes', '25th', 'anniversary', 'version', '89', 'minutes', 'yet', 'scenes', 'are', 'cut', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'Simply', 'movie', 'been', 'sped', 'up', '4', '%', 'what', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'put', 'video', 'Europe', 'due', 'difference', 'frame', 'rate', 'what', 'geniuses', 'who', 'released', 'DVD', 'did', 'was', 'take', '4', '%', 'faster', 'overseas', 'version', 'meaning', 'audio', 'pitch', 'higher', 'simply', 'use', 'first', 'trying', 'reconvert', 'back', 'system', 'get', 'correct', 'time/speed', 'wait', 'equally', 'lame', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'convert', 'previously', 'converted', 'format', 'U.S.', 'format', 'original', 'format.Bottom', 'line', 'release', 'not', 'kind', 'remaster', 'was', 'simply', 'stolen', 'European', 'release', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'best', 'quality', 'DVD', 'version', 'ever', 'released', 'movie', 'date', 'review', 'was', 'German', 'release', 'quality', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'only', 'drawbacks', 'viewing', 'U.S.', 'would', 'need', 'multi-format', 'DVD', 'player', 'playback', 'PC', 'drive', 'will', 'work', 'would', 'have', '4', '%', 'speed', 'hike', 'Most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'speed', 'increase', 'music', 'more', 'German', 'DVD', 'can', '2.0', '5.1', 'audio', 'pristine', 'video', 'quality', 'true', 'widescreen', 'originally', 'UNEDITED', 'audio', 'Wonder', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'will', 'actually', 'do', 'right', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', '*****', 'AMENDED', 'FOR', 'BLU-RAY', 'REVIEW', 'READ', 'BELOW', 'DO', 'NOT', 'waste', 'money', 'U.S.', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'Lionsgate', 'dropped', 'ball', 'again', 'quality', 'awful', 'colors', 'are', 'faded', 'so', 'much', 'grain', 'sense', '.the', 'good', 'news', 'German', 'blu-ray', 'Concorde', 'label', 'was', 'made', 'yesterday', 'exaggeration', 'colors', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'even', 'better', 'clarity', 'detail', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'even', 'background', 'forest', 'scenes', 'are', 'razor', 'sharp', 'THERE', 'IS', 'NO', 'GRAIN', 'Blu-ray', 'high', 'definiton', 'video', ""n't"", 'have', '4', '%', 'speed', 'issues', 'standard', 'DVD', 'have', 'Also', 'German', 'Blu-ray', 'region', 'free', 'will', 'play', 'U.S', 'Blu-ray', 'players', 'extras', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'are', 'standard', 'defintion.Below', 'are', 'links', 'German', 'Blu-ray', 'German', '3D', 'version', 'Blu-ray', 'help', 'navigate', 'german', 'language', 'found', 'helpful', 'match', 'pages', 'same', 'U.S.', 'amazon', 'pages', 'see', 'what', 'options', 'needed', 'use', 'buy', 'http', '//www.amazon.de/letzte-Einhorn-Blu-ray-Arthur-Rankin/dp/B005FUO7D6/ref=sr_1_3', 'ie=UTF8', 'qid', '=1364742928', 'sr', '=8-3http', '//www.amazon.de/Einhorn-Version-magnetischem-3D-Wackelbild-Blu-ray/dp/B0094M6DTC/ref=sr_1_5', 'ie=UTF8', 'qid', '=1364742928', 'sr', '=8-5']",The Last Unicorn VHS

352879,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,6303047564,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","This movie is one of the few adaptations of a novel that has kept true to the book but also become an independent cult hit. The movie stays pretty close to the book. While it has to cut out content due to length, what content it has is largely driven from the book. In fact, many lines are taken directly from the novel (indeed, Peter S. Beagle himself wrote the screenplay).The animation generally supports the story. It's a bit comical, but also can be dark or odd, as required by the story. However, in a few places the animation shows its age. In particular, some of the people are drawn to odd extremes.

The movie is from 1982, and it is based on the novel by Peter S. Beagle.The film is about a female unicorn named Amalthea. She overhears two men saying that she is the only unicorn left in the world. She is confused by this, since unicorns are immortal. She is also angry about the fact that humans cannot see her horn, and believe that she is simply a horse. When Amalthea meets a butterfly, he tells her that a monster called The Red Bull drove the unicorns away somewhere. She is later captured by a witch, but the witch's servant named Schmendrick saves her, and they meet a woman named Molly. After Amalthea comes across the Red Bull, Shmendrick transforms Amalthea into a human. The rest of the film involves Amalthea, Shmendrick, and Molly trying to find a way to save the captured unicorns, and bring Amalthea back to her normal form.The movie is well written and it has sophisticated dialogue and good voice acting.

Along with Flight of Dragons, the Last Unicorn has got to be one of the most underappreciated animated masterpieces ever (but not for much longer, I hope). While Flight of Dragons was more intellectual, the Last Unicorn was more poignant and emotional. A wonderful fairy tale with heart and soul for people of all ages.The animation is simple yet graceful and elegant, filled with rich beautiful basic colors. It has a surreal and dreamlike quality (even more so than Flight of Dragons). The character designs for the most part were excellent, particularly Lady Amalthea whose exotic beauty is breathtaking. I especially love the way her long beautiful, willowy hair flows in the wind...The music is quite memorable, although the singing voices for Lady Amalthea and Prince Lir were a bit warbly at times (though the songs themselves were rather nice). The background music fits and complements the scenes perfectly.And who can ever forget the voice acting. God, such absolute pure star quality!!! You can almost imagine as if these were real live flesh and blood people (especially Molly Grue).The story is one of the most original I have ever come across. Based on the classic novel by Peter S. Beagle (who also did the screenplay), a lonely immortal unicorn goes out in search for others of her kind, meets some very interesting humans (some good, some bad, and some in between) along the way. She is later unwittingly given a taste of mortality and love in a way she could have never imagined when she is accidently transformed into a beautiful human maiden by a bungling magician. This is a fairy tale with dramatic and emotional depth of Shakespearean proportions. Deeply moving, moody, and atmosperic. They just don't make such powerful, thoughtful stuff like this anymore.Now that they are in the process of developing a live action version of this film with several of the original voice actors participating in it (some even reprising their roles), it's more important than ever to own this beautiful masterpiece for your collection.

So of course I had to buy it as an adult. I think the appeal as a kid was simply because it was about unicorns, which I loved and collected (and still do). Now? I'm not sure. The movie is confusing, complicated, and not exactly a kid's story. I picked up the book recently, hoping it would add insight to the film, as films are always condensed, and it did. I have to say this is one instance I like the movie better. The unicorn - usually portrayed as such amazing creatures, was such a snob in the book, frankly. She was untouchable. She was perfect and had no compassion. It wasn't because she was mean. It was simply bacause she was SO perfect, nothing mattered. Or something like that. In the movie, the unicorn, while still coming across as infallible, was also kind.I originally owned the other DVD edition of this movie and had to replace it because this was the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" and I thought it would be special. As years passed in between viewings, I am uncertain, but... was this edited? I could have sworn when Molly Grue met the unicorn, she yelled ""Damn you! Damn you!"" several times.

Alford,"[3, 3]","Probably one of the most cherished non-Disney animated family movies from the last century, The Last Unicorn was based on the book of the same name by Peter S. Beagle. This was one of the few theatrical movies produced by Jules Bass and Aurthur Rankin Jr., better known as Rankin/Bass, the creators of nearly every Christmas holiday TV special, and other hit shows like Thundercats and Silverhawks.Set sometime during the middle ages, a unicorn discovers from a passing butterfly that she is the only one left in the world. She leaves her forest in search of them, but gets captured by a witch for her travelling carnival. The unicorn is set free by the novice magician Schmendrick. Along the way, they are accompanied by the ex-bandit wench Molly Grue. The trio make their way to realm of King Haggard where the other unicorns are supposed to be. Once there, Haggard's menacing Red Bull appears to drive the unicorn into the sea. In order to protect her, Schmendrick taps into his true magic and turns the unicorn into a human female, which makes the Red Bull give up on her. Our heroes then enter into Haggard's castle under the guise of looking for work, with Schmendrick claiming that the now-human unicorn is his niece, Amalthea. Schmendrick keeps Haggard entertained, while Molly searches for a way into the Red Bull's lair which is supposed to lead to the missing unicorns. Haggard's son Lir has meanwhile has fallen in love with Amalthea, believing her to be just a beautiful girl, while at the same time Amalthea is growing fond of him and growing to forget her former life as a unicorn. Molly and Schmendrick eventually find the secret entrance, and with Alamathea and Lir into tow, they confront the Red Bull. Amalthea is changed back into a human, who because of her newfound human feelings is able to defeat the Red Bull and free all the unicorns that were trapped in the sea. Amalthea the unicorn then heads back for her forest, with Schmendrick and Molly apparently hooking up together in the end.This film features some of the best animation by the Rankin/Bass group since their animated version of The Hobbit. The studio responsible for most of the actual animation though was Topcraft, whose work also includes the anime movie Nausicaa. The character designs are very unique and original too. The movie features an odd assortment of voice actors, like Mia Farrow doing a wonderful job as the unicorn, Christopher Lee as the mad Haggard, Alan Arkin as indifferent Schmendrick, and Rene Auberjonois steals his scene as a laughing skeleton. There have been two DVD releases of this movie, the original, and the 25th Anniversary Edition which has way better quality.

Weinthal ""Flesh""","[3, 4]","After seeing a screening of this film last night, I realized that the current DVD release has been heavily censored to please over protective parents. As Mr. Beagle said himself, ""When sold at Wallmart, it looked like 'My Little Pony' on steroids. When parents actually saw the film they were upset by its content. Walmart put the pressure on Lion's Gate and this cut of the movie was removed.""This release of the DVD still is in its uncut form. The '25th Anniversary Edition' DVD has only the censored cut of the film. In that version over 12 minutes have been removed and Amalthea's human body has been retouched to eliminate any nudity.So I know that this release of the DVD has very poor quality but it is worth buying. Let me let you in on a little secret...The '25th Anniversary Edition' DVD has almost exactly the same poor sound and video quality. In my opinion, the '25th Anniversary Edition' DVD has worse picture quality with only a monotone soundtrack. The version on this older DVD release has better sound than the newer one. Both soundtracks are titled 'monotone' but on the original release the sound is better. I think that the reason for this is because the '25th Anniversary Edition' was ripped off a VHS then transfered to DVD without re-mastering (except for the censorship). This older edition of the DVD was probably taken from a recording that HBO had been given for broadcast. All in all, buy the older edition and skip the '25th Anniversary' DVD.

I loved the soundtrack, the animation and the characters. I remember naming my first stuffed unicorn ""Amalthea"" after this film.I saw this DVD on sale at the grocery store and snatched it up, eagerly waiting for the day that my daughter would be old enough to enjoy it.It sat in the box for close to a year. While at an endurance ride, it began to rain and my student and I ran home to get this DVD to watch on her mom's laptop in the camper. All of us visibly cringed when we watched the bad redubbing of the same butterfly scene over and over again as he continued to ramble--horrible editing! ""Now THat I'm A Woman"" should have been left out, or at least grafted more smoothly into existing footage. Several scenes, such as when Amalthea looks at her reflection and unicorn paintings and the scene where she and King Haggard converse on the parapet are ruined by bad dubbing and editing. I've seen community college broadcasting students do better editing jobs.However, there are a few scenes that are somewhat interesting. One where Schmendrick overhears Lir calling him ""that ridiculous magician"" and the Midgard serpent in the carnival.Story is excellent, characters are truly unique, soundtrack is emotionally charged (I often cry) but there needs to be a ""cleaned up"" DVD release.

352914,ADEETJWRKD6OA,6303047564,"J. Moran ""aralim""","[8, 8]","My seeing this movie took a convoluted route. I saw the trailers as a young teenager, never got to see the movie, then found the book lying on a shelf at my summer camp, gathering dust. The camp counselors let me keep it, and I loved every page. A few years later, my local video store got a copy and I finally saw the movie.Normally, after reading the book the movie is a vast disappointment. Not so with this. The movie captures all of the essentials and most of the small details of the novel, and keeps the same energy level and emotions. The fact that Mr. Beagle wrote the screenplay as well as the novel probably has something to do with this. ;-)The characters are very well interpreted and acted, with the best performances given by Angela Lansbury (Mommy Fortuna) and Christopher Lee (King Haggard). Picking Robert Klein as the Butterfly was an inspired choice -- even though it's only a five-minute portion of the film, the producers paid as much attention to this minor character as to the major ones that fill the story.As other reviewers have noted, you get the impression that none of the characters are truly &quot;evil&quot;. They simply have suffered bad fortune or disappointment (as everyone in life does at one time or another), and how they chose to react to that is what ultimately shaped their character. This is a nice touch and a welcome departure from standard &quot;black-and-white&quot; fantasy characters.The music soundtrack, frankly, is bland, and many of the songs are unnecessary (the romantic duet between the Unicorn and Prince Lir is particularly saccharine -- yes, I'm a guy, but I'm a married guy with a daughter and thinking of that song STILL turns my stomach). On the plus side, most of the songs were performed by America, and they seemed to understand the music was secondary to the overall story and kept things reasonably muted and subdued.The animation isn't the best. I felt like I was watching &quot;The Hobbit&quot; again, just with a different story. But the animation is just a conveyance for the story, and the story is what is most important here.This is a must-have for any fantasy-lovers video collection. While there is some violence and some slightly scary scenes, it's still a Rankin/Bass animation, and that means that kids won't be unduly frightened.",5,A near-perfect adaptation of the original novel!,980553600,"01 27, 2001",2001,2310,"['seeing', 'movie', 'took', 'convoluted', 'route', 'saw', 'trailers', 'young', 'teenager', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'found', 'book', 'lying', 'shelf', 'summer', 'camp', 'gathering', 'dust', 'camp', 'counselors', 'let', 'keep', 'loved', 'page', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'got', 'copy', 'finally', 'saw', 'movie.Normally', 'reading', 'book', 'movie', 'vast', 'disappointment', 'Not', 'so', 'movie', 'essentials', 'most', 'small', 'details', 'novel', 'same', 'energy', 'level', 'emotions', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Beagle', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'novel', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'interpreted', 'acted', 'best', 'performances', 'given', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Mommy', 'Fortuna', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'King', 'Haggard', 'Picking', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'Butterfly', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'even', 'only', 'five-minute', 'portion', 'film', 'producers', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'minor', 'character', 'major', 'ones', 'fill', 'story.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'get', 'impression', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'truly', 'quot', 'quot', 'simply', 'have', 'suffered', 'bad', 'fortune', 'disappointment', 'everyone', 'life', 'one', 'time', 'how', 'chose', 'react', 'what', 'ultimately', 'shaped', 'character', 'nice', 'touch', 'welcome', 'departure', 'standard', 'quot', 'black-and-white', 'quot', 'characters.The', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'frankly', 'bland', 'many', 'songs', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'romantic', 'duet', 'Unicorn', 'Prince', 'Lir', 'particularly', 'saccharine', 'yes', ""'m"", 'guy', ""'m"", 'married', 'guy', 'daughter', 'thinking', 'song', 'STILL', 'stomach', 'plus', 'side', 'most', 'songs', 'were', 'performed', 'America', 'seemed', 'understand', 'music', 'was', 'secondary', 'overall', 'story', 'kept', 'things', 'reasonably', 'muted', 'subdued.The', 'animation', ""n't"", 'best', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'quot', 'Hobbit', 'quot', 'again', 'just', 'different', 'story', 'animation', 'just', 'conveyance', 'story', 'story', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'here.This', 'must-have', 'fantasy-lovers', 'video', 'collection', 'violence', 'slightly', 'scary', 'scenes', 'still', 'Rankin/Bass', 'animation', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'unduly', 'frightened']",The Last Unicorn VHS

352929,A2YRZPGWLPB2OF,6303047564,Kodi Kodai,"[0, 0]","First off, the exquisite animation of Rankin & Bass' ""the Last Unicorn"" was splendid for its time and still looks wonderful to these eyes today.  Also, it's a small world:  the beautiful animation production was done by the Japanese animation studio which was known as Top Craft, which also did the animation for Rankin & Bass' the Hobbit (1977) and the Return of the King (1980).  After the Last Unicorn (1982) the Top Craft Studio staff was hired for a domestic animation project in Japan that would later become Hayao Miyazaki's incredible feature filmNausicaa of the Valley of the Wind(1984). And after that, the staff of Top Craft was then incorporated into Studio Ghibli -- one of the most highly regarded and finest animation studios in the world.When it was first released back in 1982, I saw the Last Unicorn in a theater. I remember the audience's response in the theater: the adoration was genuine throughout the screening of the film. I also recall the critic's highly positive reviews in the newspapers at that time.Peter S. Beagle's screenplay adaption of his original novel is simply astonishing. It was one of the most unusual and also one of the finest screenplays for an animated film that I had ever seen, and very unusual for a single American scriptwriter (for a 2d animated film anyway, until Brad Bird's 3D film 'the Incredibles' and 'ratatouille' for Pixar. 'Nausicaa of the Valley Wind' is a film adaption of Hayao Miyazaki's comic book.) Beagle's screenplay is an adaption of his book--and a fine and beautiful adaption it is!Although the script is excellent, there are a couple of weak moments in 'the Last Unicorn' and it comes at a point near the final act in the film: there seems to be too many song interruptions, sometimes slowing or breaking the forward rhythm and momentum of the story. If sent to the cutting room floor back before its release in the early 80s, a couple of the songs probably would not have been missed.Other than that, the Last Unicorn is a rare literate-animation-cinema treat.****Other interesting and different animation film experiences you might enjoy: 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron', 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', 'the Secret world of Arrietty', and 'Watership down'.*****",5,Singular & Splendid in a Very Special Way,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2271,"['First', 'off', 'exquisite', 'animation', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'was', 'splendid', 'time', 'still', 'wonderful', 'eyes', 'today', 'Also', 'small', 'world', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'production', 'was', 'done', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'studio', 'was', 'known', 'Top', 'Craft', 'also', 'did', 'animation', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'Hobbit', '1977', 'Return', 'King', '1980', 'Last', 'Unicorn', '1982', 'Top', 'Craft', 'Studio', 'staff', 'was', 'hired', 'domestic', 'animation', 'project', 'Japan', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'incredible', 'feature', 'filmNausicaa', 'Valley', 'Wind', '1984', 'staff', 'Top', 'Craft', 'was', 'then', 'incorporated', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'regarded', 'finest', 'animation', 'studios', 'world.When', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'back', '1982', 'saw', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'theater', 'remember', 'audience', 'response', 'theater', 'adoration', 'was', 'genuine', 'screening', 'film', 'also', 'recall', 'critic', 'highly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'newspapers', 'time.Peter', 'S.', 'Beagle', 'screenplay', 'adaption', 'original', 'novel', 'simply', 'astonishing', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'also', 'one', 'finest', 'screenplays', 'animated', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'unusual', 'single', 'American', 'scriptwriter', '2d', 'animated', 'film', 'anyway', 'Brad', 'Bird', '3D', 'film', ""'the"", 'Incredibles', ""'ratatouille"", 'Pixar', ""'Nausicaa"", 'Valley', 'Wind', 'film', 'adaption', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'comic', 'book', 'Beagle', 'screenplay', 'adaption', 'book', 'fine', 'beautiful', 'adaption', 'script', 'excellent', 'are', 'couple', 'weak', 'moments', ""'the"", 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'point', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'there', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'song', 'interruptions', 'sometimes', 'slowing', 'breaking', 'forward', 'rhythm', 'momentum', 'story', 'sent', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'back', 'release', 'early', '80s', 'couple', 'songs', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'missed.Other', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'rare', 'literate-animation-cinema', 'treat', 'interesting', 'different', 'animation', 'film', 'experiences', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Delivery', 'Service', ""'Spirit"", 'Stallion', 'Cimarron', ""'Nausicaa"", 'Valley', 'Wind', 'Secret', 'world', 'Arrietty', 'down', '*****']",The Last Unicorn VHS

Most modern day children would lose interest in this film with its serious themes and lack of bouncy songs.  There is some violence, with a harpy with red nipples killing a witch and eating her.  Disney this ain't.  And its a good thing.The story is based on the novel of the same name by Peter S. Beagle.  It is about the last unicorn (Mia Farrow) who leaves her forest to find out if there are others of her kind.  Along the way, she meets sincere but bumbling magician Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) and a saucy woman named Molly.  Molly cries when she sees the unicorn.  She asks, ""Where were you twenty years ago?""  Even though Molly is no longer young and innocent, she goes along with the unicorn on her quest.The trio enters the realm of the decrepit King Haggard.  Haggard lives in a foreboding castle overlooking the sea.  Rumors are that there is a Red Bull on his land, and the bull or Haggard may know what happened to the rest of the unicorns.Beautiful, haunting songs and a great screenplay BY Peter S. Beagle makes this film complete.  A true masterpiece.  My favorite line is by the castle cat: ""No cat out of its first fur can be deceived by appearances.

It is not widescreen, but I could handle that if the picture was a little better.  They could have included some special features, such as interviews with the cast looking back at the making of the film.  I once read an interesting trivia fact that Christopher Lee (voice of King Haggard, better known nowadays for his performance as Saruman in the LOTR movies) brought his own copy of the book to the taping to make sure certain parts he deemed important were not taken out of the script.  Little things like that would have been great to see. do sometimes feel like they left things out from the book that would have been nice to see in order to understand the story better.  But this was the time of short cartoon movies.  Even full length movies weren't as long as the ones produced today.It is true that the animation is not the same as Disney movies.

Also, for the first time in the USA since its theatrical run, ""The Last Unicorn"" can be viewed in widescreen thanks to letterbox technology. The only real problem with this treatment of ""The Last Unicorn"" is a tiny bit of censoring (the removal of one or two instances of mild language that were in the original release). This annoys me on principle but generally goes unnoticed while one watches the film.The story itself is as wonderful as ever, and the Rankin-Bass animation and star-studded cast have lost none of their power.

(I  would have awarded five stars, not four, if the soundtrack had included  some or all of Beagle's original songs.)According to a story that has  been confirmed by the author, Christopher Lee (who supplied the voice for  King Haggard) showed up for the recording sessions armed with his own copy  of the book, with several places marked to indicate things that must not,  in his opinion, be omitted.All of the voices are execllently chosen --  Mia Farrow does the Unicorn/Lady Amalthea very well, indeed, Alan Arkin is  wonderful as the slightly befuddled sem-competent wizard, Schmendrick,  Christopher gives the perfect sad and weary reading to King Haggard, and  Robert Klein is absolutely marvellous as the Butterfly.This is a story  of inevitability and of the ending of things and of immortality and  mortality; of heroism and villainy and of love and joy and sorrow and  regret and of finding and of loss.The Unicorn must discover what it is  to be human and through that rediscover what it is to be a unicorn, so that  she can face the terrifying Red Bull.  King Haggard's son Prince Lir (Jeff  Bridges) must become a hero in order to understand that all things have  their destinies and their destined endings.And Schmendrick must learn  that even a wizard needs more than merely magic to be a whole person, no  matter how fiercely he desires magic...The whole story is about  destinies and quests and fulfillments -- &quot;Heroes know that things must  happen when it is time for them to happen. A quest may not simply be  abandoned; unicorns may go unrescued for a long time, but not forever; a  happy ending cannot come in the middle of the story,&quot; says Prince  Lir.Wonderful and sad, uplifting and (just a little, just enough) scary,  romantic and funny, this is a film for people of any age who have not  forgotten the magic of the words &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;",4,Too Bad About the Songs...,959472000,"05 28, 2000",2000,2459,"['overall', 'excellent', 'though', 'necessarily', 'quite', 'simplified', 'film', 'Peter', 'Beagle', 'wonderful', 'book.The', 'animation', 'classic', 'Japanese/anime', 'style', 'people', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'me.The', 'simplifications', 'storyline', 'mostly', 'involve', 'town', 'Hagsgate', 'outlaw', 'band', 'Captain', 'Cully', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'wannabe', 'quot', 'outlaw', 'quot', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'involve', 'omission', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'Beagle', 'wrote', 'included', 'part', 'text', 'are', 'replaced', 'things', 'songs', 'Jimmie', 'Webb', 'sung', 'America', 'would', 'have', 'awarded', 'five', 'stars', 'not', 'four', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'included', 'Beagle', 'original', 'songs', 'According', 'story', 'been', 'confirmed', 'author', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'who', 'supplied', 'voice', 'King', 'Haggard', 'showed', 'up', 'recording', 'sessions', 'armed', 'own', 'copy', 'book', 'several', 'places', 'marked', 'indicate', 'things', 'must', 'not', 'opinion', 'be', 'omitted.All', 'voices', 'are', 'execllently', 'chosen', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Unicorn/Lady', 'Amalthea', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'wonderful', 'slightly', 'befuddled', 'sem-competent', 'wizard', 'Schmendrick', 'Christopher', 'perfect', 'sad', 'weary', 'reading', 'King', 'Haggard', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'absolutely', 'marvellous', 'Butterfly.This', 'story', 'inevitability', 'ending', 'things', 'immortality', 'mortality', 'heroism', 'villainy', 'love', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'regret', 'finding', 'loss.The', 'Unicorn', 'must', 'discover', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'what', 'be', 'unicorn', 'can', 'face', 'terrifying', 'Red', 'Bull', 'King', 'Haggard', 'son', 'Prince', 'Lir', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'must', 'become', 'hero', 'order', 'understand', 'things', 'have', 'destinies', 'destined', 'endings.And', 'Schmendrick', 'must', 'learn', 'even', 'wizard', 'more', 'merely', 'magic', 'be', 'whole', 'person', 'matter', 'how', 'fiercely', 'magic', 'whole', 'story', 'destinies', 'quests', 'fulfillments', 'quot', 'Heroes', 'know', 'things', 'must', 'happen', 'when', 'time', 'happen', 'quest', 'may', 'not', 'simply', 'be', 'abandoned', 'unicorns', 'may', 'go', 'unrescued', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'forever', 'happy', 'ending', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'middle', 'story', 'quot', 'Prince', 'Lir.Wonderful', 'sad', 'uplifting', 'just', 'little', 'just', 'enough', 'scary', 'romantic', 'funny', 'film', 'people', 'age', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'forgotten', 'magic', 'words', 'quot', 'Once', 'time', 'quot']",The Last Unicorn VHS

I had seen this movie years ago in the theatres, and later owened a VHS tape. I wanted to replace the very old tape with a good dvd recording.  I was not dissappointed with this one at all.  I would qualify this dvd as excellent. The picture quality is excellent, as is the color, which is lovely. The animation artwork is beautiful. The entire movie is here, nothing is cut out. The sound was fine.  Let me qualify this; the sound of the movie was fine.  But the singing voices of the characters in the film are terrible.  The makers really should have dubbed in the voices of professional singers when this movie was made, or even when the dvd was recorded.  The songs are good, and involve and move the story along, but the singing makes you want to reach for the mute button. The actors have good speaking voices, the dialog is clear and emotive, but they simply do not have anything resembling singing talent. They needed two actors for each character; one to do the talking, and one the singing. That would have made this a much better movie.

A classic quest tale comparable to Homer's ""Oddessy"" a unicorn searches for her lost kinfolk. Helping her along her way are Schmendrick, a poor man's Merlin and Molly Grue, a poor woman who still, knows a lot more of unicorns than the incompetent Schmendrick, who is described at one point as not being able to ""turn cream into cheese"". When his magic does work right, it's by sheer accident but when he allows his power to flow through him as it will he calls forth Robin Hood and his Merry Men, not forgetting Maid Marian. Of course at the end our heroes win out, Schmendrick finds his true magic, the Unicorn finds the others captured and imprisoned within the waves of the sea and the lost sense of magic and wonder is restored to the world at large.

Little do they know that one such creature is listening in on their conversation. Upon hearing that she is the last of the unicorns, she grows worried and lonely. When a butterfly flutters into her midst and confirms her fears, she risks her immortality by leaving her home and questing to find others of her species, and to discover the evil that is the mysterious ""Red Bull."" Along her way she is captured by an evil witch called Mommy Fortuna, who makes the unicorn a part of her traveling magic show.  But traveling with the old witch is a good-hearted, would-be wizard named Schmendrick who soon frees her. Together, they continue on the search for the lost unicorns. Joined by Molly Grue, a female member of a group of bandits, the heroes soon find the seaside castle of King Haggard who supposedly controls the Red Bull. After transforming the last unicorn into a beautiful young human girl they call Lady Amalthea in an effort to hide her identity from the Red Bull, the trio attempts to investigate the castle. Within, they discover an old king who is obsessed with finding true happiness by way of possession, and a young prince searching for true love. They take up residence at the castle and begin to learn the secrets of King Haggard, his Red Bull, and the missing unicorns, but Lady Amalthea is quickly forgetting her identity and her mission, and the young prince falls more in love with her each day. If the location of the missing unicorns isn't discovered in time and the Red Bull isn't defeated, Amalthea will be a human forever and unicorns will be gone from the world!The Last Unicorn is an American animated classic from the early 1980s. It features an all-star cast, haunting music, and animation from the renowned team of Rankin & Bass. The story is an original, emotional, and magical fairytale that speaks to all ages. However, this film is definitely not for everyone. It clearly finds its strongest fan-base among the Tolkien crowd. Fans of the Rankin/Bass Tolkien films will have the best idea of what to expect, though (if memory serves me) the animation is a tad better here. Rankin/Bass is famous for their marvelous Holiday offerings, however, stop-motion animation was always their strongpoint over the traditional style, so one shouldn't expect anything overwhelming as far as that goes. Still, some of the art and color is delightful, and the unicorn herself is quite lovely, especially as the beautiful Lady Amalthea. There are some moments when the story moves better than others, particularly during the first half, as the second half slows down quite a bit. Still, it's a satisfying watch for one who makes the effort to stick with it. The music and songs are dated, but rather haunting for probably that very reason, and the cast  is impressive, featuring such stars as Christopher Lee, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, and Jeff Bridges. The DVD is a bit disappointing, being bare bones and a pretty awful transfer, but at least the film IS available on DVD format. Overall, I'd have to say that everyone should watch it at least once to give it a fair try. In general, I prefer Disney to most other forms of animation, but it's always nice to throw something different into the broth and shake things up. The Last Unicorn is a solid piece of animated story-telling, especially compared to a lot of the other fluff that's out there.",3,An 80's Classic,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,3474,"['Hunters', 'traveling', 'beautiful', 'forest', 'grow', 'uneasy', 'when', 'one', 'talk', 'unicorns', 'magic', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'one', 'such', 'creature', 'listening', 'conversation', 'hearing', 'last', 'unicorns', 'worried', 'lonely', 'When', 'butterfly', 'flutters', 'midst', 'fears', 'immortality', 'leaving', 'home', 'questing', 'find', 'others', 'species', 'discover', 'evil', 'mysterious', 'Red', 'Bull', 'way', 'captured', 'evil', 'witch', 'called', 'Mommy', 'Fortuna', 'who', 'unicorn', 'part', 'traveling', 'magic', 'show', 'traveling', 'old', 'witch', 'good-hearted', 'would-be', 'wizard', 'named', 'Schmendrick', 'who', 'soon', 'Together', 'continue', 'search', 'lost', 'unicorns', 'Joined', 'Molly', 'Grue', 'female', 'member', 'group', 'bandits', 'heroes', 'soon', 'find', 'seaside', 'castle', 'King', 'Haggard', 'who', 'supposedly', 'Red', 'Bull', 'transforming', 'last', 'unicorn', 'beautiful', 'young', 'human', 'girl', 'call', 'Lady', 'Amalthea', 'effort', 'hide', 'identity', 'Red', 'Bull', 'trio', 'attempts', 'investigate', 'castle', 'Within', 'discover', 'old', 'king', 'who', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'true', 'happiness', 'way', 'possession', 'young', 'prince', 'searching', 'true', 'love', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'castle', 'begin', 'learn', 'secrets', 'King', 'Haggard', 'Red', 'Bull', 'missing', 'unicorns', 'Lady', 'Amalthea', 'quickly', 'forgetting', 'identity', 'mission', 'young', 'prince', 'more', 'love', 'day', 'location', 'missing', 'unicorns', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'time', 'Red', 'Bull', ""n't"", 'defeated', 'Amalthea', 'will', 'be', 'human', 'forever', 'unicorns', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'world', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'American', 'animated', 'classic', 'early', '1980s', 'all-star', 'cast', 'haunting', 'music', 'animation', 'renowned', 'team', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'story', 'original', 'emotional', 'magical', 'fairytale', 'ages', 'However', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'clearly', 'strongest', 'fan-base', 'Tolkien', 'crowd', 'Fans', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Tolkien', 'films', 'will', 'have', 'best', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'memory', 'serves', 'animation', 'tad', 'better', 'here', 'Rankin/Bass', 'famous', 'marvelous', 'Holiday', 'offerings', 'however', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'was', 'always', 'strongpoint', 'traditional', 'style', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'overwhelming', 'as', 'far', 'Still', 'art', 'color', 'delightful', 'unicorn', 'herself', 'quite', 'lovely', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'Lady', 'Amalthea', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'story', 'better', 'others', 'particularly', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'Still', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'one', 'who', 'effort', 'stick', 'music', 'songs', 'are', 'dated', 'rather', 'haunting', 'probably', 'very', 'reason', 'cast', 'impressive', 'featuring', 'such', 'stars', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'DVD', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'being', 'bare', 'bones', 'pretty', 'awful', 'transfer', 'least', 'film', 'IS', 'available', 'DVD', 'format', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'give', 'fair', 'try', 'general', 'prefer', 'Disney', 'most', 'other', 'forms', 'animation', 'always', 'nice', 'throw', 'something', 'different', 'broth', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'solid', 'piece', 'animated', 'story-telling', 'especially', 'compared', 'lot', 'other', 'fluff', 'out', 'there']",The Last Unicorn VHS

I took it out of its shiny new wrapper today, fresh from a big box store (because that was the only place I've seen it), popped it into the player, and saw my whole life just destroyed.  Ok, so maybe I'm being dramatic, but why'd they have to change a good thing?Ok, I don't normally do this, but I have to talk about this particular edition of The Last Unicorn before I actually review the movie itself.  This is the 25th Anniversary Edition that I watched.  Numerous scenes were cut out, they edited out the curse words (of which there were not many), and the sound quality was different.  It didn't have as much depth and all the tones were higher.  It just wasn't the same and I'm going to be seeking out some way to get the original and getting rid of the crap copy I have now.  And I just looked up about the audio, turns out I'm not crazy, the movie evidently plays faster than the original version which results in the higher voices.So let's talk about the movie itself, the original as I remember it.  And we'll just pretend this particular copy I watched today was the whole thing.  The Last Unicorn is about the last unicorn in the world.  She is happily living in her forest not realizing she is the last until she overhears some people talking.  Which makes her think she needs to find out what happened to the rest of the Unicorns.  And so begins an adventure that is filled with harrowing encounters, a prince, an evil King, and many other wonderful and creepy things.Characters:Mia Farrow: UnicornAlan Arkin: Schmendrick the MagicianJeff Bridges: Prince LirTammy Grimes: Molly GrueRobert Klein: ButterflyAngela Lansbury: Mommy FortunaChristopher Lee: King HaggardSince these are voice actors I can't say that they were exceptional or dreadful.  They just voice the characters and you don't think much about them.  But the characters themselves are wonderfully created.  The Unicorn is distant but lovable, and she evolves over the movie.  Schmendrick is funny but good hearted and although it's hard to see him struggle sometimes, he genuinely wants to do the best he can.  And Molly Grue, she's always been my favorite.  Sure, she's a little flighty but I think she's the heart of the whole film, even if she doesn't play a large part.Most fantasy films are about a quest.  This one is no different.  The characters are all looking for something.  And there are of course bad guys to get in the way.  But this is so charming and the characters unique, that it feels new.  And I'm not just saying that because of the nostalgia it fills me with.  I've always loved this movie.  And I think it's because it appeals to audiences of all ages.  You see rage, anger, and anguish; which are not commonly seen in animated movies much (outside of anime that is).  But there's also hope and the drive to do good.  Lots of good lessons all packed into a colorful package.Most people will say that the audio and animation isn't that great in the movie.  They'd probably be right to a point.  But it was made in the 80's, so I think it was pretty well done for that time.  I liked the music and the custom made songs and they even pop into my head at random times.  And I can remember nearly every word.  I can't even do that with some of the Disney movies.  The Unicorn is beautifully drawn and I loved the way all the animals were animated.  They were definitely cartoons, but they were elegant cartoons.This is a wonderful movie, provided you get the right edition.  It's one that deserves a permanent place on the shelf and can be watched over and over again.Review by M.

Mia Farrow is outstanding as the voice of the unicorn who experiences what it is like to be human. Jeff Bridges, as her human suitor, is his usual reliable self. He also doesn't do a bad vocal in his duet with Farrow's unicorn. Adam Arkin is good as a slightly ""off-centered"" butterfly!The ""bad"" guys in the form of King Haggard and Mommy Fortuna are performed by the always fantastic Christopher Lee and Angela Lansbury, respectively. Their years on the screen and stage are used most effectively in their interpretation of the characters.The animation, though not up to Disney standards, does have its moments. The escape of the harpy eagle from her cage is truly a frightening scene. The emergence of the Red Bull and its assault on the unicorn is a nail-biter. And the release of the trapped unicorns at the film's end is stunning.The songs, many performed by rock group America and penned by Jimmy Webb, will not last in the memory, but are still enjoyable within the context of the film.This is a good family film, but I would not recommend it for the under-7 set.

You wake up one morning to the tautological agenda of what has become your everyday routine.  As you whiff  the caffeinated brew of your first cup of coffee, it occurs to you that  life is not as it should be.  In the course of doing what's expected of us,  you find that little time is left for the imagination; our transcendental  self is muted and our creativity suffers.  As such, we become averse to  trying new things or augmenting our individuality and instead adhere to  what is familiar.  How do we resolve this predicament?  It is done by  relearning what was forgotten...that sense of adventure we had when we were  children.  The mature person cannot nurture without an active imagination  or appreciation for fantasy; likewise the constant dreamer is lost without  a sense of reality.  Only in happy unison, a perfect balance if you will,  do we fully benefit from each: intellectualism and mysticism.  Peter S.  Beagle's &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; is the perfect allegory for such a  principle...well, okay, that and also it's just a great story.The plot is  simple enough.  A lone unicorn (voiced by Mia Farrow) is in search of  others of its kind, and along the way she discovers that a crusty old king  had his demonic creature - the Red Bull - drive them into the sea for his  own selfish purposes.  A wizard transforms her into a woman, and in  becoming mortal she accrues mortal feelings, including love and regret.  These feelings become her ally in defeating the Red Bull and releasing her  fellow unicorns.  Why else was she not driven into the sea like the others?  It's because she was armored with both human and mystic qualities.  As  such, we ourselves become stronger when we harbor a blend of rationalism  and sensationalism, and know when to use each...to do so, we can conquer our  own &quot;Red Bulls.&quot;  Captain Cully and his entourage were the  opposite of the unicorn; they did not possess the open minds needed to  accept and utilize mysticism: &quot;Robin Hood is a myth!  It is we who are  the reality!&quot;  And were they not an unhappy lot!  Beagle warns against  falling victim to this unhealthy mindset...it's his linchpin.The film  itself holds true to the book, largely because Beagle contributed to the  screenplay.  Christopher Lee, who plays King Haggard, has some of the best  lines and he delivers them perfectly.  Other cast members also turn in  strong performances (with the exception of Jeff Bridges, although he was  not given the opportunity to develop his character sufficiently), and the  Japanese animation style (anime) is a refreshing switch from Disney.  The  music, which often is criticized as mawkish and jejune, I found to be quite  pleasant and complementary to the film.  The one exception was Farrow's  butchering of the song &quot;Now That I'm A Woman,&quot; which almost  brings the movie to a screeching halt.Art enthusiasts will be pleased to  note that one of the famous Unicorn Tapestries  (kept at the Metropolitan  Museum of Art in New York) is the backdrop to the movie's opening credit  sequence.",4,Why is a Raven like a Writing Desk...?,963014400,"07 8, 2000",2000,3193,"['Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'wrote', 'badum-ching', 'seriously', 'folks', 'Suppose', 'had', 'revelation', 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'tautological', 'agenda', 'what', 'become', 'everyday', 'routine', 'whiff', 'caffeinated', 'brew', 'first', 'cup', 'coffee', 'life', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'course', 'doing', 'what', 'expected', 'find', 'little', 'time', 'left', 'imagination', 'transcendental', 'self', 'muted', 'creativity', 'suffers', 'such', 'become', 'averse', 'trying', 'new', 'things', 'augmenting', 'individuality', 'instead', 'adhere', 'what', 'familiar', 'How', 'do', 'resolve', 'predicament', 'done', 'relearning', 'what', 'was', 'forgotten', 'sense', 'adventure', 'had', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'mature', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'nurture', 'active', 'imagination', 'appreciation', 'fantasy', 'constant', 'dreamer', 'lost', 'sense', 'reality', 'Only', 'happy', 'unison', 'perfect', 'balance', 'will', 'do', 'fully', 'benefit', 'intellectualism', 'mysticism', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Beagle', 'quot', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'quot', 'perfect', 'allegory', 'principle', 'well', 'okay', 'also', 'just', 'great', 'story.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'A', 'lone', 'unicorn', 'voiced', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'search', 'others', 'kind', 'way', 'crusty', 'old', 'king', 'had', 'demonic', 'creature', 'Red', 'Bull', 'drive', 'sea', 'own', 'selfish', 'purposes', 'wizard', 'woman', 'becoming', 'mortal', 'mortal', 'feelings', 'including', 'love', 'regret', 'feelings', 'become', 'ally', 'defeating', 'Red', 'Bull', 'releasing', 'fellow', 'unicorns', 'Why', 'else', 'was', 'not', 'driven', 'sea', 'others', 'was', 'armored', 'human', 'mystic', 'qualities', 'such', 'ourselves', 'become', 'stronger', 'when', 'harbor', 'blend', 'rationalism', 'sensationalism', 'know', 'when', 'use', 'do', 'so', 'can', 'conquer', 'own', 'quot', 'Red', 'Bulls.', 'quot', 'Captain', 'Cully', 'entourage', 'were', 'opposite', 'unicorn', 'did', 'not', 'possess', 'open', 'minds', 'needed', 'accept', 'utilize', 'mysticism', 'quot', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'myth', 'who', 'are', 'reality', 'quot', 'were', 'not', 'unhappy', 'lot', 'Beagle', 'falling', 'victim', 'unhealthy', 'mindset', 'linchpin.The', 'film', 'true', 'book', 'largely', 'Beagle', 'contributed', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'who', 'King', 'Haggard', 'best', 'lines', 'perfectly', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'also', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'exception', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'opportunity', 'develop', 'character', 'sufficiently', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'style', 'anime', 'refreshing', 'switch', 'Disney', 'music', 'often', 'criticized', 'mawkish', 'jejune', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'complementary', 'film', 'one', 'exception', 'was', 'Farrow', 'butchering', 'song', 'quot', 'Now', ""'m"", 'Woman', 'quot', 'almost', 'movie', 'screeching', 'halt.Art', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'note', 'one', 'famous', 'Unicorn', 'Tapestries', 'kept', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'Art', 'New', 'York', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence']",The Last Unicorn VHS

352993,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,6303047564,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[0, 1]","The Last Unicorn, released in 1982, was drawn from the novel by Peter S. Beagle. I believe considerable license was taken. This movie I saw as a little boy in the 80's long before DVD when there was only VHS. VHS. What's that some younger kids would say today. At the time, made this movie very life-like and a bit scary, especially the scenes of the Red Bull. This animated movie uses early techniques of Japanese anime as Japanese animators had to do with the making of the film. It's a fantasy epic with an easy to follow plot but a bit slowed down by musical sequences- the Butterfly with the Elton John glasses and even Mia Farrow gets to sing although her singing voice is not going to win a Grammy.Mia Farrow stars as the voice of the Unicorn. She starts off on a quest to find out what happened to the other unicorns since she has been told she is the last unicorn. On her way, she encounters a witch (played by Angela Landsbury in a performance far from Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast) who showcases her in a traveling circus show. She pairs up with the amateur wizard Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) and aging village woman Molly on a discovery trip further into the magical land. The truth is finally revealed when the hellish Red Bull tries to take the Unicorn away. The unicorn is temporarily transformed into the Princess Amalthea. Prince Lear (Jeff Bridges) falls in love with her, much to the disapproval of his father the old and dismal King Haggard (played superbly by Christopher Lee of the Dracula films and the recent Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones). King Haggard has employed the services of The Red Bull who drove the unicorns into the sea, just to please the old king. I don't think this is motive enough and this is where the story lacked substance for me. What kind of a silly king would want to see unicorns in the sea ? The story has a happy ending and the unicorns are rescued and brought back to land.

352998,A22PMIUQWH2YPA,6303047564,Southpaw,"[3, 3]","I first watched The last Unicorn when I was a child in the early/mid 90s. I am now an adult and it still remains to be my all-time favorite animated movie (with The little Mermaid by Hans Christensen and The Swan Princess coming in as a close second). I watched it many times on my old VHS tape, and it always left me feeling spellbound. When my VHS tape broke, I was heart-broken. So when it came out on DVD, I was extremely delighted! I am a huge kid at heart, and have watched many animated movies throughout my life, but none had the same indelible effect as The Last Unicorn. It stood the test of time for a reason.This is a heart-rending, beautiful story about an ethereal unicorn who thinks she's the last of her kind when she overhears two hunters talking in an enchanted forest. She embarks on a quest to find the other unicorns, because surely she can't be the last. The unicorn takes you through her unforgettable journey where she learns about friendship, loss, love, and regret. This movie truly tugs on your heartstrings, which is why it is a classic. The storyline, musical score, and the voice acting are nothing short of stupendous. The soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking and America's memorable music coheres with the exquisitely plotted story. Plus, I cannot possibly envision anyone but Mia Farrow as the Unicorn and Jeff Bridges as prince Lir. If you haven't watched this wonderful fantasy, then please watch it! It will capture your heart, young or old, and never let go...When I watched it as a child, I got scared by Momma Fortuna and I couldn't understand the meaning of regret... but as I grew older, I understood. Please don't write this wonderful fantasy off as an animation geared toward children. It appeals to adults. It's not by any means Disney-esque; the story is bittersweet and multi-layered. I suggest watching it with your child because as I've previously said, there are some scenes that might scare them. With that being said, This is a must-see and a must-own by the fans or anyone who wants to become enthralled by a magnificent, beautifully-layered story.

353001,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6303047564,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[39, 40]","For those of you not in the know The Last Unicorn is a really nice fantasy movie based on the popular book by Peter Beagle. As the name implies it's about unicorn who found out she is the last of her kind and sets out to uncover the truth behind that. She soon finds out all of the other unicorns have been captured by a mythical creature, and with the help of an inept magician and a surly maiden they seek out to bring the unicorns back from captivity.The story is among the best in fairy tale fiction. You have a fair number of mystical creatures and learn interesting tidbits about them throughout the film. You also have a romantic aspect between a prince and maiden (which is required for many who love fairy tales), sword slinging action, wondrous magic, singing (we'll get to that later), and comedy all done up by the voice talents of A-list actors like Allen Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine, Edward Scissorhands), Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby, Hannah and her Sisters), Christopher Lee (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars prequels), Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Tron movies), Angela Landsbury (Beauty and the Beast, Murder She Wrote), and a slew of other notable talents.The action scenes are exciting and directing does well with the movement and colors in these scenes. The scenes that involve the romance feel real with characters hitting home the type of emotions a young love can feel. The fun scenes are really fun, but it's more dialog kind of funny. Lots of good one liners come from the script. Not so much in the realm of visual comedy unless you count the scene with the laughing skeleton and maybe one scene with a talking cat. The villain (done by Lee) is pitch perfect in execution as both a bad man and a flawed human being. The voice acting feels just as perfect with maybe an exception to Arkin's Schmendrick, whose lines sometimes feel a little wooden.The animation is done by the Rankin/Bass team. They are more known for their stop motion holiday specials. However they also have a respectable cartoon portfolio with tv shows like the Thundercats and movies like The Flight of Dragons, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and The Wind and the Willows. The animation is much like their other feature films with the same distinctive look and feel. It actually fits well with this movie. The frame rate isn't on the same rotoscoped level as some Disney classics, but it's not anywhere near as distracting as some Saturday morning cartoons made back then.Now this being a fairy tale, and much like what Disney made the standard for these types of films, there is a singing interlude in the film. Now this is a duet from actors Jeff Bridges and Mia Farrow, and well... they aren't singers. You can hear the strain from the voices. Originally the plan was to have Katie Irving sing Mia's part, but apparently that never happened in the final theatrical release. If you're a big fan of musical numbers this won't impress you. Now as to the rest of the music like the title theme and about all of the montages have songs from the band America, and they are really good, original songs. I recommend getting the soundtrack if you are a fan of this band.Now previous video releases of this film had various levels of criticism tied to them for various reasons. The original DVD release was a poor transfer with no special features. The 25th Anniversary Edition had a much better transfer and had extra features, but was an edited version; taking out the occasional PG swear words the film had and even speeding up the film slightly (which made everybody talk in a bit higher pitch). Another bad thing about the 25th Anniversary edition was Beagle didn't get any royalties on the release. Now the Blu-Ray edition coming out should address a number of issues:1 - Peter Beagle himself has been expressing a lot of enthusiasm for this release, but unfortunately he's still not in the loop for royalties. If you want Peter to get a fair share please get your copy at the Conlan Press website. They are also selling Blu-Rays signed by Beagle himself.2 - Beagle announced that both the censored 25th Anniversary version and the original uncensored theatrical version will be on the Blu-Ray. Unfortunately the DVD is really just the 25th Anniversary edition so no it's going to have the same issues.3 - When Beagle saw the Blu-Ray he was blown away with what he saw. Does that mean a true high definition treatment? Sounds like it.Not a whole lot of definite answers to some pressing questions, but since it's all coming from the man himself I find it encouraging. The Last Unicorn will be presenting in full high definition 1080p with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for both the censored and uncensored English audio. This combo pack will have the following bonus features, some of which are exclusive to this release:Audio commentary by Peter Beagle and publisher Connor Cochran - YES!!! Finally a commentary from Beagle.The Tail of the Last Unicorn - Basically a short retrospective from Beagle.Making-of The Last Unicorn - A brand new documentary on the making of the movie.Escape the Red Bull - Pretty much a kid's game made for DVD.Schmendrick's Magical Gallery - Production stills of the movie. This is a bid expansion from the previous DVD version with more stills than ever before.Art Contest Gallery - Brand new extra. I think this will be entries from the 2010 Last Unicorn art contest. Beagle selected the winners himself.Original Theatrical TrailerSo far from what I am hearing this is the release to get excited about. It fixes much of the problems the previous releases had and gives us the extras we deserved to get from the get go. If you love fairy tale fantasy you owe it to yourself to see this film. Any current fan of the film should go ahead and consider taking that double or triple dip for this edition.",4,Blu-Ray should be the best version yet,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,5825,"['not',

It is sad that some studios just don't care about the discs they release. I'm sure the folks who put out this disc saw this as just some dumb ""children's cartoon"" and saw no reason to do anything special for the release. There are no special features of ANY KIND. No photos. No trailers. No commentary. NOTHING. But that could've been overlooked had the film been given a nice presentation. But they failed even there. The film is not anamorphic widescreen but a poor full screen transfer which is a major disappointment.And yet, the film is still a magical experience not to be missed. This is a marvelous film. It is beautifully animated, written (by Peter S. Beagle based on his novel) and acted by an all-star cast of fine vocal talent (Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin, Christopher Lee, Angela Lans bury, Jeff Bridges, Tammy Grimes and more). Mention, too, must be made of the beautiful songs written by Jimmy Webb and sung by the group America (""Horse With No Name"", ""Tin Man"", ""Sister Golden Hair""). They perfectly complement the mood of the story.So, in spite of the frankly poor presentation of this dvd, I did enjoy the film because the film is so good it can survive even a botched job like this one.

Everything from the music, the animation, the story is absolutely spectacular.I have not seen the previous DVD, so I cannot comment on its transfer, but from what I have heard, this DVD is light years ahead of the previous one, with a remastered widescreen video and a remastered 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track. The occasional scratch, dirt, and other film issue pops up, but for the most part, this transfer is crisp, clear, and vibrant.However, I am saddened to hear of language being censored. Since I've never seen the movie until today, I didn't notice it, but it's still a shame. I know it was done because parents complained, but they could have included two audio tracks - one censored, one uncensored. That way, everyone could choose. Also, people have complained about the 4% speedup because of the usage of the master used in the German PAL DVD release. Again, I've not noticed the difference because this is my first viewing.What I KNOW I'm disappointed with is the lack of bonus materials. This is supposed to be a special 25th Anniversary Edition, so why are we given a lousy single-layer DVD disc (DVD-5, 4.7 GB) with nothing but a short fluffy 8-minute making-of featurette that leaves you craving more, a trailer, and a dumb trivia game? At least a more extensive making-of documentary would have been nice. Maybe including the soundtrack CD with it as well, since the only way to get it is through a German import CD.For fans of the film, or people who just love fantasy, I can't recommend this DVD enough.

For some reason many of the 2004 reviews have stated that the quality is bad. This is inaccurate when comparing the DVD's picture quality to the trailer feature of the disc and the original VHS. This dvd has been played on a 2009 Xbox 360.The only audio-availability on this dvd verison is dolby 2.0 and 5.0. The subtitles are for spanish and english, but the audio output is in english only.As for features there is not much to offer. There is an interview of the author concerning the making of the book, the ""lost chapters"" of how the book truly started and a boring game of the red bull.Some reviews have been about censorship of the movie, or in other words ""edited"". The movie from the television version has not been edited from its origin (as far as television re-runs go) and infact yes, there is one swear word. When the hunchback henchman is talking to Fortuna in front of the harpy cage he says "" I don't care how many damn spells you got on her, get rid of that harpy!""There are no deleted scenes or plot-breaking edits that would truly affect the entire quality of the original story-line itself. The impact of these edits aren't very important for a couple of word changes like ""hell"" or whatnot as there was little offensive words to began with. As an example of a ""stripped"" movie, try Once Upon a Time which was suppose to be the original Windaria. Now that's a censored version. As for TLU the harpy is still as ugly, naked and vicious as it was in the original.This is a good dvd to get if you want the movie itself, however it is lacking in the ""goodie"" department as far as concerning special features.",4,Good Animated Quality,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,2040,"['Last', 'Unicorn', 'had', 're-runed', 'several', 'channels', 'including', 'Disney', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'Nothing', 'much', 'changed', 'other', 'quality', 'videotape.The', 'quality', 'videotape', 'grade', 'up', 'compared', 'VHS', 'television', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'grainy', 'pictures', 'are', 'clear', 'crisp', 'nice', 'added', 'touch', 'yet', 'true', 'quality', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'reason', 'many', '2004', 'reviews', 'have', 'stated', 'quality', 'bad', 'inaccurate', 'when', 'comparing', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'trailer', 'feature', 'disc', 'original', 'VHS', 'dvd', 'been', 'played', '2009', 'Xbox', '360.The', 'only', 'audio-availability', 'dvd', 'verison', 'dolby', '2.0', '5.0', 'subtitles', 'are', 'spanish', 'english', 'audio', 'output', 'english', 'only.As', 'features', 'not', 'much', 'offer', 'interview', 'author', 'concerning', 'making', 'book', 'lost', 'chapters', 'how', 'book', 'truly', 'started', 'boring', 'game', 'red', 'bull.Some', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'censorship', 'movie', 'other', 'words', 'edited', 'movie', 'television', 'version', 'not', 'been', 'edited', 'origin', 'as', 'far', 'television', 're-runs', 'go', 'infact', 'yes', 'one', 'swear', 'word', 'When', 'hunchback', 'henchman', 'talking', 'Fortuna', 'front', 'harpy', 'cage', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'many', 'damn', 'spells', 'got', 'get', 'rid', 'harpy', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'plot-breaking', 'edits', 'would', 'truly', 'affect', 'entire', 'quality', 'original', 'story-line', 'impact', 'edits', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'important', 'couple', 'word', 'changes', 'hell', 'whatnot', 'was', 'little', 'offensive', 'words', 'began', 'example', 'stripped', 'movie', 'try', 'Once', 'Time', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'original', 'Windaria', 'Now', 'censored', 'version', 'TLU', 'harpy', 'still', 'ugly', 'naked', 'vicious', 'was', 'original.This', 'good', 'dvd', 'get', 'want', 'movie', 'however', 'lacking', 'goodie', 'department', 'as', 'far', 'concerning', 'special', 'features']",The Last Unicorn VHS

I watched this a long time ago, and remember loving the story, and today I was finally able to share it with my 5-year-old daughter. In the screen adaptation (the screenplay was also written by Peter S. Beagle), Mia Farrow plays the Last Unicorn who inadvertently learns that she is the last of her kind. Curious to discover the fate that has befallen the rest of the unicorns, the last unicorn learns from a Butterfly (Robert Klein) that an entity known as the Red Bull has herded the unicorns to the ends of the earth. Unfortunately, she finds herself captured by the witch Mommy Fortuna (Angela Lansbury)as part of the witch's Midnight Carnival. The unicorn is able to escape with the help of a novice magician Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) and proceeds to the seaside castle of King Haggard (Christopher Lee) and meets the dreaded Red Bull, a fire elemental, but is once again saved by Schmendrick when she is transformed by his magic into a mortal woman, Lady Amalthea. Here is where Amalthea's/the last unicorn's quest gets really interesting and complicated, for it is at the castle of King Haggard that Amalthea meets and eventually falls in love with Haggard's adopted son, Prince Lir (Jeff Bridges).The rest of this magical story explores what happens to Amalthea and Lir, will their mortal love survive the revelation of Amalthea's true identity, and will Amalthea fulfill her real quest to find the rest of the unicorns, and defeat the evil Red Bull? The story itself is magical, but what makes it compelling are the various themes explored, regarding friendship, self-discovery, faith, courage, love, and mortality. The anime (Japanese animation) is beautiful, and I will always consider this a classic. The songs are also melodious and meaningful. Highly recommended, though I would advise caution for the under-5s since there are some scary depictions in this movie.",5,"""The Last Unicorn"" - an enduring classic",1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,1986,"['4.5*', 'love', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Beagle', 'works', 'especially', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'Tamsin', 'Fine', 'Private', 'Place', 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'remember', 'loving', 'story', 'today', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'share', '5-year-old', 'daughter', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'screenplay', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Beagle', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'last', 'kind', 'Curious', 'discover', 'fate', 'befallen', 'rest', 'unicorns', 'last', 'unicorn', 'learns', 'Butterfly', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'entity', 'known', 'Red', 'Bull', 'herded', 'unicorns', 'ends', 'earth', 'Unfortunately', 'captured', 'witch', 'Mommy', 'Fortuna', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'part', 'witch', 'Midnight', 'Carnival', 'unicorn', 'able', 'escape', 'help', 'novice', 'magician', 'Schmendrick', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'proceeds', 'seaside', 'castle', 'King', 'Haggard', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'dreaded', 'Red', 'Bull', 'fire', 'elemental', 'once', 'again', 'saved', 'Schmendrick', 'when', 'transformed', 'magic', 'mortal', 'woman', 'Lady', 'Amalthea', 'Here', 'where', ""Amalthea's/the"", 'last', 'unicorn', 'quest', 'really', 'interesting', 'complicated', 'castle', 'King', 'Haggard', 'Amalthea', 'meets', 'eventually', 'love', 'Haggard', 'adopted', 'son', 'Prince', 'Lir', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', '.The', 'rest', 'magical', 'story', 'what', 'Amalthea', 'Lir', 'will', 'mortal', 'love', 'survive', 'revelation', 'Amalthea', 'true', 'identity', 'will', 'Amalthea', 'fulfill', 'real', 'quest', 'find', 'rest', 'unicorns', 'defeat', 'evil', 'Red', 'Bull', 'story', 'magical', 'what', 'compelling', 'are', 'various', 'themes', 'explored', 'regarding', 'friendship', 'self-discovery', 'faith', 'courage', 'love', 'mortality', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'will', 'always', 'consider', 'classic', 'songs', 'are', 'also', 'melodious', 'meaningful', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'would', 'advise', 'caution', 'under-5s', 'are', 'scary', 'depictions', 'movie']",The Last Unicorn VHS
