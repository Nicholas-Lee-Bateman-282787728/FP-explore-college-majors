On the Shout Factory website season 3 is only $29.99 so hopefully Amazon will match their price. All Fantasy Island fans should be emailing Shout Factory to thank them for bringing this series back after Sony made us wait 7 years after releasing season 1. We should also be encouraging Shout Factory to release the remaining seasons 4-7. If they know that there is a market for this then they will release them as they now own the rights.

It is episode # 7 which is titled &#34;The Wedding&#34;, that the series hits a grand slam home run.  This episode, which is a rare single guest episode, is a sequel to the Season Two episode # 8 titled &#34;The Return&#34;.  This episode # 7 was definitely the best episode of Season Three and one of the best of the entire series.  The episode begins with Mr. Roarke greeting Helena Marsh, who is his great love and has returned to Fantasy Island to marry Mr. Roarke.  Helena Marsh is played by the beautiful Samantha Eggar.  This episode moves &#34;Fantasy Island &#34; from farcical to serious entertainment in one giant step with this sensitive and sad story.  As the wedding preparations begin, we find that Helena is dying and after she marries Mr. Roarke, they move to their special part of the island for the remaining days of her life.  At very near the end of the episode, Helena dies touchingly in Mr. Roarke's arms and the episode also ends touchingly with Helena's funeral which is full of the love they felt for her.  The performances by both Samantha Eggar and Ricardo Montalban were superb and sensitive and the episode was well written.This episode # 7 by itself makes this DVD set worth the selling price, and there are many more good episodes in the set.  I very strongly recommend this DVD set for those who love great entertainment.",5,Fantasy Island  Season Three; is truly fantastic after a slow start.,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,1487,"['Fantasy', 'Island', 'Season', 'Three', 'begin', 'slow', 'fashion', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'however', 'episode', '6', 'things', 'begin', 'improve', 'episode', '7', 'titled', '34', 'Wedding', '34', 'series', 'grand', 'slam', 'home', 'run', 'episode', 'rare', 'single', 'guest', 'episode', 'sequel', 'Season', 'Two', 'episode', '8', 'titled', '34', 'Return', '34', 'episode', '7', 'was', 'definitely', 'best', 'episode', 'Season', 'Three', 'one', 'best', 'entire', 'series', 'episode', 'Mr.', 'Roarke', 'greeting', 'Helena', 'Marsh', 'who', 'great', 'love', 'returned', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'marry', 'Mr.', 'Roarke', 'Helena', 'Marsh', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'episode', '34', 'Fantasy', 'Island', '34', 'farcical', 'serious', 'entertainment', 'one', 'giant', 'step', 'sensitive', 'sad', 'story', 'wedding', 'preparations', 'begin', 'find', 'Helena', 'dying', 'Mr.', 'Roarke', 'move', 'special', 'part', 'island', 'remaining', 'days', 'life', 'very', 'end', 'episode', 'Helena', 'touchingly', 'Mr.', 'Roarke', 'arms', 'episode', 'also', 'touchingly', 'Helena', 'funeral', 'full', 'love', 'felt', 'performances', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'were', 'superb', 'sensitive', 'episode', 'was', 'well', 'written.This', 'episode', '7', 'DVD', 'set', 'selling', 'price', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'good', 'episodes', 'set', 'very', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'who', 'love', 'great', 'entertainment']",Fantasy Island: Season 3

The 7th show is perhaps the grandest episode of the first three seasons: ""The Wedding"" (5+); it is a followup of Season 2's ""Return"" episode.  The woman, whom Roarke fell in love with, returns to marry him.  Gorgeous scenery, beautiful lilting music, and tear-producing emotional tugs. . . .Many Fantasy Island shows open with some silly sub-story about the diminutive Tattoo.  By season 3, the writers ran out of ideas.  By the 8th show, these were dropped, with the exception of the 12th show where Tattoo has disguised himself as a fire hydrant. . . .Many stories have a touch of magic.  As a guest, Mr. Roarke may provide you with a magic potion to rewind your years, to slough off your pounds, to unleash your alter ego, to restore your eyesight, or to instill you with telekinetic power.  Or, perhaps, he may send you back to 1918 to be a flying ace, to the 1860's to romance your ""Gone With the Wind"" heartthrobs, to the first century BC to romance Mark Antony as Cleopatra, or to an era of manly cavemen.  Or, perhaps, he may provide you with a magic ring: its crystal foretells your future.  Or, perhaps, he may arrange an encounter with a mythical mermaid or a love goddess.  Or, perhaps, he may help you prevent an ancient evil spirit from taking possession of your body, or help you conquer your alter ego possessed dummy by instilling life in it so that you can confront it directly and banish it forever.  Or, perhaps, he may just help you crossover to the ethereal other side. . . .Picture (DVD 2012): 3.5 to 4.

I don't know how long it ran but I want it all, as individual seasons (I canot usually afford ""complete series"" sets, I have to pace my ""luxury"" or ""entertainment"" expenditures so a season at a time if great for me.  I am also happy it is not half a season because as much as I love a show, if I feel I am being purposely ripped off, I am less likely to buy them until someone sells it second hand or it goes on sale for half price. You can only squeeze me so much, and for most of us, the squueze is already happening in life necessities like food and gas and income so not being ripped off by hald a season is fabulous -not to mention the space taken up my a full season is the same as a half season and nobody wants more STUFF taking up more space than necessary.The great thing about these old shows is they are mostly ""family friendly"" and cross-generational. Before Grandma passed, she would watch my Love Boat DVD's with my mom late at night when visiting, my sister and I watch the old shows because they have great memories, and my nieces are getting old enough to love them and don't even think they are cheesy.
