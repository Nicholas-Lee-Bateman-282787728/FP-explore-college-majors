1317256,A1HIUPFGUACP7Q,B0031OSZXG,"B. Springer ""bookish""","[0, 0]","I very much enjoyed watching this DVD, but wasn't as successful at following the moves myself.  I am sure they are easy enough for those who are actually somewhat graceful, and who don't have knees that don't take well to jumping and bouncing. I would try it again if I had a larger space in which to exercise.  In my living room, if my knees didn't blow out on me when I asked them to bounce, I'd run into a piece of furniture and hurt myself.  That's not the good kind of exercise burn we're going for!  In general, I love Tracy Anderson's method.",2,Works for the Graceful Among us,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,549,"['very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'successful', 'following', 'moves', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'easy', 'enough', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'graceful', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'knees', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'well', 'jumping', 'bouncing', 'would', 'try', 'again', 'had', 'larger', 'space', 'exercise', 'living', 'room', 'knees', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'out', 'when', 'asked', 'bounce', ""'d"", 'run', 'piece', 'furniture', 'hurt', 'not', 'good', 'kind', 'exercise', 'burn', ""'re"", 'going', 'general', 'love', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'method']",N/A
1317257,A23MY7R9O3A2YQ,B0031OSZXG,Mom of boys....,"[4, 6]","I love Tracy's stuff, but this DVD was just not for me.  Lots of bouncing.  I prefer step or regular aerobics, not dance aerobics, I guess.  I didn't like the format of this DVD, either.  You have to keep going back to the main menu to play each section, you couldn't set it to just keep running through the whole thing (unless I'm missing something, but I tried everything), which was a major pain in the butt.  I didn't really see how this was any different than other aerobic DVD's, as far as fitting into Tracy's ""Method"", either.  Overall, an ok workout, but nothing to write home about, in my opinion.",3,Just not for me.,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,607,"['love', 'Tracy', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'Lots', 'bouncing', 'prefer', 'step', 'regular', 'aerobics', 'not', 'dance', 'aerobics', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'format', 'DVD', 'either', 'have', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'play', 'section', 'could', ""n't"", 'set', 'just', 'keep', 'running', 'whole', 'thing', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'tried', 'everything', 'was', 'major', 'pain', 'butt', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'aerobic', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'fitting', 'Tracy', 'Method', 'Overall', 'ok', 'workout', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'opinion']",N/A

I like the variety of the dances and I like that you can stop at the end of any dance segment.  Tracy normally doesn't talk in her dance cardio so it is different with her actually giving you some instruction  and it will take some time to get all of the steps, but it is doable.",3,Tracy and her Gang,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,401,"['like', 'dance', 'video', 'pausing', 'dances', 'order', 'everyone', 'introduce', 'own', 'dance', 'variety', 'dances', 'like', 'can', 'stop', 'end', 'dance', 'segment', 'Tracy', 'normally', ""n't"", 'talk', 'dance', 'cardio', 'different', 'actually', 'giving', 'instruction', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'steps', 'doable']",N/A
1317259,A16HOB9S21O6PW,B0031OSZXG,S. Rutigliano,"[4, 6]",I am in love with this DVD. This video is about 30 mins. It is SUPER beginner. But I mean that in comparrison to her other work. If you can't dance you will struggle with this dvd. It is super fun. It has her and 3 of her master trainers. Each of them take turns teaching you a dance. It takes place in a white dance studio and has techno music playing in the back. Buy this! You wont regret it! buy it cheaper on her website [...]Please join the tracy anderson method facebook group! you will find tons of tips and great info about the method there!  [...],5,Finally!

No I feel like I have a chance with Cardio Dance and Cardio Dance 2 later on down the road! I am glad she made the beginer workout for those of us who are not natural born dancers. Her 3 other trainers are all very nice and good teachers. The four different routines gave it a lot of variety. Make this your first Dance Cardio workout by the Tracy anderson method!I do have the Mat and Post Preg.workouts and also want to move up with her Perfect Design series1-3 soon as well. This is her least expensive workout as well.
