1434554,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B004ZEDJ9G,Gerard D. Launay,"[8, 8]","Everybody...some time in their lives...has heard Jascha Heifetz.  But do we really understand the man?  There are so many insights - not only about him - but about life in general that make this film a must-see.I learned, for example, the value of a truthful critic.  Always being praised as ""the best"", Mr. Heifetz took his talent for granted and eventually was giving performances without practicing.  One critic noticed it, and wrote a scathing review.  The violinist was devastated but was changed nearly overnight.  Gone was his carefree nature...and he became an absolute perfectionist. Even his hair style and posture changed. No question - there is an emotional difference between the younger and the older Heifetz.  In the documentary, Itzhak Perlman talks a considerable deal...and while he radiates warmth the same cannot be said about Jascha Heifetz as an individual.  Of course, in performances, that is altogether something different.  The movie offers many splendid examples of Heifetz's virtuosity.  Those interested in this film should also check out the film - The Art of Violin - which includes performances by other ""greats"" such as Nathan Milstein and Ginette Neveu.There were other moments in the film that touched me very deeply.  One was the fact he liked to raise the flag of the United States in the morning at his mansion in Malibu...he was so proud to be an American.  Another was the effort he made to perform for the U.S. troops during World War II.  There is a scene where it was pouring down rain, and only one, just one soldier came to the concert.  Jascha Heifetz played the violin during the rain for that one man...He was engaged to do a concert and that was what he was going to do.  He remarked that it was one of his finest performances.  What a man!But there are dark sides also.  This perfectionist could not bother with his children, who were probably normal kids, and let them down terribly...going so far as to write them out of his handwritten will.  He died alone. Consider the contrast with a musician such as Leonard Bernstein. When Bernstein died, huge gatherings of people of New York City lined up the sidewalks...and mourned.The bottom line is that Jascha Heifetz was a man larger than life, perhaps even too large for himself.",5,"This movie is a ""revelation"" - one of the best musician documentaries",1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,2279,"['Everybody', 'time', 'lives', 'heard', 'Jascha', 'Heifetz', 'do', 'really', 'understand', 'man', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'insights', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'general', 'make', 'film', 'must-see.I', 'learned', 'example', 'value', 'truthful', 'critic', 'Always', 'being', 'praised', 'best', 'Mr.', 'Heifetz', 'took', 'talent', 'granted', 'eventually', 'was', 'giving', 'performances', 'practicing', 'One', 'critic', 'noticed', 'wrote', 'scathing', 'review', 'violinist', 'was', 'devastated', 'was', 'changed', 'nearly', 'overnight', 'Gone', 'was', 'carefree', 'nature', 'became', 'absolute', 'perfectionist', 'Even', 'hair', 'style', 'posture', 'changed', 'question', 'emotional', 'difference', 'younger', 'older', 'Heifetz', 'documentary', 'Itzhak', 'Perlman', 'considerable', 'deal', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Jascha', 'Heifetz', 'individual', 'course', 'performances', 'altogether', 'something', 'different', 'movie', 'many', 'splendid', 'examples', 'Heifetz', 'virtuosity', 'interested', 'film', 'should', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'Art', 'Violin', 'performances', 'other', 'greats', 'such', 'Nathan', 'Milstein', 'Ginette', 'Neveu.There', 'were', 'other', 'moments', 'film', 'touched', 'very', 'deeply', 'One', 'was', 'fact', 'liked', 'raise', 'flag', 'United', 'States', 'morning', 'mansion', 'Malibu', 'was', 'so', 'proud', 'be', 'American', 'was', 'effort', 'made', 'perform', 'U.S.', 'troops', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'scene', 'where', 'was', 'pouring', 'down', 'rain', 'only', 'one', 'just', 'one', 'soldier', 'came', 'concert', 'Jascha', 'Heifetz', 'played', 'violin', 'rain', 'one', 'man', 'was', 'engaged', 'do', 'concert', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'remarked', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'What', 'man', 'are', 'dark', 'sides', 'also', 'perfectionist', 'could', 'not', 'bother', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'probably', 'normal', 'kids', 'let', 'down', 'terribly', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'write', 'handwritten', 'will', 'died', 'alone', 'Consider', 'contrast', 'musician', 'such', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'When', 'Bernstein', 'died', 'huge', 'gatherings', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'lined', 'up', 'sidewalks', 'mourned.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Jascha', 'Heifetz', 'was', 'man', 'larger', 'life', 'perhaps', 'even', 'too', 'large']",Jascha Heifetz: God's Fiddler

1434556,A19QFPITR2N8M9,B004ZEDJ9G,Nelson E. Donley,"[13, 13]","""God's Fiddler"" sounds like a film about a hillbilly evangelist. I wondered, at first, the reason for such a tacky title. Around the middle of the video I learned the reason. When the great Hungarian violin teacher, Leopold Auer, was asked to name his best pupils, he left Heifetz off the list. Why? ""Heifetz is not my student. He is God's student,"" answered Auer.There has never been a violinist who equaled Jascha Heifetz's playing; not even Paganini. There is something truly unique about Heifetz's playing that's hard to explain. Even when playing an open ""G"", as in the beginning of the 2nd Bruch concerto, we know in an instant that it's Heifetz who's playing it.What Heifetz was able to achieve with the violin was more than remarkable. It was uncanny. Having seen all of the previous Heifetz videos, I wasn't expecting anything new from this one. ""God's Fiddler"" contains a lot of previously viewed material, but it also has video clips from the Heifetz archives I've never seen before. That's worth the price of the video by itself. It also has wonderful commentaries from such noted individuals as Ivry Gitlis, Itzhak Perlman, Sherry Kloss, and Ayke Agus. In the case of the last, Ayke Agus probably knew Heifetz best, as she was with him from the time she began studying with him until his death.This video is one that I shall never sell and I made a copy of it so I won't wear out the original. It really is THAT good. High quality video & audio & never boring-- not even for a second. My only complaint is that I wish it could have been longer. So, my recommendations to you is...Don't just sit there, BUY IT NOW!

1434557,A3V5JJF982NS48,B004ZEDJ9G,"ricardo_guerrero ""ricardo_guerrero""","[16, 16]","I believe this is the first substantial documentary on Heifetz's life and career - at least that has been commercially available on video.  Prior to this, we pretty much had legend - which consisted largely of word-of-mouth stories, as well as a few very poorly done biographies of Heifetz's life to rely on, plus the short films by Rudy Polk and Bernard Luber (later retitled ""Heifetz and Piatigorsky"").  The books ""Heifetz Through My Eyes"" by Ayke Agus and ""Heifetz as I Knew Him"" by Sherry Kloss provided a good deal of information about his later life, but his early years was unknown. Masterfully produced by Peter Rosen, it contains a lot of fascinating material.  For those of us who really know what Jascha Heifetz achieved in his performing career and just how 'sui generis' he was in this World, this film is really a treasure trove.  But it was done in such a way that is accessible to nearly everyone.  Rosen begins the film in Russia, and captured some wonderful photography of present-day Vilna, Lithuania, where Heifetz was born.  The inclusion of Heifetz's home movies is, I think, one of the best aspects of the film.  There is even footage of him with Prof. Leopold Auer, legendary pedagogue and teacher.  I was amazed when I saw those mere 15 seconds of the two of them together talking and joking - Heifetz with his fiddle and Auer holding the score.  Apparently, Auer never claimed that Heifetz was his pupil - that he was a student of God...God's fiddler.Rosen got a number of good interviewers for the film, including Ida Haendel, Ivry Gitlis, cellist Nathaniel Rosen, Itzhak Perlman, Seymour Lipkin, and several of his former students, including Agus and Kloss.  Agus, who still lives in the Los Angeles area, was the most important individual in Heifetz's life in his later years, and she provides significant insight about him and added a lot to the film.  She sacrificed a lot of her life for him.  By then, he was no longer concertizing and most of what few friends and colleagues from the early years, including Gregor Piatigorsky, had died, and his students and his class at USC were what he really lived for.  Not much is included in the film about his family - family was always difficult for him and he had almost no relationship with any of them.  Agus provides a bit of insight as to why.  If there is anything to criticize, I guess it would be some quite awkward voiceovers that appear throughout the film, of various Heifetz quotations.  We don't hear anything from one Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod, Heifetz's principal biographer, whom Heifetz unsuccessfully sued before they became very good friends (Axelrod fled from the US in 2004 after serving a jail sentence for tax evasion.)  Quite a bit of footage of previously-released Heifetz material are integrated very well, including the 1953 Polk/Luber films, the 1970 French TV special with the Bruch Scottish Fantasy and Bach Chaconne (and recital numbers with Brooks Smith at the piano), and the 1962 Master Class series produced by Nathan Kroll.  And thankfully, Heifetz's studio is still intact and being well preserved by the Colburn School (Mrs. Colburn is listed as a producer in the credits.)  Peter Rosen has indeed achieved a lot with this film.",4,A Wonderful Tribute,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,3238,"['believe', 'first', 'substantial', 'documentary', 'Heifetz', 'life', 'career', 'least', 'been', 'commercially', 'available', 'video', 'Prior', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'legend', 'consisted', 'largely', 'word-of-mouth', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'biographies', 'Heifetz', 'life', 'rely', 'short', 'films', 'Rudy', 'Polk', 'Bernard', 'Luber', 'later', 'retitled', 'Heifetz', 'Piatigorsky', 'books', 'Heifetz', 'My', 'Eyes', 'Ayke', 'Agus', 'Heifetz', 'Knew', 'Him', 'Sherry', 'Kloss', 'provided', 'good', 'deal', 'information', 'later', 'life', 'early', 'years', 'was', 'unknown', 'Masterfully', 'produced', 'Peter', 'Rosen', 'lot', 'fascinating', 'material', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'Jascha', 'Heifetz', 'achieved', 'performing', 'career', 'just', 'how', ""'sui"", 'generis', 'was', 'World', 'film', 'really', 'treasure', 'trove', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'accessible', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Rosen', 'film', 'Russia', 'captured', 'wonderful', 'photography', 'present-day', 'Vilna', 'Lithuania', 'where', 'Heifetz', 'was', 'born', 'inclusion', 'Heifetz', 'home', 'movies', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'aspects', 'film', 'even', 'footage', 'Prof.', 'Leopold', 'Auer', 'legendary', 'pedagogue', 'teacher', 'was', 'amazed', 'when', 'saw', 'mere', '15', 'seconds', 'two', 'together', 'talking', 'joking', 'Heifetz', 'fiddle', 'Auer', 'holding', 'score', 'Apparently', 'Auer', 'never', 'claimed', 'Heifetz', 'was', 'pupil', 'was', 'student', 'God', 'God', 'fiddler.Rosen', 'got', 'number', 'good', 'interviewers', 'film', 'including', 'Ida', 'Haendel', 'Ivry', 'Gitlis', 'cellist', 'Nathaniel', 'Rosen', 'Itzhak', 'Perlman', 'Seymour', 'Lipkin', 'several', 'former', 'students', 'including', 'Agus', 'Kloss', 'Agus', 'who', 'still', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'individual', 'Heifetz', 'life', 'later', 'years', 'significant', 'insight', 'added', 'lot', 'film', 'sacrificed', 'lot', 'life', 'then', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'concertizing', 'most', 'what', 'few', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'early', 'years', 'including', 'Gregor', 'Piatigorsky', 'had', 'died', 'students', 'class', 'USC', 'were', 'what', 'really', 'lived', 'Not', 'much', 'included', 'film', 'family', 'family', 'was', 'always', 'difficult', 'had', 'almost', 'relationship', 'Agus', 'bit', 'insight', 'why', 'anything', 'criticize', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'awkward', 'voiceovers', 'appear', 'film', 'various', 'Heifetz', 'quotations', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anything', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Herbert', 'R.', 'Axelrod', 'Heifetz', 'principal', 'biographer', 'whom', 'Heifetz', 'unsuccessfully', 'sued', 'became', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'Axelrod', 'fled', 'US', '2004', 'serving', 'jail', 'sentence', 'tax', 'evasion', 'bit', 'footage', 'previously-released', 'Heifetz', 'material', 'are', 'integrated', 'very', 'well', 'including', '1953', 'Polk/Luber', 'films', '1970', 'French', 'TV', 'special', 'Bruch', 'Scottish', 'Fantasy', 'Bach', 'Chaconne', 'recital', 'numbers', 'Brooks', 'Smith', 'piano', '1962', 'Master', 'Class', 'series', 'produced', 'Nathan', 'Kroll', 'thankfully', 'Heifetz', 'studio', 'still', 'intact', 'being', 'well', 'preserved', 'Colburn', 'School', 'Mrs.', 'Colburn', 'listed', 'producer', 'credits', 'Peter', 'Rosen', 'indeed', 'achieved', 'lot', 'film']",Jascha Heifetz: God's Fiddler
