TFPOBA again was gaining more viewership than its fellow sitcom,THE COSBY SHOW. CS star Bill Cosby personally decided to pull the plug on his sitcom after this season despite the still-high ratings. Even the CHEERS audience was gradually declining. After this season,Smith filmed the Warner Bros. comedy MADE IN AMERICA(his film debut) with CHEERS star Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg.

The focus darts between Will and the other characters in turn, presenting them in greater depth.  Although a lot of the focus still circles around Will, and his differences, now that he has lived with the Banks's for a while, it is clear that he is settling in for the long haul.  There will always be ways that Will is different, which helps the show in the future, it's much more refreshing to see the other characters more fleshed out and just as delightful as the Will character.The similarities with the first season, however, are still apparent.  The movie is made in the 90s, critiquing the hype and gossip of the last decade before the millennium, but also exposing stereotypes and confronting the difficulties of an African American family in America.  Although it is uproariously funny, there are messages of self-worth, determination, living life to the fullest, and most importantly, love circling throughout the episodes.

Of course, they are still funny as heck, and the hilarity flows on a wave of momentum from the first episode to the last.  We start to see new sides of the characters that may seem perplexing at first after their seemingly straightforward natures in Season 1, but they quickly begin to grow on the viewer.  One recurring character for this season only, Will's friend by the name of ""Ty(reke)"", adds to the comedy every step of the way.Highlights of Season 2 include: ""The Mother Of All Battles"" (Ashley gets bullied by a female classmate, as Will clumsily attempts to defend her and set the bully straight.  This episode shows Ashley at her most vulnerable, Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv at their most raw--as duly noted in the closing scene); ""Guess Who's Coming To Marry"" (The Banks Family gets a new in-law of a different description); ""The Big Four-Oh"" (Vivian turns 40, and to prove her youth, ability, and grace still fully exist, takes a dance class and stuns everybody involved [including the viewing audience]); ""The Butler Did It"" (Geoffrey, Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv go on ""separate"" vacations--with hilarious results of course.  Carlton absent-mindedly rents their home for a music video, much to everyone's dismay); ""Hilary Gets A Life"" (Hilary has to pay off her credit card debts by getting a job as a caterer and faking her way through it); ""Eyes On The Prize"" (A test of Will's true friendship between him and Jazz AND him and Ty[reke] ensues over the choice of partner as a gameshow contestant, and the lengths and depths he goes to before they all make up at the end); ""Be My Baby Tonight"" (Ashley attempts to get the real man outta Will by asking him sex-related questions, much to Will's horror).All in all, a great way to continue the nostalgia of one of the greatest television shows ever produced.

Will Smith was hilarious on this show, and it really helped to catapult him to super-stardom.  I loved how he was always making fun of Carlton, who was always just so goofy, and kind of full of himself.  And it was also hilarious how Will used to dress back then, with the weird, multi-colored shirts, and that crazy high flat-top hairdo that all the black guys had 15 years ago.  Nostalgic in a fun way.

921522,A2NXAV1SNXWA9H,B000A59PM4,S. R.,"[55, 58]","This DVD set compiles all 24 episodes from the hilarious second season of this 90s classic.  While season 1 centered around Will trying to bring some levity and street wise knowledge to his snobbish relatives, season 2 shows Will blending in with his new family and forming a more cohesive unit.  This season also marked a lot of changes for the show including a brand new more spacious house set, new additions to the supporting cast such as Will's mom and Will's new best friend Tyriq (my personal favorite), the broadening of unique character traits for each family member that would become their trademarks, and the first time the show was ranked in the top 20.  Here are the episodes that make up this memorable season;1. DID THE EARTH MOVE FOR YOU?- Will and his new girlfriend are trapped together during an earthquake.2. THE MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES- Will and Carlton try to help Ashley with a bully problem.3. WILL GETS A JOB- Will juggles school and a new job in order to pay for a homecoming party.4. PSAT PSTORY- Will confident while preparing for college aptitude tests while Carlton is a mess.5. GRANNY GETS BUSY- Philip can't bear to think of his widow mother having a new man in her life.6. GUESS WHO'S COMING TO MARRY?- Will's mom forbids Will to attend the interracial marriage of Aunt Janice.7. THE BIG FOUR-OH- Vivian's 40th birthday marks a crisis as she is determined to perfect her dance skills.8. SHE AIN'T HEAVY- Will likes the full-figured Dee Dee (Queen Latifah) but doesn't want to ask to the dance.9. CASED UP- A pompous lawyer (Malcom Jamal Warner) who's dating Hilary sues Will after a car accident.10. HI-HO SILVER- Will and Carlton think a party guest (Zsa Zsa Gabor) stole their silverware.11. THE BUTLER DID IT- Carlton rents the house to Bell Biv DeVoe for a video shoot while his parents are away.12. SOMETHING FOR NOTHING- After winning money at a fundraiser, Will is reluctant to donate it to charity.13. CHRISTMAS SHOW- The family must come up with heartfelt Christmas gifts after they are robbed.14. HILARY GETS A LIFE- Hilary must work for a caterer after her credit cards are canceled.15. MY BROTHER'S KEEPER- Winning at basketball isn't as important to Will as it is to his opponent from Malibu Prep.16. GEOFFREY CLEANS UP- Geoffrey falls for a neighbor he believes is a housekeeper but who turns out to be rich.17. COMMUNITY ACTION- Hillary develops a crush on a doctor after being ordered to do community service.18. ILL WILL- The family fears Geoffrey's memoirs while Will fears having his tonsils removed.19. EYES ON THE PRIZE- Needing a game show partner, Will must choose between bickering friends Jazz and Tyriq.20. THOSE WERE THE DAYS- A '60s radical wanted by the FBI influences Will and Carlton to protest a teacher's firing.21. VYING FOR ATTENTION- Will dislikes his mother's new boyfriend.22. THE AUNT WHO CAME TO DINNER- Aunt Helen unexpected arrival disrupts Will and Carlton's plans with two women.23. BE MY BABY TONIGHT- The family fawns over Ashley's new boyfriend but Will chokes when she asks him about sex.24. STRIP TEASE FOR TWO- Will and Carlton become strippers to regain Vivian's bracelet after getting a bad stock tip.Extras include cast bloopers and a featurette called 'Best Bits of Bel-Air', with montages, trivia and pop-ups.  It is disappointing that Will Smith seems intent on distancing himself from this show now that he has become a big Hollywood star.  It would be refreshing to see updated interviews or even an audio commentary or two from the star of the show.  In closing, despite the lack of bonus content, this is still arguably the most memorable season from a truly 'fresh' TV show.",5,The Break-Out Season!,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,3666,"['DVD', 'set', 'compiles', '24', 'episodes', 'hilarious', 'second', 'season', '90s', 'classic', 'season', '1', 'centered', 'around', 'Will', 'trying', 'bring', 'levity', 'street', 'wise', 'knowledge', 'snobbish', 'relatives', 'season', '2', 'shows', 'Will', 'blending', 'new', 'family', 'forming', 'more', 'cohesive', 'unit', 'season', 'also', 'marked', 'lot', 'changes', 'show', 'including', 'brand', 'new', 'more', 'spacious', 'house', 'set', 'new', 'additions', 'supporting', 'cast', 'such', 'Will', 'mom', 'Will', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'Tyriq', 'personal', 'favorite', 'broadening', 'unique', 'character', 'traits', 'family', 'member', 'would', 'become', 'trademarks', 'first', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'ranked', 'top', '20', 'Here', 'are', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'memorable', 'season', '1', 'DID', 'EARTH', 'MOVE', 'FOR', 'YOU', 'Will', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'trapped', 'together', 'earthquake.2', 'MOTHER', 'ALL', 'BATTLES-', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'try', 'help', 'Ashley', 'bully', 'problem.3', 'WILL', 'JOB-', 'Will', 'school', 'new', 'job', 'order', 'pay', 'homecoming', 'party.4', 'PSAT', 'PSTORY-', 'Will', 'confident', 'preparing', 'college', 'aptitude', 'tests', 'Carlton', 'mess.5', 'GRANNY', 'GETS', 'BUSY-', 'Philip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'think', 'widow', 'mother', 'having', 'new', 'man', 'life.6', 'GUESS', 'WHO', 'COMING', 'TO', 'MARRY', 'Will', 'mom', 'forbids', 'Will', 'attend', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'Aunt', 'Janice.7', 'BIG', 'FOUR-OH-', 'Vivian', '40th', 'birthday', 'crisis', 'determined', 'perfect', 'dance', 'skills.8', 'SHE', 'AI', ""N'T"", 'HEAVY-', 'Will', 'full-figured', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'Queen', 'Latifah', ""n't"", 'want', 'ask', 'dance.9', 'CASED', 'UP-', 'A', 'pompous', 'lawyer', 'Malcom', 'Jamal', 'Warner', 'who', 'dating', 'Hilary', 'sues', 'Will', 'car', 'accident.10', 'HI-HO', 'SILVER-', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'think', 'party', 'guest', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'stole', 'silverware.11', 'BUTLER', 'DID', 'IT-', 'Carlton', 'house', 'Bell', 'Biv', 'DeVoe', 'video', 'shoot', 'parents', 'are', 'away.12', 'SOMETHING', 'NOTHING-', 'winning', 'money', 'fundraiser', 'Will', 'reluctant', 'donate', 'charity.13', 'CHRISTMAS', 'SHOW-', 'family', 'must', 'come', 'up', 'heartfelt', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'are', 'robbed.14', 'HILARY', 'GETS', 'LIFE-', 'Hilary', 'must', 'work', 'caterer', 'credit', 'cards', 'are', 'canceled.15', 'BROTHER', 'KEEPER-', 'Winning', 'basketball', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'Will', 'opponent', 'Malibu', 'Prep.16', 'GEOFFREY', 'CLEANS', 'UP-', 'Geoffrey', 'neighbor', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'rich.17', 'COMMUNITY', 'ACTION-', 'Hillary', 'crush', 'doctor', 'being', 'ordered', 'do', 'community', 'service.18', 'ILL', 'WILL-', 'family', 'Geoffrey', 'memoirs', 'Will', 'having', 'tonsils', 'removed.19', 'EYES', 'PRIZE-', 'Needing', 'game', 'show', 'partner', 'Will', 'must', 'choose', 'bickering', 'friends', 'Jazz', 'Tyriq.20', 'THOSE', 'THE', 'DAYS-', 'A', 'radical', 'wanted', 'FBI', 'influences', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'protest', 'teacher', 'firing.21', 'VYING', 'ATTENTION-', 'Will', 'mother', 'new', 'boyfriend.22', 'THE', 'AUNT', 'WHO', 'CAME', 'TO', 'DINNER-', 'Aunt', 'Helen', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'disrupts', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'plans', 'two', 'women.23', 'BE', 'MY', 'BABY', 'TONIGHT-', 'family', 'Ashley', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Will', 'when', 'sex.24', 'STRIP', 'TEASE', 'FOR', 'TWO-', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'become', 'strippers', 'regain', 'Vivian', 'bracelet', 'getting', 'bad', 'stock', 'tip.Extras', 'include', 'cast', 'bloopers', 'featurette', 'called', ""'Best"", 'Bits', 'Bel-Air', 'montages', 'trivia', 'pop-ups', 'disappointing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'intent', 'distancing', 'show', 'now', 'become', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'would', 'be', 'refreshing', 'see', 'updated', 'interviews', 'even', 'audio', 'commentary', 'two', 'star', 'show', 'closing', 'lack', 'bonus', 'content', 'still', 'arguably', 'most', 'memorable', 'season', 'truly', ""'fresh"", 'TV', 'show']",The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Season 2

The actors really seem to embrace their roles even more in this season, resulting in more realistic conversations and exchanges of insults. Of course, Will gets the upper hand, as he should! This DVD set is packaged in just a slightly different manner than the first, although its contents are similar. The menus are exactly the same (aside from the dance sequences shown beside the menu options). The ""special features"" (and I use that term reluctantly) are still found on the 4th disk. Unfortunately, one of the special features re-caps the highlights of the season and gives us ""pop-up video""-style trivia about some of the actors, some of the jokes, and more. The other one shows bloopers from season 2. This would be awesome if they were different from the ones that run during the credits at the end of the show! But for the most part, they are not.As far as the episodes themselves, they are high quality! Most of the jokes are clean but hilarious, although you may have your kids asking you questions about some of the ""adult"" content. Here are some of the episodes that highlight this wonderful season:DID THE EARTH MOVE FOR YOU?: Will and his girlfriend get trapped in a room during an earthquake.THE MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES: Will and Carlton try to help Ashley out with her bully problems at school.GUESS WHO'S COMING TO MARRY?: One of Will's aunts causes a controversy in the family when she plans to marry a white guy.SHE AIN'T HEAVY: Will finds the perfect woman - only problem: she's overweight.CASED UP: Will finds himself in court when Hillary's boyfriend, an aspiring lawyer played by Malcolm Jamal Warner, sues him for damages to his car.SOMETHING FOR NOTHING: Will wins $1,000 at a country club fundraiser but lands himself in trouble when he does not donate the money back to them.CHRISTMAS SHOW: The Smith family ski trip ends up being not-so-merry when the family is robbed of all their possessions.MY BROTHER'S KEEPER: Will learns a valuable lesson when his biggest basketball rival lives in the hood and struggles just to stay alive.ILL WILL: Will winds up in the hospital with tonsilitis, and the Banks family worries that Geoffrey is writing down all their dirty secrets.EYES ON THE PRIZE: Will has to choose between Jazz and Tyriq to be his partner on a TV game show.BE MY BABY TONIGHT: Ashley asks Will about sex, which throws the entire family into a panic about her new boyfriend.STRIP TEASE FOR TWO: Will and Carlton become male strippers to earn enough money to buy back Vivian's bracelet that they pawned off.This season is filled with moments guaranteed to have you laughing out loud and quoting the lines to friends and family members.

The show got renewed.2.  The show got a bigger budget, allowing for a proper set redesign.  (it now looks like they live in a mansion...)3.  DVD video quality looks good, as had season 1.4.  Geoffrey is as awesome as ever.5.  Phil's mother returns and is terrific as always!  (She and Wil have this awesome on-screen chemistry as well.)Episodes worth seeing first, and in no particular order:* Guess Who's Coming to Marry?:  Wil's aunt is intent on marrying a white man (a yummy Deitrich Bader).  Wil's mother is against the proposal.* The Mother of All Battles:  Ashley encounters a bully.* She Ain't Heavy:  Will falls for a chick with the right personality but not his favorite body shape.  Will he grow up?* Cased Up:  Wil, uninsured and underaged, gets into the car and causes an accident... with Phil gets sued.* Hi-Ho Silver:  Wil and Carlton believe their neighbor (Zsa Zsa Gabor!) stole Phil's antique silverware!* Something for Nothing:  Wil wins $1000 in an event, but isn't happy when he learns the money is to be donated as charity back to the event organizers.  He instead has a better idea...* Those Were the Days:  A 1960s' radical encourages Wil to protest when a free-thinker teacher is fired.* Granny Gets Busy:  Phil dislikes the notion of his widowed mother dating his handiman.The bloopers were terrific.  It's always great to see bloopers!  :-)But I was hoping for a documentary about the changes put in to season 2.Now for the stuff YOU want to read;1.  As with season 1's release, the audio is mono.  This was 1991.  Stereo had been a standard for a whopping seven YEARS.  I cannot believe this show was originally made in mono.2.  Starting with the opening episode, Vivian's role from distinguished mother to that of an overt cartoon character has begun.  It's little wonder she ultimately left after season 3.3.  Indeed, while the series has always had a ""live action cartoon"" style to it, season 2 seems to favor the cartoonish side over the others (drama and social-awareness); the ensemble of all three was what made Fresh Prince so memorable.4.  The number of overtly ""socially aware"" plots has plummeted.  Some episodes still have some socially aware themes, but season 2's style keep them from being as poignant as they could be.5.  I'll admit this one is somewhat minor, but I miss seeing Jazz being thrown out the door all the time!All of this isn't to say the show's gone to pot just yet!  (that's season 4...)  But it has been said that season 1 is the best of the six and I've got to agree with that as well.  Season 1 had the perfect balance and is a gem to be treasured.  Season 2 seems more like a typical show with occasional moments of glory.  But it is definitely worth the purchase.",4,It begins...,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,2857,"['slow', 'decay', 'show', 'right', 'now', 'still', 'relatively', 'classy', 'stuff', 'Let', 'start', 'positive', 'aspects:1', 'show', 'got', 'renewed.2', 'show', 'got', 'bigger', 'budget', 'allowing', 'proper', 'set', 'redesign', 'now', 'live', 'mansion', '3', 'DVD', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'had', 'season', '1.4', 'Geoffrey', 'as', 'awesome', 'ever.5', 'Phil', 'mother', 'returns', 'terrific', 'always', 'Wil', 'have', 'awesome', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'as', 'well', 'Episodes', 'seeing', 'first', 'particular', 'order', '*', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Marry', 'Wil', 'aunt', 'intent', 'marrying', 'white', 'man', 'yummy', 'Deitrich', 'Bader', 'Wil', 'mother', 'proposal', '*', 'Mother', 'All', 'Battles', 'Ashley', 'bully', '*', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Heavy', 'Will', 'chick', 'right', 'personality', 'not', 'favorite', 'body', 'shape', 'Will', 'grow', 'up', '*', 'Cased', 'Up', 'Wil', 'uninsured', 'underaged', 'car', 'accident', 'Phil', 'sued', '*', 'Hi-Ho', 'Silver', 'Wil', 'Carlton', 'believe', 'neighbor', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'stole', 'Phil', 'antique', 'silverware', '*', 'Something', 'Nothing', 'Wil', '1000', 'event', ""n't"", 'happy', 'when', 'money', 'be', 'donated', 'charity', 'back', 'event', 'organizers', 'instead', 'better', 'idea', '*', 'Were', 'Days', '1960s', 'radical', 'encourages', 'Wil', 'protest', 'when', 'free-thinker', 'teacher', 'fired', '*', 'Granny', 'Gets', 'Busy', 'Phil', 'notion', 'widowed', 'mother', 'dating', 'handiman.The', 'bloopers', 'were', 'terrific', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'bloopers', 'was', 'hoping', 'documentary', 'changes', 'put', 'season', '2.Now', 'stuff', 'YOU', 'want', 'read', '1', 'season', '1', 'release', 'audio', 'mono', 'was', '1991', 'Stereo', 'had', 'been', 'standard', 'whopping', 'seven', 'YEARS', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'mono.2', 'Starting', 'opening', 'episode', 'Vivian', 'role', 'distinguished', 'mother', 'overt', 'cartoon', 'character', 'begun', 'little', 'wonder', 'ultimately', 'left', 'season', '3.3', 'Indeed', 'series', 'always', 'had', 'live', 'action', 'cartoon', 'style', 'season', '2', 'favor', 'cartoonish', 'side', 'others', 'drama', 'social-awareness', 'ensemble', 'three', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'so', 'memorable.4', 'number', 'overtly', 'socially', 'aware', 'plots', 'plummeted', 'episodes', 'still', 'have', 'socially', 'aware', 'themes', 'season', '2', 'style', 'keep', 'being', 'as', 'poignant', 'could', 'be.5', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'one', 'somewhat', 'minor', 'miss', 'seeing', 'Jazz', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'door', 'time', ""n't"", 'say', 'show', 'gone', 'pot', 'just', 'yet', 'season', '4', 'been', 'said', 'season', '1', 'best', 'six', ""'ve"", 'got', 'agree', 'as', 'well', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'perfect', 'balance', 'gem', 'be', 'treasured', 'Season', '2', 'more', 'typical', 'show', 'occasional', 'moments', 'glory', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchase']",The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Season 2
