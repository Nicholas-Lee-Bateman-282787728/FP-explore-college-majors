Having read everything I could about this saint over a period of almost 40 years, I thought the film was quite realistic and rather lovely, even with the few liberties taken with the story.  I didn't see anything insulting to the catholic faith in it, or to nuns.  But I can't help but note how strongly some of the reviewers interpreted it that way.  I don't know what to say to that. As to the person who objected to the sensuality of the nuns' thoughts in prayer -- well, I think they were quoting the Song of Songs, and St. John of the Cross's Spiritual Canticle -- traditional carmelite sources.  At any rate, everything else aside, I thought the actual editing and scene composition were very well done.",5,Interesting,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,738,"['was', 'charmed', 'film', 'Having', 'read', 'everything', 'could', 'about', 'saint', 'period', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'realistic', 'rather', 'lovely', 'even', 'few', 'liberties', 'taken', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'insulting', 'catholic', 'faith', 'nuns', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'note', 'how', 'strongly', 'reviewers', 'interpreted', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'person', 'who', 'objected', 'sensuality', 'nuns', 'thoughts', 'prayer', 'well', 'think', 'were', 'quoting', 'Song', 'Songs', 'St.', 'John', 'Cross', 'Spiritual', 'Canticle', 'traditional', 'carmelite', 'sources', 'rate', 'everything', 'else', 'aside', 'thought', 'actual', 'editing', 'scene', 'composition', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Therefore, no fancy sets or backgrounds, just a concentration on the life of a very devout, simple, and loving young girl. Not her whole life, only bits and pieces of how she thought, what she said and did, and what life in a Cloistered Convent was like. l've seen this movie several times, and not once did l see any overt or obvious act of the so-called lesbianism. See it for its spititual message, and keep in mind that after this movie was released there was a solid increase in applications to Carmelite Convents and a more solid interest in the life of St. Therese of Lisieux, also known as the Little Flower.",5,Not for Everyone,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,783,"['Keep', 'mind', 'director', 'film', 'was', 'atheist', 'one', 'primary', 'purposes', 'filming', 'was', 'experiment', 'new/different', 'cinematic', 'style', 'Therefore', 'fancy', 'sets', 'backgrounds', 'just', 'concentration', 'life', 'very', 'devout', 'simple', 'loving', 'young', 'girl', 'Not', 'whole', 'life', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'how', 'thought', 'what', 'said', 'did', 'what', 'life', 'Cloistered', 'Convent', 'was', 'l', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'l', 'see', 'overt', 'obvious', 'act', 'so-called', 'lesbianism', 'See', 'spititual', 'message', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'solid', 'increase', 'applications', 'Carmelite', 'Convents', 'more', 'solid', 'interest', 'life', 'St.', 'Therese', 'Lisieux', 'also', 'known', 'Little', 'Flower']",N/A
730173,A3MDRBWMQBI2PS,B00007KK1V,"Gadget Queen ""Gadget Queen""","[23, 26]","Unlike some of the more vehement reviews citing flaws, I saw this film as an unprecedentedly REALISTIC view of a saint I have read about for over 40 years. One must realize that life in the 19th century was not convenient or easy--and the convent life depicted reflects various aspects of that. Also, French culture at the time of her life was tolerant of much innocent physical demonstrations of love among family members--also depicted in the film. Comments about St. Therese calling Christ her lover are obviously oblivious to the writings of St. Teresa of Avila, St. Francis of Assissi, St. John of the Cross, and the Lord Himself in the Bible in ""The Song of Songs"". To assign other vulgar meanings to these references by her in the movie is uneducated and parochial. I found this movie to be one of the most beautiful I have ever seen about her life. And if anyone things the sets were stark, I invite them to visit the Carmelite convent where Therese lived and died--compared to that, the sets used in the movie were luxurious! A definite good work on the life of a Saint and Doctor of the Catholic Church!!",5,Most realistic portrayal of The Little Flower I've ever seen!,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,1114,"['more', 'vehement', 'reviews', 'citing', 'flaws', 'saw', 'film', 'unprecedentedly', 'REALISTIC', 'view', 'saint', 'have', 'read', '40', 'years', 'One', 'must', 'realize', 'life', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'not', 'convenient', 'easy', 'convent', 'life', 'depicted', 'various', 'aspects', 'Also', 'French', 'culture', 'time', 'life', 'was', 'tolerant', 'much', 'innocent', 'physical', 'demonstrations', 'love', 'family', 'members', 'also', 'depicted', 'film', 'Comments', 'St.', 'Therese', 'calling', 'Christ', 'lover', 'are', 'obviously', 'oblivious', 'writings', 'St.', 'Teresa', 'Avila', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Assissi', 'St.', 'John', 'Cross', 'Lord', 'Himself', 'Bible', 'Song', 'Songs', 'assign', 'other', 'vulgar', 'meanings', 'references', 'movie', 'uneducated', 'parochial', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'anyone', 'things', 'sets', 'were', 'stark', 'invite', 'visit', 'Carmelite', 'convent', 'where', 'Therese', 'lived', 'died', 'compared', 'sets', 'used', 'movie', 'were', 'luxurious', 'A', 'definite', 'good', 'work', 'life', 'Saint', 'Doctor', 'Catholic', 'Church']",N/A
