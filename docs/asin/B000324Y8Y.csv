I did enjoy Regina King's supporting character of Sam's coworker at the diner. She really did a lot with a one-dimensional character. The stepsisters are just flat out annoying.

My daughter loved it.  And I could really find no wrong with it after several viewings. It is actually a very healthy, easy to watch movie with no bad jokes, no distasteful moments, no ego moves for Hilary Duff. She is sweet, genuine and very down to earth in this movie, not overly made up, not promiscuous, and a very good role model for young female viewers.  And Chad Michael Murray does a good job as well as a decent young man.The music was very enjoyable - somewhat romantic at times.  The other supporting actors were fun. Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde 1 and 2) is always entertaining even as a wicked stepmother, the actors who played the diner staff were good as well.  The two stepsisters had minor roles, but they were amusing.  Not that we live in California, but it seemed like high school life might be somewhat accurately depicted in this movie that doesn't try to be other than a fairytale anyways.I enjoyed Hilary Duff much more in this movie than in ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" (hated that movie) or the Lizzie MacGuire Movie.This is a good movie to buy because if your daughter's a preteen or a young teenager, she will most likely enjoy it very much - over and over!  Our other two rentals at the same time were ""Ella Enchanted"" (don't) and ""Princess Diaries 2 (I didn't personally view it, but my husband was not impressed).

854661,A2GV7NSHUW7NRG,B000324Y8Y,"Alexis Brown ""Blonde Baby""","[2, 2]","When I first saw this movie back in 2004 in the theater with my best guy friend and little brother, all I could think was how stupid and teeny it was (even though I think Chad Michael Murray is a babe). However...my friends loved it and about a year later for whatever reason I bought it. As I watched it again, it really grew on me and I realized that this movie was funny! I had to overlook a few things: People don't go to school in a castle, people don't go through carwashes, the whole losing cell phone thing was a little extreme as I don't think in real life it would be hard to figure out who it belonged to, and also the mere fact that he had to search the entire school for his Cinderella whenever all she had was a tiny mask over her eyes. Once I overlooked those annoyances, as I mentioned, I realized it is a funny movie with good acting. Hilary Duff puts on a good performance as Sam, a hardworking teenager whose dream of going to Princeton lies in the hands of her demanding stepmother Fiona, since her father passed away in an earthquake when she was little. Chad Michael Murray puts on a mediocre performance as the jock, secretly ""closet poet"" who is Sam's secret admire via Princeton chatroom. I am not sure of her name, but the lady who plays Ronda, one of the managers of Fiona's diner puts on an excellent heartfelt performance as a concerened motherly figure looking out for Sam. But perhaps the most notable and comic performance comes from Jennifer Coolidge as the stepmother from hell, who enjoys none other than salmon fad diets (it costs a fortune to ship the stuff in from ""Norweiga""), tanning, liposuction, and Botox. Without Coolidge's entertaining performance as Fiona, this movie would be nothing more than an average teen flick, but thanks to her, the movie hits above average.",4,Jennifer Coolidge makes the movie!!,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1812,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', '2004', 'theater', 'best', 'guy', 'friend', 'little', 'brother', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'how', 'stupid', 'teeny', 'was', 'even', 'think', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'babe', 'However', 'friends', 'loved', 'year', 'later', 'reason', 'bought', 'watched', 'again', 'really', 'grew', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'had', 'overlook', 'few', 'things', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'school', 'castle', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'carwashes', 'whole', 'losing', 'cell', 'phone', 'thing', 'was', 'little', 'extreme', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'belonged', 'also', 'mere', 'fact', 'had', 'search', 'entire', 'school', 'Cinderella', 'whenever', 'had', 'was', 'tiny', 'mask', 'eyes', 'Once', 'overlooked', 'annoyances', 'mentioned', 'realized', 'funny', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'good', 'performance', 'Sam', 'hardworking', 'teenager', 'dream', 'going', 'Princeton', 'hands', 'demanding', 'stepmother', 'Fiona', 'father', 'passed', 'away', 'earthquake', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'jock', 'secretly', 'closet', 'poet', 'who', 'Sam', 'secret', 'admire', 'Princeton', 'chatroom', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'name', 'lady', 'who', 'Ronda', 'one', 'managers', 'Fiona', 'diner', 'excellent', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'concerened', 'motherly', 'figure', 'looking', 'out', 'Sam', 'perhaps', 'most', 'notable', 'comic', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'stepmother', 'hell', 'who', 'none', 'other', 'salmon', 'fad', 'diets', 'fortune', 'ship', 'stuff', 'Norweiga', 'tanning', 'liposuction', 'Botox', 'Coolidge', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'Fiona', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'average', 'teen', 'flick', 'thanks', 'movie', 'above', 'average']",N/A

I like the way they change from the glass slippers to cell phone and all those pumkin to a convertible. But there's one hitch, I think the movie is trying to focus on Hilary...like all Hilary...but of course, she's the main character afterall.This movie is kind of good, but since I watched it long time ago, I think I am getting a bit tire of it. The story goes as Sam's (Duff) dad died a earthquake, so it starts out with her stepmom (Coolidge), Fiona, taking over the house, the diner that belongs to Sam's dad, and including Sam herself. Throughout the years, Sam suffers of being a slave to the family, and only lives up to that she she can have her dream come true, which is to go to Princeton, a college, like they discussed (Sam and her dad) when her dad was alive. In the same time, Sam met a secret-admirer from the Princeton chatroom. But soon discovers that this Noman (that's what the person's sn is) is the school's most popular guy, Austin Ames (Murrey). Since all Sam is is this diner girl, she thought that Austin would never like her the way she is. Oh, and did I forgot about the evil stepsisters (Zima and Avery)? 'Cause they play a important evil and hilerious part in this tale, which involves pulling a prank that broke the heart of Sam. This movie is about Sam standing up for herself, and believe in her dreams, isn't that the only movies Hilary is in?

Sam is a high school student living with her stepmother and stepsisters after her father dies. When she's not in school, Sam either works at the family diner or does chores around the house while her stepmother suns herself and her stepsisters practice their synchronized swimming routine.  Her dream is to go to Princeton, and while in a Princeton chatroom, she strikes up an on-line relationship with someone at her school who also wants to go the Princeton. She arranges to meet her anonymous on-line friend at a school dance, but chickens out when she realizes he's the captain of the football team. Her stepsisters find out about the on-line relationship and arrange to have her humiliated in front of the whole school. Sam must learn how to stand up for herself and against those who hurt her before she can find love.The acting is as expected in a movie like this. Hilary Duff is good as Sam and Chad Michael Murray as Austin has the rugged good looks of a teen idol and no doubt a poster of him is hanging in many a teenager girl's bedroom. Regina King is a standout as Sam's friend at the diner, but it's Jennifer Coolidge as Sam's botoxed, self-indulgent stepmother who steals the movie.This is a fluffy yet fun movie for women of all ages (and the type of movie most men hate). There's nothing really new in the plot, although it's nice that Sam's best friend is a boy, and that Austin is shown as having problems and is more than just a pretty face.

Even with the new addition to her family, Sam's relationship with her Father never wavers, until a horrible earthquake shakes the San Fernando Valley, killing her Father, and leaving her in the care of Fiona. Eight years later is where the movie picks up. Sam is now working day and night at Fiona's Diner - the restaurant her evil step-mother inherited when her Father died - while at the same time works as hard as possible in school, in the hopes that she will be accepted to Princeton University, and have the chance to escape her horrible life. Unfortunately, even school is a mess, as her only friend and confidant - in the school world - is Carter (Dan Byrd); and her days are spent being tortured by the popular kids, Shelby (Julie Gonzalo) and Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray). However, there is one other person who Sam trusts, and that's her cyber-buddy.

Hilary Duff (CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN and THE LIZZIE MCGUIRE MOVE), as always, gives a cute performance that makes you both sympathize with her character, and root for her at the same time. Jennifer Coolidge (LEGALLY BLONDE and AMERICAN PIE) does a fabulous job as her plastic-surgery obsessed step-mother; while Madeline Zima (THE NANNY and MR. NANNY) and Andrea Avery were very believable as the dim-witted, evil step-sisters. However, one of the best performances in the movie was that of Chad Michael Murray (FREAKY FRIDAY and ONE TREE HILL), who, as always, came through as the perfect Prince Charming, and will obviously make all girls who watch this movie swoon. Filled with cameos by other great performers such as Regina King (DADDY DAY CARE and RAY), A CINDERELLA STORY is sure to please even the oldest viewer.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",5,Every Princess Has Her Day,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,2336,"['Samantha', 'Montgomery', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'had', 'ever', 'wanted', 'Father', 'Whip', 'Hubley', 'decided', 'say', 'do', 'evil', 'Fiona', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'doing', 'so', 'accepted', 'two', 'evil', 'daughters', 'Gabriella', 'Andrea', 'Avery', 'Brianna', 'Madeline', 'Zima', 'own', 'Even', 'new', 'addition', 'family', 'Sam', 'relationship', 'Father', 'never', 'wavers', 'horrible', 'earthquake', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'killing', 'Father', 'leaving', 'care', 'Fiona', 'Eight', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'movie', 'up', 'Sam', 'now', 'working', 'day', 'night', 'Fiona', 'Diner', 'restaurant', 'evil', 'step-mother', 'inherited', 'when', 'Father', 'died', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'as', 'hard', 'possible', 'school', 'hopes', 'will', 'be', 'accepted', 'Princeton', 'University', 'have', 'chance', 'escape', 'horrible', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'school', 'mess', 'only', 'friend', 'confidant', 'school', 'world', 'Carter', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'days', 'are', 'spent', 'being', 'tortured', 'popular', 'kids', 'Shelby', 'Julie', 'Gonzalo', 'Austin', 'Ames', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'However', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'who', 'Sam', 'trusts', 'cyber-buddy', 'When', 'text-messaging', 'friend', 'meet', 'Halloween', 'Dance', 'nothing', 'hesitation', 'out', 'who', 'Prince', 'then', 'bets', 'are', 'off.I', 'have', 'seen', 'loved', 'probably', 'CINDERELLA', 're-make', 'been', 'released', 'recent', 'years', 'A', 'CINDERELLA', 'STORY', 'absolutely', 'exception', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'CHEAPER', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOZEN', 'THE', 'LIZZIE', 'MCGUIRE', 'MOVE', 'always', 'cute', 'performance', 'sympathize', 'character', 'root', 'same', 'time', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'LEGALLY', 'BLONDE', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'fabulous', 'job', 'plastic-surgery', 'obsessed', 'step-mother', 'Madeline', 'Zima', 'THE', 'NANNY', 'MR.', 'NANNY', 'Avery', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'dim-witted', 'evil', 'step-sisters', 'However', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'movie', 'was', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'FREAKY', 'FRIDAY', 'ONE', 'TREE', 'HILL', 'who', 'always', 'came', 'perfect', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'will', 'obviously', 'make', 'girls', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'swoon', 'Filled', 'cameos', 'other', 'great', 'performers', 'such', 'Regina', 'King', 'DADDY', 'DAY', 'CARE', 'RAY', 'A', 'CINDERELLA', 'STORY', 'sure', 'please', 'even', 'oldest', 'viewer.Erika', 'SoroccoBook', 'Review', 'Columnist', 'Community', 'Bugle', 'Newspaper']",N/A
854688,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B000324Y8Y,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[5, 6]","I haven't looked at other reviews of A Cinderella Story yet, but especially because it's a Hilary Duff film, I'd expect there to be a lot of scathing comments.  That's because Hilary Duff is, or was, at least, popular with tweens and teens, and lots of slightly older folks have a tendency to hate commercial or popular stuff just because it's commercial or popular.  Of course, they find other ways to justify their effectively institutional hatred of this stuff, and I'd guess that the main complaint would be the clich&eacute;d and predictable nature of the material here.And that's true.  A Cinderella Story is clich&eacute;d and predictable, but that's not a great reason to dislike it.  It is a Cinderella story, after all--it tells you right there in the title--retooled as a contemporary Los Angeles-area high school romance-comedy.  We all know the Cinderella story fairly well.  And any film fan at least old enough to almost be through with high school is surely familiar with the clich&eacute;s of rom-coms and high school films.  Most of us could write the basics of A Cinderella Story's plot without even seeing the film's trailer.  So for adults, at least, A Cinderella Story is going to be successful or not dependent on how well it hikes its well-trodden path.For me, the best material was the more traditional Cinderella-based stuff.  Jennifer Coolidge (voluptuously) fills the role of the wicked stepmother.  I like Coolidge a lot.  She has tremendous charisma and performs her infamous, quirky sarcastic act here with verve.  I also like Duff.  The two actresses playing Duff's stepsisters were new to me, but just as charismatic as Coolidge.  Director Mark Rosman quotes some of the cartoonish visual gags of Disney's Cinderella (1950) more than I expected, and it works amazingly well.  It's one element that pushes the film into a welcomed, absurd-surreal territory.What didn't work as well for me was the material when Rosman and credited writer Leigh Dunlap forgot about doing a pumped up remake of Cinderella.  Too much of A Cinderella Story deals with Sam's (Duff) budding cyber-romance, her typical high school problems and the caricatured, stereotypical high school cliques.  It's not that these other segments are bad, exactly, but they just don't have the spark or humor that the Cinderella material has, and especially for something like the cliques, we've seen this tens of times before.  These scenes would be right at home if we edited them into any of those other films or television shows--sometimes I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching, say, a Cordelia scene from the first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1997).So A Cinderella Story has a bit of a split personality--as a funny and wacky remake of Cinderella and as a far less humorous, pretty generic ""getting through adolescence and finding yourself"" message film.

854710,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000324Y8Y,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 23]","With ""A Cinderella Story"" I have clearly breached my threshold in terms of the ability to tolerate movies about ugly people in a high school setting.  My ""ugly"" people I mean the self proclaimed most beautiful girl in school with her sycophant sidekicks and the loud-mouthed, obnoxious jocks who treat everybody like dirt.  We have seen their likes in countless movies.  ""Mean Girls"" and ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" immediately come to mind, but ""A Cinderella Story"" sinks even lower in terms of presenting a cast of characters who are worthless human beings who take great joy in being miserable to Samantha Montgomery (Hillary Duff).Jennifer Coolidge is Fiona, the wicked step-mother in the story, and she is a repulsive figure.  She married Sam's father, who died in an earthquake and as much as we want to see him through the adoring eyes of his daughter he must have been really stupid to marry this woman.  She is a vulgar gold digger who has reworked every square inch of her body into some trashy notion of glamour that is more sickening than laughable.  Not only is she a bully, but she is a stupid bully, along the lines of Richard Nixon (to wit, he never destroyed the tapes that brought him down).Her daughters, a pair of miss-matched twins named Brianna (Madeline Zima) and Gabriella (Andrea Avery) have inherited their mother's stupid gene.  Then there is Shelby (Julie Gonzalo), the head cheerleader who dates the quarterback, orders people out of her way as she walks down the halls of the school, and can turn a pep rally into an excuse to personal humiliate another student because, gosh darn it, somebody wrote the script that way.  I am so sick of this character and it dawns on me that in every high school in America the girls who are most like such evil creatures as Shelby are not seeing the similarities because these movie versions are so far over the top.Now, one of the reasons for having evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty characters like this in a movie is that they get their comeuppances.  But for most of them the verdict has to be too little too late.  Living well might be the best revenge, but there is nothing wrong with the idea that the punishment should fit the crime except for the fact that in this movie it does not even come close.""A Cinderella Story"" is based on a fairy tale, which means everybody knows the story, knows the key scenes, and therefore the only question is whether there will be some imaginative reworkings of the key elements involving some notion of creativity.  It can be done, as ""Ever After"" amply proved, but this screenplay by Leigh Dunlap does not really aspire to either imagination or creativity.  Instead of a glass slipper we get a cell phone, but if you think that is actually going to go some where in terms of advancing the story line, guess again.Prior to that point the story is actually more ""You've Got Mail"" than anything else.  Sam and Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray) have been communicating by e-mail and pager.  They both want to go to Princeton and each is smart enough to pick up on the depth of the other (she has straight A's and he wants to be a writer).  But Austin is such a wimp that he is dating a girl who is incapable of being sensitive to any other breathing soul and his best friends are jerks.  But he bemoans the fact that nobody knows the real him and the fake one running around the school has the looks of Prince Charming but the strength and integrity of Charmin toilet paper.  The script requires a redemptive moment from Austin, but it is one that defies belief and speaks to a lack of character, not a manifestation of that desired trait.Director Mark Rosman's 2004 teen comedy wastes Regina King in the role of Rhonda, who is the closest thing to the fairy godmother (I was waiting for Sam to say, ""Help me, Rhonda"").  Paul Rodriguez is also wasted in a supporting role.  The most engaging character in the movie is Carter (Dan Byrd), Sam's best friend, whose intelligence has to be questioned because he pines for Shelby.  This script even thinks that giving him a legitimate shot at her is a good thing, although all it does is give Shelby another chance to be a despicable young woman, in which regard she never disappoints.The best part of this movie turns out to be the end credits, not only because the movie is over at that point, but it is also when the Duff sisters cover ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" by the Go-Go's.  I am certain her legion of fans will faithfully show up to see ""A Cinderella Story,"" but given the drop-off in receipts they must have all showed up the first week and then word of mouth got out about how dismal this film really is to anyone who has actually made it to high school.  You have to wonder if Lindsay Lohan's mom sent this script over to Duff's agent.However, to be fair I must admit that there was a moment towards the end when I applauded, and not in the spirit of indignant sarcasm.  In terms of all the high school students in this film there were three who were decent human beings.  At the end of the film two of them end up together (and one of them in not Hillary Duff's character).  True, there was absolutely nothing in the film to set up this pairing, but it was a relief to see it none the less.  How it got into the script we might never know.",2,The worst version of the Cinderella story ever filmed,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,5308,"['A', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'have', 'clearly', 'breached',

It's not a crime to enjoy a movie, even if it does have a Disney actress in it, or whatever Hilary Duff is. The actors in it are all excellent, especially Jennifer Coolidge! I officially love this woman, she's hilarious! (She was Stifler's Mom in the American Pie series, and is Joey's agent in well, Joey.) She steals the scenes right out from under Hilary's cute little nose, with her little speeches about her surgery (note, not Jennifer's surgery, the character's), and that ample chest of hers!Chad Michael Murray & Hilary make a really nice couple on screen, although unfortunately, the former is now MARRIED! I think Hilary did a better job than she did in the Lizzie McGuire Movie (which I also own). Her character was much more believable in this.The film was also brought up well up-to-date, with Hilary's very cute blue flip-top mobile, with little stars on it - I now have a fliptop, but it's silver, and has no stars. :( There's also instant messaging, and lots of laptops.The clothes in this were fabulous, the way the evil stepsisters were always identically dressed, and more often than not, in simply outrageous clothes. But once more, Jennifer's ample chest completely steals the scenes, as she's dressed in clothes that make the most of it.There's a few wee things about this movie which are slightly dodgy, and the main one is the fact that Chad's character (what kinda name is Chad?) can't see that the ""Cinderella"" he meets at the ball is the same ""Cinderella"" who works in the greasy spoon. Hello!? He's about as dense as I am if he can't spot this. (And watch out for the three Plastics, very obviously a stolen idea from Mean Girls). And instead of losing the glass slipper, Sam loses her mobile phone. Ever thought of going through her phone book, and finding a number that says ""Home"" or ""Best Friend"". Of course, the movie would have been over before it had even begun if that had happened.And what's with Sam's best guy buddy? Anyone see Velma from Scooby Doo there?! Neither of the male leads in this were worth watching for. What has happened to all the cute young guys out there? Now they're all shaggy haired, or completely & utterly ordinary. Or too clean cut.There are at least two or three songs on the soundtrack that are performed by Hilary (one she shares top billing with her sister, and another is sung only by her sister), but thankfully she doesn't sing once during the movie. What a relief.The extras are pretty fluffy: you've got your bog-standard audio commentary by the cast; Hilary and Haylie Duff ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" music video; additional scenes; screen tests (don't watch this, unless you want a cure for insomnia); ""Cinderella Couture"" - The Making of a fashionable modern fairy tale; and find Your Prince/Princess Challenge.

Only we have Sam, a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake. Sam carries on a secret email/chat romance with the most popular boy in her high school, but she doesn't know the identity of her Prince Charming.Jennifer Coolidge was a scream as the Botoxed, cosmetically enhanced, tackily dressed wicked stepmother. She was hilarious in ""Legally Blonde"", but really goes all out for this role. Quite a scene stealer was Madeline Zima as one of the two wicked stepsisters. Hilary Duff is her usual adorable, perky blonde self and is a delight to watch.One of the funniest moments for me was at the diner that was redecorated into a pepto-bismol fifties motif by the stepmother. The poor waitresses were all required to wear pink cashmere sweaters, pearls, a poodle skirt with petticoats and roller skates. If that isn't hard enough, the waitresses had to spin as they served people or picked up orders. I love when funny bits like this are slipped into movies. One can just see Jennifer Coolidge's wicked stepmother character instructing these poor waitresses on how to twirl as they served customers.This is a GREAT family film.

He delighted in reading her fairy tale stories every night, as well as teaching her good values, including standing up for herself. He ran a successful diner and one day, married again to give Sam a mother: a woman named Fiona (Jennifer Coolidge) who had daughters of her own, fraternal twins Brianna (Madeline Zima) and Gabriella (Andrea Avery). And then Sam?s father died in the Northridge earthquake, leaving her alone with her stepmother and two stepsisters. With no will found to speak of, Fiona takes over ownership of the house and the diner, relegating Sam to live in the attic.Fast forward eight years: Sam has grown into a pretty young senior in high school (who is often lost in the crowd), and must balance mounds of schoolwork, working at the diner, and taking care of her spoiled stepmother?s every whim. While Sam dislikes being made into a ?slave,? she tries to keep her stepmother happy in order to get money to attend Princeton (her dream). She has a text message secret admirer who she communicates with on a regular basis. Along with best friend Carter (Dan Byrd) they attend the school?s Halloween dance ?incognito?, where Sam is set to meet her secret admirer for the first time. Dressed in a never-before-been-worn wedding gown and mask she was loaned by friends, including ?fairy god-mother? Rhonda (played by Regina King, who has worked at the diner since Sam was a child), Sam is ready to meet her Prince Charming.When Sam discovers that her secret admirer is non other than popular quarterback, Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray), she is sure anything between them would never work out: after all, why would the most popular boy in school be interested in her? They play ?20? Questions (she gives him ?10?) and Austin learns some things about her: just when he is about to lift her mask and discover her true identity, Sam?s cell rings and she runs away, leaving her cell phone behind. Austin begins searching the school to discover his ?Cinderella?s? identity; Austin, although jock-popular boy on the surface, longs to be a writer and attend Princeton (his dad wants him to be a USC man like him). But can he convince the elusive Sam that he likes her for herself?  And when fellow seniors discover who Austin?s ?Cinderella? really is, things could get ugly...This is one of the cleanest films I have seen in ages! With really no language (no strong words were used, and no deity abuses that I caught) and minimal content issues, this is definitely both family-friendly and young child friendly. A few things are very mildly implied:  in one instance a young man goes off with a young woman and you are not sure what they are up to (you soon find out they were ?making out? nearby). Other than that, the only objectionable elements come from things like sisters fighting, a small amount of cleavage, a son going against his father?s wishes, teenagers taunting each other, some mild crude humor, and a ?wicked? stepmother who is egotistical and constantly concerned with her appearance.The thing I liked best about this film was that it was cute and clean. It has fairy tale elements, but also tries to take it from a realistic slant: of course, her secret admirer turning out to be the most popular boy in school is a bit too fairy tale, but certain scenes were pulled off in such a way that I was nicely surprised. I?m not sure if I believe the mask Sam wears would really disguise her so much that Austin wouldn?t recognize her: maybe if he was a completely self-centered jerk, but as we are to believe he is a nice guy, why wouldn?t he recognize the girl he has gone to school with for at least all of high school?! Sam comes across as almost too unassuming and ?whipped? by her stepmother at times, but I think anyone can appreciate her patience and forbearance in dealing with her difficult ?family.?  Sam is really that girl-next-door you like to love.A ?tween? re-make and update of the classic Cinderella tale, A Cinderella Story, while predictable and not entirely original, was enjoyable and a fun diversion from the everyday crush of Hollywood films. I especially appreciated (and think you will too!) how clean this film is: once in awhile Hollywood realizes that there are people out there who appreciate a storyline and film that have some good morals and leave out the muck: this is one they finally got right!",4,Modern Cinderella remake - kid-friendly and cute as can be!,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,4507,"['Once', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'long', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Sam', 'Martin', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'lived', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'widowed', 'father', 'Whip', 'Hubley', 'delighted', 'reading', 'fairy', 'tale', 'stories', 'night', 'as', 'well', 'teaching', 'good', 'values', 'including', 'standing', 'up', 'herself', 'ran', 'successful', 'diner', 'one', 'day', 'married', 'again', 'give', 'Sam', 'mother', 'woman', 'named', 'Fiona', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'who', 'had', 'daughters', 'own', 'fraternal', 'twins', 'Brianna', 'Madeline', 'Zima', 'Gabriella', 'Andrea', 'Avery', 'then', 'Sam', 's', 'father', 'died', 'Northridge', 'earthquake', 'leaving', 'alone', 'stepmother', 'two', 'stepsisters', 'will', 'found', 'speak', 'Fiona', 'ownership', 'house', 'diner', 'relegating', 'Sam', 'live', 'attic.Fast', 'forward', 'eight', 'years', 'Sam', 'grown', 'pretty', 'young', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'often', 'lost', 'crowd', 'must', 'balance', 'mounds', 'schoolwork', 'working', 'diner', 'taking', 'care', 'spoiled', 'stepmother', 's', 'whim', 'Sam', 'dislikes', 'being', 'made', 'slave', 'keep', 'stepmother', 'happy', 'order', 'get', 'money', 'attend', 'Princeton', 'dream', 'text', 'message', 'secret', 'admirer', 'who', 'regular', 'basis', 'best', 'friend', 'Carter', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'attend', 'school', 's', 'Halloween', 'dance', 'incognito', 'where', 'Sam', 'set', 'meet', 'secret', 'admirer', 'first', 'time', 'Dressed', 'never-before-been-worn', 'wedding', 'gown', 'mask', 'was', 'loaned', 'friends', 'including', 'fairy', 'god-mother', 'Rhonda', 'played', 'Regina', 'King', 'who', 'worked', 'diner', 'Sam', 'was', 'child', 'Sam', 'ready', 'meet', 'Prince', 'Charming.When', 'Sam', 'secret', 'admirer', 'non', 'other', 'popular', 'quarterback', 'Austin', 'Ames', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'sure', 'anything', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'out', 'why', 'would', 'most', 'popular', 'boy', 'school', 'be', 'interested', 'play', '20', 'Questions', '10', 'Austin', 'things', 'just', 'when', 'lift', 'mask', 'discover', 'true', 'identity', 'Sam', 's', 'cell', 'rings', 'away', 'leaving', 'cell', 'phone', 'Austin', 'searching', 'school', 'discover', 'Cinderella', 's', 'identity', 'Austin', 'jock-popular', 'boy', 'surface', 'longs', 'be', 'writer', 'attend', 'Princeton', 'dad', 'be', 'USC', 'man', 'can', 'convince', 'elusive', 'Sam', 'herself', 'when', 'fellow', 'seniors', 'discover', 'who', 'Austin', 's', 'Cinderella', 'really', 'things', 'could', 'get', 'ugly', 'one', 'cleanest', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'ages', 'really', 'language', 'strong', 'words', 'were', 'used', 'deity', 'caught', 'minimal', 'content', 'issues', 'definitely', 'family-friendly', 'young', 'child', 'friendly', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'mildly', 'implied', 'one', 'instance', 'young', 'man', 'off', 'young', 'woman', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'are', 'up', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'making', 'out', 'nearby', 'Other', 'only', 'objectionable', 'elements', 'come', 'things', 'sisters', 'fighting', 'small', 'amount', 'cleavage', 'son', 'going', 'father', 's', 'wishes', 'teenagers', 'taunting', 'other', 'mild', 'crude', 'humor', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'who', 'egotistical', 'constantly', 'concerned', 'appearance.The', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'cute', 'clean', 'fairy', 'tale', 'elements', 'also', 'take', 'realistic', 'slant', 'course', 'secret', 'admirer', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'popular', 'boy', 'school', 'bit', 'too', 'fairy', 'tale', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'pulled', 'off', 'such', 'way', 'was', 'nicely', 'surprised', 'm', 'not', 'sure', 'believe', 'mask', 'Sam', 'wears', 'would', 'really', 'disguise', 'so', 'much', 'Austin', 'wouldn', 't', 'recognize', 'maybe', 'was', 'completely', 'self-centered', 'jerk', 'are', 'believe', 'nice', 'guy', 'why', 'wouldn', 't', 'girl', 'gone', 'school', 'least', 'high', 'school', 'Sam', 'across', 'almost', 'too', 'unassuming', 'whipped', 'stepmother', 'times', 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'appreciate', 'patience', 'forbearance', 'dealing', 'difficult', 'family.', 'Sam', 'really', 'girl-next-door', 'love.A', 'tween', 're-make', 'update', 'classic', 'Cinderella', 'tale', 'A', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'predictable', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'diversion', 'everyday', 'crush', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'think', 'will', 'too', 'how', 'clean', 'film', 'once', 'awhile', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'storyline', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'morals', 'leave', 'out', 'muck', 'one', 'finally', 'got', 'right']",N/A

854729,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000324Y8Y,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","*1/2""A Cinderella Story"" is yet another instance of Hollywood taking a classic fairy tale from the Middle Ages and doing it up in modern dress.  This one is set in the ""Valley Girl"" world of snooty bitches and pimply-faced teens, where love blooms in internet chat rooms, and romantic encounters are reduced to an endless exchange of poorly spelled and ungrammatical text messages.The story begins in the 1994 San Fernando Valley when Sam's deliriously happy childhood is shattered by the sudden death of her father in the Northridge earthquake of all things (I wish I were kidding about this, but I`m not), leaving her to suffer under the iron fists of a wicked stepmother and two equally repulsive stepsisters.  (One wonders what Sam's lights-out time must have been, since the quake in the film occurs while her father is reading her a bedtime story - a bit odd considering that the actual shaker took place at 4:35 in the morning).  The film quickly moves to the present day, where we encounter a teenaged Sam living a life of sheer, unadulterated drudgery, while still yearning for that fairy tale prince to ride into the scene and take her away from it all.To more comfortably accommodate the contemporary setting, all the magical elements of the story have been effectively eliminated and only the romantic cliches remain.  Thus, the fairy godmother has been converted into a sassy waitress who watches over Sam and provides her with the gown she needs at that crucial Cinderella moment; the ball has become a high school Halloween dance; the glass slipper has morphed into a left-behind cell phone (though little is actually ever done with that); and Prince Charming is no longer the heir to an entire kingdom but rather a hunky quarterback with dreams of going to Princeton (ha ha) against his father`s expressed wishes.Hilary Duff doesn't exactly embarrass herself in the role of Cinderella, but she is forced to struggle with a screenplay overflowing with annoying, over-the-top stereotypes and teen romance banalities.  And the movie boasts a penultimate scene at the big championship football game that will have the girls in the audience sighing with satisfaction - and the boys groaning in pain.With one preposterous scene after another, this lame and insipid, by-the-numbers concoction is an insult to thinking teens everywhere.",1,utterly lame teen comedy,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2344,"['*1/2', 'A', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'yet', 'instance', 'Hollywood', 'taking', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'doing', 'up', 'modern', 'dress', 'one', 'set', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'world', 'snooty', 'bitches', 'pimply-faced', 'teens', 'where', 'love', 'blooms', 'internet', 'chat', 'rooms', 'romantic', 'encounters', 'are', 'reduced', 'endless', 'exchange', 'poorly', 'spelled', 'ungrammatical', 'text', 'messages.The', 'story', '1994', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'when', 'Sam', 'deliriously', 'happy', 'childhood', 'shattered', 'sudden', 'death', 'father', 'Northridge', 'earthquake', 'things', 'wish', 'were', 'kidding', 'm', 'not', 'leaving', 'suffer', 'iron', 'fists', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'two', 'equally', 'repulsive', 'stepsisters', 'One', 'what', 'Sam', 'lights-out', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quake', 'film', 'father', 'reading', 'bedtime', 'story', 'bit', 'odd', 'considering', 'actual', 'shaker', 'took', 'place', '4:35', 'morning', 'film', 'quickly', 'present', 'day', 'where', 'encounter', 'teenaged', 'Sam', 'living', 'life', 'sheer', 'unadulterated', 'drudgery', 'still', 'yearning', 'fairy', 'tale', 'prince', 'ride', 'scene', 'take', 'away', 'more', 'comfortably', 'accommodate', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'magical', 'elements', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'effectively', 'eliminated', 'only', 'romantic', 'cliches', 'remain', 'Thus', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'been', 'converted', 'sassy', 'waitress', 'who', 'Sam', 'gown', 'crucial', 'Cinderella', 'moment', 'ball', 'become', 'high', 'school', 'Halloween', 'dance', 'glass', 'slipper', 'morphed', 'left-behind', 'cell', 'phone', 'little', 'actually', 'ever', 'done', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'no', 'longer', 'heir', 'entire', 'kingdom', 'rather', 'hunky', 'quarterback', 'dreams', 'going', 'Princeton', 'ha', 'ha', 'father', 's', 'expressed', 'wishes.Hilary', 'Duff', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'embarrass', 'role', 'Cinderella', 'forced', 'struggle', 'screenplay', 'overflowing', 'annoying', 'over-the-top', 'stereotypes', 'teen', 'romance', 'banalities', 'movie', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'big', 'championship', 'football', 'game', 'will', 'have', 'girls', 'audience', 'sighing', 'satisfaction', 'boys', 'groaning', 'pain.With', 'one', 'preposterous', 'scene', 'lame', 'insipid', 'by-the-numbers', 'concoction', 'insult', 'thinking', 'teens', 'everywhere']",N/A

Stop and think - millions of dollars, the sweat and misery of countless sweatshop-enslaved peasants, and a nearly infinite amount of natural resources which we will never see again went into the production of this.... 'movie'. Some day, fifty years from now, young children will ask me why they have to live in urban pits and scrounge for food amongst the twisted rubble of the 20th century, and I'll have to tell them the truth - you have to do this because people back then wanted to watch a worthless movie starring a girl they will almost immediately forget, dedicated to a topic they don't particularly like. And those kids will open their mouths to say something, but nothing really can adequately respond to this kind of fact.Like many people, I was subjected to this trash (which hollywood execs cynically call a 'kids movie') while trapped on an airliner. I didn't expect much, and I got even less. The movie is structured in such a way that only one person - the hot-pink clad Hilary - matters. Everybody else is ancillary, and comes and goes on the screen like people you're driving in traffic with on the LA Freeway. It's the typical solipsist poison that people (mostly moms) love to pitch at modern little girls, and its no doubt why the urban world seems to be over-populated with miserable women in their late 20s who live with cats and drink too much coffee. They all grew up nursed on this kind of garbage, and now they're unable to make a go at living - just like those pathetic frat boys who can't bring themselves to try dating a real girl because they're too busy with the ones compressed in .jpg format.Pitching movies like this to little girls should be a crime on par with child pornography. It tells them lies, teaches them to be selfish and vapid, and sets them on a path of personal emptiness and sadness. If you don't think that that is a corruption of children, then maybe it's too late for us. But either way, we've still sucked up a phenomenal amount of the world's time to make poison like this.

854741,A2T14I4WE5L6GP,B000324Y8Y,Willow,"[3, 4]","The previews for the movie A CINDERELLA STORY might look like your typical preteen romantic comedy, but the actual movie is definately a step above the rest. It has some great comedic moments and unforgettable performances by Hilary Duff and Jennifer Coolidge.A CINDERELLA STORY is about Sam Montgomery (Hilary Duff, and I have to say, she is irresistable in this movie!), an intelligent, funny teenage girl that lives with her ""evil"" stepmom and stepsisters. It's Sam's dream to go to Princeton and get away from her stepmom, but by the way things are going, she doesn't think it's going to happen any time soon. Things in Sam's life aren't perfect, except for one person - a guy she meets in a Princeton chatroom, who goes by the name 'Nomad.' Sam feels like he's almost too good to be true, but she likes to hold on to the thought that this guy is perfect and that he really understands where she's coming from. So when she finally decides to meet him at their school's Halloween dance, she's in for the shock of her life.A CINDERELLA STORY isn't the best movie ever made, and it has its share of flaws, but I still consider it one of my favorites. It's a cute, fun story that captivates your attention from start to finish.Recommended to fans of the movies Freaky Friday, Raise Your Voice, and Sleepover.Overall grade - A",5,A cute spin on the age-old fairy tale,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,1325,"['previews', 'movie', 'A', 'CINDERELLA', 'STORY', 'might', 'look', 'typical', 'preteen', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actual', 'movie', 'definately', 'step', 'rest', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge.A', 'CINDERELLA', 'STORY', 'Sam', 'Montgomery', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'have', 'say', 'irresistable', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'funny', 'teenage', 'girl', 'evil', 'stepmom', 'stepsisters', 'Sam', 'dream', 'go', 'Princeton', 'get', 'away', 'stepmom', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going', ""n't"", 'think', 'going', 'happen', 'time', 'soon', 'Things', 'Sam', 'life', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'one', 'person', 'guy', 'Princeton', 'chatroom', 'who', 'name', 'Sam', 'feels', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'hold', 'thought', 'guy', 'perfect', 'really', 'where', 'coming', 'So', 'when', 'finally', 'meet', 'school', 'Halloween', 'dance', 'shock', 'life.A', 'CINDERELLA', 'STORY', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'share', 'flaws', 'still', 'consider', 'one', 'favorites', 'cute', 'fun', 'story', 'attention', 'start', 'finish.Recommended', 'fans', 'movies', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Raise', 'Your', 'Voice', 'Sleepover.Overall', 'grade', 'A']",N/A
