807322,A1JEE6BMU0F6D8,B0001I560K,"Amazon Customer ""Savanah""","[0, 0]","This DVD is one of my daughters favorites! I even lent it to my sister and her three kids won't give it back!!! I'm going to have to purchase another for their birthdays!Disney mainly chose great songs! There are a few cheesy songs from a few cheesy sequels but overall these are great. In fact one of my son's favorites is ""bibidi-bobbity-boo"", a pop remix with clips from the Cinderella 2 and Cinderella 3 movies. They love to dance to this and then ""sing"" along with the others!This Dvd is also great to put on in the background when I need to get something done and I don't feel as guilty having the TV on because my kids are dancing, singing, or doing other activities while treating the screen as a background radio. This is preferable to toddlers glued to a TV screen. I also don't experience ""Mommy DVD burnout"" a syndrome mommy's go through when a child watches or listens to the same story more than 20 times in one day!This DVD is worth the money and it's nice to see that Disney hasn't completely lost it's touch for young viewers.",5,This is more what you expect from the Disney name!,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,1043,"['DVD', 'one', 'daughters', 'even', 'lent', 'sister', 'three', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'back', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'purchase', 'birthdays', 'Disney', 'mainly', 'chose', 'great', 'songs', 'are', 'few', 'cheesy', 'songs', 'few', 'cheesy', 'sequels', 'overall', 'are', 'great', 'fact', 'one', 'son', 'favorites', 'bibidi-bobbity-boo', 'pop', 'remix', 'clips', 'Cinderella', '2', 'Cinderella', '3', 'movies', 'love', 'dance', 'then', 'sing', 'others', 'Dvd', 'also', 'great', 'put', 'background', 'when', 'need', 'get', 'something', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'having', 'TV', 'kids', 'are', 'dancing', 'singing', 'doing', 'other', 'activities', 'treating', 'screen', 'background', 'radio', 'preferable', 'toddlers', 'glued', 'TV', 'screen', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'experience', 'Mommy', 'DVD', 'burnout', 'syndrome', 'mommy', 'go', 'when', 'child', 'watches', 'listens', 'same', 'story', 'more', '20', 'times', 'one', 'day', 'DVD', 'money', 'nice', 'see', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'completely', 'lost', 'touch', 'young', 'viewers']",N/A

807324,A3RCGRXYBRKSRC,B0001I560K,"Danielle Greenhouse ""Author of What They Left...","[11, 12]","I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  She watches it on average about 3 times a day.  Most of the songs are ballads from classic movies and are excellent.  My personal favorites is ""Colors Of The Wind"" from 'Pocahontas' and ""Reflection"" from 'Mulan'  The ones I liked least were the songs from 'Mulan II' (though it does fit the description of a 'princess song' because it's sung by 3 princesses) but I found it to be really annoying, and 'Put It Together' from Cinderella 2 which is overly long and repetitive.  It also doesn't help that they repeat it twice (with movie clips then with the kids dancing).As for the extras, they're okay.  My daughter didn't care for the games, and they're definitely not for people over the age of 4 or 5.  As for the karokake section (where they show the same clips without the singing) well...unless you're kids like singing or you have the voice of Celine Dion, they/you are not going to enjoy it.  I tried to show my daughter how to sing along, and the reaction I got was...'Mama!...No Singing!'.  And since she can't read, it was pretty much useless for her to do it by herself.  Maybe older kids would enjoy this.  I can't see any sane adults doing this, though.The only section I didn't like was the dancing kids.  It was just horrible!  Basically they grabbed some kids off the street, put them in front of cheesy background and told them to dance to a bunch of not-so-great songs.  The least they could have done was get some kids that actually knew how to dance and dress them up a little bit.  Put them in the costumes they sell at Disney World and the Disney Stores, instead of them wearing T shirts and jeans.  I found it to be very unprincesslike!  As for my daughter, she is not so critical of the dancing section though she doesn't dance to it either (and she dances every song she hears on the radio and TV).I didn't particularly care of the song sung by all the princesses.  The lyrics are trite and some of singers (Cinderella and Snow White, for example) don't sound like the original singers (who I imagine must be very old or dead).The narrator and intros are a little irritiating, but I guess they're better than nothing.  My daughter doesn't mind them.All in all, I would recommend this highly for a young child, but I would not get this for an adult, even if they were into Disney videos.The thing that pushes it to a 4 star rating is Fast Play.  It's great because I don't have stand there waiting for the intro screen to pop up, so I can press 'play movie'.  Also the DVD repeats until you decide to stop it.  Just wonderful if you have a little kid.  They should have it on every DVD for children.",4,Sing Along Fun,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2682,"['bought', 'daughter', 'absolutely', 'average', '3', 'times', 'day', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'ballads', 'classic', 'movies', 'are', 'excellent', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Colors', 'Wind', 'Reflection', ""'Mulan"", 'ones', 'liked', 'least', 'were', 'songs', ""'Mulan"", 'II', 'fit', 'description', ""'princess"", 'song', 'sung', '3', 'princesses', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'annoying', ""'Put"", 'Together', 'Cinderella', '2', 'overly', 'long', 'repetitive', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'repeat', 'twice', 'movie', 'clips', 'then', 'kids', 'dancing', '.As', 'extras', ""'re"", 'okay', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'games', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'not', 'people', 'age', '4', '5', 'karokake', 'section', 'where', 'show', 'same', 'clips', 'singing', 'well', ""'re"", 'kids', 'singing', 'have', 'voice', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'they/you', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'enjoy', 'tried', 'show', 'daughter', 'how', 'sing', 'along', 'reaction', 'got', 'was', ""'Mama"", 'Singing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'useless', 'do', 'Maybe', 'older', 'kids', 'would', 'enjoy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'sane', 'adults', 'doing', 'only', 'section', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'dancing', 'kids', 'was', 'just', 'horrible', 'Basically', 'grabbed', 'kids', 'street', 'put', 'front', 'cheesy', 'background', 'told', 'dance', 'bunch', 'not-so-great', 'songs', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'get', 'kids', 'actually', 'knew', 'how', 'dance', 'dress', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'Put', 'costumes', 'sell', 'Disney', 'World', 'Disney', 'Stores', 'instead', 'wearing', 'T', 'shirts', 'jeans', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'unprincesslike', 'daughter', 'not', 'so', 'critical', 'dancing', 'section', ""n't"", 'dance', 'song', 'radio', 'TV', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'song', 'sung', 'princesses', 'lyrics', 'are', 'trite', 'singers', 'Cinderella', 'Snow', 'White', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'original', 'singers', 'who', 'imagine', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'old', 'dead', '.The', 'narrator', 'intros', 'are', 'little', 'irritiating', 'guess', ""'re"", 'better', 'nothing', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'mind', 'them.All', 'would', 'recommend', 'highly', 'young', 'child', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'adult', 'even', 'were', 'Disney', 'videos.The', 'thing', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'Fast', 'Play', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stand', 'waiting', 'intro', 'screen', 'pop', 'up', 'can', 'press', ""'play"", 'movie', 'Also', 'DVD', 'repeats', 'decide', 'stop', 'Just', 'wonderful', 'have', 'little', 'kid', 'should', 'have', 'DVD', 'children']",N/A

In recent years all new Disney's Sing Along Songs have been released on DVD featuring better quality picture and sound, featuring some previously released and unreleased songs.Now it's time for the new Disney Princess Sing Along Songs starting here with Once Upon A Dream...On this DVD you will find the following previously released (on VHS or DVD) songs:A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes (""Cinderella"") - now featuring the full version.Part Of Your World (""The Little Mermaid"")A Whole New World (""Aladdin"")Once Upon A Dream (""Sleeping Beauty"")Colors Of The Wind (""Pocahontas"")Beauty & The Beast (""Beauty & The Beast"")The songs new to Disney Sing Along Songs are:I'm Wishing/One Song (""Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs"")Reflection (""Mulan"")Like Other Girls (""Mulan II"")Sweet Wings Of Love (""Mickey, Donald & Goofy in The Three Musketeers"")The newest highlight though is ""If You Can Dream"" performed by the Disney Princesses. Apart from Cinderella and Snow White, the vocals are done by the original voices- a truly magical delight.Special features include dance alongs and Karaoke for those budding singers out there. An interesting thing to note here is that the original music is used in the Karaoke versions, unlike on most Disney Karaoke CDs and cassettes, so kids get to sing to the real music.In summary, this is a really nice selection of Disney songs. Granted some have been previously released in different Disney's Sing Along Songs incarnations, but now you get to have them all in one place in the best quality. And now with the all-new Karaoke extra, you don't just get to sing along, you get to be a real singer.Perfect for the Princess in your family.",5,The First DISNEY PRINCESS Sing Along Songs,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,1760,"['Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'were', 'originally', 'released', 'VHS', 'Video', '1980s', '1990s', 'recent', 'years', 'new', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'better', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'featuring', 'previously', 'released', 'unreleased', 'songs.Now', 'time', 'new', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'starting', 'here', 'Once', 'A', 'Dream', 'DVD', 'will', 'find', 'following', 'previously', 'released', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'songs', 'Dream', 'Wish', 'Your', 'Heart', 'Makes', 'Cinderella', 'now', 'featuring', 'full', 'version.Part', 'Your', 'World', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'A', 'Whole', 'New', 'World', 'Aladdin', 'Once', 'A', 'Dream', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Colors', 'Wind', 'Pocahontas', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'songs', 'new', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'are', ""'m"", 'Wishing/One', 'Song', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'Reflection', 'Mulan', 'Other', 'Girls', 'Mulan', 'II', 'Sweet', 'Wings', 'Love', 'Mickey', 'Donald', 'Goofy', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'newest', 'highlight', 'though', 'Can', 'Dream', 'performed', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'Apart', 'Cinderella', 'Snow', 'White', 'vocals', 'are', 'done', 'original', 'voices-', 'truly', 'magical', 'delight.Special', 'features', 'include', 'dance', 'alongs', 'Karaoke', 'budding', 'singers', 'there', 'interesting', 'thing', 'note', 'here', 'original', 'music', 'used', 'Karaoke', 'versions', 'most', 'Disney', 'Karaoke', 'CDs', 'cassettes', 'so', 'kids', 'get', 'sing', 'real', 'music.In', 'summary', 'really', 'nice', 'selection', 'Disney', 'songs', 'Granted', 'have', 'been', 'previously', 'released', 'different', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'incarnations', 'now', 'get', 'have', 'one', 'place', 'best', 'quality', 'now', 'all-new', 'Karaoke', 'extra', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'sing', 'along', 'get', 'be', 'real', 'singer.Perfect', 'Princess', 'family']",N/A
807329,ACC8K30ZFCB0M,B0001I560K,Lisa Dawn,"[12, 15]","I ordered this DVD for the footage, and only the footage.  The songs and scenes presented on this DVD are beautiful and timeless.  However, the DVD itself is far from a masterpiece.I found the narrator's voice rather annoying at times, the computer generated cloud animation between songs was rather trite.  I liked the old style Singalong DVDs where they had an animated host like Jiminy Cricket walking around and discussing the songs.I also didn't like where they chose to start and end the songs.  The ending of ""A Dream is a Wish"" quite clearly cuts off Cinderella as she sings the last note of the song, and I would have liked if ""A Whole New World"" started when Aladdin took Jasmine's hand and helped her onto the carpet, instead of starting it just as he begins singing.I found the ""Dancealongs"" to be absolutely horrible.  The remixed pop versions of the Disney songs sound terrible, and the children they show really aren't very good dancers.  The karaoke is nice, though, since I always like to sing along.The mini-games are quite clearly geared toward children between the ages of 3 and 8.  I would have liked at least one bonus feature that could have been enjoyable for any age group.I also didn't like how they put songs from Mulan II and Three Musketeers on the DVD, quite clearly as a marketing scheme to try to sell those movies.  I don't consider those Princess songs, since the corresponding movies were not in the theater and were only created as a cheap way of making more money.Finally, the additional song, ""If You Can Dream"" has gorgeous instrumentals, and most of the singing is lovely, except the impersonators they got for Cinderella and Aurora.  They sound NOTHING like the character's they're trying to impersonate!  The special effects are lovely, but I was disappointed that they only used already-existing scenes from the Princess movies.  I was hoping to see some original animation.So to conclude, if you are expecting it to be a well-made DVD, you will be disappointed, but if you just want to be able to watch the songs from your favorite Princess movies like I did, I suppose it is worth it as long as you don't expect anything more from it.",4,Wonderful songs on a not-so-wonderful DVD,1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,2179,"['ordered', 'DVD', 'footage', 'only', 'footage', 'songs', 'scenes', 'presented', 'DVD', 'are', 'beautiful', 'timeless', 'However', 'DVD', 'far', 'masterpiece.I', 'found', 'narrator', 'voice', 'rather', 'annoying', 'times', 'computer', 'generated', 'cloud', 'animation', 'songs', 'was', 'rather', 'trite', 'liked', 'old', 'style', 'Singalong', 'DVDs', 'where', 'had', 'animated', 'host', 'Jiminy', 'Cricket', 'walking', 'around', 'discussing', 'songs.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'where', 'chose', 'start', 'end', 'songs', 'ending', 'A', 'Dream', 'Wish', 'quite', 'clearly', 'cuts', 'off', 'Cinderella', 'last', 'note', 'song', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'A', 'Whole', 'New', 'World', 'started', 'when', 'Aladdin', 'took', 'Jasmine', 'hand', 'helped', 'carpet', 'instead', 'starting', 'just', 'singing.I', 'found', 'Dancealongs', 'be', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'remixed', 'pop', 'versions', 'Disney', 'songs', 'sound', 'terrible', 'children', 'show', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'dancers', 'karaoke', 'nice', 'though', 'always', 'sing', 'along.The', 'mini-games', 'are', 'quite', 'clearly', 'geared', 'children', 'ages', '3', '8', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'least', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'age', 'group.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'put', 'songs', 'Mulan', 'II', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'DVD', 'quite', 'clearly', 'marketing', 'scheme', 'try', 'sell', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Princess', 'songs', 'corresponding', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'theater', 'were', 'only', 'created', 'cheap', 'way', 'making', 'more', 'money.Finally', 'additional', 'song', 'Can', 'Dream', 'gorgeous', 'instrumentals', 'most', 'singing', 'lovely', 'impersonators', 'got', 'Cinderella', 'Aurora', 'sound', 'NOTHING', 'character', ""'re"", 'trying', 'impersonate', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'lovely', 'was', 'disappointed', 'only', 'used', 'already-existing', 'scenes', 'Princess', 'movies', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'original', 'animation.So', 'conclude', 'are', 'expecting', 'be', 'well-made', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'songs', 'favorite', 'Princess', 'movies', 'did', 'suppose', 'worth', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'more']",N/A
