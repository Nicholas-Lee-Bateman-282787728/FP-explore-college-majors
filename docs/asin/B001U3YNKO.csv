I felt I worked hard and felt the benefits of the practice.  I did find myself not knowing which individual to look at...the one on the left is a level 3 (higher difficulty), the lady on the right was level 1 (beginner) and the instructor was level 2 (intermediate).  I found myself looking at all of them to see which level I should be doing according to what my body could do.  It was very helpful but then I found that my breathing would falter since I wasn't sure which pose to do.

The title is pretty accurate in that it is power yoga and it does make you feel good. So it is not a hard workout but it isn't easy either (I'm talking both stamina and pose difficulty here). Some days it is good to have a routine that isn't too hard on the body or brain but that makes you still feel like you have actually done something - this is it!,4,Good Not Great,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,473,"['recommendation', 'buy', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'reach', 'time', 'worth', 'having', 'shelf', 'title', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'power', 'yoga', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'not', 'hard', 'workout', ""n't"", 'easy', ""'m"", 'talking', 'stamina', 'pose', 'difficulty', 'here', 'days', 'good', 'have', 'routine', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'body', 'brain', 'still', 'feel', 'have', 'actually', 'done', 'something']",N/A

The narration is smooth and soothing, even humorous at times without being smarmy, and having three levels of each pose being demonstrated is inspiring as well as instructional.I would give this DVDs five stars save for a quality issue that has already been mentioned in several other reviews:  both of my DVDs have had skip problems, in the same section (a brief blip going into cat-cow sequence).
