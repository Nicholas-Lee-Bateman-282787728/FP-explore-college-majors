In the future, I would do this on a day I was completely not interested in busting my butt or giving my all. The individual workouts are effective, but two sets of 8 reps are not going to do much for you when all is said and done. Jay Johnson also gives you way too much time to rest in between exercises. I am pretty fit and active so I followed the girl who was performing the ""advanced"" moves throughout the workout. I think the warmup was the only thing that made me break a sweat. I ended up doing a kickboxing video after this so I didn't feel like I wasted my day's workout. I really like Jay Johnson, so I was hoping this would be more hard-hitting and effective. However, I think the only way this would really do anything for anyone is if you were already a very slender person who needed minimal toning, or for an extreme beginner who has not worked out for a while. As for me, I am going to stick with Cindy Whitmarsh and Jillian Michaels. :-)",1,Don't Waste The Money,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,1074,"['was', 'two', 'seconds', 'away', 'buying', 'restrained', 'Luckily', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'OnDemand', 'so', 'tried', 'out', 'future', 'would', 'do', 'day', 'was', 'completely', 'not', 'interested', 'busting', 'butt', 'giving', 'individual', 'workouts', 'are', 'effective', 'two', 'sets', '8', 'reps', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'much', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Jay', 'Johnson', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'rest', 'exercises', 'am', 'pretty', 'fit', 'active', 'followed', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'performing', 'advanced', 'moves', 'workout', 'think', 'warmup', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'break', 'sweat', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'kickboxing', 'video', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasted', 'day', 'workout', 'really', 'Jay', 'Johnson', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'hard-hitting', 'effective', 'However', 'think', 'only', 'way', 'would', 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'anyone', 'were', 'already', 'very', 'slender', 'person', 'who', 'needed', 'minimal', 'toning', 'extreme', 'beginner', 'who', 'not', 'worked', 'out', 'while', 'am', 'going', 'stick', 'Cindy', 'Whitmarsh', 'Jillian', 'Michaels']",N/A
1268640,A2XHZEEJ0RCCC9,B002HK9IN6,Gigi Powell,"[2, 4]","I adore the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders and really looked forward to trying this. However, I was a bit disappointed. I found most of the exercises nothing new and not very challenging. I am speaking as a nearly 47-year-old woman who weighs 196 lbs at 5 feet 4!!! I did indeed sweat but it seemed like there was a lot of down time between exercises as Jay (I do love him) talked. However, I have been working out a lot for about 6 months and have lost 64 lbs so far and I've been doing it by going to the gym, eating less, and doing a lot of The Biggest Loser DVDs and Tae Bo. I am not really a beginner and I think this is probably aimed at beginners or for those who want a lighter workout on a given day when not feeling too well. There are a few things I like about the workout though. 1. The cheerleaders are gorgeous and very inspiring. They are in unbelievable great shape and that is inspirational (even though I will never look like that..lol)2. Jay is very encouraging.3. I like that they are doing the workout out on the football field. It really helps you imagine you are training with the DCC! 4. Lots of instruction on how to do the exercises properly. My final opinion is that this is (a) a workout for beginners or those who want to switch to a light workout (b)Not for anyone who wants something hard core which is what the words ""boot camp"" brings to mind for me.....I was hoping to find a DCC workout that actually teaches basic routines they do during game time. Now, THAT is something I would definitely buy and KNOW would kick my over-40 behind! ;)",3,Probably for beginners,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1568,"['adore', 'Dallas', 'Cowboy', 'Cheerleaders', 'really', 'looked', 'forward', 'trying', 'However', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'found', 'most', 'exercises', 'nothing', 'new', 'not', 'very', 'challenging', 'am', 'speaking', 'nearly', '47-year-old', 'woman', 'who', '196', 'lbs', '5', 'feet', '4', 'did', 'indeed', 'sweat', 'seemed', 'was', 'lot', 'down', 'time', 'exercises', 'Jay', 'do', 'love', 'talked', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'lot', '6', 'months', 'have', 'lost', '64', 'lbs', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'going', 'gym', 'eating', 'less', 'doing', 'lot', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'DVDs', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'beginner', 'think', 'probably', 'aimed', 'beginners', 'who', 'want', 'lighter', 'workout', 'given', 'day', 'when', 'not', 'feeling', 'too', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'like', 'workout', '1', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'very', 'inspiring', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'great', 'shape', 'inspirational', 'even', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'that..lol', '2', 'Jay', 'very', 'encouraging.3', 'like', 'are', 'doing', 'workout', 'out', 'football', 'field', 'really', 'imagine', 'are', 'training', 'DCC', '4', 'Lots', 'instruction', 'how', 'do', 'exercises', 'properly', 'My', 'final', 'opinion', 'workout', 'beginners', 'who', 'want', 'switch', 'light', 'workout', 'b', 'Not', 'anyone', 'who', 'something', 'hard', 'core', 'what', 'words', 'boot', 'camp', 'brings', 'mind', '..I', 'was', 'hoping', 'find', 'DCC', 'workout', 'actually', 'basic', 'routines', 'do', 'game', 'time', 'Now', 'THAT', 'something', 'would', 'definitely', 'buy', 'KNOW', 'would', 'kick', 'over-40']",N/A

The exercises are easy to follow and there are beginner, intermediate and advanced options for each.  I definitely lost weight and inches when doing this dvd 3 times a week.

He clearly likes the sound of his own voice and has a habit of throwing in ridiculous lines such as &#34;Some people drive Ferraris, we live in ours.&#34;  Ok?
