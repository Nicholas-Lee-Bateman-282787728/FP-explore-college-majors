The story line was weak the way they played it seemed unoriginal poorly thought out. Personally I would not recommend this movie but depends on others thoughts as they may like it.As for Tidal Wave it was okay Not totally original in conception in Idea but passable and pleasant to watch. The acting of the players was okay as far as I was concerned and worked well in the movie. Over all I thought the movie played out well and definitely worth having as I watch it periodically watch over again every so often as its part of my collection of disaster movies.,3,My thoughts as I over looked these movies.,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,697,"['Package', 'arrived', 'time', 'was', 'predicted', 'excellent', 'condition', 'Killer', 'wave', 'was', 'boring', 'hum', 'drum', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'drag', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'weak', 'way', 'played', 'seemed', 'unoriginal', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'Personally', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'others', 'thoughts', 'may', 'like', 'it.As', 'Tidal', 'Wave', 'was', 'Not', 'totally', 'original', 'conception', 'Idea', 'passable', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'acting', 'players', 'was', 'okay', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'worked', 'well', 'movie', 'thought', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'well', 'definitely', 'worth', 'having', 'watch', 'periodically', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'so', 'often', 'part', 'collection', 'disaster', 'movies']",N/A

I thought it would be fun for its type, but it is not.I had seen Killer Wave before and this one is fun for its type. However, this version is cropped on top and bottom, and the composition looks cramped. It's uncomfortable to watch. You can tell there is business we were supposed to see but cannot see because it's below frame because of the cropping.Occasionally in this movie there are frames consisting of multiple images in separate boxes of differing size above and below. Those frames are not cropped on top and bottom, and there are wide black areas on the left and right, proving that the original intention for this film was a 4:3 aspect ratio.I know there are many apologists on Amazon who defend the reprehensible practice of cropping to fit modern screens, and it would be amusing to hear them rationalize this one.

The only complaint is that both movies have almost the same storyline.  It's like one is a rip-off from the other, although one is more interesting than the other.The ""boring one"" will seem to have finished in the middle of the movie because the credits appear mid-movie.

1605276,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00A2XQTAU,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Tidal Wave No Escape & Killer Wave were both written and co-produced by Tedi Sarafian.  The original film (Tidal Wave No Escape) first aired on TV in 1997.  The subsequent miniseries (Killer Wave) aired in 2007.  It's obvious that the latter movie was an unnecessary remake, keeping most of the same elements as the first (just dragging them out for the sake of time in the miniseries version).  Neither of these movies have content worth bragging about.  The gist of both stories concern madmen out to destroy coastal communities by producing tsunamis and blaming these acts of terrorism on a sap (Corbin Bernsen in the first film, Angus MacFadyen in the second).  Wrongly accused, these idiots spend the bulk of the movie(s) on the run while trying to uncover who's really behind the destruction.  Greed for fame and power is the supposed reasons supporting these actions.  The villains in both movies are obvious at the outset.  The villain in the first movie only had one sidekick, in the miniseries there were subordinates all over the place killing people like crazy.  Along for the ride in both projects were two women incapable of brewing a good cup of coffee (Julianne Phillips in the first movie and Karine Vanasse in the second).  The main differences in these two projects, besides the cast, is the overriding sense of hysteria in the first movie and a peculiar lack of urgency in the second.  I was totally underwhelmed by both and thought it more than a little redundant to film the same stupid story twice.  It didn't improve with the retelling.  I'm not keeping either to watch again.",2,Bored twice,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,1600,"['Tidal', 'Wave', 'No', 'Escape', 'Killer', 'Wave', 'were', 'written', 'co-produced', 'Tedi', 'Sarafian', 'original', 'film', 'Tidal', 'Wave', 'No', 'Escape', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', '1997', 'subsequent', 'miniseries', 'Killer', 'Wave', 'aired', '2007', 'obvious', 'latter', 'movie', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'remake', 'keeping', 'most', 'same', 'elements', 'first', 'just', 'dragging', 'out', 'sake', 'time', 'miniseries', 'version', 'movies', 'have', 'content', 'worth', 'bragging', 'about', 'gist', 'stories', 'concern', 'madmen', 'out', 'destroy', 'coastal', 'communities', 'producing', 'tsunamis', 'blaming', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'sap', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'first', 'film', 'Angus', 'MacFadyen', 'second', 'Wrongly', 'accused', 'idiots', 'spend', 'bulk', 'movie', 'run', 'trying', 'uncover', 'who', 'really', 'destruction', 'Greed', 'fame', 'power', 'supposed', 'reasons', 'supporting', 'actions', 'villains', 'movies', 'are', 'obvious', 'outset', 'villain', 'first', 'movie', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'sidekick', 'miniseries', 'were', 'subordinates', 'place', 'killing', 'people', 'crazy', 'ride', 'projects', 'were', 'two', 'women', 'incapable', 'brewing', 'good', 'cup', 'coffee', 'Julianne', 'Phillips', 'first', 'movie', 'Karine', 'Vanasse', 'second', 'main', 'differences', 'two', 'projects', 'cast', 'overriding', 'sense', 'hysteria', 'first', 'movie', 'peculiar', 'lack', 'urgency', 'second', 'was', 'totally', 'underwhelmed', 'thought', 'more', 'little', 'redundant', 'film', 'same', 'stupid', 'story', 'twice', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'retelling', ""'m"", 'not', 'keeping', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
