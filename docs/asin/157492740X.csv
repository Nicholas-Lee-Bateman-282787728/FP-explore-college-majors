When the corn came and they tasted it they somehow knew exactly how to eat the kernels.

You just have to first remember that this is BASED ON AN EPIC POEM...thus, you have to watch it that way, like a story-story rather than a film-story--and somehow they pull it off without disconnecting (at least for me). Litefoot as Hiawatha might initially seem like he was strangely casted, but he's understated and convincing--definitely earned his role (and it's too bad he doesn't get more work these days). Adam Beach is great as the quirky BFF.Sheila Tousey was miscast in my opinion (she was too young at the time to play a good grandmother role--clearly Tantoo was already booked), and while Irene Bedard is good (and looking smokin hot, I might add--I say this objectively as a fellow woman), I wasn't sure I was digging her take on Minnehaha. Also, the context--these 2 white trapper dudes being told the story by Sheila and Gordon--was jarring in the beginning, but somehow it eases into itself and it's not a problem. Overall, it's a very, very enjoyable film. Mad props for being successfully unHollywood and original on a low budget--and still being highly entertaining.",4,Surprisingly good.,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1169,"['will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cuppa', 'tea', 'personally', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'just', 'have', 'first', 'remember', 'BASED', 'ON', 'AN', 'EPIC', 'POEM', 'thus', 'have', 'watch', 'way', 'story-story', 'rather', 'film-story', 'somehow', 'pull', 'off', 'disconnecting', 'least', 'Litefoot', 'Hiawatha', 'might', 'initially', 'seem', 'was', 'strangely', 'casted', 'understated', 'convincing', 'definitely', 'earned', 'role', 'too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'work', 'days', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'great', 'quirky', 'BFF.Sheila', 'Tousey', 'was', 'miscast', 'opinion', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'time', 'play', 'good', 'grandmother', 'role', 'clearly', 'Tantoo', 'was', 'already', 'booked', 'Irene', 'Bedard', 'good', 'looking', 'smokin', 'hot', 'might', 'add', 'say', 'objectively', 'fellow', 'woman', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'digging', 'take', 'Minnehaha', 'Also', 'context', '2', 'white', 'trapper', 'dudes', 'being', 'told', 'story', 'Sheila', 'Gordon', 'was', 'jarring', 'beginning', 'somehow', 'not', 'problem', 'Overall', 'very', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Mad', 'being', 'successfully', 'unHollywood', 'original', 'low', 'budget', 'still', 'being', 'highly', 'entertaining']",N/A
