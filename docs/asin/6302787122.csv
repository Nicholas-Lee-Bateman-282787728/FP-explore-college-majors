334184,A1RLCTTMK0OAOF,6302787122,Aglae J. Demizrahi,"[18, 20]","SommersbySet in the aftermath of the Civil War, Jack Sommersby (Richard Gere) returns, after about six years, to the town of Vine Hill, Tennessee, to find his plantation and house devastated by the ravages of war.  Additionally, he encounters his beautiful  wife Lauren Sommersby (Jodie Foster), who is actually engaged to another fellow. Sommersby returns as a completely different, loving, working, and caring person, and makes everyone believe he is back. In fact, his romantic relationship with Lauren achieves its most sublime point.  He convinces the town to grow tobacco to get out of the wreckage and devastation and is quite successful at that.  He even sells pieces of land to dark people to work with.Everything seems fine until the moment that he is arrested and sent to trail for supposedly killing a man. At this precise moment, his identity is utterly challenged.  He is hypothetically not Jack Sommersby, but some other murderer called Townsend.  Judie Foster does a superb job at trying to convince the Judge and the Jury that he is not in fact her husband giving away even intimate details.  However, Jack himself does the contrary since for him his love for his children and wife and the honor involved are more important than life itself.I am not about to convey the end of the story. I will only say that this is a great DVD to watch and will leave you wondering who is Jack Sommersby indeed.By the way, the performances of Richard Gere and Judie Foster are both outstanding, and this is a DVD that you will never forget until the end of your life!",5,It will leave you wondering who Sommersby is indeed!!,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,1569,"['SommersbySet', 'aftermath', 'Civil', 'War', 'Jack', 'Sommersby', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'returns', 'six', 'years', 'town', 'Vine', 'Hill', 'Tennessee', 'find', 'plantation', 'house', 'devastated', 'ravages', 'war', 'Additionally', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Lauren', 'Sommersby', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'actually', 'engaged', 'fellow', 'Sommersby', 'completely', 'different', 'loving', 'working', 'caring', 'person', 'everyone', 'believe', 'back', 'fact', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Lauren', 'most', 'sublime', 'point', 'town', 'grow', 'tobacco', 'get', 'wreckage', 'devastation', 'quite', 'successful', 'even', 'pieces', 'land', 'dark', 'people', 'work', 'with.Everything', 'fine', 'moment', 'arrested', 'sent', 'trail', 'supposedly', 'killing', 'man', 'precise', 'moment', 'identity', 'utterly', 'challenged', 'hypothetically', 'not', 'Jack', 'Sommersby', 'other', 'murderer', 'called', 'Townsend', 'Judie', 'Foster', 'superb', 'job', 'trying', 'convince', 'Judge', 'Jury', 'not', 'fact', 'husband', 'giving', 'away', 'even', 'intimate', 'details', 'However', 'Jack', 'contrary', 'love', 'children', 'wife', 'honor', 'involved', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'life', 'itself.I', 'am', 'not', 'convey', 'end', 'story', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'who', 'Jack', 'Sommersby', 'indeed.By', 'way', 'performances', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Judie', 'Foster', 'are', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'end', 'life']",N/A

I went in not expecting much- Richard Gere has a bad track record and I'd never really heard of this movie-but was pleasantly surprised and very drawn in by the love story and the mystery. Great chemistry between Richard Gere and Jodie Foster illuminates an already strong plot, not to mention their great acting. This is the best acting that I have seen Richard Gere put out so far, and in this movie there's everything to catch and hold a viewer's attention-passion, romance, suspense, fighting, even a trial. That is not to say that it is a loud movie-it's not, which explains its relative obscurity. But it has something for everyone, both the males and the females. And I especially appreciated the fact that it did not fall all over itself with the love story-that is the center of the movie but in the end it's the story of two people, not of their love, which is the way it shoudl be. Delicate, crafted, and oddly moving, it ends with a bittersweet ending that lifts this movie into one of the best movies of its kind that I've seen.",4,One of the best romantic dramas I've ever seen,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,1059,"['Intense-loved', 'went', 'not', 'expecting', 'much-', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'bad', 'track', 'record', ""'d"", 'never', 'really', 'heard', 'movie-but', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'very', 'drawn', 'love', 'story', 'mystery', 'Great', 'chemistry', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'already', 'strong', 'plot', 'not', 'mention', 'great', 'acting', 'best', 'acting', 'have', 'seen', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'put', 'out', 'so', 'far', 'movie', 'everything', 'catch', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention-passion', 'romance', 'suspense', 'fighting', 'even', 'trial', 'not', 'say', 'loud', 'movie-it', 'not', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'something', 'everyone', 'males', 'females', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'story-that', 'center', 'movie', 'end', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'not', 'love', 'way', 'shoudl', 'be', 'Delicate', 'crafted', 'oddly', 'moving', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

My wife belongs to it, which is shocking to me since she's not really one to embrace the period films and so her adoration of this particular film is baffling to me, especially since I tend to love this genre and I absolutely hate this film.  Stilted due to poor pacing issues and numbing due to absurdity, `Sommersby' offers up an intriguing premise and some provoking themes but fails to tie them together or flesh them out in a way that feels substantial and influential.  Instead, the film's lack of true character and the abominable performances by some in the central cast cause me to shake my head in aggravation.  Jodie Foster is very good here, but she can't carry this film all on her own.  Pullman is horrific and Richard Gere struggles to present his character to the audience.

So this film has to be doing something right to receive such approvals.  Admittedly the film was supported by strong performance from its star actors like Jodie Foster, which managed to rescue a film with unbelievable plot from a total flop to a mildly enjoyable film.  I happened to have watched this film's French predecessor, &lt;Return of Martin Guerre&gt; during a Film history class before I watched this film, and I couldn't help but notice the subtle but important changes to the overall plot of the original film, and I don't mean the change in historical and cultural setting.  The original French film was essentially a historical drama with imperfect characters, including the man who claimed to be Martin Guerre, who proved to be a good lover but a flawed man when it comes to greed.  In the Hollywoodized version of &lt;Sommersby&gt;, the man who claimed to be Jack Sommersby was a perfect hero whose only flaw was his general antipahty towards Confederate cause during the time he served in the Confederate army - hardly a condemnable flaw.To me all this reinforce a general observation - for Hollywood, films are essentially escapism, even when it attempts to deal with real issues that have no quick solutions.  Escapsim exist as well outside Hollywood (eg. think of the countless HongKong films and Bollywood films you hear about...), but for a significant number of French filmmakers, film is about an honest portrayal of reallity in all its glories and ugliness.  It is a confrontation, a meditation.  The room exists for imperfect ending, for plot driven films, for mysteries unresolved.  For some moviegoers, this can be quite unsettling and over-confrontational.  For others however, this approach carries more integrity, because life usually has imperfect endings, filled with ordinary people, with mysteries unresolved.To illustrate my point further, consider the film &lt;Ransom&gt; starring Mel Gibson.  Near the end of the film, we sees the head kidnapper, who was himself a police officer, shooting the other criminal accomplice and turned himself into a &quot;rescuer&quot; instead.  Had this been a French film, this would be the &quot;perfect&quot; ending.  Instead, film goes on, with a typical Mel Gibson action scene in the end.&lt;Sommersby&gt; unfortunately is simply one of the many symptoms of a modern Hollywoodism that threatens to turn the film industry into bland and uninteresting escapism.",2,A symptom of Hollywoodism,1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,2626,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'surprised', 'read', 'how', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'Amazon', 'customers', '12', '13', 'so', 'far', 'given', 'film', 'glowing', 'review', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'So', 'film', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'receive', 'such', 'approvals', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'was', 'supported', 'strong', 'performance', 'star', 'actors', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'managed', 'rescue', 'film', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'total', 'flop', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'happened', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'French', 'predecessor', 'lt', 'Return', 'Martin', 'Guerre', 'gt', 'Film', 'history', 'class', 'watched', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'subtle', 'important', 'changes', 'overall', 'plot', 'original', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'change', 'historical', 'cultural', 'setting', 'original', 'French', 'film', 'was', 'essentially', 'historical', 'drama', 'imperfect', 'characters', 'including', 'man', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'Martin', 'Guerre', 'who', 'proved', 'be', 'good', 'lover', 'flawed', 'man', 'when', 'greed', 'Hollywoodized', 'version', 'lt', 'Sommersby', 'gt', 'man', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'Jack', 'Sommersby', 'was', 'perfect', 'hero', 'only', 'flaw', 'was', 'general', 'antipahty', 'towards', 'Confederate', 'cause', 'time', 'served', 'Confederate', 'army', 'hardly', 'condemnable', 'flaw.To', 'reinforce', 'general', 'observation', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'are', 'essentially', 'escapism', 'even', 'when', 'deal', 'real', 'issues', 'have', 'quick', 'solutions', 'Escapsim', 'exist', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'eg', 'think', 'countless', 'HongKong', 'films', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'hear', 'significant', 'number', 'French', 'filmmakers', 'film', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'reallity', 'glories', 'ugliness', 'confrontation', 'meditation', 'room', 'imperfect', 'ending', 'plot', 'driven', 'films', 'mysteries', 'unresolved', 'moviegoers', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'unsettling', 'over-confrontational', 'others', 'however', 'approach', 'more', 'integrity', 'life', 'usually', 'imperfect', 'endings', 'filled', 'ordinary', 'people', 'mysteries', 'unresolved.To', 'illustrate', 'point', 'further', 'consider', 'film', 'lt', 'Ransom', 'gt', 'starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'end', 'film', 'sees', 'head', 'kidnapper', 'who', 'was', 'police', 'officer', 'shooting', 'other', 'criminal', 'accomplice', 'turned', 'quot', 'rescuer', 'quot', 'instead', 'Had', 'been', 'French', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'ending', 'Instead', 'film', 'typical', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'action', 'scene', 'end.', 'lt', 'Sommersby', 'gt', 'unfortunately', 'simply', 'one', 'many', 'symptoms', 'modern', 'Hollywoodism', 'turn', 'film', 'industry', 'bland', 'uninteresting', 'escapism']",N/A

Some are successful, some are not (Intersection)--this film is probably one of his best.  Based on the film, ""The Return of Martin Guerre"", which was also made into a Broadway musical, the story is about an Civil war vet who returns home after many years and resurrects his romance with his wife (Foster) who suspects he may not be who he really is, since before the war their relationship was at a stalemate.  Also she was being courted by a long time suitor (Bill Pullman) who is warily suspicious of him being who he is.  In the interim though he attempts to re-build the broken town by persuading the townspeople to plant tobacco rather than cotton.  Of course, there is a plot reversal in the story which challenges his identity and integrity to the limit.  I won't go too much into detail on this point but Gere & Foster deliver graceful performances as the ill-fated couple and Bill Pullman etches more than a portrayal of a villain but a man who drawn to extremes in his quest for the love of Laurel (Foster).

This little town and its one plantation gets its master back but he is different. The community, blacks and whites together, is going to invest all it has to re-plant the plantation in ... tobacco. A collective enterprise coming from the southerners themselves. That is a modern vision, probably not what really happened. No carpetbaggers, just plain more or less honest southerners who want to live and who want their community to find a new future, and this community is able to accept the two racial groups working together and the Blacks to become landowners. The Ku Klux Klan is shown as rather feeble. It probably was a lot harsher, if we believe history books. An identity imbroglio and a murder accusation later the main hero is going to be hanged. He is tried by a jury in a court presided by a black judge. I find that a little bit fast, hardly two or three years after the Civil War, and the judge is in his fifties. Modern rewriting too.

Jack returns home after several years a changed man, the abuser he used to be was now a loving caring human being.  But are the changes really changes or a totally different person.  This movie never gives a direct answer as to the identity of Jack.  Reflecting on the movie over and over, I weigh all the evidence.  When &quot;Jack&quot; is first arrested, Laurel asks him to tell her the truth no matter what it is and she will stand by him.  He tells her he did not committ the murder.  Yet we know it was the real Jack sommersby who did committ the murder.  If this man is the genuine person we think he is, then that would conclude he is really not &quot;Jack&quot; because &quot;Jack&quot; is a murderer.  Yet he is determined to tell the court that he is the real &quot;Jack&quot; even if it means death.  This proves that he is the caring man we think he is because if he decided to save his life and be Horis Townsend,  his signiture would be a forgery and his community would loose everything.  Evidence would still support that he is not &quot;Jack&quot; in my mind because if he were the real &quot;Jack&quot; he lied to his wife about being a murderer, but then in privacy when she asks him who he really is, he say he is &quot;Jack&quot;.  The pieces don't fit and I am confused.  I think the purpose here is for each of us to decide who &quot;Jack&quot; really is.  Finally, one element that was not even concidered in the movie is that if Horis Townsend and Jack Sommersby looked exactly alike, couldn't it have been possible that Horis Townsend was the murderer and those around him believed it was Jack Sommersby??  That would fit because that would mean Jack was telling the truth to his wife AND is the real Jack Sommersby.

334215,A159M3CTAQJ19V,6302787122,Life Enthusiast,"[10, 14]","This movie is just a rehash of a really interesting French movie staring Gerard Depardieu about a real story that has been adapted a lot and fascinated historians for centuries.I really say if you don't know the story, and sadly the AWFUL Amazon review is intent on doing its best to destroy that experience for you, then this is a case when the French version, the cinematic original, is really the one to watch first.  You'll barely notice the subtitles or realize its not English, it's so fascinating.  It's like an Akira Kurosawa (Japanese) film in that respect, the language is no barrier whatsoever.What's so amazing in the French film is you're dealing with a real story straight from a Medieval court case.  And it makes so much more sense when you see the essence of the mystery at hand.  In real context rather than the phony Civil War version, the tale is quite mesmerizing.  In its proper setting, the conclusion is also quite realistic and well done.By the ugly business of the Hollywood rehash you get the tiresome lack of exposure to the original and a melodrama instead of a well acted, interesting piece of history that fascinated literary lions, historians, a Princeton professor, as well as dramatists for over 500 years.  In the French version, you get the most famous French actor in a fine role and you get Medieval France in 1556 which is where it all began.  It's a heck of a tale, but what's even better is following up the movie with a bit of the real history.Even a quick Google search, after watching The Return of Martin Guerre, will provide you with an amazing tale.  You'll find out the way this story captured people's imaginations for so long, and that there are other versions that transport the idea to other cultures (like Germany, in the Black Forest).I'd say skip the melodramtic Hollywood version, and go for the real historical drama set in France with the French movie.  Then, seeing the other versions, including Somersby if you like, and finding out about the Medieval court case at the center becomes all the more interesting.Sometimes, it more fun to try to get closer to the truth first.

It is about human spirit and about human nature and how people lives can interact with each other. And a person can find happiness if it is only for a short matter of time.Jack Sommersby has came back from the war after six years of abstinence. In this time, no one has heard from him until he shows up. And when he does, his wife Laurel honor him by not leaving his side.Laurel is taken by surprise by this &quot;new&quot; Jack Sommersby. The &quot;old&quot; Jack Sommersby was a drunk, gambler, abuser, and care for no one himself and only himself. Laurel instantly fall for the new Jack, someone who she always wanted and always wanted to fall in love with.The question pops up in her mind and everyone else's: Can a man really change over six years from a tyrant to a loving saint? Or does he really appears to be who everyone thinks that they know?Sommersby is about unconditional love, and it is about a man that brings joy and renewal into the lives for others.

What a movie! She has the most &quot;southern&quot; accent of the two lead characters, and although she is a little unbelievable as a field worker, there is sensational chemistry between Foster as &quot;Laurel Sommersby&quot; and her civil war veteran husband, played by strikingly handsome Richard Gere.This movie is not accurate in all its historical details, for instance, everyone is too clean and well-washed to have been working in the hot fields all day, given the state of personal hygiene at the time. And Gere is just TOO handsome and manly to have spent half a dozen years withering away in a cell as a civil war POW. And the townspeople are soooo easily moved to community action. They are just a mite too credulous given the war-time setting.But if you prefer dreamy historical romance to stark reality, you will indeed enjoy this film. The narrative progresses without any slow spots from the moment the opening credits roll and we see Gere aka Sommersby burying his dead partner. Then he walks and walks, through the lush scenery of the war-ravaged south, until the viewer is as ready for &quot;home&quot; as he must have been relieved to finally arrive. Greeted like a treasured hero by the townspeople, he is then taken in by a skeptical wife despite not a word between them for six years.With great tact and consideration, Jack Sommersby proceeds to court his wife, leading to many tantalizing moments and lots of significant looks between them. In the meantime, he devises a plan to buy seeds to  grow burley tobacco in overgrown fields on the Sommersby estate, using the labor of the townspeople. They  will not be sharecroppers, but owners, and even the &quot;coloured folk&quot; will have the option to buy, which later leads to a KKK cross-burning scene.Complications result from the fact that, during her husband's long absence, Laurel Sommersby had been keeping company with Orrin, another  veteran, and although she tells her husband she hadn't been kissed, the rival lover hovers in jealous rage, and when his chance comes to do harm to Jack Sommersby, he takes it.All along, Laurel finds herself wondering &quot;Who is this man in my kitchen?&quot; because before he went away 6 years ago, her husband was a no-good drinker and gambler who abused her and didn't love her. The man who returns to her is wholly changed, a considerate lover, a caring father, a responsible member of the community. Is he really Jack Sommersby, or an imposter?When the tobacco crops are growing well and standing tall in the fields,  the married lovers are delighting in their happiness, and just after the first baby is born, two federal marshalls  arrive to carry Jack away to Nashville be tried for murder.  I won't give away the ending, but I cried and cried all through the last 20 minutes or so of this touching romantic film.  You never do find out if &quot;Sommersby&quot; is himself or not. Either way, he has changed for the better.This is definitely an enjoyable film. If you are a fan of romantic historical romance, you will enjoy this delicious love story.",4,Beautiful historical romance with a sad ending,981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,3245,"['watching', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'quot', 'Nell', 'quot', 'where', 'speech-disturbed', 'mountain', 'woman', 'was', 'motivated', 're-watch', 'quot', 'Sommersby.', 'quot', 'What', 'actress', 'What', 'movie', 'most', 'quot', 'southern', 'quot', 'accent', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'field', 'worker', 'sensational', 'chemistry', 'Foster', 'quot', 'Laurel', 'Sommersby', 'quot', 'civil', 'war', 'veteran', 'husband', 'played', 'strikingly', 'handsome', 'Richard', 'Gere.This', 'movie', 'not', 'accurate', 'historical', 'details', 'instance', 'everyone', 'too', 'clean', 'well-washed', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'hot', 'fields', 'day', 'given', 'state', 'personal', 'hygiene', 'time', 'Gere', 'just', 'TOO', 'handsome', 'manly', 'have', 'spent', 'dozen', 'years', 'withering', 'away', 'cell', 'civil', 'war', 'POW', 'townspeople', 'are', 'soooo', 'easily', 'moved', 'community', 'action', 'are', 'just', 'mite', 'too', 'credulous', 'given', 'war-time', 'setting.But', 'prefer', 'dreamy', 'historical', 'romance', 'stark', 'reality', 'will', 'indeed', 'enjoy', 'film', 'narrative', 'progresses', 'slow', 'spots', 'moment', 'opening', 'credits', 'roll', 'see', 'Gere', 'aka', 'Sommersby', 'burying', 'dead', 'partner', 'Then', 'walks', 'lush', 'scenery', 'war-ravaged', 'south', 'viewer', 'ready', 'quot', 'home', 'quot', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'relieved', 'finally', 'arrive', 'Greeted', 'treasured', 'hero', 'townspeople', 'then', 'taken', 'skeptical', 'wife', 'not', 'word', 'six', 'years.With', 'great', 'tact', 'consideration', 'Jack', 'Sommersby', 'proceeds', 'court', 'wife', 'leading', 'many', 'tantalizing', 'moments', 'lots', 'significant', 'looks', 'meantime', 'plan', 'buy', 'seeds', 'grow', 'burley', 'tobacco', 'overgrown', 'fields', 'Sommersby', 'estate', 'using', 'labor', 'townspeople', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sharecroppers', 'owners', 'even', 'quot', 'coloured', 'folk', 'quot', 'will', 'have', 'option', 'buy', 'later', 'KKK', 'cross-burning', 'scene.Complications', 'result', 'fact', 'husband', 'long', 'absence', 'Laurel', 'Sommersby', 'had', 'been', 'keeping', 'company', 'Orrin', 'veteran', 'husband', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'kissed', 'rival', 'lover', 'hovers', 'jealous', 'rage', 'when', 'chance', 'do', 'harm', 'Jack', 'Sommersby', 'it.All', 'along', 'Laurel', 'wondering', 'quot', 'Who', 'man', 'kitchen', 'quot', 'went', 'away', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'husband', 'was', 'no-good', 'drinker', 'gambler', 'who', 'abused', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'man', 'who', 'wholly', 'changed', 'considerate', 'lover', 'caring', 'father', 'responsible', 'member', 'community', 'really', 'Jack', 'Sommersby', 'imposter', 'When', 'tobacco', 'crops', 'are', 'growing', 'well', 'standing', 'tall', 'fields', 'married', 'lovers', 'are', 'delighting', 'happiness', 'just', 'first', 'baby', 'born', 'two', 'federal', 'marshalls', 'arrive', 'carry', 'Jack', 'away', 'Nashville', 'be', 'tried', 'murder', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'cried', 'cried', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'touching', 'romantic', 'film', 'never', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'quot', 'Sommersby', 'quot', 'not', 'way', 'changed', 'better.This', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'romantic', 'historical', 'romance', 'will', 'enjoy', 'delicious', 'love', 'story']",N/A

Vincent CanbyI loved this film, hated the ending.  A southern man comes home from the Civil War and re-enters his life as Jack Sommersby. His wife, thinking he was indeed dead after 6 six years has promised herself to another. Nothing is as it was, and it never will be again. The old Southern plantation has been looted, and there is not much left but the body and souls who inhabit the place. It appears that Jack Sommersby was not the kind of man one really liked unless you were into brutality, drunkenness and slavery. But this new Jack Sommersby is a changed man, ""Got hit in my head"" he says. The neighbors and the man who was to marry his wife think something is not quite right here. But Jack Sommersby offers his family and his neighbors something they have not seen nor heard in a long time, hope. Hope of making a living and living off the land. Jack Sommersby has wormed his way into their hearts, and they love them. He has also offered his black slaves their own land, and this does not go over well with some. Visions of the KKK. But this new Jack Sommersby is not what he seems, and a trial and the courtroom soon reveal what has been and what is to come.Jodie Foster, as Laurel Sommersby, is forever more my idol-you know that with a smile or the flick of her eyes what emotion she is feeling. She is the epitome of a southern lady waiting to be undone. After two Academy Awards this may be one of her best performances. However, it is Richard Gere who steals the scenes in my opinion. This is, indeed his best performance, and he is believable as a man who wants to be someone he can be proud of. Bill Pullman who plays the man who wants Laurel's heart is a duplicitous man who will do or say anything to win Laurel back.And what about the dog, Jethro?Peter Travers has the best lines in his critique of the film,""Of special pertinence right now is the new light the film sheds on marriage and the doubts it engenders.
