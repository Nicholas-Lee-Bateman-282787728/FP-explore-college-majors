I wrote it off at first as another survival show, this time the gimmick being a husband and wife in tough situations. Then I came across Capt. Hawke's books, they're really great. This guy has seen and done it all. I checked out the show with a bit more open mindedness and really enjoy it. Hawke's role on the show is the information bank, he knows a ton and fills us in with his personality and style, his wife's role is the knowledgeable everyman, (not the squeamish female role I'd foreseen). My wife and I think Ruth is great, she's fun to watch and is a nice 'in-between' for the regular citizen and the more experienced survival/military oriented individual. One other aspect to the show we really enjoy is the human reactions throughout each episode. It gives a more realistic look at the stresses of survival between party members, even between family members in a survival situation, more so than any show I've seen. Definitely worth checking out and adding to your library.",5,very impressed,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,1025,"[""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'checked', 'show', 'wrote', 'off', 'first', 'survival', 'show', 'time', 'gimmick', 'being', 'husband', 'wife', 'tough', 'situations', 'Then', 'came', 'Capt', 'Hawke', 'books', ""'re"", 'really', 'great', 'guy', 'seen', 'done', 'checked', 'out', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'open', 'mindedness', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Hawke', 'role', 'show', 'information', 'bank', 'ton', 'personality', 'style', 'wife', 'role', 'knowledgeable', 'everyman', 'not', 'squeamish', 'female', 'role', ""'d"", 'foreseen', 'wife', 'think', 'Ruth', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'nice', ""'in-between"", 'regular', 'citizen', 'more', 'experienced', 'survival/military', 'oriented', 'individual', 'One', 'other', 'aspect', 'show', 'really', 'enjoy', 'human', 'reactions', 'episode', 'more', 'realistic', 'look', 'stresses', 'survival', 'party', 'members', 'even', 'family', 'members', 'survival', 'situation', 'more', 'so', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'adding', 'library']",Man Woman Wild

They are surrounded by cameramen and there is a base camp nearby. I also find it hard to believe that in real life anybody would be so foolish as to go on day-long hikes or snowmobile trips or boat rides with no more provisions than a tiny bottle of water and a handful of raisins - and without a lighter! However, once I got past the not-quite-realistic premises, I found myself enjoying the episodes.Unlike ""Dual Survival"", which pairs two survival experts from different backgrounds and thus different approaches to survival situations, ""Man, Woman, Wild"" is interesting because one of the characters, Mykel, is a survival expert whereas his wife, Ruth, is not.In her role as apprentice, Ruth frequently has to step out of her comfort zone. She stands for all of us who would be truly lost and in danger if we ever had to spend more than a few hours outdoors without a tent, a cooler loaded with victuals, a port-a-pottie, and an air mattress (or, preferably, a fully stocked and air-conditioned camper, or, even better, an RV!). She shows us that it is challenging, yet possible to overcome squeamishness and inhibitions and, for example, cut up and eat an armadillo that got killed by a wildfire. Yes, she can be a bit overbearing, and, yes, she squeaks and squeals a lot and carries on about snakes and bugs and things that go ""boo"" in the dark, but I can identify with her. Although I greatly admire Mykel's skills and training, to me, Ruth is the more inspiring character of the two and the hero of the show.On the other hand, she shows us that even the company of a survival expert does not guarantee survival: In the ""Mexico"" episode, she can't drink enough urine to stay hydrated; she suffers from heat exhaustion and Mykel has to call in the team medic to avoid a life-threatening situation. And ""Alaska"" would have killed them both.ETA 10/04/11:After watching a few episodes of ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" for the first time last week I need to revise the first paragraph a bit. There ARE people who are stupid enough to go on day hikes into the desert with no water or drive into a snowstorm with no snow chains on board.MWW is still a bit odd insofar as these guys always forget to bring lighters, but they never forget their survival knives, and Mykel seems to carry a pair of gloves around at all times (one has to wonder where he keeps the gloves and why there isn't room for a lighter).",4,Interesting and informative - SPOILERS,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,2498,"['Okay', 'know', 'guys', 'survival', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'emergency', 'situations', 'are', 'surrounded', 'cameramen', 'base', 'camp', 'nearby', 'also', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'real', 'life', 'anybody', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'foolish', 'go', 'day-long', 'hikes', 'snowmobile', 'trips', 'boat', 'rides', 'more', 'provisions', 'tiny', 'bottle', 'water', 'handful', 'raisins', 'lighter', 'However', 'once', 'got', 'not-quite-realistic', 'premises', 'found', 'enjoying', 'episodes.Unlike', 'Dual', 'Survival', 'two', 'survival', 'experts', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'thus', 'different', 'approaches', 'survival', 'situations', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Wild', 'interesting', 'one', 'characters', 'Mykel', 'survival', 'expert', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'not.In', 'role', 'apprentice', 'Ruth', 'frequently', 'step', 'out', 'comfort', 'zone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'lost', 'danger', 'ever', 'had', 'spend', 'more', 'few', 'hours', 'outdoors', 'tent', 'cooler', 'loaded', 'victuals', 'port-a-pottie', 'air', 'mattress', 'preferably', 'fully', 'stocked', 'air-conditioned', 'camper', 'even', 'better', 'RV', 'challenging', 'yet', 'possible', 'overcome', 'squeamishness', 'inhibitions', 'example', 'cut', 'up', 'eat', 'armadillo', 'got', 'killed', 'wildfire', 'Yes', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'overbearing', 'yes', 'lot', 'snakes', 'bugs', 'things', 'go', 'boo', 'dark', 'can', 'identify', 'greatly', 'admire', 'Mykel', 'skills', 'training', 'Ruth', 'more', 'inspiring', 'character', 'two', 'hero', 'show.On', 'other', 'hand', 'even', 'company', 'survival', 'expert', 'not', 'guarantee', 'survival', 'Mexico', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drink', 'enough', 'urine', 'stay', 'hydrated', 'heat', 'exhaustion', 'Mykel', 'call', 'team', 'medic', 'avoid', 'life-threatening', 'situation', 'Alaska', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'both.ETA', '10/04/11', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Alive', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'week', 'need', 'revise', 'first', 'paragraph', 'bit', 'ARE', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'stupid', 'enough', 'go', 'day', 'hikes', 'desert', 'water', 'drive', 'snowstorm', 'snow', 'board.MWW', 'still', 'bit', 'odd', 'insofar', 'guys', 'always', 'forget', 'bring', 'lighters', 'never', 'forget', 'survival', 'knives', 'Mykel', 'carry', 'pair', 'gloves', 'times', 'one', 'wonder', 'where', 'gloves', 'why', ""n't"", 'room', 'lighter']",Man Woman Wild
1430781,ASPER0KSPHISK,B004WO9OR0,Original Country Girl,"[13, 37]","This is one of the worst survial series I've ever seen. It comes off as somewhat contrived to begin with, and that, coupled with Ruth's constant ""Oh no I can't do that!"" and ""Oh! Be careful!"" and ""A snake, oooh a snake!"" makes this nauseating to watch. She doesn't do much for advancing the public opinion of women in the outdoors.The show seems to revolve around Mykel finding something to kill, then trying to get Ruth to kill it while she whimpers and tears up over it. For example, in one episode Mykel (stupidly) risks his neck climbing a tree to knock down a possum, telling Ruth to pin it with her spear and then kill it with her knife. So he knocks it down, Ruth runs BACKWARDS and before the possum hits the ground she's wailing ""Oh no! It's escaped! It's escaped!"" (Meaning ""I have no intentions of doing anything to try to catch this possum because it's dirty and could scratch me!)The show also falls flat on it's attempts at ""witty"" banter. At one point Ruth says to Mykel ""I know what a dirty beast you are."" and he replies ""I prefer knuckle dragger.""Terrible show all in all, as bad as that other pretend survival guy...BG, you know who you are...If you want a real survival show stick with Les Stroud, or even Dual Survival.

This show is GREAT in showing you what that would be like. The girl knows only a little about survival, and the guy knows pretty much everything. Not only is it a ""survival"" show, it can give you a small lesson on interpersonal relationships and how to handle an extreme situation where you may have to care for a loved one as well. This survival program is unique in that way, which makes for a fun and interesting way to spend your time. The two are VERY likable, and seem like very ordinary people, and like a very stable, ordinary, fun couple.The other great thing is that if you have an fairly open minded girlfriend, she will enjoy watching this show with you, as she can relate to the girl on the show, who is just perfect as a strong woman; not too over the top prissy or too in your face authoritative. She's feminine but not ""girly.""  The guy is ""manly"" but not in an overly aggressive way. The show is pretty comical at times, the way they interact, and has enough variety and exotic locations to keep things interesting. Very realistic as far as survival shows go.In all, both me and my girlfriend very much enjoyed watching this show, and I would highly recommend it to couples interested in survival shows or guys interested in survival shows that portray surviving with a loved one.
