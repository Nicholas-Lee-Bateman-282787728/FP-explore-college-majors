But they did use a bleeding tree which was a representation of the blood of Christ and the cross, and with that blood no demon could fight against it. The effects were great, there is some bad language used, but mostly from the demons, which would make it more realistic in my opinion. Overall I think it was awesome and highly recommend it, especially to your unsaved friends, which could stir up lots of questions..",5,Awesome movie!,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,558,"['truly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'only', 'downfall', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'giving', 'Jesus', 'primary', 'focus', 'Him', 'fallen', 'angels', 'are', 'subject', 'did', 'use', 'bleeding', 'tree', 'was', 'representation', 'blood', 'Christ', 'cross', 'blood', 'demon', 'could', 'fight', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'bad', 'language', 'used', 'mostly', 'demons', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'realistic', 'opinion', 'Overall', 'think', 'was', 'awesome', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'unsaved', 'friends', 'could', 'stir', 'up', 'lots', 'questions..']",N/A

After watching the trailer, I decided to plunk down the change to watch it online. It was well worth the money. Special effects were unbelievable for a low-budget Indie film. The script was good and the acting team was competent with a several strong performances. The Christian message involved was a little below the surface but the message concerning the war of the Father and His angels against the devil and his fallen angels was not exactly subliminal.

Angels and devils collide on the earths surface.  The film plods along with a jolt here and there of amature special effects that seem to be created on a MAC.  The no name casts acting is so poor its' laughable.  The producers knowing of classics such as the original ""Omen"" and ""Rosemarys Baby"" should be ashamed.
