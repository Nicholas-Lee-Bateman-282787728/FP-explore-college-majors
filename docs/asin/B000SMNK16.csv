The three major players (Doctors Welby and Kiley, and Nurse Lopez) are among some of the greatest television characters I have ever seen, and they were played to perfection by Robert Young, James Brolin, and Elena Verdugo respectively. I am glad that Shout! put out this first season's worth, and I am truly looking forward to #2 (the one where the series went into first place in the ratings and held that ranking-- the first ABC series to do so), when and if that next one comes out, and if we're lucky, the series in its entirety.

MWMD was one of my favorite TV shows when I was growing up and I hoped that it (like Hawaii Five-O and Mary Tyler Moore Show before it) would eventually be available on DVD. But after years of hoping, I thought the show was simply lost in the noise of the vintage/retro TV landscape probably never to be found. So imagine my surprise when I did a ""drive-by"" search for it today (as I had done for years) and found there was actually an item listing with a release date?!I was fortunate to have a few episodes of MWMD on video and they served as constant reminders of how good the show was, and how much I wished I could have had Dr. Welby as my primary care physician :-). But what really impressed me was how honestly the show portrayed real life, everyday people with health and human issues. And yes, occasionally kindly Dr. Welby had to be stern and put his foot down (rarely unsuccessfully) when a patient was not doing the right thing, wouldn't take his advice, etc. And sometimes, things didn't end happily, just like in real life. But in today's world of corporate medical practices, manic hospitals, insensitive and/or incompetent doctors, etc, who wouldn't want to visit Dr. Welby, Dr. Kiley, and Nurse Consuelo at their peaceful suburban office-residence, providing their personal and humane medical care? AND they even made house calls!!!I look forward to this release and hope that Shout!

1086984,AJDOJANK50QJV,B000SMNK16,D. McSherry,"[3, 3]","I remembered Marcus Welby, M.D. from seeing repeats on Cable TV in the mid-1980's, and from seeing ""A Matter of Humanities"" around 1980 as a movie on KHTV-39, an independent TV station, in Houston.  I was impressed on the compassion of this physician who took the time to know his patients so he could better serve them.  Dr. Welby was a simple man, and it's impressive that he made house calls.I'm glad to see this series released on DVD.  TV Land carried it briefly in 2001. I have watched most of the DVD's, and many episodes I watched more than once.  While there are many actors I recognized (such as Richard Thomas, Julie Adams, Heather Menzies, Susan Clark (wow - she was pretty), Joanna Cameron (she was pretty too - I remember her as Isis),  Don Stroud (with a full head of hair) and Barry Williams), I was more impressed with the story content and the exploration of medical issues.One of my favorites was the one on the high school boy with hemophilia.  I wasn't aware that the advances in treatment were made less than 40 years ago.  I know a guy who was born with hemophilia and he had to have a liver transplant because a clotting medication was infected and taken off the market.  I also liked the one on leukemia, where advances were being made through research.  I also wasn't aware that the detection of the RH-factor (discussed in one episode with a pregnant woman) was only post-World War II.  Dr. Welby told a story to Dr. Kiley about witnessing a baby's death due to the RH-factor ""complication"" as a young doctor.While much of the story content can be applied today, I do have to admit that I like seeing the old cars on the streets, like Welby's blue Chrysler New Yorker - an antique land yacht - and the old Cadillac hearse type ambulances.  Rotary phones and electric coffee percolators make for an occasional laugh, and I recall one episode where Dr. Welby has medical records sent to him from out-of-state on what looks like a huge fax machine.  It took up a whole table, and the phone has to be connected by hand to the modem.I'll have to order Season 2.  Glad to see quality shows like Marcus Welby, M.D. found a home on DVD.  Season 1 must have sold well. In my opinion, Marcus Welby, M.D. was much better than the last medical show NBC made called Trauma. I'm glad Trauma was canceled, particularly because hundreds of EMT's and paramedics sent e-mails to NBC after the first episode aired, saying they didn't appreciate the portrayal of their profession on TV.",5,Much Better Than the NBC Series Trauma,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,2493,"['remembered', 'Marcus', 'Welby', 'M.D', 'seeing', 'repeats', 'Cable', 'TV', 'mid-1980', 'seeing', 'Matter', 'Humanities', 'around', '1980', 'movie', 'KHTV-39', 'independent', 'TV', 'station', 'Houston', 'was', 'impressed', 'compassion', 'physician', 'who', 'took', 'time', 'know', 'patients', 'could', 'better', 'serve', 'Dr.', 'Welby', 'was', 'simple', 'man', 'impressive', 'made', 'house', 'calls.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'series', 'released', 'DVD', 'TV', 'Land', 'carried', 'briefly', '2001', 'have', 'watched', 'most', 'DVD', 'many', 'episodes', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'are', 'many', 'actors', 'recognized', 'such', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'Julie', 'Adams', 'Heather', 'Menzies', 'Susan', 'Clark', 'wow', 'was', 'pretty', 'Joanna', 'Cameron', 'was', 'pretty', 'too', 'remember', 'Isis', 'Don', 'Stroud', 'full', 'head', 'hair', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'story', 'content', 'exploration', 'medical', 'issues.One', 'favorites', 'was', 'one', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'hemophilia', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'advances', 'treatment', 'were', 'made', 'less', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'know', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'hemophilia', 'had', 'have', 'liver', 'transplant', 'clotting', 'medication', 'was', 'infected', 'taken', 'off', 'market', 'also', 'liked', 'one', 'leukemia', 'where', 'advances', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'research', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'detection', 'RH-factor', 'discussed', 'one', 'episode', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'was', 'only', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'Dr.', 'Welby', 'told', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Kiley', 'witnessing', 'baby', 'death', 'due', 'RH-factor', 'complication', 'young', 'doctor.While', 'much', 'story', 'content', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'today', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'like', 'seeing', 'old', 'cars', 'streets', 'Welby', 'blue', 'Chrysler', 'New', 'Yorker', 'antique', 'land', 'yacht', 'old', 'Cadillac', 'hearse', 'type', 'ambulances', 'Rotary', 'phones', 'electric', 'coffee', 'percolators', 'make', 'occasional', 'laugh', 'recall', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Welby', 'medical', 'records', 'sent', 'out-of-state', 'what', 'huge', 'fax', 'machine', 'took', 'up', 'whole', 'table', 'phone', 'be', 'connected', 'hand', 'modem.I', ""'ll"", 'have', 'order', 'Season', '2', 'Glad', 'see', 'quality', 'shows', 'Marcus', 'Welby', 'M.D', 'found', 'home', 'DVD', 'Season', '1', 'must', 'have', 'sold', 'well', 'opinion', 'Marcus', 'Welby', 'M.D', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'last', 'medical', 'show', 'NBC', 'made', 'called', 'Trauma', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Trauma', 'was', 'canceled', 'particularly', 'hundreds', 'EMT', 'paramedics', 'sent', 'e-mails', 'NBC', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'portrayal', 'profession', 'TV']","Marcus Welby, M.D.: Season 1"

Guaranteed to stir emotions within you...as well as bring a smile to your face!Even in the face of tragedy, Dr's Welby and Kiley help people to know their own self-worth and see them through whatever illnesses that may be affecting their lives. I truly wish that I had known my own personal 'Dr. Welby.'If, in fact, doctors were like the show portrayed at the time...I'm curious what happened!

It was the first network program to have more of a true medical focus, and yet it kept a good balance, interweaving the medical theme with the drama of people's storm-tossed lives. I've read that medical professionals thought highly of this show, because of its fairly accurate depiction of a general practitioner's day-to-day life.And Marcus Welby was such a likable character.

The series debut on the ABC television network in the fall of 1969 and became an instint hit not just for its remarkable acting, but for its writing of topical issues that other TV shows were afraid to touch on. Mental issues, alcoholism, and even homosexuality (although the writers did a sloppy job in portraying gays) were discussed when the series originally aired. The first season was a huge success with the series finishing at a respectful #8 in the national Nielsen numbers.The series starred former film star Robert Young as Marcus Welby and James Brolin as his young partner. Brolin is now known as Mr. Barbra Streisand.The final episode on this set entitled ""The Daredevil Gesture"" was directed by a young Steven Speilberg who directed multiple television episodes for Universal during the late sixties, including one on ""Night Gallery"" featuring Joan CrawfordThe first two seasons have seen releases on DVD by Shout! studios, but now consumers can purchase this great individual set with ten episodes from season one.The following are the episodes included along with their airdates.1.

1087009,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000SMNK16,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[4, 4]","""Marcus Welby, M.D. - Season One""  stars Robert Young as kind and caring family practitioner Dr. Marcus Welby and James Brolin as his young, motorcycle-riding associate, Dr. Steven Kiley.  The highest-rated medical drama on TV for seven consecutive seasons, ""Marcus Welby"" aired on ABC from 1969 to 1976, paving the way for such popular hits as ""House, M.D.,"" ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and ""Royal Pains.""Week after week, Dr. Welby encountered devastating disorders but confronted them with honesty and dedicated compassion.  He even made house calls.  The show reversed the common formula, with the older and wiser Welby embracing unorthodox treatments while younger Dr. Kiley had the tried-and-true, straitlaced approach.The seven-disc set contains 26 episodes including one -- ""The Daredevil Gesture"" -- directed by Steven Spielberg, and the original two-hour pilot movie, ""A Matter of Humanities.  Guest stars include Anne Baxter, David Cassidy, Robert Guillaume, Vera Miles, Butch Patrick, and Richard Thomas.",4,Solid Drama About Doctor Who Makes House Calls,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1005,"['Marcus', 'Welby', 'M.D', 'Season', 'One', 'Robert', 'Young', 'kind', 'caring', 'family', 'practitioner', 'Dr.', 'Marcus', 'Welby', 'James', 'Brolin', 'young', 'motorcycle-riding', 'associate', 'Dr.', 'Steven', 'Kiley', 'highest-rated', 'medical', 'drama', 'TV', 'seven', 'consecutive', 'seasons', 'Marcus', 'Welby', 'aired', 'ABC', '1969', '1976', 'paving', 'way', 'such', 'popular', 'hits', 'House', 'M.D.', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'Week', 'week', 'Dr.', 'Welby', 'encountered', 'devastating', 'disorders', 'confronted', 'honesty', 'dedicated', 'compassion', 'even', 'made', 'house', 'calls', 'show', 'reversed', 'common', 'formula', 'older', 'wiser', 'Welby', 'embracing', 'unorthodox', 'treatments', 'younger', 'Dr.', 'Kiley', 'had', 'tried-and-true', 'straitlaced', 'approach.The', 'seven-disc', 'set', '26', 'episodes', 'including', 'one', 'Daredevil', 'Gesture', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'original', 'two-hour', 'pilot', 'movie', 'Matter', 'Humanities', 'Guest', 'include', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Butch', 'Patrick', 'Richard', 'Thomas']","Marcus Welby, M.D.: Season 1"
