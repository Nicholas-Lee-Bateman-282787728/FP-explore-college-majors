What is also interesting for those not that familiar with early 1950s TV advertising was the way in which ""Carnation Milk"" (the show's sponser) was worked into many of the episodes.  The show's ""announcer"", (often it was Harry von Zell) would drop by the house and engage in a 2-minute discussion with the other characters about the benefits of Carnation milk. To modern sensibilities it can often seem jarring, but in some instances the writers manage to work in this commercial plug in an entertaining enough fashion.

406921,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,6304197071,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[2, 2]","These early episodes of the popular TV show are simply a delight to watch. I've been watching the show on the local channel Antennae TV, which has been airing the later episodes that are more polished in quality. It's interesting to see how the show morphed during its run, surviving cast changes (Harry Von Zell replacing Bill Goodwin as announcer; multiple actors playing neighbor Harry Morton), format changes (the early ones have sponsor Carnation Milk plugging their product like crazy), and even a new on-air ""home"" set for George & Gracie.But the show's biggest asset was always George & Gracie themselves. George was the relaxed straight man, puffing on his trademark cigar, and breaking the ""fourth wall"" as he monologued directly to the audience about the latest plot point or his vaudeville days. Wry in personality & dry in humor, he could do more with less like the old pro he was. And then, there was the incomparable Gracie, who managed to make her ""dumb Dora"" role unique & endearing. As zany as her responses were, often misunderstanding a phrase or sentence & turn it on its ear, she would work what George termed her ""illogical logic"" beautifully. Although she appeared ""confused"", she was probably the sharpest tack in the room.This is definitely a time capsule of vintage TV, as networks would dare not write product placement directly into their scripts (can you imagine trying that today with the thousands of products out there? It was a simpler time back then!).An enjoyable 8 episodes with undoubtedly the world's greatest husband-and-wife comedy team!",5,"George, Gracie, and Carnation Milk",1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1578,"['early', 'episodes', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'simply', 'delight', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'local', 'channel', 'Antennae', 'TV', 'been', 'airing', 'later', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'polished', 'quality', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'morphed', 'run', 'surviving', 'cast', 'changes', 'Harry', 'Von', 'Zell', 'replacing', 'Bill', 'Goodwin', 'announcer', 'multiple', 'actors', 'playing', 'neighbor', 'Harry', 'Morton', 'format', 'changes', 'early', 'ones', 'have', 'sponsor', 'Carnation', 'Milk', 'plugging', 'product', 'crazy', 'even', 'new', 'on-air', 'home', 'set', 'George', 'Gracie.But', 'show', 'biggest', 'asset', 'was', 'always', 'George', 'Gracie', 'George', 'was', 'relaxed', 'straight', 'man', 'puffing', 'trademark', 'cigar', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'monologued', 'directly', 'audience', 'latest', 'plot', 'point', 'vaudeville', 'days', 'Wry', 'personality', 'dry', 'humor', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'less', 'old', 'pro', 'was', 'then', 'was', 'incomparable', 'Gracie', 'who', 'managed', 'make', 'dumb', 'Dora', 'role', 'unique', 'endearing', 'As', 'zany', 'responses', 'were', 'often', 'misunderstanding', 'phrase', 'sentence', 'turn', 'ear', 'would', 'work', 'what', 'George', 'termed', 'illogical', 'logic', 'beautifully', 'appeared', 'confused', 'was', 'probably', 'sharpest', 'tack', 'room.This', 'definitely', 'time', 'capsule', 'vintage', 'TV', 'networks', 'would', 'dare', 'not', 'write', 'product', 'placement', 'directly', 'scripts', 'can', 'imagine', 'trying', 'today', 'thousands', 'products', 'there', 'was', 'simpler', 'time', 'back', 'then', '.An', 'enjoyable', '8', 'episodes', 'undoubtedly', 'world', 'greatest', 'husband-and-wife', 'comedy', 'team']",The Burns and Allen Show - Collection VHS
