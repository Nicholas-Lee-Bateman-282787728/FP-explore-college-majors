I always liked the soundtrack and actually bought that before I was able to see the movie. Maybe that's why my opinion of the movie is what it is. The movie itself though is no great surprise. Dolly Parton is basically playing herself, Stallone is also basically playing himself. Everyone writes at how horrible Sly's singing is, no kidding, it's supposed to be bad! The premise of the movie is Dolly is an adored country singer in a club, she makes a bet that she can turn anyone into a country singer. Enter Stallone as a New York cab driver. She takes him back home to Tennessee and tries to teach him how to be &#34;country&#34;. He struggles with the whole concept, the walk, the talk, the singing. At no point during the movie are you supposed to believe that he CAN sing, nor are you supposed to believe that he's become &#34;country&#34;. If you like Dolly, you will love her in this movie. She pretty much just plays herself thruout. Her songs are great, she wrote all of the songs in the movie with one exception. The only song she didn't write is the wickedly funny &#34;The Day My Baby Died&#34; which is also a favorite of mine. Look, the movie is no &#34;Gone With The Wind&#34;, it doesn't pretend to be. It's just Dolly doing a lot of singing and Sly trying to keep up, nothing more, nothing less.",4,The joke is Sly can't sing!,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1382,"['Ok', 'first', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'always', 'liked', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'bought', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'why', 'opinion', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'surprise', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'basically', 'playing', 'Stallone', 'also', 'basically', 'playing', 'Everyone', 'how', 'horrible', 'Sly', 'singing', 'kidding', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'premise', 'movie', 'Dolly', 'adored', 'country', 'singer', 'club', 'bet', 'can', 'turn', 'anyone', 'country', 'singer', 'Enter', 'Stallone', 'New', 'York', 'cab', 'driver', 'back', 'home', 'Tennessee', 'tries', 'teach', 'how', 'be', '34', 'country', '34', 'whole', 'concept', 'walk', 'talk', 'singing', 'point', 'movie', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'CAN', 'sing', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'become', '34', 'country', '34', 'like', 'Dolly', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'thruout', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'wrote', 'songs', 'movie', 'one', 'exception', 'only', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'wickedly', 'funny', '34', 'Day', 'My', 'Baby', 'Died', '34', 'also', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Look', 'movie', '34', 'Gone', 'Wind', '34', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'just', 'Dolly', 'doing', 'lot', 'singing', 'Sly', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less']",Rhinestone VHS

372193,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6303394353,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","As Sylvester Stallone's film acting career winds down, I get all nostalgic and tend to look more favorably even at his clunkers. Case in point, this film. When you think of legendary screen pairings, you don't think much of Sly Stallone and Dolly Parton. Yet, here they are, in RHINESTONE, a Pygmalion-like romantic comedy. Back in the day (that would be 1984), Sly had just done ROCKY III and FIRST BLOOD, his star ascending like a mothereffer. RHINESTONE was a change of pace for Sly and his first attempt not only at comedy but at romantic comedy, and when I first saw it during its theatrical run, I was stunned, and not in a good way. But I've seen this flick a number of times since then, and while familiarity does breed contempt, sometimes it also takes the edge off that initial pang of ""What The Eff Is This!""It's a bare-bones premise: With more than just her contract on the line, a country western singer makes a bet with her creepy horndog manager that she can turn anyone into a country western star within two weeks. She ends up stuck with a coarse New York cabbie and brings him to her Tennessee home for the hasty tutorial on hillbilly. After which, he has to perform before (and survive) a tough, rowdy crowd at a popular New York honkytonk nightclub.So what's more horribly fish-out-of-water than Sly stranded in backwoods Tennessee while striving to channel his inner hick? Where even the local hayseeds remark that ""He's slow-witted, ain't he?"" Sly's brash cabbie doesn't dig country music, thinking it ""worse than liver,"" and, yeah, when he tries to sing country I tend to agree with him. He talks and sings like he has marbles in his mouth and, on stage, twitchy dude needs to take some Calm Down pills. But the biggest flaw is that the characters in the movie, in the end, seem to buy into Sly being a credible singer (Dolly's manager even sounds him out about a contract). Sly co-writes the screenplay and he throws in so many bad caricature moments that the film was destined for universal panning. Dolly Parton is sweet and can really sing but her presence can't balance out the cliched cornpone and pasta.And yet, much to my shame, the last few times I've seen RHINESTONE, I've enjoyed the watching of it. The caveat, I think, is that you have to like the two leads some, or, else, you'll only get the bejesus irked out of you. If you like Dolly Parton, then it's fine, because she's good in her typecast role. If you like Stallone, then you might get a kick out of watching him attempt a southern drawl and a jock itch strut and also his being all gigged out in gaudy attire (and I'm not even referring to his country-western outfits, but his normal 1980s wear). The ""Drinkenstein"" scene (in which a rainbow throws up on him) happens to be one of my favorite Stallone moments ever. Although the funniest song is probably ""The Day My Baby Died,"" belted out by that face-scarred would-be cowpoke singer. And, for folks who dig the TRANCERS series, Jack Deth himself (Tim Thomerson) has a supporting role as Dolly's ex (but he loses some man points by getting clocked by Dolly).In the Stallone comedy ouevre, this one isn't as large a suckfest as STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT but not as good asOscar. RHINESTONE is a train wreck, yep, but the weird dichotomy is that its backhanded saving grace is also what capsizes it, namely Sylvester Stallone as country singer. Me, I ended up placing this flick on the Guilty Pleasure shelf of my DVD collection. It really all depends on if you can be forgiving enough, of the cheese and stereotypes and ""Hopalong Meatball""'s mugging and shatteringly bad singing (which to me is what makes the ""Drinkenstein"" song so awesome).It's from neither Shakespeare nor Jane Austen, but I dig the lyrics: ""Budweiser, you created a monster. And they call me Drinkenstein. And they call me Drinkensteeeein!""Yeah!",3,"Worth it for the ""Drinkenstein"" song",1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,3862,"['Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'film', 'acting', 'career', 'winds', 'down', 'get', 'nostalgic', 'tend', 'look', 'more', 'favorably', 'even', 'clunkers', 'Case', 'point', 'film', 'When', 'think', 'legendary', 'screen', 'pairings', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'here', 'are', 'RHINESTONE', 'Pygmalion-like', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Back', 'day', 'would', 'be', '1984', 'Sly', 'had', 'just', 'done', 'ROCKY', 'III', 'FIRST', 'BLOOD', 'star', 'ascending', 'mothereffer', 'RHINESTONE', 'was', 'change', 'pace', 'Sly', 'first', 'attempt', 'not', 'only', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'run', 'was', 'stunned', 'not', 'good', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'times', 'then', 'familiarity', 'breed', 'contempt', 'sometimes', 'also', 'edge', 'initial', 'pang', 'What', 'Eff', 'bare-bones', 'premise', 'more', 'just', 'contract', 'line', 'country', 'western', 'singer', 'bet', 'creepy', 'horndog', 'manager', 'can', 'turn', 'anyone', 'country', 'western', 'star', 'two', 'weeks', 'up', 'stuck', 'coarse', 'New', 'York', 'cabbie', 'Tennessee', 'home', 'hasty', 'tutorial', 'hillbilly', 'perform', 'survive', 'tough', 'rowdy', 'crowd', 'popular', 'New', 'York', 'honkytonk', 'what', 'more', 'horribly', 'fish-out-of-water', 'Sly', 'stranded', 'backwoods', 'Tennessee', 'striving', 'channel', 'inner', 'hick', 'Where', 'even', 'local', 'hayseeds', 'remark', 'slow-witted', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Sly', 'brash', 'cabbie', ""n't"", 'dig', 'country', 'music', 'thinking', 'worse', 'liver', 'yeah', 'when', 'sing', 'country', 'tend', 'agree', 'sings', 'marbles', 'mouth', 'stage', 'twitchy', 'dude', 'take', 'Calm', 'Down', 'pills', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'characters', 'movie', 'end', 'seem', 'buy', 'Sly', 'being', 'credible', 'singer', 'Dolly', 'manager', 'even', 'out', 'contract', 'Sly', 'screenplay', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'caricature', 'moments', 'film', 'was', 'destined', 'universal', 'panning', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'sweet', 'can', 'really', 'sing', 'presence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'balance', 'out', 'cliched', 'cornpone', 'pasta.And', 'yet', 'much', 'shame', 'last', 'few', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'RHINESTONE', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'caveat', 'think', 'have', 'like', 'two', 'else', ""'ll"", 'only', 'get', 'bejesus', 'irked', 'like', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'then', 'fine', 'good', 'typecast', 'role', 'like', 'Stallone', 'then', 'might', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'attempt', 'southern', 'drawl', 'jock', 'itch', 'strut', 'also', 'being', 'gigged', 'out', 'gaudy', 'attire', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'referring', 'country-western', 'outfits', 'normal', '1980s', 'wear', 'Drinkenstein', 'scene', 'rainbow', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'Stallone', 'moments', 'ever', 'funniest', 'song', 'probably', 'Day', 'My', 'Baby', 'Died', 'belted', 'out', 'face-scarred', 'would-be', 'cowpoke', 'singer', 'folks', 'who', 'dig', 'TRANCERS', 'series', 'Jack', 'Deth', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'supporting', 'role', 'Dolly', 'ex', 'man', 'points', 'getting', 'clocked', 'Dolly', '.In', 'Stallone', 'comedy', 'ouevre', 'one', ""n't"", 'as', 'large', 'suckfest', 'STOP', 'OR', 'MY', 'MOM', 'WILL', 'SHOOT', 'not', 'good', 'asOscar', 'RHINESTONE', 'train', 'wreck', 'yep', 'weird', 'dichotomy', 'backhanded', 'saving', 'grace', 'also', 'what', 'namely', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'country', 'singer', 'Me', 'ended', 'up', 'placing', 'flick', 'Guilty', 'Pleasure', 'shelf', 'DVD', 'collection', 'really', 'depends', 'can', 'be', 'forgiving', 'enough', 'cheese', 'stereotypes', 'Hopalong', 'Meatball', 'mugging', 'shatteringly', 'bad', 'singing', 'what', 'Drinkenstein', 'song', 'so', 'awesome', '.It', 'Shakespeare', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'dig', 'lyrics', 'Budweiser', 'created', 'monster', 'call', 'Drinkenstein', 'call', 'Drinkensteeeein', 'Yeah']",Rhinestone VHS

A lot of people ragged on Sly for being in this movie but as a true Sly fan, I thought it was a cool choice. I think a lot of action fans were upset he decided to dip into a different genre which brings on the backlash of Rhinestone. Please! I am so sick of people saying this movie is terrible when I could name about a million other movies that are horrible in comparison to this. This isn't even the worst film Dolly or Sly have been in. Remember ""Stop or My Mom Will Shoot"" and ""Straight Talk""??? YIKES! Both of them did much worse than Rhinestone down the line.Rhinestone may not be drop dead funny but it's entertaining. Sly and Dolly have good chemistry and Dolly has tons of charm. They made a cute couple and the chemistry alone makes you sit through this ""horrible"" movie. This movie is for people who want to have a little fun and enjoy some laidback entertainment. It's not for film snobs who think every movie someone should make is supposed to be a blockbuster. Get real! Actors can choose the movies they want to do and obviously Dolly and Sly wanted to do this one. It's been over 20 years and people are still whinning about Rhinestone and how bad it is!  Snobs won't like it because they don't understand that it wasn't meant to be the greatest movie in the world. It was a cute little 80's movie!  Over half of the movies in the 80's were crap!  Let's not forget other bombs of the 80's, Night Shift, The Babysitter is Dead, Look Who's Talking and I could go on and on.So if you haven't seen this movie and don't expect it to be Sly kicking someone's butt every five minutes, you'll enjoy. But if you sit there expecting not to like it, you won't. And if you're a film snob then go watch something else. This is for those who are fans of Dolly and Sly. I think Sly shows  his versatility in this film. He wanted to do a comedy. Arnold Schwarzegger did a line of BOMB comedies, yet everyone gets hot about Stallone and Rhinestone.

And that would probably be easily guessed by even the most casual movie watcher.Parton, as always, looks great, although I am not a fan of her music, I am a fan of her ""visual style"". Otherwise, the movie is pretty much a fish-out-of-water tale, by taking a New York cab driver and get him to be a country singer by hooking one of the hardest crowds around.Too many questions come up during this movie regarding plot, such as 'Are we in New York or Tenessee?' or 'How does a country club in New York survive when all of the talent gets laughed off stage?' and many others that, for the most part are not even worth trying to answer.The only thing that begs questioning is that the credits state the movie is based on the popular country song ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" by Larry Weiss, but not once is it played in the movie. I don't know if the DVD cut out the song for rights purposes, or if it never made the final cut of the movie. But why bother giving credit if its not even represented?Oh well.

Dolly sings some good self-penned songs, but some of the Stallone songs are simply ludicrous. Buy the soundtrack, but skip this cinematic mess.

In 1984, two years after back-to-back hits ""Rocky III"" and ""First Blood,"" and only one year after his triumph writing and directing the ""Saturday Night Fever"" sequel ""Staying Alive,"" the moviegoing public was not highly anticipating a flat-out comedy from the buff stud muffin.  But that's what they got that summer.  I, for one, was thrilled because I remembered Sly's rendition of the main theme from ""Paradise Alley"" - my man can sing!  The idea of pairing him with country-queen Dolly Parton was a masterstroke.The story couldn't be simpler:  Dolly wants out of her contract with a sleazy manager - he agrees to release her, IF she can train a ""regular person"" of his choice to be a country singer.  The regular person turns out to be the New York City cab driver played by Sly.  She has two weeks to prepare him for his NYC debut on amatuer night at a rowdy country bar - he only needs to get through one song without being torn apart by the merciless crowd.The screenplay, co-written by Stallone (as he wrote or co-wrote most of his films from this era), is loaded with knee-slappers.  One of the funniest parts is when Stallone wants to show Parton his ""really big organ"" (sounds dirty, but isn't).  Some of my favorite supporting characters are Freddy Ugo - Parton's sleazeball manager, and especially BARNETT CALE, who is a country singer and just an overall weird guy.  Oh, and the late Richard Farnsworth is excellent as Parton's dad.I wish the soundtrack was available on CD, as there are some very good songs from both Ms. Parton and Mr. Stallone.

372221,A37NL9EDUT23IV,6303394353,"takemehome ""Joey""","[0, 0]","First off, I'm just gonna get this out of the way - I bought this knowing it was going to be a terrible movie. I also bought it knowing was likely to be a lot of fun, as terrible movies often are. Can never go wrong with Dolly Parton, and Sly wasn't terrible. He wasn't good either, but he wasn't terrible. It's Dolly's personality and songs that save the film.Anchor Bay originally released the film on a barebones DVD, licensed from its studio 20th Century Fox, quite a few years back with a trailer being the sole bonus feature. That DVD has long since gone out of print and fetched very high prices for quite a while. Fortunately, in 2013, Anchor Bay reissued the DVD with a list price of $10, with Amazon and other stores often selling it for much less. (I bought it on here at $5.) This disc is even more barebones than the original. In fact, this disc is so barebones, it contains an FBI warning, the Anchor Bay bumper, and the movie. That's right. Not only is there no trailer, there isn't even a menu. Once the movie is done, it simply starts all over again. There are 12 chapter stops, no subtitles, Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. The 2.35:1 transfer, anamorphically enhanced, isn't totally pristine, but better than one would expect for a flop film not even released to DVD by the studio responsible for making it, with generally good color palettes, a layer of film grain that only occasionally gets unnaturally thick. The transfer is occasionally soft, but most of the soft parts were probably intentional on the part of the director and/or cinematographer.While it's disappointing that the DVD couldn't simply be a reprint of the original DVD and include the theatrical trailer and a menu, it's still nice to have it back in print, as I'd never seen the film, but wanted to. At $5, it's hard to whine and moan about barebones treatment when we're at least treated to a good-looking and good-sounding presentation of this awesomely bad fun film.",3,"Terrible movie, good fun, barebones DVD",1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1952,"['First', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'bought', 'knowing', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'terrible', 'movie', 'also', 'bought', 'knowing', 'was', 'likely', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'terrible', 'movies', 'often', 'are', 'Can', 'never', 'go', 'wrong', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Sly', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'either', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'Dolly', 'personality', 'songs', 'save', 'film.Anchor', 'Bay', 'originally', 'released', 'film', 'barebones', 'DVD', 'licensed', 'studio', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'trailer', 'being', 'sole', 'bonus', 'feature', 'DVD', 'long', 'gone', 'print', 'fetched', 'very', 'high', 'prices', 'quite', 'while', 'Fortunately', '2013', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'reissued', 'DVD', 'list', 'price', '10', 'Amazon', 'other', 'stores', 'often', 'selling', 'much', 'less', 'bought', 'here', '5', 'disc', 'even', 'more', 'barebones', 'original', 'fact', 'disc', 'so', 'barebones', 'FBI', 'warning', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'bumper', 'movie', 'right', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'even', 'menu', 'movie', 'done', 'simply', 'over', 'again', 'are', '12', 'chapter', 'stops', 'subtitles', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'audio', '2.35:1', 'transfer', 'anamorphically', 'enhanced', ""n't"", 'totally', 'pristine', 'better', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'flop', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'released', 'DVD', 'studio', 'responsible', 'making', 'generally', 'good', 'color', 'palettes', 'layer', 'film', 'grain', 'only', 'occasionally', 'unnaturally', 'thick', 'transfer', 'occasionally', 'soft', 'most', 'soft', 'parts', 'were', 'probably', 'intentional', 'part', 'director', 'and/or', 'cinematographer.While', 'disappointing', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'simply', 'be', 'reprint', 'original', 'DVD', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'menu', 'still', 'nice', 'have', 'back', 'print', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'wanted', '5', 'hard', 'whine', 'moan', 'barebones', 'treatment', 'when', ""'re"", 'least', 'treated', 'good-looking', 'good-sounding', 'presentation', 'awesomely', 'bad', 'fun', 'film']",Rhinestone VHS

The walls of 20th Century Fox shook when the boxoffice results came in for this turkey as it was one of the studio's worst flops. What makes the film so bad is not only a poor script, but Sly Stallone. While watching the movie I cringe everytime I see Sly in his scenes. He thinks he's being funny, but he comes off looking totally stupid. And as far as his singing goes...plug your ears. Dolly did the best she could with a terrible script, but her music is what salvages some of the film. The soundtrack has become Dolly's most rarest CD recording, with copies going for several hundred dollars on auction sites, and the DVD version of the movie has become a collector's item as Anchor Bay, who released the film, stopped producing copies of it a few years before.

But he would have been hard-pressed to determine the, ah, biggest star in the cinematic torso-fest RHINESTONE, which pits Sylvester Stallone's overdeveloped pecs against Dolly Parton's matchless mammaries.PORKY's director Bob Clark, perhaps realizing that his stars' considerable charms don't include acting, cast them according to type -- she as a cornpone country gal, he as an urban Italian lunk -- and yet they aren't believable even as themselves. Laughable, yes.The plot has struggling C&W; warbler Dolly betting her ample body that she can make a singin' success out of the next city slicker who passes by -- and guess who appears? We then take a very extended detour South, where Dolly teaches the Sly guy to think ""country,"" larnin' him such authentic bits of rustic lore as ""a cowboy always mixes his peas with his 'taters"" (it's how the West was won), and that a country walk is just like a city walk with ""a bad case of jock itch."" The script never lets up: ""There are two kinds of people in this world -- and you ain't one of em!"" And, ""Where are all the lepers when I need 'em?"" When our stars inevitably get together, their love scene is entirely obscured by Dolly's ... hair.If all this doesn't sound like enough to keep your kitsch-jaded friends amused, just mention these two words: Stallone sings! Sort of like an Elvis-impersonating bullfrog with a speech impediment.
