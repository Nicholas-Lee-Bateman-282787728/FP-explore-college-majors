189713,A9Y947FCJZPVL,1573624039,Arcadio Bolaos,"[0, 2]","The last film in Araki's Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy builds upon the premises laid out inNowhereandTotally F***ed Up. And what better way to end a trilogy than with a threesome in the making? The three protagonists of this production are Jordan White, interpreted by James Duval who once again conveys all the confusion and insecurities of adolescence, Amy Blue, his sexy girlfriend and Xavier Red, a wild, aggressive and assertive guy they meet on the road.Together they will embark upon a journey that, without a clear destination, will bring forth certain aspects of their real 'selves'. At the beginning of the film, Jordan attempts to penetrate his girlfriend to no avail. But this is not a reference to impotence. It is rather a reaffirmation of what Lacan would denominate the nonexistence of sexual rapport. Amy tries to give directions to her insecure boyfriend about what to do with his penis. Obviously, sexual joy here is phallocentric. But let's not forget that the phallus is a signifier, and even the model of jouissance is bound to be seized in the idiocy of the practice that attests to it. A phallocentric perspective exemplifies the non-rapport in the Other.To declare that the jouissance is phallic is fundamentally to state it is solitary. That clearly explains why is it that Jordan and Amy are unable to consummate their passion, remaining as virgins. According to Lacan, the axiom ""There is no such thing as sexual rapport"" obeys to a basically solitary jouissance. When Jordan asks Amy ""Don't you think sex is totally strange? Just the whole idea of it"" he is essentially explaining how difficult it is to decode sex in the symbolic order, because sex can neither be translated into words nor discarded as simulacra (which happens very often in postmodern society). Amy then responds ""I think maybe it's more powerful than we'd like it to be"". And she is absolutely right about it.As soon as Xavier enters into scene, sexual dynamics are fiercely disrupted. Xavier is sexually overwhelming, he invades the personal space of the boy and the girl, disregarding gender divisions. When Jordan and Amy are taking a shower together, Xavier looks at them and masturbates. Masturbation is very relevant in ""The Doom Generation"", after all, what could best exemplify the solitary jouissance? Amy describes Xavier as a living support for the sexual organ, and Xavier has no problems in acting as a ""walking penis"", so to speak. He is rendered as the phallus, and because he is the phallus he becomes desirable for Amy and Jordan.According to Freud, the man possesses the phallus, for Lacan, however, the woman can also have it (let's remember that phallus is not a synonym for penis). In both cases, as embarrassment, as lack, a substitute to be looked for, yet essentially, sexuality will be there conditioned, determined. To have the phallus is to be afraid of losing it; to not have it is to seek for it. All this is demonstrated when Amy engages in sexual intercourse with Xavier, thus creating a specular moment, an instance which reflects a previous one, in which Jordan masturbates while he sees his girlfriend and his new friend copulating (dynamics that bear some similitude to Cristopher Munch's Harry + Max, so it's not surprising to see this filmmaker credited at the end).Nonetheless, one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the feeling of impending doom that permeates reality over and over again. Amy will summarize it in one phrase: ""there is no place for us in this world""; whereas Jordan will only inquire ""ever felt like reality is more twisted than dreams?"". ""The Doom Generation"" is as surreal as other Araki's films, and it picks up on a certain leit motif present in his cinematographic work: religious zealousness and all it entangles. From Amy's mother (a fervent scientologist) to billboards with messages such as The Rapture is Coming (a ""doomsday"" of sorts according to certain religious sects as explained in ""Nowhere"") or Prepare for the Apocalypse. Of course, there is also the constant emphasis on 666, the number of the beast; every time the characters buy food or have to pay for something, the price is exactly the same 6 dollars with 66 cents. 6.66. The film is thoroughly filled with what Genet would call paratextual references, here the ""writing on the wall"" is very visible, in every wall, in every store and gas station they visit.Reality seems to be seeping down under their very noses, although as Xavier reminds them: ""I saw it on TV so it's gotta be true, right?"". But there is little or nothing they can grab a hold on. And this capricious dynamic is reinforced by the fact that Amy is an interchangeable object a (object of desire), as a fast food employee confuses her with an old flame and chases her down, something that also happens with an enraged lesbian, and a gay man. All forms of sexuality (heterosexuality, male and female homosexuality) enable the completion of yet another trio.When Jordan, Amy and Xavier are finally ready for a threesome, something of the order of the real irrupts and dramatically changes everything. A violent group of men captures the protagonists, and threaten Jordan very seriously with removing his genitals. But what could castration mean? A rapport should be posited and established, from a subject of one sex to the phallus, and would not get inscribed by a rapport to the partner sexed differently. This is the value Lacan bestows on the universal allotted to the castration complex. Thus the Old Testament conjectures that Sodom will suit the man and Gomorrah the woman. If castration was metaphorical at the beginning (Jordan's inability to maintain an erection) here it takes a more literal approach, which is only fitting if we consider that sexual rapport for the protagonists will forever be impossible.",4,Phallic joy and the failure of heterosexuality,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,5823,"['last', 'film', 'Araki', 'Teenage', 'Apocalypse', 'Trilogy', 'premises',

Out of nowhere, seemingly taking a left turn... it just ends.  I mean come on- with everything that takes place involving escaping the law, the surprisingly intense gruesome shootings and murders, and as assortment of other problems, you'd *think* the movie writers would want a satisfying way to wrap everything up, right?  Wrong!  The movie just ends.  Oh well.Well the good news is that for the most part, the movie is entertaining enough.  Whether the Doom Generation is considered a dark comedy or a drama with sexual tension among the three teens that drive around town and sleep with each other, the movie is rather impressive as far as keeping your attention span in check.Now I'm not personally a fan of the segments that focused around the two boys eventually sleeping with each other, but other than that it's not a bad movie.  The segment with the dog being run over and how the teens respond (especially Rose suddenly becoming emotional) is a highlight, and oh alright- Rose McGowan's obnoxious swear-happy character is worth mentioning as well.

Think of any movie that leaves a powerfull, shocking impression that lasts. This could best almost any. Its main concern is on the entropy of modern culture- it is done so powerfully that I was affected by it for days, which is a lot for a person who has seen much and become desensitized to video portrayles of violence. It wasn't the violence that was affecting in this movie: it was the very relevant, sad message it contained.  Watch it with an open mind. While there is extreme violence and sex, the focus isn't truly on that. It's on modern entropy and a modern hell on earth. The ending is one of the most gripping, powerful scenes in cinema ever.

I am not what you would call an Araki fan just because I had only seen one mof his other films before this one, Mysterious Skin. I happened to absolutly love that film, I really didnt know of Araki's other works so when I saw that Araki made ""The Doom Generation"" I was excited to see how this film compared to ""Mysterious Skin"" ...After veiwing ""The Doom Generation"" I can conclude that this film is in no where near as good as ""Mysterious Skin"".I thought that the way the this film was shot was kind of cool and unique but I also thought that the camera angles and all-around visuals were somewhat hard to see, the lack of lighting made some of the shots so dark that you could only see the make-up on the girls face.The acting was substantial at most. All three of the main charactors did OKAY during the sex scenes but seemed somewhat lacking during the scenes where they were just driving around or talking.The screenplay was very unique and could have been pretty good but I think that the movie put in so much of the run time into the sex scenes and focused on them so much that the short film (about 80 mins) did not have enough time to develop a plot and explain in more detail why the girl was known as ""Sunshine"" as well as a few other important details. In the end the screenplay just seemed like a jumbled and very confusing mess.Though everything in the film was either unexplained or just plain dumb I found myself pretty involved in what was happening as well as what was going to happen.I think that if the film ran about 2 hours, had three times the budget and had a script that explained things a bit better than it did, then it would have been a pretty good flick ...If you want to see a good Araki flick than you should see ""Mysterious Skin"". It had some outstanding acting, A well thought out and memorable screenplay & some stand out directoral efforts ...

189730,A1OT976K86LL7I,1573624039,Eric D,"[0, 0]","The Doom Generation is one hell of a polarizing film. Many of the other reviews are correct in that it's definitely a hate-it or love-it (for most viewers). I saw a trailer for it years ago and always wanted to watch it. I finally did, and while it wasn't what I expected, it wasn't as bad as some people seem to think. For the first ten minutes or so, it seems pretty bad. That is, until you realize it's not meant to be taken seriously (the moment you're looking for is when the film's first death occurs). Once you snap out of that mindset, you can finally start to enjoy the film and see that's merely meant to entertain, which, really, is what almost all movies are meant to do.If you still aren't shaken by that first death scene, these other aspects should help you realize the movie is far from serious: the constant 666 references, the name of the first store clerk, the main characters' last names (Red, White, Blue), the script, the zany set design, the awkward homoerotic moments, and the drive-thru order that the characters place.There are some issues I have with the film. In the first half, it seems like Rose McGowan and James Duval are trading places back and forth between ''the bad actor'' and ''the good actor''. They seem to take turns, alternating from scene to scene, which is really a strange phenomenon. Not to mention, I've always felt that these two were great actors, so part of me thinks the director had something to do with it and it was a conscious decision. In addition, I'm far from a saint and not very conservative in my thinking, but the script is definitely full of unnecessary cussing. While it has its place in many films, this one included, it was a tad overdone, as were the creative insults slung at Xavier by Amy.The production is up and down. There are some pretty creative shots and camera work, especially when Jordan is walking away from the hotel room with his yo-yo. However, there are also some low points, namely the amateur goofs, such as the crew members legs that can be seen in the reflection of Amy's sunglasses.As a sidebar, I have to mention the sweet cameos, which include Amanda Bearse (a.k.a. Marcy D'Arcy from Married....With Children), Margaret Cho, Perry Farrell (of Jane's Addiction), Heidi Fleiss, and the &#34;queen of the indies&#34; herself - Parker Posey, who shines as a crazy bar patron with a bad wig.Even though it seems like I am bashing it pretty hard, I gave the movie three stars because, well, through all of its faults, The Doom Generation was actually pretty entertaining.

This movie is so screwed up, it's not even funny (Well, actually in a lot of parts it is). It's so unrealistic, and yet somehow it's one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen. It's also one of the best.The plot is a little hard to explain, but it's so creative, that I shouldn't say anything about it, and just let everyone see it for themselves.The writing is superb. It's funny, because Gregg Araki makes these characters who kind of seem like dumb kids, but they know a lot of huge words (&quot;You're repugnant!&quot;). They cuss beyond belief, have way too much sex, and go to tons of mini mart stations where some odd things occur.The cast is great. This is the movie that really made Rose McGowan. It's her second film (following her two scene role in Encino Man), and she does the best job she can, like always. A lot of her male fans are going to see this for all of her sex scenes, but personally, I didn't really care about that.James Duval is a complete dork in his role. He actually kind of annoyed me in this movie, but James Duval is one of my favorite actors.Johnathon Schaech was a great part of this movie. This movie made me like him.Lots of great cameos by Margaret Cho, Parker Posey, Lauren Tewes, Nicky Katt, and Perry Farrell.I'd reccomend it to people with a dark, twisted, and demented mind. I would REALLY not reccomend it to everyone, because it isn't for everyone, most indie movies aren't for everyone.

Gregg Araki succeeded here where he fell short on Totally F**ked Up and Nowhere (the first and third films in this trilogy).The characters are actually fun, despite not wanting to like them.  James Duval and Jonathan Schaech (sp?) put in fantastic performances, but the best acting is done by Rose McGowen.  Her character Amy, a foul-mouthed, pissed-off superbitch is simply hilarious!  You have to wonder where they came up with some of her lines!  As the movie progresses, this threesome move from place to place and somehow end up in bigger trouble than they were in before.  Along the way they meet weird people, played by famous celebrities (from Margaret Cho and Parker Posey to Perry Farrell and Amanda Bearse).

189734,AKRRL7358VJIS,1573624039,"Ilker Yucel ""Kryptych""","[17, 22]","I first heard of Gregg Araki through the trailer for &quot;Nowhere.&quot; I saw that movie and thought it one of the gutsiest films I'd seen in a  long time. Then I heard that it was the third in a trilogy of teen angst  apocalyptic anarchy, including &quot;Totally F**ked Up,&quot; and this  film. &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; is even more difficult to watch than  &quot;Nowhere&quot; was. Araki's penchant for using obviously half-assed  teen language that is so outdated it's beyond humorous...which is the best  reason to laugh at it, is only amplified by the extensive cussing. Also  extensive in this movie is the sex and violence, both of which are VERY  abundant. From a quicki-mart owner's head getting blown off (sorry for the  spoiler) to stabbings to getting beat up by gang members (played by the  members of the late industrial band Skinny Puppy) to the shocking and  saddening climax, this movie is a bloodfest that could rival the &quot;Evil  Dead&quot; movies. The sex...well, in Rose McGowan's first starring role,  this movie makes it clear that she has to be a screwed up person to begin  with just to be involved in a movie like this (and to think...with this as  her first movie, some people were surprised that she would become Mrs.  Marilyn Manson). Her depravity as a person goes beyond being a slut, but  even to a sense of self-denial and hypocrisy, a condition that is worsened  by the fact that everybody else in the movie thinks that she's someone they  once knew who left them...and in return they must kill her. Was she? Maybe.  It's beside the point, and yes this movie DOES have a point. And it's a  little more than conveying the idea that this world we live in is a literal  hell, as is told by the 666 and Hell references that are so blatant and  obvious, they also add to the humor. However, this movie has no laughs. Not  that that's a bad thing, but it has almost no moments of light-heartedness.  It grabs you by the head and gouges your eyes from beginning to end. The  unrated director's cut is apparently a far superior version (I'm sorry to  say I haven't seen it yet, but I hear that the climax is extended and the  brutality of it is not only deafeningly saddening but also essential to the  subtle point this film tries to make). A great soundtrack also adds to the  gloom and eeriness of the movie. Not for the weak-stomached, and certainly  not a movie for those who don't know how to think (you don't know who you  are but I'll give you a hint...you liked Armageddon and thought it was the  most beautiful and emotional film ever made...). Even for people who do  like to think...this movie is painful. It will hurt. Physically, it will  make you sick, but if you can deal with its over-the-top dialogue, it's  bland acting, it's unnecessary but still compelling sex and gore, and the  fact that it reveals an underside to this world that is blackened by our  own demons, then you just enjoy that twisting sensation in your gut when  you finally feel like you're ready to puke by the end of the film.",4,Frightening...but...true...somehow...,965606400,"08 7, 2000",2000,3054,"['first', 'heard', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'trailer', 'quot', 'Nowhere.', 'quot', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'one', 'gutsiest', 'films', ""'d"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Then', 'heard', 'was', 'third', 'trilogy', 'teen', 'angst', 'apocalyptic', 'anarchy', 'including', 'quot', 'Totally', 'F**ked', 'Up', 'quot', 'film', 'quot', 'Doom', 'Generation', 'quot', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch', 'quot', 'Nowhere', 'quot', 'was', 'Araki', 'penchant', 'using', 'obviously', 'half-assed', 'teen', 'language', 'so', 'outdated', 'humorous', 'best', 'reason', 'laugh', 'only', 'amplified', 'extensive', 'cussing', 'Also', 'extensive', 'movie', 'sex', 'violence', 'are', 'VERY', 'abundant', 'quicki-mart', 'owner', 'head', 'getting', 'blown', 'off', 'sorry', 'spoiler', 'stabbings', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'gang', 'members', 'played', 'members', 'late', 'industrial', 'band', 'Skinny', 'Puppy', 'shocking', 'saddening', 'climax', 'movie', 'bloodfest', 'could', 'rival', 'quot', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'quot', 'movies', 'sex', 'well', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'movie', 'clear', 'be', 'screwed', 'up', 'person', 'begin', 'just', 'be', 'involved', 'movie', 'think', 'first', 'movie', 'people', 'were', 'surprised', 'would', 'become', 'Mrs.', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'depravity', 'person', 'being', 'slut', 'even', 'sense', 'self-denial', 'hypocrisy', 'condition', 'worsened', 'fact', 'everybody', 'else', 'movie', 'someone', 'once', 'knew', 'who', 'left', 'return', 'must', 'kill', 'Was', 'Maybe', 'point', 'yes', 'movie', 'DOES', 'have', 'point', 'little', 'more', 'conveying', 'idea', 'world', 'live', 'literal', 'hell', 'told', '666', 'Hell', 'references', 'are', 'so', 'blatant', 'obvious', 'also', 'add', 'humor', 'However', 'movie', 'laughs', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'almost', 'moments', 'light-heartedness', 'grabs', 'head', 'eyes', 'beginning', 'end', 'unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'apparently', 'far', 'superior', 'version', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'hear', 'climax', 'extended', 'brutality', 'not', 'only', 'deafeningly', 'saddening', 'also', 'essential', 'subtle', 'point', 'film', 'make', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'gloom', 'eeriness', 'movie', 'Not', 'weak-stomached', 'certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are', ""'ll"", 'give', 'hint', 'liked', 'Armageddon', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'painful', 'will', 'hurt', 'Physically', 'will', 'make', 'sick', 'can', 'deal', 'over-the-top', 'dialogue', 'bland', 'acting', 'unnecessary', 'still', 'compelling', 'sex', 'gore', 'fact', 'underside', 'world', 'blackened', 'own', 'demons', 'then', 'just', 'enjoy', 'twisting', 'sensation', 'gut', 'when', 'finally', 'feel', ""'re"", 'ready', 'puke', 'end', 'film']",N/A

The acting was similar but the surroundings and the moods were of a different nature.  No high school antics here....just one big road trip from hell story.  In another summary of this film, one person said,""watching this movie was like falling asleep with the tv left on.""  This is also more or less an acurate synopsis.  This movie has no real plot wich, in my opinion, has caused so many to hate this movie.  There is some thought that need be applied when watching this movie (as well as an open mind).  With the catch phrases that run throughout the movie (the rapture is coming, prepare for the appocolypse), and the nature of the dark yet strangely funny situations the characters find themselves in ($6.66 is the cost of everything, old lovers and clerks being hacked to pieces in moments of passion) there is a definite ""the world is coming to an end"" kind of feel to the movie.  Such is the case in the lives of young adults and older too.  All these dark situations are a reflection of society to those of us who strive for acceptance in a cruel and unrelenting world.  Despite the many bouts of dark comical mischief and touchy sex subjects (masturbation, bisexuality, three way sex) there is an honest and rather ""hard to swallow"" message in the pudding that many fail to or would rather not see.  The end of this movie kept me in the safe confines of my appartment for well over a week!!  If you like plath, angst and controversy you really must give this movie a go for your money.

People must understand that &quot;Kids&quot; was a rather  straightforward version of the doomed generation.  &quot;The Doom  Generation&quot; is purposely over-the-top in covering the same ground, as  evident by the cartoonish violence and outrageously and obviously written  (not natural) dialogue.  Also note the running 666 gag and the celebrity  cameos (including Heidi Fleiss and Christopher Knight, aka Peter Brady)  which make it clear that Araki is going for a distancing effect so that he  can entertain AND shock.  Some may feel that is a cop-out, but if that's  how he can send his message to the masses, good for him.Many people  won't even sit through this film.  Others will only be entertained.  However, some will realize how truly depressing a portrait Araki was trying  to paint.  A person who watches Hollywood action flicks is more likely to  be warped by their depiction of violence as entertaining spectacle, because  they don't shock at all.  At least Araki's film creates an emotional  response from people, especially those who hate it.

Like it or not, it's primarily a romantic comedy, and if you miss that you've missed what holds it all together. It's extremely intelligent, very dark, very sweet, profoundly erotic, and shockingly bloody. But most of all it's very, very funny. If I'd missed the humor, I'd still like the freewheeling sexiness, but I'd be appalled by the violence. But I didn't miss the humor, so I loved it all.Everything about it is brilliant: the writing, the direction, even the gory special effects, and every single member of the large cast is perfect, especially the three leads. For a ""heterosexual"" movie, as Araki labeled it (with some irony, I have to think), with plenty of sex between the girl and both guys, the most powerfully erotic scenes are between the two men alone. There's no sex acted out between them at all, not even a kiss, but the heat is intense and stunning, much more powerful than the explicit sex between either of them and the girl. It's the best proof I've ever seen that eroticism and sex are completely different, and in a movie eroticism is much more entertaining. The sex acts in this movie may be all hetero, but the real heat is as gay as it gets. That's quite a coup.I for one am glad it's not in widescreen on the DVD. If a movie that's filmed widescreen is shown at 4:3, you do lose information. But a lot of independent movies from that period were filmed at 4:3, so that a ""widescreen"" version just crops off the top and bottom of the picture, and you actually get less information.

189740,A2YQ5O6XV23543,1573624039,Kevin H. Dudley,"[14, 25]","The Doom Generation is one of those movies like Natural Born Killers that has an interesting premise and approach. But it makes its point very quickly during the first few minutes and then proceeds to pummel it into the ground until the viewer is eventually exhausted and could care less. While this worked to Natural Born Killers' advantage (due to the fact that Oliver Stone is a REAL film maker), it made The Doom Generation quite a chore to sit through.Writer/director Greg Araki has made yet another one of his films about troubled teens doing drugs and screwing at any and every opportunity. He seems to have made a career out of this (along with fellow independent filmmaker Larry Clark). He also seems to really like showing teenage sex in as many ways as possible.The plot (if you can call it that) involves a couple of teenagers named Amy Blue (Rose McGowan) and Jordan White (James Duval) who basically live a life of doing crystal-meth, attending raves and frequently having unprotected sex. Jordan is slow, dim-witted and basically dumb while Amy thinks she has it all together and is fairly quick with scathing remarks. While outside of a club one night, a fight breaks out in the parking lot right in front of Amy's car where her and Jordan have been fooling around in the backseat . All of a sudden, one of the fight participants named Xavier Red (Jonathon Schaech) jumps into Amy's car and immediately asks them to get the hell out of there. Xavier has been cut and Amy then proceeds to gripe about him bleeding all over her seats. It is quickly implied that Xavier is bisexual and he has equal sexual interest in both Amy and Jordan. While at a convenience store picking up junk food, the oriental store owner pulls a shotgun on Amy & Jordan since he thinks they are trying to leave without paying even though she just left her money in the car. Xavier intervenes and holds back the store owner and accidentally pulls the trigger, blowing the owner's head clean off. The head lands in the salad bar and starts jabbering and spewing up nasty green stuff. They grab all the beer and food they can and leave.While at a rundown hotel, they find out on the news that they were captured by survelliance cameras in the store and are wanted for murder. After Xavier pleasures himself while secretly watching Amy and Jordan having sex in a bathtub, he quickly asks them if they want to go get some food (this comes after a disgusting closeup shot of Xavier licking his own semen off of his hand). They go to some fast food joint, and the guy working the drive-through window seems to think that Amy is one of his ex-girlfriends and proceeds to pull a shotgun on her and her entourage. They quickly drive off, but the weird guy follows them back to their hotel and threatens to blow off Jordan's head unless he tells him where Amy is. (Amy and Xavier are out having sex in her car BTW.) Xavier jumps on the guy and proceeds to accidentally blow the guy's arm off.Basically from this point on, the movie just keeps repeating itself. They show up at a new place, someone thinks they recognize Amy, some graphic violence ensues, and everyone ends up having some more intense (and unprotected) sex.It's painfully obvious that Greg Araki is trying to make out like the characters are trapped in hell. Everytime they buy something, the cash registers always rings up the price being 6 dollars and 66 cents. 666, get it?!! Xavier is also supposed to represent the devil apparently. At one point he mentions that he has a tattoo of Jesus on his penis so ""that everyone can have Jesus inside of them."" The movie also relies on the color red for most of its backdrops. This would be alright if the movie wasn't so underlit and filmed with some of the grainiest film stock known to man (and this was the DVD version!).The movie tries to be a dark portrait of America's youth, but the movie just seemed like an excuse for Greg Araki to pile on the sex and violence in an attempt to cover up how stupid and pointless his movie really is. His preoccupation with teenage sex is also a little creepy (similarities to Larry Clark, the director of Kids and Bully abound).While there is a lot of sex in the movie, a lot of it is shot from the waist up and the dialogue itself is more extreme than the actual sex. There are a couple of instances that are pretty sick but most of the movie isn't nowhere near as explicit as its reputation would lead you to believe, despite it being unrated. Some have said that some of the sex in the movie wasn't simulated, but since we can't really see down that far during the majority of the sex scenes I guess we'll never know for sure. The scene though in the bathtub where Rose is getting it on with James Duvall seems to be pretty real. In some respects, it does make the sex scenes a bit more erotic as it focuses a bit more on the actor's performances & faces and not just on the explicit details of the sexual act itself. But still, with the movie being unrated, they should have just gone all out with the sex and shown a lot more as this is the film's only saving grace to a certain extent.The cast does about as much as they can with the limited characters, but they all end up giving one-note performances. It's not really their fault since there's some genuinely talented actors present. Rose McGowan in particular does a very credible job considering how much of a limited character she is given to play. I thought that she was extremely convincing and, most importantly, very sexy. Jonathon Schaech also does some good work as he probably has the most to work with as his character Xavier is essentially just a manipulator. He has since gone onto bigger things, his break-out role being in Tom Hank's film That Thing You Do. James Duvall is as bland and pointless as every single film that I have seen him in.Most people will probably rent this movie strictly to see Rose McGowan nude, but most of her nudity involves her just being topless (which is still alright by me). There's a brief butt shot, but unfortunately no full-frontal. But for fans of the sexy actress, this will more than likely suffice quite nicely. I don't think she has looked quite this hot in any of her other films. Her breasts are truly a national treasure. She has a beauty that is truly hypnotic and it's a shame that she has since had to take a cheasy acting gig on the television Charmed.The movie has a really cheap look to it that makes some scenes difficult to tell what's really happening. It literally looks like they spent maybe 500 dollars making this movie at various points. The gore effects are pretty cheap looking as well. The direction is also just as pointless as the plot.Basically, The Doom Generation ends up getting dragged down by its own excesses. It tries too hard to be shocking, vile and disgusting to the point that it quickly just gets numbing and extremely pointless after a few minutes. I initially liked the concept and approach but quickly realized that movie was going to fail to deliver on any level whatsoever.Some people might defend this movie, saying that I completely missed the point. But it just seemed to be trying to be ugly just for ugly's sake. There is no point to the movie at all. By the last scene which involved some homophobic skinheads wearing socks on their penises(!) while castrating Jordan with hedgeclippers and raping Amy, I had quit caring about the movie and the characters quite a long time ago, which was actually near the beginning of the film.Even if you're just wanting to check out Rose McGowan in the buff (and she does look great I might add), trudging through this movie isn't worth the effort.Did this movie get nominated for any Razzies when it originally came out? It not it should have most definitely swept them in virtually every single category it would have been eligible for.The Doom Generation is not rated and contains pervasive strong sexual content, nudity, explicit dialogue, graphic violence and gore.I should point out that the unrated version is 13 minutes longer than the butchered 72 minute R-rated cut. If you should choose to subject yourself to this cinematic atrocity, seek out the 85 minute unrated version.",1,"Awful, repetitious and lacking any point whatsoever.

(To be sure, these films have their audiences, but, to be even more sure, these are not audiences known for their discrimination, their artistic sensibilities, or their definitions of common sense and/or decency.)Show him/her The Doom Generation. I'm sure they'll get a kick out of it.Reviewers have noted this film for its &quot;art&quot; and for its &quot;postmodernism&quot; and for its attempt to slash apart the various diseases of Generation X and expose them for audiences to the soundtrack of a dozen or so angry bands. I have even read a reviewer who claimed that the film was &quot;supposed to be bad&quot; and that it was the next wave of absurdism in entertainment.This, if I may put it delicately, is crap. Both the reasoning and the film.Playing out like a fever dream, this movie attempts to cleverly and darkly walk the edge of the modern teenager's condition, speaking to the heart of the confused and pimply masses across the nation with it's total lack of coherent sense and its indulgence on pointless sex and excessive violence. Toss in a few &quot;dude&quot;s and &quot;far out&quot;s and you have yourself the next generations take on Dazed and Confused.Except this movie teeters on the edge of pretention, in spite of its glorious embrace of Nonsense as Cool. (And let me say, right now, that I am as much a fan of the type of Troma-team B-movie goofiness that you can find in Buckaroo Banzai or the Reanimator as I am a fan of the classier and more subtler types of entertainment and art to be found in movies such as Eternal Sunshine and Platoon, for example.) What the makers of this film didn't realize was that, in order for a Bad Film to be good, it must just be bad, and not loathesome, or weak, or trite, or ridiculously metaphorical. Intellectual plug-ins do not a diverting movie make.There are movies that attempt to answer the same questions that this film seeks resolution for: watch Living in Oblivion, Fight Club, and even (in an abstract sense) The Big Lebowski. These are movies that do not insult their audience. These are films that actually pose possible answers, instead of dwelling aimlessly on the drek and drudge of the question itself. These are movies with good dialogue, excellent cinematography, and fantastic actors, none of which the Doom Generation can come close to boasting of.There are those who decry the negative reviews as having been written by those people who don't &quot;get&quot; the film, but the truth is, as much as there is to get, I have gotten. And they can have it back. Perhaps the Doom Generation could've been redeemable at some point (I'll give it the benefit of the doubt), but the whole piece is wrecked by the same sort of mental masturbation that created garbage like House of 1000 Corpses. That is, the director had an idea for something he wanted to see (aimless violence and Rose McGowen's breasts), and he tailored a movie to that specific desire without considering things like &quot;art&quot; or &quot;insight&quot; or &quot;a plot.&quot; Just like Rob Zombie's pointless circus of death, this film spirals around one man's favorite wet dream, and does nothing else.Let me clarify one last thing: I am not against a director bucking all normal trends and defying normal conventions to create a film unique to his vision, as long as that vision has a point, or a reason for existing. Just because someone feels like making a movie, doesn't make it diverting, entertaining, or worthy of creation, though. If you're interested in films created by those men and women who flaunt conventions and yet, still manage to say something important, watch Requiem for a Dream or Pi or Mulholland Drive.And if you're one of those people who DO like the Doom Generation, may I recommend to you the extended, uncut DVD of Jackass?",1,A Fan For Every Film,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,3932,"['Do', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'actually', 'watching', 'Faces', 'Death', 'Jackass', 'Fox', 'Botched', 'Surgeries', 'II', 'Time', 'Brutal', 'be', 'sure', 'films', 'have', 'audiences', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'sure', 'are', 'not', 'audiences', 'known', 'discrimination', 'artistic', 'sensibilities', 'definitions', 'common', 'sense', 'and/or', 'decency', 'Show', 'Doom', 'Generation', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'it.Reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'postmodernism', 'quot', 'attempt', 'slash', 'apart', 'various', 'diseases', 'Generation', 'X', 'expose', 'audiences', 'soundtrack', 'dozen', 'so', 'angry', 'bands', 'have', 'even', 'read', 'reviewer', 'who', 'claimed', 'film', 'was', 'quot', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'quot', 'was', 'next', 'wave', 'absurdism', 'entertainment.This', 'may', 'put', 'delicately', 'crap', 'reasoning', 'film.Playing', 'out', 'fever', 'dream', 'movie', 'cleverly', 'darkly', 'walk', 'edge', 'modern', 'teenager', 'condition', 'speaking', 'heart', 'confused', 'pimply', 'masses', 'nation', 'total', 'lack', 'coherent', 'sense', 'indulgence', 'pointless', 'sex', 'excessive', 'violence', 'Toss', 'few', 'quot', 'dude', 'quot', 'quot', 'far', 'quot', 'have', 'next', 'generations', 'take', 'Dazed', 'Confused.Except', 'movie', 'teeters', 'edge', 'pretention', 'spite', 'glorious', 'embrace', 'Nonsense', 'Cool', 'let', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'am', 'as', 'much', 'fan', 'type', 'Troma-team', 'B-movie', 'goofiness', 'can', 'find', 'Buckaroo', 'Banzai', 'Reanimator', 'am', 'fan', 'classier', 'more', 'subtler', 'types', 'entertainment', 'art', 'be', 'found', 'movies', 'such', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Platoon', 'example', 'What', 'makers', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'order', 'Bad', 'Film', 'be', 'good', 'must', 'just', 'be', 'bad', 'not', 'loathesome', 'weak', 'trite', 'ridiculously', 'metaphorical', 'Intellectual', 'plug-ins', 'do', 'not', 'diverting', 'movie', 'are', 'movies', 'attempt', 'answer', 'same', 'questions', 'film', 'resolution', 'watch', 'Living', 'Oblivion', 'Fight', 'Club', 'even', 'abstract', 'sense', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'are', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'insult', 'audience', 'are', 'films', 'actually', 'pose', 'possible', 'answers', 'instead', 'dwelling', 'aimlessly', 'drek', 'drudge', 'question', 'are', 'movies', 'good', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'none', 'Doom', 'Generation', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'boasting', 'of.There', 'are', 'who', 'decry', 'negative', 'reviews', 'having', 'been', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'film', 'truth', 'as', 'much', 'get', 'have', 'gotten', 'can', 'have', 'back', 'Perhaps', 'Doom', 'Generation', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'redeemable', 'point', ""'ll"", 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'whole', 'piece', 'wrecked', 'same', 'sort', 'mental', 'masturbation', 'created', 'garbage', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'director', 'had', 'idea', 'something', 'wanted', 'see', 'aimless', 'violence', 'Rose', 'McGowen', 'breasts', 'tailored', 'movie', 'specific', 'desire', 'considering', 'things', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'insight', 'quot', 'quot', 'plot.', 'quot', 'Just', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'pointless', 'circus', 'death', 'film', 'spirals', 'one', 'man', 'favorite', 'wet', 'dream', 'nothing', 'else.Let', 'clarify', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'am', 'not', 'director', 'bucking', 'normal', 'trends', 'defying', 'normal', 'conventions', 'create', 'film', 'unique', 'vision', 'as', 'long', 'vision', 'point', 'reason', 'existing', 'Just', 'someone', 'feels', 'making', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'diverting', 'entertaining', 'worthy', 'creation', 'though', ""'re"", 'interested', 'films', 'created', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'flaunt', 'conventions', 'yet', 'still', 'manage', 'say', 'something', 'important', 'watch', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Pi', 'Mulholland', 'Drive.And', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'DO', 'Doom', 'Generation', 'may', 'recommend', 'extended', 'uncut', 'DVD', 'Jackass']",N/A

189745,A152C8GYY25HAH,1573624039,Matthew Horner,"[16, 22]","""The Doom Generation"" is an intense, violent and erotic [hetero and homo] movie about teenage angst and alienation. It doesn't work on many levels because the focus seems to be more on style than on substance. Writer/director Greg Araki, who created a sensation a few years back with his ultra-low budget film, ""The Living End"", is both talented and original. The problem is that, since ""The Living End"", he has yet to find a project that suits his talents. His themes are dark and nihilistic. These are well worth exploring artistically, but he needs to find scripts that come close to matching the power of his visuals.Jordon [James Duval] and Amy [Rose McGowan] are a couple of spaced-out druggies in love. She's an extremely angry young woman who finds comfort in his sweet and passive nature. I'm not sure what he sees in her, for she is almost invariably unpleasant and often mean-spirited. Maybe he's so lost that any port in the storm will do. One night they meet the mad, charismatic and sexy Xavier [Jonathan Schaech], who leads them on a bizarre journey of sex, murder and mayhem. This trip is part horror, part dark comedy.This movie has a following and a cult status. I can understand this, but, frankly, there are other movies about youth alienation I would recommend before I would this one. These include ""Kalifornia"", ""Fight Club"", and a delightful dark comedy from thirty years ago called ""Harold and Maude"".

Sorry, that was pretty dorky.  Okay, when I was sixteen, I wrote a script and storyboard about a guy who went car shopping and got &quot;really violently abused&quot; by a car salesman.  Some of my friends and I then &quot;made&quot; this movie with an old 8mm camera, some Playdough, colored gell, and gasoline.  Use your imagination.  Anyway, The Doom Generation lies on a spectrum somewhere between that 8mm movie and Natural Born Killers.  If you think Rose McGowan (Jawbreaker, Lewis &amp; Clark &amp; George, etc., and soon-to-be a Charmed One) is your personal god's gift to the world, you will love this movie, plain and simple.  She (and some cheesy stuff) is, in my opinion, this film.  That's good enough for me.  If you want depth, social commentary, realistic effects, whatever, forget it.  This movie is honest (I don't even know what I mean by that, I guess that it's so bad that it's good?).  It's low budget.

While I hate to prattle on about hidden meanings and messages that do not exist or that are not intended, Araki (unlike most film makers) is sophisticated enough to actually put such elements in his films. And he does not strike me as so full of himself that he would do this with no purpose other than mind games. Therefore, I will elaborate on my own interpretation of what he is trying to convey with this film.McGowen's character, Amy Blue seems to be symbolic of the concept of pure beauty, which could be considered our closest relation to a world that exists outside ordinary life. An idea that psychologists like Jung (influenced by Eastern religion) have imagined as involving a sort of ""collective unconscious"" that persists through time while actual generations of human beings are born and die. Making beauty our proof while we live that there is ""something higher"" than ordinary existence. Like when a composer creates a melody and attributes it to a higher authority because they can't believe themselves capable of bringing something that perfect into the world.Some do not recognize beauty when they see it and some are inspired when they see beauty, but most must possess beauty-or failing to gain possession destroy it rather than share it with others. Protecting beauty from those who would possess it or destroy it is the focus of this film. Although Amy is able to disguise herself from most people (and from most viewers) behind a faade of bad language and grim 'attitude', she is occasionally recognized by those who would possess or destroy-illustrated by the characters that go into violent rapture when they see her.(SPOILERS AHEAD) My guess is that Jordan White is a too pure angel sent to protect Amy, and that Xavier Red is an evolving Jordan as his purity is replaced with protective survival skills. This is why the police agency can only find Amy's fingerprints on file. Like Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother Donald in 'Adaptation', death of one part of the dual identity is necessary for an integration of the two personalities. Akai likes to leave his involved audience members with the feeling that they were dreaming while riding a roller coaster.There are a lot of God-Devil images in this film, with '666' presaging another attempt to destroy beauty or the evidence of 'something higher'.Araki films are often about things not being what they appear to be; and they require the viewer to sort out complexity and revelation in what appear to be one-dimensional characters undergoing no real change. For example the sex scenes in this film, which initially seem crude and graphic, actually have a strange sort of innocence if you get past your own preconceptions.This film is ambitious and amazing but not for everyone.Then again, what do I know?

(Interestingly, the two groups, according to IMDB, who rate it highest? Males under 18 and females 18-29. Figure that one out, armchair Freudians.) While I definitely come down on the ""hated it"" side of the line, I can at least understand what it was Araki was trying to do with this movie. I just can't tell whether he utterly failed to do what he set out to, whether he succeeded in such an incompetent way that it doesn't matter, or whether he succeeded so brilliantly that my reaction to the film was exactly what he was going for. To make matters even more confusing, I'm leaning towards the third possibility. Why? Hindsight.While Araki isn't all that hot a director (cf. the failed, if valiant, attempt to adapt Mysterious Skin), the folks he plunked down in front of the screen are all that hot actors, as we have seen in the twelve-years-and-change since The Doom Generation was released; James Duval (basically discovered by Araki; his second film role was in Araki's first movie) has gone on to do some excellent work, Jonathon Schaech has gotten a decent amount of big-screen work in the past few years after an extensive television career, and, of courser, Rose McGowan went from being a Pauly Shore movie staple to an It Girl after Scream. Perhaps even more telling is the number of high-profile folks (actors and non-) who were drawn to Araki's script: Skinny Puppy, Perry Farrell, Amanda Bearse (of Married... with Children), Nicky Katt (soon to become famous on Boston Public), Parker Posey, Christopher Knight (yes, Peter Brady), even Heidi Fleiss. All pop up in minor roles. They had to have seen something to get involved.The something, of course, is the whole alienation-angst thing that runs through the script. I mean, this is basically Ian Hunter's ""The Outsider"" brought to the big screen, with a really awful love story thrown into the mix and some really bad acting to propel it. But I don't think the acting was bad by accident. With these three actors? Oh, no, bub. I think Araki planned it that way. I think he told them to overact. Why? That's a bit more complicated. ""To get the teen audience"" is an easy, expendable, and probably oversimplified answer, though both Duval and McGowan certainly act like characters out of any number of awful teen goth poems I've read over the years. I think there's more to it-- the artificiality of the acting corresponding to the artificiality (or innocence, if you'd rather see it that way) of these characters; note that the two of them get better as the movie goes on (cf. Lindsay Crouse in Mamet's House of Games, who goes through the same transformation in much the same way). Similarly, the cheap special effects and set decoration. Simply covering a bar in tinfoil? Genius, if you want to go for a cheap look.All that said, it doesn't diminish my visceral reaction to the film in any way. I still don't like it. If Araki didn't want me to like it, I can certainly respect that, and it's a valid enough reaction for a director to expect from a film; Hideshi Hino certainly isn't looking for legions of screaming fans when he directs movies. It just doesn't quite ring right, because man, if this film does have a target audience, I'm it. The cheap, dumb sets? I loved them in Carpenter's They Live. The bad acting? See my previous note on House of Games, which I think of as one of the hundred best movies ever made. And Skinny Puppy fans don't come much harder-core than me. Somehow, though, while I can appreciate the film on an intellectual level, I just don't feel it.

The screenwriter was trying really hard to be like Tarantino. Tarantino has quick witted dialoge.This movie sounded like teenagers wrote it. Rose Mcgowen sounded like a teenage brat rather than a cool adult. I felt like this was a rip-off of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". Add a little ""Natural Born Killer"" (Which was better than this mess). I also know why they put a lot of sex scenes in this movie. Sex sells and this movie needed the sex scenes to sell this film. Another bad thing is when you watch a movie and you can see all the similarities from other movies in this one film. Well that is what happens hear, you start to wonder if your watching another film. I was in hell sitting through this film. There is also a lot of religious refrences and visuals through out the film. Is that there attempt to be unique. Just spell it out for us since the director knows we will never get it. If you want to see Rose McGowen naked just say so. This is the only reason a lot of people love this film. I needed a unique story and this movie has recycled ideas. If you loved ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", then this is a different version of that with a little ""Natural Born Killers"" thrown in there. They expect me to call this film original or entertaining. Sorry Rose McGowen wasn't great in this film unless you want to see her naked and for that you can hit the mute button. You don't have to hear her try to sound cool or make stupid insults that make no sense. You have to be on drugs to understand any of this mess.
