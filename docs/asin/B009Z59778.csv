Gammill,"[4, 5]","Having waited seemingly forever for Red Dwarf to REALLY return (not counting the lacklusterRed Dwarf: Back to Earth), I am delighted to report that the wait was worth it!  Red Dwarf X recaptures the feel of the original Series 1 thru 6, especially with the use of a live audience.  And the show is FUNNY again, which didn't happen very often in series 7, 8 and ""Back to Earth.""[Minor Spoilers Ahead]Sidestepping (or rather, ignoring completely) any continuity issues, Series X gives the fans back what made the show work best during its heyday: Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten aboard the mining ship Red Dwarf, encountering all manner of cosmic and comic situations.  The best of these 6 shiny new episodes are character-driven, such as the excellent ""Fathers and Suns.""  And where else but on Red Dwarf would you find characters traveling back in time, picking up Jesus, then having to give him an emergency operation for kidney stones (""Lemons"")?The only thing really missing is Holly, the ship's original computer.  But you just may find yourself laughing too hard to notice.  And credit must really be given to the four principal actors for stepping back into their roles with such apparent ease.  And everyone has aged extremely well, especially when you consider they've been playing these roles for about 25 years.  The show itself looks very polished, but not in a distracting way like Series 7 did.As with previous series releases, this one has bonus disc with a lengthy documentary, plus that good ol' fan-favorite, the Smeg Ups. All in all, a very solid continuation of a cult show that, happily, refuses to die.

1603332,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B009Z59778,Howard M. Kindel,"[0, 1]","It's Red Dwarf, one of the three all-time greatest shows on TV - so of course it gets five stars.  And episode for episode, Series X is quite possibly the all time best Series in Red Dwarf's history.  Doug Naylor's writing is some of his best ever, his direction equally outstanding; and the gags are some of the wittiest and best in its 10 Series run.  So what's to get nostalgic over?It took me a long time to realize what's missing.  And it took me a long time to pinpoint what changed over time to give the impression that something's missing.  Then it finally dawned on me.  In a word, what's missing is spontaneity - or, more precisely, the appearance of spontaneity.  And what created the loss of spontaneity is Craig Charles' growth as an actor.It's always (at least for me) been the character of Dave Lister who made the show what it was - and thereby hangs a tale.  Because as Craig Charles has gone from a first-rate natural comic actor to a truly accomplished comic actor, this evolution has necessarily changed the tenor of the character he portrays - Dave Lister.  Consequently, some of the old gags fall flat - though wisely the show has staked out new ground rather than simply keeping the same running gags.  Those that have been kept - such as Dave Lister's essential slobbiness - do not quite carry the same whimsical charm on a more mature Dave Lister as portrayed by a more mature Craig Charles.  Dave's grungy socks, mentioned only in the &#34;Lemons&#34; episode, fail to garner a laugh because they no longer fit the mature Dave Lister.  Similarly, Dave's sloppy eating habits, as evidenced in the &#34;Entangled&#34; episode, seem oddly out of place - even a bit obscene because they no longer flow as naturally from Dave's persona.  And the Series' only reference to his pining away for Kochanski, also in the &#34;Entangled&#34; episode, seems out of place, if not downright perfunctory - almost like an &#34;in-joke&#34; kind of thing thrown in to say to the viewers &#34;Remember that?&#34;In the episode &#34;Fathers and Suns,&#34; Craig Charles renders a truly bravura performance as both Dave Lister Sr and Dave Lister Jr in a genuinely original tete-a-tete via a tape recording.  But even though Dave Lister Sr proceeds to get smashed in one of the best drunken sequences ever filmed, he evinces a sophistication above and beyond the level we're used to seeing in Lister.In the final analysis, what's most missing in Series X is Dave Lister's cockiness.

1603348,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B009Z59778,Little Roy Blue,"[0, 0]","I'm glad this tenth season of Red Dwarf exists, even if it's a bit...weird? Dated? I can't come up with the right word.As fans will know, the show has a strange production history. The final regular season was number eight, back in 1999. Red Dwarf then vanished for 10 years. It returned in 2009 as a miniseries called &#34;Back to Earth,&#34; shot on location with a cinematic look and no laugh track. Then Red Dwarf X came out in 2012, featuring a return to cheap studio-bound sets and audience laughter in the background. What's the upshot of all this? That different seasons can feel very different, and indeed barely related to each other.And it's not just the production style that shifts. The storyline changes as well, at the writer's whim. The original concept was that Dave Lister, the protagonist, was the last human being alive, trying to reach Earth to see if he could salvage something of its civilization. Later, the writer introduced Lister's girlfriend from another dimension, making him no longer the last human alive. Then, they resurrected the entire crew of the Red Dwarf spaceship, raising the total number of living humans to hundreds (or thousands?) These changes radically altered the show's tone and themes.But now, in Red Dwarf X, Lister is again (mysteriously) referred to as the last human being alive. What happened to his resurrected shipmates? Nobody knows. What happened to his girlfriend? She's wandering around the Universe somewhere, so there are clearly at least two living humans. And is Lister still trying to return to Earth and restore some semblance of civilization? That's also unclear.In short, Red Dwarf X resolves absolutely none of the show's central conflicts or questions, and indeed seriously muddles its continuity. So, in a sense, there's no reason for this season to exist...except, of course, to provide us with six more funny episodes. And hey, it achieves that goal. Most of the episodes are good; I particularly enjoy &#34;Dear Dave&#34; and &#34;Fathers and Suns,&#34; which add some good tidbits to our understanding of Lister's character. (Alas, the other regular characters don't get quite as much good material - Cat and Kryten, in particular, are short changed.) And while the scripts aren't consistently funny, there are some priceless moments; I'll never forget Lister flirting with a vending machine, or accidentally destroying a control panel by dripping BBQ sauce on it.How about the Blu ray itself? Well, the print is great. These episodes were shot with very-high-definition cameras, and it shows - for good and ill. (The high level of detail is nice, but it does tend to make the sets and makeup look really fake!) The special features are solid, too. The highlight is a two-hour (!) making-of documentary, which delves into various production problems that almost derailed the whole season. There are also plenty of deleted scenes and bloopers to enjoy.So yeah...I recommend this purchase.

This alone is cause for celebration among us Dwarfers. Though certainly not as good as it was in its prime, the boys can still elicit the laughs.This time around we have only four major cast member, our core four if you will: Lister, Cat, Kryten, and Rimmer (as a hologram again). The boys are back on the Dwarf, not in prison, and the rest of the crew is absent, including Kochanski, as is Holly. For those wondering, there is never an explanation given as to the resolution of Series 8's cliffhanger ending, nor why Rimmer is a hologram again. We're just kind of thrust into the boys in their current situation, without any real backstory to fill the gaps.As I mentioned above, these six episodes are clearly not the best the series has had to offer. However, there is still much here to love for a true fan of the series. The actors are as true to their characters as they ever were, and to a fan like myself it brings a smile just to see them on screen again.

End of review.Seriously I really enjoyed this even though I went into it not knowing what to expect. Back To Earth was very different in tone than past Red Dwarf stuff. Where as Season 8 of Red Dwarf was bigger and wilder than the previous Red Dwarf stuff.Red X goes back even before Season 8 and trims down the fat of that Season in favor of the tightly paced storyline that engulfed us during the mid 1990s (Seasons 4 thru 7).In X we get the same great adventures and plenty of proper laughs but now we get it from mentally matured versions of the same characters we have loved over the 25 year period.Speaking of 'matured' I have to add that the costumes, make up and set lighting in this series makes the crew look younger and fresher than they looked in Back To Earth and maybe even season 8.The production quality alone is 5 stars in itself! When you see the making off in the extra DVD chapters then you will realize how gray and old everyone has gotten. Yet on screen Cat looks like he was cut and pasted from Season 1 cat and Rimmer and Dave look as young as ever.I will add that having the laugh track/live audience in X was a blessing! I understand in Back To Earth it was dropped for budgetary reasons but it never bothered me in Back To Earth because that show was very serious in tone and theme. Honestly adding a laugh track on Back To Earth would have been like adding a laugh track at a funeral progression.Here the laugh track is fresh, appropriate and makes the viewer feel like they are inside the ship with the crew. Most new viewers to Dwarf will not understand nor appreciate the laugh track since laugh tracks have been long abandon in many modern day sitcoms since the late 1990s (you have the advent of annoying Reality TV shows and faux Reality Sitcom Shows, like Modern Family, to thank for that).As an long time fan of the show I welcome the laugh track!I don't want to give any spoilers but I will add that my one minor gripe with X is I sort of wanted at least to see Lister's love interest appear during Red X. Back To Earth ended with her being important to the existance of Lister and I wanted that story to be revisited.Still it was a very good season and perhaps one of the best.
