It captured everything I imagined when I read the book. I could not believe how they got it right. The people, the town.This is not the book review, but if it were I would say I did not like the book's certain expicit decribed situations, totally not needed. I do not know what the author was thinking! He did need to add them to an otherwise great story. But, thankfully, those worthless scenes were omitted and not needed to make this a good film and better then the book for doing so.A totally wonderful adaption to a unique book.  Plain Song, very plain, and simple, like a simple and sweet song. So well done and true to the story. I loved it and recommend it to all small town life story lovers. Real people connecting and touching; a sweet and uplifting movie!",5,Great if you are lucky enough to find it,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,949,"['read', 'book', '2nd', 'time', 'just', 'recently', 'found', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'thanks', 'Amazon.com', 'best', 'merchant', 'world', 'like', 'book', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'captured', 'everything', 'imagined', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'got', 'right', 'people', 'town.This', 'not', 'book', 'review', 'were', 'would', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'book', 'certain', 'expicit', 'decribed', 'situations', 'totally', 'not', 'needed', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'author', 'was', 'thinking', 'did', 'need', 'add', 'otherwise', 'great', 'story', 'thankfully', 'worthless', 'scenes', 'were', 'omitted', 'not', 'needed', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'better', 'then', 'book', 'doing', 'so.A', 'totally', 'wonderful', 'adaption', 'unique', 'book', 'Plain', 'Song', 'very', 'plain', 'simple', 'simple', 'sweet', 'song', 'So', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'story', 'loved', 'recommend', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'story', 'lovers', 'Real', 'people', 'connecting', 'touching', 'sweet', 'uplifting', 'movie']",Plainsong: Hallmark Hall of Fame

For example, we never find out what the problem is with the mother, Aidan Quinn's wife and why she leaves the family - depression? Don't know. Never find out what is up with the bully and what drives him.

I got it because I was reading a book with the same title and I thought I recognized the story line.
