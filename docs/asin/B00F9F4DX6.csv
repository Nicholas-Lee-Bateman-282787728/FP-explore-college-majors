For the rest of us, even a casual fan like me, will likely find it kind of &#34;meh&#34;. It isn't a bad movie by any means, there is a nice story behind it, and the animation is decent. But, at least for me, it never really did anything to stand out from the crowd. Only a few of the characters really seemed to get a great amount of depth to them, and even when they did it never seemed substantial or enthralling. Overall, if you want to try it go ahead but don't put your expectations too high.Note: this takes place after the 123 episode of the series, so there are very minor spoilers",3,A fun Fairy Tail movie but that's it,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,691,"['are', 'big', 'fan', 'Fairy', 'Tail', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'buy', 'will', 'love', 'rest', 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'kind', '34', 'meh', '34', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'nice', 'story', 'animation', 'decent', 'least', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'anything', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'Only', 'few', 'characters', 'really', 'seemed', 'get', 'great', 'amount', 'depth', 'even', 'when', 'did', 'never', 'seemed', 'substantial', 'enthralling', 'Overall', 'want', 'try', 'go', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'expectations', 'too', 'high.Note', 'place', '123', 'episode', 'series', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'spoilers']",Fairy Tail - Movie: Phoenix Priestess

I think I remember watching a pokemon movie that had an almost Identical plot to this. On a note to new viewers, you shouldn't watch this before finishing the Edolas Arc.In Summary, Lucy Heartfilia is walking to the guild in a sad mood because of the last job the strongest team failed. As she is trudging her way to the guild, she passes Eclair- a anti-social stone-bearer. This stone that Eclair bears is the plot of the whole movie.Lucy brings the food-deprived Eclair and her... flying talking chicken (surprise right? who would have guessed a talking animal in Fairy Tail?) to the guild, where they are fed. Eclair eventually reveals to the guild what she thinks the stone she has laced around her neck means (she has amnesia so her memory is hazy the whole movie).To avoid spoilers, I'll stop there. But don't think this movie wont have enough action for you! Throughout the 2nd half of the movie, a new guild to the show sends its strongest team to do everything in their power to capture Eclair.

It looks a little like a Studio Ghibli project, which is pretty but completely different from the Anime. The colors weren't as vibrant, the style was different, and some characters were drawn completely different - I found out it's because I'm in the US and we're behind in the Anime series. Also, because I'm in the US, there were a lot of spoilers in the plot so I was a little disappointed having them sprung on me in the movie. Further, Erza and Natsu were noticeably useless. They didn't have a good fighting scene at all in the entire movie. It's like their fighting capabilities regressed to being non-existent.

While the writers give us another character and a new group of villains the drama and action feel on the level you have seen throughout the series with no fretting on characters fates or what's going to happen next really.The animation was also a mix, obviously not the same animators from the series though it's not drastically different either but you can obviously see a difference and it is a little annoying somewhat. It's good to hear the original cast for both the subbed and dubbed voicing their character roles in the movie which is greatly appreciated and you'll still have enjoyment watching the action and humor regardless.So if you already have the series this is a good addition to your anime collection just keep expectations down on any great story or plot and just enjoy a good hour and a half Fairy Tail movie.",4,While It's Nice To Have A Fairy Tail Movie Nothing Too Spectacular About It Either,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,996,"['Sadly', 'Naruto', 'Bleach', 'Movies', 'Fairy', 'Tail', 'movie', 'not', 'horrible', 'just', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'watching', 'prolonged', 'episode', 'series', 'writers', 'give', 'character', 'new', 'group', 'villains', 'drama', 'action', 'feel', 'level', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'fretting', 'characters', 'fates', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'really.The', 'animation', 'was', 'also', 'mix', 'obviously', 'not', 'same', 'animators', 'series', 'not', 'drastically', 'different', 'can', 'obviously', 'see', 'difference', 'little', 'annoying', 'somewhat', 'good', 'hear', 'original', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'voicing', 'character', 'roles', 'movie', 'greatly', 'appreciated', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'action', 'humor', 'regardless.So', 'already', 'have', 'series', 'good', 'addition', 'anime', 'collection', 'just', 'keep', 'expectations', 'down', 'great', 'story', 'plot', 'just', 'enjoy', 'good', 'hour', 'half', 'Fairy', 'Tail', 'movie']",Fairy Tail - Movie: Phoenix Priestess
