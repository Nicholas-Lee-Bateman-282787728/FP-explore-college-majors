314970,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,6302482712,Alan R. Holyoak,"[15, 15]","In this movie the lead scientist of a pharmaceutical firm (Bracco) travels  to the Amazon rainforest to see what a field botanist (Connery) is up to.  In the course of their interactions the street-wise city-dwelling Bracco  experiences the transformative value of spending time in nature.  At the  same time, Connery struggles to come to grips with a personal history that  torments him.  In the meantime the two of them work together to race  against time to locate the source of a possible miracle drug.I show  the movie &quot;Medicine Man&quot; to all of my Introduction to  Environmental Studies classes.  Many of my students have seen the movie  either in the theater or on video, but they have viewed it only as  entertainment.  There is a lot more to this movie than entertainment value  though.If I were reviewing this movie for entertainment value alone I  would probably rate it at about 4 stars.  The cast is good, Connery and  Bracco do a great job, and I particularly enjoy the supporting cast of  local folks.The reason I rate it as a 5 star movie, and show it to my  classes, is that the movie shows a believable story of the plight of  indigenous peoples and the loss of pristine habitat, the importance of  maintaining biological diversity, and the detrimental impacts humans can  and do have on the natural environment.  More important than that, however,  are the lessons that can be picked up with respect to the importance of  nature's ability to change people's attitudes if they step back and give it  a chance.Good entertainment, and a great message about the  environment.5 stars.Alan Holyoak, Ph.D., Director of Environmental  Studies, Manchester College, IN",5,"Great entertainment, important message",959731200,"05 31, 2000",2000,1685,"['movie', 'lead', 'scientist', 'pharmaceutical', 'firm', 'Bracco', 'Amazon', 'rainforest', 'see', 'what', 'field', 'botanist', 'Connery', 'course', 'interactions', 'street-wise', 'city-dwelling', 'Bracco', 'transformative', 'value', 'spending', 'time', 'nature', 'same', 'time', 'Connery', 'come', 'grips', 'personal', 'history', 'meantime', 'two', 'work', 'together', 'race', 'time', 'locate', 'source', 'possible', 'miracle', 'drug.I', 'show', 'movie', 'quot', 'Medicine', 'Man', 'quot', 'Introduction', 'Environmental', 'Studies', 'Many', 'students', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'theater', 'video', 'have', 'viewed', 'only', 'entertainment', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'value', 'though.If', 'were', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'value', 'alone', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', '4', 'stars', 'cast', 'good', 'Connery', 'Bracco', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'local', 'folks.The', 'reason', 'rate', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'show', 'classes', 'movie', 'believable', 'story', 'plight', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'loss', 'pristine', 'habitat', 'importance', 'maintaining', 'biological', 'diversity', 'detrimental', 'impacts', 'humans', 'can', 'do', 'have', 'natural', 'environment', 'More', 'important', 'however', 'are', 'lessons', 'can', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'respect', 'importance', 'nature', 'ability', 'change', 'people', 'attitudes', 'step', 'back', 'give', 'chance.Good', 'entertainment', 'great', 'message', 'environment.5', 'stars.Alan', 'Holyoak', 'Ph.D.', 'Director', 'Environmental', 'Studies', 'Manchester', 'College', 'IN']",Medicine Man VHS

314981,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6302482712,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","The background for this movie is extremely powerful, sad and relevant to the modern world. Sean Connery plays Dr. Robert Campbell, a brilliant but eccentric medical researcher that lives in a village in the Amazon rain forest embedded in a native tribe. Campbell is researching the medical properties of the rainforest flora and has discovered a cure for cancer. Unfortunately, while one of his first batches works all the subsequent ones do not.Lorraine Bracco plays another doctor that brings Campbell some badly needed medical equipment with the secondary job of evaluating his research to determine if it is worthy of future funding. At first she is skeptical and uncomfortable in the primitive conditions, but once she observes the cure in action she delves into the research, doing whatever it takes.Unfortunately, civilization is on the move and headed directly for the Amazon village. If the team of two doctors cannot reproduce the cure soon, the village and the flower that they believe is the cure will be replaced by a highway.The scenery and action is sometimes spectacular, especially the scenes where they are in harnesses high in the trees. The filming inside an actual Amazon village using the native people also gave the movie a depth of realism and accuracy that it could not have had any other way.Dr. Campbell also is battling his own dark past, years ago he was the person that brought a strain of flu to a native village and with the people having no natural immunity against it, the flu wiped out the entire village. Connery is superb in playing the brilliant man fighting his own demons and internally desperate to repeat his synthesis of the cure. He also plays to perfection the character of a man that lives within a native village and follows their customs.As a follower of environmental issues and with a background in biology, I was both pleased and saddened by the encroachment of civilization on the village where Campbell resides. The destruction of the Amazon rain forest with the likely loss of many plants with valuable medicinal properties is a very real event. While there is no happy ending to this movie, it is at least a hopeful one.",5,"This is a thinking person's action movie, the involvment of the Amazonians is wonderful",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,2175,"['background', 'movie', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'sad', 'relevant', 'modern', 'world', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Campbell', 'brilliant', 'eccentric', 'medical', 'researcher', 'village', 'Amazon', 'rain', 'forest', 'embedded', 'native', 'tribe', 'Campbell', 'researching', 'medical', 'properties', 'rainforest', 'flora', 'discovered', 'cure', 'cancer', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'first', 'batches', 'subsequent', 'ones', 'do', 'not.Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'doctor', 'Campbell', 'badly', 'needed', 'medical', 'equipment', 'secondary', 'job', 'evaluating', 'research', 'determine', 'worthy', 'future', 'funding', 'first', 'skeptical', 'uncomfortable', 'primitive', 'conditions', 'once', 'cure', 'action', 'research', 'doing', 'whatever', 'takes.Unfortunately', 'civilization', 'move', 'headed', 'directly', 'Amazon', 'village', 'team', 'two', 'doctors', 'can', 'not', 'reproduce', 'cure', 'soon', 'village', 'flower', 'believe', 'cure', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'highway.The', 'scenery', 'action', 'sometimes', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'harnesses', 'high', 'trees', 'filming', 'actual', 'Amazon', 'village', 'using', 'native', 'people', 'also', 'gave', 'movie', 'depth', 'realism', 'accuracy', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'other', 'way.Dr', 'Campbell', 'also', 'battling', 'own', 'dark', 'years', 'was', 'person', 'brought', 'strain', 'flu', 'native', 'village', 'people', 'having', 'natural', 'immunity', 'flu', 'wiped', 'out', 'entire', 'village', 'Connery', 'superb', 'playing', 'brilliant', 'man', 'fighting', 'own', 'demons', 'internally', 'desperate', 'repeat', 'synthesis', 'cure', 'also', 'perfection', 'character', 'man', 'native', 'village', 'customs.As', 'follower', 'environmental', 'issues', 'background', 'biology', 'was', 'pleased', 'saddened', 'encroachment', 'civilization', 'village', 'where', 'Campbell', 'destruction', 'Amazon', 'rain', 'forest', 'likely', 'loss', 'many', 'plants', 'valuable', 'medicinal', 'properties', 'very', 'real', 'event', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', 'least', 'hopeful', 'one']",Medicine Man VHS

Lorraine Brocco absolutely is stunning!!  She is a great comedic talent, a delight to watch as she matches wits with the ageless (only keeps getting better) Connery.  The charm of their relationship, the incisive banter, the stunning location work, delivers one engaging movie.They work in the question of the destruction of the rain forrest, and the real cost to man kind; the loss of moisture for rainfal, the loss of special one of a kind plants that could hold the cure for many modern diseases.  I know many critics tried to put it down for offering no real solutions to this problem.  Get real.  This is a movie, it is meant to entertain.  If it makes us think and wonder, then it has done it job.  Solutions are up to the real world, not some fictional work.

The human story is more interesting than the ostensible plot, with Connery being driven by guilt over various events in his life which will become apparent over the course of the film. There is the rather predictable love affair between Connery and his 25 years younger co-star, but thankfully not much time is taken up with this.

These two people are contentious from the outset and remain so for most of the film (105 minutes of this is a bit much to take).  He's argumentative and sour, she's unrelentingly shrill.  It seemed absolutely pointless to have this unending bickering as it totally eclipsed the story: a supposed cure for cancer (and the ecological matter of the shrinking rainforest was half heartedly tossed in for good measure).

But it is one of the first important films on the deep value of the Amazon's rain forest. A doctor discovers there a plant from which he extracts a miraculous element that cures nearly everything. Then he tries to start again and produce more of the drug, following his notes. And he fails. He never matches the first batch. He asks for an assistant, and the film makes it funny by sending a young woman. She re-does everything and she prepares new concoctions. And suddenly it works. Why ? Because, running out of sterile sugar she uses the one that is on the breakfast table. And in this sugar there are ants. The famous peak 37 that gives its potency to the drug comes from the secretions of the ants in the sugar. What cures man is an animal element. Then the suspense of the film comes from the coming of a road, of the road builders who are pushing the Indians, the forest and their secrets away. Today we are more advanced in the denunciation of this scandalous destruction of the rain forest, just as much as we are more advanced in the destruction of the rain forest itself.

315049,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,6302482712,Stephen A. Haines,"[9, 9]","If limited to taking but one Sean Connery film to a desert island retreat, this would be the  choice.  'Big Tam' displays his best in this film set in  the Brazilian rainforest.  With a  conscience ravaged with guilt for  accidently decimating an Indian village, his life as a field  researcher is  tempered by his dealings with the native population.  An opportunity for  redemption appears in the form of a cure for 'the plague of the twentieth  century' which he's  found, then lost.  Portraying the questing scientist  shows Connery at the fullest of his acting  powers, which are here  outstanding.  None of the other films since the end of his James Bond  series comes even close [ENTRAPMENT would be #2 for the desert island].  Connery moves  from towering rages through deep irony to heartfelt caring  without a false step.His opposite in this film, Lorraine Bracco, is a  mystery.  None of the other films she's made  even approaches her  performance here.  She's hardly a top-notch actress, but it would seem  Big  Tam brought out whatever 'best' she has in making Medicine Man.  The scene  of her  under the influence of yoko extract was hilarious.  She must be  given credit for trying.  It  would be nice to know whether her role was  created around her New York City origins.There are those who grizzle  about this being a 'message film'.  In an era when nearly every  human  foible becomes the subject of books and films, a little publicity of what  is happening to  the source of the oxygen we breathe shouldn't be out of  place.  Connery's line 'less rain forest  means less rain' must have come  as a shock to those who caught it.  Most people seem to  think the opposite  is the case and that cleared forests can recover easily.  Even now, the  Brazilian government is preparing to sweep away thousands of square miles  of your source  of breathable air.  McTiernan had his work cut out in  covering topics as diverse as field  biology, medicine, environmental  mechanisms, native peoples' issues and the personal  relationship of the  two main characters in this film.  The half-hearted comments of Maltin and  Keogh in the Editorial Reviews section above reflect the superficial view  offered by too many  critics.
