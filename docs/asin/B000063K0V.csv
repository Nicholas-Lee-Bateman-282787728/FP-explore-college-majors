695467,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B000063K0V,,"[3, 3]","Howie Blitzer is having some serious trouble dealing with the death of his mother. His father is never around and is constantly with other women and his only friend is Gary, another troubled kid who Howie is somewhat sexually attracted to and who leads him and a couple other misfits to houses to steal from. Eventually, Howie and Gary rob the house of a pederast named Big John (Brian Cox). John finds Howie and at first sees him as another teen that he can fool around with. However, upon actually meeting Howie, he realizes that he needs a loving father a lot more than he needs a sexual partner and thus seeks to become a serious father figure to him and to be a proper male role model that can admire and respect the interests and efforts of him as a human being. Unfortunately, his desires can't be suppressed all that easily.There is one single flaw with the film. That is the ending. The film ends in heartless violence. It would have been better to end ambiguously. It is a little disappointing to me that it ends so brutally. However, even that single flaw doesn't make me love the film any less. This is one of my favorite films. It is a film that I have always cherished, loved, and admired ever since the day that I saw it, many many years ago. It is a film that is so honest and so damn pitch-perfect in showing the kind of people that it is depicting and so fearless in it's story that it is so willing to tell that, to me, it is almost required viewing. This film spoke to me. I can really relate to the feelings and the situations of the film in a lot of ways because I had a terrible time back when I was fifteen since I had been bullied around and didn't really have anyone to talk to about my problems. I had experienced the loss of people I loved as well, and I to deal with those bad feelings for a lot longer than I would have liked due to circumstances beyond my control. I'll save my sob stories for a rainy day because I doubt that anyone really wants to hear any of it, but I can really relate to the Howie character. I think we all, at one time or another, felt a little like Howie Blitzer. He's a very relatable character who is developed in a much more straight forward and observant way than most films really care to. Despite his problems, and believe me he has PROBLEMS, he still is a good writer and he still appreciates art and the things that matter to him and we, as a viewer, get that first and foremost. That's one thing that I especially appreciated about this picture, L.I.E. It refuses to turn it's subject into a cliche.I think that this film, first and foremost, is about the fear that most adults have of losing their children. In this film, it is the child who has experienced loss, and with that loss comes a serious emotional toll that affects his father in a much more disturbing and much more troubling way than the child is and we aren't spared any of this. What this film does differently is that it shows the troubling situation from the child's point of view and thus we get the sense that the situation seems quaint on the surface. What the child doesn't realize is the trouble that is soon to follow once his father's personal life and professional life both spiral out of control. Again, the audience does not get spared this development.Then comes the pederast, played absolutely brilliantly by Brian Cox, and the situation grows increasingly alarming. There is no doubt given to the viewer that the pederast is intent on becoming sexually involved with the main character, and we are deeply disturbed by the development. A similar technique to this was depicted with the Kevin Spacey character in American Beauty, and the situation develops in a similar manner. To go off topic briefly, it's interesting to note that the would-be victim in American Beauty was a girl and the would-be victim in this film, L.I.E., is a boy, and yet American Beauty got away with an R rating from the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) while L.I.E. was given an NC-17 rating for ""some explicit sexual content"". I don't think that it is any secret what I am implying. Anyway, eventually the horrific situation with the father affects the life of Howie and the pederast, Big John, is forced into Howie's life. I won't spoil what happens afterward, because what happens is what is at the heart of the film and what I think makes the film especially worth seeing. This film's frank portrayal of such disturbing taboo subject matter is done remarkably without ever becoming pornographic or exploitative.I think that most people who watch this expecting something shocking will be somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong though. This film is shocking. It's very shocking. It's just not shocking in a perverted way such as the Todd Solondz film, Happiness, which is also, along with American Beauty, a brilliant, albeit repulsive, masterpiece of 90s filmmaking. Above all, however, I would like to see more films deal with the subjects of death, dysfunction, pederasty, and growing up in an honest and hard hitting way without being exploitative or pornographic. L.I.E. does not only this, but also takes it one step further by telling an original and thoughtful story in a way that is, in addition to being engrossing and gripping, is also surprisingly tender and true-to-life. Like I said above, this film spoke to me. It is the kind of film that I would have loved to have seen when I was growing up.The performances are remarkably natural and extraordinary, the cinematography is top-notch, the script is both hilarious and heartbreaking, and the whole film has such a strong sense of intensity and ferocity that it's really difficult to stop watching it once you start. It does everything a film is supposed to do. It's extremely entertaining, challenging, and bizarre. It confronts the idea of being human and having normal human weaknesses. It is both a celebration and a denouncement. In other words, it is one of the best films of the 21st century.",5,A shocking masterpiece,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,6002,"['Howie', 'Blitzer', 'having', 'serious', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'death',

695468,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000063K0V,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 12]","I went into this film with some rather high expectations.  I hate doing that with cinema, but when you find a film with as much praise as this film garnered, you do have a moment of anticipation as you begin your newfound movie adventure.  I expected to see a riveting story, powerful climactic acting, and social challenges coupled with iconic symbolism.  I expected this with L.I.E. because of the swooning nature of the ""entertainment"" critics.  Instead, what was handed to me was a choppy film with superb acting, but filled with a plethora of open ended questions that director Michael Cuesta obviously had no intention of answering.  With interchangeable characters, intermittent sub-stories, and humor that seemed more glamorized for pre-teens than the mature audience watching this film, L.I.E. came in as nothing more than a major disappointment.  I will sit on my comforting chair and applaud the acting that surrounded this film (ie Brian Cox and Paul Dano's chemistry was better than most Hollywood pre-pairings), but I cannot say the same for the story or overall theme of this film.  L.I.E. could have been a power film about family dystopia, about the impressions of youth due to family trauma, and the power of sex in a teenage life, but instead this film transformed into nothing more than simple shock-o-rama with some hidden gems wedged nearly out of the eyes view.I think what disgruntled me the most about this film was the jagged storyline that Cuesta submerged his characters into.  Here are a couple of examples that strained both my mind as well as my cinematic taste:  the unbinding relationship between Gary and Howie, the puzzling scene between Howie's dad and his lawyer (can anyone say AWKWARD), the sporadic bits of humor spliced within Howie's thieve circle (random friend sleeping with sister), as well as the struggling ""man-boy"" living with Big John that obviously needed no introduction or story.  It was these small loose ends that I felt Cuesta just couldn't focus on, thus ultimately destroying this film.  What irked me further was that there was much potential in Cuesta's story that if these loose ends would have been taken out this would have been a very moving and influential film.  This movie is the perfect example of what happens when directors attempt to bring too much into the story thinking that it will add either 1) shock value (who wouldn't want the next Kids film on their hands!) or 2) completely destroy the character giving us a hopeless victim that we need to instantly feel sympathy towards.  As I watched L.I.E., I found myself enjoying the connections that Cuesta was developing between parenthood and relationships.  What could have been viewed as a film concerning pedophilia instead moved to a movie about a lost boy searching for any form of guidance, acceptance, and involvement.  I thought Cuesta hit this primary target straight forward, but with his annoying random intermittent sub-stories he could not keep my attention from beginning to end.  He was a tease.  He would grab me emotionally, and then obtrusively forcing me to go with scenes like Howie's father running through his yard evading the F.B.I.  How embarrassing for a film of this nature as well as for Michael Cuesta.Again, what saved this film from utter mediocrity was the power of Brian Cox.  Rumors have spread that he was advised not to take this role by business associates and friends, but he pushed forward giving us a new face and personality to pedophilia.  What made him so incredible in this film was his attention to detail, his level of humanity, and the sincerity of his actions.  Sure, what he did behind closed doors is considered evil in our society, but he took his character away from that society clich&eacute;.  He transformed this vile character into that of family.  For most actors, that would be very difficult to do, but for Cox it seemed to come with complete and utter ease.  The scene that stands out the most in my mind was when his ""man-boy"" made the comment to him about ""being ashamed"", Cox responded with ""I feel shame every day"".  The humility of his character was ingenious.  He wasn't this monster (though he had the characteristics of one), but instead a troubled man that was looking - much like Howie - for companionship.  Also, Cox's character wouldn't have worked if it weren't for Paul Dano.  He was so young in this role, yet he seemed to give us more connectiveness to his character than most other films.  We found ourselves rooting for him, and at the same time feeling pity for him.  He portrayed the ""tag-along"" with ease and stability.  Dano and Cox were the staples to this film, and I must credit Cuesta for bringing these two together - even though he couldn't bring the entirety of the film together.Overall, I thought this was nothing more than a mediocre film with above averaging acting coming from Brian Cox and Paul Dano.  Cuesta had a sincere film in his hands, but the placement of incoherent sub-stories dismantled the overall tone/story right before our eyes.  The youthful jokes between friends, the zigzag nature of Gary's actions, the insincerity of Howie's badly acted father, and the poorly illustrated ""man-boy"" at Big John's house could have been strong building blocks to this film, but instead because of the candid nature of it completely destroyed L.I.E.  I could find myself suggest this film to friends just one due to the interest twist that Cuesta used to compare the family dynamic to pedophilia, but that would be it.  One viewing only and I must pull off the Long Island Expressway to find a less bumpy route!Grade: *** out of *****",3,"And if I was a spy, what would you think of me then?",1156550400,"08 26,

Now all he needs to do is learn how to cook.As far as acting and concept go, this is a truly magnificent film. Not once did I feel disdain or resentment towards Big John (Brian Cox), despite the social conditioning that would expect me to. He was a vivid, intriguing, and even charming at times character who was by far the best in this story, despite his sexual preferences, which anyone with an open mind will understand is not the focus of this film.Cuesta really wanted to tell an unconventional, thought provoking and heartening tale about a confused adolescent and his relationship with an offbeat old man. What made this film so disappointing is the utterly ridiculous story surrounding it. It's like he had a brilliant idea and filled in the holes with utter nonsense, just to pad the film out to feature length.What was the deal with Howie's father? The whole FBI investigation, the legal troubles, what did any of this have to do with the story other than provide a reason for Howie to visit his dad at a federal prison? Why did his father keep a fat envelope of money in his dresser? Where did Gary end up? The thread about Howie's friend having sex with his sister never pays off and in hindsight seems like a shameless attempt at self-aware controversial humor. Cuesta must have known this movie would shock and offend people, and seemed to think that was enough to carry a film. This is never the case. Controversy alone does not make a great movie, and just like Marilyn Manson or Eminem, shock value quickly wears off to redundancy and disinterest.And then there's the ending, which quite possibly may be the cheapest, most unmotivated copout of an ending I've seen in a long while. Who was Scott? Every scene with him seemed only there to establish him as a gloomy, pissy...so and so.This could have been a truly brilliant film with some new insight into male sexuality. The performances of Big John and Howie were amazing, and I hope to see more of this kid in the future, because he really is spectacular. And Brian Cox reaffirms my notion that most British actors can imitate an American dialect better than Americans can do British. Michael Cuesta is no doubt a gifted director who can make great films.

I gave the film 3 stars (out of 5) but it's more like a 3.5/5.Paul Dano gives a good performance as the main character Howie, and all I can say is that he can act. He carries the film with such angst and confusion that I just wish he could've carried it through the film more, because at some parts Dano's performance lost me. At first I was into his presentation, but then I would be lost; but a few scenes later I would be back again. It didn't feel consistent. But he carries himself well in critical scenes with Brian Cox and Bruce Altman (Howie's father, in a scene at the very end that will really show Dano's acting abilities in the film)On the other hand, the supporting character of Garry, who is Howie's friend, (played by Billy Kay) was wonderful! He fit the role and acted very well. It was too bad that he was only in half of the movie.The scene stealer was truly Brian Cox. His performance is great.

Much was made of the ephebophiliac nature of the movie (though the sibling incest that's also featured in the film was largely ignored). The controversy and themes likely kept a great many people from seeing it.And that's too bad, because this is a good movie. It's a very touching and sensative movie as well, basically about a teenage boy who loses everyone close to him over the course of just a few days. It's also about an older ephebophile (not a pedophile, look it up on Wikipedia, kids), who is not always pleased to be what he is.There's certainly a lot of layers to this film, and to the characters, and no one fits neatly into our little stereotypical view of things. The performances are all top notch, especially by Brian (first Hannibal Lecter), Cox and Paul Dano (who later went on to be inLittle Miss Sunshine... still playing a fifteen-year-old boy).In fact for me the only thing that keeps this movie from five stars was the ending, which I found rather tacked on.>>> SPOILERS! &lt;&lt;&lt;At the end, the Cox character gets what many would consider to be his just desserts, as he gets murdered by a former ""victim"" of his (though really it might be better to describe him as a ""jilted lover""), thus leaving young Howie completely without anyone in his life who has any interest in taking care of him.I thought killing off the Cox character was pointless and seemed like it was tacked on because it's what the audience expects. You can't have a good child-molester, after all. No, they're all evil and deserve death. It's a shame, because otherwise the film was quite nuanced.Regardless, I still recommend seeing it.

Others include Our Lady of the Assassins, Wonder Boys, The Apt Pupil, and Gods and Monsters.  The movie is full of beautiful mournful music and the ubiquitous zooming sounds of vehicles speeding along the Long Island Expressway.  It is a superb coming-of-age story, worthy to be mentioned with Stand by Me or Y Tu Mama Tambien, but it's bolder than both of them...Bolder because it deals with the taboo of physical intimacy between men and adolescent boys.  Where most movies depict pederasts as monstrous villains and one-dimensional predators, Brian Cox's John Harrigan is a nuanced character we both like and despise.  In fact, given how 15-year-old Howie Blitzer's blood father Martin ignores him, focusing instead on his job, his legal troubles, and his rebound girlfriend (and blackens his son's eye in one impulsively violent scene), we're not even certain if John wouldn't be a better male presence in Howie's life than Martin!The movie shows a band of male teenagers (Howie's hangout buddies) who seem true to life, and therefore prone to popping boners unexpectedly, bawdy and inane conversation, roughhousing, and nonchalant homoeroticism. This particular teen wolfpack is more transgressive than most, adding prostitution, burglary, and incest to the mix.  Yes, L.I.E. won't be for everyone.  It doesn't flinch at marginal sexuality, and mentions unmentionable subjects.One last comment:  Paul Franklin Dano's performance as Howie is phenomenal, some of the best teen acting I've seen.  I hope this gifted actor has a huge career, not necessarily in blockbusters but in small, subtle, and intelligent films like L.I.E.  The scene in which Dano's Howie recites a piece of Whitman's ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,"" turning the tables on his would-be seducer, is stunning.

I cannot overly emphasize this point: If this film does not grip your heart in some manner, you are unmovable. This masterpiece is about a young adolescent trying to find his manhood in the wake of his mothers death in a car accident on the L.I.E.. (Long Island Expressway). His neglectful father is arrested by the FBI and placed in a federal prison, leaving the boy alone, and trying to find his way against insurmountable odds. He is coming to terms with his identity, sexual and otherwise. His best friend whom he doesn't know is gay, has been involved in a lurid trap with a local child predator, while also prostituting himself for money. Another friend is having sex with his own sister, while another is game for anything, and all are in trouble with the law. Howie is played by Paul Franklin Dano, who does an outstanding job portraying his character. An award-winning debut performance. Howie's only person to turn to, becomes the predator who now has his eyes on him for his own pleasure. Howie seeks in this man, the positive role model he lacks, while at the same time trying to explore his sexual feelings. The ball is in the court of the predator, who must chose whether to sexually abuse him, or become his mentor and show him a way out. This is an eye opening film that should speak to all of us about troubled teens and the challenges some of them face. This movie is not about the obvious subjects: sex, death, predators, gay, etc... There are no sex scenes, and everything is handled in pretty good taste. It is more to the point about conscience, choices and consequences. Which lane are you traveling in? I highly recommend this film to anyone! One tip: Buy it on DVD, NOT VHS as the VHS quality (at least on the copy I own) is very poor. My only negative to point out, is the snake scene I could have lived without!",5,"L.I.E. : Conscience, Choices and Consequences",1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,1949,"['Long', 'Island', 'Expressway', 'are', 'lanes', 'going', 'east', 'lanes', 'going', 'west', 'lanes', 'going', 'straight', 'hell', 'can', 'not', 'overly', 'emphasize', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'grip', 'heart', 'manner', 'are', 'unmovable', 'masterpiece', 'young', 'adolescent', 'trying', 'find', 'manhood', 'wake', 'mothers', 'death', 'car', 'accident', 'L.I.E..', 'Long', 'Island', 'Expressway', 'neglectful', 'father', 'arrested', 'FBI', 'placed', 'federal', 'prison', 'leaving', 'boy', 'alone', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'coming', 'terms', 'identity', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'best', 'friend', 'whom', ""n't"", 'know', 'gay', 'been', 'involved', 'lurid', 'trap', 'local', 'child', 'predator', 'also', 'prostituting', 'money', 'friend', 'having', 'sex', 'own', 'sister', 'game', 'anything', 'are', 'trouble', 'law', 'Howie', 'played', 'Paul', 'Franklin', 'Dano', 'who', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'award-winning', 'debut', 'performance', 'Howie', 'only', 'person', 'turn', 'predator', 'who', 'now', 'eyes', 'own', 'pleasure', 'Howie', 'man', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'explore', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'ball', 'court', 'predator', 'who', 'must', 'chose', 'sexually', 'abuse', 'become', 'mentor', 'show', 'way', 'out', 'eye', 'opening', 'film', 'should', 'speak', 'troubled', 'teens', 'challenges', 'face', 'movie', 'not', 'obvious', 'subjects', 'sex', 'death', 'predators', 'gay', 'etc', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'everything', 'handled', 'pretty', 'good', 'taste', 'more', 'point', 'conscience', 'choices', 'consequences', 'Which', 'lane', 'are', 'traveling', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'One', 'tip', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'VHS', 'VHS', 'quality', 'least', 'copy', 'own', 'very', 'poor', 'only', 'negative', 'point', 'out', 'snake', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'lived']",L.I.E.

Its complex and daring storyline has a lot of depth that forces the audience to think clearly about the scenes and what's truly happening.  The plot was written brilliantly.  Its combination of two different stories connect as one beautifully: a boy, Howie, struggling with many demons in his life and a pedophile, ""Big John"", in action.  Its graphic nature deserves the producers tremendous respect for exploring what few others have dared.  The eyeopening scenes begin as Howie walk along the Long Island Expressway ledge.  Many twists and turns occur, keeping the audience interested, especially Howie's yearning for a deeper relationship with his male best friend and his struggles against his newly widowed father's neglect.  After Howie and his best friend burglarize ""Big John's"" house, the film's complexity builds up to the end, and lots of irony from the first half is discovered.Paul Dano makes a triumphant acting debut as Howie.  He pours every drop of heart and soul through his character.  Such quality proves that he will become a big-name celebrity in the near future.  Brian Cox plays ""Big John"" brilliantly.  Despite many not liking the character, he plays one of the best pedophiles in independant film history.  All other actors, major or minor, also play their roles wonderfully.  Dano and Cox are to be most noted for their highly daring movie roles, deserving tremendous respect as actors.""L.I.E."" is a great film for those looking for something unique.

He is a guy who has lived a James Bond kind of life who likes to... Well, I can't say, but it should be obvious what he likes to do.Howie is a 15-year-old boy who has lost his beloved mother and has a father who is too busy for him and hasn't a clue about what is going on in his son's life.  Howie and his friends are into breaking into the mini-mansions on Long Island for fun and profit.  One night they break into the cellar of Big John's house and steal his prized set of handguns.  Big John goes looking for the perps and what he finds is true paternal love.What makes this an outstanding movie is director Michael Cuesta's relentless and uncompromisingly realistic treatment of what is essentially a taboo coming of age story.  I can tell you that if the theme appeals to you, you will be completely captivated by this movie.  And even if such a tale is not your cup of tea, you might want to see this anyway because it is so very, very well done without a hint of contrivance or pandering.  It is beautifully acted (Paul Dano playing Howie is outstanding, as is Brian Cox as Big John) and beautifully directed and cut.  The script by Stephen M. Ryder, Michael Cuesta and Gerald Cuesta is replete with precise and totally authentic dialogue.  The characters are nuanced and faithfully realized.  The theme of love over predatory sexuality is convincing and worthy.  Furthermore, the sexuality depicted is just vivid enough to make sure we understand what is going on without resorting to anything graphic.(I saw the R-rated version, but I think it is the same as this one, which Amazon says is unrated.  I understand there is an NC-17, but I don't think it matters.  For those who are going to be offended, I think a PG-13 version of this movie--were it possible--would offend them.)I think the resolution of the film, both in terms of what happens to Big John and to Howie was exactly right, but some may find it a little too neat.  Certainly the ending as done does not leave any ambiguities lying around, although I suspect there is a scene where Howie's dad accuses him of stealing his hundred dollar bills somewhere on the cutting room floor, and really that's okay, since it wasn't needed.  Or maybe I missed it.Bottom line: something close to a small masterpiece: the kind of movie that tells us some truths about life that cannot be expressed in so many words--in other words, a work of art.",5,A movie you won't soon forget,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,2534,"['Big', 'John', 'retired', 'marine', 'homosexual', 'pedophile', 'Long', 'Island', 'doorbell', 'Halls', 'Montezuma', 'when', 'rung', 'guy', 'who', 'lived', 'James', 'Bond', 'kind', 'life', 'who', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'what', 'do.Howie', '15-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'lost', 'beloved', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'too', 'busy', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'son', 'life', 'Howie', 'friends', 'are', 'breaking', 'mini-mansions', 'Long', 'Island', 'fun', 'profit', 'One', 'night', 'break', 'cellar', 'Big', 'John', 'house', 'steal', 'prized', 'set', 'handguns', 'Big', 'John', 'looking', 'perps', 'what', 'true', 'paternal', 'love.What', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cuesta', 'relentless', 'uncompromisingly', 'realistic', 'treatment', 'what', 'essentially', 'taboo', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'can', 'tell', 'theme', 'appeals', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'captivated', 'movie', 'even', 'such', 'tale', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'anyway', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'hint', 'contrivance', 'pandering', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'playing', 'Howie', 'outstanding', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Big', 'John', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'cut', 'script', 'Stephen', 'M.', 'Ryder', 'Michael', 'Cuesta', 'Gerald', 'Cuesta', 'replete', 'precise', 'totally', 'authentic', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'are', 'nuanced', 'faithfully', 'realized', 'theme', 'love', 'predatory', 'sexuality', 'convincing', 'worthy', 'Furthermore', 'sexuality', 'depicted', 'just', 'vivid', 'enough', 'make', 'sure', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'resorting', 'anything', 'graphic', 'saw', 'R-rated', 'version', 'think', 'same', 'one', 'Amazon', 'unrated', 'understand', 'NC-17', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'matters', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'offended', 'think', 'PG-13', 'version', 'movie', 'were', 'possible', 'would', 'offend', 'think', 'resolution', 'film', 'terms', 'what', 'Big', 'John', 'Howie', 'was', 'exactly', 'right', 'may', 'find', 'little', 'too', 'neat', 'Certainly', 'ending', 'done', 'not', 'leave', 'ambiguities', 'lying', 'around', 'suspect', 'scene', 'where', 'Howie', 'dad', 'stealing', 'hundred', 'dollar', 'bills', 'somewhere', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'really', 'okay', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'maybe', 'missed', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'something', 'close', 'small', 'masterpiece', 'kind', 'movie', 'truths', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'expressed', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'other', 'words', 'work', 'art']",L.I.E.

It's a feat of incredible acting to see someone so young embody so fully a complex and understated character, and in his brilliantly written plight, you get closer to the experience of adolescence than virtually any other portrayal captured this side of The 400 Blows.  Michael Cuesta, in his directorial debut, captures Howie with lyrical precision, letting every gesture speak mounds of what the character won't say, and occasionally capturing an image of rapt and profound beauty - Howie's right foot coming off the LIE bridge is an image that, even in its innocence, is hard to shake.  However, there's the problem of Brian Cox's ""Big John,"" a performance that, at the time, earned Cox loads of accolades, but a character that's never sat right with me.  We're given full glimpses of his manipulation, of the way his actions have destroyed the life of the boys he's molested (raped?  the word isn't used, but it's valid), but as the movie runs its last lap concerning John, an unsettling realization sinks in - this movie wants to redeem him.  There's a great moment, with Howie at his lowest, that John crucially decides NOT to act, but virtually no posturing will make you actually feel sympathy for this character, and that causes his fate to be, ultimately, dramatically lifeless.  Absolutely watch this movie - for an unmatched capitulation and a full-blooded, three dimensional character given great embodiment by a real talent (Paul Franklin Dano will have his day in the spotlight eventually, I feel certain of that), but I find it impossible to fully meet the film on its terms - just most of them.",4,"Tough and moving, but not flawless",1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,1723,"['may', 'never', 'see', 'fuller', 'characterization', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Paul', 'Franklin', 'Dano', 'Howie', 'Blitzer', 'L.I.E', 'feat', 'incredible', 'acting', 'see', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'embody', 'so', 'fully', 'complex', 'understated', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'plight', 'get', 'closer', 'experience', 'adolescence', 'virtually', 'other', 'portrayal', 'captured', 'side', '400', 'Blows', 'Michael', 'Cuesta', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Howie', 'lyrical', 'precision', 'letting', 'gesture', 'speak', 'mounds', 'what', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'occasionally', 'capturing', 'image', 'rapt', 'profound', 'beauty', 'Howie', 'right', 'foot', 'coming', 'off', 'LIE', 'bridge', 'image', 'even', 'innocence', 'hard', 'shake', 'However', 'problem', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Big', 'John', 'performance', 'time', 'earned', 'Cox', 'loads', 'accolades', 'character', 'never', 'sat', 'right', ""'re"", 'given', 'full', 'glimpses', 'manipulation', 'way', 'actions', 'have', 'destroyed', 'life', 'boys', 'molested', 'raped', 'word', ""n't"", 'used', 'valid', 'movie', 'last', 'lap', 'concerning', 'John', 'unsettling', 'realization', 'sinks', 'movie', 'redeem', 'great', 'moment', 'Howie', 'lowest', 'John', 'crucially', 'NOT', 'act', 'virtually', 'posturing', 'will', 'make', 'actually', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'character', 'fate', 'be', 'ultimately', 'dramatically', 'lifeless', 'Absolutely', 'watch', 'movie', 'unmatched', 'capitulation', 'full-blooded', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'given', 'great', 'embodiment', 'real', 'talent', 'Paul', 'Franklin', 'Dano', 'will', 'have', 'day', 'spotlight', 'eventually', 'feel', 'certain', 'find', 'impossible', 'fully', 'meet', 'film', 'terms', 'just', 'most']",L.I.E.

I probably haven't totally digested it yet, therefore, I am also probably premature in reviewing it, but I'm doing it anyway. The foremost thing I took from this film is a renewed interest in viewing non-mainstream movies, because it reminds you that there are many superb actors and directors out there that are not very well known. As a person who had a lonely, neglected childhood, I can't say this film was easy to watch. It certainly is totally truthful and brilliant in its telling of the vulnerability of youth. All the actors are amazing, especially the young actor who plays ""Howie"", the sensitive, aspiring poet with no mother and an indifferent father. His obvious lonliness and vulnerability are painful to observe, and, though wary, leaves him fair game to almost anyone showing affection or concern. I can't say I didn't feel somewhat uncomfortable when he is befriended by the ex-marine pedophile, who takes a true interest in the boys well-being, abandoning what perhaps was initially just prurient interest. Also a standout is the young actor who portrays ""Gary"", the beautiful hustler, whose life is so unsupervised that the only clue to his home life is an empty house, any parental figure is never introduced in the film. He definatley has the quality of a young Brando, if comparisons can be made. These young actors both seem destined for successful acting careers, though hopefully ""stardom"" will not ruin their talents. It is just so refreshing to see new , unaffected portrayals, I mean, it gets so tiresome seeing the same handful of actors sleepwalking their way through roles, simply because their *starry* name guarantees $$$'s at the box office (sometimes). It is great to see new talent given a chance to blossom. This film is similar in tone and atmosphere to ""My Own Private Idaho"", and ""Howie"" evokes qualities of River Phoenix, who starred in that film. I'm honestly not sure if I thought this was a ""great"" film, I presently think of it as a sad but very good and atmospheric study of real life occurences, with exceptional acting.

It made me hope that L.I.E. would deliver. I dove into the added features first, including the movie's trailer. Upon playing the feature I was a bit leery when I heard the first words by Howie (Paul Dano) at the very beginning. I thought it might be a movie saturated with narration, but it wasn't at all. Let me cut right to the chase: L.I.E. grabbed me and held my attention from start to finish. At some stages I wondered where this disturbingly well- written and acted movie would go. I became uneasy at times as the story developed, but wanted to watch completely before making an opinion. At just a few different moments it was predictable. But director Michael Cuesta still managed to blend everything well.I have yet to watch L.I.E. with the commentaries, but I plan to after submitting this. And I plan to add this movie to my list of essential films. It is an intelligent movie. I empathized with Howie; his character unfolded in some surprising ways. Most of the characters who know Howie have prejudged him without bothering to sincerely want to understand him. And he spends the movie discovering himself, eventually getting help of the most unlikely friend. The filming by DP Romeo Tirone had some nice, but simple visual moments. A very quiet film that spoke volumes.The DVD showed some evidence of what looks like Macrovision protection lines in some of the dark scenes. You may see them if you choose to make your monitor slightly brighter to view some of the dimly- lit scenes. In addition to the trailer there are deleted scenes, an audio option to listen to the commentary of Cuesta or of actor Brian Cox (Big John), plus an option to watch other trailers of movies from New Yorker Video, which has been in existence since 1965. They have added some info about the company that you can read by going past the additional trailers area.***Spoilers revealing the movie's unfolding theme, but essential reading for those who are sensitive on topics about youths*** There are suggestive themes of homosexuality and child molestation, which was why the movie was blackballed with an NC-17 rating (preventing its widespread theatrical release).

Having first seen ""LIE"" on DVD when I was sixteen, I was both jarred and captivated by what unfolded before my eyes. Director Michael Cuesta effortlessly portrays the ""American Dream"" gone wrong, and leaves us with no easy answers as to how and why such things happen.Howie Blitzer is an wealthy Jewish boy living in Long Island, hanging out with kids who aren't nearly as smart or as well-off as he is. Ever since the death of his mother, Howie seems to have gone adrift; his father is too busy taking part in money laundering scandals or having sex with his (much younger) new girlfriend to care what his son is up to.Needless to say, things go downhill from there.While robbing a series of houses, Howie is subsequently blackmailed by a man named ""Big John"", a war vet who has *several* underage boys around -- including Howie's friend Gary, who earns money by prostituting himself on the L.I.E. (Long Island Expressway). What starts off as blackmail turns into genuine concern and companionship as the film progresses, until Howie's world falls apart, the only man left in his life is a pedophile who knows what he's doing is wrong, but simply can't stop.This film isn't for the faint of heart, and makes no excuses for its content or views. The cast (particularly Paul Dano and Brian Cox) give stunning performances. Cox in particular disturbed me several times throughout the film for appearing so real. The ending is what it should be -- unresolved -- because in today's world there are countless kids like Howie, who go unseen by a world that easily forgets just how dangerous being young can be.",5,"Grossly underrated, tragically beautfiful",1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,1746,"['Not', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'jaw-dropping', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'controversial', 'content', 'regarding', 'pedophilia', 'parental', 'negligence', 'Having', 'first', 'seen', 'LIE', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'sixteen', 'was', 'jarred', 'captivated', 'what', 'unfolded', 'eyes', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Cuesta', 'effortlessly', 'American', 'Dream', 'gone', 'wrong', 'easy', 'answers', 'how', 'why', 'such', 'things', 'happen.Howie', 'Blitzer', 'wealthy', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'living', 'Long', 'Island', 'hanging', 'out', 'kids', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'smart', 'as', 'well-off', 'Ever', 'death', 'mother', 'Howie', 'have', 'gone', 'adrift', 'father', 'too', 'busy', 'taking', 'part', 'money', 'laundering', 'scandals', 'having', 'sex', 'much', 'younger', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'care', 'what', 'son', 'up', 'to.Needless', 'say', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'there.While', 'robbing', 'series', 'houses', 'Howie', 'subsequently', 'blackmailed', 'man', 'named', 'Big', 'John', 'war', 'vet', 'who', '*several*', 'underage', 'boys', 'including', 'Howie', 'friend', 'Gary', 'who', 'money', 'prostituting', 'L.I.E', 'Long', 'Island', 'Expressway', 'What', 'off', 'blackmail', 'genuine', 'concern', 'companionship', 'film', 'Howie', 'world', 'apart', 'only', 'man', 'left', 'life', 'pedophile', 'who', 'what', 'doing', 'wrong', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'faint', 'heart', 'excuses', 'content', 'views', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'give', 'stunning', 'performances', 'Cox', 'particular', 'disturbed', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'appearing', 'so', 'real', 'ending', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'unresolved', 'today', 'world', 'are', 'countless', 'kids', 'Howie', 'who', 'go', 'unseen', 'world', 'easily', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'being', 'young', 'can', 'be']",L.I.E.

695502,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000063K0V,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 4]","L.I.E. is the coming of age story of young Howie Blitzer--although not necessarily in the usual ways. Howie (Paul Dano) is a 16 year old troubled kid who is mourning the relatively recent death of his mother in a car accident on the L. I. E. (Long Island Expressway), which is nearby the Blitzer home by coincidence. Howie sometimes views life through the L. I. E. as he contemplates how some people travel east on the highway, some people travel west while some roads ""lead straight to hell.""Howie mourns his mother; but that's far from the end of his worries. He hangs around with other teenagers who find it thrilling to break into houses and steal things. They don't need the things they steal because they themselves come from wealthy families; but the thrill of it all is like a drug for them. Moreover, Howie's father (Bruce Altman) may live in the same house with his son but they are essentially estranged--they communicate poorly at best and the father is all but completely consumed by serious troubles at work and his girlfriend with whom he spends practically every minute.Howie sees a possible way out of his pain when he tinkers with the idea of traveling with one of his buddies so they can start a new life; and there are some latent (or not so latent) romantic feelings between the two young men. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned--and pretty soon Howie is left by his father, his buddy who leaves without him and his other buddies conveniently disappear. It is only then that Howie explores a relationship with a much older man named Big John (Brian Cox). Big John has his eyes on Howie and this could definitely complicate things; it seems that Big John wants something back that Howie and his friends stole when they broke into Big John's home one night.How will Howie find his way to come of age with all this madness around him? He's on his own without much help. Will he ever reconcile with his father? Will he develop a romantic relationship with Big John even though Howie is underage? What if his buddies want to be there for him again? No answers here--watch the movie to find out!The plot moves along at a good, steady pace without being too fast or too slow; and the acting is truly convincing. When people comment that Michael Cuesta has made an extraordinary motion picture, they are correct. The characters are developed in just the right way and you won't forget this film anytime soon. The subject matter of a grown man having his eyes at young boys is masterfully handled with so much finesse that you actually see several good, redeeming qualities about Big John. This film is art.The DVD doesn't have too many extras but there are commentaries by Michael Cuesta and Brian Cox. There are three or four brief deleted scenes. However, the film is so good I don't think you'll mind the relative paucity of extras.Overall, L.I.E. easily succeeds at giving us a striking, memorable portrait of a young man's coming of age. This film is not for family entertainment but it's hardly something for the trashcan.

Not that Big John seemed to be forcing anybody to do anything as much as he knew how to impress and then take advantage of boys.  It's less about age difference and more about differences in status, power, and influence, and one party's willingness to use that influence as currency to buy sex from another.There are also too many peripheral characters in this film which suffer from non-existant development.  It would have been better to eliminate them than to introduce them for no purpose.There are also some dreadfully slow sequences, particularly the times when Big John is singing to himself.

There are some truly meaningful scenes and some sense of redemption and hope that I appreciated.  One of the thematic assertions here is that there is some good and value in everyone.

695505,ANP3R2R4V4GAN,B000063K0V,Omni,"[2, 3]","This is a difficult movie on many levels.Because it's within the reality of the real world, it's more difficult to adapt to its' world which is what we're used to in scifi or horror or period films.  The eerie thing about this film is that it is going on.It starts out about a boy, lost and abandoned by his father, on his own.  And this makes him susceptible to a predator, a sexual predator who adopts young boys to consume them.  This could be done in a simplistic fashion, in the sense that predator goes for little boy but there's a game going on here.  The game is that the boys this man goes after are smart and it's smart characters on all sides that make a film crackle.The boys may be inexperienced but they aren't stupid to the world or to people's intent or their value to them.  Eventually it becomes a cat and mouse game of teh boy and the predator with him playing the old man much as a woman would a much older man.  Creating a sexual tension to unseat the young man who lives iwth the predator and then consume him himself.  Now to apply such calculation to a child may seem dark or projecting upon the film but even the characters are aware and comment on this.  I think that in one way this film asserts that children, teenagers, are people, thinking, feeling, needing people.  The pedophile is then put at the mercy of his addiction, his desires because once someone knows your button, especially such a dangerous button, they have a measure of control over you.However the predator is a predator and has logically done thsi many, many times so he sees and knows the game this boy is playing with him, it's been played before.  But like a true predator, the chase, the hunt is so enticing that he keeps pushing himself further and further to get his target.What makes this movie better than just a pedophile film is that we get to see that this young boy is exploring his sexuliaty, with a crush on his roguish friend who secretly is a victim of the pedophile and others for money and favors.  This movie explores the fact that no one, even children who are abandoned to their own devices by bad parents become both victims and predators themselves.To watch the parents ignore their children until eventually the rogue boy runs away and the other boy is caught by the predator because he has no where to go.  It is heartbreaking because the boy loses the rogue boy he loves, who runs away ripping off his best friend's father, and he's eventually played around with the attention of a pedophile so much that the comfort of this man's desires becomes the love he seeks.  Even when the young man who the pedophile kicks out temporarily to create a seductive environment for the boy eventually lashes out at both the boy, he saves his rage for the predator.I purposefully didn't go into actors names here because it's so vitally important that they become invisible, that they become their characters who are all linked by the Long Island Expressway.  I've stood on the overpass much as the boy does and contemplated my existence, etc. and one can see a thoughtful young man being marred by love, a lack of.  Though the film does show redemption as the boy eventually visits his newly imprisoned father and tells him that he loves him, supports him in his Enron-esque criminal problems, because all they have is each other.  But he also warns his father that he will tolerate no more abuse, that he is a person.

L.I.E is totally original, and it keeps your attention from start to finish. After reading some of the member reviews first before seeing the film I expected to see some pretty depraved footage. Surprisingly the only actual sexual footage is heterosexual in nature between consenting adults. There is some suggestive visuals that hint at homosexual teenage fantasy among the central teen characters in the film but nothing is actually ever played out in that respect. Brian Cox turns in an incredible performance as an almost likable and respectable(even though the suggestion as such should be considered almost criminal)sexual pervert. The over all nobility of this character leads one to believe that at his center he is a man with a good heart who is simply torn by his own uncontrollable desires that he cannot control. If he had not been a sexual pervert attracted to under age boys, he would have been a downright respectable father figure and devoted friend to these young men. But that is what is the entire point of the story. Sexual perverts can often be the nicest people on earth, which makes them all the more difficult to identify and to resist for those that become enticed and then victimized by them. I think this film is a seminal story about the realities that are currently existing in modern day america. Sexual perverts just like him are everywhere. They appear respectable, well liked, and kind, yet the damage they do to the impressionable leaves life long scars and pain that sometimes never heal.

E.&lt;/strong> (Michael Cuesta, 2001)There are some movies that are just guaranteed to [censored for Amazon consumption] Hollywood off. That usually happens because someone tackles subject matter in a more realistic, complex way than Hollywood, as a culture, wants it treated, and the outcome of such films going up against the machine is inevitable no matter the quality of those films: they open very small, disappear from theatres quickly, and are then relegated to obscurity. We saw it in 2004 with the excellent &lt;em>The Woodsman&lt;/em>, a movie that should have been a blockbuster indie drama, with an all-star cast, pitch-perfect direction, and a great script, that ended up opening on just six screens solely because the film was about a pedophile struggling to keep his urges in check while trying to adjust to life outside prison. Go back a few years before that and you find Michael Cuesta's first film, the brave, beautiful &lt;em>L.I.E.&lt;/em>, which deals with ephebophilia (attraction to teens, as opposed to pedophilia, attraction to children), but does it in an even more confrontational way: it's form the point of view of the teen in question, Howie Blitzer (&lt;em>Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/em>'s Paul Dano). The movie--which contains no explicit sex whatsoever, and its violence is mostly suggested--was slapped with an NC-17 rating (unsuccessfully appealed by the studio), opened on just twelve screens, and yes, faded into obscurity relatively quickly. This is, to put it bluntly, a crime, and as the studio argued during its appeal, the arbitrary nature of the MPAA, who can stick an NC-17 on a film with no explicit sex and less onscreen violence than one sees in most PG-13 films because of its subject matter, is far more shocking than anything portrayed on the screen here.Plot: Howie Blitzer is fifteen, bored, and living on Long Island with his workaholic father (&lt;em>Glengarry Glen Ross&lt;/em>' Bruce Altman) and dad's new squeeze (Tatiana Burgos in her only screen appearance). It's been a while since Howie's mother passed on, but that doesn't make him feel any less that his father's actions are less than honorable. As well, Howie is coming of age very confused; he and his friends wholeheartedly buy into the stereotype of the nihilist/ultra-machismo manly-man (when bored, they pass the time by breaking into rich peoples' homes, and one of the movie's more amusing conceits is that Howie is incapable of seeing how much like his own those homes are), but Howie feels a growing attraction to his best friend, Gary (&lt;em>The Battle of Shaker Heights&lt;/em>' Billy Kay), though whether Gary returns that affection or whether he's just stringing Howie along is a question that (spoiler alert!) remains unanswered throughout the film; one gets the impression Gary doesn't quite know himself, but he's bought so much harder into the stereotype that he's even more conflicted than Howie. In any case, one night, the two of them break into what seems to be a random house where John Harrigan (&lt;em>Manhunter&lt;/em>'s Brian Cox) is having a birthday party upstairs, and in the process of lifting a case containing Harrigan's Vietnam-era pistols, someone makes a wrong move, and Harrigan comes down to investigate the noise, almost catching the boys in the process. Turns out that the house wasn't quite as random as Howie thought, but the end result is not at all what he expected--Harrigan befriends the boy, and while there is an obvious element of lust involved (Harrigan lives with a much younger male paramour already), most of the movie's tension comes from whether Harrigan--or Howie--is going to take their relationship in a sexual direction, or whether Harrigan really does love Howie as the son he never had.This is tough stuff indeed, and that Cuesta (&lt;em>Tell Tale&lt;/em>), who also co-wrote the script with his brother Gerald (an AD on Abel Ferrara's &lt;em>King of New York&lt;/em>) and Stephen M. Ryder (&lt;em>South of the Moon&lt;/em>), is capable of pulling it off with the honesty and forthrightness he does is praiseworthy in and of itself; even if the resulting movie had been less accomplished, the script would be a strong recommend. But as Cuesta's directorial career since has borne out, this guy is no slouch in the canvas seat, either. Cuesta is a very bleak director, and both his film and TV (&lt;em>Dexter&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Six Feet Under&lt;/em>) choices bear that out. This is a guy who deals with ugly subject matter, and knows how to make an ugly film to couch it, but to make that ugliness compelling indeed. One cannot understate, especially in this film, the contribution made by Cuesta's cinematographer here, Romeo Tirone, who aside from his collaborations with Cuesta (he's the DP on both &lt;em>Dexter&lt;/em> and &lt;em>True Blood&lt;/em>, another series where Cuesta drops in to direct on occasion) was also involved in &lt;em>Cry_Wolf&lt;/em>, about which the cinematography may have been the only noteworthy thing. Tirone knows bleak. The two of them are a match made in... Siberia, maybe.The movie's one real weakness is in its ending. Now I grant you, given the setup (and especially the climax, which is perfectly Hobbesian: ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short""), the movie's final shot could only end in one of two ways, and whichever option Cuesta chose, I'd be sitting here telling you it's facile. Which may point to some subtle flaws in the movie's construction, but I'm not willing to dig that far into it to uncover them. There is too much honesty, passion, and downright substance here to dig so far into it I could be accused of being a deconstructionist in order to figure out where the film goes wrong (if, indeed, it does, and I'm not overthinking this). Crappy ending or not, I still love it.I will warn you, like &lt;em>The Woodsman&lt;/em>, this is not in any way a fast-paced film; like that movie, it should have been a blockbuster indie drama, the kind of thing that gets huge word of mouth to compensate for the complete lack of publicity from the Hollywood machine. But when your movie opens on just twelve screens, and in its biggest expansion plays in thirty, how many people can you really get to spread the word? The critics did what they could (and they were effusive in their praise; the movie has an 83% at Rotten Tomatoes), and the movie gained a solid core of fans from the outset, but here it is over a decade later and the movie has barely cracked five thousand ratings on IMDB, where it has a more-than-respectable 7.1 rating--the public likes it too, in general, those that have seen it. Well, it exists on DVD, pops up occasionally on Netflix Instant, and is very much worth your time to seek out. One of the greatest film works of the twenty-first century thus far. **** ",5,Phenomenal.,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,6822,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'L', 'I.', 'E.', 'lt', '>', 'Michael', 'Cuesta',
