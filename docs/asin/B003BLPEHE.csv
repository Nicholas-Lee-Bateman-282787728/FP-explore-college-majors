1335876,A1B53UQIMZHOVN,B003BLPEHE,Anthony Caton,"[152, 153]","The 1950's were the heyday for syndicated programs.  In some cases syndicated shows such as ""Sea Hunt,"" ""I Led 3 Lives,"" ""26 Men,"" ""Whirlybirds,"" and ""Death Valley Days,"" among others, were just as popular as their network brethren.  Arguably the most popular non-network program of the decade was ""Highway Patrol,"" starring Broderick Crawford.  An Oscar-winner for ""All the King's Men,"" Crawford had gone through a period of starring in mostly ""B"" pictures, and was looking for a regular payday.  Here you will find, in PRISTINE condition, the complete season 1 of ""Highway Patrol.""  Unlike bootleg copies of the show, you get the original opening sequence of a car quickly arriving at a highway patrol roadblock, and narrator Art Gilmore's preview of that evening's program.  Also, Crawford returns at the end of the show to give sage advice, such as, ""Clowns should only be seen at the circus, not on the highway,"" or ""Leave your blood at the Red Cross, not on the highway.""  I love it!  In addition, you get the complete closing credits of HP.  Rotating sergeants include future stars Paul Burke (""Naked City,"" ""12 O'clock High""), Stuart Whitman (""Cimarron Strip""), along with character actors William Boyett (""Adam-12"") and Terry Frost (countless 50's westerns).  And don't miss a pre-""Rawhide"" Clint Eastwood as a slick-haired biker in episode 27.  The audio on ""Highway Patrol"" is a 10, the video an easy 9 (only the occasional speck), and this is a one time chance to acquire a 55-year-old TV classic.  Snap this one up, and maybe season 2 will be offered later in the year.  Thank you for reading my review.",5,GOT MINE TODAY!  WOW!

The producers chose automobiles that would become classics and seeing them now in their prime is pure enjoyment.  The quality of the picture is better than any bootleg copies and immensely better than I remember seeing on our 19 inch Zenith.

1335894,A2T049UQONS0OY,B003BLPEHE,Larry VanDeSande,"[5, 6]","My grandfather was a county sheriff in the 1950s, riding high in a 1954 Ford sedan and catching bad guys with neither a spotlight nor a gumball machine, just a hand held red light. He told me a story once of going on a call to a guy that had murdered his wife. When grandpa got there, the wife was dead and the guy was sitting in his rocker with shotgun on lap.""Are you going to shoot me?"" Grandpa asked.""Nope, I got her and now I'm waiting for her boyfriend,"" he said.Broderick Crawford, one of the most distinctive American actors of the 1950s, never acted out anything like this in ""Highway Patrol,"" the great series that ran on American TV from 1955-59. Crawford, who was head man at the highway patrol, usually barked at officers to get him a '58 Buick Roadmaster or to get the bad guys. He was a mean, tough SOB and a macho man in an era when such men ruled the roost on American TV.Crawford was also an accomplished film actor, having won an Oscar during the crime dramaAll the King's Menwhere he played the other side of the fence -- a master criminal. He also played another sort of lawman in 1977'sPrivate Files of J. Edgar Hooverreplete with the FBI chief's relationship with a boyfriend in the bureau. This Broderick Crawford was a far cry from the tough sheriff on ""Highway Patrol.""Another reason to buy this, aside from Broderick Crawford cult of personality, is to see some authentic 1950s American cars and scenes. Crime films made today, such asL.A. Confidential, cannot really capture the essence of 1950s America that you witness inArmored Car Robbery, another noirish crime drama from 1950 that featured gravely-voiced Charles McGraw, another iconic actor from the era.So bust your budget and pick up the first year of ""Highway Patrol"" for a view of America you won't see today.

We loved him unconditionally and didn't care that he had a broken nose, a bit of baldness going on, a big pudgy tummy, or a huge dented scar on his forehead that looked like something left from a childhood accident.BC also taught us to know the difference between himself and his character as he always ended his show with, ""This is Broderick Crawford, see you next week."" And he always gave us a safety tip. (To this day, I have never gotten a ticket for speeding.)What is neat about those old shows now is that they show parts of California the way they were back in the fifties... unfinished highway, open undeveloped land and other things.... and it is fun to notice the prices of things... .69 cents for steak, 12,500 for a home, or .16 cents for men's shirts. I also understand that some of those buildings used in the show still exist today.It is also fun to watch sometimes because of all the young actors who appeared on various HP episodes and went on to be stars, plus some of the scripts were written by various people (Gene Roddenberry for one).I just wish that MGM could be persuaded into cleaning up and releasing the rest of the seasons.",5,Highway Patrol Season 1,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,1922,"['Highway', 'Patrol', 'Season', '1Well', 'price', 'packaging', 'excellent', 'easy', 'use', 'keeps', 'discs', 'safe', 'quality', 'videos', 'was', 'excellent', 'picture', 'was', 'sharp', 'clear', 'one', 'episode', 'Retired', 'Gangster', 'scene', 'where', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'small', 'bug', 'walking', 'camera', 'lens.BC', 'was', 'one', 'childhood', 'heroes', 'fifties', 'young', 'friends', 'Dan', 'Matthews', 'was', 'bigger', 'hero', 'Superman', 'Tarzan.Dan', 'Matthews', 'was', ""'believable"", 'hero', 'was', 'down-to-earth', 'cop', 'who', 'went', 'bad', 'guys', 'comforted', 'victims', 'heaven', 'help', 'anyone', 'who', 'threatened', 'child', 'watch', 'children', 'saw', 'right', 'thru', 'gruff', 'bull-dog', 'exterior', 'barking', 'out', 'orders', 'woof', 'woof', 'woof', 'saw', 'heart', 'gold', 'loved', 'unconditionally', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'had', 'broken', 'nose', 'bit', 'baldness', 'going', 'big', 'pudgy', 'tummy', 'huge', 'dented', 'scar', 'forehead', 'looked', 'something', 'left', 'childhood', 'accident.BC', 'also', 'taught', 'know', 'difference', 'character', 'always', 'ended', 'show', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'see', 'next', 'week', 'always', 'gave', 'safety', 'tip', 'day', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'ticket', 'speeding', 'What', 'neat', 'old', 'shows', 'now', 'show', 'parts', 'California', 'way', 'were', 'back', 'fifties', 'unfinished', 'highway', 'open', 'undeveloped', 'land', 'other', 'things', 'fun', 'notice', 'prices', 'things', '.69', 'cents', 'steak', '12,500', 'home', '.16', 'cents', 'men', 'shirts', 'also', 'understand', 'buildings', 'used', 'show', 'still', 'exist', 'today.It', 'also', 'fun', 'watch', 'sometimes', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'appeared', 'various', 'HP', 'episodes', 'went', 'be', 'stars', 'scripts', 'were', 'written', 'various', 'people', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'one', '.I', 'just', 'wish', 'MGM', 'could', 'be', 'persuaded', 'cleaning', 'up', 'releasing', 'rest', 'seasons']",HIGHWAY PATROL Season 1
