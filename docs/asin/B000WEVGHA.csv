For me, I have a finite amount of time available, so I'd rather face more challenging moves that trying to add on more time so for me this was a negative.I had the original Biggest Loser workout DVD, and as I said in my review then, it was distracting that everyone was off-rhythm. For some reason, the producers of these DVDs must think that's a plus, because it's even worse here, where they're all *obviously* out of sync and all over the place. ""Do I have my arms up or down on this beat? The woman in front has her arms down, but the guy right behind has his up...' It looks sloppy and it's harder to follow than it should be. Using real people is fine, but they should cast people who have a sense of rhythm.

A warm-up is supposed to gradually prepare your body for working out, not tire it out before you even get started.  Seriously!  Jumping jacks for warm-up?!

I'm in the process of getting back in shape, and I figured that:1) I could handle this -- and even if I couldn't do it all, I was glad that the sections were customizable.2) Being a product of ""The Biggest Loser"", the trainers wouldn't be the standard narcissistic jerks that turn into P.E. teachers and gym trainers.And both of these were true -- I don't think I could have made it through the entire 50-minute workout the first time. And Bob was offering encouragement and beginner alternatives a lot.But I still couldn't do more than 20 minutes of this because Bob does each exercise only once and then the camera goes to the students WHO DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY'RE DOING while Bob wanders around and talks. So every move that he wanted me to do, if I didn't pick up how to do it the first time, I was lost, because I couldn't follow the students' bad form.I understand -- and greatly appreciate -- the fact that the students are ""regular"" people. It's very encouraging to see people like me reaching for the same goal.

Jillian's section (10 mins) is good too and Kim's (10 mins) is the simplest. I actually incorporate some Turbo Jam moves into her kickboxing routine to maximize my results.How they've structured the DVD is that Bob is easiest, then Jillian, then Kim.

This can't be underrated; as someone who has trouble with more complicated aerobics, and won't go near a step class because my left and right get confused, it's good to do a workout where coordination is not an issue.  Also because no one is doing the workout in time to the music, you can just go whatever pace you want and it's fine.- Good cardio.  There's a 5-minute warmup, then three main workout segments of 20, 10, and 10 minutes accordingly, then a 5-minute stretch.  My heart rate went up even during the warmup and stayed up for the three main workouts.  Of the three main segments, the first two were more high-impact and the third is lower impact (almost all cardio kickboxing stuff) and somewhat easier.- Basically because lots of it is high-impact, you get a lot of bang for your buck in terms of calories burned in a short amount of time.Cons:- Too many lunges in the first main segment.- Jillian's segment (2nd main one) not very adaptable for pre-natal use.  It should be avoided altogether after 1st trimester--there's no one doing low-impact modifications in this segment and it's way too jostly jumping around for 10 minutes.- Kinda boring, unless you like boot-camp type workouts, which I don't.  I'm glad the segments are short because during the first two main ones, I kept wondering when they'd be over.  I enjoyed the 3rd one more--the cardio kickboxing one--in terms of being more fun and a little dance-y.- Didn't really like the yoga stretch cooldown--a bunch of inhaling the arms up and down into prayer, then a warrior series with a triangle thrown in.  If I wanted yoga I'd do a different DVD.  Why I didn't like it?  It seemed tossed in because yoga's ""in""--it didn't seem to flow with the rest of the material.  I thought it should have more conventional stretches, particularly addressing the hamstrings--which aren't really stretched that well by triangle pose.  With all the work gastrocs and hamstrings get from the high impact nature of this DVD, they really need to be stretched more; if I don't my body really complains.  It's better actually to repeat the warm-up than do the cool-down here, as the warm-up stretches the needed areas.Basically, if I'm short on time but want to have a cardio workout, I might pop this one in.

I've completed a half marathon, run 20 miles weekly and have done numerous workout DVD's...including the original Biggest Loser DVD and even Jillian's separate workout DVD's.  I don't say this to toot my own horn, but to give you a gauge as to how someone who's in good shape views this DVD.At least I thought I was in good shape until I popped this DVD in.  This is a crazy hard workout that will workout every fiber in your body.Bob starts with Level 1 and gives you 20 minutes of heart pounding, lunge screaming and weight lifting cardio...at Level 1??Jillian is next and she doesn't fail at delivering a 10 minute, high intensity level 2 cardio workout.  Like I stated earlier, I've got her whole collection of workout DVD's and this 10 minutes with her, is just as bad (good) as a few of the 20 minute DVD's I've got with her.Bringing up the rear is Kim...and this one is a let down.  For a level 3 cardio workout, she barely breaks even with Bob's Level 1.  Now, if you do all 3 in a row like I do, then it does get a little tiring at the end with her, but if you just pop in her section for 10 minutes, I don't think you'd be pushing yourself very hard.

One is 20 minutes, the other two are only 10 minutes long. {kind of a let down}. While I am in pretty good physical condition, and  workout 6 days a week someone who is not so informed or who is very overweight could have trouble with this video. The 10 minute section Jillian teaches recycles some moves from her Boost Your Metabolism video,(high knees and a few others).The other ladies portions seems like a waste of time to me.There is a decent amount of lunges in this video. If you do not use proper form, i could see you having knee issues. Also while I commend them on using actual contestants it is distracting to watch them while exercising. A lot of them seem to be doing their own thing so its confusing. I know some people need to modify for their fitness level but they should use people who can at least do the workout somewhat in correct form.Overall Bob Harpers section is the only one that I like, and most days I just do his twice then cool down.

Smith,"[7, 7]","I'm a busy student who doesn't have the time or the money for a gym membership, and as summer approached, I realized that working out OUTSIDE in the oppressive Miami heat was just not going to work. I've been wanting to shed about 8-10 lbs before school starts back again. I began my search for workout DVDs with some skepticism, thinking that it was going to be difficult to get a good workout from a DVD.Oh, how I was wrong! I've watched The Biggest Loser show a few times and liked the favorable reviews on this DVD, so I decided to try it out. WHOA! What a workout! It is TOUGH and I sweat like crazy from doing this. My heart rate gets up very high, and I'm a 24 year old who is not overweight by any means. The first time I did this, I was sore for two days. You can really feel it all over your body. It is a challenging workout, and I'm having to work up to doing all three cardio sections. As of today, I can only do Bob's section (section 1) and about 3/4 of Jillian's (section 2). I haven't even touched Kim's section yet (section 3). Those jumping lunges in Bob's section are KILLER. If that doesn't get your heart rate pumping then you must be Superman.The biggest plus is the fact that you don't need any equipment except for maybe a couple of small weights (but even those are optional as Bob states on the DVD), AND you don't need a lot of space AT ALL for this. I live in a small apartment and can easily do it there with no problems whatsoever. I've even been able to do it in my bedroom at my parent's house which is cluttered with furniture. I would recommend, however, doing this on carpet rather than tile. There is one part where you need to get down into pushup position, and that just hurts on tile, especially if you get tired and need to drop down to your knees for a bit.Also, one last comment, some folks have complained about Bob being annoying in the DVD, but I like him. I like the talking and the motivation. I need that to keep going otherwise I get lazy and start slacking off. ;) In addition, it's nice to see the biggest loser cast on the DVD. It's nice to see women who are not 100 lbs with six-pack abs. It's nice to see normal women just fighting the good fight when it comes to losing weight. That's refreshing to me.All in all, a great DVD and I am pleasantly surprised at what a great workout I'm getting.

Considering how much the cast members of ""TBL"" have lost, that shouldn't be a surprise.I could feel myself getting stronger with each workout, and everyone commented that I was in great shape within just a few months of having given birth.  That was a year ago, and last fall, I started going to the gym, running and working out on the elliptical.  I really like a challenge, so when you read that, don't think for a second that I was going easy on myself.  But I recently had to drop the running due to back problems, so I started adding this workout back into my routine once or twice a week.  And every time I do it, I wish I'd never stopped. You just get real definition and visible results from it.I feel like I can confidently recommend this for people of all fitness levels because of the ""customizing"" workout options.  I will say that I'm not a huge fan of the cool-down (I usually skip and do my own stretches).  It's called ""Yoga"", but there just isn't enough real honest-to-goodness stretching, just focusing on your breathing, which is nice and all, but...  I also think that there are some gaps between the different exercises -- usually I can squeeze in a couple extra before they start doing it.

Some people can't stick with in-home workouts or DVD exercising, but if you really do these workouts and stick to the program you will definitely see results! My husband doesn't like doing DVD workouts, he much prefers going to the gym and lifting weights or doing his cardio outside, but even he says that this DVD really tests your endurance. I particularly like it because it is motivational and I don't have to worry about what other people think or who is staring at me as I'm working out because I'm in the comfort of my own home. I can really feel a difference when I am doing this program and I can tell it is working and building my stamina. I really get a full body workout with this, which is great in a cardio workout! I think this will be a great benefit to my overall health. I was over 200 pounds when we bought this DVD and I was able to do the workout pretty well, so it doesn't matter how big your are, anyone can do this! It's all about knowing your body and your limits and not pushing yourself past them, but doing your best to keep up. You have to have the personal drive for this to work for you, otherwise you will end up quitting and you won't see any results. There are no trainers to tell you to keep going, so you have to have the drive to make this worth the money. If you have that then this will be a great deal for you!I am currently 170 pounds, but feel it necessary to note that I have also drastically changed my diet and I am taking supplements (hydroxycut) to help my weight loss.

1109007,AOVOJZZJP7BOC,B000WEVGHA,Oneironaut,"[2, 2]","I have never seen the TV show and I'm not overweight.  I lift three times a week here at home and since I canceled my gym membership I haven't been doing any cardio (I used to use the elliptical machine for that).  I hate cardio and since I'm pretty lean to begin with, I didn't mind dropping it from my routine.  But then I noticed a teeny bit of a spare tire beginning to form which freaked me out so I figured I better buck up and find a cardio workout.  I didn't want to have to get all kinds of new equipment and I didn't want an overly-perky, irritating instructor barking orders at me.  I went through a couple of other DVD's (which sucked) before reading the reviews here and since they were generally all very positive reviews, I decided to give it a go.I have not been disappointed so far.  The exercises are simple to learn but are also extremely challenging.  Bob's warm up and level one workouts really get me sweating.  Even though one of the cast members demonstrates a low-impact version of the workouts, I would definitely not recommend this for complete novices.  You should already be familiar with your body and what it can take.The other two workouts might not seem that challenging by themselves, but all three are supposed to be performed in a row (eventually).  You start with the warm up and level one workout, then add level two, and finally level three.  There is also a cool-down workout so in the end you'll be doing five workouts in a row for a total of about 50 minutes.  That's a tough workout!  I'm only on level one and I can't wait to get through the whole thing.The instructors are fairly tolerable and not over-the-top Barbie dolls, but I find that the cast members make the workouts more fun.  Being a pretty cynical kind of guy, I was ready to ""make fun of the fatties"", but they're clearly having such a good time and I can really appreciate that they've done something to get themselves into shape without slavishly trying to become ""skinny"".  A section called ""Inspirational Stories"" showcases some of their success stories from the show and their journeys are quite impressive.  So I liked that rather than robotic fitness clones, there were some real people with different body types and goals all there having fun and working up a sweat along with you and sometimes goofing or falling behind.  It lets you know that this isn't a choreography lesson, it's a workout, and that it's more important to keep your heart rate going than worry about staying in lockstep with everyone else.The coolest thing about the DVD is that you can design your own workouts.  You can select the pre-set workouts for weeks 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 that take all the guesswork out and play the workouts in the appropriate order.  But you can also create your own workout kind of like a video jukebox.  If you have your own warm up routine and want to skip the one on the DVD, you can, then select level one, or levels two and three together, or levels one and three, etc.  This makes it very flexible and keeps you from getting too bored with the same workout.  I do yoga after cardio, so I generally skip Bob's cool-down workout.  At some point I might want to replace the level one workout and do level two twice, plus the warmup.You can also play the workouts with or without the instructor's voice track and have just the music, which leads me to my one quibble...  the music is NOT very energetic.  It's got a tempo you can use to keep time, but it's just ""dramatic"" instrumental reality show music, not really something to get you moving.  I prefer high-energy dance music or at least something fun that I know the words to, but this is easily fixed since I just turn down the video volume and play my own cardio playlist on itunes.  But still, I think a good cardio workout should have some high energy music behind it.I haven't given it five stars because of the music and because I'm too new at it to see if it really yield results, but if my first two weeks are any indication, I'm sure it will work great and I'll be back soon to change the rating.",5,"Finally, a perfect cardio workout",1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,4074,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'overweight', 'lift', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'here', 'home', 'canceled', 'gym', 'membership', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', 'cardio', 'used', 'use', 'elliptical', 'machine', 'hate', 'cardio', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'lean', 'begin', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'dropping', 'routine', 'then', 'noticed', 'teeny', 'bit', 'spare', 'tire', 'beginning', 'form', 'freaked', 'so', 'figured', 'better', 'buck', 'up', 'find', 'cardio', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'get', 'kinds', 'new', 'equipment', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'overly-perky', 'irritating', 'instructor', 'barking', 'orders', 'went', 'couple', 'other', 'DVD', 'sucked', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'were', 'generally', 'very', 'positive', 'reviews', 'decided', 'give', 'go.I', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', 'so', 'far', 'exercises', 'are', 'simple', 'learn', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'challenging', 'Bob', 'warm', 'up', 'level', 'one', 'really', 'get', 'sweating', 'Even', 'one', 'cast', 'members', 'low-impact', 'version', 'workouts', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'complete', 'novices', 'should', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'body', 'what', 'can', 'take.The', 'other', 'two', 'workouts', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'challenging', 'three', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'performed', 'row', 'eventually', 'start', 'warm', 'up', 'level', 'one', 'workout', 'then', 'add', 'level', 'two', 'finally', 'level', 'three', 'also', 'cool-down', 'workout', 'so', 'end', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'five', 'workouts', 'row', 'total', '50', 'minutes', 'tough', 'workout', ""'m"", 'only', 'level', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'instructors', 'are', 'fairly', 'tolerable', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'find', 'cast', 'members', 'make', 'workouts', 'more', 'fun', 'Being', 'pretty', 'cynical', 'kind', 'guy', 'was', 'ready', 'make', 'fun', 'fatties', ""'re"", 'clearly', 'having', 'such', 'good', 'time', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', 'get', 'shape', 'slavishly', 'trying', 'become', 'skinny', 'section', 'called', 'Inspirational', 'Stories', 'success', 'stories', 'show', 'journeys', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive', 'So', 'liked', 'rather', 'robotic', 'fitness', 'clones', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'different', 'body', 'types', 'goals', 'there', 'having', 'fun', 'working', 'up', 'sweat', 'sometimes', 'goofing', 'falling', 'know', ""n't"", 'choreography', 'lesson', 'workout', 'more', 'important', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'going', 'worry', 'staying', 'lockstep', 'everyone', 'else.The', 'coolest', 'thing', 'DVD', 'can', 'design', 'own', 'workouts', 'can', 'select', 'pre-set', 'workouts', 'weeks', '1-2', '3-4', '5-6', 'take', 'guesswork', 'out', 'play', 'workouts', 'appropriate', 'order', 'can', 'also', 'create', 'own', 'workout', 'kind', 'video', 'jukebox', 'have', 'own', 'warm', 'up', 'routine', 'want', 'skip', 'one', 'DVD', 'can', 'then', 'select', 'level', 'one', 'levels', 'two', 'three', 'together', 'levels', 'one', 'three', 'etc', 'very', 'flexible', 'getting', 'too', 'bored', 'same', 'workout', 'do', 'yoga', 'cardio', 'generally', 'skip', 'Bob', 'cool-down', 'workout', 'point', 'might', 'want', 'replace', 'level', 'one', 'workout', 'do', 'level', 'two', 'twice', 'warmup.You', 'can', 'also', 'play', 'workouts', 'instructor', 'voice', 'track', 'have', 'just', 'music', 'one', 'quibble', 'music', 'NOT', 'very', 'energetic', 'got', 'tempo', 'can', 'use', 'keep', 'time', 'just', 'dramatic', 'instrumental', 'reality', 'show', 'music', 'not', 'really', 'something', 'get', 'moving', 'prefer', 'high-energy', 'dance', 'music', 'least', 'something', 'fun', 'know', 'words', 'easily', 'fixed', 'just', 'turn', 'down', 'video', 'volume', 'play', 'own', 'cardio', 'playlist', 'itunes', 'still', 'think', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'should', 'have', 'high', 'energy', 'music', 'it.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'music', ""'m"", 'too', 'new', 'see', 'really', 'yield', 'results', 'first', 'two', 'weeks', 'are', 'indication', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'work', 'great', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'soon', 'change', 'rating']",Biggest Loser Cardio Max

Good variety of exercises, and you could use this as a strength/cardio component to add to a Callanetics or yoga workout.What I didn't like about this workout:Few form pointers:  Bob briefly performs each exercise, and mentions form pointers, but out of all the exercisers, only 1 or 2 are even approaching proper form, which is not good as the camera is usually focused on the others who are nowhere near it.No indication of the correct pace or cadence at which to perform the exercises when you do get up to speed--it is very easy to overwork one side at the expense of the other. He seems to be working in 30-second segments at times, but not all the time. He also counts backwards, which is fine except you don't know where you're starting from.If you have knee problems and/or are in similar physical condition to the BL contestants on the DVD you will want to modify the movements somewhat. There are a lot of squats, knee bends and some jumping.The other two workouts with Jillian and Kim have the same problems with lack of proper form pointers and a lot of squats and knee bends, and some jumping. They are only 10 minutes each, so it may or may not be an issue for some people. Bob's workout uses light weights, the other two do not. You can do most of the workouts on carpet if you have to, but be careful.The cool down did not have nearly enough stretching in it to be worth doing.When they come out with the next DVD they need to have a short section where Bob demonstrates proper form (both from the front and the side), include some exercises which can get your heart rate up without being so hard on the knees, and put more actual stretching into the cool down.3.5 stars, but rent it first.",3,"Bob's workout is great, but DVD lacks form pointers",1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,1855,"['Bob', 'workout', 'far', 'best', 'three', 'short', 'enough', 'get', 'way', 'yet', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'results', 'done', 'consistently', 'Good', 'variety', 'exercises', 'could', 'use', 'strength/cardio', 'component', 'add', 'Callanetics', 'yoga', 'workout.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'workout', 'Few', 'form', 'pointers', 'Bob', 'briefly', 'performs', 'exercise', 'mentions', 'form', 'pointers', 'exercisers', 'only', '1', '2', 'are', 'even', 'approaching', 'proper', 'form', 'not', 'good', 'camera', 'usually', 'focused', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'nowhere', 'it.No', 'indication', 'correct', 'pace', 'cadence', 'perform', 'exercises', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'up', 'speed', 'very', 'easy', 'overwork', 'one', 'side', 'expense', 'other', 'be', 'working', '30-second', 'segments', 'times', 'not', 'time', 'also', 'backwards', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'starting', 'from.If', 'have', 'knee', 'problems', 'and/or', 'are', 'similar', 'physical', 'condition', 'BL', 'contestants', 'DVD', 'will', 'want', 'modify', 'movements', 'somewhat', 'are', 'lot', 'squats', 'knee', 'bends', 'jumping.The', 'other', 'two', 'workouts', 'Jillian', 'Kim', 'have', 'same', 'problems', 'lack', 'proper', 'form', 'pointers', 'lot', 'squats', 'knee', 'bends', 'jumping', 'are', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'issue', 'people', 'Bob', 'workout', 'light', 'weights', 'other', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'can', 'do', 'most', 'workouts', 'carpet', 'have', 'be', 'careful.The', 'cool', 'down', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'nearly', 'enough', 'stretching', 'be', 'worth', 'doing.When', 'come', 'out', 'next', 'DVD', 'need', 'have', 'short', 'section', 'where', 'Bob', 'proper', 'form', 'front', 'side', 'include', 'exercises', 'can', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'being', 'so', 'hard', 'knees', 'put', 'more', 'actual', 'stretching', 'cool', 'down.3.5', 'stars', 'rent', 'first']",Biggest Loser Cardio Max

First the customizable option is truly customizable. If you want to do the the first 20 minute workout (lower intensity) 3 times in a row you can.  You are able to truly choose your workout level and time.The first 20 minute aerobic section includes some strenth training (with light weights) which I like.  I don't like doing Push-ups in the middle of aerobics.  I think lowering to the ground while your heart rate is up, is detrimental.  This is easily fixed, but just doing the other moves while the TV group is on the ground.The second and third sections are higher impact and intensity 10 minute sessions.  Again you can do these once, twice, or three times if you want.I will keep this in my library",4,An improvement on the first Biggest Loser,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,785,"['liked', 'first', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'one', 'few', 'improvements', 'First', 'customizable', 'option', 'truly', 'customizable', 'want', 'do', 'first', '20', 'minute', 'workout', 'lower', 'intensity', '3', 'times', 'row', 'can', 'are', 'able', 'truly', 'choose', 'workout', 'level', 'time.The', 'first', '20', 'minute', 'aerobic', 'section', 'strenth', 'training', 'light', 'weights', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'doing', 'Push-ups', 'middle', 'aerobics', 'think', 'lowering', 'ground', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'detrimental', 'easily', 'fixed', 'just', 'doing', 'other', 'moves', 'TV', 'group', 'ground.The', 'second', 'third', 'sections', 'are', 'higher', 'impact', 'intensity', '10', 'minute', 'sessions', 'can', 'do', 'once', 'twice', 'three', 'times', 'want.I', 'will', 'keep', 'library']",Biggest Loser Cardio Max

1109016,A24N14NCQX5CU5,B000WEVGHA,W. Solberg,"[0, 0]","Tae Bo, step aerobics, P90X, Zumba, Yoga, and many more.  I've done them all.  I'm 34 years old and have been working out on a regular basis (usually 5 days per week) since I was 15 or so.  I workout at home and get bored doing the same workouts again and again.  I recently got The Biggest Loser Bootcamp (starring Bob) and love it.  It's a great, challenging workout.  After liking that one so much I decided I needed another Biggest Loser workout and purchsed Cardio Max.  Again, love it!  I really like how the workout is broken down (5 minute warm-up, 20 minutes with Bob, 10 with Jillian, finish up with 10 minutes of kick-boxing).  I read a review that talked about how the last 10 minutes are nothing compared to Bob & Jillians workouts.  I agree.  HOWEVER, I like that the last 10 minutes aren't quite so intense.  Knowing I have a little bit of an easier workout coming up, I'm more inclined to do the entire workout.  I highly recommend this workout.  I'm sore after doing it once.",5,I'VE DONE JUST ABOUT EVERY WORKOUT OUT THERE~ THIS IS A KEEPER!,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,992,"['Tae', 'Bo', 'step', 'aerobics', 'P90X', 'Zumba', 'Yoga', 'many', 'more', ""'ve"", 'done', ""'m"", '34', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'regular', 'basis', 'usually', '5', 'days', 'week', 'was', '15', 'so', 'workout', 'home', 'get', 'bored', 'doing', 'same', 'workouts', 'again', 'again', 'recently', 'got', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'Bootcamp', 'starring', 'Bob', 'love', 'great', 'challenging', 'workout', 'liking', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'needed', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'workout', 'purchsed', 'Cardio', 'Max', 'Again', 'love', 'really', 'how', 'workout', 'broken', 'down', '5', 'minute', 'warm-up', '20', 'minutes', 'Bob', '10', 'Jillian', 'finish', 'up', '10', 'minutes', 'kick-boxing', 'read', 'review', 'talked', 'how', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Bob', 'Jillians', 'workouts', 'agree', 'HOWEVER', 'like', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'intense', 'Knowing', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'easier', 'workout', 'coming', 'up', ""'m"", 'more', 'inclined', 'do', 'entire', 'workout', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', ""'m"", 'sore', 'doing', 'once']",Biggest Loser Cardio Max
