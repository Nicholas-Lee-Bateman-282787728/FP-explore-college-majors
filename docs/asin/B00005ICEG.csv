582379,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00005ICEG,Amanda Richards,"[12, 14]","Kipper and his friends Tiger, Pig and Arnold are the main characters in this series of stories.  They have British accents, which is fun, especially when your kids imitate them, and they make playtime into an adventure in every episode.  Some of the words are  slang that kids may not understand at first, but from the excellent illustrations you can understand what they are saying.This DVD has seven episodes, with story lines so simple that toddlers can understand the &quot;plot&quot;.  Some of the stories have useful messages, like when Tiger refuses to go into the pool, because he can't swim and doesn't have his swim floats with him.The backgrounds are for the most part very basic, for example with just a green line on a white background, but somehow you know they are on the grass.  Some are quite complex, and you can see individual blades of grass in a field.  The one story that has a problem is the one when Kipper is blowing bubbles, because you can't see them clearly on the white background, but you can hear them popping. (Thanks to my JBL surround speakers)I was giving it four stars, because my son has just demanded to see it again for the fourth consecutive time today, and I've had enough, but you can't downgrade something that a child enjoys so much, so it's back to five stars.I suppose I'll have to buy the rest of the series now.",5,Simply Entertaining,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,1359,"['Kipper', 'friends', 'Tiger', 'Pig', 'Arnold', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'stories', 'have', 'British', 'accents', 'fun', 'especially', 'when', 'kids', 'imitate', 'make', 'playtime', 'adventure', 'episode', 'words', 'are', 'slang', 'kids', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'first', 'excellent', 'illustrations', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'saying.This', 'DVD', 'seven', 'episodes', 'story', 'lines', 'so', 'simple', 'toddlers', 'can', 'understand', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'stories', 'have', 'useful', 'messages', 'when', 'Tiger', 'go', 'pool', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swim', ""n't"", 'have', 'swim', 'floats', 'him.The', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'basic', 'example', 'just', 'green', 'line', 'white', 'background', 'somehow', 'know', 'are', 'grass', 'are', 'quite', 'complex', 'can', 'see', 'individual', 'blades', 'grass', 'field', 'one', 'story', 'problem', 'one', 'when', 'Kipper', 'blowing', 'bubbles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'clearly', 'white', 'background', 'can', 'hear', 'popping', 'Thanks', 'JBL', 'surround', 'speakers', 'was', 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'son', 'just', 'demanded', 'see', 'again', 'fourth', 'consecutive', 'time', 'today', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'downgrade', 'something', 'child', 'so', 'much', 'back', 'five', 'stars.I', 'suppose', ""'ll"", 'have', 'buy', 'rest', 'series', 'now']","Kipper - Pools, Parks & Picnics VHS"

Kipper is a really cute dog and the 7 stories are fun and grab your attention.

I like the animals in it. Kipper and Tiger are dogs and they have pig and other animal friends. I'd say these are the best cartoons out there with stories that are positive and helpful to children.

I am actually rebuying this particular Kipper on DVD to replace our worn out VHS version.  That is how much use we've gotten out of this.  I discovered Kipper when my daugher was 15 months old.  She truly liked it, but I loved it.  I loved the simplicity, sweetness, and touches of British humor.  Well, she may have just liked it then, but now, at age 3 1/2, she absolutely LOVES Kipper.  This and Caullio are her two favorite shows (Maggie and the Ferocious Beast is a great one too that she loves).  They have plots she can follow and keep up with and recognize the humor.  It's a nice paced show-- sweet but not boring-slow at all, and not obnoxious and fast like some cartoons out there.  Sure, my daughter now is allowed to watch a few cartoon movies that have the songs and some action, and she'll ask to watch them everyday for 3 days, but then they are forgotten and it's Kipper she begs to watch over and over and over.  And I never mind.  It's such a great show-- you won't regret buying it for your little ones (and buy the DVD that will last you longer so you're not rebuying like I have to!).Enjoy!",5,Why can't there be other kids' shows so great?,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,1224,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'Kipper', 'series', 'little', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'offer', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'am', 'actually', 'rebuying', 'particular', 'Kipper', 'DVD', 'replace', 'worn', 'VHS', 'version', 'how', 'much', 'use', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'discovered', 'Kipper', 'when', 'daugher', 'was', '15', 'months', 'old', 'truly', 'liked', 'loved', 'loved', 'simplicity', 'sweetness', 'touches', 'British', 'humor', 'Well', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'liked', 'then', 'now', 'age', '3', '1/2', 'absolutely', 'LOVES', 'Kipper', 'Caullio', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'shows', 'Maggie', 'Ferocious', 'Beast', 'great', 'one', 'too', 'have', 'plots', 'can', 'follow', 'keep', 'up', 'recognize', 'humor', 'nice', 'paced', 'show', 'sweet', 'not', 'boring-slow', 'not', 'obnoxious', 'fast', 'cartoons', 'out', 'there', 'Sure', 'daughter', 'now', 'allowed', 'watch', 'few', 'cartoon', 'movies', 'have', 'songs', 'action', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'watch', 'everyday', '3', 'days', 'then', 'are', 'forgotten', 'Kipper', 'begs', 'watch', 'never', 'mind', 'such', 'great', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', 'little', 'ones', 'buy', 'DVD', 'will', 'last', 'longer', 'so', ""'re"", 'not', 'rebuying', 'have', '.Enjoy']","Kipper - Pools, Parks & Picnics VHS"
