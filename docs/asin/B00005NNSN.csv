669458,A1GXY3ZCXJWUVQ,B00005NNSN,A. J. Mathison,"[7, 9]","First off, I'm a huge fan of Foghat.....especially their first few albums. I was kind of expecting concert footage of them from a couple of decades ago, but instead it's the older versions of Foghat playing an outdoor venue today. The sound is pretty good, but I think better song selection would have been better, and the video camera angles was pretty lame. I enjoyed the conversations they had with the guys (in the extras footage), and Lonesome Dave has been a hero of mine since back in the late 1960's Savoy Brown era. This was OK, but not great. All we ever got to see in the concert footage of the drummer was the back of him........little or no footage of him banging away on the skins. Stage lighting was mediocre too. You know they're loving their music and it's great to see the 4 of them together, but in my mind I had envisioned seeing the Foghat of 30 years ago, and instead it was a stage of old men (just like me).......still playing great, but moving allot slower on stage. Maybe the next Foghat video that will soon be available will improve on some of this stuff.",3,Not Quite What I Expected,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,1083,"['First', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Foghat', '..especially', 'first', 'few', 'albums', 'was', 'kind', 'expecting', 'concert', 'footage', 'couple', 'decades', 'ago', 'instead', 'older', 'versions', 'Foghat', 'playing', 'outdoor', 'venue', 'today', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'better', 'song', 'selection', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'video', 'camera', 'angles', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'enjoyed', 'conversations', 'had', 'guys', 'extras', 'footage', 'Lonesome', 'Dave', 'been', 'hero', 'mine', 'back', 'late', '1960', 'Savoy', 'Brown', 'era', 'was', 'OK', 'not', 'great', 'ever', 'got', 'see', 'concert', 'footage', 'drummer', 'was', 'back', '..little', 'footage', 'banging', 'away', 'skins', 'Stage', 'lighting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'too', 'know', ""'re"", 'loving', 'music', 'great', 'see', '4', 'together', 'mind', 'had', 'envisioned', 'seeing', 'Foghat', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'instead', 'was', 'stage', 'old', 'men', 'just', '.still', 'playing', 'great', 'moving', 'allot', 'slower', 'stage', 'Maybe', 'next', 'Foghat', 'video', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'available', 'will', 'improve', 'stuff']",N/A

Yes I know the history and know all about Savoy Brown etc. I had Energized, Rock and ROll Outlaws, Night Shift, Fool for The City, Live, Boogie Motel and loved all the radio hits. BUT, this cd was just so so. It was dark, too dark, the 1 or 2 cameras were far away, and whats up with that huge fat guitarist? Jeeez, I have a problem with that too. I need to have a great light show for a live concert. I really didnt hear any ""Jams,"" it was just the songs but with a live crowd. Why didnt they work the crowd? It seemed like they were tired and just wanted to finish the set. I was extremely upset because I know it could have been better.

Lonesome Dave with all his problems cranked out the vocals in this playset which includes some of their best songs (wish the selection was longer)He still had the energy to Rock along with his Mates and really finalized what this Band was all about.

669466,A1TP2RW7KDI5AZ,B00005NNSN,"John Werner ""JWW""","[2, 2]","First this video concert document is the antithesis of Hell Freezes Over and, perhaps, that is part of the reason I think it is so great.  The production, while having clear photography, is certainly not too polished, but the music is the point and it is on fire and the sound is very crisp and well balanced-therefore helping to translate a typical great Foghat performance in this welcome concert dvd.Blues based rock is arguably the most timeless genre of rock.  Sure, there are different flavors as in the free-form style of The Allman Brothers, the soulful interpretations of Robert Cray,  the Texas roadhouse styles of ZZ Top and Stevie Ray Vaughn, Hendrix (defies explaination), and the list goes on...But one style that possesses the most energy is the boogie based rocked-up blues exemplified by Foghat.  That energy is evident in large supply on Two Centuries Of Boogie.  The guys may be showing age and life's travails in appearance, but they rock like giddy teenagers eager to share the cool music they've found.  Yes, they not only acquit themself without any embarassment, I think it is safe to say this performance could easily blow a band half their age into an early retirement.  I feel so fortunate we have this film of an all too breif time where the original members regrouped and literally smoked the competition.  Listen to Lonesome Daves voice, he's charged and his range and power seem more like a twenty year old.  Spine tingling to be sure, and after what I have read he was recouperating from cancer treatment, even more amazing.  Rod Price's searing slide work is literally possessed-maybe being elevated even by his own need to release.  Tony Stevens bass playing is quite like The Who's John Entwistle embellishing things with higher harmonics and nailing it all down with solid runs.  Finally, Roger Earl's drums are propelling it all with amazing control, his snare truly ""cuts like a knife"", and for once someone got it miked right-a more live drum sound would be hard to imagine.  These guys have the stuff and they, especially on this night, delivered the goods!

True, the man obviously put on a lot of weight in his later years, but come on, you should know who he is!  And Rod, along with Lonesome Dave, is no longer with us, God rest their rock and roll souls.I agree the overall production could have been better, especially the use of the cameras.  Roger Earl never really got showcased at all, just about all shots of him were from the back.  It seemed to me the audio was too low on Drivin' Wheel, the second song.  That should have been cranked up loud and heavy, but it's really low-key.  And, the audience appreciated the band, but they were hardly enthusiastic as a whole.  Then again, when so many of the fans looked to be around 50, it's hard to boogie like you did when you were 20.As far as the song selection goes, I only wish there were more songs included, such as Honey Hush, Road Fever, and Take Me To The River.

My biggest regret is I never saw them again despite numerous oppertunities to see them in local clubs the the last several years. This video shows they could still rock with the best of them late in carrer. I only give this video 4 stars as because as one reviewer pointed out the crowd didn't respond to the great rock and roll it was getting from the band. It's  really too bad if something earlier in their carreer doesn't exist. If they can put a band like the Sex Pistols, who were nothing but a flash in the pan, and wasn't what I would call rock and roll in the Hall Of Fame, then this band deserves the honor of being enrolled also. One has only to veiw this video to get a great sampling of what this group was all about. Only recently has one of my favorite Foghat albums finally been releashed in CD. That would be Boogie Motel. It would be fitting for Lonesome Dave to know that finally he and his band were recognized for the great music they produced and played for many years to be inducted in the Hall of Fame.

R.,"[4, 8]","Now with the passing of Rod Price, and earlier with the death of Lonesome Dave, this DVD concert is the legacy of a really good hard rock/blues band that unfortunatly gets remembered mostly as a silly 1970's Spinal Tap script. You really get nothing new here, but what you get is one of the most honest blues band to ever crank an amp up to 11. Foghat always covered the best bluesmen from bygone days, they always mined the best blues songs, and wrote many a good ones themselves, the difference between Foghat and Led Zep was that Foghat actually gave credit to whoever's song they were recording which is why the old bluesmen who's songs they covered actually LIKED that band and had respect for their trade unlike Zeppelin who never gave credit to those whose songs they nicked. This being said, Foghat is NO Zeppelin, Foghat is 100% blues, nothing else. Now, on to the disc, Lonesome Dave and the boys all look more road weary and heavier in the saddle, but don't let their grizzled looks get in the way that they boogie. Rod Price had continued to improved on his slide work (If possible!)and the rest of the band play tighter than ever. Lonesome Dave's voice had lost a bit of power, but it doesn't hurt the performance. Foghat is pure blues, nowdays that restricts artists who ply this trade honestly to the cutout bins (remember those?) at record stores (Unless you're Clapton) which in a way its sad, because of their past mega-success, but that's a way of life for a bluesman.

This dvd features the original line-up with &quot;Lonesome Dave&quot; Peverett at the helm.All I have to say is Lonesome Dave  was (and is in the hearts of 70's rockers everywhere) one of the great unsung blues rockers.  While bands like the Rolling Stones prance on stage and barely break a sweat, cashing in big-time on past glory, Foghat is sweating it out giving it 125%.  Peverett sings his heart out (its fitting with Dave's little dig on the Stones near the end of the disc).  The band really shifts into high gear when Rod Price puts down the slide guitar in favor of his Stratocaster and the band breaks into &quot;I Just Wanna Make Love To You&quot;.  The twin guitar intro is still one of the best air guitar work-outs ever.It is really difficult to watch this, however, realizing that Peverett is passed on to a better place.  But if you reflect on all the great songs he wrote, all the great albums he played on (Savoy Brown included),  his legacy is secure in my opinion.  My only negatives regarding the disc (and this is nit-picking, but knocked the dvd down to 4 stars) is too much slide guitar from Rod Price and the running time is a little short. Rod Price is a killer lead player, but only puts down the eventually grating slide guitar on a few tracks (same beef with &quot;Return Of The Boogie Men&quot;).  But if you ever were or still are a Foghat fan.....if you want to reflect on your &quot;dazed &amp; confused&quot; teen years, you owe yourself this dvd no questions asked.",4,Lonesome Dave Was Foghat &amp; Savoy Brown!,1060473600,"08 10, 2003",2003,1623,"['do', ""n't"", 'look', 'same', 'cover', 'debut', 'album', 'quot', 'Foghat', 'quot', 'guys', 'still', 'kick', 'out', 'jams', 'dvd', 'original', 'line-up', 'quot', 'Lonesome', 'Dave', 'quot', 'Peverett', 'helm.All', 'have', 'say', 'Lonesome', 'Dave', 'was', 'hearts', '70', 'rockers', 'everywhere', 'one', 'great', 'unsung', 'blues', 'rockers', 'bands', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'prance', 'stage', 'barely', 'break', 'sweat', 'cashing', 'big-time', 'past', 'glory', 'Foghat', 'sweating', 'out', 'giving', '125', '%', 'Peverett', 'heart', 'out', 'fitting', 'Dave', 'little', 'dig', 'Stones', 'end', 'disc', 'band', 'really', 'high', 'gear', 'when', 'Rod', 'Price', 'down', 'slide', 'guitar', 'favor', 'Stratocaster', 'band', 'quot', 'Just', 'Wan', 'na', 'Make', 'Love', 'quot', 'twin', 'guitar', 'intro', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'air', 'guitar', 'work-outs', 'ever.It', 'really', 'difficult', 'watch', 'however', 'realizing', 'Peverett', 'passed', 'better', 'place', 'reflect', 'great', 'songs', 'wrote', 'great', 'albums', 'played', 'Savoy', 'Brown', 'included', 'legacy', 'secure', 'opinion', 'only', 'negatives', 'regarding', 'disc', 'nit-picking', 'knocked', 'dvd', 'down', '4', 'stars', 'too', 'much', 'slide', 'guitar', 'Rod', 'Price', 'running', 'time', 'little', 'short', 'Rod', 'Price', 'killer', 'lead', 'player', 'only', 'down', 'eventually', 'grating', 'slide', 'guitar', 'few', 'tracks', 'same', 'beef', 'quot', 'Return', 'Boogie', 'Men', 'quot', 'ever', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'Foghat', 'fan', '..if', 'want', 'reflect', 'quot', 'dazed', 'amp', 'confused', 'quot', 'teen', 'years', 'owe', 'questions', 'asked']",N/A

It was fantastic seeing all four of the original members ""getting down"" in their 50's.

Rod, along with Lonesome Dave, is no longer with us, RIP.This was one of Dave's final shows before he died of cancer but he sings heartily and is quite upbeat although the audience is strangely unengaged. Younger rockers should take note of the work ethic of this band.The overall production could have been better, especially the use of the cameras. The sound was great but seemed to vary a bit at times. But it was not all that noticeable and the strength of the performance carried the day. The song selection was as follows:Louisiana BluesDrivin' WheelNothin' But TroubleStone BlueRock Your HouseIt Hurts Me TooSweet Home ChicagoI Just Want To Make Love To YouFool For The CitySlow RideThen there is a special tribute to Lonesome Dave as the song Angel Of Mercy plays and it is followed by an acoustic version of Leavin' Again as the credits roll.The DVD is rather short but it's how one uses the time.
