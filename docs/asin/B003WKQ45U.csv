Itinerant Methodist ministers traveling in the wild west of the Appalachians made Methodism the fastest growing denomination in the US until the battle over slavery broke it into northern and southern denominations. The rights of Catholics and Jews to have their children free from Protestant religious training in public schools led to a greater separation of church and state.In postwar America, Billy Graham and his crusade against ""Godless"" communism made him the best known religious figure in America.

Its focus seemed more on victimization rather than giving a solid overview of how Americans have interpreted God. It begins with a very lopsided and unrealistic look at the Anne Hutchinson controversy, and says nothing of the development of Christian understanding in the early United States. It does not discuss the origins of many of the American religions, such as Latter Day Saints, Shakers, Christian Scientists, etc.  It summarized fundamentalism by focusing a section on the Scopes monkey trial, gives a short discourse on MLK, and then launches into the political involvement of the religious right.  The characterizations of historic figures is sketchy in some places, inaccurate in others, and is just plain historical blasphemy in others.  For example, anyone who has read John Winthrop or read of him will not recognize this program's re-imagining of his character.It's one shining point was re-reuniting the development of the United States with religious conscience, which many historical productions squeeze out.I was hoping this show would be a good overview of the development of differing religious beliefs in America, but it was nothing of the sort.
