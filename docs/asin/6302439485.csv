A young woman talks about her boyfriend. Lyn is a singer there. Her boyfriend tosses a letter out the window. [""A Cleaner New York is up to you.""] Nell visits the hotel, she will watch a young girl. [Remember the Automat?] ""I never eat candy."" Elevators were operated by people. Dogs roamed unleashed in this hotel. Jack talks to Lyn. Who talks to bartenders? Nell looks over the room, and tries on jewelry. Jack and Lyn talk about their relationship. Lyn doesn't like Jack's lack of heart. Eddie's life has its ups and downs. Jack sees Nell across the court, he calls her room number. We learn about Nell's former boyfriend. We see the scars on Nell's wrists. Nell lures Jack over for a visit; he brings a bottle.Nell's conversation tells about her character (or mental state). [The story slows down.] Jack is an airplane pilot. Nell remembers Billy. Bunny surprises them. Nell tells about her past. [The talk goes on to fill up the time.] Bunny looks out the window. Nell doesn't want Jack to leave. Nell seems disturbed and restless. Will she have another breakdown? ""Its all a mistake."" Bunny is quiet now. The old couple visit. Nell blames the man who left. The old couple call the house detective. Nell's talk seems ominous. Bunny's Mom returns in time. ""Do you need some help, lady?"" ""Don't do that!"" Jack talks to Nell to explain about things. The police arrive to help Nell out. ""She didn't want to hurt anybody."" There is a happy ending for Jack and Lyn. The loose ends of this story remain untied.This is a different kind of role for Widmark, and strange story for a glamor girl at the beginning of her career. Marilyn looks different, did she have cosmetic surgery later or just fill out her face? Would people leave their daughter in the care of a stranger? Did people leave their doors unlocked like that? This psychological drama really doesn't have much entertainment value, and its not a horror story. It does educate the viewer about one form of mental illness.",2,Don't Bother to Watch,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,2089,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', '1952', 'filmThe', 'film', 'big', 'city', 'night', 'Are', 'scenes', 'are', 'hotel', 'young', 'woman', 'talks', 'boyfriend', 'Lyn', 'singer', 'there', 'boyfriend', 'letter', 'out', 'window', '[', 'A', 'Cleaner', 'New', 'York', 'up', ']', 'Nell', 'hotel', 'will', 'watch', 'young', 'girl', '[', 'Remember', 'Automat', 'never', 'eat', 'candy', 'Elevators', 'were', 'operated', 'people', 'Dogs', 'roamed', 'unleashed', 'hotel', 'Jack', 'talks', 'Lyn', 'Who', 'bartenders', 'Nell', 'room', 'tries', 'jewelry', 'Jack', 'Lyn', 'talk', 'relationship', 'Lyn', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jack', 'lack', 'heart', 'Eddie', 'life', 'ups', 'downs', 'Jack', 'Nell', 'court', 'room', 'number', 'learn', 'Nell', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'see', 'scars', 'Nell', 'wrists', 'Nell', 'Jack', 'visit', 'bottle.Nell', 'conversation', 'character', 'mental', 'state', '[', 'story', 'down', ']', 'Jack', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'Nell', 'remembers', 'Billy', 'Bunny', 'Nell', 'past', '[', 'talk', 'fill', 'up', 'time', ']', 'Bunny', 'out', 'window', 'Nell', ""n't"", 'want', 'Jack', 'leave', 'Nell', 'disturbed', 'restless', 'Will', 'have', 'breakdown', 'mistake', 'Bunny', 'quiet', 'now', 'old', 'couple', 'visit', 'Nell', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'old', 'couple', 'call', 'house', 'detective', 'Nell', 'talk', 'ominous', 'Bunny', 'Mom', 'returns', 'time', 'Do', 'need', 'help', 'lady', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Jack', 'talks', 'Nell', 'explain', 'things', 'police', 'arrive', 'help', 'Nell', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'anybody', 'happy', 'ending', 'Jack', 'Lyn', 'loose', 'ends', 'story', 'remain', 'untied.This', 'different', 'kind', 'role', 'Widmark', 'strange', 'story', 'glamor', 'girl', 'beginning', 'career', 'Marilyn', 'different', 'did', 'have', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'later', 'just', 'fill', 'out', 'face', 'Would', 'people', 'leave', 'daughter', 'care', 'stranger', 'Did', 'people', 'leave', 'doors', 'unlocked', 'psychological', 'drama', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'horror', 'story', 'educate', 'viewer', 'one', 'form', 'mental', 'illness']",Don't Bother to Knock VHS

Monroe is quite good in this noir-like thriller, you believe that her character is full of baggage and maybe even a little psychotic. Widmark is wonderful as always, he and Monroe have this natural, intense chemistry. The ending is a bit soap opera but for the most part - I found this classic film very intriguing.

312619,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302439485,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","You know how your mother, when you were ready to go out on your own, set up your own household and family, always harped at you to make sure to get references when you hired anybody for a service. Well maybe that advice was not so far-fetched. Maybe better references would have stopped things from going awry in the film under review, a minor Marilyn Monroe black and white film, Don't Bother to Knock.  In any case one should not rely on the recommendations of a sniveling hotel elevator operator trying to get a wayward niece gainful employee. And the minute that I saw that the referring party here, the elevator guy, was Elisha Cook, Jr., last seen as a no -account cheap gunsel in the 1941 film adaption of Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon I knew mother was onto something.Here's the skinny. A couple staying in a New York hotel, not the Plaza from the look of it, needed a baby-sitter for the night in order  for hubby to receive some newspaper award. Presto. Elisha volunteers his niece, Nell (played by a young not blonde, Marilyn Monroe), and the deal is done. No problem right. Wrong, wrong about six different ways. I will not get into the issue of baby-sitters getting a bad rap in film, either as social monsters or as incompetents, but this Nell as it turned out had just come east from a three year stay at a mental institution. Reason; terrible parents and devastation over the loss of her World War II flyboy lover killed in a crash out in the deep.As the film progresses Nell acts more and more erratically especially when cross-court neighbor Jed, a commercial pilot, comes a courting after a certain amount of telephone and window flirtation. Acts more erratically toward the helpless if precocious child, Bunny, in her care. Jed is strictly on the rebound since his honey, a torch-singer (played by Anne Bancroft) playing downstairs at the lounge, has called the whole thing off, saw him as just another love `em and leave `em guy and she wanted something more. So Jed is gloomy although once he copped to Nell's condition, or at least that he wanted no part of someone who was that disturbed he decided to flee back to his torch-singer, and that something more she was talking about. But not before Nell tried to vicariously seduce Jed thinking he was her dead flyboy, bopped the nervous Elisha on the head when he checked up on her, tied up the poor child, had a fight with the child's mother when she checked up, and then tried to do herself in with razorblades before she is checked and taken away (that was not her first time with the blades she had it out West and got that three year stay for her efforts). So you can what I mean about that reference thing.Oh yah, Marilyn's performance seemed strictly out of that method acting school she belonged to, a little wooden, coming out of the blocks. A little wooden like the storyline and action of this film. If you want Monroe at her height then you had better see Some Like It Hot or The Misfits this one is strictly a rising star learning her craft.",3,The Hired Help,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,3033,"['know', 'how', 'mother', 'when', 'were', 'ready', 'go', 'out', 'own', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'household', 'family', 'always', 'harped', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'references', 'when', 'hired', 'anybody', 'service', 'Well', 'maybe', 'advice', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'far-fetched', 'Maybe', 'better', 'references', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'things', 'going', 'awry', 'film', 'review', 'minor', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', 'case', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'rely', 'recommendations', 'sniveling', 'hotel', 'elevator', 'operator', 'trying', 'get', 'wayward', 'niece', 'gainful', 'employee', 'minute', 'saw', 'referring', 'party', 'here', 'elevator', 'guy', 'was', 'Elisha', 'Cook', 'Jr.', 'last', 'seen', '-account', 'cheap', 'gunsel', '1941', 'film', 'adaption', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'knew', 'mother', 'was', 'skinny', 'couple', 'staying', 'New', 'York', 'hotel', 'not', 'Plaza', 'look', 'needed', 'baby-sitter', 'night', 'order', 'hubby', 'receive', 'newspaper', 'award', 'Presto', 'Elisha', 'niece', 'Nell', 'played', 'young', 'not', 'blonde', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'deal', 'done', 'problem', 'right', 'Wrong', 'wrong', 'six', 'different', 'ways', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'issue', 'baby-sitters', 'getting', 'bad', 'rap', 'film', 'social', 'monsters', 'incompetents', 'Nell', 'turned', 'out', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'east', 'three', 'year', 'stay', 'mental', 'institution', 'Reason', 'terrible', 'parents', 'devastation', 'loss', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'flyboy', 'lover', 'killed', 'crash', 'out', 'deep.As', 'film', 'Nell', 'more', 'more', 'erratically', 'especially', 'when', 'cross-court', 'neighbor', 'Jed', 'commercial', 'pilot', 'courting', 'certain', 'amount', 'telephone', 'window', 'flirtation', 'more', 'erratically', 'helpless', 'precocious', 'child', 'Bunny', 'care', 'Jed', 'strictly', 'rebound', 'honey', 'torch-singer', 'played', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'playing', 'downstairs', 'lounge', 'called', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'saw', 'as', 'just', 'love', 'em', 'leave', 'em', 'guy', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'So', 'Jed', 'gloomy', 'once', 'copped', 'Nell', 'condition', 'least', 'wanted', 'part', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'disturbed', 'decided', 'flee', 'back', 'torch-singer', 'something', 'more', 'was', 'talking', 'not', 'before', 'Nell', 'tried', 'vicariously', 'seduce', 'Jed', 'thinking', 'was', 'dead', 'flyboy', 'bopped', 'nervous', 'Elisha', 'head', 'when', 'checked', 'up', 'tied', 'up', 'poor', 'child', 'had', 'fight', 'child', 'mother', 'when', 'checked', 'up', 'then', 'tried', 'do', 'razorblades', 'checked', 'taken', 'away', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'blades', 'had', 'out', 'West', 'got', 'three', 'year', 'stay', 'efforts', 'can', 'what', 'mean', 'reference', 'thing.Oh', 'yah', 'Marilyn', 'performance', 'seemed', 'strictly', 'method', 'acting', 'school', 'belonged', 'little', 'wooden', 'coming', 'blocks', 'little', 'wooden', 'storyline', 'action', 'film', 'want', 'Monroe', 'height', 'then', 'had', 'better', 'see', 'Hot', 'Misfits', 'one', 'strictly', 'rising', 'star', 'learning', 'craft']",Don't Bother to Knock VHS
312620,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6302439485,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[4, 7]","Marilyn Monroe is the indelible diva.  A number of years ago a critic mentioned that ""Liz Taylor is a living legend but Marilyn Monroe is a myth,"" and incurred Liz's anger.  Perhaps she missed the point--nobody wants to die for their reputation.  So Marilyn remains the very embodiment of youthful innocence and carnal temptation, and while many imitated her in the Fifties and many have tried more recently, I don't look for any to match her unique and legendary ""mythical"" status.To be honest, there is only one gem in this collection, MONKEY BUSINESS (1952) and two pretty good studio offerings, LET'S MAKE LOVE from 1960 and NIAGARA from 1952, the first starring role Fox gave Marilyn.MONKEY BUSINESS, which I have reviewed as a single title, is living proof that screwball comedy didn't die after World War II.  Here Howard Hawks is back with Cary Grant a ""mere"" fourteen years after the stellar BRINGING UP BABY (1938).  Cary plays a very middle-aged absent-minded professor who is really a bit of a stick--until he's accidentally dosed with a new Ponce de Leon rejuvenation serum and all youth breaks out.  Pretty soon he's got his hair in a buzz cut and driving a new roadster so recklessly he scares even the pretty (and pretty daring) secretary played by Marilyn Monroe.  Classic line:  after boss (played by Charles Coburn) sends Marilyn off in search of someone to type a letter, he glances at her ""caboose"" and remarks, ""Anyone can type.""Now, this excellent film has plenty of performances alongside Marilyn's:  manic Cary, flabbergasted wife Ginger Rogers, the everlovin' monotonous Hugh Marlowe (he of a jillion WWII air-ace movies and the playwright in ALL ABOUT EVE) and as a special treat, George (""Foghorn"") Winslow, the seven-year-old martinet who blatts out ""What'sa matter?  Don'cha like children?"" in a pivotal scene.But this is not Marilyn's movie.  It is a vehicle for Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers and Marilyn's presence just adds to the overall zaniness and charm.Marilyn's first ""real"" starring role was in a routine melodrama starring her and Joseph Cotten, NIAGARA, following MONKEY BUSINESS but preceding GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES.  Marilyn's indelible sexuality and spirit shine through, but does not totally redeem, this standard studio potboiler.  LET'S MAKE LOVE (1960), despite an arrogantly expert cast that includes the likes of Yves Montand, Milton Berle and Gene Kelly, is a perfunctory affair in which Marilyn plays a Methodist minister's daughter (!) given court by would-be lover Yves Montand.  Not terribly useful as a musical or as a comedy, and it must have been quite a letdown coming so soon after the legendary SOME LIKE IT HOT (which, being a United Artists release, unfortunately is not included in either of the Fox-oriented Diamonds).Have you noticed that the movies I like best--as does the AFI and most of my fellow citizens--are not in this collection?  Buy Volume I of the Diamond Edition first and thrill to the likes of HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and other first-rate stuff.  This Volume II, a/k/a ""That's Leftovers,"" does serve to document most of the rest of Monroe's work.  Aside from the ""tag"" version of the unfinished and unreleased SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE (1962), which can be found in Vol. I, look for Marilyn in brief roles in two other films not included here:  a mere walk-on in 1948's LOVE HAPPY, starring the Marx Brothers; and several minutes of dazzle as ""Miss Caswell, a graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramtic Art"" in Fox's 1950 ALL ABOUT EVE, a film so excellent its record number of Oscars (TM) was not bested until TITANIC.

""Don't Bother To Knock"" is an amazing hauntingly brilliant performance early in Marilyn's career showing chilling dramatic range while ""Monkey Business"" is a fun romp showing off Monroe's great comic ability.  ""Niagara"" is a real DIVA Superstar turn unlike any other with Marilyn drop-dead gorgeous in this colorful spectactular, being the film that made Marilyn Monroe a true film Superstar and introduced that famous Monroe walk with Marilyn unforgettable in that sumptuous red dress. Musical moments with Marilyn were always memorable and in ""Niagara"" so mesmerizing and hypnotic singing ""Kiss"" and never more seductive or beautiful in this gorgeous moment. ""River Of No Return"" is a fine movie that has aged well having a timeless quality to it with a moving and richly etched performance from Marilyn holding up well today with inspired Robert Mitchum pairing another plus...again musical numbers show Marilyn had her own original style, making magic with these great numbers and every moment fascinating to watch. ""Let's Make Love"" was way ahead of its time and the concept of intergrating musical numbers in to story line used to great success some ten years later in ""Cabaret"". Listening to ""Let's Make Love"" Original Soundtrack latest mix on Compact Disc, it is clear Marilyn delivers some of the finest musical performances of her brilliant career (Cole Porter's ""My Hear Belongs To Daddy"" is a real showstopper!) making this a must have for fans of great musical films and this winning release also features wonderful unreleased performances not in the film. As a young teen who sneaked into the theatre to see what was considered at that time to be a racy film, lost track how many times seeing this classic, finding it totally engrossing and richly entertaining every time. Final never completed ""Something's Got To Give"" show a sophisicated and very beautiful Marilyn who never looked more stunning on the big screen and this motion picture would have been a real classic, taking her career to a new level with Marilyn coming into her own as a unique performer and living screen legend who was the brightest & greatest star of her generation.

312628,A3CY8IP938TNZA,6302439485,Curt Tow,"[0, 0]","Because of her mesmerizing charisma, Marilyn Monroe was not required to act. By merely standing in front of the camera, she always commanded the audience's attention. But fortunately, for every viewer of this particular film, it is apparent that her highly effective dramatic acting created a far more compelling visual and auditory experience than her mere presence would warrant.Without any noticeable effort, she creates a character who weaves in and out of reality. Initially a grounded, appealing, and ingratiating person, her character, a babysitter at a hotel, incrementally introduces brief episodes of psychosis - bouts which become more prolonged and frequent. Star Monroe easily and believably segues from sanity to derangement and back again - so smoothly and with much nuance.This film increasingly becomes more suspenseful just as Monroe's character increasingly cannot distinguish reality from her tragic past. And as her descent progresses, the other characters - Richard Widmark's hotel room visitor, her uncle, and her babysitting charge - become witnesses and victims.The subplot involving Widmark and Anne Bancroft is significant, as these two characters become strongly affected by the babysitter's descent into madness - and the course of their relationship shall change. And the creation of Monroe's babysitter is not merely the portrayal of psychotic behavior, but one that serves other purposes. She is an instrument providing redemption for another character, and she also exemplifies a film noir theme: the sudden occurrence of havoc and misfortune at anytime and place.On one level, this film is an engrossing display of fine acting and wrenching drama. But it is also an admonition - in the most clement and secure environments, unpleasantness and the unexpected lurk.",5,Among Monroe's Finest Performances,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,1797,"['mesmerizing', 'charisma', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'not', 'required', 'act', 'merely', 'standing', 'front', 'camera', 'always', 'commanded', 'audience', 'attention', 'fortunately', 'viewer', 'particular', 'film', 'apparent', 'highly', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'created', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'visual', 'auditory', 'experience', 'mere', 'presence', 'would', 'warrant.Without', 'noticeable', 'effort', 'character', 'who', 'reality', 'Initially', 'grounded', 'appealing', 'ingratiating', 'person', 'character', 'babysitter', 'hotel', 'incrementally', 'brief', 'episodes', 'psychosis', 'bouts', 'become', 'more', 'prolonged', 'frequent', 'Star', 'Monroe', 'easily', 'believably', 'segues', 'sanity', 'derangement', 'back', 'again', 'so', 'smoothly', 'much', 'nuance.This', 'film', 'increasingly', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'just', 'Monroe', 'character', 'increasingly', 'can', 'not', 'distinguish', 'reality', 'tragic', 'past', 'descent', 'other', 'characters', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'hotel', 'room', 'visitor', 'uncle', 'babysitting', 'charge', 'become', 'witnesses', 'victims.The', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Widmark', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'significant', 'two', 'characters', 'become', 'strongly', 'affected', 'babysitter', 'descent', 'madness', 'course', 'relationship', 'shall', 'change', 'creation', 'Monroe', 'babysitter', 'not', 'merely', 'portrayal', 'psychotic', 'behavior', 'one', 'other', 'purposes', 'instrument', 'providing', 'redemption', 'character', 'also', 'film', 'noir', 'theme', 'sudden', 'occurrence', 'havoc', 'misfortune', 'anytime', 'place.On', 'one', 'level', 'film', 'engrossing', 'display', 'fine', 'acting', 'wrenching', 'drama', 'also', 'admonition', 'most', 'clement', 'secure', 'environments', 'unpleasantness', 'unexpected', 'lurk']",Don't Bother to Knock VHS
312629,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302439485,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 6]","While staying at the Franklin Hotel, Jed Towers, whose girlfriend, singer Lyn Leslie has broken up with him because he has a cynical attitude and lacks what she wants in a man, &quot;an understanding heart&quot;, spots a young woman in the room directly across his from the courtyard.  That woman happens to be Nell, who is babysitting for Peter and Ruth Jones while the former is downstairs accepting an award for notable editorials.  She got the job thanks to her uncle, Eddie, an elevator man at the hotel.  Smarting from the reasons Lyn gave him, he calls her up, then comes over to her room.  Little does her know his encounter with her transforms him from the mean, glib, cynic to someone more compassionate.Yes, Nell's pretty enough, and he sees she is dressed in a nice kimono, with earrings and a bracelet.  What he doesn't know is that those things belong to Ms. Jones.  He learns several things about her.  One, she had an abused childhood.  Two, she has clearly mistaken him for an old flame who died during World War II and is in love with him.  Three, she flies into a rage when Bunny, her young and sleepless charge, catches them kissing.  And four, he sees scars on both her wrists.The major debit of this film is the heavy-handedness of the story, the lack of any memorable dialogue, and not too many sympathetic characters.  Also, not much detail is given about Nell's childhood, and how she came to be this way.Elisha Cook Jr. does well as Eddie, extending the nervousness he did as Wilmer in The Maltese Falcon with genuine concern.  And this is Anne Bancroft's debut film, where she plays Lyn.  Also, fans of Gilligan's Island will recognize Jim Backus (Thurston Howell III) as Mr. Jones.Which leads to Marilyn.  This was quite a change for her after playing one single-dimensional blonde after another.  She plays Nell, initially a quiet, brooding, listless, introverted woman, who gets a suddenly comes to life when she sees Jed, then mentally disintegrates in the course of events.  Initial critics said she floated as opposed to sinking or swimming.  I say she veers more on the swim side.  She's seen clutching her hands together, symbolizing how she's trying to hang on to herself, and the scene where the camera shows her wrists foretells the madness to come.  Indeed, Jed's remark that &quot;you're a gal with a lot of variations&quot; is apropos, coupled with his remark that she's &quot;silk on one side and sandpaper on the other.&quot;Another technique is the mirror, which Nell looks upon when she puts on Ms. Jones' things, which mirrors her delusion, of the things she painfully yearns for and thinks she would've gotten if her lover hadn't perished in the war.  It also mirrors the fantasy stories she tells Jed, like the hotel room being hers, her going to South America, a fantasy atmosphere that gradually unravels as things fall into place.  In short, the mirror reflects Nell's inability to tell fantasy from reality.Other credits of this film includes the fact that due to budget constraints, director Roy Ward Baker, best known for the Hammer Dracula films of the 70's, did only one take throughout, the results of which are impressive in its own right.  Another is that Marilyn did not need a retake, a leitmotif in her later films like Some Like It Hot.Worth watching if only to judge if the critics, who dismissed Marilyn's blank expression in an attempt to take on a mentally unbalanced person, were right, or if this is a sign of the acting abilities she would demonstrate in her better movies, so please don't automatically dub this Don't Bother To Watch.

This film marks Marilyn's first dramatic starring role, and it is Marilyn as you would never see her again.  She plays Nell, a deeply troubled young lady whose shyness and aloofness at first prove to be only the tip of the iceberg in relation to her problems.  She has recently moved to New York to start her life over again, and her helpful uncle, an elevator operator in a grand hotel, has arranged for her to baby-sit a wealthy couple's little girl for the night.  This, as soon becomes apparent, was not a good idea.  Her behavior becomes stranger and stranger as the night progresses, exacerbated by the attentions of a young man (Richard Widmark) who comes calling on the rebound after seeing her from the room across the way.  His girl has just broken things off with him downstairs, but the simple diversion he seeks in the form of some drinks and kicks with a beautiful stranger becomes something else entirely.  As the roots and degree of Nell's problems are slowly revealed, the film takes on a very dark tone charged with suspense.Marilyn delivers a truly incredible performance in this early performance from 1952.  Her aura of innocence and vulnerability plays perfectly in her role as Nell, and the range of emotions she conveys as the film progresses is amazingly convincing, making her character one who must be feared as much as sympathized with.  I can't find a single weak spot in her performance, and I imagine the melancholy side of her true nature, the Norma Jean in her, served as a source of inspiration and strength for her in this demanding role.This movie is quite overlooked today, with most people associating Niagara or even Gentlemen Prefer Blondes with Marilyn's first starring role, but those who see this movie will most likely never be able to forget it.  Sadly, some of the plot summaries I have read elsewhere (including the back covers of the Marilyn Monroe Collection videos) over dramatize things, saying Nell and Jed (Widmark) end up in bed together at one point or labeling Nell as a murderess.  Such sensational claims are not true, and there is nothing remotely sexy about this movie.  It is a serious and powerful dramatization of a deeply troubled young lady fighting some very real personal demons in a place and time she is quite ill suited for.  Marilyn's performance won critical praise and helped make 1952 the year that launched her into superstardom.",5,Marilyn's first and most dramatic starring role,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,2561,"['Anyone', 'who', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'not', 'talented', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'never', 'seen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', 'darkly', 'unique', 'entry', 'Marilyn', 'filmography', 'film', 'Marilyn', 'first', 'dramatic', 'starring', 'role', 'Marilyn', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'Nell', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'young', 'lady', 'shyness', 'aloofness', 'first', 'prove', 'be', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'relation', 'problems', 'recently', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'start', 'life', 'again', 'helpful', 'uncle', 'elevator', 'operator', 'grand', 'hotel', 'arranged', 'baby-sit', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'little', 'girl', 'night', 'soon', 'apparent', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'behavior', 'becomes', 'stranger', 'stranger', 'night', 'exacerbated', 'attentions', 'young', 'man', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'who', 'calling', 'rebound', 'seeing', 'room', 'way', 'girl', 'just', 'broken', 'things', 'downstairs', 'simple', 'diversion', 'form', 'drinks', 'kicks', 'beautiful', 'stranger', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'roots', 'degree', 'Nell', 'problems', 'are', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'tone', 'charged', 'suspense.Marilyn', 'delivers', 'truly', 'incredible', 'performance', 'early', 'performance', '1952', 'aura', 'innocence', 'vulnerability', 'plays', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Nell', 'range', 'emotions', 'conveys', 'film', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'making', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'feared', 'as', 'much', 'sympathized', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'single', 'weak', 'spot', 'performance', 'imagine', 'melancholy', 'side', 'true', 'nature', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'served', 'source', 'inspiration', 'strength', 'demanding', 'role.This', 'movie', 'quite', 'overlooked', 'today', 'most', 'people', 'associating', 'Niagara', 'even', 'Gentlemen', 'Prefer', 'Blondes', 'Marilyn', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'forget', 'Sadly', 'plot', 'summaries', 'have', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'including', 'back', 'covers', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Collection', 'videos', 'dramatize', 'things', 'saying', 'Nell', 'Jed', 'Widmark', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'together', 'one', 'point', 'labeling', 'Nell', 'murderess', 'Such', 'sensational', 'claims', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'movie', 'serious', 'powerful', 'dramatization', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'young', 'lady', 'fighting', 'very', 'real', 'personal', 'demons', 'place', 'time', 'quite', 'ill', 'suited', 'Marilyn', 'performance', 'won', 'critical', 'praise', 'helped', 'make', '1952', 'year', 'launched', 'superstardom']",Don't Bother to Knock VHS

But the producers in Hollywood never gave her a real chance to be a success doing serious roles and only until Mistfits, some nine years after this movie, did she once again get to illustrate the depth of her acting abilities.In this movie, she is doing one of her finest acting at an already very early stage of her career - before her commercially successful and better known pictures such as How to Marry A Millionaire, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, The Seven Year Itch and of course Some Like it Hot catapulted her into stardom and then legend.One can only imagine what she could have turned into acting-wise had she been allowed to continue on that route and fully develop and expand her abilities as an actress.  Unfortunately, Hollywood was merciless in that regard and Marilyn's success dependent very strongly on the success she could bring at the box office.  Marilyn, therefore, realized early on that she had to be able to sell and that people, as well as the studios themselves preferred her as the voluptuous blonde ditsy kitten than as the serious dramatic actress she could be; they had Liz Taylor, Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepurn for that.This movie is from the small window in Monroe's career where she was still undamaged by Hollywood's demands on her, ultimately becoming a caricature of herself, and instead allowed to take on the role of a person with more psychological depth than any of the characters she would ever play later on in her career (except for Misfits). Richard Widwmark and Anne Bancroft do a great job as well, but they are easily overshadowed by Monroe's breathtaking radiance and screen presence.As I said, I am still surprised that after this role she was still not taken seriously as an actor and was in fact often mocked by such serious and talented actors as Bette Davis. Maybe her beauty and extraordinary femininity were overwhelming for everyone around her, including her female counterparts, evoking jealousy and just too powerful to ignore and she could not have ever been anything else in Hollywood but what she was exhuming outwardly.The title of this movie is horribly misleading and cheap, by the way.

The film benefits from its claustrophobic setting and manages to stay engrossing from start to finish.Monroe plays Nell, an unstable woman whose uncle, an elevator operator at a posh hotel, manages to get her a one night baby-sitting job, taking care of an eight year old girl. It is evident from the start that Nell is not ""all there,"" but slowly, we get to see just how ""not there"" she really is, and why. Nell WILL NOT let anything stand in the way of her love for a pilot, played by Richard Widmark, no matter what it takes and who she kills.Deliberately paced, but fascinating and terrifying, ""Don't Bother to Knock"" seems way ahead of its time and brilliantly explores the mind of a true psychotic. This is a wonderful character study in one of the few films Monroe didn't play some dumb blonde trying to marry some attractive millionaire. She fully displays her acting potential and manages to be creepy, sexy,and evil, yet makes you feel for her and long for everything to work out.This is the film for the true Marilyn fan.",5,Knock Knock...Who's There???

312647,A269VN2ZNRDA7N,6302439485,Megzi,"[5, 10]","'Don't Bother to Knock' looks promising from the outside. What could be better than seeing Marilyn Monroe give one of her few dramatic performances? After all, she was great in 'The Misfits', decent in 'Bus Stop' and 'Niagra'. This one is good too, right?Wrong. This film is horrible. Honestly the preview for this film (the trailer is an extra on the DVD) is so cheesy this film would have worked better as a parody. Of course, it was 1952, so I guess they didn't realize films still had a long way to go. A weak attempt to be a noir/dramatic/suspense film that just doesn't cut it. The script is weak, the characters are flat and underdeveloped, and the acting is embarassing. Although many Monroe fans may be smitten with her acting in this film, I'm not buying it. The breathy,  sex goddess voice just doesn't cut it for a mentally deranged chick. Instead her portrayal comes off as a weak cross between trying to be a psycho and trying to be sexy. You could see Monroe still wanted her character to be sexually appealing (or maybe it was the producers who wanted her character to be sexually appealing) and that just doesn't work for a psychotic character. Whether or not it's a sex goddess actress playing a psychotic character doesn't matter. The line between bringing an actor's personality into a character should not be crossed, and in this case, it is. We cannot help but see Nell as 'Marilyn Monroe trying to play a psycho' instead of just 'Nell the psycho'. Monroe's attempt at drama is interesting to watch, but at times, cringeworthy. By this time, she may have perfected her ability at playing bombshells but not yet drama. It is safe to say Monroe's dramatic acting would certainly improve later on (re: 'The Misfits'). But as terrible as 'Don't Bother to Knock' is, the film should not be completely ignored, it's a good piece of memorabilia for movie fans. We get to see Monroe with darker hair and less makeup and watch as a young Anne Bancroft makes her film debut.

312649,A10X0JN8KTK89H,6302439485,ninjasuperstar,"[4, 4]","If I were to classify Don't Bother to Knock, I would put it into the rarely used category of meta-noir. All of the elements of noir are in full force here: an urban landscape, an inquisitive male lead stuck between two women, a suspenseful plot, but then the noir aspects break down. (I will be intentionally vague in the next few sentences so as not to give the plot away.) The script offers what seems like a femme fatale role, a staple of all noir, but the script blunts and softens her, and the audience must rethink and re-judge her at the close of the film. In many films noir, there is also a nurturing woman to counter the femme fatale and seduce the male lead in a more traditional way. In this film, however, there is no nurturing woman, but rather a strong, independent woman. The film seems to throw noir completely on its head, complicating stock female characters and making the male lead more dynamic than one would expect from noir. The result is a tidy vignette that argues against the noir world, yet unfortunately runs out of time before offering another world in return.Marilyn Monroe (playing Nell Forbes) steals this film effortlessly. Because she is generally not a strong actor, it's wonderful to see Monroe so confident and subtle. I imagine that she knew Nell better than any other character she ever played. As I was watching the movie, I wondered what Monroe could have been if Hollywood had taken her more seriously and challenged her rather than relegating her to perpetual blonde bombshell. I was surprised and fascinated by the moments in this film when Monroe ceased to be attractive. She spends almost the entire film inside two adjoining hotel rooms, and it's amazing what she can do with few props and very little space.It's been argued that the script is weak and that all the characters aside from Nell are underdeveloped. I agree that the film showcases Monroe, but the script isn't that bad. The first half of the movie is peppered with cheesy, noir one-liners and sets an intriguing mood slowly. This is intentional. Quite suddenly, a dramatic thriller sets in the second half of the film, the canned dialogue gets tossed, and the noir elements unravel quickly.Any Monroe fan should treasure this film, but even those who find most of her other films silly should give this one a chance. It's a glimpse of Monroe as she could have been.",3,I had no idea Marilyn Monroe could act,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,2377,"['were', 'classify', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', 'would', 'put', 'rarely', 'used', 'category', 'meta-noir', 'elements', 'noir', 'are', 'full', 'force', 'here', 'urban', 'landscape', 'inquisitive', 'male', 'lead', 'stuck', 'two', 'women', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'then', 'noir', 'aspects', 'break', 'down', 'will', 'be', 'intentionally', 'vague', 'next', 'few', 'sentences', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'script', 'what', 'femme', 'fatale', 'role', 'staple', 'noir', 'script', 'blunts', 'audience', 'must', 'rethink', 're-judge', 'close', 'film', 'many', 'films', 'noir', 'also', 'nurturing', 'woman', 'counter', 'femme', 'fatale', 'seduce', 'male', 'lead', 'more', 'traditional', 'way', 'film', 'however', 'nurturing', 'woman', 'rather', 'strong', 'independent', 'woman', 'film', 'throw', 'noir', 'completely', 'head', 'complicating', 'stock', 'female', 'characters', 'making', 'male', 'lead', 'more', 'dynamic', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'noir', 'result', 'tidy', 'vignette', 'noir', 'world', 'yet', 'unfortunately', 'time', 'offering', 'world', 'return.Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'playing', 'Nell', 'Forbes', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'generally', 'not', 'strong', 'actor', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Monroe', 'confident', 'subtle', 'imagine', 'knew', 'Nell', 'better', 'other', 'character', 'ever', 'played', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'wondered', 'what', 'Monroe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'taken', 'more', 'seriously', 'challenged', 'rather', 'relegating', 'perpetual', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'was', 'surprised', 'fascinated', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'Monroe', 'ceased', 'be', 'attractive', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'two', 'adjoining', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'amazing', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'few', 'props', 'very', 'little', 'space.It', 'been', 'argued', 'script', 'weak', 'characters', 'aside', 'Nell', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'agree', 'film', 'Monroe', 'script', ""n't"", 'bad', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'peppered', 'cheesy', 'noir', 'one-liners', 'sets', 'intriguing', 'mood', 'slowly', 'intentional', 'Quite', 'suddenly', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'sets', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'canned', 'dialogue', 'tossed', 'noir', 'elements', 'unravel', 'quickly.Any', 'Monroe', 'fan', 'should', 'treasure', 'film', 'even', 'who', 'find', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'silly', 'should', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'glimpse', 'Monroe', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Don't Bother to Knock VHS

The characters are developed with simple and short sequences, you can feel that their story has started long before we are introduced to them and the filmmakers are successful in giving us hints into their psyches. The camera shots are telling the story as much as the dialogue; in one scene the close up shot of a woman putting on lipstick in front of a mirror she holds in one hand while applying with the other, reveals scars on both wrists to further give information of her mental state and vulnerability. Also through carefully placed dialogue we learn of the characters' philosophy and of their personalities, like the elevator operator who is constantly apologizing to guests and fussing over them with questions; 'are you satisified with this or that during your stay'. The film understands which parts of the story needs to be in the confinements of theatrical elements, which parts need to be literary and when to use the camera shot as part of the story-telling. Considering most filmmakers do not understand the language of cinema, it is an unexpected surprise to find a film as simple as this one doing it right; Hitchcock would be proud.

She loves the big lug, but she's troubled by his lack of ""an understanding heart"" and she half-heartedly breaks up with him. Enter Nell Forbes, niece of the elevator man who has procured her a babysitting job for a couple who is staying at the hotel. From the start, it's apparent that something is not right with Nell, who seems lost in some private world. Monroe looks dramatically different than was typical for her at the time. In frowsy dress, dark hair and almost no makeup, she is none the less still beautiful, although she carries herself as someone with little confidence, her posture is limp and her movement tentative. Her uncle, played by the wonderful character actor Elisha Cook Jr, points up Nell's instability by mentioning she has suffered the recent loss of her boyfriend in an aviation accident, and asks her incessantly if she is going to be okay. ""No mischief, alright Nell?"" In fact, Nell is just out of an asylum where she has suffered a total collapse which today would probably be diagnosed as Post Traumatic Shock Syndrome.  In Nell's case, she seems not to have quite accepted the death of her lover, and as the plot goes on, it becomes apparent that she lapses into delusions that he is still alive.When she sees Richard Widmark through her hotel window, she decides he is her lost love and flashes the blinds to get his attention. He calls her and she invites him over for drinks. The real problems begin when her charge won't stay in bed, threatening Nell's delusion, which Widmark--distracted as he is by the promise of an easy conquest with a beautiful woman-- is slow to comprehend. When Uncle Eddie comes to check on her, things really get out of hand as she clunks him on the head with a heavy lamp just as he is about to discover the man she has stashed in the bathroom. This reawakens Bunny, whom Nell subdues with rope and gag!Monroe has a great scene where her misdeeds have been discovered and her play-world has broken, as she zeroes in on the child she feels is to blame for everything having gone wrong. Looking around the room like a lost waif, her eyes suddenly focus, turning murderous on the door of the child's room. ""It's all your fault,"" she whispers as neighbors use her phone to call hotel security. ""We had a bargain....you devil..."" It's a chilling moment, and Monroe suffuses her characterization with real menace,  as well as pathos for a woman who is not really a villain but a victim of her own broken perception.Staggering away from the havoc she has wrecked (and a near homicide), Monroe looks bleary, lost and completely believable,  showing a glimpse of the powerhouse performance she might have been able to deliver in stronger directorial hands. Alas, Roy Baker has not helmed ""Don't Bother to Knock"" very imaginatively, in addition to playing both sides of the fence with Monroe's persona. It's as if he couldn't decide whether to sell the film as a sexy seduction scene gone wrong, or a psychodrama, and his effort to go for something in between is not altogether successful. The script is nowhere near up to Hitchcock's level, but you can't help but imagine what he might have been able to do with it, and with Monroe.In the end, you manage to feel sorry for Nell despite all she has done. As she's led away by policeman,  Widmark promises to continue to help her, thus winning back the heart of Bancroft, for Nell has taught him to have the ""understanding heart"" he lacked. For her part, we can only hope Nell will get the help she needs.And no more babysitting jobs!",3,Interesting Footnote in Monroe's Career,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,3918,"['Marilyn', 'customary', 'sexy', 'baby', 'persona', 'tries', 'Dont', 'Bother', 'Knock', 'minor', 'film', 'troubled', 'girl', 'who', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'babysitting', 'result', 'odd', 'little', 'B-picture', 'alternatingly', 'moving', 'interesting', 'then', 'slow', 'wooden', 'turns.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'lounge', 'singer', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'grouchy', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'big', 'lug', 'troubled', 'lack', 'understanding', 'heart', 'half-heartedly', 'up', 'Enter', 'Nell', 'Forbes', 'niece', 'elevator', 'man', 'who', 'procured', 'babysitting', 'job', 'couple', 'who', 'staying', 'hotel', 'start', 'apparent', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'Nell', 'who', 'lost', 'private', 'world', 'Monroe', 'dramatically', 'different', 'was', 'typical', 'time', 'frowsy', 'dress', 'dark', 'hair', 'almost', 'makeup', 'none', 'less', 'still', 'beautiful', 'someone', 'little', 'confidence', 'posture', 'limp', 'movement', 'tentative', 'uncle', 'played', 'wonderful', 'character', 'actor', 'Elisha', 'Cook', 'Jr', 'up', 'Nell', 'instability', 'mentioning', 'suffered', 'recent', 'loss', 'boyfriend', 'aviation', 'accident', 'incessantly', 'going', 'be', 'okay', 'mischief', 'alright', 'Nell', 'fact', 'Nell', 'just', 'asylum', 'where', 'suffered', 'total', 'collapse', 'today', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'diagnosed', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Shock', 'Syndrome', 'Nell', 'case', 'not', 'have', 'quite', 'accepted', 'death', 'lover', 'plot', 'apparent', 'delusions', 'still', 'alive.When', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'hotel', 'window', 'lost', 'love', 'blinds', 'get', 'attention', 'over', 'drinks', 'real', 'problems', 'begin', 'when', 'charge', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'bed', 'threatening', 'Nell', 'delusion', 'Widmark', 'distracted', 'promise', 'easy', 'conquest', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'slow', 'comprehend', 'When', 'Uncle', 'Eddie', 'check', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'hand', 'head', 'heavy', 'lamp', 'just', 'discover', 'man', 'stashed', 'bathroom', 'Bunny', 'whom', 'Nell', 'rope', 'gag', 'Monroe', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'misdeeds', 'have', 'been', 'discovered', 'play-world', 'broken', 'child', 'blame', 'everything', 'having', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Looking', 'room', 'lost', 'waif', 'eyes', 'suddenly', 'focus', 'turning', 'murderous', 'door', 'child', 'room', 'fault', 'neighbors', 'use', 'phone', 'call', 'hotel', 'security', 'had', 'bargain', 'devil', 'chilling', 'moment', 'Monroe', 'characterization', 'real', 'menace', 'as', 'well', 'pathos', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'villain', 'victim', 'own', 'broken', 'perception.Staggering', 'away', 'havoc', 'wrecked', 'near', 'homicide', 'Monroe', 'bleary', 'lost', 'completely', 'believable', 'showing', 'glimpse', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'deliver', 'stronger', 'directorial', 'hands', 'Alas', 'Roy', 'Baker', 'not', 'helmed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', 'very', 'imaginatively', 'addition', 'playing', 'sides', 'fence', 'Monroe', 'persona', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'sell', 'film', 'sexy', 'seduction', 'scene', 'gone', 'wrong', 'psychodrama', 'effort', 'go', 'something', 'not', 'altogether', 'successful', 'script', 'nowhere', 'near', 'Hitchcock', 'level', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'Monroe.In', 'end', 'manage', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Nell', 'done', 'led', 'away', 'policeman', 'Widmark', 'continue', 'help', 'thus', 'winning', 'back', 'heart', 'Bancroft', 'Nell', 'taught', 'have', 'understanding', 'heart', 'lacked', 'part', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Nell', 'will', 'get', 'help', 'more', 'babysitting', 'jobs']",Don't Bother to Knock VHS

Nell begins trying on the mother of the child she's babysitting clothes, wearing her perfume, earrings, and flirting with the recently broken-hearted across the way, played by Richard Widmark. She invites him over after the little girl has gone to bed. She pretends that she and her ""sister"" are the renters of the hotel room and that she's there all alone. However, secrets of Nell unravel as the plot progresses. In the end, she is stopped short of committing suicide.I think that this movie will please many Monroe/non-Monroe fans far more than expected. It can also be said that if this movie was released later in Monroe's career that it would've been a bigger success and would've garnered more critical acclaim. So give it a try, ""Bother to Knock"" on this film noir classic gem way back from 1952.",5,"Marilyn is beautiful, talent, and in this: DANGEROUS!",1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,1367,"['When', 'people', 'think', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'think', 'diamonds', 'glamour', 'actress', 'who', 'appeared', 'lavish', 'multi-millionaire', 'dollar', 'budgeted', 'Technicolor', 'comedies', 'musicals', 'actress', 'who', 'died', 'mysteriously', 'age', '36.However', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', 'dark', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'noir', '1952', 'prefame', 'Monroe', 'world', 'more', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'glamour', 'sex', 'movie', 'Monroe', 'mentally', 'disturb', 'Nell', 'Forbes', 'young', 'who', 'asked', 'babysit', 'child', 'one', 'evening', 'trouble', 'soon', 'Nell', 'trying', 'mother', 'child', 'babysitting', 'clothes', 'wearing', 'perfume', 'earrings', 'flirting', 'recently', 'broken-hearted', 'way', 'played', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'over', 'little', 'girl', 'gone', 'bed', 'sister', 'are', 'renters', 'hotel', 'room', 'there', 'alone', 'However', 'secrets', 'Nell', 'unravel', 'plot', 'end', 'stopped', 'short', 'committing', 'suicide.I', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'please', 'many', 'Monroe/non-Monroe', 'fans', 'far', 'more', 'expected', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'later', 'Monroe', 'career', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bigger', 'success', 'would', ""'ve"", 'garnered', 'more', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'So', 'give', 'try', 'Bother', 'Knock', 'film', 'noir', 'classic', 'gem', 'way', 'back', '1952']",Don't Bother to Knock VHS

312658,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,6302439485,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 2]","Before there was Swimfan (2002, which is only being listed because it fits the genre, not because it is great), The Crush (1993), Fatal Attraction (1987) or even Play Misty for Me (1971), there was ""Don't Bother to Knock"" (1952).  The conduit between all of the former movies is one key element; the antagonist is a woman suffering from borderline personality disorder/BPD.  In simple terms, women who are a bit cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs and there is no milk in sight.This movie is somewhat of a departure of the Marilyn Monroe that we all knew in her cinematic career.  Her character of Nell is dark, disturbed and doleful.  Consequently, these character traits make her anything but monotonous.  It mirrors the hidden dangerous and dandy motives to her character.  The thing I like about Monroe in this movie is it wasn't the usual role for her.  She wasn't all ""dolled up"", meaning she didn't have  pounds of make-up on, her hair wasn't vivid blonde and her clothes were more conservative than other roles she has performed before and after this film.Don't get me wrong, all the prior listed traits were wonderful and made Monroe very, very sexy.  However, this seemed like a more stripped down performance.  I felt this only added to the arcane quality of presentation.  In many ways Marilyn Monroe is remembered for her role in ""The Seven Year Itch"" or the bright and sleek dress she wore in ""Niagara"" or even her musical number in ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"".  This is fine, but almost puts that stigma of ""sexy dumb blonde"".  If nothing else, ""Don't Bother to Knock"" displays that Marilyn Monroe wasn't a total one trick pony.Of course Monroe's character Nell isn't totally devoid of the sexiness Monroe played in her films.  There is still the breathy voice and erotic vibe that she always sported, just differently.  As for Nell being too unstable or ""psycho"" to be sexy, I beg to differ.  Nell would be classified as a person who suffers from borderline personality disorder, as noted prior. Therefore, it isn't that impossible to see her character as both ""sexy and psycho"".  One of the real and tangible things that most BPD women have is their looks.  It is their secret weapon, because (most) of these women with BPD have a real hard time with true intimacy and identity.  Therefore, the one solid and tangible thing they possess is their sex appeal.As for plot, the entire 76 minute movie takes place in a hotel.  Nell is hired to baby sit for a couple while they are at a business dinner in the lobby of the hotel.  She got this job via nepotism, her cousin the bellhop.  Enter Richard Widmark, who plays the perfect part as the ""average guy"" down on his luck.  When presented with the situation of ""hooking up"" with Nell after he breaks up from his girlfriend (played by a young Anne Bancroft). Mr. Widmark appears totally genuine and enthusiastic with the invitation to room 809.In conclusion, this movie is a nice slice of quasi-film noir (shot in black and white) and is both entertaining and unique, given that the movie was made in the early 1950s.  Friends or foes of Marilyn Monroe's work might find it hard to deny ""Don't Bother to Knock"" as one of her most atypical performances.  The DVD has the original trailer/preview for ""Don't Bother to Knock"", and a preview for the Diamond Collection (selected films from Marilyn Monroe's resume).  There is also a restoration comparison showing what this movie looked like before and after it was re-mastered.

As Nell, a mentally unstable woman whose lover was killed in WWII, Monroe delivers a creepy performance.  Hired for the night to babysit a little girl (Donna Corcoran) Nell drifts  in and out of reality.  Director Roy Baker draws out desperate emotionalism  from Monroe, who is eerily convincing with her lines, and facial  expressions.  Richard Widmark plays Jed, a cold hearted pilot who cannot  understand why his lounge singer girlfriend ( Anne Bancroft) has jilted  him.  Elisha Cook Jr. once again delivers a fine supporting role as the  hotel elevator operator caught up in his nieces's (Nell's) strange  behavior.  The film is almost entirely shot within the confines of a hotel  room and Baker's camera work and tight cutting adds to the suspense.
