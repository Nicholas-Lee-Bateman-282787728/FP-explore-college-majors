The Grand Illusion is my fav Styx album and Pieces of Eight ranks high up there too, so to have a Live show where they just do those albums, sure why not.That Gowen guy does do a decent job, he's no Dennis, but he aint bad either. Plus, him and Todd Sugarman have been in the band now 13 years, how time flies by huh? The 2 replacement guys have spent more time in Styx then DDY did!The DVD is filmed beautifully! Good clean crisp film of the show. The 5.1 sound mix is ok, seems it could have been a better use of speaker separation, but it didnt stink either. The crowd was small and seemed rather quiet, but this isn't Rush or The Who they came to see either, but they seemed a tad reserved, those big stadium days are over, this theater prob housed 8,000 tops, so you get a good intimate night with Styx. Tommy Shaw was superb, his renditions were excellent and he played and sang with a lot of emotion JY did a very good version of ""Miss America"". So I have to highly recommend this DVD! Even if your still mad because they booted out Dennis, I understand your frustration, I'm there with ya, but this is a very good and entertaining DVD, a DVD where they play 2 classic albums from start to finish....enjoy!",5,Never thought I'd give 5 stars w/o Dennis but...,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,1353,"['So', 'brother', 'told', 'DVD', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'was', 'No', 'Dennis', 'No', 'thank', 'saw', 'real', 'cheap', 'Best', 'Buy', 'bought', 'copy', 'Grand', 'Illusion', 'fav', 'Styx', 'album', 'Pieces', 'Eight', 'ranks', 'high', 'up', 'there', 'too', 'so', 'have', 'Live', 'show', 'where', 'just', 'do', 'albums', 'sure', 'why', 'Gowen', 'guy', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'Dennis', 'bad', 'either', 'Todd', 'Sugarman', 'have', 'been', 'band', 'now', '13', 'years', 'how', 'time', 'flies', 'huh', '2', 'replacement', 'guys', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'Styx', 'then', 'DDY', 'did', 'DVD', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'Good', 'clean', 'crisp', 'film', 'show', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', 'ok', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'use', 'speaker', 'separation', 'stink', 'crowd', 'was', 'small', 'seemed', 'rather', 'quiet', ""n't"", 'Rush', 'Who', 'came', 'see', 'either', 'seemed', 'tad', 'reserved', 'big', 'stadium', 'days', 'are', 'over', 'theater', 'prob', 'housed', '8,000', 'tops', 'get', 'good', 'intimate', 'night', 'Styx', 'Tommy', 'Shaw', 'was', 'superb', 'renditions', 'were', 'excellent', 'played', 'sang', 'lot', 'emotion', 'JY', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'version', 'Miss', 'America', 'have', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Even', 'still', 'mad', 'booted', 'out', 'Dennis', 'understand', 'frustration', ""'m"", 'ya', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'where', 'play', '2', 'classic', 'albums', 'start', 'finish', '.enjoy']",Styx: The Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight

While I saw this video, offering two of the best albums from them together, in their entirety, and IMO two of the best albums from that time as well, I couldn't resist the temptation of getting it. Guys, I was expecting some kind of maybe good approach to the real sound of that time, given some of the complexity of that work, but no, I was wrong, I was really shocked to see how good this concert was put together, and performed, songs seem to be directly from the album...And for the DDY fans, guys, just face it, he is good, one of the best singers out there nowadays, but he is also responsible for some, if not most of it, of the mediocre material of the 80's of that band as well, his Barry Manilowish performance of the last albums is simply unbearable for me...if you can get it, just jump on it, do not let this one get away...",5,Two thumbs up for Styx...,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,1058,"['Even', ""'m"", 'not', 'hardcore/die-hard', 'fan', 'Styx', 'let', 'face', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'others', 'music', 'well', 'not', 'hard', 'grab', 'anything', '70', 'give', 'spin', 'saw', 'video', 'offering', 'two', 'best', 'albums', 'together', 'entirety', 'IMO', 'two', 'best', 'albums', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'temptation', 'getting', 'Guys', 'was', 'expecting', 'kind', 'maybe', 'good', 'approach', 'real', 'sound', 'time', 'given', 'complexity', 'work', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'really', 'shocked', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'concert', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'performed', 'songs', 'seem', 'be', 'directly', 'album', 'DDY', 'fans', 'guys', 'just', 'face', 'good', 'one', 'best', 'singers', 'out', 'there', 'nowadays', 'also', 'responsible', 'not', 'most', 'mediocre', 'material', '80', 'band', 'as', 'well', 'Barry', 'Manilowish', 'performance', 'last', 'albums', 'simply', 'unbearable', 'can', 'get', 'just', 'jump', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'one', 'get', 'away']",Styx: The Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight

Multi triple platinum albums 1977's Grand Illusion and '78 Pieces of Eight  two of the probably the greatest rock albums of all time played live with Styx main core members Tommy Shaw and James 'JY' Young peforming flawlessly.Tommy and JY have been able to hold Styx  leagacy  for over a decade together well, with a very competent line up and despite their well publicised break up with original member Dennis De Young have been able tour and release albums with huge success.Their line up over the years have been consistant with Lawrence Gowan on Vocals and Keys, Ricky Phillip on bass and Tod Sucherman on drums.The concert filmed on November 9th, 2010 at the historic Orpheum Theater in Memphis, TN, culminates the great showmanship,energy and friendship the band has been harnessing over the years.I lived off these albums in '78-'79 played them 24/07 this was truly a 'Rock Odyssey' they were the 'real' days of hard rock!!!I still have these albums including the limited edition  of pieces of eight.Orignal founding member Chuck 'chucky' Panazzo as usual makes guest appearences on songs with the heavy base lines like 'fooling yourself' and appears to be very happy with these stints. For years I've been yearning to hear 'Man in the wilderness and tommy nearly brought tears to my eyes so was Lawrence on  Castle Walls, Sing for the day, I'm Ok were executed to perfection, also JY songs Miss America, Lord of the Rings  were performed  to perfection It's  as though you are  listening to them off the original albums.I've always loved the ageless  Tommy's songs in Styx's Crystal Ball, Grand Illusion, Pieces of Eight and Cornerstone he had that 'lulaby voice' and together with JY produced some soaring solos De Young was very Inspirational until in '80 when he tried to'theatrerise' the band and that was the end of Styx...but the  Styx resurgence in  the last era has moved us the harcore fans !!!

I'm a DDY fan but let's admit it, DDY has been out of the band for well over 12 years, people.Would I rather have DDY in Styx today? Sure. Do I hate Lawrence Gowan or Tommy Shaw or James JY Young for DDY's absence? No.If this DVD is anything like the July 2011 concert I saw by Styx, it will be really great. Yeah, I sorta missed DDY at the 2011 show, but Gowan is a good showman, and the rest of the band also put on a great show (Shaw and Young handle most of the lead vocals in Styx's concerts these days, with Gowan only singing three (or maybe four)songs. And it's cool to see former Babys bassist Ricky Phillips thump the five string (Chuck Ponozzo is still a member of Styx but can only play so much live due to his health.)I don't know, I guess I am tiring of hearing the complaints that DDY is no longer in Styx, just like those who argue that Kiss shouldn't tour without Ace Frehley (who doesn't want to be in Kiss) and Peter Criss (who might want to be back in but has health issues that prevent him from touring extensively; a friend of mine who is a diehard Kiss fan saw one of Kiss' last shows with Peter and said he loves Peter, but Peter was struggling through the show, even on just the simple cowbell intro of ""Calling Dr. Love."")I dig the 1970s Styx, but I also am a fan of Styx's current lineup.  :)",4,Modern-day Styx gets a bad rap,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1374,"['am', 'puzzled', 'why', 'hate', 'modern-day', 'Styx', ""'m"", 'DDY', 'fan', 'let', 'admit', 'DDY', 'been', 'band', 'well', '12', 'years', 'people.Would', 'rather', 'have', 'DDY', 'Styx', 'today', 'Sure', 'Do', 'hate', 'Lawrence', 'Gowan', 'Tommy', 'Shaw', 'James', 'JY', 'Young', 'DDY', 'absence', 'No.If', 'DVD', 'anything', 'July', '2011', 'concert', 'saw', 'Styx', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'great', 'Yeah', 'sorta', 'missed', 'DDY', '2011', 'show', 'Gowan', 'good', 'showman', 'rest', 'band', 'also', 'put', 'great', 'show', 'Shaw', 'Young', 'handle', 'most', 'lead', 'vocals', 'Styx', 'concerts', 'days', 'Gowan', 'only', 'singing', 'three', 'maybe', 'four', 'songs', 'cool', 'see', 'former', 'Babys', 'bassist', 'Ricky', 'Phillips', 'thump', 'five', 'string', 'Chuck', 'Ponozzo', 'still', 'member', 'Styx', 'can', 'only', 'play', 'so', 'much', 'live', 'due', 'health', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guess', 'am', 'tiring', 'hearing', 'complaints', 'DDY', 'longer', 'Styx', 'just', 'who', 'argue', 'Kiss', 'should', ""n't"", 'tour', 'Ace', 'Frehley', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Kiss', 'Peter', 'Criss', 'who', 'might', 'want', 'be', 'back', 'health', 'issues', 'prevent', 'touring', 'extensively', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'diehard', 'Kiss', 'fan', 'saw', 'one', 'Kiss', 'last', 'shows', 'Peter', 'said', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'was', 'struggling', 'show', 'even', 'just', 'simple', 'cowbell', 'intro', 'Calling', 'Dr', 'Love', 'dig', '1970s', 'Styx', 'also', 'am', 'fan', 'Styx', 'current', 'lineup']",Styx: The Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight

While it may seem unnecessary to state, these recordings come alive, literally alive.Some might argue that many of these songs are already mainstays of the Styx setlist and that many of them have been captured live in the trove of live CD's and video released by Styx in the last decade, but this format gives them a new life.  It's kinda like taking out your old Styx records and putting them on your turntable, and suddenly the band walks into the room and plays all of the songs.Of the DVD, I can't imagine that it could have been filmed or recorded any better.  There are plenty of cameras to give the viewer a multitude of views and the sound is presented in DTS, filling the room with that ""right there in the middle of it"" sound.  For a fan, it can't get any better.Sure, the songs are old and many of them have been part of the setlist for decades, and there are many other live recordings from the band, but this is the only place to get the Side 1> Side 2> next album> Side 1> Side 2 in one convenient package.  For more than 2 hours and 11 minutes Styx fans are treated to the show of a lifetime.When all is said and done, this package works.  For fans that weren't able to catch this tour, this gives you the perfect opportunity to see the event and enjoy it over and over.

1514744,A2GJXG6JMHBD60,B006EMSO74,Boomerocity,"[2, 3]","Styx: The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight Live is an eye-popping DVD of the concert of all Styx concerts for the discerning fan.  For those of us who were teens in the seventies, this DVD will bring back many, many very fond memories as the band performs both albums in their entirety.Performed and recorded in the beautiful and historic Orpheum Theater in Memphis, Tennessee, Styx delivers each and every tune from both albums absolutely note perfect.  What makes this DVD especially unique is that, reportedly, the band never performed three of the songs live prior to this concert. Personal favorites such as Fooling Yourself, Blue Collar Man and Renegade never sounded better.  Hearing them on this DVD instantly transported me back to the late seventies.  What a trip!As with other bands from the seventies, the current line-up in Styx isn't ""all original"" on this recorded concert but I defy anyone to say that this version isn't as good as it gets.  The musicianship in this line-up is supremely represented in this concert.  Dennis DeYoung is replaced Lawrence Gowan and does a dang good job of it, thank you very much.  The late J.C. Curulewski is replaced on drums by Todd Sucherman who I at first thought was Journey drummer, Deen Castronovo but I soon figured he wasn't. But fans will be quite pleased that J.Y. Young, Tommy Shaw, Chuck Panozzo, and Ricky Phillips (formerly with Bad English and The Babys but with Styx  for the past nine years) are still cranking out the Styx tunes on this DVD.The albums that this DVD is based on are well known so a review of the songs isn't necessary here. However, as far as concert DVD's are concerned, you won't find a more brilliant DVD both in its quality of sound, visual appeal and production quality and is well worth the watch even if one isn't a Styx fan.

An extraordinary high powered reloaded concert where original members as Tommy Shaw, James (J.Y.)

There is another high point that is a must to mention because it helped the music: The sound of the drums are more deep and resonant like in the way of Seventies decade, as well as all the drum licks or little sound details of John Panozzo's playing... The same thing happened with keyboards and bass so the kind of medieval magic is still there... although it's inevitable to think that maybe, it would have been better that Dennis Deyoung had stay there partying with his old and long time friends (no matter what had happened before...).I had the opportunity to stay at the Dennis DeYoung and Styx concerts here in Mexico, and take part in a little chat with Tommy, Chuck and J.Y. after the Styx concert here...

Ricky Phillips fills in for Chuck most of the time and I don't hear people complaining about that? The music, audio quality and performance are excellent and kudos to Lawrence Gowan he may not be Dennis but he is an excellent keyboardist, can sing well and puts a lot of effort into what he is doing.

But after a few seconds, it became clear you simply got someone to mimic Dennis' voice. It's eerily close, but close in a way like Arnel Pineda is close to Steve Perry. I realize Styx has had internal issues & not all personalities work out in a collaboration. When Styx broke away from Dennis, I thought the main reasons were creative differences (as well as personality ones) and that Styx was wanting to go hard rocking and get away from the more theatrical direction Dennis wanted to pursue. But, here we are in 2013 and we have Grand Illusion/Pieces of Eight which have Dennis' ghost appearing in every single song. It's strange. It's surprising that as businessmen, Styx wouldn't swallow their internal bickering and regroup with Dennis and make even more money. Since cutting Dennis loose, where are all the hard rocking non-Dennis songs Styx promised?

1514772,ARGMJ7Y2C9KTC,B006EMSO74,Mike Brown,"[34, 36]","At age 13, one of the first records I ever bought was Styx's ""Grand Illusion."" When ""Pieces of Eight"" came out, I scrambled to get it. I remember lying on my back, lights out, headphones on, partaking in their sonic magic.By the time I began attending concerts (probably just a year later) Styx had already ventured off into ""Top 40 Land"" and I lost interest. I've seen the band numerous times since they re-grouped in 1990. And while every show has been great, none have fully matched my initial infatuation.For me, this DVD is pretty close to ""the Holy Grail."" It's the concert I was imagining in the dark all those years ago.Anyone familiar with these albums already knows that the set list is nothing less than perfect. In this performance, Styx is musically tight and with a majestic sound, looking healthy and happy. Each musician excels, and the Styx signature harmonies are out in force. Great care has been taken to fine-tune everything, even Styx mainstays (for example, ""Miss America"" gets back her usually-absent instrumental intro).Tommy Shaw is like some miracle of nature, singing and playing with as much prowess as ever. (""Sing For the Day"" is out of this world!)Drummer extraordinaire, Todd Sucherman, is exciting like fireworks. I read in an interview that his affection for these albums in his youth made this project a particular labor of love. It shows. And his technical flair adds a magic all its own.I wasn't expecting it, but some of the best sounding numbers turn out to be ""I'm Okay,"" ""Queen of Spades"" and ""Pieces of Eight,"" all penned and originally sung by Dennis DeYoung. Keyboardist/vocalist Lawence Gowan really nails them. And I'm happy to report, the keyboard ""voices,"" which I understand can be tough to replicate with equipment 30 years after-the-fact, come pretty darn close to the original tones.The only weakness I notice in the performance is a strain in James Young's voice on a couple of songs (although, not all of them). It must have been a bad night, as he's usually outstanding.Overall, I don't think the band has ever sounded better. These guys are total pros. And their joy and enthusiasm is infectious.The video itself is pristine and skillfully edited. You definitely feel up-close and catching special moments. The audio has been masterfully mixed by the band and very-long-time Styx engineer, Gary Loizzo.[On a side note, the Dolby Digital track has a lot more low-end ""punch"" than the lossless dts-HD track... at least on my system. The sound on the dts-HD is more discreet and clear. But for my listening enjoyment, the powerhouse drum and bass sound on the Dolby Digital track is ""the ticket.""]Included on the disc is a documentary where members of the Styx crew walk us through the staging and execution of the show. As a hobby guitarist who has spent some time with bands, I found it pretty interesting. My kids did as well.If you like 1977-78 era Styx, simply put, this DVD ROCKS! For fans that refuse to enjoy Styx sans Dennis DeYoung, (if, for nothing else, the principle of it), this obviously is not going to be their cup of tea. (To each his own.) But for everyone else, I can say without hesitation,""Pay the price, get your tickets for the show!""... and play it LOUD!",5,The concert I was imagining in the dark all those years ago,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,3233,"['age', '13', 'one', 'first', 'records', 'ever', 'bought', 'was', 'Styx', 'Grand', 'Illusion', 'When', 'Pieces', 'Eight', 'came', 'scrambled', 'get', 'remember', 'lying', 'back', 'out', 'headphones', 'partaking', 'sonic', 'time', 'began', 'attending', 'concerts', 'probably', 'just', 'year', 'later', 'Styx', 'had', 'already', 'ventured', 'off', 'Top', '40', 'Land', 'lost', 'interest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'band', 'numerous', 'times', 're-grouped', '1990', 'show', 'been', 'great', 'none', 'have', 'fully', 'matched', 'initial', 'infatuation.For', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'close', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'concert', 'was', 'imagining', 'dark', 'years', 'ago.Anyone', 'familiar', 'albums', 'already', 'set', 'list', 'nothing', 'less', 'perfect', 'performance', 'Styx', 'musically', 'tight', 'majestic', 'sound', 'looking', 'healthy', 'happy', 'musician', 'excels', 'Styx', 'signature', 'harmonies', 'are', 'out', 'force', 'Great', 'care', 'been', 'taken', 'fine-tune', 'everything', 'even', 'Styx', 'mainstays', 'example', 'Miss', 'America', 'back', 'usually-absent', 'instrumental', 'intro', '.Tommy', 'Shaw', 'miracle', 'nature', 'singing', 'playing', 'as', 'much', 'prowess', 'ever', 'Sing', 'Day', 'world', 'Drummer', 'extraordinaire', 'Todd', 'Sucherman', 'exciting', 'fireworks', 'read', 'interview', 'affection', 'albums', 'youth', 'made', 'project', 'particular', 'labor', 'love', 'technical', 'flair', 'magic', 'own.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'best', 'sounding', 'numbers', 'turn', 'out', 'be', ""'m"", 'Okay', 'Queen', 'Spades', 'Pieces', 'Eight', 'penned', 'originally', 'sung', 'Dennis', 'DeYoung', 'Keyboardist/vocalist', 'Lawence', 'Gowan', 'really', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'keyboard', 'voices', 'understand', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'replicate', 'equipment', '30', 'years', 'after-the-fact', 'come', 'pretty', 'darn', 'close', 'original', 'tones.The', 'only', 'weakness', 'notice', 'performance', 'strain', 'James', 'Young', 'voice', 'couple', 'songs', 'not', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'night', 'usually', 'outstanding.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'band', 'ever', 'sounded', 'better', 'guys', 'are', 'total', 'pros', 'joy', 'enthusiasm', 'infectious.The', 'video', 'pristine', 'skillfully', 'edited', 'definitely', 'feel', 'up-close', 'catching', 'special', 'moments', 'audio', 'been', 'masterfully', 'mixed', 'band', 'very-long-time', 'Styx', 'engineer', 'Gary', 'Loizzo', '[', 'side', 'note', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'track', 'lot', 'more', 'low-end', 'punch', 'lossless', 'dts-HD', 'track', 'least', 'system', 'sound', 'dts-HD', 'more', 'discreet', 'clear', 'listening', 'enjoyment', 'powerhouse', 'drum', 'bass', 'sound', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'track', 'ticket', ']', 'Included', 'disc', 'documentary', 'where', 'members', 'Styx', 'crew', 'walk', 'staging', 'execution', 'show', 'hobby', 'guitarist', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'bands', 'found', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'kids', 'did', 'well.If', '1977-78', 'era', 'Styx', 'simply', 'put', 'DVD', 'ROCKS', 'fans', 'refuse', 'enjoy', 'Styx', 'sans', 'Dennis', 'DeYoung', 'nothing', 'else', 'principle', 'obviously', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'own', 'everyone', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'hesitation', 'Pay', 'price', 'get', 'tickets', 'show', 'play', 'LOUD']",Styx: The Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight

And they TRY hard by acting as if nothing has changed.  It has.I think the reason why some (ex) Styx fans dislike this product and other product like it (re-generation, countless live albums, etc) is that for a band claiming they want to move on, they are doing anything but.  You can't compare ""new-Styx"" to a band that lost a ""non-key"" member, a member who died or left for health issues, or a member who left a band voluntarily.  This is a band that is re-recording classic songs made when ""key member"" Dennis was in the band, and acting as if Dennis was not important and/or never existed.  NONE of the other bands bass boy mentions do this, and/or to this extent.  No other band has this much DISRESPECT for a former KEY, founding member.An equivalent to the way this band acts would be if Gilmour Mason and Wright FIRED Waters and hired a singer and bass player who sounds like him, removed all mention of Waters from the band's website, referring to him only as their former bass player, bring in another keyboard player after Wright died, call the band Pink Floyd, take to the road and perform the Wall live!  Then release a DVD Pink Floyd the Wall live.  All over Water's objections and/or desire to be in the band!If a band wants to move on after a key member voluntarily leaves, I'm fine with that.  But MOVE ON.  Such as Black Sabbath did with Dio, or Van Halen did when they got Sammy Hagar.  Did they re-record a live version of the Paranoid album or the 1984 album with 40% of the band that originally recorded them?  No!What's the point of this anyway?  This isn't a new approach to these albums, it doesn't offer anything new or better than the originals.  I'll tell you- it's to redo them without Dennis, and like everything else this band does these days, an attempt to convince people and themselves that Dennis didn't matter.  All for JY and Shaw's egos, I imagine.I (and maybe some other fans) could possibly accept this band as Styx if A) Dennis stated he no longer wanted to be in the band  B) They acknowledge the huge impact Dennis had, but state they wish to continue making music C) they create some decent new music and D) stop trying to re-write history with crap like this.  Since this is not the case (Dennis WANTS to be in the band) then I (and many others) cannot support the band without him.  It's that simple.  It doesn't matter how long it's been since they FIRED Dennis, I will never support this band again, until they get him back, especially with releases like this.So again, I agree with David- this angers me.  This is a slap in the face to Dennis and all of his fans, which means many (former) Styx fans.  It's disrespectful and egotistical.  This is beyond a band trying to move on because a member (voluntarily) left, this is childish egotistical games meant to hurt a former founding KEY member that they FIRED.  Don't think they don't know how Dennis will feel about this- they don't care.  And don't think the band did this because fans wanted it- they don't, and the band doesn't care.  JY & Tommy Shaw do not care about Dennis or their fans, they care about themselves and feeding their egos, and attempting to continue the ""illusion"" that this is Styx.  It isn't.  Don't be fooled, or support it, or Tommy's and JYs childish games.",2,Modern-day Styx gets a bad rap- FOR GOOD REASONS,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,3393,"['agree', 'David', ""n't"", 'Styx', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'band', 'say', 'are', 'TRY', 'hard', 'acting', 'nothing', 'changed', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'ex', 'Styx', 'fans', 'dislike', 'product', 'other', 'product', 're-generation', 'countless', 'live', 'albums', 'etc', 'band', 'claiming', 'want', 'move', 'are', 'doing', 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'new-Styx', 'band', 'lost', 'non-key', 'member', 'member', 'who', 'died', 'left', 'health', 'issues', 'member', 'who', 'left', 'band', 'voluntarily', 'band', 're-recording', 'classic', 'songs', 'made', 'when', 'key', 'member', 'Dennis', 'was', 'band', 'acting', 'Dennis', 'was', 'not', 'important', 'and/or', 'never', 'existed', 'NONE', 'other', 'bands', 'bass', 'boy', 'mentions', 'do', 'extent', 'other', 'band', 'much', 'DISRESPECT', 'former', 'KEY', 'founding', 'member.An', 'equivalent', 'way', 'band', 'would', 'be', 'Gilmour', 'Mason', 'Wright', 'FIRED', 'Waters', 'hired', 'singer', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'removed', 'mention', 'Waters', 'band', 'website', 'referring', 'only', 'former', 'bass', 'player', 'bring', 'keyboard', 'player', 'Wright', 'died', 'call', 'band', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'take', 'road', 'perform', 'Wall', 'live', 'Then', 'release', 'DVD', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Wall', 'live', 'Water', 'objections', 'and/or', 'desire', 'be', 'band', 'band', 'move', 'key', 'member', 'voluntarily', ""'m"", 'fine', 'MOVE', 'ON', 'Such', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'did', 'Dio', 'Van', 'Halen', 'did', 'when', 'got', 'Sammy', 'Hagar', 'Did', 're-record', 'live', 'version', 'Paranoid', 'album', '1984', 'album', '40', '%', 'band', 'originally', 'recorded', 'No', 'What', 'point', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'new', 'approach', 'albums', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'better', 'originals', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'you-', 'redo', 'Dennis', 'everything', 'else', 'band', 'days', 'attempt', 'convince', 'people', 'Dennis', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'JY', 'Shaw', 'egos', 'imagine.I', 'maybe', 'other', 'fans', 'could', 'possibly', 'accept', 'band', 'Styx', 'A', 'Dennis', 'stated', 'no', 'longer', 'wanted', 'be', 'band', 'B', 'acknowledge', 'huge', 'impact', 'Dennis', 'had', 'state', 'wish', 'continue', 'making', 'music', 'C', 'create', 'decent', 'new', 'music', 'D', 'stop', 'trying', 're-write', 'history', 'crap', 'not', 'case', 'Dennis', 'WANTS', 'be', 'band', 'then', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'support', 'band', 'simple', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'FIRED', 'Dennis', 'will', 'never', 'support', 'band', 'again', 'get', 'back', 'especially', 'releases', 'this.So', 'again', 'agree', 'David-', 'angers', 'slap', 'face', 'Dennis', 'fans', 'many', 'former', 'Styx', 'fans', 'disrespectful', 'egotistical', 'band', 'trying', 'move', 'member', 'voluntarily', 'left', 'childish', 'egotistical', 'games', 'meant', 'hurt', 'former', 'founding', 'KEY', 'member', 'FIRED', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Dennis', 'will', 'feel', 'this-', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'band', 'did', 'fans', 'wanted', 'it-', 'do', ""n't"", 'band', ""n't"", 'care', 'JY', 'Tommy', 'Shaw', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Dennis', 'fans', 'care', 'feeding', 'egos', 'attempting', 'continue', 'illusion', 'Styx', ""n't"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'support', 'Tommy', 'JYs', 'childish', 'games']",Styx: The Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight

The real truth here is that the original band didn't put out a DVD of these two albums live so I am GRATEFUL for the efforts of the current band to celebrate their love of all that is STYX. I just saw Styx in concert last week in the Seattle area and they ARE NOT a bunch of hired musicians imitating Styx. They are great musicians who honor the past by performing it even better than the past band did....no kidding...the energy on stage is BETTER than ever! That's quite something for musicians who are not young in any way. It can be argued that the singing talent of the individuals or the band in total doesn't better the past but it is truly a shame that people can't just appreciate it for what it is and resist the tempatation to compare. Why not be just honestly grateful for a band that does Styx songs SO close to the originals....I refuse to understand the haters. I saw their Improv on Ice accompaniment of the ice skaters as they improvised their ice skating routines. Another honor!! The haters are so busy crying that Dennis De Young isn't part of the band that they CAN""T SEE that the music is so awesome and artistic in its musicality....to be chosen to accompany ice skaters is such a great honor for the band that I love. I saw Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" live with Roger Waters last year and I didn't hear ONE person complaining that it wasn't the ""original band."" We were there to see a SHOW and what a SHOW it was.

Excellent picture and sound.The show itself causes a minimal one star deduction.Some of the production on the video screen behind the band is awful.  To give one specific: During the song &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; the screen is displaying some sort of circus montage.  If the song were related to scary clowns this would make sense.  Even allowing for concerns over copyright, etc., there must be a thousand other better choices.  Anyway, much of what's going on behind the band during the show is somewhere between distracting and stupid.One more reason for the one star deduction: I will never understand what the value of the spinning - play behind my back - keyboard is.  It only makes me miss Dennis more.  &#34;Lawrence&#34; is an excellent musician - but hard to watch.  Dennis can never be forgotten, but if &#34;Lawrence&#34; would show some integrity, many people would not think so much about the missing Dennis.And Todd... wow.  Todd's a brilliant drummer and manages to give you Panozzo where it's needed while still putting his own stamp on the performance.Ricky Phillips is outstanding on bass and a solid Styx man.JY still amazes on guitar.Tommy Shaw has not only maintained his art, he's exceeded it.  Tommy is better than ever.  The precision and clarity of his vocals amaze me.  If I could, I'd thank him personally for the version of Man in the Wilderness found on this blu-ray.

The guy taking DDY place does not sing as well, but isn't as dramatic (a plus in my mind). The music is great.

1514783,A1MMWID822EN70,B006EMSO74,Rock Yours,"[4, 7]","Another live release from a band that looks like they are going to play music forever. Now they have a steady line up, the same as the previous DVD release, with the contemporary youth orchestra of Cleveland. This time, there is no orchestra. The band played their 2 most popular albums of the late 70's : ""The Grand Illusion"" and ""Piece of Eight"", in their entirety.Shot in high definition with 11 cameras at the Orpheum Theater in Memphis, this DVD offers a nice picture quality and a DTS-HD sound that give you what your looking for when you want surround sound. The stage settings is interesting with a giant back screen and a nice light show as well. On this screen, the band decided to show someone using a turntable to play the music of those 2 albums, like it was LP with side one and two.As far as the performance goes, there is not much wrong with this band that got a lot of experience over the years, knowing how to make this show a success. The music of Styx while not always interesting in their later days, was better in their earlier days. To take the decision to play the 2 most popular albums, was not a big risk, but i can't say i was pleased with the quality of the songs on both albums, especially with ""Piece of Eight"", who contains some more ordinary songs.The highlights songs were the well known ""Come Sail Away"" , ""Castle Walls"" for the great instrumental part, and ""Lords of the Ring"" for his symphonic approach. If you like pop music with a symphonic touches, nice vocal harmonies and a nice guitar and keyboard interplay, you will enjoy most of the material here, but for someone who want hear some pure progressive rock music, this is not for you. Myself i am in the middle of both categories, i was a little bit disappointed by some of the songs on ""Piece of Eight"" and would have prefer hear some others songs from the band on others albums, like ""Suite Madame Blue"", but it was not possible here, with the concept of the show.This is a nice addition for any Styx fans, or those who have enjoyed a lot these two albums.

I believe I saw them in 1979 at the Michigan State Fair as a free show, simply because I paid for admission to the State Fair itself.During this era of their successful career, I was already growing tired of them. I think I shared a couple of beers backstage with Tommy Shaw even though I was just there because some girl I was dating wanted to go to the State Fair and get out of the house and just get out and party with some guy who had a remote interest in the Styx ""Equinox"" album.Anyway, this concert really offers a time capsule that really reflects how long ago 34 years was from today. I can see their point of view of wanting to keep their two classic albums alive to audiences that remember when these two albums were the best selling albums of Styx.I still prefer ""Equinox"" over these two albums, and I'm glad that they didn't play ""Babe"" or ""Mr. Roboto"" because I'd really like to forget that era of Styx.My kids wouldn't get into this concert, I don't think.  Maybe a few people my age.  Maybe friends of mine back in Michigan, but certainly no one I know here in California.I'll watch this Blu-ray disc again, only if a friend of mine stops by and sees it in my collection. I wouldn't watch this one alone again. This is a concert to be shared by someone who equally dwells on the past. So, let's see what happens in the next 30 years or so.
