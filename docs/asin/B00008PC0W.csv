Burchfield,"[2, 4]","If a person wants some pretty good TV science fiction, the Stargate series has always been a good choice with the third season being no exception.The alien worlds SG-1 visits each week do have a Canadian look to them that can't be helped, that's where it's filmed, but for action adventure I think you'll find it to be really pretty good.There's a wide variety of stories for you to choose from, something will be good to anyone who likes scifi with some gunplay. I personally liked #1 Into the Fire, #2 Seth, #4 Point of View,#12 Foothold,#15 A Hundred Days, #17 New Ground. Most of the others had their good points too, how many series are that strong in quality?The featurettes are done in a different style with this  box set with Don Davis and/or Teryl Rothery in character on the SG-1 set speaking to the camera as if the viewer is someone invited to look over some computer file or do some research, when the segment is done they invite you to leave.

746175,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00008PC0W,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[12, 13]","Many people believe that subsequent seasons of Stargate: SG1 get progressively better.  So far, no arguement from me.  Season 1 was good, 2 was better, and this has been the best so far.  Col. Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), and his SG1 team of the now Maj. Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) continued their adventures through the Stargate to various old and new planets.  The team, as well as the SGC in general, were tested in many more ways than ever thought possible.  The team went to &quot;Hell&quot; in order to save Sam's dad, who is still a member of the Tok'Ra resistance, Daniel suffered a major loss, and O'Neill was blended, albeit briefly, with a Goa'uld.One of the reasons that I personally liked this year was that many of last year's conflicts were resolved (Lenea, Destroyer of Worlds), which made room for new plotlines (the Replicators), as well as continuing old ones (the search for the Harsesis child).  Also, this season revitalized a Season 1 plotline that had been falsely ended in Season 2.This is also the season when SG1 truly realizes that they truly have allies in their fight against the Goa'uld; the Asgard helped form a treaty between Earth and the Goa'uld (though it is not likely to be followed by either party due to some of the clauses), the Tok'Ra continue to offer their assistance and wisdom, the Nox have begun to reestablish contact with the SGC, and the Tollan, who are also human, now have reason to truly dislike the parasitic alien race.  Speaking of which, I really liked the episode &quot;Pretense&quot;, because it gave large roles to the Tollan and Liah, who is of the Nox.  I mean, if the Asgard had made an appearance in the episode, then it would have really been a party.Other good episodes include &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, &quot;Fair Game&quot;, &quot;Legacy&quot;, &quot;Learning Curve&quot;, &quot;Point of View&quot;, &quot;Past and Present&quot;, &quot;Jolinar's Memories&quot;, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, &quot;Foothold&quot;, &quot;Urgo&quot;, &quot;Shades of Grey&quot;, &quot;New Ground&quot;, and &quot;Nemesis&quot;.

The long run of the show allowed for a great deal of character and story line development that laid the foundation for the long success of the show and the franchise.  Season 3 begins to finish off the building of the foundation and starts to work into the next layer in which the next couple of seasons take us into the full blown depth of the many story lines and ongoing character story lines that aren't shown in every episode but are continually being built on to make the show good on so many levels and allowed it to have such a good long run.  All the seasons are important until things start to wind up toward the end, but even then there is closure being brought to stories that started years earlier.

I suggest watching from season 8 on by alternating with Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis as they both were on air at the same time for those 3 years and both very good.  Cancelling Stargate SG-1 when they did was a mistake, they should have given it a couple more years.  However, Stargate Atlantis did a good job of continuing the brand.  They cancelled Stargate Atlantis after 5 total years, 2 years after cancelling stargate sg-1.  Another mistake.  They followed this directly up with 2 years of stargate universe.  So there were 16 years of stargate in a row in one form or another.  Stargate Universe, however, did not follow the light tone of the series.  Lacked the same humor and optimism.  The style was too different and that was a mistake.  They tried to make it like Battlestar Galactica.  I watched the entire Battlestar Galactica series twice -- every show.  Enjoyed it; but it was a mistake to try to make Stargate like it.  They were different shows, different style, and that was a mistake.  ANyway, this is a great series and I suggest watching from the start.The stargate series are all free on amazon prime and are totally worth singing up for it.

The latest is Season 3.  I do hope they speed up the release of the other seasons since customer service at Amazon said it was one of the top sellers.  I use to be a total Star Trek Fan until it got to be more like a Broadway Play with a lot of Psychological drama since I think most of the actors really wanted to do that.  Meanwile, as one can see by the customer ratings, StarGate took off with its series based in our time and actually tied to a much debated question----who built the pyrmids with such total accurancy.  To me, a long time Sci-Fi Fan, it just soared past Star Trek.  Based on some reasonalbe assumptions as played by Smanath Carter, much sound physics is discussed relating to worm holes as we understand them now and travel across the Galaxy using that mode of transportation.  The US Air Force(for real)has been involved in advising them as the series stars Air Force people back on Earth which has made it look very real.  The Gouls, constantly out to do us in have been beat at every turn by our old earth weapons and US Air Foprce people using good judgement.  Just about all the other series you see involve some future army or current one now, and this series does justice to our Air Force today.  I think it will serve a great way to get younger people in the Air Force.  In one scene, a US General actually plays a short role doing a good job.  In this series, we cooperate with other nations such as the Russians who are protrayed well as being Courage driven---not unlike our current space program.  In some shows they have used the Shuttle and did not strech what the thing does. Fox sold it to the Sci-Fi Channel I think not realizing how it would take off as we travel the do Galaxatic travel in the hear and now.  The even took the chance of running into a middle ages developed world of Christians who the Gould has messed up only to bring them back to a Christian.  When is the last time you remember a Battle on Star Treak----well on Star Gate, about every third show they battle to Gouls who have technology far past us and we always end up getting out of the situation or using their technology against them.  The &quot;Theme&quot; of the show is &quot;freedom for all&quot; and they make that the Prime Directive of &quot;Star Gate&quot;.  If there were not some strong actors left of Star Trek, it would already be gone.  Wake up my old friend Star Trek and watch some Star Gate.

Season 3 really kicks up the excitement which leads to a even better fourth and fifth seasons of one of the best sci-fi shows around.This entire season is full of fantastic and memorable episodes that will have hungry for more, most if not all episodes are far from being dull or repetitive, having a great plot and story arch helps as well. The team finds themselves in some new situations such as having the enemy on their doorstep, being held captive by a bounty hunter, and alternate versions of themselves as well as a trip to the planet ""Hell"". The second half of the season gets even better with the return of an old enemy, an alien foothold situation, a trial of a friend, a possible powerful new ally capable of spiritual powers, a Crystal Skull and aliens (similar to the plot of Indiana Jones 4), and the season ends with the introduction of a powerful new threat even worse than the previous threat of the Goa'uld.The only real downside to this DVD set is the lack of any good special features. This set as well as the sets for Seasons 1 and 2 contain no commentaries or behind-the-scenes videos with the cast and crew, just documentaries of the first five seasons of SG1.Stargate SG-1 Season 4  (Thinpak)and on all contain commentaries and superb special features, I wonder why these were not re-released with some.I highly recommend this to any SG1 fan, regardless of the lack of special features.

746223,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00008PC0W,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[4, 5]","Season 3 was another good season for the Stargate cast and crew. They continue to have interesting episodes and complex plot lines that hold the interest. Some things are a bit different. Daniel seems strangely subdued, especially in the early episodes. Other things remain the same. Virtually every alien in the known universe speaks North American English. That's a harder mental hurdle for me than the stargates themselves. Still, it is a fun series.Episode synopses appear below:Into the Fire - As the season 2 cliffhanger ended, the SG1 team had been captured and taken prisoner by Hathor. She is involved in a plot to take power among the ghouls. SG command gets word of this through the Tok'ra. Naturally, a rescue expedition is mounted they have their share of minor glitches and such. This isn't a bad episode but I expected something a bit more exciting for the season opener and cliffhanger resolver.Seth - This one is a bit better. The Tok'ra come through with information that a ghoul may be in hiding on earth. This is not a recent development. The ghoul in question is none other than the ancient Egyptian god, Seth. It seems that he has been hiding on earth for millennia from both Ra and the Tok'ra. He has kept himself amused by being a cult leader. His methods of mind control are much more effective than our homegrown varieties. In his current incarnation, he is a cult leader reminiscent of David Koresh of Waco infamy. The SG1 team is tasked to go in and root him out of his compound. This is made more difficult in that they get into a turf battle with the ATF which is about ready to go charging in.Fair Game - During a recognition ceremony in which Capt. Clark was becoming Maj. Clark, Col. O'Neill mysteriously disappears. He has been transported to an Asgard ship to meet Thor who is the bearer of bad tidings. Earth's successful eradication of Hathor has piqued ghoul sensitivities and earth is viewed as a bigger threat now. The Asgard offer their help but there is a problem. Their fleets are otherwise occupied at the moment. The best they can offer is to help to broker a treaty. Basically, they intend to use the ghoul fear of the Asgard to run a bluff. With that in mind, three ghoul envoys are accepted on earth to begin negotiations. They start out poorly and deteriorate from there since the ghouls seem to be holding all the cards. All is not as it seems, however. There is enough intrigue among the various ghoul factions to delay things. The question is whether there is enough to gain some real leverage.Legacy - While on an investigation, the SG1 team finds a crypt full of dead, mummified ghouls. Teal'c recognizes the mummies as part of a minor ghoul faction but everyone figures they are safely dead. The only thing out of the ordinary is that Daniel is acting strange. That doesn't seem too out of the ordinary since he has not seemed himself for the end of last season and this season so far. He really starts acting crazy, seeing things, hearing voices and then even acts violently. Everyone thinks he has lost his mind. He has but the curse of the mummy is not what it seems. Things get more difficult to understand when Daniel starts to clear up and Teal'c starts dying. They have stumbled onto a biological weapon designed to kill ghouls; it makes normal humans crazy.Learning Curve - The SG team finds an advanced world and, better yet, the inhabitants of that world are eager to trade knowledge. What seems strange, however, is that all of the ones doing the learning on the new world are just children. They are genius children but children just the same. The adults are smart, but they do not seem nearly as bright. Slowly, the SG1 team learns that the children are inhabited by nanites which greatly increase their abilities. There is a terrible price, however, the children undergo a strange ceremony in which their knowledge is transferred to the rest of the community by way of these same nanites. The process leaves them as mere shells of their former selves. The Earth people are horrified at what amounts to child sacrifice. They are even more horrified when one of the visiting ""scholars"" refuses all offers of asylum. Both sides have a lot to learn in this exchange.Point of View - You may recall that in an episode last season, Daniel Jackson found an alien mirror that was actually a portal to an alternate reality. In this episode, a strange Samantha Clark shows up outside a secure facility in the company of a Maj. Kowalski, who was killed in the first season. This duo is from an alternate timeline. In theirs, she never joined the military, Kowalski was never killed, Col. Is married to her but was killed defending the SG facility from a Ghoul invasion fleet and the Earth has just been overrun. The team from our earth concoct a plan to try and help by contacting the Asgard, a race that humanity has not encountered in that reality. In a fair episode made better by Clark's luxuriously long hair.Deadman's Switch - While investigating a new planet, the SG1 team is captured by a ""bounty hunter"". He seems human but is prevented by his biology from being a ghoul host. He is also ruthless and in the service of a ghoul. He is good at what he does so he trades his services as a hunter to them. It turns out that while the SG1 team is fairly valuable, he has a bigger quarry in mind. He uses the team to capture a fleeing Tok'ra. He is ruthless but he has the glimmerings of some personal honor. The question is whether the team can parlay that into active resistance.Demons - The SG1 team arrives on a planet with a village transported out of the dark ages of Europe. The place gets some regular stargate traffic from an Unas who poses as a demon of Satan and demands the regular sacrifice of a few victims to serve as hosts. The SG1 team agrees to help out and ""destroy"" the demon. This riles up the local religious authority who sees the proposal as both a threat to his power base and a possible way to further antagonize the demons. The village canon possesses a ring with some advanced technology and manages to subdue the team. They are chosen as the next sacrifices.Rules of Engagement - The SG1 team stumbles into a battle on a planet between a Stargate team and a bunch of Jaffars. When SG1 tries to help the other stargate team, that team turns on them and attacks with weapons that look real but which are actually designed to stun. The team has stumbled onto a plot by Apothis. He has a bunch of humans being trained as infiltrators and which look just like regular stargate troops. They are a bunch of young men fanatically training to serve Apothis whom they regard as a god. The SG1 team has one thing going for them. The locals believe that they have been sent by Apothis. Convincing them that Apothis is dead, however, will prove difficult.Forever in a Day - This episode opens up a whole new story line. It opens with the SG1 team making a raid to free some prisoners from Abydos. While the operation is underway, Daniel catches sight of his wife who was captured by the ghouls and used as a host in the pilot. He has been searching for her ever since. He runs to her and her ghoul parasite reacts as expected; she tries to kill him. Teal'c saves the day at the last minute but only by killing her. This is something that Daniel cannot forgive, even though it saved his own life. Since his only reason to join the Stargate Command was to find his wife, he resigns. He is plagued, however, with vague memories and seemingly with a communication from beyond the grave from his dead wife. He must find the child sired upon his wife by the ghouls. It may well have the information that will save humanity.Past and Present - The SG1 team investigates a new gate and finds it in the basement of a fairly advanced planet. It is roughly comparable to the mid 20th century on earth. The natives a friendly but there are a few oddities. Everyone seems fairly young, there are no elderly, there are no children, everyone has amnesia after a point about a year in the past. The team tries to help and comes up with some startling information with the help of an exceptionally bright woman from the planet. These people are ""the old people"". Someone had been working on a fountain of youth drug and there were some unintended consequences. Furthermore, the nice young lady helping them is none other than ""the Destroyer of Worlds"" met last season.Jolinar's Memories - The Tok'ra come through with information that Maj. Clark's father has been captured. The ghoul who has captured him is a real baddie who styles himself after Satan of Earth. He even has a hell planet he built just for eternal torment and damnation. The Tok'ra and the SG Command decide to mount a rescue operation for one main reason. Her father is expected to have information of an imminent threat. Saving Dad is just to be the icing on the cake. They should be helped by the fat that Jolinar, the Tok'ra who once inhabited the Major, is the only person known to have escaped hell. Since she carries around bits and pieces of those memories, they expect to be able to use them to help themselves escape. Unfortunately, those memories are spotty at best. What really helped was an inside agent. That inside agent got killed but the replacement is most unexpected and bad. With that we get the cliffhanger.The Devil You Know - The previous episode ended with the team stranded on Hell and the realization that Apothis lives. This one picks up with that sad scenario. Apothis has a plan to gain his freedom, kill Satan and extract his vengeance from the SG1 team. He plans to achieve the first two by torturing the team for information and using that information to barter himself into Satan's proximity, where he plans to kill him. Meanwhile, Teal'c has fled back to let the Tok'ra know what is happening. They come up with their own plan to kill Satan by destroying the moon, Hell. Its too bad that the SG1 team has to go down at the same time...but Teal'c has other plans.Foothold - This was a creepy one. The SG1 team returns home and heads for some routine medical checks. The people at SG Command seem a little abrupt but, other than that, everything seems normal until they are given injections. The injections knock them all out. Teal'c seems to have some degree of immunity and Maj. Carter a lesser degree. This appears to be due to his parasite and the after effects of her having a parasite. They come to consciousness and realize that a previously unknown alien race has managed to get a foothold in SG Command. Worse, they seem to have the technology to assume the shapes of known humans and impersonate them. In order to get themselves out of this one, they are going to have to trust some people who have been very unworthy of trust in the past.Pretense - Stargate command receives word from the Tollan that they have an old comrade in custody. That would be the young man who befriended O'Neill as far back as the movie and who was taken as a ghoul host in the pilot. Members of the SG1 team are chosen to serve as advocates for the human host. At issue is whether the possessing ghoul will be forcibly removed. According to Tollan law, both sides must be represented. Naturally, the SG1 team agrees to help. They are a bit miffed, however, when they learn that all of their armaments have been disabled. They are assured that the ghoul armaments have likewise been disabled. The SG1 team is sure that they are up to something sneaky, however. They find evidence that the ghouls are planning on disabling the planetary defense system of the Tollan. The Tollan, in their arrogance, refuse to believe it. They are sure that their technology will see them through. That arrogance will have a fearful price.Urgo - The episode opens as the team is about to leave for a new destination. They step through the gate and end up arriving back at Stargate Command. They think they have just left. IN actuality, they have been gone for over 15 hours. They have no memory of this. They are ordered to report to the infirmary but are seemingly fine except for voracious appetites. Something else is going on though. They start to hear voices in their heads and then even start to see the source of the voice. They see Urgo. Deeper examination reveals that each of the team has had some sort of alien device put in their heads. It is an artificial intelligence and seems to be designed by a timid race to gather information and experiences. It is otherwise benign but very annoying. It also likes to eat pie. Urgo is played by Dom DeLouise who does a wonderful comedic job. Every Sci-Fi series needs a light comedy episode from time to time. They are generally very good. This one is.A Hundred Days - The SG1 team finds a planet with a goodly supply of Naquida, the mineral used by much of the high tech encountered throughout the galaxy. The team is working on negotiating a deal for a mining concession when work stops so everyone can view the annual meteor shower. It is so impressive that the team becomes worried and Maj. Carter does some further investigation. They are due for a really bad meteor shower. It could be of ""dinosaur killer"" proportions. The team tries to get the locals to evacuate back to earth until after the shower is over. Some go and others are stubborn. Col. O'Neill runs off to try and find the local leader's son. While he is gone, the stargate is smashed and the Col is stranded on the planet. He is stuck there for a very long time while those back home try to mount a rescue mission.Shades of Gray - Col. O'Neill manages to really screw up a diplomatic mission to the Tollan. He does this by insulting their leaders and stealing a piece of their technology. On his return to Earth, he also manages to hack off the general and generally be abusive to everyone he speaks with. When the Tollan come through with blood in their eye over the theft, he is forced into early retirement. His big disagreement with everyone is that they are not willing to use every tool at their disposal, including theft, to get the technology to defend Earth. After rotting in retirement for a while, he gets his opportunity to do things his way when he is contacted by unsavory types. His agenda is not all it seems.New Ground - The SG1 team visits a new planet and stumbles into the middle of a religious civil war. One faction, that which captures the team, believes that life originated on that planet and that they were all created by a benevolent god. The opposing faction claims that humans were first brought to the planet as slaves by an alien race and using the great circle. The presence of the SG1 team threatens to overturn the religious beliefs of the first side and that side's military commander is determined to prevent the knowledge from leaking. He does not really believe it himself and thinks that the entire episode is nothing more than a trick by the opposing force. Teal'c is the one member of the team not captured. He is only blinded and it is up to him and a hapless archeologist to save the day.Maternal Instinct - An old comrade comes through the gate at SGC with bad news. Chulac has been attacked by Apothis and practically destroyed. It seems that he was searching for the child he sired on Daniel's wife and which has all the knowledge of the ghouls. The team comes up with a clue for where the child might actually be and sets out to rescue him. They are following an old Jaffar legend about a place the ghouls are afraid to venture. They find the place and, in it, a strange temple that seems as if it is Buddhist. Upon entering, they are greeted by a ""monk"" who plays mindgames with them. Daniel is the only one clever enough to pass the tests but taking the child might not be the best thing.Crystal Skull - A probe of a new planet reveals a pyramid like those of the Maya but on a vastly greater scale. It also reveals a crystal skull on a pedestal like the one found in Belize. It just so happens that Daniel's uncle was the one who found the original crystal skull. He claimed to have met aliens and was regarded as a crazy quack for ever afterwards. This time, the team goes out to investigate and trigger a strange phenomenon when Daniel touches the skull. Teal'c zaps the thing with his zapper and Daniel disappears. No one can see him but he can see and hear everyone else. The only hope of finding Daniel again rests with getting information out of his old uncle whom everyone considers to be crazy.Nemesis - Just as the team is about to take a little vacation, Col. O'Neill is abducted by Thor and transported to his ship. There he is in for a surprise. The ship is literally crawling with little mechanical spider-like things. Worse, Thor is literally on his deathbed. The spiders are an enemy of Thor's civilization known as Replicators. They basically consume and replicate. They are apparently the result of some experiment gone wrong. Thor did not mean to lead them to Earth. When they captured the ship, they got the navigational data to get there. Now they pose a threat to earth and is seems as if a suicide mission of SG1's part is the only thing that can save the earth. Self Destructing the ship only seems to solve the problem. Its another end of season cliffhanger.",4,The Originality Continues,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,17281,"['Season', '3', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'Stargate', 'cast', 'crew', 'continue', 'have',

And that Earth is under direct threat from the false Gods, the Goa'uld.  No other series does this to the extent that SG-1 does.  Sure, Star Trek had the Borg and Dominion threats, and X-Files had its alien phenomenon of the week, but in SG-1 there is always a constant threat from at least one or more Goa'uld System Lords.In Season 3, of which I'm not all that familiar with, the main threat is from a Goa'uld System Lord known as Sokar which is basically Satan re-incarnated.  Sokar's first appearance came in Season 2's episode ""The Serpent's Song"" in which we learn that our old Goa'uld enemy, Apophis, is being sought out by Sokar.  Sokar wishes to torture and finally kill Apophis.From what I've read about Season 3 on other message boards, it is considered to be one of SG-1's best seasons.  That must be saying something because I thought Season 2 was great.  Like I said above, I'm not all that familiar with Season 3, because I missed it in syndication, but I'm a little more familiar with Season 4.  However by late June, I'll be more than familiar with Season 3 as it finds a place on my shelf next to my other two season sets of  Stargate SG-1.So like I and others have said, if you like good writing, and excellent character development, and mega cool, but realistic special effects in a sci-fi series, be sure to pick up Stargate SG-1 Season 3 on DVD.

THE BEST TV series ever IMHO.  The special effects, the action, the interaction between the characters, the story lines (most filled with action but all filled with imagination and the great humor throughout) make all the Stargate SG1 seasons top notch.  Richard Dean Anderson - is simply the best from all the little nuances of his facial expressions to the tone and volume of his voice at just the right times.  I hope he can now give time back to his acting career even though in his sixties - he is still a fantastic actor who needs to be on the screen.

746263,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00008PC0W,Robert Moore,"[0, 1]","Season Three of STARGATE SG-1 continued the excellent precedent established in Season Three by each week continuing the story of Stargate Command's exploration of the universe via wormholes created by an ancient system of stargates.  I have for several years been especially interested in the way that post-HILL STREET BLUES television shows negotiate issues concerning narrative (that being the first non-soap to be structured around ongoing story arcs).  The approach that STARGATE takes in Season Three is fairly unique.  Most shows tend not to wrap up all narrative tension each week and frequently pick up in one episode what happened in the previous one.  Most episodes of STARGATE in Season Three begin with a relative ignorance of what happened in the previous episode and ends by resolving most of that week's narrative tension.  Contrast this with FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER or LOST where episodes frequently begin by referring to what happened in the previous week's episode.  Nonetheless, STARGATE does not resemble any other shows that resolve most narrative issues each week, in that most Season Three episodes refer to previous episodes.  Most shows employing the long narrative format deal with several threads in each episode.  STARGATE usually deals with one thread, but loves to pick up on stories from one or two previous episodes.  Season Three on the other hand featured very few episodes that were completely stand-alone.  I'm not aware of another show that so consistently in any one season used such a method.  Even in Season Two STARGATE tended to let episodes run over from week to week.What makes STARGATE so satisfying to watch is the way they keep picking up on previous episodes and bringing characters and races back for expansion of their story.  My lone complaint with the show is that it is not a character driven show.  By this I mean that the show does not primarily emphasize the way characters change over time, but the plot and story.  In this way it more closely resembles THE X-FILES than FARSCAPE or BUFFY.  Another way of putting it is that on STARGATE the characters exist more for the stories than the stories exist for the purpose of telling you about the characters.  My preference is for character development over plot, but that doesn't mean that I can't love both.  Sometimes you just need a good yarn, and STARGATE certainly provides that.The show does so many things well, but I wanted to mention just one.  One of the things I have been working on for a couple of writing projects is the way women have been portrayed on TV in the past two decades.  Maj. Samantha Carter has to be one of the most positive portrayals of a female character on all of television.  No matter what else female characters in ensemble casts are used far, they usually are used as eye candy or sex appeal.  Without implying that Amanda Tapping is unattractive, her presentation on the show is always as an enormously competent professional and the show avoids sexualizing her.  She is an attractive woman, but her physical assets are never emphasized on the show.  Even better, the show never stresses her gender.  We take so completely for granted Carter's competence that issues of her gender never emerge on the show.  And by having none of the characters on the show--except in a few patriarchal cultures they visit in their travels--treat her as anything other than a fellow professional of the highest competence, the show helps in patterning the thinking of countless fans.  I wonder how many 12-year-old boys and girls have had their thinking about gender subtly molded by this show.  In conjunction with a host of other shows that have emerged since the early 1990s, I can't help but hope and believe that in an age when there has been little political advancement of women, much progress has been made in thinking positively about women in all kinds of situations as a result of shows like this.Season Two may have had slightly stronger ongoing story arcs than Season Three, but this season was blessed with some truly excellent individual story arcs.  One in particular pleased me in that it starred an actor who I have often disliked in the past:  Dom DeLuise.  I had often wondered if Peter DeLuise, who has directed a huge number of episodes of STARGATE, was related to Dom and it turns out that he is his son.  Together father and son make this one of the funnier episodes on the show, and Peter even steps in briefly to portray his father when Dom, playing, Urgo, turned himself into a much younger man dressed in a uniform, asking if they prefer him looking like that.DARK ANGEL fans should take note of episode ""Pretense,"" in which there is a trial to determine whether the Goa'uld Klorel will be removed from Skaara's body.  Klorel is defended by the Goa'uld Zipacna, who is played by Kevin Durand.  DARK ANGEL fans may recognize the name but not the face, since Durand in heavy make up played Joshua, Max's dog boy friend, in Season Two of the series.All in all, this was another great season of one of TV's finest Sci-fi series.",5,Another great season for one of Sci-fi's best TV shows,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,5089,"['Season', 'Three', 'STARGATE', 'SG-1', 'continued', 'excellent',

It seemed deriviative and the writing was frequently weak. Given that it was the first season and the writers had yet to find their footing (a problem that dogged Star Trek: The Next Generation, Farscape, Babyon 5, Deep Space 9 and The Dead Zone as well). I decided to keep watching just in case it improved. It did. By the middle of the second season the characters were better written and the overall feel was that the producers knew where the series was going.By season 3 Sg-1 Began to hit its stride. Although the silly episodes (not in a good way--I'm referring to Spock's Brain silly here folks, i.e., incompetant) had given way to sharp writing, and some really strong performances particularly from Richard Dean Anderson.While this boxset could have more in the way of extras, it beats many of the other boxed sets simply because its affordably priced and well produced. The transfers vary from good to very good and the generaly sound quality is also strong. While there are still occasional clunkers mixed in with many of these gems, they are fewer and far between compared to season 1 and season 2.",4,Third time's the charm,1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,1161,"['was', ""n't"", 'much', 'fan', 'first', 'season', 'SG-1', 'seemed', 'deriviative', 'writing', 'was', 'frequently', 'weak', 'Given', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'writers', 'had', 'yet', 'find', 'footing', 'problem', 'dogged', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Farscape', 'Babyon', '5', 'Deep', 'Space', '9', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'as', 'well', 'decided', 'keep', 'watching', 'just', 'case', 'improved', 'did', 'middle', 'second', 'season', 'characters', 'were', 'better', 'written', 'overall', 'feel', 'was', 'producers', 'knew', 'where', 'series', 'was', 'going.By', 'season', '3', 'Sg-1', 'Began', 'hit', 'stride', 'silly', 'episodes', 'not', 'good', 'way', ""'m"", 'referring', 'Spock', 'Brain', 'silly', 'here', 'folks', 'i.e.', 'incompetant', 'had', 'given', 'way', 'sharp', 'writing', 'really', 'strong', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson.While', 'boxset', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'way', 'extras', 'beats', 'many', 'other', 'boxed', 'sets', 'simply', 'affordably', 'priced', 'well', 'produced', 'transfers', 'vary', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'generaly', 'sound', 'quality', 'also', 'strong', 'are', 'still', 'occasional', 'clunkers', 'mixed', 'many', 'gems', 'are', 'fewer', 'far', 'compared', 'season', '1', 'season', '2']",N/A
