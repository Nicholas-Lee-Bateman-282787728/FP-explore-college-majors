We have a number of them at our local zoo, right here in Stockholm. Kids love 'em. They are cute, cuddly and playful. In fact, they are more cool than brown bears. Of course, they are also extremely dangerous...If you hate wolverines, ""Chasing the Phantom"" is not for you. This is definitely a ""nerd"" show. Apart from a lot of wolverines (what else?), we get to meet a number of human enthusiasts with a perhaps somewhat unhealthy obsession with this particular animal. One of them, Steve Kroschel (who reminds me of the crazy guy from A-Team), even breeds wolverines at his ""wildlife center"". The center also spouts a moose?! The funniest part of the documentary is when Kroschel's ""tame"" wolverines attack his camera equipment! Meanwhile, two other wolverine-bitten explorers search the pristine wilderness of Montana's Glacier National Park for the elusive glutton. One of the boys admits that he wants to *be* a wolverine, and ""bite whomever he wants to bite"". Oookay...The most fascinating piece of info about the actual wolverines, is that the promiscuous male (who mates with several females) actually returns to all of ""his"" females, helping to rear the young. An interesting family arrangement, and apparently an unexpected one for scientists who until recently assumed that these animals were solitaires, with little or no meaningful interaction between different members of the species.Definitely a treat if you like out-sized mustelids, and the crazy folk who chase them.

I hadn't heard very much about wolverines before and had assumed that they were more plentiful then they really are.  I hadn't realized how difficult they are to capture on film or that their numbers are dwindling.  The documentary follows two different groups of naturalists documenting the movements of wolverines and a wildlife filmmaker raising wolverines in captivity on a 60 acre wildlife refuge in Alaska.  The documentary cuts between these three main stories while providing information about the wolverine itself.I found the documentary very informative and it's inspired me to seek out more information on these fascinating creatures.  My only complaint is the one I have with most episodes of Nature: it's too short!  It's so well done though that I can't bring myself to give it less than 5 stars.  If you're interested in animals and wildlife research, I urge you to check out this all too brief glimpse into one of nature's most elusive creatures.

They are rare and difficult to find and videotape.  The doc says it's related to the weasel.  I thought if it's a hostile beast that they would equate it with the Tasmanian devil, but they don't take that route.  Although it's just 30 pounds, a wolverine is willing to fight much larger beasts.  They eat bones of other animals.  The work started by saying a wolverine can climb to the top of a mountain in 90 minutes.  Like pandas, they are difficult to breed in captivity.  Unlike most animals, the fathers may be involved in raising the young.  Many arctic animals are white in order to blend in with the snow.  The work never explained why the wolverine was not also white, or least white during the winter.The work gives hope as it says that wolverines are being found in states that haven't hosted them in decades.  However, they end starkly by saying the animals depend on snowy mountains, so if global warming destroys snow, the animal may perish as well.This doc was an eye-opener.

1388537,A16GJQ27XTZLLE,B0047H7Q5O,"Rick Seals ""Transplanted OKie""","[1, 1]","Nature's Wolverine: Chasing The Phantom is a well presented, entertaining and educational show about the rarely seen but legendary Wolverine, perhaps the most mysterious and misunderstood creature from the frozen north.The episode is presented in beautiful 1080i HD which really does credit to the scenery, which was shot mostly in Alaska and in Montana's Glacier National Park. The audio quality is as good as the video, being presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. The disc comes in a standard plastic case as with most of the PBS Nature Blu-ray releases so there shouldn't be a worry of scratching the disc when you take it out. There are no extras to talk about but that is par for the course with most releases in this series.The information includes historical theories about wolverines, modern information from scientists in the field who track wolverines and study their habits, as well as the first person experiences of a scientist who has actually raised a pair of wolverine kits to adulthood. Indeed, the scenes where he is teaching the young wolverines and playing with them are a highlight.Anyone who loves weasels, as wolverines are in fact a kind of weasel, will love this show as will anyone who simply likes animals and nature. I guarantee that if you watch this you will learn a lot about these amazing creatures and their uncertain future in the age of global warming. It has cute factor and is entertaining and education factor too so I rate it as a great buy, especially as it is usually less than $20 on Amazon.",5,"""One touch of nature makes all the world kin."" - John Muir",1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,1536,"['Nature', 'Wolverine', 'Chasing', 'Phantom', 'well', 'presented', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'show', 'rarely', 'seen', 'legendary', 'Wolverine', 'perhaps', 'most', 'mysterious', 'misunderstood', 'creature', 'frozen', 'north.The', 'episode', 'presented', 'beautiful', '1080i', 'HD', 'really', 'credit', 'scenery', 'was', 'shot', 'mostly', 'Alaska', 'Montana', 'Glacier', 'National', 'Park', 'audio', 'quality', 'as', 'good', 'video', 'being', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'disc', 'standard', 'plastic', 'case', 'most', 'PBS', 'Nature', 'Blu-ray', 'so', 'there', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'worry', 'scratching', 'disc', 'when', 'take', 'out', 'are', 'extras', 'talk', 'par', 'course', 'most', 'releases', 'series.The', 'information', 'historical', 'theories', 'wolverines', 'modern', 'information', 'scientists', 'field', 'who', 'track', 'wolverines', 'study', 'habits', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'person', 'experiences', 'scientist', 'who', 'actually', 'raised', 'pair', 'wolverine', 'kits', 'adulthood', 'Indeed', 'scenes', 'where', 'teaching', 'young', 'wolverines', 'playing', 'are', 'highlight.Anyone', 'who', 'weasels', 'wolverines', 'are', 'fact', 'kind', 'weasel', 'will', 'love', 'show', 'will', 'anyone', 'who', 'simply', 'animals', 'nature', 'guarantee', 'watch', 'will', 'learn', 'lot', 'amazing', 'creatures', 'uncertain', 'future', 'age', 'global', 'warming', 'cute', 'factor', 'entertaining', 'education', 'factor', 'too', 'so', 'rate', 'great', 'buy', 'especially', 'usually', 'less', '20', 'Amazon']",Nature: Wolverine - Chasing the Phantom
