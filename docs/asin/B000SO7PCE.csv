1087209,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000SO7PCE,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[3, 4]","In my quest to develop a slightly stronger stomach - like my mother, who as a biology lab assistant could eat a sandwich from one hand while doing a dissection with the other - I have occasionally attempted to raise my gross-out threshold by watching one or anther of the CSI shows over dinner. Not much luck with that, I'm afraid, I remain as hopelessly lily-livered as always... while still enthralled by the science and the solving of intricate puzzles. Season Three of CSI: New York delivers all those qualities; uncomfortably gruesome realism, criminal doings and forensic puzzles, among the denizens of New York.  All that is wrapped in sophisticated production values, well worthy of a theatrical release, and performed by a top-notch cast. Gary Sinese is one of those relatively few actors, like Gene Hackman, who can star in a movie or a television show while being absolutely convincing as an ordinary working guy.The extras in this set include commentaries for the episodes ""Not What it Looks Like"", ""Oedipus Hex"", ""Silent Night"" and ""Consequences"".  There are four special features included. ""Hill Harper Explores the Body Farm"" -which in the spirit of truth in advertising, is exactly what it says. Be warned, I couldn't watch past the first five minutes or the second corpse, which ever came first. I'm sorry, liquefying human remains in a plastic wheelie bin was much more gruesome than anything I wanted to see over my dinner tray. The other features were a little easier to handle, although still pretty gory:  Those were ""the making of"" features, each focused on the curious aspects of specific episodes. Whoever would have thought of secret codes imbedded in custom-printed tee shirts,  or that the ""Suicide Girls"" is a performing group and a lifestyle.

1087214,A3U331IS53QQDY,B000SO7PCE,Jared P. Baratta,"[0, 2]","After getting past my disappointment over Season 2, I had every expectation that Season 3 would borrow more from Season 1 then Its predecessor. There WOULD be commentary on episodes that aired after Christmas, there WOULD be 7 discs with the Special Features together on their own disc, storylines WOULD be covered In depth this WOULD be An accurate DVD. Perchance to dream because Mischief Night 2007(when Season 3 went on sale) played A trick on me. Season 3 failed more then Season 2. A word that came Into play with Season 3 & later Season 4, was redundancy. Both commentary & Special Features comported to the same episode. In the smart world, you give An episode 1 or the other, NEVER both! That began here. The episodes that were doubled up were 0EDIPUS HEX & SILENT NIGHT. The former has THE SUICIDE GIRLS ROCK C.S.I. NEW YORK, the latter, THE MAKING OF..... The only other episodes with commentary alone are NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE & CONSEQUENCES. 0ther Special Features are BREAKING THE KILLER CODE(all about Shane Casey played by Edward Furlong) & HILL HARPER VISITS THE BODY FARM. All In all, the Special Features could have been better, but the redundancy Is unforgivable.There were storylines In Season 3 that were only bested by those In Season 5 & nary was there coverage. C.S.I. MIAMI(Season 4) & C.S.I. NEW YORK(Season 2) had A crossover FELONY FLIGHT/MANHATTAN MANHUNT where Horatio Caine & Mac Taylor pursued serial killer Henry Darius from Miami to New York. FELONY FLIGHT was Part 1 on MIAMI, MANHATTAN MANHUNT was Part 2 on the latter. The latter made reference to Lindsay seeing more blood then was found At the scene of Darius's latest New York murder & this was addressed In this SILENT NIGHT & fully tackled In SLEIGHT OUT OF HAND where we learned of the tragic event In Lindsay's childhood that motivated her to become A cop. Season 3 had us all on pins & needles with the Stella AIDS Scare which was began flowing In HEART OF GLASS & carried transmitted Into THE RIDE-IN, A DAZE OF WINE & ROACHES, WHAT SCHEMES MAY COME, PAST IMPERFECT & COLD REVEAL. There was disgraced Detective Dean Truby who was Introduced In CONSEQUENCES & was seen again In COMES AROUND. Truby resurfaced because of what began In PAST IMPERFECT At the same time the Stella AIDS Scare was being resolved, Clay Dobson, played by Joesph Lawrence. Dobson was A serial killer who got released form prison due to Truby's downfall. All of Truby's arrests were reexamined & Dobson benefited from this technicality. 0ut of jail, Dobson resumed his murderous ways. Mac went after him & Dobson decided to commit suicide In A way that would also disgrace Mac-plummeting to the ground landing on An NYPD patrol car. This led to An Internal Affairs Investigation where Mac's ass was in the roaster. Mac was suspected of killing Dobson In A rage. Mac went thru this In COLD REVEAL & COMES AROUND where Truby actually came thru for Mac by offering Mac A trump card to use against NYPD brass. There was the Irish Mob, Introduced as the B-plot In SWEET 16 & front & center In the finale SNOW DAY.Season 3 confirmed what we knew all along, that the C.S.I.s occupied the same universe with Jerry Bruckheimer's non-C.S.I. shows. Danny Pino who plays Detective Scotty Valens on COLD CASE, brought Valens from Philadelphia to New York In COLD REVEAL because Adam Ross, who performed the AIDS test for Stella, mistakenly put Stella's blood Into CODIS which popped for A match In A Philadelphia murder Valens was Investigating. Nelly Furtado guest-starred In SOME BURIED BONES, playing professional shoplifter Ava Brandt. Furtado's songs also bookended the episode, At the start, the club anthem MANEATER & As the finale, the ballad, ALL THINGS MUST COME TO AN END. Illusionist Criss Angel played murderous magician Luke Blade In SLEIGHT OUT OF HAND. We also got An education In Season 3. HEART OF GLASS centered on the death of A man who we learned had HIV. His blood made contact with Stella's & later It was discovered that the man was by his sister by mistake because the sister suffered from Capgras Syndrome. Capgras Is condition where the sufferer Is so scared by his/her reflection that they think they are looking At somebody else. The sister believed the woman In the mirror was stalking her & her brother. Something learned & the start of A storyline & what did we get for It? No commentary, no Special Features, NOTHING. Just like Season 2, Season 3, the DVD, did A disservice to the show & to the city of New York. Season 3 re-enforced how far superior Season 1 Is.Stay tuned for Season 4.",3,"FIRST TIME IS A MISTAKE, A SECOND IS A SIGN",1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,4578,"['getting', 'past', 'disappointment',

There are lots of bizarre crimes and murder weapons, e.g., an angel falls from the sky; a man is impaled on a condom machine, maybe by John McEnroe (!); a victim pronounced dead pulls a Lazarus.  And the cast has their own personal crises:  Mac (Gary Sinise) meets the son of is late wife, gets in trouble with the commissioner when a suspect throws himself off a roof, and has problems with his new love (the lovely Claire Forlani).  Stella (the great Melina Karakedes) faces possible infection from a victim with HIV; Danny is kidnapped by brutal drugrunners (well played by Carmine Giovanassi); Hawkes (Hill Harper) is framed for murder by a vindictive Edward Furlong; and Lindsay (Anna Belknap) testifies against the madman who killed four of her friends ten years previously.I enjoy the CSI shows; it's fun to watch how the team pulls their evidence together; as in all the shows, Gary Sinise is the glue that holds the series together.

Personally, while watching most of this season, I find that I'm going back to the first season when Danny had been in trouble with Tanglewood and the Minhaus shooting. With both Don Flack and Sheldon Hawks getting put into the hot seat, you could see the resentment they were feeling when Mac didn't seem like he was supporting them. I said ""now you know what Danny felt"". A sad thing about this season was the introduction of a new person with no background history other than she came back from teaching and was getting into Mac's life. I felt she pushed too hard and got what she deserved.So far the whole season was as enjoyable as the first with a few twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Now if the writers don't ruin another good show with bad writing, then it might make it as long as the other two parent shows.",5,"Great Acting, Questionable Writing",1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,892,"['Briefly', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'program', 'Personally', 'watching', 'most', 'season', 'find', ""'m"", 'going', 'back', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'Danny', 'had', 'been', 'trouble', 'Tanglewood', 'Minhaus', 'shooting', 'Don', 'Flack', 'Sheldon', 'Hawks', 'getting', 'put', 'hot', 'seat', 'could', 'see', 'resentment', 'were', 'feeling', 'when', 'Mac', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'supporting', 'said', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'Danny', 'felt', 'sad', 'thing', 'season', 'was', 'introduction', 'new', 'person', 'background', 'history', 'other', 'came', 'back', 'teaching', 'was', 'getting', 'Mac', 'life', 'felt', 'pushed', 'too', 'hard', 'got', 'what', 'deserved.So', 'far', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'few', 'twists', 'keep', 'toes', 'Now', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'good', 'show', 'bad', 'writing', 'then', 'might', 'make', 'as', 'long', 'other', 'two', 'parent', 'shows']",CSI: New York: Season 3
