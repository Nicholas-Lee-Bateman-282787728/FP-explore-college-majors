It looks good, sounds good and the actors are consistently a cut above the typical Romero movies.  On the other hand, it lacks the visceral punch of his zombie flicks and lacks the disconcerting creepiness of &#34;Martin&#34;.  &#34;Bruiser&#34;is an amusing but unengaging portrait of an underdog gone bad.  Unfortunate, because the mask archetype had potential but wasn't convincingly explored.Henry Creedlow is closer to Martin than to the Patrick Bateman character of &#34;American Psycho&#34; after whom Henry seems to be modeled.  The actor Jason Flemyng is good, but either he lacks the undercurrent of the handsome misfit about to explode, or else the character simply isn't drawn convincingly.Peter Stormare, as usual, entertainingly chews up the scenery whenever he appears.

669691,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005NQGM,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[0, 0]","Bruiser, written and directed by George A. Romero, legendary horror creator of one of the scariest movies of all time, Night Of the Living Dead, tells a sort of flat tale of what happens when an unassuming mouse of a man wakes one day to find he has lost his face, only to be replaced with a white, featureless mask.  The title refers to a fashion magazine where the lead character works.Henry Creedlow (Jason Flemyng) is your typical 'nice' guy who struggles with many aspects of his life.  His wife has absolutely no respect for him, claiming he's a loser and going nowhere, while engaging in an affair with Henry's boss (Peter Stormere) who verbally abuses Henry every chance he gets.  Not only that, but Henry's best friend and financial advisor has been stealing from Henry, causing Henry to go deep into debt in his efforts to try and create a lavish house only to satisfy his wife.  Henry's world is a bleak one, fleshed out with revenge fantasies and the occasional thoughts of suicide.Then, one day, Henry wakes up to find his face is gone.  In its' place is a white, featureless mask which empowers Henry to take matters into his own hands, righting the wrongs, dealing with those, in a rather bloody fashion, who've taken from Henry for so long.Given this movie was written and directed by George Romero, I was, as probably many others, expecting more than what we got.  There were brief moments of visceral violence, but not nearly as much as I would have expected.  I never really felt a sense of suspense as the faceless terror stalked his victims.  The kinder, gentler horror of George Romero I suppose.  The makeup to create the 'new' Henry certainly looked spooky, but the meandering of the plot squashed any possibilities of chills and thrills out of the movie for me.  And given the fact that there were no likeable characters in the movie, there was no real fondness ever developed, no attachments made, and thus, not much interest when various characters met their fate.  Even the character of Henry never provided any bonding to the audience, as first he is this meek, little man we may feel sorry for, but sympathy is far from liking, and then he turns into this brutal, remorseless killer finally dealing with matters that could he himself let deteriorate to the point they did.The movie on this disc is presented in wide screen format, and special features include a trailer for this movie and a couple other Lion's Gate releases, production commentary, and a Misfits' music video, as the band, in its' form current to the time, makes an appearance in the movie.  Bruiser had much potential, but lacked the bite I was really looking for...Romero fans will probably be disappointed if they are looking for something along the lines of his other releases like NOTLD, The Crazies, or Martin.  While those movies definitely reside out of the mainstream, this one plops itself right in the center of it, and suffers.",2,A fiend without a face.

669694,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00005NQGM,General Zombie,"[0, 0]","I guess I'd have to say that this movie is a bit underrated.  It's not brilliant, and it peters out towards the end, but it's generally well made and sufficiently entertaining.  Lots of people out there seem to be disappointed in this film at least partially because it wasn't what they expected. So I'd better say up front that this really isn't a horror film.  It's pretty much just drama, with a bit of a horrific edge to it, I suppose.  It's certainly not as good as Martin or Dawn or Night, but it's a respectable addition to Romero's filmography.Here, George is taking on the modern corporate world, (and by extension, modern society as a whole) as is quite popular in film today, as evinced by the severe cult popularity of Office Space and Fight Club.  Bruiser takes a different approach than either of those films. eschewing the comic or black-comic approach for a more straight dramatic approach. (Well, it's actually got a fair bit of dark humor in it, but not enough to classify it as a black comedy)  Lots of people will, I'm sure, find it's approach problematic, as our unnoticed, put-upon protagonist Henry decides to resort to violence (murder) to reclaim his identity, and the film never condemns Henry's actions on any level.(Though it does suggest that he could do other things which would make him happy)  I, for one, don't believe that George Romero is suggesting that we all go out and kill everyone who we feel is using us or treats us badly, but well, that IS what Henry does.  That right there pretty much serves as a plot-synopsis.  We are introduced to Henry, and see how everyone uses him and how miserable he is. He later wakes up with a white mime-face, and decides to take action, reassert himself, and get revenge.  That's about it,  and it works well enough.  The acting is quite good, though the characterization is occasionally problematic.  Flemyng is solid as Henry, he looks just right for the part, and does a fine job throughout the later portion of the film, despite the limitations of the mask.  Everyone is fine, though I do have some problems with Peter Stormare as Henry's boss, and the primary villain of the film.  He's probably best known as the terrifying and taciturn Gaer Grimsley (or something like that) in 'Fargo', but he takes a completely different route this time.  Simply put, his character is too over the top.  I don't doubt that there are at least a couple bosses out their who act a lot as he does, but he's just too much of a spectacle to work completely.  Having him be just as much of a jerk, but in a somewhat less flamboyant way would've been more effective, I think.  But, what can I say, I did dislike his character, as I was supposed to, so it can't be called a real failure.The film opens up particularly well, and we are introduced to Henry's world quite efficiently.  I think the brief little fantasy sequences are especially effective, and do a good job of showing us the disparity between how Henry acts, and how he actually feels.  The middle section is fine too, if not as good, as he starts to take his revenge, but it dips quite a bit at the end.  The last section of the film, during a huge, wild party, is dragged out too long, and nothing much really happens.  And, it gets a little weird too and overly elaborate for no apparent reason.  And the very last scene of the movie is a bit cheesy and pointless, too.  Still, the film works as a whole.  It's got a nice visual style, with sorta of sleek and beautiful sets which are cold and inhuman as well, just as they ought to be.  Romero's rapid-fire editing is toned down to have more long, calm shots.  I like his older style, but this one fits the film pretty well.  Lots of people dislike the score, but I think it works very well.  It's a bit unconventional, which I like, and it fits the whole tone of the film pretty well.

669695,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005NQGM,Jeffrey Leach,"[7, 10]","George Romero's contributions to the horror genre are legendary. Here is the guy who made &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; in the late 1960s, single-handedly bringing flesh-eating zombies into the lexicon of millions of horror fans. Two sequels followed with differing levels of success, but Romero's zombie films most importantly inspired several Italian directors, most notably Lucio Fulci and Umberto Lenzi, to churn out a plethora of grue drenched films featuring the shambling dead. Of course, Romero didn't just sit around during the intervals between zombie films; he made other films that, while not as well known as the trilogy of &quot;Dead&quot; films, are eerie in there own right. There is, of course, the gritty picture &quot;The Crazies,&quot; a film about a viral infection's devastating impact on the residents of a small Pennsylvania town. Another one of these movies is his latest one, &quot;Bruiser.&quot; &quot;The Crazies&quot; was a great, low budget effort that really worked on many levels. Sadly, &quot;Bruiser&quot; is a poor vehicle that, in my humble opinion, rarely works on any level and sullies this director's reputation in the horror genre.Bruiser is the name of a fashion magazine where the film's protagonist, Henry Creedlow, spends his day trying to earn a buck. And work he must, for his life appears to be one huge money pit. His gorgeous wife Janine expects a lot from her husband, like nice cars, fancy clothes, and a huge house decorated with expensive accoutrements. Not content when she receives these nice things, Janine hounds Henry constantly about not standing up for himself. We soon learn that she has a point: Creedlow wines to his stockbroker pal, who just happens to handle Henry's finances, about not earning enough money on his investments. Henry doesn't really do anything drastic, like change brokers, but instead stews quietly to himself about his cash flow problems. More challenges await Henry in the deteriorating relationship with his boss at the magazine. Milos Styles is a world-class jerk; a domineering, spastic dragon who takes great joy in belittling those around him. Although Creedlow has a good relationship with Styles's estranged photographer/mask sculpturing wife, Milos makes him want to scream. But what's a guy in debt up to his eyeballs going to do? Quit? That's out of the question. Instead, Henry Creedlow internalizes his anger, only occasionally indulging in imaginative acts of bloody violence carried out against his persecutors. For example, when a pushy woman elbows her way ahead of Henry at the train station, he fantasizes about pushing her underneath the train and revels in seeing the wheels roll over her head.Things are about to get worse to the nth degree. Problems arise when he sees wife Janine and boss Milo fooling around at a work party. His wife actually has the nerve, when confronted by Henry about her indiscretions, to argue with him over his meek acceptance of her adultery. This incident is the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back, and Janine secretly plans to leave her weak willed husband. At this point, something interesting happens. Henry awakens from a night's sleep and discovers his face covered by a mask eerily similar to one Milos's wife gave him the day before. Our hero panics when he realizes the mask is somehow molded to his face, completely impervious to any attempts at removal, and now really is anonymous to the outside world. He uses the mask as a means to get revenge against his oppressors and chooses Janine as his first target. When Creedlow learns how successful the operation against his wife was, he plans other attacks that threaten his embryonic relationship with Milos's wife while bringing in unwanted attention from the police. The movie concludes at a party thrown by Milos for his employees and models, where Creedlow must decide if his ultimate revenge plot is worth risking his life.I loved the first twenty or thirty minutes of &quot;Bruiser.&quot; Only a cold-hearted jerk would fail to empathize with Henry's plight. Here's a successful guy who has got it all, and no one pays him an ounce of respect. Romero makes sure that the enemies arrayed against Creedlow adequately embody evil, from the snotty Janine to the overbearing Styles. You just know &quot;Bruiser&quot; is going to turn into a revenge film with Creedlow gunning for his enemies. The only question is what type of revenge film we will see, and it is in this aspect that &quot;Bruiser&quot; ultimately disappoints. After Creedlow woke up with his white mask, the movie started to drag horribly. I knew I was in trouble when I kept glancing at the clock on the mantle and found myself astonished that only a few minutes had gone by when it felt like hours. This film is horribly arthritic for a revenge picture, with so much time passing between killings that boredom rapidly sets in. Even worse, the murders we do see are rather tepid affairs definitely not worth the wait.A few things really work for the movie. I can't remember the last time I saw such a stylish film, with characters wearing expensive looking clothing interacting in houses loaded with sumptuous decorations. A few of the characters, particularly Styles's wife, appear downright patrician in their demeanor and appearance. If only Romero had contrasted the posh surroundings with some gritty violence, &quot;Bruiser&quot; could have been a real winner. As far as the DVD goes, you get a gore filled music video from The Misfits, a commentary from director Romero, and trailers for &quot;Bruiser,&quot; &quot;O,&quot; and &quot;Faust.&quot; You get a nice picture transfer too. Romero will have to do better than this if he wants me to sit down with one of his pictures in the future, however.",2,Disappointing,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,5787,"['George', 'Romero',

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[4, 5]","Jason Flemyng plays Henry, a beaten-down exec at a glamor magazine who is being taken advantage of by his wife, his best friend, his boss, etc.  Of course, the movie is about his taking revenge, though he does so only by losing his identity.There's the overview, so let me now say that what would have greatly helped this film would have been to instill it from the beginning with the kind of humor and playfyulness that the last half hour had.  Henry is a little too obvious about what he's oblivious to, and though Jason Flemyng plays the part well, he just doesn't have a very convincing character to portray.  Peter Stormare of course stomps through the screen as Milo (pronounced mee-lo), an immigrant executive who has taken in the American Dream of consumption to its extreme, but Stormare seems to be a good barometer for the general quality of a movie--when he is over-the-top, as in this and in something like Armageddon, it is clear that you are not going to be watching a very good movie.  However, when he is toned down, as in Fargo or (hell) even in Seinfeld as Slippery Pete, you know you are in for a good show.  Henry's wife is more and more uninteresting as she gets nastier and nastier, and even the Hispanic maid is grossly overexaggerrated as she also takes advantage of poor, little Henry.  That Henry has to become faceless to finally stand up for himself is an interesting move, but even when the transition occurs, the deaths are a little too lacking in creativity, and the events just plod along.Until the Halloween party finally emerges.  The Misfits are on stage, unusual costumes abound, and even when Tom Atkins appears as (guess what) a cop, his appearance is more of a clearing of the air rather than a dreadful move of casting.  The finale shows promise, though the first hour gets to be an unfortunate bear.  I am going to avoid spoiling any endings here, but it might be worth jumping over the first 55 minutes or so to get to the good stuff--no doubt, you'll be able to catch up pretty quickly.The DVD also has a music video for The Misfits' ""Scream,"" also directed by Romero--evidently, the video was removed from any kind of MTV rotation for being too violent, but it shows a glimpse of the grandfather of gore at some of his most natural work.  Romero has certainly initiated a flood of great horror, and I am glad to see him trying something a little atypical, but I wish he could have worked a little more backwards and let the whole movie swing to a lighter mood.",3,If only the last 30 minutes had been first...,1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,2505,"['Jason', 'Flemyng', 'Henry', 'beaten-down', 'exec', 'glamor', 'magazine', 'who', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'boss', 'etc', 'course', 'movie', 'taking', 'revenge', 'so', 'only', 'losing', 'identity.There', 'overview', 'so', 'let', 'now', 'say', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'helped', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'instill', 'beginning', 'kind', 'humor', 'playfyulness', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'had', 'Henry', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'what', 'oblivious', 'Jason', 'Flemyng', 'part', 'well', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'convincing', 'character', 'portray', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'course', 'stomps', 'screen', 'Milo', 'pronounced', 'mee-lo', 'immigrant', 'executive', 'who', 'taken', 'American', 'Dream', 'consumption', 'extreme', 'Stormare', 'be', 'good', 'barometer', 'general', 'quality', 'movie', 'when', 'over-the-top', 'something', 'Armageddon', 'clear', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'However', 'when', 'toned', 'down', 'Fargo', 'hell', 'even', 'Seinfeld', 'Slippery', 'Pete', 'know', 'are', 'good', 'show', 'Henry', 'wife', 'more', 'more', 'uninteresting', 'nastier', 'nastier', 'even', 'Hispanic', 'maid', 'grossly', 'overexaggerrated', 'also', 'advantage', 'poor', 'little', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'become', 'faceless', 'finally', 'stand', 'up', 'interesting', 'move', 'even', 'when', 'transition', 'deaths', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'lacking', 'creativity', 'events', 'just', 'plod', 'along.Until', 'Halloween', 'party', 'finally', 'Misfits', 'are', 'stage', 'unusual', 'costumes', 'abound', 'even', 'when', 'Tom', 'Atkins', 'guess', 'what', 'cop', 'appearance', 'more', 'clearing', 'air', 'rather', 'dreadful', 'move', 'casting', 'finale', 'promise', 'first', 'hour', 'be', 'unfortunate', 'bear', 'am', 'going', 'avoid', 'spoiling', 'endings', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'jumping', 'first', '55', 'minutes', 'so', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'catch', 'up', 'pretty', 'quickly.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'music', 'video', 'Misfits', 'Scream', 'also', 'directed', 'Romero', 'evidently', 'video', 'was', 'removed', 'kind', 'MTV', 'rotation', 'being', 'too', 'violent', 'glimpse', 'grandfather', 'gore', 'most', 'natural', 'work', 'Romero', 'certainly', 'initiated', 'flood', 'great', 'horror', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'trying', 'something', 'little', 'atypical', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'little', 'more', 'backwards', 'let', 'whole', 'movie', 'swing', 'lighter', 'mood']",Bruiser

As much as I love George Romero though, I had to give Bruiser a look, and the end result wasn't anything terrible in the least, but it was definitely not as good as it could have beeen either.  Bruiser stars Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) as Henry Creedlow; a young executive who has been walked on his whole life.  His gorgeous wife (Nina Garbiras) cheats on him with his abusive boss (Peter Stormare), his best friend (Andrew Tarbet) has been stealing money from him, and generally nobody notices him.  Everything changes however when he wakes up one day to find his face is gone, replaced instead with a white, blank mask resembling those made by his bosses' wife (Leslie Hope).  Henry's sudden loss of identity allows him to seek bloody revenge against those who have wronged him, which works out pretty well throughout the film's first half, but sadly Bruiser loses steam after passing its halfway point.

669711,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005NQGM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Bruiser (George Romero, 2000)George Romero and the Hollywood mainstream have been making moves towards compromise for almost thirty years now. Romero's been getting less graphic in relation to the rest of the world, and the rest of the world has been getting more graphic in relation to him. Because of this, it should be no surprise to anyone that some of the purists (actually, quite a few of them) have labelled Romero a sellout or worse, leading to the commercial failures of Monkey Shines (a fine movie) and The Dark Half (a not so fine movie), and Romero's subsequent self-removal from the film world for seven long years. He returns with Bruiser, a film which never received theatrical distro in the United States. Thankfully, someone at Lion's Gate had the sense to at least put the VHS and DVD out over here in preparation for Romero's first bonafide blockbuster, an adaptation of King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon due out in 2002.Bruiser is another slice of Romero's favorite pie-- an examination of the role of the outcast in a satirized version of society. Twenty years ago, Romero enjoyed forcing his point home with buckets of gore, but he's grown up a little these days and gone out on a limb. Bruiser is, for the most part, gore-free, leaving us to ask ourselves whether Romero's filmmaking style alone is enough to make Bruiser as relevant as Knightriders, as savage as Dawn of the Dead, and/or as heartbreaking as Martin. My answer, after a few days of reflection, is a qualified yes.I say &quot;qualified&quot; because, while the subject matter is unmistakably Romero, the style of direction here is just as unquestionably Argento. This is a giallo film without the violence and with more of a backing story; Romero has replaced the gore with Argento's operatic, sweeping style of filmmaking. So the gimmick hasn't disappeared as much as it has changed.In the new episode of Pie a la George, Everyman, known here as Henry Creedlow (Jason Flemyng, late of _From Hell_ and every Guy Ritchie film ever made), wakes up one morning and realizes two things: a. he's losing it, and b. he may have never had it in the first place. Henry Creedlow's first morning as these revelations come to him is filled with fantasties of violent things he'd like to do to himself and others (cf. Jennifer Connelly's forking of Sean Gullette in Requiem for a Dream last year). While this is happening, he comes to realize that no one he knows actually thinks about him in anything more than a surface way, including his boss Miles (Peter Stormare, of Chocolat, 8MM, Playing God, et [many] al.), his wife Janine (Nina Garbiras, recently of the short-lived TV series &quot;The $treet,&quot; who bears more than a passing resemblance to the &quot;dream girl&quot; in Argento's Tenebre), and his high school chum/stockbroker James (Andrew Tarbet, known for The Famous Jett Jackson... heh). The two revelations eventually coalesce to turn Henry into something of a nasty bent-on-being-noticed sociopath.Many reviews of the film seem to be panning it for relative lack of acting skills; I didn't see it that way at all. Some characters come off as artificial, but they're supposed to be, a la Argento or (as an even better example) Joe Mantegna in Mamet's House of Games. It's all part of the satire. this isn't, thankfully, society as we know it; just as the shopping mall zombies of Dawn of the Dead were American consumer culture, the shallow husks we are handed here are Hollywood power-structure culture. They're no less mindless for not being caked with blue makeup and covered with the blood of their recent meals.Bruiser is definitely worth a look, especially if seven years of Romerolessness have had you climbing the walls.

The first would be the childhood enjoyment he's given us and Santa with the Tales from the Darkside tv series. Next would be Creepshow & the cherished Creepshow 2 which opened up the door to the work Pancho. The guy pumps out some classic works that are always fun to watch which is what brings us to tonights review. This film called Bruiser came out in 2000, the year of the classic cruise, and really packed a punch for Sid.The film starts out with a nice guy named Harry who pretty much gets abused by everyone in life. He has a wife that just uses for his money, a ""best friend"" who rips him off, and a boss (Slippery Pete) who bashes him non-stop. The final icing on the cake comes when he finds his wife cheating on him with his boss. When he wakes up the morning after he has a white face that looks like a mask, hiding his true identity. From this point on you see a different Harry whose purpose is to get revenge. And he get this! It's a classic tale of the nice guy hitting his boiling point on simply going ape***t.Bruiser isn't the best horror film you will see, but it is pretty darn good.

Romero never fails to interest me.  But his newest film, made after 8 year absence since not-so-good &quot;The Dark Half,&quot; is a big disappontment.Jason Flemyng is Henry, who is leading an unhappy life with his unfaithful wife.  At his office, uncompromising tyranny of his  boss is waiting for him.  One day, he finds his face is turned into total blank as if completely erased -- like a white mask he saw at the party last night.  Is this a chance to do something he normally can't?  Or is this a curse?  So, what he's gonna do?Though the idea is original, Romero fails to develop it fully, being content with the initial half-baked concept.  I am sorry to say this, and I don't change my attitude to this respected director, but I think Romero needs to show what he wants to do in the film.  Sometimes the film is unexpectedly funny (the ending scene is pretty funny and cool), and sometimes scary (especially his first reaction to his housemaid), and those parts are OK, I admit.  But Romero seems to find too much sense in Henry's white, expresionless face.  Is he going to revenge all the people who bullied him in the past?  Or should he stop, listening to a piece of good advice his female friend kindly gives?  Between those options Henry wavers -- and I know that's supposed to be the point -- but the film takes too much time to show his conflict, which is a too obvious one.  Romero's horror masterpieces in the past indeed dealt with these philosophical topics, but not so heavy-handedly to destory the good pace of the entire film.And in the end, Henry does what he does in the most contrived fashion, using laser, with the sound of The Misfits (who also appears).  I admire Romero's usually underrated works, which are sometimes unduely labeled &quot;cult&quot; films, but here, in &quot;Bruiser,&quot; he put more ponderous things than he should have.",2,"Sorry, But I'm Disappointed with New Film of Horror Maestro",1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,2025,"['always', 'welcome', 'works', 'great', 'creators', 'genre', 'even', 'went', 'theater', 'watch', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'vampire', 'flick', 'name', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'never', 'interest', 'newest', 'film', 'made', '8', 'year', 'absence', 'not-so-good', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Half', 'quot', 'big', 'disappontment.Jason', 'Flemyng', 'Henry', 'who', 'leading', 'unhappy', 'life', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'office', 'uncompromising', 'tyranny', 'boss', 'waiting', 'One', 'day', 'face', 'turned', 'total', 'blank', 'completely', 'erased', 'white', 'mask', 'saw', 'party', 'last', 'night', 'chance', 'do', 'something', 'normally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'curse', 'So', 'what', 'gon', 'do', 'idea', 'original', 'Romero', 'develop', 'fully', 'being', 'content', 'initial', 'half-baked', 'concept', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'attitude', 'respected', 'director', 'think', 'Romero', 'show', 'what', 'do', 'film', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'funny', 'ending', 'scene', 'pretty', 'funny', 'cool', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'especially', 'first', 'reaction', 'housemaid', 'parts', 'are', 'OK', 'admit', 'Romero', 'find', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'Henry', 'white', 'expresionless', 'face', 'going', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'bullied', 'past', 'should', 'stop', 'listening', 'piece', 'good', 'advice', 'female', 'friend', 'kindly', 'Between', 'options', 'Henry', 'wavers', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'point', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'show', 'conflict', 'too', 'obvious', 'one', 'Romero', 'horror', 'masterpieces', 'past', 'indeed', 'dealt', 'philosophical', 'topics', 'not', 'so', 'heavy-handedly', 'destory', 'good', 'pace', 'entire', 'film.And', 'end', 'Henry', 'what', 'most', 'contrived', 'fashion', 'using', 'laser', 'sound', 'Misfits', 'who', 'also', 'admire', 'Romero', 'usually', 'underrated', 'works', 'are', 'sometimes', 'unduely', 'labeled', 'quot', 'cult', 'quot', 'films', 'here', 'quot', 'Bruiser', 'quot', 'put', 'more', 'ponderous', 'things', 'should', 'have']",Bruiser
