I liked them and so cared what happened and so their fear had integrity. The acting never failed. and no stupid hysteria.I liked the humour when it happened.Of course out of the infinity of life-forms possible in the cosmos us humans keep insisting our alien are grey or green and....duh...look like an insect reptile hybrid.Nevertheless  the camera kept insinuating or showing just enough of them to keep them credible and terrible.The ending was believable.

I don't know how they got all the film festival accolades advertised on the dvd cover?  That's why I bought it.  Can you buy the little olive-wreath symbols on ebay and stick them on your on dvd?  I was suspicious of the movie's quality from the start when the opening scene has a young woman in bed screaming her head off.  Ooooooo, real scary.  After feeling ill from watching the half of it, I checked on IMDB and see it had a 3.5, but only because one of the seven reviewers gave it a 10 while the other six gave it a 1 or 2!  The reviewer that gave it a 10 must have been on drugs.I don&#8217;t know how people get movies like this produced.  What idiot would put money into crap like this!

1454420,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B005COLF1W,Michael Butts,"[7, 9]","Ever since 1957's classic INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, film-makers have used the scenario of alien possession on multiple occasions.  GREY SKIES is one of those movies.A group of friends gather for a reunion in an isolated lodge in Michigan.  Guests include a newly engaged couple, a gay couple, a player and his new conquest, and a single sullen lady with her own secret.  On the first night, a strange meteor-like light impacts the nearby woods and the next day strange things start happening.The problem with GREY SKIES is its slow beginning.  While necessary to develop characterization, this movie's characters and actors aren't particularly interesting.  Things pick up once we realize what's going on and a steady level of suspense is maintained.The creatures aren't shown in full detail and the movie's bizarre opening is never truly integrated into the story.GREY SKIES looks nice at times, but ultimately is no match for the classic pod people.",2,I DON'T KNOW WHAT POSSESSED ME,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,957,"['Ever', '1957', 'classic', 'INVASION', 'THE', 'BODY', 'SNATCHERS', 'film-makers', 'have', 'used', 'scenario', 'alien', 'possession', 'multiple', 'occasions', 'GREY', 'SKIES', 'one', 'movies.A', 'group', 'friends', 'gather', 'reunion', 'isolated', 'lodge', 'Michigan', 'Guests', 'include', 'newly', 'engaged', 'couple', 'gay', 'couple', 'player', 'new', 'conquest', 'single', 'sullen', 'lady', 'own', 'secret', 'first', 'night', 'strange', 'meteor-like', 'light', 'nearby', 'woods', 'next', 'day', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening.The', 'problem', 'GREY', 'SKIES', 'slow', 'beginning', 'necessary', 'develop', 'characterization', 'movie', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Things', 'pick', 'up', 'once', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'steady', 'level', 'suspense', 'maintained.The', 'creatures', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'full', 'detail', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'opening', 'never', 'truly', 'integrated', 'story.GREY', 'SKIES', 'nice', 'times', 'ultimately', 'match', 'classic', 'pod', 'people']",Grey Skies

He has been fighting with his girlfriend Jenny (Stacy Jorgensen) as he took off for a week after their last fight. They are joined by Michael (Michael Cornacchia) who supplies us attempts at comedy. His boy toy photographer friend Brian (Jeff Schuetze) comes along too. Hayden (Jeff Lorch) is the third buddy who brings along his girl Sandy (Shelley Dennis). Annie (Anne Griffin) a mutual friend of the fighting couple comes too to add to the tension because fighting Greys isn't enough to hold our interest.I think you got the general idea. The characters were decent. They were able to effectively develop a large number of characters in a short span of time while still keeping the plot moving. The problem is that the horror aspect was low even when the Greys were there. Okay, Alien being that mean us no harm and plot spoiler: No one is dying.
