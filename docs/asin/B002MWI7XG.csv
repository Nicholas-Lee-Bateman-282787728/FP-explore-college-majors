1278548,A3KE8KIXX52PQA,B002MWI7XG,"Arlene Bradley ""arlene1999""","[0, 1]","This movie is a delightful,bright exciting romantic comedy. At the heart of it is Boy meet Girl, follows girl to LA, fights for girl,wins girl,losses girl, goes home, girl decides she wants boy and follows boy back to Scotland. David Tennant in one of his early works is brilliant in this as always. the supporting cast is very good expressly Vincent Gallo as the spaced out friend. The only parts i found weird were the cameo appearances of Johnning Deep.  This is a Hilarious fish-out-of-water love story.",4,Delightful romantic comedy,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,507,"['movie', 'delightful', 'bright', 'exciting', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'heart', 'Boy', 'meet', 'Girl', 'girl', 'LA', 'fights', 'girl', 'girl', 'losses', 'girl', 'home', 'girl', 'boy', 'boy', 'back', 'Scotland', 'David', 'Tennant', 'one', 'early', 'works', 'brilliant', 'always', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'expressly', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'spaced', 'out', 'friend', 'only', 'parts', 'i', 'found', 'were', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Johnning', 'Deep', 'Hilarious', 'fish-out-of-water', 'love', 'story']",N/A

Then, when he stalks her all the way to LA, she doesn't call the cops, but instead goes on dates with him? Um, whether or not the acting here is bad, the plot has no credibility, even if it is a comedy. The Brit star is ok, sort of, but I grew weary after a third of this indie had played out.",2,Not credible,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,389,"['Firstly', 'undertaker', 'American', 'girl', 'English', 'graveyard', 'Then', 'when', 'way', 'LA', ""n't"", 'call', 'cops', 'instead', 'dates', 'Um', 'not', 'acting', 'here', 'bad', 'plot', 'credibility', 'even', 'comedy', 'Brit', 'star', 'ok', 'sort', 'grew', 'weary', 'third', 'indie', 'had', 'played', 'out']",N/A

It does provide an outsider's view of life in LA from either a foreigner's view point, or even a rural American's view.  The rest of the movie is a bit slow at points and tends to meander. David's performance (maybe it is the accent) is the shining spot in the movie.",4,David Tennant is the bright spot in this movie,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,356,"['actually', 'purchased', 'movie', 'David', 'Tennant', 'was', 'not', 'disappoint', 'provide', 'outsider', 'view', 'life', 'LA', 'foreigner', 'view', 'point', 'even', 'rural', 'American', 'view', 'rest', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'points', 'meander', 'David', 'performance', 'maybe', 'accent', 'shining', 'spot', 'movie']",N/A
