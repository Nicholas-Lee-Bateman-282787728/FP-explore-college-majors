Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) is the consummate professional when his work is questioned in the courtroom, and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) continues her downward spiral after Grissom rejects her both personally and professionally.As the characters continued to grow and develop during season four, the cases became more intriguing as well. Granted, there were some bizarre ones - one needs to look no further than 'Fur and Loating' for a truly strange case - but many of them were simply well-done. The season two-part opener deals with a local couple who targets tourists, while 'Paper or Plastic' is about a grocery store robbery. Other highlights include 'Invisible Evidence', where the crime lab is against the clock in prosecuting a murderer, 'Bloodlines', a case about a raped woman who has seemingly misidentified her attacker in a police lineup, and 'Turn of the Screws', which revolves around an accident at an amusement park. The best episode of the season - and perhaps the best of the show thus far - is undoubtedly 'Butterflied', in which a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Sara is found murdered. It is truly a psychological thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.Murder? Check. Unusual cases? Check. Intriguing character development? Check.

So all of disc 1 should have had commentary. Jerry Stahl AGAIN gets screwed over & this was him comeback episode. Stahl had written nothing for Season 3, no work after the Season 2 finale THE HUNGER ARTIST. Stahl returned with a vengeance with FUR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS. Stahl outdid himself with the plushies, people who get their greatest sexual satisfaction wearing animal costumes. 1-liner after 1-liner after 1-liner. With the ratings & water-cooler gossip the next day made it a classic. Even the B-Plot of that murder victim was memorable for the fact he was frozen to the floor & that far back was a rare moment of Robbins in the field.Following the tradition of the ripped from the headlines episodes that came before it-UNFRIENDLY SKIES(1) & ANATOMY OF A LYE(2), AFTER THE SHOW would get the brushoff. Based on the murder of LA cheerleader Linda S0bek, AFTER THE SHOW focused on the murder of a model just beginning her career only to have her promise snuffed out by her creepy photographer. So all of disc 2 should have had commentary.The confrontation between Grissom & officer Charles Fromansky was ushered in ALL FOR OUR COUNTRY, that followed in PAPER OR PLASTIC? which had the team dealing with mass murder at a grocery store. Jamie Allman turned in quite the turn as Celeste Turner, the employee who organizes the robbery because her boss keeps her hours too low to qualify for benefits.EARLY R0LL0UT which was the last episode to have writing form Creator Anthony Zuiker as he would shift to his role as Showrunner on C.S.I. NEW YORK, had character development for Catherine as it introduced Nicolas Lea as nightclub owner Cris Besich. Their pairing would carry on for the remainder of the season. EARLY R0LL0UT also hinted at Sara's substance abuse.Jerry Stahl got the shaft a second time. GETTING OFF was insane, a woman who could only get her rocks off by having sex with men made up as clowns, the B-Plot of the drug khat which was a reference to Bruckheimer's war epic BLACK HAWK DOWN which costarred Kim COates who played Drake Snow in EARLY R0LL0UT. Extensive location filming in Las Vegas with the teaser getting off with a nice shot of the Stratosphere Tower.DEAD RINGER was the last episode written by technical advisor Elizabeth Devine who decided to leave C.S.I. to become a full-time writer on C.S.I. MIAMI. DEAD RINGER involved multiple jurisdictions as featuring the law enforcement relay race.NO MORE BETS, furthered the Catherine/Besich romance as well as Catherine having to deal with Sam Braun again as a murder suspect but now she was unable to work any case related to Braun because in the Season 3 finale INSIDE THE BOX, we learned, she learned Braun was her father. Grissom had to question Catherine's objectivity when he learned of the 250000 dollar check Braun ,ailed to her in JACKPOT.Now we get to season finale BLOODLINES which ran out from left field in it dealt with a rapist getting away with it even though the victim, pit boss Linley Parker clearly identifies psychologist Todd Coombs. Parker is later found dead & the DNA has a filial connection to Coombs so the team collects DNA from all of the Coombs' men. No match from any of the brothers & we get the big reveal, it was at the same time, Coombs & his twin brother whose DNA was absorbed by Coombs, a twin that never developed. What allowed Coombs to beat DNA testing was the genetic quirk of chimerism, when a zygote fails to develop & the DNA is absorbed by the surviving twin. So the DNA of the stomach does not match the DNA of the liver, different DNA between lungs & kidneys. Chimerism has been a real life news story where people had to fight overwhelming odds to prove innocence of crimes, prove maternity or paternity. Chimerism is still quite the medical mystery. The producers could have called in the leading doctor in the country who specializes in chimerism research to provide commentary. Also commentary from guest stars George Newbern & Nina Siemaszko who each turned in brilliant, unforgettable performances.So many times when the show does something special like this, it gets little to no focus on the DVD.

Episodes about subjects like a dead scuba diver in a tree and a crazed passenger in first-class were truly inspired.In Season 4, unfortunately, something gives.  Maybe the writers came up with these over-the-top, ludicrous stories with shallow character development because they were running out of ideas.  Maybe the producers felt more explosions and soap opera ""office politics"" would keep viewers happy.In any event, there is a noticeable drop-off in quality - especially in the writing - and overall Season 4 feels like one of those sequels where the creative talent is more interested in cashing in than discovering new ways to evolve the show.  Think ""Star Wars"" after the first two sequels.In Seasons 1-3, ""CSI"" could also stand for clever, subtle and intelligent.  In Season 4, though, the acronym changes to contrived, self-satisfied and imitative.  CSI is still an OK show in Season 4, but it's sad when such an original and enjoyable series regresses to the mean of network TV mediocrity (i.e., Explosions! Grisly violence!  Sex!  More explosions!).CSI used to achieve an exquisite balance of plot, characterization, science, cinematography and music.

How do they manage, week after week, to present fine acting, fine plots, fine characters and fine editing and sound? And Petersen and Co. are not exactly hard to look at, either. It's a joy to sit down to watch these episodes.However, I suggest resisting the temptation to watch several at once for fear of running out and getting withdrawal symptoms.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","It's amazing that a prime time network drama, let alone the highest rated program on television today, can still maintain the freshness that made it so popular.  The fourth season of C.S.I. found the series rejuvinated along with it's main protagonist, Gil Grissom (William Petersen, sporting his Manhunter-era beard), who has since regained his hearing, and is once again at the top of his game.  During the season, Gil has a choice ahead of him on who to promote, whether it be Nick (George Eads) or Sara (the gorgeous Jorja Fox), while the rest of the C.S.I. members personal lives take a back seat for some of the most elaborately portrayed crimes ever seen on network TV, and the twists and turns made as they are solved.  C.S.I. really came back into it's own during the fourth season, once again becoming a force to be reckoned with as new characters are introduced, and the season comes to a bit of a shocker of a close.  The episode entitled ""Fur and Loathing"" will go down in C.S.I. history as one the most infamous episodes of the series that you have to see to believe.  All in all, C.S.I. still continues to roll along as the best show on network TV, and if you are one of the few who has never watched this addictive show, you do not know what you're missing.",5,Still rolling along,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,1273,"['amazing', 'prime', 'time', 'network', 'drama', 'let', 'alone', 'highest', 'rated', 'program', 'television', 'today', 'can', 'still', 'maintain', 'freshness', 'made', 'so', 'popular', 'fourth', 'season', 'C.S.I', 'found', 'series', 'rejuvinated', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Gil', 'Grissom', 'William', 'Petersen', 'sporting', 'Manhunter-era', 'beard', 'who', 'regained', 'hearing', 'once', 'again', 'top', 'game', 'season', 'Gil', 'choice', 'ahead', 'who', 'promote', 'be', 'Nick', 'George', 'Eads', 'Sara', 'gorgeous', 'Jorja', 'Fox', 'rest', 'C.S.I', 'members', 'personal', 'lives', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'most', 'elaborately', 'portrayed', 'crimes', 'ever', 'seen', 'network', 'TV', 'twists', 'turns', 'made', 'are', 'solved', 'C.S.I', 'really', 'came', 'back', 'own', 'fourth', 'season', 'once', 'again', 'becoming', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'season', 'bit', 'shocker', 'close', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Fur', 'Loathing', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'C.S.I', 'history', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'episodes', 'series', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'C.S.I', 'still', 'roll', 'along', 'best', 'show', 'network', 'TV', 'are', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'never', 'watched', 'addictive', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing']",N/A

The Las Vegas Crime Lab are the characters on this show, backed up here and there by the LVPD.The third season ended with Gil Grissom (the main character) going in for ear surgery.  He had been losing his hearing for some time, his mother had went deaf, and he would too if he didn't get this operation.  On the first episode on this set, Grissom lets his co-worker Catherine know that her cell phone is vibrating.  She says, ""You can hear that?  You're back.""Also on the first episode of this set, the character Nick Stokes tells a guy, who he knew long ago - who recognizes him now, about some specifics on the case they're working on.  We find out that guy leaked the info to the press - which creates a problem between Grissom and Nick.Another problem in the storylines is concerning the character Sara Sidel, who shows early on in this set, that she's mad at Grissom.  Late in season three, she asked him out - and he said 'no'.So aside from all the personal drama between the characters, the murder cases themselves are always interesting.One of things that people love about this show (and its spin-offs) are 'The CSI Shot':  an extreme close-up used in every episode.  This close-up shot is used to help us (the viewer) see better what they (the investigators and coroners) are seeing.  The camera zooms in on and through gunshot wounds; through blood streams; wounds to the back of the head; anything useful.On the final episode of this box set, aside from a drunk driving accident involving one of the characters, the boss Gil Grissom promises to the lab tech character Greg that he will be put 'in the field', like the other CSI criminalists.  This fact is true:  as in season five (the newest season, airing this fall) a new lab tech enters the show, and Greg is given field work.  Greg, due to his good sense of humor, has got to be my favorite character on the show.So check out season four, and the others one too, if you haven't already.  Don't let that $75-$80 pricetag on this set scare you, you won't be disappointed.The first season of CSI:  Miami is also on DVD, the second season will be out later this year, with the third season airing on TV.  The Miami show I really didn't enjoy too much, I think because of the cast.  Also this fall, CSI:  New York starts its first season.  Gary Sinice is the star of that one, who has studied up on forensic science in the past - for his villian character on the movie ""Ransom""",5,One of the Best Shows in a While,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,2472,"['great', 'show', 'great', 'cast', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Crime', 'Lab', 'are', 'characters', 'show', 'backed', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'LVPD.The', 'third', 'season', 'ended', 'Gil', 'Grissom', 'main', 'character', 'going', 'ear', 'surgery', 'had', 'been', 'losing', 'hearing', 'time', 'mother', 'had', 'went', 'deaf', 'would', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'operation', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'Grissom', 'co-worker', 'Catherine', 'know', 'cell', 'phone', 'vibrating', 'can', 'hear', ""'re"", 'back', 'Also', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'character', 'Nick', 'Stokes', 'guy', 'who', 'knew', 'long', 'ago', 'who', 'now', 'specifics', 'case', ""'re"", 'working', 'find', 'out', 'guy', 'leaked', 'info', 'press', 'problem', 'Grissom', 'Nick.Another', 'problem', 'storylines', 'concerning', 'character', 'Sara', 'Sidel', 'who', 'early', 'set', 'mad', 'Grissom', 'Late', 'season', 'three', 'asked', 'out', 'said', 'aside', 'personal', 'drama', 'characters', 'murder', 'cases', 'are', 'always', 'interesting.One', 'things', 'people', 'love', 'show', 'spin-offs', 'are', ""'The"", 'CSI', 'Shot', 'extreme', 'close-up', 'used', 'episode', 'close-up', 'shot', 'used', 'help', 'viewer', 'see', 'better', 'what', 'investigators', 'coroners', 'are', 'seeing', 'camera', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'blood', 'streams', 'back', 'head', 'anything', 'final', 'episode', 'box', 'set', 'aside', 'drunk', 'driving', 'accident', 'involving', 'one', 'characters', 'boss', 'Gil', 'Grissom', 'lab', 'tech', 'character', 'Greg', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'field', 'other', 'CSI', 'criminalists', 'fact', 'true', 'season', 'five', 'newest', 'season', 'airing', 'fall', 'new', 'lab', 'tech', 'show', 'Greg', 'given', 'field', 'work', 'Greg', 'due', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'got', 'be', 'favorite', 'character', 'show.So', 'check', 'season', 'four', 'others', 'one', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', '75-', '80', 'pricetag', 'set', 'scare', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'first', 'season', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'also', 'DVD', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'later', 'year', 'third', 'season', 'airing', 'TV', 'Miami', 'show', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'cast', 'Also', 'fall', 'CSI', 'New', 'York', 'first', 'season', 'Gary', 'Sinice', 'star', 'one', 'who', 'studied', 'up', 'forensic', 'science', 'past', 'villian', 'character', 'movie', 'Ransom']",N/A
