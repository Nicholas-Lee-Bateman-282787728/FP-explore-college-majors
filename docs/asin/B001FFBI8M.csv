I was there the first day with a bunch of friends thinking ""Hey this movie is gonna be terrible"" the trailers were decent but it made it seem eminem was just going off this poor white boy story.However the story shows growing up poor, the rap game underground, battling, love, betrayal, and hell it was even funny. Everyone came through with acting, even eminem, which really surprised me. It wasn't a Oscar awarding performance but it was good enough that he didn't hurt the film, he played his character well even though he stated he only lived in trailer park for two days in his life in the movie he played a kid who's lived there years.Overall with the final battle being great for rap fans it's an enjoyable movie for all looking for a good kickback rap in the 90's type of film with a decent story following.",5,"""Who Knew"" Em can act?",1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,907,"['Well', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'cds', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'there', 'first', 'day', 'bunch', 'friends', 'thinking', 'Hey', 'movie', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'terrible', 'trailers', 'were', 'decent', 'made', 'seem', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'off', 'poor', 'white', 'boy', 'story.However', 'story', 'growing', 'up', 'poor', 'rap', 'game', 'underground', 'battling', 'love', 'betrayal', 'hell', 'was', 'even', 'funny', 'Everyone', 'came', 'acting', 'even', 'eminem', 'really', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'awarding', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'film', 'played', 'character', 'well', 'even', 'stated', 'only', 'lived', 'trailer', 'park', 'two', 'days', 'life', 'movie', 'played', 'kid', 'who', 'lived', 'years.Overall', 'final', 'battle', 'being', 'great', 'rap', 'fans', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'looking', 'good', 'kickback', 'rap', '90', 'type', 'film', 'decent', 'story', 'following']",N/A

Some say well, he is essentially playing himself.  Ok, this is true... but at the same time, he had to have rapport and show chemistry with the other actors.  In which I believe Eminem did very well.  I enjoy this movie very much.  And I believe most Eminem fans, would agree.
