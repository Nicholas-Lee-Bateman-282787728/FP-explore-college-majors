Some sitcoms hit their stride in the earlier seasons but Full House got better with age which is rare nowadays. My favorite episodes from season 6 include: Come Fly with Me, Lovers and Other Tanners, I'm Not D.J., Birthday Blues, and Prom Night. I like this season because D.J. finally gets a steady boyfriend and Danny continues to date Vicky - this is the lovey dovey season. I highly recommend this cookie-cutter show (and that's a good thing) Enjoy!",5,The best season.,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,519,"['Full', 'House', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'far', 'best', 'season', 'sitcoms', 'hit', 'stride', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Full', 'House', 'got', 'better', 'age', 'rare', 'nowadays', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', '6', 'include', 'Come', 'Fly', 'Me', 'Lovers', 'Other', 'Tanners', ""'m"", 'Not', 'D.J.', 'Birthday', 'Blues', 'Prom', 'Night', 'season', 'D.J', 'finally', 'steady', 'boyfriend', 'Danny', 'date', 'Vicky', 'lovey', 'dovey', 'season', 'highly', 'recommend', 'cookie-cutter', 'show', 'good', 'thing', 'Enjoy']",N/A

1040685,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000LV6O12,Mark Baker,"[1, 1]","Season six of Full House finds the Tanner family continuing to grow as they face new challenges together.The season opens with D.J. (Candace Cameron) returning from a summer in Spain with a surprise, boyfriend Steve (Scott Weinger).  This is a change that dad Danny (Bob Saget) isn't ready to deal with.  Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) has a change of her own to face when her best friend moves from California to Texas.  Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) wants different rules then her sister had, and rebels by getting her ears pierced.  And Jesse (John Stamos) and Joey (Dave Coulier) deal with their own changes when they team up again to become hosts of an afternoon radio show.In another continuity error (which does happen in long running series), Jesse suddenly goes from being a high school graduate in season four to a high school drop out who goes to night school to get his diploma.  Even though this doesn't fit with what they did before, it provides several fun episodes.Another running storyline is Danny's long distance relationship with Vicky (recurring actress Gail Edwards).  We get to watch the struggles these two endure.  All this comes to a climax when the gang heads to Disney World for the season finale.With the girls growing up, the series is continuing to find new topics to explore.  And it continues to be just as fun, funny, and heart warming as always.  While many of the episodes are predictable, there's lots of fun getting to the end.  Missing from this season are most of the catch phrases we're used to hearing.  As much as I enjoyed them, it's a change I don't mind that much.As with the last couple season sets, there are no bonus features.  We do get all 24 episodes on four discs.  They look and sound good enough for a sitcom.  There's nothing here that will blow you away, but there really is no need for it, either.This series won't appeal to everyone.

1040686,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000LV6O12,MollyRK,"[4, 5]","With a show as lighthearted and enjoyable as ""Full House,"" its contains innocent entertainment that doesn't warrant many negative reviews. Unless you're a cynic who isn't really big on the fluff, it is safe to say that this series represents wholesome fun that we can all gladly revisit through the impressively well-paced DVD releases.Although all the seasons of ""Full House"" (with the possible exception of their rough inaugural year) are pleasing to watch, it is this 6th season that got the show's message down just right. As I was looking through the season's episode guide prior to the release of this set, I realized that many of my very favorite episodes were filmed this year, and I believe that the chemistry between the characters was at its best.A great deal happens for both the adults and the kids this season. To begin, single dad Danny Tanner finds his first true love (after his late wife Pam, of course) in Vicky Larson, who replaces Rebecca on ""Wake Up, San Francisco"" and initially puts Danny off with her no-nonsense attitude, but eventually wins his heart through her sweet and incredibly likable personality. Former high school dropout Jesse earns his diploma at last and team up with previous business partner Joey to host a local radio show. To add some sparkle to the mix, toddlers Nicky and Alex are now walking, talking, and bringing the classic baby fun to the Tanner household once again. Many fans will notice that the writers opted for a slight age jump with the twins (they were born in the middle of the previous season, which would normally make them less than a year old at this point), primarily to open up more storylines for young parents Jesse and Becky. That goal is certainly achieved throughout the season, as the boys definitely keep their parents on their toes. For proud papa Jesse Katsopolis, there is no road he won't take to give his boys a happy, fulfilling life--even if it means making some ""minor embellishments"" on the entrance application for Bouton Hall, a super-posh preschool in town! (Hey, if being ""unbelievably trilingual"" and having a father named ""Ambassador Katsopolis"" will help get you into a selective preschool, then why not add it to the application?)Then, of course, there are the beloved Tanner daughters, played perfectly by Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. At 16, 11 and 6 years old, the girls are growing up quickly and receiving stronger plot material to reflect those changes. High schooler DJ returns from a summer program in Spain with new boyfriend Steve (aka the man with the iron stomach), and the entire season follows the classic ups and downs of her first love. Fifth grader Stephanie--with a new physical look and a perkier-than-usual personality--lets Kimmy Gibbler pierce her ears (now there's a scary thought!), pushes the romance with a fellow baseball teammate, and finds herself an unsuspecting recipient of some frightening secrets from a physically abused classmate (my personal favorite episode). In-between saying good-bye to her longtime friend Teddy and being crowned ""Princess of the Day"" during a family trip to Disney World, first grader Michelle gets the wrong idea about Steve's friendly behavior toward her and goes full-force with wedding plans (a road that big sister Stephanie went down herself just four years ago). Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are probably at their cutest here, and now they are fashion moguls who have officially reached billionaire status (all before their 21st birthday), it is nice to look back and enjoy their fresh and youthful days.Bottom line, if you are a loyal fan of this series, this is definitely the DVD to pick up next time you are out shopping. With a $21.99 (approximately) price and episodes as great as the ones this season, you simply can't go wrong.

But here is the question Steve, makes his first apperarnce in the ""sisters in crime"" episode in season 5. At that time his name is Steve Peters. Later at the Prom episode he is Steve Hale. Anybody know what the deal was with that? Is it the same as how Uncle Jesse went from Jesse Cochran to Jesse Kastopolis or what? I have seen this show so many times that I notice little things like this. But bottom line even with sligt inconsitancies this is easily one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) family sitcom of all time. Excellent for any age, sex or walk of life.wamcdavi",5,does anyone know,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,651,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'love', 'full', 'house', 'season', '6', 'favorite', 'season', 'here', 'question', 'Steve', 'first', 'apperarnce', 'sisters', 'crime', 'episode', 'season', '5', 'time', 'name', 'Steve', 'Peters', 'Later', 'Prom', 'episode', 'Steve', 'Hale', 'Anybody', 'know', 'what', 'deal', 'was', 'same', 'how', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'went', 'Jesse', 'Cochran', 'Jesse', 'Kastopolis', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'notice', 'little', 'things', 'bottom', 'line', 'even', 'sligt', 'inconsitancies', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'not', 'THE', 'greatest', 'family', 'sitcom', 'time', 'Excellent', 'age', 'sex', 'walk', 'life.wamcdavi']",N/A
