1085913,A1C0NMCONVFVF4,B000SBAVIW,Chloe,"[4, 5]","I was a devout follower of this show for many years back in the mid 1980s when The Disney Channel ran this show.  It came on weekday afternoons at 12:30 & weknights at 11pm & saturdays at 6pm & occasionally 11pm.I couldn't get enough of this sitcom.  It was pure escapism.  Ozzie & Harriet is absolutely timeless in its appeal to fans of 1950s nostalgia & those who enjoy classic comedy at its best.  I have always thought David was much more appealing & sexier than Ricky, & thought June was far more attractive than Kris.  I was a Dave & June fan every bit as much as an Ozzie & Harriet fan.  Just the overall chemistry between Dave & June & Ozzie & Harriet was great to watch.I thought Ricky was so cute & adorable when he was younger on the show.  I wanted to squeeze his cheeks.  I thought he matured into a very attractive man as he got into his twenties.  David was simply more sophisticated than Ricky, & that appealed to me greatly & still does.One of the finest episodes in this set that comes to mind is Tutti Frutti Ice Cream - In which Ozzie has this huge craving for Tutti Futti Ice Cream & goes out in the middle of the night with Harriet to try & find a place open to buy some!I also loved the episode, David & The Teenager, in which a young teenager (Bernadette Withers, Bachelor Father's Ginger) in Dave's building has a crush on him.  Dave's married to June at this time. It's really cute!  I don't see it listed in this particular set though, which amazes me as it's one of the best episodes in my opinion, & 100 shows covers alot of ground!  But this is still an excellent addition to anyone's library & boasts the largest number of episodes contained in any set for this particular series.Ozzie & Harriet is one of those shows you can watch over & over again & never tire of its magic & it's also the type of show that can even make you forget about your cares for awhile.  I highly recommend this set to anyone.  I'm prejudiced, I'm an admittedly huge fan of Ozzie & Harriet & have been for over twenty years when I first discovered it on The Disney Channel.  Actually, when I was a teenager in the mid 1980s, my folks & I briefly lived in southern california & I recall Channel 5 (KTLA) doing a holiday retrospective of Ozzie & Harriet at christmas time that I'd never seen or heard about again.  Does anyone at all have any recollection of this?Anyway, I'd first heard of O&H; then & had remembered about them a couple of years later  when The Disney Channel began showing reruns, which is when I became a fan of the series.I hope the entire series becomes available in season sets at some stage, however, I DO recall an article in an old Disney Channel magazine where David (who was doing his documentary, Rick Nelson: A Brother Remembers)was quoted as saying Ozzie was a perfectionist & critical of himself in certain episodes, which ended up being a list of about a hundred or so where Ozzie would make a note saying ""Ozzie not good in this one"", & those were the particular episodes that David said he didn't include in The Disney package when the reruns were showing because it was out of respect for his father, which of course is understandable, which means I would think, that maybe in a nutshell that is an answer to those of you hoping to see a complete release someday of all episodes.  I myself would love nothing more than to see all 435 episodes restored & released, but am wondering if anyone can shed any potential light on the possibility of this actually coming to fruition.Anyway FIVE BIG STARS for this OZZIE & HARRIET DVD set!!!P.S. Now, all we need is Here Come The Nelsons on DVD.  I've got the VHS, but there's a restriction against copying it to DVD, so let's hope an official release of this is in the works as well! :-)  I'm a big fan of the old O&H; radio series as well, needless to say :-)",5,Ozzie & Harriet mega-marathon!,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,3844,"['was', 'devout', 'follower', 'show', 'many', 'years', 'back', 'mid', '1980s', 'when', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'ran', 'show', 'came', 'weekday', 'afternoons', '12:30', 'weknights', '11pm', 'saturdays', '6pm', 'occasionally', '11pm.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'sitcom', 'was', 'pure', 'escapism', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'absolutely', 'timeless', 'appeal', 'fans', '1950s', 'nostalgia', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'comedy', 'best', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'David', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'appealing', 'sexier', 'Ricky', 'thought', 'June', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'attractive', 'Kris', 'was', 'Dave', 'June', 'fan', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'fan', 'Just', 'overall', 'chemistry', 'Dave', 'June', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'was', 'great', 'watch.I', 'thought', 'Ricky', 'was', 'so', 'cute', 'adorable', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'show', 'wanted', 'squeeze', 'cheeks', 'thought', 'matured', 'very', 'attractive', 'man', 'got', 'twenties', 'David', 'was', 'simply', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Ricky', 'appealed', 'greatly', 'still', 'does.One', 'finest', 'episodes', 'set', 'mind', 'Tutti', 'Frutti', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'Ozzie', 'huge', 'craving', 'Tutti', 'Futti', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'out', 'middle', 'night', 'Harriet', 'try', 'find', 'place', 'open', 'buy', 'also', 'loved', 'episode', 'David', 'Teenager', 'young', 'teenager', 'Bernadette', 'Withers', 'Bachelor', 'Father', 'Ginger', 'Dave', 'building', 'crush', 'Dave', 'married', 'June', 'time', 'really', 'cute', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'listed', 'particular', 'set', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'opinion', '100', 'covers', 'alot', 'ground', 'still', 'excellent', 'addition', 'anyone', 'library', 'largest', 'number', 'episodes', 'contained', 'set', 'particular', 'series.Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'one', 'shows', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'never', 'tire', 'magic', 'also', 'type', 'show', 'can', 'even', 'make', 'forget', 'cares', 'awhile', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'prejudiced', ""'m"", 'admittedly', 'huge', 'fan', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'have', 'been', 'twenty', 'years', 'when', 'first', 'discovered', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Actually', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'mid', '1980s', 'folks', 'briefly', 'lived', 'southern', 'california', 'recall', 'Channel', '5', 'KTLA', 'doing', 'holiday', 'retrospective', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'christmas', 'time', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'again', 'anyone', 'have', 'recollection', 'Anyway', ""'d"", 'first', 'heard', 'O', 'H', 'then', 'had', 'remembered', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'began', 'showing', 'reruns', 'when', 'became', 'fan', 'series.I', 'hope', 'entire', 'series', 'available', 'season', 'sets', 'stage', 'however', 'DO', 'recall', 'article', 'old', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'magazine', 'where', 'David', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'documentary', 'Rick', 'Nelson', 'Brother', 'Remembers', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'Ozzie', 'was', 'perfectionist', 'critical', 'certain', 'episodes', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'list', 'hundred', 'so', 'where', 'Ozzie', 'would', 'make', 'note', 'saying', 'Ozzie', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'were', 'particular', 'episodes', 'David', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Disney', 'package', 'when', 'reruns', 'were', 'showing', 'was', 'respect', 'father', 'course', 'understandable', 'would', 'think', 'maybe', 'nutshell', 'answer', 'hoping', 'see', 'complete', 'release', 'someday', 'episodes', 'would', 'love', 'nothing', 'more', 'see', '435', 'episodes', 'restored', 'released', 'am', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'can', 'shed', 'potential', 'light', 'possibility', 'actually', 'coming', 'fruition.Anyway', 'FIVE', 'BIG', 'STARS', 'OZZIE', 'HARRIET', 'DVD', 'set', 'P.S', 'Now', 'need', 'Here', 'Come', 'Nelsons', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'got', 'VHS', 'restriction', 'copying', 'DVD', 'let', 'hope', 'official', 'release', 'works', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'old', 'O', 'H', 'radio', 'series', 'well', 'needless', 'say']",The Essential Ozzie & Harriet Collection

1085921,A13DRH017BAN4I,B000SBAVIW,Mark Wilsonwood,"[7, 7]","I received this as a Fathers' Day gift and have thoroughly enjoyed watching these episodes of a great old sitcom. For some reason, ""Ozzie and Harriet"" re-runs haven't been shown over the years as much as other programs of the era. I think I've seen every episode ever made of ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""Dick Van Dyke Show"", and ""Andy Griffith Show"". But almost all the episodes on this DVD set were new to me. So it wasn't a nostalgic experience so much as a discovery of a lost TV treasure.The DVD set contains roughly a fourth of the episodes from the long-running series. They seem to be a pretty good sample distribution from 1952-1966. (A few might be out of sequence; for example, Dave is married in one episode and seems to be single again in the next). And speaking of the boys' wives, June (Dave's real and TV wife) is seen in a handful of episodes on the later discs (once or twice as a different character before settling in as June); and Kris (Rick's real and TV wife) is seen in several episodes as well. Interestingly, the two girls never appear together in any of the episodes in the set.If the idea of a story in which the characters spend an entire sleepless night in a desperate, cravings-driven quest for tutti-frutti ice cream seems just too boring to you, steer clear of this DVD set. But if you believe that, in the hands of the right cast and writers, such an idea just might be charming and funny -- then get this set.

An excellent show that I had forgotten about until recently.

1085928,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B000SBAVIW,Robert Huggins,"[152, 153]","Let me begin this review by saying that this isn't the best looking DVD collection of ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" on the market; that honor goes toThe Best of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harrietcollection from Shout! Factory that was produced in cooperation with surviving members of the Nelson family, and which features the best looking transfers of the series as well as numerous extra features.  That said, this set from Mill Creek Entertainment certainly gives you a healthy serving of the series' run (100 episodes of a series total of 435) and represents the largest collection of Ozzie & Harriet episodes available on DVD in a single collection.  Incidentally, this is a greatly expanded version of Mill Creek's earlierOzzie & Harriet Classics (4pc)collection of 38 episodes.The episodes are not restored and very definitely of the audio/visual quality associated with public domain releases (which this collection is), but I've watched about half of the episodes in this collection and have to say that the vast majority of the episodes are highly watchable.  A few of the episodes are syndicated versions running as little as 20 minutes (ironically, the episode titled ""Be On Time"" has the 20 minute running time), but the majority are full length versions, many of which are complete with original commercials and network IDs and running in excess of 29 minutes.  By contrast, all of the episodes in the official collection from Shout! Factory are edited, syndicated versions running, on average, around 22 and a half minutes.  Rick Nelson fans will be delighted to know that most musical numbers are included in this set.  So in addition to seeing a great family comedy, you get a chance to see the evolution of one of rock & roll's early superstars.  It also appears that the episodes are in chronological order, suggesting that Mill Creek actually researched the series for this release (atypical for most companies releasing public domain material).The episodes are spread across 12 single-sided discs, with each disc containing eight to nine episodes and featuring a simple menu selection that allows you to either play all episodes or select the specific episode that you wish to view.  Each disc is housed in its own cardboard folder; in turn, the 12 discs are housed in a laminated cardboard package that has a full listing of the episode titles on the back of the box.  There are no DVD extras per se but, as mentioned above, the vast majority of the episodes contain original commercials and/or sponsor tags.  It's fun to watch the Nelson family hawk products for Kodak, Quaker Oats and others.  If there's a negative to this set, I suppose that it's the Mill Creek logo which appears briefly in the bottom right corner twice in each episode.  The good news is that it's relatively unobtrusive and really won't detract much from your viewing experience.  Viewers should also be aware that episodes from the show's 14th and final season were originally filmed in color; here they are presented in black & white.The fact that Mill Creek has been able to assemble 100 episodes of this beloved family comedy series at a very affordable price is commendable.  No other company has been able to bring this many episodes to the market in a single package.  What makes this set even better is the inclusion of a number of episodes from the show's earlier years.  Most of the Ozzie & Harriet collections of public domain episodes focus on the show's years from the 1960s when David and Ricky were in college, married, and later started their careers.  There are plenty of those episodes in this set, but the inclusion of so many episodes from the 1950s when the boys were younger really distinguishes this set from the other Ozzie & Harriet collections that are available and, as such, makes this the definitive collection to own . . . . . at least until such time that someone issues something better.This set is a must for fans of ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" and to those who appreciate warm-hearted family humor from a simpler time.  My rating on this is closer to **** & , just missing the full five stars due a few beat-up looking prints included in this set.  But, rest assured, you will not be disappointed if you purchase ""The Essential Ozzie & Harriet Collection.""",5,Amazing Collection of Ozzie & Harriet Episodes on DVD,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,4301,"['Let', 'begin', 'review', 'saying', ""n't"", 'best', 'looking', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Adventures', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'market', 'honor', 'toThe', 'Best', 'Adventures', 'Ozzie', 'Harrietcollection', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'was', 'produced', 'cooperation', 'surviving', 'members', 'Nelson', 'family', 'best', 'looking', 'transfers', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'extra', 'features', 'said', 'set', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'certainly', 'healthy', 'serving', 'series', 'run', '100', 'episodes', 'series', 'total', '435', 'largest', 'collection', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'available', 'DVD', 'single', 'collection', 'Incidentally', 'greatly', 'expanded', 'version', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'earlierOzzie', 'Harriet', 'Classics', '4pc', 'collection', '38', 'episodes.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'restored', 'very', 'definitely', 'audio/visual', 'quality', 'associated', 'public', 'domain', 'releases', 'collection', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'half', 'episodes', 'collection', 'have', 'say', 'vast', 'majority', 'episodes', 'are', 'highly', 'watchable', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'running', 'as', 'little', '20', 'minutes', 'ironically', 'episode', 'titled', 'Be', 'Time', '20', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'majority', 'are', 'full', 'length', 'versions', 'many', 'are', 'complete', 'original', 'commercials', 'network', 'IDs', 'running', 'excess', '29', 'minutes', 'contrast', 'episodes', 'official', 'collection', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'are', 'edited', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'running', 'average', '22', 'half', 'minutes', 'Rick', 'Nelson', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'know', 'most', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'included', 'set', 'So', 'addition', 'seeing', 'great', 'family', 'comedy', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'evolution', 'one', 'rock', 'roll', 'early', 'superstars', 'also', 'episodes', 'are', 'chronological', 'order', 'suggesting', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'actually', 'researched', 'series', 'release', 'atypical', 'most', 'companies', 'releasing', 'public', 'domain', 'material', '.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'spread', '12', 'single-sided', 'discs', 'disc', 'containing', 'eight', 'nine', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'simple', 'menu', 'selection', 'play', 'episodes', 'select', 'specific', 'episode', 'wish', 'view', 'disc', 'housed', 'own', 'cardboard', 'folder', 'turn', '12', 'discs', 'are', 'housed', 'laminated', 'cardboard', 'package', 'full', 'listing', 'episode', 'titles', 'back', 'box', 'are', 'DVD', 'extras', 'se', 'mentioned', 'vast', 'majority', 'episodes', 'contain', 'original', 'commercials', 'and/or', 'sponsor', 'tags', 'fun', 'watch', 'Nelson', 'family', 'hawk', 'products', 'Kodak', 'Quaker', 'Oats', 'others', 'negative', 'set', 'suppose', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'logo', 'briefly', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'twice', 'episode', 'good', 'news', 'relatively', 'unobtrusive', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'detract', 'much', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Viewers', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'aware', 'show', '14th', 'final', 'season', 'were', 'originally', 'filmed', 'color', 'here', 'are', 'presented', 'black', 'white.The', 'fact', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'been', 'able', 'assemble', '100', 'episodes', 'beloved', 'family', 'comedy', 'series', 'very', 'affordable', 'price', 'commendable', 'other', 'company', 'been', 'able', 'bring', 'many', 'episodes', 'market', 'single', 'package', 'What', 'set', 'even', 'better', 'inclusion', 'number', 'episodes', 'show', 'earlier', 'years', 'Most', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'collections', 'public', 'domain', 'episodes', 'focus', 'show', 'years', '1960s', 'when', 'David', 'Ricky', 'were', 'college', 'married', 'later', 'started', 'careers', 'are', 'plenty', 'episodes', 'set', 'inclusion', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', '1950s', 'when', 'boys', 'were', 'younger', 'really', 'set', 'other', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'collections', 'are', 'available', 'such', 'definitive', 'collection', 'own', 'least', 'such', 'time', 'someone', 'issues', 'something', 'better.This', 'set', 'must', 'fans', 'Adventures', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'who', 'appreciate', 'warm-hearted', 'family', 'humor', 'simpler', 'time', 'rating', 'closer', '****', 'just', 'missing', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'due', 'few', 'beat-up', 'looking', 'prints', 'included', 'set', 'rest', 'assured', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'Essential', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'Collection']",The Essential Ozzie & Harriet Collection
