Although a bit low on extras I was nonetheless very pleased.This is of course due to what is actually on the discs. This season is better (in my eyes) than the third, nearly as good as my favourite (namely the first 2 season).It contains some very funny episodes, especially the one with the gambling king had me and my brother laughing a lot.Anyway, if you know Ranma 1/2 you can't really go amiss with buying this set!",4,Excellent Ranma,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,540,"['set', 'par', 'other', '3', 'releases', 'Viz', 'so', 'far', 'quality', 'transfer', 'what', 'get', 'box', 'bit', 'low', 'extras', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'pleased.This', 'course', 'due', 'what', 'actually', 'discs', 'season', 'better', 'eyes', 'third', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'favourite', 'namely', 'first', '2', 'season', '.It', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'especially', 'one', 'gambling', 'king', 'had', 'brother', 'laughing', 'lot.Anyway', 'know', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'amiss', 'buying', 'set']",Ranma 1/2 - Outta Control - The Complete Fourth Season
720639,AG1ZRMHJLYXEE,B00006LPGU,M. Hammond,"[3, 3]","but better than what I've seen of the 1st season. Hard Battle had some great eps(particularly the ep where Ranma becomes a girl mentally as well as physically) so it's a hard act to follow, but most long-running series hit a rut or two. I actually prefer the new English male Ranma voice actor, but then I love him as Inu-Yasha also(So Viz is following Japan using the same voice actor for both roles). I understand where those who don't like the change are coming from--I always check both vocal tracks &amp; often prefer the Japanese actors. Heaven knows DBZ's changed enough actors &amp; I know we'll be hearing a new Excel on the 4th Volume of Excel Saga(When my daughter complains about the prospect, I point out there've been 3 English Sailor Moon actresses &amp; 3 Son Goku in DBZ, not counting DB)I don't care for Principal Kuno, although my daughter loved his bits(she also loves Happosai...).The new teacher ep was interesting &amp; the Ranma-gets-weak set is good. I've read 13 of the graphic novels so I know much of it's from the manga, but a few details were changed such as in the manga Principal Kuno offering the get-out-of-haircut-card to whoever located his long-lost son who is quickly revealed as Tatewaki Kuno. The game show ep was much better in the manga--the anime maybe is more like tv game shows, but the manga had a running sub-plot that the people running the contest didn't want anyone to win because they couldn't really afford the prize &amp; the contests were less annoying. Had they followed the manga closer this probably would have been a better season.",4,Not as good as Hard Battle,1041292800,"12 31, 2002",2002,1589,"['better', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', '1st', 'season', 'Hard', 'Battle', 'had', 'great', 'eps', 'particularly', 'ep', 'where', 'Ranma', 'girl', 'mentally', 'as', 'well', 'physically', 'hard', 'act', 'follow', 'most', 'long-running', 'series', 'hit', 'rut', 'two', 'actually', 'prefer', 'new', 'English', 'male', 'Ranma', 'voice', 'actor', 'then', 'love', 'Inu-Yasha', 'also', 'So', 'Viz', 'following', 'Japan', 'using', 'same', 'voice', 'actor', 'roles', 'understand', 'where', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'change', 'are', 'coming', 'always', 'check', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'amp', 'often', 'prefer', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'Heaven', 'DBZ', 'changed', 'enough', 'actors', 'amp', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hearing', 'new', 'Excel', '4th', 'Volume', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'When', 'daughter', 'prospect', 'point', 'out', 'there', ""'ve"", 'been', '3', 'English', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'amp', '3', 'Son', 'Goku', 'DBZ', 'not', 'counting', 'DB', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Principal', 'Kuno', 'daughter', 'loved', 'bits', 'also', 'Happosai', '.The', 'new', 'teacher', 'ep', 'was', 'interesting', 'amp', 'Ranma-gets-weak', 'set', 'good', ""'ve"", 'read', '13', 'graphic', 'novels', 'know', 'much', 'manga', 'few', 'details', 'were', 'changed', 'such', 'manga', 'Principal', 'Kuno', 'offering', 'get-out-of-haircut-card', 'whoever', 'located', 'long-lost', 'son', 'who', 'quickly', 'revealed', 'Tatewaki', 'Kuno', 'game', 'show', 'ep', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'manga', 'anime', 'maybe', 'more', 'like', 'tv', 'game', 'shows', 'manga', 'had', 'running', 'sub-plot', 'people', 'running', 'contest', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'win', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'afford', 'prize', 'amp', 'contests', 'were', 'less', 'annoying', 'Had', 'followed', 'manga', 'closer', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'season']",Ranma 1/2 - Outta Control - The Complete Fourth Season

It's funny, crazy, and likeable! ^__^ There are some very good breakout eps for Ranma in this one. And some very funny and GREAT eps for Ranma and Ryoga fans! (I am one) But I often read at places this is the season where the show lost some of it's edge. I don't think so,Ranma 1/2 to me gets funnier as the seasons go on. I also know Ranma got a different voice-over. Well the first Ranma voice-over did a WONDERFUL job! But the guy taking over Ranma also to me does a WONDERFUL job as well. True it might sound different but it is still Ranma and to me the new voice-over is doing just fine ^__^ (And I don't say that for most people taking over a role) Anyway GREAT season for Ranma I'm truly glad I got this season.

McAdams,"[3, 3]","I *LOVE* the Ranma 1/2 series, it is the series that officially launched me into the rabid ranks of the otaku (otaku = &quot;fan-boys&quot; for all you non-anim&eacute;-watching heathen out there).The reason I am rating this set with 4 stars instead of my standard 5 for anything Ranma, isn't because of the quality of the anim&eacute;. The reason is that Viz CHANGED the male Ranma voice actor for the English dub!  I could *NOT* believe they did this.  I have yet to be able to find out how and why this happened.  If the original voice actor walked out for whatever reason, then I guess Viz can be excused.  But if this was a case of egos or salaries interfering with a great product, then everyone at Viz should hang their heads in shame.Over-all though, you can just switch to the subtitled mode anyway (which I have now discovered I prefer over dubbed anyway) and there is no change.

There are a few good episodes (written by takahashi) and a lot of bad episodes (written by amateurs) and a few should-have-been-good episodes written by takahashi that were butchered to fit in one episode.And the art/animation quality?  Don't get me started.  The few episodes where they flashback to the beginning of the series painfully demonstrate how far the series has degraded.  In fact, if you really want to see how far this series falls short, watch 2-3 of the OVA's THEN watch this.  They were producing this season on the cheap, that's for sure.I got it, because I intend to collect the whole series.  Non-collectors should think twice.

720643,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B00006LPGU,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 1]","Ranma Saotome has overcome some pretty tricky obstacles in the past three seasons. Surely he can over come a brand new principal from Hawaii...right? The fourth season of Ranma ? really lives up to his subtitle `Outta Control', so much that it leaves you confused at the end.I enjoy the crazy antics that Ranma dished out so far, but as far as plot goes this new batch of episodes was a bit on the weak side. There are a few great parts in this season. The story where Ranma loses his powers is probably the most heartfelt. It really brings his feelings out especially to Akane. There is also an episode where Ranma comes clean to Shampoo and tells her he really doesn't love her (Don't expect Shampoo to take that so easily). Still, there are episodes that make you wonder why. Shampoo gets engaged to a giant cat; Tatewake Kuno dates Akane's sister Nabiki, crazy Azusa and yes, even Ranma! The other problem with this season is that there are way too many one hit wonder characters. Examples include, The Poker King, Hatta and the new school Coach (who leaves at the end of his debut episodes.Don't skip this season altogether, because there is plenty of wackiness, laughs and fun.
