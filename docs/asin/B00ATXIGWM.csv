1616798,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00ATXIGWM,C. Sawin,"[5, 5]","In ""Bangkok Revenge,"" a young boy witnesses his parents get shot to death by a group of masked men. He unmasks one of them and sees his face. The man shoots the boy in the temple because of it. The boy fights to survive (and struggles against logic) and somehow perseveres despite those same men attempting to finish the job. He's raised and trained by a master of Muay Thai boxing, but the trauma to his brain has removed any sign of human emotion in the boy. 20 years pass and the boy named Manit has grown into a man (played by Jon Foo). Absent of emotion, Manit is a martial arts monster and his sole objective is to plow through anyone who gets in the way of finding those that wronged him all those years ago.A guy shoots a little boy in the head at point blank and somehow that kid doesn't die? Life support or not, the exit wound on the other side of that kid's head should be the size of a jawbreaker. The nurse caring for young Manit takes him from the hospital because bad men keep trying to kill him. She drops him off with a man in a village because he ""knows the secrets of the plants."" This is never explained. You see the guy working Manit's muscles while he's unconscious, but plants never enter the equation. Does he know his way around herbs? Is he going to teach Manit how to garden? Will he feed Manit Miracle-Gro so he'll grow up big and strong? These are the important questions that are never answered.Young Manit sees a dog get hit by a car and suddenly gets inspired to train in martial arts. He trains in ankle deep water in what seems like ten years thanks to an awkward montage. Another ten years pass and Manit is now incredibly fit. He can shatter bamboo with a single punch; beat up dolls made of only twigs, and train really hard (it looks even harder since it's noticeably sped up). ""Bangkok Revenge"" seems to drag out the fight scenes as the first one is done in this clumsy and distorted first person perspective where you can hear Manit's heartbeat while the second is witnessed through only shadows bouncing around on a brick wall.Why do films like this force their actors to speak in English? It wouldn't be so bad if they sounded as good as Jon Foo does when he speaks, but it's obviously a second language to everyone else in the cast. The film also bounces around between the Thai and English languages for seemingly no reason at all. When Manit isn't kicking ass, he's exercising in Clara's (Caroline Ducey) living room or collecting cop badges for no specified purpose. That living room training scene is impressive on one hand since Jon Foo is obviously a talented martial artist, but the sound effects are so unnatural. Imagine someone with really baggy clothing just being obnoxious while it's windy outside. That sound over and over again is what plays during this scene.It's a shame the majority of ""Bangkok Revenge"" is so bad because the action scenes are really incredible. Jon Foo has a talent of making a spectacular fight sequence out of a really cramped space; the elevator, the car, and the subway. Nothing really seems to restrain this man. His martial arts skills seem to rival that of Tony Jaa's, but it just seems like Foo hasn't been able to find the right project to showcase them.Since Manit is incapable of showing emotion, everyone else takes note and decides not to show any sort of emotion in their line delivery. There's a sex scene that's a contender for the worst sex scene of the year (and perhaps ever) and the conclusion will leave you wondering what person would be satisfied with this version of revenge when they have the ability of shoving someone's face through every car window before actually reacting. ""Bangkok Revenge"" is chock full of bad acting and poor storytelling. The film is smart enough to keep it short and sweet and Jon Foo packs a hell of a punch (and kick and elbow and knee), but it still isn't enough to make ""Bangkok Revenge"" even remotely decent.",2,Bad English and random transvestites,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,3944,"['Bangkok', 'Revenge', 'young', 'boy', 'parents', 'get', 'shot', 'death', 'group', 'masked', 'men', 'one', 'face', 'man', 'boy', 'temple', 'boy', 'fights', 'survive', 'logic', 'perseveres', 'same', 'men', 'attempting', 'finish', 'job', 'raised', 'trained', 'master', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'boxing', 'trauma', 'brain', 'removed', 'sign', 'human', 'emotion', 'boy', '20', 'years', 'pass', 'boy', 'named', 'Manit', 'grown', 'man', 'played', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'Absent', 'emotion', 'Manit', 'martial', 'arts', 'monster', 'sole', 'objective', 'plow', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'finding', 'wronged', 'years', 'ago.A', 'guy', 'shoots', 'little', 'boy', 'head', 'point', 'blank', 'somehow', 'kid', ""n't"", 'die', 'Life', 'support', 'not', 'exit', 'wound', 'other', 'side', 'kid', 'head', 'should', 'be', 'size', 'jawbreaker', 'nurse', 'caring', 'young', 'Manit', 'hospital', 'bad', 'men', 'keep', 'trying', 'kill', 'drops', 'off', 'man', 'village', 'secrets', 'plants', 'never', 'explained', 'see', 'guy', 'working', 'Manit', 'muscles', 'unconscious', 'plants', 'never', 'enter', 'equation', 'know', 'way', 'herbs', 'going', 'teach', 'Manit', 'how', 'garden', 'Will', 'feed', 'Manit', 'Miracle-Gro', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'up', 'big', 'strong', 'are', 'important', 'questions', 'are', 'never', 'answered.Young', 'Manit', 'dog', 'get', 'hit', 'car', 'suddenly', 'inspired', 'train', 'martial', 'arts', 'ankle', 'deep', 'water', 'what', 'ten', 'years', 'thanks', 'awkward', 'montage', 'ten', 'years', 'pass', 'Manit', 'now', 'incredibly', 'fit', 'can', 'shatter', 'bamboo', 'single', 'punch', 'up', 'dolls', 'made', 'only', 'twigs', 'train', 'really', 'hard', 'even', 'harder', 'noticeably', 'sped', 'up', 'Bangkok', 'Revenge', 'drag', 'out', 'fight', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'done', 'clumsy', 'distorted', 'first', 'person', 'perspective', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'Manit', 'heartbeat', 'second', 'witnessed', 'only', 'bouncing', 'around', 'brick', 'wall.Why', 'do', 'films', 'force', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'sounded', 'as', 'good', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'when', 'obviously', 'second', 'language', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'film', 'also', 'around', 'Thai', 'English', 'languages', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'When', 'Manit', ""n't"", 'kicking', 'ass', 'exercising', 'Clara', 'Caroline', 'Ducey', 'living', 'room', 'collecting', 'cop', 'badges', 'specified', 'purpose', 'living', 'room', 'training', 'scene', 'impressive', 'one', 'hand', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'obviously', 'talented', 'martial', 'artist', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'unnatural', 'Imagine', 'someone', 'really', 'baggy', 'clothing', 'just', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'windy', 'outside', 'sound', 'over', 'again', 'what', 'scene.It', 'shame', 'majority', 'Bangkok', 'Revenge', 'so', 'bad', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'incredible', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'talent', 'making', 'spectacular', 'fight', 'sequence', 'really', 'cramped', 'space', 'elevator', 'car', 'subway', 'Nothing', 'really', 'restrain', 'man', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'seem', 'rival', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'just', 'like', 'Foo', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'right', 'project', 'showcase', 'them.Since', 'Manit', 'incapable', 'showing', 'emotion', 'everyone', 'else', 'note', 'not', 'show', 'sort', 'emotion', 'line', 'delivery', 'sex', 'scene', 'contender', 'worst', 'sex', 'scene', 'year', 'perhaps', 'ever', 'conclusion', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'satisfied', 'version', 'revenge', 'when', 'have', 'ability', 'shoving', 'someone', 'face', 'car', 'window', 'actually', 'reacting', 'Bangkok', 'Revenge', 'chock', 'full', 'bad', 'acting', 'poor', 'storytelling', 'film', 'smart', 'enough', 'keep', 'short', 'sweet', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'hell', 'punch', 'kick', 'elbow', 'knee', 'still', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'Bangkok', 'Revenge', 'even', 'remotely', 'decent']",Bangkok Revenge
1616799,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00ATXIGWM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Actor turned filmmaker Jean-Marc Mineo had worked on action his share of acting films.  From working on films such as """"Femme Fatale"" to coordinating action on TV series such as ""The Spear of Destiny"", Mineo has crafted his first martial arts film titled ""Bangkok Revenge"".Starring Jon Foo (""Tekken"", ""Street Fighter: Legacy"", ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration""), Caroline Ducey (""The Soul Keeper"", ""Romance"",  ""Handicap"") and Michael Cohen, ""Bangkok Revenge"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2013 courtesy of Well Go USA Entertainment.VIDEO:""Bangkok Revenge"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (16:9 widescreen).  For the most part, the film does look very good, especially since many shots are outdoors.  Despite being a low-budget film, the film looks good on Blu-ray.  Skintones are natural, I expected so major noise through the more darkened scenes but nothing terrible was noticeable nor did I see any significant artifacts or aliasing.  Picture quality was very good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Bangkok Revenge"" is presented in Thai and English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While the film is primarily dialogue and music driven, it's primarily a front and center channel affair. I didn't notice any major use of the surround channels or LFE.  While a large part of the film is English, unfortunately it's English that is hard to understand at times that you end up watching subtitles to find out what was trying to be said.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Bangkok Revenge"" comes with a trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:Does anyone remember the '80s martial arts film ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" with its bad acting, martial arts action and the film that probably introduced Jean-Claude Van Damme to viewers in America?Here comes ""Bangkok Revenge"" which features bad acting, Muay Thai Boxing and Jon Foo. But like ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" which you probably caught on HBO, you watched it probably many times because it was so bad. ""Bangkok Revenge"" makes you watch it because it's so bad,but yet it makes you laugh. It's one thing to watch a bad film that bores you, but when a bad film can make you laugh, then you know it's not that terrible. Of bad films, I probably would watch this film many times rather than watch a film like ""Strange Wilderness"" for a second time.Granted, this is not a film you watch for great acting but for the action. And it's a popcorn action flick that you just should not dwell on and ask why?For example, the film goes forward 20-years later but Manit who was probably 10 at the time looks more like in his younger 20&#8242;s.  While his ""mother"" is seen to age, the man who brings him back to life and trains him, looks the same.The film's pacing is off and its use of foreign actors speaking English makes the film one of the first films mostly spoken in English, where I had to have the English subtitles turned on.  The accents can be thick and even the delivered dialogue feels that the actors are trying their best to say their lines in English that it doesn't come off as natural.From the way the film ends (why it ends that way, with another character instead of the protagonist, was just bad), to its use of almost bad ominous music during a sex scene.  When the character could have been killed and shot to death, he manages to survive with no wound.  Typically in a film, they go to explain that a bullet hit something metal that blocked the bullet penetrating but we see Manit going down but is quickly back up.But let's eliminate the bad and think about the humor of the film, may it be intentional or not intentional.  Because Manit has no emotions, he says things that make him the ultimate smart ass.Clara asks Manit if he ever wanted a woman to hold him in her arms and all of a sudden he says, ""I can do that"" and starts having sex with her immediately (with the ominous music playing) and her being saddened that this man can not feel pleasure.  Obviously he has to feel something to get himself in the mood for sex.Even post-sex, he is seen giving her a pat on the shoulder and saying ""As for last night, it was great!"" with the biggest BS face you will ever see onscreen.But there are little things such as Manit fighting a group of thugs inside the train and seeing this guy trying to film with his cell phone who gets caught up in the fracas, he ends up kicking one of the guys and you can't help but laugh.So, there are a lot of interesting moments, dialogue and things that are flat out crazy in this film, but it's part of that charm that is reminiscent of '80s martial arts films.  Now, I don't know if filmmaker Jean-Marc Mineo set out trying to accomplish that but he did.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is good, audio was front and center-channel driven and there are no special features but a trailer.Overall, ""Bangkok Revenge"" resembles an '80s martial arts film.  Plenty of action, uneven pacing, bad acting, corny humor but it's one of those films that can be seen as ""So bad, it's good"" that you wouldn't mind watching it again.  Of the many terrible films out there, ""Bangkok Revenge"" is not terrible and it's far from being great or even good.  But I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of those cult martial arts films that people just watch over and over.  It may be the modern equivalent to ""No Retreat, No Surrender"".",3,"(2.5 stars) ""Bangkok Revenge"" resembles an '80s martial arts film.

1616803,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00ATXIGWM,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","Jon Foo's a good guy among the gen-x of action films, and more than anybody else, I get the impression that he's trying hard to make the most of his career and to impress people. His first starring vehicle,Tekken, was a mixed bag nevertheless highlighted by his martial performance, and his second solo outing, ""Bangkok Adrenaline"" here, is very similar in this equation. However, because this one has few stars in it besides him and no franchise to back it up, I believe that it's doomed to languish facelessly on the shelves of video stores. It's no help that other viewers may well judge it more harshly than I do, because while fun, this one's far from the perfect picture.The story: after the childhood assassination of his parents leaves him impervious to pain and emotion, a fully-grown and fully-trained Manit (Foo) finds himself on his way to avenge the deaths of his mother and father at the hands of corrupt policemen.In the movie, Manit's emotionless state is referred to as ataraxia, and I need to voice my amazement that no action star has played a character of similar affliction, since it provides an automatic excuse to not really need to act. Foo spends most of the time when he's not fighting walking around with his hands in his pockets, which is just about all he can do with this role. However, no one else in the cast is picking up the slack: virtually all of the Thai actors demonstrate difficulty with speaking English, and immediate co-stars Caroline Ducey (Romance) and Michael Cohen (Them) don't do much better. Additionally, the storyline and pacing end up being uneven: though there are some genuinely fun diversions like the incorporation of a crazy all-girl gang, the plot doesn't always feel like it's effectively building up to a climax, and sure enough, the final scenes feel kind of lackluster. It's good that the movie only runs about 80 minutes: I'm not sure how the filmmakers would have stretched things out for even another quarter hour.Featuring thirteen separate fight scenes, ""Bangkok Revenge"" is definitely the most ample platform to date for Foo to display his immense physical talents. At their best, the fight scenes are varied showcases for him, showing Foo capable of his great XMA stuff as well as grittier, tight-elbowed brawling. Most of his encounters are against groups of attackers, and at least one of these earns my ""very good"" rating. However, they have a tendency to fluctuate in quality, and a handful is ruined by those old eyesores of poor camerawork and choppy editing. Additionally - and we can probably blame stunt coordinator David ""Mad Dog"" Ismalone (Ong-Bak) for this - there are a couple instances wherein the choreography genuinely seems to be lifting from Tony Jaa's material. Now, Jaa does not have a copyright on any martial arts movement, but Jon Foo looks uncomfortable using a Thai boxing style and therefore the lift is mostly unflattering.The movie is definitely worth investigating for Jon's fans, but other viewers may feel that the world of Thailand-set films has better to offer than this. Were this the first movie for Foo to appear in, I wouldn't necessarily predict a bright future for him, but I remain hopeful that his future projects provide him with a better all-around platform.",3,"""I believe I have fallen into the hands of the most tasteless killers in Bangkok""",1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,3269,"['Jon', 'Foo', 'good', 'guy', 'gen-x', 'action', 'films', 'more', 'anybody', 'else', 'get', 'impression', 'trying', 'hard', 'make', 'most', 'career', 'impress', 'people', 'first', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'Tekken', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'nevertheless', 'highlighted', 'martial', 'performance', 'second', 'solo', 'outing', 'Bangkok', 'Adrenaline', 'here', 'very', 'similar', 'equation', 'However', 'one', 'few', 'stars', 'franchise', 'back', 'up', 'believe', 'doomed', 'languish', 'facelessly', 'shelves', 'video', 'stores', 'help', 'other', 'viewers', 'may', 'well', 'judge', 'more', 'harshly', 'do', 'fun', 'one', 'far', 'perfect', 'picture.The', 'story', 'childhood', 'assassination', 'parents', 'impervious', 'pain', 'emotion', 'fully-grown', 'fully-trained', 'Manit', 'Foo', 'way', 'avenge', 'deaths', 'mother', 'father', 'hands', 'corrupt', 'movie', 'Manit', 'emotionless', 'state', 'referred', 'ataraxia', 'need', 'voice', 'amazement', 'action', 'star', 'played', 'character', 'similar', 'affliction', 'automatic', 'excuse', 'not', 'really', 'need', 'act', 'Foo', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'not', 'fighting', 'walking', 'hands', 'pockets', 'just', 'about', 'all', 'can', 'do', 'role', 'However', 'one', 'else', 'cast', 'picking', 'up', 'slack', 'virtually', 'Thai', 'actors', 'demonstrate', 'difficulty', 'speaking', 'English', 'immediate', 'co-stars', 'Caroline', 'Ducey', 'Romance', 'Michael', 'Cohen', 'Them', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'Additionally', 'storyline', 'pacing', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'uneven', 'are', 'genuinely', 'fun', 'diversions', 'incorporation', 'crazy', 'all-girl', 'gang', 'plot', ""n't"", 'always', 'feel', 'effectively', 'building', 'up', 'climax', 'sure', 'enough', 'final', 'scenes', 'feel', 'kind', 'lackluster', 'good', 'movie', 'only', '80', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'stretched', 'things', 'out', 'even', 'quarter', 'hour.Featuring', 'thirteen', 'separate', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Bangkok', 'Revenge', 'definitely', 'most', 'ample', 'platform', 'date', 'Foo', 'display', 'immense', 'physical', 'talents', 'best', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'varied', 'showcases', 'showing', 'Foo', 'capable', 'great', 'XMA', 'stuff', 'as', 'well', 'grittier', 'tight-elbowed', 'brawling', 'Most', 'encounters', 'are', 'groups', 'attackers', 'least', 'one', 'earns', 'very', 'good', 'rating', 'However', 'have', 'tendency', 'fluctuate', 'quality', 'handful', 'ruined', 'old', 'eyesores', 'poor', 'camerawork', 'choppy', 'editing', 'Additionally', 'can', 'probably', 'blame', 'stunt', 'coordinator', 'David', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Ismalone', 'Ong-Bak', 'are', 'couple', 'instances', 'wherein', 'choreography', 'genuinely', 'be', 'lifting', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'material', 'Now', 'Jaa', 'not', 'have', 'copyright', 'martial', 'arts', 'movement', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'uncomfortable', 'using', 'Thai', 'boxing', 'style', 'therefore', 'lift', 'mostly', 'unflattering.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'investigating', 'Jon', 'fans', 'other', 'viewers', 'may', 'feel', 'world', 'Thailand-set', 'films', 'better', 'offer', 'Were', 'first', 'movie', 'Foo', 'appear', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'predict', 'bright', 'future', 'remain', 'hopeful', 'future', 'projects', 'provide', 'better', 'all-around', 'platform']",Bangkok Revenge

The writing cares nothing about the substance in between action scenes and just try's to suffer through the inconvenience of having to bother itself with the non-action scenes. One of the more annoying parts of the movie are that every new character spills their guts as soon as they meet the main character within seconds of meeting him and after he's only said his name and/or asked a single question. The seoond item that was quite annoying, is that every single actor is devoting 110% to overtly attempting to act as cool as possible in every scene. For me, the movie had me saying ""Really?"" a lot, and I only watched the entire film because I tend to keep watching movies/shows that I feel are train wrecks and want to see if it can really get any worse.

1616806,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00ATXIGWM,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","If you have seen &#8220;Tekken,&#8221; a film adaptation of video game, you may remember the name of Jon Foo, who played the hero Jin Kazama. I didn&#8217;t like the film very much, but thought his martial arts skills were impressive. Now Jon Foo is back in &#8220;Rebirth,&#8221; a French/Thai action film, as a vengeful hero with unique traits.The story is simple. John Foo is Manit, a young deadly martial arts fighter whose parents were brutally murdered when he was only a child. Marit, who witnessed the killing, was shot in the head by the criminal, but survived miraculously. Because of the serious wound, however, Manit &#8220;has no feelings.&#8221; That is, he walks, talks and fights without any emotional reaction.The idea is interesting, but writer/director Jean-Marc Min&eacute;o is not really interested in developing it. After all &#8220;Rebirth&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Bangkok Renaissance&#8221; or &#8220;Bangkok Revenge&#8221;) is an action movie and the film provides lots of action. Action sequences are reasonable, although more lighting and less editing would have made them better. You know Jon Foo can do action, so why don&#8217;t you let him show what he can do in one continuous take?I didn&#8217;t mind the film&#8217;s incoherent and confusing storytelling (though the ending needs improvement). I did mind much the too fast editing that frequently undermines the action scenes. &#8220;Rebirth&#8221; is a solid low-budget action movie that could have been much better with more budget and more effective choreography.",3,(2.5 STARS) So-so Low-Budget Action with Impossible Story and Lots of Fighting,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1554,"['have', 'seen', '8220', 'Tekken', '8221', 'film', 'adaptation', 'video', 'game', 'may', 'remember', 'name', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'who', 'played', 'hero', 'Jin', 'Kazama', 'didn', '8217', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'thought', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'were', 'impressive', 'Now', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'back', '8220', 'Rebirth', '8221', 'French/Thai', 'action', 'film', 'vengeful', 'hero', 'unique', 'traits.The', 'story', 'simple', 'John', 'Foo', 'Manit', 'young', 'deadly', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighter', 'parents', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'child', 'Marit', 'who', 'witnessed', 'killing', 'was', 'shot', 'head', 'criminal', 'survived', 'miraculously', 'serious', 'wound', 'however', 'Manit', '8220', 'feelings.', '8221', 'talks', 'fights', 'emotional', 'reaction.The', 'idea', 'interesting', 'writer/director', 'Jean-Marc', 'Min', 'eacute', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'developing', '8220', 'Rebirth', '8221', 'also', 'known', '8220', 'Bangkok', 'Renaissance', '8221', '8220', 'Bangkok', 'Revenge', '8221', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'lots', 'action', 'Action', 'sequences', 'are', 'reasonable', 'more', 'lighting', 'less', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'know', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'can', 'do', 'action', 'so', 'why', 'don', '8217', 'let', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'continuous', 'take', 'didn', '8217', 'mind', 'film', '8217', 'incoherent', 'confusing', 'storytelling', 'ending', 'needs', 'improvement', 'did', 'mind', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'editing', 'frequently', 'action', 'scenes', '8220', 'Rebirth', '8221', 'solid', 'low-budget', 'action', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'budget', 'more', 'effective', 'choreography']",Bangkok Revenge
