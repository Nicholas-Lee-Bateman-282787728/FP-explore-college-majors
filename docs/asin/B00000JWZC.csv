508325,A2Z9AZNVWKCZN6,B00000JWZC,AZNmovieFan,"[19, 19]","While the movie overtly revolves around Kelly Chen's character--as she deals with lost love and a deadly illness--the movie really depends upon Takeshi Kaneshiro's absolutely heartbreaking role as the perpetually lost, immensely lonely, and utterly eccentric and quirky character ""Worm,"" who spends his life helping people find their lost items (real and imaginary). While Kelly Chen and Kaneshiro usually have zero chemistry, this is one movie where they are perfectly cast opposite each other: Kelly Chen is withdrawn and troubled while Kaneshiro is youthful, childlike, and always willing to reach out. The movie--a quest narrative--is a wonderful gem about love, mortality, love lost, and immortality. If you are a fan of Kaneshiro, then you will recognize the Kaneshiro of ""Fallen Angels"" in this movie--he is the hurt boy next door, whose lips quiver with pain, but they twist quickly into a genuine smile at the sight of a ballon floating across the sky. Watch it for Kaneshiro! (Oh, and he looks hella good as usual. Duh.)",5,Takeshi Kaneshiro will make your heart melt,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,1030,"['movie', 'overtly', 'around', 'Kelly', 'Chen', 'character', 'lost', 'love', 'deadly', 'illness', 'movie', 'really', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'absolutely', 'heartbreaking', 'role', 'perpetually', 'lost', 'immensely', 'lonely', 'utterly', 'eccentric', 'quirky', 'character', 'Worm', 'who', 'life', 'helping', 'people', 'find', 'lost', 'items', 'real', 'imaginary', 'Kelly', 'Chen', 'Kaneshiro', 'usually', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'opposite', 'other', 'Kelly', 'Chen', 'withdrawn', 'troubled', 'Kaneshiro', 'youthful', 'childlike', 'always', 'willing', 'reach', 'out', 'movie', 'quest', 'narrative', 'wonderful', 'gem', 'love', 'mortality', 'love', 'lost', 'immortality', 'are', 'fan', 'Kaneshiro', 'then', 'will', 'recognize', 'Kaneshiro', 'Fallen', 'Angels', 'movie', 'hurt', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'lips', 'quiver', 'pain', 'twist', 'quickly', 'genuine', 'smile', 'sight', 'ballon', 'floating', 'sky', 'Watch', 'Kaneshiro', 'Oh', 'hella', 'good', 'usual', 'Duh']",N/A

It is a wonderful film.It is a very well acted bittersweet romance which connects on many levels without too much melodrama.Without giving too much of the plot away it is a story of girl meets boy, girl loses boy and hires anew boy to find the old boy.

508328,A38KM5E13L8BXB,B00000JWZC,"J. Scheppler ""Vampire fanatic""","[4, 5]","""Lost and Found"" is a gem among Hong Kong movies, one that sneaks up on you and leaves a lasting impression. Kelly Chen stars as Lam, the entitled daughter of a wealthy businessman, who should have the world as her oyster. One big problem: she has leukemia. A chance encounter with That Worm, enchantingly played by Takeshi Kaneshiro at his most adorable, turns Lam's life around. Specializing in recovering lost items, Mr. Lost and Found takes on his trickiest case to date: finding Lam's lost hope, in the form of a handsome Scottish-Chinese sailor on whom Lam has pinned her hopes of finding magic. As Lam and Worm work together to locate her sailor (convincing played by Michael Wong), a friendship develops that sneaks up on Lam, much as the movie sneaks up on the viewer. Beautifully filmed in both Hong Kong and Scotland, ""Lost and Found"" was cited for Chen's realistic portrayal of a woman dealing with cancer, and her struggle with the disease is indeed one of her best performances ever. But Kaneshiro is the heart and soul of this movie, creating a hero you will root for from start to finish. He had already proved himself an adept actor in Wong Kar Wei's ""Chungking Express"" and ""Fallen Angels,"" but in ""Lost and Found"" he cemented his reputation as an actor who can make you laugh and break your heart at the same time.",5,"Beautiful, quirky love story",1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,1333,"['Lost', 'Found', 'gem', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'movies', 'one', 'up', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Kelly', 'Chen', 'Lam', 'entitled', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'world', 'oyster', 'One', 'big', 'problem', 'leukemia', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Worm', 'enchantingly', 'played', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'most', 'adorable', 'Lam', 'life', 'around', 'Specializing', 'recovering', 'lost', 'items', 'Mr.', 'Lost', 'Found', 'trickiest', 'case', 'date', 'finding', 'Lam', 'lost', 'hope', 'form', 'handsome', 'Scottish-Chinese', 'sailor', 'whom', 'Lam', 'pinned', 'hopes', 'finding', 'magic', 'Lam', 'Worm', 'work', 'together', 'locate', 'sailor', 'convincing', 'played', 'Michael', 'Wong', 'friendship', 'up', 'Lam', 'much', 'movie', 'up', 'viewer', 'Beautifully', 'filmed', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Scotland', 'Lost', 'Found', 'was', 'cited', 'Chen', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'dealing', 'cancer', 'struggle', 'disease', 'indeed', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'Kaneshiro', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'creating', 'hero', 'will', 'root', 'start', 'finish', 'had', 'already', 'proved', 'adept', 'actor', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wei', 'Chungking', 'Express', 'Fallen', 'Angels', 'Lost', 'Found', 'cemented', 'reputation', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'break', 'heart', 'same', 'time']",N/A

You know, I hear or see something like, &#34;oh, this must be great, it's an academy award winner ... or nominated, or something like that... and they normally ALWAYS suck.  I mean, if you play by A CERTAIN FORMAT  AND SET OF RULES,  then you will get nominated or win one of these THINGS.  But this movie is actually real good that even an academy award judge would love (I normally hate movies like this). Superb acting, story, etc.  A true Gem of a movie.

Takeshi Kaneshiro is one of my favorite actors, so I might be a little biased but I thought that this was a wonderfully sweet story about finding love in the strangest places.  Kelly Chen plays a the daughter of a wealthy man who owns ships?  She is  suffering from a sickness that she refuses to fully acknowledge, but while  working on one of her father's ships, finds herself falling for one of the  sailors, a half Irish, half Chinese sailor whose hometown holds the story  of an almost enchanted burial ground.  The sailor however disappears,  without so much as a word, leaving Chen in a state of confusion as to  whether or not this man was the only person who could help her through her  situation.  In comes Takeshi Kaneshiro, who plays 'Worm', a man who claims  he can find anything and everything, and has built a business around it.  Without any other options available to her Chen hooks up with Kaneshiro to  find the Sailor...but if she finds him will she still have the same  feelings?  I thought this movie was enchanting, I am also a hopeless  romantic.  Within Kaneshiro's 'Lost and Found' business their are a variety  of character's, a handicapped secretary, with what seems like a vicious  mother and the children who play outside his door, not to mention others.  This movie (which others may claim corny) tugged at my heart.  I give it  three stars to say that it's probably not the best movie you'll ever see,  but I liked it enough to give it 5 stars and recommend it whole-heartedly.  It's a must see for Takeshi fans.",3,So Sweet,951696000,"02 28, 2000",2000,1582,"['know', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'biased', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'sweet', 'story', 'finding', 'love', 'strangest', 'places', 'Kelly', 'Chen', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'ships', 'suffering', 'sickness', 'fully', 'acknowledge', 'working', 'one', 'father', 'ships', 'falling', 'one', 'sailors', 'half', 'Irish', 'half', 'Chinese', 'sailor', 'hometown', 'story', 'almost', 'enchanted', 'burial', 'ground', 'sailor', 'however', 'so', 'much', 'word', 'leaving', 'Chen', 'state', 'confusion', 'not', 'man', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'situation', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'who', ""'Worm"", 'man', 'who', 'can', 'find', 'anything', 'everything', 'built', 'business', 'other', 'options', 'available', 'Chen', 'up', 'Kaneshiro', 'find', 'Sailor', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'feelings', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'enchanting', 'am', 'also', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'Kaneshiro', ""'Lost"", 'Found', 'business', 'are', 'variety', 'character', 'handicapped', 'secretary', 'what', 'vicious', 'mother', 'children', 'who', 'play', 'door', 'not', 'mention', 'others', 'movie', 'others', 'may', 'claim', 'corny', 'tugged', 'heart', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'say', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'liked', 'enough', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'recommend', 'whole-heartedly', 'must', 'see', 'Takeshi', 'fans']",N/A
