866687,A3TSJ46UGNT3QZ,B0006FO9HY,K.,"[17, 17]","I am amazed that with all the new and glossy DVDs we own, that The White Seal is such a huge hit with my 4 year old daughter.  She's never asked to watch the new computer animated Care Bears movie or the colorful My Little Pony movie over and over like this one.  She loves the white seal and is interested in the story.  I originally bought this, Mowgli's Brothers, and Rikki Tikki Tavi because Rikki was a HUGE favorite with my 1st grade class decades ago when I was little.  So when my daughter, wanting something new, went through my DVD collection and asked to watch these stories, I was curious how they'd hold up next to all the new kid stuff.  But it is facinating how classics never die and will be forever loved by children no matter how out of date they look.  This is definitely old style animation and not shiny and glossy like some of the Disney clean ups, but it is is clear enough and a joy to watch-- great story and narration.  No sarcasm or crazy weird animated segments-- just a good straight forward story.",5,My 4 year old loves it!,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,1027,"['am', 'amazed', 'new', 'glossy', 'DVDs', 'own', 'White', 'Seal', 'such', 'huge', 'hit', '4', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'never', 'asked', 'watch', 'new', 'computer', 'animated', 'Care', 'Bears', 'movie', 'colorful', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'movie', 'one', 'white', 'seal', 'interested', 'story', 'originally', 'bought', 'Mowgli', 'Brothers', 'Rikki', 'Tikki', 'Tavi', 'Rikki', 'was', 'HUGE', 'favorite', '1st', 'grade', 'class', 'decades', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'So', 'when', 'daughter', 'wanting', 'something', 'new', 'went', 'DVD', 'collection', 'asked', 'watch', 'stories', 'was', 'curious', 'how', ""'d"", 'hold', 'up', 'next', 'new', 'kid', 'stuff', 'facinating', 'how', 'classics', 'never', 'die', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'loved', 'children', 'matter', 'how', 'date', 'look', 'definitely', 'old', 'style', 'animation', 'not', 'shiny', 'glossy', 'Disney', 'clean', 'ups', 'clear', 'enough', 'joy', 'watch', 'great', 'story', 'narration', 'sarcasm', 'crazy', 'weird', 'animated', 'segments', 'just', 'good', 'straight', 'forward', 'story']",N/A
866688,A2NLIB986TEESZ,B0006FO9HY,L. M Young,"[20, 21]","Of the three half-hour Jungle Book adaptations that Chuck Jones did in the 1980s, this is undoubtedly the best, the story of Kotick, the white seal who learns about the world, including man's hunting of his brethren, and searches for a place where the seals can live unmolested. This has Jones' signature style about it, but is immensely true to the Kipling story, which is narrated by Roddy McDowall, and a highlight of the production is Dean Elliot's beautiful score, adapted from Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.Along with Kotick's story, included on this disk is Jones' The Cricket in Times Square, a faithful adaptation of the George Selden children's novel that has not been out of print since its original publication. It's the charming story of Chester, a country cricket who finds a new home in the Times Square subway station in NYC and who discovers he can play any musical piece he hears once. Violinist Israel Baker provides Chester's unique ""voice.""This DVD is practically perfect. There are some dust specks and flecks visible; however the colors and lines are bright and clean and the sound is good. The only downside to this DVD is the interminable previews that you are automatically subjected to. Hint: pressing the menu button on your DVD remote won't help, but once the previews start, you CAN skip through them by pressing the chapter button until you get to the actual menu.",5,Kotick is a Winner!!,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,1392,"['three', 'half-hour', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'adaptations', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'did', '1980s', 'undoubtedly', 'best', 'story', 'Kotick', 'white', 'seal', 'who', 'world', 'including', 'man', 'hunting', 'brethren', 'searches', 'place', 'where', 'seals', 'can', 'live', 'unmolested', 'Jones', 'signature', 'style', 'immensely', 'true', 'Kipling', 'story', 'narrated', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'highlight', 'production', 'Dean', 'Elliot', 'beautiful', 'score', 'adapted', 'Beethoven', 'Sixth', 'Symphony.Along', 'Kotick', 'story', 'included', 'disk', 'Jones', 'Cricket', 'Times', 'Square', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'George', 'Selden', 'children', 'novel', 'not', 'been', 'print', 'original', 'publication', 'charming', 'story', 'Chester', 'country', 'cricket', 'who', 'new', 'home', 'Times', 'Square', 'subway', 'station', 'NYC', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'musical', 'piece', 'once', 'Violinist', 'Israel', 'Baker', 'Chester', 'unique', 'voice', 'DVD', 'practically', 'perfect', 'are', 'dust', 'specks', 'flecks', 'visible', 'however', 'colors', 'lines', 'are', 'bright', 'clean', 'sound', 'good', 'only', 'downside', 'DVD', 'interminable', 'previews', 'are', 'automatically', 'subjected', 'Hint', 'pressing', 'menu', 'button', 'DVD', 'remote', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'once', 'previews', 'start', 'CAN', 'skip', 'pressing', 'chapter', 'button', 'get', 'actual', 'menu']",N/A
