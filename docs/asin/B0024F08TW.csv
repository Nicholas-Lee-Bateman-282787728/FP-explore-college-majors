She is just perfect as the strong, somewhat harried mom trying to navigate all the unconventional changes life has thrown at her and her family.By season 6, Cheyenne and Van have matured into more responsible adults, but are still flaky and endearing enough to deliver many of the show's laughs and satisfy fans who loved the innocent airheads of season 1.The Brock and Barbara Jean story line was less satisfying to me -- I wish they hadn't experienced QUITE so much conflict in their marriage throughout so many seasons, but the implication by the end is that they will work it out and that they love each other, so that's good.Barbara Jean and Reba are always delightful together.  And it is wonderful to have Kira back, as deadpan as ever, getting ready to go off into the world in her own way (despite Reba's efforts to control her).Reba is my favorite part of this sitcom, I must admit.  She is pragmatic and funny and dispenses wisdom and sarcasm as needed.  If you have put off watching this show because it stars ""that country music singer"", I urge you to forget anything you've ever thought you knew about Reba McIntire and look at her work with fresh eyes.She has excellent comedic timing and is so appealing in ""Reba"", and really pulls the whole show together with her contagious energy and enthusiasm. I hope at some point we are able to see her again in another sitcom.Regarding appropriateness for children, well, I do let my kids watch it and they adore it, but the show may not be appropriate for all families, due to the adult situations it contains. The show contains frank and sometimes irreverant references to sex, teen pregnancy, mistresses, infidelity, skipping school, etc... And there is mild swearing too. Nevertheless, I think the show really emphasizes the most important family values -- loving and supporting each other, struggling to live with the consequences of your actions, and figuring out how to live a good, responsible life even when things don't go exactly like you planned. And it does all this in a hilarious way.I hope Season 6 includes some extras like the Season 1 DVDs did, perhaps some more commentary from the actors or some more outtakes.

""Reba"" & thought ""Oh yeah...I'd heard she had a tv show"" but never caught it during it's original airing. And said ""What the heck,why not give it a shot?"" I have been hooked on this show ever since!! All the characters seem to blend together flawlessly & I never would have thought that such an established music artist would have such great comedic timing!

The last season was a little different in comparison to the first five seasons, but it was still good. Barbara Jean considerably changed and Cheyenne and Van were growing up, which brought a considerable amount of change to the last season. Kelly Clarkson guest starred in one of the episodes. I was glad that the last season was finally released on DVD.",5,Great show,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,443,"[""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'why', 'Reba', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'such', 'amazing', 'show', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'comparison', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'Barbara', 'Jean', 'considerably', 'changed', 'Cheyenne', 'Van', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'brought', 'considerable', 'amount', 'change', 'last', 'season', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', 'guest', 'starred', 'one', 'episodes', 'was', 'glad', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD']",Reba: Season 6

I have every Season of Reba and love them all. I bought them from Amazon.com and always got them at a good price. This is a funny family show that your whole family can watch together. Reba is a very good actress and so funny. She is the whole package. I always have a good experience with Amazon.com buying my DVDs. Good prices and shipping is prompt. I recomend these DVDs to anyone who wants some good clean tv shows that are fun to watch over and over.,5,Reba Season 6 on DVD,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,600,"['very', 'funny', 'TV', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'chair', 'love', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'funny', 'tv', 'shows', 'DVD', 'anytime', 'want', 'have', 'Season', 'Reba', 'love', 'bought', 'Amazon.com', 'always', 'got', 'good', 'price', 'funny', 'family', 'show', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'Reba', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'so', 'funny', 'whole', 'package', 'always', 'have', 'good', 'experience', 'Amazon.com', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'Good', 'prices', 'shipping', 'prompt', 'recomend', 'DVDs', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'clean', 'tv', 'shows', 'are', 'fun', 'watch']",Reba: Season 6
