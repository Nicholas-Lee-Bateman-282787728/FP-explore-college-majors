1344583,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B003FSTN7U,Amanda,"[215, 239]","Ironically enough, I've had a tumultuous relationship with The Tudors ever since it first started. It was an odd, kind of on-again, off-again relationship that ranged from near-fanatic fandom to downright apathy. I was a fan of Tudor historical fiction novels before the show began, and was more than ecstatic when I heard that Showtime was bringing the infamous Henry VIII to the screen with his many wives.Sadly, the series didn't always deliver for me. The biggest issue for me, especially in the first season, was the incredible number of historical inaccuracies. Even though this always bugged me throughout the entire series' run, I had to just put it aside and accept the fact that this show is a Hollywood-ized version of Henry VIII's reign. Perhaps the aspect that got me through were the lush sets, impeccable art direction and absolutely gorgeous period costumes and accessories (especially on all of Henry's queens) -even though the costumes were more like Tudor style mixed with modern couture influences (okay, they looked cool).In season four -titled by Showtime as ""The Final Seduction"" -Henry deals with war with France, lingering religious issues, his own fading health and of course, wives five and six -Katherine Howard and Catherine Parr, respectively. By this point, of course, Henry should be very rotund (300 pounds) and nearing the end of his life. Even though Jonathan Rhys Myers does get the aging treatment in the final episodes and they try to dress him up in large, heavy clothing to make him look a little bigger it's doesn't quite work-though it's at least something.The season, overall, is relatively entertaining, though some episodes are better than others. The first half deals primarily with the young Katherine Howard, her affair with Thomas Culpepper (and Lady Rochford's well-documented involvement), the oddly included misadventures of Lord Surrey (a supposed distant relative of Katherine, who is a boring and pointless character) and Henry's continued political troubles. While I didn't find Kitty Howard particularly likable, Tamzin Merchant brings a strong liveliness to the character and emphasizes her age, her questionable moral character, and the fact that she is a completely inept queen.After beheading poor Katherine Howard, the married Lady Latimer (Catherine Parr) grabs Henry's attention. Once her husband dies, she reluctantly marries Henry, and decides to use her new position to advance her strongly Protestant beliefs. Henry, meanwhile, departs to France for war and Catherine dodges accusations of heresy. After the war is over, Henry's health starts to decline until he dies.The highlight of this season should have been the much-anticipated and strongly rumored ""dream sequence"" in the final episode that would feature Henry's deceased wives. Though this ended up being somewhat disappointing (only three of the wives appeared), it was good to see some of the ladies return to Henry's life at the end, but it just wasn't enough. The fact that I felt let down by this, as well as the somewhat anti-climatic ending, left me with an unsatisfied feeling at the end that even made me wonder why I had spent all of my time watching the show. You know what would have made this finale better? More Anne Boleyn -okay, maybe not, but I've seriously missed Natalie Dormer since she was knocked off at the end of season two. Not only was she a wonderful actress, but she portrayed a strong and compelling Anne who stands as the strongest and more interesting of Henry's wives, stealing the show in every scene she was in.Thus ended my strange relationship with Showtime's The Tudors. Even though I had my doubts, I kept with it until the very end, and, unfortunately, wasn't satisfied but have to admit -journey getting there was entertaining and wonderfully done.",3,And so Henry's reign ends...,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,3815,"['Ironically', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'had', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Tudors', 'ever', 'first', 'started', 'was', 'odd', 'kind', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'ranged', 'near-fanatic', 'fandom', 'downright', 'apathy', 'was', 'fan', 'Tudor', 'historical', 'fiction', 'novels', 'show', 'began', 'was', 'more', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'heard', 'Showtime', 'was', 'bringing', 'infamous', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'screen', 'many', 'wives.Sadly', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'deliver', 'biggest', 'issue', 'especially', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'incredible', 'number', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Even', 'always', 'bugged', 'entire', 'series', 'run', 'had', 'just', 'put', 'aside', 'accept', 'fact', 'show', 'Hollywood-ized', 'version', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'reign', 'Perhaps', 'aspect', 'got', 'were', 'lush', 'sets', 'impeccable', 'art', 'direction', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'period', 'costumes', 'accessories', 'especially', 'Henry', 'queens', '-even', 'costumes', 'were', 'more', 'like', 'Tudor', 'style', 'mixed', 'modern', 'couture', 'influences', 'okay', 'looked', 'cool', 'season', 'four', '-titled', 'Showtime', 'Final', 'Seduction', '-Henry', 'deals', 'war', 'France', 'lingering', 'religious', 'issues', 'own', 'fading', 'health', 'course', 'five', 'six', '-Katherine', 'Howard', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'respectively', 'point', 'course', 'Henry', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'rotund', '300', 'pounds', 'nearing', 'end', 'life', 'Even', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Myers', 'get', 'aging', 'treatment', 'final', 'episodes', 'try', 'dress', 'up', 'large', 'heavy', 'clothing', 'make', 'look', 'little', 'bigger', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work-though', 'least', 'something.The', 'season', 'overall', 'relatively', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'first', 'half', 'deals', 'primarily', 'young', 'Katherine', 'Howard', 'affair', 'Thomas', 'Culpepper', 'Lady', 'Rochford', 'well-documented', 'involvement', 'oddly', 'included', 'misadventures', 'Lord', 'Surrey', 'supposed', 'distant', 'relative', 'Katherine', 'who', 'boring', 'pointless', 'character', 'Henry', 'continued', 'political', 'troubles', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Kitty', 'Howard', 'particularly', 'likable', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'strong', 'liveliness', 'character', 'age', 'questionable', 'moral', 'character', 'fact', 'completely', 'inept', 'queen.After', 'beheading', 'poor', 'Katherine', 'Howard', 'married', 'Lady', 'Latimer', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'grabs', 'Henry', 'attention', 'husband', 'dies', 'reluctantly', 'Henry', 'decides', 'use', 'new', 'position', 'advance', 'strongly', 'Protestant', 'beliefs', 'Henry', 'meanwhile', 'departs', 'France', 'war', 'Catherine', 'accusations', 'heresy', 'war', 'Henry', 'health', 'decline', 'dies.The', 'highlight', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much-anticipated', 'strongly', 'rumored', 'dream', 'sequence', 'final', 'episode', 'would', 'feature', 'Henry', 'deceased', 'wives', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'only', 'three', 'wives', 'appeared', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'ladies', 'return', 'Henry', 'life', 'end', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'fact', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'as', 'well', 'somewhat', 'anti-climatic', 'ending', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'feeling', 'end', 'even', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'had', 'spent', 'all', 'time', 'watching', 'show', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'finale', 'better', 'More', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', '-okay', 'maybe', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seriously', 'missed', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'was', 'knocked', 'off', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'compelling', 'Anne', 'who', 'strongest', 'more', 'interesting', 'Henry', 'wives', 'stealing', 'show', 'scene', 'was', 'in.Thus', 'ended', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Showtime', 'Tudors', 'Even', 'had', 'doubts', 'kept', 'very', 'end', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'have', 'admit', '-journey', 'getting', 'there', 'was', 'entertaining', 'wonderfully', 'done']",N/A

1344590,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B003FSTN7U,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 2]","England, 1540. King Henry VIII has married Catherine Howard and seems to have finally achieved a level of happiness. The execution of Thomas Cromwell has left the government firmly cowed by Henry and the religious Reformation of the country in his hands. However, Catherine's past is colourful and she soon finds old 'friends' creeping out of the woodwork, determined to use her to their own advancement. When Catherine's flighty and irresponsible behaviour irritates and distances Henry, she also finds herself drawn into a dangerous affair.The fourth and final season of The Tudors picks up with Henry VIII on his fifth and penultimate wife and covers the last seven years of his life. Aside from the controversial life and death of Catherine Howard, this period is most notable for Henry's decision to invade France and besiege Boulogne. These elements are characterised in the TV series as a form of mid-life crisis: all it's lacking is the decision to buy a Harley or an impractical and overpriced open-topped convertible. This is an amusing idea but also one that lends itself to an air of melancholy: as Henry's old leg wound worsens he knows his death is coming and he sets about preparing for it. As old friends and allies also start passing, Henry is forced to consider his life and accomplishments, exemplified in the final episode when he starts having visions of his dead wives and questions whether he was right to divorce or execute them.As with the previous seasons, The Tudors maintains a certain watchability in spite of its numerous problems and deviations from history. However, the series has definitely suffered from the loss of James Frain as Cromwell. David O'Hara (despite being only four years younger than the actor who played his father in Season 1) steps up as the Earl of Surrey and gives a menacing, charismatic performance but doesn't actually do very much. Henry Cavill rounds off his appearance on the show with a surprisingly effective melancholic performance as Charles Brandon also approaches the end of his life, enlivened only by a new romance. Sarah Bolger (finally promoted to the title sequence cast) is also excellent as Mary Tudor, walking a fine line between being sympathetic but also driven by her religion. For the wives, Tamzin Merchant is effectively flighty and irritating as Catherine Howard should be, but rounds off being a little bit too irritating. Also, the writers ill-advisedly keep the Howard/Culpeper affair storyline going for at least a full episode longer than is really necessary.Once that's out the way, Joley Richardson gives a much more decent performance as Catherine Parr, Henry's final wife, and portrays Parr as a woman of much greater maturity and intelligence than her predecessor. There's some minor scheming as the reformers in the court find themselves wondering if Parr is religiously acceptable, but that peters out as Henry becomes focused on war instead. The battle scenes are surprisingly good, with the Siege of Boulogne emerging as the stand-out setpiece of the entire series. Afterwards, we're plunged back into minor court politics before the show finally ends.As with previous seasons, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is really not a great Henry VIII. He nails the king's intelligence but not his charisma, but with the addition of make-up to chronicle Henry's passing years he does seem to improve a little in this final season. At least up until the last two episodes, when he decides to adopt a bizarre and distracting deep voice (presumably under the mistaken impression it helps him sound older) which does not work at all.That said, the fourth season of The Tudors (***) does adopt a melancholic and reflect tone in the last few episodes as the king's life draws to a close which ends the series on a surprisingly sombre tone. Whilst The Tudors will never rank among the great historical dramas, it does do enough reasonably well to make it an effective (if far from perfect), basic account of the life of Henry VIII.",3,A watchable conclusion,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,3999,"['England', '1540', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'married', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'have', 'finally', 'achieved', 'level', 'happiness', 'execution', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'left', 'government', 'firmly', 'cowed', 'Henry', 'religious', 'Reformation', 'country', 'hands', 'However', 'Catherine', 'past', 'colourful', 'soon', 'old', ""'friends"", 'creeping', 'woodwork', 'determined', 'use', 'own', 'advancement', 'When', 'Catherine', 'flighty', 'irresponsible', 'behaviour', 'irritates', 'distances', 'Henry', 'also', 'drawn', 'dangerous', 'affair.The', 'fourth', 'final', 'season', 'Tudors', 'up', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'fifth', 'penultimate', 'wife', 'last', 'seven', 'years', 'life', 'Aside', 'controversial', 'life', 'death', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'period', 'most', 'notable', 'Henry', 'decision', 'invade', 'France', 'besiege', 'Boulogne', 'elements', 'are', 'characterised', 'TV', 'series', 'form', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'lacking', 'decision', 'buy', 'Harley', 'impractical', 'overpriced', 'open-topped', 'convertible', 'amusing', 'idea', 'also', 'one', 'air', 'melancholy', 'Henry', 'old', 'leg', 'wound', 'death', 'coming', 'preparing', 'old', 'friends', 'allies', 'also', 'start', 'passing', 'Henry', 'forced', 'consider', 'life', 'accomplishments', 'exemplified', 'final', 'episode', 'when', 'having', 'visions', 'dead', 'wives', 'questions', 'was', 'right', 'divorce', 'execute', 'them.As', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Tudors', 'certain', 'watchability', 'spite', 'numerous', 'problems', 'deviations', 'history', 'However', 'series', 'definitely', 'suffered', 'loss', 'James', 'Frain', 'Cromwell', 'David', ""O'Hara"", 'being', 'only', 'four', 'years', 'younger', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'father', 'Season', '1', 'up', 'Earl', 'Surrey', 'menacing', 'charismatic', 'performance', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'very', 'much', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'appearance', 'show', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'melancholic', 'performance', 'Charles', 'Brandon', 'also', 'end', 'life', 'enlivened', 'only', 'new', 'romance', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'finally', 'promoted', 'title', 'sequence', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'Mary', 'Tudor', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'also', 'driven', 'religion', 'wives', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'effectively', 'flighty', 'irritating', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'should', 'be', 'off', 'being', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'irritating', 'Also', 'writers', 'ill-advisedly', 'keep', 'Howard/Culpeper', 'affair', 'storyline', 'going', 'least', 'full', 'episode', 'longer', 'really', 'necessary.Once', 'out', 'way', 'Joley', 'Richardson', 'much', 'more', 'decent', 'performance', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'Henry', 'final', 'wife', 'Parr', 'woman', 'much', 'greater', 'maturity', 'intelligence', 'predecessor', 'minor', 'scheming', 'reformers', 'court', 'find', 'wondering', 'Parr', 'religiously', 'acceptable', 'out', 'Henry', 'focused', 'war', 'instead', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Siege', 'Boulogne', 'emerging', 'stand-out', 'setpiece', 'entire', 'series', 'Afterwards', ""'re"", 'plunged', 'back', 'minor', 'court', 'politics', 'show', 'finally', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'really', 'not', 'great', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'king', 'intelligence', 'not', 'charisma', 'addition', 'make-up', 'chronicle', 'Henry', 'passing', 'years', 'seem', 'improve', 'little', 'final', 'season', 'least', 'up', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'when', 'adopt', 'bizarre', 'distracting', 'deep', 'voice', 'presumably', 'mistaken', 'impression', 'sound', 'older', 'not', 'work', 'said', 'fourth', 'season', 'Tudors', '***', 'adopt', 'melancholic', 'reflect', 'tone', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'king', 'life', 'close', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'sombre', 'tone', 'Tudors', 'will', 'never', 'rank', 'great', 'historical', 'dramas', 'do', 'enough', 'reasonably', 'well', 'make', 'effective', 'far', 'perfect', 'basic', 'account', 'life', 'Henry', 'VIII']",N/A

1344627,A19XZDFMSCBZ10,B003FSTN7U,G. Prout,"[0, 3]","In the modern US education system, with its ridiculous new emphasis on teaching ""world history"" not much time is spent learning things that actually had an impact on us because ""white history"" is racist so we spend over half of any history class learning about the ancient sumerians or babylonians or china.  There is nothing wrong with learning about China or Babylon or anything, as long as it is relevant.  As England founded what became the United States, they are the largest contributors (besides ourselves) to American history so I naturally lean towards English history but in the schools I went to in California as a kid and teenager I heard the names Henry VIII and Elizabeth I maybe once due to political correctness.  Pretty much all we learned about England was the Magna Carta was signed and then a few hundred years later we rebelled against them lol.Anyways, with that rant over let me say that this show truly opened my eyes to a period in history that is absolutely fascinating.  I have spent a long time since watching this show studying Henry and Elizabeth and the rest of the Tudors (though to a lesser extent) and was amazed by what I read.  I thank this show for making history actually fun.  The costumes and sets were stunning.  The acting was brilliant- I cant even begin to name all the awards I wish the actors on the show had won. The plot... well the plot pretty closely follows history so Ill admit it probably didnt take a genius to write it down, but it took a genius to make it as real and relatable as it was on the show so well done!  I absolutely loved the show.  Season 4 Episode 7 was in my opinion the most glorious thing I had ever seen.  Seeing all the English soldiers going to war and Henrys speech and the cheering... was just truly majestic.I want to also say I loved every one of Henry's queens.

For those of us who enjoy historical drama (whether fictionalized to enhance the drama or not) this view of the beginning of the Tudor reign in England was a satisfying treat - visually and dramatically.  Yes, there were errors of omission and commission and some jumbling of times and incidents, added characters and subtracted or mutated characters, but the spectacle won us over.  Probably some of the finest set dressing and costuming ever assembled for a huge cast kept the eye entertained while the quality of acting included some of the more important actors of the day along with introducing some fresh and exciting faces: Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Henry Cavill, James Frain, Sarah Bolger, Natalie Dormer, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Jeremy Northam, Sam Neill, Hans Matheson, Henry Czerny, Peter O'Toole, Joely Richaradson, Max von Sydow, Joss Stone, Gabrielle Anwar, David O'Hara and on and on.What may have been lacking in verisimilitude was compensated by a richly dramatic portrayal of one of the most fascinating royal families ever.  Michael Hirst wrote all 38 episodes, no minor feat! The cinematography was superb and the running themes by composer Trevor Morris  kept the series connected.

From around the 4th show into the first season I was hooked and have found each season that followed nothing short of riveting.  On every level this show is a work of quality.  Philosophically and historically speaking it leaves so much for one to muse on.  Meyers portrayal of the king was nothing short of magnificent all the way through, and you could near say the same for each and every one of the other stars and supporting actors.  Add to that lush visuals and incredible costuming, an incredible screenplay and cinematography to match, and what you are left with is work of art left to us by none other than Showtime.  Sexy though it may be, it leaves no points of the thinking man's mind to beg.  In terms of scope and grandeur I'd put it on par with HBO's Rome.  ""The Tudors"" is one fascinating piece of work. However...The only reason I give 4 stars for this final season is that the last episode ends on a weakish note - and what a pity, since everything short of the last half hour is so well-done.  The fantastical revisitation of each of the former wives, not to mention Meyers playing an aged king nearly 3 times his own age (in real life) end the series in a somewhat maudlin and mildly absurd manner.  I didn't mind the occasional visitation of ghosts in previous episodes (and thought they were well used in fact!) though in this final episode I feel they would have better served the series by ending it at a higher and more suspenseful point or at least without the use of these fantastical elements which made it suddenly seem like a high school play rather than the high-caliber production of everything that had just gone before.  Oh well.  Still these are small quibbles in what was in all other respects a powerful, unique, and utterly engaging series.  I was grateful for the footnotes at the end which give a brief history of who among his children sat on the throne following the death of Henry VIII, and for how long.

Here, in the series' final season, we have the best indirect explanation why, since without Rhys Meyers's shirtless body on display, and his beautiful face covered by bad aging makeup, he has only his inadequate acting upon which to fall back. Trying to evoke the Tudor lion in his winter, Rhys Meyers evokes a harsher and harsher rattle to his voice that sounds like a bad imitation of the elderly Richard Harris. Rhys Meyers is, at least, rarely boring, which is always one of the best things about the series itself: even if its subsidiary actors have not been up to the level set by Maria Doyle Kennedy, Jeremy Northam and Henry Czerny the first two seasons, at least the thing moves along at quite a clip (and the costumes are even more spectacular than ever). The best performances in this fourth season are from Joss White as Henry's intensely likeable fourth wife Anne of Cleves (still around after her annulment and treated largely as a beloved family figure to the King), and Joely Richardson, well cast for once in her life, as the intelligent sixth wife Katharine Parr who tries to push the king's Protestant leanings too far. Tamzin Merchant features in the first several episodes as the unlucky Catherine Howard, whom she plays as a simpering dingaling; Henry Cavill sticks around with little interesting to do as the Duke of Suffolk; David O'Hara plays Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, like a stevedore who has mistakenly wandered onto the sets.

Although the adult-themed scenes were unnecessary and detracted, the rest of what was accomplished here makes this series well worth watching.  The DP/dir of photography, writing, acting, costuming and timing/pace were on the money and this is a series I thoroughly enjoyed.The last two episodes felt a bit rushed in trying to compress many years etc of deteriorating health into a rapid close, but having his former wives' ghosts appear was a great touch, and well handled.  Like ""mad men"", this is a high quality series well worth seeing over and over again. The battle scene episodes (and the final ep w/henry's wives) were highlights of this season.  The actor who played Howard, Earl of Surrey did a super job, totally believable in his role, and garnered sympathy at his trial.  The aging folks close to henry not so much, and the bishop was an unlikable character.  His last wife was well-played though. Mixed bag of supporting characters, some were solid as noted.Having enjoyed the entire series, reflecting back on it, Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn was the best character portrayal (Jonathan does a superb job as Henry as well); the season two with her in it was the best of the four seasons.

No one really knows what these people were like in their day to day lives, so they may well have been sitting around, working out and waiting for the invention of rock videos and glossy magazines, but you kind of doubt it. This does succeed in making history alive to the present though. Far more so than the dry-as-a-Tudor-biscuit, '6 Wives of Henry VIII'. The idea is clearly to hang modern sensibilities around the facts of history, so why the pointless diversions from some of the minor details of the history? Henry had two sisters, Margaret and Mary (after whom his daughter by Catherine of Aragon was named), Henry Fitzroy lived to 17, not 6, Margaret married James IV of Scotland and Mary (Henry's sister) married Louis XII of France (and then Charles Brandon, on Louis' death). Neither married a decomposing King of Portugal. This does seem odd given that much of the dialogue is lifted straight from history 9at least as quoted by contemporary sources). The Earl of Suffolk did actually say to one of his interlocutors at his trial:'Hold your tongue you catchpole! This Kingdom has never been well since the King put mean creatures like you into his government!'He must have been a magnificent guy, and he is portrayed magnificently by David O'Hara, albeit in the style of a Glasgow gang boss. Sir Thomas Moore is shown, warts and all, and deservedly more dispassionately than his saintly portrayal in 'A Man For All Seasons'. He wasnt prepared to 'say none harm and think none harm'. Like many today he was prepared to kill, as well as die, for his religious beliefs.

1344664,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B003FSTN7U,Melissa Niksic,"[57, 63]","My biggest complaint about ""The Tudors"" is that it ended after only four seasons. The Tudor dynasty didn't end with Henry VIII. Showtime had an amazing opportunity to continue this show with the short-lived reigns of Edward and Mary, followed by the lengthy Golden Age commandeered by Queen Elizabeth I. The network chose not to go that route, which is a major bummer.As for the fourth and final season of ""The Tudors,"" it definitely had its moments. I've been a fan of the show since Season 1, realizing that the series is completely historically inaccurate and a blatant depiction of nothing but sex, violence, and more sex...however, I love it for what it is! By far the best parts of this season were the appearances of Henry's final wives, the flighty Catherine Howard (perfectly portrayed by Tamzin Merchant) and the strong-willed Catherine Parr (Joley Richardson). I won't go into the plot details because I'm assuming that anyone who ever took a history class knows how Henry's story ends. I will say that I think the show took a downward spiral during the final two episodes. Jonathan Rhys Meyers began speaking in a ""sickly old Henry"" voice that sounded identical to Dick Van Dyke's portrayal of the old banker, Mr Dawes Sr., in ""Mary Poppins."" Obviously, instead of coming across as ominous and grave, that awful voice was severely comical to me, which kind of took away from the serious events leading up to Henry's demise.Also, the season finale itself was a huge disappointment. I was thrilled that the show brought back three of Henry's former wives, who I assumed were going to haunt him, but their appearances were both short and uneventful. Had I the opportunity to write the final episode of this show, I think I could have done a heck of a better job. It was a real shame to watch what used to be such a powerful show go out with a whimper instead of a roar.Still, the majority of Season 4 is filled with more good scenes than bad. I am sad the series is over and look forward to re-watching it on DVD (especially the Anne Boleyn episodes, which were by far the best).",4,"Oh, Henry...",1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,2088,"['biggest', 'complaint', 'Tudors', 'ended', 'only', 'four', 'seasons', 'Tudor', 'dynasty', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Showtime', 'had', 'amazing', 'opportunity', 'continue', 'show', 'short-lived', 'reigns', 'Edward', 'Mary', 'followed', 'lengthy', 'Golden', 'Age', 'commandeered', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'network', 'chose', 'not', 'go', 'route', 'major', 'bummer.As', 'fourth', 'final', 'season', 'Tudors', 'definitely', 'had', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'Season', '1', 'realizing', 'series', 'completely', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'blatant', 'depiction', 'nothing', 'sex', 'violence', 'more', 'sex', 'however', 'love', 'what', 'far', 'best', 'parts', 'season', 'were', 'appearances', 'Henry', 'final', 'wives', 'flighty', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'strong-willed', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'Joley', 'Richardson', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'details', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'took', 'history', 'class', 'how', 'Henry', 'story', 'will', 'say', 'think', 'show', 'took', 'downward', 'spiral', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'began', 'speaking', 'sickly', 'old', 'Henry', 'voice', 'sounded', 'identical', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'portrayal', 'old', 'banker', 'Mr', 'Dawes', 'Sr.', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Obviously', 'instead', 'coming', 'ominous', 'grave', 'awful', 'voice', 'was', 'severely', 'comical', 'kind', 'took', 'away', 'serious', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'Henry', 'demise.Also', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'was', 'thrilled', 'show', 'brought', 'back', 'three', 'Henry', 'former', 'wives', 'who', 'assumed', 'were', 'going', 'haunt', 'appearances', 'were', 'short', 'uneventful', 'Had', 'opportunity', 'write', 'final', 'episode', 'show', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'heck', 'better', 'job', 'was', 'real', 'shame', 'watch', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'such', 'powerful', 'show', 'go', 'out', 'whimper', 'instead', 'roar.Still', 'majority', 'Season', '4', 'filled', 'more', 'good', 'scenes', 'bad', 'am', 'sad', 'series', 'look', 'forward', 're-watching', 'DVD', 'especially', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'episodes', 'were', 'far', 'best']",N/A

1344689,A1O8GCHZD1WX7F,B003FSTN7U,Robert Hardaway,"[105, 115]","I agree with the reviewer who noted the historical innacuracies in the Tudors series. While some of these innacuracies can be condoned on grounds of poetic license, some appear to be egregiously gratuitous (i.e., having Henry's sister Margaret not only marry the King of Protugal--which never happned--but then have her murder him!) There appears to be no dramatic reason for that kind of historical innacuracy which is truly unforgiveable. On the other hand, I am more forgiving of the Series having Wolsey committ suicide rather than dying of natural causes inasmuch as there was some speculation at the time of his death that he did indeed commit suicide given that he was facing the curel justice of a vengeful Henry.(And certainly if Wolsey did committ suicide, Henry would have every reason to cover it up in a way that the historians could not access). A more serious criticism is that the Series apparently made no effort whatssoever to represent Henry even close to how the paintings of the day depicted him. Arguably the ""young"" Henry--depictions of which are quite rare--could have looked something like the actor in the Series, though the dark slicked back hair of the actor is hard to reconcile with the descriptions of Henry as more blond and stocky. And certainly the marine crewcut styles are even more difficult to reconcile with the images available. But perhaps the worst failure is to not have Henry age at all over his entire reign, especially given the numerous historical sources which all agree on his ballooning obesity and deterioration in his health. This failure is all the more stark given the near perfect depictions of Ann Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon by the actresses.(Especially the depictions of Anne Boleyn which is so nearly on the money that it's almost scary). So why, given these obvious deficiencies do I give this Series four stars? Because I applaud every attempt by the dramatic arts to make history interesting enough to inspire an interest in history. Many of those who watch this series will go to the history books and read the real stuff (and hopefully discover that Margaret never married the Kind of Portugal, and never in fact murdered him). Indeed, had the Series at least made a half-hearted attempt to depict Henry according to the sources available, and not engaged in the most egregious of it's historical innacuracies (the marriage of Margaret to the Kind of Portugal), I would have given this polished, entertaining, and addicitive production a full five stars.

Guess I've been reading too much about his life and am too much of a purist. Also some historical facts have been twisted. But that was bad enough. But how many viewers could accept this series as anything but bogus. The dialogue was inane and vulgar.  Jonathan Rhys-Williams, who should have played a page or a yong lover of Katherine Howard, certainly not Great Harry himself, was distracting. He was even worse a Henry VIII than Eric Bana (Troy's dark, swarthy Hector!) in ""The Other Boleyn Girl.""I realize actors do play historical characters who do not always resemble the parts they play(e.g., Colin Farrell's 5'10"" to Alexander's 5'6"" or 5'7"")and Mel Gibson (about 5'11"" while William Wallace was at least 6'5"") but both had substance and even Mel was powerful (Perhaps Wallace himself had been mythologized as a giant so in Braveheart they solved it by having someone in the ranks saying, ""We thought you were at least 7 feet tall!"" and Mel replying, ""But I am William Wallace,"" and you believed him because he exuded the power. But in The Tudors, they cast this little dude, Jonathan Rhys-Williams, dark, wiry, and everyone towered over him. All of the ladies were almost his height. He lacked power, majesty, and substance, and he was given bad script  to make him sound even less kingly than he looked.Because if nothing else, at all phases of his life, Henry VIII was every inch a king. In his adult youth and up to when he MET Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII was a magnificent monarch iin the prime of his vigour at 6'3"" (an unusual height for any man back in the 1500s) with a magnificent physique, lithe and powerful. Everyone looked up to--and up at--him. He was intimidating, while Rhys-Williams was a pipsqueak, and a vulgar little bully whom everyone looked down at while he was screaming back up at them more, acting like a spoiled child than a king.  He was so bogus that no one could have taken Henry VIII seriously had HE really come across like that. The real Henry VIII was very fair and ruddy, had red-gold hair and beard in his youth and lost most of his hair (and had gained a lot of weight) years later by the time he MARRIED Anne Boleyn.TV's Anne Boleyn was pretty but had pale fish eyes. The real Anne had black eyes and was very thin and dark and very charismatic. TV's Anne B. was by turns listless and demanding, no middle ground. Katherine of Aragon was also woefully miscast. The real Katherine was very short, had aged prematurely, and had got rather chunky in about 10 years. In fact, they were all too ""The Real Doomed Wives of London"" to me. These TV wives are all too gorgeous, even Anne of Cleves, who was actually reportedly so unappealing that the still-virile Henry wouldn't consummate his marriage with her. And even Wolsey (Sam Neill!?) was too good looking to be Wolsey, Jeez! What were they thinking? All were miscast. Sam Neill acted a good Wolsey (another reason I gave it one star), if you closed your eyes and pictured him as fat as a pig by the time he was kicked out of office.Also too many obscenity-bombs were thrown about. Why do people have to be so vulgar? We hear enough of it in real life, and now it is de rigueur to lace every conversation in films with dirt and smut. It is distracting to a viewer when that is done too much, and it is why I can't bear to watch too many movies nowadays. Honesly, I am not being a prude. I can appreciate obscenities--when they are reserved for very special occasions. Once obscenties and perversities are permitted, they abused to distraction.Finally, Henry VIII, by the time he divorced Katherine Howard, weighed 28 stone and his leg was ulcerated and smelly. A stone equals 14 pounds, which totaled a whopping 392 pounds at the time of his death. He was a glutton and nearly an invalid due to his leg pain.Rhys-Williams is a good actor but unsuitably and woefully miscast as Henry VIII.

Other times it takes such flights of fancy my jaw dropped.Five hundred years later, why does the Tudor period still interest us? Because it was full of larger-than-life characters and intense drama. The real story of Henry VIII is compelling - why do we need to change it to suit modern audiences? The changes aren't any more dramatic than the real story - so why?!?!?!Whoever directed Gabrielle Anwar in the segment where she marries the King of Portugal should never get another directing job EVER. A real English princess of this time frame would NEVER have betrayed her real feelings the way Anwar did - and she most certainly did not kill this first husband (the decrepit king of France, not Portugal). In addition, what's with this character's whole story arch? On the whole, this is Princess MARY's story (not Princess Margaret - she married the King of Scotland and became the mother of Mary Queen of Scots). What a jumbled mess!I LOVED Maria Doyle Kennedy, Natalie Dormer, and Joely Richardson as Katherine of Aragon, Ann Boleyn, and Katherine Parr respectively. The actresses that played Jane Seymour and Anne of Cleves were fine too - but both were much too pretty. Tamzin Merchant was TERRIBLE as Katherine Howard. I laughed out loud at the scene where she acts like a modern 13-year-old when she confronts Lady Mary about not respecting her. (hand on hip, I was ready to hear her say ""you know, like, I really think, like, you should respect me."") No doubt Howard was a flighty, bubble headed child - but even they didn't act in the 16th century like they do now. She was so immature and self-absorbed I could not for the life of me figure out how Henry - never mind Culpepper - was attracted to her.Finally, what was up with not having Henry get fat and infirm? History tells us he was between 300 and 400 pounds when he died, and that leg injury was a smelly mess (driving his servants who had to clean it up away, gasping for fresh air) for much of his old age. JRM just didn't feel like playing fat - and they let him get away with it?On one of the 'making of' interviews at the end of the series, the writer said he considered killing Henry at the end. WHAT?!?! I know having him die a natural death is really boring, TV wise, but it does happen to be the truth.On the whole, for me at least, the light went out of the series after Ann Boleyn's death.",3,Wow - confusing presentation of fact and fantasy,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,2474,"['series', 'interesting', 'least', 'Beautiful', 'costuming', 'scenery', 'Sometimes', 'spot', 'factual', 'Other', 'times', 'such', 'flights', 'fancy', 'jaw', 'dropped.Five', 'hundred', 'years', 'later', 'why', 'Tudor', 'period', 'still', 'interest', 'was', 'full', 'larger-than-life', 'characters', 'intense', 'drama', 'real', 'story', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'compelling', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'change', 'suit', 'modern', 'audiences', 'changes', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'dramatic', 'real', 'story', 'so', 'why', 'Whoever', 'directed', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'segment', 'where', 'King', 'Portugal', 'should', 'never', 'get', 'directing', 'job', 'EVER', 'A', 'real', 'English', 'princess', 'time', 'frame', 'would', 'NEVER', 'have', 'betrayed', 'real', 'feelings', 'way', 'Anwar', 'did', 'most', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'first', 'husband', 'decrepit', 'king', 'France', 'not', 'Portugal', 'addition', 'what', 'character', 'whole', 'story', 'arch', 'whole', 'Princess', 'MARY', 'story', 'not', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'married', 'King', 'Scotland', 'became', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'What', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'LOVED', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'Ann', 'Boleyn', 'Katherine', 'Parr', 'respectively', 'actresses', 'played', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'were', 'fine', 'too', 'were', 'much', 'too', 'pretty', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'was', 'TERRIBLE', 'Katherine', 'Howard', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'scene', 'where', 'modern', '13-year-old', 'when', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'not', 'respecting', 'hand', 'hip', 'was', 'ready', 'hear', 'say', 'know', 'really', 'think', 'should', 'respect', 'doubt', 'Howard', 'was', 'flighty', 'bubble', 'headed', 'child', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', '16th', 'century', 'do', 'now', 'was', 'so', 'immature', 'self-absorbed', 'could', 'not', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'Henry', 'never', 'mind', 'Culpepper', 'was', 'attracted', 'her.Finally', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'not', 'having', 'Henry', 'get', 'fat', 'infirm', 'History', 'was', '300', '400', 'pounds', 'when', 'died', 'leg', 'injury', 'was', 'smelly', 'mess', 'driving', 'servants', 'who', 'had', 'clean', 'up', 'away', 'gasping', 'fresh', 'air', 'much', 'old', 'age', 'JRM', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'playing', 'fat', 'let', 'get', 'away', 'one', ""'making"", 'interviews', 'end', 'series', 'writer', 'said', 'considered', 'killing', 'Henry', 'end', 'WHAT', 'know', 'having', 'die', 'natural', 'death', 'really', 'boring', 'TV', 'wise', 'happen', 'be', 'truth.On', 'whole', 'least', 'light', 'went', 'series', 'Ann', 'Boleyn', 'death']",N/A

Despite what many naysayers have said about this series, ""The Tudors"" was a well-acted and extremely well-written account of one of the most controversial Royal subjects in European times. The show was never accurate in its account of the life of King Henry VIII, but it does give the viewer a good overview as to what kind of King he was and what England was like under his regime.Another reason I loved ""The Tudors"" is because of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. His portrayal was sexy, intelligent, heart-breaking at times, and hair-raising as he really was able to get to the debths of the character he was portraying. At times you could love King Henry or despise him because of some of the actions he performed. If anything Henry loved his country, but at the same time he loved his women, a combination that often met with distrastrous results. The amount of wives and female lovers he accumulated led one to believe he had a sexual addiction that he couldn't control, something in which the audience knew and felt a kind of sadness for.""The Tudors"" was also beautifully produced with exquisite sets, costumes, and on-location shoots that many movie producers would envy. For a televison series ""The Tudors"" was first-rate in that department.The final season, which like others, include ten episodes, and the story mainly deals with King Henry VIII's marriage to Katherine Howard, who was every bit as promiscuous as the King. This year also deals with the final months of the King's life as he battled major health problems with his weight balooning to extreme levels.""The Tudors"" was an original and I will miss it.

1344711,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B003FSTN7U,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[5, 6]","I don't think I fully appreciated this show, or it's leading actor, as much the first two years it was on. I watched it from the beginning. I didn't expect to care for it, but it was compelling just enough to keep me going. As the show went on, Jonathan Rhys Meyers became more & more intense, focused & intriguing, until finally by this season I had to hail him as one of the finest in the lineup of thirty-something actors out there. My mother, twenty-five years older than I, felt equally mesmerized by this extraordinary young man's ability to portray Henry VIII so brilliantly at any age, from his early twenties through early fifties, the time close to the famous monarch's actual death. Even his voice ""aged"" so naturally, it left me spellbound by this actor's ability to utterly become one with his role. Now, I have to say that he is right up there with Michael C. Hall as one of my favorite actors of this age group, one of the greatest to come along since Olivier. A grandiose statement, but as anyone who watches this show almost certainly must conclude by now, his is THE definitive modern Henry VIII portrayal, physical likeness to the actual king being completely unimportant to me now.A fine supporting cast rounds out this majestic season. The dashing & blindingly handsome Henry Cavill, who blossomed beautifully into his role as Henry's rather quiet right-hand man, becoming arguably the most sympathetic character of the entire series. The young but fantastic Sarah Bolger is a marvel. How a young woman still in her teens can effortlessly portray Henry's daughter Mary with nerves of steel & yet such delicate grace is unbelievable. Her ability to convince the viewer of the aging of the Princess (and all of the fears that accompanied being an unmarried royal so long in such a time), without wearing a speck more makeup or doing anything different physically is impressive, to say the least. She can make herself appear seventeen years old one episode, then with nary a change in dress, appear to be in her early thirties only a couple of shows later. Joely Richardson was simply superb as Henry's sixth & final wife. Her chemistry with Rhys Meyers was perhaps the most loving of all, though far more subtle than his previous ""conquests"". Their rather gentle, yet still occasionally heart-stopping marriage left me breathless. I believe Ms. Richardson is the best of all the actresses, all of whom were good, who played his marital partners. I enjoyed this season best of all, and a great part of that is due to her.Many scenes only viewed once still stay with me til this day, and not just from the finale. There was less sex portrayed in this season, but what was done seemed not to be for shock value, but to actually enhance the story. This was a departure, in my opinion, from the first & second seasons, which was almost ridiculously sex-ridden for such a show. But be prepared, it was one of the most heart-wrenching of the entire series, with one episode so graphic in it's portrayal of torture used during those times that I literally had to take my eyes off the screen for a couple of minutes. The special-effects department & actors involved, while they must be a fine set of geniuses, made everything look so real it seemed there were no special effects involved at all. Truly horrifying in parts, I found myself literally starting to hate the Tower of London and all it represents in my real life. If that isn't a symbol of the power of a television program, I don't know what is.While not always historically accurate, enough truth remains that the repression, intrigue and feelings of those long-dead comes to life again here. I would watch this & could literally feel the tremor coming forth from all who tiptoed around the king, which was anyone & everyone. This show made me grateful that I didn't live in that era, a feeling my mother & others who viewed this echoed, as well.

For the interest this show sparked in the mainstream population of one of the most scintillating periods in England's long history I can forgive a few inaccuracies and transgressions.The last season was sad because you obviously knew Henry would die at the last episode. How dreadful! I almost could not finish the series. Despite what an unforgivable monster he was, killing wives, bastardizing his own children and tormenting prisioners - I felt for him. Meyers just played an amazing Henry, depicting his youth, swagger and fearlessness without fail while also genuinely showing his uncertanties and fears regarding his succession. You had to feel awe for him, even some compassion and intrigue. I don't get very emotional during movies, but during the last episode when they showed the opening scene with the riderless horse charging down the lane I teared right up.I felt that Sarah Bolger played an amazing Princess Mary and who could ever question what a powerful role Cavill played through the duration as Henry's most trusted friend and advisor, Charles Brandon?
