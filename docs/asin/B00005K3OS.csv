I was right... but the movie did turn out to be pretty good. Trust me, it could have been a heck of a lot worse. Kirsten Dunst gives off great screen presence and Martin Short steals the show as an overly dramatic Theatre teacher. Kirsten was simply beautiful and she had me swooning when she was singing for the school play. (Not to mention the great scene of her in a bikini at the pool. Ouch).

It was very unique, being as they intertwined the story of &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; into the story.  Martin Short was hilarious in it.  Really good actors in the movie overall.

I would say most people can relate to the &quot;breaking up with your first love&quot; scenario ... and how you live and learn and life goes on and usually, things work out for the best in the end.

I don't recall ever even seeing a comercial for this film while it was in the theaters. I immediately went to CDNow.com to find out the title!  Once I found it here and for sale I immediately bought it (this after having seen it once and only about 2/3's of it). Kirsten Dunst (Crazy Beautiful) once again turns in a great performance, but I hope she doesn't limit her movies to ""teen movies"" which seems to be her trend at the moment. She truly is a talented actress in-the-making as Interview With The Vampire and Drop Dead Gorgeous demonstrate. This is not a film of the ""Vampire"" callibar, but is just plain fun and silly-funny. The supporting cast is also excellant... all of which are ""up-and-comers"" (Among others: Sisco, Carmen Electra and Colin Hanks all in hilarious off-beat roles). I especially liked the parrallel to Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.This is one of the view roles for Martin Short(as a loser high school drama teacher) that I found tolerable and actually VERY funny and effective. There is some very quirly humor here... like the boy band send up and the openning credits scene using the Captain and Tenille song- that always makes me giggle! One of the best parts of the movie is actually the ""music video"" closing credits bit where Sisco and Vitamin C re-do an Earth Wind & Fire song. I was hoping the DVD would have this as a separate extra, but alas, no.Overall this is merely a fun, funny send up of much of the current ""teen scene"" that can have even oldies like me giggling the whole way through.

Burke, who is played by Ben Foster, breaks up with his long time girlfriend Alison and he goes at great lengths to get her back. He joins the drama club to audition for the play that Alison is in with her new boyfriend, Striker, who is hilariously played by Shane West. Ironically, the star of the play gets badly injured and Striker nominates Burke for the lead role. Its at that point where Burke practices his lines with Kelly, the younger sister of his best friend Ned, who is played by Kirsten Dunst and falls in love with her. But Burke is pondering if it's right to date his best friend's sister or not. This movie is entertaining despite some of the corny jokes. The funniest lines belong to Ed Begley Jr. and Swoosie Kurtz as Burke's parents and Martin Short is very funny as the preening Drama Club teacher.

Kirsten Dunst is at her best since Interview with the Vampire, and that song she sings towards the end made me fall in love with her presence. I thought the main guy (sorry no name) was great as well. From the commentary, the filmmakers state that the main actor normally hates these types of movies, but that led him to act real in this teeny bopper world. I could not agree more. Martin Short was very funny as well, but I think the true appeal with this film is depite a few teeny bopper jokes that could easily have been supplemented into a dozen films of this nature--its heart and emotion rings true and this is why I feel years from now, people will be citing this as one of the great films that went away too quickly.

To complicate matters even further, Allison falls for a popular boy band singer (think NSYNC), who just happens to go to their high school.

Get Over It is not going to stretch the grey matter too far at all, and is essentially a rework of a story that you would have seen many, many times before.Having said that, I still enjoy watching them, so keep making them I say!When Berke Landers (Ben Foster) is dumped by his longtime girlfriend Allison (Melissa Sagemiller) in the opening scenes, he decides to stop at nothing to try and win her back. It seems his ex-love has decided that ex-Swingtown Lads singer, Stryker (Shane West), is far more interesting, charming, and sophisticated (what with his faux English accent and debonair manner). Berke's efforts to win back his one-true-love leads to some funny moments, such as a very off-key rendition of him serenading his love with the song Alison by Elvis Costello from her rooftop. Now Stryker of course turns out to be a complete jerk, but it looks too late to let Allison know this and all appears lost.In a last ditch attempt to win back her affections, Berke decides to audition for the up-coming school play ""A Midsummer Night's Rockin Eve"", even though his thespian talents leave much to be desired (especially his singing). He manages to enlist the help of his friend's younger sister Kelly (Kirsten Dunst) to help him learn his part and provide some tutoring on the finer points of acting. Now Kelly just happens to be a decent actor, singer, and songwriter, and is beautiful to boot. Okay, I hear you all saying, we can see where this is going. Well you're right, so I won't give away any more. Suffice to say that there are some funny moments, the usual toilet humour, and the best line of the film delivered by Berke to his never angry parents when a party at their house is sprung, ""You're my parents...stop trusting me so much"". The actual performance of the play is particularly amusing with catchy songs and a real sense of fun pervading the whole production.One of the better characters is the archetypal fanatical drama teacher played by Martin Short. In a true-to-type role he embodies Dr. Desmond Forrest Oates with the right amount of lunacy and stupidity to keep everyone guessing just what planet he is from.",4,Funny and entertaining,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,2365,"['must', 'only', 'be', 'handful', 'teen-film', 'ideas', 'doing', 'rounds', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'variations', 'other', ""'re"", 'good', 'thing', 'well', 'make', 'half-a-dozen', 'could', 'be', 'new', 'adage', 'Get', 'not', 'going', 'stretch', 'grey', 'matter', 'too', 'far', 'essentially', 'rework', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'before.Having', 'said', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'so', 'keep', 'making', 'say', 'When', 'Berke', 'Landers', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'dumped', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Allison', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'opening', 'scenes', 'stop', 'nothing', 'try', 'win', 'back', 'ex-love', 'decided', 'ex-Swingtown', 'Lads', 'singer', 'Stryker', 'Shane', 'West', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'charming', 'sophisticated', 'what', 'faux', 'English', 'accent', 'debonair', 'manner', 'Berke', 'efforts', 'win', 'back', 'one-true-love', 'leads', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'very', 'off-key', 'rendition', 'serenading', 'love', 'song', 'Alison', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'rooftop', 'Now', 'Stryker', 'course', 'out', 'be', 'complete', 'jerk', 'too', 'late', 'let', 'Allison', 'know', 'last', 'ditch', 'attempt', 'win', 'back', 'affections', 'Berke', 'audition', 'up-coming', 'school', 'play', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Rockin', 'Eve', 'even', 'thespian', 'talents', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'especially', 'singing', 'enlist', 'help', 'friend', 'younger', 'sister', 'Kelly', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'help', 'learn', 'part', 'provide', 'tutoring', 'finer', 'points', 'acting', 'Now', 'Kelly', 'just', 'be', 'decent', 'actor', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'beautiful', 'boot', 'Okay', 'hear', 'saying', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'Well', ""'re"", 'right', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'usual', 'toilet', 'humour', 'best', 'line', 'film', 'delivered', 'Berke', 'never', 'angry', 'parents', 'when', 'party', 'house', 'sprung', ""'re"", 'parents', 'stop', 'trusting', 'so', 'much', 'actual', 'performance', 'play', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'catchy', 'songs', 'real', 'sense', 'fun', 'pervading', 'whole', 'production.One', 'better', 'characters', 'archetypal', 'fanatical', 'drama', 'teacher', 'played', 'Martin', 'Short', 'true-to-type', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Desmond', 'Forrest', 'right', 'amount', 'lunacy', 'stupidity', 'keep', 'everyone', 'guessing', 'just', 'what', 'planet']",N/A

But I started watching it and it was kinda weird when Berke(Ben Forster)was walking down the street after being dumped by Allison. Why? Because Vitamin C is behind him singing and then a WHOLE parade starts!!! Its pretty funny... Anyways its not like most teeny bopper movies allthough I certainly could have down without those two topless scnes, but ah well... Its a very cute and halarious movie. Berke get's dumped by his girlfriend of 1 and 1/2 years she said that &quot;The feeling was gone.&quot; ahaha... Anyways he's crushed and he can't get over her(WELL DUH),and so when he spots her at a club with another guy from a boyband dancing and making out he get's mad with jealousy and when he finds out they are both trying out for their schools production of &quot;A Midnight Summer's Dream&quot; and so Berke decides to tryout. And so the story only goes UP^ from their. It get's quite harlarious and is worth repeated watchings,IF you like teeny bopper movies, but even if you don't you still might like this one!!! Kirsten DUnst is charming as Kelly and I really though that Shane West was playing a gay guy posing as a straight guy!!! The ONLY thing I didn't like about this movie was the sappiness, the thing that made &quot;Pretty in pink&quot; such a GOOD Teeny Bopper movie is that it didn't really have any sappy scenes in it!!!

But it's been done before, with 10 Things I Hate About You, and that had a cute leading guy (Heath Ledger). Who did we have in this? Some guy who I can't remember, Colin Hanks and Sisquo. Please.Kirsten gets her first credited singing role in this, and she's actually reasonably good. I can't imagine what Simon Cowell would say to her, but that's one of the highlights of the movie.I did however, love most of the singing and dancing, especially over the end credits, where all the cast dance along with Sisquo. We had Usher in She's All That, what made Sisquo think he could act? What made him think he could even sing?!Martin Short is terrific as Dr. Desmond Forrest Oates. Think of the wedding planner from Father Of The Bride, except this guy is less high pitched, just as funny, and even more camp if that's at all possible.This is a sweet rom-com, for anyone who's been dumped.

I have no idea. But I'm really glad that I did, and I fell in love with the movie after watching it for the first time.GET OVER IT! is a great mix of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and a fun story about a group of friends (much like ""10 Things I Hate About You""). Berke's girlfriend Allison just broke up with him, and he's determined to get her back, especially when she starts dating the new guy in school. Berke thinks that he'll win her over if he decides to be in the school musical, A Midsummer's Rockin' Eve. Of course, the movie also has parties, gross-out jokes, practically naked women, and lots of sex talk, but somehow, it ends up being hysterical.Highlights of GET OVER IT! are definately the opening credits, with Vitamin C ""performing"" the song 'Love Will Keep Us Together;' Martin Short, who is absolutely hysterical as Dr. Desmond Forrest Oates, the drama teacher; the Martin Short outtakes, which show how he improvised almost all of his lines; and the music videos/musical performances. Highly recommended to fans of ""10 Things I Hate About You"" or ""American Pie.""Overall grade - A-",5,A hilarious teen comedy,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,1247,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'teen', 'comedies', 'usually', 'tend', 'be', 'same', 'what', 'made', 'buy', 'GET', 'IT', 'even', 'seeing', 'have', 'idea', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'did', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'watching', 'first', 'time.GET', 'IT', 'great', 'mix', 'Shakespeare', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'fun', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'much', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Berke', 'girlfriend', 'Allison', 'just', 'broke', 'up', 'determined', 'get', 'back', 'especially', 'when', 'dating', 'new', 'guy', 'school', 'Berke', ""'ll"", 'win', 'be', 'school', 'musical', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Rockin', 'Eve', 'course', 'movie', 'also', 'parties', 'gross-out', 'jokes', 'practically', 'naked', 'women', 'lots', 'sex', 'talk', 'somehow', 'up', 'being', 'hysterical.Highlights', 'GET', 'IT', 'are', 'definately', 'opening', 'credits', 'Vitamin', 'C', 'performing', 'song', 'Will', 'Keep', 'Us', 'Together', 'Martin', 'Short', 'who', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'Dr.', 'Desmond', 'Forrest', 'Oates', 'drama', 'teacher', 'Martin', 'Short', 'outtakes', 'show', 'how', 'improvised', 'almost', 'lines', 'music', 'videos/musical', 'performances', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'American', 'Pie', 'Overall', 'grade', 'A-']",N/A

Kirsten Dunst is amazing and I have loved all of her performances that I have seen thus far. Every film she has been involved with is intelligent and stretches the boundaries that it is classified in.Get Over It is no exception. This film is very funny and well written with great editing. The cast surprised me. Ben Foster plays the center of the movie as a man in love with a woman who has lost her spark in the relationship they share. He sets out to win her back and that is the set-up for this movie. With great co-stars like Kirsten Dunst and Martin Short, with Sisqo playing a fairly believeable role that does not distract from the rest of the film as I had initially thought he might, Get Over It is a fun, makes-you-smile kind of film.On the DVD are many Martin Short Outtakes that are hilarious as well as Deleted scenes with alternate dialogue and original content that had to be toned down to allow for a lower rating. Like the party scene where the parents show up and say &quot;We could have arranged for a DeeJay...&quot; and the original cut of that was &quot;We could have pitched in for another KEG!&quot;I was very surprised with this movie and the parallels drawn between it and Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (a play performed in the movie) is well done and interesting. Yes, the plot is simple. No, it is not original and we have seen it all before, but not with the dedication of the actors and the quality of the dialogue.If you just need a good laugh and want a fulfilling story, this is the movie for you! I, a man who loves Bruce Willis movies and Clive Barker tales, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Of course, that has a lot to do with my love of Kirsten Dunst as well...",5,A very pleasant surprise!,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,1785,"['Get', 'wonderfully', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'teen', 'movie', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'amazing', 'have', 'loved', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'Every', 'film', 'been', 'involved', 'intelligent', 'boundaries', 'classified', 'in.Get', 'exception', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'well', 'written', 'great', 'editing', 'cast', 'surprised', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'center', 'movie', 'man', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'spark', 'relationship', 'share', 'out', 'win', 'back', 'set-up', 'movie', 'great', 'co-stars', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Sisqo', 'playing', 'fairly', 'believeable', 'role', 'not', 'distract', 'rest', 'film', 'had', 'initially', 'thought', 'might', 'Get', 'fun', 'makes-you-smile', 'kind', 'film.On', 'DVD', 'are', 'many', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Outtakes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'as', 'well', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'dialogue', 'original', 'content', 'had', 'be', 'toned', 'down', 'allow', 'lower', 'rating', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'parents', 'show', 'up', 'say', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'arranged', 'DeeJay', 'quot', 'original', 'cut', 'was', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'pitched', 'KEG', 'quot', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'movie', 'parallels', 'drawn', 'Shakespeare', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'play', 'performed', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'Yes', 'plot', 'simple', 'No', 'not', 'original', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'dedication', 'actors', 'quality', 'dialogue.If', 'just', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'want', 'fulfilling', 'story', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'movies', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'tales', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'course', 'lot', 'do', 'love', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'as', 'well']",N/A
