726200,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00007AJG2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There is something so genuinely sweet about `Claudine', so warm and real that I can't help but truly adore it.  It has its faults (I really hated the campy way it ended) and sometimes its uneven mixture of grit and humor can make it appear like an overlong sitcom episode, but the rich and beautifully sincere performances and the touching screenplay really make this a must-see film.Claudine is a single mother of six who is trying to survive, keeping a house keeping job on the down low so that she won't lose her welfare benefits.  She hasn't been with a man in quite some time, so when Roop, a big hearted garbage man, comes along she is very eager to jump into a relationship; even if her kids resent her for it.  It isn't long though before her children love Roop as much as she does; but her fear (as well as his) of losing his humanity to `the system' may be the nail in the coffin of their seemingly perfect relationship.The key to this film is the wonderful performances by the two leads.  I have never even heard of Diahann Carroll before seeing this movie, but she is just luminous here, so much so that I want to research her resume and start watching some more movies.  An even bigger surprise to me was James Earl Jones, an actor who I tend to find a little stale.  He reminds me a little of Lawrence Fishburne, in that he almost never appears relaxed; always relying on the heaviness of his voice to carry him.  Here though he floored me, for he was loose, energetic, playful and very sincere.  It reminded me of the time I saw `What's Love Got to Do With It?' and realized that Fishburne had it in him to be something amazing.The script works for the most part, giving Claudine and Roop real personalities with real problems.  I like the fact that it shies away from making the `white man' the enemy but focuses on the corruptness of the system supposedly designed to `help'.  Like I said, I didn't like the final scene, which I felt was overdone and almost campy (it didn't fit at all) but for the most part the film excels, especially when it leaves the focus on the relationship between Claudine and Roop.I'm impressed, I must admit, and I'll surely watch this one again.",4,A genuinely sweet and endearing love story...,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2191,"['something', 'so', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'Claudine', 'warm', 'real', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'truly', 'faults', 'really', 'hated', 'campy', 'way', 'ended', 'uneven', 'mixture', 'grit', 'humor', 'can', 'make', 'appear', 'overlong', 'sitcom', 'episode', 'rich', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'performances', 'touching', 'screenplay', 'really', 'make', 'must-see', 'film.Claudine', 'single', 'mother', 'six', 'who', 'trying', 'survive', 'keeping', 'house', 'keeping', 'job', 'down', 'low', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'welfare', 'benefits', ""n't"", 'been', 'man', 'quite', 'time', 'so', 'when', 'Roop', 'big', 'hearted', 'garbage', 'man', 'very', 'eager', 'jump', 'relationship', 'even', 'kids', 'resent', ""n't"", 'long', 'children', 'love', 'Roop', 'as', 'much', 'fear', 'as', 'well', 'losing', 'humanity', 'system', 'may', 'be', 'nail', 'coffin', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'relationship.The', 'key', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'seeing', 'movie', 'just', 'luminous', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'research', 'resume', 'start', 'watching', 'more', 'movies', 'even', 'bigger', 'surprise', 'was', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'actor', 'who', 'tend', 'find', 'little', 'stale', 'little', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'almost', 'never', 'relaxed', 'always', 'relying', 'heaviness', 'voice', 'carry', 'Here', 'floored', 'was', 'loose', 'energetic', 'playful', 'very', 'sincere', 'reminded', 'time', 'saw', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'realized', 'Fishburne', 'had', 'be', 'something', 'amazing.The', 'script', 'works', 'most', 'part', 'giving', 'Claudine', 'Roop', 'real', 'personalities', 'real', 'problems', 'fact', 'away', 'making', 'white', 'man', 'enemy', 'corruptness', 'system', 'supposedly', 'designed', 'help', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'final', 'scene', 'felt', 'was', 'overdone', 'almost', 'campy', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'excels', 'especially', 'when', 'focus', 'relationship', 'Claudine', 'Roop.I', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'must', 'admit', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'watch', 'one', 'again']",N/A

It's intelligently scripted and well directed. The characters are generally believable and compelling. This tells a story of an unwed mother (Diahann Carroll) with six children. She is on welfare, has a job as a maid, but is still so impoverished that no one in the family has a car. She develops a relationship with a garbage man (James Earl Jones) who has reservations about becoming stepfather and provider for her children. Claudine has the impossible task of raising her children properly, earning a living, staying on public assistance which she clearly needs, and keeping her lover satisfied and stationary.Economical difficulties combined with some then racial limitations make this family lives miserable. This movie is a good representation of the American system at it's worst. The welfare system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet. The movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. In other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be jeopardized if not terminated. The struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world.The acting all around is excellent, even by the small children- while sometimes affectionate; they can also be selfish, bratty, and manipulative. James Earl Jones, a character actor who has become famous primarily for his deep and resonant voice, demonstrates in this film that he is also a capable leading actor. ""On and On."" is the opening title to this film and the soundtrack to this is great. It's performed by Gladys Knight and the Pips, with the songs written by Curtis Mayfield. The most discouraging aspect remains that so few movies that address the African American perspective have been made since this one, so this comes to show that ""Claudine"" is worth having.",4,"Fans that enjoy ""Good Times"" can easily stride with ""Claudine.""",1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2013,"['have', 'seen', 'Claudine', 'couple', 'times', 'years', 'find', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'intelligently', 'scripted', 'well', 'directed', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'believable', 'compelling', 'story', 'unwed', 'mother', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'six', 'children', 'welfare', 'job', 'maid', 'still', 'so', 'impoverished', 'one', 'family', 'car', 'relationship', 'garbage', 'man', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'who', 'reservations', 'becoming', 'stepfather', 'provider', 'children', 'Claudine', 'impossible', 'task', 'raising', 'children', 'properly', 'earning', 'living', 'staying', 'public', 'assistance', 'clearly', 'keeping', 'lover', 'satisfied', 'stationary.Economical', 'difficulties', 'combined', 'then', 'racial', 'limitations', 'make', 'family', 'miserable', 'movie', 'good', 'representation', 'American', 'system', 'worst', 'welfare', 'system', 'was', 'initially', 'set', 'up', 'stepping', 'stone', 'families', 'who', 'needed', 'extra', 'hand', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'movie', 'showed', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'how', 'welfare', 'system', 'down', 'family', 'unit', 'other', 'words', 'father', 'male', 'figure', 'lives', 'women', 'children', 'financial', 'support', 'system', 'would', 'be', 'jeopardized', 'not', 'terminated', 'struggles', 'poor', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'world.The', 'acting', 'around', 'excellent', 'even', 'small', 'children-', 'sometimes', 'affectionate', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'selfish', 'bratty', 'manipulative', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'become', 'famous', 'primarily', 'deep', 'resonant', 'voice', 'film', 'also', 'capable', 'leading', 'actor', 'opening', 'title', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'performed', 'Gladys', 'Knight', 'Pips', 'songs', 'written', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'most', 'discouraging', 'aspect', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'address', 'African', 'American', 'perspective', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'one', 'show', 'Claudine', 'worth', 'having']",N/A

Claudine was one of the first mainstream U.S. dramasto deal with the struggles of urban poor African-Americans without exploitation, violence or exaggerationon one side, or sugar coating or soft peddling on the other. It has sadness, anger and heartache, but alsojoy, love and humor. It has two smashing central performances by Diahann Carroll as the mother of six,trying to survive on welfare and an off the books job as a housekeeper, and James Earl Jones as a verycharming garbage man who woos her despite the risk their getting together could cut her welfare payments.Carroll is a wonder. One of the most glamorously beautiful actresses of her era, here she manages to bebelievable as an over-worked, under loved mother in the ghetto. Equal parts pain, pride, vulnerability,smarts and strength she was one of the first African Americans to get an Oscar nomination in a drama.Jones does some of his best film work. Always a great of the U.S. theater, in his early films Jones oftencame off as too theatrical, larger than life. But here is he subtle, sly, complicated, and very sexy. Theyoung actors playing Carroll&#8217;s six children are uniformly excellent, often a weak spot in a film like this.There are problems; some plot turns are predictable, some moments feel a bit &#8216;Hollywood&#8217;, some of itfeels awkwardly dated. But much of it is as relevant as ever, and not afraid to be upsetting and angryalong with it&#8217;s gentle comedy.Two notes, while often marketed as a &#8216;family&#8217; film, this deals with sex and nudity in an honest and realisticway, and it&#8217;s language is salty and true.

Although times are tough for her, she still loves her children enough to consider their point of view. And she's faced with the possibility of losing public assistance if she does marry. So true is how the government treat under-privileged people. They don't want you to have too much.

A welfare woman with SIX kids and a garbage man who ran out on his THREE kids?  Nine kids between them and I'm supposed to feel sorry for Rupert when the government starts garnishing his check?  NOT!  I realize this film was supposed to be landmark because it was trying to depict a normal black family just trying to get by and it came out during the blaxplortation era-so it was supposed to soften all the thugs and pimps stuff.  And maybe it did.  But it missed every mark with me as far as being a romance.  I was appalled by the first date-being taken to a roach and rat infested apartment where all the hookers say hello as he enters the building-and then having the date end with a bucket of fried chicken.  Then this woman with the SIX kids sleeps with this man on the first date. I swear I must have frowned through most of the movie.  The language of the children.  And can someone tell me how Charles had himself fixed?  How did he pay for this?  Whatever happened to birth control?  Condoms?  Why was I listening to rhetoric about how the welfare system doesn't work, instead of a public announcement for birth control?  And did the welfare system EVER work this efficiently?This film DID humanize black characters-but it definitely didn't put us in the best of lights.

James Earl Jones, one of hollywood's finest actors, plays a fantastic part; a part in which you can feel an emotional vibe, because two black people in the mid-70's is still victimized by  social injustices of our time.  It shows how two people, although victims of poverty can feel real love; and, how 6 children on welfare, whom are fatherless become defensive and lash-out at the world.The acting in this movie is superb, from Diahann Carroll, the character we knew as Julia can get down-and-dirty; James Earl Jones, who'd been over-looked by Hollywood for years, is so convincing, that you want to smile at your garbage man the next day.  Lawrence Hilton Jacobs, who was so funny in Welcome Back Kotter, now shows another side of his acting ability, as he plays Charles, the oldest of 6 children, who is so fed-up with the system he has a operation to avoid having children.And, the music is so typical of Curtis Mayfield, a composer who was ahead of his time, blends a combination of styles from &quot;On-and-On&quot; to &quot;The Makings of you&quot;, in a master-piece, similar to what he'd done in Superfly.
