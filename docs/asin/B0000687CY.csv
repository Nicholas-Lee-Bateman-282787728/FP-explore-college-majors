704036,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B0000687CY,Amy Lynn,"[4, 4]","This is the HBO home video DVD- 'Confessions of a Mafia Hitman'. It's a documentary that features different people interviewing Richard Kuklinski as he describes his life and crimes. Part 1 is from 1992 and part 2 is from 2001. Both are very interesting and a firsthand look at anti-social personality disorder...Over the span of these years between interviews Richard seemed to have gotten worse. He talks so matter of factly about his crimes and seems pretty honest about everything he's done though he claims most were just for business purposes. We get to see there is more to this story and hear from him about his dysfunctional early home life, his murders, his family and his life with the mafia. We also get to hear about the one friend Kuklinski trusted who ended up setting him up and turning him in.There's 2 iceman DVD's available and this one has about the same information in it as the other one. Slightly different camera angles between them but for the most part they were pretty much the same material other than the other DVD having some extra information with a psychiatrist which was better in my opinion. The other DVD 'The Iceman Interviews' has the one with the psychiatrist which is the only reason I prefer it to this DVD. Other than that these were good interviews and a truly interesting and disturbing look into the mind of Richard Kuklinski. 4.5 stars.",5,Iceman Interviews,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,1381,"['HBO', 'home', 'video', 'DVD-', ""'Confessions"", 'Mafia', 'Hitman', 'documentary', 'different', 'people', 'interviewing', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'life', 'crimes', 'Part', '1', '1992', 'part', '2', '2001', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'firsthand', 'look', 'anti-social', 'personality', 'disorder', 'span', 'years', 'interviews', 'Richard', 'seemed', 'have', 'gotten', 'worse', 'so', 'matter', 'factly', 'crimes', 'pretty', 'honest', 'everything', 'done', 'most', 'were', 'just', 'business', 'purposes', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'story', 'hear', 'dysfunctional', 'early', 'home', 'life', 'murders', 'family', 'life', 'mafia', 'also', 'get', 'hear', 'one', 'friend', 'Kuklinski', 'trusted', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'setting', 'up', 'turning', '2', 'iceman', 'DVD', 'available', 'one', 'same', 'information', 'other', 'one', 'Slightly', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'material', 'other', 'other', 'DVD', 'having', 'extra', 'information', 'psychiatrist', 'was', 'better', 'opinion', 'other', 'DVD', 'Iceman', 'Interviews', 'one', 'psychiatrist', 'only', 'reason', 'prefer', 'DVD', 'Other', 'were', 'good', 'interviews', 'truly', 'interesting', 'disturbing', 'look', 'mind', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', '4.5', 'stars']",The Iceman - Confessions of a Mafia Hitman

He is the walking prototype of antisocial personality disorder. Kuclinski, just as with all psychopaths, was born without the feelings the rest of us possess. When asked how he felt about murdering people, he said, ""I don't."" We should not doubt him as he is a moral and emotional void. Predictably, his childhood was harsh and brutal. He was bullied by others, and it only stopped once he began beating them back. The retaliation never ended until he was finally incarcerated. As an adult, violence never bothered him and became an acceptable part of his life. Killing was his root to power and control. As a hit man, he went from the gutter to economically fulfilling the American dream. His motto was ""good guys will finish last,"" but, luckily for us all, he was wrong as soon he will die in prison. He refuses to repent or apologize, and there is no doubt that he will be welcomed warmly below once his time on earth is finished.",5,"""Nothing Haunts Me.""",1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,1044,"['top', 'shelf', 'documentary', 'Seeing', 'story', 'monster', 'bit', 'as', 'amazing', 'disturbing', 'walking', 'prototype', 'antisocial', 'personality', 'disorder', 'Kuclinski', 'just', 'psychopaths', 'was', 'born', 'feelings', 'rest', 'possess', 'When', 'asked', 'how', 'felt', 'murdering', 'people', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'should', 'not', 'doubt', 'moral', 'emotional', 'void', 'Predictably', 'childhood', 'was', 'harsh', 'brutal', 'was', 'bullied', 'others', 'only', 'stopped', 'once', 'began', 'beating', 'back', 'retaliation', 'never', 'ended', 'was', 'finally', 'incarcerated', 'adult', 'violence', 'never', 'bothered', 'became', 'acceptable', 'part', 'life', 'Killing', 'was', 'root', 'power', 'control', 'hit', 'man', 'went', 'gutter', 'economically', 'fulfilling', 'American', 'dream', 'motto', 'was', 'good', 'guys', 'will', 'finish', 'last', 'luckily', 'was', 'wrong', 'as', 'soon', 'will', 'die', 'prison', 'repent', 'apologize', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'welcomed', 'warmly', 'once', 'time', 'earth', 'finished']",The Iceman - Confessions of a Mafia Hitman

In this documentary he talks about getting started with the mafia and several hits that he carried out. Listening to him tell the stories you can't help but think of things you've seen on television like The Sopranos... but this stuff actually happened. (Find out why they call him the ""iceman"".)Kuklinski talks about his childhood and his abusive parents. He talks about his theory that ""nice guys finish last"". He says that when he was younger he wanted to be left alone and to leave people alone but they kept bothering him. So he got a metal pipe and beat up a group of 6 guys. From then on he'd established his motto ""If you hurt someone first, they'll leave you alone.""Listening to Kuklinski talk is a bit mesmerizing. He's very deadpan and entirely unemotional. When asked how he felt about killing someone he says ""I don't."" and it's easy to believe after listening to him talk. This is definitely a DVD to rent, unless you're really interested in listening to descriptions of murders over and over.
