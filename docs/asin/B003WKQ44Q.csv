1369401,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B003WKQ44Q,Irfan A. Alvi,"[4, 4]","This is a good introduction to gothic cathedrals for a general audience.  Their design and construction was an achievement which appropriately inspires awe even today, and I think this program gives us a good sense of why that is.Looking at it from my engineering background, I did feel that some technical concepts were oversimplified and some terminology was misused - probably because the people interviewed apparently weren't engineers - but this isn't a fatal flaw and the content of the program was accurate enough for its purposes.  And indeed, I learned some things too (engineers today don't design gothic cathedrals!).My biggest issue with the program, and the reason I've deducted one star, is that the religious connection hypothesized in the last third of the program is highly dubious.  They claim that design proportions drawn from the Bible and other religious texts were the key to making these structures stable, but the reality is that successful design proportions were the result of trial and error over a long period of time.  Sorry, there was no 'divine revelation' going on here.Recommended, but take the last third of the program with a major grain of salt.",4,"Good, but imperfect",1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,1182,"['good', 'introduction', 'gothic', 'cathedrals', 'general', 'audience', 'design', 'construction', 'was', 'achievement', 'appropriately', 'awe', 'even', 'today', 'think', 'program', 'good', 'sense', 'why', 'is.Looking', 'engineering', 'background', 'did', 'feel', 'technical', 'concepts', 'were', 'oversimplified', 'terminology', 'was', 'misused', 'probably', 'people', 'interviewed', 'apparently', 'were', ""n't"", 'engineers', ""n't"", 'fatal', 'flaw', 'content', 'program', 'was', 'accurate', 'enough', 'purposes', 'indeed', 'learned', 'things', 'too', 'engineers', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'design', 'gothic', 'cathedrals', '.My', 'biggest', 'issue', 'program', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'religious', 'connection', 'hypothesized', 'last', 'third', 'program', 'highly', 'dubious', 'claim', 'design', 'proportions', 'drawn', 'Bible', 'other', 'religious', 'texts', 'were', 'key', 'making', 'structures', 'stable', 'reality', 'successful', 'design', 'proportions', 'were', 'result', 'trial', 'error', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'Sorry', 'was', ""'divine"", 'revelation', 'going', 'here.Recommended', 'take', 'last', 'third', 'program', 'major', 'grain', 'salt']",Nova: Building the Great Cathedrals

The video quality is high, visits to these cathedrals recent, and recreations of building techniques valuable.I give this five stars.However, here is a bit of counterpoint:1/ I found the description of structure removed in pieces from Europe to California disgusting. Leave it to the Americans to use a diamond saw to fundamentally change the surface of the original blocks.  They could have started with new stone just as easily and thus preserved the makers marks and weathering on the originals.  But, what would we expect from Americans?2/ The jazz at the end about the sacred numbers seemed to be a tawdry afterthought designed to pander to those who had trouble comprehending the program.  ( Most Americans )3/  While the photography is VERY good the video uses a very disjointing camera technique not well suited to the grandeur and sublimity of the subject ( what else would you expect of Americans? )  This technique, probably thought quite artsy by the producers, consists of very rapidly jerking the camera over the subject and very rapid scene changes.  I think this would go well with a video about car or motorcycle racing or something else Americans enjoy while munching their bread sticks slathered with ""dipping sauce"".In sum: Great videography except for #3 above; passable narrative.  The video would have almost certainly been far better and more fitting to the subject ( respectful ) had it been done by Europeans preferably French speaking French with English subtitles.",5,Excellent,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,1565,"['will', 'not', 'restate', 'glowing', 'praise', 'other', 'reviews', 'true', 'video', 'quality', 'high', 'visits', 'cathedrals', 'recent', 'recreations', 'building', 'techniques', 'valuable.I', 'give', 'five', 'stars.However', 'here', 'bit', 'counterpoint:1/', 'found', 'description', 'structure', 'removed', 'pieces', 'Europe', 'California', 'disgusting', 'Leave', 'Americans', 'use', 'diamond', 'saw', 'fundamentally', 'change', 'surface', 'original', 'blocks', 'could', 'have', 'started', 'new', 'stone', 'just', 'easily', 'thus', 'preserved', 'makers', 'marks', 'weathering', 'originals', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'Americans', '2/', 'jazz', 'end', 'sacred', 'numbers', 'seemed', 'be', 'tawdry', 'afterthought', 'designed', 'pander', 'who', 'had', 'trouble', 'comprehending', 'program', 'Most', 'Americans', '3/', 'photography', 'VERY', 'good', 'video', 'very', 'disjointing', 'camera', 'technique', 'not', 'well', 'suited', 'grandeur', 'sublimity', 'subject', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'Americans', 'technique', 'probably', 'thought', 'quite', 'artsy', 'producers', 'consists', 'very', 'rapidly', 'jerking', 'camera', 'subject', 'very', 'rapid', 'scene', 'changes', 'think', 'would', 'go', 'well', 'video', 'car', 'motorcycle', 'racing', 'something', 'else', 'Americans', 'enjoy', 'munching', 'bread', 'sticks', 'slathered', 'dipping', 'sauce', 'sum', 'Great', 'videography', '3', 'passable', 'narrative', 'video', 'would', 'have', 'almost', 'certainly', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'fitting', 'subject', 'respectful', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'Europeans', 'preferably', 'French', 'speaking', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles']",Nova: Building the Great Cathedrals

An ancient Roman hoisting machine allows workers to life six times their own weight - the 150 lb. stones are well within the limit. Pressure from the weight of the stones and precise alignment are more important to keeping things in place than the limited mortar of the day. Flying buttresses, arches, ribbed vaults, and in one case, an iron chain are also key, and allowed walls to contain large stained-glass windows.Some center areas were more than 12 stories high.

Modern engineers, architects, art historians, and computer scientists study the great cathedrals today - both to learn more about how such incredible temples were created, and to devise ways to save them from ruin.

1369409,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B003WKQ44Q,"Ray ""A Reader""","[35, 35]","Although this is a short, one hour work, it is a wonderfully filmed and professionally written introduction to some of the great Gothic cathedrals of France. Because the production is so new  -- it was released in late 2010 -- the production has extremely recent footage of Amiens, Beauvais, and Notre Dame of Paris, with some shots of Chartres, Noyon, and the ruins at Ourscamp as additional teasers. The show is excellent for anyone wishing to be introduced to these marvelous structures, and even has a few unusual tidbits thrown in even for seasoned Gothic enthusiasts.The episode focuses on the essential structural components of Gothic architecture, and keeps the narrative simple by focusing on the three most significant structural methods at use in the Gothic enterprise: pointed arches, flying buttresses, and ribbed vaulting. The video footage is absolutely first-rate, with most all of the footage new, and filmed with extremely good equipment (although this is not, sadly, high definition). In addition, the computer images that are used to illustrate the discussion are extremely well done, embedded directly within the video footage itself. If you think you'll have trouble visualizing the content, all you have to do is sit back and watch. The computer illustrations overlaid upon the video footage makes it all plain as day.If you've had the chance to visit Beauvais, Amiens, Chartres, and Notre Dame, this video will bring back both warm memories, but will also help you to look afresh at these structures in a new way. If you've not yet had the chance to visit these structures, this video can serve as both your introduction to them and also as a teaser to do so as soon as possible. Although we can quibble at some of the numerical ""coding"" content at the end of the production that seems more an attempt to draw in the Da Vinci Code crowd, don't let that keep you away from a beautifully filmed and wonderfully illustrated look at French Gothic cathedrals.
