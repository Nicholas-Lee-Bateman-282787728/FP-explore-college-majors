1430470,A3K65JH0785O7V,B004W75BTM,"Bryce Campbell ""just another anime fan""","[2, 3]","Before I start, I got this just this week from RightStuf, even though this should not come until August.Two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, have committed a grave mistake and paid for it dearly. Edward lost an arm and a leg, while Alphonse lost his whole body. Now, the two have set out in search of the Philosopher's Stone, even if it means joining the military. However, they are not the only ones seeking the stone.In this set, Colonel Mustang finds out exactly who killed his friend, Hughes, which causes him to go on a pursuit of revenge. When Mustang regains his senses, the group heads beneath Central to prevent the demise of the nation of Amestris by a being who had done the same thing to the nation of Xerxes. Elsewhere, Greed and the Briggs soldiers are trying to keep control of Central HQ, but suffer major causalities against Fuherer Bradley. Finally, the final battle against Father takes place.I pretty much liked it all. The death of Envy was interesting, but nothing compared to Pride's defeat. The characters all sounded good and unlike the last set, there were no references to past voices after an actor got replaced (only one actor was replaced anyway during the dubbing of this show). I also enjoyed how Roy was the one being lectured about revenge this time by Scar, instead of the latter being lectured by his own people. It shows how much Scar really learned from his mistakes, even though his hatred for Amestris never really disappear. Greed's demise was a bit sad, when he had finally become content with the friends he had gain. Last of all, I enjoyed the ending of this series way more than the original Full Metal Alchemist anime. In the latter, it did not seem like the Elric brothers learned anything, whereas Ed finally realizes that even with Alchemy, he is just a normal human and that he can accomplish things without it. The series had a very enjoyable end, as well as nice fights.There is not much to say that is wrong with the product that was released by FUNimation. However, there is one thing that kind of annoys me, but that is mainly Bones Studio's fault. The end of FMAB should have been an hour long episode, just like the manga ended with only one chapter, instead of two. Not only is it because the ending of the manga is only one chapter, but the closing credits to episode 63 was something that would have worked better as the final ending of the show, instead of the picture montage we get in episode 64. Outside of that, my only other problem is something that has become a normality. The ending could have been better as an hour long episode, but the annoyance of it is not that big to take the series down too much, especially since it is Japan's fault.Despite the fact that the final episodes should have been combined into an hour long special, the set is still a pretty good release and has a satisfying conclusion.Overall, I recommend people watch the episodes on this set, as well as the series, no matter whether they are newcomers to the FMA franchise or long-time fans. The story has the most unique ideas of alchemy and the Philosopher's stone in almost any medium and the humor is pretty good.",5,Great Release and nice ending,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,3165,"['start', 'got', 'just', 'week', 'RightStuf', 'even', 'should', 'not', 'come', 'August.Two', 'brothers', 'Edward', 'Alphonse', 'Elric', 'have', 'committed', 'grave', 'mistake', 'paid', 'dearly', 'Edward', 'lost', 'arm', 'leg', 'Alphonse', 'lost', 'whole', 'body', 'Now', 'two', 'have', 'set', 'out', 'search', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'even', 'joining', 'military', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'seeking', 'stone.In', 'set', 'Colonel', 'Mustang', 'out', 'exactly', 'who', 'killed', 'friend', 'Hughes', 'go', 'pursuit', 'revenge', 'When', 'Mustang', 'senses', 'group', 'beneath', 'Central', 'prevent', 'demise', 'nation', 'Amestris', 'being', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'same', 'thing', 'nation', 'Xerxes', 'Elsewhere', 'Greed', 'Briggs', 'soldiers', 'are', 'trying', 'keep', 'control', 'Central', 'HQ', 'suffer', 'major', 'causalities', 'Fuherer', 'Bradley', 'Finally', 'final', 'battle', 'Father', 'place.I', 'pretty', 'much', 'liked', 'death', 'Envy', 'was', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Pride', 'defeat', 'characters', 'sounded', 'good', 'last', 'set', 'were', 'references', 'past', 'voices', 'actor', 'got', 'replaced', 'only', 'one', 'actor', 'was', 'replaced', 'anyway', 'dubbing', 'show', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Roy', 'was', 'one', 'being', 'lectured', 'revenge', 'time', 'Scar', 'instead', 'latter', 'being', 'lectured', 'own', 'people', 'how', 'much', 'Scar', 'really', 'learned', 'mistakes', 'even', 'hatred', 'Amestris', 'never', 'really', 'disappear', 'Greed', 'demise', 'was', 'bit', 'sad', 'when', 'had', 'finally', 'become', 'content', 'friends', 'had', 'gain', 'Last', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'series', 'way', 'more', 'original', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'anime', 'latter', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'learned', 'anything', 'whereas', 'Ed', 'finally', 'even', 'Alchemy', 'just', 'normal', 'human', 'can', 'accomplish', 'things', 'series', 'had', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'wrong', 'product', 'was', 'released', 'FUNimation', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'kind', 'annoys', 'mainly', 'Bones', 'Studio', 'fault', 'end', 'FMAB', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'hour', 'long', 'episode', 'just', 'manga', 'ended', 'only', 'one', 'chapter', 'instead', 'two', 'Not', 'only', 'ending', 'manga', 'only', 'one', 'chapter', 'closing', 'credits', 'episode', '63', 'was', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'final', 'ending', 'show', 'instead', 'picture', 'montage', 'get', 'episode', '64', 'only', 'other', 'problem', 'something', 'become', 'normality', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'hour', 'long', 'episode', 'annoyance', 'not', 'that', 'big', 'take', 'series', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'Japan', 'fault.Despite', 'fact', 'final', 'episodes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'combined', 'hour', 'long', 'special', 'set', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'release', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.Overall', 'recommend', 'people', 'watch', 'episodes', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'matter', 'are', 'newcomers', 'FMA', 'franchise', 'long-time', 'fans', 'story', 'most', 'unique', 'ideas', 'alchemy', 'Philosopher', 'stone', 'almost', 'medium', 'humor', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A

Unfortunately I can't because I don't want to spoil anything for people that haven't seen it.This last set was a thrill ride from beginning to end. The last 12 episodes gripped my attention so effectively that I finished this in one night. During this last set, the story's climax starts, there are at least 4 different battles going on at the same time, and still has that staggering effect on your heartstrings.The fight scenes are among the best I've seen in anime for quite some time. They are very fluid, and eye-popping at some points. You'll even find yourself looking for small details when they're fighting because of which hero and villian is fighting. Also, the story telling in this anime, if you've gotten this far, you'll know already that it grips your attention. It's got something for every audience: drama, a subtle love story, action, martial arts, stunning visuals, comedy, and lovable characters that you'll love and hate depending on whom your talking about. Your empathy will kick in for the characters at the end and I'm sure that, for some of you, you will need a box of tissues handy for those tender moments.If you've followed the series up to boxset 4, buy box 5 immediately. Arakawa Hiromu, BONES, and Funimation do not disappoint. Also the extras on the 2nd DVD are so worth it. There are outtakes. I know what you're thinking: ""Anime outtakes? How does that happen?"" The voice actors are being silly and just add in lines that are situational or they just plain forgot their lines and just addlibbed. My sides hurt after watching this.

These final episodes are filled with many revelations, plot twists and turns that leave the viewer sitting on the edge of their seat waiting to find out what happens next.  I have to admit that I was a little worried about the story being stretched out and slowing down in order to cover twelve episodes.  However, I'm happy to say that all twelve episodes were needed to finish the story, and there's not a boring moment in this set.There are no bonus features included on the first disc of this set.  However, there are six extras included on the second disc.  The first extra is a commentary for episode sixty-four (""Journey's End"").  The next feature is labeled as ""Outtakes.""  This feature opens with an introduction from the ADR director for the English dub, and he explains that this feature is comprised of actual dubbing errors and some humor from when the cast was goofing off in the studio.  He also gives a warning that there is some ""adult language"" included in this feature, which ends up running for about seven-and-a-half minutes.  Personally, I found this feature to be rather amusing.Next is ""Textless Opening Song,"" which is a textless version of the opening credits that appears on this set.  Next is ""Textless Closing Song,"" which is a textless version of the main ending credits that appears on this set.  There is also ""Textless Closing Song #2,"" which is a textless version of the ending credits that appear at the end of the final episode of the series.

The series will show us the final trials of the Elric brothers as we see them fight the enigma known as ""Father"" and his malicious schemes that he has concocted for centuries,  as well we get to see the vast array of characters who have their own personal grudges and scores to settle with.  The characters are incredible from start to finish as well as the story for the series which has a vast variety of emotional scopes and genres in the series Action/Drama/Romance/Angst/Humor/Tragedy and of course joy as you see the accomplishments and the perils that our beloved characters face to see their job done.  The animation and soundtrack are done well and match each other perfectly and of course a great cast of actors/actresses for both the subbed and dubbed who did a terrific performance in their roles.  If I have one sad complaint it's just that now we won't see anymore new stories of our characters who we rooted for from start to finish though there is a new movie coming out so that is a bright side to this.  So for any fan of the series both the previous release we had a few years ago and this new incredible release or if your just looking for an incredible series for your anime collection than look no farther because this one ranks as one of the top series to get....",5,Great Finale And More Upbeat Conclusion For Some Of Our Beloved Characters,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,1498,"['final', 'episodes', 'conclude', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'series', 'more', 'endearing', 'more', 'positive', 'conclusion', 'endearing', 'characters', 'truly', 'wished', 'previous', 'season', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'series', 'will', 'show', 'final', 'trials', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'see', 'fight', 'enigma', 'known', 'Father', 'malicious', 'schemes', 'concocted', 'centuries', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'see', 'vast', 'array', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'personal', 'grudges', 'scores', 'settle', 'characters', 'are', 'incredible', 'start', 'finish', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'series', 'vast', 'variety', 'emotional', 'scopes', 'genres', 'series', 'Action/Drama/Romance/Angst/Humor/Tragedy', 'course', 'joy', 'see', 'accomplishments', 'perils', 'beloved', 'characters', 'face', 'see', 'job', 'done', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'match', 'other', 'perfectly', 'course', 'great', 'cast', 'actors/actresses', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'who', 'did', 'terrific', 'performance', 'roles', 'have', 'one', 'sad', 'complaint', 'just', 'that', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anymore', 'new', 'stories', 'characters', 'who', 'rooted', 'start', 'finish', 'new', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'so', 'that', 'bright', 'side', 'So', 'fan', 'series', 'previous', 'release', 'had', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'new', 'incredible', 'release', 'just', 'looking', 'incredible', 'series', 'anime', 'collection', 'look', 'farther', 'one', 'one', 'top', 'series', 'get']",N/A

With the stage set, all your favorite characters engage in an epic chess match, trying to outwit the mastermind behind an evil plot that threatens everyone. As the story races to a close, so do the numerous character arcs. The fight scenes in this last segment are intense and engrossing as each character decides how they can give their all to save their friends. sound a little vague? I'm trying not to spoil the fun. if you have watched up to this point, you will love this last installment.The final enemy's grab for power and the scenes that compose it are a little crazy (more than a little hint of some Evangelion scenes mixed in to boot), but the way Ed and Al resolve their fate was both clever and moving.By this point, the differences between the two series are more than apparent, but one thing i will say is that, where the first anime series has a more dramatic - and maybe more poetic - climax, Brotherhood ends in a more satisfying way. Across the board of fantastic characters, there are few loose strings left lying around. I love this series. if you like anime, and if you have been following the story, this last chapter is more than worth it.",5,Fitting Ending to a Instant Classic,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,1228,"['Part', 'Five', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'series', 'dramatic', 'close', 'stage', 'set', 'favorite', 'characters', 'engage', 'epic', 'chess', 'match', 'trying', 'outwit', 'mastermind', 'evil', 'plot', 'everyone', 'story', 'races', 'close', 'so', 'do', 'numerous', 'character', 'arcs', 'fight', 'scenes', 'last', 'segment', 'are', 'intense', 'engrossing', 'character', 'how', 'can', 'give', 'save', 'friends', 'sound', 'little', 'vague', ""'m"", 'trying', 'not', 'spoil', 'fun', 'have', 'watched', 'up', 'point', 'will', 'love', 'last', 'installment.The', 'final', 'enemy', 'grab', 'power', 'scenes', 'compose', 'are', 'little', 'crazy', 'more', 'little', 'hint', 'Evangelion', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'boot', 'way', 'Ed', 'Al', 'resolve', 'fate', 'was', 'clever', 'moving.By', 'point', 'differences', 'two', 'series', 'are', 'more', 'apparent', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'where', 'first', 'anime', 'series', 'more', 'dramatic', 'maybe', 'more', 'poetic', 'climax', 'Brotherhood', 'more', 'satisfying', 'way', 'board', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'are', 'few', 'loose', 'strings', 'left', 'lying', 'around', 'love', 'series', 'like', 'anime', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'story', 'last', 'chapter', 'more']",N/A
