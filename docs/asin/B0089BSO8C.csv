1548938,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0089BSO8C,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[7, 8]","Based on the classic play (""Orphan of Zhao""), SACRIFICE is written and directed by Chen Kaige of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE fame.  It's the story of duplicitous dealings to seize power during the Yuan Dynasty in the 5th century B.C.  When the Zhao clan is wiped out by Tu'an Gu (played by Wang Xue Ki), a common doctor named Cheng Ying (Ge You) rises up to take the family's last survivor - an infant prince - into his possession.  However, Tu'an Gu refuses to be anyone fools, and he orders all newborns to be taken under to the palace until the baby prince is surrendered.  A tragic twist of fate leaves Cheng without his wife and his own son, but he raises the prince as his own.  When the boy comes of age, will he rise up and take back the reign of leadership, or will he instead bow down to Tu'an, who he now looks upon as his own godfather?While a terrific film, SACRIFICE is not without a few creative hiccups.  In fact, I found the opening fifteen minutes of the film more than a bit confusing, as - for reasons I couldn't figure - writer/director Chen employed a very choppy narrative with which to set all these players in motion.  There's a bit of confusion as several sequences play out-of-order in proper chronology.  On the face of it, it appears as if it was entirely a stylistic consideration, though I'm not convinced it was the wisest decision.  However, once these relationships are fully established, the film (thankfully) drops into a more conventional pace - Cheng is seen raising the prince through several years - and the story makes perfect sense.Much of the story is the stuff solid `classics' are drawn from.  There's the traditional pomp and circumstance of dealing with royal clans.  There's the lowly peasant (in this case, the town physician) who makes a pact with a dying princess to protect her son.  There's even plenty of scheming along the sidelines as a palace guard (Han Jue, played by Xiaming Huong) is forced to choose sides between the warring clans, and, as a consequence of his choosing, he's left scarred physically and emotionally throughout the remainder of his life.  And it's all set against the backdrop of secret identities and hidden agendas when, once revealed, will rock the kingdom to its very core.Throughout the film, the underlying theme of `sacrifice' gets explored from several perspectives.  Certainly, the doctor has given up on what would be a normal life by having to spend most of his days committed to honoring his oath to the princess.  Han Jue finds himself in a similar predicament, no longer allowed to serve the palace due to his disgrace in securing the newborn prince.  Even General Tu'an's storyline deals superficially with sacrificing his own hope for a suitable heir (a subplot given too little time to merit serious exploration here) and instead opting to assist in raising his godson.  Cheng's story remains front and center, and, in the bulk of his screen time explaining his choices to the prince - Cheng Bo - once he comes of age, it becomes clear how far he's been driven to maintain his sacrifice.  The cost is nothing short of his own, personal happiness.To its credit, SACRIFICE played to some acclaim in its native China, and it even garnered critical acclaim.  In 2011, You Ge was nominated for Best Actor in the Asian Film Awards, and Xiaming Huong received a nod for Best Supporting Actor.  You Ge was also nominated for Best Actor in the People's Choice award.  While neither man won the award, both certainly give exceptional performances here.  Technically, the film is very accomplished, being shot on a budget of $10M.  At times, it looks as sumptuous as one would expect, though some of the exterior locations seemed a bit slim to this period piece junkie.SACRIFICE is produced by 21 Century Shengkai Film, the Shanghai Film Group, Stellar Megamedia, and TIK Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by Vivendi Entertainment.  How does it look and sound?  This is another disc that I had to crank up the volume in order to really capture the dialogue in the center track - I've had a few of these lately - but, otherwise, quality was solid.  Picture quality is excellent, though there was one short sequence filled with grain for reasons I couldn't quite figure out.  It's a Cantonese soundtrack with English subtitles.  As is too often the case with foreign releases hitting U.S. shores (and stores), there are no special features to speak of, a sad, sad commentary on film in itself.  I definitely would've liked to know more about the production.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  My online friends know me all too well, recommending SACRIFICE to me as they believed it would be `right up my alley.'  Indeed, it's a strong picture - part period piece, part morality tale, part crafty revenge flick - but it ain't perfect.  It stumbles a bit out of the gate - what were they thinking with hopping around chronologically in so short a time span? - and the latter half is plagued with some curious editing and some somewhat amateurish combat choreography (don't look too closely, or you'll see some shockingly clear misses in the swordplay, though they're played to full effect); still, when story matters most, the film achieves its own subtle, cinematic grace.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Vivendi Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener of SACRIFICE for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,THREE AND ONE-HALF STARS: Period Melodrama Shows The Beauty of SACRIFICE,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,5439,"['Based', 'classic', 'play', 'Orphan',
