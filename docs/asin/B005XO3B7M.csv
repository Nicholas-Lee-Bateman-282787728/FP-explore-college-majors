I loved the zany crazy people in this story. It is fun, not to be taken too seriously, but gives hope. I am glad I bought it. It took me too long to review it, but better late than never. I just make many purchases from Amazon as they don't disappoint either!",4,Unrealistic but fun,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,368,"['Let', 'just', 'say', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'loved', 'zany', 'crazy', 'people', 'story', 'fun', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'hope', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'took', 'too', 'long', 'review', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'just', 'make', 'many', 'purchases', 'Amazon', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'either']",Greatest Love

Cha Seung-Won is one of my favorite actors and I have seen everything that he has starred in. The drama is funny and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Cha Seung-Won was made for this role and he plays this role well. I highly recommend it.,5,Loved IT,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,332,"['Greatest', 'Love', 'one', 'favorite', 'all-time', 'K-drama', ""'m"", 'glad', 'added', 'library', 'Cha', 'Seung-Won', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'have', 'seen', 'everything', 'starred', 'drama', 'funny', 'edge', 'seat', 'Cha', 'Seung-Won', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'role', 'well', 'highly', 'recommend']",Greatest Love

I've watched it several times already and the story just doesn't get old.I will note for family viewing, there is minor reference to ""woohoo"".  Mostly verbal reference and few ""imagination"" sequences that reference sexual situations but nothing overt.

Stevenson ""WIAPilot""","[15, 17]","I actually watched THE GREATEST LOVE on Drama Fever via Roku, but if you are looking for a great Korean Drama with English subtitles, you can't go wrong with this set of 16 episodes.If you haven't discovered Korean Dramas, I urge you to give them a try.  I abhor Kung Fu movies and have never enjoyed foreign films, but Korean Dramas are all I watch now, it seems.  I love the plots and learning about their culture, but also because Korean films are so unpredictable.  You never know how many of them are going to end! Likewise, virtually all of these series have a set number of episodes of 16-24 hour episodes, like the mini-series that we have in the U.S., rather than programs that go on for years if they are successful.THE GREATEST LOVE is a rather charming, but odd movie in some ways.  It is about Koo Ae-Jeong, who was previously a huge star in an all-girl group - kind of like The Spice Girls.  The group disbanded and for the last 10 years, she has been the sole supporter of her family.  She has earned her money by singing in dives and taking almost any singing job she can get.She abruptly meets Dokgo, who is this mega movie star.  He is arrogant and ridiculously proud, but finds himself strangely drawn to her.  Amazingly, Dokgo can't fathom why he is the least bit interested in Koo Ae-Jeong, as he considers her totally beneath him.  OK - This is the part that is odd:  It turns out that Dokgo has an artificial heart and years ago while he was undergoing surgery - his doctor was listening to music performed by Koo Ae-Jeong and her girl group, as he felt that he performed better surgery while listening to music.  And THAT is why Dokgo is so enamored with her.  (We won't even ask how he is able to be insured for his movies with an artificial heart - but that is another story!!)In spite of a few stretches to the imagination, this movie really is very cute and the acting is brilliant!",5,Cute Korean Drama...,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,1910,"['actually', 'watched', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'LOVE', 'Drama', 'Fever', 'Roku', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'Korean', 'Drama', 'English', 'subtitles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'set', '16', 'episodes.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'Korean', 'Dramas', 'urge', 'give', 'try', 'abhor', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'enjoyed', 'foreign', 'films', 'Korean', 'Dramas', 'are', 'watch', 'now', 'love', 'plots', 'learning', 'culture', 'also', 'Korean', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'unpredictable', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'Likewise', 'virtually', 'series', 'have', 'set', 'number', 'episodes', '16-24', 'hour', 'episodes', 'mini-series', 'have', 'U.S.', 'rather', 'programs', 'go', 'years', 'are', 'successful.THE', 'GREATEST', 'LOVE', 'rather', 'charming', 'odd', 'movie', 'ways', 'Koo', 'Ae-Jeong', 'who', 'was', 'previously', 'huge', 'star', 'all-girl', 'group', 'kind', 'Spice', 'Girls', 'group', 'disbanded', 'last', '10', 'years', 'been', 'sole', 'supporter', 'family', 'earned', 'money', 'singing', 'dives', 'taking', 'almost', 'singing', 'job', 'can', 'get.She', 'abruptly', 'meets', 'Dokgo', 'who', 'mega', 'movie', 'star', 'arrogant', 'ridiculously', 'proud', 'strangely', 'drawn', 'Amazingly', 'Dokgo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'why', 'least', 'bit', 'interested', 'Koo', 'Ae-Jeong', 'totally', 'beneath', 'part', 'odd', 'out', 'Dokgo', 'artificial', 'heart', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'undergoing', 'surgery', 'doctor', 'was', 'listening', 'music', 'performed', 'Koo', 'Ae-Jeong', 'girl', 'group', 'felt', 'performed', 'better', 'surgery', 'listening', 'music', 'why', 'Dokgo', 'so', 'enamored', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'ask', 'how', 'able', 'be', 'insured', 'movies', 'artificial', 'heart', 'story', 'spite', 'few', 'stretches', 'imagination', 'movie', 'really', 'very', 'cute', 'acting', 'brilliant']",Greatest Love
